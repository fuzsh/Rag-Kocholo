He was also minister of health and welfare (1966-67).\n\nBo-Boliko Lokonga Monse Mihambo, (André) (b. Aug. 15, 1934, Lobamiti, Belgian Congo [now in Mai-Ndombe province, Congo (Kinshasa)] - d.

July 3, 1949, Dingxiang county, Shanxi, China), Chinese politician; son of Bo Yibo. He fell from favour during the Cultural Revolution (1966-76) and spent five years in reeducation classes and physical labour. In 1984 he began a government career in Liaoning province as a county CCP secretary. He became executive vice-mayor of Dalian in 1989 and mayor in 1992; in the latter post he was successful in increasing foreign investment and tourism. In 1999-2000 he was also CCP secretary of Dalian. He then became governor of Liaoning (2001-04) and commerce minister of China (2004-07), a post that brought him international attention for his key role in China's business and trade. In 2007, at the 17th party congress, Bo was appointed to the Political Bureau and became party secretary of Chongqing. Bo's policies became known as the \"Chongqing model\"; under his rule the municipality's gross domestic product increased at an average annual rate of 15.8%. Bo was seen as a likely candidate to succeed Pres. Hu Jintao. On Feb. 6, 2012, Wang Lijun, whom Bo had removed as police chief four days earlier, sought asylum at the U.S. consulate in Chengdu; there he claimed that Bo's wife Gu Kailai had poisoned Neil Heywood, a British businessman who had been found dead on Nov. 15, 2011, in a hotel room in Chongqing. The death had been attributed to excessive alcohol consumption. Bo was removed from his post as Chongqing party secretary on March 15, 2012, and from all other CCP posts the following month. He was placed under investigation for corruption and \"serious discipline violations.\" On July 26 Gu and Zhang Xiaojun, an employee of Bo, were charged with Heywood's murder. It was said that, following a dispute with Heywood, her close business associate, Gu lured him to Chongqing and, with Zhang's assistance, poisoned him with cyanide after incapacitating him with alcohol. At the conclusion of their trial, on August 20, Gu received a suspended death sentence and Zhang received a nine-year prison sentence. Bo was expelled from the Communist Party in November. In September 2013 he was found guilty of bribery, embezzlement, and abuse of power and sentenced to life imprisonment.\n\nBo Yibo\n\nBo Yibo (b. Feb. 17, 1908, Dingxiang county, Shanxi, China - d.

After the Communist victory in 1949, he rose to become chairman of the State Economic Commission in 1955 and vice-premier in 1957. He was purged during the Cultural Revolution and endured a decade of disgrace but was rehabilitated in 1978 and returned to the office of vice-premier in 1979. He was later considered one of the \"Eight Immortals,\" the group of revolutionary veterans who included Deng Xiaoping.

March 11, 1745, Awa, Kingdom of Awa [now Myanmar] - d. June 5, 1819, Amarapura, Kingdom of Awa), king of Awa (1782-1819). A son of Alaungphaya, the founder of the Konbaung dynasty, Bodawphaya came to power after deposing and executing his grandnephew Maung Maung. In 1784 he conquered Arakan, the maritime kingdom on the eastern coast of the Bay of Bengal, captured its king, Thamada, and deported more than 20,000 people into Awa as slaves. The king's success in Arakan led him to invade Siam in 1785, but his army was defeated. Bodawphaya's rule in Arakan was so oppressive that the people revolted in 1794. When the king sent an army to crush the revolt, thousands of refugees fled to British territory, with Awa troops crossing the border in pursuit of the rebel leaders. Conditions on the border became so unsettled that in 1795 the British sent a representative to Amarapura, the Awa capital, to negotiate with Bodawphaya. The disturbances continued, however, and Bodawphaya's campaigns in Assam added to the tension. Open conflict was narrowly avoided, but the British severed diplomatic relations in 1811. Bodawphaya was a fervent Buddhist who allegedly proclaimed himself maitreya (the Buddhist messiah destined to conquer the world), but the historicity of this episode is uncertain. He persecuted heterodox sects and made drinking, smoking opium, and killing animals punishable by death. He built many pagodas, his most ambitious project being the Mingun pagoda, which, if completed, would have been 150 m high; he had the world's largest bell cast to go with the pagoda. During his reign, he made a major economic survey of the entire kingdom (1784).\n\nBodden, Truman (Murray) (b.

He was elected leader of the Labour Party in 1927 and immediately began to instill in the workers the need of rightfully equal representation in government in order to have a say in their own affairs. He was in coalition with Lord Strickland's party in government (1927-32). In 1932 he was the only Labour Party candidate elected to the Legislative Assembly until it was dissolved in 1933.

He became the first native Catholic priest in Oubangui-Chari in 1938, but was laicized when he married. On Nov. 10, 1946, he was elected to the French National Assembly, winning against an administration-backed candidate. He soon denounced the colonial administration and left the French Catholic party, Mouvement Républicain Populaire. In September 1949 he founded his own party, Mouvement pour l'Évolution Sociale de l'Afrique Noire, which he dominated completely. In the 1951 campaign a French administrator briefly arrested him for \"endangering the peace.\" From then on Boganda's prestige was essentially unchallenged. Even the French realized it was useless to oppose him and in 1953 appointed a new governor to conciliate him. In November 1956 he was elected mayor of Bangui. In 1956 he also came to an agreement with French businessmen, who offered him financial support in return for European representation on municipal and territorial election lists. Boganda then turned his attention to French Equatorial Africa as a whole (which also included Chad, Gabon, and Middle Congo). He hoped for a federation of these states under African rather than French control, and for the eventual creation of a \"United States of Latin Africa\" that would also include Angola, the Belgian Congo, Ruanda-Urundi, and Cameroon. By late 1958 this dream was shattered, and he turned back to the new Central African Republic, where he became prime minister but was killed a few months later in an airplane crash.\n\nBogdanov, Andrey (Vladimirovich) (b.

Bokassa\n\nBokassa, Jean-Bédel, also called (Oct. 17-Dec. 4, 1976) Salah Eddine Ahmed Bokassa and (1976-79) Bokassa I (b. Feb. 22, 1921, Bobangui, Middle Congo, French Equatorial Africa [now in Central African Republic] - d. Nov. 3, 1996, Bangui, Central African Republic), president of the Central African Republic (1966-76) and emperor of the Central African Empire (1976-79); nephew of Barthélemy Boganda. He joined the French army in 1939. He finished World War II a sergeant-major after landing with Gen. Charles de Gaulle's Free French forces in France. By 1961 he had achieved the rank of captain. At the request of Pres. David Dacko, he left the French armed forces to head the army of the newly independent Central African Republic. He used this position to overthrow Dacko (Jan. 1, 1966) and declare himself president. He also was minister of defense (1966-76), interior (1966-68, 1969-70), justice (1966-67, 1968-70), information (1968-71, 1976), agriculture and stockbreeding (1970-74), public health and population (1970-76), civil and military aviation (1971-76), civil service (1973-76), land, river, and air transport (1973-76), mines (1973-76), trade and industry (1973-74, 1976), and posts and telecommunications (1976) and was declared president for life in 1972. Known for his autocratic and unpredictable policies, he declared himself emperor in 1976; emulating his hero Napoléon I, he crowned himself in a lavish ceremony in 1977 that cost more than $20 million. Following the substantiation of international charges that Bokassa had personally participated in a massacre of 100 schoolchildren by his Imperial Guard, French paratroops carried out a coup against him that reestablished the republic and reinstated Dacko as president (September 1979). Bokassa went into exile, first traveling to Ivory Coast but later settling in France. He was sentenced to death in absentia in 1980, but he inexplicably chose to return to the C.A.R. in 1986. He was arrested and put on trial and in 1987 was found guilty of the murders of the schoolchildren and other crimes (although he was acquitted of charges of cannibalism). His death sentence was subsequently commuted to a 20-year jail term, and he was freed in September 1993.\n\nBokassa, Jean-Serge (b. Feb. 25, 1972, Bangui, Central African Republic), Central African Republic politician; son of Jean-Bédel Bokassa.

May 31, 1935, Opunake, North Island, New Zealand), prime minister of New Zealand (1990-97). He won election to parliament for the National Party from 1972, holding the King Country seat for nine elections. After standing for three years in opposition to the Labour government, he was appointed undersecretary both for agriculture and fisheries and for Maori affairs by the new National Party prime minister, Robert Muldoon, in 1975. As labour minister from 1978, he championed a bold assault on compulsory unionism. He made unsuccessful challenges for the posts of deputy leader in 1981 and leader in 1984 before replacing Jim McLay as party leader in March 1986. He failed to upset David Lange in the August 1987 elections, but the National Party won the Oct. 27, 1990, elections by a landslide. He offered his old mentor Muldoon the post of minister of state outside the cabinet, but Muldoon declined anything less than a cabinet post. Bolger started to implement far-reaching changes in economic and social policies and pursued an outward-looking foreign policy to strengthen New Zealand's relationships with other countries, especially in the Asia-Pacific region. He represented New Zealand at each of the five Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) leaders' summits since 1993. In the November 1993 election the National Party was once again returned to government. Following the 1996 elections, he entered into a coalition with the New Zealand First Party. He resigned in November 1997 and was then appointed minister of state and associate minister of foreign affairs and trade (with special responsibility for APEC).

He was created Viscount Bolingbroke and Baron St. John in 1712.\n\nBolívar\n\nBolívar (y Palacios), Simón (José Antonio de la Santísima Trinidad), byname The Liberator, Spanish El Libertador (b. July 24, 1783, Caracas - d. Dec. 17, 1830, near Santa Marta, Colombia), South American revolutionary leader. The Latin-American independence movement was launched in 1808, and he participated in many conspiratorial meetings. In 1810 the Spanish governor of Venezuela was expelled and a junta took over. Venezuela's independence was declared on July 5, 1811, but an armistice (July 1812) left the entire country to the mercy of Spain. In a sweeping hard-fought campaign Bolívar vanquished the Spaniards and regained control of the capital. On Aug. 6, 1813, he entered Caracas and assumed power. But the war of independence was just beginning. In 1814 he was once more defeated by the Spanish. By 1815 Spain had sent to its seditious colonies the strongest expeditionary force that had ever crossed the Atlantic. Three years of indecisive defeats and victories followed. In the spring of 1819 he conceived his master plan of attacking the Spanish viceroyalty of New Granada. The Spaniards were taken by surprise, and in the crucial Battle of Boyacá on Aug. 7, 1819, the bulk of the royalist army surrendered to him. Three days later he entered Bogotá. Indefatigably he set out to complete his task. By 1822 the territory of Gran Colombia, comprising what is now Colombia, Venezuela, and Ecuador, had been completely recovered from Spain. Only Peru remained in Spanish hands, but on Dec. 9, 1824, the Spanish viceroy surrendered with his entire army. Only a small section of the continent - Upper Peru - was defended by royalist forces until April 1825. The new nation chose to be called Bolivia after the name of the Liberator.\n\nBoljkovac, Josip (b. Nov. 12, 1920, Vukova Gorica, Croatia - d. Nov. 10, 2014, Karlovac, Croatia), interior minister of Croatia (1990-91).\n\nBolkestein, Frits, byname of Frederik Bolkestein (b.

He was also leader of the People's Party for Freedom and Democracy (1990-98), president of the Liberal International (1996-99), and EU commissioner for internal market (1999-2004).\n\nJefri Bolkiah\n\nBolkiah, Pengiran Muda Jefri (b. Nov. 6, 1954), Brunei politician. Sultan Sir Hassanal Bolkiah's youngest brother, he served as minister of youth, sports, and culture (1984-86) and finance (1986-97). He has been the target of scathing criticism at home and abroad, accused of bankrupting one of the sultanate's biggest firms amid reports of billions of dollars of losses. His many critics say his empire collapsed under debt and he is on the run in Europe or the United States, afraid to face the consequences of returning home where he is under investigation. Associates familiar with Prince Jefri's worldwide business holdings said his conglomerate, Amedeo, had been unfairly seized and his interests elsewhere were faring well. They said Muslim conservatives in the palace who oppose opening up one of the world's last remaining absolute monarchies to Western influence took advantage of publicity from two court cases which tarnished Prince Jefri's reputation to force the palace to move against him. Jefri was acquitted in the first case, brought by a former Miss USA beauty queen who claimed she had been kept as a sex slave in the sultan's palace. He settled the second case over a $130 million commercial dispute out of court. But the cases appeared to paint the portrait of a prodigal prince with lavish spending habits out of tune with Asia's economic downturn. His extravagant lifestyle - he reputedly owns 2,000 cars and 17 aircraft, and owns a yacht called Tits, with tenders Nipple I and Nipple II - has long been an embarrassment to the royal family. He was sacked as Brunei Investment Agency chairman in 1998. He has not been in Brunei since April 1998. In February 2000 the Brunei government sued him over alleged misuse of state funds and froze his assets at home and abroad.\n\nMohamed Bolkiah\n\nBolkiah, Pengiran Muda Mohamed (b. Aug. 27, 1947, Bandar Seri Begawan, Brunei), foreign minister of Brunei (1984-2015); brother of Sir Hassanal Bolkiah.\n\nHassanal Bolkiah\n\nBolkiah Mu`izzadin Waddaulah, Sir Hassanal (b. July 15, 1946, Bandar Seri Begawan, Brunei), sultan (1967- ), prime minister (1984- ), and foreign minister (2015- ) of Brunei. The eldest son of Sultan Sir Omar Ali Saifuddin, he was named crown prince and heir apparent by his father in 1961. In 1967 he became sultan when Sir Omar abdicated; his coronation took place Aug. 1, 1968. For the next decade, the father remained the power behind the throne as the young ruler (who was knighted in 1972) occupied himself less with affairs of state than with polo, fast cars, and pleasure trips overseas, predilections that raised eyebrows in conservative circles. However, after the death of his influential mother in 1979, his father withdrew into the background and the sultan quickly took a dominant role in Brunei's administration. He made frequent trips into the kampongs (villages) to listen to his subjects as well as to fortify his own image as their ruler. In preparation for political independence, he initiated priority programs aimed at creating a viable bureaucracy, phasing out British expatriates in the civil service and replacing them with capable Bruneians, and cracking down on corruption. After 95 years as a British protectorate, Brunei achieved independence on Jan. 1, 1984. Though he expressed a wish for continued friendly relations with Britain, there were some bumps. He wanted to keep Britain's 900-strong Gurkha force in Brunei under his control after independence, but London was hesitant. After inconclusive talks, Brunei transferred the management of its massive investment portfolio from Britain's crown agents to the independent Brunei Investment Agency under U.S. advice. By September 1983, word was out that London would permit one battalion of Gurkhas to stay on under British control in Brunei for an unspecified period.\n\nBolla, Fulvio (b.

A congressman from 1991, he was seen as offensive but irrelevant until 2018, when he took the playbook of Rodrigo Duterte or Donald Trump to the extreme, running for president on an ultra-right platform. He was known for engaging in misogynist, homophobic, and anti-indigenous bigotry and for praising the 1964-85 military dictatorship. When Pres. Dilma Rousseff of the Workers' Party (PT), who had been tortured during the dictatorship, was forced from office in a dubious impeachment process in 2016, Bolsonaro viciously dedicated his vote to the memory of the most notorious torturer. At one point he said: \"You won't change anything in this country through voting... you'll only change things by having a civil war and doing the work the military regime didn't do. Killing 30,000, starting with FHC [former president Fernando Henrique Cardoso]. Killing. If a few innocent people die, that's alright.\" The military, wealthy farmers and businesspeople, the socially conservative, and evangelical churches threw their weight behind him. As the PT's hugely popular Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva was not allowed to stand due to a corruption sentence, Bolsonaro's main opponent in the 2018 election was Lula's last-minute stand-in Fernando Haddad, who was much less known and less charismatic. Bolsonaro led Haddad 46%-29% in the first round, then defeated him in the runoff 55%-45%. As president he continued to act as an anti-socialist culture warrior, aligning with like-minded leaders like Trump or Hungary's Viktor Orbán, while relations with other countries cooled. During the COVID-19 pandemic he let the virus spread in a failed bid to achieve herd immunity, a policy which a congressional panel in 2021 blamed for the deaths of more than 300,000 Brazilians. Nearing the 2022 election, he beefed up aid programs to the poor, a group inclined to vote PT. But Lula was able to run that year; he first led Bolsonaro 48%-43%, then won the runoff 51%-49%. Bolsonaro initially refused to accept the result, but left office on Jan. 1, 2023. On January 8, almost repeating the events at the U.S. Capitol two years before, his supporters stormed the federal buildings in Brasília, but ultimately to no effect. In July 2023 he was barred from running for office again until 2030 due to having used government communication channels to promote his campaign and having cast unfounded doubts on the country's electronic voting system. In 2024 it emerged that he had planned a coup after his loss in 2022, but military leaders refused to go along.\n\nBolton, Charles Paulet, (2nd) Duke of, also known as (1675-89) Earl of Wiltshire and (1689-99) Marquess of Winchester (b. 1661 - d.

He was first elected to the Newfoundland House of Assembly in the general election of that year as the protégé of Prime Minister Sir William Whiteway. Within two years Bond was speaker of the House of Assembly but held the position for only one year. In the 1885 general election the Liberal Party was defeated, but in 1889 it returned as the majority party. Whiteway became prime minister and Bond entered the Executive Council (cabinet) as colonial secretary. The Liberal Party lost the 1897 election. Whiteway retired from politics and Bond succeeded him as Liberal leader and became leader of the opposition. In a vote of confidence in 1900 the Conservative administration was defeated. Bond was asked to form a new administration and became premier. A general election was held on Nov. 8, 1900, and the Liberal Party was returned with 32 of the 36 seats in the House of Assembly, the largest majority ever attained up to that time. In the election of Oct. 31, 1904, Bond scored another impressive victory. The Liberals won 30 seats. The next election was held Nov. 2, 1908, and produced a constitutional crisis when Bond's Liberal Party and the People's Party both won 18 seats. Bond finally resigned on Feb. 22, 1909. In new elections on May 8, 1909, the People's Party won 26 seats and the Liberal Party 10. Bond became leader of the opposition once again. He continued in that position for the next four years.

A member of the Christian People's Party, he was minister of education and church affairs (1983-86), deputy prime minister (1985-86), and foreign minister (1989-90) and became prime minister in 1997. He went on sick leave on Aug. 30, 1998, after a \"depressive reaction\" to overwork. The causes of Bondevik's stress included a plunge in the price of oil to 10-year lows, a surge in interest rates, and a fall in the value of the krone in late August. Squabbling among Bondevik's minority three-party coalition, which controlled 42 of parliament's 165 seats, added to his woes. Bondevik twice extended his sick leave, originally scheduled to last a week, and finally returned September 24. In his second term he presided over four years of unprecedented prosperity fueled by high oil prices, but lost the 2005 elections to an alliance led by the Labour Party which campaigned on a pledge to spend more of the vast oil wealth on welfare programs, while Bondevik advocated further tax cuts.\n\nBondy, Pierre Marie Taillepied, comte de (b.

March 17, 1858, Tegucigalpa, Honduras - d. Sept. 11, 1926, New Orleans, La.), president of Honduras (1894-99). He emerged as the Liberal Party's heir apparent during Céleo Arias's failed bid for the presidency in 1887. Upon Arias's death in 1890, the Liberals chose Bonilla to be their candidate against the Progressive Party's nominee, Ponciano Leiva, in the 1891 elections. The Progressives stole the election, then harried the opposition Liberals into exile. From his Nicaraguan asylum, Bonilla invaded Honduras, unleashing that country's bloodiest civil war. Bonilla's forces, amply supported by Nicaraguan strongman José Santos Zelaya, managed to overthrow the government after more than two years' struggle. As diligent in office as he had been intransigent in the field, Bonilla rewrote the nation's constitution in 1894 to reflect his brand of doctrinaire liberalism, established in it the preeminence of the executive branch, and revamped public administration at every level. He firmly believed that disciplined political parties competing in honest electoral contests would cure much of what ailed Honduras, but he made little headway in persuading his fellow Hondurans to accept this. Bonilla continued his predecessors' efforts to foster development through mining and banana export, and he tried unsuccessfully to refund his country's enormous foreign debt. A lifelong \"unionist,\" Bonilla took the lead in a failed attempt to revive the Republic of Central America shortly before leaving office in 1899. In 1919 he represented Honduras at the Versailles peace conference after World War I. He unsuccessfully ran for president in 1923.\n\nBonino\n\nBonino, Emma (b.
