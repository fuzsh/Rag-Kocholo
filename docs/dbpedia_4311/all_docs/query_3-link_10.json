        "text": "FTLD manifests clinically with progressive behavioral and/or language deficits with a prevalence of 3.5-15/100,000 in 45 to 64 year olds2-5. The clinical presentation of cases with FTLD pathology varies depending on the referral base6 and among these cases, ~50% are diagnosed as FTLD-TDP1. A family history of a similar neurodegenerative disease may be present in up to 50% of FTLD cases, supporting the existence of a genetic predisposition7. Autosomal dominant GRN mutations occur in ~20% of FTLD-TDP cases8-11. GRN mutations are loss-of-function mutations with most resulting in premature termination of the mutant transcript invoking nonsense-mediated RNA decay and with the ensuing haploinsufficiency causing disease11,12. However, a substantial number of familial FTLD-TDP cases are not explained by GRN mutations. Further, patients with the same GRN mutation show variable clinical phenotypes or ages of disease onset which likely reflect additional genetic and environmental factors13.\n\nThe GWA phase of the study included 515 cases of FTLD-TDP and 2509 disease-free population controls genotyped on the Illumina HH550 or 610-Quad BeadChips as described14 ( ). A large population control cohort was acceptable since the general population incidence of FTLD is low4,5,15. Cases were obtained under institutional review board approval by members of the International FTLD Collaboration consisting of investigators from 45 clinical centers and brain banks representing 11 countries (United States, Canada, United Kingdom, The Netherlands, Belgium, Spain, Germany, Australia, Finland, France, and Sweden). All cases met either pathological (n=499) or genetic (n=16) criteria for FTLD-TDP which was confirmed by detecting TDP-43 inclusions using immunohistochemistry (IHC)1,16. A genetic criterion for inclusion (i.e. presence of a known pathogenic GRN mutation) was used since GRN mutation cases are always diagnosed as FTLD-TDP 8,9,17,18. All cases were checked for relatedness using identity by state (IBS). The results confirmed that although some GRN-associated FTLD-TDP cases share the same mutation on chromosome 17 with similarity in the immediate vicinity of GRN, they are no more related in the remainder of the genome than individuals without GRN mutations. Detailed inclusion criteria are provided in Methods; cohort features are in Supplementary Table 1.\n\nCochran-Armitage trend test statistics were calculated at all markers following quality control filtering. In addition to self-reported ancestry, all cases and controls were initially screened at ancestry informative markers (AIM) using the STRUCTURE software package19 to reduce the risk of population stratification from self-reported ancestry alone. Each case was subsequently matched to four controls by ‘genetic matching’ by smartPCA20 as previously described21. The genomic inflation factor (λ) for this study was 1.05 indicating that background stratification was minimal as demonstrated in the quantile-quantile (Q-Q) plots (Supplementary Fig. 1).\n\nThree SNPs reached genome-wide significance following Bonferroni correction ( ). All three SNPs (rs6966915, rs1020004, and rs1990622) mapped to a 68 kb interval (Supplementary Fig. 2) on 7p21.3 (top marker, rs1990622, minor allele frequency (MAF) 32.1% in cases and 43.6% in controls, OR = 0.61, [95% CI 0.53 – 0.71], P=1.08×10−11). For rs1990622, the more common (T) allele confers risk with an OR of 1.64 [95% CI 1.34-2.00]. The interval contained nine additional markers in strong LD (r2 >0.45) that were also associated with FTLD-TDP (P-value range = 8.9×10−3 - 7.5×10−7; OR range 0.63-0.77) ( ). All 12 associated SNPs map to a single LD block spanning TMEM106B, which encodes an uncharacterized transmembrane protein of 274 amino acids ( ). SNPs rs1020004 and rs6966915 lie within introns 3 and 5, respectively, of TMEM106B, while rs1990622 is 6.9 kb downstream of the gene. These findings argue strongly for the association of the 7p21 locus, and the gene TMEM106B, with FTLD-TDP.\n\nThe association with FTLD-TDP in the GWA was replicated by TaqMan SNP genotyping in 89 independent FTLD-TDP cases and 553 Caucasian control samples at two of the genome-wide significant SNPs (rs1020004 and rs1990622) ( and Supplementary Table 1). A polymorphic variation adjacent to rs6966915 interfered with interpretation of TaqMan genotyping therefore precluding its use in the replication. The replication set was selected based on the same pathological criteria and had similar characteristics as the GWA phase cohort (Supplementary Table 1). In this replication cohort, the top SNPs again showed significant association (P=0.004 for rs1020004 and P=0.0002 for rs1990622) with the same directions of association as those found in the GWA phase (Supplementary Table 1). These results suggest that in the 7p21 locus, encompassing the gene TMEM106B, we have identified a common genetic susceptibility factor for FTLD-TDP. Of interest, this association was not confirmed in a cohort of 192 living patients with unselected FTLD (Supplementary Table 2). This likely reflects heterogeneity in neuropathological substrates underlying FTLD, with only ~50% of unselected clinical FTLD cases expected to have FTLD-TDP. Assuming that TMEM106B genetic variants confer risk of FTLD-TDP specifically, the power to detect this association in 192 clinical FTLD cases and 553 controls is ~30% for an alpha-value of 0.05. To have >90% power to detect this association, a clinical FTLD cohort would require more than 1400 clinical FTLD cases and an equal number of controls.\n\nWe next evaluated TMEM106B gene expression in different human tissues to identify phenotype-associated differential expression and also any potential genetic regulators of expression. We queried the mRNA-by-SNP browser (http://www.sph.umich.edu/csg/liang/asthma/, last accessed June 6, 2009), for genetic regulators of TMEM106B expression (eSNPs) in lymphoblastoid cell lines22. The top SNP, rs1990622, was significantly correlated with TMEM106B average expression levels (LOD 6.32; P=6.9×10−8), as was SNP rs1020004 (LOD 5.16, P=1.10×10−6). The risk allele (T) of rs1990622 was associated with a higher level of mRNA expression, indicating that TMEM106B may be under cis-acting regulation by either the FTLD-TDP associated SNPs or another SNP(s) in LD with the associated variants. As the expression data in the publicly available database is derived from lymphoblastoid cell lines from normal individuals22, and the diseased organ in FTLD-TDP is brain, we asked if a similar correlation between genotype and expression phenotype for TMEM106B is also present in tissue types affected by disease, and in diseased individuals themselves. Accordingly, we used total RNA isolated from FTLD-TDP postmortem brains (n=18) and neurologically normal control brains (n=7) to evaluate TMEM106B expression in frontal cortex, which is severely affected in FTLD-TDP, by quantitative reverse-transcription PCR (QRT-PCR). All RNA samples used were confirmed to be of equivalent high quality as described23 (Supplementary Table 3). For the same individuals for which we obtained expression data, we genotyped SNPs rs1020004 and rs1990622 using allelic discrimination assays.\n\nCorroborating results from the cell lines, expression of TMEM106B was significantly correlated with TMEM106B genotype, with risk allele carriers showing higher expression (overall P=0.027, TT vs. TC P=0.017, TT vs. CC P=0.03, for rs1990622, and Supplementary Fig. 3a). Strikingly, however, expression of TMEM106B was >2.5 times higher in FTLD-TDP cases compared to normal controls (P=0.045, ). In addition, the effects of genotype and TMEM106B expression on risk of developing disease are at least partly independent, as are the effects of genotype and disease status on TMEM106B expression (Supplementary Table 4a and b). Thus, these data suggest that increased TMEM106B brain expression might be linked to mechanisms of disease in FTLD-TDP, and that risk alleles at TMEM106B confer genetic susceptibility by increasing gene expression.\n\nThe primary criterion for inclusion in the GWAS was a neuropathological diagnosis of FTLD-TDP; therefore we studied all cases together regardless of GRN mutation status. Nevertheless, a priori it was difficult to predict whether additional genetic susceptibility loci would be identified in a group with Mendelian inheritance of highly penetrant mutations. We therefore separately evaluated FTLD-TDP cases with (n=89) and without (n=426) GRN mutations. Association to the 7p21 locus persisted in both the GRN negative and positive clusters and there was no significant heterogeneity in the ORs for the disease/SNP association between the clusters ( and Supplementary Tables 2 and 5). Using family history status as a covariate in a logistic regression showed that the 7p21 association is independent of family history (Supplementary Table 6). Thus, TMEM106B variants may act as a modifier locus in the presence of GRN mutations, as the APOE locus has been shown to modify age of onset in patients with PSEN124 or PSEN225 mutations.\n\nAdditionally, in the whole GWA cohort, we observed a correlation between rs1020004 genotype and disease duration (P=0.03) with homozygotes for the risk allele (AA, wild-type) having shorter duration of disease (i.e. more severe disease) than individuals homozygous for the minor allele (GG, Supplementary Figure 4). These results provide strong confirmatory evidence for association of the 7p21 locus with increased risk for FTLD-TDP in both GRN positive and negative cases.\n\nIn addition to the 7p21 locus, analysis of the GRN cases alone showed highly significant association with SNPs near the GRN locus on 17q21 ( and Supplementary Table 7). Not unexpectedly, haplotype analysis of the cases indicated that the chromosome 17 association was driven by a shared haplotype among the p.R493X ({\"type\":\"entrez-nucleotide\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"NM_002087.2\",\"term_id\":\"60498993\",\"term_text\":\"NM_002087.2\"}}NM_002087.2:c.1477C>T) mutation carriers which represented 20.2% (18/89) of the GRN mutation cases. To determine if the observed association at the GRN locus was dependent on the association at the TMEM106B locus we carried out a logistic regression analysis conditioning on the most significantly associated SNP at the 7p21 locus, rs1990622, in the patients with GRN mutations. The conditional analysis had no effect on the association at the GRN locus suggesting that the associations with 17q21 and 7p21 are independent. IBS analysis confirms that these individuals are unrelated and therefore the identified association on chromosome 7 cannot be discounted in GRN mutation carriers. Indeed, conditioning on the top SNP at the GRN locus, rs8079488, also had no effect on the TMEM106B association (results not shown). In addition to the 7p21 locus, the GWAS of GRN negative cases showed a trend for association at five other loci (Supplementary Table 8) including a locus on chromosome 9p21.2 that falls within a 7.7 Mb critical interval defined from five previous linkage studies, representing a potential refinement of that region26. We observed no association at the GRN locus in the cases without GRN mutations.\n\nWe then evaluated mRNA expression of TMEM106B in FTLD-TDP with and without GRN mutations separately, and the GRN mutants showed increased expression (overall P=0.0009), compared to controls (P=0.0005) and FTLD-TDP without GRN mutations (P=0.002) ( ). Furthermore, controlling for rs1990622 genotype and focusing on heterozygotes (n=14), the presence of a GRN mutation remained significantly associated with increased TMEM106B expression (P=0.039, ) compared to normal controls. These results are compatible with a model in which mutations in GRN are upstream of increased TMEM106B expression in increasing risk for FTLD-TDP.\n\nA mechanistic understanding of the pathogenesis of FTLD has been hampered the heterogeneity in clinical and pathological features. With the discovery of TDP-43 as a major FTLD disease protein, the pathologically-defined entity of FTLD-TDP emerged16. Identification of GRN mutations as a major genetic cause of FTLD-TDP, led to definition of a genetic subgroup of FTLD-TDP. This study identifies TMEM106B as a genetic risk factor for FTLD-TDP. We speculate that the homogeneous pathologically-defined study population used here enabled us to detect a robust signal with relatively small case numbers.\n\nOur data suggest a potential disease mechanism in which risk-associated polymorphisms at 7p21 increase TMEM106B expression, and elevated TMEM106B expression increases risk for FTLD-TDP. Additionally, we show that TMEM106B genotypes are a significant risk factor for FTLD-TDP even in GRN mutation carriers implying that GRN mutations may act upstream of TMEM106B in a pathogenic cascade. Future directions of research on this novel genetic risk factor will include a detailed evaluation of the TMEM106B locus by sequencing, collection of more pathologically-defined FTLD-TDP cases for a genome-wide replication, and studies of expression profiles in additional tissues and brain regions. A better understanding of this gene may in turn provide an opportunity to intervene in an otherwise fatal and devastating neurodegenerative disease."
