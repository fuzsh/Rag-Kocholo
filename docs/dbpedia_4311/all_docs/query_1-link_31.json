        "text": "With some delay, the jubilee, 10th issue of the magazine Modern Conservation, published by the National Committee of ICOMOS Serbia, came out of print. The publication was realized with the funds of the Ministry of Culture of the Republic of Serbia.\n\nThis is also an issue dedicated to the long-time president and author of the magazine's concept, Branka Å ekariÄ. That is why this time there was no interview with a famous personality from the world of heritage protection, and instead of the interview, the biography of Branka Å ekariÄ, one of the most significant names in the field of conservation theory in Serbia and the region, was published. Many experts of the international ICOMOS dedicated their work to their respected colleague, while numerous younger researchers showed their knowledge and skills that were acquired precisely thanks to Branka's texts and translations of the works of today's greatest professionals with whom she had the honor to work.\n\nAs a whole, the magazine has remained unchanged for the time being, and the papers - apart from the sections - can be divided into those related to the celebration of the 50th anniversary of the creation of the Convention on the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage, but also to laws in general, through of the most current issues of heritage management, especially the one that represents the biggest challenge in understanding and presentation: archaeological and vernacular.\n\nArt Historian. Worked in the Institute for the Protection of Cultural Heritage of Serbia (1986-2016). Engaged for the heritage of the last two decades: research, protection and valorisation of the urban architectual heritage, both individual monuments and cultural-historical areas. She was especially focused on the enhancement of the methodology of urban conservation: concept of the integrative conservation, historical city, cultural landscape and historical urban landscape, management, as well as on history and theory of conservation. Professional training: Istituto Centrale per il Restauro (Roma 1990); ICCROM (Second International Workshop on Integrated Territorial and Urban Conservation - ITUC 99, Roma 1999); FOR-MED âNuove tecnologie per la valorizzazione e la gestione del patrimonio culturale Mediterraneoâ (Ravello 2002/2003); Istituto Centrale per il Catalogo e la Documentazione (Roma 2003). She published more than 70 papers in Serbian and international professional publications. She translated Cesare Brandi's Theory of Restauration (2007) and many papers written by international experts for Serbian professional journals, as Glasnik DruÅ¡tva konzervatora Srbije (Courier of the Society of Conservators of Serbia) and Modern Conservation (she was editor in both journals). She was the President of the National Committee ICOMOS Serbia since 2010.\n\nAt the Ethnographic Museum in Belgrade on May 28, 2019, the regular Annual Assembly of the National Committee ICOMOS Serbia was held. At the Assembly, reports on the work of the National Committee and the Financial Report were submitted, which were unanimously adopted. President Branka Å ekariÄ also presented the Program Guidelines for the forthcoming period in which she advocates the continuity of activities on promoting and improving the quality of the conservation profession, both in Serbia and in the region. In addition to the magazine \"Modern Conservation\", financially supported by the Ministry of Culture and Information, all activities of the National Committee are based on the volunteer work of a smaller number of interested members, as well as on the understanding of certain institutions, such as the Ethnographic Museum in Belgrade and the Faculty of Architecture at the Belgrade University.\n\nThis year, the International Day of Monuments and Sites has been dedicated to \"Rural Landscapes\". The National Committee of ICOMOS Serbia marked this date by visiting the BebiÄa Luka, the hamlet of the village of VujnovaÄa, a unique rural entity in Serbia. It began to develop in the middle of the 19th century as an isolated group of objects of vernacular architecture, belonging to the BebiÄ family, of which only a few houses are inhabited today. The hamlet is located next to the river with a little fertile soil, surrounded by woods that served as a source of the existence of the locals. BebiÄa Luka has been established for a spatial cultural and historical unit but its preservation is a major problem due to the outflow of the population to the cities.\n\nA few kilometers from there, also in the gorge of the Jablanica River, there is a monastery of Pustinja built on the transition from the 16th to the 17th century, which also testifies to the centuries-old inhabitation of this region.\n\nAt the end of 2018, the sixth issue of \"Modern Conservation\" was printed. Financing was provided by the Ministry of Culture and Information of the Republic of Serbia. The publisher, the National Committee of ICOMOS Serbia, has made an effort again to gather authors from the field of cultural heritage protection and to show various aspects of the action in matter: from theoretical considerations and attitudes towards conservation, through cases from practice to acquaintance with new international documents, as well as publications and meetings that marked the previous year. Interview with Boguslav Å migin, printed bilingual due to the international popularity of this section, gives a glimpse of the protection from the corners of the country that after the Second World War was forced to fully reconstruct manz cities' quarters.\n\nOn the occasion of the European Year of Cultural Heritage 2018, the National Committee of ICOMOS Serbia organized a round table discussion entitled \"The State of Heritage in Serbia in the Context of Preserving European Heritage\", December 10, 2018 at the Faculty of Architecture in Belgrade.\n\nModerator of the discussion, Rade MrljeÅ¡, pointed to one of the successful protection projects, Â Pavilion of Prince MiloÅ¡ at the BukoviÄka Spa, that in 2018 was the winner of one of the European Union's cultural heritage awards. This case initiated a discussion about the condition of other spa facilities in Serbia, which are mostly in a very poor condition, and then other cultural monuments in Belgrade and Serbia. Large investment projects and conflicts of different interests have been identified as the main culprits of the impossibility to implement a deliberate and consistent policy of protection.\n\n19th General Assembly in New Delhi, ICOMOS Advisory Committee and Scientific Symposium \"Heritage and Democracy\" were held 11-15 December 2017, in New Delhi, India. Representatives of 65 national committees, approximatelyÂ 1000 participants and guests from 113 countries attended the Assembly. The new ICOMOS Board has been elected for the period 2017 - 2020: PresidentÂ Mr Toshiyuki Kono (Japan), Secretary General Mr Peter Phillips (Australia) and MsÂ Laura Robinson (South Africa) who was elected again as Treasurer General. Vice Presidents are: Mr Leonardo Castriota (Brazil), Mr Alpha Diop (Mali), Mr Rohit Jigyasu (India), Mr Grellan Rourke (Ireland) and Mr Mario Santana Quintero (Canada). The members of the Board are: Mr Nils Ahlberg (Sweden), Ms Riin Alatalu (Estonia), Ms Adriana Careaga (Uruguay), Ms Zeynep GÃ¼l Ãnal (Turkey), Ms Suk Young Han (Korea), Ms Pamela Jerome (USA), Mr Jiang Bo (China), Ms Elena Korka (Greece), Ms Teresa Patricio (Belgium), Ms Clara Rellensmann (Germany), Mr Jean-Christophe Simon (France) and Ms Hatthaya Siriphatthanakun (Thailand). The President of the Advisory Committee is stillÂ Ms Sheridan Burke (Australia), the coordinator of the Scientific Council isÂ Mr James ReapÂ (USA) and the Honorary Presidents areÂ Mr Gustavo Araoz (USA), Mr Michael Petzet (Germany) and Mr Roland Silva (Sri Lanka)\n\nScientific Symposium was titled \"Heritage and Democracy\" and several doctrinal texts were adopted: ICOMOS-IFLA Principles Concerning Rural Landscapes as Heritage, ICOMOS-IFLA Document on Historic Urban Public Parks, SALALAH Guidelines for the Management of Public Archaeological Sites, Principles for the Conservation of Wooden Built Heritage, as well as the final document of the scientific symposium, Delhi Declaration on Heritage and Democracy.\n\nThe jubilee, fifth edition of \"Modern Conservation\" came out of the press in late December, thanks to the continued funding from the Ministry of Culture and Information of the Republic of Serbia, and was published by the National Committee ICOMOS Serbia.\n\nThis year, the magazine covers the works of the authors, mainly ICOMOS members, from the country and abroad, who provide the latest breakthroughs from practice, as well as from the history, theory and philosophy of conservation. The interview with Professor Wilfried Lipp, President of the National Committee ICOMOS Austria and Vice-President of the ICOMOS European Group (2008-2011), brings an innovation â at the request of a large number of Modern Conservation readers, this year's interview was printed both in Serbian and English.\n\nImprovement of knowledge and the ethics-based practice is still the main goal of the editor of the magazine, as can be seen in the selection of papers â covering almost all areas of today's understanding of the cultural heritage concept â and in the selection of international documents that have contributed to the development and understanding of this concept.\n\nSince United Nations has designated 2017 as the International Year of Sustainable Tourism for Development, ICOMOS proposed \"Cultural Heritage & Sustainable Tourism\" as the theme for this year's celebration of the April 18th. National Committee ICOMOS Serbia, in cooperation with the Smederevo Museum and the Regional Institute for the Protection of Cultural Monumments in Smederevo, dedicated this day to the Smederevo Fortress (15th century), the cultural property on the WH Tentative List of the Republic of Serbia. After two-hour expert tour of the fortress (guided by Dejan RadovanoviÄ, archaeologist) and the presentation of the level of research, state of conservation and the treatment of the fortress in the strategic plans of the city of Smederevo, the Round Table \"Smederevo Fortress and Sustainable Tourism for Development of the City\" was held. The members of NC ICOMOS Serbia, professionals from the cultural heritage protection field, citizens and representatives of the local community's institutions participated in an interactive discussion, moderated by SneÅ¾ana JejiÄ, architect, member of the NC ICOMOS Serbia.\n\nIt was focused on the basic issues concerning the use of this monumental complex in relation to the risks and constraints caused by further research and conservation as well as the potentials and possibilities of using the fortress as the touristic resource which would contribute to the social, cultural and economic benefit of the local community and vice versa to the preservation and better maintenance of the cultural heritage. It was concluded that it is necessary to start the development of the management plan that would enable greater integration of other Smederevo's cultural and natural values, the affirmation of the touristic potentials of the city and its connecting with the reference points of the European cultural routes with the Danube as their spatial backbone.\n\nRegular Electorial Assembly of the National Committee ICOMOS Serbia was held on February 3rd 2017, in the cinema hall of the Ethnographic Museum in Belgrade.\n\nMs Branka Å ekariÄ, President of the National Committee ICOMOS Serbia, submitted the triennial report on the work of the National Committee for the period January 2014 - January 2017, while the financial report for 2016 was presented by Mr Miladin LukiÄ, on behalf of the Supervisory Board. Both documents were unanimously adopted.\n\nOn the proposal of the Executive Board, the President and the Supervisory Board in the current composition were re-elected and four members of the Executive Board, who were no longer able to perform the tasks in the authority of this Board due to various reasons, have been replaced by new members, all by secret ballot. President Ms Branka Å ekariÄ presented the program guidelines for the next three-year period that were adopted by the Assembly as well. As in previous years, she expressed her gratitude to the Ethnographic Museum in Belgrade and the Faculty of Architecture, University of Belgrade, for the understanding and support they have been providing for the National Committee.\n\n* * *\n\nThe theme of this year's celebration of the April 18th - International Day of Monuments and Sites - was The Heritage of Sport. On this occasion, on April 18th 2016, the National Committee ICOMOS Serbia, in cooperation with the Museum of Yugoslav History (www.mij.rs), organized an expert tour of the exhibition \"To Be a Falcon Is to Be a Yugoslav\", dedicated to the so called Sokol (the falcon) Association, that had been aimed to promote gymnastic physical exercises and moral values among Slavic nations. The tour was guided by the author of the project, Ms. Veselinka KastratoviÄ RistiÄ, and the co-authors of the exhibition Ms. Jovana KarauliÄ and Ms. Vladana Putnik. Thereafter, the Round table \"The Architecture of the Falcons' Centers - Conservation and Presentation\" was held, moderated by Mr. Nenad LajbenÅ¡perger, historian, member of NC ICOMOS Serbia. Starting from the observation that in Serbia the heritage of sport relate mostly to the architecture of the second half of the 19th and the 20th century, the discussion was focused on the conservation of the Falcons' Centers as well as other sports facilities characteristic for the period after the Second World War. The emphasis was on the valorization of this type of heritage in relation to their architectural values ââand/or historical significance, the scope of conservation interventions allowed in those facilities which are still in their primary function, as well as the reasons for their devastation in the mid-20th century, but also in the transition period during the last decade and a half. It was concluded that this April 18th, just like the previous ones, drew attention to the specific category of heritage, with the basic idea to increase knowledge about the topic that is in the focus of the manifestation and to hasten the work on its evaluation and obtaining the legal status, all in order to enable the proper protection and presentation.\n\nExhibition To Be a Falcon Is To Be a Yugoslav\n\nOn Thursday, April 16th 2015, the National Committee ICOMOS Serbia celebrated the International Day on Monuments and Sites (18 April) by organizing the round table \"50th Anniversary of ICOMOS: Importance of International Cooperation for the Conservation of National Heritage\". On behalf of the Faculty of Architecture where the round table was held, the participants were welcomed by the professor Mirjana Roter BlagojeviÄ, PhD. The President of ICOMOS Serbia, Mrs. Branka Å ekariÄ gave the introductory lecture on the importance of this jubilee, the concept of internationalism in the field of conservation and the history of ICOMOS, from 1965 till today. She initiated the discussion on the significance of the international cooperation for the preservation of the heritage at the national level. The importance of the ICOMOS was pointed out as it is the unique non-governmental organization of this type at the global level. It has been developing the activities in the field of conservation and preservation of monuments and sites and is committed to the enhancement of knowledge and raising the level of professionalism among its members for five decades. In the discussion that followed the importance of the continuity with ICOMOS International was underlined, the continuity that lasts even from the time of ex-Yugoslavia, who was among the founders of ICOMOS. The need to enhance the acquaintance of today experts in conservation with the work of ICOMOS and its goals was also accentuated, as well as with the results of international practice in general. In this regard it was noted that the National Committee ICOMOS Serbia has been remarkably contributing to the awareness of the significance of the international cooperation for the protection of own heritage, in particular since the launch of the journal Modern Conservation (2013).\n\nOn the occasion of 50th anniversary of ICOMOS and 18 April - International Day of Monuments and Sites, the exhibition of MA students' works \"From Classicism to Art Nouveau - stylistic transformation of architecture in Serbia during the 19th and early 20th century in Serbia\" was organized by the Faculty of Architecture.\n\nAnnual General Assembly of the National Committee ICOMOS Serbia was held on January 26th 2015, in the auditory of the Ethnographic Museum in Belgrade. The president of the National Committee ICOMOS Serbia, Ms Branka Å ekariÄ submitted a report on the activities of the National Committee for the period January 2014 - January 2015, as well as the program for the forthcoming period until the next Assembly. On behalf of the Supervising Board, Mr Miladin Luki\n\npresented a financial report for the period November 2013 - December 2014, which, like the previous two documents, was adopted unanimously.\n\nAt the end of the session, the second issue of \"Modern Conservationâ was promoted.\n\n* * *\n\n2014\n\nThis year the celebration of April 18th - International Day on Monuments and Sites took place on April 23rd due to the Easter holidays. In accordance with the recommendation of ICOMOS Executive Committee to dedicate the year 2014 to the \"Heritage of Commemoration\", inter alia because of the centenary of the outbreak of the First World War, National Committee ICOMOS Serbia organized a visit to the complex of cemeteries in Roosevelt Str. in Belgrade: New Cemetery, Jewish Cemetery and The Cemetery of the Liberators of Belgrade. Particular interest was aroused by visiting the military cemeteries of French and Italian soldiers from the First World War, as well as the admittance in the recently restored Ossuary of the Defenders of Belgrade from 1914 to 1918. Further, the tour included the Graveyard of Eminent Citizens, Cemetery of the victims from the World War II, Graveyard of Meritorious Citizens, Russian Ossuary from 1934, Austro-Hungarian cemetery, as well as some of the monuments to the prominent personalities from Serbian history that are beyond the aforementioned graveyards.\n\nTour of Sephardic Jewish cemetery began in front of the monument to the soldiers who were killed \"in past wars for salvation, freedom and unification of the Fatherland (1912-1919)\", and continued by the main path, to the monument to the Jewish victims of fascism, a monumental sculptural work by architect Bogdan BogdanoviÄ. Celebration of the International Day on Monuments and Sites was completed by a visit to the Cemetery of the Liberators of Belgrade and the Round table held in the homonymous school, when heritage of commemoration, its protection and particularities were discussed. Mr Nenad LajbenÅ¡perger, historian, a member of the National Committee ICOMOS Serbia was the author of the program for this year's event and the moderator of the Round Table.\n\n* * *\n\n2013\n\nAssembly of the National Committee ICOMOS SerbiaÂ was held on December 16th 2013, in the auditory of the Ethnographic Museum in Belgrade, Serbia.\n\nMs Branka Å ekariÄ, the president on the National Committee ICOMOS Serbia, reported to the Assembly on the activities of the National Committee during the period from May 2012 to December 2013, while the financial report was, on behalf of the Supervising Board, presented by Ms Svetlana BakiÄ. Both documents were unanimously adopted.\n\nThe Assembly was meant to be an electoral one, but due to lackÂ of quorumÂ and in accordance with Article 26 of the Statute of the National Committee of ICOMOS Serbia, the agenda items relating to the election of the President, the Executive and Supervising Boards and to the plan for the next period, were delayed for a month. So the continuation of the Assembly session was held on January 17th 2014.\n\nThanks to the efforts and achievements in the previous mandate, hitherto president and members of the Executive and Supervising Boards were re-elected. The President Branka Å ekariÄ presented the program guidelines for the next three years.\n\nAt the Faculty of Architecture in Belgrade, on November 22nd, 2013, a round table on \"Actuality of Brandiâs Theoretical Thought\" was organized in order to mark the 50th anniversary of the publication of Cesare Brandiâs \"Theory of Restoration\". The long and inspiring discussion was attended by the guests from the region and members of the National Committee ICOMOS Serbia. The general conclusion is that the Brandi's theoretical thought is present in contemporary conservation more than we are aware, not only because it is a fundamental part in the matter of restoration/conservation and anthological synthesis whose theoretical model is widely accepted in all milieus that are seriously considering the preservation of heritage, but also because of the influence of the Brandiâs theoretical model to the creation of a number of international documents.\n\nThis year the ICOMOS Executive Committee proposed the theme âHeritage of Educationâ to mark April 18th - International Day on Monuments and Sites. In accordance with the recommendation, the National Committee ICOMOS Serbia organized a Round table entitled âEducation and Architectural Heritageâ. The Round table was held on Thursday, April 18th 2013, in the building of the Faculty of Engineering of the University of Belgrade, a cultural property built from 1925 to 1931, according to the project of the architects Nikola Nestorovic and Branko Tanazevic. It is the first building specially designed for engineering faculties in Serbia.\n\nDuring the discussion, which was attended by many members of the National Committee ICOMOS Serbia, the enormous importance of intangible tradition of the knowledge transition - as a part of the whole process of education of individuals, various groups of population and experts - was confirmed. The importance of the interaction between educational and professional institutions and individuals in the heritage protection field was also highlighted, and especially the âeducation of educatorsâ.\n\nThe fact that the cultural heritage can be preserved only if it is recognized, understood and accepted as the basic element of identity of individuals and community, must be the main idea in each educational process directed to an integrative approach to research the possibilities of rehabilitation and improvement of natural and architectural heritage.\n\nModerators of the Round table were professor Mrs. Mirjana Roter BlagojeviÄ, PhD and Mr. Marko NikoliÄ, MSc, lecturers at the Faculty of Architecture in Belgrade.\n\nBy organizing the Round table in the Conference Hall of the Faculty of Architecture in Belgrade, on December 21st, 2012, the National Committee ICOMOS Serbia concluded the project of celebrating 40 years of the adoption of the Convention on the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage. Titled âWorld Heritage - terminology, criteria, roleâ this project started on April 18th, with the workshop and the study visit to Studenica Monastery and Stari Ras with SopoÄani. The intention was to devote the conversation to the critical analysis of the state of conservation of the monuments which had been referred to during the workshop. The fact that there are many open questions and different attitudes toward the applied conservation approaches, have launched a vivid discussion among the conservationists. The need to continue discussions at the next round table was highlighted, since the state of conservation of monuments that were presented at the workshop were not discussed due to the lack of time.\n\nOn May 21st 2012, in the auditory of the Ethnographic Museum in Belgrade Regular annual Assembly of the National Committee ICOMOS SerbiaÂ was held.\n\nOn this occasion, twoÂ statutoryÂ documentsÂ were adopted âÂ Rules of ProcedureÂ of the Assembly and Rules of Procedure ofÂ the ExecutiveÂ Board of the NationalÂ Committee ICOMOSÂ Serbia.Â Both theÂ AssemblyÂ and the Executive Board had previouslyÂ actedÂ in accordanceÂ with theseÂ rules,Â but due to lackÂ of quorumÂ at theÂ lastÂ sessionÂ of the AssemblyÂ could not beÂ officiallyÂ adopted.\n\nMs. Branka Å ekariÄ, the president on the National Committee ICOMOS Serbia, reported to the Assembly on the activities of the National Committee during the period from May 2011 to May 2012, and announced the main program guidelines for the next period of one year. Both documents were unanimously adopted as well as the financial report which was, on behalf of the Supervising Board, presented by Mr. Miladin LukiÄ.\n\nThe general conclusion isÂ that theÂ NationalÂ CommitteeÂ wasÂ very active during the periodÂ between the twoÂ assemblies,Â that almostÂ all the objectivesÂ set outÂ last yearÂ have been realized and that the reputationÂ of the NationalÂ CommitteeÂ rose significantly, evenÂ farÂ more at the international than at the national level.Â InÂ the following periodÂ it is expected, in addition toÂ regular activities,Â theÂ further affirmation ofÂ the associationÂ and all its members.\n\nOn the 40th anniversary of the Convention concerning the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural HeritageÂ (1972), ICOMOS Executive Committee recommended the World Heritage as the subject of the 2012 celebration.Â Within the project \"World Heritage - terminology, criteria, role\", National Committee ICOMOS Serbia organized the workshop that included a two-day study visit of Studenica Monastery and Stari Ras with SopoÄani (April, 18-19), Serbian cultural heritage inscribed on the World HeritageÂ List.\n\nThe workshop consisted of three segments.Â The first part was devoted to the history and development of the World Heritage Convention during four decades, with special emphasis on lesser-known and so far insufficiently explained the ways of its implementation (speaker: Sanja KesiÄ RistiÄ).Â In the second segment, conservators - members of the National Committee, presented the latest work on the preservation of Studenica and the monuments of Stari Ras (presenters: Slobodan BariÅ¡iÄ, Stojanka SamardÅ¾iÄ MA, Nevena DebljoviÄ RistiÄ, Dragan StanojeviÄ MA, Aleksa JelikiÄ, Marina NeskoviÄ).Â The third part of the workshop consisted of the visit of these cultural properties from the World Heritage List followed by discussions on performed conservation works.\n\n* * *\n\n2011\n\nBy the Decision of the Ministry of Culture, Media and Information Society no. 022-05-14/2011-06 of October 20, 2011 Official Gazette of the Republic of Serbia no. 82/2011 of 11.04.2011, the National Committee ICOMOS Serbia has acquired the status of representative association in the domain of culture.b>\n\n* * *\n\nWithin the framework of the planned program activities for 2011, the National Committee ICOMOS Serbia organized the round table on the topic of The Ethical Dimension of the Conservatorâs Proffession that was held in Belgrade, in the Conference Hall of the Faculty of Architecture, on October 21st 2011. The main idea of this round table was to initiate the dialog on the very important issue of the contemporary conservation, among the conservators as professionals who consciously assume responsibility of the heritage transmission to the future. The starting point or framework for discussion was the ICOMOS Ethical Commitment Statement, the document which aims to clarify ethical conservation standards and principles emphasizing the practical responsibility of each member of ICOMOS in relation to the cultural heritage. The intention was to highlight the profession as \"a freely assumed commitment\" which should not be conditioned and the professional and ethical behavior in the performance of work shouldnât be called into question. The principal idea was to promote ââan ethical-based conservation practice and the improvement of the responsible decision making process in the matter of protecting and preserving the national heritage. The organization of this round table presents the first attempt in our community to set the problem of heritage preservation and responsibility of decision making as a dialogue between conservationists, who are the key actors in the process of conservation, and the state of conservation, which is the result of their actions. It is estimated that the conversation was conducted as an open and constructive dialogue in which also the examples were presented that call into question the ethical behavior of a certain number of conservators. In accordance with the Statute of the National Committee ICOMOS Serbia, it was proposed that the National Committee formed Commissions for a number of cultural properties, where it was assumed that the further devastation or planned intervention could be stopped.\n\n* * *\n\nRegular annual Assembly of the National Committee ICOMOS Serbia was held on May 20th 2011, in the auditory of the Ethnographic Museum in Belgrade, Serbia.\n\nMs. Branka Å ekariÄ, the president on the National Committee ICOMOS Serbia, reported to the Assembly on the activities of the National Committee during the period from May 2010 to May 2011, and announced the main program guidelines for the next period of one year. Both documents were adopted as well as the Decision on the establishment of the âClub of Cezare Brandiâs friends in Belgradeâ, as a section at the National Committee ICOMOS Serbia.\n\nOn behalf of the Supervising Board, Mr. Miladin LukiÄ presented the financial report. The report was adopted by acclamation. The Supervising Board also suggested, and the Assembly adopted, the establishing of the national membership fee in the amount of 1000 RSD (app. 10 â¬). Attendant members of the National Committee were asked to complete their expert profiles in the ICOMOS database up to the end of November 2011 as the latest.\n\n* * *\n\nThe presentation consisted of two parts. Mrs. Nevenka NovakoviÄ addressed the advantages of the position of the Fortress through various historical plans and maps, as well as its great potential as a main tourist attraction in todayâs Belgrade. The Belgrade Fortress is also included in the project of Ministry of Culture of Republic of Serbia, named \"Cultural Route - Fortresses on the Danube\", which is supported by UNESCO as a part of the regional project for cultural heritage of South-East Europe, \"Cultural Heritage - a Bridge towards a Shared Future\".\n\nIn the second part of the presentation, Ms. Ivana FilipoviÄ exposed disaster risk management plan for the Lower town of the Belgrade Fortress. This part of the Fortress is endangered to become completely devastated, threatened by the floods which had been occasionally recorded during the last century, and have become more frequent during the first decade of the 21st century."
