        "text": "Discussion\n\nIn this study we investigated the relationship of CSF biomarkers for Alzheimer’s disease and neurodegeneration with markers reflecting disturbances in cholesterol homeostasis (27-OH), vascular function (AGT, VEGF), inflammation (IL-12/IL-23p40, IL-15, calprotectin, TRX-80), redox capacity (TRX-1) and glucose homeostasis (ENPP-2) in a memory clinic cohort. Importantly, we intentionally selected individuals who were not diagnosed with hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, or diabetes mellitus, to eliminate as much as possible the contribution of these comorbidities often found in Alzheimer’s patients. This helped us address the question whether the observed findings are independently related to neurodegenerative processes and are not secondary to these peripheral conditions. We further stratified the studied biomarkers into three groups based on their biological function (Vascular/metabolic, Inflammation and Survival) and explored their distribution among the clinical groups and their association to traditional Alzheimer’s disease biomarkers. Furthermore, we used a data-driven approach to cluster the participants into two distinct groups based on their biomarker profiles. Finally, we selected two proteins that showed associations with Alzheimer’s disease pathology and neurodegeneration in our CSF cohort (TRX-1 and AGT) to further characterize their distribution in postmortem human hippocampal tissue of Alzheimer’s disease and non-demented control individuals.\n\nWhen comparing levels of the individual CSF markers, we found that SNAP-25 and NFL were increased in mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer’s disease compared to the subjective cognitive decline group. Synaptic failure and degeneration are early events in Alzheimer’s disease pathogenesis. One of the most promising candidate biomarkers of synaptic dysfunction is SNAP-25, a major component of the SNARE complex, mediating neurotransmitter release.29 Together with SNAP-25, CSF levels of the presynaptic protein SYT-1 and the postsynaptic NG, are increased in early stages of the Alzheimer’s disease continuum and correlate with cognitive decline, Aβ and tau pathology.5,26,30,31 In our study, NG levels tended to be elevated in Alzheimer’s patients (though not significant), while SYT-1 did not vary across the three clinical groups. This could be attributed to the relatively small sample size, study population characteristics or other confounding factors. CSF NFL is a marker of ongoing axonal damage, often found elevated in several neurological disorders including Alzheimer’s disease. Although it is not specific for Alzheimer’s disease or any other neurodegenerative disorder, NFL has been previously found upregulated in CSF from Alzheimer’s disease patients compared to healthy controls yet shown to reflect amyloid-independent neurodegeneration.4 Thus, increased CSF NFL among patients with mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer’s disease seen in our study, could be mirroring the contribution of a mixed pathology in Alzheimer’s disease.\n\nTRX-1, AGT and IL-15 emerged as the biomarkers that showed the highest number of statistically significant associations with the other individual biomarkers and with markers of Alzheimer’s disease-associated pathological processes. TRX-1, with its oxidoreductase activity, is one of the major components of the oxidative stress response machinery.32 In Alzheimer’s disease, this activity is impaired leading to an imbalance in redox homeostasis.33 So far, CSF TRX-1 levels have not been extensively explored in the context of Alzheimer’s disease. In an earlier study from Arodin et al.,12 TRX-1 was increased in Alzheimer’s disease and in mild cognitive impairment converters to Alzheimer’s patients compared to stable mild cognitive impairment individuals. In contrast, in the present study, no differences were found in TRX-1 CSF levels between the clinical groups. This could be attributed to a discrepancy of the cohorts or due to methodological issues, e.g., the different assays used to quantify TRX-1. Nevertheless, we did find associations between TRX-1 levels and CSF markers for Alzheimer’s disease (p-Tau/Aβ42 ratio), synaptic loss (SNAP-25) and neurodegeneration (NFL), supporting its implication in Alzheimer’s disease pathogenesis. TRX-1 acts as a cytoprotective molecule by suppressing apoptosis via its interaction with apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK-1)9 and by mediating neurite outgrowth through nerve growth factor signaling in neurons.34 In addition, TRX-1 protects the cells from amyloid-β mediated cytotoxicity.9 Interestingly, its truncated form, TRX-80, inhibits amyloid-β aggregation and is decreased in the CSF of Alzheimer’s disease patients.10,11 In the present study we were not able to detect TRX-80 in most cases due to assay sensitivity issues. Though in the limited detectable samples, TRX-80 was equally distributed between the groups. TRX-1 correlated also with the cytokines IL-12/IL-23p40 and IL-15 in our cohort. In line with our data, it has been documented that TRX-1 is involved in inflammation by inducing pro-inflammatory pathways via Nuclear Factor kappa B (NF-kB) and NLR family pyrin-domain containing 3 inflammasome (NLPR3), as well as by regulating anti-inflammatory processes.35 In our study, TRX-1 correlated also with AGT and 27-OH suggesting that it may be implicated in diverse pathological mechanisms occurring in Alzheimer’s disease through its ubiquitous function.\n\nImmunohistochemical analyses of human hippocampal samples confirmed the absence of TRX-1 levels changes in AD individuals compared to controls. A co-localization with p-tau was evident in both groups, suggesting a more general, non-Alzheimer’s disease specific association with tau. A limited number of studies have explored TRX-1 distribution in the human Alzheimer’s disease brain so far, with contradictory results: TRX-1 was found to be decreased in hippocampal and cortical regions of AD brains9,36 by some studies, while others found, as we did here, no changes in TRX-1 levels between Alzheimer’s disease and control brains.12 However, in the latest, they reported a different subcellular distribution of TRX-1; in control cases it was mainly nuclear while in Alzheimer’s disease it was cytosolic. The authors concluded that TRX-1 nuclear depletion in Alzheimer’s disease neurons could affect the DNA damage response to oxidative stress. However, such a finding was not supported by our data. The discrepancies between the different studies could be attributed to methodological or cohort differences, such as the selection of antibodies, or a population free of common comorbidities as in our material.\n\nAGT is the precursor of angiotensin I, which is further converted to angiotensin II by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). In the CNS, AGT is mainly produced by astrocytes37,38 but has also been observed to localize in neurons.18 Like TRX-1, AGT has not been extensively studied in Alzheimer’s disease. Hyperactivation of brain RAS has been linked to the disease,40 yet data on the expression levels of AGT in the human Alzheimer’s disease brain are very limited. A previous study showed AGT upregulation in Alzheimer’s brains,17 while others reported no alterations.41 However, the presence or not of mixed comorbidities in these cohorts was not evaluated. We report here that AGT positively correlated with markers of neurodegeneration, p-tau, and synaptic dysfunction or loss. In linear regression analysis, AGT was associated with NFL and SNAP-25 after age and diagnosis adjustment. The effects of RAS activation in the brain are receptor dependent; for instance, activation of angiotensin II type 1 receptor has a largely negative impact resulting in, e.g., inflammation and oxidative stress, while activation of angiotensin II type 2 receptor has a protective role (as reviewed in 17). Thus, the observed positive correlation between TRX-1 and AGT may reflect an interplay in the context of enhanced oxidative stress. Furthermore, we found a positive correlation between AGT and 27-OH. Previous in vitro and in vivo work has shown that 27-OH induces AGT production in the brain, implying a connection between hypercholesterolemia and hypertension in neurodegeneration.39In agreement with Mateos et al.,17 we show that AGT immunoreactivity is increased in postmortem hippocampal tissue of Alzheimer’s disease subjects compared to controls, suggesting an altered AGT synthesis or cleavage that was independent of the presence of hypertension, hypercholesterolemia or diabetes. Moreover, AGT co-localized extensively with p-tau in Alzheimer’s disease brains, further supporting its implication in the disease pathology.\n\nStrikingly, p-tau was predominantly located in the nucleus of control cases while it was mainly cytoplasmic in dementia donors. Although tau is a cytosol-enriched protein, it has been shown to localize in the nucleus of human brain in both phosphorylated and de-phosphorylated states.40,41 Interestingly, it was reported that nuclear tau and other regulators of protein synthesis were decreased in several hippocampal and cortical regions of Alzheimer’s disease cases, contributing to altered ribosome biogenesis and protein synthesis.42 In addition, tau is reported to bind to DNA40 and assist in the maintenance of genomic stability against genotoxic stress.43 However, the knowledge on nuclear tau is limited and whether the differential distribution of p-tau seen in our material could affect its function and promote neurodegeneration needs further investigation.\n\nWhen exploring our CSF-data, we followed two distinct strategies to identify pathophysiological profiles that could reflect different cognitive disorder phenotypes, based on the current clinical diagnostic criteria. In both analyses we intentionally included only the less explored markers of Alzheimer’s disease risk pathologies, as the more traditional would have most probably overpowered the analyses. In the first approach we grouped the biomarkers based on their function, generating three components, i.e., Vascular/metabolic, Inflammatory and Survival. This categorization was quite challenging as many of these proteins are pleiotropic and could fit in more than one group, but we tried to categorize them based on a meaningful biological relevance. We did not find any relationship between the clinical and the biomarker-based groups, although a tendency towards a higher Vascular/metabolic profile in the Alzheimer’s disease group was observed (albeit not statistically significant). Thus, the amount of contribution of these pathophysiological processes is not necessarily reflected in the diagnostic categories. However, all components were associated to synaptic dysfunction, and Inflammatory and Survival components were associated with an AD-CSF profile and axonal damage. Conclusively, our data support the tight connection of these pathophysiological mechanisms to traditional AD related pathways throughout the clinical spectrum in a population free of related comorbidities.\n\nIn the second approach, we used a data-driven strategy that stratified individuals into two distinct pathophysiological subtypes. The two-step cluster analysis used here has the advantage that the number of clusters is not determined a priori, but it is rather automatically generated based on a statistical measure of fit (BIC). The proteins that contributed the most in the clustering were TRX-1, AGT and IL-15. Individuals in cluster 1 were defined by higher levels of TRX-1, AGT, IL-15, 27-OH and IL-12/IL-23p40, thus showing an endophenotype characterized by increased oxidative stress, vascular and cholesterol metabolism pathology and neuroinflammation. Furthermore, cluster 1 consisted of older participants with increased SNAP-25 and NFL compared to cluster 2. Hence, in the absence of comorbidities, this could mirror the contribution of these common pathophysiological pathways in AD progression through a process potentially independent of amyloid and tau pathology. Paradoxically, cluster 1 individuals had a better MMSE score. Whether this is true or a chance finding due to the relatively small sample size and/or other unknown confounding factors, it is unclear now and needs further investigation. None of the two biomarker-driven subtypes was associated with a particular clinical diagnosis as both contained a mixture of all clinical trajectories. Similarly, both clusters were equally represented in each clinical group, further highlighting the biological complexity and heterogeneity observed in Alzheimer’s disease44 even when reducing the number of confounding comorbidities. In this context, precision medicine is the key towards an effective disease-modifying therapy as the “one drug fits all” concept has proven to be unsuccessful.45,46 Our work constitutes a modest attempt to assist in the implementation of a personalized therapeutic approach where individuals with specific “molecular” profiles linked to Alzheimer’s disease pathogenesis could benefit from certain interventions targeting these altered processes. For example, cluster 1 individuals could be subjected to therapies that can downregulate neuroinflammation, oxidative stress and improve vascular function and cholesterol homeostasis, while cluster 2 subjects would most likely not benefit from them. Importantly, this implementation could start already at the preclinical stage where altered pathobiological mechanisms can potentially be restorable.\n\nThe current study comes with some limitations. First, the sample size in the CSF cohort is relatively small which may explain the lack of between-group differences in most of the individual and combined markers. It should be noted though that the inclusion criteria limited substantially the number of eligible participants. Second, the study was cross-sectional and therefore the directionality of the relationships found here cannot be addressed. Third, a correction for multiple comparisons was not applied due to the explorative nature of this study, and therefore the conclusions should not be generalized. A strength of the study was the selection of individuals not diagnosed or treated for common comorbidities seen in Alzheimer’s disease, allowing us to conclude that the results found here are most probably independent of these conditions. Nevertheless, adding groups of individuals with comorbidities would further enhance this assumption.\n\nIn summary, we defined a set of molecular markers representing key Alzheimer’s disease risk mechanisms to be associated individually or in combinations to the well-established Alzheimer’s disease and neurodegeneration markers. As the population included in our study did not suffer from hypertension, diabetes or hypercholesterolemia, our findings suggest that the relationships found here are independent of these peripheral pathological conditions. Moreover, we showed that AGT was increased and colocalized with p-tau in hippocampal sections of Alzheimer’s disease. Finally, we identified two biologically distinct endophenotypes in memory clinic patients that are likely to be affected by different mechanism leading to cognitive impairment or Alzheimer’s disease. Our findings support the complex interplay of several key pathophysiological mechanisms to Alzheimer’s disease pathology and further highlight the biological heterogeneity in Alzheimer’s disease with relevant clinical applications."
