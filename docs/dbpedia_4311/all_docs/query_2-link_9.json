        "text": "Verbal fluency tasks require generation of words beginning with a letter (phonemic fluency; PF) or from a category (category fluency; CF) within a limited time period. Generally, total output on CF has been used to discriminate Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) from Alzheimer&#39;s disease (AD), while poor PF has been used as a marker for behavioral-variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD). However, in the absence of this disparate performance, further characterization of the task becomes necessary. Objective: We examined whether fluency, as well as its components, clustering (successively generated words belonging to a category) and switching (shifting between categories) carried diagnostic utility in discriminating AD from MCI and bvFTD. Methods: PF (letter &#39;P&#39;) and CF (&#39;animals&#39;) tasks were administered in English to patients with MCI (n=25), AD (n=37), and bvFTD (n=17). Clustering and switching scores were calculated using established criteria. Results: Our findings...\n\nCognitive assessment with wordlist memory tests is a cost-effective and non-invasive method of identifying cognitive changes due to Alzheimer&#39;s disease and measuring clinical outcomes. However, with a rising need for more precise and granular measures of cognitive changes, especially in earlier or preclinical stages of Alzheimer&#39;s disease, traditional scoring methods have failed to provide adequate accuracy and information. Well-validated and widely adopted wordlist memory tests vary in many ways, including list length, number of learning trials, order of word presentation across trials, and inclusion of semantic categories, and these differences meaningfully impact cognition. While many simple scoring methods fail to account for the information that these features provide, extensive effort has been made to develop scoring methodologies, including the use of latent models that enable capture of this information for preclinical differentiation and prediction of cognitive chan...\n\nIn the evaluation of the nature of naming disorders, there is a rapid increase of anomia with the progression of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), which is associated with whole brain atrophy. Although numerous studies have investigated this naming disorder, there is limited information on naming procedures in these patients. Reaction time (RT) is highly sensitive to dementia and provides an accurate measurement. The present study investigated the RT of each underlying level of naming in patients with mild AD and identified the nature of anomia in these patients. The study consisted of 24 healthy elderly and 22 mild AD patients who participated in experiments that were designed for evaluating each level of Levelt’s model. Responses were divided into three groups of correct, false, and no-response and their RTs were calculated. The statistical analyses showed significant differences between healthy elderly and patients with mild AD in terms of access to the concept and the phonological form of the words. Moreover, significant differences in the type of responses were observed between correct and false responses of both groups. There was a significant difference between the no-response cases except in the case of lemma access for singular and plural names in other tasks. The results suggest that patients with mild AD have problems at the conceptual stage and access to the phonological form of a word."
