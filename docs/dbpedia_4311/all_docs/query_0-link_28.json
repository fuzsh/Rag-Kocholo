        "text": "Epilepsy is one of the most common neurologic disorders affecting a substantial part of the population worldwide. Epileptic seizures represent the situation of increased neuronal activity associated with the enhanced demands for sufficient energy supply. For that purpose, very efficient regulatory mechanisms have to operate to ensure that cerebral blood flow, delivery of oxygen, and nutrients are continuously adapted to the local metabolic needs. The sophisticated regulation has to function in concert at several levels (systemic, tissue, cellular, and subcellular). Particularly, mitochondria play a key role not only in the energy production, but they are also central to many other processes including those leading to neuronal death. Impairment of any of the involved pathways can result in serious functional alterations, neurodegeneration, and potentially in epileptogenesis. The present review will address some of the important issues concerning vascular and metabolic changes in path...\n\nIn Alzheimer&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;#39;s disease (AD) brains increased NO synthase (NOS) expression is found in reactive astrocytes surrounding amyloid plaques. We have recently shown that treatment with beta-amyloid peptides or IL-1beta down-regulates NO-sensitive soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC) in cultured astrocytes and in adult rat brain. In this work, we have examined sGC activity and expression in postmortem brain tissue of AD patients and matched controls. No significant alteration was observed in basal or NO-stimulated sGC activity, nor in sGC beta1 and alpha1 subunit levels in cortical extracts of AD brains. Immunohistochemistry showed intense and widespread labeling of sGC beta1 in cortical and hippocampal neurons and white matter fibrillar astrocytes, while grey matter astrocytes were faintly stained. In AD, expression of sGC in neurons and fibrillar astrocytes is not altered but is markedly reduced in reactive astrocytes surrounding amyloid plaques. Immunostaining for sGC beta1 was also lacking in reactive astrocytes in cortex and subcortical white matter in Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease brains and in subacute and chronic plaques in multiple sclerosis (MS) brains. Thus, induction of astrocyte reactivity is associated with decreased capacity to generate cGMP in response to NO both in vitro and in vivo. This effect may be related to the development of the astroglial inflammatory response.\n\nWe investigated the effect of trimethyltin (TMT), a well-known neurotoxicant, on murine hippocampal neurons and glial cells. Three days following intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of TMT into 1-month-old Balb/c mice at a dose of 2.5 mg/kg body weight we detected damage of the dentate gyrus granular neurons. The dying cells displayed chromatin condensation and internucleosomal DNA fragmentation, which are the most characteristic features of apoptosis. To study, if prolyl oligopeptidase is engaged in neuronal apoptosis following TMT administration, we pretreated mice with the specific inhibitor – Fmoc-Pro-ProCN in doses of 5 and 10 mg/kg body weight (i.p. injection). Three days following injection we did not observe any attenuation of neurotoxic damage, regardless of inhibitor dose, indicating the lack of prolyl oligopeptidase contribution to neuronal injury caused by TMT. The neurodegeneration was associated with reactive astrogliosis in whole hippocampus, but particularly in injured dentate gyrus. The reactive astrocytes showed an increased nerve growth factor (NGF) expression in ventral as well as dorsal hippocampal parts. NGF immunoreactivity was also augmented in neurons of CA3/CA4 areas, which were almost totally spared after TMT intoxication. It suggested a role for this neurotrophin in protection of pyramidal cells from loss of connection between CA3/CA4 and dentate gyrus fields. The granule neurons’ death was accompanied by increased histochemical staining with isolectin B4, a marker of microglia, in the region of neurodegeneration. The microglial cells displayed ramified and ameboid morphology, characteristic of their reactive forms. Activated microglia were the main source of interleukin 1β (IL-1β). It is possible that this cytokine may participate in neurodegeneration of granule cells. Alternatively, IL-1β elaborated by microglia could play a role in increasing NGF expression, both in astroglia and in CA3/CA4 neurons.\n\nAlzheimer’s disease (AD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disorder and the leading cause of dementia. The disease progression is associated with the build-up of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in the brain. However, besides the well-defined lesions, the AD-related pathology includes neuroinflammation, compromised energy metabolism, and chronic oxidative stress. Likewise, the blood–brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction is suggested to be a cause and AD consequence. Accordingly, therapeutic targeting of the compromised BBB is a promising disease-modifying approach. We utilized a homozygous triple-transgenic mouse model of AD (3×Tg-AD) to assess the effects of L-norvaline on BBB integrity. We scrutinized the perivascular astrocytes and macrophages by measuring the immunopositive profiles in relation to the presence of β-amyloid and compare the results with those found in wild-type animals. Typically, 3×Tg-AD mice display astroglia cytoskeletal atrophy, associated with the depositio...\n\nThe tumor necrosis factor-α death domain pathway contributes to cellular degeneration in a variety of conditions. This study investigates the hypothesis that this death domain pathway is progressively induced in the brain during the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). AD cases had increased levels of proapoptotic markers including tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα), TNF receptor type 1 (TNF-R1), TNF receptor–associated death domain (TRADD), and caspase-3, 2- to 10-fold higher (P < .01) than age-matched controls and 1 to 3 times higher than transitional cases. In striking contrast, potentially neuroprotective TNF receptor type 2 (TNF-R2), and Fas-associated death domain-like interleukin-1β–converting enzyme (FLICE) inhibitor protein (FLIP) were decreased in AD as compared with age-matched control cases (P < .01). Overall, there was an elevation in proapoptotic elements, including a 5-fold increase in TNF-R1 and a 12-fold decrease in FLIP in AD brains. These changes may translate to increased degenerative potential because the downstream effector caspase-3 and product of the TNF pathway was also increased in parallel with enhanced TNF proapoptotic conditions. Our findings suggest that the TNF death receptor pathway and caspases are activated in the early stages of neuronal degeneration in AD."
