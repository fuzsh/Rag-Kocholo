        "text": "December 10, 2004 Serbia Accuses Kosovo Prime Minister of War Crimes, Suspends Talks Washington, D.C. - Serbia has withdrawn from U.N.-mediated talks with ethnic-Albanian Kosovo officials to protest the election of former Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) commander Ramush Haradinaj to the office of Kosovo prime minister, alleging that he committed war crimes during the province's 1998-1999 war between the KLA and Serb security forces. Serb Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica described the election of Haradinaj as a \"political provocation.\" Serbia's suspension of the Vienna talks, which began in the Austrian capital in 2003 to discuss practical issues such as the province's trade and energy policies, is a blow to U.S. and European hopes that the discussions could clear the way for negotiations on Kosovo's future status, which U.N. officials say should begin in mid-2005. Last held in September, the Vienna talks marked the first official contact between senior Serb politicians and pro-independence Kosovar Albanians since relations between the two collapsed prior to the war. Haradinaj was elected prime minister by Kosovo's ethnic-Albanian-dominated parliament on December 3, following the formation of a coalition government between President Ibrahim Rugova's Democratic League of Kosovo, which won 45 percent of the vote in the October 23 elections, and Haradinaj's Alliance for the Future of Kosovo, which came in third with 8 percent. Haradinaj, who predicted that Kosovo would be sovereign within 12 months, asserted that Pristina should remain engaged in the talks and offered to open a dialogue with the Serb government at any time, either in Belgrade or in Pristina. Serb Justice Minister Zoran Stojkovic, stated that, if Haradinaj came to Belgrade, he would be arrested by authorities, since he is wanted by Serbia's judiciary on 108 counts alleging that war crimes were perpetrated by him, including ordering the torture, rape, and murder of Serb civilians, and killing several of them himself. Serb authorities have reportedly provided evidence to the international war crimes tribunal in The Hague concerning their allegations and insist that Haradinaj be indicted by the court. U.N. war crimes investigators have questioned him twice on his role during the war, but no charges have been brought by them. Haradinaj, who denied any involvement in war crimes, asserted that Serbia fabricated evidence against him. He indicated, however, that he would surrender if indicted by The Hague. The Serb government demanded that the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) annul the election of Haradinaj, but UNMIK head Soren Jessen-Petersen rejected the appeal, stating that the man was elected \"in full conformity with democratic and constitutional principles.\" Kosovar Serb officials announced that they would discontinue all cooperation and affiliation with the institutions of the government of Kosovo and regard Belgrade's plan for the decentralization of the province as the only document that offers a viable political solution for Kosovo, which is still legally part of Serbia. Serb President Boris Tadic said their decision would only further endanger the interests of Kosovar Serbs, even though the election of Haradinaj was \"unacceptable.\" In a separate development, U.S. Ambassador at Large for War Crimes Issues, Pierre-Richard Prosper, stated that Serbia's lack of cooperation with The Hague was jeopardizing plans to conclude the work of the court by 2010 as stipulated by the U.N. Security Council and said its lifespan might have to be extended. \"There is zero cooperation\" on the part of Belgrade, Prosper said, asserting that Prime Minister Kostunica was the chief obstacle to this cooperation, which is mandated by the Security Council. November 19, 2004 Kosovar Albanians on Trial in The Hague for First Time Washington, D.C. - Three former members of the now-disbanded Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA), arrested in early 2003, went on trial at the international war crimes tribunal in The Hague on November 15, marking the first time any Albanians from Kosovo have been tried at the court. Fatmir Limaj, Haradin Bala, and Isak Musliu are accused of killing a total of 35 Serb civilians and ethnic Albanians who were suspected of collaborating with Serbs during the 1998-1999 conflict in Kosovo. The tribunal's chief prosecutor, Carla Del Ponte, has said the international community and the local authorities in Kosovo have failed to cooperate sufficiently in her investigation of alleged crimes committed by the KLA. Del Ponte said she would issue a new indictment against KLA leaders before the end of 2004. In a separate development, Croatian Prime Minister Ivo Sanader met in Belgrade on November 15 with President of Serbia and Montenegro Svetozar Marovic and Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica, marking the first visit by a Croatian head of government to Serbia for more than a decade. The leaders pledged to work together to promote their countries' memberships in the European Union and to normalize bilateral relations. October 29, 2004 Rugova's Party Leads in Kosovo Vote Amid Serb Boycott Washington, D.C. - Progress toward establishing a functioning multi-ethnic society in Kosovo was thwarted when less than one percent of the province's 80,000 Serbs voted in the October 23 parliamentary elections that gave a 45.4 percent plurality to the pro-independence Democratic League of Kosovo of President Ibrahim Rugova, an ethnic Albanian. Only 53 percent of the province's 1.3 million eligible voters cast ballots. Rugova, who stated that he hoped to lead Kosovo to independence, began conducting negotiations toward forming a governing coalition. His two main ethnic Albanian rival parties, which were founded by guerrilla leaders of the now-disbanded Kosovo Liberation Army, came in second and third. Hashim Thaci's Democratic Party of Kosovo received 28.8 percent, while Ramush Haradinaj's Alliance for the Future of Kosovo garnered 8.3 percent. Although 10 of the 120 seats in Kosovo's assembly have been set aside for Serbs, the legitimacy of these Serb representatives will be in question since the seats will be filled through appointments. The head of the U.N. Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK), Soeren Jessen-Petersen, has called for the greatest possible participation of Serbs in the government going into 2005, when talks on the final status of Kosovo are expected to begin. Ten other parliamentary seats are apportioned to other minorities, including two for Turks and four for Bosnians. If the province achieves progress on the \"standards before status\" benchmarks established by the United Nations, which include freedom of movement for Serbs and other minorities, talks between the government of Kosovo and the U.N. and the EU on the province's final status may begin in mid-2005. The Kosovar Serbs maintain that Kosovo should remain part of Serbia, while the ethnic Albanians seek independence. Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica and the Serbian Orthodox Church had both called on the Kosovar Serbs to boycott the elections, while some Serb voters stated that death threats and other forms of intimidation had prevented them from going to the polls. Jessen-Petersen stated that Serbs had \"had their democratic right to vote hijacked\" due to interference from outside Kosovo. Serbian Deputy Prime Minister Miroljub Labus urged political parties in Serbia to open discussions concerning the final status of Kosovo, stating that the elections indicated that Kosovar Serbs were not ready to participate in these discussions. October 22, 2004 Milosevic Loyalists Seek Serb President's Impeachment Over Kosovar Vote Washington, D.C. - The ultra-nationalist Serbian Radical Party, which holds the largest block of seats in the Serb parliament, and Milosevic's Socialist Party submitted a motion to the parliament calling for the impeachment of Serb President Boris Tadic for urging Kosovar Serbs to participate in Kosovo's October 23 parliamentary elections. The two parties asserted that Tadic had overstepped his legal powers and had violated Serbia's constitution when he called on the Serbs in Kosovo to vote in order to have their voices heard in the rebuilding of the province. About 80,000 of Kosovo's 2 million inhabitants are Serbs. A total of 104 lawmakers from the two parties filed the motion, which would require the support of two-thirds of the 250 members of parliament to pass. Then, at least half of all Serb voters would have to endorse the measure in a nationwide referendum. The motion has little chance of passing since the pro-reform parties in the governing coalition have said they will not support it. Serb Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica, who called on the Kosovar Serbs to boycott the October 23 elections, citing security problems, denounced Tadic's appeal for them to vote and criticized the United Nations for ignoring his own plan to decentralize local power in the province. Most Serbs are expected to stay away from the polls. The parliamentary elections in Kosovo will be the second in the province since it was placed under U.N. administration in June 1999, with voters choosing representatives for a 120-seat assembly. While the assembly has the power to pass laws in certain areas, ultimate authority in the province rests with the U.N. Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK). The head of UNMIK, Soeren Jessen-Petersen, urged all Serbs in Kosovo to vote so they can become part of the institutions of the province, where the unemployment rate is 35 to 55 percent, according to the IMF. State Department spokesman Adam Ereli said the United States welcomed Tadic's call for Kosovar Serbs to take part in the elections, noting that the Serb community's participation was the best way to \"ensure that its concerns are addressed.\" During a visit to Pristina four days before the polling, Solomon Passy, the current chairman of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and Bulgaria's foreign minister, urged all Kosovars to take part in the elections. October 8, 2004 War Crimes Tribunal Transfers Case to Serbia, Urges Arrests of Suspects Washington, D.C. - Carla del Ponte, chief U.N. prosecutor at the international war crimes tribunal in The Hague, has, for the first time, transferred one of the tribunal's cases to Serbia to be tried in a special court established in Belgrade last year to try war crimes cases. Del Ponte stated that the move signaled good cooperation between the tribunal and the Serbian judiciary. The decision was announced the first week of October by del Ponte in Belgrade, where she said she had conducted \"very fruitful\" talks with Serbian chief war crimes prosecutor Vladimir Vukcevic. She stated that the tribunal intended to transfer all war crimes cases for which indictments had yet to be issued to the Serbian judicial system, along with documents regarding unfinished investigations relating to these cases, beginning in 2005. In talks with political officials of Serbia and the federal government of Serbia and Montenegro, del Ponte raised problems concerning the Serbian government's lack of cooperation with The Hague. She noted that she would be looking for signs of progress in this cooperation when preparing a report for the U.N. Security Council at the end of November on the republic's willingness to work with the tribunal. Del Ponte repeated her demands for the arrest and extradition of some 20 war crimes suspects believed by the tribunal to be in Serbia, including Bosnian Serb army commander Ratko Mladic and four senior Serb army and police generals. Del Ponte repeated her assertion that Mladic was still hiding in Serbia under the protection of certain members of the Serbian military. Serbian Interior Minister Dragan Jocic said police were conducting an intensive investigation concerning his whereabouts, which the government has said are unknown. According to Jocic, the government was also proceeding as planned to follow up on its receipt of the arrest warrants against the four generals, one of whom has agreed to voluntarily turn himself in, while the other four have refused to appear in court to receive their indictment documentation. The Hague prosecutor said Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica had promised Belgrade's full cooperation with the tribunal, although that cooperation had not previously progressed, despite a cut in U.S. aid to the republic earlier this year in protest. Kostunica, who has repeatedly asked del Ponte for a transfer of trials from the tribunal to Serbian courts, has asserted that the tribunal is biased against Serbs and that cooperation with it must be weighed against the importance of maintaining \"political stability\" in Serbia. Del Ponte was in Belgrade to attend a conference, the first of its kind, to review Serbia's shortcomings in dealing with war crimes dating to the Balkan conflicts of the 1990s. It was organized by the Belgrade-based Humanitarian Law Center with support from the Council of Europe. On September 30, U.S. Undersecretary of State for Political Affairs Marc Grossman and Ambassador-at-Large for War Crimes Issues Pierre-Richard Prosper, during a visit to Belgrade, told Serb officials that they risked a return to international isolation if war crimes suspects were not arrested and extradited to The Hague. Richard Dicker of the New York-based Human Rights Watch stated that Serbia's cooperation with the tribunal in 2004 had been \"dismal.\" October 8, 2004 Local Serb Elections Consolidate Strong Rivalry Between Democrats and Nationalists Washington, D.C. - In the run-off vote of the first local elections since the fall of the Milosevic regime in October 2000, the pro-reform Democratic Party (DS) and the ultra-nationalist Serbian Radical Party (SRS) of Milosevic loyalists ran close races in Belgrade and Novi Sad, the capital of Vojvodina province and the second-largest Serb city, resulting in a narrow DS victory in the Serb capital and one by the SRS in Novi Sad. Overall, the four reformist parties of the ruling coalition under Serb Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica won at least 29 municipalities, while the DS, which is in the opposition in the Serb parliament, took 24. The SRS and Milosevic's Socialist Party of Serbia (SRS), the second main nationalist party, each secured 19 municipalities. Nationalist candidates did particularly well in the southern part of Serbia near Kosovo and in the poorer central provinces. In Belgrade, the Democratic Party candidate for the powerful post of mayor, Nenad Bogdanovic, took 50.3 percent of the vote, while the Serbian Radical Party's Aleksandar Vucic received 48.3 percent. In Novi Sad, the SRS candidate, Maja Gojkovic, defeated the outgoing mayor from the Democratic Party by only 695 votes, with a final tally of 50.3 to 49.7 percent. Although the Serbian Radical Party, which governed Serbia together with Milosevic, won the largest percentage of the vote in Serbia's December 2003 parliamentary elections, it was unable to form a coalition since no pro-reform party would join ranks with it. The strong showing by the Serbian Radical Party in the municipal elections has been attributed by some to the low voter turnout, about 30 percent, with the percentage of votes for the party's candidates remaining comparable to previous elections. Others have attributed it to displeasure over the slow pace of reforms to reduce poverty since Milosevic left office or a reaction against international efforts to promote closer cooperation between Belgrade and the war crimes tribunal, since the SRS has spoken out firmly against the extradition of war crimes suspects to the court. Advances by hard-liners in Serbia are viewed as having a negative impact on its efforts to integrate into the European Union and NATO, a goal pursued by the reformists in office since 2000. The showing of the SRS in the municipal elections could put them in a position to do well in the elections for the federal parliament of Serbia and Montenegro expected in February 2005. Serbian Finance Minister Mladjan Dinkic stated that a revival of Milosevic's Socialists and their ally, the Serbian Radical Party, was \"a certainty\" if pro-reform parties continued to bicker and failed to reunite. September 24, 2004 Reformers and Nationalists Battle It Out In Local Elections Washington, D.C. - In Serbia's local elections on September 19, candidates of the pro-reform Democratic Party (DS) of Serbian President Boris Tadic and those of the ultra-nationalist Serbian Radical Party (SRS) led by war crimes suspect Vojislav Seselj, awaiting trial in The Hague, emerged as the front runners in the majority of the municipalities. A number of municipalities, including the mayoral races in Belgrade and Novi Sad, prepared for run-off elections on October 3. The DS led in most urban areas, while the SRS dominated in rural communities and in the northern province of Vojvodina. In many municipalities, coalitions were formed between the pro-reform parties. The elections for the municipal leaders and town councils in 148 municipalities, the first since former Yugoslav president Slobodan Milosevic was defeated in October 2000, were viewed as an important step in Serbia's attempts to consolidate its democratic reform following the fall of Milosevic's regime. The turnout was 35 percent, the lowest in the past seven years. Tadic's Democratic Party seeks to bring Serbia closer to NATO and the European Union. The Serbian Radical Party, once allied with Milosevic, vocally opposes Western reforms, is suspicious of foreign direct investment, and continues to call for a Greater Serbia that would include parts of Bosnia and Croatia. It became the strongest single party in the Serb parliament following the December 2003 parliamentary elections, but it was unable to form a government. Due to a new law granting more self rule to local communities, the mayor of Belgrade is now the third most influential official in Serbia after the republic's prime minister and president. DS candidate Nenad Bogdanovic won about 33 percent of the mayoral vote in Belgrade, followed by Aleksandar Vucic of the SRS, who received about 29 percent. Zoran Drakulic, the candidate of Serb Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica's Democratic Party of Serbia (DSS), won 15 percent of the vote. In Novi Sad, the capital of Vojvodina, where 15 percent of the population is ethnic Hungarian, a candidate of the Serbian Radical Party took 42 percent of the vote for mayor, nine points more than that received by the Democratic Party's candidate. The European Parliament on September 16 accused the Serbian government of ignoring attacks against the ethnic Hungarian minority in Vojvodina and passed a non-binding resolution calling for a halt to this violence. Citing the desecration of tombstones, the proliferation of anti-Hungarian graffiti, the burning of the Hungarian flag, and a police attack on a mayor representing the minority, the Parliament called for an investigation of the incidents and the prosecution of those participating in the violence. On September 14, President Tadic assured Hungarian President Ferenc Madl, who was visiting Belgrade, that the Serbian government was taking seriously all reported incidents of violence against the province's ethnic Hungarian minority. Tadic said he had asked for a police investigation into the incidents. Prior to Madl's visit, Hungary had called on EU foreign ministers to intervene to prevent further attacks. September 17, 2004 NATO-Led Kosovo Force Boosted for Province’s Elections Washington, D.C. - Some 2,000 troops from France, Germany, and Italy will reinforce the 18,000-member KFOR peacekeeping force in Kosovo during the province’s parliamentary elections on October 23 and the month preceding the polls, which the Kosovar Serb minority has threatened to boycott. Both KFOR’s French commander, Gen. Yves de Kermabon, and the head of the U.N. Interim Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK), Soeren Jessen-Petersen, stated that ensuring a secure environment for the elections was a primary concern. KFOR and UNMIK were criticized for failing to prevent two days of anti-Serb riots in Kosovo in March 2004 staged by the province’s ethnic Albanian majority, which resulted in 19 deaths and the destruction of some 800 Serb houses, churches, and monasteries. On September 15, the U.N. said international prosecutors in Kosovo had charged four men and one juvenile in separate cases of anti-Serb violence related to the burning of a Serb Orthodox church during the March riots and the drive-by killing of a Serb teenager in June 2004. While Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica has accused the international community of failing to provide adequate protection for the Kosovar Serbs and has urged them to boycott the elections, Jessen-Petersen has called on the Serb minority to take part in the elections, asserting that a boycott of the vote will exclude them from future discussions on the final status of Kosovo. September 10, 2004 EU Will Deal with the Two Republics Separately on Economic Harmonization Washington, D.C. - The European Union announced that it would deal separately with the republics of Serbia and Montenegro, which comprise a loose federal union, in its efforts to harmonize their economic criteria with those of the EU as part of preparations for a single Stabilization and Association Agreement between the union and the bloc. The agreement is considered a first step toward integration into the European Union. Foreign Minister Bernard Bot of the Netherlands, which currently holds the rotating EU presidency, said, \"The EU continues to strongly endorse the existence of the State Union of Serbia and Montenegro but wants to be realistic when it comes to practical issues.\" He said the decision to pursue this \"twin track\" approach, made at an EU foreign ministers meeting on September 4, was aimed at preventing Serbia and Montenegro from lagging behind in the Stabilization and Association process. European Union External Relations Commissioner Chris Patten said the republics' \"complete disagreement about the harmonization of tariffs\" and their lack of progress in promoting a common trade policy had contributed to the EU's decision. Serbia and Montenegro each manage their own economic affairs, tax collection, and government spending, and have different currencies. The republics will be offered separate trade tariffs by EU governments in an attempt to encourage agricultural and industrial exports from the republics, where economic output is about half the 1990 level and unemployment stands at more than 30 percent. Both the Serbian and Montenegrin governments welcomed the European Union's decision. September 3, 2004 War Crimes Tribunal Appoints Counsel for Milosevic, Who Blames West, NATO for Collapse of Yugoslavia Washington, D.C. - U.N. judges at the international war crimes tribunal in The Hague asked the court to appoint defense lawyers to represent former Yugoslav president Slobodan Milosevic at his trial in order to avoid further delays in the proceedings because of his ill health. Milosevic, who has insisted on representing himself since the trial began in February 2002, called the decision, made two days after he launched his long-postponed defense, “a scandal.” Calling the war crimes charges against him “a mutilation of justice” and his trial “a farce,” Milosevic opened his defense by accusing the West, NATO, Kosovar Albanian drug gangs, Islamic militants, and the Vatican of contributing to the break-up of the former Yugoslavia. NATO, he said, had intervened in Kosovo in 1999 in order to exploit the region’s natural resources of cobalt, lead, and nickel, as well as its power plants. Milosevic challenged the prosecution’s allegations that he had encouraged Serb nationalism and had been responsible for the wars in the Balkans in the 1990s. He stated that the Croatian authorities had caused the war in Croatia in the early part of the decade and Serbs had, therefore, acted in self-defense, a factor that led Belgrade to assist the Serbian people in both Croatia and Bosnia. Serbs had not planned to create a greater Serbia, he said. Milosevic accused former Bosnian president Alija Izetbegovic of planning to eliminate the Serbs in order to create an Islamic state with the help of Middle Eastern fundamentalists. He also accused former U.S. president Bill Clinton of supporting the separatist Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA), describing its members as “Islamist terrorists,” and suggested that this support laid the foundations for the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. The former Serb president, who was extradited to the international war crimes tribunal in June 2001, faces 66 counts of war crimes allegedly committed in Croatia, Bosnia, and Kosovo during the 1990s. August 27, 2004 U.N. Kosovo Mission Chief Calls for Greater Urgency in Determining Province's Status Washington, D.C. - Soren Jessen-Petersen, a Danish national, became the new head of the U.N. Interim Administration in Kosovo (UNMIK) for one year on August 16, pledging to lead the process of resolving the final status of the Serbian province \"with a greater sense of urgency.\" \"There is a limit to how long you can keep a place in limbo,\" Jessen-Petersen, a former EU envoy to F.Y.R. Macedonia, said, adding that there will be no stability in the western Balkans unless the status of Kosovo is resolved. The United Nations has said that, in mid-2005, it will determine whether enough progress has been made by local leaders on eight standards of minority rights, democracy, and the rule of law to enable final status talks to move forward. Jessen-Petersen stated that he was looking at ways to accelerate implementation of the standards, which were laid out under the U.N.'s \"standards before status\" policy. The new UNMIK chief, who replaced Harri Holkeri, a former Finnish prime minister, who resigned as chief in May, noted that security must be established in the province before status talks can begin. Jessen-Petersen also stated that he would transfer more powers from UNMIK to the institutions of Kosovo's government, dominated by representatives of the ethnic Albanian majority, which comprises 90 percent of the province's population of 1.9 million. In addition, he will attempt to convince Kosovo's Serb minority to vote in the province's October 23 parliamentary elections, the second such elections since UNMIK took over the administration of the province in June 1999. The Serbian government has urged Kosovo's Serb minority to boycott the elections to protest the U.N.'s apparent rejection of Belgrade's decentralization proposal to grant Kosovar Serbs more autonomy. Following some 18 months of negotiations between UNMIK and the Council of Europe, Jessen-Petersen and the secretary general of the Council of Europe, Walter Schwimmer, signed two agreements that will provide frameworks for the monitoring of human rights protections in the province. The new UNMIK chief also requested greater OSCE involvement in the democratization of Kosovo. Jessen-Petersen, Kosovo Prime Minister Bajram Rexhepi, and the representative of the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) in the province jointly launched a project aimed at creating jobs and encouraging employers to hire more young people in order to reduce the 55 percent unemployment rate in Kosovo, where donor aid has dropped 70 percent since 2001. A report to U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan by Norway's ambassador to NATO, Kai Eide, recommends that \"serious exploratory discussion\" of Kosovo's future status be undertaken by the United Nations beginning in the fall of 2004. Annan asked Eide to study how to improve the U.N. mission in Kosovo after ethnic Albanians rioted in March killing 19 people and injuring some 900. July 30, 2004 Third Report in July Condemns International Handling of March Kosovo Riots Washington, D.C. - Human Rights Watch released a report on July 26 accusing United Nations police and the NATO-led KFOR peacekeeping force in Kosovo of failing \"catastrophically\" to protect minorities during a wave of interethnic violence in the province in March. Nineteen people were killed and 900 injured, while over 550 homes were burned, during attacks by ethnic Albanians on the Serb minority. The report followed a July 8 study by Amnesty International that arrived at the same conclusion and a mid-July report by the Ombudsperson Institution in Kosovo, a branch of the U.N. Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK), stating that the U.N. and Kosovo’s local authorities have not achieved even a minimal level of protection of rights and freedoms, particularly for the province’s Serb minority. Human Rights Watch stated that UNMIK, which operates a 3,500-member police force, and the 18,000 NATO-led troops in the KFOR peacekeeping force had not coordinated their response to the violence. Its report called for the deployment of more peacekeepers and police personnel in Kosovo to ward off future ethnic clashes, while demanding that the diverse foreign forces in the province be brought under a more unified command. The organization also stated that the international community in Kosovo was in \"absolute denial about its own failures\" in the province. UNMIK said the Human Rights Watch report did not appreciate the challenge that the violence had posed to KFOR and the police, while a KFOR spokesman stated that the report did \"not pay any respect to the efforts of the soldiers,\" who, he said, \"quickly stabilized the situation.\" July 23, 2004 Serb President, in U.S., Reaffirms Belgrade's Intent to Cooperate with Hague Washington, D.C. - Secretary of State Colin Powell urged Serb President Boris Tadic, during his first official visit abroad since his June 27 election, to promote the arrest and transfer of war crimes suspects to the international tribunal in The Hague. Powell indicated that Belgrade and Washington had to do everything they could to collectively bring former Bosnian Serb army commander Ratko Mladic, a top war crimes fugitive, to justice. U.S. Ambassador-At-Large for War Crimes Pierre Prosper, who also met with Tadic, said the capture of Mladic would open the possibility that other war crimes suspects, including four Serb army and police generals, could be tried before local courts. Tadic told the officials that Serbia was prepared to meet its international obligations with respect to the tribunal in order to stabilize its relations with the United States and the international community. He said everyone who had been indicted by the U.N. court would be sent to The Hague and Belgrade was doing all it could to assist in finding Mladic, despite allegations by tribunal officials that Serbia had previously helped him avoid prosecution. Powell said the United States wanted to work with Serbia and Montenegro as it pursues its goal of becoming part of NATO's Partnership for Peace, a stepping-stone to membership in the alliance, and as it seeks entry into the European Union. Tadic said the integration of the country into Euro-Atlantic institutions was a pre-condition for resolving security problems in the Balkans, including Kosovo. In their discussions on Kosovo, Powell emphasized Washington's support for \"standards before status,\" the achievement of eight benchmarks that include human rights improvements and democratization, laid out by the United Nations, before the final status of Kosovo can be discussed. Tadic said he supported this process. Tadic also stated that the plan proposed by the Serbian parliament for the decentralization of Kosovo could provide a good framework for a solution in the province, asserting that independence for Kosovo would be \"unacceptable.\" He noted that the situation in Kosovo had been \"fragile\" since the March 2004 wave of violence, and he said he wanted to do everything he could to promote a dialogue between Belgrade and Pristina and to provide security for the province's Serb minority. The Serb president emphasized to U.S. officials that Serbia needed more direct foreign investments in the Serbian economy and the creation of more jobs. While in Washington, Tadic also met with Vice President Richard Cheney, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, members of Congress, and World Bank officials. Dejan Milenkovic, a top suspect in the March 2003 assassination of Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic, was arrested in Thessaloniki, Greece, on July 16 and is being held at the city's police headquarters. He is currently being tried in absentia in Belgrade in a trial involving a total of 13 people charged with Djindjic's murder. The Serb government is expected to request Milenkovic's extradition. July 23, 2004 NATO Head Urges Serb Cooperation with Hague to Promote Alliance Ties Washington, D.C. - NATO Secretary General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer, during a visit to Belgrade, called on the leaders of Serbia and Montenegro to cooperate with the international war crimes tribunal in The Hague if it wants to satisfy the alliance's membership requirements. Belgrade is hoping to join NATO's Partnership for Peace, a key step toward membership in the alliance. In addition, Scheffer said the country must drop its lawsuit against eight member nations of NATO in the International Court of Justice over the alliance's bombing of Yugoslavia during the 1999 Kosovo war, in order to promote closer ties with NATO. Following talks with Ben Bot, the foreign minister of the Netherlands, which currently holds the EU presidency, Foreign Minister of Serbia and Montenegro Vuk Draskovic said he would propose that the lawsuit be dropped. \"There can be no partnership within Europe on the basis of lawsuits,\" Draskovic said. The secretary general said NATO leaders had given a \"really clear signal\" at the alliance's June summit in Istanbul that they would like to see Serbia and Montenegro become a member of the alliance. He called on Belgrade to continue to work toward military reform. The chief U.N. prosecutor at The Hague, Carla Del Ponte, accused Belgrade authorities of missing an opportunity to arrest war crimes suspect Goran Hadzic, a former Croatian Serb leader accused of actions committed in 1992-1993 in eastern Slavonia, Croatia, on July 13. Although the indictment of Hadzic was forwarded to the Serb Internal Affairs Ministry that morning, Del Ponte said, he was able to escape from the house in which he was staying in the Serbian city of Novi Sad later in the day, 17 hours before Serb police had been ordered by a local judge to arrest him. Del Ponte asserted that Hadzic's escape constituted the second example this year of a war crimes suspect's disappearance just hours after authorities received warrants for their arrest. The prosecutor stated that she would be forced to ask the tribunal's president to report Serbia and Montenegro to the U.N. Security Council for lack of cooperation with the tribunal over the issue. Serb Police Minister Dragan Jocic denied that there had been negligence on the part of the police force in dealing with Hadzic. Serbian Human Rights Minister Rasim Ljajic, who has been named the head of the new Serbia and Montenegro government committee in charge of overseeing the extradition of war crimes suspects to The Hague, stated that he had received death threats. Ljajic asserted that the country should focus on the capture of former Bosnian Serb military commander Ratko Mladic, whom Del Ponte maintains is in Serbia. Serbia and Montenegro Defense Minister Prvoslav Davinic stated that Belgrade needed to find and extradite Mladic or prove that he is not hiding in Serbia and Montenegro. Del Ponte asserts that 15 war crimes suspects are within Serbia and Montenegro. At least three of the four Serb army and police generals sought by the tribunal are living more or less freely in Belgrade. In an appearance on a Serb television program, one of the generals, Gen. Vladimir Lazarevic, stated that his extradition or that of the other generals, would be treasonous, would betray the memory of fallen Serbs, and would provide amnesty with regard to all war crimes committed against Serbs. A senior official of Serbia's Socialist Party reiterated the party's intent to withdraw support in parliament for Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica's minority government if any Serbian citizen is extradited to The Hague. July 16, 2004 Kosovo Assembly Challenges Authority of U.N. Mission Washington, D.C. - In defiance of the United Nations, which drafted the 2001 Constitutional Framework establishing Kosovo's provisional government and parliament, and alone holds the mandate to change it, ethnic Albanian lawmakers in the Kosovo Assembly voted on July 8 to amend the document through provisions that included the right to call a referendum on the province's independence from Serbia. In an attempt to dilute the exclusive authority of the U.N. Interim Administration in Kosovo (UNMIK) over public security, international relations, and the judicial system, other amendments transferred some of the U.N.'s authority in these areas to Kosovo's ethnic-Albanian dominated government by adding six ministries to the government, including those dealing with internal affairs and justice. The acting head of UNMIK, Charles Brayshaw, rejected the amendments, stating that only the United Nations had the authority, under Resolution 1244 of 1999, to make changes in the Constitutional Framework and sign them into law. Brayshaw urged the members of the Assembly to work toward achieving the benchmarks known as \"standards before status,\" laid out by UNMIK in April 2002, which must be met before the province's status can be determined. The standards are establishing functioning democratic institutions, the rule of law, freedom of movement, the return of refugees, economic progress, respect for property rights, dialogue between Pristina and Belgrade, and a properly constituted Kosovo Protection Corps. UNMIK officials said the Assembly could propose changes in competencies that did not fall within the powers reserved for the U.N. mission, stating that the mission was open to discussing proposals for such changes if they were submitted in accordance with the provisions of the Constitutional Framework. The minority Serb deputies were not present in the Assembly during the voting on the amendments, since they began boycotting the proceedings of the body earlier this year. Other minorities in the Assembly, including the Roma and Bosniaks, did not support the amendments. An annual report issued in mid-July by the Ombudsperson Institution in Kosovo, a branch of UNMIK, stated that the U.N. and the local authorities that have run Kosovo for the past five years have not achieved even a minimal level of protection of rights and freedoms, particularly for the province's Serb minority. The report lays much of the blame for the human rights shortcomings in Kosovo on the international community's failure to resolve the province's final status. A July 8 report compiled by Amnesty International (AI) charged that KFOR peacekeepers in Kosovo and UNMIK authorities failed to protect minorities during the March 17-19, 2004 outbreak of violence that left 19 people dead and more than 900 injured, mostly Serbs. The report said a lack of coordination between NATO and the U.N. was partially responsible for the high casualty toll that took place after ethnic Albanians attacked minority Serbs, and there appeared to have been \"no contingency planning.\" AI concluded that, five years after the international community assumed control of Kosovo, \"minorities remain as vulnerable as ever\" and continuing uncertainty over the province's final status exacerbates interethnic tensions. July 16, 2004 Montenegro Chooses New National Symbols Washington, D.C. - The parliament of the republic of Montenegro, which along with the republic of Serbia makes up the loose union of Serbia and Montenegro established in February 2003, voted to adopt a new flag, a national anthem, and a national day. The move was viewed as part of an effort toward Montenegro's independence from Serbia. Parliament Speaker Ranko Krivokapic stated that, for the first time in history, Montenegro had \"all three symbols of a nation,\" adding that \"the road to Montenegro's independence is irrevocable.\" July 13, designated as the republic's national day, marks the date in 1878 when major powers at the Berlin Congress recognized Montenegro as an independent country, as a weakened Ottoman Empire retreated from the region. Parliament re-introduced the flag that was used in Montenegro from 1878 until 1918 when it lost its independence and joined the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenians, which became socialist Yugoslavia after World War Two. An old folk song was approved as a national anthem. A March 14, 2002 agreement between the republics of Serbia and Montenegro, brokered by the European Union, laid the groundwork for the replacement of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia with the union of Serbia and Montenegro. The agreement said that, “upon the expiration of a three-year period,” the republics of Serbia and Montenegro “shall be entitled to instituting proceedings for a change of the state status, that is, withdrawal from the state union.” July 16, 2004 Greek Support for Belgrade's EU Aspirations Washington, D.C. - Greek Foreign Minister Petros Molyviatis, attending the July 11 swearing-in ceremony of Serbia's new reformist president Boris Tadic in Belgrade, told the incoming president that Greece would continue to support the efforts of Serbia and Montenegro to join the European Union and NATO, while also furthering bilateral relations with the country. Molyviatis stated that Tadic's assumption of the Serb presidency was \"a significant step\" toward the entry of Serbia and Montenegro into the European Union and other European institutions. While attending a meeting of the EU General Affairs Council in Brussels, the minister said the European Union must send Belgrade \"a positive message\" by reinforcing its European prospects and integration into Euro-Atlantic institutions, in view of Tadic's pro-democracy, pro-European agenda. Upon taking office, Tadic said Serbia's leaders \"must know our national priorities: they are our intentions to join the European Union.\" He stated that the republic's cooperation with the international war crimes tribunal in The Hague was \"a crucial precondition for all Euro-Atlantic integration and confirms our dedication to European values.\" In a joint statement on July 12, the European Union foreign ministers said the election of Tadic \"confirms the commitment of the Serbian people to reforms and to [Serbia's] European future.\" The ministers also called on the democratic forces in Serbia and Montenegro to work together to accelerate political and economic reforms, as well as cooperation with the war crimes tribunal. \"Concrete progress [in the reform process] would allow the European Union to complete a feasibility study to open talks in view of an association and stabilization agreement\" with Serbia and Montenegro, the statement said. July 10, 2004 Milosevic's Health Prompts Reassessment of War Crimes Trial Procedure Washington, D.C. - Reaching a new plateau in the trial of former Yugoslav president and war crimes suspect Slobodan Milosevic, the international war crimes tribunal in The Hague has questioned whether Milosevic's poor health will allow him to continue acting as his own lawyer, while one of the defense counsels appointed by the court to protect the Serb's interests has raised the issue of whether he is well enough to stand trial at all. Milosevic, who suffers from high blood pressure and heart problems, went on trial in February 2002 for more than 60 charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity during the conflicts in Bosnia, Croatia, and Kosovo. Since then, 66 trial days have been lost due to his ill health. Following the February 2004 conclusion of the prosecution's case, Milosevic began working on his own defense, for which he has been allotted 150 trial days. On July 6, the day he was scheduled to begin his defense, he was too sick to appear in court. The following day, the tribunal's judges said there was no evidence that he was too ill to continue standing trial over the long term, but they ordered court officials to appoint counsel to represent him, if necessary. Milosevic, 62, has repeatedly stated his unwillingness to have any lawyers represent him. The trial will resume on July 14 for a week to permit Milosevic to complete his opening statement, confined to four hours, and start calling witnesses before it goes into recess until August 31. Prior to July 14, he will undergo additional tests to establish his ability to conduct his own defense. July 10, 2004 U.S. Renews Pressure on Serbia to Extradite War Crimes Suspects Washington, D.C. - U.S. Undersecretary of State for Political Affairs Marc Grossman, on a July 7 visit to Belgrade, said Serbia must extradite war crimes suspects currently in the republic to the international tribunal in The Hague, particularly former Bosnian Serb army commander Ratko Mladic and four generals, or jeopardize its movement toward Euro-Atlantic integration. Washington's renewed pressure on Serbia to cooperate more closely with the war crimes tribunal took place less than two weeks after Boris Tadic, a pro-Western, pro-reform candidate, was elected president of Serbia. The international community has stipulated that further cooperation with The Hague is a key condition for financial and political aid to Serbia. Grossman stated that the United States would support prosecution of the four generals, including former army chief of staff Nebojsa Pavkovic, and other war crimes suspects by Serbian courts if Belgrade delivered Mladic to The Hague. Serbian officials have rejected allegations by U.N. war crimes prosecutor Carla Del Ponte that Mladic remains in Serbia. An opinion poll published on July 6 indicated that 57 percent of Serbs oppose extradition of the four generals. The day after Grossman's visit, the government of Serbia and Montenegro established a new special council on cooperation with the war crimes tribunal, stating that full cooperation with the court was a top political priority. It urged the new council, which is comprised of top officials from both Montenegro and Serbia, to take immediate action to meet the country's obligations to the tribunal. July 2, 2004 New Serb President Vows Move Toward EU, Cooperation with War Crimes Tribunal Washington, D.C. - Boris Tadic, the pro-Western reformist leader of the Democratic Party of the late Serb prime minister Zoran Djindjic, was elected president of Serbia on June 27, defeating the ultra-nationalist candidate, Tomislav Nikolic. Tadic won 53.5 percent of the vote, while Nikolic polled 45.1 percent, with a turnout of about 49 percent. Nikolic is a member of the Serbian Radical Party, which holds the largest single block of seats in the Serb parliament and is led by war crimes suspect Vojislav Seselj, on trial at the international war crimes tribunal in The Hague. Nikolic, who expresses a \"dream of a Greater Serbia,\" received the most votes in the first election round on June 13, but did not garner the 50 percent of the vote required to be named president in that round. Tadic's victory was welcomed by the European Union and the United States, as he pledged to promote greater integration into Europe and said Serbia should take action to extradite war crimes indictees to The Hague. Tadic called for new efforts to track down Ratko Mladic, the former commander of the Bosnian Serb Army, sought by the tribunal, which maintains that the fugitive is in Serbia Four days after the election of Tadic, the Foreign Ministry of Serbia and Montenegro submitted U.N. war crimes indictments against four generals to a Belgrade court, initiating a process that may lead to their extradition to The Hague. The suspects, former police chiefs Sreten Lukic and Vlastimir Djordjevic, and retired army generals Nebojsa Pavkovic and Vladimir Lazarevic, are among at least 15 war crimes indictees that Chief U.N. war crimes prosecutor Carla Del Ponte said spend most of their time in Serbia and Montenegro. Serbia and Montenegro President Svetozar Marovic stated that the country was ready to extradite the four generals, noting that Mladic was no longer hiding in Serbia. Referring to Tadic's victory, EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana said, \"The people of Serbia have clearly expressed their desire for a European future for Serbia. The EU stands ready to help them to achieve this objective.\" The U.S. government stated that Serbs had \"clearly chosen the path that will lead Serbia to the Euro-Atlantic integration and institutions where it belongs,\" noting that Belgrade must \"intensify its efforts to fulfill its international obligations.\" Washington, which withheld economic aid to Serbia on March 31 because of Belgrade's insufficient cooperation with The Hague, said it would \"explore the new opportunities . . . to assist Serbia.\" Tadic will be working with a minority coalition government led by Serbia's conservative prime minister, Vojislav Kostunica, the head of the Democratic Party of Serbia, who has stated that cooperation with the war crimes tribunal is not one of his priorities for Serbia. The Kostunica government has the parliamentary support of Slobodan Milosevic's Socialist Party of Serbia. Kostunica's party has been locked in a power struggle with Tadic's party, which is not part of the coalition, for several years. Serbia has been without an elected president since the term of indicted war crimes suspect Milan Milutinovic expired in January 2003. The results of three presidential elections since then have been declared invalid due to voter turnout lower than 50 percent. The 50-percent turnout requirement was abolished prior to the June 13 election. June 18, 2004 Extreme Nationalist Candidate Leads in First Round of Serbian Presidential Election Washington, D.C. - Tomislav Nikolic, a candidate of the Serbian Radical Party, led by indicted war crimes suspect Vojislav Seselj, took the lead over pro-Western candidate Boris Tadic in the first round of the presidential election in Serbia on June 13, opening the possibility that he could win the race in the June 27 runoff election. Tadic, the former defense minister of Serbia and Montenegro and the leader of the Democratic Party of the late Serbian prime minister, Zoran Djindjic, received 27.3 percent of the vote, compared to 30.6 percent for Nikolic, who has talked of aligning Serbia, not with Brussels, but with a \"Moscow-Beijing\" axis. Seselj, currently on trial at the international war crimes tribunal in The Hague, said his party would never abandon its aim of creating a Greater Serbia taking in most of Bosnia and Croatia. Dragan Marsicanin, the deputy leader of Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica's Democratic Party of Serbia (DSS), came in fourth with 13.3 percent. Kostunica, who regards Tadic's Democratic Party as the DSS's bitter rival, refrained from publicly supporting Tadic in the second round until June 16, when it was announced that the DSS would join the other parties of the governing coalition in backing the former defense minister. The Democratic Party is not part of the current Serbian government. The June 13 election was the fourth attempt to elect a Serb president over the last 18 months. The results of the three previous presidential elections were declared invalid because voter turnout was less than 50 percent. The January 27 vote will produce a president since the 50-percent turnout requirement has been abolished. Although the office of president carries largely ceremonial powers, a Nikolic victory on June 27 could bring down the pro-Western minority government, drive away foreign investors, and stall badly needed aid from Western financial institutions at a time when Serbia is seeking greater integration with Euro-Atlantic institutions. An opinion poll taken prior to the June 13 election indicated that, in a Tadic-Nikolic runoff, Tadic would receive 53 percent and Nikolic would garner 47 percent, but the margin of error places the two candidates in a dead heat in the run-up to the June 27 balloting. May 28, 2004 Serbia and Montenegro's President Makes Landmark Visit to Croatia Washington, D.C. - In the first visit to Zagreb by a president of Yugoslavia or Serbia and Montenegro since Croatia declared its independence in 1991, Serbia and Montenegro President Svetozar Marovic and Croatian President Stjepan Mesic pledged to strengthen bilateral relations and cooperate in achieving European integration for their respective countries. Bilateral relations have improved markedly since reformers replaced nationalists in the leadership of both nations in 2000, including a visit by Mesic to Belgrade last year, during which both presidents apologized for \"all the evils\" committed by their countries during the 1991-1995 Balkan wars. During his May 24 visit, Marovic voiced support for Croatia's move toward EU candidacy, stating that it was \"a good example that is an encouragement and a responsibility for all of us.\" Croatia hopes to be named a candidate at the bloc's summit in June, following the European Commission's recommendation in April that the EU open accession negotiations with Zagreb. A protocol signed by Croatia's Minister for European Integration, Kolinda Grabar Kitarovic, and Serbia's Minister for International Affairs, Predrag Ivanovic, will promote bilateral cooperation in the harmonization of the countries' laws with EU standards and set up joint working groups that will exchange information and tackle a variety of EU integration issues. Marovic and Mesic also expressed a desire to promote the return of ethnic Serb refugees who fled Croatia during the Balkan wars, resolve related property matters, and address the missing person issue to further stability in the region. According to the U.N., about 100,000 of the 280,000 Serbs who left Croatia have returned. The two leaders agreed that 42 Serbs currently imprisoned in Croatia would be transferred to Serbia, where they would complete their sentences. Other issues discussed were a bilateral free-trade agreement to be implemented in July, the continuation of visa-free travel between the two countries, and border disputes. The leaders announced that bilateral diplomatic contacts between their capitals would be intensified, including visits by Serbia and Montenegro Defense Minister Prvoslav Davinic to Zagreb and Croatian Foreign Minister Miomir Zuzul to Belgrade the week of May 24. May 28, 2004 Holkeri Resigns as Head of Kosovo's U.N. Mission Washington, D.C. - Hans Holkeri, the head of the U.N. Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK), resigned May 25 due to ill health after holding the job for less than one year. The 67-year-old former Finnish prime minister was the fourth person to serve in the position since June 1999, when the United Nations assumed administration of the Serbian province. Holkeri, appointed in July 2003, was criticized for his handling of the March 2004 clashes in the province between Albanians and ethnic Serbs that left 19 people dead and 900 injured, the worst outbreak of violence since June 1999. His one-year mandate would have expired in August. State Department Spokesman Richard Boucher stated that, under Holkeri's tenure, there had been substantial progress in Kosovo's effort to achieve a multi-ethnic democracy and a \"real dialogue with Belgrade over practical issues was launched.\" In addition, he said, \"standards before status,\" the democratic and human rights benchmarks that must be achieved before the final status of the province can be addressed, were developed and released. Boucher said these had all been important milestones in Kosovo's development. Until U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan appoints a successor, UNMIK will be headed by Holkeri's acting deputy, Charles Brayshaw. May 14, 2004 Foreign Minister Presents Kosovo Decentralization Proposal to U.S. Officials Washington, D.C. - The foreign minister of Serbia and Montenegro, Vuk Draskovic, met with Secretary of State Colin Powell in Washington to present the Serbian government's proposal for decentralization in Kosovo, which calls for granting Serb villages and enclaves \"high-level\" autonomy and a system of security that will encourage the 200,000 Serbs that fled the province in 1999 to return. Serbs now comprise 6 to 8 percent of Kosovo's population of about 1.9 million. According to the plan, an \"Autonomous Serb Community\" would be established in Kosovo through a U.N. Security Council resolution. Five Serb regions would be created with their own police, judiciary, and social organizations. Representatives of Serbia and Montenegro would join officials of UNMIK, the interim U.N. administration in Kosovo; Kosovar Albanians; and Kosovar Serbs in carrying out the process of setting up the Community. Draskovic, in his discussion with Powell, also urged the United States \"to eliminate the consequences of ethnic cleansing\" against Serbs in Kosovo that have occurred since the U.N. took over administration of the province in June 1999. He asked the U.S. to pressure the Security Council to assist Kosovar Serbs in the same way the international community helped Kosovar Albanians escape the repression of Slobodan Milosevic's regime before June 1999. In addition to the 200,000 Serbs that fled Kosovo, 40,000 Serb homes in the province have been destroyed and 150 Orthodox Christian churches and monasteries have been damaged or destroyed, he stated. The minister said Serbia must cooperate more fully with the international war crimes tribunal in The Hague immediately to promote the restoration of the \"traditional historical links\" between Belgrade and Washington. He said Powell had made it clear that there would be no further U.S. aid to Belgrade unless there were sufficient cooperation between Serbia and the tribunal, with the top priority being the arrest of former Bosnian Serb army commander Ratko Mladic, who is believed to be in Serbia. In addition, Draskovic said, Belgrade \"needs the U.S. to act as an honest broker to solve the Kosovo problem.\" The proposal for the Autonomous Serb Community was passed by Serbia's parliament in response to the March violence in Kosovo that killed 19 people, injured more than 1,000, and forced thousands of the remaining Serbs from their homes. The head of UNMIK, Harri Holkeri, referred to the violence as \"the most serious setback to UNMIK's efforts of the last five years.\" Holkeri added that \"it challenged the sustainability of the international community's efforts to build a multi-ethnic Kosovo where all citizens could live in peace and security.\" Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica and Holkeri have agreed that talks should begin on the proposed Serbian plan, while European Commissioner for External Relations Chris Patten, on a trip to Belgrade, said the plan was a good starting point for negotiations on Kosovo. Holkeri stated, however, that there was a wide gap between the proposals of UNMIK for the province and those of the Serbian government. Kosovo Prime Minister Bajram Rexhepi stated that Kosovar Albanians would never accept decentralization in the province based on ethnic principles, while a spokesman for Kosovo President Ibrahim Rugova said decentralization could be addressed after Kosovo gained independence. Draskovic stated that establishing security for Kosovar Serbs and eliminating the consequences of ethnic cleansing for this minority community constituted the cornerstone of \"standards before status,\" the rule of law, economic, and human rights benchmarks that the United Nations says must be achieved in Kosovo before its final status can be negotiated. The Security Council has urged the resumption of direct dialogue between Pristina and Belgrade. Draskovic said the governments of Serbia and Serbia and Montenegro are both ready to resume such a dialogue. During his U.S. visit, Draskovic also presented Serbia's proposal for decentralization and minority protection in Kosovo in meetings with Deputy National Security Advisor Stephen Hadley; Senator Richard Lugar (R-Indiana), chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee; Representative Christopher Smith (R-New Jersey), the co-chairman of the United States Helsinki Commission; and Senator Chuck Hegel (R-Nebraska), who is also on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. May 10, 2004 Chief Suspect Behind Djindjic Assassination Surrenders Washington, D.C. - Milorad Lukovic, believed to be the mastermind behind the March 2003 assassination of Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic, surrendered to Serbian authorities in Belgrade after evading capture for more than a year. The former commander of the Red Berets, a special operations unit of the Serbian secret police, has been linked to a Belgrade mafia group called the Zemun Clan, which is accused of planning and carrying out the murder of Djindjic in order to thwart the anti-crime reform he was undertaking and bring down his government. Known as \"Legija,\" Lukovic has already been on trial in absentia for six months in a Belgrade court for the killing of the prime minister, along with 13 alleged co-conspirators. April 2, 2004 U.S. Suspends Economic Aid to Serbia Washington, D.C. - Washington has decided to withhold the last $25 million of a $100 million assistance package for Serbia established three years ago, citing its belief that Belgrade is not fully cooperating with the United Nations international war crimes tribunal in The Hague. State Department spokesman Adam Ereli stated that Secretary of State Colin Powell was prepared to review the decision if Serbia extradited a number of war crimes suspects to the tribunal, particularly former Bosnian Serb commander Ratko Mladic, who is believed to be hiding in Serbia. Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica has said that handing over war crimes suspects to The Hague is not one of his government's priorities. April 2, 2004 U.S. Reaffirms Commitment to Kosovo Peace Process Following Violence Washington, D.C. - On a March 30 visit to Kosovo two weeks after a wave of violence killed 19 people and displaced some 3,600 Serbs, Undersecretary of State for Political Affairs Marc Grossman reaffirmed the international community's dedication to the vision of a multi-ethnic Kosovo and the plan to implement \"standards before status.\" The eight standards were first enumerated by the U.N. in spring 2002 to promote the achievement of benchmarks that must be established before the final status of the Serbian province can be considered. In December 2003, the U.N. drew up a more detailed outline of the standards, which are establishing functioning democratic institutions, the rule of law, freedom of movement, refugee returns, economic progress, respect for property rights, dialogue between Pristina and Belgrade, and a properly constituted Kosovo Protection Corps. (see attachement) Stating that the March 17-18 violence was unacceptable and must not be repeated, the undersecretary said the United States was prepared to promote the ongoing dialogue on decentralization in the province, which is envisaged in the U.N. implementation plan for Kosovo but has not been clearly defined. This decentralization would be expected to involve Serbs to a greater extent at the local level in matters such as health care, education, and security services, and would not promote the \"cantonization,\" or division, of the province along ethnic lines. Following the March violence, Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica reiterated the Serb government's call for decentralization in Kosovo. Kosovo Prime Minister Bajram Rexhepi, who condemned the anti-Serb violence, said his Albanian-dominated government was committed to achieving the eight standards by mid-2005, the date set for review of progress toward implementing them, in order to facilitate the launching of talks on the final status of Kosovo. Rexhepi's government has earmarked $6.1 million to reconstruct more than 800 houses, 29 churches and monasteries, and numerous public buildings damaged or destroyed during the March wave of violence. On March 31, Harri Holkeri, the head of the U.N. Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK), presented the Kosovo Standards Implementation Plan detailing specifically what local authorities must do to achieve the standards, while also setting a timeline for implementing each standard. (see attachment) Holkeri also set up a review body to examine the U.N. mission's response to the violence and issue recommendations on how to react more effectively to future crises. In Grossman's meeting in Belgrade with the head of the Serbian government's Coordinating Center for Kosovo, Nebojsa Covic, the Serb official said he doubted that it would be possible to create a multi-ethnic Kosovo and achieve the standards before personal safety for all citizens in the province had been secured. He advocated dividing the province along ethnic lines. March 26, 2004 EU Rejects Kostunica's Call for Autonomous Serb Regions in Kosovo Washington, D.C. - EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana rebuffed a proposal by Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica that separate regions for Serbs, or \"cantons,\" be established in Albanian-dominated Kosovo to ensure the security of the province's Serb minority and ward off the type of violence that erupted over a two-day period in mid-March, killing at least 28 people and injuring more than 600 from both communities. Solana told Kostunica, during the Serb leader's visit to Brussels, that his goal was to further the security of the Kosovar Serb community of about 100,000 within a multi-ethnic society. In a meeting with European Commission President Romano Prodi concerning the worst outbreak of violence in the province since it came under U.N. administration in 1999, Kostunica called for the decentralization of the administrative structure of the Serbian province to give Kosovar Serbs autonomous status within their enclaves. He asserted that such an arrangement would have no bearing on the final status of Kosovo, but was necessary to guarantee the safety of Serbs due to what he called \"inadequate\" measures on the part of the U.N. and NATO to protect the Serb population. Stating that the EU wanted to strengthen its ties with Belgrade, Prodi urged Kostunica and his government to actively work toward diffusing tensions in Kosovo. Kosovo President Ibrahim Rugova reiterated his call for Kosovo's independence from Serbia, asserting that only independence could bring peace, as well as accelerated economic development. The U.N. demands that a number of democratic standards be in place before negotiations on the final status of the province can begin, if possible by mid-2005. The week following the wave of violence, during which Albanians burned churches and houses, driving some 3,600 Serbs and other non-Albanians from their homes, Solana visited the province along with EU External Affairs Commissioner Chris Patten to commemorate the fifth anniversary of the start of the NATO bombing campaign that led to the withdrawal of Serbian forces from Kosovo. While in Kosovo, the EU officials examined ways of improving the safety of the Serb minority and promoting a resumption of the recently-initiated dialogue between Pristina and Belgrade. Solana stated that Kosovar Albanian political parties must purge themselves of extremists suspected of helping to foment anti-Serb violence. The week after the riots, which began when Albanians blamed Serbs for the deaths of three Albanian boys who drowned in a river in the divided northern town of Kosovska Mitrovica, a U.N. policeman from Ghana and his Kosovar Albanian partner were killed near the village of Luzane, north of Pristina. In addition, two French peacekeepers were wounded in a grenade attack in Kosovska Mitrovica. As a result of the violence, the U.S., Britain, France, Germany, Italy, and other NATO allies rushed in a total of 2,000 troops to reinforce the 18,500-member KFOR peacekeeping force and 10,000 U.N. and local police. Sixty-one KFOR soldiers and 55 police officers were wounded in the riots. The situation posed a potential setback in Washington's efforts to reduce the number of U.S. peacekeepers in the Balkans in order to redeploy them to Iraq, Afghanistan, and elsewhere. Greece appealed to the Albanians and Serbs of Kosovo to hold talks on the future of the province. Foreign Ministry spokesman Giorgios Koumoutsakos said dialogue between the two ethnic groups constituted the only means of solving the complicated problems of the province. Greece, as a Balkan country and an EU member, he said, was prepared to help substantially in the economic development and stability of Kosovo. Macedonian Prime Minister Branko Crvenkovski said there was \"no indication that the events in Kosovo could spill over into Macedonia,\" three years after it experienced its own ethnic conflict. Albanian Prime Minister Fatos Nano said the unrest in Kosovo was \"the result of keeping alive parallel administrative or paramilitary structures that continue to support ethnic isolation or promote new waves of [ethnic] cleansing in order to divide Kosovo.\" Bulgarian Foreign Minister Solomon Passy, who is serving as chairman-in-office of the OSCE under Bulgaria's 2004 presidency of the organization, stated that the violence in Kosovo had set back the process of resolving Kosovo's final status. He called on NATO to consider deploying more troops to the province. The violence in Kosovo was accompanied by the burning of two mosques and the destruction of an Islamic center in cities in Serbia. March 12, 2004 Serbian Court Tries First Major War Crimes Case Washington, D.C. - Serbia has begun trying its first major war crimes case in a special court established in Belgrade in June 2003 to handle the trials of war crimes suspects locally. The case, dating to 1991, involves six Serbs accused of executing 192 Croats who had taken refuge in a hospital in Vukovar, Croatia. The trial is seen as a critical test of the Serbian government's ability to try lower-level war crimes cases at home, with the permission and monitoring of the U.N. war crimes tribunal in The Hague, instead of at the U.N. tribunal. The accused face maximum sentences of up to 20 years if convicted. Three officers of the former Yugoslav People's Army, who allegedly ordered or permitted the executions of the Croats to take place, are being tried in The Hague. March 5, 2004 Kostunica Names New Cabinet Washington, D.C. - Presenting the 18-member cabinet of his minority government to parliament for approval, Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica pledged to promote the membership of Serbia and Montenegro in the European Union, establish the rule of law, fight corruption, and work to prevent Kosovo from declaring independence, while also calling for the division, or cantonization, of the province along ethnic lines to enhance the security of its Serb population. Although the reformist coalition of Kostunica's Democratic Party of Serbia (DSS), Miroljub Labus's G17 Plus, and Vuk Draskovic's Serbian Renewal Movement/New Serbia alliance are dependent upon the votes of the ultra-nationalist Socialist Party of Slobodan Milosevic in parliament to achieve a majority, no Socialists have been named to cabinet posts. Kostunica's party has nine posts, the G17 Plus holds four, and four portfolios went to Draskovic's alliance. Labus was appointed the only deputy prime minister and is in charge of European integration. Both Labus, who served as Yugoslav deputy prime minister when Kostunica was Yugoslav president, and the G17's Mladjan Dinkic, who has become Serbian finance minister, are highly respected economists. Dinkic formerly served as the governor of the National Bank of Serbia, the republic's central bank. Kostunica reiterated his view that Serbia's new government would seek to have war crimes suspects indicted by the U.N. war crimes tribunal in The Hague tried before domestic courts and would attempt to make arrangements with the tribunal to have those convicted in The Hague serve their sentences in Serbia. In the past, the tribunal has stated that it would only allow mid- and low-level cases to be transferred back to Serbian courts. Some 15 Serbs indicted by the tribunal are believed to be in Serbia. A senior official of the Socialist Party, Milorad Vucelic, stated that the party would \"immediately work on bringing down the government\" if it extradited more Serbs to The Hague. Vucelic also said that a second condition for the party's support of the government would be that \"those who kidnapped Milosevic and illegally sent him to The Hague be put on trial.\" Zoran Djindjic, Serbia's late prime minister, engineered the extradition of Milosevic to The Hague in June 2001 with the cooperation of Serbia's security forces. Kostunica, then president of Yugoslavia, has always maintained that the extradition was unconstitutional. The U.S. Congress has specified that former Bosnian military chief Ratko Mladic, a top war crimes suspect sought by the tribunal, should be arrested and extradited to the court by March 31 if Belgrade is to receive $100 million in U.S. aid allocated for fiscal year 2004. Prosecutors at the tribunal claim that Mladic is in Serbia. Pierre-Richard Prosper, U.S. Ambassador-At-Large for War Crimes Issues, stated that the Serbian government's reluctance to cooperate with the tribunal may jeopardize the U.S. aid package. \"The level of cooperation at this moment is not satisfactory,\" he said. Prosper noted that Washington was concerned about statements coming out of Belgrade that gave the impression the government was in the process of \"making a U-turn.\" U.S. Ambassador to NATO Nicholas Burns stated that Serbia and Montenegro would not be able to join the alliance's Partnership for Peace (PfP) as long as Mladic remained at large. Belgrade had been hoping to join the PfP, considered a stepping stone to membership in NATO, at the alliance's summit in Istanbul in June. February 27, 2004 Serbian Government Formed With Support of Ultra-Nationalist Socialists Washington, D.C. - The leader of the conservative Democratic Party of Serbia, Vojislav Kostunica, was named Serbian prime minister, following the formation of a minority coalition that will depend on the parliamentary support of the ultra-nationalist Socialist Party, whose leader officially remains indicted war crimes suspect Slobodan Milosevic. The move ended a deadlock in cobbling together a government that began after parliamentary elections were held on December 28, but it put into question the prospects for a stable, lasting coalition. The pro-democracy coalition of three parties sought the support of the Socialists after the Democratic Party (DP) of former prime ministers Zoran Djindjic and Zoran Zivkovic withdrew its initial commitment to take part in the coalition, leaving it without a majority in parliament. The DP, which will remain the main center-left force in Serbia despite its absence from the government, is now led by Boris Tadic, the defense minister of Serbia and Montenegro, who is viewed as a moderate. In the new government, Kostunica’s party will be joined by the G17 Plus of liberal economist Miroljub Labus and the Serbian Renewal Movement/New Serbia alliance, led by Vuk Draskovic, a former deputy prime minister. These three groupings will have 109 deputies in the 250-member parliament. The backing of the Socialist Party’s 22 deputies will give the government a majority, though the Socialists will not take an active part in the new cabinet. Officials in the United States and the European Union, as well as investors, have expressed concern over the pivotal role the Socialists will play in the minority government. EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana said it would cause the government to experience difficulty in its political and economic relations with the international community. Serbia has come under international pressure to continue handing over Serb war crimes suspects to the U.N. war crimes tribunal in The Hague, a key condition for Western aid. Kostunica stated that he was against extraditing four Serbian generals indicted last year by the tribunal, saying he might negotiate with the court to allow Serbia’s courts to try them. Serbia has been operating on interim financing because parliament has not yet passed the 2004 budget due to the long delay in forming a government. The World Bank issued a list of 40 laws it said Serbia must adopt before the end of the year if it wanted to receive badly needed international donor aid. It gave the Serb parliament one month to pass 10 of the laws, including those concerning the budget, business registration, bankruptcy, value-added tax, and energy. February 20, 2004 U.S. Seeks Expanded Economic Cooperation with Belgrade Washington, D.C. - Undersecretary of State for Economic, Business, and Agricultural Affairs Alan P. Larson said the United States was eager to expand and strengthen its relationship with Belgrade but, to do this, it was essential that Serbia emerge from its period of political uncertainty \"with a clear, firm recommitment to this partnership.\" The undersecretary's remark was a reference to the deadlock in forming a Serbian government, which has continued since the December 28 parliamentary elections. Larson noted that Serbia's political leaders must \"overcome the divisiveness that has inhibited the pace of badly needed economic reforms\" in order to achieve the success realized by countries such as Poland, the Czech Republic, and Hungary. He also cited the need for Belgrade's full cooperation with the international war crimes tribunal in The Hague. The undersecretary stated that, in view of Washington's decision to restore Normal Trade Relations (NTR) with Belgrade in December 2003, the U.S. is taking the steps necessary to initiate a formal review of Serbia and Montenegro's possible eligibility for greater trade benefits. February 13, 2004 U.N. Targets \"Standards Before Status\" Process as Core Goal Washington, D.C. - Harri Holkeri, the head of the U.N. mission in Kosovo (UNMIK), told the Security Council during a February 6 briefing that implementation of the eight benchmarks that must be met before the question of the final status of Kosovo can be addressed constituted the \"core political project\" for UNMIK. The process of achieving these benchmarks, or standards, laid out by UNMIK in April 2002, is known as \"standards before status.\" The issues comprising the standards are establishing functioning democratic institutions, the rule of law, freedom of movement, the return of refugees, economic progress, respect for property rights, dialogue between Pristina and Belgrade, and a properly constituted Kosovo Protection Corps. Holkeri said the most urgent task was to produce an implementation work plan that would clearly define the actions necessary to achieve the standards. He noted that he was disappointed that no Serb representatives had participated in the working groups discussing the implementation of the standards. Holkeri added that the Serbs' concern that the standards process was prejudging Kosovo's future status and was undermining Security Council Resolution 1244, which authorized Kosovo's international interim administration in June 1999, was \"wholly unfounded.\" He stated that the Serbs' perception that their interests would be sidelined during the implementation of the standards was not accurate. Zeljko Perovic, the assistant foreign minister of Serbia and Montenegro, said that the Albanian-dominated Provisional Institutions of Self-Government in Kosovo did not want to create conditions for the meaningful involvement of the Kosovo Serb community in the political life of the province. In addition, he said, UNMIK had not succeeded in creating these conditions. He noted that Serb representatives did not see how they could influence the formulation of the work plan for implementing the standards, so they had not participated in the working groups. A review of the progress made toward meeting the standards is expected to take place mid-2005. February 13, 2004 Hague Tribunal Alleges that Karadzic is in Serbia Washington, D.C. - The Serbian government denied allegations by U.N. chief war crimes prosecutor Carla del Ponte that top war crimes suspect Radovan Karadzic, the former Bosnian Serb leader, is living in Belgrade. It was the first time a senior tribunal official had said that Karadzic was in the Serbian capital. Serbia's caretaker prime minister, Zoran Zivkovic, said del Ponte had never given information or any other kind of help that would lead to locating or capturing Karadzic or former Bosnian Serb commander Ratko Mladic, whom the prosecutor has, in the past, also said lives in Serbia. Belgrade has denied that Mladic is in Serbia. Del Ponte stated that cooperation between the Serbian government and the tribunal in tracking down war crimes fugitives was \"frozen,\" noting that about 15 fugitives were still at large in Serbia. She referred to Belgrade as a \"safe haven\" for war crimes fugitives. In March, the U.S. Congress is expected to decide whether Serbia will receive annual United States aid worth about $100 million. The decision is conditional on the Serb government's cooperation with the tribunal. January 30, 2004 Pro-Reform Coalition Formed in Serbia Washington, D.C. - Following a month-long deadlock in attempts to form a government in Serbia, the republic’s four pro-democracy reform parties have agreed to establish a coalition that will be represented by 146 of the 250 seats in parliament. The new coalition brings together the conservative Democratic Party of Serbia led by former Yugoslav president Vojislav Kostunica, the Democratic Party of caretaker prime minister Zoran Zivkovic, the G-17 Plus of economist Miroljub Labus, and the Serbian Renewal Movement-New Serbia alliance headed by former Yugoslav deputy prime minister Vuk Draskovic. Kostunica is expected to be named prime minister. Discussions are continuing to work out the details of the coalition agreement, including the composition of the cabinet and the appointment of the speaker of parliament, who will also serve as acting president of Serbia until new presidential elections are held. The extreme nationalist Serbian Radical Party, led by indicted war crimes suspect Vojislav Seselj, who awaits trial at the international war crimes tribunal in The Hague, and Slobodan Milosevic’s Socialist Party of Serbia will comprise the opposition, with a total of 104 seats. The Serbian Radical Party, with 82 seats, has the largest representation in parliament. Parliamentary elections were held in Serbia on December 28. December 30, 2003 Hardline Nationalists Emerge as Strong Force in Serbian Parliament Washington, D.C. - Two extreme nationalist parties, led by indicted war crimes suspects Slobodan Milosevic and Vojislav Seselj, took a combined 41 percent of the seats in the Serbian parliament in the republic's December 28 elections, presenting a strong opposition bloc that could hinder reform efforts by four pro-democracy parties expected to form a government. These parties won 59 percent of the seats. The party winning the most parliamentary seats, 81, was the Serbian Radical Party of Seselj, who is in custody at the international war crimes tribunal in The Hague, but not yet on trial. Milosevic's Socialist Party of Serbia won 21 seats. The former Yugoslav president has been on trial at the tribunal since February 2002. Though Milosevic and Seselj were both parliamentary candidates, neither will be able to take his seat. The party garnering the second-largest number of seats, 52, was the conservative Democratic Party of Serbia (DSS) led by former Yugoslav president Vojislav Kostunica, who succeeded Milosevic. The party pulled out of the post-Milosevic Democratic Opposition of Serbia (DOS) reform coalition following policy differences with its other parties, particularly the coalition's lead party, the centrist Democratic Party, currently headed by the recent Serbian prime minister, Zoran Zivkovic. DOS dissolved in November 2003 following months of internal feuding. Kostunica's DSS is expected to play the lead role in forming a pro-democracy government. This will necessitate fence-mending with the Democratic Party, the third-largest vote-getter, with 38 seats, and negotiating with the two other centrist, pro-democracy parliamentary groups: the G-17 Plus of economist Miroljub Labus, with 34 seats, and the Serbian Renewal Movement-New Serbia alliance headed by former Yugoslav deputy prime minister Vuk Draskovic, with 23 seats. The latter alliance supports restoration of the monarchy. Kostunica, who is considered the most likely new prime minister, favors a slower pace for reforms, particularly economic changes, than that advocated by Zivkovic and the late Serbian prime minister Zoran Djindjic, fearing their social impact. There is speculation that international pressure on Belgrade for the extradition of indicted war crimes suspects to The Hague contributed to the strong turnout for the Serbian Radical Party, which tripled its number of seats in parliament. Other possible factors were the political infighting that characterized the DOS coalition government, disappointment with the results of Western-oriented economic and political changes in the republic, where unemployment stands at 30 percent, and alleged government corruption. The Serbian Radical Party has openly called for a \"Greater Serbia\" and has pledged to cut diplomatic ties with Croatia, its wartime rival in the 1990s. In addition, it has vowed not to extradite to The Hague the two most-wanted war crimes suspects: former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic and wartime commander of the Bosnian Serb army Ratko Mladic. December 19, 2003 Former NATO Commander Wesley Clark Testifies at Milosevic's Trial Washington, D.C. - Retired General Wesley Clark, the commander of NATO when the alliance bombed Serbia in 1999 in an attempt to halt the repression of Kosovar Albanians by Serb forces, testified on December 15 and 16 at former Yugoslav president Slobodan Milosevic's trial at the international war crimes tribunal in The Hague. Gen. Clark told the tribunal that Milosevic knew in advance that Bosnian Serbs planned to carry out mass killings of Muslims in Srebrenica in 1995, testimony that prosecutors said was crucial to their case against the former Yugoslav president. They said they wanted to prove that he had \"command responsibility\" for \"ethnic cleansing.\" Both Milosevic and wartime Bosnian Serb army commander Ratko Mladic, who is still at large, are charged with the Srebrenica massacre. Gen. Clark spent more than 100 hours over a period of about four years in meetings with Milosevic, culminating with his participation in talks attempting to persuade Serbia to end its 1998-1999 campaign against Kosovar Albanians. He discussed the Srebrenica massacre with Milosevic a month after it happened and worked on the negotiating team that drew up the 1995 Dayton accords ending the war in Bosnia. The general, who is a candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination, presented his testimony behind closed doors under strict conditions agreed upon by the tribunal and Washington. The U.S. allowed him to testify on condition that American officials would be able to review the recording and transcript of the testimony before it was made public so that they could ask the court to suppress any information considered to be harmful to U.S. security interests. In addition, the public gallery was cleared, and television monitors and the Internet broadcast were turned off. Milosevic has been on trial since February 2002, charged with genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes in Croatia, Bosnia, and Kosovo in the 1990s. December 19, 2003 Privatization Moves Forward in Kosovo Washington, D.C. - The first four contracts to privatize publicly owned companies in Kosovo, referred to as \"Socially Owned Enterprises,\" have been approved by the board of directors of the Kosovo Trust Agency (KTA), the entity appointed by the U.N. interim administration in the Serbian province to handle the privatization process. In addition, the board asked the KTA to negotiate 13 other privatization contracts so that they can be signed. Nineteen enterprises will also be newly offered for privatization. The measures taken by the KTA's board of directors constitute a major step forward in Kosovo's economic development and transformation into a market economy. December 12, 2003 U.N. Releases Road Map for Reform Standards in Kosovo Washington, D.C. - The head of the U.N. interim administration in Kosovo (UNMIK), Harri Holkeri, unveiled a document setting the standards that must be met in areas such as the return of ethnic minority refugees, human rights, economic reform, and the rule of law before the final status of the Serbian province can be considered. The progress made in achieving these standards will be reviewed by the U.N. in mid-2005 to determine Kosovo's readiness to open talks about its final status. The province's Albanian majority seeks independence from Serbia, while the minority Serbs want to see it remain part of the republic. The Serbian government declared the document \"unacceptable in its current form as a way to solve the Kosovo crisis,\" adding that \"essentially none of the objections and suggestions\" made by Belgrade had been \"seriously considered.\" The standards, it said, did not guarantee security for the people of Kosovo. Key amendments proposed by Belgrade involved the protection of Serbia's cultural heritage in the province, the dissolution of the Kosovo Protection Corps, refugee returns, property restitution, and privatization. The majority Albanian leadership in Kosovo stated that the standards in the document could not be achieved under current Serbian laws in effect in the province. The day after the standards were announced, the Kosovo Assembly voted to repeal all legislation on Kosovo passed by the Serbian parliament from March 1989 until June 1999, during the rule of former Yugoslav president Slobodan Milosevic, stating that this legislation was discriminatory and lacked legitimacy. Holkeri overturned the decision, stating that such a move was \"not within the jurisdiction\" of the Kosovo Assembly. A spokeswoman for the U.N. interim administration said that determining which laws apply in Kosovo is the sole responsibility of the head of UNMIK. December 5, 2003 Milosevic, Seselj to Run in Serb Parliamentary Elections Washington, D.C. - Former Yugoslav president Slobodan Milosevic, currently on trial in The Hague on charges of genocide and crimes against humanity in Croatia, Bosnia, and Kosovo, will run in Serbia's parliamentary elections on December 28 at the top of his party's slate. Milosevic was defeated as Yugoslav president in the September 2000 elections. Milosevic will be the second prominent detainee of the international war crimes tribunal to run for the Serbian parliament, following the candidacy of ultra-nationalist Radical Party leader Vojislav Seselj, whose trial has not yet begun. Seselj, accused of war crimes in Bosnia and Croatia, will also head the list of his party, whose candidate, Tomislav Nikolic, received the most votes in the November 16 Serbian presidential election, which was annulled due to insufficient voter turnout. There are no legal obstacles to the candidacies of these indictees, since they have been charged for crimes but have not yet been convicted. However, they cannot assume elective office if they are in detention at the tribunal. The head of the Council of Europe Parliamentary Assembly, Peter Schieder, expressed concern over the presence of indicted war crimes suspects among Serbia's parliamentary candidates. He said the fact that these indictees head their parties' election tickets sends a negative message to the international community and “encourages a groundswell of nationalism and conflict.” The parliamentary elections pose the first challenge to the reform parties that defeated Milosevic in 2000. The Democratic Opposition of Serbia (DOS) reform coalition disbanded in November following 18 months of infighting. November 24, 2003 Third Attempt to Elect Serb President Fails in Lead-Up to Parliamentary Elections Washington, D.C. - The failure of Serbia's November 16 attempt to elect a president, the third annulled presidential election in 13 months due to voter turnout under 50 percent, was significant not only because it reflected continued voter apathy, but also because the front-runner was a nationalist, anti-Western ally of former Yugoslav president Slobodan Milosevic rather than a pro-reform candidate. Radical Party deputy leader Tomislav Nikolic, receiving 46.2 percent of the vote, is a protégé of Vojislav Seselj, the founder of the party, which was previously in a coalition with Milosevic's Socialist Party of Serbia. Seselj is in jail in The Hague awaiting trial on war crimes charges at the international tribunal. The Radical Party opposes cooperation with the tribunal and with NATO. Dragoljub Micunovic, the speaker of the federal parliament of Serbia and Montenegro who was backed by the pro-Western, pro-reform 18-party Democratic Opposition of Serbia (DOS) coalition that has governed Serbia for the last three years, garnered 35.4 percent of the vote. Previous high-profile presidential candidates of the main opposition parties, former Yugoslav president Vojislav Kostunica of the Democratic Party of Serbia and Miroljub Labus, the leader of the G17 Plus party, did not run and called for a boycott of the election, stating that early parliamentary elections should be scheduled instead due to the infighting and allegations of corruption within the DOS coalition. Kostunica had been the front-runner in both the October 2002 and the December 2002 failed presidential elections, while Labus had polled the second-largest number of votes in both. Although the call for a boycott by Kostunica and Labus may have kept more moderate voters from going to the polls, Nikolic's strong showing was jarring to the pro-reform forces in Serbia and to Western countries backing the republic's reform process a little more than a month before the Serbian parliamentary elections on December 28, one year ahead of schedule. The elections were called on November 13, when the Serb parliament was dissolved after the defection of two minor parties from DOS left the coalition without a majority. Following the poor showing of the DOS-backed candidate in the presidential election, the grouping, which has held together precariously since defeating Milosevic in October 2000, announced that it was disbanding. The dissolution of parliament also caused Acting Serb President Natasa Micic, the parliament speaker, to step down. The absence of a Serb president leaves the federal Supreme Defense Council of Serbia and Montenegro, which governs the country's military, without one of its three core members. The core members of the Council are the president of Serbia and Montenegro, the Serbian president, and the Montenegrin president. The Council also holds broader sessions, which are attended by the minister of defense of Serbia and Montenegro, the chief of staff of the military, and the prime ministers of both republics. The Council was established following the formation of the loose union of Serbia and Montenegro in February 2003, when civilian control of the military was implemented. It has overseen significant progress in the reform of the country's military. Serbia's last elected president was Milan Milutinovic. He assumed office while Milosevic was the president of Yugoslavia and surrendered to The Hague on war crimes charges following the expiration of his term on December 29, 2002, when Micic took over as acting president. Milutinovic, as an indicted war crimes suspect, carried out practically no presidential duties from the time of Milosevic's ouster in October 2000 until he left office. A fourth presidential election cannot be held until a new Serb parliament is in place at the end of December. November 18, 2003 Donor Co-ordination Meeting for the State Union of Serbia and Montenegro Brussels - Co-Chaired by the European Commission and the World Bank Chairs’ Conclusions Representatives from 37 countries and 14 international organisations met in Brussels November 18, 2003 for a Donor Co-ordination meeting for the State Union of Serbia and Montenegro. This meeting was convened by the European Commission and the World Bank in the context of their overall donor co-ordination responsibilities for South East Europe. The meeting was co-chaired by Mr. Reinhard Priebe, Director, Western Balkans, European Commission and Ms. Orsalia Kalantzopoulos, Country Director and Regional Co-ordinator for Southeast Europe, the World Bank. The delegation from Serbia and Montenegro was led by Mr. Branko Lukovac, Minister for External Economic Relations, and included for the Republic of Serbia Mr. Goran Pitic, Minister of International Economic Relations, Mr. Bozidar Djelic, Minister of Finance and Economy, Ms. Gordana Matkovic, Minister for Social Affairs and Mr. Ozren Tosic, Commissioner for Refugees and Displaced Persons of Serbia; for the Republic of Montenegro Ms. Slavica Milacic, Minister of Foreign Economic Relations and European Integration, Mr. Slavoljub Stjepovic, Minister of Labour and Social Affairs, Mr. Slobodan Backovic, Minister of Science and Education. The meeting heard and discussed presentations by Serbia and Montenegro, the European Commission, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund on the progress achieved in stabilising the political and economic situation and on the challenges ahead in sustaining a viable reform path towards EU integration. Participants congratulated the authorities on the significant progress achieved to date and their commitment to continue with the implementation of the reform agenda. While noting that some momentum has been lost during the past 18 months, they urged the authorities to stay on track. Donors reaffirmed their readiness to strongly support Serbia and Montenegro on the path of democratic and economic reform and EU integration. They recalled that a stable institutional framework is the key to enhancing economic development and to attracting investments. They encouraged all political parties to demonstrate a high degree of responsibility to ensure that the current political situation does not become an obstacle to the acceleration of the reform process. The political framework Since the launch of the Economic Recovery and Transition Program (ERTP) at the donor conference of June 2001, the constitutional framework of Serbia and Montenegro has changed. Following the adoption of the Constitutional Charter, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia became the State Union of Serbia and Montenegro. The authorities confirmed that the relations of Serbia and Montenegro with the European Union are a high priority on their political and economic agenda. The European Commission is assessing the readiness of Serbia and Montenegro to negotiate a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the European Union. This will include a review of the full and continued respect for political conditions - democratic standards and institutions, the rule of law and fight against corruption and organised crime, respect of human rights, full respect of international obligations and co-operation with the International Crime Tribunal for Yugoslavia (ICTY), and the need for further market e"
