        "text": "Alzheimer disease, unlike conditions like hypertension, must speak to be diagnosed. For much of the 20th century, diagnosis required a person to recount a story of their own or their loved one’s disabling cognitive impairments or dementia. The 21st century discovery of mild cognitive impairment relaxed the criteria for disability diagnosis. Persons experiencing simple inefficiencies in performing their usual and everyday activities could be diagnosed with Alzheimer disease. Spectacular advances in biomarker technologies measuring β-amyloid and hyperphosphorylated tau proteins, together with neurodegeneration, the 2 pathological hallmarks of the disease, show promise that someday, perhaps quite soon, persons who do not have any measurable cognitive impairments could be diagnosed with Alzheimer disease. This study by Caprioglio et al1 for the European Amyloid Imaging to Prevent Alzheimer Disease initiative, known as AMYPAD, reports their efforts to explain what this novel clinical practice might be like.\n\nCaprioglio and colleagues1 report that telling a person with subjective cognitive decline that their brain has elevated levels of β-amyloid was not associated with notable increases in measures of anxiety or depression. Subjective cognitive decline describes a kind of liminal existence; a person is neither healthy nor impaired. Definitions vary, unfortunately, but the study by Caprioglio et al1 described a person with at least 5 years of bothersome cognitive problems whose metric assessments of cognition showed no impairments.\n\nHowever, knowledge of elevated amyloid was not benign. It was associated with increases of scores on the Impact of Events Scale, a measure of the distress precipitated by witnessing a traumatic event. Persons endorsed a host of behaviors and moods, such as feeling preoccupied or distracted with the information and seeking to avoid the topic. This finding recapitulates similar studies of β-amyloid disclosure.2\n\nPersons who learned a test result that their β-amyloid levels were not elevated did not report having any of these experiences.3 They uniformly describe one feeling: relief. Their mind at ease, they reinterpreted their cognitive problems as normal aging. The event fades and is soon forgotten.\n\nIn contrast, persons with elevated β-amyloid levels experienced a change of mind. They reported an increase in their estimated lifetime risk of developing dementia. They wanted metric data, not just a report of elevated β-amyloid.4 Some individuals developed a preoccupation with their future.5 They think over plans for retirement, leisure, and living arrangements with attention to proximity to friends and family. Concerns of stigma and discrimination may cause them to consider with whom they may share the result.\n\nThe AMYPAD consortium recruited persons with a positive biomarker test result for drug studies seeking an intervention to prevent or delay the onset of cognitive impairments caused by neurodegenerative diseases. Prevention is inspiring. This is the primary goal of the US national Alzheimer plan, after all: to discover treatments that will effectively prevent these diseases.\n\nShould one of these clinical trials succeed, disclosing Alzheimer disease biomarker results to persons with subjective cognitive decline will move from clinical research into clinical practice. A drug that reduces the risk of dementia ought to palliate the adverse feelings associated with learning one is at risk of dementia, but short of a cure for each and every disease of the aging brain, people will need to live with their risk of transitioning from subjective to objective cognitive impairments. They are going to need care. But what should it look like?\n\nStudies of the impact of learning Alzheimer biomarker information describe the features of this care. The participants in the AMYPAD study1 received care at a memory center where they received expert education about Alzheimer disease and β-amyloid. They underwent assessments of their mood and well-being. The test result was disclosed in the context of a relationship with a clinician with expectations of follow-up. Presumably, persons whose Impact of Events score was sufficiently elevated received additional follow-up.\n\nOften, another person, such as a friend or family member, was present at these visits. In Alzheimer disease research, this person is called a study partner. In Alzheimer clinical practice, they are typically called a caregiver or care partner. For persons with subjective cognitive decline, nomenclature is a work in progress. They are sometimes called precaregivers, but that term is at least odd.6 Supporter gets closer to the mark. Whatever the name, a person who knows they are at risk of developing dementia ought to have others involved in their life. These people will monitor them and to help them plan how to manage problems performing activities of daily living.\n\nNotably, the AMYPAD investigators1 report Impact of Event scores were higher in persons who had a study partner present. This result makes sense. Knowledge of a biomarker that increases one’s lifetime risk of developing disabling cognitive impairments is an important event not only for the person with elevated β-amyloid levels but also the people who might be expected to care for that person.7 They experience the event much like the person who has elevated β-amyloid levels. One can imagine these people talking about and even struggling with the information. Alzheimer disease affects 1 brain and at least 2 minds: the patient and their caregiver.\n\nTo help these minds make sense of and live with this life event, they will all need care. It should begin with having sufficient space and chairs in the examination room for at least 2 people. There, they should meet with a variety of clinicians, such as social workers, skilled in talking about the things that make a life well lived. These conversations could guide patients and their caregivers to think about who to share results with and how to plan for their futures. In the months to follow, if they feel a sense of direction and purpose in their lives, if they enjoy making plans and working to make them a reality, we can conclude they have received quality care.\n\nBack to top\n\nArticle Information\n\nPublished: January 13, 2023. doi:10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2022.50938\n\nOpen Access: This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the CC-BY License. © 2023 Karlawish J.
