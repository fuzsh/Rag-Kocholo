At the workshop, our interns had the opportunity to learn how aircraft are constructed, how they fly and how their main parts work. They also learned about the way Air Serbia Technical is organized, how new aircraft are introduced into the fleet, and how aircraft are painted. ✔️ After the workshop, the interns visited a small and a large hangar, where they learnt about how the work in the hangars is organized. A special treat was the visit to one of our regional ATR aircraft, which is currently undergoing maintenance, where the interns had the opportunity to enter the cockpit. This visit organised by Air Serbia HR team in cooperation with Technical was extremely educational and inspiring for our interns, providing them with an insight into the daily activities and challenges faced by our technical team. 🍀 We look forward to future workshops and continued successful cooperation! #TakeOff #AirSerbia #SummerPractice #Technical #Aviation #Training #Interns\n\n🌟👩✈️ In the Air Serbia cockpit, there are ever more women in the positions of captain and first officer.
