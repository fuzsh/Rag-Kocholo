Think about their literal and symbolic meaning. Think about them coming to life. Yvette Helin’s “Pedestrian Project” consists of various performers in generic, all-black costumes interacting with the public. This 9-minute video collage starts with the costumes being created, sewn, and fitted in Helin’s Williamsburg, Brooklyn studio. It continues with footage from live performances in New York City from 1990-1996, with the Peds walking and standing statuesquely to engage with people in downtown NYC on Broadway, Wall Street and environs, and concludes with footage from the 1990 performance at Franklin Furnace’s basement black box theatre in TriBeCa. Inspired by mass-produced public signs, Helin’s ongoing “Pedestrian Project” comments on and satirizes social norms and conventions. Film by Carlton Bright, John Groh, Andrew Guidone, Scott Seraydarian and Yvette Helin. Music by Yvette Helin.

Katya Grokhovsky, Ana Mendieta, FF Alumns, at EFA Project Space, Manhattan, opening Sept. 9\n\nThe Immigrant Artist Biennial 2020: Here, Together!\n\nOn View: September 9–October 24, 2020\n\nReservations Required\n\nHours: W-F, 10:30 am–6:30 pm\n\nVirtual Opening Reception: Wednesday, September 9, 6–9 pm [via Zoom]\n\nArtists: Blanka Amezkua, Esperanza Cortés, Bahareh Khoshooee, Daniela Kostova, Cole Lu, Ana Mendieta, Levan Mindiashvili, Qinza Najm, Anna Parisi, daàPò réo, Yali Romagoza\n\nCurated by Katya Grokhovsky\n\nEFA Project Space is thrilled to present The Immigrant Artist Biennial 2020: Here, Together! a timely exhibition featuring multidisciplinary works by eleven New York-based Immigrant artists, curated by Katya Grokhovsky. Initially postponed by the COVID crisis, Here, Together! explores displacement, alienation, and the steady erosion of American Empire.\n\nConfronting a national rhetoric of exclusion, nationalism, and discrimination, the artists in the exhibition call for urgent unity, visibility, and criticality, by facilitating a necessary platform of cultural exchange. Against the backdrop of a global pandemic, and culminating on the eve of a fraught election, the exhibition draws attention to the intertwined issues of immigration and the engineered neglect of othered bodies. In her curatorial statement, Grokhovsky writes: “These artists call forth the power dynamics and hierarchies of a late-stage struggling capitalist society in dire need of compassion and humanity. Their work grapples with issues of identity, the meaning of home and place, and the consistent, looming threats of erasure, removal, and cultural whitewashing.”\n\nBorn in Mexico, Blanka Amezkua often works with traditional portable materials such as paper and fabric flowers, deconstructing and shaping them into expansive wall based patterns and mosaics, examining the dynamics of cultural erasure and visibility in the process.\n\nEsperanza Cortés explores the historical and cultural mosaic of the Americas and the Caribbean, reworking found objects with painstaking and labor intensive detail to capture cultural symbols that act as sites of memory, implementing the human body as a symbol and expression of vulnerability and power dynamics.\n\nIn her work, #Everchangingfacade (2019), Iranian artist Bahareh Khoshooee activates the multifaceted and multidimensional concept of migrant identity formation through Internet sourced and technological fragmentations, filling the gaps of re-imagined self with collaged fictional memories and alternative facts.\n\nDaniela Kostova’s work, Body Without Organs: Bulgarian Bar (2006) is a documentary video which follows the “discovery” of the infamous Bulgarian Bar through the eyes of an immigrant artist in New York City. Kostova interprets the bar and her relationship to it as a place of cultural refuge for a particular immigrant experience, manifested through Gypsy-Punk music.\n\nCole Lu’s work employs myths and speculative futures to explore exile as the only possible state, in which the body can exist without borders of time, space and autobiography. Beasts, body parts and doors to other dimensions and centuries co-exist to manifest and shape a re-invented, improved fluid existence.\n\nAna Mendieta’s early and lesser-known video work, Parachute (1973), explores Mendieta’s role as an educator and a facilitator of knowledge and experience. The video presents the idea of imaginative play, human togetherness, and ultimate alienation through the use of a parachute as a gathering device of a student body.\n\nGeorgian-born artist Levan Mindiashvili’s window installation celebrates and honors the author James Baldwin and the artist Felix Gonzalez Torres, as significant cultural American catalysts for social change. Referencing Baldwin’s Giovanni’s Room (1956)—a seminal book in the history of queer literature—the work explores issues of race, colonial history, and class inequality through the lens of an Immigrant living in contemporary USA.\n\nQinza Najm’s painted figure on carpet, a ubiquitous object in households across much of the Middle East, stretches to fulfill roles and expectations and alternately presents an act of empowerment. The figure expands to dominate the carpet’s area, appearing and disappearing in an uneasy equilibrium with the background, suggesting the multitudes contained within an individual.\n\nBrazilian-born artist Anna Parisi employs carefully sourced materials and historical facts, narratives and folklore to investigate the trauma and experiences of oppressed bodies. Parisi addresses questions of structural racism, white privilege, xenophobia, hegemonies, and colonialism through mixed media works on paper.\n\nNigerian-born artist daàPò réo boldly tackles the concepts of borders, walls, and restrictions of global migration through a participatory installation in which a hand crafted flag and barbed wire structure welcomes the viewer into the exhibition as an imagined “country.”\n\nYali Romagoza’s ongoing work The Mistress of Loneliness (2019-) is a sculptural, floor-based video installation which explores notions of migrant isolation, loneliness, longing, and strategies of survival, drawing on an autobiographical experience of migration from Cuba to the US.\n\nThrough the works on exhibit and public events, talks, and performances, The Immigrant Artist Biennial expresses ongoing efforts to counter the seemingly dominant paradigms of colonialism, xenophobia, and politically-motivated bigotry to create a common ground and a global community. By uplifting and spotlighting these artists from elsewhere who have chosen to make New York their home, the exhibition is a ray of hope for a future that we can yet create—“here, together!”\n\nExhibition Events:\n\nWednesday, September 9th, 6-9 pm: Virtual Opening Reception and Curatorial Walkthrough via Zoom (as a joint event with EFA Studio Program’s opening of Freedom is an Act: EFA New Member Exhibition, curated by Natalia Nakazawa)\n\nFriday, September 18th, 4 pm: Performance by Yali Romagoza via IG Live @efaprojectspace\n\nSunday, October 4th, 4 pm: Performance by Kalaktive collaborative duo (Bahareh Khoshooee & Sareh Imani) via Zoom\n\nSaturday, October 24th, 6 pm: Closing Reception, Catalog Launch & Performances by Levan Mindiashvili and Anna Parisi via Zoom. Presented in conjunction with EFA Open Studios 2020.\n\nFor full event details, visit https://www.projectspace-efanyc.org/events.\n\nAbout the Curator\n\nKatya Grokhovsky was born in Ukraine, raised in Australia and is based in NYC.

Shaun Leonardo, FF Alumn, at MASS MoCA, North Adams, MA, thru Dec. 22\n\nThe Breath of Empty Space\n\nAugust 26 – December 22, 2020 | MASS MoCA\n\n1040 MASS MoCA WAY | North Adams, MA\n\nJanuary 20 – May 2021 | The Bronx Museum of the Arts\n\n1040 Grand Concourse | Bronx, NY\n\nThrough a series of intimate drawings based on images widely disseminated in the press and popular media, and accessed from his own recollection of these tragedies, Leonardo applies the additive nature of drawing — a rigorous visual editing — to explore the reductive nature of memory, powerfully addressing how time and the endless cycling of images in the media affect what we remember, and what we forget. The artist employs material strategies of blurring, removing, die-cut, and mirrored tint to draw attention to information and to reframe content.\n\nLeonardo and MASS MoCA have a long-standing relationship. Leonardo is scheduled to be a featured artist in the Defining Moments exhibition in Kidspace in 2021, and at that time will also organize a social practice project titled You Walk… for a dedicated interactive community space within the museum. In 2018, a number of the works in The Breath of Empty Space were shown at the Massachusetts College of Liberal Arts (MCLA) Gallery 51, in the exhibition Witness, which Thompson — who is also a professor at MCLA in North Adams — involved her class in organizing. In 2016 at MASS MoCA, Leonardo conducted an artist residency with teens in conjunction with the exhibition Nick Cave: Until, which focused on race and policing.\n\nThe exhibition extends the exploration of race and masculinity — and the power structures that form and uphold them — that is at the core of Leonardo’s practice. Created between 2014 and 2019, this series asks viewers to confront uncomfortable images in order to bear witness to and recall the names, bodies, and lives of those depicted, from Rodney King and the “Central Park Five” to Trayvon Martin, Michael Brown, Stephon Clark, and beyond.\n\n“For these drawings, I take some of the most widely disseminated images of police violence, both recent and historical, and make choices that I think will slow down our looking,” Leonardo said. “I wish to literally create space in these images, so that we can sit with them differently, even in the hurt. I am intentionally removing or isolating details in order to point to the absence of lives lost and to critical information that would otherwise go overlooked. Ultimately, I want to turn people’s looking into bearing witness.”\n\nThe works in this exhibition offer but a few instances of violence. Just months since its debut at MICA in January 2020, the United States has witnessed the murders of Ahmaud Arbery, George Floyd, Elijah McClain, Tony McDade, Breonna Taylor, and many more. In this environment of systemic violence against Black and Brown bodies, Leonardo continues to encourage us to engage in complex dialogues around race, representation, and the power of art, with the belief that art, and thoughtful conversation about it, can inspire change.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n5. Nicolás Dumit Estévez Raful Espejo, FF Alumn, online Sept. 1\n\nEdge Zones\n\nEvents Residency Studio\n\nMiami Performance Festival International ’20 (M/P ’20)\n\nCurated by Charo Oquet\n\nThe 9th Edition of Miami Performance Festival International ‘20” (M/P ’20) will take place through virtual live streaming @MiamiPerformanceInternational.Festiva and virtual platform this year focusing of the critical state of the Earth now coincides with the coronavirus pandemic, proving core questions of the ecological crisis, inequality, income inequality and racist politic we are witnessing. This situation requires a new global earthly politics, which also implies new policies for performances and festival.\n\nHence, the live M/P’20 will take place on Miami Beach produced by Edge Zones and will be published in a digital performance platform and thus be connected to a non-local event field in real and virtual spaces. A three-day Streaming-Festival with a program consisting of live performances and the virtual space, as well as interviews and talks, will open the festival starting on September 1, 2020 culminating with a week of live streaming performances September 9-11, 2020 with a series of live and video curated performances with local Miami artists at Faena Forum, Miami Beach, FL locations each day from 9 P.M. to 10:00 PM . In this multidimensional, multichannel communication the aim is to turn receivers into active transmitters and inviting submissions of performance from all over to the @MiamiPerformanceInternational.Festiva. The exhibition will become an echo chamber, a resonating space of symbiotic forms of communication—a response to the symbiotic planet. The recognition that life on Earth arises and endures through the symbiosis of all life forms also demands new modes of communication.\n\nParticipating Artists:\n\nGreg Alvarez | Jenna Balfe | Cookie and daWine | Dreamon | Sonia Hernandez-Baez | Jose Garza | Jan & Dave | Kunstwaffen | Male Model | Charo Oquet | Rafael Vargas Bernard | Eliu Almonte (Spain/Dom.

Cyrilla Mozenter\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n8. Cindy Sherman, FF Member, at Metro Pictures, Manhattan, opening Sept. 26, and online\n\nFor her latest body of work, Cindy Sherman has transformed herself into an extraordinary cast of androgynous characters, expanding her career-long investigation into the construction of identity and the nature of representation. The enigmatic figures pictured in the ten new photographs on view are dressed primarily in men’s designer clothing and are posed gallantly in front of digitally manipulated backgrounds composed from photographs Sherman took while traveling through Bavaria, Shanghai, and Sissinghurst (England). Each character draws the viewer in with their unique style, immediate eye contact and steely gaze.\n\nRenowned for her depictions of female stereotypes, Sherman has played with masculinity and gender expression before. In a series referred to as “Doctor and Nurse,” Sherman became both a male and female character, embodying stereotypical mid-century professional archetypes. In the “History Portrait” series, Sherman became both male aristocrats and clergymen. In her more recent clown series, the artist donned layers of face paint and shapeless costumes, eliminating the question of gender for many of the characters.\n\nOne of the most influential artists of her generation, Cindy Sherman will be the subject of a one-person exhibition at the Fondation Louis Vuitton in Paris that runs from September 23 through January 3, 2021, following major retrospective exhibitions in 2019 at the National Portrait Gallery, London, and the Vancouver Art Gallery. Her 2012 retrospective at the Museum of Modern Art, New York, traveled to the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art; Walker Art Center, Minneapolis; and the Dallas Museum of Art. Additional recent exhibitions include Fosun Foundation, Shanghai; the inaugural exhibition at the Broad Museum, Los Angeles; Queensland Art Gallery | Gallery of Modern Art, Brisbane, Australia; and Astrup Fearnley Museum, Oslo. Sherman has participated in four Venice Biennales, co-curating a section at the 55th exhibition in 2013. Her work has been included in five iterations of the Whitney Biennial, two Biennales of Sydney, and the 1983 Documenta. She is the recipient of the 2020 Wolf Prize in Arts and has also been awarded the Praemium Imperiale, an American Academy of Arts and Letters Award, and a MacArthur Foundation Fellowship.\n\nAn online viewing room will accompany the gallery presentation. Appointments to see the exhibition in person will be available on our website shortly.

Just wanted to invite you to check out some of my current artwork, events, and projects:\n\nUSPS Art Project!\n\nAn innovative way to support the U.S. Postal Service (which needs all the help it can get) and collaborate with other creative people, started by artist Christina Massey. Three artist friends and I (Pamela Turczyn, Barbara Lubliner, and Eduardo Adam-Rabel) each sent a partial work for the other to complete. Four of these six collaborations are being shown at the USPS Art Project exhibition at Pelham Art Center ( https://e.givesmart.com/events/e5z/ for the online catalogue see #42, #101, #142, and #147) through Aug. 31. Two more will be included for the upcoming exhibition at Ely Center of Contemporary Art in Hamden, CT from September 13 To November 1, 2020. All the work is viewable online and available for sale.\n\nOne of the pieces artist Barbara Lubliner and I collaborated on for USPS Art Project was featured on artnet.com and Vasari 21!\n\nTrees!\n\nDuring the past months my fascination (obsession?) with the symbiotic relationship between fungi and trees has deepened. Trees and underground connective fungal networks are now a prominent theme in both my studio work (the Rooted drawings https://www.priscillastadler.com/rooted ), and in my participatory community engagement work (The PoeTREE/A Tree I Love https://www.priscillastadler.com/thepoetree ).\n\nBest wishes,\n\nPriscilla\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n11.

Carey Lovelace, FF Member, at CalArts, Santa Clarita, CA\n\nCalArts and the Exploding Counterculture\n\nHippies erected a Buckminster Fuller Geodesic Dome in the courtyard. Long-haired faculty from the fringes of the avant-garde signed memos, “I embrace you!” There were classes in “alternate states of consciousness” and, rather than grades, experience reports that could be a poem or even a pot. Alan Ginsberg floated through in white robes, playing his sruti box, wrapped in the scent of marijuana; Allan Kaprow organized Happenings where an ice cube was passed mouth to mouth; Ravi Shankar played sitar in the Burbank quad of the decommissioned Catholic girls’ school, the school’s first home.\n\nIt was 1970, and the counterculture was exploding. In that first year, California Institute of the Arts brought together an array of rebels and anarchists, with an inevitable tension between The Revolution and an accredited degree-granting, admission-charging institution.\n\nExperimentation runs deep in CalArts’ DNA. Animator, producer and theme-park inventor Walt Disney had the novel vision of bringing all arts under one roof. When the Imagineer Extraordinaire died in 1966, his heirs, trying to bring “Walt’s dream” into fruition, hired East Coast educators with rising reputations, Robert Corrigan and his provost, Herb Blau, to assemble a well-funded institute just northeast of Los Angeles. However, buoyed by late 1960s hubris, the two had their own dream: a community full of revolutionary synergy, like legendary art centers Bauhaus and Black Mountain College. At the same time, the counterculture had its own radical dreams: that free love and thought would blossom once the Establishment blew up.\n\nEducation would be reinvented! Meanwhile, art was dematerializing—in an anti-capitalist spirit, to pure concept, creating Polaroids and scraps of paper you couldn’t “sell.” Painting had been declared dead; conceptualist John Baldessari taught post-studio art, handing students a list of actions to execute. Everything had to be rethought. The harmonic system in Western music was corrupt: Nazis loved music, and it certainly hadn’t improved them. Electronic music embraced technology; world music from around the globe—Ghana, South and North India—would bring people together. And cinema was “expanding” into something called video art.\n\nBeneath it all was the belief and the hope that art, taking risks, can transform society. Students were invited to constantly break rules. Authenticity over authority. CalArts struggled mightily between institutional needs and radical innovation—it still does. But there remains an openness that provides entry to all sorts of possibilities. Today when artists are much more directly engaged with civic issues, CalArts is perfectly positioned to draw from this DNA to take on a marriage of art and future-looking innovations.\n\n-Carey Lovelace (BFA Music, 1975)\n\nEducational Centers as Incubators for World-Changing Movements\n\nCalArts was inspired by the visionary Bauhaus and Black Mountain College, charismatic locales legendary not just as sites for daring and experimental teaching, but where artist-faculty cross-pollinations advanced society forward.\n\nJust as European modernism coalesced around the Bauhaus, Black Mountain was a melting pot for John Cage-influenced life-as-art approaches, visionary trends that promoted, as Holland Cotter put it, “the dream of art as a lived condition rather than a hoarded possession.” A small, shifting faculty included Buckminster Fuller, Robert Motherwell, Jacob Lawrence, Charles Olson, and Merce Cunningham among many others, and students included Robert Rauschenberg, Cy Twombly, Sue Weil, Dorothea Rockburne, Ruth Asawa, to name a few.\n\nSimilarly, CalArts sought to create a vibrant, anarchic community, including the cream of Fluxus—Happenings inventor Kaprow, Nam June Paik, Dick Higgins, Emmet Williams, Allison Knowles, choreographer Simone Forti, composer James Tenney—as well as conceptual artists Baldessari, Doug Huebler, and Wolfgang Stoehle, and many others, fostering an anarchy-riven climate that produced another social turning point with its dizzyingly diverse list of celebrated students. Arguably ushering in Post-Modernism, Pictures Generation and Feminist artists were followed, in later years, by such photographers as Carrie Mae Weems, painters as Mark Bradford, installation artists as Mike Kelly, and film directors as Tim Burton.\n\nMore About CalArts and its Inspirations:\n\nA Community of Artists: Radical Pedagogy at CalArts, 1969-1972 by Janet Sarbanes\n\nWomanhouse.

The IMAF festival is a manifestation known for the works of artists whose works were created live, during the realization of multi-day programs. After twenty-one years, the IMAF festival is facing an insurmountable obstacle, an obstacle in the form of emergency measures throughout the country, adopted to prevent the spread of coronavirus. This year’s IMAF festival, the 22nd in a row, is embarking on a new adventure, going into the realm of virtual reality. The entire program of this year’s festival, on September 4th, 5th and 6th, will be presented online. We hope that this unwanted transformation will bring some new quality, by digitizing the body and spirit, in the unexplored spaces of the virtuality of social networks.”\n\nThank you!\n\nSarah H.
