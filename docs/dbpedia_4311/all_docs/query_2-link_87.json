Part of my argument was that the game back then was just as strong when Pete played as it is now. \r\n\r\nWell, after thinking a bit more on it, reading some comments, I've changed my stance. And I actually think history will ultimately look upon the current, 2002-2006 ATP years as one of the weaker periods, if not the weakest, in terms of overall competition and strength in the modern era.",
