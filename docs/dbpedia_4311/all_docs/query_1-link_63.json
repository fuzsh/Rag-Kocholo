        "text": "Translated from the Serbian by Persida Bošković\n\nYour Private Spot\n\nHow often do you think of\n\nthat most important spot\n\nin your head?\n\nAnd do you know,\n\nwhy it’s the most important?\n\nHow many are there, those most important,\n\ndo you ever count them?\n\nDo you ever compare them,\n\nwith each other,\n\nor with something else?\n\nWhat do you even compare\n\nyour life to,\n\nhow do you recognize\n\nthe spot that shouts out,\n\njoy that shines,\n\nand pain that is\n\nneither the spot nor the road?\n\nAnd do you know where you are\n\nwhen you sink into the sleep\n\nof daily life?\n\nIn which spot are you the shadow,\n\nand in which the sun?\n\nWhich day\n\nis important and yours,\n\nwhere you are always\n\nand where you are never?\n\n—\n\nThe Problem of Spreading\n\nIn All Directions\n\nEvery day\n\nI authenticate the transcript of the soul.\n\nNon-identical completely,\n\nit smiles at me shamelessly.\n\nAlone and nowhere, I recognize myself\n\nin the middle of a sentence wordless forever.\n\nSlow enough to dream about attainability,\n\nI worry about words which will pronounce me not.\n\n—\n\nMethodology of Illusion\n\nPieces of temptation\n\nform engravings of experience.\n\nI’m hiding in proportions of the impossible.\n\nWith a hundred wounds,\n\nI hide from myself.\n\nI’m building a house from implication,\n\nhammering inevitability into balance,\n\nthat I might put into use the irreconcilable.\n\nI’m working on perceiving\n\nthe methodology of illusion.\n\nIn the shelter of a shadow\n\nhidden is the law of self.\n\nBarely escaping time,\n\nforeign and its own,\n\nexistence flickers.\n\n—\n\nThere’s No Safe Place\n\nThe mirror is telling me there’s no me,\n\nit also shows me when there’s no me.\n\nAnd it’s up to me to determine,\n\nhow there’s no me.\n\nSubmerged in idleness,\n\nI determine how it could be that there’s no me,\n\nwhen I already am.\n\n—\n\nI’m Wrapping Myself In\n\nUnfounded Optimism\n\nNestled in the safety of these words,\n\nhopelessly secure and complete,\n\nlounging on both sides of nonexistence,\n\nI lent my own attention\n\nto the encounter that invariably lasts but a short time.\n\nHow many faces, how many moments\n\nare melting away within me?\n\nIt’s not just the question of grammar,\n\nbut also the difference between the silence of a being\n\nand the time of owning illusion.\n\n—\n\nI’m Verifying Presence:\n\nConfirming Reliability\n\nDo I have enough solitude\n\nto take a step outside myself?"
