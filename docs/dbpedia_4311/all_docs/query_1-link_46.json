        "text": "After two weeks of play the Fiba Basketball World Cup the final match is set. The USA will face Serbia in Sunday’s championship game, scheduled to tip off on 3pm EST. Think of this as a cheat sheet or Cliff’s Notes for the USA/Serbia finals for anyone who has understandably forgotten about the international basketball tournament in the deluge of so many, mostly incredibly disturbing, breaking sports news stories.\n\nWhat’s at stake in the championship game?\n\nThe prize for taking first place at the Fiba Basketball World Cup, the second most important international basketball competition, is an automatic bid to the most important. An automatic bid to the 2016 Summer Olympics may not seem like that big of a deal for the United States compared to other countries, which don’t have the luxury of sending off NBA All-Star teams whenever needed.\n\nIt does mean something, though, because it means that many of the world’s best players don’t have to bother with international play until the runup to the actual Olympics. Considering how many players dropped out of Team USA before the Fiba World Cup, this should be more than enough motivation.\n\nWho’s on the USA team?\n\nAs mentioned above, the US team is not operating on full strength.\n\nSome of these absences are health-related. The Indiana Pacers’ Paul George suffered a season-ending injury, which has sadly given him more time to make horrific comments about domestic violence on Twitter. A probably prudent Blake Griffin, of the Los Angeles Clippers, decided not to risk playing and making his back injury worse. Oklahoma City Thunder star Kevin Durant pulled out of World Cup practice immediately after the George injury. He claims the two events are unrelated, so perhaps he was still in the process of finishing his interminable MVP acceptance speech.\n\nThere were other reasons. Kevin Love dropped out while waiting for the Minnesota Timberwolves to finally trade him to the Cleveland Cavaliers. His new team-mate LeBron James has essentially retired from international play after leading the USA to a gold medal in 2012. The ravages of time suggest that Kobe Bryant will be essentially retired period come 2016, although the Los Angeles Lakers still could be paying him to not play games.\n\nSo instead the USA team features the following players. While they may not all be future Hall of Famers, they each bring certain qualities to the team, indicated in parenthesis:\n\nGuards: Houston Rockets’ James Harden (beard, defensive indifference); Golden State Warriors’ Steph Curry (three-point shooting) and Klay Thompson (package deal with Steph Curry); Chicago Bulls’ Derrick Rose (sadness); Cleveland Cavaliers’ Kyrie Irving (downplaying injuries).\n\nForwards: Denver Nuggets’ Kenneth Faried (global destruction), Sacramento Kings’ Rudy Gay (heated internet debate); Toronto Raptors’ DeMar DeRozen (DeMar DeRozen).\n\nCenters: New Orleans Pelicans’ Anthony Davis (Plastic Man arms), Sacramento Kings’ DeMarcus Cousins (undiluted Boogieness), Detroit Pistons’ Andre Drummond (redundancy), Brooklyn Nets’ Mason Plumlee (purposely selected wrong as a joke).\n\nHow did they get to the championship game?\n\nBy beating up everybody. Despite not arriving in Spain with their preferred roster, Team USA went 5-0 through pool play, crushing a relatively weak Group C by the highest points differential in the tournament before knocking out Mexico, Slovenia and Lithuania on their way to the gold medal game.\n\nIf there’s one flaw in this team it’s that they clearly lack focus in the first half of their games. They’ve fallen into a pattern of late, beginning with their comeback win against Turkey during group play and continuing in their victories over Slovenia in the quarter-finals and Lithuania in the semi-finals. The USA national team have been letting their opponents play them close in the first half of games, often carrying uncomfortably slim leads into the third quarter before flipping the switch and blowing them out by large margins. As a result, 20-30 points final score differentials have masked stretches of downright ugly ball from the Americans.\n\nStill, while it’s not exactly easy to watch – at their worst it’s as if the entire team takes on James Harden’s game – it’s also been highly effective.\n\nAlso much like James Harden’s game.\n\nHow did Spain miss the championship game?\n\nThat’s, by far, the biggest surprise of the Fiba World Cup: Spain, the home team, stacked with NBA talent, failing to make it out of the quarter-finals, getting knocked out by a Tony Parker-less French team. It was a surprising end for a team stacked with NBA talent like Marc and Pau Gasol, Serge Ibaka, José Calderón and Ricky Rubio. A premature end for a country expecting, at worst, a rematch of the 2012 Olympic gold medal game.\n\nThis tournament might mark the end of two eras, as both Spain and Argentina were bounced far earlier than anybody had expected. While Argentina had the excuse of missing out on longtime emotional and physical leader, Manu Ginobili, it was beyond shocking to see them lose to Brazil 85-65 in the very first elimination game.\n\nSo how did Serbia make it instead?\n\nThat giantkilling French team didn’t have much time for celebration, as Serbia eliminated them during Friday’s semi-final match-up, by far the best game of the entire tournament. Despite Serbia building a sizable lead, the Portland Trail Blazers’ Nic Batum, who eventually scored 35 points in the game, led France to a ferocious comeback. With three seconds left in the game, Batum made it a one-possession game in a numerology-friendly play where he hit a three-pointer with three seconds left on the clock to cut Serbia’s lead down to three.\n\nUnfortunately for France, their efforts fell just short as the game ended with Marko Simonović making two free throws to ice the game for Serbia, who won 90-85. France will have to settle for an appearance in the consolation game against Lithuania, who have something of a solid track record in third-place games, on Saturday.\n\nIt was a game that capped off a rather surprising run. Serbia just barely survived group play, going 2-3 in Group A. In their first elimination game, they knocked off an undefeated Greece team 90-72. In the quarter-finals they vaporised Brazil 84-56.\n\nNow Serbia having trouble in their semi-final game might not bode well, but it was an understandable outcome considering their opponent just knocked off Spain, whom some actually thought should have been favoured in a gold medal match. Plus, being in an actual competitive game might actually be the exact preparation Serbia needed for the near-impossible task ahead.\n\nWho would I know on the Serbian team?\n\nNot as many players as you would had France or Spain advanced. One of the more intriguing players in the tournament has been shooting guard Bogdan Bogdanović, a first round draft pick for the Phoenix Suns earlier this year. So far, Suns fans who are getting their first real look at the guard, who won’t be able to join Phoenix for two more years, should be impressed at what they’re seeing.\n\nNemanja Bjelica was drafted by the Washington Wizards in 2010, although his rights were then traded to the Minnesota Timberwolves. He has yet to appear in an NBA game.\n\nSomeone who has appeared in many NBA games? That would be Nenad Krstić who spent playing time with the then-New Jersey Nets, Oklahoma City Thunder and the Boston Celtics before continuing his career overseas. While maybe the most recognisable name on the Serbian roster for many NBA fans, he was part of the deal that sent Kendrick Perkins to Oklahoma City, he’s been more of a role player throughout the tournament. Also, Miroslav Raduljica should get partial credit for spending a year with the Milwaukee Bucks, who in theory are a NBA team.\n\nWill the USA lose their first major tournament game since 2006?\n\nWell, those above names don’t strike much fear in USA head coach Mike Krzyzewski that’s for sure. As good as Bogdanović has been, they would be far more worried about a Batum or a Gasol. Spain and France both might have proven be to be tougher opponents for the USA, if only because those teams each had at least one proven NBA player to throw at them. Lithuania probably had a better shot than Serbia, and they ended up having no shot.\n\nPerhaps this is undervaluing a Serbia team whose presence in the championship game is no fluke, but it’s still hard to argue with the belief held by most at the beginning of the tournament: the only team with a real shot at beating the US would have been Spain. That competitive match-up was what most basketball fans were eager to see. If you believe Kenneth Faried, even Team USA itself wanted to test their mettle against the home team.\n\nYou ruined it for all of us, France.\n\nFinal prediction\n\nGiven the last few games, it seems like the USA has been following the same script, it’s hard to expect that to change. Expect Serbia to keep it relatively close in the first half, trailing by 10 points or less by half-time before the USA goes completely crazy scoring-wise in the second."
