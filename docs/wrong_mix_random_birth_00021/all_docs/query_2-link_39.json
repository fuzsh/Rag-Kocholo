Tonight, patrons can pay $200 for tickets to get in early from 4 p.m. to 7 p.m., scoping out the selection and getting the first pick of the treasures inside.\n\nThat said, entry to the rest of the show is free and open to the public; The hours are 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. on Wednesday through Friday and 10:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. on Saturday, and you can click here to reserve complementary tickets. Southern Exchange is located at 155 Carnegie Way Northwest in Downtown Atlanta, and shoppers are asked to use the entrance on Carnegie Way at Ellis Street.\n\nAs soon as we heard about the Atlanta show, we knew we needed to be the first inside to check out the antiques inside — click the video player in this article to check out our exclusive morning getting a first look!"
