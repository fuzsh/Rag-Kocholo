        "text": "Former President Jimmy Carter's 99th birthday is Sunday, Oct. 1.\n\nA celebration for Carter, the longest-lived U.S. president, is planned for Saturday on the Atlanta campus of the Jimmy Carter Library & Museum and the adjacent Carter Center. Carter entered hospice care in February, however, he made a brief appearance at the Plains Peanut Festival, a week ahead of his birthday.\n\nLike many Georgia politicians, throughout his career — and even after his presidency ended — Carter made front-page news at the Augusta Chronicle.\n\nFor history buffs or those wishing to revisit the milestones of Carter's career, we have pulled together a gallery of some of the most notable times Carter was on the front page.\n\nBelow are a few highlights.\n\nThe happy couple: Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter mark 77th wedding anniversary at home in Plains, Georgia\n\nWhat did Jimmy Carter do before he was president?\n\nCarter, who served as a state senator from 1963-1967, was elected governor of Georgia in 1970, defeating Republican nominee Hal Suit. He had previously run for governor in 1966, when he lost in the primary.\n\nBefore his political career kicked off, he was in the Navy, serving on active duty from 1946-1953. After that time, he was a peanut farmer.\n\nWhen was Jimmy Carter president?\n\nCarter announced his presidential campaign in December 1974, just shy of two years before the 1976 presidential election. At the time, he was largely considered a longshot with regional support.\n\nCarter, and his running mate Sen. Walter Mondale, would go on to defeat incumbent Republican president Gerald Ford, winning the popular vote with 50.1 percent and receiving 297 electoral votes to Ford's 240.\n\nCarter was sworn in as the 39th president in January 1977.\n\nHowever, Carter lost re-election to Ronald Reagan, who won the 1980 president election in a landslide.\n\nBut wait, where even is Plains, Ga.?\n\nCarter put the small town of Plains, Georgia on the national map.\n\nLocated in Sumter County in southwest Georgia, Plains is one hour southeast of Columbus and 45 minutes northwest of Americus.\n\nPlains has a population of 553, as of the 2021 census. Carter and his wife Rosalynn currently live in Plains, which now hosts the Jimmy Carter National Historic Park."
