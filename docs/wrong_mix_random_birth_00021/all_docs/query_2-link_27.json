        "text": "Jimmy Carter Before the Presidency\n\nJames Earl Carter, Jr. was born in Plains, Georgia, on October 1, 1924. His parents, Lillian and James Earl Carter owned a peanut farm, warehouse, and small shop just outside their small town. James Earl Carter, Jr preferred to go by Jimmy Carter and was rarely called James. His parents taught him that racism was wrong, which was something he would believe in for the rest of his life.\n\nCarter's uncle was in the Navy and sent them postcards from around the world. His uncle's service inspired him early on to join the Navy and travel. Carter knew that to be successful in the Navy, he had to work hard, be studious, and become a scholar.\n\nJimmy Carter Education\n\nCarter was the valedictorian of his high school class. He went to Georgia South West College, then to Georgia Institute of Technology. He transferred to the US Navy Academy in 1946 and graduated with a Bachelor of Science. That same year, Carter married Rosalyn Smith. Carter went on to join the Navy; he volunteered to work on submarines.\n\nWorking on a submarine was considered one of the Navy's most dangerous jobs at the time!\n\nAdmiral Hyman Rickover oversaw the nuclear submarine program for the Navy. He hand-picked the crew for the nuclear submarines. Rickover chose Carter to work on the second-ever American nuclear submarine, the Sea Wolf. Carter was sent to New York to take courses at Union College in nuclear technology.\n\nWhen the crew of the Sea Wolf was invited to a military party, Carter refused the invitation when he was informed it was for white people only. Carter served in the Navy for a total of seven years. After James Carter Sr died, Jimmy Carter left the Navy and moved back to Georgia with his wife and children to take over the family business.\n\nJimmy Carter Early Political Career\n\nRacial tensions were high in the 1950s. Carter lived in a predominately white community that didn't want things to change in the South. Once desegregation began in the South, the white citizens of Plains, Georgia, formed a group to preserve segregation. Carter refused to join the group, so they started a boycott against his shop. The boycott eventually disbanded, and the store continued to thrive.\n\nSegregation:\n\nThe separation of white people from people of color\n\nCarter held seats on community boards like the hospital and library. Plus, he was involved in the community. Carter was a deacon at his church, taught Sunday School, and was the Chairman of the Board of Education. In 1962, Carter ran for a seat in the Senate but lost. He challenged the loss because his opponent committed voter fraud, and Carter won the election.\n\nCarter was against wasteful government spending and advocated protecting African Americans' right to vote. He gave up his seat in the Senate to run for Governor of Georgia. Carter lost to a segregationist known for prohibiting African Americans from entering his business.\n\nThe next election year, Carter catered more toward segregationists and won the endorsement of the former governor. In 1970, when Carter became governor, he continued to advocate for African Americans and even increased the amount of African Americans in government positions by 25%.\n\nPresident Jimmy Carter\n\nA Leader, For A Change.\"\n\n-Jimmy Carter, Campaign Slogan1\n\nAmerica had grown tired of Washington politicians. Richard Nixon was involved in an enormous scandal called Watergate. His Vice President had to resign, so Nixon appointed Gerald Ford. Nixon was impeached and then resigned from office. Ford became President. Ford was the only President not voted for by the American people.\n\nCarter's campaign pitched him as a Washington outsider. Ford was unpopular because he pardoned Nixon for his crimes involving Watergate. Carter was going to clean up Washington, and the American people approved of this. Carter won the election and was inaugurated in 1977.\n\nJimmy Carter, Vice President\n\nBefore Carter had even become President, he planned to change the role of Vice President. Carter chose Walter Mondale, a Northern Democrat, as his running mate. Carter hoped that Mondale would earn him the support of Northern Democrats. Mondale was to expand the role of Vice President. Before the Carter-Mondale model, Vice Presidents didn't do much.\n\nThe Vice President was supposed to be a general advisor and assist the President with different tasks. Mondale was the first Vice President to have an office in the West Wing of the White House. Every Vice President since Mondale has used the Carter-Mondale model.\n\nJimmy Carter Accomplishments\n\nOne of the most significant accomplishments of Jimmy Carter's presidency was the negotiation between Israel and Egypt at Camp David in Washington. This kind of negotiation between Egypt and Israel was unprecedented. The Prime Minister of Israel, Menachem Begin, and President Anwar Sadat were to come to a peace agreement with Carter's assistance.\n\nAfter negotiations, they concluded. Each nation would recognize the sovereignty of the other. Israel would leave the Sinai Peninsula and acknowledge that it belonged to Egypt. In exchange, America would fund Israel's rebuilding of its military in the Negev Dessert. Both Sadat and Begin would receive the Nobel Peace Prize for this accomplishment.\n\nThe Unpopular President\n\nJimmy Carter had many achievements during his presidency, but the American people didn't see it that way. Carter and his team weren't able to control his public image. The matter was made worse by the fact that many of his plans weren't properly explained to the American people. Let's take a closer look at three events that made the Americans lose faith in Carter.\n\nThe Energy Crisis\n\nAmerica was reliant on different countries for natural gases. America produced 2.3 times the average amount of energy use as most European Countries and 2.6 times that of Japan! Carter passed the Energy Security Act in 1979 and 1980. It created the Synthetic Fuels Corporation.\n\nCarter planned for the cost of gas to lower over time. He initiated several processes to put this plan into motion. The issue was that the gas price would increase before his plan reduced it. 1979 saw a significant increase in gas prices, but gas production in America rose. The American people didn't understand Carter's plan, and his popularity began to fall.\n\nRemember that Carter's popularity was falling because of misunderstandings!\n\nThe 1980 Olympic Boycott\n\nIn 1979, the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan to assist the communist government against Islamic rebels. Carter argued that the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan to gain control over its oil. He gave the Soviets until February 20, 1980, to remove their soldiers. The date passed, and the Soviets remained in Afghanistan. In protest, Carter placed two embargos on grain and specific technologies.\n\nCarter initiated a boycott of the 1980 Olympics held in Moscow, Russia. Japan, Canada, and West Germany joined America in this boycott, but most other countries didn't. He also threatened to revoke the passport of any American athlete who attempted to compete in the Olympics.\n\nSome Americans felt that this showed America's commitment to fighting communism, but the majority were angered. Large companies lost investments. Athletes who trained their entire lives lost what might have been their only opportunity to compete.\n\nIranian Hostage Situation\n\nMuch more significant issues created the Iranian Hostage Situation. In summary, the United States and Great Britain helped install Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi, the Shah, as the leader of Iran. In exchange, Iran granted most of its oil rights to America and Great Britain. The Iranians would eventually exile the Shah for his tyrannical behavior.\n\nThe Shah moved to Mexico, but Carter allowed him to seek refuge and cancer treatment in America. Iranians were furious at Carter for this decision. Islamic student militants overran the American embassy and took the inhabitants hostage.\n\nCarter tried to negotiate with them and retrieve the hostages but to no avail. The militants would agree with Carter, then change their minds the following day. Carter initiated a secret rescue mission to save the hostages. The mission was a spectacular failure. The hostages were all moved to isolated locations.\n\nCarter eventually negotiated the release of the hostages. The crisis lasted 444 days, and news reporters kept track of it for the American people. The hostages were released on the day that Carter left office. Carter's perceived failure to negotiate for the hostages made Americans believe that Carter was weak and incompetent.\n\nJimmy Carter Versus Ronald Reagan\n\nJimmy Carter lost the presidential election of 1980 to Ronald Reagan. Carter had lost popularity, but more importantly, Reagan was an actor and had a much better stage presence than Carter. According to the historian Julian E. Zelizer, Carter was successful early on and was popular with the American people. The problem arose when Carter didn't correct the misconceptions about him.1 Regan was able to take advantage of this during the election.\n\nJimmy Carter: Habitat for Humanity\n\nCarter went on to become an ambassador for the American government. He also partnered with Habitat for Humanity. Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter assisted with building affordable homes for low-income families, raising funds for the company, and more. The two believed in the cause of Habitat for Humanity.\n\nIn 2002, Carter won the Nobel Peace Prize for his advocacy for human rights and political accomplishments throughout his life. Americans liked the former president because of his involvement with Habitat for Humanity.\n\nThe Presidency of Jimmy Carter\n\nJimmy Carter began as a popular President. Americans were impressed when he negotiated peace between Israel and Egypt. Once Carter's popularity began to fail, he did nothing to change this image. This would cost Carter the presidency. Carter didn't slow down when he left office; he volunteered at Habitat for Humanity and was an ambassador. Carter might have been unpopular, but he was very accomplished.\n\nJimmy Carter - Key takeaways\n\nJimmy Carter and his Vice President changed the role of the Vice President\n\nCarter assisted with the Camp David Accords, which was a peace negotiation between Israel and Egypt\n\nCarter's energy policy allowed America to start harvesting its oil resources\n\nThe Iranian Hostage situation made Carter look weak and contributed to him losing the next election\n\nReferences\n\nJulian E. Zelizer, The Miller Center, October 29, 2010."
