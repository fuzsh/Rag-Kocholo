        "text": "PLAINS, Ga. (WALB) - While WALB has been Your Hometown News Source when it comes to President Jimmy Carter’s life and legacy, WALB Anchor Jim Wallace developed a personal relationship with the former First Couple.\n\nIf you ask anyone in Jimmy Carter’s hometown of Plains who Jim Wallace is, they’ll tell you this.\n\nPhilip Kurland, owner of Plains Trading Post, said he’s been watching Wallace since the beginning.\n\n“He’s given us a ton of pleasure through the years watching him,” he said.\n\nOver the years, Wallace’s coverage of the Carter’s hasn’t just been about following the former first lady and president. He’s hit the streets of Plains to talk to residents about home repairs, caught up with the new owners of Jimmy Carter’s old peanut business, and even emceed the Rosalynn Carter Awards Gala.\n\nBut Jim says his fondest memory of his time with the Carters was playing softball with Jimmy Carter.\n\n“When I went up there to cover the softball games that they had in Plains with the president, a lot of the Secret Service agents knew me from playing softball out there, so they told me to get out there to play with the national Press Team,” Wallace said. “The press would play against the Secret Service and the president. The president would pitch all the time. President Carter was very competitive. He was a very competitive person but of course, you don’t become the president of the United States if you’re not competitive.”\n\nEven in the saddest times, Wallace was in Americus helping Rosalynn Carter admirers everywhere say goodbye.\n\n“It’s sad that they are leaving this world, but the legacy that they leave behind is so great. And the memories, the example that they set for everyone else, it’s something they should be very proud of,” Wallace said.\n\nNow, as Wallace ends a nearly 50-year career in the news, people in Plains are also reflecting on his time covering the Carters.\n\n“So, I’ve been around 26 years or so now and Jim’s always been there. He cares about Plains, he cares about President Carter,” said Superintendent of Jimmy Carter National Historic Park Jill Stuckey.\n\nKim Fuller, Jimmy Carter’s niece, said Wallace has become a friend of Plains.\n\n“Every time he spoke about Plains, you could tell that he loved the area and that he loved the people, and we just appreciate everything he’s always done,” she said.\n\nHave a news tip or see an error that needs correction?
