        "text": "Jimmy Carter has spent over\n\na year in hospice care.\n\nHow has he defied the odds?\n\nEnd-of-life advocates and experts cite Carter’s stay in hospice as having a positive impact on the discourse of end-of-life care. Northeastern University experts say many people put off hospice care until it’s too late.\n\nLast month, former President Jimmy Carter marked one year in hospice. After entering end-of-life care in February 2023, he celebrated his 99th birthday and grieved the death of his wife of 77 years and former first lady, Rosalynn Carter.\n\nEven then, Carter was able — with help — to attend her funeral.\n\nEven at the end of life, the nation’s longest-living president — someone who “practically no one ever thought” would be elected president, writes the New York Times’ Peter Baker — is defying the odds.\n\nAccording to the National Institutes of Health, more than 90% of patients who enter hospice care die within the first six months. Roughly 36% of patients die within a week of entering hospice.\n\nEnd-of-life advocates and experts cite Carter’s stay in hospice as having a positive impact on the discourse surrounding end-of-life care. Northeastern University experts say many people put off hospice care until it’s too late.\n\n“The thing about hospice care is that it’s generally underutilized,” says Carla Bouwmeester, clinical professor of pharmacy and health systems science. “When you think about the services that are offered, if you’re waiting until the very last few weeks of life to focus on quality of life, symptom control, pain relief — sometimes I see cases and think, ‘There are real missed opportunities here.’”\n\nIt’s unclear just how well Carter is faring after more than a year in hospice; he survived metastatic brain cancer and liver cancer, and recovered from brain surgery in 2019.\n\nA statement released by the family last month didn’t provide too much detail on the former president’s condition.\n\n“President Carter continues to be at home with his family,” the statement said. “The family is pleased that his decision last year to enter hospice care has sparked so many family discussions across the country on an important subject.”\n\nBouwmeester says there are many factors that can impact how long a patient can survive while in hospice. Sometimes a patient’s health can stabilize due to changes in care, such as changes in medication or fewer invasive procedures.\n\n“Depending on the condition, some are much more difficult to offer prognoses,” she says. “With any type of prognostication, you always have outliers. We have some better data for oncology versus some other conditions. With dementia, for example, it may be more difficult to gauge.”"
