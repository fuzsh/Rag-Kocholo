His experience in global health law led Adam to think about the increasing use of biometric technologies, the storage and transfer of health data and about the forays of tech companies into digital health.\n\nAt NYU, Adam will conduct a research project seeking to offer an infrastructural account of ‘smart walls’ programs in the US and in the EU. In the course of his project, Adam will study the contracting between public and private entities for the purpose of border surveillance.

He will be finalizing his book manuscript that aims to offer a new theory of constitutional review, both for the U.S. and comparatively. He will also be completing a project that attempts to re-imagine the field of administrative law and to suggest how we should build administrative states around the world in a way that would put them on a stronger, much more attractive, footing (among other things as a response to various attempts around the world to bring forth their “deconstruction” and to attack knowledge and expertise). Finally, Oren will work on a project that criticizes the literature on “abusive constitutionalism” or “democratic decline”—suggesting that it has complicated “dark sides” that are counterproductive to this literature’s aim of better safeguarding democracies.\n\nCenter Affiliation: Center for Human Rights and Global Justice\n\nResearch Project: Abusive \"Abusive Constitutionalism\"\n\nMaximilien Zahnd (Fall)\n\nPost-Doctoral Global Fellow\n\nFrance\n\nMaximilien (Max) Zahnd is a Post-Doctoral Global Fellow affiliated with the Center on Race, Inequality, and the Law.

She graduated in the history of philosophy (University of Macerata, 2014) and has an LLM in Comparative, European and International Laws (European University Institute, 2015). For her PhD thesis, she worked on a history of the concept of customary international law in the natural law and ius gentium tradition from Francisco de Vitoria to Emer de Vattel. She is now turning her dissertation into a book for publication, titled “The Invention of Custom. Natural Law and the Law of Nations, 1550-1750”. Its seeks to provide an asnwer to the question of when and how the concept of customary international law originated in European debates on natural law and law of nations, by arguing that this tradition provides us with a solid conceptual framework to contextualize and understand the “problematic” of custom”, i.e. the question concerning the normative content of CIL. Natural law, in fact, provides jurists with an imaginary reserve of argumentations and narratives, through which jurists “invent” customary rules applicable to their present situation. Over time, these arguments progressively and cumulatively crystallize into a notion of CIL as coincident with European cultural history. They become the fabric itself of CIL, the normative validity of which lies in the fact that it enshrines cultural values recognized by the community of European states.\n\nHer research interests include international legal thought, history of political thought, history and reception of natural law theories, law and literature, food ethics, and animal rights. In 2012 she was awarded the Alberico Gentili Prize for her Italian translation of and introduction to Alberico Gentili’s Lectionis Virgilianae Variae Liber ad Robertum filium, a less-known commentary of Vergil’s Eclogues published by the famous jurist in 1603.\n\nAt NYU, she will work on a project titled “Conscience or Interest of States?

Her research interests lie in the extraterritorial application of human rights, human rights litigation in global governance, critical constitutionalism, and human rights protection in the context of devolution in the UK. She has published in these areas in leading academic publications including the Modern Law Review, Public Law, Max Planck Encyclopaedia of Comparative Constitutional Law, and Northern Ireland Legal Quarterly. She is book review editor of European Human Rights Law Review.\n\nDr Rooney facilitates student projects with human rights organisations in the Human Rights Implementation Centre at Bristol Law School and has actively engaged with UK parliamentary committees on issues relating to UK military operations abroad and abortion reform in Northern Ireland.\n\nHer research at NYU develops a new normative frame for the extraterritorial application of human rights. Legitimacy concerns regarding the expansion of extraterritoriality are challenged by acknowledging the significant democratic function of human rights adjudication for extraterritorial applicants. Human rights adjudication enables extraterritorial victims to participate in the law-making process, facilitates potential disempowerment and helps identify political and legal relationships that necessitate processes of good governance. Challenges and limitations arising from the extraterritorial application of human rights are investigated through applying the unique normative frame to three case studies: corporate environmental harm, the Mexico City Policy (the Global Gag Rule) and targeted killing.\n\nCenter Affiliation: Center for Human Rights and Global Justice\n\nResearch Project: Human Rights and Extraterritorial Corporate Liability\n\nEytan Tepper (Spring)\n\nPost-Doctoral Global Fellow\n\nIsrael\n\nEytan Tepper is a post-doctoral Global Fellow affiliated with the Institute for International Law and Justice. His research project at NYU is part of his research agenda on space governance and it builds on his previous research conducted at McGill University’s Institute of Air and Space Law.\n\nThe institutions and treaties at the core of space governance are Cold War remnants in dire need of reconceptualization and modern theoretical underpinnings. Dr. Tepper’s research at McGill analyzed the architecture of space governance using international relations and political economy theories. It demonstrated that space governance is on track to become polycentric, as multiple, issue-specific, governance centers led by stakeholders and experts emerge to fill the gap left by the gridlock at the main multilateral institutions. His research at NYU will take the next step and focus on one such emerging governance center.\n\nThe research at NYU will study a case of an issue-areas in global affairs in which there is scarce multilateral regulation and instead effective rules are made by the combination of States’ unilateral actions and private ordering, almost skipping multilateralism. The result, what Dr. Tepper calls ‘global governance without multilateralism’, raises questions on the place of such a governance system within international law and the availability of standards for such a system. The case study for this research is the governance of space resources and the mining thereof. The regulation and governance of this issue-area is emerging as a combination of national laws that recognize the right to mine and private ordering of the operation of mining and further utilization of the resources. The research will explore whether global administrative law (GAL) and the ‘law of global governance’ set standards for such governance systems and by that both constrain and legitimize them.\n\nDr. Tepper’s academic education is multidisciplinary. Prior to his doctoral studies at McGill University’s Faculty of Law he earned a policy-oriented doctorate from China University of Political Science and Law focused on Chinese space policy, a master’s degree in law from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and a double bachelor’s degree in law and economics from Tel Aviv University.\n\nPrior to his return to academe, Dr. Tepper’s career spanned the private and public sectors, notably working for the Bank of Israel and the Israeli Foreign Trade Administration resolving issues related to international trade and cooperation. He reported directly to the highest ranks of public administration, including the Minister of the Economy and Industry and the Parliament’s Finance Committee. He led a formal inquiry delegation to China under the WTO rules and co-authored the feasibility study on a China–Israel Free Trade Area Agreement. Dr. Tepper also worked in the private sector, notably consulting international corporations on their legal affairs in Israel, including Fortune 500 companies (e.g. Johnson & Johnson, Pfizer, Merck, Eli Lilly). He is former Vice-Chairman of the Israeli Bar Association's Economic Forum. He brings his experience in senior level administration to his academic work seeking to identify and expand cutting-edge theory that withstands real-world constraints.\n\nCenter Affiliation: Institute for International Law and Justice\n\nResearch Project: Between Markets and States: The Role of University-Led Forums in Global Governance and the Application of Global Administrative Law\n\nTleuzhan Zhunussova\n\nPost-Doctoral Global Fellow\n\nKazakhstan\n\nTleuzhan is a Post-Doctoral Fellow, affiliated with the NYU Institute for International Law and Justice.
