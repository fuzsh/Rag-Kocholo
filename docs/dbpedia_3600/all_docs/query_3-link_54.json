        "text": "BACK TO ARTIST\n\nBIOGRAPHY\n\nSammy Baloji was born in 1978 in Lubumbashi, in the mineral-rich Katanga province of Democratic Republic of Congo. He studied Computer and Information Sciences and Communication at the University of Lubumbashi. With a borrowed camera, he began photographing scenes as sources for his cartoons. He soon enrolled in photography courses in DRC, and continued with photography and video at Haute École des Arts du Rhin, in Strasbourg, France. Since September 2019, he has been conducting his PhD research in art at St. Lucas Antwerpen entitled “Contemporary Kasala and Lukasa: towards a Reconfiguration of Identity and Geopolitics”.\n\nRaised in Lubumbashi, Sammy Baloji was sensitized to the colonial history and the postcolonial decline of the once-prosperous mining region of DRC, which Chinese and western companies exploit today. Baloji juxtaposes photographic realities, combining past and present, the real and the ideal, to illicit glaring cultural and historical tensions. He explores architecture and the human body as traces of social history, sites of memory, and witnesses to operations of power.\n\nBaloji has had solo exhibitions at: Lund Konsthall and Aarhus Kunsthal (2020), Le Point du Jour, Cherbourg (2019), Framer Framed, Amsterdam (2018), Museumcultuur Strombeek (2018), The Power Plant, Toronto, Open Society Foundation, New York, and WIELS, Brussels (2016-2017). Musée du quai Branly, Paris; MuZee, Oostende, Belgium; Royal Museum for Central Africa, Tervuren; and Museum for African Art, NY. He has participated in several major international biennales including; Sydney Biennial (2020), Documenta 14 (Kassel/Athens, 2017), Lyon Biennial (2015), Venice Biennial (2015).\n\nA Chevalier des Arts et des Lettres, Baloji was an artist in residence at Académie de France in Rome, Villa Medici, 2019-20, the Gerbrands Laureate (with collaborator Filip de Boeck) 2019, a Robert Gardner Fellow in Photography (Peabody Museum/Harvard University) 2017, and the recipient of numerous awards, including the Smithsonian Artist Research Fellowship, 2015, the visual artist selected for the Rolex Mentor & Protégé Arts Initiative (2014), the Prince Claus Award in 2008, and two awards at the 2007 African Photography Biennial in Bamako, Mali.\n\nCV\n\nEDUCATION\n\n2019-present Ph.D research in art at St. Lucas Antwerpen, Belgium\n\n2005 Ecole Supérieure des Arts Décoratifs, Strasbourg, France\n\n2003-2005 Université de Lubumbashi, Lubumbashi, DRC.
