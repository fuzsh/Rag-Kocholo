        "text": "Luis Devin (1975) is an Italian author and music anthropologist. He has carried out anthropological field research in central Africa, where he lived with the Baka pygmies and other Congo Basin hunter-gatherers. In 2000, while he was still an undergraduate student of Anthropology he took part in the secret rite of male initiation of the Baka, in the Cameroon rainforest, and thus became accepted as a member of one of their clans. In the years that followed he continued his fieldwork while also completing a PhD in Ethnomusicology at the University of Turin and two diplomas at the Conservatory of Music of Turin. His literary work has been published in reviews such as \"Nuovi Argomenti\" and \"Granta Italia (online)\". \"La foresta ti ha\" (The Forest Has You), his first book, is an account of his experience of initiation rites with the Baka pygmies. www.luisdevin.com www.facebook.com/LuisDevin\n\nRead full bio"
