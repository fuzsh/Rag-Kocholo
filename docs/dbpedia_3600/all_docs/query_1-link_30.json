        "text": "Felix Kawele Lumbala is the Refugee Congress Delegate for Nevada. He was born in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and arrived in the United States in 2013.\n\nFelix was a refugee for 18 years in Johannesburg, South Africa. He was separated from his siblings at a young age, but he never gave up on his education because he knew that knowledge is power.\n\nFelix suffered discrimination in South Africa, where the local population was wary and resentful of refugees. Yet, this discrimination and abuse only further motivated Felix's academic pursuit. He believed that education could set him apart from his peers and provide him new opportunities. Motivated by this belief, he proceeded to earn a bachelor's degree and built a comfortable life for himself which later allowed him to sponsor his family to immigrate to the United States.\n\nUnfortunately, not every refugee family lives this reality. That’s why today Felix works to assist those in similar predicaments. He takes pride in delivering each task to a high standard, and he achieves this by working closely with other people on his team. He believes he has qualities and years of experience as one of the leads helping people in the Congolese Community of Nevada.\n\nIn addition to his experience working with people and management skills. It is his promise that he will continue to serve each resettled family with dignity, compassion, and respect, his involvement in serving and advocating for the community, he will continue to enhance the effectiveness and level of service to represent the diverse populations of refugees and asylees resettled in Nevada and the rest of the U.S.\n\nIn the News:"
