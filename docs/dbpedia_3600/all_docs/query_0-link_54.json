        "text": "10 Atmospheric GHG Monitoring Network of the metropolitan area of Barcelona\n\nPoster\n\nGara Villalba1, Roger Curcoll2*\n\n1Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain. 2UPC, Barcelona, Spain\n\nSession 11. Quantification of urban greenhouse gas emissions - from novel monitoring to source identification\n\nThe ICOS Cities Horizon 2020 project makes observations on Greenhouse Gases (GHG) emissions in densely populated urban areas, with the objective of developing useful tools and services to support the local climate action plans of cities. This project has expanded to 12 European cities, including Barcelona. The Barcelona conurbation area extents up to 4200 km2 and has a total population over 5 million habitants. It includes green areas, industrial zones and agricultural soils but also some areas with the highest density population in Europe. Four continuous atmospheric measurement stations of GHG have been implemented with Picarro gas analyzers of CO2 ,CH4 and water vapor, strategically placed in different characteristic areas of the urban conurbation: the ICM stations is located at the Barcelona seafront, IDAEA station in a university campus near a high traffic route inside Barcelona city, Observatori Fabra in a meteorological observatory in the middle of a mountain range 300m above Barcelona skyline (at 410 meters above sea level), and ICTA in a university building rooftop in the second metropolitan ring.\n\nHere we present the results of the first two years of atmospheric monitoring data for these stations. The CO2 and CH4measurements are complemented with meteorological measurements to know the precedence of the air masses. The data obtained is used study the meteorological influence on concentrations and estimate the city's budget emissions with the help of models, in the frame of the URBAG project.\n\n11 Carbon Dew Community of Practice: Anchoring Fair and Equitable Climate Solutions in Direct Atmospheric Flux Measurement\n\nPoster\n\nGeorge Burba1,2,3*, Stefan Metzger4,5,6, CarbonDew CoP1\n\n1CarbonDew, Lincoln, USA. 2Water for Food Global Institute, Lincoln, USA. 3LI-COR, Lincoln, USA. 4CabonDew, Boulder, USA. 5AtmoFacts, Boulder, USA. 6University of Wisconsin, Madison, USA\n\nSession 15. Science communication and outreach to increase the impact of climate research\n\nThe Carbon Dew Community of Practice is an international non-profit representing carbon and climate experts from over 180 organizations. Our vision is to anchor fair and equitable climate solutions in direct atmospheric measurements, and our mission is to facilitate technology transfer by providing a medium for public and private entities to work together towards common goals. We strive to translate surface-atmosphere science into real-world impacts and innovate industry practices with the best available science. To achieve this, we support the integration and coordination of existing capabilities and resources for enhancing the measurement and quantification of GHG emissions and removals.\n\nInitial Endeavors:\n\nFormation of a well-rounded community representing all pertinent stakeholders and experts in climate solutions and GHG emissions trading.\n\nLaunching collective contributions to workshops and conferences aimed at educating on the significance of direct GHG measurements for equitable climate solutions and emissions trading.\n\nCollaborative creation of responses to government policy and funding proposals, co-authoring publications, and piloting projects to test the efficacy of specific methodologies.\n\nFuture phases will involve efforts towards comprehensive recommendations or protocols, ensuring a balance across environmental, economic, financial, and regulatory aspects to achieve practical and fair climate solutions globally.\n\nThis presentation offers a progress report on the latest available tools and other developments in practical technology transfer of flux tools from academia to wider society, the latest adoption examples from FAO to the oil and gas sector, and a progress report on the latest activities by the CarbonDew Community.\n\n12 Reduced-Cost Sensor for Direct Evapotranspiration and Sensible Heat Flux Measurements\n\nPoster\n\nGeorge Burba1,2*, Sasha Ivans3, Gerardo Fratini4\n\n1LI-COR, Lincoln, USA. 2Water for Food Global Institute, Lincoln, USA. 3LI-COR, Logan, USA. 4LI-COR, Berlin, Germany\n\nSession 3. Cross-domain technological development: autonomous vehicles, sensor miniaturisation, low-cost sensors and labour-intense approaches\n\nEvapotranspiration (ET) plays a vital role in the global water cycle, moving a staggering 500,000 km3 of water annually, with 70,000 km3 occurring over land. This amount surpasses the global water demand of approximately 4,600 km3 per year. By conserving just 5-10% of ET through retention in soil, groundwater, or freshwater bodies, a significant contribution can be made towards solving the global water scarcity issue.\n\nAccurate measurement of ET is essential for effective water management in specific areas. Unfortunately, conventional models such as potential, reference, max, equilibrium, and pan do not achieve the necessary level of accuracy, which is better than 5-10%. However, direct ET measurements using the eddy covariance method provide the required resolution. Historically, the high cost and complexity of this approach have limited its usage primarily to academic research.\n\nTo address these challenges, a new cost-effective solution for direct, automated, and real-time ET measurements has been developed. This technology extends the application of eddy covariance ET measurements beyond academia to broader research, regulatory, and commercial domains. The LI-710 sensor is a user-friendly device that measures ET, sensible heat, temperature, humidity, and air pressure every 30 minutes. It is significantly more affordable than typical flux stations, costing 5-10 times less, and consumes 3-15 times less power. Moreover, it can be easily installed and utilized by individuals with limited experience in the field.\n\nThe extensive field test results of this innovative technology will be compared with traditional higher-cost research-grade eddy covariance systems.\n\n13 Direct Flux Measurements for Immediate Social Benefits: Clear Explanations, Automated Instruments, Peer-To-Peer Data Sharing, and Weather Station-Inspired Approach\n\nPoster\n\nGeorge Burba*\n\nWater for Food Global Institute, Lincoln, USA. LI-COR, Lincoln, USA. CarbonDew, Lincoln, USA\n\nSession 14. Leveraging Direct Flux Measurements Beyond Academia for Real-World Applications\n\nContinental-scale research infrastructures and flux networks (e.g., AmeriFlux, AsiaFlux, ChinaFlux, ICOS, NEON, OzFlux) alongside smaller GHG flux networks and individual sites, assess CO2, CH4, and other GHG exchange, as well as evapotranspiration (ET), between ecosystems and the atmosphere.\n\nOver four decades, these flux stations have expanded to 2100+ stationary measurement points and various campaign sites. Initially for process-level studies, they now inform long-term climate modeling.\n\nThese high-resolution measurements utilize cutting-edge hardware, significantly surpassing typical monitoring methods, commonly applied outside academia. Yet, despite their potential for measuring GHG emissions and ET, these applications rarely extend beyond academia.\n\nKey barriers include the perceived complexity of the method, actual complexity and cost of current instrumentation and site operation, scarcity of geographic data coverage, and a lack of a comprehensive approach focused on using direct flux measurements for immediate societal benefits.\n\nThese challenges can be addressed by:\n\nSimplifying explanations and offering detailed guides for method understanding.\n\nDeveloping lower-cost simpler-to-use automated flux instrumentation, akin more to being a “flux sensor” than a “flux system”.\n\nFacilitating peer-to-peer cross-sharing to reduce data gaps and station setup costs.\n\nAdopting an approach inspired by current automated weather stations (AWS) feeding and tuning remotes sensing products and resulting in weather modeling and forecasting.\n\nThis presentation aims to catalyze discussions on utilizing flux measurements for practical decision-making applications to benefit society. It seeks to identify current needs, ideas, and examples for leveraging flux data in everyday decision contexts.\n\n14 The compatibility of ICOS, NEON, and TERN sampling designs, different camera setups for effective plant area index estimation with digital hemispherical photography\n\nPoster\n\nJan Pisek1*, Mait Lang1,2, Mihkel Kaha1, Shaohui Zhang3\n\n1University of Tartu, Toravere, Estonia. 2Estonian University of Life Sciences, Tartu, Estonia. 3University of Eastern Finland, Joensuu, Finland\n\nSession 17. Best Practices in the landscape of Research Infrastructures: Cooperation, Co-location and other lessons learned\n\nEnvironmental monitoring networks such as the Integrated Carbon Observation System (ICOS) in Europe, the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) in the U.S., or the Terrestrial Ecosystem Research Network (TERN) in Australia deploy different sampling schemes for in situ measurements. We report on the intercomparison of measurements of canopy gap fraction with different digital hemispherical photography setups adopting ICOS, NEON, and TERN sampling schemes. The test was carried out at the Järvselja Radiation Transfer Model Intercomparison (RAMI) birch stand, near the Station for Measuring Ecosystem-Atmosphere Relations (SMEAR) in Estonia. Results show that spreading out sampling points that cover more of the plot is important for a good representation of the forest as a whole. NEON tower plot layout scheme may be more prone to errors in overall canopy properties estimation than ICOS or TERN due to its compact sampling layout and should always be used in conjunction with its distributed plots. Different camera setups involving different camera operators, camera bodies, lenses, and settings yield slightly varied results, and it is important to ensure that the images are taken in such a way that they would not be over- or underexposed, or out of focus. In conclusion, we always recommend carrying out intercomparison measurements with old and new cameras when devices are upgraded. Our study contributes towards establishing the uncertainty and evaluating potential error budget stemming from collecting in situ measurements using different sampling schemes and camera setups.\n\n15 Northern European Forests’ carbon balance and management disturbances: the tale of the direct flux measurements\n\nOral\n\nSamuli Launiainen1*, Toprak Aslan2\n\n1Natural Resources Institute Finland, Helsinki, Finland. 2Finnish Meteorologica lnstitute, Helsinki, Finland\n\nSession 6. Greenhouse gas fluxes at high latitudes and climate/human induced feedbacks\n\nNorthern European Forests’ carbon balance has been monitored by eddy-covariance technique (EC) for nearly three decades. Given that the majority of forests in the region are actively managed, this relentless scientific endeavor is increasingly motivated by identifying the human pressures on forest carbon sink and seeking the climate mitigation potential of alternative forest management regimes. Even though valuable site-specific findings exist, a holistic understanding of forest carbon balances especially in the context of management is missing. Accordingly, here we summarize the means and variability of annual net ecosystem productivity (NEP), gross-primary productivity (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (Re) from more than 40 Northern European temperate, hemi-boreal and boreal forests to: 1) Reveal how well the current and legacy EC-measurements represent the climatic conditions, soils and site fertility types, age and species composition and management regimes; 2) Explore the primary drivers of site-to-site and inter-annual variability, and 3) Conclude what the direct flux measurements reveal on the impacts of management practices (clear-cutting, thinning/partial harvest, fertilization) and disturbance recovery. Finally, we attempt to build a data-driven model for NEP and its components over forest rotation cycles and discuss the pathway how EC-measurements can provide support for planning sustainable forest management.\n\n16 A web-based tool for the validation of Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-3 derived bio‐geophysical products against ICOS terrestrial ecosystems measurements\n\nOral\n\nNoelle Cremer1*, Dario Papale2,3, Giacomo Nicolini3, Simone Sabbatini3, Luke Brown4, Fabrizio Niro1\n\n1Serco for ESA/ESRIN, Rome, Italy. 2National Research Council - IRET, Porano, Italy. 3CMCC Foundation - Euro-Mediterranean Center on Climate Change, Lecce, Italy. 4University of Salford, Manchester, United Kingdom\n\nSession 17. Best Practices in the landscape of Research Infrastructures: Cooperation, Co-location and other lessons learned\n\nThis study aims to demonstrate how ICOS terrestrial ecosystem sites can serve as a network for validating Earth Observation products, thus enhancing spatial and temporal coverage of validation efforts. Focusing on the current ESA optical imaging sensors, the project aims to generate a match-up dataset of Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-3 observations over ICOS ecosystem sites for easing the validation of satellite-derived bio-geophysical products. The objective is to bridge the gap between ecosystem monitoring and satellite remote sensing communities, by facilitating the uptake and exploitation of ICOS data for validation purposes. The project focuses on the validation of a subset of vegetation parameters measured within the existing ICOS network, including key terrestrial Essential Climate Variables, specifically Fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation (FAPAR) and Leaf Area Index (LAI). As a main outcome of this activity, a set of Jupyter Notebooks on the Terrascope platform is developed and shared within the satellite Cal/Val community, allowing to read the ICOS data, extract the land biophysical products of interest and match them to the corresponding satellite overpasses. Issues such as the spatial representativeness of ICOS sites, the temporal sampling of satellite acquisitions and the inclusion of in-situ uncertainties as a step towards fiducial reference measurements are explored. Statistical metrics are provided within the Notebooks to estimate the suitability of the various sites for the validation at satellite pixel size. This tool is mainly developed to foster the usage of this invaluable ensemble of in-situ reference data for satellite calibration and validation purposes.\n\n17 Linking coastal biodiversity, carbon cycling, and climate feedback: hotspots and hot moments\n\nPoster\n\nNicolas-Xavier Geilfus1*, Kurt Spence1, Märta Brunberg1, Christoph Humborg2, Joanna Norkko1, Alf Norkko1\n\n1University of Helsinki, Hanko, Finland. 2Stockholm University, Stockholm, Sweden\n\nSession 7. Carbon Cycling along the Land Ocean Aquatic Continuum\n\nBiodiversity loss and climate change underscore the critical need for a deeper understanding of their intricate interactions. Coastal ecosystems are highly productive and dynamic in terms of carbon exchange between the ocean and the atmosphere. Due to their potential for carbon capture, those ecosystems hold significant potential as nature-based solution to mitigate climate change. Yet, their effects on carbon cycling and greenhouse gas (GHG) dynamics, including carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4), remain inadequately understood. This knowledge gap is compounded by substantial heterogeneity in marine biodiversity, further complicating the issue.\n\nIn response to these challenges, the CoastClim initiative aims to quantify how spatial variations in biodiversity and ecosystem state, alongside with long-term (i.e., seasonal) and short-term (e.g., marine heatwaves events) variations, trigger the occurrence of hot spots and/or hot moments for interactions between marine biodiversity and GHG dynamics in coastal environments, in the Southern Finland.\n\nAt the Tvärminne Zoological Station, we continuously measured at high-resolution seawater concentration of CO2 and CH4 to investigate how seasonal cycles, influencing the type and intensity of primary and secondary production, will impact the production and consumption of GHG in the water column, and thereby affect their air-sea exchange (i.e., hot moments). In August 2023, field measurements performed across a land to sea gradient highlights the presence of hotspots where changes in coastal biodiversity could directly impact the observed surface seawater concentration of GHG, ranging from 160 to 2500 µatm for CO2 and from 20 to 470 nmol/L for CH4.\n\n19 Experimental investigation into the footprint of an urban canopy model in a boundary layer wind tunnel\n\nPoster\n\nHongyuan Jia*, Xiang Wang, Chao Lin, Hideki Kikumoto\n\nThe University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan\n\nSession 11. Quantification of urban greenhouse gas emissions - from novel monitoring to source identification\n\nAs a top-down approach to quantifying the greenhouse gas emissions to the atmosphere from urban areas, the real-time measurements from ground-based monitoring stations employing the eddy covariance technique are commonly coupled with footprint functions to realize the source identification. Although several numerical modeling methods for footprints have been proposed, their reliability in urban applications is not comprehensively validated by experimental data. Besides, it is still necessary to deepen our insight into the footprint features in urban areas through experiment investigations. In this research, we conducted a wind tunnel experiment to measure the concentration and flux footprints in a block-arrayed urban canopy model located in a neutrally stratified boundary layer. The velocity and concentration were measured by an X-probe hot wire anemometer and a fast-response flame ionization detector respectively. The vertical flux was evaluated using the time series data of velocity and concentration. According to the experimental experiments, the relationship between footprint distribution and measurement positions is clarified. The footprint function was found to be unique under different wind directions and cannot be simply approximated by a plume shape. These features can be divided into local and global patterns, which highly depend on building configurations. Moreover, the turbulent contribution ratio to the total flux corresponding to each emission position was calculated. It was found that the turbulent ratio exceeds 70% near the peak of footprint in most cases, which emphasizes the importance of accurate turbulent dispersion modeling in numerical methods.\n\n20 Evaluation of the behaviour of O2 and CO2 above a canopy of a forest and its application to further constrain the forest carbon balance\n\nOral\n\nKim Faassen1*, Jordi Vilà-Guerau de Arellano1,2, Raquel González-Armas1, Boaz Hilman3, Aleya Kaushik4,5, Bert A. M. Kers6, Ivan Mammarella7, Harro A.J. Meijer6, Wouter Peters1,6, Timo Vesala7,8, Ingrid T. Luijkx1\n\n1Meteorology and Air Quality, Wageningen University and Research, Wageningen, Netherlands. 2Atmospheric Chemistry Department, Max Planck Institute for Chemistry, Mainz, Germany. 3Department of Biogeochemical Processes, Max-Planck Institute for Biogeochemistry, Jena, Germany. 4Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences, University of Colorado Boulder, Boulder, USA. 5NOAA Global Monitoring Laboratory, Boulder, USA. 6University of Groningen, Centre for Isotope Research, Energy and Sustainability Research Institute Groningen, Groningen, Netherlands. 7Institute for Atmospheric and Earth System Research (INAR) / Physics, Faculty of Science, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland. 8INAR/Forest Sciences, Faculty of Agriculture and Forestry, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland\n\nSession 4. Processes involved in the greenhouse gas cycle in terrestrial ecosystems\n\nThe ratio between atmospheric O2:CO2, also called the Exchange Ratio (ER), serves as a valuable tracer for comprehending the carbon cycle at both local and global scales. We investigate the applicability of the ER, focusing on characterizing ERs of biosphere exchange. We have conducted measurements above a boreal forest in Hyytiälä, Finland, during the spring and summer of 2018 and 2019, where we measured O2 and CO2 mole fractions at two heights above the canopy. Integration of the observational data with a conceptual land-atmosphere model reveals that diurnal variations of ERs from single-height O2 and CO2 mole fractions often do not directly reflect forest exchange dynamics. Consequently, careful consideration of the time of day is essential for single-height measurements. The ERs derived from inferred surface fluxes based on the vertical gradient measurements provide a more precise representation of the processes driving the forest exchange. The observed diurnal averaged ER signal from the boreal forest, of 0.83, exhibits temporal fluctuations, challenging the commonly assumed constant biosphere ER value of 1.1. To expand on our diurnal analysis of the ER, we have integrated O2 into the Simple Biosphere Model (SiB4) to explore temporal and spatial variations in the biosphere ERs across different ecosystems. Validation of the model is done with measurements from high-towers where O2 and CO2 mole fractions are measured at multiple heights. This comprehensive study aims to enhance our understanding of biosphere ER variability and its implications as a tracer in carbon cycle research.\n\n21 Co-location of measurement sites – what does it mean and what is the added value it provides?\n\nOral\n\nNiku Kivekäs1*, Elena Saltikoff2, Jaana Bäck3\n\n1ACTRIS ERIC, Helsinki, Finland. 2ICOS ERIC, Helsinki, Finland. 3University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland\n\nSession 17. Best Practices in the landscape of Research Infrastructures: Cooperation, Co-location and other lessons learned\n\nACTRIS, ICOS and eLTER are distributed research infrastructures (RIs) providing data from hundreds of measurement sites spread over Europe and beyond, focusing on different components and processes of the environment. Co-location of the measurement sites of different RIs can provide scientific added value and economic savings compared to a situation where the sites are entirely separated, and this has been recognized by both the scientific community and research infrastructure funders. But what does this co-location actually mean?\n\nFrom a scientific perspective it is a question of integrating data provided by different RIs and spatial continuity of the measured parameters. Flux and process measurements provide data from very small areas and cannot be extrapolated in a heterogenic environment, therefore requiring very close co-location. Measurements of atmosphere above the canopy level and especially those done via remote sensing can represent conditions and sources averaged over thousands of km2 if the topography is sufficiently homogenous. This means that the measurement sites of different RIs can sometimes be located tens of kms apart and still provide scientific added value due to co-location and potential for up- or downscaling. It depends on the parameters and metadata included and planned use of data.\n\nFrom an economic perspective co-location enables use of the same physical infrastructure (buildings, roads, electricity) and maintenance for a larger number of instruments contributing to several RIs. In this case the potential benefits require that the sites are very close to each other, and access to all instruments is agreed between host organizations.\n\n22 Resilience of Estuarine Ecosystems to Sediment Dynamics and Climate Variability elevation\n\nPoster\n\nVincent Malului*\n\nPwani University-Kenya, Kilifi-Kenya, Kenya\n\nSession 15. Science communication and outreach to increase the impact of climate research\n\nEstuaries, as transitional zones between freshwater rivers and marine environments, play a crucial role in coastal ecosystems worldwide. However, they are increasingly vulnerable to the impacts of sediment dynamics and climate variability. This project aims to monitor estuarine sedimentation in correlation to sea-level rise and investigate the resilience of estuarine ecosystems in the face of these challenges.\n\nThrough a multidisciplinary approach combining field observations, remote sensing, and modeling techniques, we will assess the long-term changes in sediment deposition patterns and sea-level rise impacts on estuarine environments. Daily monitoring of sea surface temperatures will provide crucial insights into the influence of climate variability on estuarine ecosystems.\n\nThe study will focus on a specific estuarine system, employing sediment core analysis to reconstruct historical sedimentation rates and characterize sediment properties. By integrating historical data with contemporary observations, we will identify trends in sediment dynamics and their relationship with sea-level rise.\n\nFurthermore, we will investigate the response of estuarine biota to these environmental stressors. Biological surveys will assess the abundance and distribution of key species, including benthic organisms and submerged vegetation, providing insights into ecosystem health and adaptation strategies.\n\nUnderstanding the resilience mechanisms of estuarine ecosystems is essential for effective management and conservation efforts. This research will contribute valuable knowledge to inform coastal resource management practices, including habitat restoration, sediment management, and climate adaptation and control strategies. The project seeks to enhance our ability to mitigate the impacts of environmental change on coastal regions and promote the sustainable stewardship of estuarine habitats.\n\n23 Clumped isotope signatures of atmospheric CO2 sources\n\nPoster\n\nRichmal B. Paxton1*, Jan Kaiser1, Alina D. Marca1, Paul F. Dennis1, Penelope A. Pickers1,2, Grant L. Forster1,2,\n\n1Centre for Ocean and Atmospheric Sciences, School of Environmental Sciences, University of East Anglia, Norwich, United Kingdom. 2National Centre for Atmospheric Science, University of East Anglia, Norwich, United Kingdom\n\nSession 11. Quantification of urban greenhouse gas emissions - from novel monitoring to source identification\n\nAccurately identifying sources of greenhouse gases is important in order to verify and assist in quantification and modelling of greenhouse gas fluxes. For CO2 emissions, stable isotope measurements of carbon and oxygen are commonly utilised. The use of δ(13C) and δ(18O) as tracers of atmospheric CO2 are, however, complicated by overlaps in isotopic signatures of CO2 sources. The clumped isotope excess, Δ47 (which is a measure of the deviation from the statistical abundance of 13C-18O bonds in CO2) can aid in the distinction of CO2 sources, as the abundance depends on CO2 formation temperature, rather than the abundance of elemental isotopes.\n\nHere we aim to present measurements of Δ47 from a variety of locations. These include a UK cement works, which shows the influence of high temperature combustion processes; Alice Holt Forest (Surrey, UK), which is influenced by plant respiration and photosynthesis; and Weybourne Atmospheric Observatory (Norfolk coast, UK) which is situated close to the North Sea and may be influenced both by local sea-air gas exchange and urban plumes, depending on the air mass origin. Distinct differences between each site allow deriving an improved range of Δ47 signatures from different sources and complement information on the sources of CO2 emissions from the other CO2 stable isotope signatures δ(13C), δ(18O) and Δ(17O).\n\n24 Hot Spots and Hot Moments in Greenhouse Gas (CO2, CH4 and N2O) Fluxes in a Diverse Coastal Ecosystem\n\nOral\n\nMärta Brunberg1*, Christoph Humborg2,1, Alf Norkko1,2, Aki Vähä1,3, Marc Geibel2, Florian Roth2,1\n\n1Tvärminne Zoological Station, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland. 2Baltic Sea Centre, Stockholm University, Stockholm, Sweden. 3Institute of Atmospheric and Earth System Research / Physics, Faculty of Science, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland\n\nSession 7. Carbon Cycling along the Land Ocean Aquatic Continuum\n\nCoastal ecosystems have high rates of organic matter (OM) accumulation and can act as efficient net sinks of carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere, which makes them suitable for nature-based climate change mitigation. At the same time, concurrent natural emissions of methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) produced during OM degradation may impede the net radiative forcing benefit. Here, we simultaneously measured CO2, CH4, and N2O surface water concentrations, and calculated their associated sea-air emissions, using an underway survey technique in a 28 ha semi-enclosed bay in the Baltic Sea with various vegetated and unvegetated bottom substrates during seven campaigns from October 2021 to August 2022. Bottom habitats included rocks with macroalgae, and soft sediments with or without various macrophytes, such as Zostera marina and Myriophyllum spicatum. We report net greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes from surface waters ranging from -874.5 mg CO2eq m-2 d-1 in May (net sink) to 70.9 mg CO2eq m-2 d-1 in December (net source), with large temporal and spatial variability. Additionally, we show that the highest emissions generally occurred in sheltered and vegetated areas of the bay. Throughout the year, net uptake of CO2 by vegetation was offset by 5 to 44 % by concurrent CH4 and N2O emissions. Coastal vegetated bays may indeed function as net sinks of atmospheric CO2eq over an annual cycle, but concurrent CH4 and N2O emissions, and the natural heterogeneity of such fluxes should be taken into account to establish informed climate change mitigation strategies.\n\n25 International Governance of Marine Carbon Dioxide Removal: Bridging the Divide Between the Global Climate Regime and the Global Ocean Governance Regime\n\nPoster\n\nRoman Webb*\n\nColumbia Law School, New York, USA. Columbia Climate School, New York, USA\n\nSession 8. Enhancing the ocean carbon sink: the science, verification, and governance of marine-based carbon dioxide removal (mCDR)\n\nWith the impacts of climate change intensifying and progress in reducing emissions continuing to lag, the parties to the Paris Agreement are increasingly looking at greenhouse gas removal as a climate change mitigation tool. Marine-based carbon dioxide removal (mCDR) has received particular attention under the Paris Agreement recently. At a meeting in late 2023, the parties to the Paris Agreement stressed “the importance of conserving, protecting and restoring . . . marine ecosystems” as carbon sinks and called for “accelerating” carbon removal. Just a few weeks earlier, however, the parties to another set of international agreements – the London Convention and Protocol – had proposed new restrictions on mCDR. In justifying the restrictions, the parties rightly noted that there is currently limited understanding of mCDR techniques, and raised valid concerns about the risks they present. The parties recognized the need for further research into mCDR but indicated that only “legitimate scientific research” should be allowed. While this approach may have theoretical appeal, in practice, determining what research is legitimate is proving difficult. There are growing concerns that restrictions adopted under the London Convention / Protocol will block research needed to determine what (if any) role mCDR might play in achieving the Paris Agreement’s goals. This presentation will explore the reasons behind, and implications of, the growing disconnect between the two treaty regimes. It will also explore options for promoting greater coherence in international governance of mCDR, including the possibility of using the new High Seas Treaty to comprehensively regulate mCDR.\n\n26 MISO - Autonomous in-situ observation platform for hard-to-reach areas\n\nPoster\n\nLona van Delden1*, Tuan Vu Cao2, Torbjørn Heltne2, Claire Treat1\n\n1AWI, Potsdam, Germany. 2NILU, Kjeller, Norway\n\nSession 3. Cross-domain technological development: autonomous vehicles, sensor miniaturisation, low-cost sensors and labour-intense approaches\n\nMISO will develop and demonstrate an autonomous in-situ observation platform for hard-to-reach areas, such as the Arctic and wetlands overall. We are working on a new design to detect and quantify CO2 and CH4 fluxes, using a combination of stationary and mobile (drone) solutions. Our system will require minimum on-site intervention when deployed. In the MISO project, the AWI team is leading the development of the GHG flux chambers and leading the proof of concept for deployment in wetland and Arctic ecosystems. The new chamber design is focusing on lower cost, low weight and low energy consumption. Each self-contained chamber includes an integrated MISO sensor, self-power, and innovative communication solutions in rural areas.\n\n27 Consequences of intense drought on CO2 & CH4 fluxes and evapotranspiration rates of the reed ecosystem at Lake Neusiedl\n\nPoster\n\nPamela Baur1, 2*, Andreas Maier1, Claudia Buchsteiner1, Thomas Zechmeister2, Stephan Glatzel1\n\n1Geoecology, Department of Geography and Regional Research, University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria. 2Biological Station Lake Neusiedl, Illmitz, Austria.\n\nSession 5. Impact of climate extremes on GHG fluxes: understanding driving processes and responses across scales\n\nWetlands with reeds (Phragmites australis) are widely recognized as strong carbon (C) sinks due to the high productivity of reed and its fixation in the soil. Lake Neusiedl is an internationally important wetland (Ramsar, UNESCO World Heritage Site) that had been affected by droughts since mid-2015. However, the impact of drought on reed-dominated wetlands and the contribution of Central European reed ecosystems as a source of greenhouse gases (GHG) are not well understood. The aim of this multi-year study (mid-2018 to 2022) was to investigate the drought-influenced C & water fluxes and their drivers in the reed ecosystem of this subsaline lake. We used eddy covariance technique to quantify GHG exchange between reed ecosystem & atmosphere and vegetation indices to account for reed growth.\n\nThe results showed a 76% decrease in CH4 emissions from 9.2 g C m-2 a-1 (2019) to 2.2 g C m-2 a-1 (2022), mainly due to the falling water level and the associated drying out of the reed belt. Initially, net CO2 emissions decreased by 85% from 181 g C m-2 a-1 (2019) to 27 g C m-2 a-1 (2021), as the reed grew into formerly water-covered areas within the reed belt. In 2022, however, net CO2 emissions increased to twice the 2019 level due to the consequence of the sharp drop in sediment water content from 65 to 32 Vol-% in mid-2022.\n\nOverall, drought led to a decoupling of the reed belt from the lake and turned the wetland into a strong C source.\n\n28 Carbon flux responses of Alpine ecosystems to combined future climate drivers: Exploring different climate scenarios\n\nPoster\n\nFederica D'Alò1*, Olga Gavrichkova1, Carlotta Volterrani1, Maurizio Sarti1, Alexandru Milcu2, Sebastien Devidal2, Enrico Brugnoli1, Angela Augusti1\n\n1; Institute of Research on Terrestrial Ecosystems, National Research Council, Porano, Italy. 2Montpellier European Ecotron, Univ Montpellier, CNRS, Montferrier-Sur-Lez, France\n\nSession 5. Impact of climate extremes on GHG fluxes: understanding driving processes and responses across scales\n\nDuring the 21st century, alpine areas are experiencing warming above the global average, making them more sensitive to climate change, with potentially dramatic effects on the release of significant quantities of CO2. Indeed, an expected impact of climate change is the alteration of the balance between carbon assimilation, through photosynthesis, in plant biomass and storage in soils, and its release to the atmosphere via respiration. To predict the effects of climate change on CO2 fluxes, monoliths were collected from an alpine ecosystem (2500m a.s.l.) in the Mont Blanc area (Val Veny, Courmayeur, Italy) and transferred to the Montpellier European Ecotron (CNRS, France) for climate manipulation experiments. Monoliths were exposed to current (~ 420ppm CO2, Control), and 2 future climate scenarios (~ 550ppm CO2 and ~ 800ppm CO2, according to RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5, respectively) forecasted for 2070. The Ecotron’s experimental chambers allowed to manipulate different climate variables, such as temperature, precipitation, relative humidity, radiation, and CO2 concentration, simultaneously. To assess flux responses, measurements of gross primary productivity (GPP), ecosystem respiration (Reco), and net ecosystem exchange (NEE) were performed twice a week over the summer period. While the differences in terms of fluxes between Control and RCP 4.5 were small, for the RCP 8.5 a greater GPP and more noticeable Reco were observed compared to the other scenarios. Nevertheless, the NEE in RCP 8.5 showed that the alpine ecosystem could work as a sink compared to the other two scenarios, likely attributed to a substantial increase in green canopy.\n\n29 Metrological concepts applied to total alkalinity measurements in support of ocean alkalinity enhancement assessment\n\nPoster\n\nGaëlle Capitaine1,2*, Paola Fisicaro2, Thibaut Wagener1\n\n1MIO, Marseille, France. 2LNE, Paris, France\n\nSession 8. Enhancing the ocean carbon sink: the science, verification, and governance of marine-based carbon dioxide removal (mCDR)\n\nOcean alkalinity enhancement (OAE), a method considered for marine Carbon Dioxide Removal, involves increasing seawater alkalinity by adding alkaline substances as crushed rocks or dissolved compounds. This technique aims to increase CO2 absorption of the ocean, but also to mitigate ocean acidification.\n\nPrior to large-scale implementation of OAE, establishing a robust Monitoring, Reporting, and Verification system is crucial. It is advisable to monitor various variables, including total alkalinity (TA) together with at least one additional parameter of the carbonate system, to assess the OAE effectiveness. TA measurements serve multiple purposes, including computing essential carbonate chemistry parameters, quantifying background alkalinity, and confirming the efficient addition of alkalinity. Therefore, applying metrological concepts as validation of measurement procedures, uncertainty quantification, and metrological traceability, is imperative.\n\nAlthough existing reference materials (RMs) for TA measurements offer valuable support to the oceanographic community, they lack complete traceability and thorough uncertainty assessment. To address this, a reference material made in artificial seawater, characterized using an SI-traceable reference method, and with rigorously quantified uncertainty is being developed. Distributing this RM alongside a natural seawater sample, as Scripps’ one, could enhance the accuracy of TA results. The presentation will include results from an inter-laboratory comparison conducted on this reference material and propose traceability route, along with a preliminary estimation of the open-cell multi-step potentiometric titration measurement method of TA. The implications of this work in providing reliable TA data for assessing OAE and, more broadly, the role of NMI services in ensuring reliable ocean observation, will finally be discussed.\n\n30 Local-level CO2 emissions and their spatial variability in two contrasting cities Helsinki and Beijing\n\nOral\n\nLeena Järvi*\n\nUniversity of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland\n\nSession 11. Quantification of urban greenhouse gas emissions - from novel monitoring to source identification\n\nComprehensive understanding of CO2 emissions and sinks are needed to support climate actions in cities. Atmospheric observations have the challenge of measuring the total CO2 concentration or flux providing little information on the detailed urban CO2 flux dynamics. Here the role of bottom-up approaches in estimating the emissions strengths and spatial distributions become important as they can provide detailed information on emission and sink hotspots. In this study, the Surface Urban Energy and Water Balance Scheme (SUEWS) is used to examine the distribution of local-level direct CO2 emissions and biogenic emissions and sinks in Helsinki (Finland) and Beijing (China). The main aims are to 1) quantify the local emissions and their spatial variability, and 2) examine the strength of the emissions and biogenic sinks as a function of urban land cover. In both cities, traffic is major contributor to the local-level emissions varying from 38% to 42%. In Beijing, emissions from local building heating were almost equal to the traffic emissions, whereas in Helsinki only minor contribution was seen due to extensive district heating. Human metabolism contributed 58% and 13% in Helsinki and Beijing, respectively showing its importance in urban carbon dynamics. Largest CO2 sinks were seen in natural forested areas in Helsinki whereas in Beijing the forest in montane areas remained weaker sink compared to urban forests due to lower air temperatures. Vegetation within the built neighborhoods also have a significant impact on net CO2 sinks, contributing almost half of the net CO2 sinks in Helsinki.\n\n31 Summer greenhouse gases spatial variability from Southern Greenland Fjords to subpolar North Atlantic Ocean\n\nPoster\n\nCoraline Leseurre1*, Bruno Delille2, Roobaert Alizée1, Wieter Boone1, Odile Crabeck2, Leandro Ponsoni1, Hannelore Theetaert1, Michiel T'Jampens1, Silke Verbrugge1, Thanos Gkritzalis1\n\n1Flanders Marine Institute, VLIZ, Ostende, Belgium. 2Chemical Oceanography Unit, ULiège, Liège, Belgium\n\nSession 6. Greenhouse gas fluxes at high latitudes and climate/human induced feedbacks\n\nSince the beginning of the industrial era, the atmospheric greenhouse gases (GHG) have increased continuously (around +50% for carbon dioxide (CO2) and +150% for methane (CH4), for the two most important), causing the current climate change. In November 2023, the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) highlighted once again there are still significant uncertainties about the carbon cycle and its fluxes, and stressed the importance to follow the non-CO2 GHG with greater global warming potential.\n\nThe subpolar North Atlantic Ocean is a major CO2 sink, whereas the continental shelf and fjords show more spatial-temporal variability and poor regional coverage of sea-air CO2 flux data due to the lack of in-situ observational data. While surface seawaters are naturally supersaturated in CH4, the Arctic region (including Southern Greenland fjords) is subject to rapid warming and, therefore, is susceptible to substantial CH4 release into the atmosphere, further exacerbating global warming.\n\nTo improve our knowledge, it is essential to increase observational efforts to reduce uncertainties on the ocean CO2 sink and monitoring CH4 levels in high-latitude surface waters where changes have already been observed. To do so, we measured CO2 and CH4 concentrations and calculated their fluxes, in surface water during a summer cruise (July-August 2023) conducted on board the RV Belgica in the subpolar North Atlantic Ocean, between Iceland and Southern Greenland Fjords. The data were obtained using a custom-made air-water equilibration system, that was connected to the vessel’s non-toxic seawater supply (equilibrator and Cavity Ring Down Spectrometer) and discrete sampling.\n\n32 URBFLUX project: Monitoring urban and peri-urban CO2 and energy fluxes in the city of Valencia.\n\nPoster\n\nArnaud Carrara*, Ramon Lopez Jimenez, Vicent Calatayud\n\nFundacion Centro de Estudios Ambientales del Mediterraneo (CEAM), Paterna, Spain\n\nSession 11. Quantification of urban greenhouse gas emissions - from novel monitoring to source identification\n\nThe project URBFLUX focuses on the city of Valencia as an “urban laboratory”, with the general objective to provide science-based information that can be used by municipalities and other stakeholders to mitigate CO2 emissions, reduce air pollution, and regulate temperature in the urban environment by using green infrastructure. One specific objective is to investigate the urban CO2 emissions and sinks of the urban area of Valencia. In the frame of the project, three eddy covariance (EC) stations were deployed in 2023, in an urban area, an urban vegetated pedestrian area, and in a protected periurban area of horticultural crops. These stations will produce relevant observations on the dynamic of CO2 fluxes in urban and peri-urban environment, but also on sensible and latent heat fluxes, to better understand the role of vegetation in regulating air temperature at both local and city scale. Another specific objective is to estimate ecosystem services provided by tree vegetation at the scale of Valencia city using the i-TREE software tool model. The outputs of the model will be air pollution removal, BVOCs emissions, gross and net annual carbon sequestration, trees sequestering most net carbon in the city, and energy savings by trees. We present an overview of the project and preliminary results from CO2 fluxes measurements.\n\n33 Temporal and vertical variation of in-situ methane turnover from stable isotope studies at a boreal peatland\n\nOral\n\nXuefei Li1*, Janne Rinne2, Timo Vesala1,3\n\n1Institute for Atmospheric and Earth System Research (INAR)/Physics, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland. 2Natural Resources Institute Finland, Helsinki, Finland. 3Institute for Atmospheric and Earth System Research (INAR)/Forest Sciences, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland\n\nSession 6. Greenhouse gas fluxes at high latitudes and climate/human induced feedbacks\n\nBoreal peatlands emit substantial amounts of CH4 to the atmosphere. Understanding the dynamics of the co-occuring and seasonally varying processes underlying CH4 emissions remains a challenge. Stable isotope signatures of the CH4 in soil pore water and emitted CH4 can provide valuable insight on these processes.\n\nWe conducted a systematic study using on-line stable isotope measurements to understand the annual cycle of CH4 turnover in a typical boreal peatland (Siikaneva fen) in Southern Finland. We conducted continuous measurements of dissolved CH4 concentrations and its δ13C natural abundance signatures at 10, 30 and 50cm belowground. In addition, measurements at 40cm above peatland surface were used to estimate ecosystem-scale average δ13C value of the emitted CH4.\n\nResults showed systematic differences in the vertical profiles of CH4 concentrations and its δ13C values between winter and summer. CH4 concentrations from all the depths were higher in summer than in winter. The highest concentration of CH4 was observed at 30cm depth. δ13C values of CH4 in peat were highest in the deeper layer and lowest in the surface layer in winter, while the opposite pattern was found in summer. As expected, the CH4 production pathway shifted towards acetoclastic methanogenesis during the winter-summer transition. In winter, the δ13C values from emitted CH4 were higher than those from the soil indicating CH4 oxidation, while in summer the opposite was found due to CH4 diffusive plant transport. We observed hysteresis-like behavior between CH4 concentration and δ13C indicating time-lagged CH4 production to soil temperature and substrate availability.\n\n34 Modelling the CO2 transport through secondary circulations\n\nOral\n\nLuise Wanner1*, Martin Jung2, Sreenath Paleri3,4, Brian Butterworth5,6, Ankur Desai7, Matthias Sühring8,9, Matthias Mauder10,11\n\n1TUD Dresden University of Technology, Dresden, Germany. 2Max Planck Institute for Biogeochemistry, Jena, Germany. 3University of Oklahoma, Norman (OK), USA. 4NOAA/Air Resources Laboratory, Oak Ridge (TN), USA. 5University of Colorado Boulder, Boulder (CO), USA. 6National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Boulder (CO), USA. 7University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison (WI), USA. 8Leibniz Universität Hannover, Hannover, Germany. 9Pecanode GmbH, Goslar, Germany. 10TUD Dresden Technical University, Dresden, Germany. 11Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Karlsruhe, Germany\n\nSession 4. Processes involved in the greenhouse gas cycle in terrestrial ecosystems\n\nThe investigation of the systematic energy balance gap has indicated that a part of the energy transport is not carried out by small-scale turbulence but by so called secondary circulations, which are large eddies spanning the entire atmospheric boundary layer vertically. The share of energy transported by secondary circulations is especially large over thermally heterogeneous surfaces and cannot be captured by typical 30-minute single-tower eddy covariance measurements by definition. It is highly probable that these secondary circulations also transport other substances, such as CO2, which results in an underestimation of the CO2 fluxes by single-tower eddy covariance measurements. The transport through secondary circulations can be quantified as dispersive fluxes. We present a novel model that is able to predict the dispersive CO2 flux, which is an extension of an already existing model of the dispersive sensible and latent heat fluxes. The model has been developed by combining a machine-learning approach with a large set of idealized large-eddy simulations covering different surface-heterogeneity scales and stability regimes and it can be applied to 30-minute eddy covariance measurements without additional instrumentation. The application of the models for sensible and latent dispersive heat fluxes to real-world measurements and realistic large-eddy simulations from the CHEESEHEAD19 project indicate a good agreement. Here we show that the approach is transferable to dispersive CO2 fluxes and test the model on the realistic CHEESEHEAD19 large-eddy simulations.\n\n35 Design, operation, and insights from Zürich city’s mid- and low-cost ICOS Cities CO2 sensor network\n\nPoster\n\nStuart Grange1,2*, Pascal Rubli1, Andrea Fischer1, Christoph Hueglin1, Nikolai Ponomarev1, Dominik Brunner1, Lukas Emmenegger1\n\n1Empa, Dübendorf, Switzerland. 2University of York, York, United Kingdom\n\nSession 11. Quantification of urban greenhouse gas emissions - from novel monitoring to source identification\n\nA carbon dioxide (CO2) sensor network was deployed across the city of Zürich (Switzerland) in mid-2022 as a component of the ICOS Cities project. ICOS Cities has the overall objective of quantifying CO2 emissions in urban areas and to assess a wide range of methods to achieve this goal. The CO2 sensor network is composed of 180 nondispersive infrared (NDIR) sensors at two broad cost points labelled mid- and low-cost. The mid-cost sensors are generally installed with inlets at roof level and are deployed with reference gases to enable the sensors to achieve very good levels of measurement performance (RMSE of less than 1.5 ppm and biases within ±1 ppm at hourly resolution). The low-cost sensors are an order of magnitude cheaper, are generally installed at street level, and their calibration instability over time, i.e., drift, is addressed with network calibration methods that utilise the trusted mid-cost sensor observations. Although the main utility of the sensor network is to provide observations for atmospheric inversion modelling systems, the sensor network itself provides value by illuminating Zürich city's CO2 gradients and source-sink dynamics. For example, the city's CO2 spatial gradient is between 30 and 35 ppm depending on the season, the city's regional background CO2 is highly variable, and biogenic emissions combined with very stable nocturnal boundary layer processes can drive peak CO2 mole fractions over 700 ppm in the very early morning at some monitoring sites. The design, operation, and results of the sensor network will be further detailed and presented.\n\n36 Fossil Fuel CO2 gradients and emissions in London observed using Radiocarbon (14C) Measurements\n\nOral\n\nFang Liu1*, Mathias Lanoiselle2, Xiaomei Xu3, Heather Graven1\n\n1Imperial College London, London, United Kingdom. 2Royal Holloway University of London, London, United Kingdom. 3University of California Irvine, California, USA\n\nSession 11. Quantification of urban greenhouse gas emissions - from novel monitoring to source identification\n\nUrban areas accommodate over half of the global population and contribute more than 60% to greenhouse gas emissions. The increase in greenhouse gases, notably CO2, primarily stems from fossil fuel emissions. However, accurately quantifying fossil CO2 emissions in urban regions remains challenging due to complex and varied sources, including anthropogenic and biogenic factors, and spatiotemporal variability. Radiocarbon (14C) measurements in atmospheric CO2 provide a method to differentiate between fossil and non-fossil sources, as fossil carbon lacks 14C. At Imperial College London, we conducted 14C measurements to assess fossil fuel CO2 emissions and biospheric CO2 fluxes at three sites across London between 2022 and 2023. We used a sampling system that adsorbs CO2 onto a molecular sieve trap after removing water, with the sampled CO2 desorbed through heating for measurement. The measurement uncertainty is below 2‰. We find that the fossil fuel CO2 emissions exhibited the highest levels during the winter months for all the three sites across London, whereas biospheric CO2 exhibited the lowest values during the spring-summer seasons. The ongoing warming trend in spring enhanced the uptake of photosynthetic CO2, leading to the most significant seasonal shift in net ecosystem CO2 exchange.\n\n37 Leveraging In Situ Data for Climate and Environmental Policy Support\n\nPoster\n\nAdolphus Ifeka*\n\nFederal University of Technology, Akure, Nigeria\n\nSession 13. In situ data for climate and other environmental services and policy support\n\nUsing in situ data is essential for sustaining environmental services and guiding policy decisions in the age of rapidly increasing climate change and environmental degradation. In order to incorporate in situ data into frameworks for environmental and climate policy, this article highlights important findings and methods from the fields of Meteorology and Climate science.\n\nThis study examines the value of in situ data in improving the precision and dependability of climate models, enabling efficient environmental monitoring, and assisting with the development of evidence-based policy. It draws on my professional experience with the Nigerian Meteorological Agency. This report emphasizes the transformational potential of in situ data in solving modern environmental concerns by integrating empirical facts and best practices.\n\nOne of the main topics covered is how to incorporate in situ data into climate change mitigation.\n\nKeywords: In situ data, Climate change, Environmental policy, Sustainability, Policy support.\n\n38 Photosynthetic leaf-level temperature response of dominant tree species in a humid lowland tropical forest of the Congo Basin\n\nPoster\n\nThomas Sibret1*, Marc Peaucelle2, Kristine Crous3, Felicien Meunier1, Ivan Janssens4, Marijn Bauters1, Hans Verbeeck1, Pascal Boeckx1\n\n1UGent, Gent, Belgium. 2INRAE, Bordeaux, France. 3Western Sydney University, Penrith, Australia. 4UAntwerp, Antwerp, Belgium\n\nSession 5. Impact of climate extremes on GHG fluxes: understanding driving processes and responses across scales\n\nTropical forests, crucial components of the global carbon cycle, are increasingly threatened by climate change. Recent studies emphasize the concerning trend of tropical tree species approaching their thermal limits, resulting in a decrease in net carbon uptake above current ambient temperatures. These findings, combined with the historically stable climate of tropical regions, raise concerns about these forests' ability to adapt to rapid temperature changes and the growing frequency of climate extremes.\n\nMoreover, the influence of canopy position on temperature-response of photosynthesis remains poorly understood, despite its potential significance in shaping ecosystem dynamics. Variations in physiological and morphological traits across canopy layers suggest nuanced responses to rising temperatures, with implications for species distributions and forest resilience.\n\nTo address these knowledge gaps, we conducted field-based leaf chamber measurements in the Congo Basin, housing the world's second-largest tropical forest, at the CongoFlux research site [Station ID: CD-Ygb]. Leveraging the presence of an ICOS flux tower enables the comparison of our leaf-level data with ecosystem-level measurements, facilitating comprehensive analyses from individual species to ecosystem-scale processes.\n\nDoing so, our study aims to provide the first comprehensive dataset on leaf-level photosynthetic parameters for dominant tree species in an African lowland tropical forest. By quantifying interspecific variation in photosynthetic capacity and exploring the influence of plant guilds, species, and vertical canopy position, we seek to enhance our understanding of forest dynamics and resilience to temperature changes.\n\n39 Advances and challenges of Solar-Induced chlorophyll Fluorescence (SIF) in understanding Arctic-Boreal carbon uptake across spatial-temporal scales: A review\n\nPoster\n\nRui Cheng*\n\nUniversity of Minnesota, St Paul, USA. Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, USA\n\nSession 6. Greenhouse gas fluxes at high latitudes and climate/human induced feedbacks\n\nSolar-Induced chlorophyll Fluorescence (SIF), a good proxy for vegetation CO2 uptake, has been broadly utilized to assess vegetation dynamics and carbon uptake at the global scale. However, the full potential and limitations of SIF in the Arctic-Boreal region have not been explored. Therefore, this presentation summarizes a recently published review paper (doi: 10.1007/s40641-024-00194-8) of the latest insights into Arctic-Boreal carbon uptake through SIF analyses, underscoring the advances and challenges of SIF in solving emergent unknowns in this region. We will present evidence that cross-scale SIF measurements complement each other, offering valuable perspectives on Arctic-Boreal ecosystems, such as vegetation phenology, carbon uptake, carbon-water coupling, and ecosystem responses to disturbances. By incorporating SIF into land surface modeling, the understanding of Arctic-Boreal changes and their climate drivers can be mechanistically enhanced, providing critical insights into the changes of Arctic-Boreal ecosystems under global warming. While SIF measurements are more abundant and with finer spatiotemporal resolutions on the global scale, it is important to note that the coverage of these measurements is still limited and uneven in the Arctic-Boreal region, which addresses the importance of fostering a SIF network providing long-term and continuous measurements across spatial scales.\n\n40 Towards 2060 Carbon Neutrality: Air Pollution And Health Co-Benefits Of Climate Change Mitigation Of The Gba\n\nPoster\n\nChao REN1*, Edward NG2\n\n1Faculty of Architecture, The University of Hong Kong, Pokfulam, Hong Kong. 2School of Architecture, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin, Hong Kong\n\nSession 15. Science communication and outreach to increase the impact of climate research\n\nClimate change and air pollution are interrelated. Climate mitigation could bring multiple benefits, among which air pollution-related health cobenefits are the most important. With its carbon emissions expected to peak around 2030, the Chinese government strives to reach the ‘carbon neutral’ goal for the whole nation by 2060. Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau Greater Bay Area (GBA) is now the biggest rapidly developing economic and industrial region in China, with a population of 22 million. Its intensive industry and human activities have a significant influence on the national economy but at the cost of local air quality and intensifying climate change with substantial greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Local municipal and provincial governments of the GBA have pledged recently to achieve carbon neutrality by 2060. Concrete measures and pathways to achieve this ambitious target have yet to be made. Thus, it is important to explore the potential climate change mitigation pathways to 2060 carbon neutrality and to have a comprehensive assessment of air quality and health co-benefits of the implementation of climate change mitigation pathways for developing the optimised climate policy and a collective action plan for the local governments of the GBA to reach a win-win result. The study aims to link the climate change mitigation, air pollution reduction and health co-benefits together to explore the optimal pathways to achieve the targeted carbon neutrality in 2060.\n\n41 The ocean gliders capacity to estimate the air-sea CO2 flux: from machine learning tools to innovative sensors\n\nOral\n\nLaurent Coppola1*, Edouard Leymarie2, Paco Stil1, Felix Margirier3, Socratis Loucaides4, Janne-Markus Rintala5\n\n1Sorbonne University, Villefranche-sur-Mer, France. 2CNRS, Villefranche-sur-Mer, France. 3ALSEAMAR, Rousset, France. 4NOC, Southampton, United Kingdom. 5ICOS ERIC, Helsinki, Finland\n\nSession 3. Cross-domain technological development: autonomous vehicles, sensor miniaturisation, low-cost sensors and labour-intense approaches\n\nThe ocean is a major sink of anthropogenic CO2 (Friedlingstein et al., 2020). Estimates of the ocean's carbon sink are derived from global ocean biogeochemical models (Hauck et al., 2020) and reconstructions based on data concerning surface ocean partial pressures of CO2. The Surface Ocean CO2 Atlas (SOCAT) (Bakker et al., 2016) primarily relies on data obtained from underway sampling systems aboard voluntary observing ships. However, the limited coverage of data and the absence of observations throughout the entire seasonal cycle pose challenges to mapping methods, resulting in noisy reconstructions of surface ocean pCO2 (Denvil-Sommer et al., 2019). In response, the emergence of deep learning methods offers an alternative for predicting carbonate system variables (Sauzède et al., 2016; Fourrier et al., 2020). Nonetheless, fostering the advancement of robust and dependable technologies is imperative for enhancing observing systems. In this context, the European project GEORGE (grant 101094716) aims to develop new technologies to improve ocean observations that will represent the next level of long-term autonomous ocean observations. It will improve the coverage, continuity and spatio-temporal resolution of marine observations based on a variety of platforms operated by three ERICs (EMSO, ICOS and Euro-Argo). We will focus here on the development and integration of new sensors for carbonate system measurements (TA, TC, pH and pCO2). Of particular interest will be ocean glider-operated measurements and pCO2 and pH sensors in the Ligurian Sea, accompanied by acoustic measurements for better estimation of wind speed, an important parameter in CO2 air-sea flux calculations.\n\n42 Surface CO2 system dynamics along the western Mediterranean Sea based on high-frequency measurements from a Volunteer Observing Ship.\n\nOral\n\nDavid Curbelo-Hernandez, David Gonzalez-Santana, Aridane Gonzalez-Gonzalez, J Magdalena Santana Casiano, Melchor Gonzalez-Davila*\n\nInstituto de Oceanografía y Cambio Global. Universidad de Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, LAS PALMAS DE GRAN CANARIA, Spain\n\nSession 5. Impact of climate extremes on GHG fluxes: understanding driving processes and responses across scales\n\nThe spatio-temporal variations in the surface CO2 system along the western boundary of the Mediterranean Sea is evaluated. A high-resolution physicochemical dataset spanning 5 years (2019-2024) was built through automatically underway monitoring lead by the Surface Ocean Observation Platform aboard the Volunteer Observing Ship MV JONA SOPHIE ( ICOS SOOP CanOA-VOS). The ongoing warming of the surface Mediterranean was documented based on observations in this area. The sea surface temperature (SST) increased by 0.38±0.05 ºC yr-1 in the Alboran Sea and 0.30±0.04 ºC yr-1 along the eastern Iberian margin (p-values<0.01), which represent an acceleration in warming of 87.9% and 78.0%, respectively, compared to 2000-2019. These rates were found to be led by a rapidly increment in SST during summer, which contributed to modify the temporal evolution of the surface CO2 fugacity (fCO2,sw) and pH. Its interannual rates of change were 4.8 ± 0.6 µatm yr-1 and -0.005±0.001 units yr-1 in the Alboran Sea and 5.2 ± 0.4 µatm yr-1 and -0.006±0.001 units yr-1 in the eastern Iberian margin (p-values<0.01). The rise in fCO2,sw was governed by SST fluctuations (contributing by 59.1-63.0%) and compensated by variations in total inorganic carbon (27.9-31-6%). Both subregions behaved as a net atmospheric CO2 sink (average values -0.80±0.01 and -0.57±0.01 mol m2 yr-1). However, warming is favouring the outgassing during late summer and reducing by a 50% the annual uptake of CO2 from the atmosphere during the studied period (-0.52 mol m2 yr-1 in 2023 versus -1.02 mol m2 yr-1 in 2019).\n\n43 Shoots of mature European beech as important sinks for atmospheric nitrous oxide (N2O)\n\nOral\n\nKaterina Machacova1*, Thomas Schindler1,2, Laëtitia Bréchet3, Ülo Mander2,1, Thorsten E.

Processes involved in the greenhouse gas cycle in terrestrial ecosystems\n\nTree stems are known to emit but also consume nitrous oxide (N2O) from the atmosphere. Even though tree leaves dominate the tree surface area, they have been entirely excluded from field N2O flux measurements, and their role in forest N2O exchange is still unknown. We investigated the contribution of leaf fluxes to the forest N2O exchange. We determined the N2O exchange of stems and shoots (i.e. terminal branches including leaves) of mature European beech (Fagus sylvatica), and adjacent forest floor in a typical temperate upland forest in Southern Germany, using static chamber systems, portable greenhouse gas analyser and scaffold towers to reach the top of tree crowns. The beech stems, and especially the investigated shoots acted as net N2O sinks (−0.254 ± 0.827 µg N2O m−2 stem area h−1 and −4.54 ± 1.53 µg N2O m−2 leaf area h−1, respectively), while the forest floor was a net source (2.41 ± 1.08 µg N2O m−2 soil area h−1). Our pioneering study revealed a key mechanism at the net forest ecosystem N2O exchange: never-studied tree shoots can be substantial N2O sinks. Our results clearly show that excluding tree leaves from forest N2O flux measurements could lead to substantial uncertainties in the total N2O exchange between trees and the atmosphere, altering global forest greenhouse gas flux inventories.\n\n44 Flux measurements of carbon monoxide by eddy covariance over two pristine wetlands in high latitudes\n\nPoster\n\nAsta Laasonen1*, Kukka-Maaria Kohonen1,2, Erik Lundin3, Alexander Meire3, Ivan Mammarella1\n\n1Institute for Atmospheric and Earth System Research (INAR)/ Physics, Faculty of Science, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland. 2Department of Environmental Systems Science, Institute of Agricultural Sciences, ETH Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland. 3Swedish Polar Research Secretariat, Abisko Scientifc Research Station, Abisko, Sweden\n\nSession 6. Greenhouse gas fluxes at high latitudes and climate/human induced feedbacks\n\nCarbon monoxide (CO) plays a major role in atmospheric chemistry, being the largest sink of hydroxyl radical OH, which is the key oxidant in the atmosphere and determines the distributions of many other chemical species, including methane and ozone. Additionally, CO serves as an energy source for various soil microbes, playing a significant role in the carbon cycle.\n\nIn this study, we present the first eddy covariance time series of CO fluxes measured over two pristine wetlands. The study sites, Siikaneva fen in southern Finland and Abisko-Stordalen Palsa-bog in northern Sweden, are both classified as ICOS class 2 Ecosystem Stations. Measurements were conducted during the years 2019 and 2022-2023, respectively.\n\nWe observed systematic diurnal and seasonal cycles in the fluxes, with emissions during the daytime and near-zero fluxes or uptake during the night-time at both sites. Both sites were net CO sources during the snow-free periods, with greater spatial and temporal variability in fluxes observed in Stordalen than in Siikaneva. The CO emissions were driven by radiation and temperature, related to photo- and thermal degradation of organic matter. In Stordalen systematic soil consumption was observed in nighttime fluxes, whereas consumption was not observed in Siikaneva. The consumption in Stordalen was higher in the drier part of the mire, likely controlled by differences in soil properties.\n\nDespite the relatively small amount of carbon released as CO from wetlands, understanding the CO flux dynamics plays a crucial role in understanding soil processes and atmospheric chemistry.\n\n46 Addressing challenges in representing inter-annual variability of gross primary productivity fluxes using robust empirical and theory-based models\n\nOral\n\nRanit De1,2*, Shanning Bao1,3, Sujan Koirala1, Alexander Brenning2,4, Markus Reichstein1,4, Nuno Carvalhais1,4,5\n\n1Department for Biogeochemical Integration, Max-Planck-Institute for Biogeochemistry, 07745 Jena, Germany. 2Department of Geography, Friedrich Schiller University Jena, Löbdergraben 32, 07743 Jena, Germany. 3National Space Science Center, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 100190 Beijing, China. 4ELLIS Unit Jena, Jena, Germany. 5CENSE, Departamento de Ciências e Engenharia do Ambiente, Faculdade de Ciências e Tecnologia, Universidade NOVA de Lisboa, Caparica, Portugal\n\nSession 9. Combining data and models to improve estimates of regional to global GHG budgets and trends\n\nTerrestrial vegetation is crucial in the carbon cycle, primarily for mediating atmospheric CO2 fluxes through photosynthesis. The inter-annual variation (IAV) of gross primary production (GPP) is highly correlated with peak GPP frequency in diurnal cycles, yet biogeochemical models often fail to simulate these peaks. Here, we compare a light use efficiency (LUE) model and an eco-evolutionary optimality-based P-model to simulate the IAV of GPP. Both models estimate GPP at sub-daily scale, and are optimized for each site-year, site, plant functional type, and globally, followed by an evaluation at different temporal resolutions across 198 eddy-covariance sites of diverse climate-vegetation types. Hourly model (site-year optimization) evaluations show significantly higher performance (Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency, viz. NSE ≥ 0.6 for 93% and 86% of sites for LUE and P-model respectively) compared to yearly aggregated evaluations (NSE ≥ 0.6 for 44% and 29% of sites for LUE and P-model respectively). The LUE model performs better than P-model as we optimize parameters in temperature, vapor-pressure deficit functions and consider the cloudiness effects. Further investigation of the role of soil moisture stress reveals that it substantially improves the P-model’s (which already considers acclimation of parameters) performance (from an NSE of -0.94 to 0.93) in simulating annual average GPP per site-year. For both models, optimized parameter values vary more across the sites than in the site-years. Moreover, we analyze the role of data versus model epistemic uncertainty in estimating the IAV of GPP. Our model-data-integration experiments reveal current models’ limitations in capturing the IAV of carbon flux and guide their improvements.\n\n47 Evaluation of atmospheric CO2 transport across scales from cities to continents\n\nPoster\n\nAnna Agustí-Panareda1*, Michail Diamantakis1, Ivan Bastak-Duran2, Peter Bechtold2, Nicolas Bousserez2, Luca Cantarello2, Frédéric Chevallier3, Andreas Christen4, Richard Engelen2, Vincent de Feiter5, Chiel van Heerwaarden5, Leena Järvi6, Maarten Krol5, Ernest Koffi2, Thomas Lauvaux7, Sarah-Jane Lock1, Sylvie Malardel8, Wouter Peters5, Michel Ramonet3, Bart van Stratum5, Giovanni Tuomolo1, Stefan Versick9, Jordi Vilà Guerau de Arellano5\n\n1ECMWF, Reading, United Kingdom. 2ECMWF, Bonn, Germany. 3LSCE-IPSL, Gif-sur-Yvette, France. 4University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany. 5Wageningen University, Wageningen, Netherlands. 6Helsinki University, Helsinki, Finland. 7University of Reims Champagne-Ardenne, Reims, France. 8Meteo France, Toulouse, France. 9Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Karlsruhe, Germany\n\nSession 9. Combining data and models to improve estimates of regional to global GHG budgets and trends\n\nTo support the development of the new European anthropogenic CO2 emissions Monitoring and Verification Support capacity (CO2MVS) within the Copernicus programme of the European Commission, the EU-funded Carbon Atmospheric Tracer Research to Improve Numerical schemes and Evaluation (CATRINE) project aims to evaluate and improve the numerical schemes for tracer transport in CO2MVS and more widely in the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS). This will be done by using very high-resolution models at sub-kilometre resolutions to assess and improve the transport processes at city scales relevant to the ICOS Cities project and global models (at resolutions of 100 km or smaller) that provide information of the large-scale transport relevant for the global carbon budget and boundary conditions to the local very high-resolution limited-area models. The project will define protocols and metrics for evaluating tracer transport models at both global and local scales and provide links between the two scales by sharing boundary conditions and city-scale observations to evaluate the capability of both local and global systems to simulate atmospheric CO2 signals from anthropogenic emissions. Test beds based on field campaign case studies will be developed, along with suitable metrics for tracer transport evaluation with a range of tracers and observations from field campaigns and operational networks like ICOS. These metrics will be employed in the operational CO2MVS to evaluate the implementation of new transport model developments, characterise transport accuracy and representativity in data assimilation, and provide a quality control stamp of tracer transport accuracy.\n\n48 Higher global gross primary productivity under future climate with more advanced representations of photosynthesis\n\nOral\n\nMatthias Cuntz1*, Jürgen Knauer2,3, Benjamin Smith2, Josep P Canadell3, Belinda E Medlyn2, Allison C Bennett4, Silvia Caldararu5,6, Vanessa Haverd3\n\n1Université de Lorraine, AgroParisTech, INRAE, UMR Silva, Nancy, France. 2Hawkesbury Institute for the Environment, Western Sydney University, Penrith, NSW, Australia. 3CSIRO Environment, Canberra, ACT, Australia. 4School of Ecosystem and Forest Science, University of Melbourne, Richmond, VIC, Australia. 5Botany, School of Natural Sciences, Trinity College Dublin, Dublin, Ireland. 6iCRAG SFI Research Centre in Applied Geosciences, Dublin, Ireland\n\nSession 9. Combining data and models to improve estimates of regional to global GHG budgets and trends\n\nGross primary productivity (GPP) is the key determinant of land carbon uptake, but its representation in terrestrial biosphere models (TBMs) does not reflect our latest physiological understanding. We implemented three empirically well supported but often omitted mechanisms into the TBM CABLE-POP: photosynthetic temperature acclimation, explicit mesophyll conductance, and photosynthetic optimization through redistribution of leaf nitrogen. We used the RCP8.5 climate scenario to conduct factorial model simulations characterizing the individual and combined effects of the three mechanisms on projections of GPP. Simulated global GPP increased more strongly (up to 20% by 2070-2099) in more comprehensive representations of photosynthesis compared to the model lacking the three mechanisms. The experiments revealed non-additive interactions among the mechanisms as combined effects were stronger than the sum of the individual effects. The modeled responses are explained by changes in the photosynthetic sensitivity to temperature and CO2 caused by the added mechanisms. Our results suggest that current TBMs underestimate GPP responses to future CO2 and climate conditions.\n\n49 The AmeriFlux Management Project: Overview and the Year of Remote Sensing\n\nPoster\n\nSebastien Biraud1*, You-Wei Cheah1, Trevor keenan1,2, Margaret Torn1,2\n\n1Lawrence Berkeley Lab, Berkeley, USA. 2University California, Berkeley, Berkeley, USA\n\nSession 17. Best Practices in the landscape of Research Infrastructures: Cooperation, Co-location and other lessons learned\n\nAmeriFlux is a network of sites and scientists measuring ecosystem carbon, water, and energy fluxes across the Americas using eddy covariance techniques—and the many scientists who use these data. The US Department of Energy funded AmeriFlux Management Project (AMP, ameriflux.lbl.gov) aims to enhance the value of AmeriFlux for Earth system modeling, terrestrial ecosystem ecology, remote sensing, and many other fields. AMP has teams focused on four tasks: Technical support and QA/QC, Data support and QA/QC, Core site support, and Outreach. The network continues to grow. In April 2024, AmeriFlux registered its 660th site. We make 3,426 site-years of flux/met data, from 491 sites, publicly accessible. These data are used by a large community of scientists and practitioners around the world. To maintain a high level of service, AMP invests in new data capabilities and is pioneering a new mode of evaluating each site’s data quality (e.g., remote data “visits” and mini workshops). We also benefit from productive partnerships. For example, the National Science Foundation (NSF) funded NEON’s 47 AmeriFlux sites make it the single largest network-within-the-network. We co-develop data standards and products with the ICOS ETC. We work closely with the NSF-funded FLUXNET-Coop, which co-sponsors workshops, builds early career resources, and strengthens international connections among flux networks. This poster will highlight some of these recent activities; ongoing initiatives for remote sensing and for urban fluxes; and special offerings for scientists, such as the Rapid Response Systems (loaner eddy flux systems for urban environments and other research opportunities).\n\n51 Advancing Greenhouse Gas Isotopic Measurements: Evaluating the Compatibility and Efficiency of Picarro Gas Autosampler with Picarro Isotopic Analyzers\n\nOral\n\nKeren Drori*, Joyeeta Bhattacharya, Magdalena Hofmann, Jan Woźniak, Jinshu Yan, Tina Hemenway.\n\nAll authors: Picarro, Santa Clara, USA.\n\nSession 18. Manufacturers' Session\n\nThe greenhouse gas research community faces a growing demand for automated solutions tailored to isotopic measurements of greenhouse gases (e.g., isotopic CO2/CH4). Traditional solutions often entail significant initial and maintenance costs, intricate deployment and maintenance processes, and limited fieldwork adaptability. Anticipating this challenge, the Picarro Gas Autosampler is poised to attract growing interest for its anticipated compatibility with Picarro isotopic Carbon analyzers featuring low flow rates (<50 scc/m), promising efficient isotopic measurements. This report delves into the compatibility, efficiency, and advantages of the Picarro Gas Autosampler when paired with the Picarro G2201-i analyzer. Our experiments showcase remarkable precision and accuracy in isotopic measurements of greenhouse gases. Additionally, we explore factors such as linearity in dilution factors and characterize memory effects and variability across different gas species (e.g., comparing CO2 vs CH4). Moreover, the report offers practical recommendations on methods and best practices for conducting isotopic measurements of greenhouse gases. In summary, the Picarro Gas Autosampler, when combined with the Picarro G2201-i analyzer, emerges as a compelling, cost-effective, and user-friendly solution for isotopic measurements of greenhouse gases, offering a distinct advantage over traditional alternatives.\n\n52 Unlocking Insights: Evaluating Simulated CO2 Over Europe Through Aircraft Observations and Error Apportionment\n\nOral\n\nÐanilo Custódio1*, Mats Militzer1, Saqr Munassar1, David Ho1, Frank-Thomas Koch2, Christian Rödenbeck1, Christoph Gerbig1\n\n1Max-Planck-Institut für Biogeochemie, Jena, Germany. 2Deutscher Wetterdienst, Hohenpeissenberg, Germany\n\nSession 9. Combining data and models to improve estimates of regional to global GHG budgets and trends\n\nInverse modeling is pivotal in inferring surface-atmosphere exchange of CO2 based on atmospheric observations of CO2 concentration. However, uncertainties in inversion estimation, including emission accuracy, spatial-temporal resolution, and reliability of the transport scheme are challenges which should be addressed. Quality assessment and uncertainty decomposition are crucial tasks in greenhouse gases modeling, requiring verification and comparison studies with independent observations, which ultimately anchor the reality.\n\nThe main objective of this study is to benchmark and characterize uncertainties within the retrieval chain of CO2 estimated by the CarboScopo Regional inversion (CSR) and CAMS, employing aircraft observations from both commercial flights and dedicated research aircraft. Moreover, the research focuses on decomposing the mismatch between observed and modeled CO2 concentrations into distinct error vectors, aiming to apportion the strength of uncertainties associated with each vector. The outcomes of this study strongly indicate that there is a compelling need for enhancements in the parameterization of dynamics to elevate the performance of the CSR model. The observed results underscore the influence of these specific model components on the accuracy and reliability of CO2 estimates within the regional domain. Our study shed light on the uncertainty of CO2 estimated over Europe and reveals significant findings. We observed systematic underestimations in CO2 concentrations within the planetary boundary layer height, indicating deficiencies in the model's representation, particularly in fossil fuel emissions and boundary layer dynamics. Specifically, our analysis highlights that dynamics account for over 60% of the CO2 mismatch in the CSR model, with emissions contributing 28% to this discrepancy.\n\n53 Biodiesel, Chlorella and Decarbonization industry\n\nPoster\n\nDr. Kakha NADIRADZE*, Nana PHIROSMANASHVILI, Tekla NADIRADZE\n\nAssociation for Farmers Rights Defense, AFRD, Tbilisi, Georgia\n\nSession 18. Manufacturers' Session\n\nDue to the declining fossil fuel resources as well as the need for an alternative source of biodegradable source of energy, biodiesel has a great advantage over conventional fuel due to its low content of particulates. This study investigated the production and characterization of biofuels produced from the fresh water microalgae; Chlorella vulgaris. The goal of our project is to create a technology at the national level within the framework of the My Climate project, which involves increasing the volume of biomass produced by microalgae, which will contribute to the adoption of biofuel (biodiesel) as an alternative energy source and its commercial development. Within the framework of our project, microalgae (chlorella) is considered as a raw material for biofuel. For the maximum efficiency of such fuels, a high growth rate of plant biomass is required. Chlorella is an ideal raw material in this regard, that is, an active producer of biomass - with a high percentage of proteins, fats, carbohydrates, vitamins... In total, more than 650 substances are concentrated in it, the content of which is much higher than the content of meat, milk, vegetables and fruits. Materials and Methods: Water was sampled from Sharada industrial run-off within Kano metropolis for isolation and identification of algal species. Microalgae have the potential to become the primary source of biodiesel, catering to a wide range of essential applications such as transportation. This would allow for a significant reduction in dependence on conventional petroleum diesel.\n\n54 Optimizing spatial resolution in landcover classification for accurate methane emissions estimates in Arctic and Boreal regions.\n\nPoster\n\nJoshua Hashemi1*, Aleksi Räsänen2,3, Tarmo Virtanen4, Sari Juutinen5, Annett Bartsch6, Laura Chasmer7, Guido Grosse1, McKenzie Kuhn8, Mark Lara9, Miska Luoto4, Pekka Niittynen4, David Olefeldt10, Anna Virkkala11, Carolina Voigt12,13, Claire Treat1\n\n1Alfred-Wegener Institute, Potsdam, Germany. 2Natural Resources Institute Finland (LUKE), Oulu, Finland. 3University of Oulu, Oulu, Finland. 4University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland. 5Finnish Meteorological Institute, Helsinki, Finland. 6b.geos GmbH, Korneuburg, Austria. 7University of Lethbridge, Lethbridge, Canada. 8University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada. 9University of Illinois, Urbana, USA. 10University of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada. 11Woodwell Climate Research Centre, Falmouth, USA. 12Universität Hamburg, Hamburg, Germany. 13University of Eastern Finland, Kuopio, Finland\n\nSession 6. Greenhouse gas fluxes at high latitudes and climate/human induced feedbacks\n\nQuantifying methane emissions from Arctic and Boreal wetlands is critical for constraining uncertainty in the global methane budget. However, current estimates exhibit considerable variability, in part, due to challenges in accurately mapping wetland distribution and type. Here, we investigate the influence of the spatial resolution of landcover classification maps on regional methane flux estimates at several locations across the Arctic and Boreal. Utilizing high-resolution landcover classification maps (<2.5 m) and chamber-based methane flux measurements, we estimate regional methane emissions at various spatial resolutions to show how emission estimates vary as a function of landcover classification pixel size. Our results show regional estimates are most accurate at spatial resolutions of ≤25 m, with coarser resolutions yielding significantly less reliable estimates. Fragmented wetlands, in particular, may be misrepresented, leading to the underestimation or misallocation of methane relevant landcover classes. Additionally, we highlight the significance of wetland type, showing that fens are more sensitive to misrepresentation due to coarse resolution than bogs or wetlands in general. Current wetland mapping products often overlook smaller wetlands, leading to inaccuracies. Findings emphasize the need to use landcover classification maps with the appropriate thematic and spatial resolution to accurately represent those landcover types that are important for methane dynamics. These insights have implications for reconciling top-down and bottom-up approaches and deepening our understanding of methane dynamics in the context of a changing climate.\n\n55 Greenhouse Gas Data assimilation using ICOS observation data for the ITMS project\n\nPoster\n\nNiels Heinrich Keil*, Valentin Bruch, Roland Potthast, Andrea Kaiser-Weiss\n\nDeutscher Wetterdienst, Offenbach, Germany\n\nSession 9. Combining data and models to improve estimates of regional to global GHG budgets and trends\n\nFor the purpose of observation based CH4 emission verification, we develop a data assimilation system for the project Integrated greenhouse gas monitoring system for Germany (ITMS).\n\nEmploying the numerical weather model ICON and its aerosol and trace gas (ART) extension, three-dimensional CH4 model fields are constructed from given prior CH4 emissions over Europe and CH4 initial and boundary concentration provided by Copernicus.\n\nTo pull the modelled fields closer to reality, 3D-Var and ensemble based EnVar data assimilation methods are used to combine modelled CH4 fields with ICOS station observations resulting in a CH4 analysis.\n\nThe added value of the CH4 analysis can be shown by comparing statistical errors of the modelled fields and of the analysis on observation stations independent of the data assimilation or in different measurement heights.\n\nThe implementation is efficient and is based upon systems of the DWD operational data assimilation.\n\n56 Long-term CO2 flux measurements from an intensively managed temperate grassland\n\nPoster\n\nYi Wang*, Iris Feigenwinter, Lukas Hörtnagl, Nina Buchmann\n\nDepartment of Environmental Systems Science, ETH Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland\n\nSession 4. Processes involved in the greenhouse gas cycle in terrestrial ecosystems\n\nGrassland ecosystems cover about 40% of the global land area (excluding Greenland and Antarctica) and serve a unique role in the global carbon (C) cycle. The net CO2 uptake in managed grasslands is substantially influenced by climate conditions, accompanied by interactions with land management practices. With the eddy covariance (EC) technique, the net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of CO2 can be directly measured. NEE represents the balance between two different ecosystem processes: gross primary production (GPP; amount of CO2 assimilation through photosynthesis), and ecosystem respiration (Reco; amount of CO2 released via plant and soil respiration).\n\nThis study aims to assess the dynamics of CO2 fluxes at Chamau (CH-CHA as part of Swiss FluxNet), an intensively managed temperate grassland in Switzerland. Using machine learning approaches for 19 years (2005-2023) of EC flux, meteorological, and management data, our objectives are (1) to identify key drivers of GPP and Reco at different time scales (i.e., daily, seasonal, annual), (2) to investigate changes in grassland regrowth after management events (i.e., mowing, grazing, fertilization, sward renewal), and (3) to examine the ecophysiological responses (e.g., water use efficiency) to both climate change and management practices. Our results can provide further insights to help optimize grassland management practices to increase sward productivity and develop mitigation strategies for current and future climate risks.\n\n57 Flux ratios of CO2, CO, and NOx: an inter-city comparison between Paris and Zurich using urban tall-tower eddy covariance\n\nOral\n\nRainer Hilland1*, Stavros Stagakis2, Pascal Rubli3, Lukas Emmenegger3, Laura Bignotti4, Benjamin Loubet4, Samuel Hammer5, Andreas Christen1\n\n1University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany. 2University of Basel, Basel, Switzerland. 3EMPA, Dübendorf, Switzerland. 4INRAe, Palaiseau, France. 5University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany\n\nSession 11. Quantification of urban greenhouse gas emissions - from novel monitoring to source identification\n\nIn-situ measurements of urban greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions play a critical role in quantifying cities’ contributions to regional and global emissions and are a key tool in the validation of city emission inventories and models. Cities are also complex environments containing a multitude of anthropogenic emission sources such as traffic, residential heating, and industrial production. Correct sectoral attribution of urban GHG emissions is necessary to monitor emission reduction efforts, compare against emission inventories, and separate anthropogenic from biogenic emissions.\n\nAs part of the ICOS-Cities (PAUL - Pilot Application in Urban Landscapes) project, tall-tower urban eddy covariance (EC) systems were installed in both Paris, France and Zurich, Switzerland. Use of a high-frequency multi-species gas analyser (MGA7, MIRO Analytical, Switzerland) enabled simultaneous measurements of CO2, CO, CH4, NOx, N2O, and H2O fluxes. EC measurements provide gas fluxes which integrate all emission sources and sinks within the measurement footprint. By examining the ratio of these gas fluxes in combination with a spatially-resolved emission inventory within the EC footprint, one may validate or improve the emission inventory.\n\nWe present eight months of EC flux ratios from Zurich (August 2022 until March 2023) and six months of EC flux ratios from Paris (January 2024 to June 2024). We investigate what we can learn from the differences in flux ratios between the two cities, as well as discuss the challenges and potential of using multi-species EC measurements to separate urban GHG emission sources.\n\n58 Refining the Global Picture: the Impact of Increased Resolution on CO₂ Atmospheric Inversions using OCO-2 XCO₂ retrievals\n\nPoster\n\nZoé Lloret*, Frédéric Chevallier, Anne Cozic\n\nLSCE/CEA, Gif-sur-Yvette, France\n\nSession 9. Combining data and models to improve estimates of regional to global GHG budgets and trends\n\nThe threat posed by the increasing concentration of carbon dioxide (CO₂) in the atmosphere motivates a detailed and precise estimation of CO₂ emissions and absorptions over the globe. This study refines the spatial resolution of the CAMS/LSCE inversion system, achieving a global resolution of 0.7° latitude and 1.4° longitude, or three times as many grid boxes as the current operational setup. In a two-year inversion assimilating the midday clear-sky retrievals of the column-average dry-air mole fraction of carbon dioxide (XCO₂) from NASA’s second Orbiting Carbon Observatory (OCO-2), the elevated resolution demonstrates an improvement in the representation of atmospheric CO₂, particularly at the synoptic time scale, as validated against independent surface measurements. Vertical profiles of the CO₂ concentration differ slightly above 22 km between resolutions compared to AirCore profiles, and highlight differences in the vertical distribution of CO₂ between resolutions. However, this disparity is not evident for XCO₂, as evaluated against independent reference ground-based observations. Global and regional estimates of natural fluxes for 2015-2016 are similar between the two resolutions, but with North America exhibiting a higher natural sink at high-resolution for 2016. Overall, both inversions seem to yield reasonable estimates of global and regional natural carbon fluxes. The increase in calculation time is less than the increase in the number of operations and in the volume of input data, revealing greater efficiency of the code executed on a Graphics Processing Unit. This allows us to make this higher resolution the new standard for the CAMS/LSCE system.\n\n59 Towards regional CH4 inversions with ICON-ART assimilating satellite TROPOMI data over Europe\n\nPoster\n\nDavid Ho1*, Michael Steiner2, Erik Koene2, Michał Gałkowski1,3, Friedemann Reum4, Julia Marshall4, Christoph Gerbig1\n\n1Max-Planck-Institut für Biogeochemie, Jena, Germany. 2Empa, Swiss Federal Laboratories for Materials Science and Technology, Dübendorf, Switzerland. 3AGH University of Science and Technology, Kraków, Poland. 4Deutsches Zentrum für Luft- und Raumfahrt, Institut für Physik der Atmosphäre, Oberpfaffenhofen, Germany\n\nSession 9. Combining data and models to improve estimates of regional to global GHG budgets and trends\n\nInverse modeling is a top-down technique which utilizes atmospheric observations to infer greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. With this application in mind, satellite retrievals of GHGs are an attractive data source due to their dense spatial coverage compared to typically sparse surface networks. This study aims to assimilate satellite data at high resolution to independently locate and quantify GHG sources and sinks, aiding carbon budget studies and policymakers. The work also serves to develop the groundwork for the development of Germany's Integrated GHG Monitoring System (ITMS).\n\nWe couple the numerical weather prediction and atmospheric transport model ICON-ART with an Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) based inversion system, using the CarbonTracker Data Assimilation Shell (CTDAS). Targeting total CH4 fluxes over Europe, we use ccolumn-integrated methane measurements (XCH4) from the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI). Prior anthropogenic emissions are taken from the CAMS-GLOB-ANT_v4.2 inventory, while natural sources are included as well from CAMS-GLOB-BIO_v3.1.\n\nA synthetic study conducted for June 2018, demonstrates the system's ability to capture prescribed spatial patterns in emission fields, using pseudo-observations from satellite retrievals with realistic coverage. CH4 fluxes were retrieved at 0.25° x 0.25° resolution, and prior emissions were scaled to optimally fit the measured values. Real observations are then assimilated, providing emission estimates and their associated uncertainties.\n\nThis study showcases the potential of satellite retrievals in inverse modeling, enabling us to extend its application to other GHG species, and serving as preparation for the Copernicus Anthropogenic Carbon Dioxide Monitoring (CO2M) mission.\n\n60 Addressing PhenoCam supply chain limitations with low cost (DIY) drop-in replacements\n\nPoster\n\nKoen Hufkens*\n\nBlueGreen Labs (BV), Melsele, Belgium\n\nSession 3. Cross-domain technological development: autonomous vehicles, sensor miniaturisation, low-cost sensors and labour-intense approaches\n\nPhenoCams provide a critical vegetation monitoring services, providing information on the state of the vegetation throughout the seasons with conventional (RGB and infrared) images. However, the deployment of PhenoCams has recently been limited due to post-COVID supply chain issues and a shortage of the recommended StarDot SC5 model (used in the EU/US PhenoCam networks). These supply chain issues have highlighted a weakness in our hyper-connected economies and the over-reliance on hardware availability and just-in-time value chains, which might not be sustainable from a practical and environmental perspective.\n\nHere, I present two solutions to PhenoCam related hardware supply chain issue. First, I introduce the successor of the StarDot SC5 camera, the StarDot Live2 camera and the automated setup through the Phenocam Installation Tool (PIT v2). This setup will supersede the old StarDot SC5, which is no longer available from the vendor.\n\nhttps://github.com/bluegreen-labs/phenocam_installation_tool_v2\n\nSecond, I provide an open hardware drop-in replacement for default PhenoCam solutions based around system on a chip (SoC) hardware. Our setup serves as low cost and highly redundant solutions in case of budgetary or hardware availability constraints, which can be repurposed for scientific outreach and educational projects. These open hardware solutions are built around 3D printed housings (support structures) and off-the-shelve components, allowing for the use of various vendors, or hardware configurations.\n\nhttps://bluegreenlabs.org/post/bluegreen-labs-phenocam/\n\n61 Potential for coupling TIR/SWIR satellite sounders for wildfire research: CO from 2020-2023 megafires.\n\nPoster\n\nLeonid Yurganov*\n\nUMBC, Baltimore, USA\n\nSession 10. Remote sensing of greenhouse gases from ground and space: Their application for carbon cycle studies, satellite and model validation and building MVS capacity\n\nTIR sounders (MOPITT, AIRS, IASI, etc.) detect outgoing thermal radiation from the Earth, while SWIR instruments (GOSAT, TROPOMI, etc.) use solar radiation reflected and/or scattered from the surface or clouds. Both types provide the total column number of molecules (in molec/cm2) or VMR averaged over the entire depth of the atmosphere (in our case Xco). A fundamental limitation of TIR data is the low sensitivity to PBL. SWIR probes have the same height sensitivity in clear sky conditions. Combining these data on a daily basis opens up opportunities for studying gas concentrations in the lower troposphere.
