The three databases below provide details of 36,000 trans-Atlantic slave voyages, 10,000 intra-American ventures, names and personal information. You can read the introductory maps for a high-level guided explanation, view the timeline and chronology of the traffic, or watch the slave ship and slave trade animations to see the dispersal in action.",

        "text": "Explore the Origins and Forced Relocations of Enslaved Africans Across the Atlantic World\n\nThe SlaveVoyages website is a collaborative digital initiative that compiles and makes publicly accessible records of the largest slave trades in history. Search these records to learn about the broad origins and forced relocations of more than 12 million African people who were sent across the Atlantic in slave ships, and hundreds of thousands more who were trafficked within the Americas. Explore where they were taken, the numerous rebellions that occurred, the horrific loss of life during the voyages, the identities and nationalities of the perpetrators, and much more.\n\nHenry Louis Gates introduces Slave Voyages 2.0 and some of its people\n\nThis database contains information on more than 11,000 maritime voyages trafficking enslaved people within the Americas. These slave trades operated within colonial empires, across imperial boundaries, and inside the borders of nations such as the United States and Brazil. Explore the forced removals, which not only dispersed African survivors of the Atlantic crossing but also displaced enslaved people born in the Americas.\n\nPeople of the Atlantic Slave Trade allows users to search three distinct databases. Two document enslaved people; one concerns enslavers. The African Origins dataset includes personal details of 95,153 Africans taken from slave ships mostly captured by anti-slave trade patrols or from African trading sites between 1808-1862. Users can view the personal details of Africans liberated from slave vessels, hear their names pronounced, and contribute to the project by suggesting the likely language origins of the names in the records. The Oceans of Kinfolk dataset includes the personal details of 63,562 people transported to New Orleans, and in many cases records on the people who transported, bought, and sold them there. Users can analyze the name, age, gender, origin, places of embarkation and disembarkation of these individuals, and some of their linkages to enslavers. The Enslavers database lists nearly 60,000 individuals or commercial companies involved in the enslavement of Africans or people of African descent, lists the number of captives they enslaved, and provides links to the slave voyages in which they participated."
