        "text": "Class of 2025\n\nJosé-Luis Amsler was raised in Berlin, Germany in a German-Peruvian-Iranian family. He recently graduated from Freie Universität Berlin with a B.A. in Media Studies and Political Science as the best student of the year. During his undergraduate studies he spent two semesters at Indiana University Bloomington where he learned a lot about international relations, American constitutional law, and corn fields. He also produced and directed an award-winning short documentary while there. Besides studying, he has been working as a rookie journalist for various media outlets including Berliner Zeitung and Rolling Stone Germany. Both academically and professionally, José-Luis is especially passionate about socioeconomic inequality and welfare policy. During TAM, he would like to focus on the rise of antidemocratic tendencies in the EU as well as on the impact of continued European integration on political attitudes and local politics. He will spend his second year at Humboldt University in Berlin on the Transatlantic Studies track.\n\nPaola Andreu Sanz was born in Puerto Rico and raised in Charlotte, NC. She graduated from UNC-CH this past spring. She received a Bachelor’s degree in Political Science with a second major in Women’s and Gender Studies and a minor in Latina/o Studies with distinction. She has joined TAM’s European Governance track and will spend her second year at the Universitat Pompeu Fabra in Barcelona. She is interested in researching how gender plays a role in defining how rights are afforded to citizens of a nation. During her free time, Paola enjoys reading or going to sports events with her friends.\n\nTill Bodenhagen studied communications in Salzburg, Austria from 2019 to 2023. He did an Erasmus semester abroad in 2021 for which he picked Gothenburg University. He took his first Political Science courses there and finally decided on pursuing an adjacent graduate program after not pursuing a Poli undergraduate program in 2019. It was also via the University of Gothenburg that he found out about TAM and the universities’ cooperation. As he has grown to love Gothenburg, he happily took the chance to return there as his overseas site on TAM’s European Governance track.\n\nHis political interests were invoked by the EU refugee crisis in 2015 and the US election campaign leading up to Nov 2016. Since then, he follows everyday politics focusing on US and German domestic politics. Concrete research interests of his, outside that grid, are climate politics, the Middle East, and the war against Ukraine. Till focused on Journalism in his undergraduate years, and this field is more often than not the lens he uses to understand politics. He is especially interested in the media’s role to responsibly educate its audience on an ever-more-complex-growing world and how media contributes to the democratic process. His interests outside university were lifeguarding/swimming until recently and making up for the lost covid time in every aspect that comes with that. He also considers politics as a hobby as he spends way too much free time on it to not call it such.\n\nAs a first-generation American from a Brazilian family in Raleigh, North Carolina, Marco Braga enjoys learning all about different cultures. He graduated Cum Laude in May 2023 from Western Carolina University’s Honors College with a BS in History and a minor in Leadership. His academic journey sparked a passion for politics and global affairs, and an ambition to discover and implement solutions for the issues of our generation. A highlight of his time at WCU was the opportunity to intern with NATO, an experience that greatly shaped his perspective of global affairs and future aspirations. After his first semester at UNC-CH, he will be continuing his TAM program at Bath University, England on the Transatlantic Studies track. He looks forward to hearing new ideas, meeting new people and foremost, to robust debates.\n\nKevin Bunga was born in DR Congo and has grown up in Raleigh. His earliest experience with politics was whilst growing up and discussing the little of politics that he knew with his family, be it in relation to US political events, geopolitics, or events that had or were transpiring in Congo.\n\nHe graduated from the University of North Carolina at Greensboro as a double major in Political Science and International Global Studies as well as a minor in French. During his undergrad he studied abroad at Vesalius College and interned at Laffineur Law firm, in Brussels, Belgium. He wrote a thesis, “Hungary, The Illiberal State within the European Union” about Hungary’s backsliding within the EU. His research interests include European politics and society, particularly democratization and regime change in the European context. His focus is primarily on how populist/authoritarian changes are managed within the context of the EU. He is looking forward to participating in the Transatlantic track at Sciences-Po in Grenoble in the spring semester and at Bath University in his second year. Outside of school his interests include reading, shows & movies, soccer, traveling, and hanging out with friends and family.\n\nPhil Donofrio was raised in Rochester, NY before moving to Washington, DC to study at George Washington University’s Elliott School of International Affairs. While an undergraduate, Phil spent a semester studying at Maastricht University in the Netherlands, where his interest in European politics and society was cemented. After graduating, Phil remained in Washington for work, most recently as a public policy analyst with FiscalNote.\n\nPhil will spend his second year of the TAM program at Pompeu Fabra University in Barcelona on TAM’s European Governance track. His research interests include: open and digital government; the Nordic model and welfare states; comparative European electoral systems; and the interplay between separatist movements and Euroscepticism.\n\nIn his spare time, Phil is an avid reader and traveler — his favorite authors are Kerouac and Camus, and his favorite trips were to São Paulo and Busan. He also enjoys running, cycling, and yoga, as well as both playing soccer and (foolishly) rooting for his beloved Arsenal Football Club.\n\nMackenzie Hansen graduated in May 2023 with a BA in Contemporary European Studies and an honors laureate from UNC-CH. During undergrad she participated in Model EU simulations as a member of the UNC team and worked for the UNC Center for European Studies and the Krasno Global Event Series to facilitate events on global affairs and the transatlantic relationship. She completed a virtual study abroad course through Humboldt University in Berlin, Germany, where she studied policymaking in the European Union. Mackenzie works as an international policy analyst with the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission. She has a FLAS award to study Portuguese during the 2023-24 academic year. After the year at UNC, Mackenzie will study in Berlin on the Transatlantic Studies Track.\n\nThomas Harley is from Miami, Florida, and graduated from UNC-CH in 2023 with degrees in Political Science and Economics. He also attended Duke University for part of his college tenure through the Robertson Scholars Leadership Program. Thomas is on the European Governance track with a focus in Comparative Climate Change Policy. He has research interests in rising ethnonationalism across the European continent and the role that this development can play in climate and immigration policies.

With a diverse range of interests and a vibrant personality, Morgan utilizes her personal experiences in conjunction with her academic studies to work towards a better future for all.\n\nBefore joining the TAM Program, Morgan studied at the University of Pennsylvania for two years before making the decision to transfer to the University of Virginia, where she ultimately earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in Political Science with a concentration in Government. Throughout her undergraduate years, Morgan displayed exceptional dedication and intellectual curiosity, immersing herself in courses that explored the complexities of political systems, African American Studies, and governance.\n\nDriven by a desire to further her academic pursuits and broaden her horizons, Morgan has chosen Humboldt University in Berlin as the destination for her second year of graduate studies on the TAM European Governance track. While in Berlin, Morgan is deeply interested in the intersection of political science and social justice. She is particularly drawn to issues such as prison reform, the school-to-prison pipeline, civil rights, constitutional law, African American studies, and exploring the Black experience across the diaspora. Morgan recognizes the critical importance of addressing these systemic challenges and seeks to understand how they transpire across the Western world with a comparative study of Germany’s history regarding race and human rights. She is fully committed to contributing to the ongoing efforts aimed at creating a more equitable and just global society.\n\nBeyond her academic pursuits, Morgan has an adventurous spirit and loves to explore new destinations, immersing herself in different cultures and broadening her perspectives. She is a foodie and enjoys sharing these experiences with friends and family. Morgan is also actively involved with her sorority, where she engages in community service initiatives that align with her values of social justice and empowerment.\n\nLuis Leandro Ortega goes by Leandro or Leo. He is a 23-year-old student hailing from Nicaragua, but he has been living in Sweden for most of his life. Recently, he completed his Bachelor’s degree in Global Studies with a specialization in Development Studies at the University of Gothenburg. He will be returning there to finish up the TAM-program on the European Governance track. Being a full-time student has kept him quite busy, leaving little time for much else apart from part-time jobs. In addition to his studies, he serves as a board member at the Latin-American Amnesty group in Sweden.\n\nWhen he does find some free time, he cherishes it by spending it with loved ones and friends. He also has a deep appreciation for nature, so going on hikes is a real delight. As for research interests, they span a wide range, but he particularly focuses on LGBTQ+ rights. His Bachelor’s thesis explored the impact of labor rights on the lives of transgender individuals. Additionally, he has a keen interest in understanding how organizations and institutions contribute to overall development and human rights.\n\nDale Seufert-Navarro graduated from the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill in 2023, receiving degrees in both Political Science and Sociology.

His concentration was in German studies, and he also minored in Philosophy. During his time as an undergraduate student, Evan was introduced to the institutions and governing bodies of the European Union, as well as the political systems of its constituent member states. This newfound perspective of Europe as a complex, geopolitical entity ultimately pushed his research interests into the realm of political science, whilst still remaining interested in the sociocultural aspects of European experience. Reflecting these research interests, Evan participated as a panelist at the 2022 Southeast German Studies Workshop, where he presented a paper on the link between post-socialist nostalgia and democratic and antidemocratic sentiments in former East Germany. Before earning his Bachelor of Arts at ASU, Evan also had the rewarding experience of working as a teaching assistant in beginner German classes. After undergrad, Evan has continued to seek opportunities to improve his language skills, which led to his decision to spend a summer studying German at Middlebury College in Vermont, where he participated in the school’s world-renowned language immersion program in 2022.
