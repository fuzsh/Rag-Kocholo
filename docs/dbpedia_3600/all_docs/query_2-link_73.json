        "text": "IMPORTANT: Understand The Difference Between Dosage vs. Concentration\n\nWhen dealing with compounded medications, it's important to grasp the difference between dosage and concentration and the quantity of liquid in a vial, as this affects how much you pay. Based on your dose, a $100 vial of medication could last you a month or two and that makes a huge difference in costs.\n\nDosage vs. Concentration: Dosage refers to the amount of medication you take, usually measured in milligrams (mg). Concentration tells you how much medication is in each milliliter (mL) of liquid. For example, if you have a 1ml vial and the label says 10 mg/mL, that means there are 10 mg of medication within that entire vial.\n\nCost Understanding: The price of a vial can seem confusing. A vial with more liquid or a higher concentration of medication might cost more, but it could also mean you're getting more doses out of it, which might actually save money in the long run.\n\nFor instance, if you need 10 mg of your medication monthly. Which vial below is the cheaper option?\n\nVial A: 1ml of 5 mg/mL, costs $100, there is a total of 10mg of the medication\n\nVial B: 0.5ml of 20 mg/ml, costs $100, there is a total of 10mg of the medication\n\nIn this example, we demonstrate that though Vial A seems like a better buy because it has more liquid, it turns out to be twice as expensive as Vial B. This is because it is not as concentrated. While evaluating the cost of compounded medications, it is important to remember to do some maths and figure out the monthly cost for your dosage."
