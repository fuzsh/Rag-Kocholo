        "text": "Congo Square\n\nCongo Square is an open space in the southwest corner of Louis Armstrong Park, located in New Orleans, Louisiana. During the 19th century, Louisiana’s French and Spanish colonial era, Congo Square was a place where hundreds and sometimes thousands of enslaved and free African descendants would congregate each Sunday to socialize and set up a marketplace to vend food, arts and crafts. By 1819 these weekly gatherings included thousands of participants and onlookers. Congo Square, also known by many other names including “Place des Nègres” or “Place Congo” was also the place enslaved and free people played music, sang and danced as a way of remembering their African heritage and strengthening their community.\n\nThese early 19th century gatherings in Congo Square influenced later indigenous New Orleans performance styles, such as Mardi Gras Indian traditions, the second line, New Orleans jazz and rhythm & blues. All of the musical forms observed in Congo Square permeate the very fabric of people’s lives in New Orleans. Even to this day, Congo Square is still a gathering spot for New Orleanians—Sunday drum circles, family gatherings, weddings, political demonstrations, music festivals, prayer vigils, and gospel performances extend Congo Square’s legacy as a place of culture, recreation, spirituality, and politics.\n\nInvestigate one of these Lines of Inquiry\n\nPhotos\n\n1\n\nCongo Square Line of Inquiry\n\nWhy are Congo Square and the people that gathered there important to New Orleans history and culture?\n\nVideos\n\nAudio\n\nWhat Does Congo Square Mean to Me?\n\nhttps://musicrising.tulane.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/383/2018/06/Congo_Square_AR-1398258224-1.mp3\n\nAsia Rainey, Writer/Spoken Word Performance Artist: asiarainey.wordpress.com\n\nProfiles\n\nLinks & Documents\n\nPhoto: The Bamboula\n\nArticle: Going Back to Congo Square (www.nola.com)\n\nTeaching Strategies\n\n1\n\nTeaching Strategy\n\nCongo Square History: A Gathering Place\n\nKindergarten-3rd Grade\n\nThe Significance of Gathering\n\nExplore\n\nWhich of these audio and visual resources will activate imagination and draw students into this investigation?\n\nPhotos\n\nAudio\n\nWhat Does Congo Square Mean to Me?\n\nhttps://musicrising.tulane.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/383/2018/06/Congo_Square_AR-1398258224-1.mp3\n\nAsia Rainey, Writer/Spoken Word Performance Artist: asiarainey.wordpress.com\n\nVideos\n\nProfiles\n\nEngage\n\nWhat activities will lead students into finding answers through this line of inquiry?\n\nActivity One\n\nActivity Two\n\nBefore beginning work with students, be sure to review the Description included in the links section of this Teaching Strategy\n\nUsing a world or U.S. map in your classroom as a reference, ask students, “Where is Congo Square located within the United States?”\n\nShow students the video: “Spirits of Congo Square,” linked in the Video section of this Teaching Strategy.

Guide students in exploring the following questions:\n\nWhat is happening in this photo?\n\nWhat might be sold in these marketplaces?\n\nWhat do you think the people selling these goods do with the money they earn?\n\nTell students that together you are going to create a marketplace in the classroom. Mention that, in the marketplace, you can sell your goods (for money) or barter (trade what you have for what someone else has). Each student or small group will decide on one item to make and/or bring to class to sell or barter in the marketplace. Guide students in thinking about the following:\n\nWhat would you like to make and/or bring to the marketplace? Why?\n\nWhat goods make sense to trade? What goods make more sense to sell? Why?\n\nFor how much will you sell or barter your product?\n\nHow will you sell your wares (products or goods)? As you sell or barter, will you move around the marketplace or stay in one place?\n\nListen to the interview Radio Stories: The Flavor of New Orleans – Mr. Okra included in the Audio section of this Teaching Strategy. Tell students that Mr. Robinson (Mr. Okra) follows a long tradition of “street criers,” who use song-like phrases to advertise their wares to the public.\n\nAsk students, “What does Mr. Robinson (Mr. Okra) sell?” Create a class list of the produce he sells, which may include: oranges, bananas, cantaloupe, pineapples, strawberries, grapes, grapefruit, tangerines, and mangoes.\n\nAsk each student or small group to create a “street cry” to market the product each has chosen for the classroom marketplace.\n\nHold your classroom marketplace on two separate days. On the first day, half of the class will be vendors, while the other half of the class will be customers. Alternate the second day. You may also want to invite other classes, parents or teachers to serve as customers.\n\nConnect\n\nHow do these investigations support other academic goals and objectives?\n\nCurricular Connections\n\nLiteracy – Speaking and Listening:\n\nParticipate in collaborative conversations with diverse partners about grade 2 topics and texts with peers and adults in small and larger groups. CCSS.ELA-Literacy.SL.2.1\n\nTell a story or recount an experience with appropriate facts and relevant, descriptive details, speaking audibly in coherent sentences. CCSS.ELA-Literacy.SL.2.4\n\nReflect & Assess\n\nHow will you know what your students have learned?\n\nSample Reflection or Assessment\n\nAsk students to share their experiences in creating their classroom marketplace and to draw pictures in their journals about their experiences. Collect journals to review responses and reflections.\n\n2\n\nTeaching Strategy\n\nThe Marketplace 4th-7th Grades\n\n4th-7th Grades\n\nA Place of Economic Exchange"
