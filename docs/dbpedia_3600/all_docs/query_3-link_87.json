Infestations of this weed are reaching crisis proportions in important freshwater bodies of the region. This is causing environmental, economic, and social problems and accumulated damages that can easily be valued in the order of billions of dollars. It directly affects not only the riparian communities but also all those people who in one way or another depend on environmental services or production from the affected water bodies.\n\nResearchers have been focusing on water hyacinth from various angles of its control and use, and it is apparent that significant knowledge is already available but not used in managing the weed. Early in 1996, responding to requests from across the region for support for research on water hyacinth, the People, Land and Water (PLaW) program of the International Development Research Centre (IDRC) launched an initiative to assess the extent of the water-hyacinth problem across AME and the capacity there to manage it. In particular, the initiative was to explain the apparent lethargy of governments and communities in dealing with impending water-hyacinth infestations in their water bodies. This report summarizes the initiative, its findings, and the recommendations for decision-makers, researchers, and IDRC that emerged from a workshop, Improving Reaction to Water Hyacinth in Affected Countries Across Africa and the Middle East, held in Nairobi, Kenya, in 1997.\n\nMany people participated in making this initiative successful and in preparing this report. It is impossible to make an exhaustive list to acknowledge their contributions, although several are already mentioned throughout this document. We must thank in particular all the people who provided their time and knowledge during our consultations and during the workshop. We also acknowledge the contributions of hard work and expertise from the consultants: Dr George Phiri (team leader) from Malawi, Prof. Yahia H. Fayad and Prof. Ahmed F. Khattab from Egypt, Dr Magzoub Bashir from Sudan, Dr Carina Cilliers from South Africa, and Mr Ousseynou Diop and Mr Mor Dieng from Senegal. Other contributors to this initiative during its conceptual development, implementation, and follow-up included Dr J.B.R. Findlay, South Africa; Dr Hans Herren, International Centre for Insect Physiology and Ecology; Dr Garry Hill, Centre for Agriculture and Biosciences International; Dr G.W. Howard, International Union for the Conservation of Nature; Dr A.M. Mailu, Kenya Agricultural Research Institute; Dr Dennis McCarthy, United States Agency for International Development–Regional Economic Development Service Office; Dr Faustino Orach-Meza, Lake Victoria Environmental Management Project Secretariat, Uganda; Dr Timothy Twongo, Fisheries Research Institute, Uganda; Dr Paul Woomer, University of Nairobi, Kenya; and Dr Helmuth Zimmermann, Plant Protection Research Institute, South Africa. Finally, we acknowledge the valuable contribution to this initiative and constant encouragement provided colleagues in the IDRC–PLaW team, particularly Dr Eva Rathgeber, Regional Director for Eastern and Southern Africa, Dr Eglal Rached, Dr Ola Smith, and Mr Wardie Leppan.\n\nLuis Navarro\n\nGeorge Phiri\n\nChapter 1\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nWater hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes) is an alien, floating water weed that has spread throughout vital freshwater bodies and wetlands of Africa and the Middle East (AME) since the late 1800s. It poses serious socioeconomic and environmental problems for millions of people in riparian communities and is, therefore, an added constraint on development. For instance, more than 12000 ha of this weed infests Lake Victoria, affecting the livelihood of many of the more than 40 million people in Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda. The weed obstructs electricity generation, irrigation, navigation, and fishing; increases water loss resulting from evapotranspiration; and facilitates proliferation of such diseases as bilharzia.1\n\nExperts agree that sufficient knowledge of the biological, mechanical, and chemical means of controlling water hyacinth exists in AME. Centres within the region also have the expertise to handle the weed problem. However, these centres, together with affected communities, governments, and support organizations, have usually failed to mobilize efforts in time to prevent the weed from spreading to crisis levels. Serious difficulties arise in making the pragmatic decisions needed to mobilize and support people who are able to control the weed, even when financial resources are available. Fortunately, some control efforts — such as those in Benin, Sudan, Zimbabwe, and a few other AME countries — have been successful. They provided useful lessons. However, water-hyacinth infestation keeps getting worse in such major water bodies as Lake Victoria in East Africa, Lake Malawi and the Zambezi River basin in southern Africa, and the Tano lagoon and River Niger in West Africa.\n\nDuring 1996, the People, Land and Water (PLaW) program of the International Development Research Centre (IDRC) agreed to respond systematically to several requests from across the region to support research on water hyacinth. It launched an initiative to assess the extent of the water-hyacinth problem across AME and the region's capacity to manage it; in particular, the initiative was to\n\nexplain the apparent lethargy of governments and affected communities in responding to impending water-hyacinth infestations in their water bodies. More specially, the aims of the initiative were\n\nTo identify the main bottlenecks impeding effective control of water hyacinth in AME;\n\nTo increase awareness of the spread and negative socioeconomic impact of water-hyacinth infestations in the region; and\n\nTo stimulate the search for effective mechanisms for water-hyacinth management in AME.\n\nDuring part of 1996 and 1997, six expert consultants surveyed the literature on water hyacinth and interviewed the key institutions, experts, policymakers, and community dwellers around important water bodies in North Africa and the Middle East, eastern and southern Africa, South Africa, and West Africa. The survey and case-study reports of the consultants, plus notes by other experts, provided the basis for a follow-up consultative workshop of water-hyacinth stakeholders and experts, held in Nairobi, Kenya, in September 1997.\n\nThe IDRC-PLaW-led consultations confirmed that water hyacinth is present and spreading in practically all the countries across AME but that the region already has the experience and expertise to deal with the weed on time. The main constraints to the mobilization of available capability are problems of organization and bureaucracy across the various responsible units. Usually, these units act without coordination or communication, often with different or conflicting objectives and limited access to information and resources. Specifically, stakeholders identified the generally poor flow of information and lack of timely access to such information by key decision-makers as the most critical constraints in need of immediate attention. Most critical information relates to the spread and consequences of water hyacinth and to the available knowledge and expertise for early control of water-hyacinth infestations.\n\nFinally, during the September 1997 workshop, stakeholders asked IDRC to start and lead a campaign among governments and donors to develop, install, and support a permanent mechanism for communicating information on water hyacinth. The mechanism was to use modern means of communication and target key experts and decision-makers to facilitate and support timely decision-making and mobilization of efforts to control water-hyacinth infestations.\n\nIDRC complied with the request and, in consultation with governmental institutions and donors, developed the concepts and a \"blueprint\" for a Water Hyacinth Information Partnership (WHIP). At the time of this publication, the concept of WHIP as a proactive information-communication mechanism had been endorsed by the Lake Victoria Environmental Management Program (LVEMP) and national institutions such as the Kenya Agricultural Research Institute. It has also been incorporated into East Africa Cooperation's strategic regional plan to combat the weed. The financing and installation of WHIP are under discussion among several donors, including IDRC, East Africa Cooperation, and other stakeholders.\n\nThis document is a summary report of the findings and recommendations of the survey, case studies, and September 1997 workshop. After this introduction, the document includes sections on the origin and nature, spread and consequences, and the methods for handling the water-hyacinth problem across AME. The first part of the document closes by highlighting what the stakeholders identified as knowledge gaps and opportunities for research and development on water hyacinth, with attention to their specific requests to IDRC. The second part of this document includes, in extenso, the proceedings of the September 1997 consultative workshop. These proceedings contain more details on the activities of the team of consultants, their approach and reports, and the participants in the survey and workshop, in addition to the workshop deliberations and conclusions. Appendix 4 contains a list of institutions and people across the region with expertise in or responsibilities for water hyacinth.\n\nThis page intentionally left blank\n\nPART I\n\nProblems and Solutions\n\nThis page intentionally left blank\n\nChapter 2\n\nORIGIN AND NATURE OF WATER HYACINTH\n\nWater hyacinth (E. crassipes) is a flowering, floating, freshwater plant, native to South America. It has beautiful, large, pale-blue flowers, with purple and yellow spots on the petals and shiny, round green leaves. The flower can be bought in local markets, such as in Dakar, Senegal, where it is a source of income for women. Unfortunately, it grows and spreads so quickly in warmer climates that it is now known as the world's worst water weed.\n\nIn AME, the earliest reports on the weed were from Egypt in the late 1800s. Today, however, it is present in the freshwater bodies of practically all countries in the region. People have been enticed to carry the weed as an ornament because of its attractive flower. However, more important explanations for the continental spread of the weed include its capacity to quickly multiply when away from its natural enemies in South America.\n\nOnce in a freshwater body, water hyacinth often grows as floating plants or mats, as islands of plants floating freely on the water, or mixed with other vegetation on river banks. In nutrient-rich waters, such as in polluted ponds or lakes, it can grow so quickly that the surface covered by the mats doubles every 4-7 days.\n\nA single shoot of the plant may start a huge infestation. Steamers, boats, canoes, or fishing nets can carry plants upstream. Mats of floating plants may become stranded on banks and shorelines when the water level falls. They float again when the water level rises. Floating plants gather together as mats on the leeward side of river islands, on the windward side of peninsulas, inside river bends, or in quiet lake bays. Healthy mats of water hyacinth become a substrate for the secondary growth of papyrus and other similar plants, which makes the mats more solid, heavier, and more difficult to negotiate, even for large boats.\n\nConnectivity among diverse water bodies has further facilitated the spread of water hyacinth in the region. Another explanation has been the inability of communities and governments to respond to weed infestations before they become crises in their water bodies.\n\nResearch and some pilot efforts have shown that water hyacinth can be used as raw material for agricultural fertilizer, animal feed, biogas, paper, board, and even construction materials. The plant can also quickly absorb some heavy metals in the water and can be of use in controlling water pollution. Local experience indicates, however, that debris from its vegetation and roots may make clean water unsuitable for drinking or other domestic uses. Furthermore, the technologies available for potential uses of water hyacinth are not yet competitive in the market, and thus they are ineffective as control alternatives today.\n\nThe importance of water hyacinth stems from its potential to produce negative consequences for the productive and habitat quality of water bodies and for the communities that depend on them. For example,\n\nWater-hyacinth infestations clog irrigation canals, diminishing the amount of water they usually deliver, particularly at their tail ends;\n\nWaterways and even ports, such as Port Bell in Kampala, Uganda, get too clogged for boats to get through;\n\nElectricity production becomes more expensive because of the effort needed to prevent the clogging of turbines with mats of the weed, such as at Owen Falls, Jinja, Uganda;\n\nMats block light from penetrating river water, which induces changes in the flora and fauna underneath, sometimes hindering fish production and resulting in unemployment and diminished incomes and food for riparian communities;\n\nLocal plants and animals lose their habitats; and\n\nThe quality of drinking, cooking, and washing water deteriorates.\n\nFrom around the world, there are even reports of village people dying from the problems of heavy water-hyacinth infestation. For example, people have died from\n\nStarvation because they could not reach food sources;\n\nBites of venomous snakes hiding in water-hyacinth mats;\n\nAttacks by crocodiles taking shelter in water-hyacinth mats;\n\nDiseases carried by mosquitoes (malaria) or snails (bilharzia) that breed in water-hyacinth environments; and\n\nFatigue from pushing canoes through clogged waterways.\n\nManual and mechanical approaches to managing and controlling infestations of water hyacinth include the use of physical barriers. Such approaches are usually the most effective and quick, but they are also expensive and difficult to organize and sustain. Chemical control can also be quick; it has been successful in Florida, United States, for example. But its management demands more skill, and environmental concerns still impede its acceptance. The preferred option is biological control, using the weed's natural enemies imported from South America and tested for their specificity under the conditions of AME. This is environmentally safe; however, it may take time to establish. The ideal would be an integrated water-hyacinth control, one that makes prompt and judicious use of individual control methods while taking into account the specificity of the infestation.\n\nThis page intentionally left blank\n\nChapter 3\n\nSPREAD AND CONSEQUENCES OF WATER HYACINTH IN AME\n\nA sample survey of 29 AME countries indicated that most of these countries have water hyacinth, and 21 of them confirmed that the weed is already a problem within their borders.\n\nWater hyacinth has invaded various countries of West Africa at various times, but most of the invasions have occurred since the early 1980s. An exception is the Republic of the Congo, where the weed was first noted in 1957. In Benin, people first noticed the weed in 1980-81, in the Ouémé River, but it became an outbreak in 1985. Some records indicate the weed has been in this country since 1977. It was first recorded in Ghana and Nigeria in 1984 (around Badagry Creek and Tema, respectively); the Volta River, Burkina Faso, 1991; Mali, in the 1990s; and Niger, 1990-94.\n\nWater hyacinth is not widely present in West Africa. Some countries, such as Gambia, Guinea (Conakry), and Senegal, are, for practical purposes, still without the weed. In some countries, it only appears in the water bodies of certain regions, for example, southern Benin. In these countries, emphasis should be on creating public awareness to arrest the introduction and spread of the problem.\n\nWater hyacinth was initially recorded in Egypt in the late 1880s, but the potential problem for water resources was not noted until 1932. It became a problem in 1975-85. In general, Egypt had no problem with water hyacinth before the construction of the Aswan High Dam. Until then, the annual flood of the Nile had flushed the weed out to the Mediterranean.\n\nIn South Africa, observers first noted the weed in 1910, but not until 1983 did the Conservation of Agriculture Act declare it a noxious weed that \"must be controlled.\" This Act is administered by the Department of Water Affairs.\n\nOutside South Africa, water hyacinth has been present in eastern and southern Africa for the more than four decades since it was initially recorded in Zimbabwe in 1937. It continued to colonize important water bodies in the region, such as the Incomati River (Mozambique) in 1946, the Zambezi River and some important rivers in Ethiopia in 1956, rivers in Rwanda and Burundi in the late 1950s, the rivers Pangani (Tanzania) and Kafue (Zambia) in the 1960s, the Shire River (Malawi) in 1968, and Lake Naivasha (Kenya) in 1982–83. Most recent records of infestations are from lakes Kyoga in Uganda in 1988-89, Victoria in 1989-90, Malawi-Nyasa in 1996, and Tanganyika in 1997.\n\nThe IDRC–PLaW consultation found that water-hyacinth infestations are rapidly increasing in AME. Furthermore, many of its consequences and related problems have become known only since the weed has been present in the region. However, these consequences have neither been systematically studied (quantified and documented) nor totally understood.\n\nExamples of the consequences of water-hyacinth infestations are most striking in crisis situations, such as the one in Lake Victoria. The consultant reports indicate that these infestations have had negative impacts on fisheries and fish-related commercial activities; the efficiency of irrigation canals, navigation, and water transport; hydroelectricity generation; and water-storage capacity (for example, as a result of increased evapotranspiration in reservoirs). These infestations can also interfere with communities' access to good-quality water (water pumping and treatment); increase the incidence of such diseases as bilharzia, malaria, and cholera; and induce changes in the aquatic environment, as happens under water-hyacinth mats, where the reduction in dissolved oxygen affects other organisms in the water.\n\nDuring the consultation, dwellers of riparian communities also pointed to many social, health, and economic problems resulting from water-hyacinth infestations. These include emigration of fishers to other water bodies, difficulties in accessing river banks, protein deficiency resulting from the unavailability of fish, and obstruction of boat and \"fish landing sites\" (sites where fishing boats land and unload fish).\n\nAlthough the range of problems with water-hyacinth infestation is in general terms widely known and expected, the real impact on the socioeconomic status and welfare of the people who depend on the affected water has been neither well analyzed nor well documented. This is one of the most certain explanations for why the water-hyacinth problem is still poorly understood. The consultants were unable to obtain solid information on the socioeconomic and welfare effects of water-hyacinth infestations, even on the basis of case studies, but found that this is one of the types of information decision-makers need the most. This is certainly an important knowledge gap and a further challenge for researchers.\n\nChapter 4\n\nHANDLING THE WATER-HYACINTH PROBLEM\n\nAME has enough experience, expertise, knowledge, and support to effectively control or manage water hyacinth. This is clearly indicated in the consultant reports, which include long lists of organizations, institutions, and government agencies with responsibilities related to the control or management of the weed. These lists, summarized in Appendix 4, include national, regional, and international centres with expertise on water-hyacinth control and management. International organizations that have provided technical support include the International Institute for Tropical Agriculture (IITA), the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Organization (Australia) (CSIRO), and the Centre for Agriculture and Biosciences International (CABI). The lists also include agencies that have supported initiatives on water hyacinth, such as the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and the United Kingdom Commonwealth Science Council (CSC), and donors not included in Appendix 4, such as the Gessellschaft für Technische Zusammenarbeit (GTZ) (technical-cooperation agency), the Japan International Cooperation Agency, the Danish International Development Agency, the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), the European Union, and the United Kingdom Department for International Development (DFiD).\n\nIn another report, the consultants put together a bibliography with more than 1000 entries on water hyacinth in AME. This bibliography is available at the IDRC-PLaW website (www.idrc.ca/plaw).\n\nHowever, the ongoing and accelerating spread of weed infestation indicates that the region has been unable to put its capability to work. The consultation confirmed that the region has serious difficulties effectively mobilizing its capability in response to early signs of risk for water-hyacinth infestation in water bodies across AME. In most cases, an infestation has reached crises proportions before control effectively begins. For example, informants in all of the 21 survey countries where water hyacinth was already a problem indicated that control efforts did not start until infestations reached crisis proportions. The reasons for the difficulties that national, regional, and even international support organizations have in responding to water-hyacinth infestations are institutional, technical, and financial.\n\nThe main institutional constraints have to do with problems of organization and bureaucracy across the many units within a country — sometimes even within one ministry — that deal with the weed. Usually, these units act without coordination or communication, often with different or conflicting objectives and with limited access to information and resources. Specifically, stakeholders identified the generally poor flow of information and the associated lack of timely access to such information by key decision-makers as the most critical constraints in need of immediate attention. Key constraints of this nature concern information on the spread and consequences of water hyacinth and on the available knowledge and expertise needed for early control. Such information should include data on the socioeconomic impacts of water hyacinth and the basic facts about the weed that make it a problem and determine control options.\n\nThe unnecessary bureaucracy of responsible institutions slows the initiation and implementation of programs for water-hyacinth control and prevents the effective participation of riparian communities in campaigns to control water hyacinth. Furthermore, most countries have no policy on water hyacinth. Such a policy would designate the weed as a menace to water resources and spell out the need for urgent and effective control and management strategies.\n\nTechnical problems include the lack of an appropriate integrated strategy for water-hyacinth control in AME. For this reason, countries in the region use the available control options merely as a series of tools to combat the weed, and their efforts have often been uncoordinated and largely ineffective. When combined with the institutional limitations, technical problems also include\n\nDifficulties in identification of lead organizations with relevant structures to effectively coordinate control efforts and ensure the full participation of key stakeholders;\n\nLack of regional efforts to ensure the collaboration and interaction of key players and the harmonization of efforts to control water hyacinth on a whole-catchment basis; and\n\nLack of back-up services for techniques such as mechanical control.\n\nFinancial problems emanate from the very belief that efforts to control and manage water hyacinth are poorly funded. This undermines efforts, even when governments and other agencies avail funds.\n\nThe consultation also found some instances of success in handling water hyacinth across AME. These experiences offer lessons and should be used to provide models for future action (Chapter 9 gives a summary of these findings). Successful efforts to control water hyacinth were reported from Benin, Egypt, South Africa, Sudan, and Zimbabwe, among others. Mechanical and chemical (herbicide) approaches to water-hyacinth control are the most widely used, for example, in Egypt and South Africa. However, some cases also show the successful use of biological control, for example, in Benin, southern Africa, West Africa, Zimbabwe and, recently, Lake Victoria (East Africa).\n\nThis page intentionally left blank\n\nChapter 5\n\nKNOWLEDGE GAPS IN WATER-HYACINTH CONTROL\n\nInformation accessibility and flow\n\nIn the consultations, stakeholders evaluated the mechanisms used to exchange water-hyacinth information and the existing barriers to effective communication. They also reviewed the key players' access to up-to-date sources of information and modern, quicker, and more cost-effective means of communication, such as the modern information and communication technologies.\n\nParticipants acknowledged that centres in AME and beyond had a wealth of water-hyacinth information. However, this information is not easily accessible to key decision-makers, policymakers, researchers, and representatives of communities who might need it in mobilizing and executing effective control, as well as in evaluation programs. Thus, problems occur in accessing information such as the following:\n\nThe actual water-hyacinth problem and the types and magnitude of its socioeconomic and environmental costs;\n\nThe available alternatives for control of water hyacinth and their effectiveness, cost, and possible benefits; and\n\nExperiences in effective management of the weed problem in other situations within the region and globally.\n\nAs a recommendation for immediate implementation, the participants in the survey and workshop asked IDRC to assist in improving the flow of water-hyacinth information in both print and electronic forms. To achieve this, it was recommended that IDRC champion the setting up and installation of a Water Hyacinth Information Clearinghouse. This mechanism would make information more accessible to key players and facilitate their interaction.\n\nResearch priorities\n\nBiological, herbicidal, and physical methods of controlling water hyacinth have been used in various combinations across AME. These efforts have been successful in a few cases but in general have not contributed to the effective handling of the weed. Although a lot of research has been conducted on water-hyacinth control globally, the survey respondents and participants at the workshop acknowledged significant knowledge gaps, including a lack of precise knowledge of the relative effectiveness of various approaches in various situations. Where these approaches have been in use, each one has demonstrated strengths as well as weaknesses. Although everyone agrees on the need to combine more than one approach in an integrated strategy, no one has carried out research on how to develop this for transfer to potential users.\n\nAmong the stakeholders consulted, there is a widespread appreciation of the type and seriousness of the disruptions to the habitat and productive functioning of water bodies caused by water-hyacinth infestations. However, it was acknowledged that the exact magnitude of social, economic, and environmental consequences was poorly understood in AME and globally.\n\nThese aspects require urgent attention. Research is needed to quantitatively define the impacts of water-hyacinth infestations and to prompt action.\n\nRecommendations to IDRC\n\nStakeholders also made specific recommendations to IDRC, identifying a niche for IDRC to continue supporting research for development activities focusing on water-hyacinth control and management in AME.\n\nStakeholders recommended the following:\n\nChampion and support the installation of a mechanism for information flow and exchange (a Water Hyacinth Information Clearinghouse);\n\nSupport the establishment of a modern electronic-communication infrastructure for strategic centres of expertise on water-hyacinth control and management;\n\nSupport the interaction of key players in water-hyacinth control and management from within AME;\n\nSupport strategic research and studies, such as the quantification of the socioeconomic impacts of water hyacinth on riparian communities; and\n\nChampion and support the development of early-warning mechanisms for impending water-hyacinth problems.\n\nIn response to these suggestions, IDRC, in collaboration with several partners, developed a \"blueprint\" for a Water Hyacinth Information Partnership (WHIP). The concept and model of WHIP have been endorsed by East African national and regional institutions and is part of East Africa Cooperation's plans for managing water-invasive weeds regionally. Negotiations are under way for WHIP's funding and installation.\n\nThis page intentionally left blank\n\nPART II\n\nProceedings of the Workshop\n\nThis page intentionally left blank\n\nPREFACE TO PART II\n\nWater hyacinth continues to infest freshwater bodies across AME because the region is unable to mobilize existing expertise and resources to control the weed in time. This was confirmed in the 1996–97 survey and consultation initiative of IDRC's PLaW program. The survey culminated in a workshop, Improving Reaction to Water Hyacinth in Affected Countries Across Africa and the Middle East, which was held in Nairobi, Kenya, from 17 to 19 September 1997.\n\nThe 60 participants, including experts from the entire AME, were drawn from such fields as biological, mechanical, and herbicidal control of water hyacinth. Also in attendance were academicians, donor representatives, other decision-makers, and representatives of communities — key stakeholders in the region's water resources. These proceedings are the output of the workshop.\n\nThe report begins with the welcoming and guiding presentations and the keynote address by Dr F. Orach-Meza, Head of the Ugandan National Secretariat for the Lake Victoria Environmental Management Program (LVEMP). The central two sections focus on the main issues emerging from the regional survey and case studies regarding the status of water hyacinth and its management in the region; and on the recommendations emerging from the workshop for immediate and longer term action to manage the weed. The discussions and the exchange are partly reported here. The report closes with reflections by the organizers and remarks by the IDRC Regional Director indicating IDRC's willingness to follow up on the key recommendations from the workshop. The appendixes include a description of the survey instrument, reports from the three working groups, and a list of participants and their addresses.\n\nOne of the key recommendations is to install and support the operations of a Water Hyacinth Information Clearinghouse. This would facilitate the flow of information critical to prompt decision-making by key players responsible for, and capable of, handling the weed problem in AME. IDRC was encouraged to champion this drive among users and supporters.\n\nLuis Navarro\n\nGeorge Phiri\n\nThis page intentionally left blank\n\nChapter 6\n\nWELCOMING ADDRESS\n\nEva M. Rathgeber\n\nIntroduction\n\nIt gives me great pleasure to welcome you to this very special workshop on improving responses to water hyacinth in affected countries across AME. It is certainly encouraging to see interaction among key policymakers, researchers, various organizations, and community representatives jointly trying to address this very important concern.\n\nWater hyacinth is fast covering useful inland water bodies, changing their environment, and affecting millions of people who depend on them across AME, water bodies such as the Nile, Zambezi, Congo, and Niger rivers, as well as lakes Victoria and Malawi. This has led to a variety of socioeconomic problems among communities and organizations that depend on the affected water bodies, threatening not only food security but also marine transportation and the health of local communities (Njiwa 1996).\n\nFor instance, the weed has clogged the Kafue River, which is regarded as one of the most important rivers in Zambia, supporting 40% of the country's 8 million people (Kamyomeka 1997). In Malawi, it is found throughout the Shire River system, including the country's major hydroelectric installations near the intake point that supplies the country's main commercial city of Blantyre (Phiri 1997).\n\nLake Victoria — a substantial economic resource for a third of the total population of Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda — has not been spared by the rapid invasion of the weed. Fishing, which generates $320 million a year in fish exports, is adversely affected; waterborne diseases are fast on the increase; and water hyacinth has gradually blocked the navigation channels of the lake basin (Njiwa 1996). The problems of one Kenyan village, Kaduong, south of Kisumu, attests to these facts. The weed has swamped the entire world of this 2000-strong fishing community, leaving 52 fishing boats marooned; the godowns where they sold their fish are permanently locked; and the old shorefront hotel has collapsed. Diseases such as dysentery, malaria, and bilharzia have increased (Githongo and Johnstone 1997).\n\nAfter years of research, technological expertise to control water hyacinth is available. Control efforts have been variously employed but almost always after the spread of the weed has reached a crisis level, as in the case of Lake Victoria. Regional efforts to tame the weed on Lake Victoria, the second largest freshwater body in the world, were initiated when the weed had already covered more than 10000 ha of lake water in Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda. Action was taken, in other words, when the situation was already a disaster. Why is action to fight water hyacinth not effected promptly, despite knowledge, experience, and expertise in the region and beyond that could enable communities to combat and manage the menacing weed?\n\nThis is a major concern of IDRC, and since 1996, through its PLaW program, it has supported the Water Hyacinth Management Capability in Africa and the Middle East initiative, which seeks to identify ways for national, regional, and international organizations in AME to more quickly establish effective mechanisms to control water hyacinth.\n\nIDRC's program priorities\n\nIDRC is dedicated to supporting research and has actively supported thousands of research projects in Africa, Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean, and the Middle East during the past 27 years. The presence of IDRC's four regional offices in Africa is indicative of the strong emphasis it places on programing in AME.\n\nIDRC's program support is currently organized under six strategic development themes: food security, equity in natural-resources use, biodiversity conservation, sustainable employment, strategies and policies for healthy societies, and information and communication.\n\nUnder the theme of equity in natural-resources use, IDRC has funded research on\n\nDecision-making processes that integrate environmental, social, and economic objectives for shared and common-property resources;\n\nResource-management policies for selected regions or countries that face a policy vacuum as a result of recent political disruption, such as in Cambodia and Mozambique; and\n\nWays to manage the multiple and often conflicting demands for water in AME.1\n\nIDRC is committed to supporting and coordinating critical research to improve the capability of countries in the region to effectively deal with the water-hyacinth problem.\n\nChallenges\n\nThe challenges ahead involve not only addressing the current crisis but also developing long-term strategies for effective water-hyacinth control. I cannot overemphasize the urgency in this matter.\n\nAs we go through the workshop deliberations, it is my hope that we will identify effective mechanisms to improve the flow of information and the interaction of key players in water-hyacinth management. We should also focus our attention on identifying priorities for research and interventions that will stimulate and support the development of effective control mechanisms.\n\nLet this be a first step in building partnerships, and let us continue to network in this critical area to make a significant contribution to the quality of life of riparian communities in AME.\n\nI wish you a most successful workshop.\n\nReferences\n\nGithongo, J.; Johnstone, R. 1997.

Program initiatives are the discrete units through which IDRC supports research for development today (IDRC 1997).\n\nWhy the initiative and this workshop?\n\nWhat we have learned (and expect to validate at this workshop) is that\n\nWater hyacinth is not a recent phenomenon in AME;\n\nAME has plenty of water-hyacinth experience, knowledge, and expertise; and\n\nThere is plenty of water-hyacinth experience, knowledge, and expertise outside AME, including groups with differing approaches to the water-hyacinth problem.\n\nIt must be stressed, however, that in practically all cases, water-hyacinth invasion within AME becomes a crisis before measures to control it are begun.\n\nWe have become interested in why this is so. However, we are more interested in what can be done now to facilitate the mobilization of available and accessible capabilities and resources to face water hyacinth in a more timely, effective, and efficient manner.\n\nWe have also learned that shortage of resources is not a good enough explanation for why the water-hyacinth problem has not been adequately dealt with. We decided, therefore, to look for more answers in AME, with the following caveat: We are not just looking for a postmortem-type description of the situation. We are even less interested in efforts to identify responsible parties who have not done their work at all or well enough. Nor are we looking for project proposals at this stage. We want to identify ideas that, for starters, will help us to mobilize ourselves here at this workshop, along with others we are interacting with, in efforts to improve our ability to tackle water hyacinth before it becomes a menace. We also want to exploit the beneficial features of water hyacinth, which we all know it has.\n\nWe want to carry this interest through this workshop.\n\nIDRC interest\n\nSince our preliminary analyses we have noticed that the availability and timely flow of information are problem areas requiring attention. Because the generation and dissemination of knowledge-carrying information are part of IDRC's business and expertise, we want to give this special attention. We will stay alert to your suggestions.\n\nWhat has been done?\n\nWe have mobilized the attention of the PLaW team and some of our best collaborators: Dr Herren of the International Centre for Insect Physiology and Ecology (ICIPE), Dr Hill of the International Institute of Biological Control (HBC) (and now of CABI Bioscience), and Dr Twongo of the Fisheries Research Institute in Uganda, among others. Although most of our informal interaction has been with researchers, we have also talked with journalists, fishers, and representatives of the private sector. The message from the private sector is always the same: We are ready and only waiting for the opportunity and conditions for our participation.\n\nAs part of our initiative, we engaged a team of seven regional consultants with experience in the subject and an interest in the questions raised. They surveyed the extent of the problem, studied the locally generated literature, looked at the water-hyacinth expertise across AME, and familiarized themselves with the diverse experiences with the weed. Finally, they conducted a few specific case studies, with attention to the socioeconomic and environmental consequences of water hyacinth. We did not ask for detailed or profound technical answers on the development of the weed or its control. We were more interested in the people's experiences in mobilizing, organizing, and equipping themselves for the task and in the effectiveness of their interventions. We will hear reports from five of these consultants, as input and stimuli to your own contributions.\n\nThe consultants are Prof. A.F. Khattab, Prof. Y.H. Fayad, and Dr M.O. Bashir, who surveyed mainly Egypt and Sudan; Mr O. Diop and Mr M. Dieng, who worked in a number of countries in West Africa; Dr C. Cilliers, who worked in Namibia and South Africa; and Dr G. Phiri, who was the team leader and worked in East and southern Africa (except Namibia and South Africa).\n\nTo conclude the initiative, we staged this workshop, which is expected to validate and enrich our findings thus far.\n\nThe workshop\n\nObjectives\n\nThe objectives of the workshop are the following:\n\nTo identify research and implementation strategies to improve the management of water-hyacinth problems in the region — Priority areas include community participation and organization in handling the weed problem; supporting policies and services from the public and private sectors; and development of technical strategies and tools to control or manage the water-hyacinth problem.\n\nTo examine the possibility of establishing a Water Hyacinth Information Clearinghouse to facilitate the timely flow of information for related decision-making in the region — Is this be a useful first step in improving interaction and effective decision-making among key players? If it is, what would be the mandate functions and main activities of such a clearinghouse? How would it be established and sustained?\n\nProcess\n\nOur work will be structured in plenary and working-group discussions.\n\nStart-up plenaries\n\nTo provide input and guidance for discussions at the workshop, we will start with a keynote address by Dr F.L. Orach-Meza, who is Head of the Ugandan National Secretariat for LVEMP. The consultants will then make brief reports on their findings and case studies.\n\nThis will be followed by a plenary discussion in which we expect to get the benefit of your experience, knowledge, and interest.\n\nGroup work and discussion of reports\n\nThe workshop will then be divided into three working groups, each with the similar task of providing a report with recommendations for immediate and longer term action in response to the objectives of the workshop. The reports from the working groups will be discussed in another plenary, after which each group will go back to incorporate the feedback from the plenary into its own report.\n\nConsolidation and plenary discussion of the workshop report\n\nWith the help of the working-group chairpersons, the consultants will consolidate the three working-group reports into one report. This consolidated report will be discussed in a final plenary.\n\nFacilitation\n\nTo help us through this workshop, we will have the participation of Ms Amina Kasinga from Eureka Educational and Training Consultants, in Mombasa, who has experience facilitating meetings with audiences like this, where diverse talents and experiences have been brought together. However, this will not be a \"fully facilitated meeting\" in the modern sense. We will have no warming-up or ice-breaking sessions. More so, we will still use chairpersons for some of the sessions and working groups. However, Ms Kasinga will be there as a resource person to help guide plenary discussions, ensuring that we stick to the objectives and schedule. Each session will also have a rapporteur. People asking questions will be asked to write down the questions in brief for purposes of report compilation.\n\nA secretariat is available to help with arrangements for travel, photocopying, and preparation of transparencies and documentation. Ms Florence Waiyaki will be there to assist you. Dr George Phiri and Dr Luis Navarro will also be available to help.\n\nOnce again, I welcome you all and hope your discussions will be enjoyable and productive.\n\nReference\n\nIDRC (International Development Research Centre). 1997.

It assesses, in general terms, the present status of and trends in the water-hyacinth problem, its distribution, and its potential consequences. It also reviews how the problem has been handled across affected countries in Africa and further identifies the main shortcomings and the reasons for these shortcomings.\n\nThis discussion raises challenges and potential opportunities for participants to consider in providing recommendations to improve capabilities in Africa for responding to, and effectively handling, the water-hyacinth problem.\n\nFinally, this address anticipates a response from participants on a proposal to establish mechanisms to improve the interaction of key players in water-hyacinth control across the region. It suggests setting up an information clearing-house to facilitate exchange of information and cooperation to more effectively handle the water-hyacinth problem in AME.\n\nIntroduction\n\nMany of us recall the many workshops, seminars, conferences, meetings, and consultations that have taken place in various countries to scientifically analyze water hyacinth, identify solutions to the multiple problems it causes, and recommend measures to bring it under control. We have held meetings on water hyacinth since the weed started spreading from its native land in South America to parts of the globe where it has no natural enemies. In the new countries, it has proliferated and created innumerable problems for communities and the environment. Since these gatherings took place, several action plans for the control of water hyacinth have been implemented in various countries but usually half-heartedly or too slowly, given the prevalence of the weed; and they have had varying degrees of success and failure. An updated review of these interventions will be covered in other presentations. We can, however, ask ourselves why actions to combat the weed have usually not been initiated in time, and why these efforts do not appear to have effectively controlled the weed. What has gone wrong?\n\nThe most recent of these many workshops and expert consultations took place in Harare, Zimbabwe; Florida, United States; Kampala, Uganda; and Washington, DC, United States (at the World Bank). These meetings drew wide participation from many countries with an interest in the weed. Water hyacinth continues to feature as a special topic at a wide variety of other related conferences and meetings.\n\nThis time around, with a wealth of scientific, technological, and managerial experience and knowledge, a well-thought-out title has been provided for this consultative workshop — with which I am very happy to be associated. The title, Improving Reaction to Water Hyacinth in Affected Countries Across Africa and the Middle East, befits this stage of development in the national, regional, and international efforts to bring this widely recognized menace of our waterways under effective and permanent control, acknowledging that total eradication is impossible. Accordingly, I have headed my keynote address \"Challenges for improving reaction to water hyacinth in AME,\" with a view to asking for a strategic action plan for gearing up effective efforts to decisively win the declared war on water hyacinth.\n\nI presume that everyone at this gathering is concerned about the alarming problems caused by water hyacinth in the aquatic environment of AME. I am therefore urging you to focus on accepting the fact that efforts to combat the weed in most countries of our region have not been prompt, despite the availability of options for control of the weed. This focus should, therefore, aim particularly at improving the capability of riparian communities, their respective authorities, and support organizations to more decisively respond to, and effectively handle, the rapid growth and spread of water hyacinth in our region. Perhaps one missing element in the control of the weed has been adequate communication to facilitate the interaction and practical action of researchers, decision-makers, support organizations, and representatives of other stakeholder groups, including communities. Let us, therefore, make this consultative workshop a forum for reviewing the prevailing inadequacies and for declaring a final assault on water hyacinth. Let us go from here prepared, as a region, to achieve the effective management of water hyacinth, instead of allowing the water hyacinth to manage us, as seems to be the case today. Only in this way will the future of our aquatic environment be tamed by us, not by water hyacinth, on a sustainable basis.\n\nThe nature of water hyacinth\n\nPreparedness to deal with water hyacinth involves collecting information and data on the weed and identifying weaknesses in current control approaches. It also involves an improvement in strategies for effective, prompt, and cost-effective control. Researchers have come up with new findings on the ecological and biological status of water hyacinth (its position in the food chain), on available tools for its control, and on the relative effectiveness of each option.\n\nGopal (1987) reviewed the literature on the systematic, morphological, developmental, biological, and ecological aspects of water hyacinth. The weed is known to\n\nBe a successful invader of freshwater, nutrient-rich, eutrophic environments;\n\nHave a high rate of vegetative growth and multiplication;\n\nProduce seeds that remain viable for very long periods;\n\nHave a fairly wide ecological amplitude; and\n\nExhibit great phenotypic plasticity.\n\nEver since its introduction outside South America in places where it has no natural enemies, water hyacinth has created innumerable problems for communities. It interferes with water use by directly obstructing navigation, blocking water-intake points, causing turbidity in shallow waters used for domestic purposes, and interfering with water flow in irrigation channels. It has also been responsible for drastic changes in the plant and animal communities of freshwater environments. It is associated with fish kills and the proliferation of agents of several deadly diseases (Thompson 1991; Willoughby et al. 1993; Orach-Meza 1996).\n\nExactly when the weed invaded or was introduced into Africa is uncertain, but it began to proliferate in Egypt during the later years of the 19th century. It then appeared in South Africa, Republic of the Congo, Sudan, Tanzania, Kenya, Zimbabwe, Zambia, and Rwanda. It must have started proliferating on Lake Kyoga in Uganda before 1987, when researchers sighted the weed on the lake (Twongo 1988).\n\nWater hyacinth often grows as mats of floating plants, as islands of plants floating freely on the water, or dispersed among the vegetation on riverbanks. A single shoot of the plant is enough to start a huge infestation. Steamers, boats, canoes, or fishing nets may carry it upstream. The plants multiply and increase rapidly, forming islands of floating plants that may become stranded on banks and shorelines when the water level falls. They float again when the water level rises. Floating islands gather together as mats on the leeward side of river islands, in river bends, in areas on the windward side of peninsulas, or in quiet lake bays. Large mats can penetrate and obstruct narrow channels leading to fish landing sites (where fishing boats unload their cargo). They are also found in clumps of fringing macrophytes, often 10 or 15 m wide. At times, they completely obstruct inlets and fish landings, and they often completely block ferry crossings.\n\nGopal (1987) indicated that where the plant produces seeds, the seeds may cause a new outbreak of water hyacinth even after a site is completely cleared of an initial infestation. Evans (1963) reported seed production in Zaire. It is also known that birds and animals that feed in sites of water-hyacinth infestation transport the seeds over considerable distances on their feet. Transported seed may have caused most of the current invasion of Lake Victoria. Water hyacinth also multiplies through the production of daughter plants.\n\nThe impact of water-hyacinth invasion\n\nWater bodies in Africa are important for fisheries, domestic and industrial water supplies, livestock and irrigation, transportation, communication, sports, recreation, and tourism. They are also important in moderating the climate, as well as sustaining the gene pools of an assemblage of plants, fish, insects, reptiles, and birds. In African rivers, lakes, swamps, and lagoons, water hyacinth has been increasing at an alarming rate. The interdependence of the networks of African waters in neighbouring states has facilitated its spread to new aquatic environments.\n\nWater hyacinth has severe socioeconomic effects on human populations in areas where people depend on lakes and rivers for transportation, fishing, drinking, and meeting other needs. The weed increases the rate of water loss and interferes with agricultural and hydroelectric-power schemes. It also poses serious environmental problems in key wetlands in Africa. In addition, it prevents oxygenation of water and the establishment of phytoplankton and much of the zooplankton, making areas unsuitable for fish-feeding and fish-breeding. The dense mats of the weed block rural communities' access to areas of water and prevent their setting and removal of fishing gear, which makes fishing impossible.\n\nObstruction of light by the mats impedes photosynthetic processes, thereby breaking down life cycles and food-web systems in the water. Biodiversity is reduced. The sedimentation, decomposition, and fermentation of dead organisms and rotten weeds may reduce the quality of water bodies (eutrophication). The weed's massive cover also increases the rate of evapotranspiration, resulting in water loss; provides habitat for vectors of malaria and bilharzia; harbours poisonous snakes; causes skin rashes; and can host agents of amoebic dysentery and typhoid. It is also known to have had negative effects on the health of riparian communities and other users of infested water bodies. Debris from its vegetation and roots creates murky water, making it unsuitable for drinking or other domestic uses. These impacts pose an additional burden on the limited health services and facilities available to poor rural communities.\n\nThese local experiences of the water hyacinth's negative effects on domestic water supply go against the common knowledge that the weed can purify polluted water. The fact is that water hyacinth can have negative effects on clean water but can also be useful in purifying water heavily polluted with some heavy metals. This feature adds complexity to its management.\n\nThe often ineffective and delayed efforts to control water hyacinth have more clearly compromised the health of Africa's water bodies. This weed grows extraordinarily rapidly, so action taken now will limit damage and slow the spread of the weed to new areas in AME.\n\nAvailable measures for water-hyacinth control\n\nIn view of the potentially serious socioeconomic and environmental consequences of water-hyacinth infestation, this workshop should emphasize the urgent need for immediate action to improve the effectiveness of efforts to combat the weed. This is important, as the cost of doing nothing or of not doing anything promptly would be enormous economic losses and environmental degradation in AME.\n\nOver the years, some countries in the region have taken manual, biological, mechanical, and chemical measures to try to control water hyacinth. These have often been accompanied by surveillance and public-awareness campaigns and have achieved some success. In most cases, the methods adopted were derived from recommendations made at conferences, workshops, or consultations with experts.\n\nThe 1991 workshop on the Control of Africa's Floating Water Weeds (CSC 1991), held in Harare, Zimbabwe, resulted in the following recommendations for aquatic-weed control at national and regional levels:\n\n1. On action to control floating water weeds\n\nFavour site-specific controls that integrate biological, physical, chemical, and other methods;\n\nImplement biological-control measures as soon as an infestation is confirmed, because this method is the most cost-effective, permanent, and environmentally friendly;\n\nConsider appropriate chemical, physical, or other methods when stop-gap control is urgently required;\n\nEnsure, where other methods of control are needed, that these do not jeopardize biological control; and\n\nPrevent, at all costs (especially through legislative measures), the spread of the weed to noninfested regions.\n\n2. On the role of catchment management in water-weed control — Given that water weeds can spread rapidly within and between catchments and that the flow of nutrients into water bodies is known to increase the growth of water weeds and make control more difficult,\n\nInclude control measures as part of a larger land-use management policy for sustainable development of watersheds;\n\nTake action to reduce nutrient levels in infested water bodies, where appropriate; and\n\nEnforce legislation to control pollutants from point sources.\n\n3. On research\n\nConduct ecological studies of aquatic ecosystems affected or threatened by water hyacinth;\n\nUndertake comparative studies of the socioeconomic conditions of communities in weed-infested and noninfested areas;\n\nInvestigate safer herbicides;\n\nConduct postrelease studies on bioagents; and\n\nStudy the development of computerized management systems to assist in decision-making.\n\n4. On training\n\nProvide PhD and MSc training, as well as relevant short-term orientation courses, seminars, and workshops.\n\n5. On information communication\n\nProduce and distribute technical information and promote the immediate publication of research findings for the use of decision-makers.\n\nNational programs for dealing with impending water-hyacinth problems have so far been extremely slow to adopt such recommendations, and control efforts have often been uncoordinated. Such infestations have grown from small to crisis situations without effective action being taken to combat them. One explanation advanced for this has been that people at high political and bureaucratic levels have no awareness of the scope of the problem before a crisis occurs. Furthermore, most countries in AME have no centralized decision-making bodies to deal quickly and effectively with such problems. As a result, these countries usually provide no budget for routine surveillance. Also, delays occur in soliciting and releasing funds to manage water-hyacinth crises when they occur. It is therefore not surprising that most outbreaks are dealt with on an ad hoc, \"fire-fighting\" basis, often in response to outcries from the community, during which time the crisis often worsens. The responses have usually been reactions to crisis events, rather than anticipation of emerging problems.\n\nIt is important to design national programs for water-hyacinth control to overcome these obstacles, such as by\n\nEnsuring early recognition of the potentially serious consequences of weed infestation at the highest political and administrative levels;\n\nEstablishing a single organization in the affected country, with full responsibility for dealing with the weed problem and coordinating the efforts of other stakeholders;\n\nProviding adequate funding through routine budgeting;\n\nDrafting regulations to prevent the introduction and spread of water hyacinth; and\n\nStreamlining procedures for registering herbicides with positive environmental attributes and for importing biological-control agents.\n\nThis workshop should also review and make recommendations on the availability and accessibility of information on water hyacinth, especially on control options and their effectiveness. This would help to ensure informed decision-making.\n\nParticipants in this workshop are aware that the spread of water hyacinth respects no international boundaries. It is also clear that only joint action will lead to sustainable and cost-effective control, especially where countries share infested water bodies. However, it is not so obvious how such countries can\n\nJointly develop action proposals based on cooperative assessments of regional or Africa-wide water-hyacinth threats;\n\nExchange information, share expertise, formulate and integrate joint training programs, facilitate cross-border surveys, and harmonize regulations for the introduction of biological-control agents;\n\nEstablish early-warning systems for initial infestation, movement, and rate of control of water hyacinth in AME; and\n\nTeam up to seek and muster financial support for joint action.\n\nParticipants in this workshop have been challenged to think of a mechanism for communicating information — like an information clearinghouse — that would facilitate interaction among key players and countries facing common problems with water hyacinth. Such an initiative could also be used for facilitating communication on ongoing efforts and results of research in various countries, as well as for supporting other mechanisms, such as newsletters and workshops. In addressing this challenge, participants should consider the following questions:\n\nWould the establishment of a coordinating and clearinghouse mechanism be a useful first step in improving the interaction and effective decision-making of the key players?\n\nIf so, what should its mandate, functions, and main activities be?\n\nWould these contribute to coordination of information flow, as well as to monitoring and evaluation of control efforts?\n\nHow can such a mechanism be established and sustained?\n\nWhat other continental or regional mechanisms might it complement?\n\nConclusions\n\nWater hyacinth poses a real threat to important water bodies in AME. The economic consequences may soon become extremely serious in areas where they have not already been so. The participation of every member of the public is needed to bring the weed under control.\n\nThe crisis in Lake Victoria urgently requires an effective control strategy for water hyacinth. Researchers should make efforts to deal with the deeper and systemic problems that are the real cause of the weed explosion in most aquatic environments. Handling the immediate crisis would be straightforward, given that current knowledge is sufficient. The expertise in the region may be adequate to handle the weed problem if mobilized in time and equipped appropriately. The question is, how can it be accessed by those who need to use it?\n\nSix activities that require immediate action are\n\nGetting rid of the gross accumulation of the weed as quickly as possible;\n\nIntensifying the multiplication and release of biological-control agents as a major component of an integrated, long-term control strategy;\n\nPutting money into research on water-hyacinth growth, propagation rates, and dispersal dynamics;\n\nBuilding the necessary capacity to facilitate water-hyacinth control;\n\nDefining the socioeconomic and environmental problems posed by water hyacinth; and\n\nEstablishing an information clearinghouse for AME.\n\nWe should remember that what has brought us here is the need to (1) identify ways to improve the capability of communities, their authorities, and supporting organizations to respond to, and effectively handle, the water-hyacinth problem in the freshwater bodies of AME; and (2) improve communication and interaction among researchers, decision-makers, and representatives of other stakeholder groups. Only in this way can the water-hyacinth menace in AME be brought under control.\n\nFinally, I wish to take this opportunity to thank the organizers of this workshop and IDRC for inviting me to give this keynote address and participate in this workshop. Of course, I also thank all of you for devoting all or some of your time to the problems of water hyacinth. This workshop would not be possible without your participation. I also wish to assure you that my interest in water hyacinth will not wane until we have a coordinated solution to the problems it causes on the African continent.\n\nReferences\n\nCSC (Commonwealth Science Council). 1991.

The region has not fully mobilized its own existing knowledge and capabilities or those beyond the region to control the weed. Decision-makers, researchers, representatives of communities, and other interested parties usually differ in their perceptions, expectations, and preferences regarding the options available for combating water hyacinth.\n\nThe 1996–97 survey and case studies confirmed this state of affairs. The general objectives of the consultation were to assess the knowledge of, capabilities for, and main bottlenecks in the effective control of water hyacinth; enhance awareness among stakeholders of the socioeconomic and environmental consequences of water-hyacinth infestation; and stimulate the search for effective mechanisms to mobilize people, expertise, and resources to control water hyacinth effectively in AME.\n\nSummaries of the consultants' reports were presented in plenary sessions during the workshop. This discussion highlights the key issues that emerged from the consultants' presentations.\n\nMethodology\n\nThe IDRC regional offices in AME coordinated the consultants' work. Three consultants covered North Africa and the Middle East, especially Egypt and Sudan. One covered eastern and southern Africa; two covered West Africa; and one covered Namibia and South Africa. The survey instrument (Appendix 1) provided major guidance for the consultants. They visited selected libraries and institutions to survey key informants and assess the available information on water hyacinth.\n\nKey findings from regional reports\n\nNorth Africa and the Middle East\n\nEgypt\n\nBACKGROUND — Egypt has the oldest record of water hyacinth in AME. People distributed it as an ornamental plant for public gardens in the vicinities of larger towns, such as Cairo, and in the Nile Delta in the late 1890s and early 1900s (Muschler 1912; Gopal 1987) (although Simpson [1932] reported its presence much later). Before the construction of the High Aswan Dam, the main Nile channel was relatively free of the weed, as it was frequently flushed downstream by annual floods. The impoundment of the river slowed the flow of the Nile. Water hyacinth has since then accumulated and spread widely through the country's extensive network of drainage and irrigation canals fed by the Nile and throughout the delta. Infestation in the Nile River between Aswan and the Mediterranean Sea reached a peak of 8400 ha in 1983. Following various control efforts, the level of infestation decreased to about 380 ha in 1992. Recent statistics show that infestation is on the increase again, with almost 5000 ha recorded in 1996. According to surveys conducted under the Water Hyacinth Management Capability in Africa and the Middle East project, the High Aswan Dam is free of water hyacinth, although small infestations occur 12 km north of the dam. Infestation levels increase northward toward the Nile Delta and the large lakes of Maraud, Edco, Manzala, and Brolos in the north, and these levels of infestation seriously affect farmers and fishers.\n\nEFFORTS TO CONTROL WATER HYACINTH — Egypt initially relied on chemicals to control water hyacinth. It stopped chemical control in about 1990-91, because of environmental concerns.\n\nEgypt has considered biological control but has not fully implemented it. In collaboration with the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), it introduced exotic biological-control agents, evaluated the agents, and conducted host-specificity tests in quarantine during 1978-84. However, it never released these agents to control the weed. To date, Egypt has not adopted the use of these agents for the biological control of water hyacinth — the method is still under review.\n\nSince 1991 Egypt has depended exclusively on physical methods to control water hyacinth. Its Ministry of Public Works and Water Resources (MPWWR) has executed mechanical harvesting and barriers, such as floating booms, in the main channel and claimed success. Farmers remove water hyacinth manually from the small canals that form the net of farm irrigation and drainage systems, but the weed remains a menace.\n\nMPWWR is solely responsible for control of water hyacinth in Egypt but has little dialogue with other stakeholders, such as the Plant Protection Research Institute (PPRI) (under the Ministry of Agriculture and Land Reclamation) and universities.\n\nEgypt has a strong expertise on alternative methods for water-hyacinth control. Such expertise can be found at PPRI, including the knowledge of biological control that Egypt could use to develop an integrated water-hyacinth management strategy. However, an integrated strategy has not developed, owing to a lack of interinstitutional collaboration and national coordination.\n\nSudan\n\nBACKGROUND — Sudan probably has the longest history of water-hyacinth control in AME. The weed was first discovered near Bor town about 1954, presumably having invaded from the Congo River, where it had spread since 1952. In 1958-59, Sudan declared it a pest, like the desert locust and Quelea birds that feed on grain, and then put legislation in place to control it. Water hyacinth breeds continuously around Juba-Malakal, is discharged through Malakal-Kosti, and is lodged over a further 300 km down the Nile. Sudan has partially evaluated the socioeconomic costs of water hyacinth, estimating that the annual water loss from evapotranspiration over 300 km2 of canal would be enough to irrigate more than 400 ha. Effects on navigation in the Nile include 50% higher running and maintenance costs and 30% more use of fuel. The cost of chemical control alone over 15 years would have been in excess of 19 million United States dollars (USD).\n\nInvestigations have shown that it is feasible to use water hyacinth for biogas production, mulching, and animal-feed supplementation.\n\nEFFORTS TO CONTROL WATER HYACINTH — Sudan initiated efforts to combat the weed in 1959, giving responsibility for this to the Water Hyacinth Control Division under the Plant Protection Department of the Ministry of Agriculture. Priority was given to easing the constraints on navigation. The initial control strategy was chemical, using 2-4D. This cost almost 1.5 million USD annually. Sudan terminated chemical control in 1983.\n\nSudan has used physical methods but considers them expensive. Using casual and permanent labourers for manual removal costs almost 160 USD/ha, for instance, and using a prototype mechanical harvester costs almost 115 USD/ha. In nearly all cases, manual removal has not effectively controlled the weed. But using labourers does have the secondary benefit of providing employment.\n\nThe Plant Protection Department, the National Council for Research, and the University of Khartoum carried out a project using biological control. The United Kingdom Overseas Development Administration (now DFiD) partially financed this project through the Commonwealth Institute of Biological Control (later known as IIBC and now as CABI Bioscience). Two species of Neochetina weevils were released and established, together with the moth Sameodes albiguttalis (Warren), in 1978-79. Over a long time, the vigour and productivity of the water hyacinth were reduced to levels at which the weed was no longer a navigation constraint for boats and barges. The cost of biological control was 1 million USD over a 5-year period.\n\nWater hyacinth is presently considered to be under control in Sudan.\n\nWest Africa\n\nSurveys in West Africa included consultations and visits to seven countries with known water-hyacinth infestations. Nigeria is discussed in this section, as it provides a classic example of the weed problem in the region. Benin is the focus of a case-study summary.\n\nNigeria\n\nBACKGROUND — Nigeria recorded water hyacinth for the first time in 1984 in Badagry Creek. Presumably, it had spread from neighbouring Benin, where it had been reported earlier. The weed has now spread to most rivers of southern Nigeria and to Lake Kainji in Niger State (the lake is important for hydroelectricity production). The rapid spread of the weed in Nigeria is attributable to human transportation and to the interconnection of water bodies.\n\nNigeria is host to the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), which recently developed a regional project on aquatic weeds, including water hyacinth. The broad objective of the project is to protect, rehabilitate, and improve the biodiversity of water bodies in the region, with a view to conserving the environment. The project has six main components:\n\nCoordination of regional efforts to control aquatic weeds;\n\nIntegrated control of aquatic weeds on the shorelines of Benin and Nigeria;\n\nIntegrated control of aquatic weeds in the Niger River basin (also covering Benin and Nigeria);\n\nIntegrated control of aquatic weeds in the upper Niger River (covering Mali);\n\nIntegrated control of aquatic weeds in the Tano River (covering Côte d'lvoire and Ghana), and\n\nIntegrated control of aquatic weeds in the Senegal River basin (covering Senegal and Mauritania).\n\nAlthough ECOWAS emphasizes biological control, the need to coordinate physical means, such as mechanical removal, is also necessary.\n\nEFFORTS TO CONTROL WATER HYACINTH — Once water hyacinth was detected in the country, the Nigerian government formed a national committee on water hyacinth and housed it in the National Agency for Science and Engineering Infrastructure (NASENI). Through five subcommittees, the national committee is responsible for monitoring the development of the weed and implementing mechanical, chemical, and biological control, as well as investigating the weed's potential uses. Coordination of control efforts is the responsibility of NASENI, but the national committee has representations from universities, the National Institute of Horticulture (NIHORT), the Fisheries Department, and the Federal Agency for Environmental Protection. The annual work plan implemented by the national committee has a budget of only 18 000 USD, funded solely by the federal government.\n\nNigeria has preferred physical methods to control water hyacinth. These include manual removal (mainly organized at the community level) and mechanical harvesting. The manual method has been used along the shorelines of rivers and canals but appears to have been unsuccessful, and mechanical harvesting is costly.\n\nChemical control has had several trials, mostly conducted by the Institute of Ecological Studies, Obafemi Awolowo University. Of the herbicides tested, glyphosate killed the weed without toxicological effects on the fishery. Because of environmental concerns, however, the Nigerian government is not favour of chemical control. NIHORT has also used biological control. It has imported the water-hyacinth weevil Neochetina eichhorniae and released it into the Niger River since 1993. Some of the weevils released in Benin have also spread to Badagry Creek. The impact of biological control is not yet clear, but there is good weevil establishment, and monitoring and evaluation are in progress.\n\nHandling the water-hyacinth problem in Nigeria seems to be hindered mainly by a slow and time-consuming bureaucracy, poor financial support, and inefficient communication and coordination. Furthermore, the national committee on water hyacinth has been ineffective and has left out some key stakeholders.\n\nAs Nigeria shares most of its infested water bodies with neighbouring states, it has moved to solicit collaboration from these countries, as demonstrated by a recent joint proposal with Benin and with Niger.\n\nBenin\n\nBACKGROUND — Initial infestations of water hyacinth in Benin appeared in the Ouémé River in 1980-81 but reached outbreak proportions in 1985. This river produces almost 24 000 t of fish each year and provides a livelihood for about 34 360 full-time fishers, but infestations of water hyacinth threaten this livelihood.\n\nBenin has no national committee, like the one in Nigeria, to address the problem of water hyacinth or coordinate the activities of major actors in its management. Major institutes and organizations involved in water-hyacinth control in Benin include the Service de la protection des végétaux (plant protection service, SPV); the Projet de pêche lagunaire (lagoon fisheries project, PPL) of the Directorate of Fisheries, Ministry of Rural Development; the Beninese Environmental Agency; and IITA's Benin Station. The Beninese government, GTZ, and IITA (also partly supported by GTZ) provide most of the support for control of water hyacinth. Interviews in Benin by the consultants pointed to the nonexistence of a national coordination structure, although respondents acknowledged collaboration among IITA, PPL, and SPV. In most part this has occurred in connection with PPL, which has financing from the government and GTZ (under SPV) and technical support from IITA. A case study on PPL provided the present information on Benin experiences.\n\nEFFORTS TO CONTROL WATER HYACINTH — In the past 7 years, interventions in Benin have relied almost exclusively on biological control. Two weevil species were released between 1991 and 1995. Establishment of N. eichhorniae (almost 80%) was much better than that of Neochetina bruchi (almost 20%). In 1993-95, the moth S. albiguttalis was also released, but the extent of its establishment has not yet been confirmed. People in riparian communities, particularly fishers, practice manual control. However, this has been found to be counterproductive to biological-control efforts.\n\nControl efforts have had varied results. In sheltered sections of the river, where water flows slowly, the weevils establish well, and their impact on the weed is evident. However, where the waters are open, fast, and fed by tributaries (which act as nurseries of water hyacinth), control has been slow. As a consequence, there is no consensus among researchers and communities on whether biological control has been a success.\n\nThe Ouémé River project had too little funding to include an evaluation. PPL intended to terminate the project by March 1997, and SPV had no further plans for water-hyacinth control. IITA intended to maintain cultures of biological-control agents, but there was no clear indication of how monitoring and evaluation of the control program would continue.\n\nSouth Africa and Namibia\n\nThe Orange River marks the South Africa-Namibia border. At present, Namibia has had no record of water hyacinth, whereas South Africa has had infestations since the beginning of the 20th century. Discussion in this section will therefore focus on South Africa. South Africa now hosts the headquarters of the Aquatic Weeds Sector of the Southern African Development Community (SADC), a community of southern African states that was previously under the Southern African Regional Commission for the Conservation of Soil.\n\nSouth Africa\n\nBACKGROUND — Water hyacinth was first reported in Natal, South Africa, in 1910, and from there it has spread throughout South Africa. The main areas where it occurs vary from low-lying, subtropical zones to high-elevation zones where frost is common in winter. However, about 20 000 ha of the weed is found on rivers and artificial water bodies throughout the country.\n\nIn all areas of South Africa, the phenology of the weed varies during the year, with an annual period of active growth between October and March. At high elevations, frost halts the weed's growth during winter (May-August), and its growth is slow in the temperate and subtropical zones. Years of drought also have an effect on water-hyacinth infestations: when water levels are low and rivers flow slowly, the breeding and accumulation of the weed are enhanced. During such periods, water-hyacinth infestations completely block large stretches of rivers, lakes, and artificial impoundments. When floods occur, huge masses of water hyacinth and other riparian vegetation float away as large islands. Many wilted plants get stranded at the high-water mark, where they die. Small residual colonies and seeds then form the basis for the next reinfestation, which occurs with the inundation of the water bodies, although it usually takes several years for the weed to become a problem again.\n\nSouth Africa has legislation that covers water hyacinth, the Conservation of Agricultural Resources Act (Act 43, of 1983), administered by the Directorate of Resource Conservation of the National Department of Agriculture. The Act declares water hyacinth a weed that must be controlled.\n\nEFFORTS TO CONTROL WATER HYACINTH — The South African Department of Water Affairs (DWAF) has a mandate to coordinate the control of water hyacinth and to execute control measures where the weed threatens state water works. DWAF achieves this through country-wide regional offices.\n\nDWAF initiated its control of water hyacinth in 1962, although the weed had already been in the country for 50 years. Earlier efforts relied mainly on chemical control and to a lesser degree on physical means. One case of successful chemical control started in the late 1970s on the Hartbeespoort impoundment. This effort was spearheaded by DWAF and the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research. South Africa is still implementing follow-up sprays.\n\nIn another situation in the Vaal River, aerial application of herbicides was carried out between 1983 and 1985. In 1985-86, the river became reinfested, and water hyacinth blocked large stretches of the river. This influenced a decision to attempt alternative control options.\n\nIn 1974, PPRI and the Weeds Division of the Agricultural Research Council initiated biological control of water hyacinth, importing and releasing the weevil N. eichhorniae. This initial effort was suspended because of a human-resource shortage, interdepartmental policies, flooding, and extensive chemical and mechanical control. The program resumed in 1985-86, when DWAF contracted PPRI to assess the possibility of using alternative control methods. Reports of success from Australia, India, Sudan, and the United States renewed interest in biological control. During 1986-96, research confirmed that N. eichhorniae had established and spread to localities far removed from the sites where it was released in 1986–90 and 1994. The mite Orthagalumna terebrantis and the fungal pathogen Cercospora piaropi were present in the subtropical lowveld (Mpuma-langa Province) and had spread to other parts of the country where they had been absent. Two other biological-control agents, Neochetina bruchi and S. albiguttalis, were also imported and became established.\n\nPPRI focuses its current research on exploring and evaluating additional natural enemies for water hyacinth. These efforts have already led to the release and establishment of a new agent, the mirid bug Eccritotarsus catarinensis, in 1996. PPRI is collaborating with DWAF to develop a management plan for water hyacinth, integrating biological control with alternative options. Other groups implementing control in South Africa include conservation bodies, communities, and municipalities. South Africa's Water Research Commission intends to fund a collaborative study on the effect of herbicides on biological control; the study will involve PPRI and the biotechnology company Monsanto, which is interested in the problem of water hyacinth in South Africa and the rest of Africa.\n\nSouth Africa is conducting an awareness campaign to draw the attention of communities and authorities to the water-hyacinth problem. The campaign involves the production of extension materials, such as posters, and popular articles in magazines and newspapers. These are being circulated widely in the country.\n\nOver the past 10 years, owing to a growing realization of the need to collaborate and develop an integrated approach, DWAF has improved its communications with other key players in water-hyacinth control, such as PPRI and the firm Monsanto.\n\nKEY LESSONS FROM A CASE STUDY IN SOUTH AFRICA — A case study in South Africa investigated the integrated control of water hyacinth in the Enseleni-Mposa rivers, which flow through the Enseleni village and a nature reserve. The communities and the National Parks Board were involved in the program. The program mainly used biological control and physical means (floating booms); limited chemical control was also used. The program stratified the river systems into five management units and determined the choice of method based on levels of infestation and knowledge of the weed's principal nursery sites.\n\nThe study's main lesson was that communities have important roles to play in water-hyacinth control.\n\nEastern and southern Africa\n\nBackground\n\nThe eastern and southern Africa region has some of AME's oldest records of water hyacinth outside South Africa and Egypt. For instance, the weed was first reported in Zimbabwe in 1934; Mozambique, in 1946; Tanzania (Pangani River), in 1960; Ethiopia, in 1965; and Malawi (Shire River), in 1968. More recent infestations in Uganda (Lake Kyoga, 1987-88) and in some of the world's most important water bodies, such as lakes Victoria (1989-90), Malawi-Nyasa (1995), and Tanganyika (1996), indicate that the scale of the problem has worsened in the region over the past 60 years.\n\nThe consultation found reports of water-hyacinth infestation in most countries in eastern and southern Africa, with the exception of Botswana, Lesotho, and Swaziland. Although these countries were not infested, there is great concern because they are susceptible to such infestations, which would hamper water availability and use, especially in Botswana. Infestation of the Okavango Delta would definitely lead to serious socioeconomic problems. As a result, extensive publicity campaigns are being conducted to create awareness of the weed and prevent people from spreading it.\n\nIn all eastern and southern African countries, water-hyacinth infestation concerns many organizations, institutes, and communities. This calls for a coordinated effort involving all concerned sectors. The weed is a problem for fishing, agriculture, domestic water supply, navigation, and hydroelectricity generation. It is also a problem for local councils, as it affects tourism and national parks and wildlife. Water hyacinth causes enormous socioeconomic problems, the magnitude and extent of which are generally unquantified.\n\nVirtually all countries in eastern and southern Africa consider water hyacinth a problem. Countries with confirmed infestations already have organizational structures in place that could handle the problem. These include fisheries organizations, plant-protection and agricultural-research services, environmental councils and authorities, departments of national parks and wildlife, and various nongovernmental organizations. In all cases, however, the response of these organizations to the water-hyacinth issue was considered deficient.\n\nThe consultants surveyed 17 people, including researchers, policy- and decision-makers, and representatives of communities from seven countries, regarding access to information on water hyacinth. All seven countries had weed infestations or were actively involved in finding solutions to the problem. The results show that, generally, the region has information on water hyacinth, but it is not readily available to those who need it. More than two-thirds of those working on water hyacinth had access to some form of information on the weed, but less than one-third had access to electronic sources of information on water hyacinth, such as CD-ROMs. Generally, access to modern electronic methods of communication was inadequate: only one-quarter of those interviewed had access to e-mail (two-thirds had access to fax).\n\nEfforts to control water hyacinth\n\nAlthough water hyacinth is covered under Noxious Weeds Acts in various countries of eastern and southern Africa, efforts to effectively combat it have always been initiated late. In almost all cases, people in the region have taken action only after the spread of the weed has become a crisis. A fresh example is Lake Victoria, where water infestation has been going on for 7 years. Only recently did Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda — countries that share this water resource — seem to be agreeing on a coordinated effort to solve the problem. In mid-1997, the World Bank, through the Global Environment Facility (GEF) and the International Development Association, approved funding for LVEMP in these three countries. The project addresses several issues in addition to water hyacinth. To tackle the water-hyacinth problem properly, the three countries have attempted to harmonize their approaches on a whole-lake basis. They are now achieving this harmonization, but with difficulties. Supported by the GEF coalition, LVEMP has provided a forum and an opportunity to effect this coordination among the three countries. According to reports from participants in the workshop, coordination has advanced in each individual country, although in Uganda the effort has not been fully effective.\n\nAll eastern and southern African countries indicated that they had had difficulties responding to the worsening water-hyacinth situation. Reasons ranged from lack of or delays in funding, to indecisiveness among policymakers, to absence of an explicit policy, to lack of prompt recognition of the potential hazards.\n\nChemical control has been used in Zimbabwe and, to a limited extent, in Malawi but has raised environmental concerns. In July 1997 in Uganda, an environmental-impact assessment was completed and public debate conducted on the role of chemical control in combating water hyacinth. The assessment was inconclusive — more time is needed for further investigation.\n\nPhysical methods of water-hyacinth control have been variously employed in eastern and southern Africa. Uganda has used a physical barrier and mechanical harvesters at Owen Falls, but no one has yet fully evaluated their success or cost. People in the region have also used manual removal, most extensively in Uganda and Zimbabwe's Lake Chivero. Results show that limited physical removal has a role to play in clearing access to specific points in infested water bodies but may not be a long-term solution.\n\nMost eastern and southern African countries are currently implementing biological control. The water-hyacinth weevils N. eichhorniae and N. bruchi are being reared and released in most infested water bodies. The initial releases were in the early 1970s, as in the Caborra Bassa in Mozambique, and extensive releases began between the late 1980s and the 1990s in Kenya, Malawi, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. Collaborators have included ETA, CABI, and USDA, with support from USAID, CSC and DFiD, and GTZ. Successful biological control has been claimed from releases in Lake Chivero. The moth S. albiguttalis was also released recently in Malawi, Zambia, and Zimbabwe, with collaboration between national programs and PPRI (of South Africa) and CABI. The mirid bug E. catarinensis was released in Zambia and Malawi in 1996-97.\n\nLake Chivero, case study in Zimbabwe\n\nLake Chivero is near Harare in Norton, Zimbabwe. The lake (originally known as Lake Mcllwane) was built to serve as the main source of water for Harare's 2.5 million people. Located within the 2 136-km2 catchment area of the city, it receives effluent from the city, suburbs, industries, and homes. Water samples from the lake show unacceptably high levels of such minerals as nitrates and phosphates.\n\nThe following events were recorded in the Lake Chivero case study:\n\n1937Water hyacinth is reported from one of the tributaries of the Manyame River system near Harare 1952Lake Chivero is built in Norton, near Harare, to supply water to Harare (but it immediately becomes heavily polluted, because it is in the Harare catchment area) 1957Water hyacinth is reported in Lake Chivero; first use is made of 2,4-D 1960Water hyacinth is considered to be under control 1971The lake is deemed to be hypertrophic Water-hyacinth infestation is considered an outbreak Foreshores of the lake are confirmed to have bilharzia-related snails, and a national regatta is cancelled A strong campaign is conducted against 2,4-D, resulting in claims of increased frequency of abortions and possibilities of giving birth to deformed babies Mechanical harvesting is used 1985–87More than 420000 USD is spent on physical and mechanical methods to control water hyacinth and Pistia 1986Water-hyacinth infestation is considered a second outbreak 1986Glyphosate is sprayed from November on; 36 knapsack sprayers are employed 1987Glyphosate spraying is halted Mechanical harvesting with a crane is used 1988Manual removal is undertaken 1990In January, Neochetina weevils are released in five selected sites In April, establishment of Neochetina weevils is confirmed, and their spread becomes evident In August, 2,4-D and glyphosate are massively applied because water hyacinth covers 35% of the lake and exerts pressure on the dam wall and irrigation pipes Farmers indicate damage to irrigation structures caused by weed infestation 1990-94About 1.3 million USD is spent on physical removal and chemical control 1991Massive fish deaths are reported 1992In August, a site for monitoring biological control is identified following an agreement between the Ministry of Land, Agriculture and Water Development and the Ministry of Environment In November, an increase in the weevil population to 0.4 adults per plant is recorded 1996Establishment of Neochetina weevils on almost 100% of the water-hyacinth plants in Lake Chivero is confirmed Impact of biological control on the weeds becomes obvious, as sizes of mats are greatly reduced, weevil population has increased to 4-5 adults per plant, plant vigour is severely reduced, and proportion of flowering plants is down to 15% of the total weed Massive fish deaths are reported 1997Coverage of the lake by water hyacinth is reduced from 35% at its peak to less than 4%, but several explanations such as flooding and impact of the weevils are suggested Manual removal of the weed continues until July; during this process, weevils are also being removed and dumped on dry ground, negatively affecting their performance\n\nLESSONS FROM THE LAKE CHIVERO STUDY — Water hyacinth has been in Lake Chivero for four decades. Outbreak years have often coincided with drought years, during which the weed proliferates. Coverage of the lake reached a peak of 35% in the early 1990s. The weed was associated with an increased incidence of bilharzia, which led to the cancellation of the national regatta. Water hyacinth also significantly interfered with fishing and water pumping, threatened the dam wall, and caused significant damage to irrigation structures. Massive fish deaths were reported in 1991 and 1996 but could not be attributed directly to the weed because of the high levels of other pollutants flowing into the lake.\n\nSpraying water hyacinth with 2,4-D in the early 1970s generated an outcry and claims of increased abortions and deliveries of deformed babies. This shows, in the extreme, the social problems associated with the weed. There is good understanding of the range of socioeconomic and environmental problems stemming from the weed in Lake Chivero, but not of their ultimate and full consequences. However, these consequences must be understood and assessed before the direction of interventions in the fight against water hyacinth can be set.\n\nThe Lake Chivero case study highlights the need for a coordinated whole-catchment handling of the water-hyacinth problem. Control of the weed in this lake should integrate management of the entire catchment, including upstream sections of the Manyame River, which is the source of reinfestation. It also requires a well-planned awareness-raising campaign to inform stakeholders of the progress in problems and in the efforts to control them."
