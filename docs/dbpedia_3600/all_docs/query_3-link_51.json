        "text": "Luis Batlle Berres (born November 26, 1897) is a Uruguayan politician who is a member of the Colorado Party. He served as President of Uruguay from August 2, 1947 to March 1, 1951, and President of the National Council of Government from March 1, 1955 to March 1, 1956. He can once again be elected President in the 1962 elections.\n\nIn-Game Biography\n\nLeft orphan at age 11, Luis was adopted and raised by his uncle, the renowned José Batlle y Ordoñez. José ended up being a father for Luis, and the young man decided to honor his memory by entering politics and expanding on his work. It was non an easy road, first he had to flee thanks to the Terrist dictactorship. And when it seemed that Baldomir would end it, he fell and Charlone took his place. When democracy was finally restored, his cousins, jealous of Luis' popularity, managed to name him Vice President of Tomás Berreta in a bid to stop his rise. But Berreta died and Luis proved to be an independent operator. None could stop now his attempts on honoring the life of his beloved uncle. Credited by the prosperities of the 50s and the economic crash that shattered the Colorado hegemony in Uruguay, Luis always maintained that the Uruguayan people voted for the National Party in 1958 due to them being tricked or as some kind of joke, not thinking they would win. It seems that Luis can't deal with the fact that he has some responsibility on the first electoral defeat of his party in a century, a defect that could sink his third tenure, as has sunk his relationship with other batllists like Zelmar Michelini."
