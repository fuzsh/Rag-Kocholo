        "text": "Louis Armstrong’s achievements are remarkable. During his career, he:\n\nDeveloped a way of playing jazz, as an instrumentalist and a vocalist, which has had an impact on all musicians to follow.\n\nRecorded hit songs for five decades, and his music is still heard today on television and radio and in films.\n\nWrote two autobiographies, more than ten magazine articles, hundreds of pages of memoirs, and thousands of letters.\n\nWas the only Black Jazz musician to publicly speak out against school segregation in 1957.\n\nSo popular that warring sides in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in Central Africa temporarily stopped fighting in 1960 to attend an Armstrong concert.\n\nAppeared in more than thirty films (over twenty were full-length features) as a gifted actor with superb comic timing and an unabashed joy of life.\n\nComposed dozens of songs that have become jazz standards.\n\nPerformed an average of 300 concerts each year, with his frequent tours to all parts of the world earning him the nickname “Ambassador Satch,” and became one of the first great celebrities of the twentieth century.\n\nLouis as a teenager in New Orleans with his mother Mayann and sister Beatrice\n\nLouis Armstrong and His Hot Five, 1926\n\nThrough the years, Louis entertained millions, from heads of state and royalty to the kids on his stoop in Corona. Despite his fame, he remained a humble man and lived a simple life in a working-class neighborhood. To this day, everyone loves Louis Armstrong just the mention of his name makes people smile.\n\nBy the time Louis Armstrong died in 1971 he profoundly changed the culture of the world. He was born into his affability and his musical excellence, underscored by comic genius combined to make him one of the first great pop figures of the 20th century.\n\n~ Peter Watrous in the New York Times.\n\nAddress\n\nMAILING ADDRESS:\n\nThe Louis Armstrong Educational\n\nFoundation, Inc.\n\nPO Box 20681\n\nNew York, NY 10021\n\nLOCATION:\n\n10 East 40th Street - Suite 2710\n\nNew York, NY 10016\n\nLicensing\n\nThe Louis Armstrong Educational Foundation, Inc. owns the intellectual rights and trademarks to license the use of Louis Armstrong™, Satchmo™ and Wonderful World™\n\nLicensing Inquiries\n\nGeneral Inquiries\n\nFor all inquiries regarding grants, programs, projects and other opportunities for the Louis Armstrong Educational Foundation, Inc.\n\nContact Us\n\nSpecial thanks to the Louis Armstrong House Museum for their invaluable help and resources.\n\nLouis Armstrong House Museum 34-56 107 Street Corona, Queens, NY 11368 718-478-8274 Fax: 718-478-8299 www.louisarmstronghouse.org"
