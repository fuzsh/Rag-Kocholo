        "text": "I started running track as a sophomore after playing soccer for most of my youth. I had always been interested in running track and field because both of my parents ran at the collegiate level. I really enjoy running hurdle events because they are such technical races. My sophomore year, I convinced my coach to let me try the 300m hurdles. At the beginning of my junior year season I learned how to three-step and competed in some indoor meets during the winter. I plan to continue working with a coach over the summer and competing in AAU races. Hurdle events are my main focus, however I have also had lots of fun competing in my team's 4x400m relay. Although I am newer to track, I quickly found a passion for the sport. I love practicing because it gives me a chance to push myself to my limits and compete at higher and higher levels. My favorite meets to compete at are invitationals because I always know that there will be a person to catch, race, and beat. Because of this mentality I have had success placing at bigger meets in my area. My goals for my senior season are to be a Division One state qualifier and set the school record."
