Cardinal Luis Antonio Tagle, Pro-Prefect of the Dicastery for Evangelization, celebrated in Lumumbashi in recent days the concluding Mass of the National Eucharistic Congress of the Democratic Republic of Congo, the African country visited last January by Pope Francis.

"We have an appetite for the latest fashion, the newest cell phone, and the latest weapon or missile. We have fed too much on anger, jealousy, and competition. Instead, to eat the body of Christ given for us is to eat his humility, generosity, and love. To drink his blood shed for us is to drink his compassion, justice, and forgiveness. To live by the Word of God who became flesh and blood is to live as He lived, always in filial communion with God and always in fraternal communion with His brothers and sisters, especially the weakest and most forgotten," the cardinal said, according to a Fides Agency report.

"The family of God," Cardinal Tagle concluded, "is born from the Eucharist that makes us the family of God. Although we are many, although different from one another, we are one family in Jesus Christ."
