        "text": "Go Tell the Bees That...\n\nThis page may contain MAJOR SPOILERS about Ezekiel Richardson from the latest book in the Outlander series, Go Tell the Bees That I Am Gone. Read at your own peril!\n\nEzekiel Richardson is a captain in the British Army who gives Lieutenant Lord Ellesmere several intelligencing assignments. In 1778, he changes sides and officially becomes Continental Army colonel.\n\nPersonal History[]\n\nNot much is known about Richardson, beyond his involvement with the Greys and the Frasers during the war.\n\nEvents of the Novels[]\n\nAn Echo in the Bone[]\n\nIn July 1776, Lord John Grey and his stepson William talk to Captain Richardson, who gives an invitation for William to carry a message overland to Halifax to General Howe, and thence perhaps to join the general's staff.[2]\n\nIn August, William's receives a letter from Hal Grey, in which his uncle warns him that he doesn't think working for Richardson is a good idea.[3]\n\nIn September, Richardson casually offers William an out from his current situation: to accompany one Captain Randall-Isaacs to Canada, ostensibly as a French interpreter.[4]\n\nIn May 1777, Richardson requests that William do him a small favor and deliver a cipher message to a group of Loyalists in Dismal Town, Virginia.[5] William later learns that it was a trap, as Dismal Town is full of rebels.[6]\n\nIn April 1778, Richardson tells Lord John that he intends to arrest Claire Fraser for spying. Lord John marries Claire in order to protect her.[7]\n\nWritten in My Own Heart's Blood[]\n\nOn June 16, 1778, Captain Richardson meets Claire Fraser in General Clinton's headquarters in Philadelphia.[8] He then approaches William Ransom and asks him about Lord John Grey's whereabouts.[9]\n\nIn late June, Percy Beauchamp warns Lord John that Richardson is an American spy, targeting Grey and his brother Hal.[10] Hal informs Grey that Richardson seems to have deserted from the British army.[11]\n\nOn December 22, Richardson—now a Continental Army colonel—and Major General Robert Howe visit Jamie Fraser in Savannah, asking him to go back to active service. Fraser declines, to their outrage.[12]\n\nSeveral days later, Richardson approaches Claire and admits that he had been spying for the Americans and planned to make Claire his asset—he reveals that he pushed Lord John into marrying her, and as a result, she was uniquely placed to spy on Grey. He also discloses his intentions regarding Hal Grey.[13]\n\nGo Tell the Bees That I Am Gone[]\n\nPersonality[]\n\nNote: This section is a stub. You can help Outlander Wiki by expanding it.\n\nPhysical Appearance[]\n\nAn everyman, he blends in and is unremarkable. Claire recognizes him by a mole on the side of his chin.\n\nName[]\n\nEzekiel is from the Hebrew name יְחֶזְקֵאל (Yechezqel) meaning \"God strengthens\".[14]\n\nRichardson means \"son of Richard\",[15] Richard meaning \"brave power\", derived from the Germanic elements ric \"power, rule\" and hard \"brave, hardy\".[16]\n\nTrivia[]"
