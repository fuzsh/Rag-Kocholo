        "text": "The pancreas is a leaf shaped organ tucked under the liver, close to the gallbladder, stomach and bowel.\n\nIt is part of both the digestive and endocrine systems.\n\nThe pancreas lies across your body just behind your stomach. It is about 15 centimetres long.\n\nThe pancreas has three parts.\n\nThe wide end is called the head.\n\nThe middle is called the body.\n\nThe thin end is called the tail.\n\nThe pancreas is a large gland. It makes hormones which regulate the level of sugar in your blood. One of these hormones is Insulin. This is the endocrine function of the pancreas.\n\nThe pancreas also makes digestive juices\n\nThe juices flow down a tube called the pancreatic duct into the first part of the small bowel.\n\nThe bile duct joins the small bowel right next to the pancreatic duct.\n\nThe place where the 2 ducts join and meet the bowel is called the ampulla of Vater.\n\nDigestive juices contain enzymes that help you to break down food in the bowel.\n\nThis is called the exocrine function of the pancreas.\n\nCancer that starts in the cells that make digestive juices is called exocrine pancreatic cancer. This is the most common type of pancreatic cancer.\n\nCancers that start in the cells that make insulin and other hormones, are called endocrine pancreatic cancers or Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumours.\n\nClose to the pancreas there are lymph nodes that are part of our immune system and help us fight infections.\n\nLymph nodes are often the first place cancer cells reach when they break away from a tumour.\n\nFor information about pancreatic cancer go to cruk.org/cancer-types"
