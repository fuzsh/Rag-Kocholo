        "text": "Froedtert & the Medical College of Wisconsin treats a wide variety of stomach diseases and disorders.\n\nDyspepsia\n\nDyspepsia is a functional disorder of the stomach involving symptoms such as upper abdominal pain, bloating, a feeling of fullness (with little intake of food), nausea or belching. Symptoms are often provoked by eating. Many people who have dyspepsia may also have irritable bowel syndrome.\n\nCyclical Vomiting Syndrome\n\nCyclic Vomiting Syndrome is a condition involving recurrent, prolonged episodes of severe nausea and vomiting with no apparent cause, with normal periods of health in between.\n\nGastroparesis (Stomach Paralysis)\n\nStomach Paralysis is a disorder in which the stomach is unable to contract normally; due to this condition, it either, moves food slowly into the small intestine, or no longer moves food into the small intestine. This occurs when nerves to the stomach are damaged or stop working. People with autoimmune nervous system dysfunction or diabetes may experience this disorder.\n\nGastritis\n\nGastritis is an inflammation of the lining of the stomach (may be acute or chronic). It can have many causes, including prolonged use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications (NSAIDs) such as aspirin or ibuprofen, H. pylori infection or alcohol abuse.\n\nSymptoms include abdominal pain, belching, bloating, nausea, vomiting and a feeling of fullness or burning.\n\nEndoscopy is used to view the stomach lining to check for inflammation and possibly remove a tissue sample for testing.\n\nUlcers\n\nA Ulcer is an open sore on the lining of the stomach (gastric ulcer) or duodenum (duodenal ulcer). Peptic ulcers occur in areas that come in contact with digestive juices from the stomach. They may be caused or worsened by:\n\nProlonged use of over-the-counter, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications (NSAIDs) such as aspirin or ibuprofen\n\nBacterial infection (H. pylori). (H. pylori infection is usually acquired from contaminated food and water and through person to person spread.)\n\nStomach Tumors\n\nTumors (benign or malignant) that form in the lining of the stomach. Symptoms may include bleeding, obstruction and weight loss.\n\nGastric outlet obstruction is a tumor obstructs the channel through which the stomach empties and thus prevents the normal emptying of the stomach.\n\nHiatal hernia occurs when the upper part of the stomach protrudes into the chest through a tear or weakness in the diaphragm.\n\nLymphoma â€” MALT (mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue) is a type of lymphoma (cancer that arises from the lymph tissue) found in the stomach. H. pylori bacterium are believed to be involved in causing MALT lymphoma. (H. pylori infection is usually acquired from contaminated food and water and through person to person spread.) Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS), along with other procedures, may be used to view the size and depth of the tumor. Treatment may include the use of antibiotics to wipe out the bacteria or radiation therapy.\n\nStomach cancer, also known as gastric cancer.\n\nVaricose Veins in the Stomach or Esophagus\n\nVaricose veins are blood vessels that bulge and twist due to a defect in the valves. Varicose veins may be present in the esophagus or stomach as a result of liver disease or blood clots in the portal vein system. Large varicose veins in the esophagus or stomach can rupture and bleed."
