        "text": "We all have stomachaches, upset stomach, and abdominal pain from time to time, and they’re usually not serious. But they can be a sign that something inside your body is not functioning the way it should – especially if you have severe stomach pain or sharp stomach pain. Causes can be anything from gas or a pulled muscle to something as serious as an internal infection or heart attack. If you get stomachaches or upset stomach often, or they hurt a lot or don’t go away, you may need to see a doctor.\n\nSymptoms associated with abdominal pain\n\nCall your doctor if you have severe stomach pain, sharp stomach pain, if your stomach pain does not improve in 24 to 48 hours or if you also have:\n\nChest pain (get prompt medical attention)\n\nBloating or swelling that lasts more than a few days\n\nAn injury or recent accident\n\nBloody or dark stools\n\nVomiting blood or dark material\n\nChanges in bowel habits\n\nUnexpected weight loss\n\nDifficulty swallowing\n\nDiarrhea for more than five days\n\nProlonged vaginal bleeding\n\nFever over 100 degrees\n\nBurning sensation when you urinate or frequent urination\n\nAny of these additional conditions could indicate a more serious underlying cause that requires medical treatment.\n\nCommon causes of abdominal pain and upset stomach\n\nThe most common causes of abdominal pain or upset stomach can be classified into three general categories: digestive problems, inflammation and female reproduction.\n\nDigestive problems: If you experience abdominal pain after you eat, you may have indigestion, constipation, diarrhea, food allergies or food poisoning.\n\nInflammation: Painful irritation or infection in your organs can be caused by inflammation from the stomach flu, a peptic ulcer, GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease), gallstones, pancreatitis or a urinary tract infection.\n\nFemale reproduction: Female abdonimal pain related to the reproductive cycle could be from menstrual cramps, ovulation or inflammation in the reproductive organs.\n\nAbdominal pain diagnosis\n\nYour doctor will perform a thorough physical exam and ask you to describe your symptoms and medical history. There are many different kinds of stomach pains, and your doctor may ask if it's mild or severe, burning or achy, dull or sharp, crampy or colicky, in one spot or all over, constant or in waves. All this information will help your doctor find the cause of your pain and determine what to do about it.\n\nThe location of your pain, such as upper or lower abdominal pain as described below, also gives your doctor clues for diagnosing the possible cause.\n\nGeneral: Appendicitis, urinary tract infection, Crohn's disease or irritable bowel syndrome\n\nUpper abdomen: GERD, gallstones, pancreatitis or heart attack\n\nMiddle abdomen: Pancreatitis, appendicitis, intestinal blockage or thoracic aortic aneurysm\n\nLower abdomen: Lower abdominal pain can be a result of diverticulitis, appendicitis, ectopic pregnancy or inflammation of the fallopian tubes (salpingitis)\n\nUpper left abdomen: Shingles, spleen infection, heart attack or hiatal hernia\n\nLower left abdomen: Crohn’s disease, diverticulitis, ulcerative colitis or kidney stone disease\n\nUpper right abdomen: Cholangitis (inflammation of the bile duct), hepatitis, fecal impaction (hardened stools) or peptic ulcer\n\nLower right abdomen pain: Cholecystitis (inflammation of the gallbladder), ovarian cysts, appendicitis or stomach flu\n\nTests for abdominal pain\n\nYour doctor may order urine, blood and stool tests. Imaging tests are also helpful for detecting abnormalities inside your digestive system and other organs. These tests may include X-rays, CT scan, ultrasound, double-contrast barium enema or endoscopy.\n\nAbdominal pain treatment\n\nDepending on the cause of your abdominal pain, your doctor may prescribe medications.\n\nOver-the-counter medications for stomach pain\n\nMedications with simethicone: Gas pain or bloating\n\nAntacids and acid-reducing medications: Belching, stomach fullness or acid reflux\n\nLaxatives or stool softeners: Bloating from constipation\n\nAvoid nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) because they can irritate the stomach.\n\nPrescription medications for stomach pain\n\nSome conditions also may benefit from prescription medication.\n\nSteroids: Reduce pain and inflammation from conditions like Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis\n\nProton pump inhibitors: Disorders that are worsened by stomach acid like ulcers and gastroesophageal reflux\n\nAntibiotics: Bacterial conditions or ulcers related to H. pylori\n\nSurgery for stomach pain\n\nIf testing shows your pain is related to gastrointestinal conditions such as gallstones, kidney stones, duct or intestinal blockage or appendicitis, you may need surgery. Female abdominal pain related to reproductive issues such as ovarian cysts, uterine fibroids or blocked fallopian tubes may also require surgery.\n\nWays to prevent stomach pain\n\nSome stomach pains are unavoidable because they can be a symptom of a serious medical condition that’s developed over time. But when that’s not the case, and you know your pain is related to eating or physical activity, you can take steps to prevent it in the future.\n\nChange your eating habits\n\nEat more slowly\n\nTake smaller bites\n\nHave several small meals throughout the day instead of one or two large meals\n\nAvoid eating things that upset your stomach such as spicy foods, dairy products or foods that cause gas\n\nDrink plenty of clear fluids, especially if you’re prone to urinary tract infections, constipation or kidney stones\n\nUse good judgment when you exercise"
