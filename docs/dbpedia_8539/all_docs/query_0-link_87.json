        "text": "The stomach’s purpose is to store, break down, and produce enzymes to digest food. It is a complex organ that is interconnected with the gastrointestinal tract. The stomach muscles work in concert with the rest of the upper tract of the system to push food through to the small intestine. Sometimes, conditions affecting the thickness of the stomach wall can interfere with digestion and health. Is stomach wall thickening serious? The answer depends.\n\nIs Stomach Wall Thickening Serious?\n\nThe seriousness of stomach or gastric wall thickening depends on a multitude of factors, primarily the affecting condition. Wall thickening is almost always a symptom of some other condition, and diagnosing the underlying cause is tricky because it can stem from numerous benign and malignant disorders.\n\nObviously, many patients worry about cancer, but this is not the only possible diagnosis. Patients should first consult their primary care physicians to discuss digestive health concerns and complete a round of tests, including a CT scan, to diagnose gastric wall thickening. With an official diagnosis, medical professionals can conduct other tests to determine the cause of the symptom and its relative seriousness or severity. They may also schedule surgery if the results are cancerous.\n\nOther likely and benign causes include gastritis, Crohn’s, Menetrier’s, and peptic ulcer disease. Some of these health conditions may increase the likelihood or risks of cancer, but they are not the same or terminal.\n\nThe Appearance of Wall Thickening on CT Scans\n\nA computerized tomography scan combines several X-ray images to produce an internal image of the body. The scan allows doctors to examine internal organs and structures without invasive or exploratory procedures.\n\nCT scans are the primary imaging tests for diagnosing gastric wall thickening, but patients should understand the commonality and range of gastric wall thickness. Some studies imply that the average thickness is below 5 mm, but conflicting reports suggest an average measurement could be as thick as 12 mm or just over 1 cm.\n\nBecause of the variance in “normal” thickness standards, the common appearance of stomach wall thickening on imaging, and possible differential diagnoses, CT scans on their own are poor tests for determining malignancy. Indications of cancer become more apparent the thicker the stomach wall is or with the presence of a focal, eccentric, or enhancing wall.\n\nIf a CT scan shows gastric wall thickening with no apparent signs of the underlying cause, a doctor may order an upper endoscopy. The EGD is the primary test for gastric or stomach cancer diagnoses. Patients receive a sedative before a gastroenterologist inserts the endoscope into the mouth and guides it to the stomach.\n\nThe Indications and Consequences of a Thickened Stomach Wall\n\nWhen trying to understand to what degree is stomach wall thickening serious, it is crucial to examine the underlying issues and symptoms. Typical symptoms that accompany gastric wall thickening include:\n\nWeight loss\n\nDiarrhea\n\nNausea\n\nVomiting\n\nPossible abdominal bleeding\n\nThese symptoms may be part of other conditions, such as gastritis and Menetrier disease (a type of chronic gastritis). In and of themselves, benign or noncancerous causes are not terminal. Still, some symptoms can become life-threatening when left without proper medical treatment.\n\nThe Signs of Malignancy\n\nStomach wall thickening is a symptom of stomach cancer. The most common form of stomach cancer is adenocarcinoma.\n\nLinitis plastica is a rarer form of stomach cancer in the adenocarcinoma sub-group. This rare cancer spreads within the stomach lining to the muscles, making the stomach wall thick and rigid. The rigidity of the stomach means it cannot expand as much to accommodate food and cannot contract or move as much to aid digestion.\n\nAlong with gastric wall thickening, there are other symptoms of stomach cancer that may not appear immediately. As the disease progresses, patients may experience:\n\nIndigestion\n\nLoss of appetite\n\nUnexplained weight loss\n\nAnemia (tiredness due to low red blood cell levels)\n\nStomach tenderness or pain\n\nSymptoms of stomach cancer can mirror symptoms of other conditions, including ulcers. Also, some symptoms are not always apparent to patients; for instance, some people may not experience the symptoms of anemia. They may only know about an issue after medical tests reveal it.\n\nCancer is only one possible explanation for stomach wall thickening, and this diagnosis requires testing and medical expertise. Patients who have observed possible cancer symptoms should consult their primary care physician to schedule appropriate tests.\n\nThe Implications of Gastritis on Stomach Cancer\n\nGastritis, specifically atrophic gastritis, can increase the risk of a patient developing stomach or gastric cancer. While stomach wall thickening is a symptom of atrophic gastritis, the condition primarily results from an H. pylori infection. The infection can lead to inflammation that may damage stomach cells.\n\nAn autoimmune reaction can also result from gastritis. The immune system may attack the stomach lining and cause pernicious anemia. Both issues, the infection and autoimmune response, can signify pre-cancerous changes.\n\nIt is not yet clear how such changes may affect risk factors for stomach cancer. Some research suggests H. pylori bacteria may convert food substances into DNA-changing chemicals that affect the stomach lining.\n\nDNA damage and genetic mutations increase the risk of cancer. A person may inherit mutations, but such inheritances only account for a minor percentage of stomach cancers.\n\nAcquired mutations occur after birth and may stem from external factors, such as an H. pylori infection, or random events with no outside cause. Therefore, while gastritis may increase risks for stomach cancer, it does not definitively cause the illness.\n\nIs Stomach Wall Thickening Serious?\n\nStomach wall thickness can vary from person to person, and it can stem from various conditions, both malignant and benign. Still, is stomach wall thickening serious? The answer depends on several factors, including genetics and individual biology.\n\nIf you are experiencing symptoms of gastric wall thickness, contact Arizona Premier Surgery to discuss testing and treatment options. Schedule a consultation to discuss your case and determine the next steps toward an official diagnosis. While cancer can seem like a scary outcome, remember that many factors can contribute to stomach wall thickening.\n\nSources:\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5579915/\n\nhttps://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/stomach-cancer/causes-risks-prevention/what-causes.html\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6886315/\n\nhttps://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/stomach-cancer/getting-diagnosed/types-and-grades/linitis-plastica-of-the-stomach"
