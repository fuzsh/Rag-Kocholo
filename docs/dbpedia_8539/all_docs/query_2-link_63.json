        "text": "Stress, worry and anxiety can take a toll on your stomach.\n\nJust think back to how you felt the last time you went on a job interview, got pulled over for speeding or had to perform or give a public speech. Those butterflies in your belly were hard to ignore.\n\n\"The enteric nervous system, a collection of neurons in the gastrointestinal tract, makes up your gut's brain,\" says Dr. Muhammad Talha Farooqui, a gastroenterologist at Houston Methodist. \"The entire system is very sensitive to moods â€” and stress can be a major contributor to many digestive problems.\"\n\nWhat can stress do to your stomach?\n\nThe most common way stress affects the stomach is by worsening the symptoms of a digestive condition you may already have.\n\nHere are three examples:\n\n1. Heartburn\n\nHeartburn is a burning or pain behind your breastbone. It occurs when the muscle between your esophagus and stomach opens up, allowing stomach acid to travel upwards into your esophagus.\n\n\"Stress can slow down digestion, keeping food in your stomach longer, which can be a trigger for heartburn,\" explains Dr. Farooqui.\n\n2. Indigestion\n\nEver experienced bloating, nausea, belching, gas and diarrhea after eating a meal?\n\nIt could be indigestion, which is most often caused by\n\nEating too much or eating too fast\n\nConsuming high-fat foods\n\nEating during stressful situations\n\n\"Indigestion can come and go depending on your stress level,\" Dr. Farooqui adds.\n\n3. Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)\n\nIBS is an intestinal disorder that's often marked by:\n\nCramping\n\nGas\n\nBloating\n\nDiarrhea or constipation\n\nSome IBS sufferers find that stress causes flare-ups.\n\nHow to relieve stomach pain from stress\n\nYou can't always avoid stress, but you can manage it and help ease your stomach woes.\n\nSome key strategies include:\n\nExercise. Regular activity helps reduce stress, control weight, regulate bowel function and improve your overall well-being. Just make sure to exercise before eating or wait at least one hour after a meal. (Related: Am I Exercising Enough?)\n\nRelaxation and breathing techniques. Yoga, meditation or just taking slow, rhythmic breaths can lessen stress and, in turn, cramps and pain.\n\nBiofeedback. This mind-over-matter technique helps you learn to control over certain body functions, including gastrointestinal functions, and bring them back to normal. Biofeedback also helps reduce muscle tension and slow heart rate, promoting a relaxed state.\n\nCan stress cause stomach pain that won't go away?\n\nMost everyone has occasional stomach issues, but experts say it's important not to overlook lingering or recurring digestive problems even if you think stress could be the culprit."
