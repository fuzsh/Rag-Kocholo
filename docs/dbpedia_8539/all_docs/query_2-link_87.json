New all oral combination treatment has greatly improved health outcomes for people with hepatitis C.\n\nIf your baby is full-term and healthy, mild jaundice is nothing to worry about and will resolve by itself within a week or so.\n\nThe damage caused by fatty liver disease can often be halted or reversed through simple lifestyle changes.\n\nLiver cancer can be a primary cancer that starts in the liver, or a secondary cancer that starts in another part of the body and spreads to the liver.\n\nIn Australia, hepatitis C is most often spread through the sharing of unsterile drug injecting equipment. New all oral combination treatment has greatly improved health outcomes for people with hepatitis C. It may also help prevent hepatitis C transmission to other people.\n\nPrimary biliary cirrhosis is an autoimmune condition characterised by inflammation and scarring of the bile ducts within the liver.\n\nSymptoms of Barrett's oesophagus are similar to regular heartburn, which means many people don't seek treatment until their condition is quite advanced.\n\nToo much amniotic fluid surrounding the baby during pregnancy (polyhydramnios) may indicate the presence of defects of the digestive tract.\n\nHiccups that last for days, weeks or even years may be symptomatic of underlying disease.\n\nFood inside the stomach is only kept there by the force of gravity so to avoid heartburn, don't lie down after a big meal.\n\nReflux is common in babies and causes no pain or problems with weight gain in most babies.\n\nDiabetes and the build-up of glucose (sugar) in the blood can cause serious complications if left untreated.\n\nType 1 diabetes can affect anyone of any age, but is more common in people under 30 years.\n\nPancreatitis is inflammation of the pancreas, which can be either acute or chronic\n\nAround half of cases of anal fissures heal by themselves with proper self-care and avoidance of constipation.\n\nRectal prolapse occurs when the rectum turns itself inside out and comes out through the anus.\n\nWhen people with inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis) are not experiencing a flare-up of their illness, they feel quite well and are often free of symptoms.\n\nMost people infected with Giardia parasites do not develop symptoms but can still spread the infection to others.\n\nYou may be more prone to salmonellosis if you are elderly, have another medical condition (such as a weakened immune system) or are malnourished.\n\nOutbreaks of shigella gastroenteritis can occur in institutional settings, particularly where children are still in nappies or adults are incontinent.\n\nGastroenteritis is common in young children and spreads easily.
