        "text": "Category: Healthy Living, Frederick Health Services, Frederick Health Medical Group, Healthy Eating, Healthy Diet\n\nPosted On: Jul 29, 2021\n\nWritten By: Frederick Health\n\nIf you have digestive issues, you’re not alone. Each year, nearly 70 million Americans are affected by digestive diseases, from irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) to gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).\n\nMany factors affect your gut health, like your family and genetic history and how your body is built. There are also factors you can control, like stress and diet. When your gut functions properly, there’s a good balance of bacteria helping your body process and get energy from the foods you eat, clear toxins, fight against disease, and boost your mood. You’re also free of symptoms like diarrhea, constipation, loose stools, gas, bloating, and abdominal pain.\n\nHere are 10 warning signs you may have an unhealthy gut.\n\nYou have an upset stomach. Frequent discomfort, gas, bloating, constipation, diarrhea, and heartburn could be signs that your gut is having a hard time processing food and eliminating waste.\n\nYou feel tired more often than not. People with chronic fatigue may have imbalances in the gut. One study found that almost half of people with fatigue also had IBS.\n\nYou have trouble sleeping in general. An unhealthy gut can cause insomnia or poor sleep, which leads to fatigue. The majority of your body’s serotonin, which affects mood and sleep, is produced in the gut. So, when there’s bacteria or inflammation in the gut, your sleep may be affected as well.\n\nYou are intolerant to some foods. Food intolerances may be caused by poor quality of bacteria in the gut. You may have a food intolerance if you struggle to digest certain foods. This can cause bloating, gas, diarrhea, nausea, and abdominal pain.\n\nYou have extreme food cravings, especially sugar. Eating too much sugar can cause too much “bad” bacteria in the gut. High amounts of sugar, especially high-fructose corn syrup, are linked to inflammation in the body and puts you at risk for other diseases.\n\nYou have unintentional weight gain or loss. When your gut is imbalanced, your body may struggle to absorb nutrients, store fat, and regulate blood sugar. Weight loss or gain may be caused by bacteria overgrowth or lack of nutrients.\n\nYou have skin irritations. Some skin conditions like acne, eczema, and psoriasis may be related to gut issues.\n\nYou get migraines. There may be a link between headaches and gut health, especially if you experience nausea or vomiting with migraines. Studies suggest that people with frequent headaches are more likely to have gastrointestinal disorders too.\n\nYou have autoimmune problems. Some “bad” gut bacteria may trigger autoimmune conditions like thyroid issues, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, and type 1 diabetes.\n\nYou have frequent mood changes. Gut problems and inflammation in the nervous system can lead to anxiety and depression.\n\nSo, how do you balance your gut health?\n\nAdd probiotics to your diet. Probiotics promote the growth of healthy bacteria in the gut. You can take these in vitamin form or, preferably, from natural sources like yogurt, kefir, kombucha, and kimchi.\n\nLimit processed foods and sugar. Instead, get nutrients from plant-based foods and lean proteins. A diet high in fiber can promote a healthy gut.\n\nEat slowly. Chew thoroughly and eat slowly to fully digest your food and help your body absorb all its nutrients.\n\nEliminate food intolerances. If certain foods always cause cramping, nausea, or acid reflux, you may have a food intolerance. Try an elimination diet to determine your trigger foods, then remove them from your diet completely. If you need help, consider Nutrition Counseling at Frederick Health.\n\nDrink water. You’ve heard it before, but staying hydrated really does improve your body’s overall health. Drinking water aids with digestion.\n\nHave a grocery game plan. Avoid the center aisles with processed foods and refined sugars and stay around the outside of the grocery store. Choose healthy, fresh fruits and vegetables.\n\nExercise regularly. Moving your body improves the healthy microbes in your body, keeps your bowel movements regular, and prevents disease while improving your overall health.\n\nGet enough sleep. Aim for 7-8 hours each night. Proper sleep helps to balance your hormones and prevent many scenarios that can negatively impact your digestive health, like stress or eating too close to bedtime.\n\nReduce stress. Some studies show that people who have early life stress more likely to develop IBS. Finding ways to manage your stress can help manage your gut, too.\n\nAvoid or quit smoking. Smoking can harm your digestive system in many ways—from heartburn and ulcers to liver disease and cancer. If you smoke, try to quit. Get medical help if you need it.\n\nTalk to your doctor. There’s no better time or place than the doctor’s office to talk about gut health. Tell your doctor about your symptoms, pain rating, recent changes, and health goals.\n\nYour annual check-up is a great time to check up on your gut health. You can request a Primary Care appointment online to connect with a Frederick Health provider. For Nutrition Counseling and other dietary-related concerns, contact our Nutrition & Weight Management team.
