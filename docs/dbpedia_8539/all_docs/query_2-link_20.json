        "text": "The digestive system includes the gastrointestinal (GI) tract that runs from the mouth to the anus, the liver, pancreas, and gallbladder. These organs work together to digest (break down) food into individual nutrients to be used throughout the body for energy, growth, and cell repair.\n\nA digestive disease disrupts digestion in one way or another, causing health problems that range from mild to serious. This may include something as common as acid reflux to celiac disease or cancer.\n\nThis article discusses common diseases of the GI tract and when they might be considered serious. It reviews the risks of an untreated digestive condition and what to eat if you have a digestive problem.\n\nTypes of Digestive System Diseases\n\nMany different diseases affect the digestive tract. Some conditions are acute (coming on suddenly and lasting only a short time), while others are chronic (lasting a long time). Symptoms may vary from day to day or come and go.\n\nBeing aware of your symptoms, when they occur, for how long, and if they are more severe after eating certain foods or performing certain activities can help in identifying the correct cause of your digestive issues.\n\nGastroenteritis\n\nGastroenteritis, commonly called the stomach flu, is not influenza but an infection of your gastrointestinal tract caused by viruses, bacteria, parasites, or chemicals. Gastroenteritis caused by a virus is called viral gastroenteritis.\n\nMany viruses can be spread from person to person and cause infections. Some common viruses that can cause gastroenteritis include norovirus, rotavirus, adenovirus, and astrovirus.\n\nSymptoms of gastroenteritis usually include:\n\nDiarrhea\n\nAbdominal pain or cramping\n\nNausea\n\nVomiting\n\nFever\n\nFatigue\n\nViral gastroenteritis tends to be acute, usually lasting less than a week. Most people get better on their own without medical treatment. However, more serious cases can lead to dehydration and may require medical treatment.\n\nCeliac Disease\n\nCeliac disease is a chronic digestive autoimmune disorder that causes damage to the small intestine. In this condition, the immune system reacts to gluten consumed in foods or beverages. Gluten is a protein found naturally in wheat, barley, and rye. It is commonly found in foods such as bread, pasta, cookies, and cakes but can also be found in other foods, beverages, and products.\n\nThe main treatment for celiac disease is following a gluten-free diet. Learning to read ingredient lists, as well as knowing the different grains and food products that contain gluten, is important to help in staying gluten-free and preventing damage to the small intestine.\n\nSymptoms of celiac disease may include:\n\nAbdominal bloating\n\nAbdominal pain or cramping\n\nDiarrhea\n\nConstipation\n\nGas\n\nNausea or vomiting\n\nLactose intolerance due to damage to the small intestine\n\nGreasy, foul-smelling stools\n\nResearch suggests that celiac disease occurs in people who have certain genes. A person is more likely to develop celiac disease if a family member also has the condition. In the United States, celiac disease is more commonly diagnosed among White people compared to other racial or ethnic groups. Celiac disease is more common in females than in males.\n\n(Note that when research or health authorities are cited, the terms for sex or gender from the source are used.)\n\nConstipation and Diarrhea\n\nConstipation and diarrhea are common GI issues. Both are often symptoms of other digestive system problems and can greatly impact quality of life.\n\nConstipation is a condition in which bowel movements are reduced, and you have fewer than three a week. Other symptoms include hard, dry, or lumpy stools that are difficult or painful to pass or a feeling that all the stool has passed.\n\nCauses of constipation include certain medical conditions (especially those that affect the digestive system), changes in physical activity or diet, pregnancy, side effects of medications, and more.\n\nDiarrhea is the opposite problem, in which you have more frequent stools, occurring three or more times a day. Stools may be loose and watery.\n\nCauses of diarrhea include digestive tract problems, food allergies and food intolerances, infections, and side effects of medicines.\n\nIrritable Bowel Syndrome\n\nIrritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a chronic condition that affects the large intestine (colon). In the United States, it’s estimated that about 12% of people have IBS.\n\nIBS comprises a group of symptoms that occur together, including:\n\nAbdominal pain and cramping\n\nAbdominal bloating\n\nGas\n\nDiarrhea\n\nConstipation\n\nThe three subtypes of IBS, depending on the dominant symptom, are:\n\nIBS with constipation (IBS-C)\n\nIBS with diarrhea (IBS-D)\n\nIBS with mixed bowel habits (IBS-M)\n\nWith IBS, symptoms occur without any visible signs of physical damage or disease in the digestive tract. However, symptoms can still greatly impact quality of life.\n\nInflammatory Bowel Disease\n\nInflammatory bowel disease (IBD) includes conditions in which there is chronic inflammation of the GI tract. The two main conditions in IBD are Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis (UC).\n\nThe exact cause of IBD is unknown, but researchers think it is the result of genetics and a dysregulated immune system. A dysregulated immune system causes an imbalance among the inflammatory cytokines (inflammatory protein seen in the inflammatory process).\n\nCrohn’s disease can affect any part of the digestive tract, whereas UC only affects the large intestine and the rectum. Both can cause damage to the lining of the digestive tract. However, in Crohn’s disease, the damaged areas are usually patchy, and in UC the damage is continuous.\n\nSymptoms of IBD include:\n\nAbdominal pain\n\nChronic diarrhea\n\nBlood in the stool\n\nMucus in the stool\n\nStool urgency\n\nUnintentional weight loss\n\nFatigue\n\nColitis\n\nColitis is inflammation of the colon. Sometimes the cause is unknown, or it may be caused by viral and bacterial infections, medications, Crohn's disease, UC, lack of blood flow, pseudomembranous colitis (bacteria causing inflammation of the colon), or necrotizing enterocolitis (serious intestinal disease) in newborns.\n\nThere are different types of colitis, including Inflammatory (such as in IBD), microscopic (causes chronic watery diarrhea), pseudomembranous (colon inflammation caused by bacterial overgrowth), ischemic (blood flow is restricted or reduced), and allergic colitis (which usually occurs in infants).\n\nSymptoms of colitis include:\n\nAbdominal pain\n\nAbdominal bloating\n\nDark stools, or blood in the stool\n\nContinual feeling of needing to have a bowel movement (tenesmus)\n\nDehydration\n\nDiarrhea\n\nFever\n\nDiverticular Disease\n\nDiverticular disease includes two conditions—diverticulosis and diverticulitis. Diverticulosis is when small pouches, called diverticula, form in weak spots along the wall of the colon. Usually, the diverticula do not cause symptoms. Diverticula can bleed in some people and cause hematochezia (bright red blood passing through the rectum). And sometimes, the diverticula can become inflamed/infected (diverticulitis).\n\nSymptoms of diverticulitis include:\n\nAbdominal pain (most commonly in the lower left side)\n\nNausea\n\nVomiting\n\nConstipation\n\nDiarrhea\n\nFevers and chills\n\nDiverticulosis is a fairly common condition in the United States. It’s estimated that over 30% of adults between the ages of 50 and 59 and over 70% of those 80 and older have it. However, less than 5% of people with diverticulosis go on to develop the more complicated diverticulitis.\n\nAcid Reflux\n\nAcid reflux is a common term for gastroesophageal reflux (GER). GER is sometimes called heartburn, reflux, acid indigestion, and acid regurgitation.\n\nGER happens when the stomach contents come back up into your esophagus (food pipe). Many people experience GER now and then. It can occur without causing any symptoms, or, in some cases, it can cause indigestion or a mild burning sensation in the chest.\n\nGastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is when GER symptoms become more chronic and severe. In the United States, about 20% of people have GERD.\n\nUntreated GERD can cause more serious complications, such as:\n\nEsophagitis (inflammation of the esophagus)\n\nEsophageal stricture (when the esophagus becomes too narrow)\n\nBarrett’s esophagus (when the tissue of the esophagus becomes salmon colored as a result of changes in the lining of the esophagus cells to look like intestinal cells): Barrett's esophagus increases risk of esophageal cancer.\n\nSymptoms of GERD may include:\n\nHeartburn or indigestion\n\nChest pain\n\nNausea\n\nDifficulty or pain when swallowing\n\nChronic cough\n\nHoarseness of the voice\n\nRectal and Anal Problems\n\nThere are several conditions that can affect the rectum and anus, which are at the end of the digestive tract after the colon. These include:\n\nAnal fissure: This is a small rip or tear in the lining of the anal canal that connects the rectum to the anus. Symptoms include sharp pain from passing stool, bright red blood on the stool, and a small lump or skin tag near the rip or tear.\n\nAnal fistula: This is an abnormal tunnel under the skin that connects the anal canal in the colon to an opening on the skin around the anus. Most anal fistulas are formed as a result of an anal gland that has become infected. Symptoms of anal fistulas include pain, redness, itching, and swelling of the anus. There may also be fever, chills, fatigue, and pus drainage.\n\nHemorrhoids: Also called piles, hemorrhoids are inflamed and enlarged veins around the anus or lower rectum. Hemorrhoids may be external (on the skin around the anus) or internal (on the lining of the anus and lower rectum). Symptoms for external hemorrhoids include anal itching, hard, sensitive lumps near the anus, and pain near the anus when sitting. Internal hemorrhoids can cause rectal bleeding, and sometimes a prolapse (when a hemorrhoid has fallen through the anal opening). Prolapses may cause pain and discomfort.\n\nProctitis: Proctitis is inflammation of the lining of the rectum. There are different types of proctitis, including proctitis in IBD, infectious proctitis (occurring from certain infections, including some sexually transmitted infections (STIs), radiation proctitis (occurring after receiving radiation therapy in the pelvic area), and diversion proctitis (occurring after having a bowel diversion performed, also called an ostomy of the bowel). Symptoms of proctitis include tenesmus, diarrhea, constipation, pain in the anus, rectum, and lower abdomen, rectal bleeding, and passing mucus or pus with bowel movements.\n\nRectal prolapse: A rectal prolapse is a condition in which the rectum becomes stretched out and slides out, protruding from the anus. Women age 50 and older are 6 times more likely to have a rectal prolapse than men. Symptoms of rectal prolapse include rectal bleeding, tissue bulging from the rectum, and fecal incontinence (not being able to manage bowel movements).\n\nPeptic Ulcers\n\nA peptic ulcer, or stomach or duodenal ulcer, is a sore on the lining of your stomach or duodenum (the first part of the small intestine). It is sometimes called peptic ulcer disease. In the United States, it’s estimated that 1% to 6% of people have peptic ulcers.\n\nPeptic ulcers can lead to bleeding in the digestive tract, a hole in the wall of the stomach or duodenum, ulcers in nearby organs, and blockage that stops food from moving into the duodenum. Two common causes of peptic ulcers include an infection with Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) bacteria and high doses or chronic use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as Advil or Motrin (ibuprofen) and Aleve (naproxen).\n\nSymptoms of a peptic ulcer include:\n\nAbdominal pain or discomfort in the upper part of the abdomen\n\nFeeling full soon after starting a meal or overfull after eating a normal-sized meal\n\nIndigestion\n\nNausea\n\nVomiting\n\nAbdominal bloating\n\nBelching\n\nPassing black or tarry stool\n\nVomiting blood\n\nColon Polyps and Cancer\n\nColon polyps are growths on the lining of the colon and rectum. Most polyps are not harmful or cancerous, but some may develop into cancer over time. This is why colonoscopies are so important. Removing polyps can help prevent colorectal cancer.\n\nMost often, there are no symptoms of colon polyps. If a colon polyp is causing symptoms, they may include:\n\nRectal bleeding\n\nDark-colored stools or blood in the stool\n\nFatigue due to anemia (a low number of healthy red blood cells)\n\nIn the United States, it’s thought that between 15% and 40% of adults have colon polyps. Men and people aged 45 or older are more likely to have colon polyps. However, people with a strong family history of colon cancer in a parent or sibling or with hereditary polyposis syndrome (inherited condition marked by an increased risk of developing polyps) may require colonoscopy at an earlier age and more frequently.\n\nPancreatitis\n\nPancreatitis is inflammation of the pancreas. The pancreas secretes digestive enzymes into the small intestine. It also produces the hormones insulin and glucagon that regulate sugar metabolism.\n\nCommon causes of acute pancreatitis include gallstones and chronic alcohol consumption. Other causes include medications, infections, trauma, tumors, and more.\n\nSymptoms of acute pancreatitis commonly include upper abdominal pain, which can be sudden and severe. They are likely to need emergency medical attention. Other symptoms can include:\n\nAbdominal swelling and tenderness\n\nNausea\n\nVomiting\n\nFever\n\nRapid heart rate\n\nWhen Is a Digestive System Disease Serious?\n\nCommon digestive problems, such as constipation, diarrhea, and heartburn, are issues that many people experience every so often. These conditions often improve on their own or with over-the-counter (OTC) treatments.\n\nHowever, if your symptoms get worse or don’t go away, it might be necessary to schedule an appointment with a healthcare provider. Depending on the severity of your condition, you may need a referral to see a specialist, such as a gastroenterologist who specializes in digestive health.\n\nSeek medical treatment if you are experiencing any of the following:\n\nOngoing or unusual abdominal pain, bloating, or gas\n\nOngoing or severe heartburn\n\nPain or difficulty when swallowing\n\nA feeling of food stuck in your esophagus\n\nChoking on food\n\nContinuous nausea or vomiting\n\nChronic diarrhea\n\nChronic constipation\n\nUnable to have complete bowel movements\n\nBlack stools or blood in the stool\n\nOily, greasy, or foul-smelling stool (steatorrhea)\n\nLoss of appetite\n\nUnintentional weight loss\n\nExtreme fatigue\n\nHigh Fever\n\nRisks of Untreated Gut Problems\n\nGetting a proper diagnosis is the first step in figuring out your digestive issues. This will help you receive appropriate treatment, which is crucial to managing your symptoms and preventing complications.\n\nUntreated digestive issues may worsen symptoms, which can greatly impact your quality of life. Healthcare costs can also increase with more complicated conditions. Over time, untreated gut problems can lead to serious complications like dehydration, malnutrition, cancer, and even death.\n\nIf you suspect you have a digestive disease, seek medical treatment as soon as possible. A healthcare provider can create a care plan best suited to treat your symptoms. Treatment may include medication, dietary supplements, dietary and lifestyle changes, surgical procedures, or psychological interventions such as cognitive behavioral therapy.\n\nWhat to Eat If You Have a Digestive System Disease\n\nOftentimes when you have a disease of the digestive system, you will need to modify your diet. What you eat and what you avoid eating depend on which condition you have.\n\nDiscuss any modifications with a healthcare provider to ensure they are appropriate for your condition. Dietary modifications can vary greatly depending on the condition that is being treated.\n\nFor example, if you are diagnosed with celiac disease, you will need to avoid all foods and beverages containing gluten or that may have been cross-contaminated with gluten. Depending on the severity, you may even need to avoid some medications and other products that might contain gluten, such as toothpaste, makeup, lip balms, or lotions.\n\nIn severe cases of other digestive conditions, such as diverticulitis, you may need to restrict what you are eating to only clear liquids, then advance your diet to full liquids, before slowly adding in regular foods once symptoms have improved.\n\nA registered dietitian (RD) or registered dietitian nutritionist (RDN) specializing in digestive health can help you navigate what foods and beverages to consume and which might be triggers for you to avoid.\n\nSummary\n\nDiseases and conditions of the digestive tract include gastroenteritis, celiac disease, constipation, diarrhea, IBS, IBD, colitis, diverticular disease, acid reflux, pancreatitis, problems of the anus and rectum, colon polyps, and cancer.\n\nIf symptoms of a digestive condition worsen, last longer than usual, or new symptoms start to develop, this could be a sign of a more serious condition and the need for immediate medical attention."
