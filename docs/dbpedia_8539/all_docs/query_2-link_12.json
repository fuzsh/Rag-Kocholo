        "text": "People often refer to the entire abdominal region as “the stomach.” Actually, your stomach is an organ located in the upper left part of your abdomen. It’s the first intra-abdominal part of your digestive tract.\n\nYour stomach contains several muscles. It can change shape as you eat or change posture. It also plays an instrumental role in digestion.\n\nWhen you swallow, food travels down your esophagus, passes the lower esophageal sphincter, and enters your stomach. Your stomach has three jobs:\n\ntemporary storage of food and liquids\n\nproduction of digestive juices\n\nemptying the mixture into your small intestine\n\nHow long this process takes depends on the foods you eat and how well your stomach muscles function. Certain foods, like carbohydrates, pass through quickly, while proteins remain longer. Fats take the most time to process.\n\nReflux occurs when stomach contents such as food, acid, or bile moves back into your esophagus. When this happens twice a week or more, it’s called gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). This chronic condition can cause heartburn and irritate your esophagus lining.\n\nRisk factors for GERD include:\n\nobesity\n\nsmoking\n\npregnancy\n\nasthma\n\ndiabetes\n\nhiatal hernia\n\ndelay in stomach emptying\n\nscleroderma\n\nZollinger-Ellison syndrome\n\nTreatment involves over-the-counter remedies and dietary changes. Severe cases require prescription medication or surgery.\n\nGastritis is an inflammation of your stomach lining. Acute gastritis may come on suddenly. Chronic gastritis happens slowly. According to the Cleveland Clinic, 8 in 1,000 people have acute gastritis and 2 of every 10,000 develop chronic gastritis.\n\nSymptoms of gastritis include:\n\nhiccups\n\nnausea\n\nvomiting\n\nindigestion\n\nbloating\n\nappetite loss\n\nblack stool due to bleeding in your stomach\n\nCauses include:\n\nstress\n\nbile reflux from your small intestine\n\nexcess alcohol consumption\n\nchronic vomiting\n\nuse of aspirin or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)\n\nbacterial or viral infections\n\npernicious anemia\n\nautoimmune diseases\n\nMedications can reduce acid and inflammation. You should avoid foods and beverages that cause symptoms.\n\nIf the lining of your stomach breaks down you may have a peptic ulcer. Most are located in the first layer of the inner lining. An ulcer that goes all the way through your stomach lining is called a perforation and requires immediate medical attention.\n\nSymptoms include:\n\nabdominal pain\n\nnausea\n\nvomiting\n\ninability to drink fluids\n\nfeeling hungry soon after eating\n\nfatigue\n\nweight loss\n\nblack or tarry stool\n\nchest pain\n\nRisk factors include:\n\nHelicobacter pylori bacteria\n\nexcessive alcohol consumption\n\noveruse of aspirin or NSAIDs\n\ntobacco\n\nradiation treatments\n\nusing a breathing machine\n\nZollinger-Ellison syndrome\n\nTreatment depends on the cause. It may involve medications or surgery to stop the bleeding.\n\nViral gastroenteritis occurs when a virus causes your stomach and intestines to become inflamed. The main symptoms are vomiting and diarrhea. You may also have cramping, headache, and fever.\n\nMost people recover within a few days. Very young children, older adults, and people with other diseases are at increased risk for dehydration.\n\nViral gastroenteritis is spread through close contact or contaminated food or drink. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), outbreaks are more likely to occur in closed environments such as schools and nursing homes.\n\nThe hiatus is the gap in the muscle wall that separates your chest from your abdomen. If your stomach slides up into your chest through this gap, you have a hiatal hernia.\n\nIf part of your stomach pushes through and stays in your chest next to your esophagus, it’s called a paraesophageal hernia. This less common type of hernia can cut off your stomach’s blood supply.\n\nSymptoms of hiatal hernia include:\n\nbloating\n\nbelching\n\npain\n\nbitter taste in your throat\n\nThe cause isn’t always known but can be due to injury or strain.\n\nYour risk factor is higher if you’re:\n\noverweight\n\nover age 50\n\na smoker\n\nTreatment involves medications to treat pain and heartburn. Severe cases may require surgery. Your doctor may recommend that you:\n\nmaintain a healthy weight\n\nlimit fatty and acidic foods\n\nelevate the head of your bed\n\nGastroparesis is a condition in which your stomach takes too long to empty.\n\nSymptoms include:\n\nnausea\n\nvomiting\n\nweight loss\n\nbloating\n\nheartburn\n\nCauses include:\n\ndiabetes\n\nmedications that affect your intestines\n\nstomach or vagus nerve surgery\n\nanorexia nervosa\n\npostviral syndromes\n\nmuscle, nervous system, or metabolic disorders\n\nTreatment may include medication and dietary changes. In severe cases, surgery may be necessary."
