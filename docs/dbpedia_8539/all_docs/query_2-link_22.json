        "text": "If it feels like there is something wrong with your stomach, the cause could be digestive or it could originate somewhere else, such as your urinary tract. Digestive problems can cause a range of symptoms, from constipation or diarrhea to stomach upset and pain.\n\nMost digestive problems are temporary and will clear up on their own, but others are chronic. Some can even be serious and life-threatening. Understanding what different symptoms might mean can help you manage the problem and find a long-term solution.\n\nThis article discusses a range of digestive and abdominal problems including those that affect the upper and lower gastrointestinal tract. It explains the symptoms of common ailments and signs that you should see a healthcare provider.\n\nSymptoms of Upper GI Disorders\n\nThe digestive system consists of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract as well as the liver, pancreas, and gallbladder. The GI tract itself is made up of several parts. Healthcare providers usually refer to one section as the upper GI tract and the other as the lower GI tract.\n\nThe mouth, esophagus, stomach, and first part of the small intestine (duodenum) comprise the upper GI tract. If you have problems with the upper GI tract, you may have symptoms such as heartburn, problems swallowing or passing food along your esophagus and stomach, stomach pain, nausea, and vomiting.\n\nGastroesophageal Reflux Disease\n\nGastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is the main cause of heartburn, a burning sensation in the upper abdomen that usually occurs after you eat. When the muscles between the esophagus and stomach aren't working right, the contents of your stomach (including acid and food) go back up the esophagus. This is commonly called \"reflux.\"\n\nPeptic Ulcer\n\nA peptic ulcer occurs when acid or digestive enzymes eat away at the lining of the stomach or duodenum. Symptoms can include pain, bleeding, and blockages in the digestive system. Most peptic ulcers, whether in adults or children, are caused by a Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection.\n\nGastritis\n\nGastritis is an inflammation of the stomach lining that causes symptoms similar to heartburn. It's usually treated with medication to reduce stomach acid.\n\nGastroparesis\n\nAlso referred to as delayed gastric emptying, gastroparesis is a disorder in which the stomach takes too long to empty its contents. It is usually caused by damage to the stomach nerves. If you have type 1 or type 2 diabetes, you're at an increased risk of gastroparesis. Medications can also cause gastroparesis.\n\nGallstones\n\nGallstones can form in the gallbladder when bile hardens. If gallstones block the ducts of the gallbladder, they can cause severe pain. Some gallstones never cause symptoms while others need to be surgically removed.\n\nCeliac Disease\n\nPeople who have celiac disease can't eat gluten since it causes an immune response that damages the small intestine. Celiac disease is often mistaken for other gastrointestinal disorders before it's correctly diagnosed.\n\nYour healthcare provider needs to run blood tests and other labs to determine if your symptoms are caused by celiac disease.\n\nSymptoms of Lower Abdominal Disorders\n\nThe lower GI tract begins after the duodenum. It runs from the small intestines to the large intestines, or colon, to the anus.\n\nThere are several digestive disorders that can contribute to intestinal symptoms such as lower abdominal pain, cramping, and bowel movement problems.\n\nDiverticulitis\n\nDiverticulitis is the inflammation of the diverticula, which are bulging pouches in the walls of the intestines. Symptoms include sharp pains in the lower left abdomen, usually accompanied by a fever. If left untreated, diverticulitis can cause life-threatening complications.\n\nInflammatory Bowel Disease\n\nInflammatory bowel disease is an umbrella term for two conditions (which can sometimes overlap): Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Both are chronic conditions that require lifelong monitoring and treatment.\n\nIrritable Bowel Syndrome\n\nIrritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a very common digestive disorder that causes recurring abdominal pain, diarrhea, constipation, or both.\n\nSymptoms of Stomach Cancer\n\nStomach cancer is the fourth most common type of cancer in men and the seventh most common cancer in women. Often, stomach cancer, also known as gastric cancer, doesn't have symptoms in its early stages or the symptoms are similar to other stomach and GI disorders. However, there are some signs to watch for, especially if you have a family history of stomach cancer.\n\nThese \"red-flag\" symptoms include:\n\nProlonged lack of appetite\n\nUnexplained weight loss\n\nExtreme, persistent fatigue\n\nVomiting blood\n\nOther possible symptoms could include anemia, blood in your stool, and recurrent pain.\n\nSymptoms of Non-Digestive Disorders\n\nCertain conditions that originate in other parts of the body, such as the urinary tract and female reproductive system, can cause symptoms that feel like they're coming from your stomach.\n\nUrinary Tract Infection\n\nA urinary tract infection is a bacterial infection of the bladder or other parts of the urinary tract, including the urethra and kidneys. Besides urinary symptoms like pain with urination and frequent urination, you may also experience:\n\nPain below the belly button\n\nNausea and vomiting\n\nFemale Reproductive Disorders\n\nA number of different conditions of the female reproductive system can cause problems that feel like they originate from the stomach or intestines. Some of these conditions and their associated symptoms include:\n\nEndometriosis: In addition to other symptoms like painful menstrual cramps and heavy or irregular periods, endometriosis may cause GI symptoms during your menstrual period such as diarrhea, constipation, or pain with bowel movements.\n\nPelvic inflammatory disease: This infection of the female reproductive tract can cause nausea, vomiting, and pain in the upper and lower abdomen.\n\nUterine fibroids: Uterine fibroids are benign tumors that develop in the uterus. Besides symptoms like heavy periods, bleeding between periods, and infertility, they can cause a feeling of abdominal discomfort or pain, constipation, and excessive strain during bowel movements.\n\nOvarian cancer: Ovarian cancer can cause symptoms that mimic GI problems, such as bloating, abdominal pain, and a feeling of early fullness while eating.\n\nWhen to See a Healthcare Provider\n\nIt's best to discuss any ongoing GI issues with a healthcare provider. Pain, bloating, constipation, and diarrhea affect everyone from time to time, but if these are a regular occurrence, you could have an underlying health condition. Importantly, anytime you have blood in your stool, you should see a healthcare provider as soon as possible.\n\nTalk to your primary healthcare provider first. However, you may be referred to a gastroenterologist, a doctor who specializes in diseases and disorders of the digestive tract.\n\nSummary\n\nUpper GI issues often cause heartburn and pain or discomfort in the stomach or chest. Problems with the lower GI tract can cause cramping, constipation, or diarrhea. Disorders of the urinary tract and female reproductive system can also cause symptoms that mimic GI conditions."
