        "text": "Large Bowel Disorders\n\nThe large bowel, also known as the colon or large intestine, begins at the region just at or below the right waist and continues from the small intestine and up the abdomen. The major function of the large intestine is to absorb water from the remaining indigestible food matter and transmit the useless waste material from the body.\n\nMany disorders can affect the large intestine or colon, including:\n\nAppendicitis\n\nChronic diarrhea\n\nColon (colorectal) cancer\n\nColonic dismotility\n\nCrohn’s disease (Inflammatory bowel disease)\n\nDiverticulitis\n\nFecal incontinence — accidental stool leaks/pelvic floor disorders\n\nIntestinal ischemia\n\nIntestinal obstructions\n\nIrritable bowel syndrome\n\nPolyps\n\nRectal prolapse\n\nUlcerative colitis\n\nC difficile infection (Clostridium)\n\nSigns and symptoms of large bowel disorders\n\nThe types of symptoms that can occur with a large bowel disorder are dependent on what part of the large bowel is affected. These symptoms can range from mild to severe, as well as come and go with periods of flare-ups. In addition, bowel problems can accompany other symptoms, which can vary depending on the underlying disease, disorder or condition.\n\nSome of the more common symptoms of large bowel disorders include:\n\nAbdominal pain\n\nAbdominal swelling, distension or bloating\n\nBloody stool (blood may be red, black, or tarry in texture)\n\nConstipation\n\nDiarrhea\n\nFatigue\n\nFever and chills\n\nGas\n\nInability to defecate or pass gas\n\nNausea with or without vomiting\n\nOther symptoms may be present with a large bowel disorder which can affect a patient’s general health and wellness such as:\n\nAnxiety\n\nDepression\n\nLoss of appetite\n\nMalnutrition\n\nSkin and hair conditions\n\nUnexplained weight loss\n\nWeakness (loss of strength)\n\nDiagnosis of large bowel disorders\n\nIn order to diagnose what type of large bowel disorder a patient is experiencing or the severity of the disorder, your doctor will first conduct a complete medical history and physical examination. Diagnostic tests may also be used to assist in developing a treatment plan for your condition, and may include:\n\nBarium enema. Also known as a lower GI series; a barium solution is placed into the colon, and x-rays are taken.\n\nBarium swallow. Also known as an upper GI series; the barium solution is used to coat the inner lining of the esophagus, stomach, and the first part of the small intestine, and x-rays are taken.\n\nBlood tests\n\nBreath tests with lactose. A safe, simple and non-invasive method of assessing absorption. The test uses a nutrient that contains radioactive material which is measured in the breath.\n\nColonoscopy: A thin, flexible tube called a colonoscope is used to look at the inner lining of the large intestine. This test helps find ulcers, colon polyps, tumors, and areas of inflammation or bleeding. Tissue samples can be collected (biopsy) and abnormal growths can be taken out. This test can also be used as a screening test for cancer or precancerous growths (polyps) in the colon or rectum.\n\nLess-invasive testing. Blood tests are available to help with a diagnosis. The Fecal Immunochemical Test (FIT) is a newer version of the fecal occult blood test (FOBT) that detects minute traces of blood in the stool.\n\nCapsule endoscopy may be performed to provide an enhanced view of the lower digestive tract which may not be visible with a traditional colonoscopy.\n\nSigmoidoscopy: A procedure used to see inside the rectum and the area of the large intestine nearest the rectum.\n\nImaging tests. X-rays, computed tomography (CT) scans, MRI, PET scans\n\nMRI\n\nRadio-nucleotide imaging: Typically used for diverticulitis and detection of gastrointestinal bleeding. A radioactive substance is injected into a vein. If there is intestinal bleeding, the radioactive substance will leak into the intestine together with the blood.\n\nUltrasound: Good for the detection of large intestinal tumors.\n\nTreatment of large bowel disorders\n\nIn some cases, your physician may suggest a few simple measures to determine if your symptoms will subside, such as:\n\nAvoid smoking\n\nAvoid foods that trigger the symptoms\n\nExercise\n\nIncrease dietary fiber\n\nMaintain a healthy weight\n\nMedications (i.e., over-the-counter or prescription medications)\n\nSome conditions, such as C difficile infection, will be treated in collaboration with other Summa clinicians, including our colorectal surgeons and infectious disease specialists.\n\nAs an advanced treatment measure, your specialist may recommend surgery. Summa surgeons perform many large bowel procedures including:\n\nColon and rectal surgery\n\nPolyp removal\n\nRectal prolapse\n\nSacral nerve implants/stimulation for accidental stool leakage"
