        "text": "What's a Stomachache?\n\nPain is the body's way of signaling that something is going on. Stomach pain alerts us to something that's happening inside us that we might not know about otherwise.\n\nWhat Causes Belly Pain?\n\nSome reasons for belly pain are obvious, like when someone gets hit in the gut or eats spoiled macaroni salad. Oher times, it might be hard to figure out. With so many organs in the abdomen, different problems can have similar symptoms.\n\nHere are some of the things that cause tummy troubles:\n\nInfections\n\nWhen or viruses get into a person's digestive system, the body reacts by trying to rid itself of the infection, often through vomiting or diarrhea.\n\nBacterial infections cause what we call \"food poisoning.\" Bacteria are also responsible for other conditions that may give a person belly pain, such as:\n\npneumonia\n\nurinary tract infections\n\nstrep throat\n\nsexually transmitted diseases (STDs)\n\nthe rare condition toxic shock syndrome\n\nViruses, another type of infection, are behind what we call \"stomach flu,\" or gastroenteritis (pronounced: gas-troe-en-teh-RYE-tiss).\n\nBacteria and viruses both can pass easily from person to person. To avoid them:\n\nWash your hands well and often.\n\nDon't share cups, straws, or utensils with others.\n\nConstipation\n\nConstipation is a top cause of belly pain. People can get constipated if their diet doesn't include enough fluids and fiber.\n\nIrritation and Inflammation\n\nWhen one of the body's internal organs is irritated or swollen, that can bring on belly pain. Pain from problems like appendicitis, ulcers, irritable bowel syndrome, and inflammatory bowel disease is the body's way of telling us to get medical help.\n\nFood Reactions\n\nFood reactions can be more than eating too much or basic indigestion. When people can't digest certain foods, doctors say they have a food intolerance. Lactose intolerance, for example, causes belly pain when someone eats milk products. If you notice pain or other symptoms like gas, bloating, or diarrhea after eating certain foods, call your doctor.\n\nConditions like celiac disease (a reaction to proteins in some grains) or food allergies (like peanut allergy) are different from food intolerance. They involve immune system reactions that can actually harm the body beyond causing a temporary reaction. Someone who has a true food allergy must always avoid that food.\n\nReproductive Problems\n\nThe digestive system isn't the only cause of bellyaches. Menstrual cramps are a common cause of pain in the reproductive organs. Infections in the reproductive system, such as pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) or other STDs, also can cause belly pain in girls.\n\nTesticular injuries can make a guy feel sick or even throw up if they are severe.\n\nWomen often feel nausea during pregnancy. Ectopic pregnancies (when the pregnancy implants in the wrong place) can cause abdominal pain.\n\nBecause problems like ectopic pregnancy need quick treatment, girls who have belly pain and think they might be pregnant should call a doctor right away. And girls who have had unprotected sex should be tested for STDs. Untreated STDs can cause problems like infertility and chronic belly or pelvic pain.\n\nAlways use a condom if you have sex to protect against STDs and pregnancy.\n\nAnatomical Problems\n\nSome diseases or defects can affect how the organs do their jobs, causing pain. Crohn's disease can make the intestinal wall swell and scar so much that it may block the intestine.\n\nHernias can also block the intestines, as can growths like tumors. Torsion is a medical term that means \"twisting.\" Torsion can affect the intestines, ovaries, and testicles, cutting off blood supply or or affecting how they work. These need to be checked by a health care provider right away.\n\nEmotional Distress\n\nWhen people get stressed, anxious, or depressed, their emotions can trigger physical symptoms, such as headaches or stomach pain.\n\nOther Causes\n\nBelly pain also can be due to problems that can happen when people have certain illnesses, such as sickle cell disease or diabetes.\n\nHow Do Doctors Find the Cause of a Stomachache?\n\nTo find the cause of a stomachache, doctors ask about:\n\nyour symptoms\n\nillnesses you've had in the past\n\nhealth conditions that other family members have\n\nBe honest with your doctor, even if a symptom seems embarrassing.\n\nThe doctor will do an exam and sometimes might order tests, such as an X-ray, ultrasound, or blood test. It all depends on what the doctor thinks is causing the problem.\n\nWhen Should I Call the Doctor?\n\nSometimes, what seems like one problem — food poisoning, for example — can turn out to be something more serious, like appendicitis.\n\nCall your doctor if:\n\nthe pain is very strong\n\nyou're vomiting\n\nyou already have another health condition\n\nthe pain gets worse over time, doesn't go away, or wakes you up from sleep\n\nAlso let the doctor know if you:\n\nhave a fever\n\nhave pain when you pee\n\nhave trouble pooping or peeing\n\nhave blood in your poop or pee\n\nthink the belly pain is from an injury\n\nmight be pregnant\n\nHow Can I Feel Better?\n\nMost bellyaches don't have a serious cause. They can happen for many different reasons, but most are easy to treat.\n\nIf stress or anxiety seem to be behind the pain, the doctor may recommend that you talk to a counselor or therapist. They help people figure out what's behind their stress and give advice on how to fix problems or handle them better.\n\nCan Stomachaches Be Prevented?\n\nNot all belly pain can be prevented. But to help avoid common types of stomachaches:"
