        "text": "From embarrassing gas to uncomfortable heartburn, everyone has digestive problems from time to time. The good news is there are some simple solutions for many of your troubles. Learn about what causes your discomfort, how to prevent and manage digestive problems, what questions to ask your pharmacist, and when to see a doctor.\n\nThe Digestive System\n\nHow does theÂ digestive system work?\n\nIt may seem like digestion only happens in yourÂ stomach, but itâs a long process that involves many organs. Together they form the digestive tract.\n\nDigestion begins in your mouth, whereÂ saliva starts to break down food when you chew. When you swallow, your chewed food moves to yourÂ esophagus, a tube that connects your throat to yourÂ stomach. Muscles in the esophagus push the food down to a valve at the bottom of your esophagus, which opens to let food into the stomach.\n\nYour stomach breaks food down using stomach acids. Then the food moves into the small intestine. There, digestive juices from several organs, like yourÂ pancreas andÂ gallbladder, break down the food more, and nutrients are absorbed. Whatâs left goes through your large intestine. The large intestine absorbs water. The waste then moves out of your body through the rectum andÂ anus.\n\nDigestive problems can happen anywhere along the way.\n\nGas and Bloating\n\nBloating andÂ passing gas can be uncomfortable and embarrassing. Hereâs what you need to know.\n\nWhat is gas?\n\nGas is a normal part of healthy digestion. Air that is in your digestive tract is either released through yourÂ mouth as a burp or through your anus as gas. You typically pass gas 13 to 21 times a day.\n\nWhat causes gas?\n\nGas is created when you swallow air, such as when you eat and drink. But itâs also a byproduct of the breakdown of food. Some foods cause more gas than others. You may also be more sensitive to particular foods and may have more gas when you eat them.\n\nTaking someÂ medications can also cause gas.\n\nWhich foods cause gas?\n\nYouâve probably noticed you feel gassy after eating certain foods. Cut back on the common culprits:\n\nApples\n\nAsparagus\n\nBeans\n\nBroccoli\n\nBrussels sprouts\n\nCabbage\n\nCauliflower\n\nMilk and dairy products\n\nMushrooms\n\nOnions\n\nPeaches\n\nPears\n\nPrunes\n\nWheat\n\nWhat causes bloating?\n\nWhen gas builds up in your stomach andÂ intestines, you may have bloating â swelling in your belly and a feeling of fullness. It may happen to you more often if you have:\n\nA stomach infection\n\nIrritable bowel syndrome (IBS). This digestive condition causesÂ stomach pain, cramping, and diarrhea orÂ constipation.\n\nCeliac disease. When people with this condition eat gluten, their bodies produce antibodies that attack the intestinal lining.\n\nHormonal changes that happen around womenâs periods\n\nConstipation\n\nWhile bloating is usually just uncomfortable, it can sometimesÂ cause pain in your belly or sides.\n\nHow can I reduce gas and bloating?\n\nDiet and lifestyle changes can make a big difference:\n\nCut back on fatty foods.\n\nAvoid fizzy drinks.\n\nEat and drink slowly.\n\nQuit smoking.\n\nDonât chew gum.\n\nExercise more.\n\nAvoid foods that cause gas.\n\nAvoid sweeteners that cause gas such as fructose andÂ sorbitol. They are often found in candies, chewing gum, energy bars, and low-carb foods.\n\nWhat OTC medicines treat excess gas?\n\nIf you have a lot of gas or are very uncomfortable, an over-the-counter medicine may help.\n\nLactaseÂ supplements. If dairy is causing your problems, taking these tablets or drops just before you eat will help you digest lactose (the main sugar in dairy foods) and reduce gas.\n\nAlpha-galactosidase. This digestive aid comes as liquid or tablets. You take it before you eat to help your body break down the complex carbs or sugars that cause gas, such as those found in beans, broccoli, and cabbage. Caution: People with the genetic condition galactosemia should avoid it. It may also interfere with some diabetes drugs likeÂ acarbose (Precose) orÂ miglitol (Glyset). If you take medication forÂ diabetes, talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking this aid.\n\nSimethicone (Mylicon).Â Taking these liquids or tablets can relieve the uncomfortable bloating and pain from gas.\n\nProbiotics. These supplements contain \"friendly\" bacteria that can help digestion. In addition to tablets and powders you sprinkle on your food, foods like yogurt, kefir, and sauerkraut containÂ probiotics.\n\nHeartburn/GERD\n\nWhat isÂ heartburn?\n\nHeartburn, sometimes called acidÂ indigestion, is a painful, burning feeling in the middle of your chest or the upper part of your stomach. The pain, which can also spread to your neck, jaw, or arms, can last just a few minutes or stick with you for hours.\n\nWhat causes heartburn?\n\nThereâs a muscle at the entrance of your stomach, called the lower esophageal sphincter (LES), that acts like a gate: It opens to let food move from your esophagus to your stomach, and it shuts to stop food and acid from coming back out.\n\nWhen the LES opens too often or isnât tight enough, stomach acid can rise up into the esophagus and cause the burning feeling.\n\nWhatÂ triggers heartburn?\n\nTriggers vary from person to person, but you may be more likely to get heartburn when you:\n\nOvereat\n\nEat spicy, fatty, acidic, or greasy foods\n\nConsume caffeine or alcohol\n\nSmoke\n\nLie down shortly after you eat\n\nAre under stress\n\nWho gets heartburn?\n\nSome people have a higher risk of heartburn, including those who are:\n\nSmokers\n\nOverweight\n\nPregnant\n\nHave aÂ hiatal hernia, where the stomach bulges up into the chest through an opening in the diaphragm\n\nHow should I change my diet to avoid heartburn?\n\nYou might have noticed that your heartburn gets worse when you eat or drink certain things. Here are a few that canÂ trigger heartburn:\n\nAlcohol\n\nChocolate\n\nCoffee\n\nFatty or fried foods\n\nGreasy foods\n\nOnions\n\nOranges, lemons, and other citrus fruits and juices\n\nVinegar, hot sauces, and salad dressings\n\nPeppermint\n\nSodas and other bubbly drinks\n\nSpicy foods\n\nTomatoes and tomato sauce\n\nBig meals can also set off heartburn. Instead of eating three big meals a day, try to eat several small meals throughout the day.\n\nWhat else can I do to prevent heartburn?\n\nHere are a few steps to try:\n\nLose weight if youâreÂ overweight. Extra pounds put pressure on your stomach, forcing more acid up into your esophagus.\n\nWear loose clothing. Tight clothes that press on your stomach can trigger heartburn.\n\nIf you smoke, quit. Cigarette smoke relaxes the muscle that prevents acid from backing up into the esophagus. It also may increase how much acid your stomach makes.\n\nCheck your medicines. Regular use of anti-inflammatory and pain medicines (other thanÂ acetaminophen) contributes to heartburn.\n\nAvoid high-impactÂ exercise.\n\nIf heartburn bothers you at night:\n\nEat a light dinner and avoid foods that trigger your heartburn.\n\nDonât lie down for at least 2 to 3 hours after you eat.\n\nUse blocks or books to raise the head of your bed by 4-6 inches. Or put a foam wedge under your mattress at the head of the bed. Sleeping at an angle will help stop acid from backing up into your esophagus.\n\nCan exerciseÂ cause heartburn?\n\nExercise has more than a few health perks. Among them is weight loss, which can help you avoid getting heartburn in the first place if you are overweight. But some types of exercise can trigger the burning sensation. Youâll be less likely to reach for your heartburn medicine if you avoid crunches and inverted poses inÂ yoga. You may need to find alternatives to high-impact workouts. For example, bicycle or swim instead of going for a run.\n\nWhat is GERD?\n\nEveryone has heartburn from time to time. But when you have it frequently (at least twice a week for a few weeks), or when it begins to interfere with your daily life or damage your esophagus, your doctor may tell you that you have a long-term condition called gastroesophageal reflux disease, or GERD. Itâs also known asÂ acid reflux disease. Heartburn is the most common symptom of GERD.\n\nWhat are other symptoms of GERD?\n\nBesides the frequent burning in your chest, you might also have symptoms like:\n\nBad breath or a sour taste in yourÂ mouth or in the back of your throat\n\nBreathing problems\n\nCoughing\n\nFeeling like you have a lump in the back of your throat\n\nHoarse or raspy voice\n\nNausea\n\nDifficult or painful swallowing\n\nSore throat\n\nTooth decay\n\nVomiting\n\nIs it GERD or something else?\n\nFrequent heartburn is a symptom of GERD. Itâs important to get help if you have heartburn frequently so you can avoid complications from GERD and uncover any other problems. Call your doctor or make an appointment with a gastroenterologist, who specializes in digestive illnesses.\n\nMany of theÂ symptoms of heartburn sound like aÂ heart attack. If youâre not sure, call 911.\n\nWhat are the complications of frequent heartburn and GERD?\n\nOver time, heartburn that isnât treated or controlled well by lifestyle changes or medicine may cause serious problems, including:\n\nBreathing problems like asthma, nighttime choking, and repeated pneumonia\n\nChanges in the cells that line the esophagus, called Barrettâs esophagus. This can possibly lead toÂ cancer of the esophagus.\n\nPainfulÂ inflammation of the esophagus calledÂ esophagitis\n\nNarrowing of the esophagus, called an esophageal stricture. This can cause problems swallowing.\n\nWhat medicines can I take to treat heartburn?\n\nSeveral types of over-the-counter (OTC) and prescription medicines can help with heartburn. Your doctor or pharmacist can help you find the one thatâs right for you.\n\nAntacids\n\nWhat type of antacid should I choose?\n\nSoothe occasional, mild heartburn with an antacid that containsÂ calcium carbonate orÂ magnesium. They help neutralize stomach acid. Some prevent acid reflux. Those that contain magnesium may also help heal stomach ulcers. They come in liquids and pills and are fast-acting.\n\nWhat are the side effects of antacids?\n\nAntacids can causeÂ constipation and diarrhea. Look for brands that containÂ calcium carbonate, magnesium hydroxide, and aluminum hydroxide to reduce these side effects. Donât take antacids with magnesium if you have chronic kidney disease. Some antacids have a lot of salt, so you should take them only for occasional heartburn.\n\nH2 Blockers\n\nWhat do H2 blockers do?\n\nH2 blockers help relieve and prevent occasional heartburn by lowering the amount of acid your stomach makes. Though they donât work as fast as antacids, their effects last longer. Your doctor may tell you to take an antacid and an H2 blocker together. H2 blockers are for short-term use â less than 2 weeks. You can take them before your meals to prevent heartburn, or atÂ bedtime. They come in liquids and pills.\n\nAll H2 blockers work about the same. So if one doesnât help with your heartburn, switching to a different one isnât likely to help. Switching to a higher-dose prescription version of the drug might help, though. Talk to your doctor if over-the-counter H2 blockers aren't working for you.\n\nSome H2 blockers can interfere with other drugs, including:\n\nAnti-seizure medicines\n\nBlood thinners\n\nMedicines forÂ heart rhythm problems\n\nTalk to your doctor if you take any of these medicines and you need to take an H2 blocker.\n\nWhat are the side effects of H2 blockers?\n\nThe most common side effects are mild and include:\n\nConstipation\n\nDiarrhea\n\nHeadache\n\nNausea or vomiting\n\nProton-Pump Inhibitors (PPIs)\n\nWhat are PPIs?\n\nPPIs are used to prevent frequent heartburn that happens more than twice a week. They work by lowering the amount of acid your stomach makes. Often, they work better than H2 blockers. You also can take these drugs for a longer period of time than H2 blockers.\n\nPPIs are available over the counter and by prescription. But if you have GERD, you may need prescription-strength medication.\n\nHow do you take PPIs?\n\nYou need to take PPIs once a day on an empty stomach so theyâll work best. Usually youâll take the medicine every morning, about 30 to 60 minutes before you eatÂ breakfast, to control stomach acid.\n\nTalk to your doctor before taking the PPI calledÂ omeprazole (Prilosec OTC) if you takeÂ clopidogrel (Plavix), a drug used to preventÂ heart attacks and strokes. Taking the two drugs may make clopidogrel less effective.\n\nWhat are the side effects of PPIs?\n\nThe most common side effects are mild and include:\n\nDiarrhea\n\nHeadache\n\nNausea and vomiting\n\nStomach pain\n\nPPIs may also raise your chances of getting kidney disease, and fractures of the hip, wrist, and spin, and may lead to low magnesium levels. The risk is highest in people who take high dose PPIs for a year or more.Â\n\nProkinetics\n\nWhat are prokinetics?\n\nProkinetics help your stomach empty faster, so you have less acid left behind. Usually you take this medicine before meals and atÂ bedtime.\n\nProkinetics are sold only by prescription.\n\nWhat are the side effects of prokinetics?\n\nProkinetics can have more serious side effects than PPIs or H2 blockers. These include:\n\nAnxiety\n\nDepression\n\nDiarrhea\n\nDrowsiness\n\nFatigue\n\nCrankiness\n\nNausea\n\nIf Medicines Donât Help\n\nShould I call my doctor?\n\nYes. If your heartburn isnât getting better, your medicines cause side effects you canât tolerate, or you have other complications, you may need surgery. It is rare to need surgery for heartburn.\n\nWhat will my doctor do?\n\nYour doctor will ask about your symptoms and do an exam. It can be helpful to keep a journal to note what you eat and drink and when you have heartburn. This will help you and your doctor pinpoint your triggers.\n\nIf medicine and lifestyle changes donât control your heartburn, you can take one of these tests to find out what's causing the problem:\n\npH test.Â This measures the acidity of your esophagus. The doctor will either attach a small sensor to your esophagus or place a thin tube down your esophagus.Â\n\nEndoscopy.Â A long, thin tube with a camera and light on the end is put down your esophagus so your doctor can look inside your esophagus and stomach. Endoscopy can look for problems such as an ulcer or narrowing inside your esophagus.\n\nBarium X-ray.Â Youâll drink a liquid that coats the inside of your digestive tract. Then X-rays are taken, which will allow your doctor to see the outline of yourÂ digestive system.\n\nWhen is heartburn an emergency?\n\nHeartburn is usually a minor problem that goes away over time. But if you also have other symptoms, it could be a sign that something more serious is wrong. Call your doctor or go to the emergency room if:\n\nIt hurts to swallow.\n\nYou feel like youâre choking.\n\nYou have black, tarry-lookingÂ bowel movements.\n\nYour mouth or throat hurts when you eat.\n\nYou have difficulty swallowing foods\n\nYour voice is hoarse.\n\nYour vomit containsÂ blood or what looks like coffee grounds.\n\nYou have trouble breathing.\n\nIs it heartburn or aÂ heart attack?\n\nHeartburn doesnât affect yourÂ heart, but it can feel a lot like theÂ chest pain that happens during a heart attack. Call 911 if you have any of these symptoms along with chest pain, even if youâre not sure that youâre having a heart attack:\n\nDizziness\n\nNausea and vomiting\n\nPain that travels to your neck andÂ shoulder, jaw, or back\n\nShortness of breath\n\nSweating\n\nOver-the-Counter Heartburn Relief\n\nType of medicineHow they workHow fast they start workingHow long the effects lastSide effects\n\nAntacids\n\nÂ\n\nThey neutralize stomach acid.Within secondsUp to 3 hoursSome cause constipation and diarrhea.\n\nH2 Blockers\n\nÂ\n\nThey lower the amount of acid your stomach makes.In about 30 minutesUp to 12 hours\n\nThey may cause constipation, diarrhea,Â headache, nausea, or vomiting.\n\nÂ\n\nProton-Pump Inhibitors (PPIs)\n\nÂ\n\nThey lower the amount of acid your stomach makes.Up to 4 daysUp to 24 hours\n\nThey may cause diarrhea,Â headache, stomach pain, nausea, or vomiting.\n\nÂ\n\nÂ\n\nConstipation\n\nHow do I know if Iâm constipated?\n\nWhatâs considered a normal number of bowel movements varies from person to person. If you are straining when going to the bathroom, you are probably constipated. You may also have hard stools or a feeling that your bowel movement isnât complete.\n\nOccasional constipation is common, but if you have less than three bowel movements in a week, see your doctor.\n\nWhat causes it?\n\nThere are many causes of constipation, and sometimes you have more than one:\n\nNot drinking enough water\n\nEating a diet low in fiber\n\nTraveling or changing your routine\n\nGetting too little exercise\n\nTaking certain medicines, such as antidepressants, antihistamines, iron, and some pain medications (particularly narcotic pain medications)\n\nMedical conditions including cancer, diabetes, IBS, and hypothyroidism\n\nPregnancy\n\nBlockages in the large intestine\n\nProblems with the nerves or muscles around the large intestine or rectum\n\nTaking too many laxatives\n\nWhen should I call my doctor?\n\nIf you are constipated for more than 2 weeks, are losing weight, have blood in your stool, or you are having severe pain, see your doctor. These may be signs of a serious problem.\n\nHow can I prevent and treat constipation without medication?\n\nDrink plenty of water (60-80 ounces per day). An extra two to four glasses a day may help.\n\nEat prunes or bran cereal to get 20-35 grams of fiber per day.\n\nEat more vegetables and fruit.\n\nDrink warm wateror herbal tea in the morning.\n\nExercise often.\n\nWhat OTC medications can I take for constipation?\n\nWhen lifestyle changes donât solve your problems, there are several over-the-counter medications that can help. Talk to your pharmacist or doctor about which medicine is right for you. Be sure to read labels carefully before taking these medicines. Using some over-the-counter treatments for constipation for more than 2 weeks can make your symptoms worse and may be a sign of something more serious.\n\nBulk-forming laxatives. You take these fiber supplements with water to bulk up your stool, which can trigger your bowels to push it out. Some common bulk laxatives areÂ methylcellulose, polycarbophil, psyllium, and wheat dextrin.\n\nLubricants, like mineral oil. They coat the surface of the intestine and block water from being absorbed from the stool, which helps it pass more easily.\n\nOsmotic agents. These help keep more water in the intestine, which can expand the intestine and stimulate a bowel movement. Osmotic agents are not for some older adults and people with heart or kidney failure. Talk to your doctor before taking this type of medicine.\n\nStool softeners. By adding fluid to stools, softeners help you avoid straining and make them easier to pass.\n\nStimulants. These laxatives make the intestines contract, which helps move the stool.\n\nSuppositories or enemas. Some laxatives come in a form that can be inserted into the rectum. These are helpful when you have to avoid straining, such as after surgery or childbirth.\n\nHemorrhoids\n\nWhat are hemorrhoids?\n\nHemorrhoids are swollen blood vessels in the rectum and the anus, and they can be uncomfortable. They can be either inside the rectum (internal) or under the skin around the anus (external). Internal hemorrhoids usually donât cause discomfort, though straining to have a bowel movement may cause them to bleed or lead to spasms in the muscles of the rectum, which can be painful. External hemorrhoids itch and may bleed.\n\nWhat are the symptoms of hemorrhoids?\n\nBleeding during a bowel movement. You might also notice blood on the toilet paper after you wipe.\n\nItching around the anus\n\nSwelling or pain around the anus\n\nPainful or sensitive lumps around the anus\n\nIf you think you have hemorrhoids, see your doctor. Bleeding can also be a symptom of something more serious.\n\nWhat causes hemorrhoids?\n\nConstipation or straining during bowel movements causes most hemorrhoids. You may also have hemorrhoids if you don't get enough fiber in your diet.\n\nBeing pregnant or overweight can cause hemorrhoids because of the extra pressure on your rectum. Hormonal changes that happen during pregnancy can also weaken the muscles of the rectum and anus.\n\nYouâre also more likely to get them if you sit for long periods of time. And they're more common as you get older. Other causes include having diabetes, a past rectal surgery, and colon cancer.\n\nWhen should I call my doctor?\n\nIf you think you have hemorrhoids, see your doctor. They can recommend treatment and make sure your symptoms are not caused by another condition.\n\nYou should also see your doctor if your hemorrhoids havenât gotten better with treatment. You may need to see a doctor who specializes in hemorrhoids.\n\nHow can I treat hemorrhoids without medication?\n\nAdd fiber to your diet to help relieve constipation and make your stools softer. This will make it easier to have bowel movements and reduce the pressure on hemorrhoids.\n\nTry a stool softener.\n\nExercise to help relieve constipation.\n\nDonât strain during bowel movements.\n\nSoak in a plain, warm bath or sitz bath (a few inches of water that covers your private parts and bottom) to help relieve the pain.\n\nKeep the area clean and dry.\n\nUse moist wipes instead of dry toilet paper so you donât irritate the area any further.\n\nApply an ice pack or cold compress to help with swelling.\n\nAvoid spicy foods to prevent itching.\n\nWhich OTC medications treat hemorrhoids?\n\nMedications include creams, suppositories, pads, and ointments. Most products contain witch hazel or hydrocortisone, which can help stop the itching and swelling and may ease pain. Most over-the-counter medications should not be used for more than a week. Talk to your doctor or pharmacist about which is the best option for you.\n\nDiarrhea\n\nWhat is diarrhea?\n\nDiarrhea is loose, watery stool that sends you to the bathroom more often than usual. When you have diarrhea, you may have stomach pain and cramps or bloating.\n\nWhat causes it?\n\nMany things cause diarrhea, including viruses, bacteria, parasites, medications, and medical conditions that affect the stomach, intestines, or colon. What you eat can also be a culprit.\n\nWhen should I call my doctor?\n\nIf you have occasional, mild diarrhea, there is probably no reason for concern. But if it lasts for more than 2 days and hasnât improved, you should call your doctor. If your infant or child has diarrhea, call your pediatrician.\n\nHow to Fix Digestive Issues\n\nFiber\n\nFiber is a natural part of plants. There are two types. Both are important and work in different ways.\n\nSoluble fiber dissolves in water, turning into a gel. Think of it as a sponge, soaking up fluid. Soluble fiber can help with diarrhea, which happens when there is too much water in your colon. It also slows the emptying of your stomach so you feel fuller longer, which can help you lose weight.\n\nSources include:\n\nApples\n\nCitrus fruits\n\nLentils\n\nNuts\n\nOatmeal\n\nPsyllium\n\nInsoluble fiber doesnât dissolve in water. Think of it as a broom: It helps keep food and waste moving through your body. Because insoluble fiber attracts water in your gut, it makes stools softer and easier to pass. Eating a diet rich in insoluble fiber can help with constipation.\n\nSources include:\n\nCarrots\n\nCauliflower\n\nLegumes\n\nPotatoes\n\nWhole grains\n\nWomen should get about 25 grams of fiber per day. Men should get 38 grams.\n\nIf you have trouble getting enough fiber from foods, your doctor may suggest you take fiber supplements.\n\nDrinking water\n\nWater is essential to good health and normal bowel function. Water also helps keep stools soft but solid and well-formed. Avoid drinking beverages such as coffee or soda if you think they trigger your digestive problems.\n\nProbiotics\n\nYour digestive tract is full of different kinds of bacteria. You may think that is a bad thing, but most of the bacteria in your gut are healthy. They break down toxins, help your body make some vitamins, and play a role in keeping you healthy. But when you have too much of some kinds of bacteria, you may get an illness or have unpleasant symptoms.\n\nProbiotics are like the healthy bacteria in your body. Eating foods that contain them, or taking probiotic supplements, can help keep a balance of good and bad bacteria in your body.\n\nExperts arenât sure exactly how they work, but probiotics may help:\n\nRelieve bloating from gas\n\nKeep you regular\n\nRelieve some types of diarrhea\n\nBoost your immunity\n\nFight infections\n\nPrevent harmful bacteria from growing in your stomach\n\nDestroy the bacteria that make you sick\n\nMake B vitamins your body needs"
