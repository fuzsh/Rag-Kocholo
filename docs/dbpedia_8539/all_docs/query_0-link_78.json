        "text": "How can I lower my chances of forming calcium oxalate stones?\n\nDrink enough fluids. The number one thing you can do is to drink enough fluids, like water. Drinking enough fluids will thin out your urine and make it harder for chemicals to build up and form crystals. Your healthcare provider will look at your overall health, diet, and lifestyle and recommend the right amount of fluid you should have each day.\n\nAvoid eating too much protein. Eating too many foods high in protein can cause stones to form.\n\nEat less salt (sodium). A diet high in salt (sodium) causes calcium to build in your urine. Too much calcium in your urine can lead to new stones. It can also cause your bones to weaken.\n\nInclude the right amount of calcium in your diet. Some people may think they can keep stones from forming by avoiding calcium, but the opposite is true. Calcium is a nutrient that is found in dairy products, such as yogurt, milk and cheese. You need to eat calcium so that it can bind with oxalate in the stomach and intestines before it moves to the kidneys. Eating foods with calcium is a good way for oxalates to leave the body and not form stones. The best way to get calcium into your body is through the foods you eat. It may seem easier to increase your calcium by taking a supplement. However, calcium in the form of a supplement may raise your chances of forming new calcium oxalate stones. Speaking with your healthcare provider will help you find the best way to include calcium in your diet. This will help avoid having too little or too much calcium in your body.\n\nAvoid vitamin C supplements. Talk to your healthcare provider before taking vitamin C supplements. Too much vitamin C can cause high amounts of oxalate in the urine.\n\nEat less oxalate-rich foods. Limiting how many oxalate-rich foods you eat each day may help lower your chance of forming new stones. There are some foods you should avoid because of their high oxalate levels. Some foods very high in oxalate are:\n\nNuts\n\nRhubarb\n\nBeets\n\nChocolate soy milk\n\nAll Bran®\n\nBuckwheat flour\n\nMiso\n\nTahini\n\nSesame seeds\n\nSwiss chard"
