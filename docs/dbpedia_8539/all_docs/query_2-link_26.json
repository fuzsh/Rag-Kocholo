        "text": "It happens to everyone from time to time after eating too much or eating something that doesnât agree with you. Your digestive system really feels it â and itâs not good.\n\nSymptoms may include diarrhea, constipation, bloating, gas or heartburn. The tough part about stomach and digestive issues is that it can make it hard to sleep, work or get through the day.\n\nâDigestive issues can be uncomfortable or embarrassing,â says Kaylan Graham, MD, an internal medicine physician at Scripps Clinic Carmel Valley. âPeople usually donât want to talk about them, even with their doctor. But these issues are often not serious and can even be prevented.â\n\nDigestive issues usually go away after a while but for some people they may be recurring symptomsÂ that need medical attention. Contact your primary care physician if you have digestive issues that wonât go away.\n\nWater helps your body flush waste and toxins, and helps your colon eliminate waste, which prevents constipation.\n\nThe amount of water you need every day may depend on numerous factors, such as activity level, geographic location and temperature. If you have questions about how much water you need per day, check with your doctor.\n\nâMake sure you also limit your alcohol consumption,â notes Dr. Graham. âAlcohol interferes with acid secretion and nutrient absorption. Too much alcohol can contribute to heartburn, diarrhea and liver issues."
