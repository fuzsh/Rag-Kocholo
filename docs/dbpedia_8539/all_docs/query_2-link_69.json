        "text": "Some sensitive medical concerns – like those involving your gastrointestinal tract – may need more specific care than your primary care doctor typically provides. You'll usually be referred to a gastroenterologist – a stomach doctor – by your primary care doctor. You should see a gastroenterologist if you have any symptoms of a digestive health disorder or if you need colon cancer screening.\n\nOften, seeing a gastroenterologist leads to more accurate detection of polyps and cancer, fewer complications from procedures and less time spent in the hospital.\n\nTo schedule an appointment, call 800-3-ADVOCATE or find a gastroenterologist online.\n\nWhat does a gastroenterologist do?\n\nA gastroenterologist treats you when you have diseases and conditions that affect your gastrointestinal (digestive) system and other parts of your body that interact with the digestive system. That includes your mouth, esophagus, stomach, small intestine, large intestine (colon), rectum, liver, pancreas, gallbladder and bile ducts. Like other doctors, they ask about your health history and any symptoms you may be having.\n\nGastroenterologists are stomach doctors and they use a variety of tests to diagnose gastrointestinal (GI) diseases and conditions, including minimally invasive ways to look at the inside of your esophagus, stomach, small intestine and large intestine. They may also order blood tests and stool tests to help them decide on a diagnosis.\n\nWhat is a gastroenterologist?\n\nA gastroenterologist is a doctor that has additional years of specialized medical training in diseases and conditions affecting the stomach, intestines, esophagus, liver, pancreas, colon and rectum. Our gastroenterologists have up to five additional years of training and significant experience with these gastrointestinal diseases and conditions.\n\nCommon symptoms\n\nYou should see a gastroenterologist if you're experiencing any of these common symptoms:\n\nSee a gastroenterologist if you have these specific symptoms\n\nOther, additional or more severe symptoms often indicate serious digestive health conditions. If you have any of the symptoms linked to the conditions below, you should schedule an appointment with a gastroenterologist.\n\nGet a colon cancer screening\n\nYou should see a gastroenterologist for a screening colonoscopy every 10 years, beginning at age 45. Depending on your family history and other potential risk factors, you may need earlier or more regular screening. Talk to your doctor about the best schedule for you.\n\nColonoscopies can detect colon cancer early, when it's easiest to treat. We've also simplified the process for you, offering direct access to the screening colonoscopy, which saves you time and money.\n\nIn addition to a colonoscopy, other tests can screen effectively for colon cancer, including fecal occult blood testing and sigmoidoscopy. Talk with your doctor about the risks and benefits of each of these procedures:"
