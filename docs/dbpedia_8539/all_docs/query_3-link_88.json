        "text": "The bowel is the lower part of the digestive system. The digestive system is also called the gut or gastrointestinal tract (or the GI tract or GIT for short).\n\nThe bowel goes from the stomach to the back passage (anus). It is a hollow muscular tube. It processes all the food we eat and breaks it down into nutrients for the body to use. It also gets rid of any solid waste matter from the body as poo (also called faeces or stools).\n\nThe bowel is divided into the small bowel (or small intestine) and the large bowel (colon and rectum).\n\nMost of the bowel problems caused by cancer are related to the large bowel. It is less common to get problems related to the small bowel.\n\nAbout the large bowel and small bowel\n\nThe large bowel\n\nThis includes the:\n\ncolon\n\nback passage (rectum)\n\nbowel opening (anus)\n\nThe parts of the colon are:\n\nthe ascending colon - runs up the right side of the abdomen. It is connected to the small intestine by a section of the bowel called the caecum\n\nthe transverse colon - runs across the body from right to left, under the stomach\n\nthe descending colon - runs down the left side of the abdomen\n\nthe sigmoid colon - an 'S' shaped bend that joins the descending colon to the rectum (back passage)\n\nThe small bowel\n\nThe small bowel is made up of 3 parts, these are the:\n\nduodenum (dew-oh-dean-um) - the top part of the small bowel, which connects to the stomach\n\njejunum (jej-you-num) - the middle part\n\nileum (ill-ee-um) - the lower part, which connects to the large bowel (colon)\n\nWhat is a normal bowel habit?\n\nHow often you have a bowel movement can vary from person to person. Normal for some people can mean having a poo a few times a day, for others it might mean having a poo a few times a week.\n\nYou can usually think of your bowel habit as normal if you:\n\nhave regular bowel movements (not necessarily once a day)\n\ndon’t have ongoing symptoms of constipation or diarrhoea\n\ncan have a bowel movement without straining or using laxatives\n\nWhat affects the bowel?\n\nHow your bowel works is affected by a number of different things:\n\nMuscles and nerves\n\nThe nerves and muscles in your back passage help you have normal bowel movements. So if treatment or illness damages these nerves or muscles, you might have some difficulty passing your poo.\n\nThe muscles in your tummy (abdomen) and your intestinal muscles also play a part in moving the poo down into your rectum.\n\nEating and drinking\n\nWhat you eat affects your bowel motions. Eating a diet high in fibre with lots of fresh fruit and vegetables helps to keep your poo soft and regular.\n\nYou need a certain amount of fluid in your body for your bowel to work properly. Fibre draws water into the bowel so you could get dehydrated if you don’t drink enough. This can make it difficult to pass poo. So it is important to drink plenty of water (about 6 to 8 glasses) each day.\n\nExercise\n\nA lack of daily exercise can reduce the muscle tone in your abdomen and bowel (intestines). This slows down the movement of poo through the gut. So taking regular exercise helps to keep your bowel working properly.\n\nAge\n\nAs we get older, the way our bowels work tends to change. As we age we can become less active and our diet may change. This can have an impact on bowel function.\n\nTablets and medication\n\nSeveral tablets or medicines to treat a range of conditions can cause bowel problems. These include pain relief tablets, iron tablets, and antibiotics.\n\nOther conditions\n\nConditions other than cancer can change the way your bowels work. This can include inflammatory bowel disease, piles (haemorrhoids) and infections. With the right treatment, your doctor can usually help control these conditions.\n\nHow cancer treatment affects the bowel\n\nBefore you start your treatment, your doctor will explain the possible side effects and how to manage them.\n\nDrug treatment\n\nConstipation and diarrhoea are common side effects of many drugs used as cancer treatments including chemotherapy, immunotherapy and targeted cancer drugs. Your doctor or nurse will talk to you about the side effects of any new drugs they prescribe for you.\n\nRadiotherapy\n\nRadiotherapy to the pelvic area or to the back passage (rectum) can cause diarrhoea. This usually comes on shortly after the treatment starts and can last for a few weeks or longer after your treatment ends. For some people, it might start after you finish your radiotherapy treatment.\n\nSpeak to your doctor, nurse, or radiographer they might give you medicines to slow down your bowel and try to prevent diarrhoea.\n\nSurgery\n\nYou might have constipation or diarrhoea after surgery. It may be due to the surgery you have. Or it may be because you are less active afterward or your diet has changed.\n\nLet your medical team know if you notice any of these side effects. They will be able to give you advice about how to treat them."
