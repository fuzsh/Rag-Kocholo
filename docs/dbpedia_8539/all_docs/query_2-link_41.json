        "text": "Stomach problems are typically related to the digestive tract and are the result of various conditions that affect digestion. However, symptoms such as gas, bloating, pain, vomiting, diarrhea, and constipation can also be due to conditions of the abdominal wall, blood vessels, urinary tract, reproductive organs, or even chest organs.\n\nGeneralized stomach problems may be due to diet, infection, or inflammation. In women, stomach problems may be related to the menstrual cycle, infection, or other conditions of the reproductive organs."
