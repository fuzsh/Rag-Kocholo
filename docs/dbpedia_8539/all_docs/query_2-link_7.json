        "text": "Digestive disorders affect millions of Americans each year. These conditions involve the digestive tract, which is also known as the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. The GI tract includes the esophagus, liver, stomach, small and large intestines, gallbladder and pancreas.\n\nDigestive disorders encompass a variety of diseases ranging from mild to severe. Common digestive disorders include gastroesophageal reflux disease, cancer, irritable bowel syndrome, lactose intolerance and hiatal hernia.\n\nThe most common symptoms of digestive disorders include bleeding, bloating, constipation, diarrhea, heartburn, pain, nausea and vomiting. Accurately diagnosing digestive disorders involves collecting a thorough medical history and conducting a physical examination. Some patients with digestive disorders may need more extensive diagnostic evaluations, including endoscopic procedures, lab tests and imaging."
