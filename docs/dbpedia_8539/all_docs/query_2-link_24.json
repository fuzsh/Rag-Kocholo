        "text": "What Are the Most Common Gastrointestinal Disorders?\n\nCommon digestive disorders include irritable bowel syndrom (IBS), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD or chronic heartburn), celiac disease, and diverticulitis.\n\nFive common diseases of the digestive system include:\n\nIrritable bowel syndrome (IBS)\n\nIBS is a \"functional\" disorder, because changes in the functioning of the digestive system cause the collection of symptoms referred to as IBS. IBS is a problem with the movement (motility) of the digestive tract rather than a result of damage to the tissues of the digestive system.\n\nInflammatory bowel disease (IBD)\n\nIBD refers to two conditions (Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis) characterized by chronic inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract that results in damage to the GI tract.\n\nGastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)\n\nAcid reflux is a condition in which the acid from the stomach backs up into the esophagus , which is the tube that carries food from the mouth to the stomach. When acid reflux occurs more than twice weekly, is chronic, or causes uncomfortable symptoms or damage, it is considered to be gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD ).\n\nCeliac disease\n\nAlso called gluten -sensitive enteropathy, celiac sprue , or non-tropical sprue, celiac disease is an autoimmune condition in which the immune system responds abnormally to a protein called gluten, leading to damage of the lining of the small intestine, which is responsible for absorbing food and nutrients. Damage to the lining of the small intestine can lead to malabsorption. Gluten is a protein found in wheat, rye, barley, and many prepared foods.\n\nDiverticulitis\n\nThis is a form of diverticular disease, which occurs when small pouches in the large intestinal (colonic) wall called diverticula, are present. These diverticula arise in the colon and push through weak spots in the colon’s outer muscle layers. Inflammation of the diverticula is called diverticulitis . Diverticular disease that is not inflamed is called diverticulosis.\n\nWhat Are Symptoms of 5 Common Diseases of the Digestive System?\n\nSymptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) include:\n\nAbdominal pain, often accompanying to bowel movements\n\nChanges in bowel movements, which may be diarrhea, constipation, or both, de pending on the type of IBS\n\nBloating\n\nFeeling as if a bowel movement is incomplete\n\nWhitish mucus in the stool\n\nSymptoms of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) include:\n\nPersistent diarrhea\n\nAbdominal pain\n\nRectal bleeding/bloody stools\n\nWeight loss\n\nFatigue\n\nSymptoms of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) include:\n\nHeartburn\n\nAcid and undigested food back up into the throat or mouth (regurgitation)\n\nStomach pain\n\nChest pain\n\nDifficulty swallowing\n\nFeeling as if food is stuck in the throat\n\nHoarseness/changes in voice\n\nSore throat\n\nUnexplained dry cough\n\nBelching\n\nNausea\n\nVomiting (may be bloody)\n\nBloating\n\nBloody or black stools\n\nUnexplained weight loss\n\nWheezing\n\nBad breath\n\nHiccups\n\nBreathing problems\n\nTooth erosion\n\nSymptoms of celiac disease include:\n\nDiarrhea\n\nWeight loss\n\nAbdominal discomfort\n\nExcessive gas\n\nBloating\n\nConstipation\n\nSigns and symptoms caused by vitamin and nutrient deficiencies\n\nSymptoms of diverticulitis include:\n\nAbdominal pain (most commonly in the left lower quadrant, may be severe)\n\nNausea\n\nVomiting\n\nConstipation (may be severe)\n\nDiarrhea\n\nBlood in the stool\n\nFever\n\nChills\n\nGas (flatulence)\n\nBloating\n\nRectal bleeding (rare)\n\nWhat Causes 5 Common Diseases of the Digestive System?\n\nThe cause of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is unknown but the brain-gut interaction (how the brain and gut work together) is thought to play a role.\n\nDifferent factors may play a role in causing IBS, including:\n\nGenetics\n\nBacterial infections in the digestive tract\n\nSmall intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO)\n\nFood intolerances or sensitivities\n\nStressful or difficult early life events, such as physical or sexual abuse\n\nMental disorders such as depression, anxiety, and somatic symptom disorder\n\nThe cause of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is unknown, but it is thought to be the result of a defective immune system. In IBD, the immune system responds incorrectly to environmental triggers, which results in inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract. There also seems to be a genetic component; people who have with a family history of IBD are more likely to develop this inappropriate immune response.\n\nGastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) occurs when the lower esophageal sphincter becomes weak or relaxes, causing stomach contents to back up into the esophagus.\n\nCauses of lower esophageal sphincter weakness or relaxation include:\n\nOverweight or obesity, which puts increased pressure on the abdomen\n\nPregnancy, which also increases pressure on the abdomen\n\nHiatal hernia\n\nSmoking or inhaling secondhand smoke\n\nCertain medicines\n\nAlcohol use\n\nLaying down after eating\n\nScleroderma\n\nThe cause of celiac disease is unknown but it is believed to be a result of a combination of environmental and genetic factors. Celiac disease is more common in Europe, North and South America, Australia, North Africa, the Middle East, and in South Asia, and occurs rarely in people from other parts of Asia or sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nThe cause of diverticulitis in Western countries is believed to be due to a high-fat and low-fiber diet .\n\nOther possible causes of diverticulitis include:\n\nStraining to have a bowel movement from constipation\n\nObesity\n\nLack of exercise\n\nSmoking\n\nGenetics\n\nUse of certain medications including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as aspirin, and steroids\n\nHow Are 5 Common Diseases of the Digestive System Diagnosed?\n\nDiseases of the digestive system are diagnosed with a patient history and a physical exam. Other tests that may be used to diagnose a specific condition or rule out other conditions include:\n\nBlood tests\n\nComplete blood count (CBC)\n\nLipid levels (total cholesterol, HDL , LDL, and triglycerides)\n\nThyroid levels\n\nAntibody levels\n\nNutritional deficiencies\n\nElectrolyte assays\n\nBlood cultures\n\nRenal function tests\n\nLiver enzyme and lipase levels\n\nUrinalysis\n\nUrine culture\n\nStool tests to check for blood in the stool or other signs of infections or diseases\n\nHydrogen breath test to check for other causes of digestive problems such as small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) or problems with carbohydrate digestion, such as lactose intolerance\n\nUpper GI endoscopy with a biopsy\n\nSmall intestine biopsy\n\nEsophageal pH and impedance monitoring\n\nEsophageal manometry\n\nColonoscopy\n\nImaging studies\n\nContrast radiography\n\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI)\n\nComputed tomography (CT)\n\nBone density (DEXA) scan\n\nComputed tomography (CT) scanning of the abdomen\n\nLower GI series (barium contrast enema , using water-soluble medium)\n\nAbdominal radiographic (X-ray) series\n\nA pregnancy test for females of childbearing age with abdominal pain\n\nWhat Is the Treatment for 5 Common Diseases of the Digestive System?\n\nIrritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is treated with:\n\nDietary changes: adding fiber, avoiding gluten, following a low FODMAP diet\n\nLifestyle changes: increasing physical activity, practicing stress reduction techniques, getting adequate sleep\n\nMedications used to treat IBS with diarrhea (IBS-D) may include:\n\nLoperamide (Imodium)\n\nRifaximin (Xifaxan)\n\nEluxadoline (Viberzi)\n\nAlosetron (Lotronex), only for women to be used with special warnings and precautions\n\nMedications used to treat IBS with constipation (IBS-C) may include:\n\nFiber supplements\n\nLaxatives\n\nLubiprostone (Amitiza)\n\nLinaclotide (Linzess)\n\nPlecanatide (Trulance)\n\nOther medications used to treat abdominal pain associated with IBS may include:\n\nAntispasmodics\n\nAntidepressants\n\nCoated peppermint oil capsules\n\nInflammatory bowel disease (IBS) is treated with:\n\nAminosalicylates\n\nCorticosteroids (such as prednisone)\n\nImmunomodulators\n\nBiologics\n\nVaccinations to prevent infections\n\nSurgery in severe cases to remove damaged portions of the gastrointestinal tract\n\nGastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) can be managed in some cases lifestyle changes or by taking non-prescription medicines to decrease the effects of stomach acid.\n\nHome remedies to relieve gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) include:\n\nLose weight if you are overweight or obese\n\nRaise the head of the bed 6 to 8 inches using blocks of wood or rubber under 2 legs of the bed or a foam wedge under the mattress\n\nAvoid foods that worsen symptoms such as coffee, chocolate , alcohol, peppermint, fatty or greasy foods, and spicy foods\n\nAvoid medications such as aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) that may aggravate GERD\n\nTake medications with plenty of water\n\nDon’t smoke\n\nDon’t overeat\n\nDon’t eat 2 to 3 hours before bed -- lying down with a full stomach can make reflux worse\n\nWear loose clothing around the stomach area\n\nIf lifestyle changes do not relieve symptoms GERD, medications to treat GERD include:\n\nAntacids\n\nHistamine blockers\n\nProton pump inhibitors (PPIs)\n\nProkinetics\n\nAntibiotics\n\nSurgery is used to treat severe cases of GERD.\n\nThe foundation of treatment for celiac disease is a gluten-free diet . Gluten is a group of proteins found in wheat, rye, and barley, and is also a hidden ingredient in many processed and prepared foods as well as medications and supplements.\n\nA dietitian knowledgeable about celiac disease can help patients learn about a gluten-free diet, what foods to eat and what foods to avoid to maintain nutritional balance. They can also advise on any needed nutritional supplements. People with celiac disease must strictly adhere to a gluten free diet because even small amounts of gluten can trigger or worsen symptoms.\n\nTreatment for mild diverticulitis includes:\n\nClear liquid diet for 2-3 days; progressing to a soft diet as tolerated\n\n7-10 days of oral broad-spectrum antibiotics if needed\n\nAcetaminophen (Tylenol) and antispasmodics for pain\n\nIn severe cases hospitalization may be needed. Severe diverticulitis may result in a perforation of the colon wall which may lead to an infection called an abscess. If hospitalized, treatment for severe diverticulitis may include:\n\nClear liquid diet; progress to a soft diet as tolerated\n\nIntravenous (IV) or oral antibiotics\n\nAbscesses less than 3 cm: Typically resolved with antibiotics\n\nAbscesses greater than 4 cm: Drain percutaneously\n\nPain management\n\nElective surgical resection\n\nReferences\n\nhttps://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/digestive-diseases/irritable-bowel-syndrome/\n\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/ibd/what-is-ibd.htm\n\nhttps://www.uptodate.com/contents/acid-reflux-and-gastroesophageal-reflux-disease-in-adults-the-basics\n\nhttps://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/digestive-diseases/acid-reflux-ger-gerd-adults\n\nhttps://www.uptodate.com/contents/celiac-disease-in-adults-beyond-the-basics\n\nhttp://emedicine.medscape.com/article/173388-overview\n\nhttps://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/digestive-diseases/diverticulosis-diverticulitis"
