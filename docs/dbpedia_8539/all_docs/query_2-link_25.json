        "text": "Do you ever feel like there’s a knot in your stomach when you’re worried or stressed? Or do you get butterflies in your gut when you’re nervous?\n\nIt’s not unusual. Stress, worrying and anxiety are common causes of stomach discomfort and other gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms. It’s usually temporary and not serious.\n\nHowever, chronic stress and anxiety can take a toll on the digestive system and could lead to more serious, long-term stomach problems.\n\nIf you regularly have an upset stomach, from stress or for any other reason, it’s important to tell your primary care physician. They can assist with reducing stress and identify symptoms of a chronic GI condition. They might also refer you to a gastroenterologist, who can determine if your stomach pain or GI symptoms are related to stress or another condition that requires different treatment.\n\nFind a Gastroenterologist\n\nWhy does stress cause stomach pain and discomfort?\n\nResearch has shown there is a strong connection between our brain and our digestive tract through the central nervous system.\n\nThe part of the central nervous system that serves the GI tract, called the enteric nervous system, makes a direct connection between the brain and GI system. In stressful or anxiety-provoking situations, it can cause normal physiologic processes to be interpreted as painful.\n\nThe brain-gut connection\n\nWhen we have anxiety and stress, hormones and neurotransmitters are released in the body. This can negatively impact gut motility, or the way our intestines and stomach squeeze and move waste through the body. Also, stress can affect the delicate balance of bacteria in our gut, causing an upset stomach.\n\nPeople with chronic stress and anxiety may overeat or eat unhealthy foods.\n\nSome of those foods, like products with high amounts of natural and artificial sugar, are often poorly digested and cause stomach discomfort. Chronic stress and anxiety can also lead people to smoke, consume more alcohol or drink large amounts of caffeine — all of which can also cause GI symptoms.\n\nHow do I know if my GI symptoms are associated with a temporarily stressful situation, or if it's a more serious condition?\n\nWarning signs like weight loss, blood in the stool, black tarry stools or abnormal blood tests (that can reveal anemia) can indicate that something more serious is occurring. Any chronic GI symptoms will likely warrant an evaluation from a GI specialist and additional testing.\n\nHow long can stress-related stomach pain last?\n\nIt shouldn’t last more than a few hours and should go away when the stressful situation ends. If your upset stomach lasts more than a day, it’s possible that something other than stress is causing your stomach pain and you should contact your doctor.\n\nCan stress cause bloating and diarrhea?\n\nStress can cause a wide range of GI symptoms, including bloating and loose stool. When you’re stressed, the nervous system sends signals to your gut and intestines, triggering the muscles involved in digestion to go into a “fight or flight” response. They can react by quickly pushing waste through your system, causing nausea, cramping, bloating or diarrhea.\n\nWhat settles an upset stomach?\n\nOver-the-counter antacids may provide temporary relief. Peppermint is also soothing to the stomach and is available as a capsule or in teas.\n\nWhat foods should you eat when your stomach is upset?\n\nIt’s best to avoid spicy foods, fatty or fried foods, junk food, and anything with a lot of natural or artificial sugar, such as sugary cereals, desserts and sodas. Plain foods like crackers, toast, rice, bananas, broth and water are good options until your stomach settles.\n\nShould I see a doctor if I get stomach pains when I am stressed?\n\nYou should see your primary care physician at least once a year, and you should tell them if you often have stomach problems or GI discomfort.\n\nCan anxiety cause long-term stomach problems?\n\nNormally, stress is temporary, so your GI issues will stop once the stress subsides. However, chronic anxiety can lead to chronic GI symptoms. Stress and anxiety alone do not cause ulcers or damage to the digestive tract, but they can cause ongoing bothersome symptoms. For people with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), stress and anxiety can cause flares of symptoms such as constipation, bloating and diarrhea. A gastroenterologist can help you treat these issues.\n\nHow do I stop stress-related stomach pain?\n\nIdentify your stress triggers. See if controlling the stress and anxiety in your life lessens your stomach discomfort. Be mindful of the foods you eat, which can compound anxiety-related stomach pains. Tell your doctor what’s going on so they can evaluate whether stress is actually what’s causing your upset stomach.\n\nHow do I reduce stress and anxiety?\n\nThere are both emotional and physical ways to reduce your stress and anxiety, including:\n\nBe active and avoid sitting for long periods of time\n\nTake a few deep breaths\n\nWhen doing a stressful activity, take short breaks\n\nGet at least 7 hours of sleep each night\n\nEat healthy foods and avoid junk food\n\nLimit alcohol intake\n\nSocialize and laugh\n\nSpend time outdoors\n\nTry a meditation app\n\nTalk to someone about what’s stressing you out, possibly a therapist or a social worker\n\nWhat conditions do gastroenterologists treat?\n\nGastroenterologists can evaluate for and treat a wide variety of conditions, including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), celiac disease, peptic ulcer disease and more. GI doctors also routinely perform screenings for colon cancer.\n\nMy area of specialty is in prevention and early detection of cancers such as colorectal, gastric and pancreatic cancer. I enjoy helping patients, especially those with a family history, understand their risk for cancer while offering genetic testing, screening and more.\n\nShould I be getting screened regularly for colon cancer or other GI tract cancers?\n\nAs of 2023, the United States Preventative Services Task Force and major GI medical societies recommend that adults at average risk for colorectal cancer begin regular screenings at age 45.\n\nPeople who have a family history of colorectal cancer or other GI tract cancers, including stomach or pancreas cancer, or a history of GI conditions like inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) may need routine cancer screening earlier than age 45.\n\nTalk your primary care physician about your risk and ask if you should get tested."
