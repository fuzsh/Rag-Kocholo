        "text": "What is magnesium?\n\nMagnesium is a mineral that is essential for healthy muscles, nerves, bones and blood sugar levels.\n\nWhat is magnesium deficiency?\n\nMagnesium deficiency is when your body does not get enough magnesium in your diet to function normally.\n\nRead more on magnesium and your health.\n\nWhat are the symptoms of magnesium deficiency?\n\nMagnesium deficiency can cause:\n\nlow appetite\n\nnausea and vomiting\n\nfatigue and weakness\n\nmuscle spasms or tremors\n\nabnormal heart rhythms\n\nWhat causes magnesium deficiency?\n\nMagnesium deficiency is rare in healthy people.\n\nIn some people, it can be caused by:\n\na diet that doesn't include enough sources of magnesium (especially in older people, or those who don't have enough to eat)\n\ntype 2 diabetes\n\ndigestive problems — such as Crohn's disease\n\nlong-term vomiting or diarrhoea\n\nkidney problems\n\nlong-term use of some medicines — such as diuretics or medicines for reflux\n\nalcoholism\n\nHow is magnesium deficiency diagnosed?\n\nMagnesium deficiency can be diagnosed with a blood test and/or a urine test. If you have symptoms of magnesium deficiency or abnormal calcium or potassium levels, your doctor may refer you for a blood or urine test.\n\nHow is magnesium deficiency treated?\n\nMagnesium deficiency is usually treated with magnesium supplements. Sometimes these can give you diarrhoea, so your doctor may need to adjust your dose. If your levels are very low, you may need magnesium through an intravenous (IV) drip in hospital.\n\nIf you are considering taking a magnesium supplement, speak to your doctor or pharmacist first, to make sure it's right for you.\n\nRead more on the role of foods high in magnesium and how supplements can prevent magnesium deficiency.\n\nMagnesium poisoning\n\nRarely, people experience magnesium poisoning, or toxicity, which is when they have too much magnesium. Symptoms of magnesium toxicity include vomiting, diarrhoea and abdominal (stomach) cramps. In extreme cases, too much magnesium can cause an irregular heartbeat and cardiac arrest (when the heart stops beating).\n\nMagnesium toxicity usually only happens if you take large quantities of magnesium in the form of magnesium supplements, antacids or laxatives. You can reduce the chance of this happening by taking medicines exactly as directed by your doctor or pharmacist.\n\nHow is magnesium deficiency prevented?\n\nTo prevent magnesium deficiency, eat a healthy, balanced diet containing magnesium-rich foods. These include:\n\nleafy green vegetables\n\nlegumes\n\nnuts and seeds\n\nwhole grains\n\nWhat are the complications of magnesium deficiency?\n\nHealth problems linked to magnesium deficiency are rare. If your magnesium levels are low for a long period of time, you may be at greater risk. This could be because of health conditions such as alcoholism or because you are taking certain medicines.\n\nIn the short-term, severe magnesium deficiency can lead to:\n\nmuscle spasms\n\nabnormal heart rhythms (arrhythmias)\n\ncardiac arrest\n\nLong-term magnesium deficiency can increase your chance of developing health problems, including:\n\nhigh blood pressure and heart disease\n\ndiabetes\n\nosteoporosis\n\nmigraine headaches\n\nResources and support"
