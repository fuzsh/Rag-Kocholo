        "text": "Was it that chicken you ate late at night or something else? Whether it’s indigestion, heartburn, nausea or gas, these symptoms are all commonly associated with an upset stomach. Doug Purdy, MD, gastroenterologist at UnityPoint Health, explains why tummy troubles happen and how to get relief.\n\nWhat Causes an Upset Stomach?\n\nAn upset stomach can be the result of several different factors and have a variety of symptoms, such as:\n\nConstipation\n\nNausea\n\nHeartburn\n\nIndigestion\n\nBloating\n\nConstipation\n\n“Constipation is typically defined as having less than three bowel movements in a week,” Dr. Purdy says.\n\nFeeling constipated isn’t uncommon, but for some people, it can be chronic and present a real problem, making daily tasks feel less enjoyable. The reason someone might be constipated varies greatly. Signs and symptoms often include:\n\nHaving stools that look like pebbles and are difficult to pass\n\nStraining while trying to have a bowel movement\n\nFeeling like you can’t empty your bowel near the rectum\n\nHow to get relief greatly depends on why you’re constipated, but Dr. Purdy says the following are often recommended to give your bowels some extra assistance:\n\nMoving your body. This increases the muscle activity in the colon.\n\nGetting more fiber. A good source is fresh fruits and vegetables.\n\nUsing a laxative. This can include stool softeners, suppositories, bower stimulants, fiber supplements and lubricants.\n\nTaking prescription medication. If you aren’t having luck with dietary changes and over-the-counter medication, your doctor may write a prescription that can help get things moving.\n\nNausea\n\nNausea is a symptom commonly associated with an upset stomach or uneasiness of the stomach. However, what causes nausea can sometimes be hard to pinpoint. Nausea is commonly caused by:\n\nGastroenteritis (Stomach flu)\n\nGERD (Acid reflux)\n\nPeptic ulcer disease\n\nGastritis\n\nMedications\n\nMigraine\n\nRotavirus\n\nMorning sickness\n\nMotion sickness\n\nFood poisoning\n\nDiet (junk food, overeating)\n\nSevere pain (pancreatitis, cholecystitis, kidney stones)\n\nNausea could also be a warning sign for certain medical conditions, such as:\n\nCrohn’s disease\n\nHeart attack\n\nAppendicitis\n\nIntestinal blockage\n\nMigraine\n\nHow to Get Rid of Nausea\n\nWhen feeling nauseous, the fastest way to relief is by taking an over-the-counter anti-nausea medication like Dramamine or Pepto-Bismol, but there are other things you can do as well, including:\n\nSipping clear or ice-cold drinks\n\nDrinking peppermint, chamomile or ginger tea\n\nEating slowly and smaller, more frequent meals\n\nGetting some fresh air by opening a window or stepping outside\n\nTrying to focus on something other than your nausea\n\nPutting an ice pack or cool, wet cloth on the back of your neck to decrease body temperature\n\nHeartburn\n\nDr. Purdy says heartburn feels like burning in your chest and is often worse after a meal or when bending over or lying down.\n\nWhat Causes Heartburn\n\n“The main cause of heartburn is acid reflux, which is the backup of stomach acid into a person’s esophagus,\" Dr. Purdy says. Factors that can contribute to heartburn include:\n\nEating meals too quickly\n\nOvereating\n\nPregnancy\n\nAlcohol, caffeine, chocolate\n\nFatty and greasy foods\n\nEating too close to bedtime\n\nWearing tight fitting clothes\n\nHeartburn Relief\n\nOccasionally experiencing heartburn is common and shouldn’t cause alarm.\n\n“In addition to adjusting your diet and making lifestyle modifications, your doctor may prescribe medication, called H2-blockers (Famotidine/Pepcid) or proton pump inhibitors (Omeprazole, Pantoprazole), to help suppress your stomach acid. If your heartburn doesn't start to subside once the medication kicks in and your diet has been modified, then it's time to talk to your doctor to see if further evaluation is needed,” Dr. Purdy says.\n\nIndigestion\n\nIndigestion, also called dyspepsia or upset stomach, is the discomfort a person feels in the upper part of their abdomen. They often experience feeling full soon after starting a meal or an uncomfortable fullness after a meal, discomfort or burning in their stomach and bloating.\n\nIndigestion can be triggered by medication, different foods and drinks. More specifically, it can be caused by:\n\nEating too quickly\n\nOvereating\n\nSpicy or greasy foods\n\nSmoking\n\nToo much caffeine, alcohol or chocolate\n\nAntibiotics, pain relievers and supplements\n\nSome medical conditions can cause indigestion, ulcers, gallstones, constipation or Celiac disease. Relief can come from eating smaller meals, eliminating caffeine and avoiding certain pain relievers.\n\nBloating\n\n“Bloating is when your abdomen (stomach) feels full, tight and uncomfortable with the sensation of having too much gas,” Dr. Purdy says. Bloating can cause abdominal pain that ranges from mild to moderate. Common causes of bloating include:\n\nCarbonated beverages\n\nEating too quickly\n\nConstipation\n\nGastrointestinal infection\n\nCeliac disease\n\nLactose/fructose intolerance\n\nIrritable bowel syndrome\n\nNatural Ways to Relieve Bloating\n\nCommonly, flatulence (farting), burping or having a bowel movement will help put an end to bloating. Other forms of relief for bloating include reducing your intake of gas-producing foods, including:\n\nBeans or lentils\n\nVegetables like broccoli, Brussel sprouts or asparagus\n\nCorn, pasta and potatoes, which are rich in starch\n\nLactose, which is a natural sugar in milk\n\nFructose, another natural sugar found in pears, wheat and some sodas\n\nSorbitol, an artificial sweetener\n\nFruits high in soluble fiber\n\nMost of these foods are healthy, so be sure to figure out what your troublemakers are so you can add nutrient-dense food back into your diet. Another great way to reduce bloating after eating is to move your body. Try going for a walk after your meal to help ease discomfort. If your bloating is persistent, talk to your doctor.\n\nOther Causes for an Upset Stomach\n\nThe build-up of gas in the intestines can be really uncomfortable for people and is another common reason for digestive distress. If you’re experiencing trapped gas that feels constant, and it’s interfering with your daily activities, talk to your doctor about pinpointing the cause, so you can find some relief.\n\nVomiting is another common by-product, and many times goes hand-in-hand with feelings of nausea. There are several reasons for vomiting ranging from issues such as motion sickness, overuse of alcohol to gastroenteritis (stomach flu) and allergic reactions. The color of your vomit can also be a telltale sign on an underlying health issue.\n\nGet Care Online with Virtual Urgent Care"
