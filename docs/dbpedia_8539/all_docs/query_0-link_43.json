        "text": "What it is\n\nNorovirus is a very contagious virus that causes vomiting and diarrhea.\n\nIt is sometimes called the \"stomach flu\" or the \"stomach bug.\" However, norovirus illness is not related to the flu. The flu is caused by the influenza virus. Norovirus causes acute gastroenteritis, an inflammation of the stomach or intestines.\n\nMost people with norovirus illness get better within 1 to 3 days; but they can still spread the virus for a few days after.\n\nKeep Reading: Norovirus Facts and Stats\n\nTypes\n\nYou can get norovirus illness many times in your life because there are many different types of noroviruses. Infection with one type of norovirus may not protect you against other types.\n\nIt is possible to develop protection against specific types. But it is not known exactly how long protection lasts. This may explain why so many people of all ages get infected during norovirus outbreaks.\n\nSigns and symptoms\n\nA person usually develops symptoms 12 to 48 hours after being exposed to norovirus.\n\nMost common symptoms: Diarrhea, vomiting, nausea, stomach pain\n\nOther symptoms: Fever, headache, and body aches\n\nDehydration\n\nIf you have norovirus illness, you can feel extremely ill, and vomit or have diarrhea many times a day. This can lead to dehydration (loss of body fluids), especially in young children, older adults, and people with other illnesses. Symptoms of dehydration include:\n\nDecreased urination\n\nDry mouth and throat\n\nFeeling dizzy when standing up\n\nCrying with few or no tears\n\nUnusual sleepiness or fussiness\n\nWho is at risk\n\nAnyone can get infected and sick with norovirus and people of all ages get infected during norovirus outbreaks. Your likelihood of getting a norovirus infection is also determined in part by your genes.\n\nIf eaten raw, oysters and other filter-feeding shellfish can contain viruses and bacteria that can cause illness or death. Anyone who consumes raw shellfish is at risk of contracting norovirus. Children younger than 5 years old, older adults, and people with weakened immune systems are more likely to develop severe infections.\n\nHow it spreads\n\nNorovirus spreads very easily and quickly in different ways. You can get norovirus by:\n\nHaving direct contact with someone with norovirus, like caring for them, sharing food or eating utensils with them, or eating food handled by them.\n\nEating food or drinking liquids that are contaminated with norovirus.\n\nTouching contaminated objects or surfaces and then putting your unwashed fingers in your mouth.\n\nYou can still spread norovirus for 2 weeks or more after you feel better.\n\nKeep Reading: How Norovirus Spreads\n\nPrevention\n\nNorovirus is very contagious, but you can take steps to protect yourself and others, including:\n\nWash your hands well and often.\n\nCook shellfish thoroughly and wash fruits and vegetables.\n\nClean and disinfect contaminated surfaces.\n\nWash laundry in hot water.\n\nStay home when sick for 2 days (48 hours) after symptoms stop.\n\nKeep Reading: How to Prevent Norovirus\n\nTesting and diagnosis\n\nDiagnostic methods for norovirus focus on detecting viral RNA (genetic material) or viral antigen. Diagnostic tests are available at all public health laboratories and many clinical laboratories.\n\nKeep Reading: Laboratory Testing for Norovirus\n\nTreatment and recovery\n\nMost people with norovirus illness get better within 1 to 3 days. There is no specific medicine to treat people with norovirus illness. Antibiotic drugs will not help treat norovirus infections because they fight bacteria, not viruses.\n\nKeep Reading: Facts About Antibiotic Use\n\nWatch for dehydration\n\nWatch for signs of dehydration (loss of body fluids) in children who have norovirus illness. Children who are dehydrated may cry with few or no tears and be unusually sleepy or fussy.\n\nDrink plenty of liquids\n\nIf you have norovirus illness, you should drink plenty of liquids to replace fluid lost from vomiting and diarrhea. This will help prevent dehydration.\n\nSports drinks and other drinks without caffeine or alcohol can help with mild dehydration. However, these drinks may not replace important nutrients and minerals. Oral rehydration fluids that you can get over the counter are most helpful for mild dehydration.\n\nSeek medical care for severe dehydration\n\nDehydration can lead to serious problems. Severe dehydration may require hospitalization for treatment with fluids given through your vein (intravenous or IV fluids). If you think you or someone you are caring for is severely dehydrated, call your doctor."
