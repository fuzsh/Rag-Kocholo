        "text": "Who gets stomach cancer\n\nStomach cancer is the fifth most common cancer worldwide. It is more common in countries in East Asia, Eastern Europe, and South and Central America than in the United States and other Western countries.\n\nAnyone can get stomach cancer. In the United States, the disease occurs more often among Black, Hispanic, Asian/Pacific Islander, and American Indian/Alaska Native individuals than among White individuals. Males are nearly twice as likely as females to be diagnosed with stomach cancer, and Black males are nearly twice as likely as White males to die of it. In recent years, stomach cancer rates have been increasing in younger females, particularly among Hispanic females. Stomach cancer can be diagnosed at any age, but the risk increases as a person gets older.\n\nRisk factors for stomach cancer\n\nThere are several risk factors for stomach cancer. Different risk factors may increase the risk of cancer in different parts of the stomach. For example, Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection increases the risk of cancer in the lower and middle part of the stomach, while obesity and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) increase the risk of cancer in the upper stomach.\n\nH. pylori infection\n\nChronic infection of the mucosal layer of the stomach with H. pylori is a major risk factor for stomach cancer. This bacterium spreads from person to person through direct contact with saliva, vomit, or stool. Although many people with chronic H. pylori infections do not have symptoms, some develop stomach ulcers or an inflammation of the stomach called atrophic gastritis. In some people, atrophic gastritis leads to increasingly severe changes in the stomach lining and eventually to stomach cancer or gastric MALT lymphoma (see What Is Stomach Cancer?). Treatment of H. pylori infections reduces the risk of these types of stomach cancer.\n\nOther medical conditions\n\nThe risk of stomach cancer is increased in people who have\n\nchronic atrophic gastritis (thinning of the stomach lining caused by long-term inflammation of the stomach)\n\natrophic gastritis with intestinal metaplasia (a condition in which the cells that line the stomach are replaced by cells that normally line the intestines)\n\nEpstein-Barr virus infection\n\npernicious anemia (an autoimmune condition in which the intestines canâ€™t properly absorb vitamin B12, resulting in a low red blood cell count)\n\nobesity (excess body weight)\n\ngastroesophageal reflux disease (a condition in which stomach acid repeatedly flows back into the esophagus)\n\nGenetics and family history\n\nThe risk of stomach cancer is increased, sometimes to very high levels, in people who have\n\na first-degree relative (parent, sibling, or child) who has had stomach cancer\n\na family cancer syndrome, such as\n\nfamilial adenomatous polyposis\n\nfamilial intestinal gastric cancer (FIGC), a type of stomach cancer that runs in families but does not have a known genetic cause\n\ngastric adenocarcinoma and proximal polyposis of the stomach (GAPPS) (To learn more, see GAPPS.)\n\nhereditary diffuse gastric cancer (HDGC) (To learn more, see HDGC.)\n\njuvenile polyposis syndrome\n\nLi-Fraumeni syndrome\n\nLynch syndrome (also called hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer and HNPCC)\n\nPeutz-Jeghers syndrome\n\nType A blood (To learn more, see the MedlinePlus page on blood types.)\n\nDiet\n\nEating a diet that is low in fruits and vegetables or that is high in salted, smoked, or poorly preserved foods may increase the risk of stomach cancer.\n\nTobacco use\n\nPeople who smoke have a higher risk of stomach cancer than nonsmokers. Smoking also makes treatment for H. pylori infection less effective. Smokers who stop smoking lower their risk of having stomach cancer over time. Learn about different tools to help you quit smoking and how to use them.\n\nEnvironmental and occupational exposures\n\nThe risk of stomach cancer is increased in people who\n\nwork in the rubber or coal industry\n\nhave been exposed to very high levels of radiation\n\nHaving one or more of these risk factors does not necessarily mean you will get stomach cancer. Many people with risk factors never develop stomach cancer, whereas others with no known risk factors do. Talk with your doctor if you think you might be at increased risk."
