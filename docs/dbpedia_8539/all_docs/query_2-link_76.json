Now, a global trial confirms that a widely available drug does prevent upper gastrointestinal ...\n\nScientists have discovered a previously unknown link between two key pathways that regulate the immune system in mammals -- a finding that impacts our understanding of chronic inflammatory bowel ...\n\nScientists have developed an artificial intelligence (AI)-powered system to track tiny devices that monitor markers of disease in the gut. Devices using the novel system may help at-risk individuals ...\n\nResearchers have analyzed how an antidiabetic treatment could help control the growth of tumors, potentially paving the way for the design of better cancer ...\n\nScientists have grown 'mini-guts' in the lab to help understand Crohn's disease, showing that 'switches' that modify DNA in gut cells play an important role in the disease ...\n\nWhen scientists transplanted the gut microbes of aged mice into young 'germ-free' mice -- raised to have no gut microbes of their own -- the recipient mice experienced an increase in ...\n\nResearchers have discovered a new biological pathway that is a principal driver of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and related conditions, and which can be targeted using existing ...\n\nStudy finds that mesalamine, a common anti-inflammatory drug, can fight the fungus Candida albicans in the gut, potentially preventing the risk of invasive candidiasis in patients with blood ...\n\nUlcerative colitis (UC) is an inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) that causes inflammation and ulcers (sores) in the digestive tract. Ulcerative colitis affects the innermost lining of the large ...\n\nA drug approved to treat certain autoimmune diseases and cancers successfully alleviated symptoms of a rare genetic syndrome called autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome type 1 (APS-1). Researchers ...\n\nCeliac disease is a chronic autoimmune condition that occurs in around one per cent of the world's population. It is triggered by the consumption of gluten proteins from wheat, barley, rye and ...\n\nIn the stomach, so-called parietal cells are responsible for acid production. They react not only to the body's own messenger molecules, but also to bitter-tasting food constituents such as ...\n\nResearchers have developed a protein-based gel that breaks down alcohol in the gastrointestinal tract without harming the body. In the future, people who take the gel could reduce the harmful and ...\n\nResearchers have identified molecular and genetic pathways that direct the generation and maturation of parietal cells, the only cells in the body that produce acid, from stem cells. The findings can ...\n\nA genetic propensity to higher circulating levels of lipids containing arachidonic acid, an omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acid found in eggs, poultry, and seafood, has been found to be linked with a ...\n\nResearchers discovered liver resident macrophages' pivotal role in defending against gut bacteria and related substances entering via the portal vein, particularly under compromised intestinal ...\n\nPeople who take acid-reducing drugs may have a higher risk of migraine and other severe headache than people who do not take these medications, according to a new study. The acid-reducing drugs ...\n\nStudy identifies key pathways underlying perianal fistula, a disease complication that is more prevalent and severe in African American ...\n\nIn a scientific breakthrough, researchers have revealed the biological mechanisms by which a family of proteins known as histone deacetylases (HDACs) activate immune system cells linked to ...\n\nDietary treatment is more effective than medications in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). With dietary adjustments, more than seven out of ten patients had significantly reduced ..."
