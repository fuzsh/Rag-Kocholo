        "text": "The stomach is located in the upper abdomen, connecting the esophagus to the small intestine. Part of the digestive system, the stomach stores swallowed food and begins the digestion process. Conditions of the stomach or abdomen that may require surgery include benign (non-cancerous) problems such as peptic ulcers, and complex problems such as stomach cancer, also called gastric cancer. Digestive issues are often treated with lifestyle changes and medication, but some stomach problems may require surgery.\n\nGeneral and gastrointestinal surgeons at Brigham and Womenâ€™s Hospital (BWH) offer highly effective treatment for patients with stomach conditions. Our board certified surgeons have a strong depth of surgical experience, performing thousands of minimally invasive surgical procedures each year.\n\nAs the surgeons for the Center for Esophageal and Gastric Cancer at Dana-Farber Brigham Cancer Center, we are part of a multidisciplinary team of oncology specialists dedicated to improving the care of patients with esophageal and gastric cancers.\n\nKnown worldwide for their skill at identifying and treating stomach conditions, our surgeons are faculty members at Harvard Medical School, and are active researchers who continually seek causes and investigate treatments. They are committed to training the next generation of surgeons through our Surgical Residency and Fellowship Programs."
