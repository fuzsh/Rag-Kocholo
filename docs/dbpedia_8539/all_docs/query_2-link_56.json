That's because anxiety and worry can upset the delicate balance of digestion.\n\nIn some people, stress slows down digestion, causing bloating, pain and constipation, while in others it speeds it up, causing diarrhoea and frequent trips to the loo. Some people lose their appetite completely.\n\nStress can also worsen digestive conditions like stomach ulcers and irritable bowel syndrome.\n\nManaging and reducing stress can help with your digestion.\n\nGet tips on managing stress\n\nStop smoking to prevent reflux\n\nSmoking can weaken the muscle that controls the lower end of the food pipe and allow acid from the stomach to travel in the wrong direction back up, a process known as reflux.\n\nReflux causes the symptoms of heartburn, and can bring on or aggravate stomach ulcers and inflammatory conditions of the bowel.\n\nSmoking is also an important risk factor for stomach cancer.\n\nFind out how to stop smoking"
