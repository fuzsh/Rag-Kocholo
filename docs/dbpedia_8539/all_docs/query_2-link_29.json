        "text": "The digestive system is a complex and important system in the human body. It is responsible for breaking down food, absorbing nutrients, and eliminating waste. Unfortunately, digestive diseases and disorders are common, affecting millions of people around the world.\n\nThere are many different diseases of the digestive system, ranging from mild to severe. Some common digestive disorders include:\n\n1. Lactose Intolerance\n\nLactose intolerance is a condition in which the body cannot digest lactose, a type of sugar found in milk and other dairy products.According to the Cleveland Clinic, about 36% of Americans have some degree of lactose intolerance.\n\nThis condition is caused by a deficiency of the enzyme lactase, which is responsible for breaking down lactose. Common symptoms of lactose intolerance include bloating, diarrhea, gas, and stomach pain. Though its symptoms can be distressing, luckily, this condition isn't dangerous.\n\n2. Celiac Disease\n\nCeliac disease is an autoimmune disorder that affects the digestive system. People with celiac disease cannot eat gluten, a type of protein found in wheat, barley, and rye.\n\nWhen people with celiac disease eat foods containing gluten, their immune system reacts by damaging the lining of the small intestine. This can lead to nutrient deficiencies, as well as a host of other symptoms such as abdominal pain, bloating, diarrhea, and fatigue.\n\nCeliac disease can be managed by making dietary changes that, over the past several years, have become easier to make. Many different kinds of food now have gluten-free alternatives, even in restaurants.\n\n3. Diverticular Disease\n\nDiverticulosis and diverticulitis are both conditions that occur in the large intestine, or colon. Together, they're known as diverticular disease.\n\nThese conditions involve diverticula, which are small, bulging pouches that form along the colon wall. Diverticulosis is simply the presence of these pouches, and it's very common, especially as we get older. In fact,diverticulosis affects 50% of people over age 60, and nearly everyone over the age of 80.\n\nDiverticulitis, on the other hand, is the inflammation and infection of one or more diverticula. This condition is less common, but it can be very serious. Symptoms of diverticulitis include abdominal pain, constipation, nausea, fever, cramps, and diarrhea.\n\nYour medical provider might recommend antibiotics and a clear liquid diet. A clear liquid diet consists of clear liquids like water, broth, and juices that are easy to digest. This diet gives your digestive system a rest while it heals, and luckily, is only a temporary change.\n\n4. Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS)\n\nIrritable bowel syndrome, also known as IBS, is a common functional gastrointestinal disorder that affects the large intestine. Functional gastrointestinal disorders are common, persistent, and recurring, but not caused by structural abnormalities like a tumor or mass. IBS is also a chronic condition, meaning it lasts for a long time, and while it can be managed, it can't be cured.\n\nIBS symptoms include abdominal pain, bloating, constipation, diarrhea, gas, changes in bowel movements, and feeling as if a bowel movement is incomplete. These symptoms can vary in intensity and frequency, and may come and go.\n\nThere is no one-size-fits-all approach to managing IBS, as different people will respond to different treatments. However, some common management strategies include making dietary changes, taking medications, and practicing stress-relieving methods like yoga or meditation.\n\n5. Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD)\n\nDespite having a similar name, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) isn't the same as irritable bowel syndrome. IBD is a group of chronic inflammatory disorders that affect the digestive system. People with a family history of IBD are more likely to be affected by it, but the exact cause is unknown.\n\nThe two most common types of IBD are Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Crohn's disease can affect any part of the digestive system, from the mouth to the anus. Ulcerative colitis, on the other hand, only affects the large intestine and rectum.\n\nBoth Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are characterized by inflammation of the digestive tract lining. This inflammation can lead to a variety of symptoms including abdominal pain, diarrhea, fatigue, weight loss, and malnutrition.\n\nThere is no cure for IBD, but there are treatments that can help manage the symptoms and prevent flares. These treatments include medications, surgery, and lifestyle changes.\n\n6. Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD)\n\nGastroesophageal reflux disease, also known as GERD and chronic acid reflux, occurs when stomach acid repeatedly flows back into the esophagus. The esophagus is the tube that connects the mouth to the stomach, and it's lined with a muscle called the lower esophageal sphincter (LES). The LES is supposed to keep stomach contents in the stomach, but in people with GERD, it doesn't work properly, allowing acid and other stomach contents to reflux back up into the esophagus.\n\nOn top of acid reflux, a person with GERD may experience symptoms like heartburn, chest pain, and trouble swallowing. Though GERD is a chronic condition, it can be managed with lifestyle changes and medications. Some people may also need surgery.\n\nVisit the Gastroenterology Experts at Prima CARE\n\nAtPrima CARE, we're proud to provide our patients with high-quality, compassionate care.
