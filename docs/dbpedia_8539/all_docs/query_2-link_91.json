        "text": "What is gastroenteritis?\n\nGastroenteritis (also known as ‘gastro’) is a common and very contagious infection of the gut (the stomach and intestines). It causes inflammation of the lining of your digestive system. Gastro usually causes a mild illness that involves vomiting, diarrhoea, stomach pains and nausea.\n\nOlder people, young children and those with a weakened immune system are at a higher risk of developing more severe symptoms.\n\nWhat causes gastroenteritis?\n\nGastro may be caused by:\n\nviruses are the most common cause, including rotavirus and norovirus\n\nbacteria, such as salmonella, campylobacter\n\ntoxins produced by bacteria such as clostridium difficile\n\nparasites, such as giardia and cryptosporidium\n\nViruses that cause gastro are very contagious. They are found in human faeces (poo). Viral gastro spreads when you have contact with infected vomit or faeces.\n\nViral gastro can spread through:\n\ncontaminated food, drinks or objects\n\nperson to person contact — coughing, sneezing or shaking hands with someone who is sick and has virus on their hands\n\nSome bacteria and parasites that cause gastro are found in contaminated food or water — this is sometimes called ‘food poisoning’. Food poisoning symptoms usually begin 6 to 12 hours after eating spoiled food.\n\nGastro caused by vlostridium difficile (also known as ‘c. diff’) usually results from antibiotic use. Clostridium difficile commonly lives in the gut of many people in small amounts without causing problems. Taking antibiotics can reduce the variety of bacteria that live in your gut — both those that cause symptoms and healthy or ‘good’ bacteria. This results in an imbalance in your gut bacteria that give clostridium difficile the opportunity to multiply more than usual and cause symptoms.\n\nRead more on gut health.\n\nShould I keep my child home from school?\n\nHere’s a list of common childhood illnesses, including gastroenteritis, and their recommended exclusion periods.\n\nWhat are the symptoms of gastroenteritis?\n\nIf you have gastro, you may have some of these symptoms:\n\nnausea and vomiting\n\ndiarrhoea\n\nstomach pains and cramping\n\nfever, body aches, weakness, tiredness\n\nheadaches\n\nloss of appetite\n\nVomiting usually lasts 1 to 2 days. Diarrhoea usually lasts around 1 to 3 days, but can last up to 10 days.\n\nIf you have severe gastro, you may:\n\nbe unable to keep down any fluids\n\npass less urine (wee)\n\nfeel faint when you stand up\n\nCHECK YOUR SYMPTOMS — Use the Symptom Checker and find out if you need to seek medical help.\n\nWhen should I see my doctor?\n\nAdults and older children\n\nYou should see your doctor if you have:\n\nsevere abdominal (tummy) pain that is getting worse\n\nfrequent vomiting or diarrhoea\n\nblood or mucus in your poo\n\na fever\n\nsigns of dehydration for example, passing little or no urine, urine that is dark or smelly or feeling faint or dizzy when standing\n\nother symptoms that concern you\n\nYoung children\n\nYour young child should see a doctor if they:\n\nare less than 6 months old\n\nare less than 3 years old and have a fever over 38.5℃\n\nweight less than 8kg\n\nwere born prematurely, or have other health problems\n\npass blood in their poo, have dark green vomit or have severe stomach pains\n\nare unable to keep food or fluids down without vomiting\n\nare not getting better, or you are worried\n\nYou should also take your child to a doctor if they have symptoms of significant dehydration, such as:\n\nexcessive sleepiness or drowsiness\n\nsevere thirst\n\nless than 4 wet nappies a day\n\ncold hands and feet\n\ndry lips and tongue\n\nsunken eyes and/or fontanelle\n\nfast breathing\n\nFIND A HEALTH SERVICE — The Service Finder can help you find doctors, pharmacies, hospitals and other health services.\n\nHow is gastroenteritis diagnosed?\n\nYour doctor can diagnose gastro by examining you and ask about your symptoms. If you’re not getting better, your doctor may recommend a stool (poo) test to check what is causing your illness.\n\nASK YOUR DOCTOR — Preparing for an appointment? Use the Question Builder for general tips on what to ask your GP or specialist.\n\nHow is gastroenteritis treated?\n\nIf your gastro is caused by bacteria or parasites, they may prescribe antibiotics. Viral gastroenteritis does not need antibiotics. Read more on the differences between bacterial and viral infections.\n\nMost people recover from gastro on their own without needing treatment from a doctor.\n\nIf you become severely dehydrated, you may need fluids in an intravenous drip.\n\nTips to manage gastro symptoms:\n\nDrink plenty of fluids to avoid dehydration. Sip clear fluids every 5 to 10 minutes. These help replace fluids lost by vomiting and diarrhoea. Avoid drinks that are high in sugar, as they can make diarrhoea worse.\n\nEat if you feel hungry. Start with bland foods such as crackers, rice, clear soup, a banana or dry toast.\n\nRest as much as you can.\n\nContinue breastfeeding as normal.\n\nSek medical advice before taking anti-nausea or anti-diarrhoea medicines. Do not give anti-diarrhoea medicines to children.\n\nBabies and children with gastro\n\nThe most common and serious complication of gastro in babies and children is dehydration. Children with health problems may become dehydrated more quickly.\n\nIf your baby is under 6 months of age, take them to a doctor if you think they have gastro. If they are older, it is still a good idea for them to be checked in case they are dehydrated.\n\nIf you cannot find rehydration fluids, or your child refuses to drink them, try diluted fruit juice (1 part juice to 4 parts of water). You can also try a cube of ice or an iceblock\n\nIt’s important to continue to breastfeed your baby. Your baby may need to feed more frequently. You can also give rehydration fluid between feeds, if your baby needs to drink more. If you are feeding your baby with formula, give them the usual amount of formula, and then give them rehydration fluids if they’re still thirsty.\n\nMany medicines that are commonly used by adults or older children to stop vomiting or diarrhoea can be dangerous for babies. Make sure to ask your doctor or pharmacist before giving your baby any medicines.\n\nOlder people with gastro\n\nOlder people are at a higher risk of having complications from gastro. They are at a higher risk of becoming severely dehydrated, and are more likely to need an intravenous (IV) fluid drip to replace fluids lost from diarrhoea or vomiting.\n\nGastro outbreaks are common in aged-care facilities. Older people may also experience symptoms that mimic gastro, such as those caused by conditions such as chronic bowel disease or medicines.\n\nCan gastroenteritis be prevented?\n\nHere is how you can reduce the chance of spreading gastro:\n\nIf you have been sick with gastro and work in health care, residential or aged care or the food industry, do not go to work until 48 hours after your last episode of vomiting or diarrhoea.\n\nWash and dry your hands after using the bathroom, changing nappies, cleaning up vomit or diarrhoea and before eating or preparing food.\n\nWash clothing or bedding contaminated with vomit or diarrhoea using detergent and hot water. Clean bathrooms and toilets often.\n\nDo not share your towels, face washer, toothbrush, drinkware or cutlery.\n\nAvoid preparing or handling food for others while you are unwell.\n\nIf you think your illness has been caused by food, report it to your local council’s health department. Keep leftovers for testing.\n\nYou can reduce your chance of catching gastro:\n\nAvoid contact with people with gastro.\n\nStore and cook foods according to health regulations.\n\nTake care when handling animals and their faeces (poo) and urine (wee).\n\nHandle and prepare raw and cooked foods separately and cook well.\n\nIf you are travelling to places with poor hygiene or where the local tap water is not safe to drink, here are some tips:\n\nOnly use bottled water for drinking and brushing your teeth.\n\nDon't put ice in drinks.\n\nEat fruit you can peel yourself.\n\nAvoid uncooked foods, including salads.\n\nChildren and vaccination for rotavirus\n\nRotavirus is a virus that causes severe gastroenteritis in babies and young children. All young children should receive the rotavirus vaccine at 2 months of age (6 to 8 weeks old) and 4 months of age. A third dose at 6 months of age may be needed, depending on the brand of vaccine used.\n\nThis vaccine is effective in preventing rotavirus infection in about 7 out of every 10 children vaccinated. Read more on immunisation and vaccinations for your child.\n\nResources and support\n\nDownload Sydney Children’s Hospital factsheets on gastroenteritis in children — in English, Chinese, Greek and Italian.\n\nVisit the GESA (Gastroenterological Society of Australia) website, where you can find more information on gastro in kids.\n\nFor tips about staying hydrated, see drinking water and your health.\n\nDo you prefer to read in languages other than English?"
