        "text": "The most common symptoms of stomach cancer include:\n\ndifficulty swallowing (dysphagia)\n\nunexplained weight loss\n\ntummy pain\n\nindigestion (dyspepsia) that doesn't go away\n\nfeeling full after eating small amounts\n\na loss of appetite\n\nfeeling or being sick\n\ndark poo\n\ntiredness due to low levels of red blood cells (anaemia)\n\nSome people might not have any symptoms of their anaemia. You might have a blood test for something else, which picks up on this.\n\nSymptoms of early stomach cancer can be similar to the symptoms of other conditions, such as stomach ulcers.\n\nDifficulty swallowing (dysphagia)\n\nYou might feel pain or a burning sensation when you swallow, or your food may stick in your throat or chest. Other conditions could cause these symptoms, but it is important to get these checked by your doctor.\n\nWeight loss\n\nThis is weight loss when you are not trying to lose weight. This could be due to:\n\na loss of appetite\n\nfeeling full after eating small amounts\n\nPain\n\nYou may have pain in your tummy (upper abdomen) or behind your breastbone (sternum).\n\nIndigestion (dyspepsia) that doesn't go away and burping\n\nYou can get indigestion when acid from the stomach goes back up (refluxes) into the food pipe (oesophagus). Or you can get it if you have irritation in your stomach. Symptoms include:\n\nbeing bloated\n\nfeeling or being sick\n\npain or discomfort in your chest or tummy\n\na burning feeling in your chest (heartburn) after eating\n\nRemember, indigestion is common and is not usually caused by cancer. Indigestion and heartburn can be very painful, even if nothing is seriously wrong. See your doctor if these symptoms don't go away. Also talk to your doctor if anything you take for indigestion stops working.\n\nFeeling and being sick\n\nStomach cancer can cause a blockage in the stomach. This stops food from passing through your digestive system and can make you feel or be sick.\n\nRarely, there is blood in the vomit. This might be bright red, which means it is fresh bleeding. Or it may look dark brown, like used coffee grounds, if the blood has been in the stomach for a while.\n\nDark poo (blood in your stool)\n\nEarly and advanced stomach cancer can bleed into the stomach. Over time this reduces the number of red blood cells in your blood (anaemia).\n\nYour poo may be darker – almost black – if your stomach is bleeding. Your poo can also be darker if you're taking iron tablets.\n\nFeeling tired and breathless\n\nThis can be because you have a reduced number of red blood cells (anaemia)."
