        "text": "Diagram of Stomach with labels gives us an understanding of the stomach’s anatomy as well as its physiology. The stomach is a hollow organ that is part of the gastrointestinal system, present in the upper left part of the abdomen. The diagram of stomach in human body shows its functions as the formation of chyme, synthesis of proteins necessary for vitamin absorption (e.g. pepsin), microbial defences, and propagation of the peristaltic reflex. The diagram of stomach class 10 is an important diagram for the board examinations, hence studying it properly becomes crucial.\n\nThe labelled diagram of stomach organ with layers is given below:\n\nWhat is Stomach?\n\nThe stomach diagram shows a muscular, J-shaped hollow organ in the upper abdomen on the left side of the body. It is a part of the gastrointestinal system. The stomach produces acid and enzymes that help in the digestion of food. An adult’s stomach is usually about 12 inches long and 6 inches across when empty. There are four parts of the stomach, namely, Cardia, Body, Antrum, and Fundus.\n\nThe diagram of stomach layers shows the inner layer called the mucosa which is lined with glands that secrete digestive juices. The middle layer is called the muscularis, and it is made up of muscle fibers that churn and mix the food. The outer layer is called the serosa, and it is a thin layer of tissue that protects the stomach. The stomach is an essential organ for digestion, and it plays an important role in overall health.\n\nParts of Stomach\n\nThe stomach diagram shows the various parts of the stomach. These are:\n\nCardia is the top and first part of the stomach, which is connected to the esophagus and it contains the cardiac sphincter, which prevents food from traveling back up your esophagus. .\n\nFundus is a rounded section next to the cardia (on the left side), below to the diaphragm.\n\nBody (corpus) is the largest and main section of the stomach. Here, the stomach contracts, and thus mixing of food occurs.\n\nAntrum lies below the body. It holds the food, until the food becomes ready to send to the small intestine.\n\nPylorus is the bottom part of the stomach. It has the pyloric sphincter.\n\nThe opening of the stomach is guarded by Cardiac Sphincter while the Pyloric Sphincter marks the end of the Stomach. Both Sphincters are circular muscles that open and close passages in the body to regulate the flow of food.\n\nAlso Read: Difference Between Small Intestine And Large Intestine\n\nFunctions of Stomach in Digestive System\n\nFollowing are the functions of stomach:\n\nThe major function of the stomach is to store and digest the food and liquids we intake.\n\nIt produces hydrochloric acid which helps in digesting food and killing foreign substances like bacteria.\n\nThe stomach helps in absorption of minerals like phosphate, calcium, and iron.\n\nThe stomach muscles contract at regular intervals to churn the food ingested and makes the digestion process for other parts easier.\n\nStomach releases enzymes like pepsin (secreted by chief cells as an inactive zymogen called pepsinogen, which is converted into pepsin by the action of HCl), gastric amylase, and gastric lipase, which helps in the absorption of proteins, simple sugars, and lipids (lipid digestions starts from here).\n\nConclusion – Diagram of Stomach\n\nIn short, the diagram of stomach and parts shows the position of the different parts of the stomach, namely, Cardiac, Fundus, Body, and Pylorus, which helps in understanding the stomach in much detail. Also, it helps us in understanding the shape of the stomach, which is J shaped, and how it is connected with the other major organs of the digestive tract. This helps the study of anatomy and physiology of stomach in much detail.\n\nAlso Read:\n\nStomach\n\nDiagram of Digestive System\n\nOverview of Digestive System\n\nWhat is the Role of Acid in our Stomach?\n\nHuman Digestive System\n\nFAQs on Diagram of Stomach\n\nWhat is Stomach?\n\nA stomach is a part of digestive systems which secretes acids and enzymes and helps in the digestion of the food materials. It is a bag-like muscular organ found on the upper abdomen on the left side of the body.\n\nWhat is the Shape of Stomach?\n\nThe Stomach is J-shaped muscular hollow organ.\n\nWhere can I Find Diagram of Stomach?\n\nYou can find the diagram of Stomach in the top of this article.\n\nWhat does the Diagram of Stomach Class 10 Depicts?\n\nThe diagram of stomach depicts the different parts of the stomach and helps in studying the stomach more concisely.\n\nWhich Acid is Secreted by Stomach and What’s it Function?\n\nStomach secrete Hydrochloric acid (HCl) from gastric parietal cells. The HCl functions are – Digestion of food, Mineral Absorption(mainly phosphate, calcium, and iron), Activates several enzymes, and Kills Bacteria.\n\nWhat is the Function of Pylorus?\n\nPylorus send the food into the duodenum and it is guarded by the pyloric sphincter which prevents the backflow of the food.\n\nWhat are the 4 Main Functions of the Stomach?\n\nThe four main functions of the stomach include storing food, mixing it with digestive juices, breaking down proteins, and regulating the release of chyme into the small intestine.\n\nWhat are the Parts of Stomach?\n\nThe stomach consists of four main parts: the cardia, fundus, body, and pylorus."
