        "text": "I immediately thought of Theroux’s book. For all the recent commentary about how Ghost Train is a reflection of that famous travel book he wrote all those years ago, this book also is not. Ghost Train would exist even if Bazaar had never been written. Ghost Train is less a book about a voyage than it is about a place in life. A place in life when one realizes that life has mostly been lived, that the great acts have happened, that to look out on the world again from the window of a train is to see the world as it will be when you leave it, a world that is largely the same. To quote Meinke, “For God’s sake get on with it.” Neither Meinke nor Theroux are talking about the trip.\n\nOn the surface, this is a book about traveling on trains. About the people you are forced to rub elbows with, about the stations on the siding in the middle of nowhere with a single bulb burning in the darkness. Early in the book, Theroux writes,\n\nThis  the closed compartment on the old train to Azerbaijan  was something else. Travel means living among strangers, their characteristic stinks and sour perfumes, eating their food, listening to their dramas, enduring their opinions, often with no language in common, being always on the move towards an uncertain destination, creating an itinerary that is continuously shifting, sleeping alone, inventing the trip, cobbling together a set of habits in order to stay sane and rational, finding ways to fill the day and be enlightened, avoiding danger, keeping out of trouble, and, immersed in the autobiographical . . . writing everything down."
