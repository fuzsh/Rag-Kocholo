        "text": "The Midnight Ghost Train understand that theyâll find it difficult to survive in the avalanche of stoner-doom bands in existence these days, so theyâve taken a step back, dressed themselves in a morose southern armor, and decorated their largely hard-rock vehicle with funk, country, blues, stoner and sludge. Consisting of gravel-throated vocalist and guitarist Steve Moss, bass twanglist Alfred Jordan, and the tremendously titled drummer Brandon Burghart, one may expect a rather straightforward sound from this Topekan trio. And straightforward their sound once was. But now, released from the shackles, The Midnight Ghost Train, with more than a smidgen of self-deprecation, have integrated a swathe of musical elements into their sound for Cypress Ave, their fourth full-length.\n\nCompared to their last album, Cold Was The Ground, the sludge elements, mainly found in the deep growls of vocalist Steve Moss, and the Sabbath darkness, have taken a back seat. Thatâs not to say this isnât a heavy record, it just reaches into the dark recesses of music from different angles. The Midnight Ghost Train are the depressed, world-weary older brothers of Clutch: jaded with the world and painfully aware of their fading mortality yet still clinging to the glory of the party – conflicted. The groove and funk still runs through their veins but the pent-up anger channeled through their sludge sound has settled; their sound mostly simmers now: a grim steadiness guided by blues starkness and vulnerable lyrics. Opener âTonight,â for example, carries a subdued and dry tone with Moss groaning about the disharmonious relationships with a once-close lover. âThe Watchers Nestâ evokes Jimmy Page at the start before seeping into glum and gruff passages of lamentation and self-loathing: âAnd Iâm going down/Down into the lightâ Moss dirges. These stark confessional vocals occur throughout, even seeping into existence during the funkier stoner moments. The lyrics are a focal point, as with most blues rooted sounds, and they guide the songs well.\n\nBut, of course, weâre a metal site; whereâs the damn metal I hear you complain. There are enough moments of heavy groove to satisfy those thirsty for fuzz. âRed Eyed Junkie Queenâ channels the trio of stoner-doom bosses as Kyuss-esque bass tones, funky Clutch-esque semi-rapped verses, and bombastic Melvins-esque chrorusâ merge with aplomb. With a slick guitar tone like race cars pulsing past at hyper-speed âBury Me Deepâ grooves with satisfying fuzz and swaggering drums, cemented by Mossâ textured drawl. In âLemon Treesâ the funk begins to flourish yet the fuzz remains to envelop with the song in a mist of angst. Jordanâs bass, expressive and prominent throughout, sings as limp-wristed guitar chords drift between. A second guitar begins to harmonize with the first as the song intensifies at the 2:35 mark. Itâs succinct yet excellently layered, exploding at 3:28 as King Buzzo-essque hoarseness and warping guitars merge to end the song. A strength of the album is the mostly succinct construction of songs, though âThe Watcherâs Nestâ and closer âThe Echoâ outstay their welcome by two-or-three minutes.\n\nVariety, however, is the albumâs strongest point, and though it might upset some, The Midnight Ghost Train are better when rooted in hard-rock and blues rather than sludge and doom. âBreak My Loveâ is a pure country-blues track: a stand-up bass, rusty drums, and crackled vocals merge with wonderfully dynamic crispness. âThe Boogey Down [feat. Sonny Cheeba]â is a purely funk-rap romp. Trombones, trumpets, the funkiest bassline this side of Funkadelic, and – Iâm sorry black-metal purists – rapped verses from Sonny Cheeba, make this the most lively and upbeat song on the album. âBlack Wave,” though, is the black to the white of âThe Boogey Down.â Depressing and confessional, the bass weeps like tar-covered willows and fragile guitars ready to snap combine with the subtlest use of synths. Itâs the soundtrack to a hip film adaptation of a Faulkner of McCarthy novel. âThe Echoâ follows with much of the same, adding little but length to the album.\n\nMy issue is with the subdued nature of the album; I just want to see songs completely disentangle and fall into hazy, messy, violent territories with vocals turning to screams and riffs turning to avalanches. There is a clinical nature to the album that Iâm not hugely fond of. There are many excellent moments here, though. Songs are well constructed, the album is varied, and it flows well. However, Iâm left feeling like The Midnight Ghost Train have left a bit of magic in reserve.\n\nRating: 3.0/5.0\n\nDR: 8 | Format Reviewed: 192 kbps mp3\n\nLabel: Napalm Records\n\nWebsite: facebook.com/themidnightghosttrain\n\nReleases Worldwide: July 28th, 2017"
