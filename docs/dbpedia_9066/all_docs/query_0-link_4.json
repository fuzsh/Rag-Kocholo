TMGT consistently toured the U.S. and Europe from their formation in 2008 to their separation in 2018. Their energetic live show being the staple of the band. They were signed to the Austrian based label, Napalm Records.\n\nThe Midnight Ghost Train is coming back for a European Reunion Tour in June 2022!\n\nSons Of Node\n\nSons of Node is a three piece sludgy band based in Utrecht, The Netherlands. Foul & dissonant riffage combined with a bass sound as huge as a mammoth, backed by massive “brick in your face” drums is what they’re all about. All three of the hairy bastards top it off with their vocals, each one of them with their own style. Sons of Node’s sound might remind you of bands like Eyehategod & Kylesa"
