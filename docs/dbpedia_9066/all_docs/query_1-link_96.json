        "text": "Sadly, Ghost Train has not operated since 2018–we hope they return in the future.\n\nThe Ghost Train is the perfect family friendly haunt, operating on a Disney-level of scares, as audiences ride passively along a double loop track to view over 30 gorgeous Halloween scenes.\n\nLos Angeles in Griffith Park\n\nAudience rides on a 1/8th scale train through multiple haunt displays\n\nDisney-esque spooky themes, but not scary\n\nNo contact, no live actors, no jump scares, no blood, & no gore\n\nReminiscent of a dark ride with animatronics\n\nImpressive scale, lighting, and overall artistry\n\nFor information on any upcoming Ghost Train events, please scroll down or check our events page, map, or calendar!\n\nDuring the month of October, the Los Angeles Live Steamers Railroad Museum (LALSRM) transforms their massive maze of railroad tracks and buildings into a Halloween wonderland. Guests straddle 1/8th scale trains and take a 20 minute ride through this beloved Halloween attraction. This event is designed to be spooky, yet family friendly and not scary, with the train taking audiences through about 30 professionally designed displays enhanced with special lighting, animatronics, music, sounds, projections, fog, and pyrotechnic effects. They are wonderful for children and adults alike.\n\nSome displays include a witches’ mansion, a 350-lbs dragon that breathes actual fire, a trip down an abandoned mine, a contaminated radioactive zone, an impressively large Tesla Coil, and carnivorous plants similar to Little Pet Shop of Horrors. None of these zones contain any blood, gore, or heavy scares–there’s actually no live actors. Instead, audiences will be entranced by the scope, scale, and length of the experience in total. It’s perfect for adults and kids alike.\n\nTickets are $25 per person with express tickets at $30 dollars–and while online tickets may state that they are sold out–don’t worry, there are plenty of tickets available at the door. The online tickets are limited, with the majority being sold at the door; and even better, as long as you are in line before closing time, you will get to ride the ghost train. Prepare for long lines, especially on weekends, as they can be 2-3 hours on busy evenings. But trust me, it’s worth the wait.\n\nThis event runs for multiple weekend nights and is LA Live Steamer’s annual fundraiser. Children must be at least 34” tall to ride. This is the perfect event to bring your kids, your family, your mom, or your friends to as you get in the mood for the Halloween season. So pack some snacks for the line, and prepare for an incredibly unique and unforgettable Halloween adventure.\n\nHaunting is a resource for immersive theater and horror fans in Los Angeles and across the world, promoting art and community.
