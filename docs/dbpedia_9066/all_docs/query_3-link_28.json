        "text": "The Midnight Ghost Train will be in concert Sunday, Sept. 1, at JJ's Bohemia, 231 E. M.L. King Blvd.\n\nThe heavy-metal rockers from Topeka, Kan., are touring in support of sophomore album \"Buffalo.\"\n\nSays singer/guitarist Steve Moss, \"We wanted the sound of this record to be tangible. We wanted you to be able to close your eyes and feel and taste the sweat and blood that we give off onstage.\"\n\nOthers in the band are bassist David Kimmell and drummer Brandon Burghart.\n\nThe 21-and-older show starts at 10 p.m. with a $5 cover.\n\nFor more information, call 423-266-1400."
