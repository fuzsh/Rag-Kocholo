        "text": "THE MIDNIGHT GHOST TRAIN Announces U.S. Headlining Tour in Support of New LP “Buffalo”\n\nUtterly unique Topeka, Kansas based HEAVY rock band THE MIDNIGHT GHOST TRAIN will launch a U.S. headlining tour in support of its sophomore LP Buffalo on July 18 at the Downtown Music Hall in Little Rock, Arkansas. Boasting a gargantuan sound that has been described as “ZZ Top trampled by mammoths” and “like the great depression era blues shouter Blind Willie Johnson, if he had fronted the ’60s San Francisco band Blue Cheer at their sludgiest,” THE MIDNIGHT GHOST TRAIN‘s epic live shows are “intense and real” and an uplifting cure-all for fans or critics that may feel rock music has lost its “edge”. The 34 city trek will run through September 7, showcasing a trio that has averaged over 300 live shows per year since its formation in 2007.\n\nA phenomenal band who has the wind behind their backs and momentum on their side, THE MIDNIGHT GHOST TRAIN (aka TMGT) transcends geography, generation and genre. With a name inspired by an old Hank Williams lyric and a live show that hits with adamantine force, TMGT is led by guitarist Steve Moss, whose gruff-throated, Tom Waits-like vocals, gloriously fuzzy tone and unbridled, wailing guitar solos combine to deliver an entirely new form of musical power and intensity. With literally thousands of live shows under their collective belt — including 13 U.S. tours (both solo and alongside acts such as Jucifer and Truckfighters) and 3 full European jaunts — the band has developed a strong reputation for blowing the doors off every venue in which they perform, leaving a whole new contingent of music fans awestruck and hungry for more with each and every show. THE MIDNIGHT GHOST TRAIN isn’t just a band you hear, it’s something you feel deep down. Its pulse affects you.\n\nReleased in 2012 via Karate Body Records, Buffalo was recorded with producer / engineer David Barbe (Harvey Milk, Son Volt, Drive-By Truckers) and has met to shining critical acclaim in the time since its release; hailed for its soul, energy and thick Mississippi Delta-rooted Rock ‘N’ Roll. Dark, heavy blues is as much an influence on TMGT‘s sound as rock/metal, but it’s also seriously head bang-able with loads of densely-packed furry riffage, heavy/quiet tradeoffs and memorable hooks. The record also contains a re-imagined cover of Huddie “Lead Belly” Ledbetter’s 1940 classic “Cotton Fields”.\n\nCheck out the ripping MIDNIGHT GHOST TRAIN song “Henry” now at this location!\n\nMIDNIGHT GHOST TRAIN tour dates:\n\nJuly 18 Little Rock, AR Downtown Music Hall\n\nJuly 19 Lafayette, LA The Wild Salmon Bar & Grill\n\nJuly 20 Ocean Springs, MS The Squeaky Lizard\n\nJuly 21 Pensacola, FL The Handlebar\n\nJuly 22 Valdosta, GA Ashley Street Station\n\nJuly 24 Charleston, SC The Mill\n\nJuly 25 Fayetteville, NC Black Cat Lounge\n\nJuly 26 Frederick, MD Guido’s Speakeasy\n\nJuly 27 Indianapolis, IN Indy’s Jukebox\n\nJuly 28 Cleveland, OH Now That’s Class\n\nJuly 30 Akron, OH Annabell’s Bar and Lounge\n\nJuly 31 Dayton, OH Therapy Cafe\n\nAugust 1 Chicago, IL Reggie’s Music Joint\n\nAugust 2 Green Bay, WI Crunchy Frog\n\nAugust 3 La Crosse, WI JB’s Speakeasy\n\nAugust 7 Billings, MT Shooters Bar\n\nAugust 8 Great Falls, MT Machinery Row\n\nAugust 10 Spokane, WA The Hop\n\nAugust 11 Seattle, WA Victory Lounge\n\nAugust 14 Red Bluff, CA The End Up Saloon\n\nAugust 15 Fresno, CA Audie’s Olympic\n\nAugust 18 Albuquerque, NM Launchpad\n\nAugust 19 Fort Collins, CO Surfside 7\n\nAugust 22 Denver, CO Tennyson’s Tap\n\nAugust 23 McCook, NE Sports\n\nAugust 24 Oklahoma City, OK The Conservatory-OKC\n\nAugust 26 Midland, TX The Blue Max\n\nAugust 27 Austin, TX The Legendary White Swan\n\nAugust 29 Monroe, LA Oaks Bar & Grille\n\nAugust 30 Jackson, MS Sam’s Lounge\n\nAugust 31 Birmingham, AL The Nick\n\nSeptember 4 Lexington, KY Green Lantern\n\nSeptember 7 Warrensburg, MO Bottomfeeder Bay\n\nTrack listing:\n\nA Passing Moment of Madness\n\nHenry\n\nFoxhole\n\nTom’s Trip\n\nSpacefaze\n\nCotton Fields\n\nSouthern Belle\n\nInto the Fray\n\nAs part of its European headlining tour last spring, THE MIDNIGHT GHOST TRAIN delivered a jaw-dropping live performance as part of the hallowed Roadburn international rock festival. This week, it was announced that the fest’s record label, Roadburn Records will release TMGT‘s full live set from the festival on both LP and CD this September as part of its popular “Live From Roadburn” series.\n\nTHE MIDNIGHT GHOST TRAIN features Steve Moss (guitar and vocals), Brandon Burghart(drums) and Mike Boyne (bass).\n\nRelated"
