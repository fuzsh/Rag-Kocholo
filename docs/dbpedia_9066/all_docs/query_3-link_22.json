        "text": "New Boston, New Hampshire\n\nThe Legend of the Ghost Train\n\nEvery year as New Boston prepares for the 4th of July, the Legend of the Ghost Train is told and retold. Supposedly a long-lost locomotive travels through town in the middle of the night between July 3rd and July 4th, its mournful whistle echoing over the hills and valleys.\n\nThe Ghost Train is said to have neither engineer nor fireman; somehow it has gone off its rails to ride the roads of New Boston. Note: the Historical Society has no record of any train derailment during the brief history of the New Boston Railroad (1893-1931).\n\nThe Ghost Train's schedule is unpredictable, which leads some to believe it is operated by Amtrak. When asked to comment about the phenomenon, a Police Department source admitted that their radar devices did report suspicious activity in the early hours of July 4 last year; someone or something was traveling Bedford Road at speeds below the posted limit, which is unheard of.\n\nYour browser does not support the audio element. Recording of the \"Ghost Train\" whistle posted on Facebook by Katie H.\n\nNew Boston Facebook groups buzz with anticipation in the days leading up the the 3rd. Everyone wants to know, \"Will I hear the Ghost Train this year?\"\n\nParents set up tents in their yards complete with sleeping bags so that their children don't miss the excitement. All is quiet, except for occasional cannonfire and the whine of mosquitos.\n\nAnxious hours pass, and then, sometime after midnight, Facebook lights up with dozens and dozens of comments from people who claim to have heard the Ghost Train on this road or that.\n\nOf course, there is no Ghost Train."
