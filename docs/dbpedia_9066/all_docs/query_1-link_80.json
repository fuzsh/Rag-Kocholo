I don't look forward to tomorrow's work. What am I doing with my life.\" ”\n\n— Kensuke Tanaka\n\nThe Ghost Train | 幽霊列車 is a J-horror game about a man named Kensuke Tanaka who takes the subway every night after work. Only for things to get weird as the nights go on.\n\nSynopsis[]\n\nEach evening, Kensuke Tanaka commutes home by subway train. As part of his regular routine, he typically stops by a vending machine to purchase a beverage, visits the restroom, and takes a break to smoke. However, recently, with each passing night, his usual journey home has become increasingly eerie.\n\nGameplay[]\n\n7/24 (Prologue)[]\n\nOne night, an insurance company sales manager by the name of Kensuke Tanaka is about to board a subway train to go back home from a long day at work. But before the train arrives, Kensuke decides to use the restroom, get a drink from the vending machine, and smoke in the smoking room. After doing all three, the train arrives at the station and Kensuke gets on. After getting on the train, Kensuke decides to sit at his favorite seat. (The 2nd car by the corner). As he walks in between cars, he notices an old lady who he recognizes for riding on the last train every night. After sitting down at his favorite seat, Kensuke decides to take a nap till his stop arrives. When he wakes, he notices a cicada was on his face, and he realizes that his stop must have passed by. He asks the old lady for assistance, and she offers to speak to the conductor for him. But Kensuke turns it down and claims he will do it. Kensuke then heads to the front car, but notices that a man is blocking the entrance to the cab. He tells Kensuke that three of his cicadas have escaped and needs help finding them. With no other choice, Kensuke will now have to find them. Throughout the subway, Kensuke can find a total of 5 cicadas, but the green ones are the ones the man needs.\n\nThe locations of those cicadas are:\n\nOn one of the train doors in the conductor's car (where the man with the cicada bucket is)\n\nOn the floor in the second car. (Close to the entrance of the first car).\n\nThe last car on the pole in the back of the train car.\n\nAfter finding them, the man will move aside and allow Kensuke to enter the conductor's cab. He tells the conductor that he forgot to stop at his stop and requested him to stop at the next station. The conductor apologizes and lets him know they will provide him the compensation for the mishap and asks for his contact info too.\n\nAfter getting off the train, Kensuke is upset on what just happened, but decides to let it slide since it wasn't serious. But he questions himself what on earth is he doing with his life.\n\n7/25[]\n\nAfter another long day at work, an exhausted Kensuke decides to head back home. He arrives at the station and does his usual things like the previous night. However, while he was in the smoking room, he notices a light flickering from an adjacent platform. But it stops when he leaves the room, and eventually the train arrives. Kensuke goes to sit at his usual seat and notices the old lady again. He admits that he finds it comforting that she's on the train and tries to talk to her. He asks her if she made it home last night safely, too which she claims she did but had some personal issues that occurred. Kensuke tried to comfort her and asks her about what happened, but she refuses to say anything. So, Kensuke decided to respect her decision and proceeds to sit down at his favorite seat.\n\nKensuke decides to take a nap again till his stop arrives. But when he wakes up, he notices that a little girl is standing right next to him. She thinks that he is her father, so Kensuke corrected her and tells her he isn't and to go back to her real father. The girl apologizes and tells him that he was chasing a cicada and then got lost. Unfortunately, she is too scared to go back to search for her father and claims she doesn't even remember what he looks like! So, with no other choice, Kensuke decides to help the little girl find her father within the subway cars. He goes over to four different men within the subway, but all of them claim that they don't recognize her. However, one of the men (the one standing up) claims that he thought that Kensuke was the father since she was sleeping with him the entire time. Upon realizing this, Kensuke knows now that the girl must have been left at by her father. And all of a sudden, the girl suddenly runs off to the back of the train. So, Kensuke quickly goes after her, but he also takes the time to speak to the old lady. She questions him if he was related to the girl in anyway, to which Kensuke denies. However, when he arrives at the back car, the girl is no longer there. When he turns around, the girl is suddenly behind him and starts running away! Not only that, but everyone on the train also seems to have disappeared! So, Kensuke quickly rushed to the front car to look for her. But when he enters the second train car (the car next to the front cab), the child suddenly drops from the ceiling and lands on top of him!\n\nLuckily, all of this was nothing more than a dream. Kensuke believes that he's probably too stressed to figure out what's real or not and is able to get off at his stop without further incident.\n\n7/26[]\n\nKensuke is once again riding the subway back home from work. Just like with the past two nights, he uses the bathroom, gets a drink at the vending machine, and goes for a smoke break. But when he is in the bathroom, he is unable to get out of the bathroom since the door is locked. At this point, he hears a pair of footsteps walking closer to the bathroom door before the door unlocks. Kensuke hears some sweeping and exits the bathroom to see who it is, but nobody is there. And once he enters the smoking room, he notices the same light is flickering again. On top of that, he also notices the silhouette of a figure in the distance as well. But before he leaves the room, the light eventually goes out. After some time, the train arrives and Kensuke proceeds to get on.\n\nKensuke heads to his favorite seat again, but he notices that the lady from the previous nights is no longer there. He also notices that the cars are labeled with numbers on the top. When he arrives at his seat, he notices that something is placed down on his favorite seat, and the sound of a baby is heard somewhere. Left with no other choice, he decides to sit somewhere else within the same train car. He decides to take a nap again until his stop arrives, but when he wakes up, the lights inside the train goes off. Kensuke figures it's just a black-out, but when he checks the time, it turns out its past his arrival time! So, Kensuke quickly gets up from his seat to tell the conductor. But after walking all the way to the front of the subway, the door to the conductor's cab is locked. With no other options, Kensuke decides to head back to his seat. However, when he reaches car #2, he sees a mysterious lady who is sitting calmly next to the door to the exit. Kensuke explains the problem to the lady and tells her why she is taking the situation so lightly. But the lady simply tells him that she will only help him if he can identify all the natural noises (in order) that are heard within the subway cars.\n\nKensuke will then travel to the different cars to pick up the noises within each car. The noises that are heard within each car are the following (in order):\n\nCar #1 - Summer Festival\n\nCar #2 - Seaside\n\nCar #3 - Cicadas\n\nCar #4 - Forest\n\nCar #5 - Temple Bell\n\nAfter telling the lady the noises he heard in order, she tells him that she has called a \"helper\" to help assist Kensuke. She lets him know that when he speaks to \"it\", the train will come to a halt. After she finishes speaking, the lights go back on. Before Kensuke heads to the adjacent cars, he had to ask the lady what is inside those bags. To which she claims that her \"children\" (cats) are inside the bags, and that she is a cat lover.\n\nKensuke will then walk to the front of the subway again but stops when he notices an old man on the subway. He suspects that he is the helper and asks him if he is. But the old man replies back with confusion, but after taking a second to look at Kensuke. He recognizes him as a former student of his, and Kensuke recognizes his former teacher as well. His name is Mr. Shimizu, Kensuke's former high school teacher who helped him from getting dropped out of school and help Kensuke get the job he has today. He questions Mr. Shimizu why he is out so late, to which he claims it's a habit of his to ride the last train before going off to bed. Kensuke then asks his former teacher what he should do since the train hasn't stopped since. Mr. Shimizu explains to him that he has to get off the train before the final stop, there are 3 stops and when Kensuke hears the same sound that he heard at the home station, that will be his time to get off. He warns that if he doesn't choose correctly, or doesn't choose at all, he will not be able to help him later on.\n\nAs the stations roll by, the player will then have to listen to the music playing at the stations to determine which is the correct one. (The correct one is the angelic tune. Which is the third stop)\n\nAfter Kensuke gets off the train, he then heads back home.\n\n8/6[]\n\nKensuke arrives at the train station, but he is unable to get through the gates because his card is unreadable. He asks the station agent if he can let him in since he doesn't want to miss his train. But the agent refuses to let him in and tells him he has to buy a new one. He also can't help getting Kensuke a new card since he can only do that during the day. Left with no other choice, Kensuke will head up the escalator to the mezzanine to buy himself a new ticket. While walking back downstairs, he hears a pair of footsteps walking somewhere in the empty mezzanine. And when he arrives at the gate to scan his ticket, the agent is no longer there. He then walks downstairs to the platform to wait for the train. However, he then notices that some of the lights on the platform are off. Then he notices that the lights on the mezzanine are flickering when looking back in the direction he came from. When he goes back to check what's going on, he sees a silhouette on top of the escalators that appears to be staring at him. Then the lights on the platform start to flicker rapidly, and strange noises are heard within station. But just before anything else could get weird, the train eventually arrives at the station.\n\nKensuke then proceeds to get on the train and head over to his favorite seat again. After taking a nap, he notices that once again, the train hasn't stopped at all any stations. He then heads over the conductor's cab to tell him, only to find out that the conductor is not even there! He decides that his best option is to operate the train himself. But no matter what he does, the train doesn't seem to respond to anything he's pressing. He finds out that he needs a key to operate the train, but when he tries to go back, he gets locked in. After a few seconds, the train then passes by a level crossing and a woman is seen about to walk across the tracks. All of a sudden, a loud thud is heard before the door unlocks itself. Indicating that the lady was unfortunately hit by the train. And blood is seen getting splattered onto the train.\n\nWhen he opens the door, the entire train becomes completely drenched with blood! Along with that, the lights had changed to a crimson color. And as he continues walking through the cars, Kensuke can see the people that he encountered (or not) on the train within the windows! (Their reflections are seen in the windows, but they aren't seen physically in the car). This means that all of them are actually dead! Kensuke will encounter the following people in order:\n\nCar #1: Presumably one of the men that Kensuke tried to ask if he was the father of the girl.\n\nCar #2: The old lady that sits in the same car as him.\n\nCar #3: The girl who asked Kensuke to help her find her dad. (Her dad is also seen within the reflection)\n\nCar #4: The man who asked Kensuke to help find his lost cicadas.\n\nCar #5: Mr. Shimizu\n\nWithin each car, Kensuke will notice five different items that belongs to the five spirits. He will have to place them on the opposite side in which the spirit is sitting. These are the items:\n\nA cage of cicadas (located in the first car next to the last door on the left where the entrance to the second car is)\n\nA Red windmill toy (located in the second car on a windowsill)\n\nA cane (located in the third car between two handrails)\n\nA beer bottle (located in the fourth car right next to the first door on the left)\n\nHigh-heel shoes (located in the fifth car in-between two seats)\n\nAfter placing all of the items in the correct order, Kensuke will then head to the back of the train and hear a knocking sound coming from the locked door. He tries to open it but can't. But that's when a very loud banging is heard, and the light next to the door starts flickering. So, Kensuke quickly rushes back to the first car, and he hears the door has slammed open! And out comes a black silhouette of a woman holding a scythe! (This being the Teke Teke) Once Kensuke reaches the first car, he sees a door has opened to a station. Allowing him to use this door to quickly run out of the train and escape the nightmare that he had encountered. (If Kensuke doesn't reach the door in time or stays in place, he will get attacked by the Teke Teke and will wake up at the same station).\n\nThe train will then leave the station. Upon closer inspection, Kensuke will notice that he arrived at a deserted and almost abandoned looking station called: \"Kisaragi Station\". Going inside the waiting room, he sees Mr. Shimizu who tells him that he has made it. But he claims this place isn't for him and tells Kensuke he will need a ride home. He tells him to call 'home' before he gets lost in the tracks.\n\n(*Heads up: If the player didn't choose the correct station to get off at, Mr. Shimizu will not be sitting at the waiting room*).\n\nKensuke will then walk out of the station and notices some tracks leading him to the middle of nowhere. He decides to follow it to see where it will lead him to. He then notices a phone booth next to the tracks that only accepts 10- and 100-yen coins. He only has one chance to call someone to help him. The following options are given:\n\nHome\n\nCo-worker\n\nBoss\n\nFriend\n\nTaxi\n\nTrain Station\n\nPolice\n\nDepending on what the player chooses will determine the ending.\n\nEndings[]\n\nLost in the Station (Bad Ending)[]\n\nIf Kensuke decides to call anyone else besides home. Kensuke will not be able to receive help from anyone of them. This is what happens if you choose each option:\n\nCo-Worker:[]\n\nKensuke will call his co-worker; Sho. Kensuke will ask Sho to come pick him up. But before he could finish his sentence, he hears someone crying in the background. Kensuke then asks about it, to which Sho claims it's his girlfriend crying because she is remembering something. Sho then starts rambling on about how a friend of his girlfriend was bullied by kids from another school back when she was in middle school. The friend of hers went to Kuma No Tsume Middle School. To which Kensuke realizes that's the same school his wife went to. But before he could ask him again to help him, the phone disconnected. Kensuke then comes to the conclusion that there wouldn't have been anyway that Sho could help him with his girlfriend upset at the moment.\n\nBoss:[]\n\nKensuke will call his boss; Mr. Kato (Kato-Senpai). He hopes that he can help him since he is a very respected guy and cares about all his workers. But when Kensuke is about to ask Kato-Senpai for assistance. Kato-Senpai immediately changes the subject to a classmate that Kensuke had back elementary school named Daishi Michishita/Takahashi. He then rambles on about how he was upset when his parents got a divorce, and that he received a bug cage with cicadas as a present from his dad. But then one day, he disappeared. But as Kato-Senpai was about to say something else, the phone is disconnected.\n\nFriend:[]\n\nKensuke will call his childhood friend; Chashima Uta (Chow). However, Kensuke is unable to ask Chow to pick him up from the station. This is because Chow believes he called him for old times' sake and started to talk about a TV show he's watching about cicadas. And then, he starts rambling about when they were in 6th grade, Kensuke will kill a lot of cicadas since he never liked them. And how a kid named Dashi who was always fascinated by them would get upset when Kensuke kills them. The phone then hangs up when Kensuke is about to ask him to pick him up.\n\nTaxi:[]\n\nKensuke will call the taxi company, Tsuru Taxi. He takes notice that the person answering is a female, but it doesn't bother him, and he continues to ask the taxi driver for a ride home. But when Kensuke mentions that he is at Kisaragi Station, the taxi driver claims to never hear of the station. The taxi driver then asks Kensuke for his name, he gives it to her, and the driver immediately recognizes that name. That's because she is a friend of Kensuke's wife: Eiko. The friend reveals her name to be Kaya, she's been a friend of Eiko since middle school. Kaya then starts to Kensuke about some sort of incident that happened with his wife back in the 8th grade and has been regretful of it ever since. But before she could tell Kensuke about it, the phone line disconnects. Even though Kensuke told her the station name, he has a feeling she won't come, and no matter what secret she was about to reveal about his wife, he won't resent her for it.\n\nTrain Station:[]\n\nKensuke will call Tori No Ha Station and lets the operator know that he got on the last train to Usagi station and ended up in a different station. When the operator asks what station Kensuke is at. He tells her the station name, but to his surprise, the station is non-existent! The operator then hangs up on him, thinking it was a prank phone call.\n\nPolice:[]\n\nKensuke will call the Ino No O Police Station, a station that he has been to before. As soon as he is giving the operator his name, the operator immediately recognizes him and presumes that he is calling about his wife. Apparently, his wife Eiko has disappeared about two years ago and they still haven't found anything about why she disappeared so suddenly. Unfortunately, the phone line disconnects before Kensuke could ask the operator for assistance. He admits that while the officer's work ethic is great, but he has the habit of speaking before listening to others.\n\nOutcome:[]\n\nBecause he has run out of change, Kensuke decides it is best if he walks on the tracks until he can find some help. He doesn't know how long it will take but hopes he can find someone at some point. As he walks down the tracks, the screen fades to black with a text appearing that Kensuke will be lost in the station forever as he will continue to walk fruitless on the tracks for help.\n\nThe same ending will happen if you decide to not call anyone and just walk directly on the tracks.\n\nCalling Home (Good Ending)[]\n\nKensuke will decide to call home, even though he figures no one will answer him, he figures its worth a shot. But to his surprise, he hears the voice of his wife on the other end. Holding back tears (since it's been years since he has last heard from her), he tells his wife that he is at Kisaragi Station and needs some help getting back home. His wife is surprised that he ended up there and tells him to stay there and wait. Kensuke will then hang up the phone and proceeds to walk on the tracks. After walking a bit, he then sees the headlights of a car in the distance, then the screen fades to black as he gets closer to the car. Then text appears on the screen about the outcome of Kensuke's choice.\n\nKensuke discovers that the car is indeed his wife's car, and his wife Eiko is in the car. She hasn't changed since the last time he has saw her. They hug each other and she proceeds to drive Kensuke back home. During the drive, the two didn't speak to each other that much even though he wanted to ask a lot of questions to her. Even though there wasn't much to be said. However, during the drive, Eiko mentions that he arrived at Kisaragi Station \"too early\". But it never made any sense to him, all that mattered was that he could see his wife again. They finally arrive at Kensuke's apartment, but Eiko disappears as soon as she unlocks the door to the apartment. Kensuke then continues on with his normal life and wonders if he will ever see his wife again.\n\nControls[]\n\nWASD - Move the protagonist around.\n\nMouse - Look Around.\n\nRight Mouse Click - Interact.\n\nEsc button - Options.\n\nTab - Inventory.\n\nShift - Run.\n\nCharacters[]\n\nKensuke Tanaka - An insurance company sales manager and the main protagonist of the game. He rides the subway home every night after a long day of work. As days go by, he notices that the ride back home starts to get weirder and weirder each day. From trains missing stops, to mysterious blackouts, and even figuring out mysterious puzzles just to get home.\n\nLady - A passenger on the train. Kensuke notices that she rides the last train and feels comforted by her presence. Unfortunately, its revealed that she is troubled, with Kensuke assuring her that she can talk to him about anything. She isn't seen on the train after 7/26, with the possibility that she may have died at some point.\n\nCicada man (Daishi) - A man who blocks the door leading to the conductor's car and refuses to let Kensuke pass unless if he could help him find his lost cicadas. It's revealed in both the Boss and Friend ending that his name is Dashi and was a former classmate of Kensuke. When his parents got a divorce, his father gave him a cicada cage, and was always fascinated by cicadas and insects in general. However, he would get upset when Kensuke will kill them while he was trying to catch them. Then he disappeared one day, and no one has seen him since then.\n\nConductor - The driver of the train, he apologizes to Kensuke when he fails to stop at his stop and blames it on a mishap. He decides to provide some assistance in order to get Kensuke back home.\n\nLittle Girl - A girl that lost her father on the train and asks Kensuke (who she thought was her father) to help her. Unfortunately, her father is nowhere to be found on the train. It is later on implied that Kensuke's wife Eiko was pregnant when she was in middle school and most likely had an abortion or given the baby away after giving birth. The girl would have been Kensuke's daughter had Eiko had the baby or kept it. Which explains why she thought Kensuke was her father.\n\nBusinessmen - When Kensuke is trying to help the little girl find her father, he tries to ask the other passengers if they knew the girl. The passengers (who all are businessmen) either replied back with confusion, snark, or politely tell Kensuke that they don't know her. Because the events of the train ride on 7/25 took place in a dream. It is likely they never existed.\n\nMysterious woman - A woman dressed in all black who only appears on the train on 7/26. After the power goes out and after Kensuke makes a fruitless attempt to reaching the conductor's car. He gets help from this lady who claims she can help him if he can identify the sounds of the natural world. After completing the puzzle, the woman calls \"a helper\" to help him. She is also a cat lover as the mysterious black bag she has with her are her pet cats. (Despite it sounding like an actual baby before). It is likely she is a ghost or entity.\n\nMr. Shimizu - Kensuke's old high school teacher. He helped him from getting expelled and help change Kensuke to being a better person. He rides the final train every night before going home for the night. He advises Kensuke to get off at the stop with the same jingle as his home stop. If he doesn't, he can't help him later on. When Kensuke is stuck at Kisaragi Station, he sees him in the waiting room and tells him that he should call home as the place he is in right now \"isn't for him\". If Kensuke didn't select the correct option, Mr. Shimizu won't be there to help. It is presumed that he may have died at some point during the game, and Kisaragi Station is his ticket to the afterlife. His reflection is seen on the final night when Kensuke has to find the items for the people he encountered on the train.\n\nTicket Agent - A man who works at the station Kensuke normally goes to when he goes home from work. He can't let Kensuke in due to his car being unreadable and advises Kensuke to go back up the mezzanine to get a new one as he can't give him a ticket himself. He only appears on the final night and unexpectedly disappears when Kensuke returns to the ticket booth.\n\nVictim - a lady who unexpectedly gets hit by the train Kensuke is riding on, on the final night. She becomes a vengeful spirit and becomes the Teke Teke who will kill Kensuke if he doesn't get off the train by the time the train reaches Kisaragi Station.\n\nEiko - The wife of Kensuke. She unexpectedly disappeared two years prior to the events of The Ghost Train. In both the taxi and the police ending, it is revealed that an incident happened to her around middle school and has been regretful of it ever since. (That being, she was pregnant at some point in middle school and was bullied because of it). That information being told by Eiko's childhood friend Kaya in the taxi ending and Sho in the co-worker ending. And the police telling Kensuke that they are still on the lookout for her. It's possible that Eiko either committed suicide due to her regretful past or died at some point from an accident or incident before the events of the game. If Kensuke ends up calling home, she will pick him up from the station and take Kensuke home. She disappears after she unlocks the door to the apartment.\n\nSho - A co-worker and friend of Kensuke. In the friend ending, Kensuke calls him to pick him up from Kisaragi Station. He couldn't do so due to his girlfriend crying at the moment. He claims that when his girlfriend cries, it's always about something she remembers. Not much is known about his personality.\n\nSho's girlfriend - The girlfriend of Sho (name unknown). She is known for crying whenever she remembers something. Sho mentions that she was crying about a friend back in middle school who was heavily bullied by kids from another school. If the friend was referring to Eiko (Kensuke's wife), then it means she was bullied for getting pregnant around that time.\n\nMr. Kato (Kato-Senpai) - The boss of Kensuke. He is a well-respected man and always cares about his workers. Kensuke is unable to ask him for assistance due to him rambling on about how Kensuke's classmate: Daishi and how he couldn't stop thinking about him. He then goes on to talk more about Daishi and his fascination with cicadas before the line gets cut.\n\nChashima Uta (Chow) - Kensuke's childhood friend. He is known for being trustworthy, energetic, and caring. However, Kensuke is unable to ask him for assistance due to Chow believing he called him for old times' sake and starts talking about the show he's watching. Since it's about rare cicadas, he starts talking about the time Kensuke would kill a bunch of bugs in front of their bug loving classmate Daishi and he would get upset. The phone line disconnects just when Kensuke finally has the chance to ask him to pick him up.\n\nKaya - A childhood friend of Eiko and a taxi driver for Tsuru Taxi. Kensuke calls Tsuru Taxi to come pick him up. When Kaya asks for Kensuke's name, she immediately recognizes his name and starts talking to him about Eiko. She starts telling Kensuke about an incident that happen back in middle school. However, the phone line disconnects before she can tell more about what happen.\n\nStation Worker - Kensuke calls Tori No Ha Station to let them know that the train he was riding on did not stop at his station.

But the operator hangs up on Kensuke believing he is pranking them as Kisaragi Station is non-existent.\n\nPolice Officer - A officer (name unknown) who works at Ino No O Police Station. Kensuke has been to the station many times in an attempt to find out what happen to his wife Eiko. (Who had disappeared two years ago).

She becomes a vengeful spirit and tries to kill Kensuke. Just like with the urban legend, she is an onryō, or vengeful spirit who takes an appearance of a woman with her lower torso missing. She travels with her hands or her elbows while making a \"teke-teke\" scratching sound. If someone encounters her, she will chase after the victim and slice them into two with a scythe. Mimicking her death. In the game, she will either successfully kill Kensuke, or is unsuccessful since Kensuke is able to escape the train before she can kill him.\n\nUrban Legend[]\n\nThe Ghost Train is heavily based on The Kisaragi Station urban legend. The urban legend goes like this:\n\nThe Kisaragi Station is a mysterious and also fictional train station that is located in the middle of nowhere. The first instance of the place being mentioned was on a 2channel (2ch) message board called: \"Post About Strange Occurrences Around You: Thread 26\" on January 8th, 2004. A young woman by the name of Hasumi was on her way to work. She normally takes a private railway line (The Enshū Railway Line) to work, and it normally takes 5 minutes to get to her stop. But she notices that the train hasn't been stopping for the past hour and everyone on the train is sleeping. So, she posted onto the 2chan forum for comfort and for assistance. The other users advised her to go to the conductor for assistance, but to no avail.\n\nThe train eventually comes to a stop at an unmanned station called \"Kisaragi Station\". Hasumi and the other users were skeptical, as they never heard of this station before. And the 2chan users later found out the station doesn't even exist. Hasumi gets off the train to explore the station to see if there is a way to get back home. (via. taxi or another train). But there was nothing in sight, and it seemed like the station was completely abandoned. Just when she decides to get back on the train, the train unfortunately leaves without her. She eventually discovers a public payphone and is able to call her parents for assistance. But they reply back with confusion and are unable to find Kisaragi Station on any maps. She also decides to call the police for assistance, but they believed it was nothing more than a prank. Left with no other choice, she decides to walk on the tracks and go through the tunnel to see if she can find any help. Upon walking on the tracks, she starts hearing the sounds of drums beating and bells ringing. Then all of a sudden, she hears someone shout to her:\n\n\"Hey! Don't walk on the track, that's dangerous!\"\n\nHasumi quickly turned around hoping that it was a station attendant who called out to her. But instead, she found a one-legged old man standing behind her before vanishing. Unfortunately, while running through the tunnel, Hasumi ends up falling down and injures herself. But she continues onwards and eventually comes across the end of the tunnel. She then comes across a nice and friendly young man who offers her a ride to the nearest station around Hina, since there is a business hotel in which Hasumi can stay at. Despite the 2chan users advising against it due to the strange nature of it. Hasumi thanks the man for his assistance and decides to fetch a ride from him. As time goes on, she notices that the area she is at doesn't look familiar. The man has been driving her through the mountains and he completely stopped talking to her. Eventually, Hasumi made one final post on the message board:\n\n\"My battery's almost run out. Things are getting strange, so I think I'm going to make a run for it. He's been talking to himself about bizarre things for a while now. To prepare for just the right time, I'm going to make this my last post for now.\"\n\nAfter that, Hasumi was never heard from again.\n\nTrivia[]\n\nAs stated above, the game is mostly based off the Kisaragi Station urban legend.\n\nThe game also makes reference to the Teke Teke urban legend.\n\nCoincidentally, Chilla's Art went along with the game company nyxtales made a game based off of the Teke Teke.\n\nWhen the game was first released, there was no ending text in the good ending. This was later added in the v1.0.1 update.\n\nKensuke is one of the few characters from the Chilla's Art franchise to have their ages revealed."
