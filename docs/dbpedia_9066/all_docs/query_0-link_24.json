        "text": "Heartfelt congratulations to The Midnight Ghost Train on signing with Napalm Records. The simple fact is there isn’t a damn thing the nigh-on-nomadic Topeka, Kansas, trio has got that they haven’t earned, whether it’s playing Roadburn and Desertfest and Freak Valley and others or stomping their way across the US alongside Truckfighters or whoever might think they’re up for keeping pace. Guitarist/vocalist Steve Moss and drummer Brandon Burghart — joined now by bassist Mike Boyne — have become one of American heavy rock’s most bombastic live acts the old fashioned way, honing their craft night after night on a seemingly endless string of tours.\n\nAs such, when news like the fact that they’ve been picked up to issue their recently-recorded new album, Cold was the Ground, through a high-profile imprint like Napalm, it gets a hearty “fuck yeah” from me. It’s excellent to see hard work being rewarded.\n\nTrue to form, the announcement comes bundled with a new string of tour dates for next month. Dig it:\n\nATTENTION: THE BIG BIG NEWS IS IN.\n\nWe are unbelievably proud to announce that The Midnight Ghost Train has just now officially signed with one of the BIGGEST heavy music labels in the world… NAPALM RECORDS. Napalm will be releasing our new album “Cold Was The Ground” on vinyl, CD and digital.\n\nThank you to all the fans that been sticking with us over the years, and has helped to make our band grow. Now it’s time to do some major damage in the ROCK world.\n\nSOME MORE EXCITING NEWS: Here is the schedule of our two week USA tour. Its a short run we know, but its gonna be a damn good one. Got some great cities and shows for this tour. Gonna be a blast. Check out the poster mark your calendars and be sure to spread the word.\n\n09/04 Secret Show Topeka, KS\n\n09/05 The Bay Warrensburg, MO\n\n09/06 5th Quarter Indianapolis, IN\n\n09/07 Blind Bob’s Dayton, OH\n\n09/08 The Bug Jar Rochester, NY\n\n09/11 31st St. Pub Pittsburgh, PA\n\n09/12 Bar Matchless Brooklyn, NY\n\n09/13 Rosie & The Rockers Washington D.C.\n\n09/14 The Milestone Charlotte, NC\n\n09/17 The Handlebar Pensacola, FL\n\n09/18 The Station Madison, AL\n\n09/19 Ol’ Tavern Jackson, MS\n\n09/20 The Wild Salmon Lafayette, LA\n\nWe’re coming.\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/themidnightghosttrain/\n\nhttp://www.napalmrecords.com/\n\nThe Midnight Ghost Train, Live at London Desertfest 2014\n\nTags: Cold was the Ground, Kansas, Napalm Records, The Midnight Ghost Train, The Midnight Ghost Train Cold was the Ground, Topeka"
