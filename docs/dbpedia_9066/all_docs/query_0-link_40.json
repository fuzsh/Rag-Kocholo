A frightening monster squad will make all of your nightmares come true. Screeching train wheels and an oncoming locomotive headlight will greet you as you climb aboard.\n\nStep lightly through the dimly lit train maze and enter an abyss of your worst phobias: snake dens, spider webs, deranged clowns, spirited skeletal remains, evaporating phantoms and snarling wild animals.\n\nObserve Dr. Freak’s living autopsy room and gory crime scenes where haunting sounds will chill you to the bone."
