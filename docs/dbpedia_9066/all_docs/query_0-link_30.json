        "text": "You will have your choice of coach or open-air seating, or feel free to roam between the two. A hat and sunscreen are advisable for the open-air car. Bring a jacket along for the evening trips. We are over a mile high in elevation, so weather is generally mild, but sometimes unpredictable.\n\nWhere can you see fireworks shot off a moving steam train? Only in Ely! The Fireworks Express at the Nevada Northern Railway leaves the Depot at 4:30 p.m. in mid-January. Fireworks are set off after nightfall. Get your 'front row' seats to the fireworks. Like many of these special trains, this annual train is generally a sell-out, so book early.\n\nJoin us for perhaps Ely's very best Fourth of July party! We start the evening with a trip \"Up the hill\" toward the Ruth Mining District. On the way back we stop the train at a perfect viewing location to see Ely's Fourth of July fireworks display. Either watch from the train, or bring your own lawn chairs. It's a fun way to celebrate this Independence Day evening as a group with your train friends.\n\nThis is an annual gala fundraiser for the railroad. Your coaches will be pulled by one of our century-old steam locomotives for a special dinner trip on the Nevada Northern Railway mainline. It will be our pleasure to serve you a classic, multi-course Italian meal, complete with flowing wine, and dessert. Adults only on this train.\n\nTaste of Italy Train Ride is sponsored by:\n\nThe Gianoli Family\n\nFirst National Bank of Ely\n\nHector Briceno & Isela Suarez of Ely's own Mr. Gino's\n\nEnjoy a steam powered train ride to the pumpkin patch. At the end of the track the train will stop, the conductor will let the passengers off to be greeted by the pumpkin patch and a photo op area is available for a small fall-themed celebration photograph. Passengers will get to choose a pumpkin from the patch to take home with them. The Pumpkin Train runs Oct. 7 and Oct. 14 at 1 p.m. Tickets are $45 for adults, $38 for seniors and $20 for children ages 4-12, while children under four ride for free.\n\nBut wait...remember back in 6th grade science class when they talked about that big blob of molten Earth swirling around in space? That is, until it cooled enough to support fast-food franchises, legos, and other evidence of advanced life forms. Why, with all of that swirling around, did all of that copper, gold, and silver coagulate here, in the Robinson Mining District, for us to dig out and use to build a nation?\n\nWe won't solve all of the Earth's great mysteries on this trip, but we will have a lively presentation by a local geologist talking about the mining history here, how railway entered the picture, and a show and tell with real ore samples.\n\nPull out your Zoot suit and beaded fringe dresses for a swinging good time aboard the Roaring 20s Limited. Enjoy a 90-minute steam powered train ride aboard vintage 1920s passenger cars. Quench your thirst at the speakeasy onboard (alcoholic beverages available for passengers 21 and older, non-alcoholic beverages also available) while listening to big band hits. Along the route, watch out for the notorious local gangsters who have been known to hold up the train, not to worry, Pinkerton agents will be sure to restore law and order in no time!\n\n“You'll feel like it's 1920 when you step on the property. Visit the engine house and see the locomotives up close. Talk to the volunteers who keep them running. Take a trip up the hill behind steam or out into the desert behind a vintage diesel. A real gem. Do Not Miss!”\n\nFor those of you who aren't fortunate enough to live up here in the inter-mountain rural West, you are missing our breathtakingly beautiful night sky. For those of you who live in these parts, you may not have taken the time lately to stop and gaze at the Heavens. Either way, plan a special night out with those beautiful stars of ours.\n\nOur star train pulls out of Ely with the Dark Rangers of Great Basin National Park aboard. These rangers love the night sky as much as we do, but probably know a whole lot more about stars than all of us put together. They will guide us to find interesting things up in the Heavens on this journey. We will stop the train away from town and have a special telescope for viewing the night sky.\n\nExperience a marvelous western sunset and watch the stars come out, while enjoying a relaxing train ride in Nevada's high desert country. The train takes you out into the desert, above Steptoe Valley, giving you a wonderful panoramic view of the sunset. On the return trip, enjoy looking up at the stars, as they come out in the heavens above. Weather permitting, you should be able to clearly see the heavens with your naked eye. Bring your smartphone to help orient you to the night sky. Please note, we do not bring telescopes on this train.\n\n“I took the evening sunset, stars and champagne tour. It was a superb trip. The train takes you out in the surrounding area to get a fantastic view of the night sky. The young man who pointed out the constellations was very knowledgeable. The views of the Milky Way were worth the entire trip. And you didn't have to drive way out of town to experience the starshow. I would go back in an instant.”\n\nJoin us for an informative ride back in time. As we travel behind one of our historic steam locomotives out Robinson Canyon and up toward the Ruth Mining District, we will learn about some of the early history of While Pine County and the State of Nevada, starting with the Pony Express route that traversed Nevada, linking the country together in 1860.\n\nPrepare yourself for a scary trip as we dare to send our haunted train up the hill on selected weekend dates in October. Ghost stories come alive, so-to-speak, as we see zombies, ghosts, ghouls, aliens and maybe even Big Foot. You never know what's around the next bend, and we've been sworn to secrecy. See for yourself! Costumes are encouraged unless you're just naturally scary.\n\n“I brought my little nephew here for the ghost train ride on Oct 15, 2016. We had so much fun! Earlier that day, we spent some time exploring the train station and tracks, visited the museum and learn about the history of this station. So wonderful that they allow visitors to roam freely. I will be back for more train rides.”\n\nJoin with us as the most magical train of the year, Santa's Reindeer Flyer, once again heads to the North Pole to visit with Santa Claus. Everyone knows that Santa loves trains so it is only natural that you will find Santa here, on the Nevada Northern Railway. On the trip to the North Pole, we serve hot chocolate and cookies.\n\n“We traveled 4 hours in not so nice weather to ride the Santa’s Reindeer Flyer with our grandchildren ages not quite 2 and 4 years old and I am so glad we did. The grandchildren just loved it and squealed with delight! I think the songs, the staff, and of course the cookies and hot chocolate were a good warm up to actually seeing and greeting Santa.”"
