The band's name comes partially from a Hank William's song lyric in I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry. TMGT's first release was \"Johnny Boy EP\" in 2008. In 2009 they self-released their first full length album \"The Midnight Ghost Train\". The album was self-recorded in their home studio after the band relocated to Kansas. They followed up with their 2012 album \"Buffalo\", released on Karate Body Records. It was recorded entirely analog by Dave Barbe in Athens, Georgia. Displaying the band's delta blues influences, the album features a Lead Belly cover of Cotton Fields done a cappella. In 2013, TMGT performed at the Roadburn Festival in Tilburg, Netherlands, and released \"Live at Roadburn 2013\" shortly after. After losing their previous bassist, they went through several lineup changes before finding current bass player Mike Boyne. In 2014, TMGT signed with the Austrian based metal label, Napalm Records, which released TMGT's \"Cold Was The Ground\" on February 28, 2015. The album has a much faster tempo than previous releases, with more emphasis on song and lyric construction. They have been most commonly described as hard rock, and related to bands like Kyuss, Black Sabbath, and Clutch. The band has built the majority of their fan base from consistent touring, and intense live performances.\n\nMembers\n\nSteve Moss – vocals, guitar\n\nBrandon Burghart – drums\n\nMike Boyne – bass\n\nFormer members\n\nDavid Kimmell - bass (2010–2012)\n\nDiscography\n\nCold Was The Ground (2015)\n\nLive at Roadburn 2013 (2013)\n\nBuffalo (2012)\n\nThe Midnight Ghost Train (2009)\n\nJohnny Boy EP (2008)\n\nSongs\n\nBC TruckerCold Was the Ground · 2015\n\nA Passing Moment of MadnessBuffalo · 2012\n\nSpacefazeBuffalo · 2012\n\nReferences\n\nThe Midnight Ghost Train Wikipedia\n\n(Text) CC BY-SA"
