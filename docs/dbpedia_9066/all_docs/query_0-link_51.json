        "text": "Intro[]\n\nThe Ghostlight Express is a ghost train in the Edge of Midnight campaign that travels the mists.\n\nDescription[]\n\nAn ancient enormous jet-black train traveling through the mists to and from Druskenvald run by its conductor The Vagrant. [1]\n\nAs it gets closer, you first hear the cacophonous repetitive chugging of this train, and then its shrill whistle, that sounds like hundreds of wailing ghosts, piercing through the air. Alongside this, is the constant ringing of its funeral bell-sounding bell. Right before it appears, a mist and dense fog appears seemingly out of nowhere to envelope the awaiting passenger, to the point that one can only see the mists and the ground itself. The fog/mists on the ground move to snake, condense, and form two straight rows of dark gray rails as the train glides forward on it.[1]\n\nThrough this thick mist, you see the Ghostlight Express approaching as it parts the mists, with its circular blue-green hued light at the front of its black ghastly mechanical locomotor. From its chimney stock, a ghastly blue-greenish cloud is being released, that neither looks like smoke nor steam, that emits the sound of the low moans of wailing humanoid voices with every puff. Pulling behind this are the numerous boxcars that go on and on into the mists surrounding the train. For living passengers, they have a specific luxurious spacious room in one of the boxcar's that has a sign labeled \"Live ones, haha\"[1] on either side of the space. Inside this room, the walls are lined with wooden panels that smell of age and fresh foliage, and has small lamps flickering with a soft comforting orange light as the glow illuminates the room. At the center of this, is a table surrounded by faded, old, but not worn, plush seats. This table is capable of materializing whatever food and/or drinks one wants or can think of for living passengers to enjoy. These delicate ornately designed plush seats are covered in faded blues and greens fabric with silver threaded embroidery. Meanwhile, in the other boxcars are Haints (semi-transparent Specters) of humanoids and animals, of numerous states and statures.[1] These boxcars are designed in tandem with one another but vary slightly in design. Some of them are windowless, while others have ornate filigree windows that allow you to see a the undead passengers within. One of these boxcars, with a large sliding door, is where The Vagrant (the conductor) is located playing music on his fiddle. Built into the train itself, is a speaker system that allows The Vagrant to communicate and/or make announcements to the passengers.[1]\n\nCrew[]\n\nConductor: The lone crew member and conductor of the Ghostlight Express, The Vagrant checks to see if a living passenger has a ticket before they board the Ghostlight Express. After accepting the ticket, he ignites it in his hand in a blueish-green flame.[1]\n\nHistory[]\n\nBackground[]\n\nOperated by The Vagrant, The Ghostlight Express is a mysterious ghost train capable of traveling in and out of Druskenvald to Avantris (the material plane) via the mists surrounding Druskenvald.[1] Even now, despite anyone that enters Druskenvald becoming immediately trapped there, the Ghostlight Express (and its conductor) is the only known exception to this.[2] It is also able to quickly travel between different continents/parts of Avantris by using the mists, even at locations that lack train tracks, such as in the middle of the ocean. With the power of the blue-green light at the front of its locomotor, the Ghostlight Express is able to travel the mists without being directly harmed by the mists itself, but it is protected against anything that might reside in the mists.[1] Wherever it travels to, the Ghostlight Express makes its own rails, using the mists that surround it, to travel upon places that normally aren't able accommodate a train. Typically, its passengers consist of Haints (semi-transparent Specters) of humanoids, animals, and all manner of undead that have a soul.[1] The Haints don't need a ticket to board the Ghostlight express as they go aboard via melding into the train and then making their way to an empty boxcar. However, the Ghostlight Express is capable of transporting living passengers (who the Haints don't pay mind to) that have a ticket.[1] These gray tickets, with bits of blues and greens, have silver embellishments all around it, and on one side, in silver lettering, lists who the living passenger(s) are, and pre-stamped above it is the symbol of whoever procured the ticket for the passenger(s). These symbols can be that of deities, devils, demons, archfey etc (e.g. the symbols shown on screen, in Edge of Midnight episode 1, next to the nametag where the character art usually is).[1] These living passengers are led to the specific boxcar with a room designated for living passengers, while the Specters use the other boxcars.\n\nEdge of Midnight[]\n\nArc 1[]\n\nThe Ghostlight express was used to transport the Edge of Midnight party members (except for Yorgrim) to Druskenvald from Avantris (the material plane) upon Phillip Druskenvald arranging and paying The Vagrant to have the party meet him in Druskenvald. Somewhere along the way, it was also used to deliver Phillip Druskenvald's invitation (to enter Druskenvald) to Yorgrim via having the invitation thrown out to him as it passed him by.[2] The Ghostlight Express appeared to each one of the the player characters, at their then present locations, which include a narrow street between two buildings in Stryga, a crop field in Yona, a dark forest on one of the islands of Barghest, a battlefield in Delphinus, & the oceans near Chaac etc.[1] For the party members boarding the train, a ticket to the Ghostlight Express mysteriously appeared on their person without their knowledge. The tickets themselves were secured, and given to the party by powerful forces familiar to them (e.g. their respective patron, Dark Gift, Deity) that sent for the party.[1]\n\nAs the Ghostlight Express made its way to Druskenvald, it traveled to a lonely tall hill crowned with 13 standings stone monoliths, set in the shape of a ring, with a gray mist condensing, swirling, and growing to fill this circle. As the Ghostlight Express went up this hill and headed straight in between the standing stones, it plunged into the mists that surround Druskenvald itself. These mists that surround Druskenvald have recently become much more dangerous and violent, when compared to the more peaceful mists used to get around on Avantris, to the point that the Ghostlight Express is capable of being attacked by those that resides in these mists. [1] When you enter, you can see strange, swirling, shifting, and violent dark specters in this mist that make a cacophony of wailing, hissing, malevolent whispers, shrieks, growling, and laughing voices while they appear looking eternally in pain. Before the party became passengers of the Ghostlight Express, this train had never been attacked by the denizens of the mists.[1] However, now, the train has been attacked with specters swarming the train as they scream their pleads for help, while ghostly pearly-white eyed wraiths rip the specters apart. Shortly afterwards, one of the windows has been broken by mysterious long tendrils, from the mists, that have black hands made of almost pure darkness, as they shake the train and drags the Haints train passengers into the mists. Without the protection of the Ghostlight Express, upon contact with the mists, the Haints passengers loose all of the color and features they once had in life and transform into horrific gray shades of mists (with a mashing maw for a face). These shades fuse together with other shades to form a loud gnashing, guttural, and screaming gray wraith-like creature, that has numerous hissing and wailing souls within, who's sole focus is turning the other Haints into more wraiths. The sooner the wraiths are defeated, the sooner the mysterious tendrils leave. Once the danger is over, the lights in the Ghostlight Express switch from being a ghastly blue-green light to their regular orange light. The Ghostlight Express exits these oppressive wailing mists that surround Druskenvald, past and in between the legs of a colossal, sculpted humanoid titan wicker structure (with more of these structures standing in the distance to forma a ring of eternal sentinels) that stand at the edge of the mists, and into a huge valley where you can see all of Druskenvald from here.[1]\n\nAs the Ghostlight Express enters deeper into this valley, there are dark forests everywhere that have huge, gnarled trees with a thick canopy of green leaves, so dark that it looks black, with limbs that rise skyward. The train enters a path in one of the numerous forests that dominate this valley, to travel to the center of this valley, as a thick fog rolls in. When this train emerges from this woodland path, you can see the sprawling moors and the Lockwood Estate (a.k.a the Crooked House located in the center of the moors) from here. It continues to chugs its way into and through the forest to a clearing surrounded by a dense dark forest, with one side of it shrouded in mist, that has a simple, small, and humble wooden train station platform, with five wooden steps that lead from the platform to the dusty old lonely road that snakes off into the forest (to the moors where the Crooked House is). As the party disembarks the Ghostlight Express from one of the passenger car doors, and awaits on the platform, the train departs after The Vagrant has some final words to say to the party. [1]\n\nMini-arc #1[]\n\nTrivia[]\n\nIt appears that the Ghostlight Express cannot be summoned via the method of calling for it using its name. [3]"
