        "meta_description": "After seeing them several times at the Hellfest 2015 or the Stoned from the Underground 2015, I stumbled over this juwel of record, which has almost nothing commun with their previous releases. Starting with Steve Moss´ throat which turns into a hearttouching voice, passing the heavy distorted blues which turns in a more ambient and more colorful one and the guitar is never the powerchord shredding monsteraxe as it was before. Yes folks, I write about these three buffalos, having destroyed stages and audiences from 50 up to 5000 spectators. \"Tonight\" opens the stage and it remains me to an Everlast track with a more heavy attitude. And Steve Moss proves not only on the following track \"Red Eyed Junkie Queen\", that he can tell thrilling stories based on a groovy rhythm section. A \"old\" MGT-song. Same as \"Glenn´s Promises\" which hammers through my speakers with a distorted bass and the exactly right dosed fuzzy guitar. \"The Watcher´s Nest\" touches me as an absolute Mountain maniac. The first song with a change of mood and dynamics and a catchy hookline. \"Break My Love\" lingers along as a Tom Waits song, also one of my favorites, very muddy and basic and rooted deep in the delta. \"Lemon Trees\" is and will be one of my all-time-faves. It really cought me from the first chord until the coda and made me cry and sent me shivers all over. \"The Boogie Down\" comes as a mid 70´s jazzy funk track with trumpets, a driving bass line and an old school rap. Cool track. Usually I don´t like this kind of music, but you hear the twinkles between the lines. Again another all-time-fave kurking aroundwith a softly brushed snare drum and another fantastic bass-line and laid-back guitar. And again, it´s not just the music that touches me. Steve Moss´ voice and lyrics managed again to listen to this song again and again. \"The Echo\" offers you a wide range of dynamics within the instruments, vocals and lyrics. A touching introspective song and a dignified end of a wonderful rollercoaster record.",
