        "text": "Overview\n\nThe Ghost Train is an artistic sensory experience at the Oak Leaf Trail Bridge and Capitol Drive in Shorewood. It made its inaugural run on October 31, 2016. This first-of-its kind public art installation will enable visitors to travel back in history, imagining the round-trip journey of the 'Twin Cities 400' which was operated by the Chicago & North Western Railway and crossed that same location from 1935-1963. Touted as the fastest passenger train in the world, the Chicago & North Western Railway's '400' routinely covered the 400 miles between Chicago and St. Paul, MN in just under 400 minutes - including its travel through Shorewood along the route of today's Oak Leaf Trail. The Ghost Train is the next phase of an exciting long-term public art vision for Shorewood, which encompasses a partnership between the Public Art Shorewood Committee and the Shorewood Historical Society to make this project happen.\n\nDesign & Engineering\n\nThe Ghost Train designer is Marty Peck, principal of Creative Lighting Design & Engineering, which is a Germantown-based firm specializing in the expressive use of light in architecture. Through innovative lighting and sound technology, Peck created the allusion of a Ghost Train crossing the bridge twice each evening to recall the schedule, speed and drama of the passing of this historic 400 train. At other times the bridge will have a subtler artistic illumination. Both the Ghost Train and bridge lighting will be a permanent installation.\n\nNight of the Ghost Train Celebration\n\nShorewood is coordinating a new, fun and exciting annual tradition. Every October 31, the Village will celebrate the \"Night of the Ghost Train.\" On Halloween, residents can attend a celebration from 6:30 - 8:30 p.m. in the Corner Bakery parking lot to enjoy the festivities.\n\nThere will be a kids costume contest, ghost stories, free refreshments (while they last), and a Ghost Train program. We will have a special Ghost Train run at 8 p.m. and 8:15 p.m. for everyone to enjoy! Make sure to come out and enjoy this new community tradition. The event is sponsored by Corner Bakery Shorewood Cafe, Culver's, and North Shore Bank.\n\nNight of the Ghost Train Flyer (PDF)\n\nGhost Train Stories from Lake Bluff Elementary Students (PDF)"
