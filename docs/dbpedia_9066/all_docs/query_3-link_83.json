        "text": "I feel like I'm learning a new piece of Hudson Valley history every day. Did you know Abraham Lincoln passed through Dutchess County in 1865?\n\nUnfortunately, it was after he was assassinated. Let us explain.\n\nAbraham Lincoln Passed Through the Hudson Valley in 1865\n\nMost Americans are familiar with the Abraham Lincoln assassination story. The 16th President of the United States was taking in a show at The Ford Theater in Washington D.C. when John Wilkes Booth entered the presidential box and assassinated the President.\n\nAfter the unfortunate events of April 14, 1865, arrangements had to be made to bring President Lincoln to his final resting place. According to the Hyde Park Railroad Station Museum, Lincoln's funeral train passed through Dutchess County en route to Albany on April 25th, 1865.\n\nLincoln's Ghost Train Allegedly Appears in Hyde Park, New York\n\nWhile Lincoln's Funeral Train didn't stop in Hyde Park, it did pass through on its way to stop for a viewing in Albany. With that being said, there is a piece of local lore that claims that Abraham Lincoln's ghost train has appeared every year since 1865.\n\nThe Hyde Park Railroad Station Museum shared earlier this week that they have a new historical marker outside of the museum. Under the Legend and Lore category, the Hyde Park Museum has a sign detailing the legend of Abraham Linconl's Ghost Train.\n\nThe Legend and Lore website explains that on April 25th \"if the moon is out, clouds are said to obscure it.\" That's when Lincoln's funeral train \"adorned in black crepe is seen slowing inching its way north to Albany.\"\n\nThey add:\n\nThis is not the only story told of sightings of the ghost of Lincoln’s funeral train. One will hear of similar stories that have been passed along in communities located along the train’s path that still resonate with locals to this day.\n\nTake a look at the new marker below:\n\nHave you seen the Ghost Train in Hyde Park?\n\nMore Hudson Valley Hauntings\n\nThere's no shortage of spooky stories in the Hudson Valley, especially because our region is so rich in history.\n\nRecently, Burn Brae Mansion in Glen Spey, New York was visited by a popular paranormal investigator. Jason Hawes of Ghost Hunters/Ghost Nation fame stopped by the Catskill Bed & Breakfast and had quite the experience.\n\nAccording to a video from the investigation, Hawes saw the infamous Lady in White and heard a baby crying."
