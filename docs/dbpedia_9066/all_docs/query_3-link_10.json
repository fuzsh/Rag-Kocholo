        "text": "If you’ve ever had the chance to see The Midnight Ghost Train live, then you don’t need me to tell you tales of their on-stage fury. The hard-touring Topeka, Kansas, heavy blues trio are kinetic, a broiling chaos of riffs, headbanging and stomp. They’ve been at it for years at this point, back and forth across the country as well as in Europe, and in March, they’ll make their debut on Napalm Records with their third album, Cold was the Ground, for which preorders are now available. Of course, if you haven’t seen the band before, I’d be happy to tell you those tales, but probably the best thing to do would be wait 15 minutes or so for them to announce another round of shows that includes wherever it is you happen to live. They’ll get there sooner or later.\n\nCold was the Ground contains 11 tracks championing the three-piece’s thick-toned, high-energy cause. It’s a record that deals out quick blows and doesn’t stick around too long to watch the damage before starting the next bombardment. Guitarist/vocalist Steve Moss, drummer Brandon Burghart and bassist Mike Boyne have a road-honed dynamic, and one can hear the progression from where The Midnight Ghost Train were just a couple years ago on their 2012 second album, Buffalo (review here). They’ve never wanted for confidence or push, but Cold was the Ground puts them in new territory in both how hard it slams its point home and in the range of its songwriting. Fuzz tones meet head on with Moss gruff-bordering-on-growl vocals, and the raging shuffle that ensues throughout is a demonstration of the kind of madness only a band at the top of their game can produce. It’s the kind of record that dares you not to headbang.\n\nOf course, The Midnight Ghost Train will hit the road (and hard) to support it. In fact, they’re already doing shows this week. The international release dates for the album and their current tour plans — lucky dogs are touring with Greenleaf — are underneath the player below, on which you’ll find the debut of their new video for “Gladstone,” an early kick in the ass from Cold was the Ground that’s just one of the many on hand.\n\nPlease enjoy:\n\nThe Midnight Ghost Train, “Gladstone” official video\n\nCold was the Ground Release Dates:\n\n2.28.2015 – GSA / Europe / AUS\n\n3.2.2015 – UK / NO / FR / DK / IT\n\n3.04.2015 – SE / ESP\n\n3.10.2015 – USA / CAN\n\nThe Midnight Ghost Train on Tour:\n\nDec 17 Launchpad Albuquerque, NM\n\nDec 18 The Blue Max Midland, TX\n\nDec 19 The Lost Well Austin, TX w/ Sabbath Crow\n\nDec 20 Vino’s Brew Pub Little Rock, AR\n\nDec 21 Lizard’s Lounge Wichita, KS w/ Bridegeist\n\nFeb 24 Alte Malzerei Regensburg, Germany w/ Greenleaf\n\nFeb 25 Arena Vienna, Austria w/ Greenleaf\n\nFeb 26 Immerhin Wurzburg, Germany w/ Greenleaf\n\nFeb 27 Vortex Siegen, Germany w/ Greenleaf\n\nFeb 28 Gaswerk Winterthur, Switzerland w/ Greenleaf\n\nMar 01 Lo-Fi Milano, Italy w/ Greenleaf\n\nMar 03 White Rabbit Freiburg, Germany w/ Greenleaf\n\nMar 05 Feierwerk Munich, Germany w/ Greenleaf\n\nMar 06 Stahlfest Leipzig, Germany w/ Greenleaf\n\nMar 07 Treibsand Lübeck, Germany w/ Greenleaf\n\nMar 09 Hafenklang Hamburg, Germany\n\nMar 11 DAS BETT Frankfurt, Germany\n\nMar 12 Marlein Leuwaarden, Netherlands\n\nMar 13 Hell Over Esslingen Esslingen, Germany\n\nMar 14 Borom PomPom Oberentfelden, Switzerland\n\nMar 15 Il Principe In Bicicletta Treviso, Italy\n\nMar 16 No Cage Prato, Italy\n\nMar 18 PMK Innsbruck, Austria\n\nMar 19 kulturbahnhof Jena, Germany\n\nMar 20 Le Brin De Zinc Chambery, France\n\nMar 21 Mudd Club Strasbourg, France\n\nMar 22 Glazart Paris, France w/ Black Rainbows\n\nMar 24 Ostpol Dresden, Germany\n\nMar 25 Paunchy Cats Lichtenfels, Germany\n\nMar 26 Dustown Festival Berlin, Germany\n\nMar 27 7er Club Mannheim, Germany\n\nMar 29 dB’s Utrecht, Netherlands\n\nJun 19 Hellfest Clisson, France\n\nThe Midnight Ghost Train on Thee Facebooks\n\nCold was the Ground preorder\n\nNapalm Records\n\nTags: Cold was the Ground, Gladstone, Kansas, Napalm Records, The Midnight Ghost Train, The Midnight Ghost Train Cold was the Ground, Topeka"
