        "text": "We go to a LOT of Halloween events. This is, without a doubt the busiest time of year for us when it comes to events that we cover.\n\nSo it takes a LOT to impress us sometimes, it's just the nature of the season. But Saturday night we had our first visit ever to the Ghost Train at Griffith Park and it's easily one of our favorite events of the year so far.\n\nPhoto's by Coastermatt\n\nVideo and Words by Gregg Condon\n\nBefore we get started we wanted to give you some info on the Ghost Train. You can find all the information about the event here. It's strictly run by volunteers and it is a $15 donation. But it's TOTALLY worth it. You can read more about where the donations go and the causes they support on their website.\n\nThe event is also a family event, so don't go in expecting to get scared, but do go in expecting to have a tremendous amount of fun on the ride which is about 25 minutes long.\n\nOur suggestion, get to the event early or towards the end of the evening, it get's busy. And there are families who know how to do this event. We saw people with folding chairs waiting in the line eager to do the ghost train.\n\nWe'll start off with our video of the train ride, which even with cutting down a few things is about 18 minutes long. We also had to cut out a couple of songs due to copyright but hopefully it's not TOO noticeable. ;)\n\nThe entrance to the Ghost Train\n\nThe loading area, very well done and starts the fun off with a great little song.\n\nGet off my lawn!!!\n\nFeed me Seymour!!\n\nAwesome graveyard scene near the load/unload. You get to pass by this twice.\n\nDead Men Tell No Tales\n\nDia De Los Muertos\n\nLots of great lighting, which is no surprise as this is the same group that does the lighting at ScareLA.\n\nClever play on words ...\n\nOur conductor\n\nAwesome Tesla Coil!!\n\nBlocks should say \"Creepy Bear\".\n\nClowns selling fireworks, always a good idea\n\nHi everybody, can you pick me up on your way back around? I've been here awhile\n\nIs it just us or does the guy in the picture look like Neil Patrick Harris?\n\nThere's only 2 weekends left to experience the awesomeness that is the Ghost Train, so be sure you head out to Griffith Park and have a great time. You won't be disappointed. Grab your kids, nieces/nephews, brothers/sisters, whoever.\n\nJust remember, this is a family event, so go expecting to have a great time, don't go in expecting to get scared. But it's definitely a can't miss event. We can't wait to go back next year!!"
