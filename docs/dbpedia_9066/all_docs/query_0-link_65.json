        "text": "Seems unfair to call the video put out today by Topeka blues bashers The Midnight Ghost Train a “teaser,” since it’s longer and less promo-speaky than a lot of album teasers wind up being — plus it has a plot and production value — despite its function being roughly the same in giving fans of the trio a glimpse at the new record’s sound and atmosphere. Their slammed-home boogie seems to be in good standing, and as for atmosphere, well, all you really have to do is look at the big sky country and the expanses of land featured in the clip to see where The Midnight Ghost Train are coming from on Cold was the Ground, their new album, which is out March 2015 on Napalm Records.\n\nI’m looking forward to hearing what they’ve come up with this time out, so even just a sneak peak at some of the riffing here is welcome as far as I’m concerned. The story of the video seems to center around the overall-clad guy who resists and then finally succumbs to the band’s riffy wiles after pretty much the whole world around him has already done the same. The last holdout. That same gentleman also features on the album cover for Cold was the Ground, which presumably was put together around the same time as this short film, and does well in the form of silent expression. No doubt his experience in the clip mirrors that of many who’ve discovered The Midnight Ghost Train these last couple years, so much awareness of them having come from word of mouth from those who’ve caught them killing it live on stages throughout the US and Europe.\n\nThey’ll likely keep doing that as well, unhindered by blizzards or barbecue sauce on the face or whatever it might be. Preorders for the album reportedly start Dec. 2. Enjoy the video:\n\nThe Midnight Ghost Train, Cold was the Ground short film\n\nLadies and Gentlemen, I give you… The Midnight Ghost Train’s very own short film for the new album “Cold Was The Ground”. We created this film to give you a listen, (and a look) at the new record. A bit of a tease. This is for the fans. Enjoy.\n\nThe Midnight Ghost Train on Thee Facebooks\n\nNapalm Records\n\nTags: Cold was the Ground, Kansas, Napalm Records, The Midnight Ghost Train, The Midnight Ghost Train Cold was the Ground, Topeka"
