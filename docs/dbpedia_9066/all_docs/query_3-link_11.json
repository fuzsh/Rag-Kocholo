The trio has also averaged over 300 live shows per year since its formation in 2007.\n\nThe Midnight Ghost Trainâs tracks\n\nRiver Silt (Live @ Roadburn 2013) by The Midnight Ghost Train\n\npublished on 2013-11-24T00:40:55Z\n\nThe Midnight Ghost Train - Foxhole by The Midnight Ghost Train\n\npublished on 2013-09-21T18:18:44Z\n\nTom's Trip by The Midnight Ghost Train\n\npublished on 2013-09-21T18:11:59Z\n\nThe Midnight Ghost Train - Cotton Fields by The Midnight Ghost Train\n\npublished on 2013-09-21T17:59:17Z\n\nThe Midnight Ghost Train - Southern Belle by The Midnight Ghost Train\n\npublished on 2013-09-21T17:45:39Z"
