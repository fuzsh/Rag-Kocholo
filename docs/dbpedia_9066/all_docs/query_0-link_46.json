        "text": "When the sun goes down this unassuming railroad transforms into a train of terrors.\n\nThe Ultimate Fall Vacation\n\nTweetsie Railroad is located in North Carolina, so it's a bit of a drive from the Tri-State, about 8 hours from Evansville when I Google Mapped it. However, the Tweetsie Railroad is only about 3 hours from Gatlinburg. So hear me out, plan a trip to the Smoky Mountains to soak in the stunning fall foliage, and while in the area take the short drive across the Tennessee border into North Carolina to spend an evening at the haunted railroad. This is a win/win!\n\nAll Aboard the Ghost Train!\n\nEvery year Tweetsie Railroad transforms into a full-on haunted ghost train experience. Conductor Casey Bones will take you on a chilling journey with unexpected surprises, ghouls, and ghosts around every corner.\n\nHere is what Tweetsie has to say about their Halloween experience:\n\nThe spooktacular season of Tweetsie’s Ghost Train® Halloween Celebration, a popular fall family tradition, begins Friday, September 22, and continues every Friday and Saturday night through October 28.\n\nDaytime guests can still enjoy all of Tweetsie’s Wild West adventures, rides and attractions. . . but when the sun goes down, the park gets a full makeover complete with costumed characters, decorations, music and Halloween-themed attractions.\n\nYounger children will love the dance parties, trick-or-treat stations, themed photo opportunities, and the Palace Spooktacular Show.\n\nBraver kids and adults will appreciate the scary night-time journey on the Ghost Train, walking through the hallowed halls of the Haunted House and exploring the murky Freaky Forest.\n\nAnd, everyone will love the park’s most popular amusement rides after dark in the Creepy Carnival.\n\nIf this sounds up your alley, you can learn more through Tweetsie Railroad's website, here."
