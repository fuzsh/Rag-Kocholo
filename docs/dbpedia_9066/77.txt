The Midnight Ghost Train is a totally badass rock band from Topeka, Kansas (though technically the band had originally formed in Buffalo, NY). This band of talented artists consists of Steve Moss on guitar/vocals, Brandon Burghart on drums, and Alfred Jordan on the bass. The three musicians have been categorized as Hard Rock, Stoner and heavy Blues – all genres that are evident on their newest album, Cypress Ave (Napalm).

Interestingly, the band’s name comes partially from a Hank Williams’ song lyric in ‘I’m So Lonesome I Could Cry’ – my personal favorite! According to the band’s website, on August 1st, 2007 a man named John Goff had passed away in his home in Abilene, Kansas from a severe asthma attack. This was the influential event that caused his best friend Steve Moss to start The Midnight Ghost Train as a eulogy to his dear friend.

Cypress Ave can be adequately summed up by only one word – brilliant. In every sense of the word! The musicality of the album is mind-blowing, and every section of every track was organized in such a captivating manner – everything worked like a well-oiled machine! It’s so groovy, but totally badass and heavy at the same time – you can literally listen to it no matter what mood you’re in, it’s that good! If you’re a fan of bluesy legends such as Tom Waits while also finding yourself constantly craving that mega-heaviness of the metal and hard rock genres, then look no further! The Midnight Ghost Train has got it going on.

The entire album is dripping with musical variety, and to say that it was enjoyable would be an understatement. From the strong, raspy vocals to the enchantingly haunting bass and drums, this album will quickly find its way to your heart.

Phenomenal, absolutely phenomenal.
