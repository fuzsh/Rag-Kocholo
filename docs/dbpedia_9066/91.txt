The steady ascent of bombastic blues rockers The Midnight Ghost Train looks set to continue into the New Year. Come late February/early March, the Topeka, Kansas, three-piece will issue their third album, Cold was the Ground, in 2015 as their debut on Napalm Records. It follows 2012’s hog-wild Buffalo (review here), and seems to have at least some commonality of artwork with that album, a lone figure standing against a single-color backdrop of rural America, complete with overgrown field. Only difference is that where Buffalo had a topless woman in sepia that seemed to convey a sentimentality for a time that never was, Cold was the Ground brings a black and white scowl of a man (fully dressed to a near-Baptist degree) standing in front of a house in squalor. If that’s some promise of how the two records might compare to each other sound-wise, the ground may be cold indeed when the new one arrives.

Already veterans of Roadburn, the Desertfests, Freak Valley (where the above photo was taken) and many others on extensive US and European tours over the last few years, The Midnight Ghost Train were announced this week as taking part in the 2015 Hellfest in Clisson, France, next June. This week, however, they’re kicking around the Midwest, presumably just because it hurts them to sit still for too long.
