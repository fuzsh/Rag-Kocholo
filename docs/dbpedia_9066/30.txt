Sons Of Node

Sons of Node is a three piece sludgy band based in Utrecht, The Netherlands. Foul & dissonant riffage combined with a bass sound as huge as a mammoth, backed by massive “brick in your face” drums is what they’re all about. All three of the hairy bastards top it off with their vocals, each one of them with their own style. Sons of Node’s sound might remind you of bands like Eyehategod & Kylesa
