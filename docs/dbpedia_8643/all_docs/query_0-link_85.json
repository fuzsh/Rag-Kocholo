        "text": "The construction of names and the use of nobility titles is not regulated by European Union law. Yet the Court of Justice of the EU has had to deal with such issues on various occasions where national rules on names or titles had to be contrasted with the EU law on equal treatment, Union citizenship and free movement and residence. Rules on names fall essentially within the competence of the member states, but the states have to regard EU law when exercising this competence. Our paper undertakes to analyse this issue in light of a recent relevant judgment, the Bogendorff von Wolffersdorff case, having regard also to the Court’s reasoning regarding the national constitutional identity clause [Art 4 (2)TEU]. We argue – inter alia – that the Court of Justice decided in this judgment not to favour the rights of a free-moving EU citizen (even if the judgment admittedly affects only a limited circle of individuals) and put national constitutional identity first, yet the way in which the i...\n\nThe present article is an attempt to answer the question about the position of the principle of respect for constitutional identities of Member States and its impact on the application of EU law in the national legal order. For this purpose three areas will be considered. Firstly, the analysis of the principle of respect for national identity in EU law and in the case law of the Court of Justice will be conducted. Secondly, the principle of competence entrusted to the EU will be analysed, together with its interpretation at the EU level. Thirdly, the understanding of the notion of constitutional identity in the case law of Constitutional Courts of selected Member States will be considered. It proved that the principle of respect for constitutional identity is treated both at national and EU level as an integral part of the concept of “national identity”. The national identity has a broad meaning and refers to values that are cherished by a particular nation, which it considers to be...\n\nThe Rule of Law and human rights are guaranteed by a multilevel approach (see Article 6 TEU), in terms of International Law together by national constitutions, human right acts and international conventions such as the European Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms.3 With the EU a supranational player takes an additional role. The EU and its understanding of EU Law as autonomous source and supremacy towards member states law a higher complexity of rules and decision making occurs. The question is as far as basic rights are strengthened? In any case these questions are relevant for the member and candidate states in South East Europe because primary law including the European Chapter of Fundamental Rights is part of the acquis communautaire, according to Article 20 IV TEU condition for accession to the EU. To understand the structure and impact of basic rights in the EU the following Article is structured in 3 chapters. Chapter 1 serves as basis to explain that these rights are genuinely and normatively linked to each other in EU Law. Both are expressively mentioned in Title I of the Treaties of Lisbon and the ECFR which demonstrates their importance and moreover an implementation in the principal structure of EU Law. For understanding the principal structure of EU Law and to cope with the Rule of Law as well as basic rights appropriately a basic knowledge of legal dogmatic with its methods of interpretation is required. Due to the specific structure of EU Law, Chapter 2 explains the principle of supremacy by analysing the “Solange” idea as created by the German Constitutional Court. “Solange” is more and more a principal for understanding and executing competencies. At the latest this has to be considered for the protection of Human Rights as well since the European Court for Protection of Human rights in its decisions refers to the “Solange” idea. An analysis of Article 53 ECFR shows that the EU legislator also takes the “Solange” idea into account. Thus, in Chapter 3 different questions will be raised provoked by this multilevel approach of national constitutions, international conventions and supranational rights, to find our if the different jurisdiction of the states, the EU and the ECHR have to be aligned, or at least competencies clarified."
