        "text": "5. What is my responsibility concerning the authenticity of document(s) an employee presents to me?\n\nYou must examine the original documentation, and if it reasonably appears to be genuine and to relate to the person presenting them, you must accept it. To do otherwise could be an unfair immigration-related employment practice. If the documentation does not reasonably appear to be genuine or to relate to the person presenting it, you must not accept it.\n\nHowever, you must provide the employee with an opportunity to present other documents from the Lists of Acceptable Documents.\n\n6. May I accept a copy of a document from an employee?\n\nEmployers examining employees’ documents in person may only accept original documentation from employees. The only exception is that an employee may present a certified copy of a birth certificate. E-Verify participants in good standing that choose to remotely examine employees’ Form I-9 documentation may accept copies of documentation, but must then view original documentation in a live video interaction, as explained in the Form I-9 instructions and in Section 4.5, Remote Document Examination (Optional Alternative Procedure to Physical Document Examination).\n\n7. When can employees present receipts for documents in place of actual documents from the Lists of Acceptable Documents?\n\nThe “receipt rule” is designed to cover situations in which an employee is authorized to work at the time of initial hire or reverification, but does not have the actual document listed on the Lists of Acceptable Documents. You cannot accept a receipt showing the employee has applied for an initial grant of employment authorization and/or an EAD. See Section 4.4, Acceptable Receipts, for more information.\n\n8. My new employee presented two documents to complete Form I-9, each containing a different last name. One document matches the name she entered in Section 1. The employee explained that she had just gotten married and changed her last name, but had not yet changed the name on the other document. Can I accept the document with the different name?\n\nYou may accept a document with a diﬀerent name than the name entered in Section 1 if the document reasonably relates to the employee. You also may attach a brief memo to the employee’s Form I-9 stating the reason for the name discrepancy, along with any supporting documentation she provides. An employee may provide documentation to support a name change, but is not required to do so. If you determine the document containing a different name does not reasonably appear to be genuine and to relate to the employee, you may ask her to provide other documents from the Lists of Acceptable Documents on Form I-9.\n\n9. The name on the document my employee presented to me is spelled slightly differently than the name they entered in Section 1 of Form I-9. Can I accept this document?\n\nIf the document contains a slight spelling variation, and the employee has a reasonable explanation for the variation, the document is acceptable if you are satisfied that the document otherwise reasonably appears to be genuine and to relate to the employee.\n\n10. My employee’s EAD expired and now they want to show me a Social Security card. Do I need to see a current DHS document?\n\nNo. During reverification, you must allow an employee to choose what document to present from either List A or List C. If the employee presents an unrestricted Social Security card, the employee does not also need to present a current DHS document. However, if the employee presents a restricted Social Security card, you must reject it since it is not an acceptable Form I-9 document and ask the employee to choose a diﬀerent document from List A or C."
