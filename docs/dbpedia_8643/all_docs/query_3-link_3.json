        "text": "Policies\n\nAugust 2024\n\nPlease refer to the full policy and guidelines for more detailed information.\n\n\"Harvard University\" is one of the most widely known and respected trademarks in the world.\n\nJust as the University prevents the unauthorized use of its name by third parties worldwide, there is also a need to ensure that use of the Harvard name and insignia by the University community is accurate and appropriate, and only in instances where there is institutional accountability. This concern prompted adoption of a new \"Use-of-Name\" policy by the Corporation in 1998 along with subsequent name related policies and guidelines.\n\nThe Use-of-Name policy changed the default assumption that many members of the Harvard community had prior to its adoption. Under the new policy, an activity can only be labeled as the “Harvard Project on XYZ\" or the “Harvard Study of ABC\" or anything similar under certain specific circumstances and only with advance permission of the Provost. In general, the most suitable name will often be in the form of \"The Project on X at the Harvard School of Y,\" rather than \"The Harvard Project on X.\" The Harvard Trademark Program is happy to work with members of the community to come up with the most appropriate name for any Harvard or Harvard School-based activity, group, unit, etc.\n\nIn general, using \"Harvard\" (by itself) in the name of an activity is appropriate when:\n\nThe program or activity is university-wide, meaning its structure and governance has substantial faculty involvement from faculty from at least three separate schools\n\nAND\n\nIt has institutional accountability in that it reports formally to university-wide officers, such as the President or Provost or a group of Deans from several Faculties.\n\nAND\n\nThere are not significant issues of confusion with the names of activities elsewhere in the University. (For example, the “Harvard Project on Government\" or the “Harvard Health Project\" would raise concerns of this nature, since there are many activities at the University related to health or government.)\n\nIt is important to note that participation does not equal governance. Although an activity might have participation from Harvard community members across many Harvard Schools and units, in order to meet criteria 1 and 2 and qualify as a University-wide activity, the structure and governance must be University-wide.\n\nThe most appropriate name for any activity will refer to the school, unit, or department at which it is based.\n\nExample: \"Project on Water Pollution at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health or “Animal Law and Policy Program at Harvard Law School.” When an activity seems to be University-wide but does not quite meet all the criteria listed in Question 2, the Trademark Program may approve an “at Harvard” designation, such as \"Project ABC at Harvard University.\"\n\nIt is also important to note that an “at Harvard” designation (e.g., “ABC Center at Harvard University”) is not interchangeable with a University-wide “Harvard” designation (e.g. “Harvard ABC Center”) and units should take special care to represent their approved name accurately in all contexts.\n\nAlthough it may seem convenient in some cases, ease of use or shortness of the name are not sufficient causes for an activity to use \"Harvard\" alone as part of a name or to receive approval for the use of a third-level harvard.edu domain name (e.g., ABC.harvard.edu).\n\nAny acronym or short form of an activity name should accurately reflect the approved name of an activity and should not inaccurately represent its affiliation. For example, the “Harvard Medical School Center for Bioethics” could use the short forms “HMS Center for Bioethics,” “Center for Bioethics,” “HMSCB”. The Center would not be able to use “Harvard Center for Bioethics” or “HCB,” as these short forms inaccurately represent the Center as a University-wide activity.\n\nHybrid acronyms in which “Harvard” alone is spelled out in full while other portions of the name are abbreviated (e.g., “Harvard ABC”), are not supported by University policy and may not be used.\n\nAll University activities must meet specific standards to be considered University-wide (see Question 2). Therefore, in order to use the name “Harvard” alone, any new project, program, or activity must independently meet the same standards.\n\nIn most cases, the governance of new projects created by University-wide activities rests within that University-wide activity. Therefore, the name of the new project should reference the name of that University-wide activity, rather than using a general “Harvard” designation.\n\nIn other words, when a University-wide activity creates a new program, that new program is not automatically, in and of itself, University-wide, and does not automatically warrant the use of a general “Harvard” in the name.\n\nFor example, say there is a University-wide activity called the Harvard Knitting Initiative and this initiative wants to create a new program on crochet. When naming the new program, the Harvard Knitting Initiative will need to choose a name that incorporates the Initiative’s full name, since the initiative is the program’s parent activity. For example, the program could be called something like “Harvard Knitting Initiative Program on Crochet” or “Crochet Program at the Harvard Knitting Initiative.” Policy, however, would not support a name like “Harvard Program on Crochet” or “Harvard Crochet Initiative\" which inaccurately suggest that the crochet program itself is University-wide.\n\nThe full policy on the Use of Harvard Names and Insignias in Electronic Contexts can be found here.\n\nIn general, the same standards are followed when creating domain names and email addresses as when creating activity names. If a project is University-wide, it could be positioned on a third-level \"harvard.edu\" domain (e.g., ABCcenter.harvard.edu). If it is based at a school or unit, it should be positioned as a sub-domain of the School or unit website (e.g., ABCcenter.law.harvard.edu or law.harvard.edu/ABCcenter).\n\nDomains and email addresses should not be confusingly similar to the domain or email address of another activity at the University. Activities that are positioned on @harvard.edu email aliases should include some indication of the department, unit, or office that owns the activity (e.g., HUIT_communications@​harvard.edu or trademark_useofname@harvard.edu)\n\nIn most cases, the appropriate domain for websites related to Harvard activities will be a “harvard.edu\" domain. The use of a domain name with any extension other than \".edu\" (e.g., .com, .org, .info) to host a website devoted to a Harvard-affiliated project or activity or as a pointer to a Harvard website are approved only in cases when an unusual, specific need can be demonstrated. Advance written permission must also be obtained from the Trademark Program and from the relevant Dean’s office or University administrator.\n\nIn some cases, general domains (i.e., \"international.harvard.edu\" or \"environment.harvard.edu\") have been approved as a \"portal\", with links to the websites of all major activities in an area across the university.\n\nThere is no provision in the Use-of-Name policy that automatically approves all previous uses of \"Harvard\" in the name of an activity. The initial review of existing programs was left to the Deans of each Faculty and some names have been changed since the policy was adopted. Longer-term, the approach has been to permit continued usage for a period of time in some cases where a substantial history of activity exists, but to review for consistency with the policy as new activities of that project develop. So, for example, an activity that may not meet current standards for use of name, but was funded under a five-year grant, might be permitted to continue the name for the period of the grant, but then the name would be modified when new funding was sought. These situations are handled on a case-by-case basis in collaboration with the Dean's designees at each school and any requests to change or update existing names requires that the new name comply with current policy.\n\nThe same guidelines apply to using Harvard shields, insignia, and logos as to Harvard names. The shield or logo used for an activity should accurately reflect the School or unit that the activity is affiliated with, and approval should come from the appropriate Dean. For example, a University-wide activity may be represented by way of the Harvard Veritas shield if it meets the criteria for being University-wide and has been approved as such by the Provost. Alternatively, a Harvard Medical School activity should be represented with the Harvard Medical School shield specifically, with permission from Medical School Dean.\n\nFor more information on creating a new logo for your activity or organization, please see the Guidelines for the Creation of a New Shield Design or Logo by Harvard Departments, Units, and Officially Recognized Organizations for Themselves or Their Activities.\n\nHarvard units should represent themselves on their own websites, publications, etc. using a shield or logo that accurately represents their affiliation with the University. For example, a Harvard T.H. Chan School pamphlet should use the Harvard T.H. Chan School shield specifically, rather than the general Harvard Veritas shield.\n\nThe use of any Harvard names or insignia on any third-party websites must be reviewed and approved by the Harvard Trademark Program on a case-by-case basis. This applies to all non-Harvard entities, including businesses, non-profits, and organizations, and also applies in cases where a relationship exists between a Harvard unit and a third party. This is to ensure that any representation is consistent with the University’s policies on accurate representation and non-endorsement.\n\nThe University has specific rules for its schools and units wishing to order insignia products or “Swag” items. These products must be ordered from licensed vendors, they must meet certain design criteria, and they must be approved by the appropriate parties.\n\nFor the full process, please see the Guidelines for Ordering Internal Insignia Items (“SWAG”) for Harvard Schools, Departments, Units, and Officially Recognized Student Organizations and Affiliates.\n\nWhile we understand why Harvard alumni would want to proudly display the Harvard name and relevant Harvard shield on a personal or business website, such use is not permitted since Harvard reserves the use of its trademarks (names and shields/logos) for its own purposes.\n\nWith that being said, Harvard alumni may certainly list their Harvard degree/affiliation in a biographical section on the website or other locations and make other such “fair use” descriptive and factual statements about their degree from Harvard, but no shields or logos may be used.\n\nThe Harvard name and logo may never be used to imply any affiliation with or endorsement by Harvard, and alumni cannot use Harvard’s name as part of any commercial activity, business promotion, or other such purposes, even if those companies were the result of ideas that started at Harvard. Alumni also may not use any Harvard shields or insignia.\n\nNames for student organizations that include the Harvard name or any other Harvard trademarks are used by permission of the University and, as a result, are subject to the standard of accurate representation which states that, “The University and its members have a responsibility to ensure that any implied association with the University [through the use of the Harvard name] is accurate.”\n\nBefore creating a name for a new student organization (or changing the name of an existing one), students should consult with their School’s student organization administrator or comparable student activities officer in order to ensure that the resulting name is in accord with the standard of accurate representation and any supplemental guidelines and student group naming conventions the school may have in place for the naming of student organizations.\n\nThe University’s standard trademark language should be included in any agreement between Harvard and a third-party. This language was developed specifically to protect the University’s name and trademarks. Any departure from this language must be vetted by both the Office of General Counsel and the Harvard Trademark Program.\n\nThe intent of this language is not to prevent third parties from factually referencing their relationship with the University – it simply protects Harvard from any third-party using the “Harvard Names” without express permission and also requires that any representations that veer from what is permitted in the Agreement be reviewed by the Harvard Trademark Program to ensure that it is consistent with Harvard’s use-of-name policies and guidelines.\n\nFor a copy of the University's standard trademark language for contracts, please contact the Harvard Trademark Program.\n\nWhen representing yourself and your affiliation with the University in relation to any outside activity, the reference should be consistent with the University’s standards of accurate representation and non-endorsement. In practice, this means that Harvard community members should assure that the Harvard name is used in a manner that does not imply University endorsement or responsibility for the particular activity, product, or publication involved.\n\nHarvard policy does not allow the use of a Harvard title while engaging in activities on behalf of a third-party. If you are employed or otherwise working for an outside entity, you should always represent yourself by way of your position with that entity (e.g., “Jane Doe, Founder of Company” or “John Smith, affiliated researcher”) whenever you are working on their behalf. This includes your primary title on the entity’s website, marketing activities, solicitations, and press releases. The only context in which you should reference your Harvard affiliation is in a factual, designated biographical section of the third-party’s materials. This reference must be limited to an accurate and specific description of your title and may not include a Harvard shield or logo. Contact information should also be limited to a personal email address or an email address affiliated with that third-party, rather than any @harvard.edu email address.\n\nProvided all of the above conditions are met, faculty and staff may use the Harvard name to identify their title or affiliation with the University (e.g., \"Jane Doe, Professor of Economics, Harvard University\") in connection with activities conducted with outside individuals and entities (e.g., authoring a book) and students are permitted to identify themselves in publications or other public activities with an accurate, specific affiliation (e.g. \"John Doe, LL.M. candidate, Harvard Law School\" or \"student, Harvard College\") that makes it clear they are students.\n\nThere are many types of relationships between Harvard units and outside parties, and in some cases those parties might want to be represented on a Harvard website, publication, etc. by way of their logo. For example, they might sponsor a Harvard activity, they might be a preferred vendor, or they could be a collaborator on mission-related content.\n\nThe use of any third-party names or logos in relation to a Harvard activity, website, publication, etc. must be reviewed and approved by the Harvard Trademark Program on a case-by-case basis. This applies to all non-Harvard entities, including businesses, non-profits, and organizations, and also applies in cases where a relationship exists between a Harvard unit and the third party. This is to ensure that any representation is consistent with the University’s policies on accurate representation and non-endorsement.\n\nHarvard does not endorse, either expressly or implicitly, the products or services of external parties, including those that have transactional relationships with the University. The University also, understandably, reserves the use of the Harvard name and insignia for its own purposes, and not for the promotional or marketing purposes of outside entities.\n\nActions that endorse a third party, such as testimonials, references, and case studies, are not permitted by University policy. Although a particular action might not seem like an endorsement, from a policy perspective, even a strictly factual statement (like using a Harvard affiliate’s title, or a statement that a Harvard unit is a customer of the company) becomes an implied endorsement when it is positioned in a promotional context, such as third-party sales and marketing materials or activities.\n\nDisclaimers do not mitigate the implied endorsement of these actions. A disclaimer should only be used in conjunction with, and not in place of, accurate, non-promotional representations that are supported by policy, and the conditions for using the Harvard name still apply even if a disclaimer is used.\n\nYou are free, of course, to provide an endorsement in your personal capacity as an individual, and not on behalf of Harvard. If you choose to do so, the Harvard name cannot be used in any context related to the endorsement, as it would imply a University endorsement of that third-party and their product or service. You should not reference your affiliation with the University, or use the Harvard name more generally, in either your comments or your introduction. Instead of using your Harvard title or affiliation, you will want to use your professional, field-related credentials only (e.g., “Jane Doe, Director of IT Service Management” or “John Smith, graduate student in biochemistry”). In a similar manner, descriptions of Harvard Schools and units should be generalized to avoid the use of the Harvard name, such as using “our University’s Business School” as opposed to “Harvard Business School.”\n\nIf you have any questions about whether a particular action might be considered an endorsement, or if you think that a factual statement might be appropriate in some context, please contact the Harvard Trademark Program so they can work with you in determining the best course of action.\n\nWe recognize that there are many different types of relationships – partnerships, collaborations, memberships, vendor relationships, sponsorships, and more. The University defines these relationships very specifically, and the ways in which that outside entity can use the Harvard name and logo will depend on the type of relationship that exists between the parties.\n\nAs a result, the use of any Harvard names or logos by outside entities must be reviewed and approved by the Harvard Trademark Program on a case-by-case basis.\n\nWhen submitting requests to the Harvard Trademark Program, we will need to know the type of relationship, as well as a description, a mockup, or draft of how the Harvard name or insignia will be used. For any collaborations, please also send a copy of any agreements that exist between the parties.\n\nPlease note that typically, vendors are only permitted to reference their relationship with the University in a comprehensive list of their company’s clients, provided that list meets certain criteria. The list should include the name of the specific School or unit with which it has a relationship (with no logo), and the name must be included in a manner that is not more prominent than the other names in the list. The list itself must be clearly identified as a client/customer list in a factual, non-promotional manner.\n\nQuestions regarding the University’s use-of-name policies and the application of those policies to the use of the Harvard name and insignia should be submitted in writing to the Harvard Trademark Program at trademark_useofname@harvard.edu. In addition, each school has one (and in a few cases more than one) representative designated as a liaison for questions regarding the use of the school’s name and insignia by faculty, staff and students within that school. Those contacts are listed here."
