        "text": "(a) the appellant was not entitled by virtue of his special constitutional position in Spain as a “sovereign”, to the personal immunity afforded under section 20(1)(a) SIA following his abdication;\n\n(b) nor was he a member of the household of King Felipe VI for the purposes of immunity under section 20(1)(b) SIA;\n\n(c) so far as the pre-abdication acts are concerned, the claim for harassment was not (even arguably) within the sphere of governmental or sovereign activity for the purposes of section 14(1) SIA. On the contrary, harassment is an act that any private citizen can perform;\n\n(d) as for the individual acts relied upon as part of the course of conduct amounting to harassment, these did not give rise to functional immunity under section 14(1) SIA;\n\n(e) in particular, in relation to the alleged covert operation to gain entry to the respondent's home in Monaco, a case of functional immunity under section 14(1) SIA was not made out on the basis of the case as it then stood, but the judge observed that if evidence subsequently emerged which suggested that those who arranged or undertook the search were “state-sponsored” the issue could be revisited;\n\n(f) in relation to other acts alleged to have been carried out by General Sanz Roldán, the mere fact that the General was Director of the CNI was not enough to justify treating harassing threats, by email or telephone, as having been done in that capacity;\n\n(g) finally, the respondent's reliance on the exception to state immunity in section 5 SIA was rejected because her claim included no claim to have sustained a recognised psychiatric injury as a result of the alleged harassment and was therefore not a claim for personal injury within the terms of section 5 SIA.\n\n(a) in reaching his substantive conclusion, the judge adopted an erroneous approach to the legal test by considering only whether the cause of action (namely, harassment) was of a nature that any private citizen could perform, and by failing to conduct a closer analysis of the individual acts alleged and, in particular, to consider whether they were done “under colour of authority” whatever their motive (ground 1);\n\n(b) the judge wrongly proceeded on the basis of an anticipated amendment, in the absence of any formal application to amend, without sight of draft proposed amendments or any examination of the merits of the proposed amendment. He compounded the error by giving permission to amend on an anticipated basis in the course of hearing the state immunity application and this constituted a serious procedural irregularity (ground 2); and\n\n(c) wrongly and in error of law, the judge concluded that he could defer resolution of the immunity plea in relation to the alleged targeting of the respondent's home in Monaco (pleaded at paragraph 16 of the Particulars of Claim) and relied on this possibility in support of his dismissal of the immunity claim (ground 4)."
