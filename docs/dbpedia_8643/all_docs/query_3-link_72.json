        "text": "The early signs of dementia are very subtle and vague, and may not be immediately obvious. Early symptoms also depend on the type of dementia and vary a great deal from person to person.\n\nEarly symptoms of dementia\n\nAlthough the early signs vary, common early symptoms of dementia include:\n\nmemory problems, particularly remembering recent events\n\nincreasing confusion\n\nreduced concentration\n\npersonality or behaviour changes\n\napathy and withdrawal or depression\n\nloss of ability to do everyday tasks.\n\nSometimes, people fail to recognise that these symptoms indicate that something is wrong. They may mistakenly assume that such behaviour is a normal part of the ageing process. Symptoms may also develop gradually and go unnoticed for a long time. Also, some people may refuse to act, even when they know something is wrong.\n\nTen warning signs of dementia\n\nGo through the following checklist of the common symptoms of dementia. If the person affected has several of these signs, consult a doctor for a complete assessment.\n\nDementia and memory loss\n\nIt’s normal to occasionally forget appointments and remember them later. A person with dementia may forget things more often or not remember them at all.\n\nDementia and difficulty with tasks\n\nPeople can get distracted and they may forget to serve part of a meal. A person with dementia may have trouble with all the steps involved in preparing a meal.\n\nDementia and disorientation\n\nA person with dementia may have difficulty finding their way to a familiar place or feel confused about where they are, or think they are back in some past time of their life.\n\nDementia and language problems\n\nEveryone has trouble finding the right word sometimes, but a person with dementia may forget simple words or substitute inappropriate words, making sentences difficult to understand. They may also have trouble understanding others.\n\nDementia and changes in abstract thinking\n\nManaging finances can be difficult for anyone, but a person with dementia may have trouble knowing what the numbers mean or what to do with them.\n\nDementia and poor judgement\n\nMany activities require good judgement. When this ability is affected by dementia, the person may have difficulty making appropriate decisions, such as what to wear in cold weather.\n\nDementia and poor spatial skills\n\nA person with dementia may have difficulty judging distance or direction when driving a car.\n\nDementia and misplacing things\n\nAnyone can temporarily misplace a wallet or keys. A person with dementia may not know what the keys are for.\n\nDementia and mood, personality or behaviour changes\n\nEveryone becomes sad or moody from time to time. Someone with dementia can have rapid mood swings, for no apparent reason. They can become confused, suspicious or withdrawn. Some can become disinhibited or more outgoing.\n\nDementia and loss of initiative\n\nIt is normal to tire of some activities. Dementia may cause a person to lose interest in previously enjoyed activities or require cues prompting them to become involved.\n\nConditions with symptoms similar to dementia\n\nRemember that many conditions have symptoms similar to dementia, so it is important not to assume that someone has dementia just because some of the above symptoms are present. Strokes, depression, excessive long-term alcohol consumption, infections, hormonal disorders, nutritional deficiencies and brain tumours can all cause dementia-like symptoms. Many of these conditions can be treated.\n\nDiagnosis of dementia\n\nThe best place to start the diagnostic process is talking with the person’s local doctor or a Cognitive Dementia and Memory Service (CDAMS) clinic about getting a diagnosis is critical at an early stage. Only a doctor can diagnose dementia. A correct diagnosis of dementia at an early stage is important for early treatment, support and planning for the future.\n\nA complete medical assessment may identify a treatable condition and make sure that it is treated correctly, or it may confirm the presence of dementia and whether it is Alzheimer’s disease or another type of dementia. Six types of assessment can help to confirm or exclude a diagnosis of dementia.\n\nMedical history\n\nThe doctor will ask about past and current medical problems, family medical history, any medications being taken and the problems with memory, thinking or behaviour that are causing concern. The doctor may also wish to speak to a close family member who can help provide all the necessary information.\n\nPhysical examination\n\nTo help rule out other conditions, a physical examination may include tests of the senses, movement, and heart and lung function.\n\nLaboratory tests\n\nThese will include a variety of blood and urine tests to identify any possible illness that could be responsible for the symptoms. In some cases, a small sample of spinal fluid may be collected for testing.\n\nCognitive testing\n\nA variety of tests are used to assess thinking abilities, including memory, language, attention and problem-solving. This can help identify specific problem areas, which in turn helps identify the underlying cause or the type of dementia.\n\nBrain imaging\n\nThere are certain scans that look at the structure of the brain and are used to rule out brain tumours or blood clots in the brain as the reason for symptoms.\n\nSome scans can also detect patterns of brain tissue loss that can differentiate between different types of dementia. Other types of scans look at how active certain parts of the brain are and can also help determine the type of dementia.\n\nPsychiatric assessment\n\nPsychiatric assessment helps to identify treatable disorders, such as depression and to manage any psychiatric symptoms, such as anxiety or delusions that may occur along with dementia.\n\nTalking with a doctor\n\nAfter considering the person’s symptoms and ordering screening tests, the doctor may offer a preliminary diagnosis or refer the person to a Cognitive Dementia and Memory Service (CDAMS) clinic, neurologist, geriatrician or psychiatrist.\n\nSome people may be resistant to the idea of visiting a doctor. In some cases, people do not realise, or else they deny, that there is anything wrong with them. This can be due to the brain changes of dementia that interfere with the ability to recognise or appreciate the changes occurring. Others have an insight of the changes, but may be afraid of having their fears confirmed.\n\nOne of the most effective ways to overcome this problem is to find another reason for a visit to the doctor. Perhaps suggest a check-up for a symptom that the person is willing to acknowledge, such as blood pressure, or suggest a review of a long-term condition or medication.\n\nAnother way is to suggest that it is time for both of you to have a physical check-up. Any expressed anxiety by the person is an excellent opportunity to suggest a visit to the doctor. Be sure to provide a lot of reassurance. A calm, caring attitude at this time can help overcome the person's very real worries and fears.\n\nSometimes, your friend or family member may refuse to visit the doctor to ask about their symptoms. You can take a number of actions to get support including:\n\ntalking with other carers who may have had to deal with similar situations\n\ncontacting your local Aged Care Assessment Team (ACAT)External Link\n\ncalling the National Dementia HelplineExternal Link .\n\nWhere to get help"
