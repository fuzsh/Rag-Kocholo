        "text": "Steroids are naturally made by our bodies in small amounts. They help to control many functions including the immune system, reducing inflammation and blood pressure.\n\nSteroids can also be made in the laboratory (manufactured). They are a treatment for many different conditions and diseases. The information on this page is about steroids used in cancer treatment.\n\nYou usually have a type of steroids called corticosteroids. These are manufactured versions of the hormones produced by the adrenal glands .\n\nSteroids used in cancer treatment include the drugs in the list below. Next to each drug name we have added how you pronounce it:\n\nprednisolone (pred-nis-oh-lone)\n\nmethylprednisolone (meeth-ul-pred-nis-oh-lone)\n\ndexamethasone (deks-uh-meth-uh-zone)\n\nhydrocortisone (hi-dro-kort-uh-zone)\n\nWhat do steroids do?\n\nSteroids help control many body functions including:\n\nhow your body uses food to produce energy (metabolism)\n\nkeeping the balance of salt and water in your body\n\nregulating blood pressure\n\nreducing allergies and inflammation\n\ncontrolling mood and behaviour\n\nWhy are steroids used in cancer treatment?\n\nThere are a number of reasons you might have steroids as part of your cancer treatment.\n\nThey can:\n\ntreat the cancer itself\n\nreduce inflammation\n\nhelp prevent an allergic reaction to cancer treatments\n\nreduce your body’s immune response, for example after a bone marrow transplant\n\nhelp reduce sickness when having cancer treatment\n\nimprove your appetite\n\nYou might have them:\n\nwhen you are first diagnosed\n\nbefore and after surgery\n\nbefore and after radiotherapy\n\nbefore, during and after cancer treatment\n\nfor an advanced cancer\n\nHow do you have steroids?\n\nThe most common ways of taking steroids during cancer treatment are as:\n\ntablets or liquid (take them after a meal or with milk as they can irritate your stomach)\n\nan injection into a vein (intravenous)\n\ndrops that go into the eye (eye drops)\n\na cream that you put on the affected area\n\nHow often do you have steroids?\n\nThe amount (dose) and length of steroid treatment is different depending on why you're having steroids.\n\nYou might need to take them:\n\nevery other day\n\nonce a day\n\nseveral times a day\n\nStopping steroid treatment\n\nSteroid safety cards\n\nYour healthcare team may give you a small card to carry with you while you are taking steroids. This is so that anyone else treating you, such as your dentist or in an emergency, knows that you are on steroids.\n\nThere are 2 types of card:\n\nSteroid Treatment Card (blue card)\n\nYou should have a steroid treatment card if you take steroids for more than 3 weeks.\n\nNHS Steroid Emergency Card (red card)\n\nYou should have this card if you are dependant on daily steroid use. This means your body has problems making enough of a hormone called cortisol. It is made by the adrenal glands. The pituitary gland controls how much cortisol is made. Having this problem can affect your body’s ability to cope with stress. This might be from an infection, surgery or injury for example. Knowing this allows the healthcare team to give you prompt medical treatment.\n\nSome of the conditions which make you at risk include:\n\nAddison's disease\n\nCongenital Adrenal Hyperplasia (CAH)\n\nhaving had both your adrenal glands removed (bilateral adrenalectomy)\n\nyour pituitary gland not making enough hormones (hypopituitarism)\n\nTests\n\nYou have blood tests before and during your treatment. They check your levels of blood cells and other substances in the blood. They also check how well your liver and kidneys are working.\n\nWhat are the side effects of steroids?\n\nWe haven't listed all the side effects. You may get some of them, but it is very unlikely that you will have all of them. You might have some of the side effects at the same time.\n\nHow often and how severe the side effects are can vary from person to person. We’re unable to give an idea of the frequency of these side effects because it depends on:\n\nwhat other treatment you are having. For example, your side effects could be worse if you are also having other drugs or radiotherapy\n\nthe aim of the steroid treatment (for example to treat your cancer or to help with symptoms)\n\nif you’re taking steroids short or longer term\n\nthe dose of steroids\n\nWhen to contact your team\n\nYour doctor or nurse will go through the possible side effects. They will monitor you closely during treatment and check how you are at your appointments. Contact your advice line as soon as possible if:\n\nyou have severe side effects\n\nyour side effects aren’t getting any better\n\nyour side effects are getting worse\n\nYou might have one or more of these side effects. They include:\n\nIncreased risk of infection\n\nSteroids can hide or change the signs and symptoms of some infections. They might also make it harder for your body to deal with an infection. This means infections are more difficult to diagnose at an early stage.\n\nSymptoms of an infection include a change in temperature, aching muscles, headaches, feeling cold and shivery and generally unwell. You might have other symptoms depending on where the infection is.\n\nInfections can sometimes be life threatening. You should contact your advice line urgently if you think you have an infection.\n\nChicken pox and shingles\n\nKeep away from people who have chicken pox or shingles whilst taking steroids if you have never had these illnesses. They could make you very ill.\n\nIf you do come into contact with someone who has them, tell your healthcare team straight away.\n\nMood changes\n\nYour moods might change while taking steroids. You might be feeling:\n\nanxious\n\nmore emotional than usual\n\nhigh (mania) or extreme moods swings\n\nAround 5 out of every 100 people (around 5%) experience serious mental health problems when they take steroids. This includes depression. Let your healthcare team know if you notice any changes in your emotional or psychological wellbeing. Also let them know if you or any family members have ever had depression or manic depression (bipolar disorder).\n\nSteroids can cause a reaction called steroid induced psychosis. People can become excited, confused and imagine things that aren’t real. This can be frightening, but it goes away when you stop taking the steroids.\n\nChanges in blood sugar levels\n\nYou might have regular blood and urine tests to check this. Some people develop diabetes . You might need to have blood sugar lowering treatment. But your sugar levels usually go back to normal shortly after you stop taking steroids.\n\nIf you have diabetes already, you might need to check your blood sugar levels more often than usual.\n\nIncreased appetite and weight gain\n\nSteroids can increase your appetite. Feeling hungrier can make it difficult to keep your weight down. Your appetite will go back to normal when you stop steroids - but some people need to diet to lose the extra weight.\n\nTalk to your nurse or your dietitian about how to safely control your weight.\n\nFluid build up\n\nA build up of fluid may cause swelling in your arms, hands, ankles, legs, face and other parts of the body. Contact your healthcare team if this happens to you.\n\nDifficulty sleeping\n\nIt can help to change a few things about when and where you sleep. Try to go to bed and get up at the same time each day and spend some time relaxing before you go to bed. Some light exercise each day may also help.\n\nTry and take your steroids in the morning or around lunchtime.\n\nIndigestion or heartburn\n\nTake your tablets after a meal or with milk as they can irritate your stomach.\n\nSteroids can cause ulcers in the stomach or top part of the small bowel (duodenum).\n\nTell your doctor or nurse if you have:\n\na gnawing or burning pain in your tummy (abdomen)\n\nindigestion\n\nheartburn\n\nChanges to your face and appearance (Cushing's syndrome)\n\nYou might develop:\n\na swollen or puffy face\n\nstretch marks\n\nacne\n\nincreased facial hair\n\nYou might put on weight around your tummy (abdomen).\n\nThis can be quite upsetting. Talk to your doctor or nurse about any of these side effects.\n\nHigh blood pressure\n\nTell your doctor or nurse if you have headaches, nosebleeds, blurred or double vision or shortness of breath. You have your blood pressure checked regularly.\n\nEye problems\n\nYou might have eye problems including:\n\nclouding of the lens of the eye (cataracts)\n\nglaucoma (damage to an eyesight nerve)\n\neye infections\n\nproblems with your vision, such as blurred vision due to increased pressure on the eyesight nerve\n\nLet your doctor or nurse know if you have any problems with your eyes.\n\nSkin changes\n\nSome of the skin changes might include:\n\nrashes\n\nskin thinning\n\nbruising\n\nstretch marks\n\nredness and inflammation\n\nWounds might take longer to heal than usual.\n\nWeaker bones\n\nYou might have weaker bones due to bone loss (osteoporosis). This can increase your risk of breaking (fracturing) bones.\n\nDizziness and loss of balance (vertigo)\n\nYou might feel dizzy and you may feel as though the room is spinning. This is vertigo. Let your doctor or nurse know if this happens.\n\nIncreased numbers of white blood cells\n\nSteroids can increase the number of white blood cells in your blood. Your doctor might see this on a full blood count test.\n\nHair changes\n\nYou might have more body hair than usual. Your head hair may thin. This is usually not noticeable by other people but can be upsetting.\n\nHeart problems\n\nSteroids can cause severe heart problems if you have had a recent heart attack.\n\nMuscle wasting\n\nYour legs may feel weaker and walking or climbing stairs may be more difficult. You may have aching muscles for a short while after stopping treatment.\n\nHeadaches\n\nTell your healthcare team if you keep getting headaches. They can give you painkillers to help.\n\nGrowth problems in children\n\nSteroids might cause growth problems in babies, children and teenagers. Your child’s doctor will look at the benefits and risks of prescribing high doses of steroids for your child\n\nLow levels of potassium in your blood\n\nA low level of potassium in the blood is called hypokalaemia. You might have blood tests during cancer treatment to check for this.\n\nBurning or tingling around your bottom\n\nYou might have a burning or tingling sensation around your bottom during a steroid injection into a vein (intravenous). It usually goes once the injection finishes. Your nurse will give the injection slowly to try and prevent this.\n\nEpilepsy becoming worse\n\nIf you have epilepsy this could become worse when taking steroids.\n\nBlood clots\n\nBlood clots can develop in the deep veins of your body, usually the leg. This is called deep vein thrombosis (DVT). A blood clot can be very serious if it travels to your lungs (pulmonary embolism), although this isn’t common.\n\nSymptoms of a blood clot include:\n\n• pain, redness and swelling around the area where the clot is and may feel warm to touch\n\n• breathlessness\n\n• pain in your chest or upper back – dial 999 if you have chest pain\n\n• coughing up blood\n\nInflammation of the pancreas\n\nThis drug can cause inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis). Tell your doctor straight away if you have sudden and severe pain in your tummy (abdomen).\n\nChanges to your periods\n\nWomen might have irregular periods, or they stop altogether (amenorrhoea).\n\nLiver changes\n\nYou might have liver changes that are usually mild and unlikely to cause symptoms. They usually go back to normal when treatment finishes. You have regular blood tests to check for any changes in the way your liver is working.\n\nCoping with side effects\n\nWe have more information about side effects and tips on how to cope with them.\n\nWhat else do you need to know?\n\nOther medicines, food and drink\n\nCancer drugs can interact with medicines, herbal products, and some food and drinks. We are unable to list all the possible interactions that may happen. An example is grapefruit or grapefruit juice which can increase the side effects of certain drugs.\n\nTell your healthcare team about any medicines you are taking. This includes vitamins, herbal supplements and over the counter remedies. Also let them know about any other medical conditions or allergies you may have.\n\nPregnancy and contraception\n\nThis treatment might harm a baby developing in the womb. Talk to your doctor or nurse about effective contraception before starting your cancer treatment. Let them know straight away if you or your partner falls pregnant while having treatment.\n\nBreastfeeding\n\nThere is evidence that steroid drugs may come through into your breast milk. Talk about breastfeeding with your doctor. You can make a decision together based on the benefits to you and the possible risks to your baby.\n\nOther conditions\n\nIf you are having tests or treatment for anything else, always mention that you are taking steroids.\n\nImmunisations\n\nDon’t have immunisations with live vaccines while you’re having treatment and for up to 12 months afterwards. The length of time depends on the treatment you are having. Ask your doctor or pharmacist how long you should avoid live vaccinations.\n\nIn the UK, live vaccines include rubella, mumps, measles, BCG, yellow fever and the shingles vaccine (Zostavax).\n\nYou might be able to have other vaccinations if you have had:\n\nsmall doses of steroids for a short period of time (less than 2 weeks)\n\nlocal steroid treatment, such as eye drops or creams\n\nAvoid close contact with people who’ve recently had live vaccines taken by mouth (oral vaccines) such as oral polio or the typhoid vaccine.\n\nThis also includes the rotavirus vaccine given to babies. The virus is in the baby’s poo for up to 2 weeks and could make you ill. So, avoid changing their nappies for 2 weeks after their vaccination if possible. Or wear disposable gloves and wash your hands well afterwards.\n\nYou should also avoid close contact with children who have had the flu vaccine nasal spray if your immune system is severely weakened.\n\nMore information about this treatment\n\nFor further information about this treatment and possible side effects go to the electronic Medicines Compendium (eMC) website. You can find the patient information leaflet on this website.\n\nYou can report any side effect you have to the Medicines Health and Regulatory Authority (MHRA) as part of their Yellow Card Scheme."
