        "text": "Post/Author/DateTimePost#1zombiegleemaxSep 23, 2003 16:22:46I know that Erik Mona and other people who have been involved with the creation of official Grayhawk products have posted here in the past, so if any of them still are, I have a suggestion:\n\nIt's really, really annoying and unnecessary to have five countries in the Flaneass with two names between them. Do we really need three Uleks and two Urnsts? My players are constantly forgetting not only which one is which but which one they're currently in! Even as the GM, I cannot for the life of me manage to keep the County, Principality, Duchy, etc seperate in my mind consistantly.\n\nWould it be too much to ask to ditch this silly and confusing approach and give each country on the map its own name in a future product? It would save me a lot of headaches and confusion.#2HalberkillSep 23, 2003 17:33:37 Heh\n\nheh heh\n\nHalber#3zombiegleemaxSep 23, 2003 19:36:52 Wow, Yamo, I can't tell if you're being serious or sarcastic. I hope the latter. #4zombiegleemaxSep 23, 2003 20:03:06\n\nWow, Yamo, I can't tell if you're being serious or sarcastic. I hope the latter.\n\nNope. Completely serious. You must admit, the setting gains nothing by having so many countries with such similar names. All it does is make it more difficult to keep them all straight. It would be smarter design to give them unique names for ease of use.\n\nSuch a change could easily be explained in setting terms, as well. Not all the modern nations in the Greyhawk setting were always known by the names the are today. Perhaps the Urnst and Ulek states (or just their rulers) simply decided to assert their individuality a little more by taking more unique titles for each of their realms. There's plenty of historical precident for such a thing. Look at how many name changes Russia alone went through in the last century on Earth.\n\nIf you don't look at it in terms of tradition for tradition's sake, it really is a more sensible and elegant way to handle it.#5erik_monaSep 23, 2003 20:03:18 That's assuming there will be future products.\n\nFor stuff set in 591, the nations are different. If WotC ever decides to \"fast forward\" the world, I would probably suggest trimming or merging a handful of countries, and I suspect the Uleks and Urnsts would be first on the list.\n\n--Erik#6zombiegleemaxSep 23, 2003 20:22:04 Your problem with the naming is one of convention not of actuality.\n\nIf you want nations to be named conveniently, use Faerun. Political forces are what drive the naming of countries in Greyhawk, not the artificial conventions of the settings users.\n\nNow, if you have a hard time with the naming, I suggest YOU do something about it. Have Turrosh Mak find some source of power that enables him to send more troops into the Ulek states, forcing them to work together against the common threat and in so doing, require a Field General to oversee all military operations and then, in fit of pique at the political machinations of the various states, have him perform a coup and join the states as one, the Kingdom of Ulek, united against the goblinoid armies.\n\nOr whatever takes your fancy. Instead of whinging to the writers, whose hands are tied, do something about it yourself, in your own campaign. Mould it to your liking. That's what Greyhawk is for... it's your world, do with it what you will.#7zombiegleemaxSep 23, 2003 20:27:09 Just grab the original setting in pdf format and be done with it! #8samwiseSep 23, 2003 20:50:01 Why is it confusing and silly?\n\nThere are many real instances of countries, provinces really, sharing part of their name. Why the need for such a gratuitous change?\n\nWhile I certainly think a number of political changes are needed, changing names just for the sake of it is hardly a good basis for developing a setting.#9zombiegleemaxSep 24, 2003 1:08:52 Are your players confused by the Dakota's, Virginia's and the Carolina's also? I'm referring to the states not their classmates.\n\nIf it is a problem you can fix it quickly as the DM. A dynastic marriage can unite the Urnst states. The cost of the ongoing Wars with Turosh Mak could bankrupt the Ulek states. Since Keoland has given up its imperial policies, they could rejoin Keoland. Personally, I hate both of these possibilities, but they would remove the problem for your players.#10zombiegleemaxSep 25, 2003 19:23:27 \"You must admit, the setting gains nothing by having so many countries with such similar names.\"\n\nYou mean aside from an aura of potential historical accuracy and an increase in the feeling of immersion in something that really truly could have evolved over centuries? That's one of GH's strengths, if you ask me.#11zombiegleemaxSep 26, 2003 0:59:02 sure that every one that lived (or lives) in waht used be Germany, then east and west Germany , then back to Germany Would be so willing to say that it was a \"dumb thing\" that the had the same name- Get over it and move on !#12zombiegleemaxSep 26, 2003 8:32:26 You know, maybe I'm going out on a limb here, Tai, but I'm fairly certain that the Germans wanted a unified Germany for far more important reasons than mere potentially confusing names. :D#13rlwildeSep 26, 2003 20:25:16 While we're at it, can we make West Virginia rejoin Viriginia? And do we really need two Dakotas?\n\nSeriously, though, I think having multiple Urnsts and Uleks adds to the \"feel\" of the setting. Although I still can't keep straight what races dominate which Ulek...#14zombiegleemaxSep 28, 2003 2:14:51 Sorry, you're getting flamed Yamo. But the other posters have a point. The states of Ulek were originally a single people and in a sense still are the same nation, but three distinct, independent political entities. Same goes for Urnst. The \"official\" titles of the North Kingdom and Ahlissa both imply association with the Aerdy. As others have said, no one confuses North Dakota with South Dakota, or British Columbia with Columbia. I think it's just an issue of familarity. Once you and your players have a bit more experience with the setting, you'll wonder why you ever suggested such a silly thing.#15zombiegleemaxSep 28, 2003 5:50:40 Yeah, I live in germany.\n\nBefore 1989, it was relly confusing: Did I live in west or east germany? It was really a mess, none of my classmates in scool could remember these silly name conventions. Federal repulic of germany? German democratic republic?\n\nWhy couldn't they find unique names for both countries?\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n;)#16zombiegleemaxSep 28, 2003 13:22:43 The biggest problem is getting those darn countries to agree. Its obvious the Ulecks and Urnsts peoples all liked the original name of their country. But now that they are seperate countries who gets to keep the name? Im sure each of the Uleck states wouldnt mind being the only Uleck, but who is going to convince the other ones to give the name up? Its a part of each of the different new nations heritage, but short of major reform no one likes changing the name of their country. Oh well, i geuss ill just have to memorize whos who and hope there isnt another war anytime soon to screw it up again .....#17samwiseSep 29, 2003 15:35:45 The change I'd REALLY like to see?\n\n1. For the writers to play the game. You know, D&D. The system we are supposed to be playing when using the setting. Using the same system as we are would really help.\n\n2. For the writers to play the SAME game. You know, 3.5. Not 3E. Not 3.5 plus a bunch of option books still in playtest. Not the preliminary version of D&D 4. But 3.5. Using the same version of the same system would help even more.\n\n3. Fort the writers to play the setting. You know, Greyhawk. It doesn't matter all that much if it is LG, FtA GH, FutureHawk, CthuluHawk, or any other sort of Greyhawk. But have an active campaign set in the world.\n\nIf they could put those together first it would be a really significant advance for all products that might be written for the setting.#18grodogSep 30, 2003 21:52:44 Some of us manage to still game, Sam, though I'm certainly not the most prolific LG writer on the planet :D#19chatdemonOct 01, 2003 0:22:10\n\nOriginally posted by Samwise\n\nThe change I'd REALLY like to see?\n\n1. For the writers to play the game. You know, D&D. The system we are supposed to be playing when using the setting.

The three Uleks and two Urnsts never bothered me. Judging by the posts, I'd say that most people are able to differentiate them without difficulty.\n\nI'll agree though that when there are future Greyhawk products, the people involved in producing them should be people who know and care about the setting. If the people involved come from different sides of one of the great canon debates, then include both viewpoints as variants. I'd rather have lots of options than none at all.#21extempusFeb 14, 2006 3:39:54 Ya know, I never really thought about it before. It doesn't really make a difference to me anyway since I've never run any adventures there and don't really plan to...#22pauln6Feb 14, 2006 9:14:59 Aren't the Ulek nations actually states oweing fealty to the Kingdom of Keoland? If so does that mean that the Principality is technically superior? Although Corond (is he even alive any more?) is a Dwarven prince rather than a Keoish prince... and the Count of Ulek is an elf, so maybe their titles don't mean that much in the Keoish hierarchy?\n\nI realise that they're independent states but so was the County of Sunndi, which declared full independence from the Great Kingdom and became a kingdom following the wars. In my view, the least complicated part of it all is the names!#23lincoln_hillsFeb 14, 2006 16:15:31 If it's truly becoming a concern in your campaign, Yamo, I suggest \"common usage\" terms for the Urnst and Ulek states. The County of Ulek, for instance, could be known as \"Central Ulek\" or as \"Druidic Ulek\", either of which describe the state (in terms of geography or society) enough to make it distinct from the other two states which share its name. Similarly, using the terms North and South Urnst is simple enough that your players will no longer have trouble distinguishing which is being discussed. Alternately, refer to the state by its ruler or its capital city as often as possible.#24ripvanwormerFeb 15, 2006 1:43:49\n\nAlternately, refer to the state by its ruler or its capital city as often as possible.\n\n\"Jurnre\" is actually the archaic name for the County Ulek region. It wouldn't be hard to come up with canon-friendly alternate names.#25zombiegleemaxFeb 15, 2006 8:05:36 If you think 3 Uleks and 2 Urnsts are confusing try the Holy Roman Empire:\n\nhttp://chivalricorders.org/nobility/holyroman/hreimpas.htm\n\nOf which a sample of the states/fiefs:\n\ni Nassau-Usingen\n\nii Nassau-Weilburg\n\niii Nassau-SaarbrÃ¼cken\n\niv Solms-Branfels\n\nv Solms-Lich\n\nvi Solms-Hohen-Solms\n\nvii Solms-RÃ¶delheim\n\nviii Solms-Laubach\n\nix Isenburg-Birstein\n\nx Isenburg-BÃ¼dingen-Meerholz-WÃ¤chtersbach\n\nxi Stollberg-Gerdern-Ortenberg\n\nxii Stollberg-Stollberg\n\nxiii Stollberg-Wernigerode\n\nxiv Sayn-Wittgenstein-Berleburg\n\nxv Sayn-Wittgenstein-Wittgenstein\n\nxvi Wild- und Rheingraf zu Grumbach\n\nxvii Wild- und Rheingraf zu Rheingrafenstein\n\nxviii Leiningen-Hartenburg\n\nxix Leiningen-Heidesheim and Leningen-Guntersblum\n\nxx Westerburg Christophsche Linine\n\nxxi Westerburg Georgische Linine\n\nxxii Reussen von Plauen\n\nxxiii SchÃ¶nburg\n\nxxiv Oretenburg\n\nxxv Crichingen\n\nAnd for the full frightening complexity of it all in one pic:\n\nhttp://www.rootsweb.com/~deubadnw/history/maps/d1547.jpg\n\nIf you're having problems - stick the Darlene map up at every session and soon all that info will sink in by osmosis. If that doesn't work - get smarter players. :D\n\nP.#26zaisterFeb 15, 2006 9:59:55 There's also the Republic of Korea which is not to be confused with the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. Or the Republic of the Congo as opposed to the Democratic Republic of the Congo. History is filled with examples like these.#27bdunn91Feb 17, 2006 13:56:08\n\nDon't feel like you need to consolidate countries. The three Uleks and two Urnsts never bothered me. Judging by the posts, I'd say that most people are able to differentiate them without difficulty.\n\nBut if there were a cool story or mini-campaign that involved the political reunification of either the Uleks or Urnsts, I'd be very interested. In other words, don't reunite them to simplfy the map. But also don't avoid doing so if there's a cool adventure to be gotten out of it.#28cebrionMar 09, 2006 4:53:43 Leave your map out every time you play for a while. Eventually everyone will get to know it better. I occasionally forget the postion of the County and Duchy of Ulek in relation to each other, but the Principality to easy to remember as the southern most of the Uleks as it is contesting its land with the Pomarj(which is in the south).\n\nThe County is east of the Duchy. Its rulers have been known for their political astuteness as they have the Duchy of Urnst, Nyrond, the Duchy of Tenh, the Theocracy of the Pale, and the Bandit Kingdoms as neighbors. While not neccesarrily being powerful, the County has maintained its autonomy over time through careful political maneuvering. If you can remember that it is the County of Urnst that has to deal with its neighbors in this way, you should remember that it must be the eastern most of the two nations.#29zombiegleemaxMar 10, 2006 22:58:29\n\nThere's also the Republic of Korea which is not to be confused with the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. Or the Republic of the Congo as opposed to the Democratic Republic of the Congo. History is filled with examples like these.\n\nYeah! And why is Kansas City in Missouri? Shouldn't it be in Kansas? :D\n\n--Ghul"
