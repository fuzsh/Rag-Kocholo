        "text": "Sudden confusion (delirium) describes a state of sudden confusion and changes in a person’s behaviour and alertness. If the confusion has come on suddenly, you should take the person to your nearest hospital or call 999 for an ambulance.\n\nAbout sudden confusion (delirium)\n\nBeing in a state of confusion means:\n\nnot being able to think clearly or quickly\n\nfeeling disorientated\n\nstruggling to pay attention, make decisions, or remember things\n\nA simple test for confusion is to ask the person their name, age and today's date. This to see if they seem unsure or answer incorrectly.\n\nSymptoms of sudden confusion (delirium)\n\nThe symptoms are often worse at night, meaning that a person is awake at night and sleepy during the day.\n\nA person with a delirium can show symptoms including:\n\nconfusion\n\ndistractibility\n\nrambling speech\n\nchanges in alertness\n\nagitation (sometimes leading to aggression)\n\nbehavioural changes\n\nchanges in personality, including paranoia\n\nhallucinations\n\nWhat to do if someone is showing signs of confusion\n\nIf the confusion has come on suddenly, take the person to your nearest hospital or call 999 for an ambulance.\n\nThis is especially important if they're showing other signs of illness such as a fever, or their skin or lips are turning blue.\n\nIf the person is diabetic\n\nIf the person is diabetic, check their blood sugar level, if they have a testing device with them.\n\nYou'll need to prick their finger with the device and place the droplet of blood on the testing strip.\n\nCompare the reading with their record of previous results or recorded recommended blood sugar levels. Most people monitoring their diabetes will keep a record of blood sugars and targets.\n\nIf the reading is higher than usual, take them to hospital or call 999.\n\nIf the reading is low (below 4.0 mmol/L), give them a sugary snack or drink and wait 10 minutes to see if they recover. If they don't, take them to hospital or call 999.\n\nMore information about blood sugar and diabetes can be found at:\n\nType 1 diabetes\n\nWhile you wait for the ambulance, you should:\n\nstay with them, introduce yourself if you need to, reassure them, and remind them where they are at regular intervals\n\ncheck the person's medication cupboard, if in their home, and make a note of what drugs they're taking\n\nask if any other family members have been unwell, to check whether carbon monoxide poisoning could be a possible cause of the confusion\n\nCommon causes of sudden confusion\n\nThe most common causes of sudden confusion include:\n\na lack of oxygen in the blood (hypoxia) – the cause could be anything from a severe asthma attack to a problem with the lungs or heart\n\nan infection anywhere in the body, especially in elderly people\n\na stroke or TIA (’mini stroke’)\n\na low blood sugar level (hypoglycaemia)\n\ndiabetic ketoacidosis, a serious complication of diabetes caused by a lack of insulin in the body\n\ncertain medications, including digoxin, diuretics, steroids, and opiates\n\nalcohol poisoning or alcohol withdrawal\n\ndrug misuse\n\nThis information should give you a better idea of the cause of someone's confusion. It should not be used as a diagnostic tool. Always see your doctor for a proper diagnosis.\n\nMore unusual causes of sudden confusion\n\nLess common causes of sudden confusion include:\n\nan infection of the brain or its lining (encephalitis or meningitis)\n\nan imbalance of salts and minerals in the blood\n\na severely underactive thyroid gland\n\nthiamine (vitamin B1) deficiency\n\na brain tumour\n\nhypoparathyroidism or hyperparathyroidism (rare hormone disorders)\n\nCushing's disease (a tumour of the pituitary gland)\n\nan epileptic seizure\n\ncarbon monoxide poisoning\n\nMore useful links\n\nHow to use your health services\n\nThe information on this page has been adapted from original content from the NHS website.\n\nFor further information see terms and conditions."
