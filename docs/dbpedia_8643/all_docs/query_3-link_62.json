        "text": "In this topic\n\nBest practices for making Excel spreadsheets accessible\n\nCheck accessibility while you work in Excel\n\nCreate accessible tables\n\nUse an accessible template\n\nAdd text to cell A1\n\nAdd alt text to visuals\n\nAdd accessible hyperlink text and ScreenTips\n\nUse accessible font format and color\n\nCreate accessible charts\n\nRename worksheets\n\nDelete blank worksheets\n\nName cells and ranges\n\nTest the accessibility of your worksheets\n\nBest practices for making Excel spreadsheets accessible\n\nThe following table includes key best practices for creating Excel spreadsheets that are accessible to people with disabilities.\n\nWhat to fix\n\nHow to find it\n\nWhy fix it\n\nHow to fix it\n\nTop of Page\n\nCheck accessibility while you work in Excel\n\nThe Accessibility Checker is a tool that reviews your content and flags accessibility issues it comes across. It explains why each issue might be a potential problem for someone with a disability. The Accessibility Checker also suggests how you can resolve the issues that appear.\n\nIn Excel, the Accessibility Checker runs automatically in the background when you're creating a document. If the Accessibility Checker detects accessibility issues, you will get a reminder in the status bar.\n\nTo manually launch the Accessibility Checker, select Review > Check Accessibility. The Accessibility pane and the Accessibility ribbon open, and you can now review and fix accessibility issues. The Accessibility ribbon contains all the tools you need to create accessible spreadsheets in one place. For more info, go to Accessibility Ribbon and Improve accessibility with the Accessibility Checker.\n\nTop of Page\n\nCreate accessible tables\n\nTables can help you identify a set of data by name, and you can format the table using styles that make the data stand out. When you carefully name and format your table, you can be sure that everyone can understand your data.\n\nIt is also important to specify column header information and use a simple table structure to make sure that screen reader users can navigate the tables easily.\n\nName a table\n\nBy default, Excel names the tables you create as Table1, Table2, Table3, and so on. To make it easier to refer to a table, give each table a descriptive name. A meaningful table name like \"EmployeeList\" is more helpful than the generic \"Table1.\"\n\nWith the descriptive name, you can, for example, quickly jump to the table with the Go To command (Ctrl+G) or the Name Manager dialog box. You can also easily refer to the table in formulas.\n\nPlace the cursor anywhere in the table.\n\nOn the Table Design tab, under Table Name, replace the default name, such as 'Table1,' with a more descriptive one.\n\nNote: Table names must start with a letter, an underscore (_), or a backslash (\\) and cannot contain spaces. For more info, see section \"Important notes for names\" in Rename an Excel table.\n\nSelect an accessible table style\n\nLight colored tables with low contrast can be hard to read. To make your table more accessible, select a table style that has colors with a strong contrast. For example, choose a style that alternates between white and a dark color, such as black, dark grey, or dark blue.\n\nPlace the cursor anywhere in the table.\n\nOn the Table Design tab, in the Table Styles group, select the style you want.\n\nUse table headers\n\nScreen readers use header information to identify rows and columns. Clear table headers provide context and make navigating the table content easier.\n\nPlace the cursor anywhere in a table.\n\nOn the Table Design tab, in the Table Style Options group, select the Header Row checkbox.\n\nType the column headings.\n\nFor instructions on how to add headers to a new table, go to Create a table.\n\nTable structures to avoid\n\nDesign your tables keeping in mind the following:\n\nAvoid blank cells, columns, and rows. When navigating using the keyboard, a blank cell, column, or row might lead a screen reader user to believe there is nothing more in the table.\n\nIf there is no need for a blank cell, column, or row, consider deleting it.\n\nIf you cannot avoid a blank cell, column, or row, enter text explaining that it is blank. For example, type N/A or Intentionally Blank.\n\nAvoid splitting or merging cells: Screen readers keep track of their location in a table by counting table cells. If a table is nested within another table or if a cell is merged or split, the screen reader loses count and can’t provide helpful information about the table after that point. Merged or split cells can make navigating Excel tables with assistive technologies very difficult, if not impossible. Always keep your tables straightforward and simple. To ensure that tables don't contain split cells, merged cells, or nested tables, use the Accessibility Checker.\n\nTop of Page\n\nUse an accessible template\n\nUse one of the accessible Excel templates to make sure that your spreadsheet design, colors, contrast, and fonts are accessible for all audiences. The templates are also designed so that screen readers can more easily read the spreadsheet content.\n\nWhen selecting a template, look for a template that has several features that support accessibility. For example:\n\nUsing enough white space makes the spreadsheet easier to read.\n\nColors with contrast make them easier to tell apart for low vision and colorblind readers.\n\nLarger fonts are easier for low-vision users.\n\nPreset descriptive headings and labels make the spreadsheet easier to understand for users who navigate it with a screen reader.\n\nFor the step-by-step instructions on how to use accessible templates, go to Video: Start with an accessible Excel template.\n\nTop of Page\n\nAdd text to cell A1\n\nA screen reader starts reading any worksheet from cell A1. If you have a table on the worksheet, A1 should preferably be the title of the table.\n\nIf the sheet is long or complex, add instructions or an overview of the sheet in cell A1. This will inform people who are blind what’s being presented in your worksheet and how to use it. This instructional text can match the background color. This will hide it from people who can see, but allows it to be read by screen readers.\n\nTop of Page\n\nAdd alt text to visuals\n\nAlt text helps people who can’t see the screen to understand what’s important in visual content. Visual content includes pictures, SmartArt graphics, shapes, groups, charts, pivot charts, embedded objects, ink, and videos. In alt text, briefly describe the image and mention its intent. Screen readers read the text to describe the image to users who can’t see the image.\n\nAvoid using text in images as the sole method of conveying important information. If you must use an image with text in it, repeat that text in the document. In alt text, briefly describe the image and mention the existence of the text and its intent.\n\nTip: To write a good alt text, make sure to convey the content and the purpose of the image in a concise and unambiguous manner. The alt text shouldn’t be longer than a short sentence or two—most of the time a few thoughtfully selected words will do. Do not repeat the surrounding textual content as alt text or use phrases referring to images, such as, \"a graphic of\" or \"an image of.\" For more info on how to write alt text, go to Everything you need to know to write effective alt text.\n\nFor the step-by-step instructions on how to add alt text, go to Add alternative text to a shape, picture, chart, SmartArt graphic, or other object.\n\nTo find missing alt text, use the Accessibility Checker.\n\nNote: For audio and video content, in addition to alt text, include closed captioning for people who are deaf or hard of hearing.\n\nTop of Page\n\nUse accessible font format and color\n\nAn accessible font doesn't exclude or slow down the reading speed of anyone reading a spreadsheet, including people with low vision or reading disability or people who are blind. The right font improves the legibility and readability of the spreadsheet.\n\nFor instructions on how to change the default font, go to Change the font size.\n\nUse accessible font format\n\nHere are some ideas to consider:\n\nTo reduce the reading load, select familiar sans serif fonts such as Arial or Calibri. Avoid using all capital letters and excessive italics or underlines.\n\nA person with a vision disability might miss out on the meaning conveyed by particular colors. For example, add an underline to color-coded hyperlink text so that people who are colorblind know that the text is linked even if they can’t see the color.\n\nFor headings, consider adding bold or using a larger font.\n\nUse accessible font color\n\nThe text in your spreadsheet should be readable in a high contrast mode. For example, use bright colors or high-contrast color schemes on opposite ends of the color spectrum. White and black schemes make it easier for people who are colorblind to distinguish text and shapes.\n\nHere are some ideas to consider:\n\nTo ensure that text displays well in a high contrast mode, use the Automatic setting for font colors. For instructions on how to change the font color, go to Format text in cells.\n\nUse the Accessibility Checker to analyze the spreadsheet and find insufficient color contrast. The tool now checks the documents for text color against page color, table cell backgrounds, highlight, textbox fill color, paragraph shading, shape and SmartArt fills, headers and footers, and links.\n\nUse an accessible template.\n\nTop of Page\n\nCreate accessible charts\n\nCharts help make complex information easier to understand. To make charts accessible, use clear and descriptive language for the chart elements, such as the chart title, axis titles, and data labels. Also make sure their formatting is accessible.\n\nFor instructions on how to add chart elements to your chart and make them accessible, go to Video: Create accessible charts in Excel.\n\nFormat a chart element\n\nSelect the chart element you want to format, for example, the chart title or data labels.\n\nSelect the Format tab.\n\nUnder the Current Selection group, select Format Selection. The Format pane opens to the right.\n\nSelect the formatting options that make your chart element accessible, such as a larger font or well-contrasting colors.\n\nTop of Page\n\nRename worksheets\n\nScreen readers read worksheet names, so make sure those labels are clear and descriptive. Using unique names for worksheets makes it easier to navigate the workbook.\n\nBy default, Excel names worksheets as Sheet1, Sheet2, Sheet3, and so on, but you can easily rename them. For instructions on how to rename worksheets, go to Rename a worksheet.\n\nTop of Page\n\nDelete blank worksheets\n\nScreen readers read worksheet names, so blank worksheets might be confusing. Do not include any blank sheets in your workbooks.\n\nFor instructions on how to delete worksheets, go to Insert or delete a worksheet.\n\nTop of Page\n\nName cells and ranges\n\nName cells and ranges so that screen reader users can quickly identify the purpose of cells and ranges in Excel worksheets. Users can use the Go To command (Ctrl+G) to open up a dialog box which lists all the defined names. By selecting a name, a user can quickly jump to the named location.\n\nSelect the cell or range of cells that you want to name.\n\nSelect Formulas > Define name.\n\nEnter the name and select OK.\n\nNote: The name must start with a letter, an underscore (_), or a backslash (\\) and cannot contain spaces.\n\nTop of Page\n\nTest the accessibility of your worksheets\n\nWhen your spreadsheet is ready and you've run the Accessibility Checker to make sure it is inclusive, you can try navigating the spreadsheet using a screen reader, for example, Narrator. Narrator comes with Windows, so there's no need to install anything. This is one additional way to spot issues in the navigation, for example.\n\nStart the screen reader. For example, to start Narrator, press Ctrl+Windows logo key+Enter.\n\nPress F6 until the focus, the blue rectangle, is on the worksheet table grid.\n\nDo the following to test your worksheets:\n\nUse the arrow keys to move between the cells in the table grid.\n\nTo check the worksheet names in your spreadsheet, press F6 until the focus is on the name of the current worksheet, and then use the Left and Right arrow keys to hear the other worksheet names.\n\nIf your worksheet contains floating shapes such images, press Ctrl+Alt+5. Then, to cycle through the floating shapes, press the Tab key. To return to the normal navigation, press Esc.\n\nFix any accessibility issues you spotted when navigating with a screen reader.\n\nExit the screen reader. For example, to exit Narrator, press Ctrl+Windows logo key+Enter.\n\nNote: Also make sure that your worksheets can be easily read on a mobile phone. This not only benefits people who have low vision and use magnification, but it also benefits a very broad set of mobile phone users.\n\nTop of Page\n\nSee also\n\nRules for the Accessibility Checker\n\nEverything you need to know to write effective alt text\n\nMake your Word documents accessible to people with disabilities\n\nMake your PowerPoint presentations accessible to people with disabilities\n\nMake your Outlook email accessible to people with disabilities\n\nMake your OneNote notebooks accessible to people with disabilities\n\nExcel help & learning\n\nIn this topic\n\nBest practices for making Excel spreadsheets accessible\n\nCheck accessibility while you work in Excel\n\nCreate accessible tables\n\nUse an accessible template\n\nAdd text to cell A1\n\nAdd alt text to visuals\n\nAdd accessible hyperlink text and ScreenTips\n\nUse accessible font format and color\n\nCreate accessible charts\n\nRename worksheets\n\nDelete blank worksheets\n\nName cells and ranges\n\nTest the accessibility of your worksheets\n\nBest practices for making Excel spreadsheets accessible\n\nThe following table includes key best practices for creating Excel spreadsheets that are accessible to people with disabilities.\n\nWhat to fix\n\nHow to find it\n\nWhy fix it\n\nHow to fix it\n\nTop of Page\n\nCheck accessibility while you work in Excel\n\nThe Accessibility Checker is a tool that reviews your content and flags accessibility issues it comes across.

If you have a table on the worksheet, A1 should preferably be the title of the table.\n\nIf the sheet is long or complex, add instructions or an overview of the sheet in cell A1. This will inform people who are blind what’s being presented in your worksheet and how to use it. This instructional text can match the background color. This will hide it from people who can see, but allows it to be read by screen readers.\n\nTop of Page\n\nAdd alt text to visuals\n\nAlt text helps people who can’t see the screen to understand what’s important in visual content. Visual content includes pictures, SmartArt graphics, shapes, groups, charts, pivot charts, embedded objects, ink, and videos. In alt text, briefly describe the image and mention its intent. Screen readers read the text to describe the image to users who can’t see the image.\n\nAvoid using text in images as the sole method of conveying important information. If you must use an image with text in it, repeat that text in the document. In alt text, briefly describe the image and mention the existence of the text and its intent.\n\nTip: To write a good alt text, make sure to convey the content and the purpose of the image in a concise and unambiguous manner. The alt text shouldn’t be longer than a short sentence or two—most of the time a few thoughtfully selected words will do. Do not repeat the surrounding textual content as alt text or use phrases referring to images, such as, \"a graphic of\" or \"an image of.\" For more info on how to write alt text, go to Everything you need to know to write effective alt text.\n\nFor the step-by-step instructions on how to add alt text, go to Add alternative text to a shape, picture, chart, SmartArt graphic, or other object.\n\nTo find missing alt text, use the Accessibility Checker.\n\nNote: For audio and video content, in addition to alt text, include closed captioning for people who are deaf or hard of hearing.\n\nTop of Page\n\nUse accessible font format and color\n\nAn accessible font doesn't exclude or slow down the reading speed of anyone reading a spreadsheet, including people with low vision or reading disability or people who are blind. The right font improves the legibility and readability of the spreadsheet.\n\nFor instructions on how to change the default font, go to Change the default font in Excel for Mac.\n\nUse accessible font format\n\nHere are some ideas to consider:\n\nTo reduce the reading load, select familiar sans serif fonts such as Arial or Calibri. Avoid using all capital letters and excessive italics or underlines.\n\nA person with a vision disability might miss out on the meaning conveyed by particular colors. For example, add an underline to color-coded hyperlink text so that people who are colorblind know that the text is linked even if they can’t see the color.\n\nFor headings, consider adding bold or using a larger font.\n\nUse accessible font color\n\nThe text in your spreadsheet should be readable in a high contrast mode. For example, use bright colors or high-contrast color schemes on opposite ends of the color spectrum. White and black schemes make it easier for people who are colorblind to distinguish text and shapes.\n\nHere are some ideas to consider:\n\nTo ensure that text displays well in a high contrast mode, use the Automatic setting for font colors. For instructions on how to change the font color, go to Format text in cells.\n\nUse the Accessibility Checker to analyze the spreadsheet and find insufficient color contrast. The tool now checks the documents for text color against page color, table cell backgrounds, highlight, textbox fill color, paragraph shading, shape and SmartArt fills, headers and footers, and links.\n\nUse an accessible template.\n\nTop of Page\n\nCreate accessible charts\n\nCharts help make complex information easier to understand. To make charts accessible, use clear and descriptive language for the chart elements, such as the chart title, axis titles, and data labels. Also make sure their formatting is accessible.\n\nFor instructions on how to add chart elements to your chart and make them accessible, go to Create a chart in Excel for Mac and Video: Create accessible charts in Excel.\n\nFormat a chart element\n\nSelect the chart element you want to format, for example, the chart title or data labels.\n\nSelect the Format tab.\n\nSelect Format Pane. The pane opens to the right.\n\nSelect the formatting options that make your chart element accessible, such as well-contrasting colors.\n\nTop of Page\n\nRename worksheets\n\nScreen readers read worksheet names, so make sure those labels are clear and descriptive. Using unique names for worksheets makes it easier to navigate the workbook.\n\nBy default, Excel names worksheets as Sheet1, Sheet2, Sheet3, and so on, but you can easily rename them.\n\nDo one of the following:\n\nDouble-click the sheet tab, and type the new name.\n\nOn the Home tab, select Format > Rename Sheet, and type the new name.\n\nTop of Page\n\nDelete blank worksheets\n\nScreen readers read worksheet names, so blank worksheets might be confusing. Do not include any blank sheets in your workbooks.\n\nGo to the worksheet you want to delete.\n\nOn the Home tab, select Delete > Delete Sheet, and then select Delete to confirm the deletion.\n\nTop of Page\n\nName cells and ranges\n\nName cells and ranges so that screen reader users can quickly identify the purpose of cells and ranges in Excel worksheets. Users can use the Go To command (Control+G) to open up a dialog box which lists all the defined names. By selecting a name, a user can quickly jump to the named location.\n\nSelect the cell or range of cells that you want to name.\n\nSelect Formulas > Define name.\n\nEnter the name and select OK.\n\nNote: The name must start with a letter, an underscore (_), or a backslash (\\) and cannot contain spaces.\n\nTop of Page\n\nTest the accessibility of your worksheets\n\nWhen your spreadsheet is ready and you've run the Accessibility Checker to make sure it is inclusive, you can try navigating the spreadsheet using VoiceOver, the built-in macOS screen reader. This is one additional way to spot issues in the navigation, for example.\n\nTo start VoiceOver, do one of the following:\n\nPress Command+F5.\n\nOn the Apple menu, select System Preferences. Select Accessibility > VoiceOver, and then select the Enable VoiceOver checkbox.\n\nPut the focus to the worksheet table grid.\n\nDo the following to test your worksheets:\n\nUse the arrow keys to move between the cells in the table grid.\n\nTo check the worksheet names in your spreadsheet, press Option+Right or Left arrow key to go to the next or previous worksheet and to hear its name. Check also that there are no blank sheets.\n\nTo check that you have defined a descriptive and useful name for all tables and important cells in your worksheet, press Control+G and review the list in the Go To dialog box.\n\nFix any accessibility issues you spotted when navigating with a screen reader.\n\nTo exit VoiceOver, do one of the following:\n\nPress Command+F5.\n\nOn the Apple menu, select System Preferences. Select Accessibility > VoiceOver, and then clear the Enable VoiceOver checkbox.\n\nNote: Also make sure that your worksheets can be easily read on a mobile phone. This not only benefits people who have low vision and use magnification, but it also benefits a very broad set of mobile phone users.\n\nTop of Page\n\nSee also\n\nRules for the Accessibility Checker\n\nEverything you need to know to write effective alt text\n\nMake your Word documents accessible to people with disabilities\n\nMake your PowerPoint presentations accessible to people with disabilities\n\nMake your Outlook email accessible to people with disabilities\n\nMake your OneNote notebooks accessible to people with disabilities\n\nExcel help & learning\n\nIn this topic\n\nBest practices for making Excel spreadsheets accessible\n\nCreate accessible tables\n\nAdd text to cell A1\n\nAdd alt text to visuals\n\nAdd accessible hyperlink text\n\nUse accessible font format and color\n\nCreate accessible charts\n\nRename worksheets\n\nDelete blank worksheets\n\nTest the accessibility of your worksheets\n\nBest practices for making Excel spreadsheets accessible\n\nThe following table includes key best practices for creating Excel spreadsheets that are accessible to people with disabilities.\n\nWhat to fix\n\nWhy fix it\n\nHow to fix it\n\nTop of Page\n\nCreate accessible tables\n\nTables can help you identify a set of data by name, and you can format the table using styles that make the data stand out. When you carefully name and format your table, you can be sure that everyone can understand your data.\n\nIt is also important to specify column header information and use a simple table structure to make sure that screen reader users can navigate the tables easily.\n\nName a table\n\nBy default, Excel names the tables you create as Table1, Table2, Table3, and so on. To make it easier to refer to a table, give each table a descriptive name. A meaningful table name like \"EmployeeList\" is more helpful than the generic \"Table1.\"\n\nWith the descriptive name, you can, for example, easily refer to the table in formulas. When table names are used, you can also quickly jump to the table with the Go To command in the Excel desktop app.\n\nPlace the cursor anywhere in the table.\n\nIn the toolbar at the bottom of the screen, select (Cards View).\n\nAt the upper-right corner, select (Table settings).\n\nTap the default table name, and replace it with a descriptive name.\n\nNote: Table names must start with a letter, an underscore (_), or a backslash (\\) and cannot contain spaces. For more info, see section \"Important notes for names\" in Rename an Excel table.\n\nSelect an accessible table style\n\nLight colored tables with low contrast can be hard to read. To make your table more accessible, select a table style that has colors with a strong contrast. For example, choose a style that alternates between white and a dark color, such as black, dark grey, or dark blue.\n\nPlace the cursor anywhere in the table.\n\nIn the toolbar at the bottom of the screen, select (Show ribbon).\n\nOpen the tab menu and select the Table tab.\n\nSelect Table Styles, and then select the style you want.\n\nUse table headers\n\nScreen readers use header information to identify rows and columns. Clear table headers provide context and make navigating the table content easier.\n\nAdd headers to an existing table\n\nPlace the cursor anywhere in a table.\n\nIn the toolbar at the bottom of the screen, select (Show ribbon).\n\nOpen the tab menu and select the Table tab.\n\nSelect Style Options, and then select Header Row.\n\nType the column headings.\n\nAdd headers to a new table\n\nSelect the cells you want to include in the table.\n\nIn the toolbar at the bottom of the screen, select (Show ribbon).\n\nOpen the tab menu and select the Insert tab.\n\nSelect Table.\n\nTurn on the Table has headers switch.\n\nTable structures to avoid\n\nDesign your tables keeping in mind the following:\n\nAvoid blank cells, columns, and rows. When navigating using the keyboard, a blank cell, column, or row might lead a screen reader user to believe there is nothing more in the table.\n\nIf there is no need for a blank cell, column, or row, consider deleting it.\n\nIf you cannot avoid a blank cell, column, or row, enter text explaining that it is blank. For example, type N/A or Intentionally Blank.\n\nAvoid splitting or merging cells: Screen readers keep track of their location in a table by counting table cells. If a table is nested within another table or if a cell is merged or split, the screen reader loses count and can’t provide helpful information about the table after that point. Merged or split cells can make navigating Excel tables with assistive technologies very difficult, if not impossible. Always keep your tables straightforward and simple.\n\nTop of Page\n\nAdd text to cell A1\n\nA screen reader starts reading any worksheet from cell A1.

This will hide it from people who can see, but allows it to be read by screen readers.\n\nTop of Page\n\nAdd alt text to visuals\n\nAlt text helps people who can’t see the screen to understand what’s important in visual content. Visual content includes pictures, shapes, charts, pivot charts, ink, and videos. In alt text, briefly describe the image and mention its intent. Screen readers read the text to describe the image to users who can’t see the image.\n\nAvoid using text in images as the sole method of conveying important information. If you must use an image with text in it, repeat that text in the document. In alt text, briefly describe the image and mention the existence of the text and its intent.\n\nTip: To write a good alt text, make sure to convey the content and the purpose of the image in a concise and unambiguous manner. The alt text shouldn’t be longer than a short sentence or two—most of the time a few thoughtfully selected words will do. Do not repeat the surrounding textual content as alt text or use phrases referring to images, such as, \"a graphic of\" or \"an image of.\" For more info on how to write alt text, go to Everything you need to know to write effective alt text.\n\nTo find missing alt text, use the Accessibility Checker.\n\nNote: For audio and video content, in addition to alt text, include closed captioning for people who are deaf or hard of hearing.\n\nRight-click the visual, and then select Alt Text to open the Alternative Text dialog box.\n\nIn the Description text box, type 1-2 sentences to describe the visual and its context to someone who cannot see it.\n\nNote: We recommend only putting text in the description field and leaving the title blank. This will provide the best experience with most major screen readers including Narrator.\n\nTip: To spell check and correct a word you typed, right-click the word and select from the suggested alternatives.\n\nSelect OK.\n\nTop of Page\n\nUse accessible font format and color\n\nAn accessible font doesn't exclude or slow down the reading speed of anyone reading a spreadsheet, including people with low vision or reading disability or people who are blind. The right font improves the legibility and readability of the spreadsheet.\n\nUse accessible font format\n\nHere are some ideas to consider:\n\nTo reduce the reading load, select familiar sans serif fonts such as Arial or Calibri. Avoid using all capital letters and excessive italics or underlines.\n\nA person with a vision disability might miss out on the meaning conveyed by particular colors. For example, add an underline to color-coded hyperlink text so that people who are colorblind know that the text is linked even if they can’t see the color.\n\nFor headings, consider adding bold or using a larger font.\n\nFor the step-by-step instructions on how to change the font style and size, go to Change the font style and size for a worksheet.\n\nUse accessible font color\n\nThe text in your spreadsheet should be readable in a high contrast mode. For example, use bright colors or high-contrast color schemes on opposite ends of the color spectrum. White and black schemes make it easier for people who are colorblind to distinguish text and shapes.\n\nHere are some ideas to consider:\n\nTo ensure that text displays well in a high contrast mode, use the Automatic setting for font colors. For the step-by-step instructions on how to change the font color, go to Format text in cells.\n\nUse the Accessibility Checker to analyze the spreadsheet and find insufficient color contrast. The tool now checks the documents for text color against page color, table cell backgrounds, highlight, textbox fill color, paragraph shading, shape and SmartArt fills, headers and footers, and links.\n\nUse an accessible template.\n\nTop of Page\n\nCreate accessible charts\n\nCharts help make complex information easier to understand. To make charts accessible, use clear and descriptive language for the chart elements, such as the chart title, axis titles, and data labels. Also make sure their formatting is accessible.\n\nFor the step-by-step instructions on how to add chart elements to your chart and make them accessible, go to Add or remove titles in a chart and Video: Create accessible charts in Excel.\n\nFormat a chart element\n\nSelect the chart element you want to format, for example, the chart title or data labels.\n\nOn the Chart tab, select Format. The Chart pane opens to the right, with the options available for the selected chart element.\n\nSelect the formatting options that make your chart element accessible, such as a larger font or well-contrasting colors.\n\nTop of Page\n\nRename worksheets\n\nScreen readers read worksheet names, so make sure those labels are clear and descriptive. Using unique names for worksheets makes it easier to navigate the workbook.\n\nBy default, Excel names worksheets as Sheet1, Sheet2, Sheet3, and so on, but you can easily rename them. For the step-by-step instructions on how to rename worksheets, go to Rename a worksheet.\n\nTop of Page\n\nDelete blank worksheets\n\nScreen readers read worksheet names, so blank worksheets might be confusing. Do not include any blank sheets in your workbooks.\n\nFor the step-by-step instructions on how to delete worksheets, go to Insert or delete a worksheet.\n\nTop of Page\n\nTest the accessibility of your worksheets\n\nWhen your spreadsheet is ready and you've run the Accessibility Checker to make sure it is inclusive, you can try navigating the spreadsheet using a screen reader, for example, Narrator. Narrator comes with Windows, so there's no need to install anything. This is one additional way to spot issues in the navigation, for example.\n\nStart the screen reader. For example, to start Narrator, press Ctrl+Windows logo key+Enter.\n\nDo the following to test your worksheets:\n\nPress Ctrl+F6 until the focus, the blue rectangle, is on the worksheet table grid. Use the arrow keys to move between the cells in the table grid.\n\nIf your worksheet contains floating shapes such images, press Ctrl+F6 until the focus is on the worksheet table grid, and then press Ctrl+F6 one more time. You hear \"Grid,\" and the focus is on one of the floating shapes. Then, to cycle through the floating shapes, press the Tab key or Shift+Tab. To return to the normal navigation, press Esc.\n\nTo check the worksheet names in your spreadsheet, press Ctrl+F6 until the focus is on the name of the current worksheet, and then use the Tab key and Shift+Tab to hear the other worksheet names.\n\nFix any accessibility issues you spotted when navigating with a screen reader.\n\nExit the screen reader. For example, to exit Narrator, press Ctrl+Windows logo key+Enter.\n\nNote: Also make sure that your worksheets can be easily read on a mobile phone. This not only benefits people who have low vision and use magnification, but it also benefits a very broad set of mobile phone users.\n\nTop of Page\n\nSee also\n\nRules for the Accessibility Checker\n\nEverything you need to know to write effective alt text\n\nMake your Word documents accessible to people with disabilities\n\nMake your PowerPoint presentations accessible to people with disabilities\n\nMake your Outlook email accessible to people with disabilities\n\nMake your OneNote notebooks accessible to people with disabilities\n\nExcel help & learning"
