        "text": "German-Austrian family\n\nFor the German noble family, see Sayn-Wittgenstein.\n\nThe Wittgenstein family is a German-Austrian family that rose to prominence in 19th- and 20th-century Vienna, Austria. The family was originally Jewish and originated from the Wittgensteiner Land [de] in Siegen-Wittgenstein, Germany.\n\nThe Austrian branch of the Wittgenstein family began with the emigration of Hermann Christian Wittgenstein [de] to Vienna in 1851. By 1910, 26 members of the Wittgenstein family were among the 929 wealthiest people in Vienna.[1]\n\nMembers of the Wittgenstein family include successful merchants, entrepreneurs, industrialists, lawyers, musicians, patrons of the arts, and philosophers:\n\nKarl Wittgenstein (1847–1913), steel magnate\n\nMargaret Stonborough-Wittgenstein (1882–1958), philanthropist\n\nPaul Wittgenstein (1887–1961), concert pianist\n\nLudwig Wittgenstein (1889–1951), philosopher\n\nThe earliest known family members are the estate manager Ahron Moses Meier (died 1804) and his wife Sarah. They lived in Laasphe in the Wittgensteiner Land [de] and worked for the Counts of Sayn-Wittgenstein-Hohenstein.\n\nTheir son, Moses Meyer, was initially the estate manager of the Counts. In 1806, after the Reichsdeputationshauptschluss, the Wittgensteiner Land fell to Hessen-Darmstadt. In 1808, Napoleon initiated the Jewish emancipation and Jews were required to adopt a fixed surname within three months. Moses chose the name Meyer-Wittgenstein. This led to a conflict with the Prussian Wilhelm zu Sayn-Wittgenstein-Hohenstein [de], who had been elevated to Reichsfürst in 1804. Moses left the Wittgensteiner Land with his family and moved to the nearby Principality of Waldeck. It was there that he created a successful business as a wool trader in the former Hanseatic City Korbach, an area with many sheep.\n\nMoses Meyer-Wittgenstein (born 1761 in Laasphe; died 3 January 1822 in Korbach), married Bernhardine (Breindel) Simon (1768–1829)\n\nSimson Moses Wittgenstein (8 December 1788 – 22 March 1853), married on 4 October 1813 in Rheda to Rebecca Rosenberg (born 2 May 1783; died 15 April 1854 in Korbach)\n\nFriedrike Wittgenstein (born c. 1820), married on 6 August 1850 to Isaac Koppel (born c. 1815)\n\nMarcus Wittgenstein (born c. 1818 in Korbach; died 1828 in Korbach)\n\nJakob Wittgenstein [de] (born 1 April 1819 in Korbach; died 3 June 1890 in Berlin by suicide), married Clara Lippert (divorced on 22 May 1871 from the Stadtgericht Berlin), estate manager in Berlin from 1858, founder of \"Simson and Rebecca Wittgenstein Stiftung\" (1884) and the \"Jacob Wittgenstein`sche Altersversorgungsanstalt\" (1894)[2]\n\nJulia Wittgenstein (born 1790 in Korbach), married Rosenberg\n\nRichard Simon Wittgenstein (born 1796; died 13 February 1862), married Ida (born 1809 in Bielefeld; died 3 July 1880 in Geibsdorf)\n\nLouise Johanne Henriette Wittgenstein (born 1831), married Heinrich Hirsch (born 5 May 1840)\n\nEmma Flora Caroline Wittgenstein (1833–1879)\n\nMax Adolf Georg Carl Wittgenstein (born 1836)\n\nErnst Oscar Wittgenstein (born 1844), married Emma Vaerst\n\nHermann Christian Wittgenstein [de] (born 15 September 1802 in Korbach; died 19 May 1878 in Vienna-Hietzing), wool trader in Gohlis and estate manager in Vienna, converted to Protestantism in 1839, married Franziska (Fanny) Figdor (born 7 April 1814 in Kittsee; died 21 October 1890 in Vienna-Hietzing)\n\nAnna Friederike Wittgenstein (born 31 October 1840 in Gohlis; died 22 September 1896 in Hietzing), married Heinrich \"Emil\" Franz (born 9 December 1839 in Vienna; died 24 March 1884 in Vienna)\n\nMarie Wittgenstein (1841–1931), married Moritz Christian Pott (1839–1902; iron merchant)\n\nPaul Josef Gustav Wittgenstein (1842–1928), jurist, married Justine Karoline Hochstetter (1858–1918)\n\nJohanna Salzer (née Wittgenstein) (1877–1953)\n\nHermann Christian Wittgenstein (1879–1953)\n\nPaul Karl Wittgenstein (1880–1948)\n\nPaul Wittgenstein [de] (1907–1979), philosopher\n\nJosephine Wittgenstein (1844–1933), married Johann Nepomuk Oser [de] (1833–1912)\n\nLudwig \"Louis\" Wittgenstein (1845–1925), owner of Schloss Hollenburg, married Maria Franz (1850–1912)\n\nKarl Otto Clemens Wittgenstein (born 1847 in Vienna; died 1913)\n\nHermine Wittgenstein (born 1874 in Teplitz; died 1950)\n\nDora Wittgenstein (born 1876 in Vienna; died at birth)\n\nHans Wittgenstein (born 1877 in Vienna; died 1902 in the Chesapeake Bay, presumed suicide by drowning)\n\nKurt Wittgenstein (born 1878 in Vienna; died November 1918, shot himself on the Italian front)\n\nHelene Wittgenstein (born 1879 in Vienna; died 1956) married Max Salzer (ministry official)\n\nRudolf Wittgenstein (born 1881 in Vienna; died 1904 in Berlin by suicide) chemistry student\n\nMargaret Stonborough-Wittgenstein (1882–1958), married Jerome Stonborough in 1904.
