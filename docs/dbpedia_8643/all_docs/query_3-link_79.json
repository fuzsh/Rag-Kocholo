        "text": "Verbal communication\n\nThe words you, or your staff, use are important. Poor verbal communication can damage your business and leave customers or stakeholders unhappy or confused.\n\nUsing questions in conversation\n\nGenerally, you will have the most success when using a range of question types in a conversation. Using open and closed questions together, can help you guide a conversation and encourage the other party to contribute.\n\nUsing only open questions can result in digression—a conversation straying off course.\n\nUsing only closed questions can make it too easy for the answering party to say just yes or no. Because they only encourage a basic response, closed questions are not good rapport builders or conversation starters. Use both types of questions for maximum success and engagement.\n\nQuestion styles to avoid\n\nSome types of question do not lend themselves to working towards positive outcomes.\n\nThese include:\n\ndestructive questions—\"So you're saying it's my fault?\"\n\nleading or manipulative questions—\"You'll have that done by tomorrow, right?\"\n\nmultiple questions at once—\"When will you want it? Or don't you want it? You can't get it anywhere else, can you?\"\n\nThese kinds of question can hamper your ability to negotiate efficiently and effectively.\n\nListening effectively\n\nIt's one thing to ask good questions—it's another to take on board the answers.\n\nYou can often be distracted by your own thoughts, your next move or what you should say next, or trying to second guess where the other party might be leading you.\n\nTo listen effectively you need to suspend these internal thoughts and give your full attention to the speaker. Only then can you really hear what they're saying.\n\nConsider these suggestions.\n\nNon-verbal communication\n\nMuch of the way we communicate in a visual situation—face to face, in person or via video—occurs through non-verbal cues.\n\nThis includes your body language, the way you look at others during conversations and the facial expressions you use.\n\nMeeting new people and introducing yourself\n\nYour first impression can be the difference between starting a successful business relationship or finishing with a one-off meeting.\n\nIt is very easy to create a negative first impression with someone, often without knowing you've done so. It's much harder to make a positive impression and it's worth putting some effort into your introductions.\n\nPhone communications\n\nA great deal of business communications is completed via phone. The phone works well as it is a personable approach for both parties and can often enhance the working relationship.\n\nPhone communication requires active listening skills and asking the right type of questions to ensure you have heard and understood the message your counterpart wants to share.\n\nEven if you are busy, it is important to allow time for the other person to speak without interrupting them.\n\nLeaving a message\n\nIf you attempt to phone someone and they don't answer, be prepared to leave a short succinct message with your:\n\nname\n\nbusiness or company name\n\nreason for the phone call\n\nyour phone number.\n\nA short friendly text message with the above information is also a good option.\n\nSending a succinct text message encourages the other party to either respond with the answers you need via text or by return call at a time convenient for them.\n\nVideo calls—Zoom, Teams, FaceTime, webinars\n\nSince the pandemic, business has embraced video calls using Zoom, Teams, FaceTime or similar software.\n\nVideo calling has created significant efficiencies and cost savings for business, resulting in people prioritising this medium in place of face to face meetings, phone calls, and time-consuming travel.\n\nAnother benefit of video calling is that you can reach a greater number of people at the same time.\n\nThe biggest challenges for video calling are lack of data connectivity and bandwidth issues which can cause delays, a lag in audio, and poor video quality.\n\nWritten communication for business\n\nBusiness communication often involves emails, documents, letters and reports.\n\nMany verbal communication skills can also be applied to written communication, such as asking the right questions and using the right tone.\n\nBe polite and clear in what you're asking or saying to another party, particularly if your written communication requires follow-up action.\n\nWritten communication done well usually results in less messages between parties.\n\nConsider how the other party may receive and potentially misinterpret your message. Keep written communication friendly and factual, and use an appropriate tone.\n\nAlways review your writing and correct any spelling or grammar mistakes. Automated spelling and grammar checkers can be turned on in most software.\n\nHow written communication can be received and misinterpreted\n\nWhen sending written communications for business, you often are not aware of the emotions, schedule and environment of the person receiving your communications.\n\nWhen communicating effectively for business, it is recommended that you write deliberately, use empathy where appropriate, and keep a clear view of how written communication can be received and misinterpreted.\n\nAlso consider..."
