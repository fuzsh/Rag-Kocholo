This allows you to control the flow of material from the time you receive items to the time you ship finished goods to the customer. You can:\n\nProcess miscellaneous issues and receipts. See: Performing Miscellaneous Transactions.\n\nTransfer material between subinventories. See: Transferring Between Subinventories.\n\nMove material from a shipping organization to a destination organization and move material to intransit inventory before it reaches its final destination. See: Transferring between Organizations.\n\nTrack lots and serial numbers for an item. See: Assigning Lot Numbers and Assigning Serial Numbers.\n\nGenerate shortage alerts and shortage notifications. See: Material Shortage Alerts and Shortage Notifications.\n\nEnter and maintain movement statistics information. See: Entering Movement Statistics\n\nView material transactions. See: Viewing Material Transactions.\n\nView material transaction accounting distributions. See: Viewing Material Transaction Distributions, Oracle Cost Management User's Guide.\n\nView summarized transactions for a range of dates. See: Viewing Transaction Summaries.\n\nView pending transactions. See: Viewing Pending Transactions.\n\nView pending transaction interface activity. See: Viewing and Updating Transaction Open Interface Activity.\n\nPurge transaction history. See: Purging Transaction History.\n\nView serial genealogy. See: Viewing Serial Genealogy.\n\nImportant: Inventory transactions and on hand balance supports decimal precision to 5 digits after the decimal point. Oracle Work in Process supports decimal precision to 6 digits. Other Oracle Applications support different decimal precision. As a result of the decimal precision mismatch, transactions another Oracle Application passes may be rounded when processed by Inventory. If the transaction quantity is rounded to zero, Inventory does not process the transaction. It is therefore suggested that the base unit of measure for an item is set up such that transaction quantities in the base unit of measure not require greater than 5 digits of decimal precision.\n\nRelated Topics\n\nOverview of Transaction Setup\n\nReceiving Transactions\n\nYou must perform the following setup steps before you can perform receiving transactions:\n\nDefine purchasing options for your organization, such as approval or control options, in the Purchasing Options window.\n\nDefine options that govern receipts in the Receiving Options window.\n\nYou can receive all or a partial list of open lines on any purchase order by using the Receipts window. You can also receive substitute items and goods or services you have not ordered. Oracle Inventory allows you to match goods you receive on the receiving dock to a purchase order they might be fulfilling. You can then record transfers and deliveries in the Receiving Transactions window, record inspections in the Inspections window, record Returns in the Returns window, and record adjustments and corrections in the Corrections window.\n\nTransferring Between Subinventories\n\nYou can transfer material within your current organization between subinventories, or between two locators within the same subinventory. You can transfer from asset to expense subinventories, as well as from tracked to non-tracked subinventories. If an item has a restricted list of subinventories, you can only transfer material from and to subinventories in that list. Oracle Inventory allows you to use user-defined transaction types when performing a subinventory transfer.\n\nTo enter a subinventory transfer\n\nNavigate to the Subinventory Transfer window.\n\nEnter the date and time of entry for the transaction.\n\nThe date you can enter is controlled by the INV:Transaction Date Validation profile option. See: Oracle Inventory Profile Options.\n\nEnter a transaction type for the subinventory transfer. This can either be a predefined system type or one you defined. See: Defining Transaction Types.\n\nOptionally, enter the source of the transaction type. See: Defining and Updating Transaction Source Types.\n\nOptionally, indicate if inventory information should be defaulted from the serial number.\n\nTo enter the item to transfer\n\nChoose Transaction Lines in the Subinventory Transfer window. The Transaction Lines Detail folder window appears.\n\nEnter an inventory item to transfer. If you choose to default inventory information from the serial number, enter a serial number.\n\nOptionally, enter the revision for the item. You must enter a value here if the item is under revision control.\n\nEnter the subinventories from and to which to transfer material. Enter the same subinventory in the Sub and To Sub fields to transfer material between locators.\n\nOptionally, enter the locators from and to which to transfer the item. You must enter a value here if you established locator control.\n\nYou can enter a new value in the To Locator field only if you defined locator control as dynamic entry.\n\nOptionally, enter a lot number for the item. If you want to enter multiple lot numbers, complete the remaining steps, then choose the Lot/Serial button to display the Lot Entry window.\n\nEnter a unit of measure. This can be the primary unit of measure (the default) or any valid alternate unit of measure.\n\nIf you enter an alternate unit of measure, Oracle Inventory issues the quantity you specify in this unit of measure. Oracle Inventory also converts the quantity to the primary unit of measure so that it can correctly update the on-hand quantity.\n\nEnter the quantity of the inventory item to transfer, based on the unit of measure you specified. If the item is under dual unit of measure control, the secondary unit of measure and the secondary quantity populate automatically in the Secondary UOM and Secondary Quantity fields\n\nOptionally, enter a reason code for the transaction. For example, you can use reason codes to allow you to mark exceptional charges to support a quality data collection and reporting system. See: Defining Transaction Reasons.\n\nOptionally, enter up to 240 characters of free text that describes the transaction.\n\nTo enter lot or serial number information.\n\nClick the Lot/Serial button. See: Assigning Lot Numbers and Assigning Serial Numbers.\n\nTo view quantity available and quantity on hand values\n\nReview the following fields:\n\nAvailable: Displays the quantity available to transfer, based on the unit of measure you specified. The available quantity is the quantity on hand less all reservations for the item. This amount could include the amount you have reserved if you enter a transaction source that has reservations against it. The available quantity includes reservations against current transaction source. The available quantity is specific to the revision level, lot number, From subinventory, and From locator you specify for the transfer.\n\nSecondary Available: Displays the quantity available to transfer in the secondary unit of measure if the item is under dual unit of measure control.\n\nOn hand: Displays the current on-hand quantity for the item, based on the unit of measure you specified. The on-hand quantity is specific to the revision, lot number, From subinventory, and From locator you specify for the transfer. On-hand includes quantities for pending transactions in the MTL-MATERIAL-TRANSACTIONS table.\n\nSecondary On hand: Displays the current on-hand quantity of the item in the secondary unit of measure if the item is under dual unit of measure control.\n\nTo process the transaction\n\nSave your work.\n\nRelated Topics\n\nCustomizing the Presentation of Data in a Folder, Oracle Applications User's Guide\n\nPerforming Miscellaneous Transactions\n\nWith a miscellaneous transaction you can issue material to or receive material from general ledger accounts in your current organization. This allows you to issue material to groups that are not inventory, receiving, or work in process such as a research and development group or an accounting department. You can also make manual adjustments to the general ledger by receiving material from one account to inventory, and then issuing that material from inventory to another account.\n\nYou can use your user-defined transaction types and sources to further classify and name your transactions. You can use this feature to issue items to individuals, departments, or projects; or to issue damaged items to expense accounts such as scrap. You can perform the receipts for items that were acquired by means other than a purchase order from a supplier. You can also use this feature to load all item on-hand quantities when you start implementing Oracle Inventory.\n\nYou will receive a material shortage alert while performing a miscellaneous transaction if you have enabled shortage alerts for the miscellaneous transaction type being performed. Also, a miscellaneous transaction can trigger a shortage notification to be sent to various pre-defined individuals. See: Material Shortage Alerts and Shortage Notifications.\n\nTo enter a miscellaneous transaction\n\nNavigate to the Miscellaneous Transaction window.\n\nEnter the date and time of entry for the transaction.\n\nThe date you can enter is controlled by the INV:Transaction Date Validation profile option. See: Oracle Inventory Profile Options.\n\nEnter a miscellaneous transaction type for the transfer. This can either be a predefined system type or one you defined. See: Defining Transaction Types.\n\nOptionally, enter the source of the transaction type. See: Defining and Updating Transaction Source Types.\n\nOptionally, enter the general ledger account against which the material is issued or received.\n\nOptionally, indicate if inventory information should be defaulted from the serial number.\n\nTo enter the item to transfer\n\nChoose Transaction Lines in the Miscellaneous Transaction window. The Transaction Lines Detail folder window appears.\n\nEnter an inventory item to issue or receive. If you choose to default inventory information from the serial number, enter a serial number.\n\nEnter the revision for the item to issue or receive. You must enter a value in this field if the item is under revision control.\n\nEnter a subinventory. For an issue transaction, you cannot enter a subinventory that does not have Quantity Tracking turned on.\n\nEnter a locator. You must enter a value here if you established locator control for the item.\n\nOptionally, enter a lot number for the item. If you want to enter multiple lot numbers, complete the remaining steps, then choose the Lot/Serial button to display the Lot Entry window.\n\nOptionally enter a transfer location for the item.\n\nNote: If you enabled the Location Required parameter for this transaction type on the Transaction Types window, this field is mandatory.\n\nEnter a unit of measure. This can be the primary unit of measure (the default) or any valid alternate unit of measure.\n\nIf you enter an alternate unit of measure, Oracle Inventory issues the quantity you specify in this unit of measure. Oracle Inventory also converts the quantity to the primary unit of measure so that it can correctly update the on-hand quantity.\n\nEnter the quantity of the inventory item to issue or receive, based on the unit of measure you specified. If the item is under dual unit of measure control, the secondary unit of measure and the secondary quantity populate automatically in the Secondary UOM and Secondary Quantity fields.\n\nIf using average costing, enter the unit cost of the item to receive or issue. Leave this field blank to use the system average cost at the time of the transaction.\n\nOptionally, enter a reason code for the transaction. For example, you can use reason codes to allow you to mark exceptional charges to support quality data collection.\n\nOptionally, enter up to 240 characters of free text that describe the transaction.\n\nEnter a general ledger account for the item to use in the transaction. You can change this account only for miscellaneous issue/receipt or user-defined transaction types.\n\nOptionally, enter the owning party if the owner controls the item.\n\nOptionally, enter the planning party if a vendor has planning authority for the item.\n\nNote: You can view fields that do not appear on the default miscellaneous transaction window. You can also hide unused fields. See Customizing the Presentation of the Data in a Folder, Oracle Applications User's Guide .\n\nTo enter lot or serial number information.\n\nChoose the Lot/Serial button. See: Assigning Lot Numbers and Assigning Serial Numbers.\n\nTo view quantity available and quantity on hand values\n\nReview the following fields:\n\nAvailable: Displays the quantity available to transfer, based on the unit of measure you specified. The available quantity is the quantity on hand less all reservations for the item. This amount could include the amount you have reserved if you enter a transaction source that has reservations against it. The available quantity includes reservations against current transaction source. The available quantity is specific to the revision level, lot number, From subinventory, and From locator you specify for the transfer.\n\nSecondary Available: Displays the quantity available to transfer in the secondary unit of measure if the item is under dual unit of measure control.\n\nOn hand: Displays the current on-hand quantity for the item, based on the unit of measure you specified. The on-hand quantity is specific to the revision, lot number, From subinventory, and From locator you specify for the transfer. On-hand includes quantities for pending transactions in the MTL-MATERIAL-TRANSACTIONS table.\n\nSecondary On hand: Displays the current on-hand quantity of the item in the secondary unit of measure if the item is under dual unit of measure control.\n\nTo process the transaction\n\nSave your work.\n\nRelated Topics\n\nCustomizing the Presentation of Data in a Folder, Oracle Applications User's Guide\n\nInter-organization Transfers\n\nYou can define multiple inventories, warehouses, and manufacturing facilities as distinct organizations. With Oracle Inventory you can perform inter-organization transfers as direct or intransit shipments.\n\nYou can transfer one or more items in a single transaction. You can also transfer partial quantities of the same item to different subinventories and locators in a single transaction. The items you transfer must exist in both organizations. You can also transfer expense and asset items from one organization to another using intransit inventory.\n\nDirect Inter-organization Transfers\n\nYou can use a direct inter-organization transfer to move inventory directly from a shipping organization to a destination organization.\n\nThe validity of a transfer transaction depends on the controls you have defined in both the shipping and destination organizations for the items you want to transfer. For example, you can transfer item A from organization X to organization Y, even though item A is under lot control only in organization X (you can specify the lot numbers for item A in organization X during the transfer transaction). However, you cannot transfer item B from organization X to organization Y if item B is under lot control only in organization Y (you cannot specify lot numbers for item B in the destination organization because you are performing a direct transfer).\n\nThe following tables present direct, inter-organization transfers.\n\nDual Unit of Measure Control\n\nShipped Item Destination Item Allowed None None OK None Fixed OK None Default OK None No Default OK*** Fixed None OK Fixed Fixed OK Fixed Default OK Fixed No Default OK*** Default None OK Default Fixed OK Default Default OK Default No Default OK*** No Default None OK No Default Fixed OK No Default Default OK No Default No Default OK***\n\n*** Apply default UOM conversion from destination organization.\n\nRevision Control\n\nREVISION CONTROL Off (Shipping Organization) On (Shipping Organization) Off (Destination Organization) OK OK On (Destination Organization) - OK\n\nLot Control\n\nLOT CONTROL Off (Shipping Organization) On (Shipping Organization) Off (Destination Organization) OK OK On (Destination Organization) - OK\n\nGrade Control\n\nGrade Control Off (Shipping Organization) On (Shipping Organization) Off (Destination Organization) OK** OK On (Destination Organization) OK OK*\n\n* The Shipped lot grade does not override the destination lot grade\n\n** Grade Defaults from item master\n\nProcess Manufacturing Lot Attributes\n\nOPM Lot Attributes Not Used (Shipping Organization) Used (Shipping Organization Not Used (Destination Organization OK OK Used (Destination Organization) OK** OK*\n\n* The Shipped lot grade does not override the destination lot grade\n\n**Lot attributes default from the item master for new lots.\n\nSerial Number Control\n\nSERIAL NUMBER CONTROL Off (Shipping Organization) On (Shipping Organization) Off (Destination Organization) OK OK On (Destination Organization) - OK\n\nAsset Expense Subinventory\n\nDestination Org Shipping Org Expense sub and/or Expense item Asset sub and Asset item Expense sub and/or Expense item OK - Asset sub and Asset item OK OK\n\nUnit of Measure Conversions\n\nWhen you transfer items under dual UOM control between organization, the system honors the UOM conversion of the destination organization. Consequently, the system could potentially recalculate the secondary quantity for the item if the conversions differ between the shipping organization and the destination organization. The system always processes transaction quantities in the primary UOM.\n\nYou must apply UOM conversions in both the shipping and destination organization before the system can process the transaction.\n\nInter-Organization Transfers via Intransit Inventory\n\nYou usually transfer material to intransit inventory when transportation time is significant. When you perform the transfer transaction, you do not need to specify the delivery location. You only need to enter the subinventory you are shipping from, a shipment number, the freight information, and, depending on the inter-organization transfer charge that applies between the organizations, a percentage of the transaction value or a discrete amount that Oracle Inventory uses to compute transfer charges.\n\nIf the FOB point is set to Receipt in the Shipping Networks window, the destination organization owns the shipment when they receive it. If it is set to Shipment, the destination organization owns the shipment when the shipping organization ships it, and while it is intransit.\n\nWhile your shipment is intransit, you can update shipping information such as the freight carrier or arrival date in the Maintain Shipments window. See: Managing Shipments, Oracle Purchasing User's Guide.\n\nAt the time of shipment, you must define your receiving parameters for the destination organization. You can receive and deliver your shipment in a single transaction or you can receive and store your shipment at the receiving dock. See: Receipts, Oracle Purchasing User's Guide.\n\nThe validity of a transfer transaction depends on the controls you have defined in both the shipping and destination organizations for the items you want to transfer. For example, you can transfer item A from organization X to organization Y, even though item A is under lot control only in organization X (you can specify the lot numbers for item A in organization X during the transfer transaction). You can also transfer item B from organization X to organization Y if item B is under lot control only in organization Y (you can specify lot numbers for item B in the destination organization when you perform the receiving transaction).\n\nThe following tables present inter-organization transfers via intransit inventory.\n\nDual Unit of Measure Control\n\nShipped Item Destination Item Allowed Intransit None None OK None Fixed OK None Default OK None No Default OK Fixed None OK Fixed Fixed OK Fixed Default OK Fixed No Default OK Default None OK Default Fixed OK Default Default OK Default No Default OK No Default None OK No Default Fixed OK No Default Default OK No Default No Default OK\n\nRevision Control\n\nREVISION CONTROL Off (Shipping Organization) On (Shipping Organization) Off (Destination Organization) OK OK On (Destination Organization) Receive any revision Receive only the revision you ship\n\nLot Control\n\nLOT CONTROL Off (Shipping Organization) On (Shipping Organization) Off (Destination Organization) OK OK On (Destination Organization) OK OK\n\nGrade Control\n\nGrade Control Off (Shipping Organization) On (Shipping Organization) Off (Destination Organization) OK** OK On (Destination Organization) OK OK*\n\n* The Shipped lot grade does not override the destination lot grade\n\n** Grade Defaults from item master\n\nProcess Manufacturing Lot Attributes\n\nOPM Lot Attributes Not Used (Shipping Organization) Used (Shipping Organization Not Used (Destination Organization OK OK Used (Destination Organization) OK** OK*\n\n* The Shipped lot grade does not override the destination lot grade\n\n**Lot attributes default from the item master for new lots.\n\nSerial Number Control\n\nSERIAL NUMBER CONTROL Off (Shipping Organization) On (Shipping Organization) Off (Destination Organization) OK OK On (Destination Organization) OK OK\n\nAsset Expense Subinventory Item\n\nItem Type Asset Subinventory Expense Subinventory Asset item OK - Expense Item OK OK\n\nUnit of Measure Conversions\n\nWhen you transfer items under dual UOM control between organization, the system honors the UOM conversion of the destination organization. Consequently, the system could potentially recalculate the secondary quantity for the item if the conversions differ between the shipping organization and the destination organization. The system always processes transaction quantities in the primary UOM.\n\nYou must UOM conversions in both the shipping and destination organization before the system can process the transaction.\n\nRelated Topics\n\nTransferring Between Organizations\n\nTransferring Between Organizations\n\nYou can transfer material from your current organization to another organization, or from your current organization to intransit inventory.\n\nMaterial in intransit inventory belongs to the organization identified by the FOB point. See: Defining Inter-Organization Shipping Networks.\n\nPrerequisites\n\nDefine an inventory item that is common to both organizations. See: Defining Items and Assigning Items to Organizations.\n\nDefine at least two organizations, one of which is valid to receive material from the other. See: Creating an Organization, Oracle Human Resource Management System User's Guide and Defining Organization Parameters.\n\nSet up inter-organization relationships and their corresponding accounts. See: Defining Inter-Organization Shipping Networks.\n\nFor direct transfers, if the item to transfer is under serial number control, the item must have the same unit of measure in each organization. See: Defining Items.\n\nTo enter the information to perform a transfer between organizations\n\nNavigate to the Inter-organization Transfer window.\n\nEnter the date of entry for the transaction.\n\nThe date you can enter is controlled by the INV:Transaction Date Validation profile option. See: Oracle Inventory Profile Options.\n\nEnter an organization to which to transfer the material. You must first define this organization as valid to receive material from your current organization. See: Defining Inter-Organization Shipping Networks.\n\nIn addition, if this organization uses intransit inventory, Oracle Inventory stores the material as intransit inventory when you transfer any material to this organization. You must then move the material from intransit inventory to this organization with an intransit inventory receipt.\n\nEnter a transaction type. This can be either a predefined system type or one you defined. See: Defining and Updating Transaction Types.\n\nOptionally, you can enter the source of the transaction type. See: Defining and Updating Transaction Source Types.\n\nIndicate if inventory information should be defaulted from the serial number.\n\nEnter any optional Shipment information.\n\nOptionally, you can enter the following Shipment information:\n\nA shipment number to uniquely identify an item or group of items to transfer. When the To Org uses intransit inventory, you must enter a value here.\n\nThe freight carrier for the transfer.\n\nA waybill or airbill number for the transfer.\n\nThe number of containers in which the material is stored for the transfer.\n\nThe date you expect to receive the material at the destination organization. You must enter a date equal to or later than the current date. Oracle Inventory uses this date for reporting purposes only.\n\nTo enter the items to transfer\n\nChoose Transaction Lines from the Inter-organization Transfer window.\n\nEnter an inventory item to transfer.\n\nYou can transfer the same item more than once. For example, you can specify an item more than once to transfer partial quantities to different subinventories or stock locators.\n\nFor a direct transfer, if the item is under revision control in either organization, enter a revision that is common to the item in both organizations.\n\nEnter a subinventory from which to transfer the material.\n\nOptionally, enter the subinventory to which to transfer the material. You must enter a value in this field for direct inter-organization transfers.\n\nIf you established locator control for the item, enter from and to locators.\n\nEnter a lot number for the item. If you want to enter multiple lot numbers, complete the remaining steps, then choose the Lot/Serial button to display the Lot Entry window.\n\nFor receipt transactions, if you enter a lot number, enter the date the lot expires. You can enter a value here only if the Lot Expiration (Shelf Life) Control attribute is set to User-defined Expiration Date.\n\nEnter a unit of measure. This can be the primary unit of measure (the default) or any valid alternate unit of measure.\n\nIf you enter an alternate unit of measure, Oracle Inventory issues the quantity you specify in this unit of measure. Oracle Inventory also converts the quantity to the primary unit of measure so that it can correctly update the on-hand quantity.\n\nEnter the quantity of the item to transfer. If the item is under dual unit of measure control, the secondary unit of measure and the secondary quantity populate automatically in the Secondary UOM and Secondary Quantity fields.\n\nOptionally enter a reason code for the transaction. For example, you can use reason codes to allow you to mark exceptional charges to support a quality data collection and reporting system.\n\nYou can also enter up to 240 characters of free text in the Reference field that describe the transaction.\n\nTo enter internal transfer charges to assign to the To organization\n\nEnter a value in the Added Value field that represents the transfer charge. You can enter a value here only if you entered Requested value in the Inter-Organization Transfer Charge field in the Organization Parameters window.\n\nEnter the percent of the transaction value that represents the transfer charge. You can enter a value here only if you entered Requested percent in the Inter-Organization Transfer Charge field in the Organization Parameters window. Defining Inter-Organization Information.\n\nTo enter freight information costs to assign to the From (current) organization:\n\nEnter the transportation cost to physically transfer the material; that is, the freight carrier charges.\n\nEnter the general ledger account to which to charge the value you entered in the Transportation Cost field. Oracle Inventory displays the account you defined for the freight carrier as the default. See: Defining Freight Carriers, Oracle Order Management Implementation Guide.\n\nTo enter a unit number\n\nIf Oracle Project Manufacturing is installed and if you have enabled its end item model/unit effectivity feature, you can enter a unit number for the item. See: Model/Unit Effectivity, Oracle Project Manufacturing Implementation Manual.\n\nNote: The Unit Number field is visible only if you have installed Project Manufacturing.\n\nTo enter lot or serial number information.\n\nChoose the Lot/Serial button.

You can collect statistics to satisfy the European Union's reporting requirements for INTRASTAT, the declaration for imports and exports between countries belonging to the European Union, and EXTRASTAT, the declaration for imports and exports between a country belonging to the European Union and a country external to the European Union. This functionality is also a feature of Oracle Purchasing.\n\nMovement statistics features allow you to:\n\nAutomatically generate movement statistics records based on ship-from and ship-to information, without user intervention.\n\nReport your company's legal entity information, including name, address, and tax registration information.\n\nCapture, maintain, calculate, and report information associated with the movement of material between statistics gathering countries. This includes the ability to record and report corrections.\n\nRun the Movement Statistics Exception Report to validate that all movement statistics records in a period are accurate and ready for reporting.\n\nCapture the invoice value from accounts receivables and accounts payables for material movement. If the invoice information is not available, the system captures the statistical value from the movement transaction.\n\nFreeze statistical information after review and report the information to a government agency.\n\nCreate an audit trail between statistical information and the associated material transactions.\n\nGenerate EDI messages out of movement statistics records.\n\nMajor Features\n\nYou can automatically generate movement statistics records by running the Movement Statistics Processor, a concurrent program that analyzes all the transactions that occur in the system, based on legal entity. You can then validate the records and, for INTRASTAT and EXTRASTAT, create official reporting documents. See: Automatically Generating Movement Statistics Records.\n\nThe Movement Statistics Processor analyzes the following transaction types:\n\nPurchase Receipt\n\nRTV\n\nSales order\n\nRMA\n\nSupplier drop shipment\n\nMulti-org intercompany drop shipment\n\nInventory interorganization movements\n\nInternal requisition\n\nInternal sales order\n\nImportant: The system does not analyze Oracle Inventory miscellaneous receipts and issues because these transactions are considered inventory updates, not material movements.\n\nTo enable the system to automatically generate movement statistics records you define parameters in the Economic Zones and Movement Statistics Parameters windows. See: Setting Up Movement Statistics.\n\nNote: ISO and European Union country codes are supported. See: Territories Window, Oracle System Administrator's Guide .\n\nStatistics Setup\n\nYou can capture and report movement statistics by legal entity. You can specify parameters such as calendar, currency conversion type, weight unit of measure, tax office name, and tax office information.\n\nValidate Movement Statistics Records\n\nYou can use the Movement Statistics Exception Report to validate that all movement statistics records in a period are accurate and ready for reporting. You can identify missing or incomplete entries and make corrections before freezing the information. See: Movement Statistics Exception Report.\n\nReview and Report Movement Statistics\n\nYou can generate both summary and detail reports for movement statistics, including hard copies for government agencies and your own files. See: Movement Statistics Report.\n\nFreeze Movement Statistics\n\nThe Movement Statistics Report provides a run time parameter which allows you to freeze movement information for official INTRASTAT and EXTRASTAT reporting. This option updates the database with any information calculated at report run time to provide a complete history of information reported. This option also allows you to assign a reference number for the information processed by the particular run of the report. Only records that have been frozen can be used to generate EDI messages.\n\nReset Movement Statistics Status\n\nAfter you freeze movement statistics records for official INTRASTAT and EXTRASTAT reporting, you can run the Movement Statistics Reset Status program to reset their status to open. This option allows you to add missing information to records that are frozen. See: Movement Statistics Reset Status Report.\n\nIntegrate with Legacy Systems\n\nMovement statistics functionality provides the ability to integrate with Legacy systems in order to capture material movements from other logistics applications.\n\nEDI Support\n\nYou can generate EDI messages from movement statistics records. These messages are EDIFACT compliant.\n\nLink Movement Statistics to Financial Documents\n\nMovement statistics records are automatically linked to various financial documents based on the transaction type. For example, purchase order receipts are linked to payables invoices, RTVs and RMAs with credit memos, and sales order shipments with receivables invoices.\n\nTrack Multiple Values\n\nYou can capture the invoice value from accounts receivables and accounts payables for material movement. If the invoice information is not available, the system captures the statistical value from the movement transaction.\n\nAutomatic Weight Calculation\n\nOracle Inventory calculates the weight of a material movement by converting the transaction quantity and unit of measure to the appropriate weight and weight unit of measure for the item.\n\nManually Enter Movement Information\n\nYou can manually enter movement information associated with material transactions that are not captured by Oracle Inventory and Purchasing, such as fixed assets. See: Viewing and Maintaining Movement Statistics.\n\nDefining Movement Statistics Parameters\n\nUse the Movement Statistics Parameters window to define the parameters for gathering movement statistics. Oracle Inventory uses this information to validate entry of statistical movement transactions and to properly report the information.
