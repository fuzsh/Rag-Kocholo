        "text": "The better way to do healthcare forms\n\nand eSignature\n\nFor more than 30 years, Interlace Health has pioneered EHR-integrated eForms, eSignature, and workflow technology. Our trusted solutions and unparalleled support have enabled our 1,500+ healthcare clients to save time, cut costs, reduce errors, and improve experiences. Interlace Health’s platform enables several solutions that are accessible by clinicians and patients inside and outside the walls of the healthcare system. These include Forms on Demand, Patient Intake, and Informed Consent.\n\nOur Approach\n\nOur close relationships with our wide range of healthcare client partners have equipped us with a comprehensive understanding of healthcare workflows, and how doctors, nurses, and staff interact with each other and with patients. As a bonus, several members on our team have worked in healthcare settings. All of this experience provides us real-world information on how hospitals create, manage, store and retrieve documents. We have used that insight and experience to develop more practical and efficient solutions.\n\nWe also build collaborative relationships with our customers, so we learn where they have snags or inefficiencies in their processes, and we develop solutions to smooth them out. Because we have fully immersed ourselves in healthcare, we are able to create remarkably, intuitive and effective solutions for our industry that have tightly aligned our customers’ success to our success.\n\nAccessible Mobile Solutions\n\nOur platform enables solutions that are accessible by clinicians and patients inside and outside the walls of the healthcare system. These include patient intake, revenue cycle management, electronic consent, forms-on-demand, downtime contingency, and more.\n\nSeamless Data Exchange\n\nWith Interlace Health, the patient information collected on forms is automatically filed and stored in your EHR, and is accessible instantly to the care team. Important demographic and medical information transfers from one form to another, and feeds back into your EHR.\n\nThe result is greatly improved operational efficiency and enhanced support of your organization’s integration strategy, along with reduced costs, increased collections, and better patient experiences."
