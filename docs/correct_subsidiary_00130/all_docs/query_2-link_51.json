        "text": "EHR use is on the rise. Growing clerical workloads and poorly linked systems that result in physician burnout make clinical practices from large to small integrate EHR systems like Epic, Cerner, Meditech to manage patients‚Äô information electronically.\n\nThese systems serve as a basis for implementing additional apps like telemedicine platforms, patient portals, remote patient monitoring systems, etc. so that the comprehensive data stored in EHRs can be used to optimize processes in the entire healthcare organization.\n\nUsually, healthcare organizations look for the assistance of a reliable healthcare software development vendor to help them integrate different third-party systems into their EHR solutions.\n\nIn today‚Äôs blog, we‚Äôll have a look at the so-called trinity of EHR systems, and compare Cerner vs Epic vs Meditech.\n\nNeed help with software development/product design/ QA? My team, inVerita is comprised of experts in the field who can help you. Let's book a meeting to learn more! üì≤\n\nHow Can Cerner vs Epic vs Mediatech EHRs be Compared\n\nSince the federal government pushed the use of electronic health records in 2009, vendors have been competing to sell their software to healthcare providers.\n\nWhen someone mentions EHRs, these are the first three names that pop up. So it‚Äôs no surprise that healthcare practices frequently look for an unbiased Cerner vs Meditech vs Epic systems evaluation.\n\nBut before we dive into the in-depth Cerner vs Epic vs Meditech comparison, let‚Äôs learn a little bit more about the systems and their market share.\n\nEpic EHR System\n\nEpic is an industry-leading cloud-based EHR software that promotes smooth interdisciplinary collaboration among clinical care teams by centralizing complex electronic medical records. This allows clinicians to provide exceptional patient care with increased effectiveness and efficiency.\n\nIt has been a top EHR system for twelve years in a row, according to KLAS Research. The software held a 35.9% which is the largest hospital market share in the EHR industry for 2022 with 83 hospitals joining its network.\n\nAlthough Epic is considered to be a key EHR provider for large hospitals, it opened new functionality for mid-size practices. ‚ÄúSonnet‚Äù is a more affordable version of the system that offers a realistic price tag for smaller practices.\n\nPros of Epic EHR\n\nThe intuitive design navigation makes the system easy to use for healthcare professionals regardless of their technical background.\n\nThe software offers a lot of third-party integrations such as MyChart, Ambara Health, Iguana, Artera, etc.\n\nThe system is highly scalable and offers a good customization level.\n\nEpic makes nursing super streamlined and effective.\n\nAdvanced reporting features.\n\nCons of Epic EHR\n\nOrganizations report having unpleasant user experiences with customer service that often fail.\n\nEpic is considered pricy in terms of the Meditech vs Cerner vs Epic comparison.\n\nIt requires assistance from the IT team for implementation services.\n\nUnique Features of Epic EHR\n\nEpic has 24 modules catering to different doctors‚Äô specialties.\n\nAn integrated MyChart patient platform allows patients to schedule appointments, chat with doctors, and attend virtual visits.\n\nCare Everywhere and Share Everywhere are the platforms for sharing records among clinicians and patients.\n\nHealthy Planet - a module for identifying care gaps.\n\nIt provides a variety of apps for different devices like smartphones, tablets, and smartwatches.\n\nTelehealth services with real-time patient monitoring, peer-to-peer consultations, etc.\n\nPricing. Pricing options depend on the size and requirements of the organization. Default plans are expensive so it‚Äôs better to get a custom pricing plan which can save organizations a lot of money in monthly charges.\n\nClinics and hospitals may have an average cost of around $500k.\n\nCerner EHR System\n\nWorking for over 40 years, Cerner is a cloud-based solution, mostly popular in clinical and ambulatory practices. It has the second-largest market share in the EHR industry.\n\nSimilar to past years, Oracle Cerner continues to win many small hospitals while losing the big ones. In 2022, it had a 24.9% hospital market share.\n\nPros of Cerner EHR\n\nThe software has great security, it‚Äôs equipped with gold-standard data encryption protocols.\n\nThe platform has a very simple and intuitive interface that can be easily navigated by newcomers. It has a ‚ÄúChart Search‚Äù function that makes it easy to search different options.\n\nPowerful data analytics platform helps physicians to make informed decisions about the most effective course of treatment.\n\nIt integrates not only with its own systems but also extends support to competitors via an open integration API policy.\n\nCons of Cerner EHR\n\nUsers report significant delays in receiving customers delays.\n\nFor practices on budget, Cerner can be very expensive, especially, with advanced integrations.\n\nUnique Features of Cerner EHR\n\nCerner has around 50 modules catering to different doctors‚Äô specialties.\n\nThe HealthLife platform provides patients with tools to manage their health effectively.\n\nThe PowerTouch mobile app to access the EHR on the move.\n\nVirtual Health Care telehealth platform.\n\nCerner Millennium - a product for large hospitals that provides drug alerts, analytics, reporting, etc.\n\nReal-time insurance claims verification makes it easy for healthcare providers to validate the insurance coverage of the patients.\n\nCerner utilizes Cerner Ignite APIs to facilitate integration between third-party applications and the EHR.\n\nPricing. Cerner is much less expensive compared to Epic. Small-size clinics may be charged up to $2250 a month.\n\nMediatech EHR Software\n\nMeditech is a cloud-based platform designed to enhance clinical workflows, operational efficiency, and patient satisfaction.\n\nMeditech had a 16.3% market share in 2022 and 14% of hospital beds. According to KLAS, it was the only major vendor to achieve acute care hospital migrations during the year, securing 14 victories.\n\nIt‚Äôs used by healthcare organizations of all sizes and is suitable for acute and ambulatory care, oncology, nurse, and specialty care.\n\nPros of Mediatech EHR\n\nMeditech has a simple interface and customizable templates so that patient data can be easily shared across the departments.\n\nAn advanced charting system streamlines the management of patient charting and remote monitoring.\n\nThe EHR integrates with FHIR-based third-party applications.\n\nIt also offers integration with Interlace Health allowing automated collection of patients‚Äô signatures.\n\nCons of Mediatech EHR\n\nThe UI can‚Äôt be customized to the individual needs of the practice.\n\nUsers report that the system is quite slow and experiences occasional glitches.\n\nDocumentation is quite hard to understand for new users.\n\nComparing Meditech vs Epic systems and Cerner vs Meditech, Meditech lacks a lot of features.\n\nit has very limited third-party integrations.\n\nMeditech doesn‚Äôt offer a free trial and a free version before you decide to buy a subscription.\n\nUnique Features of Mediatech EHR\n\nPatients are able to update their medications and allergies, add medical history, and check in via QR codes to avoid waiting times.\n\nThrough the Patient Health Portal, patients can arrange virtual appointments, request prescription refills, and pay bills.\n\nMobile apps and tools such as Expanse virtual assistant allow doctors to access data via voice commands.\n\nBesides, the telemedicine solution, Virtual on Demand Care provides urgent care for organizations.\n\nThe clinical decision support feature offers active formats like ordering or documenting, as well as passive formats like alerts and reminders.\n\nPricing. Meditech company doesn‚Äôt disclose the pricing, therefore users should request a personalized pricing plan.\n\nMaking a Choice: Epic, Cerner, or Mediatech?\n\nThe implementation and installation of electronic health systems can cost millions of dollars. Therefore organizations must carefully establish and communicate their long-term goals and requirements before making the final choice.\n\nEpic is the most expensive option among the discussed EHR systems. The implementation of Epic is an uphill task that can be done only with the help of IT team. However, it‚Äôs also a robust and comprehensive EHR system that will bring the processes inside your organization to a new level.\n\nContrary to Epic, Cerner leverages Model Experience to offer superior strategic recommendations for implementation and installation. With the support of its consulting experienced team, organizations can gain a deeper understanding of their EHR and confidently transition to their new system.\n\nMeditech also provides comprehensive support and guidance for implementation and installation through its own set of best practices and strategies. While Meditech may not have a specific program named like Cerner's Model Experience, it offers consulting services and resources to assist organizations in successfully deploying their systems.\n\nPossibility of Migration Between Systems\n\nOrganizations can decide to migrate between healthcare information systems.\n\nHowever, the process of migration is very complex and requires careful planning, coordination, and resources. Healthcare providers need to extract and transfer large volumes of data, reconfigure workflows, train staff on the new system, and ensure interoperability with existing systems. So, it requires careful consideration and expertise to ensure a successful transition.\n\nSumming up\n\nTo conclude, Cerner is widely favored in clinical and ambulatory care, while Epic strives to excel with its innovative solutions. Their offerings are notably similar, encompassing functionalities like revenue cycle management, interoperability, mobile access, and artificial intelligence, and telemedicine software development to reduce costs.\n\nHowever, there are distinctions in their capabilities. For example, Epic features a CRM, unlike Cerner, Cerner offers consulting services, whereas Epic does not, Cerner provides users with real-time data, a feature not present in Epic's offerings.\n\nLike Epic and Cerner, Meditech offers comprehensive EHR solutions, revenue cycle management, interoperability, and telemedicine capabilities. However, Meditech may have differences in certain areas compared to Epic and Cerner, such as the level of customization available, the depth of consulting services provided, and specific features are offered within their platforms.\n\nHowever, sometimes the best decision you can make is to develop your own solution tailored exclusively to the needs of your organization.\n\nIf you‚Äôre looking for a software vendor to assist you, drop us a line for a free consultation.\n\nNeed help with software development/product design/ QA?
