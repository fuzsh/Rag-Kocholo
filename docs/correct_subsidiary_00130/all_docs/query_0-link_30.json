Project Management Perspective ■ Project Management of Merger and Acquisition Projects ▪ Get IT Business Apps into the Transition Planning meetings — Need input into Transition Services Agreement (TSA) and Timeline — Need to know who the key people are at the Acquired Company — Need to understand their Systems Footprint and Architecture ▪ Once the Merger and Acquisition goes Public — Start High Level Discussions with Acquired Company Personnel – Review Business Processes and System Functionality use – Perform Gap/Fit Analysis ; look for custom extensions — Start High Level Discussions with internal Business Mgmt – Get Direction on how they want the new company integrated — Develop High Level Solution Design — Develop High Level Project Plan, Timeline, and Resource Plan\n\n5. Phases of Merger and Acquisition Projects ■ Project Phases follow typical ERP Project Lifecycle ▪ Analysis and Requirements Gathering ▪ Solution Design ▪ Solution Build ▪ Conference Room Pilot Testing ▪ User Acceptance Testing ▪ Production Cutover Testing ▪ Production Cutover ▪ Go-Live ▪ Production Support\n\n6. Implementation Approach ■ 3 C’s of Oracle EBS ▪ Calendar ▪ Currency ▪ Chart of Accounts The 3 C’s are the base components of setup for a new Ledger. If a new Company has the same 3 C’s as the existing Ledger, the new Company can be added into the existing Ledger. If the new Company does not have the same 3 C’s, a new Ledger must be setup for the new Company.\n\n7. Implementation Approach ■ 3 C’s of Acquisition Integration Projects ▪ Configure — Setup and configuration can be done early and turned on as needed in most cases — There may be some setups that require the converted data ▪ Close — The source system must go thru a month end accounting close and detailed financial reports produced for all subledgers and ledger — The target system should go thru a soft month end accounting close and detailed financial reports produced for all subledgers that data will be converted to ▪ Convert — Data conversion should start immediately after Close is complete\n\n8. Production Cutover Plan ■ What is it? ▪ Organization Tool — Structured, Ordered List of Steps and Tasks to Complete for Go-Live — Every task should be assigned to a person to complete — Tasks should have a name/desc. and estimated duration to complete ▪ Communication Tool — E-Mail to project team when cutover starts to kickoff the process — Person performing first task(s) should start and respond to all when complete so next person can begin their task(s) — Communication and handoffs should continue until all tasks complete ▪ Project Management Tool — Allows cutover to be closely monitored - status updates can be made — Allows progress to be measured against the schedule and adjustments made if needed\n\n9. Solution Design ■ High Level Discovery Sessions ▪ Controller — Company Structure — Chart of Accounts Review – GL Segment Value Mapping – Intercompany Accounting Rules – Consolidation Requirements – High Level Discovery Sessions ■ Accounting Systems Analysis ▪ Oracle EBS to Oracle EBS ▪ Other ERP to Oracle EBS ■ Business Process Review and Gap/Fit Analysis ▪ Current process ▪ New process ▪ Process changes identified, impacts\n\n10. Solution Design ■ Human Capital Management (Payroll/Time and Labor) ▪ Employees – are employee numbers duplicated ▪ Number of Payrolls and respective schedules (keep separate or merge?) ▪ Is Payroll EBS - Or 3rd Party? ▪ Time Card Mgmt. — Do all employees enter timecards? — Union Env.? Different Union Rules? ▪ Absence Mgmt. — Are Vacation and PTO plans different? Which ones will remain? ▪ Benefit Mgmt. – Configure in EBS or 3rd party (interface) ▪ Talent Mgmt. – Configure in EBS or 3rd party (interface)\n\n11. Data Conversion ■ Data Mapping ▪ Data Mapping required if source system is not Oracle EBS ▪ Data Mapping is time consuming and requires work from SME’s ▪ Start early, allow plenty of time, build checkpoints into the plan ■ General Ledger ▪ GL Balances ▪ Conversion periods that will be used ▪ Conversion type – journal detail or balance detail or combination — Ex. Journal details for 2 years – GL Balances after that ▪ Determine requirements for any system changes prior to conversion work being done. — Open GL periods – periods for conversion need to be open — Journal posting — Reconciliation approach and requirements\n\n12. Data Conversion ■ Accounts Payable ▪ Suppliers and Supplier Sites — 1099 requirements — Supplier de-duplication — Address cleanup (sales / use tax calculation impact) ▪ Invoices — Determine if you will convert open invoices or use alternatives: – Pay invoices out prior to conversion – eliminating open invoices – Manually convert – data entry – based on volume and resources\n\n13. Data Conversion ■ Receivables ▪ Customers, Addresses, Contacts — Address cleanup (sales tax calculation impact) — De-duplication as required — Limit to open balances or other requirement for what customers get converted. ▪ Invoices — Open AR invoices (determine need for any historical invoices without a balance). ▪ Unapplied Cash Receipts\n\n14. Data Conversion ■ Purchasing ▪ Purchase Orders — Volume to determine if automated or manual ▪ Blanket Purchase Orders — Volume to determine if automated or manual — Price comparison between companies to determine new blankets or combination of blankets for better pricing with vendors. ▪ Open PO Receipts — You have to weight this out for 3-way matching for AP invoices. — Automated conversion given the impact to doing this manual\n\n15. Data Conversion ■ Inventory ▪ Items — Mapping requirements ▪ Stock Locators — Used or not? — Mapping requirements ▪ Subinventories ▪ On Hand Qty and Balances — Costing method – LIFO, FIFO, Average Costing – accounting differences\n\n16. Data Conversion ■ Fixed Assets ▪ Determine what periods the conversion takes place in — Consider retirements and additional processing after the conversion — This is specific to FA because of how certain transaction types are impacted based on period in which an asset is added or converted ▪ Group Assets — Must be done prior to individual Assets conversions, if applicable ▪ In Service Assets — Leased Assets? — Exclude fully Retired Assets — Partially retired assets – convert open cost not original cost. — Determination of above if you need to convert retirements. — Issues with group asset depreciation / reserve conversion\n\n17. Data Conversion ■ Fixed Assets ▪ Asset Keys and other Key flexfield attributes ▪ Data Mapping Requirements — Asset Categories — Locations — Depreciation Methods - variances for potential accounting differences ▪ Depreciation Reserve / YTD Depreciation Expense — Convert for the related assets that are converted.\n\n18. Data Conversion ■ Project Costing ▪ Projects — Mapping requirements — Task structure — Accounting variations — Templates — Capital Projects – Assets / Asset Lines ▪ Tasks — Mapping requirements — Accounting requirements — Capital / Retirement processing\n\n19. Data Conversion ■ Project Costing ▪ Expenditure Organizations — Mapping requirements (cost centers, departments) and relationship to Chart of Accounts. ▪ Expenditure Types — Mapping requirements — Accounting requirements ▪ Open Project Balances — CWIP (Construction Work In Progress) – capital projects – Current open CWIP – Closed CWIP - history — Non Capital projects — Reporting Requirements ▪ Project Budgets\n\n20. Data Conversion ■ Human Resources ▪ Employees and Employee Numbers ▪ Jobs / Assignments — Mapping requirement ▪ Grade / Grade Rates ▪ HR Organizations — Organization Hierarchy — Mapping requirement — Additional information ▪ Locations ▪ PTO Balances (Paid Time Off i.e. sick, vacation) ▪ Other benefit related balances\n\n21. Data Conversion Audit and Reconciliation ■ General Ledger ▪ Actuals Balance conversion — Trial Balance ▪ Budget conversion — Trial Balance ■ Accounts Payables ▪ Supplier Balance conversion — Accounts Payable Trial Balance ■ Accounts Receivables ▪ Customer Balance conversion — AR Aging 7 Bucket Report by Account\n\n22. Data Conversion Audit and Reconciliation ■ Inventory ▪ Quantity / Balance On Hand conversion — All Inventories Value Report — All Inventories Value by Subinventory Report ■ Fixed Assets ▪ Group Asset Cost balance — Custom Report ▪ Group Asset Reserve balance — Custom Report ▪ Non Group Asset balance — Journal Entry Reserve Ledger Report — Account Reconciliation Reserve Ledger Report\n\n23. Data Conversion Audit and Reconciliation ■ Projects ▪ Open CWIP Balances — Custom Report ▪ Open RWIP Balances — Custom Report ▪ Project Balance Conversion balances — Custom Report ▪ Project Budget conversion — Custom Report\n\n24.
