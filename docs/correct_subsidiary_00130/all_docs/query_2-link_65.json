Unlike\n\nCreator3D graphics, the Sun Elite3D architecture does not allow the remapping of the 3D-RAM used for\n\ndouble- and Z-buffering to support a high-resolution, single-buffered configuration due to Sun Elite3D\n\ngraphicsâ interleaving of the memory. The maximum resolution is 1280 x 1024. Because Sun Elite3D\n\ngraphics is designed for high-performance 3-D, and an additional 30 MB of 3D-RAM would be required\n\nfor double- and z-buffering in order to use the 24-inch monitor, it is not cost effective to use Sun Elite3D\n\ngraphics as a high-resolution, single-buffered frame buffer when a less costly Creator3D frame buffer\n\nwould be more appropriate.\n\nSee also PDF .\n\nThe (designed,) maximum resolution for Elite3D mX graphic cards is 1280x1024 (4:3), sorry.\n\nSo you better searching/using a Creator3D Series 1/2/3\n\nAfter searching the Web I found\n\nTGS (Template Graphics Systems, Inc.), then VSG (Visualization Science Group), now FEI (since Aug, 2012)\n\nTGS 3D Master Suite, TGS OpenGL (v1.0.3) and TGS OpenInventor were also Third-Party applications in the package \"Ultra Pack Volume 2, CD-ROM #6\".

B/AFB.html\n\nIf you're knowing the later products with UltraSPARC III(+), named Blade 1000 and 2000 then you're able to imagine that the housing is originated from the Ultra 80 lines of workstations. I owned one myself years ago and it's still an impressive workstation system, completely outdated ok, but able to run 4 threads in hardware simultaneously in comparison to faster Blade 1k/2k successors which were able of \"only\" two (in hardware).\n\nThere were some quad processor workstations by Sun, e.g.\n\n- Sparcstation 10, 20\n\n- Ultra 450 (same housing as Enterprise 450, but bigger footprint)\n\n- Ultra 80\n\nBest graphics for Ultra 80 in general i.m.o. is XVR-1200 (3Dlabs)\n\nbut best UPA graphics should be the mentioned XVR-1000\n\nSun SPARCstation 2GX (SPARC V7, 1990)\n\nSun Blade 2000 w/ XVR-1000 (SPARC V9, 2002)\n\nMelkhior wrote: Ultra 1 will support up to 9 (10 doesn't support the UltraSPARC I cpu).\n\nSolaris 10 not, right but OpenSXCE of course because it was \"back-ported\" to UltraSPARC I. You should give it a try.\n\nSun SPARCstation 2GX (SPARC V7, 1990)\n\nSun Blade 2000 w/ XVR-1000 (SPARC V9, 2002)\n\nHi,\n\nmaybe the location for asking was not pointed correctly ( viewtopic.php?t=16730114 )\n\ndoes someone have one of the following papers scanned (image) or in PS, PDF format or know how to get them and would share it with me, please?\n\nfor reading...\n\n\" SPARCstation 2GS / SPARCstation 2GT Technical White Paper \", Sun Microsystems, 1990\n\nThis describes the highest performance graphics accelerators available from Sun.\n\nSource: \"Sun Performance Tuning OverviewâJune 1991\", Adrian Cockcroft\n\nfor fun...\n\nSPARCstation 2 marketing brochure / flyer (complete)\n\nKnown search engines didn't help me at this point, several times.\n\nThanks so far.\n\nescimo\n\nSPARC: Sun SPARCstation 2 (1990), Sun Blade 2000 (2002)\n\nx86: SNI PCD-3M (1989), SNI PCD-4H (1993), SNI Scenic Pro C5 (1996)\n\nSo the NVRAM is dead?

My misunderstanding of you text?\n\n(Memory) Configuration Rules\n\nThe following memory configuration rules apply to your system:\n\nAt least one memory bank (all four bank slots) must be filled for the system to boot\n\nEach bank used must have four identical capacity DIMMs installed (for example, four 64-Mbyte DIMMs or four 256-Mbyte DIMMs)\n\nDIMMs must be added four at a time within the same bank\n\nNote â In the Sun Enterprise 420R server, each memory bank comprises two slots on the main logic board, and two slots on the memory riser card. As you add memory, fully populate each bank by inserting DIMMs into the two slots comprising each bank on both the main logic board and on the memory riser card. For information about removing and installing DIMMs, see the Sun Enterprise 420R Server Service Manual.\n\nDIMM capacities can differ from one bank to the nextâfor example, four 64-Mbyte\n\nDIMMs installed in bank 0 and four 256-Mbyte DIMMs installed in bank 2 is permissible\n\n(...)\n\n(CPU) Configuration Rules\n\nThe following rules apply for your system:\n\nYou can install up to four UltraSPARC II CPU modules into the server.\n\nThe first CPU module is inserted into CPU slot 2 (J0301) ;\n\ntwo CPU modules are installed into CPU slot 2 (J0301) and into CPU slot 1 (J0201);\n\nthree CPU modules are installed into CPU slot 2 (J0301), into CPU slot 1 (J0201), and into CPU slot 3 (J0401);\n\nwhile four CPU modules occupy all the CPU module slots.\n\nIf you install more than one CPU module, the modules must operate at identical clock speeds (450 MHz, for example) and they must have the same size cache memory . This generally means the CPU modules must have the same part number .\n\nSource: Sun Enterprise 420R Server Owner's Guide, p.64 and p.66\n\nCode: Select all\n\n[part 1/2 of four RAM/memory banks on mainboard]\n\n[part 2/2 of four RAM/memory banks on memory riser assembly]\n\n[CPU Slot 3, install 3rd]\n\n[CPU Slot 2, install 1st]Â Â Â Â <--- insert first/single CPU in Slot 2 !\n\n[CPU Slot 1, install 2nd]\n\n[CPU Slot 0, install 4th]\n\n[PCI slots]\n\nSource: Sun Enterprise 420R Server Service Manual, p.69\n\nFurther breakdown: remove all but one CPU and all PCI cards.

However, before replacing the main logic board you should:\n\na. Remove optional PCI cards.\n\nb. Remove optional DIMMs. Leave only the four DIMMs in Bank A.\n\n(also refered as bank 0 and means: mem slots U0301+U0302 at riser board and mem slots U1301+U1302 at the mainboard)\n\nc. Repeat POST to determine if any of these modules caused the failure.\n\nd. If POST still fails, then replace the main logic board.\n\nSource: Sun Enterprise 420R Server Service Manual, p. 207\n\nAlso looking at:\n\n- Sun Enterprise 420R Server Service Manual, p. 189-191, error code definitions.\n\n- Sun Enterprise 420R Server Owner's Guide, p. 115ff, Chapter 7 Diagnostics and Troubleshooting\n\n- Sun Enterprise 420R Server: Field Information Notices (FIN)\n\n- Sun Enterprise 420R Server: InfoDocs (e.g. 47161 CPU shroud or CPU card cage assembly may not seat properly in .../Sun Enterprise 420R/...)\n\nSPARC: Sun SPARCstation 2 (1990), Sun Blade 2000 (2002)\n\nx86: SNI PCD-3M (1989), SNI PCD-4H (1993), SNI Scenic Pro C5 (1996)\n\n@jirka: So you outbid me once in the auction for the RW320 from austria!

Any more information about it?\n\nUnfortunatelly only the infos within the code block of the former post.\n\nThere is a white paper \" SPARCstation 2GS / SPARCstation 2GT Technical White Paper \", but nobody seems to have a copy.\n\nIf you want to compare it with solutions of other vendors, e.g. with SGI, HP/Apollo, IBM, DEC or highend PC's, look after workstation solutions dating back to late 1990 (Nov, 5 = anouncment of the SPARCstation 2GS). At least there will be differences between the used graphic APIs. This entry-level solid graphics sub-system with 24-bit color depth capability is optimized using the Sun XGL and Pixrect/Pixwin API libs .\n\nDepending on the level of optimization within the graphics pipeline (implemented through device handler/driver), there are some functions accelerated in hardware other in software (host CPU). But for sure, the sub-system is by far less performant if used for ordinary/all day windowing operations (RasterOps), for which e.g. a CG6/cgsix is the better choice. Of course, also heat is a serious point here.\n\nThe example picture with the starship Enterprise is only wireframe, not a solid model. Anyway nice.\n\nFor creating something simple (some \"simple\" solids) you need also the development headers of the libs, which were sold separately with SDK (Solaris Software Development Kits).\n\nNoticed it? One board is manufactured in collaboration with Matrox Electronic Systems. For each of the colors red, green, blue there is one dedicated DAC chip (BT).\n\nSun Solaris 2.4 @ SPARCstation 2 and SNI PCD-4H .

For U40 M1 it should be at least 1.60.\n\nSources:\n\nhttps://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19127-01/ul ... index.html\n\nhttps://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19127-01/ul ... Id-1006784\n\nDuring POST, the BIOS outputs the error code to I/O port 80h. The workstation\n\nmotherboard is equipped with a two segment LED display that displays the current\n\nvalue of port 80h.\n\nIf the BIOS detects a terminal error condition, it issues a terminal-error beep code,\n\nattempts to display the error code on upper left corner of the screen and on the port\n\n80h LED display, and halts POST. If the system hangs before the BIOS can process\n\nthe error, the value displayed at port 80h is the last test performed.\n\n211 is 0xD3. - Mmm, nothing according to the service manual.\n\nor maybe w/o 2 will be 11 \"General dispatcher for alternate register initialization. Set initial POST values for other hardware devices defined in the register tables.\"\n\nIt's helpful to put all unrequired hardware out of the system (HDD, SCSI-Ctrl) and restore the BIOS defaults by switch/jumper on the motherboard.\n\nWhich hex code is shown by POST on the two segment LED (motherboard)?\n\nSun Solaris 2.4 @ SPARCstation 2 and SNI PCD-4H .

However, if you replace a single DIMM, the new DIMM must be identical to the DIMM that you removed.\n\n(...)\n\nSun Ultra 40 memory is installed as pairs of DDR400 PC3200 Registered ECC DIMMs. Sun Ultra 40 M2 memory is installed as pairs of DDR2-667 DIMMs.\n\n(...)\n\nThe DIMMs in a pair must be identical, from the same manufacturer with the same type and number of memory devices, the same amount of memory per device, and the same memory speed. All installed DIMMs must have the same memory speed.\n\nThe minimum configuration is two 512-Mbyte DIMMs installed in slots 0 and 1 .\n\nCaution - The Ultra 40 and Ultra 40 M2 DIMMs are numbered the same but located differently, and this difference is critical. On the Ultra 40, DIMM slots 0/1 and 4/5 are closestto their respective CPUs. On the Ultra 40 M2, DIMM slots 0/1 and 4/5 are farthest from their respective CPUs .\n\nSun Solaris 2.4 @ SPARCstation 2 and SNI PCD-4H .

Nice pricing policy, isn't?\n\nI would be not surprised if Oracle planning to cancel further development of Solaris.\n\nBut then I like to see Larry in a commercial similiar to this for confusing (Open-) and Solaris enterprises and community - LOL\n\nFirst experiences with Solaris 8 on x86 desktop with Pentium III, FSC D1107-B mainboard, 512 MB SDR-RAM, Matrox Millennium G200 AGP 8MB, SCSI, SoundBlaster 16 ISA. Went all fine.\n\nBack in 2008 I registerd my FSC Primergy TX120S1 after successful completion of Sun Hardware Certification Test Suite for Solaris 10. The server was added to the Sun HCL starting from 5/08. Without support by Sun because the OS didn't support the network chipset in 5/08, not so for OpenSolaris 2008.05.\n\nLooking at the HCL for Solaris 11, there seems to be less systems certfied or maybe nobody wants to certify systems for Oracle. Shame and blessing.\n\nSun Solaris 2.4 @ SPARCstation 2 and SNI PCD-4H . Migration path: NetBSD"
