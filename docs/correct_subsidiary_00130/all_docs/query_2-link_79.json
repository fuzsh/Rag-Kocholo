She received an undergraduate degree in engineering from Brown University, magna cum laude, and an MBA from Stanford University. Prior to joining Accel, Ranzetta was founding vice president of business development & sales at Release Software, a management consultant at Bain & Company, and a manager at Silicon Graphics. Recently, Ranzetta has been instrumental in building Accel’s New York office, and told CNN in 2011 that she spends 100 days on the road per year as she travels between Silicon Valley and New York.\n\nAt Accel, where she was the only female partner until 2008, Ranzetta has been responsible for several of the firm’s most successful investments, including Interlace Systems (purchased by Oracle), Xoopit (purchased by Yahoo!) and Zimbra (also purchased by Yahoo!). Ranzetta currently serves on the board of directors of several private Internet companies including Birchbox, Glam Media, LearnVest, and Trulia. Ranzetta also serves as a Trustee on the Brown University Corporation board, and sits on the board of directors at DonorsChoose.org. She’s also a member of the Stanford University Graduate School of Business Trust."
