Although most currently available ERP applications generally are tailored to the needs of the manufacturing industry, many large healthcare systems are investigating these applications. Due to the significant differences between manufacturing and patient care, ERP-based systems do not easily translate to the healthcare setting. In particular, the lack of clinical standardization impedes the use of ERP systems for clinical integration. Nonetheless, an ERP-based system can help a healthcare organization integrate many functions, including patient scheduling, human resources management, workload forecasting, and management of workflow, that are not directly dependent on clinical decision making.\n\nThe influence of enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems' performance on earnings management\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nTsai, Wen-Hsien; Lee, Kuen-Chang; Liu, Jau-Yang; Lin, Sin-Jin; Chou, Yu-Wei\n\n2012-11-01\n\nWe analyse whether there is a linkage between performance measures of enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems and earnings management. We find that earnings management decreases with the higher performance of ERP systems. The empirical result is as expected. We further analyse how the dimension of the DeLone and McLean model of information systems success affects earnings management. We find that the relationship between the performance of ERP systems and earnings management depends on System Quality after ERP implementation. The more System Quality improves, the more earnings management is reduced.\n\nERP II: Next-generation Extended Enterprise Resource Planning\n\nDEFF Research Database (Denmark)\n\nMÃ¸ller, Charles\n\n2004-01-01\n\nERP II (ERP/2) systems is a new concept introduced by Gartner Group in 2000 in order to label the latest extensions of the ERP-systems.

In order to avoid ERP implementation failure and realise the benefits of the system, sound risk management is the key. This paper proposes a probabilistic risk assessment approach for ERP system implementation projects based on fault tree analysis, which models the relationship between ERP system components and specific risk factors. Unlike traditional risk management approaches that have been mostly focused on meeting project budget and schedule objectives, the proposed approach intends to address the risks that may cause ERP system usage failure. The approach can be used to identify the root causes of ERP system implementation usage failure and quantify the impact of critical component failures or critical risk events in the implementation process.\n\nSuccessful Issues for Implementing Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP)\n\nInstitute of Scientific and Technical Information of China (English)\n\nLI Bing-guang; Michael W.

In this study, several interactions have been studied in different phases, such as the strategic priorities and strategic planning defined as ERP Strategy; business processes review and the ERP selection in the pre-implementation phase, the project management and ERP adaptation in the implementation phase, as well as the ERP revision and integration efforts in the post-implementation phase. Through rigorous use of case study methodology, this research led to developing and to testing a framework for maximizing the benefits of the ERP systems, and seeks to contribute for the generation of ERP initiatives to optimize their performance.\n\nHow to Disable Mortal Loops of Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP Implementation: A System Dynamics Analysis\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nKaveh M. Cyrus\n\n2018-01-01\n\nFull Text Available Successful Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP implementation depends upon various factors known as critical success factors (CSFs. This study developed a system dynamics model of ERP implementation based on CSFs to discuss ERP implementation complexities, which identifies the effect of CSF interrelations on different aspects of ERP project failure. Based on the model hypothesis, CSF interrelations include many causal loop dependencies. Some of these causal loops are called mortal loops, because they may cause the failure of risk reduction efforts to a more severe failure in effect of lack of system thinking on CSFs interrelations. This study discusses how system thinking works as a leverage point for overcoming ERP implementation challenges.\n\nMAXIMIZING THE BENEFITS OF ERP SYSTEMS\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nPaulo AndrÃ© da ConceiÃ§Ã£o Menezes; Fernando GonzÃ¡lez-LadrÃ³n-de-Guevara\n\n2010-01-01\n\nThe ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) systems have been consolidated in companies with different sizes and sectors, allowing their real benefits to be definitively evaluated.

ERP is more than a software package; it includes the efforts and activities to integrate internal and external management information, business process automation and reengineering, and organisation structure streamlining. Thus, ERP eventually leads to an efficient and competitive business. Despite the prominence of ERP systems, approximately three-quarters of ERP projects are deemed as failures. Most failures are attributed to the misfit between pre-loaded business models in the ERP system and business requirements in the real world. This paper introduces a framework to classify ERP misfits into logical categories that provide insights for solution derivation. Subsequently, the classification methods are applied to a case study. Practitioners can use the misfit classification method to derive corresponding actions as solutions for ERP misfits based on their nature or specificity. In addition, the theoretical contribution of the ERP misfit problem is explored to provide information for researchers to determine appropriate theories and concepts explaining this domain.\n\nERP application of real-time vdc-enabled last planner system for planning reliability improvement\n\nDEFF Research Database (Denmark)\n\nCho, S.; SÃ¸rensen, Kristian Birch; Fischer, M.\n\n2009-01-01\n\nThe Last Planner System (LPS) has since its introduction in 1994 become a widely used method of AEC practitioners for improvement of planning reliability and tracking and monitoring of project progress.

Y.; Zakirova, Ch S.\n\n2018-05-01\n\nERP in a modern enterprise information system allowed optimizing internal business processes, reducing production costs and increasing the attractiveness of enterprises for investors. It is an important component of success in the competition and an important condition for attracting investments in the key sector of the state. A vivid example of these systems are enterprise information systems using the methodology of ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning - enterprise resource planning). ERP is an integrated set of methods, processes, technologies and tools. It is based on: supply chain management; advanced planning and scheduling; sales automation; tool responsible for configuring; final resource planning; intelligence business; OLAP technology; block e- Commerce; management of product data. The main purpose of ERP systems is the automation of interrelated processes of planning, accounting and management in key areas of the company. ERP systems are automated systems that effectively address complex problems, including optimal allocation of business resources, ensuring quick and efficient delivery of goods and services to the consumer. Knowledge embedded in ERP systems provided enterprise-wide automation to introduce the activities of all functional departments of the company as a single complex system. At the level of quality estimates, most managers understand that the implementations of ERP systems is a necessary and useful procedure. Assessment of the effectiveness of the information systems implementation is relevant.\n\nThe Challenge of Implementing an ERP System in a Small and Medium Enterprise--A Teaching Case of ERP Project Management\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nXu, Hongjiang; Rondeau, Patrick J.; Mahenthiran, Sakthi\n\n2011-01-01\n\nEnterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system implementation projects are notoriously risky.

It compels them to lower total cost in the entire supply chain, shorten throughput time, reduce inventory, expand product choice, provide more reliable delivery dates and better customer service, improve quality, and efficiently coordinate demand, supply and production. In order to accomplish these objectives, the manufacturing organizations are turning to enterprise resource planning (ERP system, which is an enterprise-wide information system to interlace all the necessary business functions, such as product planning, purchasing, inventory control, sales, financial and human resources into a single system having a shared database. Thus to survive in the global competitive environment, implementation of a suitable ERP system is mandatory. However, selecting a wrong ERP system may adversely affect the manufacturing organizationâs overall performance. Due to limitations in available resources, complexity of ERP systems and diversity of alternatives, it is often difficult for a manufacturing organization to select and install the most suitable ERP system. In this paper, two ERP system selection problems are solved using fuzzy multi-objective optimization on the basis of ratio analysis (MOORA method and it is observed that in both the cases, SAP is the best solution.\n\n76 FR 47055 - Emergency Restoration Plan (ERP)\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\n2011-08-04\n\n...

Consequently, the central research problem is: To determine the impact of ERP systems on organisational performance by analysing achieved ERP benefits within the framework of a suitable performance measurement system (PMS, and to investigate the association between critical success factors (CSFs and ERP benefits. A list of expected ERP benefits and CSFs is compiled. Performance measurement models are evaluated, and one model is designed to evaluate ERP impact. ERP experts refine identified ERP benefits and CSFs using structured interviews. These are built into a questionnaire, and used to survey South African (SA companies in manufacturing, mining, and power generation. Results indicate that business benefits are realised by companies that implement ERP systems. By building benefits into the performance measurement model, a positive impact on organisational performance is observed. Although a core list of CSFs is identified, and three associations are found between CSFs and ERP benefits, further research is needed.\n\nAccentra Pharmaceuticals: Thrashing through ERP Systems\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nBradds, Nathan; Hills, Emily; Masters, Kelly; Weiss, Kevin; Havelka, Douglas\n\n2017-01-01\n\nImplementing and integrating an Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system into an organization is an enormous undertaking that requires substantial cash outlays, time commitments, and skilled IT and business personnel.

It examines the human factors that influence ERP user satisfaction. The presented survey tests 14 hypotheses and is based on the model developed by Zviran, Pliskin & Levin [21]. An additional factor has been added to the specified model, the self-efficacy factor analyzed by Bandura [1]. The results are based on 250 ERP users that responded to the survey. The key findings that were revealed by data analysis were that none of the human socio-demographic characteristics do influence ERP user satisfaction. Additionally it was found that perceived usefulness and self-efficacy are the key directors of the ERP user satisfaction. Moreover suggestions are given about how the companies should handle ERP usage in order to develop the prerequisites for increasing user satisfaction and productivity accordingly.\n\nTeaching ERP Systems: A Multi-Perspective View on the ERP System Market\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nWinkelmann, Axel; Leyh, Christian\n\n2010-01-01\n\nIn order to increase the diversity in IS education, we discuss an approach for teaching medium-sized ERP systems in university courses.

When organizations evaluate an ERP, they commonly develop their own selection criteria that usually involve various system and vendor related factors. While the selection process is critical, however, there is an apparent research gap in literature. The ERP selection effort also focuses on the systemâs fit with the organizational requirements and needs. Thus, the selection phase is critical, because if an organization chooses an unfit ERP, the whole project could be predestined to fail. This research provides an overview of an ERP selection process at an overseas branch office of a multinational company. The process employed a simple multi-attribute rating technique (SMART for evaluation. In addition, this research presents how cross-border data protection laws between the parent company and its branch have influenced the selection process. As the ERP system has been implemented successfully, the method and the selection factors have been proven adequate for the selection process.\n\nEvolution of ERP Systems in the Cloud: A Study on System Updates\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nElise Bjelland\n\n2018-06-01\n\nFull Text Available Cloud-based enterprise resource planning (ERP systems emerged around the new millennium, and since then there has been a lack of research regarding the evolution and update processes of these systems. From the usersâ perspective, updates in a traditional on-premise ERP system are carried at their own request; while cloud-based ERPs are compulsory updated. Through an established ERP lifecycle framework, this study investigates how the process of updates is conducted in a cloud ERP context, from both the usersâ and vendorsâ perspectives. A multiple case study was conducted in Norway at 10 client organizations, as well as a cloud ERP vendor. Our main findings suggest that the vendor and the users view the process of updates differently. The main challenges with the process of updates from the usersâ perspective are the size and date of the updates, lack of information and communication during the process, and extinction of certain functionalities. Yet, the main advantages are that all system users will always have the same version of the system, users do not need to spend time on updating the system and paying attention to the ERP market, which leads to more focus on their core competences instead.\n\nOrganizational memory and the completeness of process modeling in ERP systems\n\nNARCIS (Netherlands)\n\nvan Stijn, E.J.; Wensley, A.K.P.\n\n2001-01-01\n\nEnterprise resource planning (ERP) systems not only have a broad functional scope promising to support many different business processes, they also embed many different aspects of the companyâs organizational memory.

The net present value (NPV) method is principally adopted to evaluate the value of ERP. However, the NPV method assumes no uncertainties exist in the object. It doesn't satisfy the current business circumstances which are filled with dynamic issues. Since the 1990s the effectiveness of option pricing models for Information System (IS) investment to solve issues in the NPV method has been discussed in the IS literature. This paper presents 3 business cases to review the practical advantages of such techniques for IS investments, especially ERP investments. The first case is EDI development. We evaluate the project by a new approach with lighting one of shadow options, EDI implementation. In the second case we reveal an ERP investment has an âexpanding optionâ in a case of eliminating redundancy. The third case describes an option to contract which is deliberately slotted in ERP development to prepare transferring a manufacturing facility.\n\nCompetitive advantage in the ERP system's value-chain and its influence on future development\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nJohansson, BjÃ¶rn; Newman, Mike\n\n2010-02-01\n\nUsing the resource-based view, we present a set of propositions related to enterprise resource planning (ERP) development, reflections on competitive advantage and the different roles that stakeholders play in the value-chain.

Cloud computing has become the new trend of how organizations conduct business and has enabled them to innovate and compete in a dynamic environment through new and innovative business models. The growing popularity and success of the cloud has led to the emergence of cloud-based Software-as-a-Service (SaaS ERP systems, a new alternative approach to traditional on-premise ERP systems. Cloud-based ERP has a myriad of benefits for organizations. However, infrastructure engineers need to address data security issues before moving their enterprise applications to the cloud. Cloud-based ERP raises specific concerns about the confidentiality and integrity of the data stored in the cloud. Such concerns that affect the adoption of cloud-based ERP are based on the size of the organization. Small to medium enterprises (SMEs gain the maximum benefits from cloud-based ERP as many of the concerns around data security are not relevant to them. On the contrary, larger organizations are more cautious in moving their mission critical enterprise applications to the cloud. A hybrid solution where organizations can choose to keep their sensitive applications on-premise while leveraging the benefits of the cloud is proposed in this paper as an effective solution that is gaining momentum and popularity for large organizations.\n\nThe interoperability force in the ERP field\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nBoza, AndrÃ©s; Cuenca, Llanos; Poler, RaÃºl; Michaelides, Zenon\n\n2015-04-01\n\nEnterprise resource planning (ERP) systems participate in interoperability projects and this participation sometimes leads to new proposals for the ERP field.

Second, the initiatives in the ERP field driven by interoperability requirements have been identified from two perspectives: technological and business. The ERP field is evolving from classical ERP as information system integrators to a new generation of fully interoperable ERP. Interoperability is changing the way of running business, and ERP systems are changing to adapt to the current stream of interoperability.\n\nModularity, Integration and IT Personnel Skills Factors in Linking ERP to SCM Systems\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nSock H Chung\n\n2010-12-01\n\nFull Text Available This study investigates some underlying technological factors for linking enterprise resource planning (ERP to supply chain management (SCM systems. ERP systems serve technological requirements across functional areas within a corporate boundary while SCM systems focus on collaborative relationships with partners in the supply chain, emphasizing business process integration and information sharing through IT. In order to facilitate SCM operations for business planning and decision making, an ERP system must be extensible in terms of support for a range of external constituents in the supply chain. The research reported in this paper investigates these linkages and provides a framework for developing and evaluating SCM processes in order to serve enterprise needs in terms of resource management for scalability, implementation costs and operational efficiency for meeting the business objectives.\n\nUser Satisfaction Issues in ERP Projects\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nShahin Dezdar\n\n2012-01-01\n\nOver the past few years, companies in developing countries have implemented enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems.

Compared to large enterprises, SMEs differ in a number of inherent characteristics, which are likely to impact the ERP system implementations. The purpose of this study is to explore these influences of the SME context on the ERP system implementation process. SME characteristics are synthesised from relevant literature and the influences of the contextual factors on various activities across the ERP life cycle are investigated. The study presents findings from a multiple case study of four SMEs. The ownership type of the companies and limited resources were identified as the most influential contextual factors. Among the ERP life-cycle phases, the implementation phase was affected most by the SME context. The case studies also illustrate the need for a more nuanced view on what should be considered general characteristics of SMEs; for example, regarding the level of IS knowledge, business processes, and market characteristics.\n\nHealthcare Firms and the ERP Systems\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nA.

A consistent alignment is therefore an essential success factor of ERP projects. To manage this alignment, an 'Operational Model Based' method is proposed. It is based on the design and the matching of models, and conforms to the modelling views and constructs of the ISO 19439 and 19440 enterprise-modelling standards. It is characterised by: (1) a predefined design and matching order of the models; (2) the formalisation, in terms of modelling constructs, of alignment and misalignment situations; and (3) their association with a set of decisions in order to mitigate the misalignment risk. Thus, a comprehensive understanding of the alignment management during ERP projects is given. Unlike existing methods, this one includes decisions related to the organisational changes an ERP system can induce, as well as criteria on which the best decision can be based. In this way, it provides effective support and guidance to companies implementing ERP systems, as the alignment process is detailed and structured. The method is applied on the ERP project of a Small and Medium Enterprise, showing that it can be used even in contexts where the ERP project expertise level is low.\n\nLexical Planning in Sentence Production Is Highly Incremental: Evidence from ERPs.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nZhao, Li-Ming; Yang, Yu-Fang\n\n2016-01-01\n\nThe scope of lexical planning, which means how far ahead speakers plan lexically before they start producing an utterance, is an important issue for research into speech production, but remains highly controversial. The present research investigated this issue using the semantic blocking effect, which refers to the widely observed effects that participants take longer to say aloud the names of items in pictures when the pictures in a block of trials in an experiment depict items that belong to the same semantic category than different categories. As this effect is often interpreted as a reflection of difficulty in lexical selection, the current study took the semantic blocking effect and its associated pattern of event-related brain potentials (ERPs) as a proxy to test whether lexical planning during sentence production extends beyond the first noun when a subject noun-phrase includes two nouns, such as \"The chair and the boat are both red\" and \"The chair above the boat is red\". The results showed a semantic blocking effect both in onset latencies and in ERPs during the utterance of the first noun of these complex noun-phrases but not for the second noun. The indication, therefore, is that the lexical planning scope does not encompass this second noun-phrase. Indeed, the present findings are in line with accounts that propose radically incremental lexical planning, in which speakers plan ahead only one word at a time. This study also provides a highly novel example of using ERPs to examine the production of long utterances, and it is hoped the present demonstration of the effectiveness of this approach inspires further application of ERP techniques in this area of research.\n\nEnterprise resource planning (ERP) implementation using the value engineering methodology and Six Sigma tools\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nLeu, Jun-Der; Lee, Larry Jung-Hsing\n\n2017-09-01\n\nEnterprise resource planning (ERP) is a software solution that integrates the operational processes of the business functions of an enterprise. However, implementing ERP systems is a complex process. In addition to the technical issues, companies must address problems associated with business process re-engineering, time and budget control, and organisational change. Numerous industrial studies have shown that the failure rate of ERP implementation is high, even for well-designed systems. Thus, ERP projects typically require a clear methodology to support the project execution and effectiveness. In this study, we propose a theoretical model for ERP implementation. The value engineering (VE) method forms the basis of the proposed framework, which integrates Six Sigma tools. The proposed framework encompasses five phases: knowledge generation, analysis, creation, development and execution. In the VE method, potential ERP problems related to software, hardware, consultation and organisation are analysed in a group-decision manner and in relation to value, and Six Sigma tools are applied to avoid any project defects. We validate the feasibility of the proposed model by applying it to an international manufacturing enterprise in Taiwan. The results show improvements in customer response time and operational efficiency in terms of work-in-process and turnover of materials. Based on the evidence from the case study, the theoretical framework is discussed together with the study's limitations and suggestions for future research.\n\nFunctional dependency between the logistics security system and the MySAP ERP in metallurgy\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nP.

Essentially, the systemâs role will be viewed in the perspective of regenerating better accounting practices in an advanced business setting and considering the size of the enterprise. However, a satisfying part of the paper attempts to bring out a clear depiction of the Enterprise Resource Planning paradigm/system as the main tool to take any credit made in the business accounts mechanics and base criteria. Subsequently, through this paper, all the roles of the tool at hand in enhancing accounting practices will substantially be played up. This research uses Jordan as the suitable setting for the realization of ERPâs comprehensive capabilities. An empirical research on Jordanian mining industry is used for sampling results as well as a theoretical critical review on the organisations adoption of the ERP system on their accounting systems (Naash & Khamis, 2009. Similarly, the Jordanian banks are briefly highlighted on a theoretical mode in phase of testing the both the alternative and null hypothesis. The empirical study is analyzed using a custom bucketing methodology on measuring the trends in the open-ended questions and attributed to efficiency. The latter are the variables tested on the open-ended questions. On the other hand, the closed questions are subjected to the analysis of variance (ANOVA where the variances between the âyesâ and ânoâ responses is checked. The two analytical approaches of the questionnaires yields are interrelated because of the homogeneity of the question types. Objectively, the null hypotheses Hâ is tested by implying on the risk factors and challenges facing the system implementation in the organization; it is from the corresponding findings where the research infer its recommendations.

This article examines the symmetry intrinsic in social construction within the various stages of the ERP development life cycle, from initiation to implementation. Discourse on symmetry focuses on whether social constructs are able to influence ERP implementation positively (success or negatively (failure and whether this exposes ERP systems to information security risk. The theoretical lens of social construction of technology (SCOT theory, a theory premised on social interaction between agents and technology artefacts, is applied for this purpose. The research was quantitative with a survey having been conducted on information technology (IT and information security (IS practitioners. Results of the study highlight the significant role social construction plays because of the direct linkage it has with the implementation of information security controls in ERP systems. Â The research delineated five social constructs, namely positional influence, reward influence, coercive influence, expert influence and referent influence. For purposes of this research and on the sampling criteria applied, the construct âexpert influenceâ, a typology of social construction, is shown to be more domineering than other typologies of social construction and is seen as providing symmetrical balance between governing ERP security (success and risk (failure. Implications of these results for theory and practice are discussed in the main article.\n\nA requirements engineering framework for cross-organizational ERP systems\n\nNARCIS (Netherlands)\n\nDaneva, Maia; Wieringa, Roelf J.\n\n2006-01-01\n\nThe development of cross-organizational enterprise resource planning (ERP) solutions is becoming increasingly critical to the business strategy of many networked companies.

Traditionally, computerised information systems are viewed as objects. In contrast, by viewing the in-formation system as an actor, the understanding of the structuration process increases. The user, being influenced by the ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning system and giving it an actor role, thereby also confers agency on the ERP system; through its very use it influences actions and thus also the structure. Based on a case study of ERP use in an ABB company over a decade, five different roles played by the ERP systems were identified. The ERP systems acted as Bureaucrat, Manipulator, Administrative assistant, Consultant or were dismissed (Dismissed in the sense that intended users chose to avoid using them. These terms are defined in the full text. The purpose of this approach here is not to \"animate\" the information systems, to give them life or a mind of their own, but rather to make explicit the socially constructed roles conferred on them by users and others who are affected by them. On this basis, it is possible to suggest how the roles can help us open up new areas of exploration concerning the fruitful use of IT.\n\nDeveloping a cultural perspective on ERP\n\nNARCIS (Netherlands)\n\nBoersma, F.K.; Kingma, S.F.\n\n2005-01-01\n\nPurpose - To develop an analytical framework through which the organizational cultural dimension of enterprise resource planning (ERP) implementations can be analyzed.

In China, this is especially true due to the nationalistic culture of business. The way ERP systems are perceived, treated, and integrated within the business plays a critical role in the success or failure of the implementation. When a Western developed ERP system is implemented in a country where the culture differs greatly from that of the developer, implementation may require localization in order to be successful. In doing so, strategic benefits of ERP systems may be diminished. This research paper looks into the characteristics of Chinese localization by Western vendors and the implications to the Chinese enterprise.

However, both ERP implementations and IT offshoring are fraught with risks, and when both ERP implementation and IT offshoring happen together, the risks become even more pronounced. Therefore, it is important to understand and identify the issues of ERP implementation in an offshoring situation. Objectives: The purpose of this paper is to highlight the key factors that enable successful offshoring ERP implementation from the client and the vendor perspective. Methods/Approach: The paper uses literature as a basis for identifying a critical success factor, data collected through semi-structured interviews with ERP managers at various levels of the subject organizations, and eventually their analysis. Results: The findings of the paper reveal that various factors are critical while implementing offshoring ERP. They include: offshoring partnership, project management, project team composition, people issues, communications and compliance of the onsite team composition. It is also noticed that ten factors are grouped into three categories: the client side, the vendor side, and both. Conclusions: Organizations are currently undertaking or considering the offshoring ERP implementation particularly from India. This paper will enable them to understand the possible challenges and areas of offshoring the ERP implementation program. The value and originality of the paper comes from the fact that up to now, ERP implementation in offshoring has not been comprehensively explored. This research provides a complete understanding of the critical success factors from the client, the vendor or both the client and the vendor perspective. It also enables researchers to analyse ili rethink ili review offshoring in different service areas.\n\nDo You Need ERP?

The main assumption of the work is that the management of the selection of an ERP system should consider that the most important selection criteria are concerned with the functionality of the ERP system. Besides this, the aspects of total cost of ownership, technical support and implementation time or vendor experience are taken into consideration to guarantee a successful ERP implementation. The proposed procedure of an ERP system selection is dedicated for small and medium manufacturing enterprises. A structure of attributes for the AHP method is proposed on the basis of an analysis and identification of critical success factors. Different kinds of production (make-to-stock, make-to-order and engineer-to-order are taken into consideration.
