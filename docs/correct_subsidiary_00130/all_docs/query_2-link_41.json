Ready to join a mission that matters?\n\neCommerce • Fintech • Hardware • Payments • Software • Financial Services\n\n15 Offices\n\n12,000 Employees\n\nSince we opened our doors in 2009, the world of commerce has evolved immensely, and so has Square. After enabling anyone to take payments and never miss a sale, we saw sellers stymied by disparate, outmoded products and tools that wouldn’t work together. So we expanded into software and started building integrated, omnichannel solutions – to help sellers sell online, manage inventory, offer buy now, pay later functionality through Afterpay, book appointments, engage loyal buyers, and hire and pay staff. Across it all, we’ve embedded financial services tools at the point of sale, so merchants can access a business loan and manage their cash flow in one place. Afterpay furthers our goal to provide omnichannel tools that unlock meaningful value and growth, enabling sellers to capture the next generation shopper, increase order sizes, and compete at a larger scale. Today, we are a partner to sellers of all sizes – large, enterprise-scale businesses with complex operations, sellers just starting, as well as merchants who began selling with Square and have grown larger over time. As our sellers grow, so do our solutions. There is a massive opportunity in front of us. We’re building a significant, meaningful, and lasting business, and we are helping sellers worldwide do the same.\n\nArtificial Intelligence • Cloud • HR Tech • Information Technology • Productivity • Software • Automation\n\n42 Offices\n\n20,000 Employees\n\nAt ServiceNow, our technology makes the world work for everyone, and our people make it possible.

As a result, we go beyond current industry practices for sourcing, use recycled precious metals to minimize our environmental footprint, and support environmental and social causes through our giving back initiatives. Or Mission is to cultivate a more transparent, sustainable, compassionate, and inclusive jewelry industry. Our Mission and ESG Goals are underpinned by our foundational pillars: We believe that demonstrating transparency, through ethical business practices and governance, and enforcing rigorous protocols for sourcing environmentally and socially responsible materials are key to driving change in our industry. Our products are designed to be loved for generations, and we seek to reduce our environmental footprint by keeping our jewelry circular and embedding environmental sustainability throughout our operations and value chain. We seek ways to create lasting impact, not just in our own value chain and customer communities but also across artisanal small scale mining communities where gemstones and precious metals are sourced. We are committed to creating a representative jewelry industry through our unique products and inclusive experiences for customers, and through a company culture that emphasizes equitable recruiting practices and invests in our diverse employee base.\n\neCommerce • Database\n\nSwansea, Illinois, USA\n\n249 Employees\n\nOneSpace is the only platform designed to help brands achieve the perfect digital shelf.
