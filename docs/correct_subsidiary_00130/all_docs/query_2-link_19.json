        "text": "Designed for use with a Crestron® V-Panel® HD Touch Screen Display[1,2], the DGE-2 Digital Graphics Engine allows for a very streamlined touch screen installation by placing the bulk of the electronics out of sight at the central equipment location. Mounted within an equipment rack, the DGE-2 connects directly to the head end AV sources, switchers, and control network, while the touch screen display can be up to 300 feet (91 meters) away with just a single cable between them[3].\n\nThe DGE-2 delivers the ultimate touch screen experience with advanced high-definition Smart Graphics™, dual-window HD video, high-performance H.264 streaming video, Rava® SIP Intercom[4], audio feedback, and built-in annotation. Extensive connectivity is provided for displaying HD video from external AV and computer sources via HDMI®, DigitalMedia™, Ethernet, and various analog connections. Support for HDCP ensures compatibility with today's digital sources!\n\nSmart Graphics™\n\nCrestron touch screens use Smart Graphics to deliver the ultimate user experience and the ultimate value by enabling the creation of dynamically rich user interfaces with incredible efficiency and unparalleled functionality. Using Smart Graphics, programmers can swiftly integrate fluid gesture-driven controls, animated feedback, rich metadata, embedded apps and widgets, and full-motion video for a deeply engaging and ultra-intuitive touch screen experience.\n\nCrestron Smart Graphics offers these enhancements and more:\n\nCool-looking graphical buttons, sliders, knobs, and gauges that are intuitive and fun to use\n\nKinetic effects to enhance the feeling of realism, with lists and toolbars that scroll with momentum at the flick of a fingertip\n\nDrag-and-drop objects that snap into place, offering an easy way to switch sources\n\nDashboard widgets to personalize the touch screen with clocks, weather, news, and other information\n\nCustomizable themes allowing a completely different look and feel for every user, event, or season\n\nFully-developed SmartObjects® that enable sophisticated control over complex devices with minimal programming\n\nHD Streaming Video\n\nHigh-definition streaming video capability makes it possible to view security cameras and other video sources over the network right on the touch screen. Native support for H.264 and MJPEG formats allows the DGE-2 to display live streaming video from an IP camera, a streaming server (Crestron CEN-NVS200, DM-TXRX-100-STR, or similar[1]), or a DigitalMedia switcher.\n\nHDMI® and Analog Video\n\nIn addition to handling streaming video, the DGE-2 also provides extensive connectivity for more conventional types of sources including HDMI. The DGE-2 can simultaneously generate two fully-scalable, full-motion video windows, each supporting SD or HD video and high-resolution computer signals from external digital and analog sources.\n\nInput connections include two HDMI, two RGB, and two multi-format analog video. The HDMI inputs support digital HD sources including HDMI, DVI, and DisplayPort Multimode[5]. The RGB inputs handle high-resolution analog VGA computer sources, and the multi-format video inputs accept analog composite, S-Video, and component HD video sources. External audio signals are handled by the HDMI inputs, and by a single analog line input.\n\nHDCP Support\n\nIndustry-leading support for HDCP (High-bandwidth Digital Content Protection) ensures seamless compatibility with content-protected DVD, Blu-ray Disc®, digital HDTV, and multimedia computer sources.\n\nRava® SIP Intercom[4]\n\nRava SIP Intercom Technology enables VoIP communication with other Rava-enabled touch screens and door stations. Rava works over Ethernet, supporting 2-way intercom, video intercom[6], and paging without requiring any special wiring. VoIP phone capability is also possible through integration with an SIP-compatible IP phone system or SIP server.\n\nThe DGE-2 also supports legacy Crestron IP Intercom and Crestron Home® (CH) CAT5 wired intercom. Crestron IP Intercom enables compatibility with older Crestron touch screens that do not support Rava. CH CAT5 wired intercom provides compatibility with the C2N-IADS30X24[1] and other CH CAT5 based switchers and processors.\n\nKeyboard/Mouse Options\n\nOn-screen keyboard and mouse capabilities enable complete control of the DGE-2's embedded Web browser and other applications, and can also be used to control computers running TouchPoint® Virtual Mouse & Keyboard Software (VMK-WIN). USB ports are also provided on the front and rear of the DGE-2, and on some V-Panel displays[1], allowing for the connection of a physical keyboard and mouse.\n\nReal-Time Annotation\n\nWhether conducting a high-level boardroom meeting, training seminar, or watching sports in your home theater, annotation helps put the fine point on any presentation. Native to the DGE-2, annotation provides the ability to illustrate your thoughts on-the-fly, letting you draw and write over high-definition video and computer images, and sketch out ideas on a whiteboard screen, without leaving the podium or your favorite chair while other viewers watch on the big screen.\n\nRemote Annotation\n\nRemote annotation capability allows multiple touch screen users to draw with their fingertips over the same video image or whiteboard screen, enabling enhanced interaction between several participants in a courtroom, classroom, or council chamber.\n\nPresentation Output\n\nThrough its HDMI output, or via a DigitalMedia system, the DGE-2 allows the touch screen image to be sent to additional display devices, allowing videos, PowerPoint presentations, annotation, and other on-screen media to be shared with a live audience.\n\nDigitalMedia™\n\nDigitalMedia (DM®) connectivity opens up new ways to configure a touch screen control system. For instance, using a DM switcher such as the DM-MD8X8[1], multiple touch screens can be connected to a single DGE-2, providing a simple, cost-effective way for multiple participants to view and control the same graphical interface. DigitalMedia also provides a versatile means for distributing touch screen content to a larger audience, routing the DGE-2's DM output to feed additional video displays and sound equipment.\n\nV-Panel Connectivity\n\nThe DGE-2 features a DM CAT type output, supporting the direct connection to a V-Panel touch screen model V12 or V15[1]. It can also connect to any DM switcher equipped with a DM CAT input. A single DigitalMedia cable carries all video, audio, Ethernet, USB, control, and power signals up to 300 ft (91 m) between the V-Panel and DGE-2.[2,3]\n\nThe DGE-2 is also compatible with the V24R-C series of V-Panel 24\" HD Touch Screen Displays[1]. A DigitalMedia 8G+® transmitter (DM-TX-201-C or equivalent)[1] provides the interface between the DGE-2's HDMI output and the DM 8G+® input of a V24R-C. Alternately, when feeding a V24R-C display through a DM switcher, the DM 8G+ transmitter is not required."
