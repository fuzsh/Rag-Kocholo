IBM plans to announce the technology, which was co-developed by another mathematician at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH), Monday at a conference called Crypto '98 in Santa Barbara, Calif. Dubbed the Cramer-Shoup cryptosystem after the two men who invented it -- Victor Shoup of IBM Research and Ronald Cramer of ETH -- the technology prevents so-called \"active attacks\" that hackers use to break into encrypted communications, IBM said in a statement. Though active attacks are very complicated to undertake (a hacker must send nearly a million messages written in a particular way to a system), last year a researcher at Bell Labs Technologies found that such an active attack could be used to decode information encrypted with the popular Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology. That discovery caused an uproar this past June among software vendors who use the product, while SSL-creator RSA Data Security rushed to fix the problem. Most commercially available public-key encryption systems today use a set of complex mathematical problems that are thought to be unsolvable, according to IBM. However, hackers using so-called active attacks bypass the need to solve these problems by sending cleverly constructed messages to a server that force this server to respond in ways that leaks encrypted information. The Cramer-Shoup system eliminates the possibility of active attacks by adding an additional set of complicated mathematical calculations to ensure that the server leaks no information when responding to the bogus messages, IBM said. While IBM plans to use the Cramer-Shoup solution in upcoming versions of its Vault Registry software, it also plans to make the discovery available to the general public via the Internet. IBM's idea is to get everyone using the new technology in order to make Internet commerce more secure and widely accepted, the company said. \"Businesses and consumers can have greater confidence in Internet transactions because we've effectively closed down the only way around a cyrptosystem's main line of defense,\" said Jeff Jaffe, general manager of IBM's security products division, in a statement.

IBM will deliver a beta of the AS/400 port in November and also will offer it for free through the Apache Project, keeping true to the product's open-source roots, the company announced Wednesday at ApacheCon, in San Francisco. AS/400, which has a giant installed base, has been \"Web-server-challenged\" in the past, according to analysts. Nigel Beck, program director of market management at IBM, said this announcement offers AS/400 users an alternative to Netscape's application server. The company also announced enhancements to the Apache-based HTTP services in its WebSphere line, including 128-bit Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption for financial transactions and other sensitive data. As for speed, IBM will be adding a new internally developed caching technology that the company claims doubles the speed of HTTP services in WebSphere on Microsoft Windows NT. The Fast Response Cache Accelerator (FRCA) will run in Apache's kernel, making it faster and more reliable, Beck said. Both technologies will ship with the next version of Websphere Application Server due by year's end, Beck said. FRCA also will be included in the HTTP Server for OS/390 Version 2 Release 7, expected in March. IBM Corp., in Armonk, N.Y., is at www.ibm.com. The Apache Project is at www.apache.org.

Microsoft officials said they have no plans to port COM+, the next version of its Component Object Model (COM), to Unix. That means the much-touted COM+ system services, key to NT 5.0, will not be available on other platforms. \"We have no plans for COM+ on Unix at this time,\" Joe Maloney, platform marketing group manager at Microsoft, said last week at the Professional Developers Conference, in Denver. \"We haven't ported Microsoft Transaction Server [MTS] to Unix [and MTS is part of COM+]. The interoperability is there with COM.\" The results are multiple Microsoft bridging strategies that fall short of the pure interoperability that has been promised by rivals. \"That leaves them with a positioning where interoperability is primarily through bridges,\" said Phil Costa, an analyst at the Giga Information Group, in Cambridge, Mass. \"It would be hard to say they are an interoperability vendor. I would say that stretches 'interoperability.'\" Robert De Cardenas, a systems network coordinator who runs an NT-Novell-Unix shop at the Florida State Supreme Court in Tallahassee, said his interoperability comes from his Novell software. \"They are probably only skin deep as far as interoperability goes,\" De Cardenas said of Microsoft. \"But even though our interop is not as full and rich as I would like it to be, I guess I'm glad it's there on some level to begin with.\" Microsoft's argument is that the alternatives -- CORBA and Enterprise JavaBeans -- make up a splintered camp that is unable to offer the universality of Windows, Maloney said. Officials at Iona Technologies, a leading maker of COM-CORBA bridges, stated that Microsoft's middleware integration services are primarily designed to integrate within the Windows and COM sphere of influence. \"[Microsoft doesn't] have any plans to port their stuff, it's still proprietary. They will not make the services available on other platforms. So that's where CORBA comes in, and that's why we are trying to make our services interoperate with theirs,\" said Lean Doody, product manager for Iona's OrbixComet, a COM-CORBA bridge. Iona plans to update OrbixComet within a few months of the release of NT 5.0, sometime in 1999, so that it will support COM+ and MTS. Both COM and COM+ should bridge seamlessly because they are both based on the Distributed COM wire protocol, Doody said. Microsoft's interoperability arsenal comprises an expensive effort to port COM to Sun Solaris; third-party COM-CORBA bridges; Extensible Markup Language support in NT 5.0; OLE DB and ODBC; and Microsoft Services for Unix, due out this month. \"Microsoft supplies only as much interoperability as they need to keep NT a viable solution,\" said Anne Thomas, an analyst at the Patricia Seybold Group, in Boston.

[It seems to already be available for download on their website. --Gary] Version 4.5's features are no surprise to Communicator users. In addition to two public betas of Version 4.5, Communicator users have also had the opportunity to sample new search and navigation features, which Netscape categorized under the term \"smart browsing.\" These were included in the 4.06 and 4.07 releases. The other key changes in Version 4.5 are geared at users who access the Internet from different computers, for example corporate users who also use the Net from home. Also included in the final 4.5 release are fixes for privacy holes that revealed users' browsing history, cache, and other private information. 4.07 was released to fix the bug, but another bug soon surfaced. Version 4.5 will plug both those holes, according to Communicator senior product manager Micki Seibel. With smart browsing, the user can type search keywords into the address bar of the browser. Those keyword searches resolve to directory or search results pages on Netscape's Netcenter portal site. This feature has caused some controversy among Web site owners whose addresses were generic names, like \"scripting.com,\" since previous versions of the browser would resolve single word queries to their .com, .org, or .net equivalents, according to users' preferences. Netscape has pointed out that users can disable the keyword function in Navigator 4.06 and higher under the \"Preferences\" menu. Another smart browsing feature, provided in conjunction with Alexa Internet, offers a list of related sites wherever the user surfs. Netscape has refined both the keyword and the \"What's Related\" databases during the beta period, partially with the aid of user feedback, according to Seibel. Some users have found that \"What's Related\" can produce unlikely recommendations. The third component of smart browsing is support for Web ratings used to block certain sites for child, student, library, or corporate users. The roaming features have largely to do with Communicator's Messenger email component, and the Collabra newsgroup component that has been folded into Messenger. Messenger now supports the IMAP messaging protocol, which provides faster performance, allows users to download attachments on demand, and lets users work with email offline and synchronize changes between the client and the server the next time they log on. Support for the LDAP protocol means users can have fuller access to LDAP-based address books and directories. While Communicator has offered autocomplete for email addresses since Version 4.0, Version 4.5 will autocomplete against any LDAP-based directory, such as those maintained by 411.com and WhoWhere. LDAP support will also let users change their address book offline and have it sychronized with the server when they log on again. Support for another Internet standard, the Message Disposition Notification protocol, will let users obtain confirmation that messages they send have been received and opened. A number of proprietary and mutually incompatible notification systems exist already, Seibel said, and MDN is backward-compatible with them. Messenger's interface has been redone. A three-pane design offers folders, message headers, and the message body at once. Email searching and filtering have been expanded so users can search or filter on multiple criteria, such as \"sender\" and \"subject.\" Communicator 4.5 bundles Macromedia's Flash animation player, Real's G2 streaming multimedia player, and Headspace's Beatnik sound effects software. Seibel said Version 4.5's beta period was the most productive yet for the company's browser team. \"We introduced a quality feedback system,\" Seibel said. \"If the product crashed, a window would pop up asking the user to file an incident report telling us what functions were being used, what operating system they were on, etcetera. It not only increased the amount of information we got, and the quality of that information, but the speed with which we were able to address problems.\" As a result of the new beta process, Netscape implemented more than 4,000 customer suggestions, Seibel said, including bug fixes, performance enhancements, and feature requests. Netscape has been fielding feature requests of a different sort in another part of its Internet software business, the Mozilla.org operation. Early this year, Netscape began the process of revealing Communicator's source code for the worldwide community of independent developers to work with. While Mozilla.org has been managing the open source development effort, Netscape has been picking and choosing from developer contributions for its own branded product that will be Communicator 5.0. A beta version of Version 5.0, expected by year's end, is on track, Seibel said. All these efforts come as Netscape reduces its reliance on the browser business to focus on its portal site and its enterprise software. Netscape, once dominant in the browser market, has watched its market share steadily erode to Microsoft's Internet Explorer browser. Recent studies have showed that while Navigator is strong in the important corporate market, it has slipped overall. One from Zona Research showed Navigator maintaining a 20-percentage point lead over IE in the office. A study from International Data Corporation, showed Navigator's marketshare slipping overall, but maintaining its lead in the medium- and large-sized business market.\n\n>From MAILER-DAEMON@cs.depaul.edu Mon Oct 19 11:09:39 1998 MIME-Version: 1.0 Resent-Date: Mon, 19 Oct 1998 10:48:52 -0500 X-Sender: gary@lance.cs.depaul.edu Date: Mon, 19 Oct 1998 10:48:52 -0500 To: compnews@gbw.cs.depaul.edu From: Gary Weinstein Subject: Lucent to use Novell software Sender: compnews-request@gbw.cs.depaul.edu Resent-From: compnews@gbw.cs.depaul.edu X-Unsub: To leave, send text 'LEAVE' to Lucent to use Novell software By Erich Luening Staff Writer, CNET News.com October 19, 1998, 7:05 a.m. PT update Lucent Technologies today will announce that it has agreed to use Novell's directory software in hardware that helps to manage voice and data traffic in corporate networks, a company spokesman said. This would be a boost for Novell in its fight with Microsoft, according to observers. Microsoft is pushing its own directory services software, called Active Directory, expected to be part of the forthcoming Windows NT 5.0. Lucent said it plans to integrate Novell's directory services (NDS) into its corporate networking switch Cajun P550, which will be available the first half of next year. Lucent and Novell also agreed to collaborate in seeking industry-wide technical standards for building networks using products from different companies, the spokesman said. Directory software is growing in importance as the Internet accelerates the use of electronic commerce.

Available now in beta form, with shipping to begin in mid-November, the latest Visual Cafe Java tools allow developers to plug in any version of the Java Development Kit (JDK) features from Sun Microsystems, from 1.1 through 1.2, which is due in late November, said Symantec representatives, in Cupertino, Calif. Separately, Symantec is slated to deliver its comprehensive Enterprise Suite of Java tools by year's end. Visual Cafe 3.0, which ships with JDK 1.17, is aimed at broadening server-side Java development by offering server-side debugging and remote server debugging, as well as projecting the visible connection between components for drag-and-drop interactions. Visual Cafe 3.0 also supports the new JFC/Swing classes. By complying to the JFC/Swing data model, JFC/Swing components are data-aware, eliminating the need for \"dbaware\" components, Symantec representatives said. The latest tools also build model, border, and icon beans, and provide WYSIWYG support for Java Foundation Classes (JFCs) in the tools' form designer. Full support for JtabbedPane is also offered, as is support for any standard Java Database Connectivity driver for broad database connectivity, Symantec said. Moreover, the updated Java tools also include an upgraded JIT compiler from Symantec, Version 3.1, which promotes faster start-up time for applications, representatives said. All available for Windows 95, Windows 98, and Windows NT, Visual Cafe Database Edition will sell for $800, Visual Cafe Professional Edition for $300, and Visual Cafe Standard Edition for $100.

Wall was honored for \"his many contributions to the advancement of freely distributed software,\" according to the Free Software Foundation. The award was granted on October 9 in at Masschusetts Institute of Technology. Wall's most well-known product is Perl, a powerful scripting language used by system administrators and web developers for sophisticated text manipulation, system management and active Web pages. There are about one million Perl programmers worldwide, with a core of more than 450 on the Perl porters mailing list, who are most active in its development and maintenance. Wall, Senior Software Developer at O'Reilly & Associates, also won the award for creating rn, a widely-used news reader; patch, a development and distribution tool; metaconfig, which writes Configure scripts; and the Warp space-war game. In granting the award, the Free Software Foundation said, \"Larry Wall has always promoted keeping his implementations free for all to study, enhance, and build on, without restrictions, and the freedom for all to benefit in whatever ways they can from his products.\" They called Perl \"a tool that takes the UNIX ideas of flexibility and portability further than almost any program before it.\" Tim O'Reilly, founder and CEO, O'Reilly & Associates, stated: Larry's influence on modern computing goes well beyond Perl. The Internet, and in fact much of the innovation that is driving the current boom in Silicon Valley and Redmond, largely grew out of an academic and research community in which the sharing of source code, and the ability to build on the work of your peers, was taken for granted. Larry's patch program allowed people to share modifications to existing programs and to merge divergent source trees, encouraging a style of distributed software development that has proven to be the most powerful methodology available. Similarly, Larry's idiosyncratic Perl language turned out to be a key enabler for the explosion of active content on the World Wide Web. While industry hype focussed on Java and ActiveX, Perl quietly stole the market, becoming a key component of the next generation \"information applications\" at Yahoo, Amazon.com, and tens of thousands of other leading sites. Wall has won other honors, including the Dr. Dobb's 1996 Excellence in Programming Award, and the SAGE (System Administrators Guild) 1994 Outstanding Achievement Award. Perl won the WebTechniques/WebReview 1997 Editor's Choice Award for Scripting Language. Wall has received wide coverage in the press, including in Salon and Dr. Dobb's Journal. The Free Software Foundation awards committee members are Peter Salus (Chairman), Scott Christley, Rich Morin, Adam Richter, Richard Stallman, and Vernor Vinge.\n\n>From MAILER-DAEMON@cs.depaul.edu Thu Oct 22 09:01:38 1998 MIME-Version: 1.0 Resent-Date: Thu, 22 Oct 1998 09:07:04 -0500 X-Sender: gary@lance.cs.depaul.edu Date: Thu, 22 Oct 1998 09:07:04 -0500 To: compnews@gbw.cs.depaul.edu From: Gary Weinstein Subject: Sun to bundle NetDynamics app server with Solaris Sender: compnews-request@gbw.cs.depaul.edu Resent-From: compnews@gbw.cs.depaul.edu X-Unsub: To leave, send text 'LEAVE' to Sun to bundle NetDynamics app server with Solaris By Dana Gardner InfoWorld Electric Posted at 4:07 PM PT, Oct 21, 1998 Borrowing a few ideas from Netscape Communications and Microsoft, Sun Microsystems laid out a strategy Wednesday that emphasizes the concept of building enterprise Web portals aided by tightening integration between its new NetDynamics application server with its flagship server operating system, Solaris. Like Microsoft, which sees little distinction between its Windows NT Server operating system and the services that amount to an application server, Sun -- beginning immediately -- will offer add-on bundle deals that put its recently acquired NetDymanics Server on Solaris -- and at a 20 percent discount. Unlike Microsoft, however, Sun will price its popular Unix operating system separately from its application server \"forever,\" said Alan Baratz, president of Sun's Java Software division in a conference call to journalists and analysts Wednesday. \"Sun will ensure that Solaris is competitive, with the functions needed to be successful, and application server capability is a part of that,\" Baratz said. With the news of the bundles, Sun appears to be walking a tricky line between emulating Microsoft's direct OS-to-app server integration but also being mindful that many other application server vendors have ported their competing server wares to the Solaris platform. Sun is also the license owner and driving force behind the Java and Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB) efforts, which many application server vendors -- including Oracle, IBM, Netscape, and BEA -- subscribe to and support. Sun is seeking to maintain a \"church/state\" separation between Java development and other Sun product development by keeping them as separate divisions within the overall corporation. As an offering of its cross-platform intentions, Sun emphasized that the NetDynamics server -- which will emerge in a major upgrade version early next year with EJB 1.0 support -- also runs on Windows NT, HP-UX, IBM AIX, and SGI Irix, according to Zack Rinat, vice president of NetDynamics at Java Software. The server will be optimized for all those platforms -- including Solaris, Rinat said, adding that variants of Unix tend to scale higher than Windows NT. To better compete with IBM CICS and BEA's Tuxedo, Sun also announced Wednesday that it will license Inprise's VisiBroker Integrated Transaction Service, an object-oriented transaction processing monitor. Already, NetDynamics includes Inprise's VisiBroker object request broker. In the future, NetDynamics plans to integrate the object transaction monitor capabilities into its offerings, the company said. Lastly, in banter reminiscent of Netscape's portal-as-enterprise-services-hub marketing, Baratz laid out a portal vision that uses Sun's family of products to help companies create a federation of Web sites. Such sites would be centrally and seamlessly linked so that its employees and partners could quickly and easily get to the applications and information they need -- regardless of where they are and regardless of where the information originates or resides. \"Portals are becoming the core of the enterprise computing environment. That's what it's all about,\" Baratz said. \"At Sun, we are building an employee portal, so that with a browser I can access a site that gives me e-mail, calendaring, news of the day, access to Web-based content on products, and pricing -- but all browser-based on the front end and linking into an installed base.\" \"It's a portal for Sun Microsystems. And I can access it from my PC at home, at an airport kiosk, a customer site -- anywhere there's the Internet,\" Baratz said. Consequently, Sun is assembling an integrated core family of products -- including sundry Java IDE tools, NetDynamics Studio, Java Web Server, Java Embedded Server, Sun Messaging Server, Solaris, and NetDynamics -- to allow enterprises to build their own portals. Calling it \"the most complete software in the enterprise,\" Sun is positioning \"NetDynamics as the power behind the portal, and the portal is emerging as the new enterprise software model,\" Baratz said. \"NetDynamics is the overarching brand for all these products, and the focus is on the vision of Internet-based computing,\" Rinat said. \"Java is an enabling technology and NetDynamics will be the platform for integrating.\" Sun Microsystems Inc., in Mountain View, Calif., is at www.sun.com.

Also last week, HP helped to form a breakaway group of 13 vendors seeking to establish specifications for Java in real-time, embedded systems. HP General Manager of Embedded Software Jim Bell said the Real-time Java Working Group will establish its own standards process and select a standards body to supervise its effort. At the end of the week, the group was leaning toward the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineering or The Open Group, representatives said. The moves were seen as the most serious blow yet to Sun's efforts to control all aspects of the Java development platform. \"HP, in essence, is staging a call to arms for an open, vendor-neutral Java standard,\" said Ron Rappaport, an industry analyst at Zona Research Inc. HP's Bell said HP's breach with Sun concerned only embedded-system Java, in which HP has a huge business stake. HP's server-side business remained \"an enthusiastic Java licensee,\" he said. The members of the Real-time Java Working Group include Access Co. Ltd., Aonix, AverStar Inc., Cyberonix, Enea OSE Systems AB, Lynx Real-Time Systems Inc., Microsoft, Omron Corp., Siemens AG, TeleMedia Devices Inc., SOMA MarketNet for NewMonics and Yokogawa Electric Corp. Members of the group did not see themselves as fostering a split with Sun. Writing extensions to Java that could be used for real-time, embedded systems has been \"a hole that needed to be filled,\" and real-time software makers and operating systems vendors want to do the work, said Ron Kole, vice president at AverStar Inc., a real-time tools vendor. But Rappaport was not sure the dispute could be tidied up so neatly. \"Once you let the animal loose, it's hard to restrict it for your intended purpose,\" he said. Unless HP puts strict conditions on its licenses, its licensees could use the Chai virtual machine on servers as well as in embedded devices, Rappaport said. HP is making a Chai Developer Kit, sample applets that it has dubbed Chailets and the ChaiServer available for free download from its Web site at www.chai.hp.com. The ChaiServer would control the running and distribution of Chai applications on a server for embedded devices. Despite HP's moves, Sun President of Consumer and Embedded Systems Mark Tolliver said the breach with HP may yet be healed. He said Sun was modifying its process for extending its Embedded Java to allow nonlicensees, such as HP, to participate. \"It's now open to anyone who can send a technically qualified representative,\" Tolliver said. Sun has indicated over the past three months on its Web site that it would lift the licensees-only restriction. It plans to post an explanation of the new process by mid-November. But HP has persistently criticized Sun for keeping the Java standard-setting process under its control. By posting its Chai code to a royalty-free Web site and \"taking actions that it believes a proponent of open standards must take, it was primed for the next move that may well extend beyond the embedded systems market,\" Rappaport said.\n\n>From MAILER-DAEMON@cs.depaul.edu Wed Nov 11 09:05:00 1998 MIME-Version: 1.0 Resent-Date: Wed, 11 Nov 1998 09:09:06 -0600 X-Sender: gary@lance.cs.depaul.edu Date: Wed, 11 Nov 1998 09:09:06 -0600 To: compnews@gbw.cs.depaul.edu, web@daphnis.cs.depaul.edu From: Gary Weinstein Subject: Netscape unveils next-generation client technology Sender: compnews-request@gbw.cs.depaul.edu Resent-From: compnews@gbw.cs.depaul.edu X-Unsub: To leave, send text 'LEAVE' to Netscape unveils next-generation client technology By Emily Fitzloff InfoWorld Electric Posted at 2:20 PM PT, Nov 10, 1998 Netscape on Tuesday took the wraps off of its next-generation technology -- code-named NGT -- designed to facilitate the development of smaller, faster, and more modular applications for multiple computing platforms and devices. NGT will be the foundation for any and all Netscape client products after Communicator 4.5, according to the company. At the core of NGT is a browser layout engine that interprets data from Internet sites and displays the content on a user's screen much quicker than current browser products, according to Chris Saito, director of client product marketing at Netscape. According to Saito, NGT will have four major benefits for users: extensive support for standards including HTML 4.0, Cascading Style Sheets (CSS1 and CSS2), Document Object Model (DOM), Resource Description Framework (RDF), and Extensible Markup Language (XML); modularity and a small footprint for easy download and install in multiple environments including handheld devices; table layout speed four to five times faster than that of Communicator 4.5 and competitive products; and open-source code that was developed in conjunction with Mozilla.org. One analyst said NGT is important in keeping Netscape in the browser game with Microsoft. In addition to the broad standards support, the open source angle is also a strong competitive point, according to Michael Goulde, an analyst at the Patricia Seybold Group, in Boston. \"Can open source produce better/faster/more functional code than Microsoft programmers? This will be an important test,\" Goulde said. NGT will also enable users to build platform-independent application user interfaces using Web standards. Netscape plans to release more specific details regarding product plans for NGT before the end of the year. Developers can access source code for NGT technologies and contribute to its direction, development, and testing via the Mozilla.org Web site.

According to Microsoft, the software kit, which will cost $149 when it is released in four to six weeks, will focus on four areas. Resource sharing will allow NT Workstation users to reach into Unix systems to get files and Unix workstation users to access NT Server files. Remote administration will let users remotely log on to and work on NT- and Unix-based systems. Password synchronization will enable users to keep a common password for their NT and Unix machines, and make password changes on NT that will be automatically synchronized on their Unix systems. Common scripting across platforms will enable users to execute Unix commands and utilities in NT environments. To build the software, which was first announced in May, Microsoft called on two key partners for help, Intergraph and Mortice Kern Systems (MKS). Intergraph provided Network File System (NFS) client/server software for the add-on pack's resource-sharing functionality. From MKS, Microsoft licensed 25 Unix scripting commands, including KornShell, for the add-on pack. MKS also updated its Unix interoperability toolkit with the MKS Toolkit Update Edition, to focus on the NT Services for Unix Add-On Pack.

U.S. District Judge Ronald Whyte said Sun was \"likely to prevail on the merits\" of its lawsuit over the Java programming language and issued a preliminary injunction that would bar Microsoft from selling products that use the technology. Whyte's order bars the sale of any Microsoft products that use Java -- including Windows 98 and the Internet Explorer 4.0 browser -- beginning in 90 days unless Microsoft modifies the software to comply with Sun compatibility tests. The order does not affect software that already has been shipped. For Sun, one of Microsoft's fiercest rivals, the ruling was a sweet victory in the battle over control of Java, an increasingly popular platform for software developers that once was seen as a threat to the hegemony of Windows on the computer desktop. While the highly technical lawsuit has taken a back seat to the landmark antitrust case against Microsoft unfolding in Washington, D.C., the ruling could reinvigorate Sun's efforts to promote Java for developers to write software that runs on a variety of systems and not just Windows. And government lawyers, who have called a Sun vice president to testify in the antitrust case, contend Microsoft's efforts to undermine Java are part of a pattern of anti-competitive behavior. Alan Baratz, president of Sun's Java Software unit, said the company would continue to deliver products \"that give developers and users the choice to replace Microsoft's polluted technology with Sun's compatible Java technology.\" Sun sued Microsoft in 1997 charging that the Redmond, Wash.-based software company violated its 1996 agreement to license Java by introducing variants in its own software and developer tools that failed to meet Sun's compatibility tests. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---- \"We believe Sun's legal strategy is shortsighted and is trying to deny customers and developers the choice of the best Java implementation in the marketplace.\" -- Jim Cullinan Microsoft ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---- Sun contended Microsoft was intentionally trying to undermine Java's vaunted \"write once, run anywhere\" promise by establishing conflicting versions of the language and forcing developers to make a choice. In a cry that echoed its defense against antitrust charges, Microsoft contended Sun was trying to prevent \"innovation\" and said even Sun's own implementation of the technology failed to meet compatibility requirements. Microsoft spokesman Jim Cullinan said the company was disappointed by the ruling but would \"take the necessary steps to comply.\" \"We believe Sun's legal strategy is shortsighted and is trying to deny customers and developers the choice of the best Java implementation in the marketplace,\" Cullinan said.\n\n>From MAILER-DAEMON@cs.depaul.edu Wed Nov 18 09:29:18 1998 MIME-Version: 1.0 Resent-Date: Wed, 18 Nov 1998 09:31:55 -0600 X-Sender: gary@lance.cs.depaul.edu Date: Wed, 18 Nov 1998 09:31:55 -0600 To: compnews@gbw.cs.depaul.edu, jdp@daphnis.cs.depaul.edu From: Gary Weinstein Subject: Microsoft may follow own path on Java Sender: compnews-request@gbw.cs.depaul.edu Resent-From: compnews@gbw.cs.depaul.edu X-Unsub: To leave, send text 'LEAVE' to Microsoft may follow own path on Java By Michael Moeller, PC Week Online November 17, 1998 7:17 PM PT In the wake of Tuesday's ruling forcing Microsoft Corp. to ship Sun Microsystem Inc.'s version of Java in Windows 98, Internet Explorer and its development tools, the big question now is what happens next. The preliminary injunction, a major blow to Microsoft (Nasdaq:MSFT), states that Microsoft has 90 days to change any product that ships with Java technologies so that it will conform with and pass Sun's Java compatibility test suite. Currently, the Microsoft products affected include Internet Explorer 4.0, Windows 98, Windows NT 4.0 and the Java development tool Visual J++ 6.0. Just how Microsoft will do that is anyone's guess, at this point. Will MS abandon Java? Paul Maritz, group vice president and general manager of the applications and tools group at Microsoft, did not dismiss two far-reaching possibilities: Cancel all support for Java in its products, or replace the Java virtual machine it licensed from Sun with a clean room version created by Microsoft. \"That is a possibility, but I would not want to comment further on that at this point,\" Maritz said during a conference call Tuesday evening, when asked if Microsoft might create its own version of Java. Microsoft has already taken steps that indicate it may not support Java going forward. In the beta of Internet Explorer 5.0, released earlier this month, Microsoft made the Java virtual machine an optional download for users. Maritz added that Microsoft has no contractual obligations to support Java, saying that these were fulfilled when it shipped IE 3.02. Sun says contract is five years However, Sun's General Counsel and Vice President Michael Morris said that Microsoft's commitment contractually to Java runs for five years. The contract was signed in the spring of 1996. Morris and Alan Baratz, Java software division president, seemed to indicate that Sun would take issue with Microsoft if it tried to use a clean room version instead of the version its has licensed from Sun. JNI the key If Microsoft opts to continue supporting Java it will need to support a key API that as been at the center of this dispute - Java Native Interface. JNI is a bridge that connects Java code that is written natively to a specific operating system with portable Java code the can run on any platform. The bridge is designed to let any application be able to tap the native code without locking the entire application into a specific environment. Microsoft has refused to support JNI to date, saying that it duplicates Microsoft's J/Direct, which is already in the operating system. Microsoft will not have to remove J/Direct, according to the order, only add support for JNI. Maritz described the effort to support JNI in its products as \"not trivial\" but that it would not have any material impact on Microsoft. An olive branch Baratz extended an olive branch towards Microsoft, saying that he hopes the ruling and events will lead it back into the fold of the Java community. He said he would be willing to help Microsoft conform to the ruling. \"I hope that they will take us up on the offer,\" said Baratz. If Microsoft were to accept Baratz's offer, Sun said that it would resume sending Microsoft the latest versions of the Java technology. Sun is due to ship the Java Development Kit 1.2 early next month, but has withheld information on it from Microsoft, due to their legal fight. Sun officials said if Microsoft agrees to remain compliant and work with the rest of the Java community, Sun will be happy to send it JDK 1.2 information. Developer warnings But Microsoft must do more than just change its Java VM. It will also need to modify its use of extensions it has made to the Java language. With the release of VJ++ 6.0 earlier this year, Microsoft include additions to the language called keywords and directives - both of which tied Java application to Windows exclusively and were the default setting within the tool. As part of the ruling, Microsoft will now have to make the creation of cross-platform Java the default setting. It also must put a warning label within the code of the tool that is activated if a developer elects to change the setting to use the Microsoft-specific extensions. The warning label is designed to tell developers that if they use the extensions, a future ruling in the case could force them to change their code. Tuesday's action stems from the filing of a breach of contract suit by Sun against Microsoft in October of last year. Sun amended that complaint in May when it asked the judge for the preliminary injunction be put in place until the trial could be heard. It is unclear when exactly the trial might begin. Legal options Saying that it is disappointed with the ruling and dismayed at Sun's use of legal tactics, Microsoft is also exploring all of its options on the legal side as well. According to Tom Burt, the company's associate general counsel, Microsoft is exploring all its legal options, and may appeal the ruling. Burt maintained that \"once all the facts are introduced in the case, we are confident that Microsoft will prevail at the trial.\"\n\n>From MAILER-DAEMON@cs.depaul.edu Thu Nov 19 09:14:28 1998 MIME-Version: 1.0 Resent-Date: Thu, 19 Nov 1998 09:17:04 -0600 X-Sender: gary@lance.cs.depaul.edu Date: Thu, 19 Nov 1998 09:17:04 -0600 To: compnews@gbw.cs.depaul.edu From: Gary Weinstein Sender: compnews-request@gbw.cs.depaul.edu Resent-From: compnews@gbw.cs.depaul.edu X-Unsub: To leave, send text 'LEAVE' to What the Java ruling really says By Deborah Gage, Sm@rtReseller November 19, 1998 10:04 AM ET The U.S. District Court handed Sun Microsystems Inc. a clear victory on Java Tuesday, despite Microsoft Corp.'s claims to the contrary, as an examination of the ruling shows. Microsoft is prevented from distributing any operating system, browser or software development tool containing any Sun-copyrighted code that does not pass Sun's Java compatibility tests. In addition to implementing Sun's JNI (Java Native Interface) -- which dictates how Java interacts with any native operating-system services -- Microsoft must make Sun Java the default language for developers using Microsoft's Visual J++ 6.0, which Microsoft began shipping in September, as well as Microsoft Software Development Kits for Java. Developers using VJ++ 6.0 must be warned that when they switch on Microsoft's keyword extensions and compiler directives, the resulting applications may not run across all Java-compatible virtual machines, according to the court's ruling. In addition, Microsoft is prevented from adding any new extensions and directives to future tools. There are other provisions as well. Microsoft is prohibited from tying its Windows logo or any licenses to exclusive use of Microsoft's virtual machine or interfaces. Microsoft cannot advertise its virtual machine as \"the official Java reference implementation,\" although it can tout performance of its virtual machine. Microsoft must comply with the judge's order within 90 days for all new products, unless it can show good cause why it can't. Although Microsoft does not have to recall existing Java-enabled products, it must provide service packs or updates over the Web or in some other fashion to bring those products into compliance. Microsoft has 15 days to tell customers how it plans to comply with the judge's order. It must also admit it violated Sun's license agreements. If Sun wins the case - Tuesday's ruling is only preliminary -- the keyword extensions and compiler directives in VJ++ 6.0 will not be permitted to be included in future tools. That would render any applications already developed with VJ++ 6.0 incompatible. Microsoft added the keyword extensions and compiler derivatives in May, after the Redmond, Wash., company lost the right to use Sun's Java logo on its product packaging. Microsoft has waged a relentless PR campaign against Java and continues to do so. Group Vice President Paul Maritz hinted Tuesday that Microsoft may do a clean-room version of Java, which Sun general counsel Mike Morris acknowledged is open to contract interpretation. Maritz also told press conference questioners that Microsoft may look into using Hewlett-Packard Co.'s Java implementation as an alternative to Sun's. In a separate announcement Wednesday, Inprise Corp. (formerly Borland International Inc.) announced it would be willing to license to Microsoft its 100-percent-compatible JBuilder Java development tools for an undisclosed amount. Inprise has partnered with both Microsoft and Sun in the course of its Java work. \"We recognize that many customers could be adversely impacted by the injunction against Microsoft and therefore we want to offer a solution that will enable Microsoft to quickly comply with the ruling from the U.S. District Court,\" said Inprise CEO Del Yocam in a prepared statement. Microsoft officials said Tuesday that the company plans to comply with the court's decision, but it did not outline Microsoft's specific technical or legal plans for moving forward. Microsoft denied that customers would be negatively impacted in any way by the provisions outlined in the ruling.

Shares of the Seattle-based RealNetworks closed at $42.87 1/2, up $1.62 1/2, in trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market. Rob Glaser, RealNetwork's chairman and founder, said Microsoft's announcement was no surprise. \"A company like Microsoft makes a decision for a million different = reasons and a million different circumstances,\" he said. \"I don't think they = needed the cash.

To comply with the court injunction, which forces Microsoft to modify all of its Java-based products to conform to Sun's standards, Microsoft will add the Java Native Interface (JNI) to several products, including Windows 98, said Jim Cullinan, a Microsoft spokesman. It will \"slipstream,\" or add code, to products as they ship within the next 90 days. The changes will have no material effect on channel partners, the spokesman said. Windows 98 incorporates Microsoft's Internet Explorer 4.0 browser, which uses an implementation of Java not approved by Sun, which developed the Internet programming language. \"It doesn't impact any retail product on the shelves,\" Cullinan said. \"We don't have to remove our technologies. We just need to add this technology [JNI] to make sure we're compatible. It won't have any impact on our delivery to consumers.\" The Microsoft Tools Group on Wednesday was expected to announce future plans for Microsoft's Java implementation. Sun filed a lawsuit against Microsoft in October 1997, charging Microsoft with trademark infringement, false advertising, breach of contract, and unfair competition related to Microsoft's unorthodox implementations of Java. In March, the court ordered Microsoft to remove all the coffee mug Java-compatible logos from products on shelves. At that time, Microsoft was required to pull about 20,000 Internet Explorer Plus boxes bearing the Java-compatible logo from shelves and \"refresh\" them with new boxes sans the logo. Windows 98 had not yet shipped at that time. Although the court ruling is deemed a major loss for Microsoft, analysts don't expect the software giant to hand over its standard-setting rights to Sun. \"Sun won the battle here, but it's not clear they can force Microsoft to adopt the Java platform,\" said Eric Brown, an analyst with Forrester Research, in Cambridge, Mass. \"There's no way Sun can put the collar on [Microsoft] and drag them across the dunes to accept Java.\" He noted Microsoft could develop a \"clean room\" version of Java on its own or refuse to endorse Sun's forthcoming Java 1.2 specification. The lawsuit focused exclusively on Microsoft's implementation of Java 1.1.\n\n>From MAILER-DAEMON@cs.depaul.edu Mon Nov 23 09:26:48 1998 MIME-Version: 1.0 Resent-Date: Mon, 23 Nov 1998 09:27:42 -0600 X-Sender: gary@lance.cs.depaul.edu Date: Mon, 23 Nov 1998 09:27:42 -0600 To: compnews@gbw.cs.depaul.edu From: Gary Weinstein Subject: America Online reportedly to buy Netscape Sender: compnews-request@gbw.cs.depaul.edu Resent-From: compnews@gbw.cs.depaul.edu X-Unsub: To leave, send text 'LEAVE' to America Online reportedly to buy Netscape By Jana Sanchez-Klein and Scott Magoon InfoWorld Electric Posted at 6:55 AM PT, Nov 23, 1998 America Online is in talks to purchase Netscape in an all-stock transaction that is said to be worth more than $4 billion, according to numerous press reports appearing over the weekend. The press reports, appearing on U.S. television, radio, and online versions of the Wall Street Journal and Newsweek, said that Sun Microsystems may also be involved in the deal. The stories quote unnamed sources said to be close to the deal. Although financial terms were not disclosed, the deal, based on the market capitalization of Netscape, would be worth at least $4 billion. But according to the Wall Street Journal, AOL will pay a premium above the market price for the Netscape stock. The leaked details include AOL taking over Netscape's Web portal, or Netcenter, as well as Netscape's popular Web browser software. Reportedly, Sun would take over the enterprise side of Netscape's business and pay AOL a fee for using Netscape technology. Netscape currently sells a number of business applications, including those used for messaging, groupware, and Internet-commerce applications. Sun, AOL, and Netscape have reportedly been in talks all week and this weekend and could reach a deal before the stock markets open in the United States on Monday morning. The deal would mean that AOL would retain the Netscape brand name and would not involve any staff layoffs, according to the reports. Netscape's president and chief executive officer, James Barksdale, has reportedly been offered a seat on AOL's board of directors as part of the deal. The deal could have far-reaching effects on the Department of Justice case against Microsoft, as well as changing the landscape of the browser wars. Netscape's exit with a bang, would also likely impact the ongoing Department of Justice antitrust suit against Microsoft, which has looked at Microsoft's alleged efforts to drive Netscape out of business.

IBM said it plans to ship a free version of DB2 for Linux when it is ready next spring. There will be no run-time charge for the database. \"This seems to be the right thing to do,\" said Jeff Jones, program manager for data-management software at IBM, in Armonk, N.Y. The version for Linux will not have the high-end features such as clustering or parallel processing. However, it will support SQL-J and include net.data, a tool for building Web applications. IBM's DB2 for Linux is in beta and is scheduled to be available by March 1999. IBM will not provide phone support for the free product. \"We will be opening up a moderated discussion group on the Web that will be open 24 hours a day,\" said Jones. According to Jones, DB2 for Linux is ideal for ISPs and educational sites. IBM VARs agreed Linux will be most popular as a Web server platform and for academic sites. \"We see extremely strong demand, especially in small businesses and especially in Web businesses,\" said Bud Braseir, president of Emerging Technology Solutions, in Denver. \"I don't have customers asking for it, but from an ISP standpoint, Linux is easier to use than any other platform, and we can access through Linux all our AS/400s and NT Servers,\" said Sean Priddy, president of Houston On-Site, in Houston. \"We believe you will see more [Linux] especially at colleges, and all the students coming out of schools -- that is what they are used to,\" he said.\n\n>From MAILER-DAEMON@cs.depaul.edu Tue Nov 24 10:32:31 1998 MIME-Version: 1.0 Resent-Date: Tue, 24 Nov 1998 10:34:15 -0600 X-Sender: gary@lance.cs.depaul.edu (Unverified) Date: Tue, 24 Nov 1998 10:34:15 -0600 To: compnews@gbw.cs.depaul.edu From: Gary Weinstein Subject: AOL buys Netscape, joins Sun in Java deal Sender: compnews-request@gbw.cs.depaul.edu Resent-From: compnews@gbw.cs.depaul.edu X-Unsub: To leave, send text 'LEAVE' to AOL buys Netscape, joins Sun in Java deal By Rebecca Sykes InfoWorld Electric Posted at 7:16 AM PT, Nov 24, 1998 America Online on Tuesday announced it will acquire Netscape in a stock-for-stock transaction worth $4.2 billion. AOL also announced a strategic alliance with Sun Microsystems, including plans to develop Internet devices using Sun's Java programming language. Under the terms of AOL's deal with Netscape, Netscape stockholders will receive 0.45 shares of AOL common stock for each share of Netscape stock, according to a statement from AOL. Jim Barksdale, Netscape's president and chief executive officer, will join AOL's board of directors after the deal closes, the statement said. Pending regulatory approval, the acquisition is expected to close in the second quarter next year, it said. AOL will continue to offer Microsoft's Internet Explorer to its AOL online customers, according to the statement. Netscape's Navigator browser is locked in battle with Explorer, and some observers had speculated that an AOL-Netscape deal could eject Explorer from AOL's offerings. AOL will also offer Netscape client software to its users, downloadable from the Web using AOL's ICQ instant messaging capability, according to AOL. AOL's deal with Sun, which is separate but related to its Netscape acquisition, encompasses a three-year development and marketing agreement, according to AOL. AOL and Sun together will develop the next version of Netscape's Navigator and Communicator software clients and AOL will use Java in its Internet-commerce offerings, the company said. AOL and Sun also will jointly develop a suite of easy-to-deploy software designed to help companies and Internet service providers engage in I-commerce, according to AOL. AOL will buy systems and services from Sun worth $500 million at list price through 2002, AOL said. For its part, AOL will receive more than $350 million in licensing, marketing, and advertising fees from Sun, AOL said. The deal could have far-reaching effects on the Department of Justice case against Microsoft, as well as changing the landscape of the browser wars. Netscape's exit with a bang would also likely impact the ongoing Department of Justice antitrust suit against Microsoft, which has looked at Microsoft's alleged efforts to drive Netscape out of business. Sources familiar with the deal reportedly said that AOL would now be in a position to get a huge amount of Internet commerce on the Web. In addition to its own 14 million subscribers, Netscape's Netcenter gets about 20 million visitors per month. Some analysts see AOL, strengthened by Netscape's technology and users, as a potential threat to Microsoft's growing I-commerce ventures. Other analysts were still sorting out the merits of the deal, however. \"From a portal perspective it makes sense. Netscape could tap AOL's installed base, one of the largest on the Web,\" said Heather Ashton, an analyst at Hurwitz Group in Framingham, Mass. \"But strategically, I'm not sure how much sense it makes.

Transarc on Dec. 1 will announce versions of its AFS Server and AFS Client for Linux. Shipment is slated for February, according to company officials. The Linux port promises interoperability between Linux and Microsoft Windows and other versions of Unix operating systems, according to Gail Koerner, manager of file systems product management at Transarc. Historically popular among academic organizations, Linux has cropped up on the product wish lists of IBM's large corporate customers, according to Koerner. \"These are worldwide commercial organizations -- large electronics firms, manufacturers, telecommunications companies, government agencies, and financial companies -- a real interesting mix for us. We decided that, at least in our customer base, there was a business to be had,\" she said. The Linux release is based on the latest version of AFS, Version 3.5, which sports improved performance, caching, backup, and scalability, according to Koerner. IBM next week will also announce that version's availability on Windows NT. The initial AFS release for Linux is certified for Red Hat's version. AFS Server for Linux is priced starting at $1,995, with the AFS Client for Linux staring at $99 per user. Server pricing for unlimited numbers of users is $6,495. AFS Server for Windows NT is also priced at $1,995. Information on AFS can be found at www.software.ibm.com. IBM Corp., in Armonk, N.Y., is at www.ibm.com.

Netscape gets marketing and support, AOL gets the brand and traffic, and Sun just bulked up its entire software lineup. Sun (SUNW) doesn't own Netscape -- or AOL's enterprise software applications, to be precise -- but it may as well. In exchange for $350 million and some guaranteed minimum revenues, Sun has the right to sell (and, going forward, co-develop) an entire line of intranet servers, commerce applications and Web browser. Throw in a commitment to support Java in the browser and support for PersonalJava, add AOL's pledge to spend $500 million over three years for Sun's service, support and hardware, and Sun comes out of the deal with a big win. \"Clearly this is a high-profile deal that is going to benefit Sun down the road,\" said Jean Bozman, software services analyst at International Data Corp. in Mountain View, Calif. AOL and Sun are also committed to supporting Java and the Java Development Kit 1.2 in the next-generation Netscape browser, Communicator 5.0. And that is not insignificant. Until now, Netscape was planning to provide only an open Java interface in its product, allowing any Java Virtual Machine to work on the client. (Netscape killed its Java development effort on the client in January.) With the partnership, Sun will now have the means to distribute Java to Windows desktops once again. The Mountain View, Calif., company also gets some say in how Java will be used inside Netscape's server software. There are also synergies between Sun's vision for Java and its fledging network-enabling software called Jini and America Online's AOL Anywhere strategy. Both companies are going to work together to use a subset of the full blown JDK -- known as PersonalJava -- as the engine for pushing an AOL client into alternative devices, such as cell phones and PDAs. The effort is also likely to renew the efforts of Sun and Netscape to build a pure Java browser -- a project that was likewise shelved by Netscape in January due to its financial problems. All that said, there are downsides to the deal for Sun, mostly having to do with product overlap. Currently, Sun markets and sells its own mail server. It has also developed its own directory system. And early this fall Sun acquired Java application server company NetDynamics Inc. All of the products overlap with similar applications created by Netscape and now to be sold and serviced by Sun. \"Sun is going to have to figure out this process, and let me tell you, it is not going to be an easy one,\" said a source at a major software developer.\n\n>From MAILER-DAEMON@cs.depaul.edu Thu Nov 26 10:34:43 1998 MIME-Version: 1.0 Resent-Date: Thu, 26 Nov 1998 10:36:16 -0600 X-Sender: gary@lance.cs.depaul.edu (Unverified) Date: Thu, 26 Nov 1998 10:36:16 -0600 To: compnews@gbw.cs.depaul.edu From: Gary Weinstein Subject: Proposal tries to contain XML chaos Sender: compnews-request@gbw.cs.depaul.edu Resent-From: compnews@gbw.cs.depaul.edu X-Unsub: To leave, send text 'LEAVE' to Proposal tries to contain XML chaos By Jeff Walsh InfoWorld Electric Posted at 4:36 PM PT, Nov 25, 1998 When the Extensible Markup Language (XML) enabled people to create their own unique data-markup tags, many industry observers feared that chaos would ensue. Several vertical industry groups rushed to solve this problem and agreed on standardized tag sets to aid information sharing. But with the recent XML Namespaces proposal moving up to a proposed recommendation in the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), the chaos that could have crippled XML's usage may be resolved. XML Namespaces enable developers to define a tag that uniquely identifies their data source at the top of an XML document. This feature will become especially important when third parties begin to aggregate content from other sources. \"One of the interesting things you can do with XML is get information from multiple data sources and put it in one document,\" said Dave Wascha, XML product manager at Microsoft, in Redmond, Wash. \"Namespaces lets you know which information came from which site.\" Microsoft provides XML Namespaces support in the beta version of Internet Explorer 5.0. Michael Goulde, a senior consultant at the Patricia Seybold Group, in Boston, said Namespaces allows for data sharing without necessitating a standardized tag set. However, one developer said collisions could still occur if two sites used the same Namespace. \"A lot of what goes on in the XML world is they push the problem down a level, but [it] still exists,\" said Dave Winer, president of Userland Software, in Palo Alto, Calif.

The core of the three-year development and marketing agreement between AOL and Sun lies in the joint development of software designed to help companies and ISPs engage in Internet commerce. But several other server products from Netscape, including its application server, e-mail server, and directory server, all overlap with product offerings from Sun, leading Netscape customers to wonder what will happen now. Industry analysts and end-users anticipate a bumpy road in the integration of Sun and Netscape's products. \"Sun has a lot of work to do to explain the relationship of how they will use [Sun's application server] NetDynamics and [Netscape's application server] Kiva,\" said Larry Perlstein, principal analyst at Dataquest, in San Jose, Calif. Another potential point of contention pertains to Netscape's commitment to support the Linux operating system -- a Sun Solaris competitor -- in future products. Apparently, no definitive product plans will be delivered until final stages of the acquisition are completed, most likely this spring. \"Until the deal goes through, customers maintain current support contracts. As far as product plans, we really need to sit down and map that out. If something is phased out, we will have a very clear migration plan for customers,\" said Lori Mirek, senior vice president of marketing at Netscape, in Moutain View, Calif. However, one end-user said the companies should have mapped out product plans while they were still sitting at the negotiating table. \"I would imagine they'll be getting a lot of phone calls saying, 'Hey, what's going to happen; which of these products will be phased out?' \" said one end-user at a government agency based in the Northeast. Sun's application server offering, based on technology it acquired from NetDynamics, is strikingly similar to Netscape's own application server software that it acquired from Kiva. The companies also have competing messaging and directory servers. However, Bill Raduchel, Sun's chief strategy officer, seemed unconcerned. Raduchel acknowledged the redundancy between the Kiva and NetDynamics servers, but said, \"We don't see them competing. We're going to integrate this stuff over time.\" Regarding the companies' mail and messaging solutions, \"Netscape's e-mail server has good stuff, and we think we have the industry's best messaging store, and we'll work to combine them,\" Raduchel said. Still, the core product focus of the deal remains with the companies' I-commerce offerings and how they can best be leveraged in the future. \"The overall vision for the three companies is the same: how to be the most successful provider of I-commerce solutions for the 21st century,\" Mirek said.

The bug only affects NT servers set to default settings with no firewall protection, a configuration rarely seen unless users are not concerned with security. So while administrators ought to be concerned, simple precautions can prevent the situation, PC Week Labs analysts said. However, on a Web page posted by \"Vitali Chkliar,\" 10 companies are listed as susceptible to the bug as of November 25. To prove the point, Chkliar has links to the companies' hacked information. Chkliar also has two ASP (Active Server Pages) applications available at the site that will expose any site under the base NT configuration without a firewall. Users only need to know a server's IP address to learn the server's group names. Given the IP address and a group name, a hacker could pull user names from the server, according to the site. Chkliar could not be reached for comment. His site contains no e-mail address or contact information and attempts to locate him have proven unsuccessful. The Web page says that \"It is also possible through lower level API to get read, write access to the registry and folders of the target computer, configured with default settings.\" Karan Khanna, lead product manager for Windows NT security at Microsoft, in Redmond, Wash., said this is not a security issue and that the function Chkliar provides on his Web page is available through a base-level API. \"What's happening is, whenever you configure a server, we tell people to lock down the server appropriately so you can control the access to server,\" Khanna said. \"In this situation, you haven't locked out the appropriate ports and haven't set the right access controls. We tell customers exactly how to lock down the systems. If you do it, this is a non-issue.\" Khanna also said the API does not allow write access, but it will allow read capabilities. \"In Service Pack 4, we have a security configuration editor which allows automatic lock-down of NT Server,\" he said. Service Pack 4 is available now from Microsoft at www.microsoft.com. (For security considerations, Chkliar's Web site and the names of the hacked companies have been omitted from this story.)\n\n>From MAILER-DAEMON@cs.depaul.edu Tue Dec 1 11:19:00 1998 MIME-Version: 1.0 Resent-Date: Tue, 01 Dec 1998 11:20:19 -0600 X-Sender: gary@lance.cs.depaul.edu Date: Tue, 01 Dec 1998 11:20:19 -0600 To: compnews@gbw.cs.depaul.edu From: Gary Weinstein Subject: HP, Sun Split Over Real-Time Java Spec Sender: compnews-request@gbw.cs.depaul.edu Resent-From: compnews@gbw.cs.depaul.edu X-Unsub: To leave, send text 'LEAVE' to HP, Sun Split Over Real-Time Java Spec (12/01/98, 10:50 a.m. ET) By Alexander Wolfe, EE Times The latest salvo in the war between Hewlett-Packard and Sun Microsystems for control of real-time Java will be fired this week, when an HP-led coalition is expected to announce it has linked up with a standards body to formally oversee its efforts toward a real-time specification. Separately, Sun is developing its own real-time Java spec, under a process that company officials said is open and takes into account feedback from both licensees and the broader Java community. The split between Sun and HP over real-time Java first came into public view last month at the Embedded Systems Conference in San Jose, Calif. There, HP and some 25 vendors officially launched their thrust under the banner of the Real-Time Java Working Group, a coalition widely referred to as the \"splinter group,\" to distinguish it from Sun's ongoing spec effort. But the embedded community isn't cleanly divided on the issue. Indeed, many Java vendors are keeping a foot in both camps. In addition, HP and Sun are each using as a technical starting point a real-time requirements document created by a National Institute of Standards and Technology group in which both companies participated. The splinter group could gain added credibility if the National Committee for Information Technology Standardization (NCITS), votes to take the splinter group's effort under its wing. NCITS, formerly known as X3, is the body that created specs for a number of programming languages including C, C+ and Fortran. An NCITS committee will vote on the splinter group's plan to proceed with development of the real-time spec on Dec. 1 or Dec. 2. Anticipating a positive outcome, leaders of the splinter group have drafted a statement for release after the vote stating that \"The acceptance of the group's proposal by NCITS clears the way for the creation of a true standard in an open, vendor-neutral forum.\" The embedded community is likely to be roiled by continued friction over the dueling real-time efforts. \"Sun has had some success with other Java standards, but the embedded-systems world is just a little too fragmented to say, 'We'll let Sun and a few of their licensees do their standard and we'll all follow along,'\" said Tucker Taft, technical director of splinter-group member Intermetrics of Burlington, Mass. \"It's not worth our time to comment,\" a Sun executive said of the latest splinter-group development. Fractious history Sun and HP first locked horns over Java earlier this year, when both companies came out with separate embedded implementations. Sun launched its EmbeddedJava technology in March with an impressive list of licensees, including Acorn, Chorus (now owned by Sun), Geoworks, Lucent, Mentor Graphic's Microtec division, Microware Systems, Motorola, QNX Software Systems, US Software and Wind River Systems. Almost simultaneously, HP debuted its own embedded Java technology. Microsoft licensed HP's Java Virtual Machine with plans to integrate it into its Windows CE operating system. HP has also inked licensing deals with real-time operating system vendors Integrated Systems, Lynx Real-Time Systems, Microware and QNX. In addition, Wind River endorsed, but didn't formally license, the HP technology.\n\n>From MAILER-DAEMON@cs.depaul.edu Tue Dec 1 19:13:17 1998 MIME-Version: 1.0 Resent-Date: Tue, 01 Dec 1998 19:14:06 -0600 X-Sender: gary@lance.cs.depaul.edu (Unverified) Date: Tue, 01 Dec 1998 19:14:06 -0600 To: compnews@gbw.cs.depaul.edu, Noah Roselander From: Gary Weinstein Subject: Microsoft fills NT 4.0 security hole Sender: compnews-request@gbw.cs.depaul.edu Resent-From: compnews@gbw.cs.depaul.edu X-Unsub: To leave, send text 'LEAVE' to Microsoft fills NT 4.0 security hole By Bob Trott InfoWorld Electric Posted at 2:18 PM PT, Dec 1, 1998 Microsoft has plugged the \"Named Pipes over RPC\" security flaw, the first hole sprung by Windows NT 4.0 since the release of the company's latest pack of fixes, Service Pack 4. The hole allowed hackers to provoke a denial-of-service attack on an NT 4.0 system by opening multiple named pipe connections to Remote Procedure Call (RPC) services and sending random data. The security breach was independently discovered and reported to Microsoft by the InfoWorld Test Center, and Mnemonix, an information security specialist and self-described NT hacker who works for a company in the United Kingdom. It affects Windows NT Server and Workstation, both the standard and Enterprise editions, as well as Windows Terminal Server. Microsoft security engineers said a hacker could exploit the way NT 4.0 deals with invalidly named pipe RPC connections. Although different system services could be hacked, two of the services typically targeted are the SPOOLSS and LSASS system service processes, according to Microsoft officials. \"When the RPC service attempts to close the invalid connections, the service consumes all CPU resources and memory use grows considerably, which may result in the system hanging,\" Microsoft said in a statement on its Security Advisor Web site. \"This is a denial of service vulnerability only; there is no risk of compromise or loss of data from the attacked system.\" Late in November, Microsoft posted a Knowledge Base article about the security hole to its Web site, along with patches for all of the systems affected except for Terminal Server. That fix will be posted as soon as it is available, officials said. However, officials said the fixes, although fully supported, had not yet been regression tested and warned users against applying them unless their systems are specifically vulnerable to the attack. Otherwise, Microsoft recommended that users wait for the next NT service pack, which will include a fully regression-tested version of the patch. Microsoft has not indicated when a fifth service pack for NT 4.0 will be released. Service Pack 4 was released in mid-October. More than a year in the making, it includes year-2000 fixes, support for the euro currency, and an array of other patches, fixes, and updates.

In an e-mail sent last Wednesday to mozilla.org team member Jamie Zawinski, Case indicated that AOL plans to back the open-source group after his company's planned merger with Netscape goes through. \"We're very supportive of mozilla.org; indeed, we're hopeful that our involvement might rally even more support among developers in the open source community,\" Case wrote. Ever since AOL said last week it plans to buy Netscape, the open-source community has been watching closely to see what will become of mozilla.org. The group has become something of a beacon for the open-source community since Netscape went public with the source code to its Communicator browser earlier this year. \"We certainly realize that platform innovation comes from the work of thousands of passionate developers, and we share your view that the agenda of Mozilla is and should be set by those who contribute to it,\" Case wrote in the e-mail. \"We will contribute too -- in part, by maintaining the autonomy of mozilla.org.\" Referring to a remark made by Mike Homer, Netscape executive vice president and general manager, that Mozilla is larger than Netscape, Case wrote, \"I know it's larger than AOL, too.\" Case sent his e-mail in response to a commentary by Zawinski posted on the mozilla.org Web site, titled \"Fear and Loathing on the Merger Trail,\" in which he speculated about the possible ramifications for the Mozilla group of an AOL-Netscape merger.

Microsoft's Windows NT finished dead last overall in a comparison with five different versions of the Unix operating system, concluded a market research firm that assessed the latest versions of these operating systems. IBM's AIX version of Unix topped the rankings, followed by Compaq's Digital Unix, Sun Microsystems' Solaris, and Silicon Graphics' Irix. Each of these four operating systems received a \"good\" rating from D.H. Brown Associates. Hewlett-Packard's HP-UX earned an \"OK\" rating. But \"Even the Enterprise Edition of Windows NT Server 4.0 trails Unix in every area except for PC client support,\" D.H. Brown said in a statement. The company ranks the major Unix variants and NT each year using a scorecard that judges six factors. Windows NT ranked last in every area except one. \"NT still falls short of Unix for advanced Internet protocols and extensions. NT also lags in features for scalability, reliability, availability, serviceability, and system management,\" the study said. Windows NT earned second place in support for PC clients, losing out to Compaq's Digital Unix. The latter also took top marks in its support for its support of services across a large corporation. IBM's AIX ranked first for system management and support for intranets and the Internet. Big Blue has taken \"the most active role of the major operating system vendors\" in providing software for electronic commerce, D.H. Brown said. However, AIX tied for fourth place in its score for reliability, availability, and serviceability. Solaris 7's full 64-bit capabilities launched it from last place among Unix systems last year to third place this year, according to D.H. Brown. Solaris won out in scalability, reliability, availability, and serviceability, but was second-to-last in its support for PC clients. Irix too improved overall, with a strong rating for reliability, availability, and serviceability, the study said. HP-UX, however, slipped backwards, in part because of HP's failure to ship promised Java-based system management tools, which are key for managing a computer remotely. D.H. Brown noted that the study doesn't reflect market share or customer satisfaction. \"The industry has frequently shown that the best technology does not always win in the marketplace,\" the study admitted. Companies still can highlight their system's advantages, D.H. Brown said. \"The results show that in a brutally competitive industry that relies ever more on commodity technology, it is still possible to differentiate with leading-edge operating system features.\"\n\n>From MAILER-DAEMON@cs.depaul.edu Wed Dec 2 15:56:51 1998 MIME-Version: 1.0 Resent-Date: Wed, 02 Dec 1998 15:57:55 -0600 X-Sender: gary@lance.cs.depaul.edu Date: Wed, 02 Dec 1998 15:57:55 -0600 To: compnews@gbw.cs.depaul.edu From: Gary Weinstein Subject: Gates, on tape, draws laughs about stance toward Java Sender: compnews-request@gbw.cs.depaul.edu Resent-From: compnews@gbw.cs.depaul.edu X-Unsub: To leave, send text 'LEAVE' to Gates, on tape, draws laughs about stance toward Java By Michael Moeller, PC Week Online December 2, 1998 2:14 PM ET WASHINGTON -- Bill Gates stole the show again this morning at Microsoft Corp.'s antitrust trial with evasive answers to questions about Java. The screening of more than a half-hour of the Microsoft chairman's taped deposition, taken Aug. 28, was the government's lead-in to its next witness -- James Gosling, a Sun Microsystems Inc. fellow and co-creator of Java. Unlike previously released portions of his deposition, where Gates assiduously dodged questions, today's excerpts proved at times amusing. For example, at one point, David Boies, lead prosecutor for the U.S. Department of Justice, and Gates danced through a series of eight questions about the meaning of the phrase \"pissing on,\" which was used in a Microsoft e-mail sent to Gates regarding the Redmond, Wash., company's plans to discredit forthcoming Java technologies from Sun. \"Now, Mr. Slivka [a Microsoft project leader] here says that Microsoft is going to be saying uncomplimentary things about JDK [Java Development Kit] 1.2 at every opportunity,\" said Boies. \"Do you see that?\" \"Where's that?\" responded Gates. \"'JDK 1.2 has JFC [Java Foundation Class], which we're going to be pissing on at every opportunity,'\" Boies read. \"I don't know if he is referring to pissing on JFC, or pissing on JDK 1.2, nor do I know what he specifically means by 'pissing on,'\" retorted Gates. Frustrated with Gates' refusal to say whether the phrase meant that Microsoft intended to discredit Java, Boies eventually asked Gates if it was actually a code word inside Microsoft for saying nice things about something. While the exchange drew laughs within the courtroom -- even from District Court Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson -- the majority of the video consisted of Gates claiming he had little or no knowledge about the reasons that Sun sued Microsoft over Java or what Java development activities were under way at Microsoft. Gates responded to many of the questions with \"I don't know,\" \"I don't remember\" or \"I'm not sure.\" At one point, Assistant Attorney General Joel Klein could be seen with a wide grin as the tape was being played. Gosling's cross-examination proved to be a reunion of sorts with Tom Burt, Microsoft's associate general counsel. Burt cross-examined Gosling earlier this year in San Jose, Calif., when Microsoft and Sun squared off in the breach-of-contract preliminary injunction hearing. Gosling's cross-examination, which is expected to last several days, had only just begun before the court broke for lunch. During his hour on the stand, Gosling answered numerous questions about the background of Java, how the technology works and the various pieces that make up Java. Just before the break, Burt appeared to be setting up the next piece of his cross-examination by trying to get Gosling to confirm that Java has some weaknesses and that it has never lived up to its promise of \"write once. run anywhere.\" Outside the courtroom during the break, Microsoft (MSFT) officials said the presentation of Gates' deposition may have been amusing, but it was irrelevant.
