        "text": "Welcome to the weekly edition of Healthcare IT Today Bonus Features. This article will be a weekly roundup of interesting stories, product announcements, new hires, partnerships, research studies, awards, sales, and more. Because there’s so much happening out there in healthcare IT we aren’t able to cover in our full articles, we still want to make sure you’re informed of all the latest news, announcements, and stories happening to help you better do your job.\n\nNews and Research\n\nONC is releasing a proposed rule to implement more provisions of the 21st Century Cures Act. Proposals include additional clarity on exceptions to information blocking, revisions to the Health IT Certification Program, and policies to help advance and build trust in predictive decision support interventions. The full proposed rule is set to be posted on April 18 – just in case you want something to read on the airplane ride home from HIMSS – and comments will be accepted until June 20.\n\nTwo recent reports from Accenture – Technology Vision 2023 and Generative AI – suggest a significant role for language-based AI in healthcare. Accenture estimated that 40% of all working hours in healthcare could be supported or augmented by language-based AI. The consultancy also found that 50% of healthcare organizations plan to use ChatGPT for learning purposes, and 52% are planning CHatGPT pilots in 2023. Overall, 98% of provider executives and 89% of payer executives said generative AI is ushering in a new era of enterprise intelligence.\n\nA Salesforce survey of healthcare workers found that 76% agree that keeping data safe is their priority. However, only 54% said their cybersecurity training is efficient, and 19% said it’s irrelevant for their job. Tellingly, 22% said cybersecurity protocols aren’t followed at their organization – with one-third of workers using the same passwords for personal and work-related log-ins – and 31% said they don’t know what to do in the event of a data breach.\n\nThe inaugural report on consumer technology software and services from the Consumer Technology Association (the folks who put on CES) named digital therapeutics as the fastest-growing software and services market, with 25% growth from 2021 to 2022 and 19% growth from 2022 to 2023. THat said it’s still a relatively small market, according to CTA, with a value of $300 million.\n\nOnly 48% of consumers visit their doctor annually, according to a recent PatientsLikeMe survey. However, 65% of consumers said they would feel more confident in going to the doctor if they had a mobile app or service that regularly reminded them to schedule an appointment, with Millennial and Gen Z consumers most interested in such services.\n\nPartnerships\n\nChronic care at home company Pria is using InterSystems Health Connect Cloud for data integration.\n\nThe 4medica Enterprise Master Patient Index platform is now available on Google Cloud Marketplace.\n\nInterlace Health and Samsung are collaborating to run Interlace’s informed consent products on Samsung tablets.\n\nReal-world data company OM1 released PhenOM, which identify unique digital phenotypes associated with chronic conditions.\n\nProduct and Company News\n\nGoogle Cloud announced an AI-enabled Claims Acceleration Suite to streamline prior authorization and claims processing.
