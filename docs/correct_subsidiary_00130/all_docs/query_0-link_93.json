INTRODUCTION We are all angels with only one wing. We can only fly while embracing each other. — Luciano de Crescenzo The 20th century Italian poet’s metaphor wasn’t about the 21st century corporation, but it might as well have been. The coming century will be unfriendly to superhero CEOs who try to wing their companies heavenward by sheer force of will. Success will belong to companies that are leaderless – or, to be more precise, companies whose leadership is so widely shared that they resemble beehives, ant colonies, or schools of fish. Today, democratic decision-making in corporations is still confined largely to factory floors and new-product laboratories, far from the top of organizational pyramids. That is hardly surprising. In a nation that loves superheroes, people cling to the myth of what management guru Warren Bennis calls “the triumphant individual.’’ The media celebrate CEOs as larger-than-life individuals who single-handedly communicate a vision and lead the way, earning millions for themselves in the process. Cool the hero worship. In the 20th century, the Soviet Union collapsed because its command-andcontrol economy couldn’t keep up with the West’s free market. In the 21st century, the same fate will befall companies whose CEOs attempt to control everything. In a world that is becoming ever more chaotic and dependent on brainpower, teams at the top will make more sense than a single outrageously paid CEO who sits behind a “buck stops here’’ plaque. To see why, look to nature. You might assume a leaderless group of creatures would be ineffectual. Not at all. While one bee is merely a nuisance, a swarm is deadly. “You only have to look at biological systems to see that there are no big hierarchical stacks,’’ says Peter Cochrane, head of research at BT Labs. “Everything is low and flat, very adaptable and very cruel.’’ The Internet allows companies to be more like beehives because information can be shared horizontally rather than funneled up to the CEO’s office and back down again. “The nature of the process that built the Internet will inform everything that touches it. There’s nobody in charge,’’ says John Jordan, director of electronic commerce at Ernst & Young’s Center for Business Innovation. The beauty of such leveling is that the people best equipped to make them can make decisions instantly. Might that produce corporate chaos ? Sure. But that’s not necessarily a bad thing. Uniform thinking enforced from the top can cripple an organization. Silicon Valley knows that well : When programmers try to debug a piece of software, they intentionally isolate themselves from their neighbours so they won’t duplicate each other’s mistakes. Says E&Y’s Jordan : ‘‘when you debug, it’s really good not to have the same assumptions and system as the guy next to you.”\n\n2\n\nManagement Information Systems\n\n1.2. NEW REALITIES Hundreds of thousands of PCs working in concert have already tackled complex computing problems. In the future, some scientists expect spontaneous computer networks to emerge, forming a “huge digital creature’’ The skin is an uncanny piece of engineering. It processes immense amounts of data on temperature, pressure, humidity, and texture. It registers movement in the air, gauges the size of objects by the distance between points of contact, alerts us to danger, and prepares us for pleasure. But the skin does more than register superficial events – it’s a controller. It sends signals to regulate blood flow, activate sweat glands, alert immune cells to marauding invaders, and block ultraviolet light. Even when skin dies, it is utilitarian : Dead cells accumulate in layers to prevent unwanted penetration. In the next century, planet earth will don an electronic skin. It will use the Internet as a scaffold to support and transmit its sensations. This skin is already being stitched together. It consists of millions of embedded electronic measuring devices : thermostats, pressure gauges, pollution detectors, cameras, microphones, glucose sensors, EKGs, electroencephalographs. These will probe and monitor cities and endangered species, the atmosphere, our ships, highways and fleets of trucks, our conversations, and our bodies – even our dreams. Ten years from now, there will be trillions of such telemetric systems, each with a microprocessor brain and a radio. Consultant Ernst & Young predicts that by 2010, there will be 10,000 telemetric devices for every human being on the planet. They’ll be in constant contact with one another. But the communication won’t be at our plodding verbal pace. “Fifty kilobits per second is slow,’’ Huffs Horst L. Stormer, a Nobel prize-winning physicist employed by Lucent Technologies Inc.’s Bell Laboratories and Columbia University. Machines will prefer to talk at gigabit speeds and higher – so fast that humans will catch only scattered snippets of the discussion. What will the earth’s new skin permit us to feel ? How will we use its surges of sensation ? For several years – maybe for a decade – there will be no central nervous system to manage this vast signaling network. Certainly there will be no central intelligence. But many scientists believe that some qualities of self-awareness will emerge once the Net is sensually enhanced and emulates the complexity of the human brain. Sensuality is only one force pushing the Net toward intelligence. An eerie symbiosis of human and machine effort is also starting to evolve. The Internet creates a channel for thousands of programmers around the world to collaborate on software development and debugging. That has produced an evolutionary leap in software : The “open source’’ movement that spawned the Linux operating system. The Linux world behaves as an ecosystem – “a self-correcting spontaneous order,’’ as open-source pioneer Eric Raymond describes it in his Net manifesto, The Cathedral and the Bazaar. Through collaboration, this community can push past the technical barriers to machine intelligence. And though silicon networks today look nothing like the brain, nodes of the Net have begun to function as neurons. Researchers have already tackled complex computing problems, such as interpreting interstellar radio signals, by parcelling computing tasks out to about a million PCs working in concert. Within 10 years, discrete microprocessors could be knitted together into ad hoc distributed computers. Don’t think of these as PC networks. The terminals would just as likely be cell phones or Palm-like devices, each one far smarter than today’s heftiest desktops. “Think of this as a whole ecology, an information environment that’s massively connected,’’ says Ernst & Young Chief Technologist John Parkinson.\n\nOverview of Management Information Systems and Practices in the New Millennium\n\n3\n\nSuper brains born of silicon will change everything. Previously intractable problems in science, engineering, and medicine will be a snap. Robots will rapidly displace humans from factories and farms Intelligent computers are now considered as inevitable as Moore’s Law – the 1965 dictum predicting the geometric growth of semiconductor power. The lawgiver himself agrees. “Silicon intelligence is going to evolve to the point where it’ll get hard to tell computers from human beings,’’ says Gordon E. Moore, Chairman Emeritus of Intel Corp. But computer intelligence won’t stop there. Many scientists assert that machines will rapidly become far smarter than Albert Einstein and Hawking rolled into one. Just as humans can design computers with superior number-crunching capabilities, Hawking figures savvy machines will create still better computers. At least by mid-century, and probably much sooner, computers could have smarts way beyond our ken. Silicon will even give birth to new kinds of life, predicts Robert E. Newnham, a materials scientist at Pennsylvania State University. And the advantages of this silicon life – chiefly immortality and unimaginable brainpower – could inspire scientists to forge composite human-silicon life forms “with a common consciousness that transcends all living beings.’’ 1.3. COMPUTER CLANS Such spontaneous computer networks would be ideal breeding grounds for so-called “emergent’’ phenomena. The concept is championed by the Santa Fe Institute, intellectual home of physicist Murray Gell-Mann, computer scientist John H. Holland, and other architects of a discipline called “complexity.’’ This school studies behavior that emerges from the collective activity of partly independent agents. Individual ants, for example, can’t fight off an attacking wasp, but a colony can. A single brain cell is a simpleton, but a few tens of billions can perform mental miracles. Complexity experts anticipate the occurrence of such phenomena on a Net that will someday comprise billions of smart devices, each linked through thousands of pathways. The whole will add up to more than the sum of its parts, says Sandia National Laboratories Senior Scientist Gerold Yonas. “At some point, a massively parallel computer will reconfigure itself,’’ he predicts, and portions of the Net will take actions that no human engineer programmed or even planned for. Humans won’t be removed from the process, says Leonard Kleinrock, inventor of packet switching technology and architect of the Net’s first node, 30 years ago at the University of California at Los Angeles. “Millions of people contributing ideas in unforeseen ways are part of this complex adaptive system,’’ he says, pointing to the open-source movement as proof. Now, toss into this ecosystem a few hundred million intelligent software agents, vastly more powerful than the crude software “bots’’ that perform Web searches today. Add the voices and intentions of a few billion digital pets, companions, and caretakers. Then stretch out a sensory, telemetric fabric. “The network itself becomes a huge digital creature,’’ says Toshitada Doi, chairman of Sony Corp.’s Digital Creatures Lab. “We will carefully design it so that it will help human beings, not harm them.’ That may not be easy, however. Emergent behavior could be mischievous, even sinister. In Sandia simulations with software agents acting as communications nodes in network, the nodes have assembled themselves into clans. “In a real network, the clans might have distinct points of view,’’ Yonas says, “and one might be antithetical to another.’’ 1.4. SELF-HEALING NETWORKS By the time something like that happens, networks should gain some of the resilience and safeguards of living organizms. For a start, “networks will learn to heal themselves,’’ says Sprint Chief Technology Officer Martin J. Kaplan. And when the earth’s own skin signals danger – seismic activity, a geomagnetic storm, or a worrisome spike in financial transactions – the Net will sense it, alert people, and reroute traffic.\n\n4\n\nManagement Information Systems\n\nCritics of the Santa Fe school say it lacks a solid theoretical foundation. Supporters concede that point, but say the field is still new. “This is 21st century science,’’ says William N. Joy, founder and chief scientist of Sun Microsystems Inc.Humanity is now preparing to cast its net across the solar system. At NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., scientists are devising a version of the Internet called InterPlanet that will weave the moon, Mars, and some asteroids and comets into the earth’s expanding nervous system. Today’s communications between earth and unmanned probes are expensive, proprietary, and complex. With InterPlanet, ‘‘we can simplify everything, cut costs, and engage the public more effectively,’’ especially when astronauts arrive on Mars, says JPL team leader Adrian Hooke, manager of space data systems. Then, the earth’s telemetric body will span the reaches of the solar system. The Net may not experience all the human thrills of exploration. But it will feel some tingles up and down its spine. 1.5. BRAINS IN A BOX Either way, the human brain has only a short time left as the smartest thing on earth. The speed and complexity of computers will continue to double every 18 months through 2012. By then the density of computer circuits will have jumped 1,000-fold, and the raw processing power of a human brain will fit into a shoebox. With luck, that milestone might come a lot sooner – perhaps as early as 2005, says John C. Carson, chief technology officer at Irvine Sensors Corp., a Silicon Valley chip company. Beyond 2012 chips that exploit the quirky world of quantum mechanics promise far bigger leaps in complexity. Because such chips won’t need wires, which now occupy most of the space on silicon, it won’t take long to duplicate a human brain fully – not only its 100 billion neurons but also its trillions of synapses, or interconnections. This dense maze of interconnections is regarded as essential for intelligence to emerge. Hardware brains will get there by 2020, predicts Raymond C. Kurzweil, founder of Kurzweil Technologies Inc. Then they’ll soar way past human “wetware.’’ A billion human brains could soon be crammed into a cubic inch of quantum circuitry, Kurzweil says. And the size of artificial brains won’t be constrained by the human skull. They could grow as big as trucks. De Garis of ATR even sees brains the size of satellites orbiting the earth. Critics contend that no matter how big computers get, they can’t become intelligent until we know how to emulate the brain’s functions in software. Not so, retorts Inman Harvey, a mathematician turned robotics at Britain’s University of Sussex. By mimicking evolution, “it’s possible to create artificial brains without really understanding how they work,’’ he says. In other words, they could evolve their own internal programming, just as human brains have. 1.6. ROBOTIC ROAD AGE ? These super brains will change everything. Previously intractable problems in science, engineering, and medicine will be a snap. After 2025, Kurzweil says, robots will rapidly displace humans from factories and farms, and they’ll provide basic human necessities to all people. Cars, planes, and trains will operate themselves, and the carnage on the highways will end in the 2030s.Even the nature of human life itself will be changing by mid-century. Neural implants will expand human knowledge and thinking powers – and begin a transition to composite man-machine relationships that will gradually phase out the need for biological bodies. Swarms of microscopic robots will take up positions in the brain’s sensory areas and create virtual-reality simulations that are impossible to distinguish from real reality. Communicating with family and friends won’t require your physical presence. The best food you’ve ever eaten can be enjoyed time and again with different companions. And traveling to Mt. Fuji or the Louvre will be pointless, because your body won’t be able to do or sense anything that can’t be provided by in-brain simulations.\n\nOverview of Management Information Systems and Practices in the New Millennium\n\n5\n\nSo, come 2099, Kurzweil figures only a very small group of people will still inhabit biological bodies. Most humans will have transferred their minds into electronic circuits – and attained immortality as a result Penn State’s Newnham is sorry he won’t have that opportunity, because he’s already 70. “I would like to live such a life,’’ Newnham says wistfully. “I would like to have the time to learn why life is, why we are here, why there is matter, and why the universe exists. I’d like to know those answers.’’ 1.7. A NIGHTMARE ? At the moment, computers show no sign of intelligence. This is not surprising, because our present computers are less complex than the brain of an earthworm. But it seems to me that if very complicated chemical molecules can operate in humans to make them intelligent, then equally complicated electronic circuits can also make computers act in an intelligent way. – Stephen W. Hawking These wild notions no longer come just from science-fiction writers. They’re slowly creeping into mainstream science. And researchers are waking up to the implications of the monumental event that’s coming within many of their lifetimes : our first contact with an alien intelligence. The arrival of silicon life will transform civilization. All our science and art, even our concept of self, stems ultimately from what our senses tell us about the world. But beings that can see radio waves and listen to starlight, that can feel the vast empty spaces in atoms of steel, will have a very different perception of reality. What we learn from them could be more wondrous than all the discoveries made with microscopes, telescopes, X-ray machines, and other high-tech tools for amplifying our senses. Some researchers fear super-brainy machines will be a science-fiction nightmare come true. Kevin Warwick, head of cybernetics research at Britain’s University of Reading, is convinced that machines will subjugate humanity by 2050. And Hugo de Garis, head of a project to build silicon brains at Japan’s Advanced Telecommunications Research Institute International (ATR), admits he is haunted by the prospect that his creations might “swat me like a fly.” Other researchers figure such beings would be too wise not to respect life in all its myriad forms. The idea of malevolent machines is based on the mistaken assumption that intelligent machines would behave pretty much like people, “foibles and all,’’ scoffs Igor Aleksander, head of neural systems engineering at London’s Imperial College of Science, Technology & Medicine. But sexless creatures that know they are machines and can exist essentially forever wouldn’t be driven to compete for territory and mates – two main sources of human inhumanity and maltreatment of lower life forms. So, if super smart machines come to regard people as unfit company, perhaps they’ll just build cylinders around themselves and blast into space. Some may do so anyhow, seeking new knowledge, since space travel will be a breeze for them. 1.8. BETWEEN SILICON VALLEY AND SILICON ALLEY Just a few years back, the future looked bleak in Washington. Big Government was in decline as political power shifted to state capitals. To make matters worse, federal agencies were shedding thousands of employees, depressing both real estate values and the city’s spirits. While the rest of the country may still think of it as a snake pit of legislators, lawyers, and lobbyists, Washington is quickly morphing into a high-tech hotbed. Entrepreneurial fever is sweeping the Potomac. Hundreds of new companies are being started, particularly in the communications and Internet industries. Who cares who the latest House Whip is ? Executives such as America Online CEO Stephen M. Case are replacing politicians as the city’s stars. The result is “Silicon Swamp,’’ where the big fish swim and only the swift survive. “Silicon Valley is still the nation’s technology nerve center, but Washington is next on the list,’’ says Marc Andersen, a founder of Netscape Communications Corp. who has moved to AOL as chief technology officer.\n\n6\n\nManagement Information Systems\n\nA bit of boosterism ? Sure. But not by much. With 208,700 technology workers, the D.C. metro area ranks as the third-largest high-tech center in the country after Silicon Valley and Boston, according to the economic consulting firm Regional Financial Associates Inc. That’s up from ninth largest in 1985. Tech employees now outnumber government drones – a Price Waterhouse Coopers study shows. And the rate of the industry’s growth is so speedy that the Commerce Dept. estimates that Virginia’s technology workforce will increase nearly 10% annually, to 135,100 in 2006. “D.C. is the only place outside of the Bay Area where people are willing to take a risk,’’ says Vinod Khosla, a partner at Silicon Valley venture firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers. Last February, startup Teligent Inc. in Vienna , Va., hosted a job fair to find skilled telecom staffers to launch a national wireless phone network. CEO Alex Mandl, former president of AT&T Corp. Expected about 100 prospects, but more than 1,000 showed up. Cars gridlocked outside, and Teligent President Buddy Pickle had to run out and direct traffic. “It was a disaster,’’ says Mandl. “But we hired a lot of experienced people.’’ 1.8.1. Fertile Ground To be sure, the boom in technology is buoying many parts of the country beyond the Beltway. Between the traditional poles of Silicon Valley and Boston, Denver is becoming the epicenter for telecom upstarts like Quest Communications International Inc. And Level 3 Communications Inc. Austin, Tex., Raleigh, N.C., and New York’s Silicon Alley also are thriving. But the impact on Washington is perhaps the most dramatic because it has always been a government town. “Networking in Washington used to mean cocktails in Georgetown,’’ says Mark Zandi, chief economist at Regional Financial Associates. “It now means building the Internet infrastructure for the next century.’’ How did Silicon Swamp get to be such fertile ground ? It all started with the federal government. MCI Communications Corp. First located in D.C. because it was so critical for the company to lobby regulators to break up AT&T’s long-distance monopoly. Since then, telecom startups such as Teligent have followed in MCI’s footsteps to wangle everything from favorable rules to airwave licenses. Similarly, many satellite companies have settled into the region because getting government authorization is such a large part of their businesses. “Satellite companies are here for the same reason that gold mining companies are in South Africa,’’ says Noah A. Samara, CEO of D.C.-based satellite radio company World Space Corp. Even more important, the Pentagon’s creation of Arpanet, the precursor to the Internet, has hatched a slew of local startups that have become Net heavyweights. Rick Adams, a former federal worker who invented one of the first methods of linking computers to Arpanet, founded UUNET Technologies Inc. in his Fairfax (Va.) home in 1987. Since then, UUNET, now part of MCI WorldCom Inc., has grown into the world’s biggest commercial Internet service provider. PSINet Inc. Founder and CEO William L. Schrader moved from New York to Reston, Va., to attract engineers with Internet experience. And from its original Commerce Dept. contract for registering Internet addresses, Network Solutions Inc. Of Herndon, Va., has matured into a $100 million E-commerce power. There was a little luck involved too : Online Goliath AOL ended up in Dulles, Va., because D.C. was founder James V. Kimsey’s hometown. 1.8.2 The Indians Have Arrived in Silicon Valley ! “Ten years ago, if you wanted to raise money for a business in the US, you needed to have at least one white American in a key executive staff position,” says B V Jagadeesh, successful NRI InfoTech businessman, angel investor, and now president of network infrastructure Netscaler. “Now, the dictum in Silicon Valley is that if you want a VC firm to fund you, you should have at least one Indian on it!” Nilekani and Jagadeesh seldom give media interviews or share their experiences, preferring to talk about their companies instead.\n\nOverview of Management Information Systems and Practices in the New Millennium\n\n7\n\n“Post-1995, a lot of global successes are of people of Indian origin,” says Kar. “The entire mindset and attitude towards risk taking has changed now. People are more willing to quit jobs and start out on their own. Their families too are willing. Another major change has been that they are no longer funded by debts, but through liquidity. In the 1990s, your biggest expenditure per month after salaries was towards loan repayment. This no longer exists. All this has led to young people becoming entrepreneurs.” Another major change is in the perception of an entrepreneur today. “They have gone from being social outcasts to heroes now,” says Nilekani. “Ten years ago, the children of middle class families would either go abroad, take jobs with banks or join the Hindustan Lever kind of company. The notion that you could take a risk was greatly circumscribed. That has changed dramatically now. When we were trying to recruit people in the early nineties, most of them did not want to come and work for a small company : they preferred big companies and the public sector. “Another new concept now is that management teams are also being valued nowadays. A good team of five people heading a new company could be valued at $10 billion. Earlier, you had no money and had to take a severe cut in your standard of living to start a new company. By valuing management teams, you are creating a much bigger starting point for companies. “The coverage of entrepreneurs in the media has gone up greatly over the past 3 or 4 years. The success stories of entrepreneurs in India and those who have gone abroad are now read with much interest. So today’s parents are comfortable with the idea of their children taking professional risks. All this has led to a dramatic change in the social perception of entrepreneurs.” Jagadeesh too encountered great difficulty in raising money for his business ventures, but in the US, when he first tried it a decade ago. “It was not easy to raise money in the US capital market then, because Indians had set all the wrong accounting examples in the financial market, through companies like California Microdevices and Media Vision,” he says. “Even in 1994-’95, I found it very difficult to raise money for Exodus. Things have changed dramatically over the past couple of years because of the great success stories of companies owned by Indians. The glass ceiling for Indians trying to raise money in the US today has been broken. If you are an Indian-founded company with primarily Indians as the key members of the team, you don’t have to hesitate today to go to a venture capitalist to raise money.” The change in perception here is in a realisation of the commitment that Indians have towards building companies, says Jagadeesh. “We want to create a Silicon Valley kind of environment in the investment sector in India too now,” he says. “Ideas are created by entrepreneurs, and are funded by venture capitalists who are essentially taking 100 per cent of the risk on that idea, and also working closely with it. Five years ago, a VC firm that funded Exodus found that two of the 17 firms it funded were mega successes, five were positive and 10 went out of business. Today, because VCs are more knowledgeable, the success rate is far higher. We want to replicate this smart money syndrome to India now. Indian entrepreneurs in IT too have now evolved beyond what he rightly describes as a typical dotcom kind of mentality that they had 6-8 months ago, and have now learnt to develop much more solid business ideas.” Now, the ability of both entrepreneurs and funding institutions to take risks has gone up tremendously. For the pioneers of Indian IT entrepreneurship, like Infosys, the liquidity crunch was a serious problem for the first decade or more of their existence. Infosys actually started with an equity of Rs. 10,000 in 1981, and got its first round of liquidity a dozen years later, in 1993. “In 1980s, there was obviously no venture capital in India,” recalls Nilekani. “Our only sources of funds were commercial banks, which would give working capital loans, developmental banking institutions like IDBI which gave long term loans to build assets. Neither of these were able to comprehend the knowledge industry. The growth of IT firms was certainly stunted for a long time because of the lack of funding.” The fear of risk has also\n\n8\n\nManagement Information Systems\n\nreduced now, as neither the entrepreneurs nor the employees are cash-strapped when they involve themselves with start-ups. “The first round of people who have made money out of stock options have now made the rest more willing to take risks,” says Nilekani. “Now, VCs have removed from the minds of prospective entrepreneurs the fear of how to manage their day to day lives if they quit steady jobs.” Many of those who were entrepreneurs struggling to find finance 10 years ago have now become angel investors themselves, through this cycle. “I turned from entrepreneur to angel investor myself about 18 months ago,” says Jagadeesh. “The phenomenal entrepreneur activity going on all over India now makes me feel that I would like to proliferate the Internet here. I have virtually built the next generation of the Internet’s backbone, as 30-40 per cent of the world’s Internet traffic has run on Exodus’ backbone today. As I am from India, I have this dream of making India a part of this Internet revolution. I want to do this by helping some Indian companies now.” At first, angel investors were invariably dollar millionaires. Now, some successful Indian businessmen have also begun to venture into this area. “Each of us has the bandwidth to support only a couple of companies,” says Jagadeesh, who is based in California. “But Indian entrepreneurs must now develop the ability to sell their ideas to several investors like me and put their companies on the roads.” These pioneers also see a shift from the traditional model of software services as the fastest and most lucrative option for Indian companies. “With the advent of Internet, there are so many segments like telecom which provide huge opportunities,” says Nilekani. “Besides, there are more people like Jagadeesh around now who operate in both India and the US, can recognise trends in both countries and act as osmotic agents between both economies. Indian companies are now able to develop new technologies that are globally saleable.” 1.9.

CONCLUSION It is realised from the above discussion that Management Information System is not the end itself it is only a means to an end. In this context, we have to rely importance of human brain, which is unique in many aspects. Brains in a box or Robotic road age are the emerging concepts in MIS. Again this chapter explains the consolidation of net works, self-healing networks and the new realities of the global and local business environments. Silicon valley forms the power hose of global technology and surprisingly Indians forms 5% of the population!\n\nKEY TERMS AND CONCEPTS Computer clans-self healing networks-brains in a box-robotic road age-silicon valley-\n\nFOCUS 1.1. ‘Indians Form 15% of Silicon Valley’s Skilled Manpower’ (Source: Inputs received from PTI, Business Standard and rediffmail with permission.)\n\nDo Indians really form the bulk of the entrepreneurial community in the Silicon Valley ? Must your name really be Krishna Murthy and not Chris Murray if you want to get big funding for your company ? Or is the immigrant Indian community in the Valley just one of many such communities from various countries, struggling to establish its own identity ? —Annalee Saxenian Well-known author of the books Regional Advantage : Culture and Competition in Silicon Valley and Route 128 spoke 1. What percentage of the Silicon Valley entrepreneurs is Indian ? Ans. The data I have from 1999 to now be that 10-15 per cent of the technology companies in the Valley are Indian-run. This is the same as their representation in the skilled workforce. Previously, if you wanted to have a successful company, take it public and so on, you would need a white guy to run it ? All this has changed now. There is a much greater respect for the capabilities of the Indians and Chinese, and the ability to be good managers. 2. And what percentage of the people working in the Valley is Indian ? People here believe that it is as high as 50-75 per cent ?\n\n10\n\nManagement Information Systems\n\nAns. Everyone likes to think that they are the moving force behind the Valley. The French say that they are 20 per cent of the Valley. I could not give you a very accurate percentage. But I would be willing to bet on its being about 10 per cent to a maximum 15 per cent, not more. They all belong to the highly skilled work force, though. 3. What has made the Indian so successful in the Valley ? Is it his strong educational background ? His brain, which is ‘genetically designed’ to do good math ? Ans. The people who come there to study are invariably those who have already made it to the best Indian engineering and graduate schools, so they are undoubtedly already very talented. Then again, it’s a well-known fact that first generation immigrants, wherever they are from, are always willing to work very hard. People who come from a poor country are usually middle class professionals, not the elite. They do not come from a background where they think that they can just relax. I see this tendency in the Indians, the Chinese and the Taiwanese. 4. How did you get interested in studying the Indian immigrant community in the Valley ? Ans. I wrote a book about Silicon Valley, which was published in 1994. I got a letter from a venture capitalist in the Valley who wrote to me and said that the book was good, but you missed an important aspect of the Valley, which is the immigrant community. I realised that he was right, because when I did my interviews for the book, I had been meeting more and more Chinese, Indians other Asian entrepreneurs. So I thought I would just document how many of them were there and were they becoming entrepreneurs or not. I discovered right off that there were far more than anyone realised, mostly the Indians and the Chinese. So in 1997-98, I interviewed a lot of entrepreneurs from these communities to find out what were their stories. I found that both communities had essentially the same story. Namely, that they came to the US to graduate. Then, they got sucked into the CaliforniaSilicon Valley economy, which was booming. Over time, they came together because they shared language and cultural history, and also because they felt that they were outsiders. The Indians certainly felt that they were excluded from the mainstream and the old boys’ network. So they created their own networks and associations like The Indus Entrepreneurs, the Silicon Valley Indian Professionals Association and others. These associations were originally intended to help them overcome the glass ceiling. Over time, these associations became sources of information, mentoring and even capital for start-ups. 5. As you rightly say, the Indians who went to the US a couple of decades ago went there to study and stayed on to work either in universities or for American companies. When did they actually start becoming entrepreneurs in the Valley in such large numbers ? Ans. Silicon Valley offers an entirely different business model, with venture capital, role models and networking opportunities. Elsewhere in the US, it was not really fashionable to become an entrepreneur until the 1990s. I think the Indians, like the white boys before them, started becoming entrepreneurs when they got frustrated with the big companies. 6. Indian entrepreneurship of the Valley kind is just starting in India now. But before this dot-com wave that India is going through, there were very few companies that came up with innovative new ideas, products or technologies. Early entrepreneurs in India like the men who started Infosys all practiced a low-end kind of body shopping. Yet, Indians in the Valley have started new companies that actually create new technologies or products. What do you think is responsible for this difference ? It’s the same Indian brain at work in both places, right ?\n\nOverview of Management Information Systems and Practices in the New Millennium\n\n11\n\nAns. The people who start companies in the US have had so much experience in companies that develop products. They understand, both, how a product company works and also what the market looks like. The problem in India is that the only models are companies like Infosys. So all the entrepreneurs here try to grow other little Infosys, which in the long run is not a winning game. This is so because Infosys and Wiper have that business wrapped up between them. I think it will take time before people have the experience base and the understanding of markets and technology before they can start different kinds of companies. Even the venture capitalists don’t have the kind of experience here that they have in the Valley. The problem in India is that even if a person works for 10 years, the only experience he or she would have got is in services companies, not in product or technology companies. I think all this will only change when people return from Silicon Valley with good ideas and a merging of talent from Bangalore and the Valley take place. 6. Do you see any reason for Bangalore to be called the Silicon Valley of India ? Or is it a wrong label that Bangalore has been given ? Ans. I think it is dangerous because people are getting obsessed with the idea that Bangalore can be Silicon Valley. There can actually never be another Silicon Valley. There will be other places that are dynamic, will grow fast, and spawn entrepreneurs. Bangalore could be any one of those. But it could never be another Silicon Valley, which is now almost half-a-century old. 7. The economic and business growth of countries like Taiwan have been catalysed by the immigrant Taiwanese who made good in the US and then returned home to build the economy of their own countries. This is simply not happening in India, although Indians have been immigrating to the US in large numbers for more than half a century now. The NRIs are investing money in Indian companies and forming associations and alliances with them. But you do not see any dynamism or intellectual commitment in their involvement ? Ans. Yes, that’s true. In fact, when I started researching Indian immigrants to the Valley in 1997, there was absolutely no involvement of the immigrant Indians in the Indian economy. Even the people who started The Indus Entrepreneurs, like Kanwal Rekhi (NRI venture capitalist, entrepreneur, millionaire), said to me, “Oh, we don’t want to have anything to do with India. It’s too backward, corrupt and heartbreaking.” This situation has changed now. But there is certainly a long way to go before you see a real cross-fertilisation of the kind that you see in Taiwan. However, one must also remember that Taiwan took 20 years to develop. It was in 1980 that Taiwan began to develop as a place where multinationals went for cheap IT labour, and over time, it moved up the value chain. There are a few people now who have made their money in Silicon Valley who are investing their money in Indian companies. But they are certainly not coming back here to start companies themselves. 8. Could this also be because the Indian who moves out of India no longer identifies with India ? Like the Japanese, who feels strongly for Japan wherever in the globe he or she might be ? Do you think the Indians in the US don’t want to involve themselves in rebuilding the Indian economy or helping our IT industry rise in the value chain ? Ans. I think your broad generalisation is quite right. It certainly captures everything that I have seen in the past three years myself. The people of Rekhi’s generation will never really come back here to settle. They may feel guilty and give money. But the best hope is for the younger generation : people, who have gone to the US, worked for a little while but don’t have deep roots in the US. Houses, kids and all the things that tie people down.\n\n12\n\nManagement Information Systems\n\n9. Ans.\n\n10. Ans.\n\n11. Ans.\n\n12.\n\nAns.\n\n13. Ans.\n\nI have met some idealistic people of this younger generation in the US, who get caught up in the fact that there is enough opportunity to make a contribution back to the India. You are right when you say the Taiwanese or the Japanese have a strong sense of national identity. India and its economy somehow, for reasons that, perhaps, you understand better than I do, seems to be easy to leave behind once you leave its shores. Is there really an idealistic young generation of Indians in Silicon Valley right now, waiting to come back home and make a difference to their country ? Oh, yes! I have met a few. I think there is some part of these people that wishes they could come back home and ‘stand by India’. I don’t know if they really will eventually. But I do know that there are a lot of young men and women who feel very torn, because they spent all their childhood and growing years in India. I think there is a chance for those people. Are there a lot of Indians in the angel investing business and the venture capital business in the Valley now ? Three years ago, there were a very small number of Indians like Vinod Khosla in the mainstream firms. Now, even the established venture capital firms would like to hire Indians, at least to tap ventures in the Indian community. There has also been a proliferation of angel investors from all over in the Valley : native-born Americans, Indians, Chinese, and Taiwanese. Anyone who has discretionary income would like to invest in start-ups and try to make some quick money. Indian angel investors do tend to invest in Indian companies. This could also be because one hears of great business opportunities through networking, probably with the people you hang out with. Does the Indian community in the Valley basically stick to itself ? It’s hard to say. When they socialise, or take care of the kids, I guess they do hang out together. Culture, language and such things keep them together. But Indians do work very well with mainstream Americans. You see them joking together, going out together, having a common language. But I do feel that when they get married and raise their kids, they do go back to their own culture. Have the Indians living in the Valley really become a part of its mainstream ? Does it bother them that they are not fully accepted into the mainstream, or not treated as first class citizens in all the subtle dimensions of their daily lives ? The US is quite a diverse place. Yes, I’m sure that some white guys whose ancestors came to the US on the Mayflower really feel that they are the insiders. But in California, the wealthy Indians have really done very well for themselves. They have gorgeous houses in the nicest parts of the Bay area of San Francisco. They are very well established. I think that if any of them are not apart of the mainstream, it must be more a class thing than a racial thing. They have a very strong network amongst themselves. Even in other parts of the US, they have cricket clubs, movie theatres and even television stations for themselves. They have a flourishing sub-culture. Have you attempted any kind of further ethnic analysis of the Indian community in the Valley ? Is it true that there are far more South Indians there than North Indians ? It is very clear that there are more South Indians there. If you look at the H1 visas given out, there are far more South Indians who seem to get them. There are studies to that effect.\n\nOverview of Management Information Systems and Practices in the New Millennium\n\n13\n\n14. Any changes in the kind of Indian coming into the US very recently ? Ans. There are two different kinds of people coming in now. One is the student who completes his PhD in the US, joins a company and so on. The second kind coming in now is the person who comes directly into the US to work, through a body-shopper or some such intermediary. They don’t necessarily end up in the Silicon Valley, though. This segment seems to have grown largely in numbers of late.\n\nMANAGEMENT PERSPECTIVE 1.2. ‘India has Merged with Global Knowledge Economy Now.’ (Source: Inputs received from PTI, Business Standard and rediffmail – Business headlines with permission)\n\nALFRED BERKLEY, President of America’s InfoTech stock exchange, NASDAQ, That he should come calling at a time when the Indian stockmarkets are in a state of turmoil, following the meltdown in infotech stocks on NASDAQ, makes his visit that much more significant. He is a graduate from the Wharton School. He joined a finance-cum-technology company, Alex Brown, in 1972. He worked with the company till 1996, and then joined NASDAQ as president. Today, NASDAQ, employee stock options, market capitalisation, and technology scraps - are part of everyday breakfast conversation. 1. What do you feel about Indian markets vis-à-vis the international bourses ? Ans. When NASDAQ is happy, Sensex is excited. When NASDAQ feels the blues, a pall of gloom envelops Indian bourses. This shows that India has finally merged with the global knowledge economy. 2. Is the talk about the InfoTech wave nothing more than hype ? Ans. Such talk makes it much more exciting. I agree there is a lot of confusion in the markets. When the initial euphoria ends, people start thinking ‘Is it the right thing ?’ or ‘Is it just a lot of noise ?’ But I want to tell them to stay put. Because, out there in the stock markets, it is the survival of the smartest. Over-smartness will not work. The world is dependent on technology stocks. And India has been recognised and acknowledged for its ability to create wealth through knowledge. This recognition first came in the Silicon Valley where the Indians made their presence felt immediately, and immensely. Over 40 per cent of the start-ups in the Silicon Valley are by Indians. Now this knowledge is being used within India by Indians to create wealth. The great divide between old economy and the new economy has been established. Before the software revolution, Indians used to work for Birlas and Tatas. Now things have changed. Software engineers are becoming millionaires in just three years. It’s a new breed of entrepreneurs that has come up in India.\n\n14\n\nManagement Information Systems\n\n3. Do you plan to have a trading exchange in India ? Ans. The stock markets around the world are in a state of flux. However, we are trying to create a balance in the US. We are seeking to globalise NASDAQ. We will be setting up trading exchanges in Japan and Europe. In India, however, there are no plans to set up an exchange till there is full convertibility here. But we’ll set up a representative office, possibly in Delhi, to facilitate Indian companies to list on NASDAQ. 4. What do you think about the Indian stocks listed on NASDAQ ? Ans. India is on the move. Infy and Sify have performed wonderfully well on NASDAQ. There is a big appetite for fast-growing Indian companies. I have immense faith in technology, and I am sure that the new world will be created on the technology platform. Investors today are looking at future growth, not past performance. Success of Infosys Technologies and Satyam Infoway on NASDAQ has created a huge demand for Indian stocks among the US investors. 5. Do you see more Indian companies listing on NASDAQ in the near future ? Ans. This year more Indian companies will come to NASDAQ for listing. About 7 or 8 of them. Actually, we are talking to over a dozen Indian companies for a possible listing and I expect at least one-third of these to be listed this year itself. And I am not just talking about InfoTech here. The entire span of knowledge-based industry is now growth-oriented. The new companies that will make waves on NASDAQ are likely to be from pharmacy, biotech, software, media and telecom sectors.” Currently, out of the 5,000 companies listed on NASDAQ, only two Infosys and Satyam Info – are Indian. Quite insignificant a number, compared to Israel’s 98. In the next two years, about 24 companies are expected to touch base at NASDAQ. That means these companies could raise well over $ 1 billion. 6. What about the current Sensex blues ? Ans. Technology stocks dictate as much as 40 per cent of the Sensex movement. The Sensex moves with technology. A year ago, it was the old economy stocks that were performing well. But now it is technology stocks. Despite this short-term flu, India will have its own story to tell as far as its tech stocks are concerned. 7. What about the old economy stocks ? What kind of investor-interest are they generating ? Ans. There is no appetite for the old economy stocks right now. Hence, I expect it will be new economy stocks that will continue to see a rise in demand from the US investors. With over 48 per cent of the US investor community being involved in trading technology stocks, and NASDAQ witnessing a large volume of trade, it is the ideal choice for Indian companies. Besides, it is really a very simple process. The combined market value of the 5,000 companies listed on NASDAQ was $ 5.2 trillion at the end of 1999, a rise of over 100 per cent from yearend figures for1998. The market has a larger dollar volume and trades more shares per day than any other market in the US.\n\nCASE STUDY NO : 1 1.3. Chinese Silicon Valley - A Chimer or A Reality ? A Chinese Silicon Valley. A few years ago, the idea would have been laughable. China was a place to make sneakers, not semiconductors. But to many of Silicon Valley’s movers and shakers, the spectator of Chinese competition is no longer a joke. Recent developments inside China – and a few beyond its\n\nOverview of Management Information Systems and Practices in the New Millennium\n\n15\n\nborders – have reshaped the lens through which foreign multinationals view the world’s most populous country. Over the next 10 years, China will become “a ferociously formidable competitor for companies that run the entire length of the technology food chain,” predicts Michael J. Moritz, a partner at Sequoia Capital in Menlo Park, Calif., one of the Valley’s premier venture-capital firms. Consider some of China’s milestones in science and tech : ¾ Chinese universities granted 465,000 science and engineering degrees last year – approaching the total for the U.S. ¾ There are plans to crank out chips from seven new semiconductor plants by 2004, putting China on track to be the world’s second-largest chip producer. ¾ A team at the Beijing Genomics Institute was among the first of several scientific teams to decode the rice genome, landing on the cover of the journal Science. ¾ Two homegrown vendors of network switches, Huawei Technologies Co. and ZTE Corp., have opened offices in the U.S. and Europe and snatched contracts from the likes of Cisco Systems and Nortel Networks. ¾ China has been launching satellites for years and intends to begin manned space missions next year. China’s growing high-tech prowess, and its ability to apply its expertise to defense matters, are bound to be topics of discussion this month when Chinese President Jiang Zemin arrives in the U.S. for a summit at President Bush’s ranch in Crawford, Tex. Beijing’s tech stature adds a new element to its often-troubled relationship with Washington. Bush wants China’s support in the war on terrorism and the campaign against Saddam Hussein. At the same time, GOP hawks see China as one of the biggest long-term threats to U.S. security and economic preeminence. The hawks are opposed, however, by many executives from Corporate America who regard China as a lucrative market and are eager to offer the equipment and expertise it needs to meet its technological goals. Mind you, China’s achievements don’t make it a high-tech superpower today. Despite scientific coups like the rice genome, China’s companies can boast of little useful intellectual property and no paradigm-bending industrial innovations. China’s equity markets are still largely closed to private startups, starving entrepreneurs of capital. Its software industry pales beside India’s, not to mention Silicon Valley, and its stunted pharmaceutical sector hasn’t come up with a single blockbuster drug. The country has yet to curb widespread piracy, a step that is essential for innovation to flourish. It also continues to suppress free speech and censor the Internet. And even now, says Andy Xie, managing director of Morgan Stanley in Hong Kong, “America is sucking away all the best and the brightest in China.” Furthermore, by most standards of comparison, China’s high-tech output doesn’t measure up. Total research spending hovers at about $11 billion, vs. more than $233 billion for the U.S. China’s semiconductor production came to $2.9 billion last year, compared with $71.2 billion in the U.S. PC ownership and Internet penetration both hover at 2% of the population – far below Japan, South Korea, and most Western countries. Nevertheless, China’s early tech successes have convinced many Western executives that there are greater – and more worrisome – things to come. Even without strokes of innovative genius, China’s energetic engineers can continue to clone the world’s most advanced telecom and computer gear, as Huawei has done so successfully with network devices, and market them globally at rock-bottom prices. The total cost of an engineer in China, including benefits, is about $15,000 per year, notes Michael E. Marks, CEO of contract manufacturer Flextronics International Ltd. In Silicon\n\n16\n\nManagement Information Systems\n\nValley, the cost is 10 times that. For now, management at most Chinese companies is too weak for them to compete globally with Cisco, Intel, or Microsoft, Marks believes. Still, he says, “China has enormously talented engineers, and they all want to work. They are adding experience very rapidly. I would understand why U.S. electronics companies would be worried.” Most business folks already appreciate China’s amazing achievement in manufacturing, raising itself from a Maoist backwater in the late 1970s to the world’s most prodigious exporter today. And China isn’t content to be a subcontractor. After more than a century of backwardness, the Chinese, who invented gunpowder, paper, and the compass, intend to regain their tech primacy. “You can’t be economically very powerful but technologically very backward,” says Wang Mingwei, head of the Chinese National Center for Drug Screening in Shanghai. “China is a proud nation and wants to have a say in the science arena, rather than be dominated by the Westerners and the Japanese.” Foreign companies privately might like to put the brakes on the Asian giant. But economics dictate that they do the opposite. To secure access to China’s huge, growing market, dozens of foreign multinationals are entering research partnerships that are certain to upgrade the country’s capabilities. Such pressure is frowned upon by the World Trade Organization, but try telling that to General Electric, Intel, Matsushita Electric, and Siemens all of whom have shared valuable tech know-how. Most recently, Microsoft Corp. announced plans to spend $750 million on a far-ranging research and training program. “China has discovered its leverage,” says Erhfei Liu, Hong Kong-based chairman of Merrill Lynch China. “The Chinese say, ‘If you want market access, give us technology.’ ” In public, executives at Western companies make no apologies for technology transfer. “China is the most vigorous market for the U.S. [and] its most vigorous competitor,” declares Intel Corp. Chairman Andrew S. Grove. But behind closed doors in Silicon Valley, Brussels, and Tokyo, China’s science-and-technology agenda has become a sort of Rorschach test. For every executive like Grove who looks at the inkblots and sees opportunities outweighing risks, another senses palpable danger to Western interests. This camp is influenced by a variety of disturbing defense issues. A July report by the U.S.-China Security Review Commission, a committee composed of a dozen congressional appointees, noted ominously that Beijing is hard at work acquiring “dual-use” technology that can not only boost the economy but also enhance the military and challenge American dominance in Asia. Both responses to the Chinese Rorschach test – allure and alarm – are justified. And if there were only two viewpoints, the China-technology debate would be relatively clear-cut. But there are mitigating arguments that challenge the simple friend-or-foe construct. First, China’s low-cost manufacturing base has driven down the price of consumer gadgets and all manner of industrial components. So shoppers in U.S. malls can take home $70 made-in-China DVD players, and industrial manufacturers such as GE can slash prices on everything from light bulbs to aircraft engines. Second, as the world’s scientific community grapples with overwhelming problems such as cancer, AIDS, and global warming, China’s armies of newly trained scientists will be an important asset. Individuals may attach different priorities to each of these points. But however you rank them, they lead to the same conclusion : China is destined to become a science-and-tech superpower. It won’t happen in 2003 or even 2005. But in the words of Gordon Astles, president of Asian operations for Cisco Systems Inc., China has “the sheer size, the will, the economic growth, and the openness to being part of the world. That says that they have a greater opportunity than ever before.” Beyond consumer gadgets and electronic components, China’s impact on global technology is most evident in the ultra competitive world of network equipment. Manufacturers such as Huawei and ZTE, which have long competed capably inside China, have targeted the breadbaskets of Western networking giants.\n\nOverview of Management Information Systems and Practices in the New Millennium\n\n17\n\nHuawei, which notched $2.4 billion in 2001 sales, recently won deals in Britain and Germany and in June launched a U.S. subsidiary dubbed FutureWei Technologies. Huawei’s international revenues rocketed 210% in the first half of 2002 – an otherwise dismal period for equipment vendors. The company is counting on overseas sales to offset disappointing results in China, where the reorganization of state-owned China Telecom has stalled demand. ZTE, meanwhile, has opened research and development centers in New Jersey, California, and Texas and is targeting sales in Russia, India, and other emerging markets that are still growing despite the telecom depression in the West. “We are not as sophisticated as Lucent , Ericsson , or Cisco, but the gap has shrunk a lot,” says Sun Zhenge, director of ZTE’s technology center in China. “We will have the ability to exceed them in three to five years.” Networking executives in the West should not dismiss such talk as empty bravado. Because of China’s inexpensive, highly skilled workforce, its equipment vendors can beat Cisco and Nortel on price by 25 to 50 percentage points. And while their high-end networking gear still trails that of North American rivals, Huawei and ZTE can compete when it comes to small or midsize networking products. “They’re very serious about North America and Europe,” says Michael Howard, principal analyst at market watcher Infonetics Research. “At every turn, Huawei will compete with Cisco at a much lower price.” In most respects, China’s tech trajectory differs from the one Japan mapped out many decades earlier. Instead of trying to shut foreigners out of the market, Beijing encouraged domestic stars such as Huawei and ZTE to embrace alliances and research collaborations with foreign companies. “There’s no `not-invented-here’ syndrome in China,” says Zhou Zhen-hong, China managing director of Agere Systems, the Lucent Technologies spin-off, which announced in May that it was forming an R&D partnership with ZTE. Thanks to such efforts, Zhou believes that Chinese companies will be able to catch up to foreign rivals faster than Japan’s lumbering giants could. Cooperation “closes the gap between the local companies and the multinationals,” he says. Like the network-equipment makers, China’s cellular-handset manufacturers hope to build on their strength in their immense home market to become global players. With more than 189 million subscribers, China has the world’s largest population of mobile-phone users. That means companies that serve the market gain vast manufacturing economies of scale. Plus, they are in a position to pioneer novel phone-based applications – such as wireless instant messaging – that could have international appeal. For now, Motorola Inc. and Nokia dominate the Chinese market. Nevertheless, handset makers in the West have been steadily losing share in China to local rivals with names like Bird, TCL, and Konka. Multinational manufacturers are responding by increasing their Chinese presence. Motorola has invested $3.4 billion in China, with a large part going to finance a giant chip plant in the northern city of Tianjin. Nokia has opened a sprawling industrial park for itself and its suppliers outside Beijing. German giant Siemens makes some 35% of its cellular phones in Shanghai and early this year shifted a big chunk of its R&D team from Germany to Beijing. Siemens also is working with Chinese partners to develop a new standard for third-generation cellular service, aimed at the mobile Internet. “If China makes it, it will be a world standard,” says Peter A. Borger, president of Siemens Shanghai Mobile Communication Ltd. Certainly, Siemens benefits. But a win in global-cellular standards would also vault China’s players onto the international playing field. Taiwan figures prominently in Beijing’s tech strategy. Although the island’s government remains at odds with Beijing’s leaders, Taiwanese businesses have invested about $70 billion in China, and more of those investments are going toward big-ticket items such as semiconductor plants. In September, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. announced plans to invest $900 million in its first China fab. The Chinese market “may take off pretty rapidly,” says TSMC Chairman Morris Chang. In addition, Taiwan’s chip execs are now managing several contract-manufacturing plants in the Shanghai area. From this\n\n18\n\nManagement Information Systems\n\nbase, Taiwan-educated Richard Chang, a Texas Instruments Inc. veteran, wants to take on the world’s silicon giants. He heads Shanghai’s Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp., a well-connected newcomer that includes among its investors Goldman Sachs and Toshiba Corp. With support from Beijing, ethnic Chinese from around the world are following in the footsteps of Taiwanese and forging new links to China. Shoucheng Zhang, 39, holds joint professorships in the physics departments at Stanford and at Beijing’s Tsinghua University. The latter post was funded by Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-shing, who aims to entice more overseas Chinese scientists to spend time on the mainland. Zhang has been bitten by the same bug : He’s vice-president of Hua Yuan Science Technology Assn., a San Francisco nonprofit that promotes academic and commercial exchanges between the U.S. and China. The association boasts about 2,500 members in the U.S., including academic scientists as well as partners in prominent venture-capital firms such as IDG, Walden International, and WI Harper. In short, Beijing is learning to harness Chinese intellect outside its borders and turn it into a competitive advantage. This has already contributed to strides in technical fields such as superconductivity, nanotechnology, and optics. Says Zhang : “China has been investing very wisely in the sciences. They are doing the right thing.” And while no one has attempted to measure the overseas brain trust China could tap, it is clearly sizable, says Juan Enriquez-Cabot, director of the Life Science Project at Harvard Business School : “When you go into laboratories throughout the world, some of the brightest people are Chinese.” Among the foreign-born scientists and engineers working in the U.S., nearly 40,000 hail from China, more than from any other country. The talent pool demonstrated its ability when China took on the arduous task of sequencing the rice genome, a feat that could one day lead to a cornucopia of hardy bioengineered crops and lay the groundwork for advances in genomic medicine. More than 500 researchers affiliated with the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) worked on the project. But it might not have come to fruition without Seattle-based Gane Ka-Shu Wong, a 41-year-old Canadian physicist and post-doc at the University of Washington School of Medicine who was one of the project’s instigators and lead scientists. The Cornell University-educated Wong and his colleague, Jun Yu, realized their task would require a team of skilled but inexpensive technicians. So in 1998 they persuaded CAS to set up the Beijing Genomics Institute, which housed the rice project. “We needed people to turn the cranks,” explains Wong. “It’s factory work.” One area where China clearly lags the West is the field of computer software. But Beijing has adroitly applied pressure on U.S. companies to help it catch up. For example, Microsoft’s mammoth financial commitment to upgrading China’s skills was prompted partly by the need to play in the world’s largest potential consumer-software market. There was also, however, a concern that the Chinese government would throw its might behind “open-source” programs such as Linux, which could be a disastrous blow to Microsoft’s Windows franchise. Microsoft isn’t the only one feeling the heat. China’s population gives it extraordinary leverage in the design of next-generation programs. Take the area of network standards and operating systems. The Internet wasn’t designed to support today’s teeming cyber population. Now, the global network is running out of “Internet protocol” addresses – a problem that is especially acute in the Chinese-speaking world. So Beijing is pushing for a rapid transition to a new generation of Internet hardware and software known collectively as Internet Protocol Version 6, or IPV6. The U.S. has dragged its feet in this area because, among other things, the transition requires ripping out a lot of existing infrastructure and could render some of today’s widely used computer and network software obsolete. But when it comes to the current generation of software, “China doesn’t have a significant installed base,” says AT&T software maven Steven M. Bellovin. “If China goes ahead\n\nOverview of Management Information Systems and Practices in the New Millennium\n\n19\n\nand deploys Version 6 first, they could be the first to write new software while the rest of the world plays catch-up.” This scenario meshes nicely with China’s larger strategy. Developing a world-class software industry “is absolutely at the top of the agenda,” says Derek Williams, Oracle Corp.’s Hong Kong-based executive vice-president. And in the case of IPV6, even if U.S. companies don’t choose to help China, others will. Nokia has already connected 10 Chinese universities using a router platform and software developed partly at its R&D center in Beijing. Certainly, the country has a lot of ground to make up. China’s software industry generated revenues of just $850 million last year, compared with over $6 billion for India’s. But market researcher Gartner Group estimates that the Chinese industry’s revenue will reach $1.9 billion this year. And if Beijing gets results from its efforts to build software parks, provide incentive packages for programmers, boost English training programs, and enforce protections on intellectual property, the country could achieve parity with India in commercial software by 2006. At that point, in Gartner’s admittedly bullish estimate, both India and China will be reaping more than $27 billion a year in sales of software and application-service revenue. That’s close to $60 billion in annual revenues not booked in Silicon Valley. The Case This thought shouldn’t elicit dread or dismay from Western executives. China is not demonic, and it is not monolithic. But it is poised to move up the technology ladder at a pace unprecedented among nations. The global industrial landscape will be permanently recast, as will the competitive balance among countries and companies. And no leap of technological imagination, threatening or benign, will be beyond China’s reach. DO YOU AGREE TO THIS ? COMMENT.\n\nCASE STUDY NO : 2 1.4. Learn ABC of the Business\n\nTODAY’S companies are complex organizations, with multi-product offerings targeted at the market. The complexities involved are so varied, that even if two customers purchased from the company exactly the same mix of products and services at exactly the same prices and at exactly the same timeperiod, they would not be equally profitable. This may be due to the varying demands they place in terms of servicing or simply additional sets of activities which are required to be performed if they are from different geographic locations. That means that whenever a company has to make decisions with respect to product/customer portfolio optimisation, peeling away the layers of complexity to arrive at the true ‘cost-to-serve’ customer-related costs becomes crucial.\n\n20\n\nManagement Information Systems\n\nWith mounting pressure to increase profitability, can you then imagine a scenario wherein a company wrongly calculates the actual costs of producing and marketing a product and uses that information to decide to stay in or pull out of a particular line of business ? As surprising as this may sound to you, managers of companies selling multiple products are making decisions about pricing, product mix and process outsourcing based on inaccurate and inappropriate cost benchmarks. The reason for this is simple. The cost structures have changed dramatically. A lot of value creation has started happening in the overhead areas as compared to direct expense categories. At the turn of the century, direct labour accounted for about 50 per cent of total product costs, with material being 35 per cent and overhead 15 per cent. Now, overhead typically comprise about 3050 per cent of product costs, with material and direct labour contributing to the balance. Using volume attributes, direct labour hours, machine hours etc as unique drivers for overhead allocation made sense 90 years ago, but it is not relevant given today’s cost structure. Traditional cost accounting systems evolved primarily to serve the function of inventory valuation (satisfying the accounting standards of “objectivity, verifiability, and materiality”), for external audiences such as the regulators, creditors and investors. However, these traditional systems have many failings, especially when used for internal management purposes. These primarily include : ¾ Their inability to report individual product costs to a reasonable level of accuracy. ¾ Their inability to provide useful feedback to management for the purpose of operational control. ¾ Their inability to understand and allocate overhead costs to products that lie in the service and distribution of products. These costs today are substantial since they play a significant role in establishing the leadership position of the company and product in the marketplace. Adding to this is the fact that allocation of overheads is not as straightforward a task as it is assumed to be. Take, for example, a bank that is trying to calculate the overheads allocation between the customer service department of its current account holders and loan applicants. A traditional cost system would trace the costs to the product. Therefore, volume attributes of the product item, such as the number of current account holders and the number of loan applicants would be used as the drivers to allocate overhead costs. However, these volume drivers fail to account for process complexities consuming overheads that include the cost of describing the product to the customer, cost of taking the application, cost of processing the application, cost of approving the application and cost of setting up the customer’s account in the core banking system. The aim, therefore, is to understand the true cost of signing up a new customer for a current account versus a loan application. Thus, by taking into account such activities, the overhead allocation exercise becomes objective and the costing rational. Costs are traced from resources (General Ledger expense items) to activities, based on relevant resource drivers and from activities to products, based on the product’s demand for these activities. This cost assignment path also gives the bank a full understanding of the cost implications of signing up a new customer in both departments during the budgeting exercise. ACTIVITY-BASED COSTING Enter the need for Activity-Based Costing (ABC), a method of matching the costs incurred by a company to its performance, combined with the drivers of resource consumption. Put simply, ABC is carried out by analysing an organization in terms of its activities, the reasons it undertakes them, the drivers that determine how these activities are used, how often they are used and the performance they\n\nOverview of Management Information Systems and Practices in the New Millennium\n\n21\n\nachieve. ABC moves cost data away from being simply a reporting tool, to being a method of controlling costs, allocating resources and understanding the profitability of the various lines of a business. This is done with an enhanced scope to include both factory and corporate support costs for product and customer costing purpose. Today it is because many organizations are still to wake up to the benefits of ABC that a number of key processes they undertake seem to be going astray. Take for example, Customer Relationship Management (CRM). The perception developing in some quarters is that CRM has failed despite the billions that have been spent. The returns have not been justified, even when the projects get completed. There are many potential reasons for these projects failing, but they boil down to the fact that knowing more about a customer is, in its own right, not an automatic route to profit. CRM may give more information on customer behaviour, may identify opportunities to sell, and revenue per customer or segments, but without an understanding of the true costs to serve customers and market segments, there is no guarantee that selling an extra product will create immediate profits or long-term value. While ABC is a management-accounting framework that is driven by the CFO within the company, its benefits are so diverse that the concept is actually domain-neutral. Today, once companies realise the true costs involved in various processes, they are empowered with information for strategic decisionmaking across all quarters. From profitability analysis of products/customers to business process reengineering and shared services management, from capacity planning and resource allocation to transparent budgeting, ABC cuts through various departments of an organization to emerge as a valuable tool in decision-making.

INTRODUCTION ‘The word information’ can be defined as data that has been put into a meaningful and useful context and communicated to a recipient who uses it to make decision. Information is ‘live’ and the same has to be updated all the time and is renewable. It is substitutable and can be made to travel. The all round exponential growth of information makes it necessary that information is stored and retrieved in various fields so that it could be usefully exploited as and when needed. In a competitive market, before deciding about the price of an item, the producer needs information about the pricing of competitive products, sales techniques and so on to penetrate the market. Fig. 2.1 shows various stages of Information Cycle. Input (Data)\n\nProcess (Models)\n\nOutput (Information)\n\nData (Captured)\n\nDatabase\n\nRecipient\n\nDecision Action\n\nResults\n\nFig. 2.1. The Information cycle.\n\nInformation can be defined as the data, which is organised and presented at a time, and place so that the decision-maker may take necessary action. Generally data are processed through models to create information; the recipient receives the information and then makes a decision and takes action, this creates other actions or texts, which in turn create a number of scattered data that, are captured and serve as input; and the cycle starts all over again. Business organisations need a system that helps in gathering and communicating the required information. Management information system deals with the information requirements of the business organisation. Kelly defines Management information system as a combination of human and computer based resources that result in collection, storage, retrieval, communication and use of data for the purpose of business management and for business planning. The\n\n24\n\nManagement Information Systems\n\nManagement Information System is viewed as a means of converting data into information for decisionmaking. Conventional data processing activity transforms data into information. Management information systems are different from the data processing activity. According to Peter Kene, it is the effective design, delivery and use of information system in organisation. Again, T. Lucey defines Management Information system as a system to convert data from internal and external sources into information and to communicate that information in an appropriate form to managers at all levels in their various functions to enable them to make timely and effective decisions for planning, directing and controlling the activities for which they are responsible. MIS is something more than just a computer system. Before the evolution of computers, MIS techniques existed to service providers with information that would permit them to arrive at an effective decision. The computer has added new dimensions such as speed, accuracy and processing of massive data, which permit the consideration of more alternatives in a decision making process. 2.2. NEED FOR MIS It would be impossible for a business organisation to function without information. Information about the internal operations as well as the external environment in which the organisation functions is necessary for effective working of the organisation. Information is used as input for various managerial tasks. Getting the right kind of information, which is made available at the right time, is very important. The MIS provides the information that is required by managers in the organisation for effective functioning. The main purpose of MIS is to provide the information support to the managerial functions of an organisation. MIS is designed and implemented with a view (a) to provide the required information support to undertake managerial activities such as planning, organising, staffing, coordination, control and decision making activities ; (b) to provide right type of information at the lowest cost and at the right time ; (c) to ensure that managerial activities are provided adequate inform"
