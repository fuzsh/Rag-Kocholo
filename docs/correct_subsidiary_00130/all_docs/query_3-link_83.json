        "text": "Click the Devices tab, and select Application from the menu.\n\nFrom the Application list, select Video Vault.\n\nIn the General tab, there are two check boxes available, Use as a vault and Use as a Video Server Gateway. By default, EntraPass selects the Use as a Video Server Gateway check box, all new exacq video server connections connect to any available Video Vault.\n\nIn the outbound connections port, the default value is 35111, exacq DVRs use this port to connect to the vault.\n\nTo establish the outbound connection to the exacq DVR, select one of the following communication options:\n\nIn the IP address field, enter the IP address required for exacq to reach the video vault\n\nIn the domain name field, enter the domain name required for exacq to reach the video vault.\n\nThe Connected Video Servers field displays the amount of video servers reporting to the video vault if it has one DVR linked to it.\n\nTo define General parameters for the EntraPass Video Vault application, see Defining General Parameters.\n\nTo define security parameters for the EntraPass Video Vault application, see Defining parameters.\n\nSelect the Folder tab to specify the video file location and name structure. The settings defined in this window will be reflected in the way the video files will be displayed in the Browse Video Vault window (Video tab > Browse Video Vault).\n\nDestination drive(s): specify the list of drives where video segments will be archived. Video segments will be saved according to the disk space available on the drive and according to order of the selected drives.\n\nNote: Destination drives that are displayed for selection correspond to the mapped network drives on your computer. They differ from a computer to another.\n\nBy default, drives are listed alphabetically. You may decide to change this order according to the space available on each disk. The up/down green arrows allows you to change the sequence of drives to use for archiving. displayed for selection correspond to the mapped network drives on your computer. They differ from a computer to another.\n\nMinimum free disk space (MB): Enter the minimum free disk space allowed before the system sends a message that there is no more disk space in the EntraPass Video Vault and archiving will stop. The value can be up to 99,999 MB.\n\nDisk free space threshold (MB): Enter the maximum threshold space allowed before the system sends a message that the EntraPass Video Vault has reached its disk free space threshold but will continue archiving until it has reached the minimum free disk space. The value can be up to 99,999 MB.\n\nDate field separator: You can define the date field separator that will appear in the archived video directory.\n\nDestination folder: Select the folder that will be used to archive video data. If you do not specify a target folder, no video segment will be archived. By default, video segments will be archived in C:\\KantechVideoArchive folder.\n\nSub-folder structure: Each combo box contains the criteria that will be used to create a sub-directory where to archive video data. For example, selecting Video Server Name will create a sub-directory for each video server where all corresponding video segments will be stored. If you go down further and select Day-yyyy-mm-dd, another sub-directory will be created under Video Server Name to store video segments daily. You can go down to 5 levels of sub-directories.\n\nSelect the File tab to define the file naming convention.\n\nFile name structure: Check the boxes that correspond to the information you wish to include in the file name.\n\nSeparators: You can define a field separator for the file name as well as data and time.\n\nSelect the Process tab to tell the system how archived video segments will be processed.\n\nDefault Video file format for your video archives: You can archive video segments using the KVI, KVA, AVI, IMG or PS formats.\n\nKVI stands for Kantech Video Intellex format. The KVI file contains thumbnail and video context information and places a watermark on embedded.img. It must be viewed with the Intellex Video Player that uses the American Dynamics API. You must make sure that the API has been installed on the clientâ€™s computer.\n\nKVA stands for Kantech Video AVI format. The KVA file contains thumbnail and video context information with no watermark on the embedded .avi. Video files can be viewed using Windows Media Player or any other AVI player on the market.\n\nAVI stands for Audio Video Interlaced format. AVI video files are viewed using Windows Media Player.\n\nIMG is the Intellex native format. Video data are stored in Intellex format (.img) and can be viewed using the Intellex Video Player.\n\nPS: HDVR native compressed video format.\n\nNote: KVI and KVA formats enable users to protect video files with a password and to specify key frames for any selected video event. Key frames offer a fast way for retrieving video segments based on a still image (bmp) representing the whole video sequence.\n\nSimultaneous video segment transfers: Select the number of simultaneous downloads. You cannot retrieve more than one video segment from one video server at a time. However, it is possible to retrieve more than one segment from more than one video server simultaneously. The minimum value is 1; the maximum is 8.\n\nNote: A high number of retrievals requires more network bandwidth. As the flow of video data requires a great amount of network bandwidth, contact the Network administrator for these settings.\n\nVideo segment duration limit: Specify the minimum and maximum duration of the video segment to be archived. The maximum duration is 59 min:59 secs. Moving the cursor over the editable field will activate a hint indicating the minimum and maximum duration. This feature can prove useful if you want to restrict the number of archived video segments. For example, the restriction can be based on the size of the record. For example, you can tell the system to ignore all video recordings with a duration of less than 10 seconds.\n\nDefault password for KVI and KVA file formats: For increased security, check the box if you want to protect the archived video segments by a password. The KVI and KVA formats add the benefit of protecting your archived data with a password. Make sure to enter identical information in the Password and Password Confirmation fields. Operators with appropriate permission for viewing archived video segments will be required to enter a valid password before viewing the video segment.\n\nKantech server polling frequency (m:ss): Using the slide bar to specify how often the EntraPass Video Vault will poll the EntraPass server.\n\nNote: Keep in mind that network traffic will be affected by the polling frequency between the EntraPass Server, Workstations, Gateways and Video servers. Faster polling means higher network bandwidth use.\n\nClick the Significant Frame tab to define the key images that will be used as thumbnails to preview video segments in the directories.\n\nYou must select a setup type:\n\nSignificant Frame: The most representative still image of the video segment. This key image serves as a summary for the video segment. It can be used as a thumbnail, for example, when searching for a specific video segment.\n\nSignificant Frame on Sequence: This feature is used only with dome cameras where a pattern has been set for the camera to follow and the most representative still image of the video segment must be defined within that pattern.\n\nSignificant Frame on Preset: This feature is used only with dome cameras where preset positions have been defined. The most representative image of the video segment can be set taking in consideration the time needed by a camera to move from the first frame to the next preset position.\n\nYou can select one of the Default Key Frame types for each significant frame setup type:\n\nNo image: There will be no thumbnail for this video segment.\n\nFirst frame: The video segment will be represented by a still image of the pre-alarm recording. This automatically enables the Delay for Significant Frame (ss:cc) parameter, which is the delay calculated after the first frame to select the thumbnail image that will represent the video segment. Moving the cursor over the editable field will display the min./max. time range admissible.\n\nEvent Frame: The video segment will be represented by the image that was captured when the alarm occurred.\n\nClick the Service tab to define login information when the EntraPass Video Vault server runs as a service and a report needs to be printed."
