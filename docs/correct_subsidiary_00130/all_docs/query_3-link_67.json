        "text": "A flurry of mergers between software companies in recent years\n\nhas led to a strengthening of the structure of online data systems\n\nknown as business intelligence. Peter Simon, author of a report on\n\nthe phenomenon, tells Carolyn Canham about the\n\nopportunities these developments hold.\n\nPeter Simon is an accountant who has never worked in accounts.\n\nWorking in the strategy unit of the Bank of Ireland, he studied the\n\nCharted Institute of Management Accountants (CIMA) qualification\n\n“to give myself some credibility” and then used the qualification\n\nin corporate banking, credit management, marketing and general\n\nmanagement.\n\nThis background makes Simon well placed to talk about the future\n\nof the finance function as being more about supporting decision\n\nmaking than number crunching.\n\nHe is now employed as a technical specialist at CIMA and,\n\nworking with the institute’s Improving Decision Making in\n\nOrganisations Forum, he has authored a report based on information\n\nfrom members of the forum entitled Improving decision making in\n\norganisations: Unlocking business intelligence.\n\nThe report looks at the phenomenon that is business intelligence\n\n(BI), a term often used to describe the technical architecture of\n\nsystems that extract, assemble, store and access data to provide\n\nreports and analysis (see chart). It can also be used to\n\ndescribe the reporting and analysis applications or performance\n\nmanagement tools at the top of this stack.\n\nBI also relates to company-wide recognition that a company’s\n\ndata is an important strategic asset that can yield valuable\n\nmanagement information and implement change so that this\n\ninformation is used to improve decision making.\n\nSimon says that previously BI information was found ‘piecemeal’\n\nin organisations, but a series of acquisitions among software\n\ncompanies during an 18 month period between 2006 and 2007 has\n\nchanged this (see box p14).\n\nUnlocking potential\n\nThe CIMA report looks at how management accountants can help\n\nunlock the new potential in business intelligence, freeing them to\n\ntransform finance and take on new roles.\n\nCIMA has been promoting the idea of the finance function as a\n\nbusiness partner for years and Simon says that while it may seem\n\nlike an “old hat”, the reality is it has stalled. He says that\n\naccording to consultants such as IBM, Accenture and Cap Gemini,\n\nbusiness partnering happens in the FTSE 100 and in SMEs, but there\n\nis a gap in the middle. In the public sector the results are\n\nmixed.\n\n“It has stalled where there is a lack of shared vision as to the\n\nrole of the finance function because traditionally accountants are\n\ntypecast as the bean counters, as the score keepers on the sideline\n\nrather than players on the team, and some of us conform to type,”\n\nhe says.\n\n“We are not being engaged in decision making with the front\n\nline, because we are not seen as having that skill set, or being\n\npart of the team and many accountants are trapped on the reporting\n\ntreadmill.”\n\nThe BI developments, however, mean the financial reporting\n\ninformation management accountants are producing is “a bit\n\nyesterday for young people in business”, Simon adds.\n\n“People expect that if they are looking for information, they\n\ncan find it on Google within nano seconds, so it is a bit odd to be\n\ngetting information about their own business three or five days\n\nafter the month end,” he explains.\n\nOpportunities\n\nWhile business intelligence has the potential to make some\n\ntraditional management accounting roles redundant, Simon sees the\n\ntechnology as an opportunity, not a threat.\n\n“It’s not the death knell for accountants in business, it is a\n\nhuge opportunity for them,” he explains.\n\nThe report argues that accountants have a significant role to\n\nplay in making the business case for BI and helping with\n\nimplementation.\n\n“Quite often BI projects fail to deliver what they are expected\n\nto deliver because in fairness to the IT community, they can\n\nproduce the right kit, with the right software, but they are not\n\nnecessarily as close to the business as they need to be. There\n\nhasn’t been this owner buy-in to make these things happen,” Simon\n\nexplains.\n\nMoving past menial tasks\n\nBI provides the potential for accountants to be freed up from\n\nmore menial tasks, which links back to more opportunities for\n\nbusiness partnering.\n\n“Of course in terms of continuing professional development it\n\nwill be a challenge for some people to become the business partner,\n\nbut there is a lot of emphasis on that business partner and there\n\nare a range of roles on the team,” Simon explains.\n\n“You are also going to need people who will roll up their\n\nsleeves and understand these new systems, who understand business\n\nprocesses and you need people who understand statutory reporting\n\nbecause that still has to be done.\n\n“But it just seems that the area of greatest opportunity is to\n\ntake your accounting skill set and add to it some commercial\n\nawareness and some business understanding and get out there and\n\nenjoy yourself with a wider career opportunity.”\n\nThe BI report is the second Simon has produced in conjunction\n\nwith the CIMA forum. The first was entitled Improving Decision\n\nMaking.\n\nSimon suggests there is room for a third report, which would\n\nexpand on the nature of the business partnering roles – what they\n\ndo, what they look like, what is good practice and how they\n\ndevelop.\n\nFeeding frenzy\n\nA series of mergers in 2006-07 allowed for the integration of\n\ndifferent systems created by different vendors over the years,\n\ncreating a platform for business intelligence.\n\n• SAP bought Pilot Software and OutlookSoft Corporation and then\n\nBusiness Objects, which had bought ALG Software, Crystal,\n\nFuzzy!Informatik, Inxight and Cartesis.\n\n• Oracle bought PeopleSoft (which had bought JD Edwards), Siebel\n\nSystems, Hyperion Corporation and Interlace Systems.\n\n• Cognos bought Celequest and Applix before being bought by\n\nIBM.\n\n• Microsoft acquired ProClarity Corporation, Navision Software\n\nA/S, Great Plains Software and Solomon."
