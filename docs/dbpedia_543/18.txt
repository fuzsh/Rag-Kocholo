Keyhaven, the recently launched reputation and crisis management agency, has appointed Sir Paul Stephenson as a senior adviser.

The former Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police retired in July 2011, leaving the force largely because of the fallout from the News of the World hacking scandal.

Newly established Keyhaven was spun out of City agency M:Communications in January and is owned by King Worldwide.

John Deverell, Keyhaven's CEO, commented: ‘Sir Paul brings singular experience of an enormous range of crises from his long and distinguished career as one of the most experienced police officers in the world.’

Keyhaven chairman Hugh Morrison added: ‘There is a clear demand for a service capable of delivering an integrated crisis and reputation response. Having someone of the calibre of Sir Paul as part of the team allows us to draw on his considerable expertise and underlines Keyhaven's credentials in helping stakeholders to mitigate against and manage crises.’

Stephenson first joined Lancashire Constabulary in 1975, rising to chief constable in 2002. In March 2005 he was appointed deputy commissioner of the Metropolitan Police Service, becoming commissioner in January 2009.

Stephenson left his post last year after it was revealed the Met had hired former News International executive Neil Wallis as a communications consultant. Wallis, who had become a PR consultant, was arrested last year in connection with the investigation into phone hacking.

Stephenson said of the appointment: ‘I am delighted to make Keyhaven my first appointment since leaving the Met. I have been very impressed by my discussions with John and the rest of the Keyhaven team and am greatly looking forward to working with them.’
