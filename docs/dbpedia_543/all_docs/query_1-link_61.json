        "text": "Tim Godwin has been announced as the new deputy commissioner of the Metropolitan Police Service (MPS).\n\nBy Gemma Ilston\n\nTim Godwin has been announced as the new deputy commissioner of the Metropolitan Police Service (MPS).\n\nCurrently serving as acting deputy commissioner, Mr Godwin said: “I am honoured to be appointed in this role today (July 16).\n\n“Having served in London for over ten years I can think of no job I would rather do.\n\n“I will work my hardest to continue to help to make London a safer city, and will enjoy my continued working relationship with Sir Paul Stephenson as his deputy.”\n\nCommissioner Sir Paul Stephenson said Mr Godwin is an outstanding police officer who has contributed much to policing nationally and in particular, to the Metropolitan Police Service.\n\nSir Paul added that the decision was always going to be a difficult one, but that he was pleased with the choice that had been made.\n\nHome Secretary Alan Johnson made the announcement and said Mr Godwin has been instrumental in delivering safer neighbourhoods across London and in driving major reforms of the criminal justice system.\n\nI know that he will bring a really vigorous commitment to the vital responsibilities of his new role,” he said.\n\nLondon Mayor and chairman of the Metropolitan Police Authority Boris Johnson said the appointment was well deserved and recognised Mr Godwins undoubted abilities.\n\n“A substantial part of Tim`s career has been spent policing London, the largest and certainly the most complex policing environment in the UK, and he has an outstanding record leading the Met`s Territorial Policing, which bears responsibility for day-to-day policing of the capital`s communities.\n\n“This can only be of benefit in this pivotal role within the Met`s senior management team and we look forward to working with Tim to achieve our shared goal of a safer London,” he added."
