        "text": "People in the United States have long relied on public transportation to get to jobs and appointments, go shopping, visit family and friends, and enjoy freedom of movement. As a public good paid for by taxpayer dollars, or a private company subsidized by public funds, local buses and trains have been subject to the same equal access expectations as other public goods. All residents of a community have a constitutional right to equal protection under the law, including the right to ride on public conveyances. However, the struggle for the racial desegregation of transportation has a long history, as powerful whites claimed to control the freedom of movement of people of color.\n\nBelow are some key individuals and organizations who took a stand against segregated transit to afford freedom of movement to all. Countless more examples can be found in the book Traveling Black: A Story of Race and Resistance by Mia Bay.\n\n1863: CHARLOTTE BROWN\n\nMonths after San Francisco’s horse-powered streetcar companies first dispatched their streetcars (with orders to only accept white passengers), African American citizens began to directly challenge this discrimination. On April 17, 1863, Charlotte Brown, a young African American woman from a prominent family, boarded a streetcar and was forced off. Determined to assert her rights, Ms. Brown boarded streetcars twice more and was twice more ejected by the year’s end. Each time she began a legal suit against the company.\n\nIn May 1863, William Bowen, an African American, was stopped from boarding a streetcar. He brought a civil suit and a criminal assault suit. Their legal actions came after the African American community’s successful campaign to remove the state’s ban on court testimony by African Americans. Lifting this ban opened the legal system to challenges by African American men and women in the state.\n\nMary Ellen Pleasant, a longtime foe of segregation and leading supporter of John Brown, brought suit against San Francisco streetcar companies when she was ejected in 1866, and after two years of court battles the lines were desegregated. Learn more.\n\nAfrican Americans in the crowd reportedly shouted, “Let us have our rights,” and “We will teach these d—d rebels how to treat us.”\n\nJones was indicted for “feloniously and maliciously” conspiring to “incite the Colored population of the said City and State to make insurrection by acts of violence and war against the white population.”\n\nOn May 18, the court issued a “nolle prosequi,” or an order not to prosecute his case.\n\nThis description is from Remaking Virginia: Transformation Through Emancipation.\n\nLearn more from the book Right to Ride: Streetcar Boycotts and African American Citizenship in the Era of Plessy v. Ferguson and at the Zinn Education Project.\n\n1868: KATE BROWN\n\nKate Brown was an African American Senate employee in charge of the ladies’ retiring room. As described at Senate.gov: On February 8, 1868, Brown pulled out her ticket and prepared to board a train, to return to Washington from Alexandria, Virginia. As she stepped aboard, she was accosted by the rail line’s private police officer, who angrily told her she must enter the other car. “This car will do,” Brown replied quietly. At that point, as she later told a Senate investigating committee, “the policeman ran up and told me I could not ride in that car. . . he said that car was for ladies.” Of course, Kate Brown was a lady, but she was also African American.\n\nNot deterred, Brown responded: “I bought my ticket to go to Washington in this car. . ., before I leave this car I will suffer death.” A violent altercation ensued. Reportedly, the police officers employed by the railroad physically ejected Brown from the train, throwing her onto the platform.

When the trolley stopped, each climbed aboard the near-empty car, dropped a coin in the fare box and took a seat.\n\nIt would have been a routine occurrence — three men catching a ride home after church on a Sunday afternoon — had the passengers been white residents of Louisville. But they were African American. And for Black city dwellers, riding a trolley was no ordinary act. It was a challenge to the entire social order. Learn more.\n\nOn June 7, 1892, Homer Plessy bought a first-class ticket on the East Louisiana Railway. He took a vacant seat in a coach reserved for white passengers. This act was planned with the help of the Comité des Citoyens and the railroad company, which had opposed the law on the grounds that it would require the purchase of more rail cars. The hope was to bring a case to court that would allow African Americans to ride wherever they pleased. When Plessy was ordered to leave, he disobeyed and was thrown off the train, arrested, and thrown in jail. He was charged with violating the Louisiana segregation statute of 1890. The Supreme Court ruled in Plessy v. Ferguson that the Louisiana law did not violate the 13th and 14th Amendments, ushering in the legal doctrine of “separate but equal” and Jim Crow laws. Learn more.\n\n1906: BARBARA POPE\n\nBarbara E. Pope (1854–1908) was a high school teacher, fiction author, and active in the Niagara Movement. According to research by Jennifer Harris, as reported in The Washington Post, Pope “boarded at Union Station and saw the ‘colored’ compartment was cramped and its seats faced backward. She took a seat in the main compartment instead. After they crossed the Potomac into Virginia, a white conductor came and said she had to move. She refused. He threatened her with arrest. She refused again. . . . Pope was arrested and tried for ‘violating the separate car law of the State of Virginia’ and fined $10 plus court costs.” She appealed and filed for damages in federal court. Read more.\n\nOn April 21, 1937, Illinois congressman Arthur Wergs Mitchell, was told to move to the section of the train designated for African American passengers, in accordance with the Arkansas Separate Coach Law of 1891.\n\nUnder threat of arrest, Mitchell moved to the designated area and filed a lawsuit once he returned to Illinois.\n\nThe ICC dismissed the complaint, stating that “the discrimination and prejudice was plainly not unjust or undue.” He also lost on appeal to the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, which stated that “the small number of colored passengers asking for first-class accommodations justified an occasional discrimination against them because of their race.”\n\nMitchell appealed that ruling directly to the U.S. Supreme Court, where he presented oral arguments himself. The Supreme Court ruled in his favor on April 28, 1941 in Mitchell v. United States et al. However, his political career in Chicago was over because of his having angered the white political establishment.

She refused, but offered to get off the bus if her fare was refunded. Instead of refunding her fare, the bus driver had Ms. Harris arrested for violating segregation laws. Ms. Harris, represented by two Black attorneys, Caswell Jerry Gates and Edward Richard Avant, was tried and convicted in Recorder’s Court and fined $10.00. She appealed her case to the Superior Court, where she received a trial by jury and was again convicted for “unlawfully and willfully” occupying a seat. Gates and Avant immediately appealed her case to the North Carolina Supreme Court, where Judge J. Carson reversed her criminal conviction. He wrote “we do not think the defendant intended to willfully violate the provisions of this act.” Ellen Harris did not stop there.\n\nOn March 31, 1941, Reverend Powell of Abyssinian Baptist Church in Harlem led a boycott against two private Manhattan bus lines, the Fifth Avenue Coach Co. and the New York City Omnibus Co. The bus lines refused to hire any Black people except for the job of a porter. In 1939, Powell had started the Greater New York Coordinating Committee for Employment, an organization that led mass demonstrations for the employment of Black workers during the Great Depression. Powell’s organization, along with other Harlem groups, called for a boycott of the bus lines. After a one-month boycott, the bus lines agreed to hire 100 Black bus drivers and 70 maintenance workers. The agreement also required the bus lines to abide by an affirmative action policy that ensured that 17 percent of the bus lines’ workforce was Black. Learn more.\n\nIn late March 1953, the Baton Rouge City Council passed Ordinance 222, which allowed passengers to fill up the bus on a “first come, first served” basis. This allowed Black passengers to sit in the white section of buses if it was empty. The bus drivers received the directive, but refused to comply. As a result of the drivers’ noncompliance, the Ordinance was ruled illegal because it conflicted with the segregation laws of Louisiana. In opposition, the Black community in Baton Rouge began a bus boycott, led by Reverend T. J. Jemison. The locals developed a “free-ride” network that sustained the boycott. It was a method later adopted by the Black community in Montgomery.\n\nTo end the Boycott, the drivers and city council agreed to a compromise. It stipulated that the two side front seats of buses were to be reserved for whites and the long rear seat was for African Americans. The remaining seats were to be occupied on a first-come-first-served basis. The Black community agreed to the compromise and the boycott ended on June 25, 1953. Learn more.\n\nRosa Parks rode home on a cold December evening in 1955. When the bus driver saw that Parks was seated in a part of the bus that an area passenger referred to as “no man’s land” because it was not designated white or Black, he told her to “make it light on yourself” and let the driver have the seats. Parks had recognized the driver. It was James F. Blake, the same operator who had mistreated her in 1943, and she decided to ignore him and looked out the window.\n\nParks’ decision to stay put was rooted in her history as a radical activist working with the NAACP and the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters. She was a long time activist and in fact, days before, she had attended a mass meeting about the acquittal of the murderers of Emmett Till.\n\nHistorian Danielle McGuire writes: “[Parks’] decision to keep her seat on Dec. 1, 1955, was less a mystery than a moment.” Far from being tired, Rosa Parks saw an opportunity to resist and she seized it. Rosa Parks’ decision pushed local leaders in Montgomery to embark on a 13-month boycott of the Montgomery public buses that ended with the Supreme Court ruling that segregation on buses is unconstitutional. Throughout the boycott, Parks was a key organizer and helped set up taxi services and walking groups that enabled locals to continue to go to work.\n\nOn Dec. 5, 1955 the 381-day Montgomery Bus Boycott began. It is one of the most powerful stories of organizing and social change in U.S. history. Yet many people still associate it with an isolated act by Rosa Parks, without the context of Parks’ own life of activism, the decades of protests of Jim Crow on public transportation across the country, nor the role of the Women’s Political Council of Montgomery. Learn more.\n\nOn May 26, 1956, Wilhelmina Jakes and Carrie Patterson, two students from Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University (FAMU), sat down in the whites-only section of a segregated bus in Tallahassee. When they refused to move, the bus driver pulled into a local service station and called the police. The Tallahassee police arrested both students, charging them with “placing themselves in a position to incite a riot.” In response, students at FAMU organized a campus-wide boycott of the city buses that attracted the support of local community members.\n\nOne local community leader, Reverend C. K. Steele, helped establish the Inter-Civic Council (ICC) to coordinate the boycott. Like the Montgomery Bus Boycott, the organization created a carpool system to provide alternative transportation for local residents and students. Even with much harassment from local police, students and the local community sustained the boycott through December 1956, when the U.S. Supreme Court issued its ruling in a case that originated from the Montgomery Bus Boycott. Shortly thereafter, Steele and other local leaders boarded the segregated buses and sat in seats reserved for whites without being ordered to leave. A month later, the city repealed the segregated seating ordinance. Learn more.\n\nInspired by the Montgomery Bus Boycott, a group of West Indians in Bristol, England, organized a boycott of the Bristol Omnibus Company for its refusal to employ nonwhite workers on its buses. The Bristol Omnibus Company was a national company owned by British Government since 1950. Four young West Indian men — Roy Hackett, Owen Henry, Audley Evans, and Prince Brown — formed an action group called the West Indian Development Council and, along with youth worker Paul Stephenson, planned a bus boycott. The boycott started on April 29, 1963 and lasted for four months until the company reversed its discriminatory hiring practice. On Sept. 17, Raghbir Singh, a Sikh, was the first person of color to be employed by the company, and a few days later two Jamaican and two Pakistani men joined the company. The Boycott was also a key factor in the passing of the Race Relations Act of 1965. Learn more.\n\nIn 1965, D.C. Transit decided to increase bus fares from 20 cents to 25 cents. Marion Barry, who came to D.C. to set up a local chapter of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), challenged the fare increase. He argued that the fare increase disproportionately affected people of color in the D.C. area. Barry and Edgar H. Bernstein, a former member of the D.C. Public Service Commission, also argued that the fare increase only served to benefit D.C. Transit’s return on investment and was an unnecessary increase in terms of cost. D.C. Transit, however, was not swayed by the criticism. In response, the local chapter of SNCC, along with other civil rights organizations including the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) and the Coalition of Conscience, planned a one-day boycott of the D.C. bus system. On Jan. 24, 1966, an estimated 130,000 riders participated in the boycott, causing a loss of about $30,000. The boycott led officials to back down from the fare increase. Barry believed the boycott showed that “the people have power.” Learn more.\n\nIn 1994, the BRU led popular protests against a massive fare hike and obtained a temporary restraining order to stop the MTA. The BRU then sued the MTA with violating Title VI of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, in which the government is prohibited from allocating funds in a racially discriminatory manner. The NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund went to federal district court and the court issued a temporary restraining order against the fare increases. Learn more."
