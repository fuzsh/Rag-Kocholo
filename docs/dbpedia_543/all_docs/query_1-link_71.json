        "text": "Hello, my name is Mrs. Tipping, and I'm really looking forward to learning with you today all about significant individuals who changed Britain.\n\nAnd we're going to explore the question, how did they fight for change? So shall we get started? Let's go.\n\nBy the end of today's lesson, you will be able to explain why Emily Davison, and Paul Stephenson's stories are similar.\n\nBefore we start, I would like to introduce you to some keywords.\n\nWe'll be using these keywords during the lesson, so it might be a good idea to write these down.\n\nThe key words we'll be using today are Suffragettes, arrested, equality.\n\nI'm gonna say those again, and I'd like you to repeat them after me.\n\nSuffragettes, arrested, equality.\n\nNow let's think in more detail about what these keywords mean.\n\nLet's take a look at each of their definitions.\n\nThe Suffragettes were a group of people who wanted women to have the right to vote in Britain.\n\nWhen someone is arrested, they are taken away by the police because they have broken the law.\n\nEquality means when everyone is treated fairly, and in the same way.\n\nPause the video here to make a note of the keywords.\n\nAnd when you're ready to continue, press play.\n\nThese are the learning cycles that we'll be working through together in today's lesson.\n\nHow are Emily and Paul's stories similar? What did they help to change? In the first learning cycle we'll look at how Emily, and Paul's stories are similar.\n\nEmily Davison and Paul Stephenson lived many years apart, and were not alive at the same time, but their stories are similar in lots of ways.\n\nSo we have a photo of Emily Davison here on the left, and an illustration of Paul Stephenson on the right.\n\nCan you think of any ways that Emily Davison, and Paul Stephenson were similar? Pause the video here, and have a quick discussion with your learning partner.\n\nCan you think of any ways that Emily Davison, and Paul Stephenson were similar? And press play when you're ready to continue.\n\nWell, the main similarity between them is that they both fought for important changes to happen in Britain.\n\nLet's take a pause here and check our understanding.\n\nEmily Davison and Paul Stephenson both fought for important changes to happen in France, America, or Britain? Take a moment to think.\n\nHmm.\n\nWhich word finishes this sentence? If you said \"Britain,\" you're absolutely right.\n\nEmily Davison and Paul Stephenson both fought for important changes to happen in Britain.\n\nHere are some important events in Emily Davison's life.\n\nEmily Davison was a very intelligent woman, and she went to university twice.\n\nHowever, when she passed all of her exams, she was not allowed a degree certificate because she was a woman.\n\nMen were allowed a degree certificate, but women were not.\n\nAnother thing men could do in 1900, but women were not allowed to, was vote for the government, and the leader of the country.\n\nBoth of these unfair things made Emily very angry, and she joined a group called the Suffragettes.\n\nThe Suffragettes were a group of people who wanted women to have the right to vote in Britain.\n\nEmily was involved in both the peaceful, and violent methods the Suffragettes used to get the attention of more people.\n\nThey hoped that getting more attention meant that the government couldn't ignore them, and that they would allow women to vote.\n\nEmily was arrested lots of times by the police, and even went to prison for doing things like refusing to move from a street when the police told her to.\n\nSadly, in 1913, she was hit by a horse at the Epsom Derby.\n\nWhen Emily died of her injuries, she became remembered as a very brave woman who did everything she could to fight for women to have the right to vote in Britain.\n\nFive years after she died in 1918, the government in Britain gave women the right to vote.\n\nLet's take a moment to pause and check our understanding.\n\nSelect the statements that are true about Emily Davison.\n\nEmily never went to university.\n\nEmily was arrested by the police.\n\nEmily was a teacher.\n\nPause the video here, and have a discussion with your learning partner, and press play when you're ready to continue.\n\nWhat did you think? Shall we take a look? So it's false, Emily never went to university because she did.\n\nEmily was arrested by the police.\n\nThat is true.\n\nAnd Emily was a teacher.\n\nThat is also true.\n\nWell done if you were able to select those true statements.\n\nSo we've taken a look at Emily Davison's life, and some of the important events there.\n\nLet's take a look at some of the important events in Paul Stephenson's life.\n\nAround 50 years later, Paul Stephenson was fighting for something different to change in Britain.\n\nPaul had grown up in Britain being treated differently, and unfairly because he was Black.\n\nBy the 1960s there were lots of people being treated unfairly in Britain because of their skin colour.\n\nPaul wanted this to change.\n\nHe started working with young people as a youth worker in Bristol.\n\nSoon after this, Paul and four other people from the Caribbean started the Bristol Bus Boycott.\n\nBus companies in Bristol in the 1960s would only give jobs to white people.\n\nThe boycott meant that people would stop using the buses in Bristol until the bus companies agreed to change this.\n\nThe boycott was successful, and from 1963, the bus companies in Bristol began to let non-white people work for them.\n\nPaul knew that more still needed to be done to make life fairer for people of colour in Britain.\n\nThere were no laws back then to say that nobody was allowed to be treated differently because of their skin colour.\n\nIn Bristol, Black people were not allowed into The Bay Horse pub.\n\nSo Paul walked in there one day, and was arrested by the police.\n\nJust like Emily's story, this meant that lots of people heard about what happened.\n\nPaul wanted to get the attention of more people.\n\nHe hoped this would mean that the government couldn't ignore the problems non-white people were having.\n\nIn 1965, the government made a new law to make sure everyone was treated fairly in Britain.\n\nThe law said that nobody was allowed to be treated differently because of their skin colour.\n\nWe still have this law today.\n\nPaul is remembered as a very brave man who did everything he could to fight for everyone to be treated fairly in Britain.\n\nLet's take a moment to pause and check our understanding.\n\nCan you select the statements that are true about Paul Stephenson? Paul was always treated fairly.\n\nPaul was arrested by the police.\n\nPaul was a teacher.\n\nPause the video here, and have a discussion with your learning partner, and press play when you're ready to continue.\n\nHow did you get on? Shall we take a look? So this is false.\n\nPaul was not always treated fairly.\n\nThe second statement is true, Paul was arrested by the police.\n\nAnd the third statement is also true.\n\nPaul was a teacher.\n\nWell done if you were able to select the true statements.\n\nThis brings us to our first learning task.\n\nI'd like you to sort the statements into the correct column below.\n\nSo we have Emily Davison in the first column.\n\nThe second column is both Emily and Paul.\n\nAnd then the third column is Paul Stephenson.\n\nSo looking at these statements we have, was a Suffragette was arrested by police officers, wanted everyone to be treated the same, was a youth worker, wanted women to be able to vote, was a teacher.\n\nSo pause the video here, and give yourself enough time to sort the statements into the correct columns.\n\nAnd press play when you're ready to continue.\n\nHow did that go? Shall we take a look at the answers? So firstly, Emily Davison was a Suffragette.\n\nPaul Stephenson was a youth worker, and both Emily and Paul were arrested by police officers.\n\nEmily Davison wanted women to be able to vote.\n\nPaul Stephenson wanted everyone to be treated the same, and both Emily and Paul were teachers.\n\nWell done if you were able to sort those statements into the correct columns, and well done for completing that learning task.\n\nWe're now ready to move into the second part of our lesson.\n\nWe're going to explore the question, what did they help to change? Both Emily and Paul were angry about something that affected them and other people in Britain.\n\nCan you remember anything that they were angry about? Pause the video here, and have a quick discussion with your learning partner.\n\nCan you remember anything that Emily, and Paul were angry about? And press play when you're ready to continue.\n\nWell, they were angry about different things.\n\nEmily was angry about women being treated differently to men.\n\nAnd Paul was angry about people being treated differently because of the colour of their skin.\n\nLet's take a moment to pause and check our understanding.\n\nCan you match the person to what they wanted to change in Britain? So we've got Emily Davison, and Paul Stephenson.\n\nWomen being treated differently to men.\n\nPeople being treated differently because of their skin colour.\n\nPause the video here, take a moment to think, and press play when you're ready to continue.\n\nHow did that go? Shall we take a look? So Emily Davison, she wanted to change women being treated differently to men.\n\nAnd Paul wanted to change people being treated differently because of their skin colour.\n\nWell done if you were able to match the person to what they wanted to change in Britain.\n\nNow, both Emily and Paul were similar because they fought for equality in Britain.\n\nEquality means when everyone is treated fairly, and in the same way.\n\nIt means that things are equal.\n\nNow can you remember anything Emily or Paul did to fight for equality in Britain? Pause the video here, and have a discussion with your learning partner.\n\nCan you remember anything Emily or Paul did to fight for equality in Britain? And press play when you're ready to continue.\n\nWell let's take a look, shall we? Emily Davison quit her teaching job to spend all of her time fighting for women.\n\nShe became a Suffragette because she wanted to fight for equality between women and men.\n\nAnd Paul, he started the Bristol Bus Boycott, and walked into The Bay Horse pub because he was not allowed in there.\n\nPaul organised these protests in Bristol because he wanted to fight for equality between everyone regardless of their skin colour.\n\nLet's take a moment to pause and check our understanding.\n\nBoth Emily and Paul fought for equality in Britain.\n\nIs that true or false? What do you think? If you said that's true, you're absolutely right.\n\nNow looking at these two statements which would help to justify your answer? They were fighting for the same things to change.\n\nThey were fighting for different things to change.\n\nPause the video here and have a discussion with your learning partner, and press play when you're ready to continue.\n\nHow did that go? Which of these two statements would help to justify your answer? Well, they were fighting for different things to change.\n\nWell done if you selected that statement to justify your answer.\n\nNow, did they both help to change Britain? That's a good question.\n\nWell, they are both remembered as brave people who helped to change Britain to make it a fairer place for us to live in today.\n\nSo yes, they made some significant changes.\n\nWomen are now able to vote, and there are now laws in place so that no one can treat anyone unfairly based on the colour of their skin.\n\nThis brings us to our final learning task.\n\nI'd like you to decide if the statements below about Emily Davison and Paul Stephenson are true or false.\n\nSo they both lived in Britain, and helped to make it fairer.\n\nThey both fought to change the same thing in Britain.\n\nPaul wanted women to be allowed to vote the same as men.\n\nEmily wanted people to be treated the same regardless of their skin colour.\n\nThey were both willing to be arrested to show that something was wrong and should be changed.\n\nPause the video here, and give yourself enough time to decide if the statements below about Emily, and Paul are true or false.\n\nSo put a tick for true and a cross for false.\n\nAnd press play when you're ready to continue.\n\nHow did that go? Shall we take a look at the answers? So the first one, they both lived in Britain, and helped to make it fairer.\n\nThat's true.\n\nThe second one, they both fought to change the same thing in Britain.\n\nThat's false.\n\nThey fought for different things.\n\nPaul wanted women to be allowed to vote the same as men.\n\nThat's false.\n\nAnd Emily wanted people to be treated the same regardless of their skin colour.\n\nThat's false.\n\nPaul wanted people to be treated the same regardless of their skin colour.\n\nAnd Emily wanted women to be allowed to vote the same as men.\n\nAnd the final statement, they were both willing to be arrested to show that something was wrong, and should be changed.\n\nThat's true.\n\nWell done if you were able to sort those statements into true or false, and well done for completing that learning task.\n\nBefore we finish this lesson, let's summarise what we've learned about Paul Stephenson and Emily Davison.\n\nEmily and Paul didn't live at the same time, but both have a similar story.\n\nThey both fought to change something that affected them, and other people in Britain, and wanted equality.\n\nThey were both prepared to be arrested for what they believed in, and to show that something was wrong, and should be changed.\n\nThey are both seen today as brave people who helped to change Britain and make people's lives better.\n\nThank you for joining me in this lesson.\n\nI hope you enjoyed learning about significant individuals who changed Britain and how they fought for change.\n\nI certainly did.\n\nI hope to see you for another unit of learning soon.\n\nSee you then."
