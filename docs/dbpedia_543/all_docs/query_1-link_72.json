        "text": "Rioters who smashed up Britain’s streets in a weekend of shame after the Southport stabbings have been named and pictured.\n\nIt came as courts began sitting through the night to process hundreds of suspects.\n\nRight-wing disorder has now lasted for a week with unrest witnessed across England and in parts of Northern Ireland after three young girls were stabbed to death at a Taylor Swift themed dance class in Southport last Monday.\n\nPolice were injured during “sustained violence” in Plymouth on Monday, while similar trouble on the streets of Darlington saw officers pelted with bricks.\n\nJustice minister Heidi Alexander said some 567 additional prison spaces would soon come into use to deal with rioting.\n\nFormer Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Paul Stephenson told LBC’s Nick Ferrari: “This is the ugly face of racism.\n\n“Racism isn't confined to right or left. Most of the thugs involved in this couldn't spell right or left, let alone think politically.”\n\nSix people have been charged in connection with riots outside a hotel in Rotherham on Sunday, which was being used to house asylum seekers.\n\nOn Monday a boy aged 14 seen letting off fireworks towards police in Liverpool city centre admitted violent disorder and was bailed ahead of his sentencing.\n\nThe teenager, whose father and uncle were in court, has no previous convictions, Liverpool Magistrates’ Court heard.\n\nIqbal Singh Kang, defending, said the boy had been area to catch a bus home, and added: “He did not head into the city centre with the intention of causing any kind of disturbance or adding to the disorder.\n\n“Without thinking things through, he became involved in something much more serious. It’s completely out of the blue.”\n\nAnother Liverpool case involved a balaclava-wearing thug who acted as a “lookout” when a library was ransacked.\n\nAdam Wharton, 28, of Selwyn Street, admitted burglary at Spellow Library, Walton, after it was set on fire on Saturday night.\n\nThe father-of-one has 26 previous convictions appeared in court in a grey prison-issue tracksuit having been attacked in the cells, suffering a bloodied nose and eye injury.\n\nHis brother Ellis Wharton, 22, also pleaded guilty to burglary at Spellow Library but denied assaulting a policeman. He was remanded in custody.\n\nFather-of-three Derek Drummond, 58, of Southport, who yelled “s***houses” before hitting PC Thomas Ball in the face, admitted assault and violent disorder.\n\nJoshua Sanderson-Kirk, prosecuting, said PC Ball was deployed to a mosque on St Luke’s Road on July 30 where a group of around 300 people arrived shouting “this is our f****** country” and “scumbag bastards”.\n\nBricks were later thrown after a garden wall was broken down, the court was told.\n\nTwo women sat at the back of the court for the hearing, one was in tears and the other blew Drummond a kiss as he left.\n\nWilliam Nelson Morgan, 69, pleaded guilty at Liverpool Magistrates’ Court to violent disorder and possessing an offensive weapon in a public place.\n\nThe court heard he was identified in a crowd who were throwing bricks towards officers on County Road on Saturday night and had a wooden baton with him.\n\nHe resisted arrest and shouted at an officer to get off him when he was detained, the court was told.\n\nLloyd Killner, 35, of Lincoln, Lincolnshire, appeared at Liverpool Magistrates’ Court and pleaded not guilty to a charge of violent disorder in Liverpool city centre on Saturday.\n\nDeclan Geiran, 29, of Kelso Road, Liverpool, pleaded guilty at the same court to violent disorder and arson.\n\nThe prosecutor said on Saturday Geiran was seen on CCTV in Liverpool city centre using an “implement” to set fire to a police Ford Transit van which had been abandoned by officers.\n\nJimmy Bailey, 45, of Station Avenue in Little Sutton, Ellesmere Port, Cheshire, pleaded not guilty to violent disorder.\n\nJohn O’Malley, 43, of Cambridge Gardens in Southport, pleaded guilty to violent disorder.\n\nGareth Metcalfe, 44, of Cambridge Gardens in Southport, appeared at the same court charged with violent disorder in Southport last Tuesday and gave no indication of plea.\n\nAll adult defendants were remanded in custody until their next court dates of either August 29 or 30.\n\nAt Sheffield Magistrates Court, Curtis Coulson, 30, sobbed as he sat in the dock and denied affray following disorder in South Yorkshire over the weekend.\n\nThe alleged offence relates to an incident outside Sheffield City Hall on Sunday in which he is alleged to have swung a stick at a woman.\n\nCoulson was refused bail and will go on trial at the same court in September.\n\nSix people have appeared at South Tyneside Magistrates’ Court on Monday and were all remanded in custody until their next court appearances on September 2.\n\nJosh Kellett, 29, of Southcroft, Washington, admitted violent disorder after unrest in Sunderland on Friday.\n\nThe court heard he was seen on footage throwing a stone towards police officers while part of a large group.\n\nHe was wearing a balaclava but was identified by his “distinctive tattoos”, it was said.\n\nAndrew Smith, 41, of High Street East, Sunderland, pleaded guilty to violent disorder following unrest in Sunderland.\n\nShaun Doran, 48, of Villette Road, Sunderland, pleaded not guilty to the same offence when he appeared at South Tyneside Magistrates’ Court.\n\nClinton Morrison, 31, of Saint Barnabas Way, Sunderland, did not indicate a plea when he appeared in court accused of violent disorder over unrest in Sunderland.\n\nLeanne Hodgson pleaded guilty to violent disorder after being seen on footage pushing a large bin towards a police line during unrest in Sunderland.\n\nThe 43-year-old, of Holborn Road, Sunderland, who has a “long-running alcohol problem”, denied being involved in the original march but said she had been out drinking and became involved in the disorder when the pub closed, a court heard.\n\nJohn Garside, prosecuting, said “there was a large crowd cheering and joining in” as Hodgson pushed the bin at officers.\n\nDistrict Judge Zoe Passfield told her: “This was large-scale mob violence which resulted in fear to the public and damage to local businesses.\n\n“There is absolutely no justification for it.”\n\nBrian Gilby admitted taking vapes from a shop in Sunderland that was damaged during the disorder, but denied being part of the protests.\n\nThe 27-year-old, of no fixed address, pleaded not guilty to violent disorder when he appeared at South Tyneside Magistrates’ Court on Monday.\n\nHe pleaded guilty to a charge of burglary.\n\nHeather Bolton, defending, said Gilby denied being part of the protests or of any violent disorder, but was out “socialising with friends” in the city centre when he saw a shop “that had already been damaged” and went inside.\n\nCarl Holliday, 30, of Tankerville Street in Hartlepool, pleaded guilty to violent disorder during a protest in Hartlepool when he appeared at Teesside Magistrates’ Court, a courts spokesperson said.\n\nHe was remanded in custody until sentencing at Teesside Crown Court on September 2.\n\nTamsyn Cerr, 21, of Firby Close in Hartlepool, did not enter a plea to the same charge and was remanded in custody until her next appearance at crown court, also on September 2.\n\nHome Secretary Yvette Cooper has said the courts are on “standby” to ensure “swift justice”, but two men who have been charged with offences following disorder in Bristol city centre on Saturday are not due to appear in court until September.\n\nAdrian Croft, 45, of Holywell, Flintshire, was charged with a Section 4 public order offence and possession of a class A drug.\n\nDamien Williams, 39, of Stockwood Crescent, Knowle, was charged with a Section 4 public order offence.\n\nBoth men have been bailed and will appear at Bristol Magistrates’ Court on September 5.\n\nAnd two people charged in connection with disorder in Stoke-on-Trent on Saturday will not appear at North Staffordshire Justice Centre until August 22.\n\nJarrod Hollinshead, 26, of no fixed address, has been charged with using threatening or abusive words and or behaviour likely to cause harassment, alarm or distress, and Lee Bodman, 52, from Stoke-on-Trent, has been charged with assault by beating of an emergency worker and breaching a criminal behaviour order."
