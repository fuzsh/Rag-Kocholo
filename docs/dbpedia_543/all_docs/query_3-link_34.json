        "text": "Robert “Bobby” Thomas Stephenson, 63, of Goodyear, Arizona, passed away on Thursday, January 14, 2021. He was born August 24, 1957, in Prineville, Oregon, to Thomas and Patricia Stephenson. As a small child his family moved around quite a bit, until finally settling down in Lakeside, Arizona, in 1968. After graduating from Blue Ridge High School in 1976, and later from Eastern Arizona University, he met and fell in love with his eternal companion, Delauna. They were married on August 1, 1981, and began their beautiful family not long after, welcoming four daughters, Brandy, Britney, Brianne, and Brooke. He was the best “Girl Dad,” and never missed a game, band concert, or dance performance.\n\nBobby started his career as a police officer with Show Low Police Department and Navajo County Sheriff’s Office. He landed his dream job as a patrolman for the Arizona Department of Public Safety (DPS) in 1985. He loved being a patrolman. He would always say “it wasn’t a job; it was who he was.” His first duty station was in Page. In the spring of 1989, he transferred back home to Show Low, where he patrolled the roads until 1999, when he was reassigned to the Commercial Vehicle Enforcement Bureau. He then pursued and followed his passion for accident reconstruction, transferring to the Phoenix-based Vehicular Crimes Unit in 2003, where he remained until his retirement in 2008. Following his 23 years of dedicated service with DPS, Bobby worked for El Mirage Police Department for seven years.\n\nAs much as he loved being a police officer, he loved being a Papa more. He had 13 adoring grandchildren whom he treasured. Before retiring, often people would ask Bobby what he was going to do after retirement. He would answer with pride that he was going to be a professional Papa -- which is exactly what he did. And nailed it! He would do anything for his grandkids, from playing trucks with the boys, to painting nails with the girls, or dance parties with everyone who wanted to join. Something all the kids enjoyed and will never forget were his chocolate milk shakes.\n\nHe is survived by his bride of 39 years, Delauna of Goodyear, AZ; daughters Brandy (Joel) of Goodyear, AZ, Britney (Brian) of Loma, CO, and Brianne (Tim) of Spring, TX; 13 grandchildren; his step-mother Judy and sisters Debbie, Kelly, Karen, and Kori. He is preceded in death by his daughter Brooke, and his parents Thomas and Patricia.\n\nServices for Bobby will be held in Show Low, AZ at The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, located at 1401 W. Deuce of Clubs, on January 30, 2021. Viewing will be held from 11:00am to 12:45pm. Memorial will begin at 1:00pm, with a graveside service immediately following at the Lakeside Cemetery, located at 1265 Larson Road. Social distancing and face coverings are requested for those attending the Viewing and Memorial. For those who would like to view the Memorial from home, a Zoom link is provided at the bottom of this page.\n\nYou are invited to a Zoom meeting: Memorial Services for Robert \"Bobby\" Thomas Stephenson\n\nWhen: Jan 30, 2021 01:00 PM Arizona\n\nPlease click the link below to join the meeting:\n\nhttps://us02web.zoom.us/j/81317440188?pwd=TTJpZ3FkNGdQZWQ5MW5lZHlZcktLdz09\n\nZoom Meeting ID: 813 1744 0188\n\nPasscode: 513684"
