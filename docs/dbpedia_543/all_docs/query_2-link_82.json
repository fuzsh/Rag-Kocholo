        "text": "OP\n\nForum Guardian\n\nJoined:\n\nPosts: 4,119\n\nMetropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Paul Stephenson has resigned following the phone hacking scandal.\n\nBritain's most senior police officer said he had no knowledge of the extent of the practice and his integrity was \"completely intact\".\n\nSir Paul has faced criticism for hiring former News of the World executive Neil Wallis - who was questioned by police investigating hacking - as an adviser.\n\nHe said his links to the journalist could hamper current investigations.\n\nSir Paul said in a statement: \"I have taken this decision as a consequence of the ongoing speculation and accusations relating to the Met's links with News International at a senior level and in particular in relation to Mr Neil Wallis.\"\n\nHe added: \"Let me state clearly, I and the people who know me know that my integrity is completely intact.\n\n\"I may wish we had done some things differently, but I will not lose sleep over my personal integrity.\"\n\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-14180043\n\nThey're running like lemmings just now\n\nForum Veteran\n\nJoined:\n\nPosts: 5,444\n\nHe's resigned to protect his pension alright, crafty git. They still don't get what it is about though, big salary and still needs to get freebies from the power brokers. It's all about Murdoch getting place men (sleepers) into every nook and cranny of powerdom and these upper class, clever, numpties think it is ok because the rules are there for us to obey, not them. When I went for a security job I was checked over good style, all my friends were interviewed, parents, the lot. I had to admit all past misdemeanors so that nothing could be used to compromise me in the future, I'd been naughty but they knew about it. It is all about putting yourself in a compromising position. Murdoch's crowd were feeding information from their high powered cronies to their bosses, it's what secret agents do. The thing to do then is create confusion, including lies, to the investigation so as to create an impenetrable maze and they get away with it.\n\nBirkenhead........ God's own Room 101."
