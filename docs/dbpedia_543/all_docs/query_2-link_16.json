        "text": "Home Secretary Theresa May, London Mayor Boris Johnson and Metropolitan Police Authority chairman Kit Malthouse are likely to be in control of the selection process.\n\nWith Sir Paul's predecessor Sir Ian Blair also quitting in controversial circumstances, the pressure is on to find the right man or woman.\n\nHere are some of the frontrunners:\n\nSir Hugh Orde\n\nLikely to become an early favourite for the post having narrowly missed out when Sir Paul got the job in 2009.\n\nThe Surrey-born president of the Association of Chief Police Officers (Apco) was first marked out as a prime candidate after winning praise seven years as chief constable of the Police Service of Northern Ireland.\n\nTim Godwin\n\nThe rugby-loving father-of-one joined Sussex Police in 1981 after spending the early years of his career with the Merchant Navy.\n\nHe joined the Metropolitan police in 1999 as a commander for south London before rising quickly through the ranks to deputy assistant commissioner in 2001.\n\nHighlights of his career include his proud record in territorial policing and led the safer streets initiative, which saw robbery slashed by 30% over three years.\n\nHe was appointed acting deputy commissioner in December 2008 and became the permanent appointee in July 2009.\n\nSara Thornton\n\nMother-of-two Ms Thornton has won praise for her steady leadership as chief constable at Thames Valley police.\n\nAfter rising to the top job in 2007 at the largest force outside London, she was this year was elected vice president of the Acpo by her peers.\n\nHer private life has been subjected to attention amid reports she was in a relationship with a married colleague.\n\nMs Thornton is yet another Scotland Yard veteran, having served with the force for 15 years from 1986.\n\nShe joined Thames Valley Police as assistant chief constable for specialist operations in November 2000 and in August 2003 was appointed deputy chief constable.\n\nSir Norman Bettison\n\nThe vastly experienced chief constable of West Yorkshire Police has previously been linked with the commissioner's job.\n\nSir Norman's 37-year career in policing has taken in three major police forces and a number of national responsibilities.\n\nHis appointment as chief constable of West Yorkshire, in January 2007, saw his return to a force where he had been assistant chief constable for six years in the 1990s.\n\nOxford-educated Sir Norman has also served as chief constable of Merseyside Police and in 2004 became chief executive of Centrex, an organisation providing support and training to all the police forces and many overseas and law enforcement agencies\n\nIn 1998 he reportedly told his staff to monitor online encyclopaedia Wikipedia to stop its users posting rude comments about him.\n\nSteve Finnigan\n\nHas already followed in the outgoing commissioner's footsteps - by replacing Sir Paul as Lancashire's top officer in 2005.\n\nMr Finnigan became acting chief constable before being permanently appointed in 2007.\n\nMr Finnigan, who has previously been awarded the Queen's Police Medal and a CBE, spent 25 years at Merseyside Police before arriving at Lancashire in 2001\n\nThe Cambridge-educated father of two is chairman of Police Sport UK, having been a keen sportsman throughout his career\n\nCressida Dick\n\nThe assistant commissioner is popular among rank and file at Scotland Yard after officers rallied around her in the wake of the police shooting of Jean Charles de Menezes.\n\nDespite her role as ''decision maker'' on the day firearms officers gunned down the innocent Brazilian she has enjoyed a meteoric rise to become the force's most senior woman.\n\nThe Oxford-born officer joined the Metropolitan Police in 1983 and served as a constable, sergeant and inspector before transferring to Thames Valley Police until 2001.\n\nShe was promoted to deputy assistant commissioner before becoming the first female assistant commissioner in 2009."
