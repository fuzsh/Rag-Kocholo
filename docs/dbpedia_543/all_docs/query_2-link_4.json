        "text": "The man who authorised the controversial arrest of the shadow immigration minister Damian Green has been appointed as the new Metropolitan police commissioner, sources confirm.\n\nSir Paul Stephenson, 55, was appointed after a final interview with the home secretary Jacqui Smith and Boris Johnson, the mayor of London.\n\nHe beat Sir Hugh Orde, 50, the chief constable of the Northern Ireland police force, after both men presented their case to run Britain's biggest police force to Smith and Johnson.\n\nStephenson has long been favoured by Johnson, who forced Sir Ian Blair from his post as soon as he took over control of the Metropolitan police authority last October.\n\nBut Orde, who has negotiated his way through the political minefield of Northern Ireland politics and come out with plaudits, was also a strong favourite and was seen by many Met officers as the new broom that could sweep away low morale, bitter infighting and a sense of rudderlessness.\n\nAt one time Stephenson himself believed he had lost the chance to win the top job. In the immediate aftermath of the arrest of Green in December he faced serious criticism over his judgment in allowing it to take place.\n\nThe former chief constable of Lancashire police, he joined the Met as deputy commissioner in 2005 under Sir Ian Blair. In the latter months of Blair's leadership it was Stephenson who was effectively running the force.\n\nBut on the day that Blair left Stephenson was confronted by Bob Quick, assistant commissioner special operations, announcing that he was about to arrest Green. Stephenson challenged him as to the necessity of such an action but the arrest went ahead.\n\nHe faced an onslaught of criticism from politicians on all sides and is likely to face more from a Home Office select committee report into the arrest.\n\nSources said an independent report into the arrest by Ian Johnston, chief constable of British Transport police, found that it was only just legal."
