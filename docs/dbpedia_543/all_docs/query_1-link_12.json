        "text": "In the running to succeed Sir Paul Stephenson as commissioner of the Metropolitan police are:\n\nSara Thornton\n\nThornton is the early favourite. She is chief constable of the Thames Valley force, which covers the constituencies of David Cameron and the home secretary, Theresa May.\n\nShe is said to have impressed them and shares at least part of their modernisation agenda. She has served in the Met and would be the first woman commissioner of Scotland Yard.\n\nSir Hugh Orde\n\nCurrent president of the Association of Chief Police Officers, he ran for the job last time but lost out to Sir Paul. He is popular and charismatic but is said too have clashed too often with the Home Office for its officials to want him to get the job. However, he would be seen as a reasonably safe pair of hands, if prone to maverick tendencies.\n\nTim Godwin\n\nCurrent deputy to Sir Paul, he set up the new phone-hacking inquiry while his boss was off work due to illness. It is known that he did not accept hospitality from News International. He looks the part, but the thinking is the next commissioner will come from outside.\n\nBernard Hogan-Howe\n\nA former chief constable of Merseyside, he is tipped to be the boss of the new national crime agency. Has served in the Met and is currently working for Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary.\n\nPeter Fahy\n\nThe chief constable of Greater Manchester, who has grappled with the force's poor performance. An arch moderniser."
