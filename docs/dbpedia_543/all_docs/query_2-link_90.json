        "text": "I HAVE this afternoon informed the Palace, Home Secretary and the Mayor of my intention to resign as Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police Service.\n\nI have taken this decision as a consequence of the speculation relating to the Met’s links with News International and Neil Wallis.\n\nI met Mr Wallis in 2006. I had no knowledge of the original investigation into phone hacking in 2006 that led to the imprisonment of two men. I had no reason to believe this was anything other than a successful investigation. I was unaware there were other documents in our possession.\n\nI have acknowledged the statement by John Yates that if he had known then what he knows now he would have made different decisions.\n\nIn 2009 the Met entered into a contractual arrangement with Mr Wallis, terminating in 2010. I played no role in the letting or management of that contract.\n\nI have heard suggestions that we must have suspected the alleged involvement of Mr Wallis in phone hacking. I did not. I had no knowledge of the extent of this practice and the repugnant nature of the selection of victims now emerging.\n\nThe contracting of Mr Wallis only became of relevance when his name became linked with the new investigation into phone hacking. I recognise that the interests of transparency might have made earlier disclosure of this information desirable. However my priority has been to maintain the integrity of Operation Weeting. To make it public would have potentially compromised any future Operation Weeting action.\n\nNow let me turn to the reported displeasure of the Prime Minister and the Home Secretary of the relationship with Mr Wallis.\n\nThe reasons for not having told them are two-fold. Firstly, I had no reason to consider it a matter of concern.\n\nSecondly, once Mr Wallis’s name was associated with Operation Weeting, I did not want to compromise the Prime Minister by discussing a potential suspect who had a close relationship with Mr Coulson.\n\nNow let me deal with Champneys. There has been no impropriety and I am extremely happy with what I did and the reasons for it – to do everything possible to return to running the Met full time. The attempt to represent this in a negative way is cynical and disappointing.\n\nHowever, as Commissioner I carry ultimate responsibility for the position we find ourselves in. With hindsight, I wish we had judged some matters involved in this affair differently. I didn’t and that’s it."
