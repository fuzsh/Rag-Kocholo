        "text": "Bob Quick, the former head of counter-terrorism who lead the leak inquiry during which Mr Green was detained, also claims that Sir Paul wrote a resignation letter during the scandal last year.\n\nIn written evidence to a parliamentary committee, Mr Quick, who has since resigned, said that he was advised by another senior policeman, Assistant Commissioner John Yates, to cut his losses and stop the investigation to avoid further bad publicity.\n\nHe claimed that his investigation and his position were weakened by leaks which he believe came from senior officers talking to the media.\n\nMr Green was arrested in November last year on Sir Ian Blair's last day in office and both Mr Quick, then an assistant commissioner, and Sir Paul, who became Acting Commissioner, had applied for the top job.\n\nAccording to The Times, Mr Quick said that Sir Paul had urged him to abandon the inquiry and withdraw from the race to become commissioner.\n\nMr Quick said: “I struck up a conversation and I apologised for all the difficulties we were facing and said I did not count on it all turning as nasty as it had (meaning the media campaign). Sir Paul said words to the effect, ‘It is not fatal you know, you could stop the investigation and withdraw your commissioner’s application and it — it will all go away’.”\n\nThe inquiry into leaks from the Home Office was sparked by a Cabinet Office letter and Mr Quick found that a junior civil servant, Christopher Galley, was leaking material to Mr Green and concluded that there was a need for a full inquiry.\n\nOn November 26, a Gold Group of senior officers agreed a plan for the arrest of Mr Green and the search of his offices.\n\nMr Quick said he told Sir Paul straight away because he was aware of the sensitivity of the situation and wanted to give him the opportunity to veto the arrest.\n\nHowever, after a weekend of bad headlines Mr Quick says Sir Paul had changed his mind.\n\nThe following Monday Mr Quick went to Sir Paul’s office. He said: “Sir Paul looked very anxious and told me he had written out his resignation. I asked him why as he had done nothing wrong. We discussed the situation and it became very apparent that Sir Paul was beginning to position himself against an investigation he had sanctioned and an arrest and searches he had supported.”\n\nA spokesman for the Met said: \"This is former Assistant Commissioner Bob Quick's recollection of events.\n\n\"This matter has been discussed and considered at great length by the Ian Johnston report, the Denis O'Connor HMCIC inquiry and the Director of Public Prosecutions.\n\nThe spokesman admitted that Sir Paul considered resignation."
