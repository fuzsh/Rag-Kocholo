        "text": "The daughter of civil rights campaigner Dr Paul Stephenson OBE celebrated the 60th anniversary of the Bristol Bus Boycott and the Bay Horse sit-in protest. Fumi Stephenson, who lives in Spain, came to the UK last week and attended the annual Diversity UK Paul Stephenson Lecture in Bristol.\n\nShe took the opportunity to visit the Bay Horse pub in Broadmead which hit the headlines after her father’s simple request to enjoy a half pint 60 years ago led to his arrest. Dr Stephenson would certainly not have been the first black person in Britain to have been treated in such a way but the civil rights campaigner, inspired by Martin Luther King Jr and Rosa Parks, protested against the racial discrimination he experienced.\n\nHis one-man sit-in protest at the pub and the 60-day Bristol Bus Boycott were both seen as instrumental in leading to the 1965 Race Relations Act. The legislation outlawed discrimination on the 'grounds of colour, race, or ethnic or national origins' in public places in Great Britain.\n\nREAD MORE: Marvin Rees to be keynote speaker at Bristol's first Paul Stephenson Lecture\n\nREAD MORE: This is why Paul Stephenson a Bristol legend just won a Pride of Britain award\n\nIn 1963, Dr Stephenson, who is now 86, had helped to organise the 60-day boycott of the Bristol Omnibus company alongside Roy Hacket MBE and Guy Bailey OBE. On the same day that Martin Luther King made his famous ‘I Have a Dream’ speech, the company announced it would remove its colour bar.\n\nSpeaking about her father’s subsequent protest at the pub, Fumi said: “This ‘one-man sit-in' wasn't necessarily engineered for a second city campaign, my dad simply wanted to ensure equality in all social arenas. He questioned why it was that the colour of skin bothered people so much they felt they had a right to control where black and Asian people stand in society.”\n\nHer father’s protest and trial hit national headlines. Dr Stephenson was charged for his refusal to leave the pub and accused by the eight officers who arrived at the scene of behaving aggressively.\n\nThe pub manager told him ‘we don’t want you black people in here, you are a nuisance’ but in court, all his charges were dropped and he was awarded £25 in costs. An Irish punter stood as a witness in court and confirmed Dr Stephen’s testimony. The Bristol civil rights campaign was also sent a telegram from the new Prime Minister Harold Wilson, who made a commitment to change the law.\n\nSpeaking about her father’s influence, Fumi added: “I am my father’s daughter, all my life my dad instilled an integral sense of what is right. Like many people today it would be second nature to make such a stand.\n\n“My father’s stand affected our evolving overall national consciousness as regards to race equality. My dad Paul Stephenson had simply had enough of being treated like a second-rate citizen.\n\n“Like the Rosa Parks before him, who refused to leave a bus, my dad wanted to live in a more equal and respectful society. This is a feeling much of us who have faced racism would express.\n\n“Over the years I have visited the Bay Horse pub many times to share food and drink with friends. The actions by my father served all future generations to be able to sit and share food without prejudice.\n\n“It is important we don’t forget what he and others in his generation sacrificed and fought for to ensure we never return to a place of suppression and overt inequality. Never again do we want to see - ‘No blacks, Irish or dogs' Nothing can come of hate.\n\n“Like many of my generation I have enjoyed increased racial harmony. When I look around at all the people in society, in all levels of jobs and positions in society;I marvel at my father’s bravery and all those pioneers who campaigned to change national policy in regards to race relations, housing accessibility and inclusion. How proud I am to be the daughter of Dr Paul Stephenson OBE.”"
