        "text": "Kingston Police had arrested the man hours before the high-profile dawn raid in Purley, led by Sir Paul Stephenson in his fist public policing appearance since his appointment last month.\n\nCovered by a police helicopter, the new commissioner commanded about 80 officers as they swooped on seven addresses in south London and Surrey on Wednesday.\n\nThe raids formed part of Operation Calderwood, which targeted a notorious burglary gang.\n\nThe boys in blue used a battering ram to access the Purley suspect’s home, but found they were beaten to their man.\n\nThe suspect, said to be in his mid-20s, was arrested at 1.30am after allegedly breaking into a commercial property in Kingston. He had not been booked in by the time the raids began.\n\nOfficers nevertheless detained two women found in the Purley house before seizing £15,000 in cash and a purple Aston Martin DB7.\n\nSpeaking after the mix up - which was the first high profile public appearance by the commissioner since his appointment last month - Sir Paul said: “That’s policing.\n\n“This was the culmination of a long-running operation which has seen a number of people arrested.\n\n“This was all about catching villains and making people feel safer in their homes.\n\n“The operation was very professional. The suspect was not there but that's the nature of police work.”\n\nOther items of note recovered during the operation were a homemade magnetic device, believed to be used for removing car keys from hallways through a letterbox, a CS canister and a machete.\n\nNine members of the gang, which is accused of stealing keys to high performance sports cars from posh homes in Kingston, Sutton, Merton and Croydon, have already been arrested.\n\nKingston police Superintendent Paul McGregor said: “This is another example of the excellent work officers do locally in the fight against burglary.\n\n“We will continue to disrupt and deter offenders intent on committing crime in Kingston and ensure that it remains a safe borough.”"
