        "text": "When Boris Johnson said he wanted a \"safe pair of hands\" to run the Met Police the odds on Sir Paul Stephenson shortened within hours.\n\nThe dad-of-three, 55, was seen as low-key rather than dynamic, a leader who would not try to shake up Scotland Yard after the controversial years under Sir Ian Blair.\n\nBut those who believe he lacks the drive to raise morale and restore stability should consider his response to feuding colleagues last year: \"It is time we all shut up and get on with our jobs,\" he declared outside Scotland Yard.\n\nAnd after his 33 years working in some of the toughest policing jobs in Merseyside, Northern Ireland, Lancashire and London, few colleagues were surprised at his blunt, plain-speaking manner.\n\nAnd there was no little surprise yesterday that Home Office sources said the factor behind his getting the job was the fear of a 7/7-style attack on the capital - and that Sir Paul was the man to deal with it.\n\nHome Office sources, who said heightened tensions in Gaza made an attack more likely, added yesterday: \"With the security situation as it is we had to get the best anti-terror guy available.\n\n\"He was head and shoulders above everyone else.\"\n\nBut Sir Paul has a history of working in potential flashpoints.\n\nBorn in Bacup, he joined Lancashire police in 1975 after his brother become an officer. His first arrests were made policing football matches at Burnley, \"when I quickly realised how much people don't like being arrested while watching their team play\".\n\nPromotions followed and by 1988 he was a superintendent. A switch to Northern Ireland saw him join the RUC at the height of the Troubles. That meant building the first bridges between police and Catholics and Sir Paul frequently ignored security advice to meet Nationalist leaders on their terms.\n\nHe took on drug gangs in Merseyside as an Assistant Chief Constable and learned how to tread delicately - negotiating with MI5 when the Security Service was brought in to tackle organised crime after 1996.\n\nAfter taking over Lancashire in 2002, the force was consistently in the top tier of Home Office figures.\n\nIn his earlier years at Lancashire he was called in to review police mistakes which led to the death of 95 Liverpool fans at Hillsborough.\n\nSir Paul admitted being scarred by that work and rarely attends football matches any more, despite being a Manchester United fan.\n\n\"I spent so long viewing hours of video of that hideous, horrific, event I was put off football for a long, long time,\" he said.\n\nIn 2005 he moved to London as Deputy Commissioner where he was so low-profile compared to his flamboyant boss that some officers did not recognise him. One detective still recalls with embarrassment the day he returned Sir Paul's friendly greeting in the lift with a grunt. After being appointed to the biggest job in British policing, none of his 33,000 officers and 19,000 civilian staff will make that mistake again.\n\nMany have considered him to be the effective leader of the Met for at least 12 months as Sir Ian Blair fought to save his job.\n\nThe news the pair had rowed when Sir Paul advised against claiming their bonuses in the wake of the Met's Â£175,000 fine for killing Jean Charles de Menezes raised his stock further.\n\nKnown as \"Rusty Face\" because of his ever present suntan, the 55-year-old has not had to try hard to distance himself from his predecessor.\n\nWhere Oxbridge graduate Sir Ian boasted of wanting to be an actor, Sir Paul yesterday bluntly said: \"I don't aim to be a celebrity.\"\n\nNow, not only must Sir Paul tackle crime in the capital, other forces look to him to speak up on a range of police and crime issues.\n\nThe scale of the challenge is clear but it is one he is relishing.\n\n\"I'm the proudest policeman in Britain\", he beamed yesterday, wearing his plain police jumper.\n\nBut it is an appointment which surprised many who predicted Northern Ireland's chief constable Sir Hugh Orde would land the job.\n\nWhen counter terror cops arrested Tory MP Damian Green and searched his Commons office, it was thought Sir Paul's chances may have been fatally damaged.\n\nHe had several \"difficult\" conversations with Johnson about the arrest of his colleague but impressed him and Home Secretary Jacqui Smith with his defence of the police's right to investigate anyone without fear or favour.\n\nAn insider said: \"Amazingly, he managed to turn it to his advantage.\n\nThat suggests he is a smarter operator than many give him credit for.\"\n\nDetermined to stay close to his roots, he spends as many weekends as possible with his wife in Lancashire, leaving before dawn to be at his desk by 9am.\n\nAnd his wife's work with vulnerable children has convinced him of the importance of intervening early as a solution to knife crime.\n\n\"You have to get to these children early, really early, before they are set on a path which leads to violence, sometimes murder,\" he said. It is also the reason he announced yesterday that tackling teenage knife crime was his highest priority with terrorism. Last year 27 teenagers died in London.\n\nAnd Sir Paul, speaking at Scotland Yard, said bluntly: \"We have got to stop kids killing kids.\"\n\nHe vowed to continue stop and search tactics and called for \"early intervention\". He said: \"We have shown a good deal of progress around tackling knife crime and we are being far from complacent.\n\n\"It can save kids' lives and if it is the right tactic to keep people safe, we will do it.\"\n\nTypical plain speaking, but few will doubt that he will set about the task with the same low-key determination that has seen him rise to the position of Britain's top cop.\n\nMETROPOLITAN POLICE\n\nSIR PAUL STEPHENSON\n\nAge: 55\n\nPlace of birth: Bacup, Lancashire\n\nJoined police: 1975\n\nPromotion: Superintendent 1988; Asst Chief Con, 1994; Dep Chief Con, 1999; Dep Comm, 2005\n\nCareer highs: Building bridges with Nationalists during time with RUC\n\nCareer low: Had to face Boris Johnson after police raids on MP Damian Green's Commons office\n\nSays: \"It's not my job to be a celebrity, it's my job to lead.\"\n\nIt is time we all shut up and get on with our jobs\n\nSIR PAUL ON ROWS IN THE POLICE FORCE"
