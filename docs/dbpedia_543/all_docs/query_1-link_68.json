        "text": "Kiren Rijiju locked horns with Opposition's Akhilesh Yadav, Owaisi over the Waqf Amendment Bill. The Surat Municipal Corporation building, Kolkata's Tollygunge Club, ITC Windsor Hotel in Bengaluru are all allegedly on Waqf land.\n\nA post-graduate trainee doctor was found dead inside the seminar hall of Kolkata's RG Kar Medical College and Hospital on Friday in a semi-nude condition.\n\nHindus in Bangladesh were targeted following former prime minister Sheikh Hasina’s resignation on August 5. Bangladeshi Hindus, who make up about 8% of the country’s population of 170 million, have traditionally supported Hasina's Awami League party, which sparked people's anger after violent clashes between anti-quota protesters and security forces last month.\n\nIn an exclusive interview with India Today, Aman Sehrawat and his coach said that the Indian wrestler will be fighting for a gold medal at the Olympics 2028 in Los Angeles. He became the youngest Indian to win an Olympic medal with a bronze win in 57kg freestyle wrestling event."
