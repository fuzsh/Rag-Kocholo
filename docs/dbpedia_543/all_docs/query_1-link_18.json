        "text": "Sir Paul Stephenson has been appointed as the new Metropolitan Police Commissioner.\n\nBy Gemma Ilston\n\nSir Paul Stephenson has been appointed as the new Metropolitan Police Commissioner.\n\nSir Paul, 55, was deputy to the previous commissioner, Sir Ian Blair, for four years and has been Acting Commissioner since Sir Ians departure in October.\n\nHe was chosen ahead of Sir Hugh Orde, Chief Constable for Northern Ireland.\n\nSir Paul accepted his new post this morning saying:\n\n“I am today an immensely proud policeman, to be entrusted with leadership of the Met and delivering security for the many millions who live in and visit London.\n\n“My agenda for the coming years is straightforward  its about cutting and solving crime, securing our streets, convincing all our communities that we are on their side and delivering the policing they want, and being intolerant of violence in any form.\n\n“Our job is to be visible on the streets, never walking by when help is needed and having pride in our uniform, our badge and the world famous Scotland Yard brand.\n\n“In short, we must deliver. Its my job to lead this and I will both need and expect the support of everyone in the Met to deliver it. Its going to be challenging, but I am hugely excited by it.”\n\nThe decision was made by Home Secretary Jacqui Smith but interviews were also conducted with Mayor of London Boris Johnson, who has given his backing to the new chief.\n\nMr Johnson said:\n\nI am thrilled the Home Secretary and I agree that Sir Paul Stephenson is best man to bring the fresh leadership needed at the Met. I believe he was the clear choice in a strong field of candidates for the position of Commissioner.\n\nI have been impressed with way Sir Paul has conducted himself while he has been Acting Commissioner. I know he has the support of the troops and has shown his commitment to Londoners in a big way in his work to make London safer.\n\nThe Metropolitan Police must overcome huge challenges to make our capital safer and improve the quality of life for Londoners. The threats of knife crime, violence and terrorism are all too real and demand a sustained effort from the Metropolitan Police.\n\nI am convinced that Sir Paul will provide the necessary leadership to tackle these threats, rebuild Londoners` confidence and pride in the Metropolitan Police and deliver commonsense policing.\n\nKit Malthouse, Deputy Mayor for Policing said,\n\nIn Sir Paul Stephenson we have a new Commissioner with an impressive record of tackling crime, successfully leading a large police force and work to improve the relationship between the police and the public.\n\nI have no doubt that with Sir Paul Stephenson at the helm of the countrys biggest police force we will take back the streets, make the capital safer for our kids and improve the everyday quality of life across London.\n\nI am pleased that we have a Commissioner who the Mayor, Home Secretary, Prime Minister and the Metropolitan Police Authority can stand four-square behind."
