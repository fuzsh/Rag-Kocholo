        "text": "A memorial service took place last week to remember murdered North Devon police officer PC Walter Creech.\n\nThe constable was killed on 29 July 1883 in Georgeham village, near Croyde, while attending a disturbance at the Kings Arms public house.\n\nHe was stabbed to death.\n\nPC Creech is buried in the churchyard in Georgeham and the event was attended by around 30 people from the local community.\n\nSuperintendent Tom Holmes attended the special service at St George’s Church on behalf of Devon & Cornwall Police’s Acting Chief Constable Jim Colwell.\n\nAlso present at the memorial service was Police Chaplain the Rev Paul Wright, Inspector Rich Preston and County Councillor Pru Maskell, as well as Deputy Police and Crime Commissioner for Devon & Cornwall Police and the Isles of Scilly, Mark Kingscote.\n\nDEvon and Cornwall Police explained that the service started with a peal of bells and featured prayers and a song by a local artist - allowing the community to pause and reflect on modern parallels and the risks police officers and staff face every day.\n\nSupt Holmes said: “I was honoured to be asked to attend this important memorial service to remember PC Creech, it was a huge privilege and a fitting tribute to our fallen colleague. I am making enquiries to see if we can get a permanent memorial at the church notifying visitors of his gravestone and the events which led to his death. I am approaching various organisations such as The Police Memorial Trust.\n\n“I grew up in the village and my Dad was the Community Constable for Georgeham when I was growing up so there is definitely a local connection for me.”\n\nSadly, organisers of the Georgeham memorial service were unable to locate any of the constable’s family to attend the event. It is believed that descendants may have emigrated to other countries.\n\nDocuments at the Museum of Policing in Devon and Cornwall give more information about the murder of the officer.\n\nThe suspect was a local man who was arrested and taken to the Braunton lockup - however he died before he could face trial in Exeter.\n\nThe public can visit the mini police heritage museum at Tavistock Court Gate building every Friday from 11am-3pm until October.\n\nArchive materials are also kept at sites in Okehampton and Exeter.\n\nFor more information about the Museum of Policing in Devon and Cornwall please visit Devon and Cornwall Policing Museum – Celebrating the history of policing in Devon and Cornwall (dcpolicingmuseum.co.uk)"
