        "text": "Dear Sir,\n\nI am contacting you in confidentiality because I have faith you can help me in a very serious and personal matter. I am a disabled individual and I believe that I have been and continue to be the victim of a brutal, sadistic, and very deliberate torture by the Metropolitan police, including Hammersmith & Fulham police, for well over a decade – as clearly defined by the United Nations Convention Against Torture, the terms of which were subsequently enshrined into UK law under section 134 of the Criminal Justice Act 1988.\n\nThis is that the Met police have been deliberately exploiting my mental health disability in order to cause me extreme psychological pain and suffering, pursuing a personal vendetta against me, contrary to the Criminal Justice Act of 1988. This is an offence that carries a maximum life term for a public official such as a police officer.\n\nIt appears that for at least the last 13 years, I have been pointed out to security guards in hundreds of stores, not only in the UK, but in every European country I travel in. I have photos and video evidence that this is the case. I have used extensive reality testing techniques, and I have not suffered from delusions or similar thinking aside from this for over a decade. Despite the toll this has taken on both my physical and mental health, I have been very stable for a number of years, and become financially independent.\n\nThe issue is not so much whether there is a legitimate justification for this (i.e. it is in the public’s interest) – highly unlikely, given that as we sadly know the police do not have the resources to even keep track of dangerous jihadists and the like. The primary issue is that from the first day, the police have not only not taken the slightest concern for the legal and ethical issues involved in keeping a person with a mental health problem under surveillance in such a manner, but they have exploited it to maximize my suffering, as well as likely in the understanding of the difficulty I will face in being believed (and even believing it myself). This has included, for example, encouraging security guards to point me out to non-security staff – i.e members of the public, to mock my allegations of torture (I have made countless complaints to the companies employing these guards), and to threaten and intimidate me from making further allegations. All the while, it is explicitly or implicitly denied that any of this is taking place (i.e. a delusion on my part).\n\nPerhaps the most criminal and sadistic aspect of it all, is that they appear to be justifying their gaslighting through the fact that I occasionally get ‘suspicious’, distressed or agitated by this. Never, may I say, once ever violent, or even aggressive.\n\nI have tried making complaints to the stores or businesses in question, I have tried contacting anti-torture charities – such as Redress – for help, and have even sought help from legal firms specializing in human rights cases and/or actions against the police for malpractice. Every attempt in nearly 15 years has been futile, and in fact leads to further intimidation and threats from both the police and the subjects of my complaints – such as the security guards employed by the relevant businesses.\n\nAs regards why I am contacting you, as the Right Honourable Member of Parliament for Chelsea and Fulham, not only have I been and continue to be pointed out to security staff, as well as non-security staff in a number of shops in both Fulham and Chelsea (despite only visiting this area occasionally to visit my elderly mother), but there is a particular concern over the behaviour of the staff and management of the Fulham Broadway Shopping Centre. Not only do I appear to have been pointed out there, just as in dozens or hundreds of other shopping centres across Europe, with the consequent abuse, harassment, mocking, and intimidation from the guards, but their behaviour is directly impacting others. For example, in 2019 I witnessed a security guard bending over on the escalator to peer up a young woman’s skirt. I made a complaint to the center ‘administrator’ Giulia Puricelli, who passed it on to the head of security Mark Adedji who appear to have done nothing and they do not reply to my complaints, although on my subsequent visit the security guards in question became aggressive with me to the point I was fearful of my physical safety. Secondly, the behaviour of the security guards – including the TSS (Total Security Services) guards employed by Boots – left me last year feeling too intimidated to collect prescriptions from the Boots pharmacy in the Fulham Broadway for my cancer stricken elderly mother (her prescriptions are now sent to another pharmacy). Again, nothing appears to have been done by the center management in terms of addressing this complaint.\n\nGiven my complete failure to attract any help or even sympathy over the last decade, I have no expectation or faith that this letter/e-mail will have any more success or change anything. However, at least I know, that on the date of X February 2022, a sitting Member of Parliament was made aware of allegations, sent by both registered post and by e-mail, that the Metropolitan police, including the police forces of his constituency, presumably under the direction or approval of Commissioner Cressida Dick and Chief Superintendents Owain Richards and Helen Harper, have been engaging in the brutal and sadistic gaslighting torture of a disabled individual, and that this is clearly contrary to section 134 of the Criminal Justice Act 1988 which carries a life term sentence. That this has taken place over a span of at least 13 years, with no sign of it ever ending until the victim either loses his mind completely or is driven into suicide, continue to directly involve thousands of members of the public in this, as well as the police forces and members of the public in at least 12 other European countries (including countries being brought into the Western sphere such as the Ukraine), and have intimidated and threatened the victim themselves many times, as well as encouraging or inciting hundreds or thousands of security guards and others to do the same. Further, that they have and continue to do this in a manner that harms other members of the public, including members of the public in Chelsea & Fulham."
