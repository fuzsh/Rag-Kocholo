        "text": "A 74-year-old employee of the Federal Emergency Management Agency is accused of using his service vehicle to impersonate a Connecticut police officer.\n\nWalter Dambowsky, of Naugatuck, turned himself in to Connecticut State Police on Monday after learning that a warrant had been issued for his arrest, according to authorities.\n\nDambowsky, an emergency management director for FEMA, allegedly pulled over motorists using his black Chevrolet Tahoe equipped with sirens and emergency lights, despite not being authorized to do so.\n\nOne complainant claimed she was pulled over in June by a man fitting Dambowsky’s description. Wearing a golf shirt with no identifying markings, he allegedly asked, “What was that about?”\n\nWhen the motorist asked Dambowsky if he was a police officer, he lectured her on the importance of safe driving and said he was not going to issue her a ticket. The driver later told police she wished to press charges against Dambowsky.\n\nHe denied to investigators that he pulled the woman over.\n\n“It should be noted that Dambowsky has been accused of conducting motor vehicle stops previously in the town of Naugatuck,” police said in their report, which says the “most recent” stop prior to the June incident occurred in April.\n\nThe earlier stop wasn’t deemed an illegal seizure so no disciplinary action was taken, according to police. They did not provide further details.\n\nCops note Dambowsky is not a member of any police force nor is he a certified law enforcement officer in Connecticut.\n\nA search of the suspect’s home and vehicle turned up dashcam recordings that appeared to have been altered, according to investigators. Officials also found “multiple badges throughout the residence” and paper printouts on topics including the prosecution of civilians who impersonate police officers.\n\nDambowsky was charged with impersonating a cop, evidence tampering and breach of peace, then released on $1,000 bond. He’s expected in court on Aug. 20."
