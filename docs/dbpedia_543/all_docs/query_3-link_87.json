        "text": "Martin James Hewitt is a senior police officer with the Metropolitan Police, tasked with formulating the force's response to the public inquiry into undercover policing.\n\nPolice professionalism and corruption investigations\n\nAs assistant commissioner for professionalism, Hewitt heads the Metropolitan Police's 'Total Professionalism Programme', part of the corporate change portfolio. The goals are quite ambitious:[1]\n\nThe Total Professionalism Programme was initiated in 2012 to raise standards of leadership and behaviour; enhance MPS reputation; increase trust and confidence and change MPS culture to ensure the MPS is the best police service in the world.\n\nAs such he also oversees the Directorate of Professional Standards (DPS), and its Special Investigations Unit. These had previously been part of the remit of the deputy commissioner.[2] The DPS liaises regularly with the Independent Police Complaints Commission.[3]\n\nHewitt also oversees a number of issues in relation to major scandals which the Metropolitan Police have been embroiled in, including:\n\nInvestigating corruption within the Metropolitan Police.[4]\n\nThe 'mass shredding' of Operation Othona documents, an anti-corruption investigation into Metropolitan Police officers in the late 1990s - early 2000s.[4]\n\nLeading the MPS's response to the Daniel Morgan Independent Panel.[5]\n\nAllegations of corruption surrounding the original Stephen Lawrence murder investigation, and the subsequent allegations that information on police corruption had been withheld from the Stephen Lawrence Inquiry of Sir William Macpherson. This led to former Metropolitan Police Commissioner John Stevens being referred to the Independent Police Complaints Commission.[4]\n\nFollowing leaks to the BBC that singer Cliff Richard's home was to be raided by South Yorkshire Police as part of Operation Yewtree, Hewitt denied the information had come from the Metropolitan Police's Operation Yewtree taskforce but said there would be an investigation into the allegation.[6][7][8]\n\nSet up an internal review into the police handling of the inquiry into the unexplained death of Gareth Williams, an MI6 / GCHQ codebreaker. In 2010 Williams' body was found padlocked inside a holdall in mysterious circumstances,[9]. In the subsequent inquest the coroner was heavily critical of the Metropolitan Police handling of investigation.[10]\n\nChairing 'Special Case Hearings' into misconduct of officers as part of his role as head of the Professional Standards Directorate. [11][12]\n\nControversies\n\nUndercover policing\n\nHewitt appeared alongside the head of Operation Herne Mick Creedon in a July 2014 press conference where it was revealed that the Special Demonstration Squad had spied on the families campaigning for justice following the deaths of loved ones. This included the Ricky Reel family. At this conference the line put out by the Metropolitan Police was that there had been no specific tasking of the undercover officers against the families concerned, and it amounted to 'collateral intrusion'.[13]\n\nHewitt spoke on behalf of the MPS, saying that:[14][15]\n\nI can absolutely apologise for the distress that this has caused the families. We need to understand all the facts of everything that has gone on.\n\nI really do hope that todayâ€™s report which is categoric in stating that undercover officers were not tasked to go and gather intelligence directly from the families or directly from those groups that were legitimately supporting their cause, will go some way to reassure people.\n\nIn the July 2014 publication \"Integrity in Policing\" Hewitt formulated the Met's view on undercover policing after three years of revelations starting with the exposure of Mark Kennedy:[16]\n\nThe Role of Undercover Policing\n\nThe Met recognises that this is one of the most intrusive tactics the police can use, however, undercover policing still remains a critical tool in tackling terrorism and serious and organised crime. In the last 12 months alone, operations supported directly by undercover officers have led to almost 1,400 charges for serious crimes.\n\nTo protect individuals including the public, and to ensure successful investigations, undercover policing must operate in a secure and confidential fashion. Undercover officers, all of whom are volunteers, are given a lifetime guarantee that we will protect their real identities. The Met does not want to break that undertaking and expose them and their families to risks of serious harm. This risk should not be underestimated. The Met will hand over all the records we can find to the public inquiry, but we will ask that some of them remain confidential in order to protect both the safety of the officers and others that may be exposed by the deployment, and to protect the tactics used.\n\nIt must also be made clear that undercover policing has already changed significantly since the 1990s. Units like the SDS, which was closed down in 2008, are no longer in existence and undercover operations today are unrecognisable from how that unit operated. There are now much stronger legal and ethical safeguards. Legislation requires an officer authorising an undercover deployment to take into account, and minimise, the risk of interference with the private and family life of people who are not the intended subjects.\n\nThe Surveillance Commissioner, independent from policing and the Met, now has oversight of all undercover deployments and they also now authorise all deployments over one year duration.\n\nThe roles performed by undercover operatives are revealed to the Crown Prosecution Service in all prosecutions.\n\nLet me be clear, it is critical that policing retains this tactic, but we must do everything we can to ensure we remain lawful, ethical and proportionate. We are committed to learning and strengthening the safeguards around operation of undercover policing.\n\nDuring his time as Assistant Commissioner for Professionalism, Hewitt oversaw the creation of the Assistant Commissioner - Public Inquiry Team (AC-PIT) . This was responsible for coordinating and managing the Metropolitan Police's response to several public inquiries, including the Daniel Morgan Independent Panel and the Undercover Policing Inquiry ('Pitchford Inquiry').[17][18]\n\nOn 20 November 2016, Hewitt delivered the Metropolitan Police's unconditional apology to women who had taken a court case against the police over being decieved into relationships by undercover police.[19][20] As part of this apology he stated on behalf of the Metropolitan Police:\n\nI can state that sexual relationships between undercover police officers and members of the public should not happen. The forming of a sexual relationship by an undercover officer would never be authorized in advance nor indeed used as a tactic of a deployment. If an officer did have a sexual relationship despite this (for example if it was a matter of life or death) then he would be required to report this in order that the circumstances could be investigated for potential criminality and/or misconduct. I can say as a very senior officer of the Metropolitan Police Service that I and the Metropolitan Police are committed to ensuring that this policy is followed by every officer who is deployed in an undercover role.\n\nShooting of Mark Duggan\n\nFollowing the shooting of Mark Duggan by Metropolitan Police officers, Hewitt was the Gold Commander at Scotland Yard dealing with the immediate aftermath, assuming overall control within minutes of the shooting reporting to AC Lynne Owens.[21]. In particular he was line manager for the MPS Specialist Firearms Command (SCO19 / CO19) at the time, and as such he appeared in the inquest into Duggan's death.[22]\n\nPhone Hacking\n\nHewitt played a role in the phone hacking scandal as a senior investigator with the 2010 Operation Varec under the AC John Yates, which was the original and now discredited investigation into allegations of phone hacking by the News of the World and other newspapers.[23] On the basis of this investigation, John Yates would - wrongly - recommend to Commissioner Paul Stephenson that there was no further evidence requiring re-opening of previous investigations into phone hacking.[24]\n\nIt is known that Hewitt submitted a witness statement in response to a request[25] from the Leveson Inquiry in the media, however both the request and the witness statement have been sealed for 100 years.[26]\n\nHe went on to lead the 2014 Operation Silverhawk, which investigated the activity of the controversial Sun journalist Mazher Mahmood's role in the collapsed trial of Tulis Constavlos.[27] This investigation came under criticism for not looking at the other convictions based on evidence from Mahmood.[28]\n\nAffiliations & Awards\n\nAssociate Fellow, Royal United Services Insitute.[29]\n\nQueens Police Medal: awarded in the Queens Birthday Honours 2014.[30]\n\nVice Chair, National Police Chief's Council; appointed April 2015, where he works with the Chair, Sara Thornton and fellow vice-chair Peter Vaughan.[31]\n\nCareer\n\nca. 1987-1993: Commissioned Officer in the army,[29] including the Royal Artillery.[31][32]\n\n1993: joins Kent Police, serving in uniformed and detective posts, experience including 'specialist experience in investigation and intelligence both within the Counter Terrorist and Crime arenas'.[29]\n\n2002: Detective Chief Inspector, Kent Police, engaged in transnational crime.[33]\n\n2003 - 2005: Superintendent, Kent Police as area commander for the North Kent Police area.[34][35][36]\n\n2005: Detective Chief Superintendent, Commander of the Metropolitan Intelligence Bureau, Metropolitan Police Service; was the first Operational Command Unit (OCU) Commander for this unit,[29] and appears to have been instrumental in the unit's founding under AC (Specialist Crime) Stephen House,[37] as it was not formally established until 2006/7.[38][39] The unit is noted for setting up an 'Open Source Team', which used social media to glean for information in relation to investigations.[40]\n\n2009: Commander (promoted in May 2009.[41]) Gangs and Organised Crime Command, Metropolitan Police (which incorporates Operation Trident / Trident Gang Crime Command). In this role served as: [29][22] MPS lead representative to the National Crime Agency; MPS lead on Gun Crime; ACPO lead for Kidnap and Extortion.\n\n2012: Deputy Assistant Commissioner (Crime Operations) within the MPS's Specialist Crime and Operations Business Group. Responsibilities included: 'Gangs and Organised Crime, Armed Policing, Homicide, Child Abuse, Rape, Specialist Crime Prevention, PNC and Vetting Bureau, and Strategic Change'.[29]\n\nAnswers to AC Martin Rowley, and has under him Commanders Steve Rodhouse (Gangs and Organised Crime), Neil Basu (Armed Policing) & Graham McNulty (Specialist Crime investigation).[42] Also holds the position of: ACPO lead for Adult Sexual Offences[29][43] and 'national lead officer on rapes and sexual assault'.[44]; and ACPO lead on E-Crime in 2012[45]\n\n25 June 2014: assistant commissioner (Professionalism).[46][7] The announcement stated that he was being appointed 'in a new assistant commissioner role responsible for the MPS response to the public inquiry on undercover policing'.[46] This appears to be referred to internally as Operation Beacon.[16]\n\nApril 2015: appointed a vice chair of the National Police Chiefs Council (the successor organisation to ACPO), where he is also national lead on adult sex offence, and kidnap and extortion.[47]\n\nApril 2016: appointed Assistant Comissioner for Territorial Policing where he has responsibility for local / territorial policing across London, the Roads and Transport Policing Command, Custody suites and and the Criminal Justice division.[48]\n\nPersonal details\n\nMarried with four children; lives in London.[31]\n\nTwitter account: @MartinHewittMPS"
