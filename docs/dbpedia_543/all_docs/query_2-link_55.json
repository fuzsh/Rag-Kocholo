        "text": "The UK's largest police force is facing the most \"challenging\" time in its history, according to its commissioner, Sir Paul Stephenson.\n\nMetropolitan Police officers were being stretched by a combination of budget cuts, violent protests and security threats, he told the BBC's Today.\n\nHe warned budget cuts would leave the Met with a \"significant budget gap\" and the force would shrink.\n\nPolice funding is being cut over the next four years.\n\nThe Met has 53,000 officers and staff and a Â£3.6bn budget.\n\nHe also said the stretch on resources and the challenges the Met was facing are \"not as we've known it for a long, long time\".\n\nAt the same time, Scotland Yard is planning a huge security operation for the Olympics, countering the day-to-day terrorist threat, maintaining neighbourhood policing - and dealing with what Sir Paul says is \"unrestrained violence\" at student protests.\n\n\"When you put all the various challenges that face me and my colleagues in the Metropolitan Police service together, this is as challenging a period as we've ever faced,\" he said.\n\nDiscussing the student protests, he said the force had dedicated more officers to policing the demonstrations, but this was counter to the policy it had adopted for London in recent years.\n\nSir Paul said: \"Just over a month ago, we had some pretty dreadful scenes at Millbank Tower. And I have to say up until then we had the situation where we had been, year on year, cutting back on the amount of police officers we had been dedicating to policing public protests in London.\"\n\nHe said he did not want to get into \"political dialogue\" about the subject of tuition fees but he was aware there was \"clearly a sense of anger out there that's led to a level of violence\"."
