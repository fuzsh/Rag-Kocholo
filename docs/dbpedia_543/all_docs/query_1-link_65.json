        "text": "An Idalou man faces theft, burglary and rape charges for assaulting an 87-year-old woman in her Central Lubbock home last month.\n\nA Lubbock County grand jury on Tuesday indicted Joshua Paul Stephenson on charges of credit card abuse, burglary of a habitation and aggravated sexual assault.\n\nDNA evidence linked 21-year-old Stephenson to the rape of the 87-year-old.\n\nAccording to a warrant for Stephenson's arrest, he put a blanket over the woman's head and assaulted her.\n\nStephenson was already in custody when authorities served the warrant. He had been jailed on Jan. 25 in connection with using the elderly woman's ATM card.\n\nPolice zoned in on him after numerous Crime Line tips pointed to him as the man pictured in a photo captured at an ATM shortly after the attack.\n\nLubbock police believe Stephenson might also be responsible for other attacks in Lubbock, but DNA evidence excluded him as the \"Twilight Rapist,\" who is linked to several sexual assaults and burglaries statewide.\n\nTo comment on this story:\n\nlogan.carver@lubbockonline.com l 766-8704"
