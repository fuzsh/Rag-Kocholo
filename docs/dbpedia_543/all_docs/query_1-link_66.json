        "text": "The advent of and proliferation of \"civilian oversight,\" of police brings about important questions on these entities. Here, I provide my experiences over the years of dealing with both police auditors and civilian oversight boards. Question: If training in use of force is so important for police (and it is), why are these entities allowed to exist with little to no training? Having an uneducated opinion about a use of force incident allows personal agendas and bias to insert themselves. Is this the goal for many of those involved? https://lnkd.in/gyeFf5zT\n\n#repost @behindtheshield911 @downloader_ __ Tony Long and Mark Williams are former British Armed Police Officers. Tony is the author of the book Lethal Force which documents his career. Mark now serves as the CEO of the Police Firearms Officer Association. We discuss their journeys into policing, the power of mentorship, armed unit tactics, organisational betrayal, the media, fitness standards, Britain's knife crime epidemic, the support the PFOA offers and so much more. Pfoa\n\nPleased to share my latest article featured on Police1 titled \"From skeptic to advocate: A detective's journey in confronting hate crimes\" which focuses on targeted violence and hate crimes. Extremists are now seeking to cause mass destruction and death using para-military methods as most are now radicalized on social media platforms in days versus months. Vulnerable communities likewise now include our men and women in policing, who are viciously attacked every day. https://lnkd.in/e-cJ5RrX\n\nIn light of this, I urge the Ontario Association of Chiefs of Police (@OACPOfficial) to take a bold stand on addressing the mental health of their members. The time for action is now. While we commend the ongoing efforts, it is crucial to move beyond mere acknowledgments and take concrete steps to support the mental well-being of those who protect and serve our communities. Operational stress injuries, including post-traumatic stress and suicidal ideation, are real challenges that require more than lip service; they demand action, understanding, and comprehensive support systems. Let us not forget that behind every badge, there is a human being deserving of care, support, and understanding. As we celebrate the achievements of our newest members, let's also commit to ensuring their mental health and well-being are prioritized. The journey of a peacekeeper is both challenging and rewarding, and by fostering an environment that genuinely addresses mental health, we empower our officers to thrive, not just survive. #Badgeoflifecanada #HopeGrowthRecovery #Calltoaction #PAO"
