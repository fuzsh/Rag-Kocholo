        "text": "Jenny Jones AM has written a formal letter to the Metropolitan Police Commissioner to express her concerns about the treatment of the G20 protesters by the police (see below). The Assembly Member first brought up anxiety over the kettling of protesters outside Bank of England and in the Climate Camp in Bishopsgate at the Metropolitan Police Authority’s Strategic and Operational Policing Committee on 2nd April and has since been assured that there will an informal meeting for MPA members to ask questions about the police operation. The next MPA meeting is 13th April at City Hall.\n\nCommissioner Sir Paul Stephenson\n\nMetropolitan Police Service\n\nNew Scotland Yard\n\nThe Broadway\n\nLondon\n\nSW1H 0BG\n\nHaving watched footage from various sources of the G20 protests on Wednesday 1 April, I cannot accept that the policing plan was appropriately designed to protect safety and facilitate legitimate protest, nor that all police officers behaved with complete professionalism, which I’m sure will be a cause for concern for you.\n\nAs you will know the Authority is calling an informal meeting for members to ask questions about the police operation and I shall contribute to that, but in order to be better informed and save time I should also like formal answers to the following questions:\n\nClimate Camp in Bishopsgate\n\nWhat final warning was given to the climate camp people that they were about to be contained?\n\nWere demonstrators allowed to leave during the containment?\n\nThere were reports of confusion at about 7.30pm in Bishopsgate about what the police were meant to be doing – the TSG began to move in and then stopped – why was this?\n\nWhat was the rationale for containing and clearing the climate camp?\n\nWhen did each of these operations take place?\n\nWho made the decisions to contain and clear the climate camp? When were these decisions made?\n\nI have received reports that the police dragged, kicked, punched and hit people in the climate camp with shields to move them away from the area and disperse them. Why did the police feel it necessary to use such force against non-violent campaigners?\n\nDid the police remove the notebook of the climate camp’s police liaison?\n\nIf so, will they be returning it?\n\nPolice kettling in the Bank area\n\nWere contained protesters left for some time without food, water or the use of a toilet? If so, how long was this period? If not, what facilities were provided and when?\n\nWere protesters who wished to leave the contained area prevented from doing so? If so, why?\n\nWhen the police cordoned off the area surrounding the RBS in Threadneedle Street there was heightened violence and criminal damage. Was that foreseen?\n\nWas a Health and Safety risk assessment made of the dangers of extended containment of protesters for this occasion?\n\nThursday 2 April protest in City\n\nWhy did the police contain and disperse the further protest in the Bishopsgate and Bank area on Thursday 2nd April?\n\nGeneral\n\nWhat health and safety risk assessment has been made of the general tactic of \"kettling\" used to police protests?\n\nDid the police take away cameras and phones? If so, what was the reason for that and under what powers?\n\nDid any officers, at any time, cover their numbers?\n\nI trust that you will let me have the answers to these questions as soon as possible.\n\nCllr Jenny Jones\n\nGreen Party Member of the London Assembly"
