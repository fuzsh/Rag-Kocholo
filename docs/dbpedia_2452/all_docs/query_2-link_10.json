        "text": "Peter Shor wins MIT’s highest honor\n\nPeter W. Shor, the quantum computing pioneer, has been awarded the James R. Killian Jr. Faculty Achievement Award, the highest honor bestowed by MIT on its faculty members.\n\nShor is famous for the “Shor’s algorithm” — a method of factorizing large numbers using quantum computing.\n\nWe know that every natural number can be written as the product of prime numbers. For example:\n\n10 = 5 x 2\n\n23 = 23 x 1\n\n1245 = 3 x 5 x 83\n\nAs it turns, the large the number, the longer it takes to find out its unique prime factors. So a number like 189706990289943 will take a long time to yield its factors, even with modern computers.\n\nThis observation is foundational in modern cryptography, which changes all the data that we send through the internet into jumbled encrypted data that no one else can read.\n\nShor showed in 1994 that a quantum computer could do this factorization much much faster than a traditional computer.\n\nNo one was concerned at that time since there was no quantum computer around. Also, quantum systems were thought to have so much noise to make them totally useless."
