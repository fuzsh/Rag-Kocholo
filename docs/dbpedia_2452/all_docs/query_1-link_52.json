        "text": "Nearly three decades ago, a new method for encrypting digital information transformed online security. Dubbed , it exploited a mathematical conundrum: It is devilishly difficult to take an extremely large number and figure out its .\n\nAll manner of sensitive data â state secrets, medical records, the family WhatsApp â are still encrypted using RSA, under the assumption that conventional computers are not powerful enough to crack it.\n\nBut around the same time that RSA came out, American mathematician Peter Shor was already sowing the seeds for its demise. In a landmark paper published in 1994, he showed how a hypothetical computer might break down huge numbers into their prime factors quite efficiently. But it would take a next-level machine, a so-called quantum computer, that could harness the mysterious properties of subatomic particles to speed up the process.\n\nToday, major powers including the United States and China are in a race to build quantum computers capable of breaking the encryption on their adversariesâ secrets. Thatâs not the only potential use for this technology, which some experts believe could revolutionize a host of scientific fields. But quantum code-cracking â being able to do it, as well as prevent it â is a huge preoccupation of national security agencies globally.\n\nRead more: U.S. and China race to shield secrets from quantum computers\n\nTo understand what quantum computers might be capable of achieving, we need to know a little more about how RSA works.\n\nRSA Cryptography\n\n0 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0"
