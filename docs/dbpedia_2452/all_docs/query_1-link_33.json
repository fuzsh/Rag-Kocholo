        "text": "IPAM’s co-founder and former director Mark L. Green and his family established a generous endowment in 2011 to support an annual lecture series at IPAM. In 2017, they made a second gift to expand the series to two per year. Since 2012, the Green Family Lecture Series has attracted speakers of the highest international stature. Their lectures cover topics of interest to IPAM participants, the university audience and the broader community.\n\nThe Green Family Lectures are advertised broadly to the relevant communities. The first talk is meant for the general public. The second “research lecture” is intended for those with a general background in science and math. The third talk is on the lecturer’s current research, and is usually part of an IPAM workshop. The first and second talks are held in a large lecture hall on campus, to accommodate an audience of 200 or more; no RSVP is necessary. With the lecturer’s permission, we video record the lectures and make them available on IPAM’s website and YouTube Channel.\n\n2024-2025\n\nHugo Duminil-Copin: Born in 1985 in Châtenay-Malabry in France, Hugo Duminil-Copin grew up in the Paris region.
