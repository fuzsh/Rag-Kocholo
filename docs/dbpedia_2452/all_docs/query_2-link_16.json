        "text": "World of Occupation - Quantum Information theorist In physics, mechanics and physics before 'quantum' mechanics or 'quantum' physics are called 'classical' mechanics or 'classical' physics. So in physics, 'classical' can be interpreted as non-quantum or pre-quantum. In the world of science and technology, the expectation that we can do something that we couldn't do before is often expressed through \"hype.\" The word \"hype\" is from the title of the song \"Hype Boy\" by \"Newzins.\" I'd like to talk about three things: communication, computing, and sensing. There are hypes that it seemed we could build communication systems that have security that cannot be achieved with the classical methodology of creating a communication system by engineering a physical system with quantum mechanical properties, computing systems that have computational performance that cannot be achieved with the classical methodology of creating a computer, and sensors with measurement precision that cannot be achieved with the classical methodology of creating a sensor. Quantum information science is a field of research that investigates such kinds of hypes. Experimental and engineering physicists who study quantum information science do the job of creating such a system by hand. You can easily meet people who actually do that if you go to the laboratory at the Graduate School of Physics. It is true that they are making progress. In the theoretical aspects, the arguments that you could build a communication system that can achieve security that cannot be achieved classically is quite provocative. The arguments that you could build a computing system that have computational performance that cannot be achieved with the classical methodology of creating a computer and the arguments that you could build sensors with measurement precision that cannot be achieved with the classical methodology of creating a sensor are also provocative. If you are a scientist, you have to ask whether they are mathematically verifiable arguments. You have to ask whether we could 'prove' that the level of security that we could achieve quantumly is really not achievable classically but really achievable quantumly, whether we could 'prove' that the level of computational performance that we could achieve quantumly is really not achievable classically but really achievable quantumly, and whether we could 'prove' that the level of computational performance that we could achieve quantumly is really not achievable classically but really achievable quantumly. Quantum Information 'theorists' investigates such kinds of research questions. Some quantum Information theorists are more in physics side, Some quantum Information theorists are more in math side and others are more in theoretical computer science side. Regardless of there institutional affiliation they share the same research interest - theoretical issues arising in investigating utilities and limitations of quantum information processing devices.\n\nIn the field of computing, the act of teaching transcends mere instruction; it is a dialogue deeply rooted in principles that are both mathematical and technological, principles that are continually evolving. This discipline stands at the forefront of scientific inquiry, embodying the cutting edge of applied mathematics and logic, and is characterized by perpetual development. Responding to the enthusiastic initiative put forth by students and organizers Felipe Vandevelde and Ramonys Santos from Faculdade COTEMIG and through the invaluable collaboration with esteemed colleague Prof. Dr. André T. Cesário (Phd) we are embarking on the formation of a quantum computing study group. In this endeavor, we will temporarily sideline philosophical debates to focus on exploring the reasons why quantum computing represents a promising frontier for the future of computational science, physics, and logical theory. Our aim is to delve into the realm of quantum algorithms and explore the foundational aspects of what promises to be a revolutionary computing paradigm. We plan to disseminate our findings through this platform, with one immediate benefit already evident: the enrichment of our collective understanding in the domains of logic and linear algebra. “Nature isn’t classical damn it!” – Richard Feynman #Computation #Quantum\n\nAbout 100 years ago, there was a revolution in Physics, the birth of Quantum Physics. Today it touches the lives of billions of people. Unlike many discoveries that were clearly attributed to one person or just a few people, Quantum ideas accrued over a century with the first Nobel Prize in field given to Einstein in 1921 and to Neils Bohr in 1922 and contributors to the theory often disagreeing with others. The Physics Nobel Prize of 2022 was awarded towards resolution of one of the issues, to Alain Aspect,John F Clauser and Anton Zeilinger. And the Nobel Prize of 2023 in Chemistry was awarded to Moungi G. Bawendi, Louis E. Brus and Alexei I. Ekimov for the discovery and synthesis of quantum dots. These nanoparticles have wide-ranging applications across fields like electronics, advanced surgery, and quantum computing. This is a one month program designed specifically for children at School between classes 9 to 12. It basically responds to the two questions :Why you should learn Quantum while at School and how could you do it? I began with asking chat GPT the following question : “Why should school goers learn about Quantum while still at School? “ And this was its answer : “ Learning about quantum mechanics in school can be beneficial because it introduces students to a fundamental aspect of modern physics that underlies many technological advancements. Understanding quantum concepts early on can help students develop critical thinking skills, problem-solving abilities, and a deeper appreciation for the natural world. Additionally, as quantum technologies continue to evolve and impact various industries, having a basic understanding of quantum mechanics can better prepare students for future career opportunities in fields such as quantum computing, cryptography, and quantum engineering.” For more details : https://lnkd.in/gm95Yr6Q\n\nWith unforgivable delay, mostly due to superstition (I was waiting for some other good news so yes, stay tuned 😀), I am thrilled to share that the paper we submitted last year with my former advisor and senior group mate, Dr. Carlos R. Ordóñez and Dr. Abhijit Chakraborty, Ph.D.: 𝑸𝒖𝒂𝒏𝒕𝒖𝒎 𝒄𝒐𝒎𝒑𝒖𝒕𝒊𝒏𝒈 𝒘𝒊𝒕𝒉 𝒕𝒓𝒂𝒑𝒑𝒆𝒅 𝒊𝒐𝒏𝒔: 𝒂 𝒃𝒆𝒈𝒊𝒏𝒏𝒆𝒓'𝒔 𝒈𝒖𝒊𝒅𝒆 was accepted for publication by the 𝗘𝘂𝗿𝗼𝗽𝗲𝗮𝗻 𝗝𝗼𝘂𝗿𝗻𝗮𝗹 𝗼𝗳 𝗣𝗵𝘆𝘀𝗶𝗰𝘀 (https://lnkd.in/dXKCVYeW). This pedagogical paper explores the basics of quantum computing from the perspective of one of the leading techniques in qubit preparation: 𝐞𝐥𝐞𝐜𝐭𝐫𝐨𝐦𝐚𝐠𝐧𝐞𝐭𝐢𝐜𝐚𝐥𝐥𝐲 𝐭𝐫𝐚𝐩𝐩𝐞𝐝 𝐮𝐥𝐭𝐫𝐚𝐜𝐨𝐥𝐝 𝐢𝐨𝐧𝐬. It describes the most used trapping techniques and cooling methods, showing how they can be combined to implement basic 1-qubit gates, and the CNOT. The objective of this work is to expose to and train undergraduate students in quantum computing, one of the most exciting and recent applications of quantum mechanics. Finally, this work crowns the time I spent from 2018 to 2020 at the Department of Physics at the University of Houston, and gives me the honor of having my name written along with that of two great researchers. Ad maiora semper! https://lnkd.in/duDevKgA\n\nLearning new new knowledge from #gpt4 university. The amplituhedron is a fascinating and relatively new concept in theoretical physics, particularly in the field of particle physics. Here’s a simplified overview: What is the Amplituhedron? • A Geometric Structure: The amplituhedron is a geometric shape that has become significant in the field of quantum physics. It is not a physical object but a mathematical construct. • Simplifying Particle Interactions: It provides a way to simplify calculations of particle interactions in quantum field theory, particularly in the area known as N=4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory, a kind of gauge theory. • Beyond Standard Methods: Traditional methods of calculating particle interactions in quantum field theory involve using Feynman diagrams, which can become exceedingly complex. The amplituhedron offers a way to calculate the outcomes of these interactions more simply, without relying on these diagrams. Why is it Important? • A New Perspective: It offers a new and potentially more fundamental way of understanding the universe, as it suggests that space and time may not be fundamental aspects of reality but emergent properties arising from deeper geometric structures. • Simplifying Calculations: By providing simpler calculations, it could potentially lead to new insights in quantum physics and help in unifying it with gravity. Current Research and Exploration • Cutting-Edge Theoretical Physics: As of my last update in April 2023, research into the amplituhedron is at the forefront of theoretical physics. Physicists are exploring its implications for quantum field theory and the nature of spacetime itself. • Potential for Unification: There’s hope that concepts like the amplituhedron could contribute to a more unified theory of physics, reconciling quantum mechanics with general relativity. In summary, the amplituhedron represents a shift in how physicists approach fundamental questions about the nature of the universe, potentially offering simpler ways to understand complex quantum processes and shedding light on the fundamental nature of reality."
