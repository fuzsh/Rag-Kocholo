        "text": "Report highlights\n\nPublication on quantum computing has increased steeply since the early 1990s\n\nPublication is international and significant investments are happening\n\nThe top 10 institutions with the highest publication output are located in China, France, Canada, the US, the UK and Singapore\n\nThe two most prolific authors are from Chinese and US institutions\n\nLearn more about tracking current R&D priorities while also monitoring influential trends\n\nAre we at the brink of a second quantum revolution?\n\nQuantum computing is a hallmark \"moonshot\" of a second quantum revolution. Whereas the first revolution enabled lasers and transistors based on rules of quantum mechanics, the second aims to control quantum systems.1,2Â Quantum computing uses quantum phenomena to perform computations. Quantum computing is part of the broader area of quantum information technologies or quantum technologies. Quantum technologies seek to understand how quantum phenomena can be used in computing, communication, sensing and metrology to go beyond what classical systems can do.\n\nFor example, qubits3Â â the quantum version of the classical bit â are not restricted to the pure 0 or 1 of binary digits. Physically a qubit could be realized using the polarization of a single photon, or electron spin, or currents in a superconductor. At the end of a calculation when the answer is read, each qubit will come out as either 0 or 1. But during the calculation the qubit represents both 0 and 1 simultaneously. This is called superposition. This core aspect of quantum computing enables quantum computers to outperform classical computers in some problems requiring intense computation. A second crucial aspect is entanglement, or the superposition of a pair of more than one qubits. This allows a quantum computer to explore a much larger computational space than any classical computer can explore.\n\nThe second quantum revolution is where youâre really using the quantum mechanics to do everything for you.\n\nRay Simmonds, U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology1\n\nQuantum computing has made a big splash across the news in the last few years â from Googleâs 53-qubit quantum computer âSycamoreâ achieving what has been coined quantum supremacy to multibillion-dollar initiatives around the world to develop quantum technologies for computing and beyond. The race is on.\n\nResearch methodology\n\nThis report is based on research and analysis conducted in Scopus, an expert-curated abstract and citation database, in February 2021.\n\nThe search was conducted assuming a limited knowledge of the topic and interest in research activity around possible applications of quantum computing. It began with \"quantum comput*\" to combine a loose phrase with a wild card (*), which accommodated word variations like computation.\n\nTo broaden the search slightly, we added the terms \"quantum algorith*\", \"quantum simulation*\", \"qubit\" and \"quantum bit\" to arrive at the search used for this research trends report:\n\nTITLE-ABS-KEY (\"Quantum comput*\") OR TITLE-ABS-KEY (\"Qauntum algorith*\") OR TITLE-ABS-KEY (\"Quantum simulation*\")) OR (TITLE-ABS-KEY (\"Qubit*\") OR TITLE-ABS-KEY (\"quantum bit*\")\n\nThis report provides search results for document titles, abstracts and keywords. Scopus indexes content from 25,000 active titles and 7,000 publishers, as well as patents and conference abstracts. Scopus enriches data, metrics and analytical tools inform both research and business strategy, driving better decisions and outcomes.\n\nThe search will pick up some documents in related areas such as quantum communication, but also exclude some of the major works in these areas. It could be further refined to include or remove a portion of other areas, such as \"quantum simulation\", \"quantum communication\", \"quantum cryptography\", and \"quantum sensing\". Am ore extensive search can be done to cover the broader area of quantum technologies, but here the focus is more on quantum computing, including quantum simulation.\n\nA brief history of quantum computing\n\nIn 1982, the physicist and 1957 Nobel Laureate Richard Feynman discussed a machine that would operate on quantum mechanical principles to simulate the behavior of one quantum system using another quantum system - a quantum simulator.4 In 1985, David Deutsch of oxford University further advanced the field by proposing a quantum Turing machine (based on the pioneering work of Alan Turing on what constitutes a general computer) and specified an algorithm designed to run on a quantum computer.5 Beyond the realm of researchers in quantum physics and theoretical computer science, the field really took off in the mid-90s. In 1994, the mathematician Peter Shor proposed an algorithm for a real world \"killer application\" of quantum computers. It would factorize large numbers into their prime number counterparts exponentially faster than possible with a classical computer.6\n\nWhy was Shor's result so important? Much of modern encryption, such as RSA encryption, is based on the idea that it is very difficult to factor a large integer that is the product of two large prime numbers.7 While it is easy to take two primes and multiply them together to form a big number, doing the inverse from a large number to find its constituting unknown primes is hard. In fact, so hard that a classical computer might take a lifetime or more to perform the calculation. However, on a quantum computer, if it can be made to operate with a large number of qubits, finding prime numbers could be done efficiently (mathematically in polynomial time), putting the basis of much modern encryption used on the internet at risk, If that hard problem can be solved, what other hard problems might become much easier? Actually, quite a few, including hacking bitcoins and other cryptocurrencies.\n\nPublication rate on quantum computing has steeply increased\n\nScopus search results show a steady increase in research output in quantum computing and related areas, really kicking off in 1994. The growth increases steadily resulting in over 48,000 publication. Especially from 2015 onward there is sa steeper rate of publication.\n\nConcurrent with the faster research developments, achievements in quantum computing in terms of number of qubits used for computations emerge:\n\n2012 â A group at University of Bristol factored the number 21 with Shor's algorithm8\n\n2017 â D-Wave Systems announced the first sale of its D-Wave 2000Q quantum computer; it is not a general purpose quantum computer, but can address optimization problems9\n\n2020 â Google accurately simulated the binding of hydrogen chains and isomerization of diazene using Sycamore10\n\nA significant hurdle in quantum computing\n\nProgress in quantum computing and the broader area of quantum technologies has been quite remarkable. However, we still may face significant hurdles before a general purpose quantum computer is available to tackle, for instance, really large scale factorization into prime numbers or computational tasks, optimization problems excluded. The challenge is that a quantum computer must do its computation, the superposition that allows for the computational advantage breaks down, a process called decoherence.11 The more qubits used, the more susceptible to noise the superposition becomes. This is why real-world quantum computers have been so hard to build.\n\nPhysical implementations of quantum computers today, such as those using semiconduction technology, must operate at close to absolute zero temperature in a highly isolated environment. Related areas like quantum communication (notably quantum cryptography) and quantum sensing do not rely on a large number of qubits to operate. As an interesting twist, while quantum computing may potentially make current encryption schemes unsecure, quantum cryptography would be a way to provide fundamentally secure encryption schemes.12\n\nAre there potential solutions to make computer more resistant to distubances? In classical computing and communication, error correcting codes are introduced to correct for noise; for instance, if someone cannot hear what you say, you repeat your message. Impressive work has been done to generalize the concept of error correction codes into quantum error correction for an overview, see the now classical textbook by Michael Nielsen and Isaac Chuang.13 To correct errors in one qubit, however, requires the use of several qubits, and the technological race is still to scale up quantum, computers for large scale operations. Physicist John Preskill called this the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era as physicist and engineers are still working hard to solve all technical challenges.\n\nAs quantum computing moves toward real-world applications, it continues to be an area for fundamental new discoveries in physics. In 2012, Serge Haroche and David Wineland were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics \"for ground-breaking experimental methods that enable measuring and manipulation of individual quantum systems\".14\n\nTheir work has profound implications for quantum information and quantum computing:\n\nTheir ground-breaking methods have enabled this field of research to take the very first steps towards building a new type of super fast computer based on quantum physics. Perhaps the quantum computer will change our everyday lives in this century in the same radical way as the classical computer did in the last century.\" - NobelPize.org\n\nTop quantum computing publication types are journal articles and conference papers"
