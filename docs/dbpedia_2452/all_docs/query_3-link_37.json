        "text": "I think the best answer we can say now is that nothing was written down formally in any peer-reviewed paper before Shor's discovery; however, there were some ideas floating around on some Usenet forums just slightly before then. Most noteworthy, a pair of Usenet postings by Kevin Brown with a \"joke\" headline entitled \"Can Schrodinger's Cat Factor Numbers\" was published in late February, 1994, which is a couple of months before Shor's breakthrough in mid-April of that year. Brown has been running the mathpages weblog for a while; John Baez was able to point Brown to Deutsch's earlier work but it seemed otherwise not to go much further.\n\nNonetheless, Brown's postings were particularly prescient about at least some of what is in Shor's (and Grover's) algorithm. For example in his first posting he appears to anticipate what we'd now call amplitude amplification (as \"some sort of feedback amplification [that] could be used to enhance the R=0 outcome\"), while in a later posting on the thread suggests to \"repeatedly fire photons\" through slits, and \"restrict our interaction to just the collector screen behind the slits\" so as to \"find a pattern of interference that reveals the superimposed wave functions\". Brown also appears to note that parallelism wouldn't be sufficient but interference is a prerequisite to any improvements over classicality.\n\nBrown has a lovely account of some of the history on his website here. Therein, he does ponder whether Shor was aware of those particular Usenet postings at that time; Shor seems to imply that Brown's postings were not in the forefront of his (Shor's) mind, but he (Shor) was probably very close to cracking the discrete logarithm problem then anyways."
