        "text": "This morning I was pondering one of the anti-Israel protesters’ favorite phrases—I promise, out of broad philosophical curiosity rather than just parochial concern for my extended family’s survival.\n\n“We’re on the right side of history. Don’t put yourself on the wrong side by opposing us.”\n\nWhy do the protesters believe they shouldn’t face legal or academic sanction for having blockaded university campuses, barricaded themselves in buildings, shut down traffic, or vandalized Jewish institutions? Because, just like the abolitionists and Civil Rights marchers and South African anti-apartheid heroes, they’re on the right side of history. Surely the rules and regulations of the present are of little concern next to the vindication of future generations?\n\nThe main purpose of this post is not to adjudicate whether their claim is true or false, but to grapple with something much more basic: what kind of claim are they even making, and who is its intended audience?\n\nOne reading of “we’re on the right of history” is that it’s just a fancy way to say “we’re right and you’re wrong.” In which case, fair enough! Few people passionately believe themselves to be wrong.\n\nBut there’s a difficulty: if you truly believe your side to be right, then you should believe it’s right win or lose. For example, an anti-Zionist should say that, even if Israel continues existing, and even if everyone else on the planet comes to support it, still eliminating Israel would’ve been the right choice. Conversely, a Zionist should say that if Israel is destroyed and the whole rest of the world celebrates its destruction forevermore—well then, the whole world is wrong. (That, famously, is more-or-less what the Jews did say, each time Israel and Judah were crushed in antiquity.)\n\nOK, but if the added clause “of history” is doing anything in the phrase “the right side of history,” that extra thing would appear to be an empirical prediction. The protesters are saying: “just like the entire world looks back with disgust at John Calhoun, Bull Connor, and other defenders of slavery and then segregation, so too will the world look back with disgust at anyone who defends Israel now.”\n\nMaybe this is paired with a theory about the arc of the moral universe bending toward justice: “we’ll win the future and then look back with disgust on you, and we’ll be correct to do so, because morality inherently progresses over time.” Or maybe it has merely the character of a social threat: “we’ll win the future and then look back with disgust on you, so regardless of whether we’ll be right or wrong, you’d better switch to our side if you know what’s good for you.”\n\nEither way, the claim of winning the future is now the kind of thing that could be wagered about in a prediction market. And, in essence, the Right-Side-of-History people are claiming to be able to improve on today’s consensus estimate: to have a hot morality tip that beats the odds. But this means that they face the same problem as anyone who claims it’s knowable that, let’s say, a certain stock will increase a thousandfold. Namely: if it’s so certain, then why hasn’t the price shot up already?\n\nThe protesters and their supporters have several possible answers. Many boil down to saying that most people—because they need to hold down a job, earn a living, etc.—make all sorts of craven compromises, preventing them from saying what they know in their hearts to be true. But idealistic college students, who are free from such burdens, are virtually always right.\n\nDoes that sound like a strawman? Then recall the comedian Sarah Silverman’s famous question from eight years ago:\n\nPLEASE tell me which times throughout history protests from college campuses got it wrong. List them for me\n\nCrucially, lots of people happily took Silverman up on her challenge. They pointed out that, in the Sixties and Seventies, thousands of college students, with the enthusiastic support of many of their professors, marched for Ho Chi Minh, Mao, Castro, Che Guevara, Pol Pot, and every other murderous left-wing tyrant to sport a green uniform and rifle. Few today would claim that these students correctly identified the Right Side of History, despite the students’ certainty that they’d done so.\n\n(There were also, of course, moderate protesters, who merely opposed America’s war conduct—just like there are moderate protesters now who merely want Israel merely to end its Gaza campaign rather than its existence. But then as now, the revolutionaries sucked up much of the oxygen, and the moderates rarely disowned them.)\n\nWhat’s really going on, we might say, is reference class tennis. Implicitly or explicitly, the anti-Israel protesters are aligning themselves with Gandhi and MLK and Nelson Mandela and every other celebrated resister of colonialism and apartheid throughout history. They ask: what are the chances that all those heroes were right, and we’re the first ones to be wrong?\n\nThe trouble is that someone else could just as well ask: what are the chances that Hamas is the first group in history to be morally justified in burning Jews alive in their homes … even though the Assyrians, Babylonians, Romans, Crusaders, Inquisitors, Cossacks, Nazis, and every other group that did similar things to the Jews over 3000 years is now acknowledged by nearly every educated person to have perpetrated an unimaginable evil? What are the chances that, with Israel’s establishment in 1948, this millennia-old moral arc of Western civilization suddenly reversed its polarity?\n\nWe should admit from the outset that such a reversal is possible. No one, no matter how much cruelty they’ve endured, deserves a free pass, and there are certainly many cases where victims turned into victimizers. Still, one could ask: shouldn’t the burden be on those who claim that today‘s campaign against Jewish self-determination is history’s first justified one?\n\nIt’s like, if I were a different person, born to different parents in a different part of the world, maybe I’d chant for Israel’s destruction with the best of them. Even then, though, I feel like the above considerations would keep me awake at night, would terrify me that maybe I’d picked the wrong side, or at least that the truth was more complicated. The certainty implied by the “right side of history” claim is the one part I don’t understand, as far as I try to stretch my sympathetic imagination.\n\nFor all that, I, too, have been moved by rhetorical appeals to “stand on the right side of history”—say, for the cause of Ukraine, or slowing down climate change, or saving endangered species, or defeating Trump. Thinking it over, this has happened when I felt sure of which side was right (and would ultimately be seen to be right), but inertia or laziness or inattention or whatever else prevented me from taking action.\n\nWhen does this happen for me? As far as I can tell, the principles of the Enlightenment, of reason and liberty and progress and the flourishing of sentient life, have been on the right side of every conflict in human history. My abstract commitment to those principles doesn’t always tell me which side of the controversy du jour is correct, but whenever it does, that’s all I ever need cognitively; the rest is “just” motivation and emotion.\n\n(Amusingly, I expect some people to say that my “reason and Enlightenment” heuristic is vacuous, that it works only because I define those ideals to be the ones that pick the right side. Meanwhile, I expect others to say that the heuristic is wrong and to offer counterexamples.)\n\nAnyway, maybe this generalizes. Sure, a call to “stand on the right side of history” could do nontrivial work, but only in the same way that a call to buy Bitcoin in 2011 could—namely, for those who’ve already concluded that buying Bitcoin is a golden opportunity, but haven’t yet gotten around to buying it. Such a call does nothing for anyone who’s already considered the question and come down on the opposite side of it. The abuse of “arc of the moral universe” rhetoric—i.e., the calling down of history’s judgment in favor of X, even though you know full well that your listeners see themselves as having consulted history’s judgment just as earnestly as you did, and gotten back not(X) instead—yeah, that’s risen to be one of my biggest pet peeves. If I ever slip up and indulge in it, please tell me and I’ll stop.\n\nQ1: Who will you be voting for in November?\n\nA: Kamala Harris (and mainstream Democrats all down the ballot), of course.\n\nQ2: Of course?\n\nA: If the alternative is Trump, I would’ve voted for Biden’s rotting corpse. Or for Hunter Biden. Or for…\n\nQ3: Why can’t you see this is just your Trump Derangement Syndrome talking?\n\nA: Look, my basic moral commitments remain pretty much as they’ve been since childhood. Namely, that I’m on the side of reason, Enlightenment, scientific and technological progress, secular government, pragmatism, democracy, individual liberty, justice, intellectual honesty, an American-led peaceful world order, preservation of the natural world, mitigation of existential risks, and human flourishing. (Crazy and radical, I know.)\n\nOnly when choosing between candidates who all espouse such values, do I even get the luxury of judging them on any lower-order bits. Sadly, I don’t have that luxury today. Trump’s values, such as they are, would seem to be “America First,” protectionism, vengeance, humiliation of enemies, winning at all costs, authoritarianism, the veneration of foreign autocrats, and the veneration of himself. No amount of squinting can ever reconcile those with the values I listed before.\n\nQ4: Is that all that’s wrong with him?\n\nA: No, there are also the lies, and worst of all the “Big Lie.” Trump is the first president in US history to incite a mob to try to overturn the results of an election. He was serious! He very nearly succeeded, and probably would have, had Mike Pence been someone else. It’s now inarguable that Trump rejects the basic rules of our system, or “accepts” them only when he wins. We’re numb from having heard it so many times, but it’s a big deal, as big a deal as the Civil War was.\n\nQ5: Oh, so this is about your precious “democracy.” Why do you care? Haven’t you of all people learned that the masses are mostly idiots and bullies, who don’t deserve power? As Curtis Yarvin keeps trying to explain to you, instead of “democracy,” you should want a benevolent king or dictator-CEO, who could offer a privileged position to the competent scientists like yourself.\n\nA: Yeah, so how many examples does history furnish where that worked out well? I suppose you might make a partial case for Napoleon, or Ataturk? More to the point: even if benevolent, science-and-reason-loving authoritarian strongmen are possible in theory, do you really expect me to believe that Trump could be one of them? I still love how Scott Alexander put it in 2016:\n\nCan anyone honestly say that Trump or his movement promote epistemic virtue? That in the long-term, we’ll be glad that we encouraged this sort of thing, that we gave it power and attention and all the nutrients it needed to grow? That the road to whatever vision of a just and rational society we imagine, something quiet and austere with a lot of old-growth trees and Greek-looking columns, runs through LOCK HER UP?\n\nI don’t like having to vote for the lesser of two evils. But at least I feel like I know who it is.\n\nQ6: But what about J. D. Vance? He got his start in Silicon Valley, was championed by Peter Thiel, and is obviously highly intelligent. Doesn’t he seem like someone who might listen to and empower tech nerds like yourself?\n\nA: Who can say what J. D. Vance believes? Here are a few choice quotes of his from eight years ago:\n\nI’m obviously outraged at Trump’s rhetoric, and I worry most of all about how welcome Muslim citizens feel in their own country. But I also think that people have always believed crazy shit (I remember a poll from a few years back suggesting that a near majority of democratic voters blame ‘the Jews’ for the financial crisis). And there have always been demagogues willing to exploit the people who believe crazy shit.\n\nThe more white people feel like voting for trump, the more black people will suffer. I really believe that.\n\n[Trump is] just a bad man. A morally reprehensible human being.\n\nTo get from that to being Trump’s running mate is a Simone-Biles-like feat of moral acrobatics. Vance reminds me of the famous saying by L. Ron Hubbard from his pre-Dianetics days: “If a man really wants to make a million dollars, the best way would be to start his own religion.” (And I feel like Harris’s whole campaign strategy should just be to replay Vance’s earlier musings in wall-to-wall ads while emphasizing her agreement with them.) No, Vance is not someone I trust to share my values, if he has values at all.\n\nQ7: What about the other side’s values, or lack thereof? I mean, don’t you care that the whole Democratic establishment—including Harris—colluded to cover up that Biden was senile and cognitively unfit to be president now, let alone for another term?\n\nA: Look, we’ve all seen what happens as a relative gets old. It’s gradual. It’s hard for anyone to say at which specific moment they can no longer drive a car, or be President of the United States, or whatever. This means that I don’t necessarily read evil intent into the attempts to cover up Biden’s decline—merely an epic, catastrophic failure of foresight. That failure of foresight itself would’ve been a huge deal in normal circumstances, but these are not normal circumstances—not if you believe, as I do, that the alternative is the beginning of the end of a 250-year-old democratic experiment.\n\nQ8: Oh stop being so melodramatic. What terrible thing happened to you because of Trump’s first term? Did you lose your job? Did fascist goons rough you up in the street?\n\nA: Well, my Iranian PhD student came close to having his visa revoked, and it became all but impossible to recruit PhD students from China. That sucked, since I care about my students’ welfare like I care about my own. Also, the downfall of Roe v. Wade, which enabled Texas’ draconian new abortion laws, made it much harder for us to recruit faculty at UT Austin. But I doubt any of that will impress you. “Go recruit American students,” you’ll say. “Go recruit conservative faculty who are fine with abortion being banned.”\n\nThe real issue is that Trump was severely restrained in his first term, by being surrounded by people who (even if, in many cases, they started out loyal to him) were also somewhat sane and valued the survival of the Republic. Alas, he learned from that, and he won’t repeat that mistake the next time.\n\nQ9: Why do you care so much about Trump’s lies? Don’t you realize that all politicians lie?\n\nA: Yes, but there are importantly different kinds of lies. There are white lies. There are scheming, 20-dimensional Machiavellian lies, like a secret agent’s cover story (or is that only in fiction?). There are the farcical, desperate, ever-shifting lies of the murderer to the police detective or the cheating undergrad to the professor. And then there are the lies of bullies and mob bosses and populist autocrats, which are special and worse.\n\nThese last, call them power-lies, are distinguished by the fact that they aren’t even helped by plausibility. Often, as with conspiracy theories (which strongly overlap with power-lies), the more absurd the better. Obama was born in Kenya. Trump’s crowd was the biggest in history. The 2020 election was stolen by a shadowy conspiracy involving George Soros and Dominion and Venezuela.\n\nThe central goal of a power-lie is just to demonstrate your power to coerce others into repeating it, much like with the Party making Winston Smith affirm 2+2=5, or Petruchio making Katharina call the sun the moon in The Taming of the Shrew. A closely-related goal is as a loyalty test for your own retinue.\n\nIt’s Trump’s embrace of the power-lie that puts him beyond the pale for me.\n\nQ10: But Scott, we haven’t even played our “Trump” card yet. Starting on October 7, 2023, did you not witness thousands of your supposed allies, the educated secular progressives on “the right side of history,” cheer the sadistic mass-murder of Jews—or at least, make endless excuses for those who did? Did this not destabilize your entire worldview? Will you actually vote for a party half of which seems at peace with the prospect of your family members’ physical annihilation? Or will you finally see who your real friends now are: Arkansas MAGA hillbillies who pray for your people’s survival?\n\nA: Ah, this is your first slash that’s actually drawn blood. I won’t pretend that the takeover of part of the US progressive coalition by literal Hamasniks hasn’t been one of the most terrifying experiences of my life. Yes, if I had to be ruled by either (a) a corrupt authoritarian demagogue or (b) an idiot college student chanting for “Intifada Revolution,” I’d be paralyzed. So it’s lucky that I don’t face that choice! I get to vote, once more, for a rather boring mainstream Democrat—alongside at least 70% of American Jews. The idea of Harris as an antisemite would be ludicrous even if she didn’t have a Jewish husband or wasn’t strongly considering a pro-Israel Jew as her running mate.\n\nQ11: Sure, Kamala Harris might mouth all the right platitudes about Israel having a right to defend itself, but she’ll constantly pressure Israel to make concessions to Hamas and Hezbollah. She’ll turn a blind eye to Iran’s imminent nuclearization. Why don’t you stay up at night worrying that, if you vote for a useful idiot like her, you’ll have Israel’s annihilation and a second Holocaust on your conscience forever?\n\nA: Look, oftentimes—whenever, for example, I’m spending hours reading anti-Zionists on Twitter—I feel like there’s no limit to how intensely Zionist I am. On reflection, though, there is a limit. Namely, I’m not going to be more Zionist than the vast majority of my Israeli friends and colleagues—the ones who served in the IDF, who in some cases did reserve duty in Gaza, who prop up the Israeli economy with their taxes, and who will face the consequences of whatever happens more directly than I will. With few exceptions, these friends despise the Trump/Bibi alliance with white-hot rage, and they desperately want more moderate leadership in both countries.\n\nQ12: Suppose I concede that Kamala is OK on Israel. We both know that she’s not the future of the Democratic Party, any more than Biden is. The future is what we all saw on campuses this spring. “Houthis Houthis make us proud, turn another ship around.” How can you vote for a party whose rising generation seems to want you and your family dead?\n\nA: Let me ask you something. When Trump won in 2016, did that check the power of the campus radicals? Or as Scott Alexander prophesied at the time, did it energize and embolden them like nothing else, by dramatically confirming their theology of a planet held hostage by the bullying, misogynistic rich white males? I fundamentally reject your premise that, if I’m terrified of crazy left-wing extremists, then a good response is to vote for the craziest right-wing extremists I can find, in hopes that the two will somehow cancel each other out. Instead I should support a coherent Enlightenment alternative to radicalism, or the closest thing to that available.\n\nQ13: Even leaving aside Israel, how can you not be terrified by what the Left has become? Which side denounced you on social media a decade ago, as a misogynist monster who wanted all women to be his sex slaves? Which side tried to ruin your life and career? Did we, the online rightists, do that? No. We did not. We did nothing worse to you than bemusedly tell you to man up, grow a pair, and stop pleading for sympathy from feminists who will hate you no matter what.\n\nA: I’ll answer with a little digression. Back in 2017, when Kamala Harris was in the Senate, her office invited me to DC to meet with them to provide advice about the National Quantum Initiative Act, which Kamala was then spearheading. Kamala herself sent regrets that she couldn’t meet me, because she had to be at the Kavanaugh hearings. I have (nerdy, male) friends who did meet her about tech policy and came away with positive impressions.\n\nAnd, I dunno, does that sound like someone who wants me dead for the crime of having been born a nerdy heterosexual male? Or having awkwardly and ineptly asked women on dates, including the one who became my wife? OK, maybe Amanda Marcotte wants me dead for those crimes. Maybe Arthur Chu does (is he still around?). Good that they’re not running for president then.\n\nQ14: Let me try one more time to show you how much your own party hates you. Which side has been at constant war against the SAT and other standardized tests, and merit-based college admissions, and gifted programs, and academic tracking and acceleration, and STEM magnet schools, and every single other measure by which future young Scott Aaronsons (and Saket Agrawals) might achieve their dreams in life? Has that been our side, or theirs?\n\nA: To be honest, I haven’t seen the Trump or Harris campaigns take any position on any of these issues. Even if they did, there’s very little that the federal government can do: these battles happen in individual states and cities and counties and universities. So I’ll vote for Harris while continuing to advocate for what I think is right in education policy.\n\nQ15: Can you not see that Kamala Harris is a vapid, power-seeking bureaucratic machine—that she has no fixed principles at all? For godsakes, she all but condemned Biden as a racist in the 2020 primary, then agreed to serve as his running mate!\n\nA: I mean, she surely has more principles than Vance does. As far as I can tell, for example, she’s genuinely for abortion rights (as I am). Even if she believed in nothing, though, better a cardboard cutout on which values I recognize are written, than a flesh-and-blood person shouting values that horrify me.\n\nQ16: What, if anything, could Republicans do to get you to vote for them?\n\nA: Reject all nutty conspiracy theories. Fully, 100% commit to the peaceful transfer of power. Acknowledge the empirical reality of human-caused climate change, and the need for both technological and legislative measures to slow it and mitigate its impacts. Support abortion rights, or at least a European-style compromise on abortion. Republicans can keep the anti-wokeness stuff, which actually seems to have become their defining issue. If they do all that, and also the Democrats are taken over by frothing radicals who want to annihilate the state of Israel and abolish the police … that’s, uh, probably the point when I start voting Republican.\n\nQ17: Aha, so you now admit that there exist conceivable circumstances that would cause you to vote Republican! In that case, why did you style yourself “Never-Trump From Here to Eternity”?\n\nA: Tell you what, the day the Republicans (and Trump himself?) repudiate authoritarianism and start respecting election outcomes, is the day I’ll admit my title was hyperbolic.\n\nQ18: In the meantime, will you at least treat us Trump supporters with civility and respect?\n\nA: Not only does civil disagreement not compromise any of my values, it is a value to which I think we should all aspire. And to whatever extent I’ve fallen short of that ideal—even when baited into it—I’m sorry and I’ll try to do better. Certainly, age and experience have taught me that there’s hardly anyone so far gone that I can’t find something on which I agree with them, while disagreeing with most of the rest of the world.\n\nThe news these days feels apocalyptic to me—as if we’re living through, if not the last days of humanity, then surely the last days of liberal democracy on earth.\n\nAll the more reason to ignore all of that, then, and blog instead about the notorious Busy Beaver function! Because holy moly, what news have I got today. For lovers of this super-rapidly-growing sequence of integers, I’ve honored to announce the biggest Busy Beaver development that there’s been since 1983, when I slept in a crib and you booted up your computer using a 5.25-inch floppy. That was the year when Allen Brady determined that BusyBeaver(4) was equal to 107. (Tibor Radó, who invented the Busy Beaver function in the 1960s, quickly proved with his student Shen Lin that the first three values were 1, 6, and 21 respectively. The fourth value was harder.)\n\nOnly now, after an additional 41 years, do we know the fifth Busy Beaver value. Today, an international collaboration called bbchallenge is announcing that it’s determined, and even formally verified using the Coq proof system, that BB(5) is equal to 47,176,870—the value that’s been conjectured since 1990, when Heiner Marxen and Jürgen Buntrock discovered a 5-state Turing machine that runs for exactly 47,176,870 steps before halting, when started on a blank tape. The new bbchallenge achievement is to prove that all 5-state Turing machines that run for more steps than 47,176,870, actually run forever—or in other words, that 47,176,870 is the maximum finite number of steps for which any 5-state Turing machine can run. That’s what it means for BB(5) to equal 47,176,870.\n\nFor more on this story, see Ben Brubaker’s superb article in Quanta magazine, or bbchallenge’s own announcement. For more background on the Busy Beaver function, see my 2020 survey, or my 2017 big numbers lecture, or my 1999 big numbers essay, or the Googology Wiki page, or Pascal Michel’s survey.\n\nThe difficulty in pinning down BB(5) was not just that there are a lot of 5-state Turing machines (16,679,880,978,201 of them to be precise, although symmetries reduce the effective number). The real difficulty is, how do you prove that some given machine runs forever? If a Turing machine halts, you can prove that by simply running it on your laptop until halting (at least if it halts after a “mere” ~47 million steps, which is child’s-play). If, on the other hand, the machine runs forever, via some never-repeating infinite pattern rather than a simple infinite loop, then how do you prove that? You need to find a mathematical reason why it can’t halt, and there’s no systematic method for finding such reasons—that was the great discovery of Gödel and Turing nearly a century ago.\n\nMore precisely, the Busy Beaver function grows faster than any function that can be computed, and we know that because if a systematic method existed to compute arbitrary BB(n) values, then we could use that method to determine whether a given Turing machine halts (if the machine has n states, just check whether it runs for more than BB(n) steps; if it does, it must run forever). This is the famous halting problem, which Turing proved to be unsolvable by finite means. The Busy Beaver function is Turing-uncomputability made flesh, a finite function that scrapes the edge of infinity.\n\nThere’s also a more prosaic issue. Proofs that particular Turing machines run forever tend to be mind-numbingly tedious. Even supposing you’ve found such a “proof,” why should other people trust it, if they don’t want to spend days staring at the outputs of your custom-written software?\n\nAnd so for decades, a few hobbyists picked away at the BB(5) problem. One, who goes by the handle “Skelet”, managed to reduce the problem to 43 holdout machines whose halting status was still undetermined. Or maybe only 25, depending who you asked? (And were we really sure about the machines outside those 43?)\n\nThe bbchallenge collaboration improved on the situation in two ways. First, it demanded that every proof of non-halting be vetted carefully. While this went beyond the original mandate, a participant named “mxdys” later upped the standard to fully machine-verifiable certificates for every non-halting machine in Coq, so that there could no longer be any serious question of correctness. (This, in turn, was done via “deciders,” programs that were crafted to recognize a specific type of parameterized behavior.) Second, the collaboration used an online forum and a Discord server to organize the effort, so that everyone knew what had been done and what remained to be done.\n\nDespite this, it was far from obvious a priori that the collaboration would succeed. What if, for example, one of the 43 (or however many) Turing machines in the holdout set turned out to encode the Goldbach Conjecture, or one of the other great unsolved problems of number theory? Then the final determination of BB(5) would need to await the resolution of that problem. (We do know, incidentally, that there’s a 27-state Turing machine that encodes Goldbach.)\n\nBut apparently the collaboration got lucky. Coq proofs of non-halting were eventually found for all the 5-state holdout machines.\n\nAs a sad sidenote, Allen Brady, who determined the value of BB(4), apparently died just a few days before the BB(5) proof was complete. He was doubtful that BB(5) would ever be known. The reason, he wrote in 1988, was that “Nature has probably embedded among the five-state holdout machines one or more problems as illusive as the Goldbach Conjecture. Or, in other terms, there will likely be nonstopping recursive patterns which are beyond our powers of recognition.”\n\nMaybe I should say a little at this point about what the 5-state Busy Beaver—i.e., the Marxen-Buntrock Turing machine that we now know to be the champion—actually does. Interpreted in English, the machine iterates a certain integer function g, which is defined by\n\ng(x) = (5x+18)/3 if x = 0 (mod 3),\n\ng(x) = (5x+22)/3 if x = 1 (mod 3),\n\ng(x) = HALT if x = 2 (mod 3).\n\nStarting from x=0, the machine computes g(0), g(g(0)), g(g(g(0))), and so forth, halting if and if it ever reaches … well, HALT. The machine runs for millions of steps because it so happens that this iteration eventually reaches HALT, but only after a while:\n\n0 → 6 → 16 → 34 → 64 → 114 → 196 → 334 → 564 → 946 → 1584 → 2646 → 4416 → 7366 → 12284 → HALT.\n\n(And also, at each iteration, the machine runs for a number of steps that grows like the square of the number x.)\n\nSome readers might be reminded of the Collatz Conjecture, the famous unsolved problem about whether, if you repeatedly replace a positive integer x by x/2 if x is even or 3x+1 if x is odd, you’ll always eventually reach x=1. As Scott Alexander would say, this is not a coincidence because nothing is ever a coincidence. (Especially not in math!)\n\nIt’s a fair question whether humans will ever know the value of BB(6). Pavel Kropitz discovered, a couple years ago, that BB(6) is at least 10^10^10^10^10^10^10^10^10^10^10^10^10^10^10 (i.e., 10 raised to itself 15 times). Obviously Kropitz didn’t actually run a 6-state Turing machine for that number of steps until halting! Instead he understood what the machine did—and it turned out to apply an iterative process similar to the g function above, but this time involving an exponential function. And the process could be proven to halt after ~15 rounds of exponentiation.\n\nMeanwhile Tristan Stérin, who coordinated the bbchallenge effort, tells me that a 6-state machine was recently discovered that “iterates the Collatz-like map {3x/2, (3x-1)/2} from the number 8 and halts if and only if the number of odd terms ever gets bigger than twice the number of even terms.” This shows that, in order to determine the value of BB(6), one would first need to prove or disprove the Collatz-like conjecture that that never happens.\n\nBasically, if and when artificial superintelligences take over the world, they can worry about the value of BB(6). And then God can worry about the value of BB(7).\n\nI first learned about the BB function in 1996, when I was 15 years old, from a book called The New Turing Omnibus by A. K. Dewdney. From what I gather, Dewdney would go on to become a nutty 9/11 truther. But that’s irrelevant to the story. What matters was that his book provided my first exposure to many of the key concepts of computer science, and probably played a role in my becoming a theoretical computer scientist at all.\n\nAnd of all the concepts in Dewdney’s book, the one I liked the most was the Busy Beaver function. What a simple function! You could easily explain its definition to Archimedes, or Gauss, or any of the other great mathematicians of the past. And yet, by using it, you could name definite positive integers (BB(10), for example) incomprehensibly larger than any that they could name.\n\nIt was from Dewdney that I learned that the first four Busy Beaver numbers were the unthreatening-looking 1, 6, 21, and 107 … but then that the fifth value was already unknown (!!), and at any rate at least 47,176,870. I clearly remember wondering whether BB(5) would ever be known for certain, and even whether I might be the one to determine it. That was almost two-thirds of my life ago.\n\nAs things developed, I played no role whatsoever in the determination of BB(5) … except for this. Tristan Stérin tells me that reading my survey article, The Busy Beaver Frontier, was what inspired him to start and lead the bbchallenge collaboration that finally cracked the problem. It’s hard to express how gratified that makes me.\n\nWhy care about determining particular values of the Busy Beaver function? Isn’t this just a recreational programming exercise, analogous to code golf, rather than serious mathematical research?\n\nI like to answer that question with another question: why care about humans landing on the moon, or Mars? Those otherwise somewhat arbitrary goals, you might say, serve as a hard-to-fake gauge of human progress against the vastness of the cosmos. In the same way, the quest to determine the Busy Beaver numbers is one concrete measure of human progress against the vastness of the arithmetical cosmos, a vastness that we learned from Gödel and Turing won’t succumb to any fixed procedure. The Busy Beaver numbers are just … there, Platonically, as surely as 13 was prime long before the first caveman tried to arrange 13 rocks into a nontrivial rectangle and failed. And yet we might never know the sixth of these numbers and only today learned the fifth.\n\nAnyway, huge congratulations to the bbchallenge team on their accomplishment. At a terrifying time for the world, I’m happy that, whatever happens, at least I lived to see this.\n\nDana, the kids, and I got back to the US last week after a month spent in England and then Israel. We decided to visit Israel because … uhh, we heard there’s never been a better time.\n\nWe normally go every year to visit Dana’s family and our many friends there, and to give talks. Various well-meaning friends suggested that maybe we should cancel or postpone this year—given, you know, the situation. To me, though, the situation felt like all the more reason to go. To make Israel seem more and more embattled, dangerous, isolated, abnormal, like not an acceptable place to visit (much less live), in order to crater its economy, demoralize its population, and ultimately wipe it from the face of earth … that is explicitly much of the world’s game plan right now, laid out with shocking honesty since October 7 (a day that also showed us what the “decolonization” will, concretely, look like). So, if I oppose this plan, then how could I look myself in the mirror while playing my tiny part in it? Shouldn’t I instead raise a middle finger to those who’d murder my family, and go?\n\nBesides supporting our friends and relatives, though, I wanted to see the post-October-7 reality for myself, rather than just spending hours per day reading about it on social media. I wanted to form my own impression of the mood in Israel: fiercely determined? angry? hopeless? just carrying on like normal?\n\nAnyway, in two meeting-packed weeks, mostly in Tel Aviv but also in Jerusalem, Haifa, and Be’er Sheva, I saw stuff that could support any of those narratives. A lot was as I’d expected, but not everything. In the rest of this post, I’ll share eleven observations:\n\n(1) This presumably won’t shock anyone, but in post-October-7 Israel, you indeed can’t escape October 7. Everywhere you look, on every building, in every lobby, hanging from every highway overpass, there are hostage posters and “Bring Them Home Now” signs and yellow ribbons—starting at the airport, where every single passenger is routed through a long corridor of hostage posters, each one signed and decorated by the hostage’s friends and family. It sometimes felt as though Yad Vashem had expanded to encompass the entire country. Virtually everyone we talked to wanted to share their stories and opinions about the war, most of all their depression and anger. While there was also plenty of discussion about quantum error mitigation and watermarking of large language models and local family events, no one even pretended to ignore the war.\n\n(2) Having said that, the morning after we landed, truthfully, the first thing that leapt out at me wasn’t anything to do with October 7, hostages, or Gaza. It was the sheer number of children playing outside, in any direction you looked. Full, noisy playgrounds on block after block. It’s one thing to know intellectually that Israel has by far the highest birthrate of any Western country, another to see it for yourself. The typical secular family probably has three kids; the typical Orthodox family has more. (The Arab population is of course also growing rapidly, both in Israel and in the West Bank and Gaza.) New apartment construction is everywhere you look in Tel Aviv, despite building delays caused by the war. And it all seems perfectly normal … unless you’ve lived your whole life in environments where 0.8 or 1.2 children per couple is the norm.\n\nThis, of course, has giant implications for anyone interested in Israel’s future. It’s like, a million Israeli leftists could get fed up and flee to the US or Canada or Switzerland, and Israel would still have a large and growing Jewish population—because having a big family is “just what people do” in a state that was founded to defy the Holocaust. In particular: anyone who dreams of dismantling the illegal, settler-colonial, fascist Zionist ethnostate, and freeing Palestine from river to sea, had better have some plan for what they’re going to do with all these millions of young Jews, who don’t appear to be going anywhere.\n\n(3) The second thing I noticed was the heat—comparable to the Texas summer heat that we try to escape when possible. Because of the roasting sun, our own two pampered offspring mostly refused to go outside during daytime, and we mostly met friends indoors. I more than once had the dark thought that maybe Israel will survive Hamas, Hezbollah, Iran, and its own Jewish extremists … only to be finished off in the end (along with much of the rest of the planet) by global warming. I wonder whether Israel will manage to engineer its way out of the crisis, as it dramatically engineered its way out of its water crisis via desalination. The Arab petrostates have been trying to engineer their way out of the Middle East’s increasingly Mercury-like climate, albeit with decidedly mixed results.\n\n(4) But nu, what did our Israeli friends say about the war? Of course it’s a biased sample, because our friends are mostly left-wing academics and tech workers. But, at risk of overgeneralizing: they’re unhappy. Very, very unhappy. As for Bibi and his far-right yes-men? Our friends’ rage at them was truly a sight to behold. American progressives are, like, mildly irked by Trump in comparison. Yes, our friends blame Bibi for the massive security and intelligence failures that allowed October 7 to happen. They blame him for dragging out the war to stave off elections. They blame him for empowering the contemptible Ben-Gvir and Smotrich. They blame him for his failure to bring back the remaining hostages. Most of all, they blame him for refusing even to meet with the hostage families, and more broadly, for evading responsibility for all that he did wrong, while arrogating credit for any victories (like the rescue of Noa Argamani).\n\n(5) One Israeli friend offered to take me along to the giant anti-Bibi rally that now happens every Saturday night in Azrieli Center in Tel Aviv. (She added that, if I left before 9pm, it would reduce the chances of the police arresting me.) As the intrepid blogger-investigator I am, of course I agreed.\n\nWhile many of the protesters simply called for new elections to replace Netanyahu (a cause that I 3000% support), others went further, demanding a deal to free the hostages and an immediate end to the war (even if, as they understood, that would leave Hamas in power).\n\nWatching the protesters, smelling their pot smoke that filled the air, I was seized by a thought: these Israeli leftists actually see eye-to-eye with the anti-Israel American leftists on a huge number of issues. In a different world, they could be marching together as allies. Except, of course, for one giant difference: namely, the Tel Aviv protesters are proudly waving Israeli flags (sometimes modified to add anti-Bibi images, or to depict the Star of David “crying”), rather than burning or stomping on those flags. They’re marching to save the Israel that they know and remember, rather than to destroy it.\n\n(6) We did meet one ultra-right-wing (and Orthodox) academic colleague. He was virtually the only person we met on this trip who seemed cheerful and optimistic about Israel’s future. He brought me to his synagogue to celebrate the holiday of Shavuot, while he himself stood guarding the door of the synagogue with a gargantuan rifle (his volunteer duty since October 7). He has six kids.\n\n(7) Again and again, our secular liberal friends told us they’re thinking about moving from Israel, because if the Bibi-ists entrench their power (and of course the demographics are trending in that direction), then they don’t see that the country has any worthwhile future for them or their children. Should this be taken more seriously than the many Americans who promise that this time, for real, they’ll move to Canada if Trump wins? I’m not sure. I can only report what I heard.\n\n(8) At the same time, again and again I got the following question from Israelis (including the leftist ones): how bad is the situation for Jews in the US? Have the universities been taken over by militant anti-Zionists, like it shows in the news? I had to answer: it’s complicated. Because I live my life enbubbled in the STEM field of computer science, surrounded by friends and colleagues of many backgrounds, ethnicities, religions, and political opinions who are thoughtful and decent (otherwise, why would they be my friends and colleagues?), I’m able to live a very nice life even in the midst of loud protesters calling to globalize the intifada against my family.\n\nIf, on the other hand, I were in a typical humanities department? Yeah, then I’d be pretty terrified. My basic options would be to (a) shut up about my (ironically) moderate, middle-of-the-road opinions on Israel/Palestine, such as support for the two-state solution; (b) live a miserable and embattled existence; or (c) pack up and move, for example to Israel.\n\nAn astounding irony right now is that, just as Israeli leftists are talking about moving from Israel, some of my American Jewish friends have talked to me about moving to Israel, to escape a prejudice that they thought died with their grandparents. I don’t know where the grass is actually greener (or is it brown everywhere?). Nor do I know how many worriers will actually follow through. What’s clear is that, both in Israel and in the diaspora, Jews are feeling an existential fear that they haven’t felt for generations.\n\n(9) Did I fear for my own family’s safety during the trip? Not really. Maybe I should have. When we visited Haifa, we found that GPS was scrambled all across northern Israel, to make targeting harder for Hezbollah missiles. As a result, we couldn’t use Google Maps, got completely lost driving, and had to change plans with our friends. For the first time, now I really feel angry at Hezbollah: they made my life worse and it’s personal!\n\nThe funniest part, though, was how the scrambling was implemented: when you opened Google Maps anywhere in the north, it told you that you were in Beirut. It then dutifully gave you walking or driving directions to wherever you were going in Israel, passing through Syria close to Damascus (“warning: this route passes through multiple countries”).\n\n(10) The most darkly comical thing that I heard on the entire trip: “oh, no, I don’t object in the slightest if the anti-Zionists want to kill us all. I only object if they want to kill us because of an incorrect understanding of the relevant history.” Needless to say, this was a professor.\n\n(11) After my two-week investigation, what grand insight can I offer about Israel’s future? Not much, but maybe this: I think we can definitively rule out the scenario where Israel, having been battered by October 7, and bracing itself to be battered worse by Hezbollah, just sort of … withers away and disappears. Yes, Israel might get hotter, more crowded, more dangerous, more right-wing, and more Orthodox. But it will stay right where it is, unless and until its enemies destroy it in a cataclysmic war. You can’t scare people away, break their will, if they believe they have nowhere else on the planet to go. You can only kill them or else live next to them in peace, as the UN proposed in 1947 and as Oslo proposed in the 1990s. May we live to see peace.\n\nAnyway, on that pleasant note, time soon to tune in to the Trump/Biden debate! I wonder who these two gentlemen are, and what they might stand for?"
