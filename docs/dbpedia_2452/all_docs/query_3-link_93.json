        "text": "An algorithm in quantum computing that enables large numbers to be factorized into prime numbers in a way which is much quicker than using traditional computers. This algorithm, which was proposed by the American computer scientist Peter Shor (1959â€“ ) in 1994, has major implications for the security of Internet information transfer."
