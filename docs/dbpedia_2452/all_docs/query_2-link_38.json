        "text": "SHORT TAKES\n\nFORMER NETSCAPE CEO JOINS SUN’S BOARD\n\nPalo Alto, CA — Sun Microsystems Inc., a maker of workstations, network servers and software, said that Jim Barksdale, the former chief executive of Netscape Communications Corp., has joined its board of directors. Netscape was purchased by America Online Inc. in a three-way deal that was completed in March. As part of the deal, AOL teamed up with Sun to develop and market the Internet software products developed by Netscape. Sun also is selling servers to AOL in a multi-year deal.\n\nBarksdale, 56, is now the managing partner of the Barksdale Group, an investment and advisory group focused exclusively on Internet software and services start-ups. Its first investment was in HomeGrocer.com, an online grocery shopping and delivery service.\n\nQUANTUM COMPUTING THEORIST SHOR WINS GENIUS AWARD\n\nSan Diego, CA — Peter Shor, one of the most acclaimed theorists in the field of quantum computing, and a computer scientist at AT&T Research Labs, won a prestigious grant from the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation. The MacArthur Foundation grants, widely known as the “genius awards,” are large sums of money given to individuals in the hopes that the cash stipend will free them up to continue what the Foundation deems as exceptional work. Shor was awarded $290,000 and cited for his “discoveries [as a computer scientist] that are increasing the speed of some calculations.”\n\nShor is well known in quantum computing for his theories that proposed what are known as quantum error correction schemes. The main problem with quantum computing was the tendency of passing atoms to interact with and interfere with qubits, thus leading to the notion of quantum computing’s fragility and propensity toward errors. Scientists believe that there is now no known way to avoid these errors, so researchers set out to find theoretical approaches toward quantum computing error correction. –courtesy of Ed Rosenfeld, EIntelligence http://www.eintelligence.com/\n\nNASCENZI NAMED CEO OF CLARITAS\n\nSan Diego, CA — Recently Gerald S. Hobbs, CEO of VNU Marketing Information Services (VNU MIS), announced the joining of two VNU MIS divisions: National Decision Systems (NDS) and Claritas Inc.
