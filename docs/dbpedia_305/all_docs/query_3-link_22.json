        "text": "CHAPTER 7\n\nA Decade of War and Reconstruction\n\nA children’s home teacher, Ekaterina Demina, was on a train to visit her brother in Brest, Belarus, when war broke out on June 22, 1941. She found herself stranded and under German fire in Orsha, Vitebsk, not far from the Russian border. Demina had no medical training, but she and several other women helped the wounded, until Demina herself was injured and ended up in a military hospital. Once recovered, she signed up for a short-term nursing course, joined the navy and “saved more than 150 wounded, killed 50 fascists, and was injured three times.”1\n\nVera Ivanovna Ivanova-Shchekina was seventeen when war broke out. She was in Leningrad and wanted to go to the front, but the enlistment office (voenkomat) advised her to study and train as a sanitary brigade member. She was already at the front by the time the course finished. Shchekina began work in a military hospital, where her “skill, tenderness, care and attention” eased the suffering of soldiers. In September 1941 she became commander of her sanitary brigade and transferred the sick and weak in her assigned residential district to the hospital. Shchekina received a Florence Nightingale Medal in 1975 for her efforts in the Leningrad Blockade.2 The narrative of patriotism and sacrifice that had been building over the course of the 1930s was put into full effect by the outbreak of war. Countless women like Demina and Shchekina were eager to contribute to the war effort. The invading German army unleashed a swell of emotions across Soviet territory, and the Soviet government channeled these toward patriotic service to the motherland.3\n\nIn the Soviet Union and elsewhere, connotations of femininity and family associated with the civilian nurse provided a “powerful cultural affirmation of the nurturing nature that supposedly defined women biologically.”4 But the brutality and scale of a war that saw the loss of some twenty-seven million people ensured that many women became embroiled in the horrors of war, whether in battle or at the home front. Such circumstances tested family and femininity. Violence, deprivation, starvation, and hardship defined the wartime experience for Soviet citizens. The harsh policies of the Soviet government, particularly those during the first year of the conflict, were to steer the Soviet Union through the war and save socialism from the clutches of fascism. Less than two months after the launch of Operation Barbarossa on June 22, 1941, Order No. 270 decreed punishment for Soviet soldiers and their families who surrendered; Order No. 227, known as “Not a step back,” issued in July 1942, threatened retreating soldiers with execution. It was in this extreme context that women enrolled and served as nurses across the western front, in besieged cities, as well as in hospitals, factories, and clinics far away from the bombing and fighting. This chapter shows how nurses negotiated the changing political and professional terrain during the 1940s, coping with not only the horrors of war but also the difficulties of the immediate postwar years.\n\nThe months preceding and immediately following the war are particularly important in understanding Soviet medical preparedness and strategy. Nurses’ struggles did not end in May 1945 and therefore the immediate postwar years serve as a reminder of the short- and medium-term consequences of the war for medical workers and healthcare. How did wartime nurses integrate into the civilian healthcare system? What was the state’s stance on nursing following their contribution to the Soviet victory? The nursing and broader medical experience of the war shows that, in spite of the civil defense preparations of the late 1930s and rapid industrialization, the Soviet healthcare system was not in good shape prior to the war and that many of the challenges confronting the country after the war had been present beforehand. In that context, the efforts of medical workers should be appreciated all the more. These wartime efforts, and of course the continuing demand for medical workers during the war, were important in cementing the prestige of the nursing profession. It was in 1942, after all, when a journal dedicated solely to nursing, Nurse (Meditsinskaia sestra) was first published in the USSR. For that reason, the war was a turning point and helped to accelerate some of the changes already occurring in the profession in the late 1930s.\n\nNurses and women in war were usually celebrated for the care and attention they showed to the wounded and sick.5 Professional as well as voluntary nurses, such as Demina and Shchekina, felt duty-bound to contribute to the war effort in some way. Some 41 percent of frontline doctors were women, of which 43 percent were surgeons.6 The number of female military feldshers stood at 43 percent and female sanitary instructors at 40 percent, and 100 percent of nurses were women.7 All these women made real and significant contributions to the war. But they played a role in the rear too. While many medical personnel raced to the front, the sick and injured at the home front also required care. This chapter brings some degree of balance to the wartime nursing story in the Soviet Union by analyzing the range of caring activities that medical workers performed. It also places the war years in a slightly longer chronological context, with a focus on the 1940s rather than the war years per se.\n\nThe Nurse Experience of Frontline War\n\nCommunist Youth League women were often the first to volunteer for nursing at the front. One such nurse, Valia Savenkova, was celebrated for her wartime heroism. In the heat of battle, and with the help of a girl from a neighboring village, she evacuated 325 injured behind the front lines and received a medal for bravery.8 The twenty-two-year-old worker Antonina Alekseevna Lebedeva, who completed a sanitary brigade course in August 1941, went to the military hospital after her day’s work.9 During the war Lebedeva put her skills to good use by evacuating hundreds of injured and earned the praise of her superiors. Another twenty-two-year-old, Communist Youth League member Varvara Emelʹianovna Khomenko, worked as a nurse in a military hospital beginning in February 1942. According to the head doctor, she had “quite mastered medical techniques” and was one of the “best workers” in the hospital.10\n\nMuch of this rhetoric of praise was already familiar to Soviet youth from previous industrialization or militarization campaigns, but this time it was different: the Soviet Union was actually at war. During and after the Great Patriotic War, as World War II is known in Russia, thousands of medical workers, many of whom were women, received praise for their wartime endeavors.11 Some had already cut their teeth during the Winter War. Twenty-five-year-old Anna Efimova Ostrovskaia, a Communist Youth League member and student at Leningrad State University, had no nurse training but was celebrated for her brilliance as a surgical nurse in a military hospital, where she looked after patients with “love and maternal care.”12 Much of the Great Patriotic War rhetoric about heroes and sacrifice was present during the Winter War, with Communist Youth League members often at the forefront.13 The militarization of the late 1930s and war with Finland had raised awareness of the importance of wartime nursing, although nothing could have prepared Soviet youth for the experience of the Great Patriotic War.\n\nOften those who decided to work as nurses at the front when war started had no idea what awaited them. A young teacher, who trained as a nurse and went to the front with her husband, described the horrors of caring for wounded soldiers. When nursing a sergeant with a leg wound, blood spattered all over her face and she initially “lost herself,” thinking she could not go on, but then composed herself, fixed up her patient, and sent him to the hospital.14 She was not prepared for what she faced at the front. As she told her Harvard interviewer: “There is such a difference in the theory and practice of military nursing. Everything seems so nice and neat and orderly when you’re learning, but when you are actually involved in treating wounded, your arms are covered with blood up to your elbows.”15 The rivers of blood, especially during amputations, overwhelmed another nurse, Maria Selivestrovna Bozhok. She said, “I was always bloody.… Blood is dark red.… Very dark.”16 Another woman, who completed her nurse training in a hospital at the beginning of the war and received some military training in a polyclinic before being sent to the front, recalled bandaging so many wounded patients that it seemed to her that “her hands smelled like blood.”17\n\nSometimes eager volunteers barely out of school went to the front but soon found they were out of their depth. One recalled bringing a bedpan to a man with no arms, and it took her a few minutes to figure things out. In her words: “I had to help him.… And I didn’t know what to do, I’d never seen it. They didn’t even teach it in the courses.”18 Even though many of these nurses had only the most basic medical training and were ill equipped to deal with the wounds and injuries that confronted them at the front, they nevertheless managed to take care of soldiers with serious and life-threatening injuries. They also had to deal with constant threat of danger and injury to themselves.\n\nAnna Grigorʹevna Menzorova, from Novosibirsk, completed a nursing course without a break from work and went to the front when war broke out. She was “injured four times but each time she recovered and returned to her battalion.” According to her senior commanding lieutenant, Menzorova had “iron nerves.” During one battle a mine exploded near her, and they “all thought that was the end of their ‘Siberichka,’ but she got up.” She continued her work after somebody bandaged her head wound.19 Not all were so lucky. A group of three medics remembered their friend Polina. She died after throwing herself on a patient during a bombardment.20 Such tales of courage and sacrifice became part of the foundation myth of the war. The harrowing and heroic experiences shared among comrades defined the memory of the Great Patriotic War. These memories still endure.\n\nPrivate memories often differed from official, public narratives. When Xenia Sergeevna Osadcheva returned home after nursing in a frontline hospital on the Trans- and North Caucasian fronts, her mother did not recognize her. Even though she later moved to Crimea and lived by the sea, she admitted: “I’m worn out with pain, I still don’t have a womanly face. I cry often, I moan all day. It’s my memories.”21 Nurses and medical workers at the front experienced trauma and posttraumatic stress disorder. The sights, sounds, smells, and thoughts of war were horrific, and memories of war lived on long afterward; nurses in war often remember the smell of burning or blood, the sounds of bombs and screaming, and the sight of mangled bodies.22 Soviet nurses, like those in other war zones, felt the stress of war to be great. One American Medical Corps nurse working in a field hospital in Germany wrote that she was “desperately tired, hungry, and sick of the misery and futility of war.” After losing one young patient, she “wept uncontrollably,” her tears falling on her patient’s “bandaged remains.”23 In a 1946 article American Mary Walker Randolph, an army nurse and lieutenant, wrote that army nurses would need time to “recuperate from the stress and hectic schedules of field duty and nursing wounded young men” and, in her words, to recover from the “nervous tension and fatigue built up by life in a foxhole and under shellfire.”24 They needed to get reacquainted with “American life” and enjoy missed luxuries such as a “silk night-gown, a bathroom.”25 In the Soviet context nurses could not admit to some of the issues that nurses elsewhere might have discussed openly, such as compassion fatigue and emotional stress owing to having to care for mass casualties or the severely wounded.26 This was a group of women whose wartime experience became subsumed to the Great Patriotic War narrative of sacrifice and glory. To publicly tell of their personal horrors, fears, doubts, and lasting pain was to undermine the myth of the war. Rather, their stories had to “suit the stereotype” and be a “conversation for the public.”27\n\nThe everyday heroism of medical workers lay not only in saving lives or dramatic rescue efforts but also in their commitment to the more mundane task of organizing courses, instructing others, and just helping out. After the Red Army liberated Kharkov, nurses and sanitary brigade members home from the front taught classes for two months before returning to duty.28 Nurses in evening classes who studied for seven months without a break from work were all exhausted after “putting in a twelve-hour day and then showing up to classes.”29 The memoirs of medical workers attest to the sense of camaraderie and friendship that existed. One nurse told her I Remember / Ia pomniu interviewer, “We looked out for one another.”30\n\nThe dedication of nurses during the war was amply demonstrated in the statistics. Medical workers returned 72 percent of the injured and 91 percent of sick Red Army troops to the front. During and after the Great Patriotic War, thousands of medical workers received official praise.31 Some 116,000 medical workers—40,000 of them women—received honors. Of the 52 medics awarded Hero of the Soviet Union, 15 were women.32 But praise did not extend to all female medical workers. The nurse Anna Vasilevna Bogacheva, when asked in an interview if she was awarded a medal for “fighting merit” and how often medical personnel received this medal, replied that she received this award but that very few medical workers enjoyed these particular honors.33 Another nurse interviewed had a similar view and attested that few medical workers received awards, except those who died and posthumously received the Red Star.34\n\nWhen women received recognition for their feats, their efforts were often framed within a gendered discourse that placed women in a caring rather than combative role. As one historian has argued, although the central press was to place women at the front in “caring, sacrificing, and noncombatant” roles, journalists were not always consistent in doing that, nor could they “form a coherent perspective on women’s desire to fight.”35 To use the words of the writer and historian Svetlana Alexievich again, stories about women and nurses had to “suit the stereotype.”36 This was the case during but especially after the war. In literature and the press, representations of Soviet medical workers conformed to ideals of heroism and self-sacrifice and feminine, maternal care.\n\nPublic tales of heroism often overshadowed accounts of despair during the Great Patriotic War. This despair also applied to women’s private lives, where loss, uncertainty, and trauma shaped their relationships. Female medical workers at the front, or frontovichki, often fell in love with soldiers, lost their husbands, had sexual relations with soldiers, or were victims of sexual assault.37 As some historians of Soviet women in war contend, “Women in the Red Army not only had to confront a lethally misogynist enemy but also at times a sexually predatory environment among their own male comrades-in-arms.”38 The 1957 film The Cranes Are Flying (Letiat zhuravli) depicts the impact of war on those at the home front through the experience of the main protagonist, Veronika. After her fiancé leaves for the front, his family takes her in and they head for the rear, along with her fiancé’s cousin, Mark. When Mark rapes and marries Veronika, viewers gain insight into both the vulnerability and betrayal of women.39 Women and medical workers had to wrestle with not only the hardship of their work but also preying men and the judgment of others.\n\nWomen in war who became romantically involved with soldiers were often derided as war-field campaign wives (polevye pokhodnye zheny, or PPZhe). As one medical assistant remarked: “There were only men around, so it’s better to live with one than to be afraid of them all.… But after the battle each of them lies in wait for you.… You can’t get out of the dugout at night.”40 The nurse Ester Manʹkova (Fain) wrote in her memoirs that soldiers were more blunt than officers, asking girls they met if they would “do it or not.”41 Senior army personnel were often presented with “trophy” wives; female feldshers became the field campaign wives of decorated military men, including Marshalls G. K. Zhukov, I. S. Konev, and A. I. Eremenko.42 Oleg Budnitskii’s work has shown how many women returned from the front with reputations as “ruined” women. Malicious rumors that began in the army followed them into civilian life: many of these women consequently preferred to conceal or downplay their wartime past.43\n\nThe Soviet press and propaganda presented nurses and other medical workers as caring sisters and mothers, but some of the deeper personal traumas were not given voice. War would be won at any cost. One historian of British nursing argues that notions of sacrifice during the First World War formed part of nurses’ “healing work” as opposed to a reflection of their “subordination” to the establishment.44 In this way, nurses “subordinated their own emotional and physical needs to those of their patients” because that was how they contained trauma and promoted a patient’s well-being.45 In the Soviet Union, nurses also contained various forms of suffering and trauma from the Second World War. While much of this was a direct result of their role as nurses and medical workers, sometimes the hardship they experienced was due to the fact that they were women.\n\nHealthcare on the Home Front\n\nFor nurses and other medical workers, the situation was just as difficult away from the front. In conditions of total war, the state directed the vast majority of resources to defense. Yet medical workers populating military hospitals or evacuation hospitals struggled to cope. Medical workers, who already had a multitude of grievances about their living and working conditions as well as their financial situation, endured extremely harsh labor conditions during the war years. The Labor Law of 1940, which was instituted in workplaces including hospitals and clinics across the country, made already difficult working conditions much worse. This draconian law meant that basic infringements, such as being late to work, became criminal offenses.46 Workers could be incarcerated for two to four months if found guilty of leaving their job without permission from management.47 The June law met with widespread resistance in various workplaces across the Soviet Union.48 The former head doctor of a village hospital in Yakovlevna District, Primorye, was not pleased with the law on the eight-hour working day and seven-day week, which he found to be “unclear” and “unacceptable,” because “the work was very difficult and the pay was so little.”49 Nor did the law seem to ease problems with labor discipline. In the central maternity hospital in Vladivostok, 50 percent of medical workers received convictions for violating work discipline and two workers received sentences for two months’ imprisonment.50 In another district of the Primorye Territory, a worker was sentenced to four months in prison for repeated truancy.51 The outbreak of war put an already stretched healthcare system to the test and placed frustrated medical workers under even more pressure.\n\nOne of the reasons provided for worker dissatisfaction was the low salary and the high cost of living, a problem discussed in previous chapters. Doctors worked part-time in several places. Medical personnel at all levels were seriously unhappy with their standard of living in the Far East and “simply refused” to work in the public health system.52 This was a far cry from the medical training and military preparation—the so-called fortresses of sanitary defense—being undertaken elsewhere in the Soviet Union. These medical workers in the far eastern corner of the Soviet Union were speaking out against conditions at a time when the state was trying to stir up patriotism and just seven months before the German invasion almost ten thousand kilometers to the west.\n\nThe civilian public healthcare system had to get by on the scraps, making do with the least-experienced doctors and nurses. Medical workers far from the front also had to deal with the most vulnerable in Soviet society—the old, the infirm, infants, and those ineligible for action. They also treated exhausted workers.53 Rationing meant that many were often near the starvation point.54 One sixteen-year-old nurse recalled that she always had food when she was at the front, but that was not the case when she later worked at a military hospital behind the front lines in Baku.55\n\nStaffing evacuation hospitals proved challenging too.56 Medical personnel in the evacuation hospitals consisted of different medical specialties, and most were SOKK nurses. In the city of Gorky, now Nizhni Novgorod, 30 percent of hospitals had one doctor for every one hundred patients; surgeons were in even shorter supply.57 Doctors, nurses, and other personnel were needed at the front in field hospitals, behind the lines in evacuation and military hospitals, as well as in civilian hospitals and clinics. In spite of the immense challenges, a “majority” of evacuation hospitals returned 96–98 percent of the discharged to action in the first five months of the war.58 Medical workers in Yaroslavlʹ and Vologda had to cope with makeshift and awful conditions when treating vast numbers of malnourished and diseased evacuees from Leningrad in March–June 1942.59 Many nurses, despite their inexperience, quickly mastered the basics of care. Their role was more than just medical; they “read newspapers to the patients, wrote letters to relatives, gave talks, and taught patients first aid.”60 When performing their medical duties, nurses and feldshers were to do so “with loving care.”61 One medical commentator reminded readers that Commissar of Health G. A. Miterev believed medical workers had a “huge responsibility” to the “motherland and humanity.”62 He cited the commissar, noting that infectious diseases and epidemics were “considered anti-state business” that weakened and undermined the country’s defense.63 In this way caregiving became subsumed to the Soviet Union’s patriotic rhetoric. Betraying their responsibility was akin to betraying the country.\n\nIn spite of the mass training in sanitary defense before the war, the spread of disease remained a constant threat. A report on the conditions of work in November 1940 showed that tuberculosis was a prime contributory factor to this rate, and early forms of the disease were often not detected.64 There were “hundreds of patients who should have been isolated [but] were instead living in dormitories and apartments, infecting healthy people around them.” As a result, the number of deaths from tuberculosis in the Primorye Territory had risen from 336 in 1938 to a staggering 864 in 1939.65 There were already 467 deaths for the first half of 1940.66 These were the awful conditions that existed before the privations and increased threat of epidemics associated with war descended on the region. Once war was under way medical workers had to cope with the rapid deterioration of the public’s health.67 By late 1941 and 1942, measles, typhus, and other diseases spread eastward along evacuation routes, taking the lives of infants, children, the old and the infirm; by 1943 and 1944, medical workers had to cope with vast numbers suffering from starvation and tuberculosis.68 The authorities took the threat of disease “extremely seriously,” and local officials put various sanitation measures in place to control the spread of infectious diseases.69 The State Defense Committee became involved in all anti-epidemic work, with Miterev made a plenipotentiary.70 But once again, Soviet efforts seemed to be a step behind, responding only after disaster threatened.\n\nA massive health crisis confronted medical workers on the front lines of care. In addition to caring for patients, healthcare workers also had to conduct sanitary-enlightenment work with patients and their relatives. At an interprovincial meeting of workers from infectious disease hospitals in the Urals-Siberian provinces, head doctors acknowledged that it was hard to find people as “devoted” as some of their medical workers, who sometimes worked in almost impossible conditions. The doctors believed that it was “wrong” to ask so much of them and “give them so little.”71 While some doctors felt this way, the state had no qualms about asking citizens to go above and beyond the call of duty.\n\nDuty of Care: State and Citizens\n\nLike medical workers elsewhere in the civilian system, healthcare workers in factories and plants were also under enormous pressure. They had a duty of care to their patients but also to the state. Workplaces had to meet their employees’ healthcare needs and ensure they were fit to work. When the Stalin Chemical Plant in Stalinogorsk received orders from the Tula provincial health department to ensure that middle medical personnel worked in the plant’s health center round the clock, the plant had five days to make that happen.72 The plant was also ordered to appoint one doctor and five nurses to the center, and an infirmary for daytime shift work was to be set up in another factory shop.73 Of the civilian population, it was these workers in defense industries, a total of about four million in 1943–1944, on whom “the Soviet regime concentrated its medical efforts.”74 Workdays lost due to illness cost the defense industry, and therefore medical services for industrial workers expanded during the war through the establishment of medical-sanitary sections to oversee the shop-based and factory-based health centers such as those in Stalinogorsk.75 Efforts to set up health centers for workers in defense were rolled out across the country, with more medical workers expected to fill these positions.\n\nThe state extended the arm of care to people for economic and defense reasons rather than individual or collective well-being. Concerned with typhus outbreaks in 1939 and 1940, the Commissariat of Health sent a series of recommendations to a long list of local and republican health authorities in the RSFSR.76 One of the suggested recommendations was for directors of schools and children’s homes to assume “personal responsibility for the sanitary condition of the institution.”77 The health authorities also wanted to ensure “compulsory sanitary supervision of rural schools, including nursing schools and schools for other medical workers.”78 The Commissariat of Health urged local health authorities to make doctors and feldshers “strictly liable for refusing any patients with typhus, and for the sanitary condition of the hospital, as well as for dispensing any items not disinfected for typhus.”79 The state placed the blame for mistakes and shortcomings on individuals within the system rather than the system itself.\n\nWar conditions meant that doctors unfamiliar with the structure and methods of Soviet public healthcare arrived in military hospitals. Head doctors considered many of the doctors medically qualified but “completely unfamiliar with the structure and methods of public health.”80 They were equally worried about nurses. Doctors felt that many nurses who completed only the “shortest of courses” basically “did not know anything, could do nothing” and yet had responsibility for a whole host of critically ill patients. Consequently, the doctors had to constantly work with nurses and feldshers.81 Doctors, nurses, and other medical personnel had to work overtime to compensate for inadequate training and resources.\n\nThe exigencies of war tested those working in Soviet hospitals and clinics in different ways. This was all the more so because medical workers did not work on a level playing field. In Novosibirsk Province the evacuation hospitals relocated from other Russian cities were “fully provided with an administrative apparatus, political personnel, doctors, and nurses.”82 But not all the hospitals were so well staffed.83 During the war, military hospital No. 1017 (the location was not provided, but the hospital seems to have been in Molotov, now Permʹ) experienced considerable difficulties presented by the retraining of middle medical personnel. This was partly because of the diverse nature of their qualifications, which included nurses who had graduated from feldsher schools, nurses with a legal middle medical education, wartime nurses, and those trained in short-term SOKK courses—in sum, people with different medical training and “with different cultural levels.”84 Some hospitals and clinics ended up addressing training and quality issues in a variety of ways, including through holding conferences.\n\nMedical conferences, which had started to drive the nursing profession forward from the mid-1930s on, continued over the course of the war. Some 97 interdepartmental conferences of nurses, including 131 talks, took place in 1941.85 During the war, conferences were a forum for discussion and an important means of bringing newly qualified medical workers up to speed. But they were not quite the professional showcases of the late 1930s. Conferences functioned as important spaces to share knowledge and work experience. The state mobilized medical workers to overcome deficiencies in the system, and they had to figure out ways of dealing with problems in training and education themselves. The Wehrmacht advance on Soviet territory heightened medical workers’ sense of duty.\n\nContours of Care\n\nMedical workers, as we have seen, wanted to provide the best care that they could under very trying circumstances. They had responsibilities to the state and patients and had to meet the expectations of both. In 1942 several patients in a local hospital wrote to the editors of the newspaper Cheliabinsk Worker (Cheliabinskii rabochii) expressing their gratitude for the careful and attentive treatment they received.86 They thanked the head physician, Ilʹia Naumovich Fridman, who was “ready to give everything to his patients,” as well as a group of nurses and a nanny, Anastasiia Sineglazova. Patients wrote that personnel were always “good and gentle,” and they felt that the medical workers cared about them. The patients had all arrived in the hospital with high fevers, and some of them had even lost consciousness, but they hoped that “within 15–20 days” they would return to full health after their stay. They were already feeling “much better” after six to eight days and put their recovery down to the care they received from the “hospital collective.”87\n\nThese patients depicted an orderly picture of life in a Soviet hospital during the war. Their positive experience was portrayed as a direct consequence of medical workers’ careful attention. Memoirs of nurses based in military and evacuation hospitals interviewed as part of the I Remember / Ia pomniu project also attest to the care afforded to wounded soldiers. There were certainly devoted nurses who held fond memories of their time caring for patients during the war.88 The extremities of war and the struggle for victory seemed to bond medical workers and patients all the more.\n\nThe All-Union Committee for the investigation of sick and wounded Red Army soldiers and commandants received letters and reports with examples of care and love for soldiers and officers. In Moscow’s Dzerzhinsky District, the head of hospital No. 1072 wrote about the patronage work it was doing with local industry in the area.89 The hospital head wrote that the community provided huge assistance to the hospital and was so rooted in hospital life that it was hard to imagine the staff’s work without these “modest, motherly, caring and affectionate” women and girls who gave their free time to care for the wounded, “day and night.” They assumed the role of sidelki, cleaned and decorated wards with flowers, and helped the injured write to their relatives and friends.90 Local women took on roles that fulfilled a more general caregiving function and provided patients with spiritual and emotional comfort. During the war, women assumed all manner of work to help the cause.91\n\nNursing work and the general healthcare situation was closely monitored during the war, especially in military hospitals. In November 1941, when the German Wehrmacht was attempting to take Moscow, a Communist Youth League secretary in Stalingrad, O. Mishakov, wrote to A. A. Andreev, secretary of the Party Central Committee, detailing the work in the military hospitals in Stalingrad.92 Despite good work, Mishakov admitted that there were some difficulties. Hospitals and clinics, he noted, struggled when it came to caring for Red Army soldiers—even maintaining basic sanitation proved difficult. There were similar problems with shortages and lack of resources elsewhere. In Stalingrad, for example, medical workers had to wash linen in a communal city laundry facility.93 Conditions across the front varied considerably. Further north, in battle-ravaged Kalinin, Rzhev, and Vyazʹma, doctors, nurses, and orderlies cared for patients in a way that “only a mother could give.” Only the Rzhev District received complaints, but it dealt with them swiftly—it moved to dismiss a “rude” nurse as an example to other hospitals.94\n\nAnother report to Andreev, this one written by the deputy head of the Red Army’s main military-sanitation administration, highlighted a lack of care toward the mood of patients. In some Commissariat of Health hospitals, medical workers’ “careless monitoring” of patients’ mood and actions led to wounded soldiers committing suicide by jumping out of windows or using razors to inflict wounds (the latter in Kazan, Ulyanovsk, and Kirov). This was a “consequence of the completely inadequate political-educational work among the wounded and permanent hospital staff.”95\n\nMishakov reported that in Stalingrad wounded soldiers walked across town in their hospital gowns to stand in queues for beer.96 Drunkenness and misbehavior among the patients and some staff were problems, with anti-Soviet behavior noted in the case of one patient who had a fascist flyer that he showed to other patients in his ward.97 To the northeast of Stalingrad and further up the Volga, in Kuibyshev Province, complaints about discipline and sanitation filed in. With no designated smoking area, patients “smoked everywhere,” but “medical workers failed to take any action.”98 There was a shortage of surgeons, and 30 percent of the middle medical personnel were nurses from short-term courses.99 Given medical workers’ workload and the pressure they were under, disciplining patients for smoking on hospital grounds was probably the least of their concerns. Patients and the Red Army had different expectations of care. For the former, cleanliness, comfort, and food (in some cases, alcohol) mattered, but for the latter, discipline and political-education ranked highly. Medical workers had to meet the expectations of both.\n\nNurses after the War\n\nIn spite of Soviet military successes, planning and preparation remained defense-oriented until the very end of the war. In fact, the narrative of praise for hero nurses became even more pervasive after the war. In 1945 more than 250 nurses received the title “Excellent Student of Healthcare” (Otlichniku zdravookhraneniia).100 The medical press often described nurses in the Soviet Union as a “modest army” whose kind word could sometimes be more effective than medicine.101 While nurses were generally praised for their love, modesty, and devotion, there was perceptible concern about the lack of education and training, especially among demobilized nurses. What would happen to all the nurses after the war, especially those trained in hastily set-up courses in the immediate years preceding and during the war?\n\nThe SOKK had trained more than 310,000 nurses in short-term courses over the course of the war, and these largely entered civilian medical institutions after the war.102 A Sovnarkom decree of 1918 declared the Red Cross and Red Crescent “autonomous and independent in questions about its organization and its participation in state events,” but it was under the ultimate control of the Commissariat of Health: Red Cross personnel and institutions were thus subject to instruction from the commissariat (from 1946 on, the Ministry of Health, or Minzdrav).103 The civilian healthcare sector could reclaim Red Cross and Red Crescent personnel for its needs. Soon after the war ended, SOKK workers taught in nursing courses for collective farmers to prepare them for work in nursing medical stations based on collective farms.104 Community workers (obshchestvenniki) keen to get involved in social activities, sanitary-defense, and prophylactic work could become involved in SOKK nursing.105 Indeed, between 1944 and 1950, the SOKK trained 15,300 reserve nurses and 8,438 collective farm nurses.106 But not all nurses remained in medicine: one woman who had trained in a hospital in the early 1940s found that, when she returned to her hometown in Saratov Province after the war, there was already a surplus of nurses, and so she found work in a car depot.107 The opposite was the case elsewhere. A woman from Yaroslavlʹ worked as a sanitary worker in a military hospital and enrolled in a nursing course only after the war.108\n\nGiven that the quality of wartime training was at best patchy and focused on defense needs, those who had trained in short-term courses needed to now enroll in good quality courses to complete their education. This applied to doctors and nurses who took abridged courses after war broke out.109 The SOKK received the support of the Soviet government; as an Executive Committee representative remarked in a report, Miterev gave “special attention to the work of the Red Cross courses” and promised that “premises, hospitals, and teachers would be provided to ensure their quality.”110 Such a plan assumed that the instructors were well trained, but in fact many teaching staff were not suitably qualified or committed.111 Courses were also dependent on premises, and in the postwar Soviet context hospitals suffered from dreadful overcrowding. At the Kiev October hospital, the head of the neurological department requested more beds for patients: there had been two hundred beds before the war, but in the summer of 1948 there were just forty.112 Growing numbers of patients made matters worse, with up to 150 people waiting to register for a bed on any given day.113 The end of the war brought little respite for medical workers, or patients for that matter.\n\nThose nurses who had completed short-term nursing courses before or during the war and continued in the medical profession afterward created a sense of stability in some medical institutions. Anna Vasilevna Bogacheva, for example, who studied nursing in Moscow and worked as a sanitary worker and nurse as an eighteen-year-old in Stalingrad in 1942, continued her nursing work after demobilization in 1946. She became a senior nurse in 1948 in Moscow’s Burdenko military hospital, where she remained for thirty-five years.114 Another demobilized medical worker found nursing work in the Kiev October hospital after the war, but conditions there were very difficult, and she often worked day and night and sometimes as a sidelka. Still, she was thankful to have basic dormitory accommodation and food. She then moved to a railway hospital, where her work with a young, inexperienced doctor was just as difficult, but she remained working there for thirty-eight years.115 In a field where labor turnover was generally rife, these cases show that some medical workers were content to remain in their post until they retired. Such workers were no doubt valuable to the institutions in which they worked, passing their knowledge and experience on to younger medical workers.\n\nThe end of the war did not signal a lack of interest in nursing or the medical services. Indeed, the number of middle medical personnel increased more than threefold in the period 1950–1974.116 The character of nursing gradually changed, with a refocus on civilian needs. Large numbers of nurses were still required for the army, hospitals, polyclinics and ambulatories. The postwar environment also created a need for specialist nurses in children’s institutions, physiotherapy, massage, and therapeutic physical culture.117 Polyclinics and hospital departments thus came to focus on providing nurses to cater to these areas, as well as caring for millions of citizens with war-related diseases and injuries. Even though there were 325,000 nurses (and 719,400 middle medical personnel) by 1950, this was still not enough to care for the two million war invalids, let alone the rest of the civilian population.118 Within this context, the healthcare system accepted medical workers with varying levels of training, including Red Cross–trained nurses.\n\nThe end of the war also marked further changes in international relations that did not, despite the best efforts of US nurses, bring Russian nurses closer to their international colleagues. As the nurse and social activist, Lavinia L. Dock, wrote in 1947: “How could we expect the Russians to overlook the daily insults, the malice, the ingratitude, the cold blooded threats of unfriendliness that are daily to be read in our papers, in the talk of Bullitt and Earle over the radio.… We nurses have no enemies.… We consider it an undeserved grievance that our Russian sisters have been alienated by the American government’s attitude.”119 Dock was corresponding with Anna Schwarzenberg, executive secretary of the International Council of Nurses (ICN), about the latter’s efforts to draw Russian nurses closer to the ICN. Schwarzenberg had sent several requested publications to a Russian contact, the professor Vladimir V. Lebedenko, and, she wrote, “He in turn promised to let me have the nursing laws, journals (they have medical journals including pages edited by nurses) and any material I ask for. Professor Lebedenko said he did not see why after the war the nurses in Russia should not have their own professional association and be allowed to join the ICN.”120 But a livid Dock blamed the US government for kiboshing the nurses’ efforts, leaving her with a “bitter and justifiable grievance against the so-called Truman Doctrine.”121 The absence of Russian nurses at the ICN meeting in Atlantic City, New Jersey, in 1947, left her crestfallen: “[They who] served through the War, who suffered everything—devastation, ruin, even imprisonment—starvation, torture and outrage, are to be left out, as if Russia had been an enemy instead of our strongest ally.”122 The immediate postwar efforts of Dock, Schwarzenberg, and others were to no avail, and Soviet nurses remained on the margins internationally.\n\nWhere Care Begins\n\nIn the late 1940s many nurses had been through several years of war. They worked day and night in terrible conditions and saw those around them suffer and die. After a war in which about twenty-seven million people died (the higher numbers were not fully disclosed until the late 1980s), nurses had to adjust to daily life in a hospital or clinic. “The true Soviet way of coping with emotion,” notes one historian, “was to keep working and salute the flag.”123 Still, the disjuncture between war and peacetime work was noticeable. In its first issue of 1947, Nurse’s editors ran a cover story expressing concern about the level of devotion of some nurses who did not see their job as a vocation and did not enjoy spending time at the patient’s bedside. Nurses were reminded that “yesterday’s soldiers are today’s workers, servicemen, and war invalids” and they should be respectful, caring, and loving toward those who had sacrificed so much for the country.124 Another article later that year also reminded nurses that nursing work was not crude but often “consisted of crude work” that could not be avoided when caring for very ill patients. Nursing was a “humane profession” that every “cultured” Soviet nurse undertook with honor.125 If nurses wanted to become doctors that was fine, but they were not to “belittle” the nursing profession.126 The barrage of messages about the important and noble work of nurses suggested that an element of compassion fatigue might have set in after the war and that this, alongside inadequate training, harmed the quality of care.\n\nOften these concerns became criticisms when cases of medical negligence and incompetence arose. It transpired that some nurses did not even adhere to the basic rules of hand hygiene, did not sterilize needles, or did not know how to take a pulse.127 In a Medical Worker article, the correspondent and candidate of medical science I. Trop wrote that nurses in a Sverdlovsk physiotherapy institution made many mistakes, including increasing dosages at the patient’s request.128 Although nurse conferences took place at the institution, Trop believed nurses would be better off “discussing their experiences” rather than presenting “abstract speeches.”129 Commentators tended to blame nursing inadequacies on poor training, general carelessness, and lack of organization and leadership in the hospital. Economic issues and the difficulties of the war were cited as reasons too, but the overwhelming argument forwarded for the shortcomings of nurses was a lack of interest in patient care.\n\nThe medical press presented hospital workers as indifferent to insanitary conditions in wards, patient needs, and their duties.130 One Moscow hospital encouraged nurses to spend more time with patients to improve care.131 In an ideal world all hospitals would have enough staff to facilitate better patient care, but, as it was, there were simply too many patients and too few nurses. Mistakes were inevitable. If nurses were inadequately trained and overworked, it was the fault of state institutions. If they were suffering from compassion fatigue and exhaustion, then it was the responsibility of the state to take better care of its nurses. War veterans and invalids in need of physical and mental attention could seek help, but what about nurses? As Christie Watson writes, the mental health impact of war focuses on men, not the many women alongside them.132 How did nurses process the brutality of war and cope with the traumatic injuries, violence, and death that they encountered? Experienced nurses have often written about numbing themselves to pain and suffering to do their jobs. Self-care and self-preservation are important for nurses; compassion starts with the individual, with the self. Those nurses who struggled to provide compassionate care after the war were perhaps in need of care themselves.\n\nWatson recalls that in her job as a nurse in the United Kingdom she worked with many kind, compassionate nurses, but she recognizes that a good nurse can have a bad day and that “it is hard to be kind when you are undervalued by society, by your employers and by the media.” Exhaustion and burnout, she argues, are common and serious. Compassion fatigue, first diagnosed in 1950, could have a “terrible impact” on a nurse’s “ability to provide the quality care, kindness and compassion that patients need and deserve.”133 Nurses in a trauma situation, in Watson’s eloquent words, “repeatedly swallow a fragment of the trauma—like a nurse who is looking after an infectious patient, putting herself at risk of infection.” There is no doubt that there were thousands of Soviet nurses and medical workers suffering from compassion fatigue or posttraumatic stress disorder, or both. Expecting these broken-down nurses to be respectful and caring toward their patients was asking too much of them. No matter how good or committed some Soviet nurses were, there were undoubtedly those who felt undervalued. One nurse devoted to the well-being of her patients noted that “if a doctor shouts at a nurse, especially in front of their patient,” she then “loses confidence and begins to make little mistakes.”134 It also made patients nervous. This was a nurse who had worked in a field hospital in Stalingrad and had written to Nurse for information about nursing patients with gangrene. She was “lucky” to receive the support of the head surgeon, Tamara Genrikhovna Bruk, in the hospital for war invalids where she worked, but this was support offered on an individual rather than an institutional basis.135 After the war, the Soviet government did not want to be “associated with trauma, ambiguity, and societal division.”136 The troublesome features of a violent war were papered over. The transcendent power of ideology would heal broken bodies and minds.\n\nA Culture of Care\n\nIn the late 1940s the state placed a huge emphasis on nurses providing patients with a cultured experience. As a series of campaigns against the intelligentsia, the West, and Jews got under way, systematic commitment to cultural and ideological education pervaded medical institutions.137 Stalinist modes of operation from the 1930s returned: narratives of care functioned as a useful counterpoint to political campaigns and a culture of fear. Propaganda and press campaigns assured citizens that the Soviet state would see to their every need and ensure their good health and well-being. Once again, nurses became important ambassadors of care.\n\nCare was to be cultured. Cleanliness, order, and patient comfort were important.138 As the author of one Nurse article wrote, “[Wards] should have one or two armchairs and a writing desk as well as games, newspapers, books, flowers and plants.” Medical workers were to provide moral support to patients by chatting to them, discussing politics, books, or films. Distracting patients would help them to focus on their recovery rather than “their suffering.”139 Medical institutes and schools were to educate students in the “spirit of Soviet patriotism.”140 This move toward a cultured care fit in with the postwar generation’s sense of patriotism and belief in socialist values.141 The government’s modus operandi was to raise the ideological level of medical workers, especially junior medical workers and service personnel, who were not all literate.142 One medical club organized “Nurse Tuesdays” featuring nursing talks on different themes, such as “caring for the sick with brain trauma.” The “Nurse Tuesdays” were apparently very popular among medical workers.143\n\nSimilar efforts were under way in Kiev’s October hospital. The head of the clinical department for neurological illnesses, Dr. Kushnir, had struggled to find information about organizing cultural work in hospitals and so had drawn on examples from industry.144 He believed that improving the service to patients would help them medically but also ideologically. To this end, Kushnir organized lectures, film screenings, and concerts. Patients could also avail of a library stocked with over three hundred books and journals that many staff and patients’ relatives had donated.145 Nurses were to be “humane” and the closest person to the patient.146 In the October hospital, plans to raise the cultural level of both staff and patients got under way in 1947. That year, to improve their qualifications, doctors attended lessons on Mondays, nurses on Tuesdays (evidently a convenient day for nurses), and orderlies on Wednesdays.147 On Thursdays all department staff worked with newspaper material to enhance their political and cultural level, while on Saturdays they attended talks about Lenin and Stalin. A conference dedicated to learning about the party took place every other Friday.148 In Soviet hospitals cultured care also extended to the appearance of the nurse, with new uniforms introduced to distinguish senior, middle, and junior personnel.149\n\nPolitics and ideology returned with a vengeance as part of the effort to improve the cultural service to patients. In Moscow’s Botkin hospital the biography of Stalin and a short course on the history of the party formed part of the program to raise the educational and cultural levels of nurses.150 The political-ideological classes held there were “checked twice a month,” and the nurse bureau would report the results to the deputy head doctor. The nurse bureau also had to oversee the improvement of nurse qualifications and cultural standards.151 But not all hospitals were on top of raising these matters. The head doctor of the Vasilevskaia hospital in Moscow’s Noginskii District was “morally corrupt and drunk,” while the medical service to patients there was “bad.”152 At the medical union’s Central Committee plenum in December 1949, the representative of the Moscow Province trade union committee, Shaulin, was critical of the medical union. He claimed that medical workers (some 70%) did not have Marxist-Leninist education, and it was “up to the trade union” to provide this knowledge.153 As the Soviet Union recovered from war, its exhausted medical workforce had to engage with politics and ideology as part of their training and education. For the Stalinist state, cultural and ideological education would be the antidote to the trauma of war.\n\nAs Soviet society hurtled full throttle into war in 1941, medical workers joined in a widespread effort to defend socialism. But the war left the Soviet Union economically devastated, leaving infrastructure, factories, and farms in the western and most industrially and agriculturally developed part of its territory in ruins. Families were torn apart and spent the postwar years coming to terms with death, destruction, and the trauma of war. Invalids, demobilized soldiers, and medical workers at the front returned to a victorious but shattered land. They had to adapt to a new world. Those who had ventured beyond Soviet borders during the war realized that socialism was not the paradise propaganda would have them believe (if they ever believed that). The postwar Soviet space had considerably altered; physically it was in need of total reconstruction, but the new Soviet men and women that the state attempted to forge in the 1920s and 1930s were now sick, maimed, homeless, malnourished, traumatized, or dead.\n\nFour years of brutal war and violence produced a population desperately in need of care, yet medical workers had little time to recover from their own battle scars. The state called on the doctors, nurses, orderlies, and other workers who had cared for comrades at the home front or on the front lines not only to continue this work but also to provide a cultured service. In the late Stalinist period, the needs of nurses were secondary to those of patients. There was no significant discussion of the nursing profession or the trauma that medical workers experienced during the war. Rather than reflect on the wartime experience and come to terms with it, the Soviet state instead drove forward. This was the case for medical workers in all aspects of healthcare, including those working in the area of mental health and psychiatry—the focus of chapter 8."
