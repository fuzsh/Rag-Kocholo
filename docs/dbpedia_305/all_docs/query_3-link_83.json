        "text": "State > Capital > Millenium of Kazan\n\nMillenium of Kazan\n\nHistorical background\n\nKazan, a city with a thousand-year history, is situated near the great river Volga on the crossroad of ancient trade-routes, joining Europe and Asia, East and West. Different ages have added to the architectural appearance of Kazan. The synthesis of Russian and Tatar culture and the whole history of the city, which witnessed Tatar, Italian and Russian architects, survived the ages of the Bulgars and Golden Horde, are reflected in the Kazan Kremlin ensemble. Fortifications of the Kazan Kremlin and marvelous side-view of the Suyumbike Tower are considered to be symbols of Kazan far outside Tatarstan.\n\nKazan is proudly called «The World Capital of Tatars». «The largest ancient city of Russia and the most ancient among large ones». The city has mixed population (over 1 200 000) with equal numbers of Russians and Tatars, and hundreds of other nationalities.\n\nFor last decades of the XX century Tatarstan scientists and researchers from Moscow, Saint Petersburg and other cities of Russia together with foreign colleagues from Hungary, Austria, France, Czechia, Turkey, Egypt and Scandinavia have carried out deep scientific researches on the origin of the city. Ten unexplored manuscripts, 56 unknown maps where under different names the city was pointed on the place of modern Kazan were found in foreign archival depositories. Twenty archeological excavations were carried out in the territory of Kazan. More than two thousand archeological finds were discovered: different ceramics, arm, rare coins, furnishings, leather and metal artifacts and objects of life. Three international conferences were held on the results of scientific researches and investigations. In 1999 the final international conference «Medieval Kazan: origin and development» took place in the city, bringing together 150 scientists from 16 countries. Participants of the Conference adopted a resolution on the origin of the city of Kazan in the late X-th – early XI-th century, namely in 1004-1005.\n\nOn September 1, 1999, the Presidents of the Russian Federation and the Republic of Tatarstan issued a decree «On celebration of the 1000th anniversary of the city of Kazan». According to these decrees, celebration of the 1000th anniversary of the city of Kazan will be held in August, 2005.\n\nFoundation of the city of Kazan is linked with ancient history of Tatar nation and its direct ancestors – the Volga Bulgars who built up the state of Volga Bulgaria in this region. The city of Kazan was founded at the favorable intersection of the trade routes of Europe and Asia on the brink of X-XI-th centuries as permanent center of the Volga bulgars. In 922 a famous traveler Ibn Fadlan visited Volga Bulgaria. In his notes he mentioned the great fortification on the place of modern Kazan.\n\nLittle by little Kazan became one of the most beautiful Bulgar cities. The city was a trade point with wide international contacts. Merchants from Hungary, Kiev Russia, Czechia, countries of Middle Asia and Arab countries visited Kazan. Finds on the territory of Kazan Kremlin testifies this: Czech coin – the earliest and unique for today, minted in 929-930, Arabic coins – silver dirham of the X-th century, Hungarian cover plate, beads, bracelets, ceramics. The Great Volga Route and the North Fur Route passed through Kazan.\n\nThe Golden Horde period of development of the city started in 30-40th of the XIII-th century. In the era of power and fall of Golden Horde Kazan changed into important administrative and religious center and grew up as a large city where handicraft industry and international trade prospered. The beauty of architectural Kazan surprised western and eastern travelers, especially by its European-Asian appearance.\n\nJust in that period took place a final formation of a new nation, which was named Tatars of Volga and near Ural.\n\nAfter disintegration of Golden Horde into separate states Kazan became a capital of powerful independent state in the Middle Volga called Kazan Khanate. It was the time (1445-1552) of political, religious, economical and cultural prosperity of Kazan. But critical ideological and military opposition of Kazan Khanate with Muscovy finished by the defeat and conquest of Kazan by Ivan the Terrible in October 2, 1552. Most Moslem monuments and cultural values were destroyed in the fire of war.\n\nFrom the second half of the XVI-th century Kazan became the eastern gate of growing Russia, the city of moslem-christian contacts, competition and cooperation.\n\nIn the XVIII-th century Kazan occupied the third place among cities of Russia by its population. At the period of Peter’s the Great ruling Kazan became the capital of Kazan province. At that time industrial production appeared and the shipyards were established in Kazan. Caravans of trade ships went up and down the Volga.\n\nMuch useful was done for Kazan by Catherine II. She gave Muslims the freedom of conscience and trade, approved the first general city plan, allowed to build mosques/ She also issued ukase «on allowing Tatar Knyazes and Murzas to take all the priority of Russian nobility». The families of Akchurins, Yenikeyevs, Kugushevs, Kudashevs, Tenishevs and others were re-entitled. Muezzins on minarets summoned people to prayers in new monumental mosques built in traditions of Tatar architecture. Several madrasah were established. Kazan was reborn as a new «oriental beauty».\n\nCatherine II after her visit to Kazan in 1767 wrote, «Kazan is the second, just after the Moscow, …the capital of the state».\n\nIn July 12, (1774) 20-thousand-men army of Yemelian Pugachev took Kazan by storm. The rebels were cannonading Kazan Kremlin for 2 days at almost no success. But the Kremlin was severely damaged. Dozens of churches and convents were sacked. In July 14 the army of Pugachev was forced to retreat. By the beginning of XIX-th century Kazan had been recovered and rebuilt, according to the official development plan, to get a genuine capital look.\n\nIn 1804, the University was opened in Kazan. Its importance in the making of Russian science is great, the scientists of the world level as N.I.Lobachevsky, I.M.Simonov, N.N.Zinin, A.M.Butlerov and many others worked there. The university building in the style of Russian classicism is a decoration of the Kazan historical center.\n\nBroad network of Muslim educational institutions promoted general level of literacy.\n\nIn the early XX-th century, the national morale of Tatars arose, culture and education developed. After the revolution of 1905-1907 first Tatar newspapers, magazines and books were issued.\n\nIn 1917 Kazan became the second city after the Petrograd (St-Petersburg) where Soviet power was declared.\n\nThe foundation of Tatar Autonomous Soviet Socialistic Republic in 1920 shaped Kazan's life and appearance. A large industrial area appeared on the bank of the Kazanka river to the north from the city center.\n\nAt the same time most of Muslim and Orthodox buildings disappeared one by one. Tatar literature (together with all the writings and show-bills) was transliterated in 1929 to Latin and in 1939 to Cyrillic alphabet. The word «oriental» in the names of the first soviet educational institutions was replaced with «state».\n\nMany things changed in the period of World War II. The greatest scientists, musicians, writers, artists were evacuated to Kazan and were working here. Many industrial enterprises were also evacuated here. Many of those thousands of Kazanners, who had gone to the front became the Heroes of the Soviet Union. In the postwar years Kazan changed. In 1950s with the formation of Kuybyshev reservoir 10 dams with a total length of 25 km were build. The old city center was became surrounded by new growing districts.\n\nIndustrial and cultural construction was developing rapidly in the city at that period. It becomes aircraft constructing, medical and chemical center of Russia. The production of its enterprises is in demand and being exported to many countries of the world.\n\nKazan today\n\nFor the last ten years scientific and public institutions, administrative bodies of the city have been actively participating in the work of different international associations. The city gains international recognition. Kazan is the full member of ten international organizations. For today representative bodies of the city concluded cooperation agreements in business –economical, scientific, technical and cultural spheres with 12 cities of Russian Federation and 15 cities of Commonwealth of Independent States.\n\nToday Kazan is one of the largest economical, scientific, cultural centers and ancient cities of Russian Federation. The city is a place of residence of 1.2 mln people and more than 100 nationalities and it combines the unity of two parts – the East and the West with great harmony. This fact explains diversity of confessional and religious associations located on its territory: Moslems, Christians and some others. Twenty-three mosques, sixteen Orthodox temples, Lutheran church, Catholic chapel, Jewish synagogue function here.\n\nAt the session of the UNESCO intergovernmental commission held in Kerne (Australia) in November 2000, Kazan Kremlin was officially enlisted as the object of World Heritage. Kazan is recognized a full member of the World Heritage Cities Organization. In 2002 under the aegis of the Council of Europe with the assistance of European Association of Historic Cities and Regions the International Symposium «Cultural Diversity in Historic Cities – Key to Sustainable Future» was held. Representatives from more than 26 countries took part in it.\n\nKazan is the city of theatres, museums, the city of music, international festivals, rich libraries, newest technologies and new partnership relations. Modern Kazan is a large scientific educational and student center of the Russian Federation, it includes 13 institutions of Kazan Scientific Center of the Russian Academy of Sciences and Academy of Sciences of the Republic of Tatarstan, 30 institutes of higher education, 23 technical secondary institutions.
