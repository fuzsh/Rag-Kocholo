        "text": "Inside Soviet Film Satire: Laughter with a Lash is a lively collection of sixteen original essays by Soviet and American scholars and film commentators. It is the first in-depth examination of an important genre within the Soviet film tradition. From its origins, humor and satire have been closely linked in Soviet cinema. Nowhere in this tradition is there the pure comic genre typified in the West in films by Charlie Chaplin or Buster Keaton; by contrast, Soviet comedy can best be described as \"laughter with a lash.\" Films made during the early years of the communist regime depicted characters and situations at a moment when the promise of socialism had yet to be realized. By the final years of totalitarian rule, filmmakers had found ways to create satiric films that powerfully indicted communism itself. Offering a general overview of the evolution of Soviet film satire during a seventy-year period, this volume also provides in-depth analyses of such classics as Kuleshov's The Extraordinary Adventures of Mr. West in the Land of the Bolsheviks; Volga, Volga, a popular musical of the Stalinist period; and the bitter and surrealistic Zero City, The Fountain, and Black Rose, Red Rose of the glasnost period. It also examines the effects of communism's collapse in 1991 on the tradition of satire and includes an interview with the renowned Soviet filmmaker Yuri Mamin.\n\nINSIDE SOVIET FILM SATIRE\n\nCAMBRIDGE STUDIES IN FILM\n\nGENERAL EDITORS\n\nHenry Breitrose, Stanford University William Rothman, University of Miami ADVISORY BOARD Dudley Andrew, University of Iowa Anthony Smith, Magdalen College, Oxford Colin Young, National Film School OTHER BOOKS IN THE SERIES FiJm and Phenomenology, by Allan Casebier Chinese Cinema: Culture and Politics Since 1949, by Paul Clark The Gorgon's Gaze: German Cinema, Expressionism, and the Image of Horror, by Paul Coates Nonindi/ferent Nature: Film and the Structure of Things, by Sergei Eisenstein (trans.

It seems that the satiric verve along with Russia's cultural tradition is, unlike the Union, still alive. This fact makes the present retrospective even more interesting, in a way like a postmortem. Andrew Horton has succeeded where everybody else failed: In New Orleans (Loyola University), he gathered a group of Russian and American scholars with very different backgrounds, both academic and practical, and made them speak the unspeakable: about satire in a totalitarian state. And each speaker discovered and proved from his or her own perspective not only that satiric films did exist, but that they constituted the most subversive genre in the vast domain reigned over by Socialist Realism. In a way, the posttotalitarian seriousness we have experienced since the beginning of perestroika and glasnost, down to the farcical conclusion with the August Coup (1991), proves to be a backlash from the previous Aesopian power and satiric perspective cherished by many Russian, Ukrainian, Georgian, and other filmmakers in the former Soviet Union. This book is as much testimony as it is an investigation into the unknown or, better, never-acknowledged territory of Soviet film satire. Not just Yuri Mamin - the only filmmaker present among the scholars - but every ex-Soviet writer relies on his or her own experience in shaping satire. As for the Americans within this collection, they bring an inter textual perspective in an easy, almost nonacademic style. And one is even tempted to try and satirize the American analysis of Russian feelings (or the \"Slavic soul\") about film and life as a kind of global satire. \"Situation hopeless, but not serious\" would thus also be a way to describe the present realities in the former Soviet Union.

My thanks to all of the others not represented in this collection who made the New Orleans Conference on the Spirit of Satire in Soviet Cinema possible: to Anna Lawton, who was the coorganizer of the conference; and to Romana Bahry of York University; Daniel Goulding of Oberlin College; Sergei Lavrentiev, a leading Soviet film critic; and Peter Shepotinnik, an editor of the influential Moscow-based film journal Iskusstvo kino. I also extend a hearty thanks to Loyola University of New Orleans for providing many services and some of the funding for the conference together with the Louisiana Endowment for the Humanities for a minigrant that made it possible to bring Yuri Mamin to New Orleans. All photos appear thanks to Sovexport Film and the Kinocenter of Moscow. Finally, hats off to all filmmakers in all of the republics and provinces that were the Soviet Union who are still able to see satire and humor in the darkest moments.\n\nIX\n\nIn transliterating Russian terms and names into English, this volume adheres to the Library of Congress system (with the elimination of the apostrophe-designated soft sign in the text). Exceptions have been made in the case of Russian names that have become widely known under a different system of transliteration. Every attempt has been made to standardize terminology and documentary references in the chapters, but this does not exclude the possibility of exceptional usages in the style of individual authors. There is often considerable variation in the English translation of Russian film titles. We have tried to be consistent even where there are no \"standard\" English versions of titles.\n\nxi\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nCarnival versus lashing laughter in Soviet cinema\n\nI adhere to the tradition of laughing while the lash swishes. Mine is a laughter of destruction. Sergei Eisenstein Satire is a sort of glass, wherein beholders do generally discover everybody's face but their own. Jonathan Swift\n\nHeaded for the promised sky We never had a good civilization, but we always had a good culture. Viktor Yerofeyev (Shapiro, \"Ablest Soviets Flee for Better Lives\") It's a dark, snowy, cold Russian night, and a large group of the Moscow homeless have been surrounded by police and soldiers and commanded to leave their shantytown so that an American-Soviet joint venture hotel and condom factory can be built on the spot where the poor have been living. 'This is our land and we are not going to leave it,\" calls out the president, the leader of the homeless who acts like a not-so-distorted copy of Gorbachev and looks remarkably like Albert Einstein. But the official forces will not listen. They move in with tanks and riot troops, crushing all in their path. The poor gather on an old steam locomotive, which looks a lot like the old ''revolutionary\" trains of seventy years ago, and to everyone's surprise, the locomotive starts up and heads on down the track with the military in hot pursuit. Then a miracle happens. As soldiers and tanks fire at the train, the locomotive takes off into the winter sky, headed for \"the promised land\" followed by a pack of wild homeless dogs howling after it. And though the tanks fire away, the train is heaven bound with the homeless and the president and his ex-wife and friends all aboard. A Soviet parody of Spielberg's E.T. or De Sica's farewell to neorealism, Miracle in Milan (1951), in which all the homeless of Milan take off through the Italian heavens? Both. And more. 1\n\nCarnival versus lashing laughter in Soviet cinema\n\n\"The president\" of Moscow's homeless folk in Eldar Ryazanov's The Promised Sky (1991) balancing between hope and hopelessness, reality and fantasy, and tears and topical satiric laughter.\n\nThe scene described is the conclusion to Eldar Ryazanov's 1991 social comic satire, The Promised Sky (Nebesa obetovannyej, one of the very few popular Russian/ex-Soviet films of 1991. It is appropriate to begin our study of Soviet film satire with this recent film for several reasons. First, Ryazanov has been the undisputed master of Soviet comic satire for almost three decades, and as Greta Slobin's essay suggests, his Forgotten Melody for a Flute (Zabytaya melodiya diyafleity, 1987) was the first fullbodied gJasnost film. Thus, The Promised Sky brings us full circle: Clearly after the August ''revolution\" of 1991, we have entered a postSoviet and, in a real sense, a post-perestroika phase. Our collection ends, therefore, at this borderline but traces back to the origins of Soviet satire\n\nCarnival versus lashing laughter in Soviet cinema\n\nYefim, the poor Jewish tinker (Roland Bykov), whose good humor and satiric wit help humanize the coldly Communist female commissar in Commissar (1967).\n\nin Russian and world literature and culture. These essays bring us as far as the end of the Soviet Union: What happens next in the world of satire and culture is yet to be written and filmed. We should add that Ryazanov's fantasy triumph with its wink to the audience suggesting both Spielberg and De Sica suggests from the beginning a prime characteristic of satire: its double-edged ambiguity. Nothing is inherently funny, satiric, tragic, or absurd (Horton, Comedy/ Cinema/Theory, p. 1). Context and perspective are all. (E.g., think how much of British humor is lost on American audiences.) Commissar (1967), a serious film about Jews in the Soviet Union, has its moments of true humor and wit. Ryazanov's comic triumph is, therefore, as Eisenstein would say (and we shall explain), \"laughter with a lash/* for it is only a triumph within the film narrative. Our laughter is coupled with the realization that, in real life, locomotives don't fly to heaven and the homeless do get shoved away to build hotels and factories. (It is a fascinating irony that at the same time that The Promised Sky was playing to large crowds in the\n\nCarnival versus lashing laughter in Soviet cinema\n\n4\n\nSoviet Union, Americans were lining up to see Robin Williams and Jeff Bridges in The Fisher King, which tackles the same themes and same amount of \"magic realism\" using New York City as a landscape.) It is this territory between laughter, irony, ambiguity, reality, and comic triumph that we will explore as we focus on the intersection of satire and Soviet cinema up to and including 1991. This collection of original essays is dedicated to the fact that even during the darkest hours under Stalin, Soviets always laughed. If the comic can represent the purest form of laughter, then satire, our object of desire in this anthology, is by general consensus a form of purposeful laughter. Voltaire ends his satiric novel Zadig with the words \"Yes, but. . . . \" In a real sense, any satirist, Soviet or otherwise, works within such a double awareness of the need to suggest a \"but,\" an alternative vision/perspective/reality. But as these essays testify, satire is perhaps the slipperiest of genres, the one most misunderstood, abused, and in danger of falling into something else, be it pathos, bathos, self-pity, farce, or pure propaganda. Most of these essays grew out of an international conference on Soviet film satire held at Loyola University, New Orleans, in October 1990. Besides the film critics and cinema scholars attending from the Soviet Union, Canada, and the United States, a special guest satiric filmmaker, Yuri Mamin, was present to delight and trouble us with his own particular form of purposeful laughter. (See Chapter XVI, \"One Should Begin with Zero: A Discussion with Satiric Filmmaker Yuri Mamin.\") The book is thus dedicated to Mamin and to all Soviet and, what we should now perhaps call \"post-Soviet,\" satirists who, for various purposes, have made generations of viewers laugh and think; for as Mamin himself has said, \"If satire becomes unnecessary, it would mean that all favorable processes in our society have come to a halt\" (New Orleans, October 1990). And, we might add, as was noted at the time of the conference, New Orleans was not perhaps an accidental tourist to the spirit of satire, for the \"city that care forgot,\" as New Orleans is often called, not only produced jazz (which itself is often a form of satire on more rigid forms of music), but also can claim to be the center of the carnivalesque in the United States, a spirit that definitely embraces satire and parody at its purest. The scope of this book is wide but not exhaustive, suggestive rather than complete. The collection divides into three sections, Part One of which addresses the specifics of the nature of satire combined with a broad view of the functioning of satire within Soviet culture. Part Two consists of essays on specific films (by Petric, Turovskaya, and Ratchford) and on cultural/political/satiric implications, plus three essays that expand our understanding of specific topics within Soviet satire: Vida Johnson's essay on satire in Tarkovsky's films, Julie Christensen's study of Georgian comic satire as reflected in the films of Eldar Shengelaya, and Olga Reizen's piece on black humor and Soviet culture/film. Finally, Part\n\nCarnival versus lashing laughter in Soviet cinema\n\n5\n\nThree considers the degree and kind of purposeful laughter that has emerged since the demise of the Communist/Socialist system in the Soviet Union and, indeed, since the collapse of the Soviet Union itself. The topography of Soviet satire Beginning with the present, we can note that the comic/satiric films emerging from the Soviet Union under glasnost call attention to a long and distinguished tradition of Russian laughter in literature (see Horton and Brashinsky, The Zero Hour). Much of that tradition has been influenced by Western models (Horace, commedia dell'arte, Shakespeare, Moliere, Addison, etc.), especially in the spirit of the eighteenth century and the Enlightenment. More specifically, Russian writers of the past learned the techniques of satire of individuals (Plautus, Terence) and of a more universal kind, comedie de caractere as practiced by Ben Jonson, Moliere, and others in which it is the \"humor\" or vice itself, rather than the person, that comes under the focus of mockery. Thus, from Gogol to Chekhov or A. N. Ostrovsky, satire and humor have generally been aimed at a \"serious\" purpose. Eisenstein, as well shall see, also followed in this tradition as he states in the egigraph: \"Mine is a laughter of destruction\" [Notes of a Film Director, p. 108). A review of Soviet cinema suggests how important comic and satiric strategies have been, even if approached ambivalently, since the beginning of the Soviet state, as Denise Youngblood's clearly stated study of Soviet cinematic laughter of the 1920s demonstrates (see Chapter III). In fact, Boris Shumyatsky, writing during 1935 in his book A Cinema for the Millions [Kinematografiya miJJionov) just before the worst Stalinist years, defended the importance of laughter-provoking films under communism with these words: Tsarist and capitalist Russia were not acquainted with happy joyful laughter in their best works. The laughter in Gogol, Shchedrin and Chekhov is accusing laughter, laughter derived from bitterness and hatred. . . . We believe that, if Gogol, Shchedrin and Chekhov were alive today, their actual laughter would in the Soviet Union acquire joie de vivre, optimism and cheerfulness. (Taylor, The Film Factory, p. 368)\n\nShumyatsky was defending Alexandrov's film Happy Guys (VeseJye rebyata), from attacks of being the \"apotheosis of vulgarity.\" His emphasis is on the sense of good clean fun that such films offered a Soviet society with a promising future under communism. Just how ludicrous a simple concept of joie de vivre turned out to be during Stalin's era is detailed by Maya Turovskaya in her revealing essay on the filmming of Alexandrov's smash hit Volga, Volga.\n\nCarnival versus lashing laughter in Soviet cinema\n\n6\n\nViewed from today's perspective, however, as seen in a film such as A Forgotten Melody for a Flute, the Soviet realm of comedy and satire has tilted back to the \"accusing laughter\" of the Enlightenment in Europe and in Russian drama and literature as well. Glasnost has provided the opportunity to use a light touch (farcical) and heavy touch (black humor as Olga Reizen and Svetlana Boym point out) to point out the shortcomings, contradictions, and failures of more than seventy years of Soviet socialism. Let us consider five characteristics of satire in a Soviet context. First, irony and accusing laughter are, in fact, a potent form of survival, an alternative world view as well as a means of offense. Irina Ratushinskaya in her searing account of her years in a women's political prison for human rights activities under Brezhnev's term, Grey Is the Color of Hope, frequently suggests how often the darkest events - such as the planting of a KGB stooge within their zone - brought on deep laughter rather than pure anger. \"It was all we could do not to collapse on the grass in helpless fits of laughter. On the whole, though, the situation might be far from funny\" (p. 88), she writes, suggesting how intimately laughter becomes, under oppression, a way of distancing oneself from the oppressors and of celebrating one's own sense of self, values, dignity. These remarks suggest what we should acknowledge but what is beyond the scope of this book, a second observation on Soviet satire: that the satiric impulse as demonstrated in jokes, ironic comments, and such is a necessary ingredient of daily life for citizens within a totalitarian or authoritarian state if they are to maintain their own sense of worth, individuality, and self-esteem. Satire in such a context within a totalitarian framework thus is both offense - an attack on the system - and defense — survival itself, psychologically, spiritually, and even physically. Luis Bunuel used to say that his mission as a satiric/surrealist filmmaker was to make even the most comfortable member of the viewing audience feel that he or she was not living in the best of all possible worlds. As these essays proclaim, the best of the Soviet satires have held a similar position. A third observation is provided by the metahistorian Hay den White, building on the work of Jacques Derrida and Michel Foucault, who suggests that the ironic/satiric stance forces the \"normal\" culture either to change or to formulate better its own perspective. According to White, the ironic/satiric/absurdist perspective forces us (and historians in particular) to ask: \"On what grounds can we assert that the insane, the criminal, and the barbarian are wrong? . . . And why should critics criticize with words while those who possess real power criticize with weapons?\" {Tropics of Discourse, p. 282). Our fourth distinction, which builds on the others and provides us with the title of our introduction, is that between carnivalesque satire and laughter, and lashing satire, has existed satire which served the State.\n\nCarnival versus lashing laughter in Soviet cinema\n\nSatire and parody at its most carnivalesque in Alia Surikova's popular spoof on Westerns and everything else including cinema itself, The Man from Capuchins Boulevard (1987). Mikhail Bakhtin explains in his essay entitled \"Epic and Novel\" how the novel developed out of popular satiric traditions of laughter at the expense of the formalized genre codes of the epic. Carnivalesque satire and laughter is a popular, folk laughter of the people, by the people, for the people, and is, in the spirit of carnival, a sanctioned, liberating attack on all authority. As Bakhtin writes: \"Laughter is a vital factor in laying down that prerequisite for fearlessness without which it would be impossible to approach the world realistically. . . . Familiarization of the world through laughter and popular speech is an extremely important and indispensable step in making possible free, scientifically knowable and artisically realistic creativity in European civilization\" (The Dialogic Imagination, p. 23). Laughter serving the State, however, serves the opposite purpose: the control of behavior that might challenge authority, as we shall discuss. Finally, I would add that satire not only appears in the daily life of the people, but it shows up throughout many films that would not be judged \"satires\" per se. Little Vera, for instance, is permeated with satiric irony, often very funny, but more often dramatic and even tragic - there is \"little\n\nCarnival versus lashing laughter in Soviet cinema\n\nSergei Soloviev's \"hyper-eccentric realism\" as viewed in Assa (1988). Stanislav Govorukhin (right), a director of such important films as We Cannot Live This Way [Tak zhiV neVzya, 1990), plays a Soviet Mafia figure in this collage rock and roll antinarrative.\n\nhope\" for little Vera in the industrial wasteland of her home city. Yet the film itself would not be called a \"satire.\" Such would be the case with much of cinema made since the advent of gJasnost, particularly postmodernist works such as Rashid Nugmanov's The Needle (Igla, 1988), Valery Ogorodnikov's Prishvin's Paper Eyes (Bumazhnye gJaza Prishvina, 1989) and Sergei Soloviev's Assa (1988). We need to briefly review the development of Russian/Soviet satire, but it may be helpful first to suggest an international context from which to view our subject. The dominant form of comedy in the world is, of course, the Hollywood version, a genre that year after year dominates the box office in terms of popularity (Horton, \"A Laughing Matter/' p. 30). In 1988, for instance, six of the top ten money-making films were comedies, led at the top by Who Framed Roger Rabbit. A definite contrast in styles and directions of comedy arises, therefore, between the predominant Soviet and\n\nCarnival versus lashing laughter in Soviet cinema\n\n9\n\nAmerican laughter of the late 1980s. Much of American comedy has been steadily losing the \"democratic\" or populist flavor that characterized it in the past in favor of a \"Reaganite\" cynical neoconservatism that ignores many contemporary issues such as racial strife, drugs, women's rights, and AIDS. Such comedy ultimately endorses the status quo rather than offering any true critique of it. (It should also be pointed out that much of this comedy is xenophobic: In Ghostbusters II, the evil threat to New York comes from \"Carpathia\" in Eastern Europe and is spearheaded by a certain Janosz Pha, looking suspiciously like Sergei Eisenstein himself as interpreted by Peter MacNicol.) In contrast, much Soviet satire in literature, film, and music in recent years has become an important voice in the critical reevaluation of Soviet values. In this sense, even though much Soviet comedy has changed from the toothless laughter in the past to a brand with an accusing tone, that tone can be read as more optimistic than the smug cynicism of many recent American comedies; for in criticism there is the hope of awareness and thus of change. Dostoevsky claimed that Gogol's short story \"The Overcoat\" is the starting point of all Russian prose. But Gogol was following in the satiric Russian tradition of reforming humankind through laughter, \"laughter through tears,\" as he defined his purpose in creating The Inspector General. To understand how Gogol's center of levity is anchored in a blend of realism and the supernatural (fantasy and the grotesque) alongside a kind of Christian sense of compassion for the insignificant and downtrodden (and to recognize how much this spirit runs throughout Russian and Soviet literature and cinema, as Valentin Tolstykh explains in Chapter I of this volume) is to see how radically different such satire is from the American \"Reaganite comedy\" of self-absorption and conservatism of the late 1980s. In Chapter II, Kevin Moss goes a long way toward explaining how \"Aesopian\" (thus, very clearly how purposeful) much of Soviet satire has become. In Chapter VIII, Moira Ratchford's study of Alexandrov's Circus explains the degree to which politically \"correct\" satire can have a backlash effect. But carnivalesque or joyful laughter in a satiric vein has existed as well. Looking to the 1920s, for instance, we see that farce, satire, what we would call \"vaudeville,\" and commedia deJJ'arte, and American \"silent comedies\" - especially those of Chaplin, Keaton, and Harold Lloyd made a strong impression on the young Soviet pioneering filmmakers. One of Lev Kuleshov's earliest and most interesting films is the lighthearted spoof, The Extraordinary Adventures of Mr. West in the Land of the Bolsheviks (Neobychainye prildiucheniia mistera Vesta v strane bol'shevikov, 1924), with actor P. Podobed appearing as a Harold Lloyd lookalike, complete with the dark-rimmed glasses, in his characterization of the American, Mr. West, who is taken in by Soviet con men through\n\nCarnival versus lashing laughter in Soviet cinema\n\n10\n\nvrcmyo (blarney) and pokarukha (deception), two national sports that have not been dulled by seventy years of socialism. The satire of capitalism is definitely light and the humor joyful and thus in the spirit of and a tribute to that \"anything goes\" flavor of American silent comedy. Finally, Vlada Petric (Chapter VI), in his contribution on the film, has noted that the \"film's subtext addresses the viewer's intimate world, touching upon ideas and judgments antithetical to the Bolshevik view of history and society.\" Dziga Vertov's Man with a Movie Camera (Chelovek s kinoapparatom, 1929) owes much of its energy and high spirits to the large number of gags and visual jokes, employing a playful use of film language, subtle and obvious, that run throughout the film, many of them with underlying suggestions of a healthy sense of sexuality. Again, the emphasis is much more on joyful and playful laughter than on satire and biting dark humor, in the spirit of Shumyatsky's description of Happy Guys. Finally, Alexander Medvedkin best represents an early Soviet director who comes closest to embodying a sense of what Mikhail Bakhtin would call \"carnival laughter.\" His Happiness (Schastye, 1935) is a surrealistic comic/satiric romp that spoofs farm life in both the tsarist and Soviet times. His innovative use of camera tricks, outrageous absurdity, and slapstick (a soldier rubbing a horse's rear end, a man sitting on the throne in an outhouse, a father and son hitting each other with spoons, etc.) still evoke uproarious laughter as evidenced by a special 1988 tribute to Medvedkin held to a full house in Dom Kino, the Filmmaker's Center, at which the eightyeight-year-old master of Soviet satire appeared in person. Laughter with a dangerous lash, Medvedkin's film is not. And Eisenstein himself writes in his autobiography, Immoral Memories (1946), that the figure he admires most is the clown. Also, in the essay \"A Few Thoughts About Soviet Comedy\" he goes further to describe Socialist laughter. American laughter is for the pure pleasure of laughter, he notes, and even Chaplin wins us over as a \"grownup behaving like a child\" [Notes of a Film Director, p. 110). For the Soviet Union, however, comedy must be satiric: \"The time has not yet come for us to indulge in carefree laughter: socialism has not yet been built. So there is no call for light heartedness. Laughter is a new kind of weapon\" [Notes of a Film Director, p. 111). None of his films is a comedy or pure satire per se, except for the short piece he shot as an insert for the well-known staged production of Even a Wise Man Stumbles. But traces of both are found particularly in his first feature, Strike [Stachka, 1924), which shows Meyerhold's strong comic/ improvisational influence in the surrealistic circuslike construction, cartoonlike caricature (especially of the fat, ugly capitalists), and heavily ironic use of montage in the film. Yet in Eisenstein's hands, the satire is more pointed, more accusing, and more dialectic than in the films previously mentioned. For all of the comic touches, Eisenstein's climax is\n\nCarnival versus lashing laughter in Soviet cinema\n\n11\n\nliterally \"deadly\" serious and in the service of the State: In the now famous cut, he juxtaposes the shooting of workers on strike with the slaughter of a cow, ending with the message REMEMBER, PROLETARIANS! With such a didactic Marxist message, Eisenstein goes far beyond the confines of the more general and good-natured social satire of the popular playwright Alexander Ostrovsky (1823-86) in his Wiseman and other popular works. Between these twin poles of laughter - Eisenstein's highly accusatory/ moralistic perspective and Medvedkin's liberating/irreverent/satiric pleas u r e - t h e satiric and comic/satiric muse within Russia and the Soviet Union can be seen to have developed. Satire in close-up It is my hope that this collection represents more than simply a Soviet take on satire. I would like to think that using the Soviet film tradition, up to and including a cinema of gJasnost, helps us to further consider the slippery and difficult nature of satire in general. Harry Levin in an essay on satire quotes the old Soviet joke about the distinction between socialism and capitalism: \" 'Capitalism is the exploitation of man by man and socialism is the reverse' \" (Levin, 'The Urges of Satire/' p. 12). He notes that such a joke is clearly subversive - in fact, doubly so, for it makes fun of both political ideologies, but the end result of satire is that it has no effect. Clearly, Ryazanov's multitude of distinguished satires from Garage to Forgotten Melody for a Flute and The Promised Sky, for instance, did not single-handedly or directly lead to the August revolution of 1991 or the continuing sweeping changes throughout the various republics of the Soviet Union. But I would argue with Levin that it is part of the oftensurprising nature of satire that it does make a difference, often in ways one would not expect. In Greece during the dictatorship of 1967-74, for example, it was surprising to see that some of the works banned during the first year were those of Aristophanes. Furthermore, cultural historians of the period will have to note that when the dictators stepped down in 1974, it was not because of a bloody coup but, to a surprising degree, because they were laughed out of office. For the Greeks, political jokes, topical satire, are simply a way of life. Likewise for the Soviets, I would suggest that satire has made a difference both on a personal and cultural/sociopolitical level even if \"satire\" does not appear clearly delineated on surveys or scientific charts. The difficulty, as Levin points out, is in measuring this difference. We have described satire as purposeful, even when that purpose is the pure sense of liberation sanctioned by carnival. But besides being a form of pamphleteering, propaganda, and offense against a designated target\n\nCarnival versus lashing laughter in Soviet cinema\n\n12\n\nenemy, satire does also embody laughter as psychic release and thus as a survival tool for the individual rather than an instrument of social change. Levin does rightly say that this twin mode of an urge for liberal change and yet for conservative survival between which satire, like a radioactive particle, vibrates suggests that, ultimately, satire should be considered iconoclastic. That is, the satirist strives to shatter images: \"The end of satire is reformation, affirmed Defoe. Reformation can look backward as well as forward. The satirist is an ipso facto moralist, promoting the good by excoriating the bad according to his lights\" (\"The Wages of Satire,\" p. 6). The image that led Eisenstein to say he needed a lash was the dream of an unrealized socialism. The image he wished to shatter was of the past, yet the irony has been, of course, that it is with the image of socialism as practiced that so many of the practitioners of satire under gJasnost have operated, with their newly gained freedom of expression. And yet several of our contributors, including Youngblood, Tolstykh, and Reizen, suggest that in a period of rapidly changing values - or the shattering of all values - reality itself becomes more absurd than a satirist can portray, and the pressures of mere survival make the distance that laughter requires difficult or impossible. On a final note, satire remains an often thankless (and too often, a dangerous) field of artistic discourse. As Canadian novelist Robertson Davies notes, \"Countries that are not always sure of their own identity are understandably suspicious of satirists\" (Levin, \"The Wages of Satire,\" p. 1). Our hope is that critical awareness itself as represented in these essays is not necessarily divorced from carnival laughter. Bibliography Bakhtin, M. M. The Dialogic Imagination. Ed.

There were periods when no satiric films appeared on the screen in years and, when having appeared, caused desolate irritation or open dislike on the part of the authorities and official critics. Filmmakers working in this genre were always scarce, and there are no critics and theoreticians who have really analyzed film satire on a systematic basis with the possible exception of Rostislov Turenev, the author of critical works on Soviet comedy. The situation is almost a paradox. Social reality, that is, literally speaking, overwhelmed and oversaturated everything else with tragic and satiric events with the result that nobody is seriously interested in the development of tragedy and satire as aesthetic genres. I combine these two genres intentionally. They are closely connected in their ability to tell the whole truth and by the unity and community of their substantial basis. They are two sides or poles of human existence: Something that is tragic on one level, on another becomes the object of exposure and ridicule. Satire is tragic and tragicomic in its essence, causing audiences not simply to laugh, but to laugh with despair, indignation, or anger: \"laughter through tears,\" as Hegel said. In speaking of Yuri Mamin's Fountain and Vaghif Mustafayev's The Villain, Andrew Horton was right to note that the phenomena depicted in these films is not funny at all, but the audiences burst out in laughter all the time while watching these films (Soviet Screen, no. 5, 1990). Similar to tragedy, satire counts on the emotional shock in the cinema, on the state of aesthetic dismay and indignation, and on the enlightening catharsis that tragedy or the absurd creates in the long run. The problem is that the demand for such a shock appears to be an unfitting luxury under the conditions of totalitarian systems or existence in the \"barracks.\" Satire and tragedy demand a certain level of selfreflection and self-awareness. They emerge from this feeling of disharmony, the \"abnormality\" of daily life, thinking, and being. And they are 17\n\nThe long view: Soviet satire in context\n\n18\n\ninconceivable in a place where the spirit of social complacency and selfdeception claim the throne. During the period from 1960 to 1985, only five or six satiric films were released: Welcome (Klimov, 1964), Scratch My Back and I'll Scratch Yours (Serov, 1976), Garage (Ryazanov, 1980) and a few, very few, others. And this was in spite of the growing crisis, the accumulation of social contradictions. The atmosphere of ideological intolerance and constant pressure on filmmakers excluded any possibility of openly conversing, of showing social shortcomings on screen, or of critically depicting reality that correspond with the nature of satiric view. That is why filmmakers had to use allegorical forms, \"teasing\" audiences, using Aesopian language, counting on the spectators catching the allusions, which undoubtedly diminished the force of exposure and ridicule. However, \"the higher pressure is, the sharper satire becomes,\" states Shaftsbury. Thus, the situation has changed recently. There are no forbidden themes or censors anymore. Satiric films are being shown at the international film festivals and are being awarded, including those already mentioned: The Fountain and The ViJJain. Satiric motives and means are being broadly used in many films from different genres. We can remember Zero City (Shakhnazarov, 1989), Prishvin's Paper Eyes (Ogorodnikov, 1989), Black Rose Is the Emblem for Sadness, Red Rose Is the Emblem for Love (Soloviev, 1989), and others. Influential film critics maintain that satiric comedy has become a leading genre and an important trend in the cinema of glasnost and perestroika. They even say that too many satiric films are being produced now and that the viewers feel nostalgic about the old \"comforting cinema.\" I consider these reservations to be groundless and talks about the \"flourishing\" of the satiric genre to be a huge exaggeration. True satire today remains as scarce as other products today. The reasons for this are different, however. What are they? Unfortunately, not everything that is called \"satire\" today belongs to the genre. It seems that filmmakers of many of these films are busy trying to deal with their human and creative complexes that have nothing to do with art. I don't see any special courage or artistic revelation or even any special need and reason in ridiculing and mocking our distant, and even our near, past as is \"suddenly\" being done by our filmmakers recently. I do not trust these many attempts to show in black colors all that was worshiped or treated with respect or was silently endured yesterday. Of course, it is possible to find pleasure in revenge and comfort in mischievousness. We can see all that on the screen in abundance. But there is no pain, shame, remorse: \"tears that are not seen to the world,\" said Hegel. And there can be no true satire without these. But there is \"eksposing\" art, so named mockingly by Dostoevsky.\n\nSoviet film satire yesterday and today\n\n19\n\nI don't know what others think, but I don't feel any delight when I see characters in films dancing on Brezhnev's portrait or a naked girl appearing next to Stalin's face. Real satire is always a cry of dismay and shame that can be levelled only by a sense of humor. Speaking of true satire, I want to stress that Yuri Mamin is a true satirist in the purely classical sense. I became even more convinced that this is true after seeing his new film Whiskers (1990). From my point of view, this film is a social and artistic event simultaneously. Outstripping all other genres, it is a satire that exposes not the past but the present contemporary Soviet reality perestroika - that gave birth, as we have come to learn, to its own myths, legends, fetishes. Mamin is very precise in showing phemonena, collisions, and characters who will soon occupy the whole scene of this historical drama, casting our long-suffering country in another social experiment, another \"Big Leap\" with unpredictable consequences. While journalists argue about the possibility of a military or some other kind of coup, and how it will happen and when, Whiskers vividly describes the circumstances and people who are clearing the way for this possible coup armed with enthusiasm and new ideas that sound like slogans or slogans that sound like ideas. There can be various explanations as to why satire is still so rare on the Soviet screen. In the perception of many filmmakers, this genre is not only dangerous but too \"low\" because of its ideological openness and inevitable onesidedness in depicting life and people. But another explanation seems to be more precise. There is no other art genre in which deficiency of character and ideals is felt so deeply. Satiric character cannot exist without an ideal or at least a longing for the ideal. Negation for the sake of negation is not able to give birth to satire. Sometimes, filmmakers use exaggeration, the grotesque, even fantasy and the absurd to hide their impotence, unable to grasp the essence of what is going on in reality. Thus, these new films are called \"chernukha\" (self-exposure) films that only point to the dark side of life. Meanwhile, satiric negation involves the light spread by the ideal, from truth and hope, that laughter itself carries. People in my country are tired from \"hopeless\" chernukha, from the feeling of desperation that is so generously spilled all over the screen. They want to know what they can hope for, parting with the past through laughter.\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nA Russian Munchausen: Aesopian translation\n\nTot samyj Mjunxgauzen (The Very Same Munchausen} was one of the most popular Soviet made-for-TV films of the late seventies. The tall tales of the eighteenth century German baron, which form the basis for the screenplay by Grigorij Gorin, are known and loved the world over. The prototype for the legend, Hieronymus Karl Friederich, Freiherr von Miinchhausen, fought in the Russian service against the Turks before retiring to his estate, where he hunted and entertained. The legendary Munchausen was born through the publication in 1785 of Baron Munchausen 's Narrative of his Marvellous Travels and Campaigns in Russia, which made the real baron something of a tourist attraction in his own lifetime. The original text, written in English by the German refugee Rudolf Erich Raspe, was soon translated into German by Gottfried August Burger, and within two years it had gone through six English editions and been translated into French as well. New editions meant new additions to Raspe's original, and translators also felt free to embellish and edit as they saw fit. We have then a work in Russian about a German character originally documented in English. For the English reader, additional interest is provided by the exotic settings of some of the adventures: Russia, Turkey, the Indies. But these apparently did not interest Gorin: He did not set his play about the baron in Russia, strangely enough, but at the baron's home in Germany, and the film was shot in the GDR. The film is not a mere screen adaptation of the baron's famous adventures. In fact, there is very little of the original Munchausen left in Gorin's version: the setting, the character of the baron, some of his tall tales. Most of Gorin's plot is invented. What made Gorin's Munchausen so popular? His Soviet version of the Munchausen stories can be read as an Aesopian commentary on Soviet reality. In a sense, he translates the legend of Munchausen into Aesopian language, and the task of the audience is to translate that language into the practical language of criticism. Let us begin with a synopsis of Gorin's plot. Baron Karl Munchausen has been separated from his wife Jakobina and their son Theophilus for a 20\n\nA Russian Munchausen: Aesopian translation\n\n21\n\nnumber of years. Now he wants to marry his beautiful mistress Marta, but this requires the permission of the authorities - the pastor and the Duke. The Baroness, who does not want a divorce, has her lover Ramkopf steal a page from the Baron's day book to prove to the authorities that Munchausen is insane. Among other things, the Baron has scheduled a war with Englend at 4:00 on that day. He is arrested for overstepping his authority, but released immediately when it transpires that the war will not take place, since England has freed the colonies, the condition set by the Baron for not declaring war. At the divorce proceedings, all goes well until the Baron declares his new discovery - an extra day in the year - and signs the papers with the date May 32. This is construed as contempt of court, the divorce is off, Marta is upset, and pressure is put on the Baron to renounce all of his inventions and tall tales. The Baron consents out of love for Marta, but he apparently goes insane and shoots himself. Part two picks up the story some years later. The once skeptical Jakobina, Ramkopf, and Theophilus now preside over a growing cult of Munchausen. They lead tours of his castle, describe his exploits, set up monuments, and publish his works. After his death, Munchausen has become a national hero. But the Baron is not, in fact, dead: He is living quietly with Marta incognito as the gardener Miiller. Bored of living as an ordinary man, he wants to come back to life, whereupon he is arrested as an impostor. All of the Baron's acquaintances testify that he is not himself. Since he will not renounce his identity, a public test is arranged to reenact one of the Baron's exploits, the flight to the moon from a cannon. The plan is to humiliate the Baron by shooting him a few feet: The cannon has been loaded with wet powder. But the Baron learns of this and replaces the wet powder with dry. At the last minute, the Duke determines to avert a catastrophe by declaring the Baron to be himself, not an impostor, and a decree is made to the effect that the flight to the moon has been completed successfully. The Baron, whose motto throughout has been that he always tells only the truth, refuses to accept this false decree. After a few words of wisdom, he begins to climb the rope ladder into the cannon. The film ends as Munchausen continues climbing the now endless ladder into the sky. Before we attempt to analyze Gorin's Munchausen as an Aesopian text, let us specify just what we mean by \"Aesopian.\" In his On the Beneficence of Censorship: Aesopian Language in Modern Russian Literature, Lev Loseff comments on the similarity between the Aesopian utterance and the folk riddle. 1 Jurij Levin defines the riddle as \"a text whose referent is an object not overtly named in the text itself.\"2 'The pragmatic function of the text is to make the addressee name the object-referent.\"3 Similarly, the function of an Aesopian text is to make the reader name, at least to themselves, the Soviet reality to which the text does not overtly refer. While they do not name the riddle object directly, riddles can be\n\nThe long view: Soviet satire in context\n\n22\n\nguessed because they contain an \"incomplete and/or distorted (transformed, metaphoric) description of the riddle object.\"4 The same holds for Aesopian texts: While they do not refer to Soviet reality overtly, they could not function as Aesopian if they did not contain a transformed description of something that can be deciphered as a reference to Soviet realia. Both the riddle and the Aesopian text point to their referents at the same time they point away from them. Devices that function to conceal the referent Loseff calls \"screens\"; those that function to draw attention to the referent he calls \"markers.\"5 Screens and markers are really functions that many devices and elements of the text can perform. In an article on Bulgakov's The Master and Margarita, I used the term \"masking device\" to describe what Loseff means by screens.6 Bulgakov takes full advantage of the grammatical, syntactic, and lexical devices at his disposal to mask reference to the secret police. He uses, for example, the passive voice and the indefinite-personal form without mentioning the agent or logical subject involved. Levin refers to an incomplete, distorted, or metaphoric description of the riddle object; Bulgakov occasionally employs metonymy to avoid direct reference to the agents of the secret police. \"Cars\" come to pick people up and never return. 7 \"The whole floor of a certain Moscow institution\" was losing sleep over the case (p. 576). The clever reader knows how to decipher these references, filling in the gaps with the agents of the appropriate institution. Metonymic distortion of the referent functions simultaneously as a screen - since it does not name the referent itself - and as a marker since it names something contiguous to the referent. Markers are hardly needed in The Master and Margarita because the text is set in the Soviet Union in the Soviet period and the agents of the secret police play such an active role in the plot. Even so, Bulgakov's masking devices are often designed to call attention to themselves. For example, the indefinitepersonal form, which avoids reference to the agent of the action, is used with an excess of information about everything but the subject: \"On the other side of the desk [they] raised [their] voices, hinted . . . \" (p. 577). We know where they are and can deduce their emotional state, but Bulgakov conceals their identity. This oddity functions to draw attention to the masking device and therefore to its Aesopian function.8 If Gorin's Munchausen is in fact an Aesopian text, what devices function as screens, drawing attention away from the covert referent of the text, the Soviet Union? The most obvious device is the shift in setting. Gorin sets his tale not in the twentieth century and not on the territory of the Soviet Union: \"The action takes place in one of the many German principalities in the 18th century.\"9 The setting is removed both historically and geographically from modern Russia. Loseff cites Kostylev's trilogy Ivan the Terrible (as well as Eisenstein's film) and Lenin's Impe-\n\nA Russian Munchausen: Aesopian translation\n\n23\n\nrialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism as examples of Aesopian works in which temporal and geographical shifts function as screens for the covert text.10 The parallels between Ivan the Terrible and Stalin were recognized by the latter dictator himself, and Lenin's work, while overtly describing the relations between Japan and Korea, is meant as a criticism of Russian and her colonies. The genre and intended audience of Munchausen also act as screens. Munchausen clearly belongs to the genre of tall tales, fantastic hunting and war stories that have no real basis in fact. They are meant to be taken lightly, as amusement or entertainment. In the original text, the tales are apparently told in an inn or a pub to amuse the narrator's fellow drinkers: \"Since we have time, gentlemen, to crack another bottle of wine, I will tell you of a very strange adventure . . . \" a i Traditionally, the Munchausen tales have become a part of children's literature the world over. The covert references are of course to a very real Soviet Russia, and the covert audience is adult. Another typical screening device Gorin employs is translation. As the title reassures us, Gorin's Munchausen is \"the very same Munchausen\" we know from the tradition. Perhaps the story is merely an adaptation for the stage or screen and a translation into Russian? There are several events and episodes that the reader will recall from the original Munchausen: the stag which grows a cherry tree between its antlers (opening scene in the film, 31-2 in the English Munchausen; henceforth the film will be designated F, the Soviet play P, and the English text E); the horse which is cut in two by a falling portcullis (F, P: 171, E: 58-62); the episode in which the Baron lifts himself out of a swamp by his pigtail (F, P: 169, E: 67); the episode in which the Baron kills a bear by holding its paws until it dies of hunger (F, P: 143-4, E: 212). These direct quotations from the tradition are meant to support the claim that Gorin's Munchausen is the \"very same Munchausen\" - in other words, not Gorin's and not Soviet at all. Translations and quasi-translations are a popular Aesopian screening device. Pushkin's \"From Pindemonte,\" which purports to be a translation from the Italian, but is in fact an original appeal for freedom, and Okudzhava's \"Prayer of Frangois Villon,\" which is also original, provide examples of how this screen works. It is interesting to note that the title often plays a role in establishing the text as one not originating with the author. Gorin's Munchausen is at best a quasi-translation, since it does have at least some points of contact with the original version, as detailed above. One of the central episodes, while not a perfect quotation from the original, is a conflation of several authentic Munchausen episodes: the Baron's journey to the moon. In the English original, the Baron makes two journeys to the moon, one by climbing a bean plant (E: 69), the other in a\n\nThe long view: Soviet satire in context\n\n24\n\nship overtaken by a storm (E: 181-2). In Gorin's version, he has made the journey by being shot out of a cannon (F, P: 189, 193). Gorin has conflated the journey to the moon with another episode in the original, in which the Baron is shot out of a cannon, but only to land in a large haystack (E: 166); in another he rides a cannonball to inspect an enemy town (E: 63). But these few parallels in episodes only help point up the fact that Gorin's Munchausen is in fact very different from the original in plot. Instead of a collection of short, more or less unrelated stories with a great variety of setting and character, we have a unified story set in one principality with a limited cast. And aside from the peripheral episodes mentioned above, there is only a little authentic fantasy to the Soviet plot. The Baron shoots through the chimney at a duck, which falls into a platter in the fireplace cooked and ready to serve (F, P: 147); when it is not needed, he throws it out the window and it flies away (F, P: 150). A number of the Baron's eccentricities in Gorin's version seem to be connected with time. In the original, the Baron owned and used the sling with which David killed Goliath, but only because he inherited it from a Biblical ancestor (E: 155). Likewise, another ancestor was familiar with Shakespeare and had him released from prison by Queen Elizabeth (E: 156). But the Baron himself was present in neither case: He travels widely geographically, but not chronologically. Gorin's Baron, however, lived in ancient Greece and has an autographed manuscript of Oedipus Rex from Sophocles and another of the Bible dedicated by Matthew (P: 146,175). He apparently controls the time of day by adding gunshots to the chimes of his clocks (P: 144, 150). And the stumbling block at the divorce proceedings is the Baron's signature with his newly discovered date, May 32 (P: 163). Against the background of the screening parallels, divergences from the original story act instead as markers, alerting the reader to the possibility that Gorin's work has an Aesopian reading. Perhaps Gorin's fascination with time serves to relativize the category of chronology, thus in a sense annulling the shift in time in the setting. Abuladze uses a similar device in the movie Repentance. The court scene is attended by knights in armor and judges in medieval robes, but the defendant and plaintiffs are in modern dress, and one of the judges plays with a Rubik's Cube: The setting is thus everywhere and nowhere (or rather at all times and at no time). But the audience is not allowed to relegate the action comfortably to a time fixed and closed off from the present. Other markers in Gorin's Munchausen function to direct attention not only away from the overt referent of the text, but to a specifically Russian context. When the Baron invites Jakobina, Ramkopf, and the Burgomaster to announce his decision to come back to life, he introduces his announcement with the following phrase: \"Itak, gospoda, ja priglasil vas, chtoby soobshchit' preneprijatnoe izvestie\" (So, gentlemen, I have invited you in order to inform you of a most unpleasant bit of news), and himself\n\nA Russian Munchausen: Aesopian translation\n\n25\n\ncomments that it would be an excellent phrase to begin a play (F, P: 181). In fact it is the Mayor's opening line in Gogol's Inspector General.12 The quotation is doubly humorous, since the hero of Gogol's play, Xlestakov, is himself an inveterate plagiarist, ascribing to his own authorship operas (The Marriage of Figaro, Robert Je Diable, Norma), the works of \"Baron Brambeus\" (O. I. Senkovskij), Zagoskin's Jurij MiJosJavskij, and even entire journals like Moskovskij telegraf.13 There are at least four allusions to Bulgakov's Master and Margarita. In the film, when the Baron renounces his exploits we see him in his office burning his manuscripts, a scene strongly reminiscent of the Master burning his novel in Bulgakov's work (and indirectly of Gogol's destruction of his work, 563). Here too it turns out that \"manuscripts do not burn,\"14 since the complete works of the Baron are published after his \"death\" (P: 172,182). When the Burgomaster refuses to call him Miller, Munchausen suggests that he add pokojnyj or usopshij (late) to his name (P: 179); in Bulgakov, Ivan Bezdomny puzzles over wording his statement about coming \"to Patriarch's Ponds with the late (pokojnyj) Misha Berlioz yesterday evening.\"15 When the Baron is about to repeat his flight to the moon, the sergeant-major expresses his concern that the moon is invisible because of the clouds. Tomas responds that any fool can make it when it's visible, the Baron likes things to be more difficult (P: 192). This response is very close to Korov'ev's remark to Margarita about Azazello hitting a hidden card.16 Finally, in the play, but not in the film, the Baron and Marta make their exit along a moonbeam road (P: 196) just as Pilat, the Master, and Margarita do in Bulgakov's novel.17 Quotations from Russian writers like Gogol act as markers to direct the reader's attention to Russia, and allusions to Bulgakov's work about Stalinist Moscow direct their attention to Russia in the Soviet period. What other devices act as markers or can be interpreted as veiled allusions to Soviet reality? Some markers work on the level of the lexicon, in the area of what the Russians are now calling \"Jingvostranovedenie.\" When he determines to renounce his exploits, Munchausen says that Baron Munchausen will cease to exist in five minutes, \"mozhete pochtit' ego pamjat' vstavaniem\" (P: 170) \"You may honor his memory by standing.\" Rising for a minute of silence to respect the memory of the dead is recognizable as a Soviet ritual, and the very expression used to refer to it is ritually fixed in the language. Loseff discusses such stylistic markers as they are used by Shvarts in The Dragon: \"in the context of a 'Grimm Brothers' tale a specifically Russian turn of phrase, a typically Soviet word, expression, plot situation, or a term linked to the mind-set of the twentieth century will be perceived as a linguistic or cultural malapropism, as a shift into another style.\"18 Later the Baroness refers to the Baron's \"svetlaja pamjat' i vseobshchaja ljubov' sograzhdan\" (P: 174) \"shining memory and the general\n\nThe long view: Soviet satire in context\n\n26\n\nlove of his fellow-citizens\" - another Soviet cliche. Such shifts in style to Sovietisms function as markers, directing the audience to place the entire work in a Soviet context. Other markers allude to situations that the audience should recognize as Soviet. When the pastor arrives at Munchausen's castle in the first scene, he attempts to ring the bell and the pull comes off in his hand. Shoddiness of material goods is associated by Russians not with Germany, but rather with their own country. That the episode is meant as a marker is substantiated by Tomas's reaction: he comes out, chides the miscreant pastor in a kind of peasant patter, replaces the pull, and goes back in, telling the visitor to try again more lightly. Perhaps it is not the case that the Soviet Union is the only place where one is regularly reprimanded by strangers, especially by those who guard doors, but the Soviet viewer would surely view this scene as one familiar from his or her own experience. These ubiquitous door guards make the experience of simply entering any Soviet building something one undertakes with anxiety. Yet another scene in the film involves the problem of entrance, this time to a theatrical performance: RAMKOPF.\n\nGospoda, gospoda, povtorjaju: zakrytyj sudebnyj eksperiment. Vxod\n\ntol'ko po speciarnomu razresheniju. TOMAS. Gospodin Ramkopf! RAMKOPF. Net, net, net, nichego segodnja delat' ne mogu. V sledujushchij raz: nichego segodnja delat' ne mogu. RAMKOPF. Ladies and gentlemen, I repeat: it's a closed judicial experiment. Entry only by special permission. TOMAS. Mr. Ramkopf! RAMKOPF. NO, no, no,\n\nanything for you today.\n\nI can't do anything for you today. Next time. I can't do\n\nAgain, anyone who has attempted to go to a theater the day of a performance in the Soviet Union recognizes the scene. Anything worth seeing is invariably sold out, and those responsible are adamant that they can \"do nothing\" about it. Tipped off by these markers, the audience begins to look more closely at the whole plot as a potential Aesopian comment on Soviet life. In spite of the screening quotations from the original, this Munchausen turns out to be substantially new. Gorin emphasizes the conflict between Munchausen, the private citizen who wants to marry his beloved Marta, and the authorities, who refuse to divorce him from his wife. Munchausen always tells the truth, as he repeats again and again, while the authorities force him to subscribe to lies. The original Adventures of Baron Munchausen are narrated for the most part in first person by the Baron himself. True, he does present the stories as authentic: \"It is not to be wondered at that readers and listeners\n\nA Russian Munchausen: Aesopian translation\n\n27\n\nshould be at times disposed to incredulity. But if, in the company that I have the honour of addressing, any one should be tempted to doubt the truth of the statements I make, I should be deeply pained by this want of confidence\" (E: 78). The keeper of the museum at Amsterdam \"tells my story to all strangers . . . he adds to it several details of his own invention, which do grievous harm to the truth and authenticity of the narrative\" (E: 92). And in one of the later sections, where the narrative is in third person: \"Now gentlemen, you know Baron Munchausen thoroughly, and I hope you can have no further doubts about his truthfulness\" (E: 138). No matter how much the Baron protests his veracity, however, the reader is still at liberty to doubt the Baron's fantastic adventures. Not so in the film. The film opens at a campfire as the Baron tells his story of pulling himself out of the swamp by his pigtail to a small group of skeptical hunters. When he recounts the episode of the deer with the cherry tree between its antlers, one of the others says, Derevo? Skazhite luchshe vishnevyj sad! MJUNXGAUZEN. Esli by vyros sad, ja by skazal sad, a poskol'ku vyroslo derevo, zachem zhe mne vrat'? Ja vsegda govorju tol'ko pravdu. OXOTNIK. Pravdu? (vse smejutsja) A tree? You may as well say a cherry orchard! MUNCHAUSEN. If an orchard had grown up, I would have said orchard, but since it was a tree, why should I lie? I always tell the truth and only the truth. HUNTER. The truth? (all laugh)\n\nAt this point, the deer appears in the woods nearby with a small cherry tree growing between his antlers. This episode, which comes as a prologue before the titles, sets up the audience for the fantasy world of the film, a world in which the incredible adventures of the Baron must be taken as authentic, which means that anyone who impugns their veracity is wrong. Further episodes, such as the duck shot through the chimney that falls fully cooked and sauced into a platter and flies away when thrown out the window, confirm for the audience the Baron's claim that he always tells the truth. The medium of film allows Gorin and Zakharov to show the split between words and reality directly. Only occasionally are the Baron's words at odds with the reality we see on the screen, such as when he declares night during broad daylight. Most of the time the Baron's claims, fantastic as they may be, are substantiated, while those of his enemies are shown to be false. The turning point in the plot of the first part comes when the Baron is prevailed upon to lie: MJUNXGAUZEN. NO ja zhe skazal pravdu! BURGOMISTR. Da chert s nej, s pravdoj, inogda nuzhno i sovrat', ponimaj eto, sovrat'. Gospodi! Takie elementarnye veshchi mne prixoditsja ob\"jasnjat' baronu Mjunxgauzenu! (P: 168)\n\nThe long view: Soviet satire in context\n\n28\n\nMUNCHAUSEN. But I told the truth! BURGOMASTER. TO hell with the truth,\n\nsometimes you have to lie, get it, to lie. God, to imagine I have to explain such simple things to Baron Munchausen!\n\nHe agrees that the date is not May 32, but June 1. In the film, he is made to stand like a schoolboy in front of the Duke to repent and recant his discovery. When the Baron is asked what day it is, the Burgomaster holds up one finger. 'The first of June.\" \"Louder, please, for all,\" prompts the Duke. He repeats his statement. The Duke (the Burgomaster in the play, 169) consoles Munchausen that \"even Galileo recanted,\" to which he replies, \"That's why I always preferred Bruno.\" The weight of this comparison establishes the potential seriousness of the Baron's denial, and broadening the historical reference again raises the possibility that an eternal pattern is intended, one applicable even in the present. The pastor agrees to marry the Baron and Marta only if he renounces all his adventures as well. The Burgomaster suggests that in secret he can continue to believe, but the Baron objects, \"Ja ne umeju vtajne. Ja mogu toFko otkryto\" (film only). \"I can't do it in secret, I can only be open.\" The split implied is not only between the individual and society or authority, which forces him to conform, but also within the individual himself if he betrays his individuality by giving in to pressure. Part II contains even more allusions to situations recognizably Soviet. According to the stage directions in the play, three years have passed (P: 171). The Baron has become a legend and a national hero. His castle is a museum, through which tourists from abroad are led, a statue of the horse cut in two by the portcullis is to be set up, Jakobina has published the complete edition of his adventures (P: 171-2). Even the Baron's new date, the May 32, is to be used at the trial (P: 193). What has happened? With the Baron safely dead, the state has found it useful to take advantage of his adventures for its own glorification. But this is safe only so long as the Baron is dead, which is why the authorities do everything they can to prevent him from returning to life. This situation is familiar to Soviet audiences from such figures as Pasternak, Nabokov, and Tarkovsky. Pasternak was several times officially chided and finally expelled from the Soviet Writers' Union in 1958 for the scandal over Doctor Zhivago. His relatives were evicted from the Peredelkino dacha in 1984. In early 1987, the 1958 expulsion was rescinded, and plans were announced to set up a Pasternak museum in the dacha and to publish Doctor Zhivago in 1988.19 Nabokov too, who was persona non grata as an emigre while he lived, can now be discussed and printed in Russia. Tarkovsky, whose films were never widely distributed or highly praised in the official press, was nearly forgotten after he failed to return from the West. But no sooner did he die than an obituary was published 20 and the authorities promised a retrospective of his films and even showings of the two films he made abroad.21 But none of the works\n\nA Russian Munchausen: Aesopian translation\n\n29\n\nof living emigres were shown or published in their homeland until the late 1980s. When he attempts to come back to life, the Baron is arrested and tried as a pretender. Though the defendant seems to have acquired the Baron's gait, voice, and even his fingerprints, Ramkopf presents the following \"facts\" as proof that the Baron's claims are false: \"the notice of the Baron's death, an extract from a church book, the receipt for the coffin\" (P: 185). As I have argued elsewhere, it is characteristic of Soviet culture to take the document (the sign) as the primary test of truth. 22 While reality is taken as primary in the West, it is the word that is hierarchically more significant in the East. This is why Bulgakov can write \"Raz net dokumenta, netu i cheloveka (\"No document, no person!\").23 The reverse also holds true - a document is even better than the reality it describes (the sign is more important than its referent or, as Lotman and Uspensky would have it, the expression is more important than the content24). Shvarts takes similar humorous advantage of the Soviet fascination with the document in The Dragon. Instead of a spear, the Burgomaster hands Lancelot a piece of paper: Eto udostoverenie daetsja vam v torn, chto kop'e dejstvitel'no naxoditsja v remonte, chto podpis'ju i prilozheniem pechati udostoverjaetsja. Vy pred\"javite ego vo vremja boja gospodinu drakonu, i vse konchitsja otlichno.25 This certificate attests that the spear is really being repaired, which is certified by the signature and the seal affixed. Present it during the battle to Lord Dragon and everything will end splendidly.\n\nThe importance of the document is brought out again at the end of Munchausen, when the Baron is declared to have completed a trip to the moon: RAMKOPF. Pozdravljaju vas, baron! MJUNXGAUZEN. S chem? RAMKOPF. S uspeshnym vozvrashcheniem s limy. MJUNXGAUZEN. Ja ne byl na lune. RAMKOPF. Kak eto - ne byl, kogda est' reshenie, chto\n\nbyl? (P: 195)\n\nRAMKOPF. Congratulations Baron! MUNCHAUSEN. For what? RAMKOPF. On your successful return from the moon. MUNCHAUSEN. I wasn't on the moon. RAMKOPF. What do you mean, you weren't there, when\n\nyou were?\n\nthere is a decision that\n\nSo long as there is a written document to that effect, whether or not the journey actually took place is immaterial. At the trial, no one is allowed to recognize the Baron as himself: He is now the gardener Miiller (Miller in the play). That this situation is unnatural is shown even by the reaction of those commanded to arrest the Baron:\n\nThe long view: Soviet satire in context\n\n30\n\nFEL'DFEBEL'. Gospodi, da ved' eto . . . BURGOMISTR. KtO?! FEL'DFEBEL'. Da v e d ' eto\n\n...\n\nBURGOMISTR. KtO?! FEL'DFEBEL'. N e m o g u znat'! (P: 184) SERGEANT-MAJOR. M y god, but it's . . .\n\nBURGOMASTER. W h o ? SERGEANT-MAJOR. But it's . . .\n\nBURGOMASTER. W h o ?\n\nSERGEANT-MAJOR. I have n o idea!\n\nThe split between the official version and reality is felt most strongly by the Burgomaster, who is the Baron's friend, and who therefore tries not to testify that he is not himself: BURGOMISTR. Gospodin sud'ja, ja staryj chelovek. Izbav'te menja ot etoj muki. . . U menja slabye glaza i sovershenno nenadezhnaja pamjat'. Ja mogu oshibit'sja . . . SUD'JA. NO vy uznaete v podsudimom barona ili net? BURGOMISTR. Ne znaju . . . Chestnoe slovo . . . Inogda mne kazhetsja, chto eto on, inogda - net. . . Mogu li ja polagat'sja na svoi lichnye oshchushchenija v takom vazhnom dele? . . . Polnost'ju doverjaju sudu. Kak reshite, tak i budet! (P: 188) BURGOMASTER. Your honor, I am an old man. Relieve me of this torment. . . I have weak eyes and a completely unreliable memory. I may make a mistake . . . JUDGE. But do you recognize the defendant as the Baron or not? BURGOMASTER. I don't know . . . Honestly . . . Sometimes it seems to me that it is him, sometimes not. . . Can I rely on my personal feelings in such an important case? . . . I trust the court completely. As you decide, so be it!\n\nThe language itself breaks down when Marta says she will tell the truth, that the Baron is himself: MARTA. Ja skazhu pravdu! RAMKOPF. Togda my i vas privlechem k otvetstvennosti kak lzhesvidetelja! BARONESSA. Uspokojsja, Genrix! Esli chelovek xochet skazat' pravdu, on imeet na eto pravo. Mne by tol'ko xotelos' znat', kakuju pravdu vy imeete v vidu? MARTA. Pravda odna. BARONESSA. Pravdy voobshche ne byvaet. Pravda - eto to, chto v dannyj moment schitaetsja pravdoj. (P: 189) MARTA. I will tell the truth! RAMKOPF. Then we will bring you to trial for perjury [literally as a false witness]! BARONESS. Calm down, Henrich! If a person wants to tell the truth, he has the right to. But I would just like to know what truth you have in mind? MARTA. There is one truth. BARONESS. There is no truth at all. Truth is what is considered truth at the moment.\n\nA Russian Munchausen: Aesopian translation\n\n31\n\nA society which promotes such statements is surely morally bankrupt by most standards. The final scene in the film is depicted as a show trial, with the accent on the show. As the scene opens, the orchestra is tuning up. BURGOMISTR. Vse pojdet po planu: posle uvertjury, doprosy. Potom poslednee slovo podsudimogo, zalpy, obshchee vesel'e, tancy. RAMKOPF. Frau Marta, proshu vas, tochno po tekstu! BURGOMASTER. Everything follows the plan: after the overture comes the interrogation. Then the defendant's last words, a salute, general merriment, dancing. RAMKOPF. Frau Marta, please, follow the text exactly!\n\nNot only is there a text to follow and an orchestra to accompany the proceedings, but there remain in the film some hints that Marta has been drugged to induce her to comply with the plan. All these details are meant to direct the audience to the show trials of the 1930s in the Soviet Union. So far we have dealt with general allusions to Soviet reality. There is also one character in the film who may be intended as a parody of a specific person. The character of the Duke appears only in the film, not in the play, and it stands to reason that the ruler of a world that covertly represents the Soviet Union should covertly represent its leader at the time Brezhnev. The film portrays the Duke as inept and disinterested in politics. He is more concerned with fashion: Indeed, he seems to be an amateur dressmaker. He describes all state problems in terms of what one should wear and judges people by their clothes. When he learns of the possible war with England, he goes to the globe and asks, \"Where is it, where, I ask you.\" \"Here.\" \"And where are we?\" \"We are here.\" He then takes his tape measure to the globe and declares, \"But it's so close!\" The Duke in the film is both protected and controlled by those around him. When we are introduced to the Duke, his steward attempts to prevent entry to his rooms while he is indulging in his hobby: Ego vysochestvo zanjat vazhnejshimi gosudarstvennymi delami. On provodit ekstrennoe soveshchanie. Ego voobshche tarn net. His highness is busy with state affairs of the utmost importance. He is holding an emergency meeting. He's not there at all. In fact, he is there, in his office, which doubles as a dressmaking salon. The Burgomaster acts both as prompter and as translator for the inarticulate and inept Duke. Jakobina arrives to ask about the divorce decree: JAKOBINA. Vy podpisali proshenie barona GERCOG. Kto podpisal? Ja podpisal?\n\nMjunxgauzena o razvode?\n\n(Burgomistr kivaet)\n\nGERCOG. Da, ja podpisal. JAKOBINA. Znachit, on mozhet\n\nzhenit'sja na Marte?\n\nThe long view: Soviet satire in context\n\n32\n\nPochemu zhenit'sja? (Burgomistr kivaet) GERCOG. Da, on mozhet zhenit'sja. GERCOG.\n\nJAKOBINA. Did you DUKE. Who signed\n\n(Burgomaster nods)\n\nsign Baron Munchausen's request for a divorce? it? Did I sign it?\n\nDUKE. Yes, I signed it. JAKOBINA. SO\n\nhe can marry Marta?\n\nDUKE. Why marry?\n\n(Burgomaster nods) DUKE. Yes, he can marry.\n\nThe Burgomaster's role as front man and interpreter for the Duke is even clearer in the last scene, where the Duke's inarticulate mutterings are translated into legalese: GERCOG. NU vot chto: navernoe my tut vse byli v chem-to nepravy BURGOMISTR. Gospoda! Resheniem gannoverskogo suda, v svjazi s\n\n.. . uspeshnym\n\nzaversheniem eksperimenta . . . GERCOG. Raz chto tak vse slozhilos', tak pust' vse idet, kak idet. BURGOMISTR. Prikazano, vysochajshim poveleniem prikazano schitat' podsudimogo baronom Mjunxgauzenom. DUKE. Well here, then: probably we've all been somehow wrong . . . BURGOMASTER. Ladies and gentlemen! By decision of the court of Hannover,\n\nin connection with the successful completion of the experiment. . . DUKE. SO long as it's turned out that way, let things go as they're going. BURGOMASTER. YOU are commanded, commanded by the highest junction to consider the defendant Baron Munchausen.\n\nThis satire is biting enough if we can safely deduce that the ruler of a state that represents the Soviet Union in Aesopian translation represents Brezhnev. But is there any evidence for such a satiric version? Most of the anecdotes about Brezhnev in his last years dealt with his senility. He and other politburo members were portrayed playing with toy soldiers or putting on mismatched socks, then sending each other home only to find that \"the pair there doesn't match either.\" But the most consistent theme of the Brezhnev anecdotes was prompting: The invariant motif was that Brezhnev could do nothing without a text. One anecdote has him addressing a foreign visitor: \"Dear Indira Gandhi!\" \"Comrade Brezhnev, it's Margaret Thatcher!\" \"Dear Indira Gandhi!\" \"Comrade Brezhnev, it's Margaret Thatcher!\" \"Dear Indira Gandhi!\" \"Comrade Brezhnev, it's Margaret Thatcher!\" \"I know it's Margaret Thatcher, but here it says 'Dear Indira Gandhi!' \"\n\nA Russian Munchausen: Aesopian translation\n\n33\n\nIt was joked that, at the opening of the Moscow Olympics, he five times reads \"O\" followed by stormy and lengthy applause. By the head gestures of the joke teller, the listener understands that he is reading the logo of the Olympics at the top of the page. In another anecdote, Suslov comes to the door three times and knocks. Each time Brezhnev gets up, puts on his glasses, and reads from a piece of paper \"Who's there?\" Suslov does not answer because he \"forgot his glasses at home\" or \"forgot his note.\" All these anecdotes show a leader who is not in control, who relies on texts provided by others - precisely the image presented by the Duke in Gorin's Munchausen. There are no other specific details that refer to Brezhnev's anecdotal quirks: his eyebrows, his accent, his medals, his aspirations as a writer. But Zakharov may be taking advantage of his visual medium in casting Leonid Bronevoj as the count. Bronevoj's demeanor and expression of combined weltschmerz and indifference (or is it stupidity?) do seem to recall Brezhnev. In general, censorship varied in the Soviet Union according to the medium and the size of the audience. Among the dramatic media, theater was the freest, since it reached the smallest audience. Theatrical performances could also change from night to night, which made them harder to control: once a play was approved for production, subtle changes could still be introduced. It was because of this freedom that Ljubimov's productions at the Taganka Theater became so popular. But on a national scale, only the elite few ever saw a Taganka production. Not so film and television, both of which potentially reached millions of viewers. The Soviet State early on recognized the importance of film as a propaganda tool, and film became, alongside the socialist realist novel, the dominant genre in Soviet culture. With the advent of television, the new medium was enlisted in the struggle to engineer human souls. Television is potentially even more influential, and therefore more dangerous than film. A film could be tested in front of small audiences, then given closed runs, with the number of copies controlling the size of the audience. It could always be pulled from distribution if it was perceived as dangerous. A television program, however, reaches millions of viewers at once. This explains the notoriously tight security at Gosteleradio and the general lack (until late perestroika) of live broadcasts. The changes in Soviet television introduced by Gorbachev's glasnost campaign show only how important the medium was in Soviet propaganda. But Gorin's Munchausen was written, produced, and shown in the days before gJasnost. Perhaps this is why it enjoyed such popularity: At the time, it must have shown daring contrast to the usual television fare. For those who are able to translate the Aesopian language of Gorin's Munchausen, the story undergoes a remarkable transformation in crossing the border from England and Germany to the Soviet Union and from\n\nThe long view: Soviet satire in context\n\n34\n\nfantastic tale to drama on stage and film. In the imaginary world of the film, the fantastic adventures of the Baron become reality. In the original adventures, the Baron's claims of authenticity are taken of a piece with the adventures themselves as fictional, while in the film they are shown to be true. The result is a reversal of the hierarchy of truth and fiction, in which those who question the Baron's veracity and urge him to recant his adventures appear not as spokesmen for reason, but as dictators who enforce conformity even when it means ignoring the truth. It is the authorities and Munchausen's opponents who, in the film, place more store in the power of language (the document) than in the reality they see before their eyes. As they cannot recognize the Baron, they cannot recognize the truth unless it is asserted in a document. Ironically, it is precisely this importance of the document in Soviet culture that leads to the role of censorship, which requires the author to translate his story about truth and fiction into Aesopian language. Munchausen says he cannot do it \"in secret\"; his author, however, is forced to do exactly that: But Aesopian language allows him to reveal his message to the initiates. Notes 1.

It's difficult to make a Soviet comedy because we don't know what to laugh at. Osip Brik1\n\nEarly Soviet cinema had many triumphs, but few comedies are typically counted among them.2 My purpose here is not, however, to recite a litany of failures, but rather to look at the few successes and to explore the reasons why the genre faced such formidable obstacles.3 While comedy was by no means the only troubled genre in Soviet silent cinema, an examination of the evolution of comedy has exceptional potential to illuminate issues important in understanding the transformation of Soviet society in the 1920s: the cultural and political elites' disdain of mass opinion, their puritanical bias against entertainment, and the incipient authoritarianism implicit in their efforts to turn a cinematic culture into a political culture.4 These tendencies, moreover, were quite apparent before the Cultural Revolution of 1928-32. By 1927, as Brik's words indicate, the USSR was a society where even humor had to be \"managed.\" Before turning to a discussion of the scientific problems of film satire and comedy during the 1920s, we need to keep certain aspects of the cinematic context in mind. Although cinema had been nationalized in 1919 and placed under the control of the Commissariat of Enlightenment (Narkompros), this control was actually nominal for most of the decade due to deep divisions within the commissariat about the function of cinema in a Socialist society. Narkompros's head, Anatoly Lunacharsky, was a cultural pluralist actively involved in cinema affairs and a vigorous proponent of entertainment films in deeds, if not always in words.5 The state film trust, called Sovkino from 1925 to 1929, was dominated by likeminded individuals, and Sovkino pursued a policy of financing bigbudget entertainment films and importing foreign, especially American, films in substantial quantities. The existence of the Mezhrabpom studio 36\n\n\"We don't know what to laugh at\"\n\n37\n\nheavily capitalized, quasi-independent, and famed for its success at the box office - further complicated an already complex situation.6 But although money and power lay behind the entertainment film, there were formidable forces arrayed against it. Narkompros's Main Committee on Political Education (Glavpolitprosvet) led the opposition, Lunacharsky's views notwithstanding. Young directors also tended to oppose entertainment films as \"bourgeois,\" promoting their own work by way of contrast as somehow truly \"revolutionary.\"7 The press was controlled by critics who likewise believed that Soviet cinema had to distinguish itself from its commercial counterparts in the West. A few critics supported the efforts of avant-garde artists, interpreting cinema's \"social charge\" (sotsialnyi zakaz) as that of evaluating the masses, weaning them away from their unfortunate affinity for the decadent bourgeoistaste culture. 8 More often, however, critics believed that cinema needed to educate the audience in a more traditional fashion (even if indirectly), so films needed to be socially significant - or at the very least, not \"bourgeois.\"9 Given this climate of opinion, it should not be surprising that most established cinematic genres presented daunting challenges to Soviet filmmakers throughout the first decade of Soviet movie production. Genre films were, after all, profoundly \"bourgeois\" products of commercial filmmaking - that is, there was nothing intrinsically Marxist or Soviet about them. Many 1920s Soviet filmmakers and critics who pondered this \"problem\" doubted that a truly Soviet cinema could be created merely by pouring new content into old forms. To make matters worse as far as the culture patrol dominating key positions in Glavpolitprosvet and the press was concerned, the mass audience exhibited marked preference for the \"basest\" of the bourgeois genres - melodrama, adventure, slapstick comedy.10 Clearly, much painful reeducation lay ahead for filmgoers, and for filmmakers of the old school. Yet for the time being, the \"old specialists\" who dominated popular cinema chose, consciously or unconsciously, to ignore these debates about art and enlightenment. Instead, they went briskly about their business, effortlessly turning out an array of \"pseudo-Soviet genre films, focusing on comedy, melodrama, adventure, and historical (costume) drama.11 Some of these genres were easier to \"Sovietize\" than others. Soviet popular directors found it reasonably easy to Sovietize adventure by making civil war movies that emphasized adventure over politics.12 Others, albeit mainly those with prerevolutionary filmmaking experience, also did a credible job Sovietizing the historical film by selecting incidents from the nineteenth-century revolutionary movements for dramatization.13 That these were indeed popular with audiences can be demonstrated through audience studies and by looking at import figures.14\n\nThe long view: Soviet satire in context\n\n38\n\nComedy and melodrama were a rather different matter, proving much more difficult to Sovietize. Although melodramatic elements could be infused into other genres, the constraints of cultural politics (specifically, disdain for films that depicted the joys and sorrows of private life) meant that the pure melodrama was rare indeed in Soviet cinema.15 Most critics considered melodrama a shockingly bourgeois product directed at foreigners, NEP men, bourgeois specialists (spetsy), and unreconstructed elements of the petty bourgeoisie (meshchane). But the import figures tell us that audiences - workers included - responded quite warmly to such films.16 Yet despite the serious problems facing those who produced melodramas, there can be no doubt that comedy was the perennial sore spot of Soviet silent cinema. More was written about it than about any other genre, and though critics were constantly declaring comedy the most important genre of the most important art, they just as constantly carped about the results.17 Relatively few major directors (notable exceptions being Iakov Protazanov and Boris Barnet) were willing to risk being abused more than once for making the \"wrong\" kind of comedy.18 Why were comedies as a genre more heavily criticized and more difficult to make than melodramas? The answer is not immediately obvious. As was the case with melodrama, divergence between mass and elite opinion on film comedy was marked; comedies were extremely popular among audiences, especially among young people and children. As was also true of melodrama, imported comedies constitute a significant percentage of films on the screen. Taken separately, neither factor seems especially noteworthy, but in combination, the source of the \"problem\" becomes more obvious. In the 1920s, the Soviet cinema community feared the influence and competition of foreign films, a phenomenon that was dubbed the \"inostranshchina\" (from the Russian word for \"foreign\").19 This phobia was not undifferentiated: Greatest of all was the fear of American influence, the amerikanshchina (or \"Americanitis,\" to borrow Ronald Levaco's witty translation of the pejorative).20 Since there were few \"good\" Soviet comedies, to the dismay of critics and filmmakers alike, American comedies (Hollywood's most formidable product on the international market) were firmly entrenched. From 1921-28, 43% percent of American imports were comedies; more importantly, the 324 American comedies imported were more than three times the number of Soviet comedies produced in the same period.21 These are staggering figures, especially when one considers that the audience supposedly being Americanized was the youth audience. But this is only part of the explanation. Soviet filmmakers, young and old alike, were fairly confident of their talents, and I suspect they would have been less reluctant to take on American comedies if only they had\n\n\"We don't know what to laugh at\"\n\n39\n\nknown what they could safely laugh at, to paraphrase Brik. In the beginning, it seemed fairly easy. Early attempts at comedy like The Miracle Worker (Chudotvorets, Aleksandr Panteleev, 1922) and Commander Ivanov (Kombrig Ivanov, Aleksandr Razumnyi, 1922) satirized religion, a subject that even apolitical \"old specialists\" could be sure was acceptable to the new regime. The humor in The Miracle Worker, a tale of a charlatan priest unmasked by cunning peasants, is crude and physical, but the film earned its place in Soviet film history as \"Lenin's favorite.\" Commander Ivanov was more daring, a sly little romantic comedy about a Red Army officer who breaks down the \"bourgeois morality\" of a priest's daughter to get her to \"register\" with him without a religious ceremony.22 But how many variations on this theme could there be? White Guardists and foreigners were other potentially interesting subjects for satire, because they seemed to offer safety and scope at the same time. It had nonetheless been clear to directors since The Extraordinary Adventures of Mr. West in the Land of the Bolsheviks (Neobychainye prikliucheniia mistera Vesta v strane bolshevikov, Lev Kuleshov, 1924) that foreign themes could be just as \"dangerous\" as foreign films. Even though Kuleshov's depiction of the naive fears of the ridiculous Mr. West and the belligerent posturing of his swaggering bodyguard, Cowboy Jeddy, seemed perfectly in keeping with the stereotypical view of Americans as self-centered and ignorant, Mr. West was poorly received by critics (though not by viewers).23 While a number of other comedies employed American or foreign characters for human interest, the only two major comedies based on foreign themes were The Case of the Three Million (Protsess o trekh millionakh, Iakov Protazanov, 1926) and Mr. Lloyd's Voyage (Reis mistera Lloida, Mikhail Verner, 1927). Both films were actually set abroad - The Case concerns a debonair Italian thief and a corrupt banker; Mr. Lloyd, a White Guardist conspiracy on a luxury liner. They both were heavily criticized as \"bourgeois,\" the latter being quite literally anathemized when it appeared.24 By middecade, it was obvious even to the most reluctant of Soviet citizens that the "
