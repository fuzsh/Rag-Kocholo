        "text": "Geomagnetic activity with global influence is an essential object of space weather research and is a significant link in the section of the solar wind-magnetospheric coupling process. Research so far provides strong evidence that geomagnetic activity affects stock investment decisions by influencing human health, mood, and human behaviours. Therefore, this research investigates the empirical association between geomagnetic activity and stock market return. Overall, we find that geomagnetic activity exerts a negative influence on the return of the US stock market. Further, market liquidity effectively magnifies the effect of geomagnetic activity. Inconsistent with previous literature, this effect is not mainly caused by the semiannual variation of geomagnetic activity. Our research contributes to the introduction of geomagnetic indices to financial economics studies on the impact of geomagnetic activity influence on stock market return.\n\nExplaining movements in daily stock prices is one of the most difficult tasks in modern finance. This paper contributes to the existing literature by documenting the impact of geomagnetic storms on daily stock market returns. A large body of psychological research has shown that geomagnetic storms have a profound effect on people's moods, and, in turn, people's moods have been found to be related to human behavior, judgments and decisions about risk. An important finding of this literature is that people often attribute their feelings and emotions to the wrong source, leading to incorrect judgments. Specifically, people affected by geomagnetic storms may be more inclined to sell stocks on stormy days because they incorrectly attribute their bad mood to negative economic prospects rather than bad environmental conditions. Misattribution of mood and pessimistic choices can translate into a relatively higher demand for riskless assets, causing the price of risky assets to fall or to rise less quickly than otherwise. The authors find strong empirical support in favor of a geomagnetic-storm effect in stock returns after controlling for market seasonals and other environmental and behavioral factors. Unusually high levels of geomagnetic activity have a negative, statistically and economically significant effect on the following week's stock returns for all U.S. stock market indices. Finally, this paper provides evidence of substantially higher returns around the world during periods of quiet geomagnetic activity.\n\nCharacterizing signal dynamics with network approaches have attracted significant attention in nonlinear time series analysis. Among these approaches, ordinal networks have received great interest for their simplicity and computational efficiency. But most studies mainly use the topological structure of ordinal network to characterize time series while the underlying information in the transition probabilities remain insufficiently concerned. In this paper, the authors introduce an ordinal network-based complexity-entropy curve to fill this gap. The numerical results show that this curve has a great discriminating power for signals with different dynamics, outperforming the recently proposed global node entropy. In the empirical application on stock indices, these curves distinguish stock market with different market development and further identify the impact of the 2008 global financial crisis on stock market dynamics. In the analysis of geomagnetic activity, these curves detect the dynamical change in Earths magnetic field caused by the geomagnetic storm."
