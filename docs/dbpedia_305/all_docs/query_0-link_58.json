Reinventing Humor and Satire in Post-Soviet Russia. Research on this book profited immensely from a 2008 National Endowment for the Humanities-funded summer institute at the New York Public Library’s Slavic and East European Collection, whose director, Edward Kasinec, proved a model of professionalism and collegiality. I would also like to thank an anonymous collector of Russian caricature and poster art in Prague for the chance to examine his materials in summer 2007. Irina Paperno at the University of California, Berkeley, got the first look in 1997 at what would become this project; without her support it may have gone no further. Others who contributed to my professional and personal development at Berkeley, the University of Texas at Austin, and the Moscow Tribune include Charles Ramírez-Berg, Robert Twombly, Anthony Vanchu, Frances Masiello, Eric Naiman, Linda Williams, Alexei Yurchak, Tomohiro Machiyama, and Anthony Luis. Of the University of Pittsburgh contingent, Volodya Padunov, Nancy Condee, and Helena Goscilo all pushed me along, in ways they may not have realized. Natasha Perova of Glas is my oldest and most-valued Moscow friend. My comics studies fellow travelers at the International Comic Arts Forum were the first to hear me try out much of this material; it has been greatly improved by their comments. Among these stalwarts, I single out Rusty Witek, Marc Singer, Charles Hatfield, Gene Kannenberg, Héctor Fernández-l’Hoeste, and Ana Merino. I bow my head low before the god-like John Lent. In Russia, I found a wonderful group of komiks artists, scholars, and supporters, without whom this project simply would not exist. Of special mention: Mikhail Sidlin, Zhora Litichevsky, Gosha Ostretsov, IX\n\nX\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nIlya Kitup, Andrei Ayoshin, Sergei Repyov, Dmitry Yakovlev, Khikhus, and all the staff at the KomMissia comics festival. No one helped me more than the great Misha Zaslavsky. For unflagging support and loyalty, though, none can compare to the illustrious Galya Diment. Indeed, all my colleagues at the University of Washington Department of Slavic Languages and Literatures have helped create an ideal environment for my work; none is more tireless than Shosh Westen. In particular I want to thank Bojan Belic and Katarzyna Dziwirek for their assistance with Serbian and Polish materials, respectively. Douglas Machle of Classics also helped with his Dutch skills. Seth Graham, time and again, has shown himself a great inspiration, consigliere, friend, and professional lodestar. Everything good in this book is owing to their influence; everything bad flows exclusively from me. In this book I have used the United States Library of Congress transliteration system for the Russian language, except in cases where familiar names (Tolstoy, Dostoyevsky) might be rendered unfamiliar, and for readability (Litichevsky rather than Litichevskii). In the bibliography, I have adhered to the LOC system.

Billed as a modern revival of the sixteenth-century tradition of illustrated miniatures produced by the Russian Orthodox Church, the show brought together thirteen artists’ visions of the Book of Revelations. The works ranged from the humor-laden reinventions of prophecy by Georgy “Zhora” Litichevsky; the weightless, hallucinogenic sojourns of John to the higher realms, limned by Alim Velitov; the fantasy stylings of Askold Akishin; the monumental apparitions of Ilya Savchenkov; the faux naïve buffoonery of Pavel “Khikhus” Sukhikh, among others. The religious theme linked the exhibit to the rising interest in traditional culture among many post-Soviet Russians, but its medium announced it as very much a novelty, something few in the country would have even considered art at all—for Apocalypse Today was among the earliest gallery shows devoted solely to the ongoing renaissance in Russian comic art. 3\n\n4\n\nIntroduction\n\nIt proved a breakthrough: in a country where comics often appear as short pieces or strips in children’s magazines or advertisements, gallery visitors could view these biblically themed sequential narratives (some several pages long) and get a real sense of the medium’s sophistication: its breadth of styles, diversity of designs, word/image meldings—as well as its links to past visual culture practices. After decades in the shadows, Russian comics were making their long-awaited debut. Perhaps. Yet, for all the attention generated by Apocalypse Today (some of the displayed works also appeared in WAM’s celebrated art journal), its origins bore an object lesson for the optimists who saw a new dawn. Yegor Larichev, editor of the journal and initiator of the exhibit, told a reporter that he had intended to produce a film adaption of Revelations, but fell short on funding. As a secondary measure, he turned to comics, which he described as “close to film” (Malpas). Larichev, far from the only Russian cultural figure to see the medium as derivative of other, perhaps “higher” art forms,1 saw Apocalypse Today as a sort of sketch, a stopgap, for his original vision, to give viewers an idea of what the real project (a filmed version) would look like. Such, the reader will discover, have been the fortunes of this medium in the land of the Czars, the Soviets, and the Siloviki.2 The subject of this book, Russian comics, or komiks, belongs to an ancient world tradition of sequential narrative often combining word and image that entered its modern phase simultaneously with the rise of cinema (about 1895), but never enjoyed its popularity or, until recently, its estimation as an art form. In this as in so many other areas of life, the same things happened in Russia as in other parts of the world—only more so. From their origins in the religious icon-making and book-illustration tradition, to the immensely popular lubok or woodblock print of the seventeenth to twentieth centuries, to their vilification and marginalization under the Communists, to their economic struggles and Internet “migration” in the post-Soviet era, komiks have often borne the brunt of ideological change—burning in the summers of relative freedom, freezing in the hard winters of official disdain. As many Russians expressed about their own experiences, komiks never had a “normal life.” The Question of Mass Culture\n\nFor nearly a century the comics medium repeatedly foundered in what Steven Lovell has called “the long and difficult history of modern Russian attempts to grapple with ‘the popular’” (2005: 38). As elaborated in chapter 4, Russia—most acutely under the Soviets—struggled with mass culture (its seduction, its threat)\n\nKomiks Agonistes\n\n5\n\nto the extent that it has never existed as a stable concept.3 Despite the ardent dreams of many, and even as the society altered so radically in the 1990s as to make possible an “enormous infusion of the lowbrow” (Barker: 36), even in the commodity-rich age of the post-Soviet Homo consumptor,4 and—lest it go unremarked—no shortage of native talent, Russian comics still did not thrive. “The situation for comics in Russia is, generally speaking, very strange,” concluded the critic Ivan Kulikov, reviewing the first Russian comics festival in 2002. “In a short time the country has managed to acquire all forms of mass culture. Except comics!” Russian comics artists, to their considerable befuddlement and pique, find themselves mired in a situation not unlike that of their contemporary French peers trying to inject a high art sensibility into BD. As described by Bart Beaty in Unpopular Culture: “Working in a field commonly derided as merely popular, but reaping few of the benefits that accrue to producers of genuinely popular culture, these artists are caught in a double bind” (2008: 15). As mentioned, the same thing happens in Russia—only more so. An analogue to French groups such as l’Association, St. Petersburg’s SPb. Nouvelle Graphiques (SPb.NG, which sees itself very much in the Franco-Belgian tradition) must contend with more than the usual difficulties faced by arts progressives everywhere, such as getting audiences to look beyond entrenched modes of perception and consumption, to possibilities beyond the mainstream. Russia has no mainstream. And as far as both the public and many comics artists themselves are concerned, it has no one-hundred-year, or fifty-year, or even twentyyear store of traditions, nor—thanks to the Soviets—no institutional memory of comics practice beyond occasional children’s short stories. Therefore, SPb.NG, in addition to the ordinary financial hurdles (also worse in Russia), infrastructure issues (until recently much high-quality printing had to be done abroad), and rare opportunities to publish (there is no industry), must also contend with a broader culture that sees comics as suspect, contemptible, cheap, “popular” in the worst sense—a climate in which utterances such as this, from a 2005 theater review, remain routine: “The genre of this show is designated as ‘theatrical comics.’ On the one hand, that’s good; comics are a reflection of modern life. On the other hand, are the creators of this concept implying something? Maybe they want to insult the audience? What could be more obtuse (tupee) than comics? And what could be more offensive than to call a parable ‘comics’?” (Brzhezinskaia). To say the least, groups such as SPb.NG must operate in a semi-hostile environment, where comics have nowhere near the respect, social status, and cultural capital they enjoy in France. This, among so many other factors considered in this book, has shaped the practice, circulation, and aesthetics of Russian comics in ways unseen in the West.\n\n6\n\nIntroduction\n\nDefinition and Methodology\n\nEchoing Joseph Witek in his landmark 1989 study Comic Books as History (and more recently sustained by Charles Hatfield in his 2005 Alternative Comics: An Emerging Literature), this study “presupposes that comic books as narratives and as cultural productions merit serious critical analysis” (Witek: 3). With the coming onto its own of American comics scholarship in the last twenty years, historical and theoretical studies of the form have abounded. Among the most insightful remain Ariel Dorfman and Armand Mattelart’s Marxist How to Read Donald Duck (1971), David Kunzle’s History of the Comic Strip (1973), Will Eisner’s Comics and Sequential Art (1985), Witek’s Comic Books as History (1989), Scott McCloud’s Understanding Comics (1993), Robert C. Harvey’s The Art of the Comic Book: An Aesthetic History (1996), and Annalisa Di Liddo’s Alan Moore: Comics as Performance, Fiction as Scalpel (2009). These have added to older treatments of comics from communications and media studies (Marshall McLuhan), popular culture studies (Robert Warshow), and sociology, on top of a considerable body of European comics scholarship that has existed since the 1950s. An important question at the outset of any such investigation pertains to definition: what counts as comics for the purposes of a given project? I take as my object of study that form of visual arts practice variously called comics, fumetti, la bande dessinée, manga, tebeo, historieta, and so forth, which the American theorist Scott McCloud defines as “juxtaposed pictorial and other images in deliberate sequence” (9). While one often sees an overlap with other closely related practices, I, following McCloud and others, privilege sequentiality as comics’ primary mode of meaning-making. This study also relies on McCloud’s definition for its emphasis on distinguishing comics (often appearing, especially in Russia, as pictorial narratives) from single-panel and/or political cartoons and caricatures. (Almost all the works analyzed in this book appear in strip, album, web, or “comic book” form, not as single panels.) That said, I do not discount, as McCloud does, the cultural and historical construction of the category known as modern comics; thus I, following David Kunzle, see their proper emergence not in cave paintings or ancient Egyptian art but in the much more recent work of figures like Rodolphe Töpffer. (As discussed further on, many Russian artists adhere more closely to an ecumenical McCloudian scope, seeing comics in cave paintings.) The roots of Russian comics predate that era, and we do examine them; likewise, I discuss at some length the central role played by single-image, nonsequential caricature in the comics’ development, particularly in chapters 1 and 2. In such cases I refer to this material as “comicslike,” “proto-comics,” or simply as cartoons.5 Furthermore, the deep interest many Russian artists have shown in blurring the (to them, illusory) word/image dichotomy forms a central concern in several\n\nKomiks Agonistes\n\n7\n\nportions of the study, as in my discussion of the Constructivists and the propaganda posters of the early Soviet era; as well as in the works of Ilya Kabakov, Elena Uzhinova, Vadim Rubtsov, the aforementioned SPb. Nouvelle Graphiques, and others. My analysis proceeds from the work of such scholars as W. J. T. Mitchell, Gene Kannenberg, and Charles Hatfield, who notes: “In comics word and image approach each other: words can be visually inflected, reading as pictures, while pictures can become as abstract and symbolic as words. In brief, the written text can function like images, and images like written text” (36). These matters regarding an absolute definition or “essence” of comics (which have at times come to bedevil the online scholars forums and academic conferences of a still-emerging field) concern me less than arriving at a treatment of what I call in the text a “comics sensibility”—somewhat relatable to what the Russian writer Viktor Erofeyev sardonically called “the comics disease.” In the absence of so much which Western comics artists take for granted in their practice (an industry, a mainstream, an “alternative”) and very little in the way of Bourdieu’s autonomous recognition or heteronymous remuneration, komiksisty have had to improvise, invent, and sustain a sense of themselves, their art and their fractured subculture. How this has affected their work—whether comics or comics-like— and how to interpret it: these have been the central concerns in my research and writing. Throughout my task, I have taken as my lodestar the rigor, clarity, and systematic thinking of Thierry Groensteen—even if I have not always lived up to his high standards. Above all, I have tried to integrate his notion of comics as a system, made of disparate elements and devices that no single work need evoke comprehensively to retain the designation “comics.” As he writes, “The comics system will be a conceptual frame in which all of the actualizations of the ‘ninth art’ can find their place and be thought of in relation to each other, taking into account their differences and their commonalities within the same medium” (20). Komiks\n\nA word on some important foreign terms employed in this book. The Russian komiks derives from the English “comics,” and it is singular in number. One does also hear “komiksy” (which retains the English plural sense). In seeking to emphasize some notion of the cultural specificity of this medium, in my translation back to English I am keeping komiks as a singular to designate the art form in question. For the same reason, instead of terms like “comics creator” or “comics artist,” I often employ such Russian terms as “komiksmen,” “komiksist,” “komiksistka” (feminine), and “komiks-meiker.” As I argue in part 2, at least some contemporary Russian comic art, despite the tidal wave of foreign influences coming in through films, televisions, and\n\n8\n\nIntroduction\n\nbroadband connections, retains a sense of its own “Russianness.” In a blatant move to legitimize and support that Otherness, that local identity, I am led, perhaps somewhat piningly but unapologetically, to call it komiks. The Book’s Outline\n\nI have divided this study into two parts. Chapters 1 through 4 cover the historical and sociocultural background of comics and proto-comics in Russia, from their roots in Orthodox Christian visual practices, through the prosperous period of the lubok, the experimental works of the prerevolutionary avant garde, to their Soviet-era semi-exile to the margins of culture, to the promise and catastrophes of the postsocialist era of predatory capitalism. The book then turns, in part 2, to its proper focus: close readings of individual works and/or artists, from a cultural studies perspective. These mine contemporary komiks for insights into how they reflect and shape attitudes regarding mass culture, globalization, nationalism, antiAmericanism, consumerism, and feminism in the post-Soviet era. I also examine the problematic status of autobiography in Russian comic art and the medium’s contemporary status vis-à-vis other cultural practices, especially literature, art, and cinema. This book traces the rise of komiks from the icon to the Internet. In a study of such ambit, we will leave many stories untold, or partly told, or mentioned in passing, or ignored. My goal (not dissimilar to what Apocalypse Today perhaps inadvertently managed) is to acquaint the reader with the enormous scope, diversity, and peculiarity of Russian comic art, especially of the contemporary period, at the same time providing a sense of the cultural conditions that led to its long troubled history and continue to affect its development in the twenty-first century. Finally, through my close readings in part 2, I assay a two-pronged task: to impart on the comics scholar or reader a portrait of this form’s unique manifestations on Russian soil—while also demonstrating to the Russianists or Slavicists in the room komiks’ particular suitability to address, reflect, reshape, and refract issues familiar (and some not so familiar) to Russian culture. The following points are threaded through these pages. In whatever form they assumed, komiks 1. had to carve out a niche in a profoundly word-based culture that placed a strong emphasis on literaturnost’ (“literariness”); 2. partly due to their word/image combination often bore a trace of the foreign, degenerate and/or “mass” cultural; 3. consequently fell under the suspicious and jealous eye of the intelligentsia, becoming an art form adrift and available to many different movements, styles, and ideologies, but rarely grounded in its own industry or traditions.\n\nKomiks Agonistes\n\n9\n\nIn the early twenty-first century, komiks continues to negotiate these cultural preconceptions, to greater and lesser degrees of success. It poses a conundrum to many observers, in fact, why komiks endures in Russia, for the most part, as “the illegitimate child of 20th-century art” (Maksimova: 78). Kulikov, in his festival review, cut to the core issue: “As an art form, comics are accessible. But are you prepared to make yourselves accessible to comics?” This study explores the history and cultural factors that influenced how Russians have and perhaps will continue to answer that question.\n\nThis page intentionally left blank\n\nPart I\n\nHistorical Background\n\nThis page intentionally left blank\n\n1\n\nLubok and the Prerevolutionary Era\n\nThe Icon\n\nThe language of comics on Russian soil dates back to the country’s earliest religious icon-making tradition, which is to say, to the roots of Christianity and thus of the nation itself.1 According to Bruce Lincoln, “while frescoes and mosaics proclaimed the glory of God in Keiv’s churches, paintings done on panels of well-seasoned alder, cypress, or lime (over which a layer of linen had been stretched and covered with several thin coats of gesso) became the windows through which the people of Rus entered the world of the spirit to receive the grace of God” (22).2 Icons, having come to Rus (along with the new religion) by way of Byzantium in the tenth century, served both a religious (as objects of prayer and veneration) as well as an illustrative function: the severe, “transcendent” portraits of saints, the Madonna and the savior; heavenly scenes and biblical events, all brought to resplendent life before the eye of the illiterate believer a world he otherwise could only imagine.3 Indeed, the power of the icon, which functioned according to its own “unearthly” representational schema,4 exemplified early Russian culture’s strong inclination toward the visual.5 So strong was this predilection, in fact, that icons in Russia took on supernatural characteristics far beyond their representational role; in this recently (and in many senses enduringly) pagan culture, they were venerated as manifestations of the divine in and of themselves, possessed of miraculous healing and protective powers. Peasants knew them as bogi (“gods”). They even substituted to a degree for a weakened political culture in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, a period when the Russians languished under the “Tatar yoke” of the conquering Mongols, while monastic icon-making flourished. As described by James Billington, “the omnipresent holy pictures provided 13\n\n14\n\nHistorical Background\n\nan image of higher authority that helped compensate for the diminished stature of temporal princes. In Russia, the icon often came to represent in effect the supreme communal authority before which one swore oaths, resolved disputes, and marched into battle” (31). Since at least the thirteenth century, some icons included figures of saints in their margins, and, as in the Byzantine tradition, text identifying the subject.6 Icons depicting the Last Judgment, following the formulae of frescoes and other large-scale works, also organize large numbers of figures in tiers about Christ pantakrator (e.g., Icon of the Last Judgment, Novgorod school, seventeenth century, in Rice: 72). Sequential narratives, placing the same character in different temporal registers in the panel, are also not uncommon. Icons representing the story of St. Elias (Elijah) from the Novgorod and Northern schools (sixteenth century) typically show the saint being tended by an angel in the lower right, while in the upper portions of the image he is rising in glory on a chariot of fire, as his disciple strives to hold on to his mantle. The fiery chariot, incidentally, is often rendered as a red or yellow circle, in the manner of a graphic element, rather than “realistically.” This impulse toward longer-form narratives, deployed outright in panels, sees particular expression in the biographical (zhiteinyi) icons of saints. These feature a portrait of the subject, framed by a dozen or more incidents from his life along the margins, as in the hagiographic icon of the fourth-century Roman general St. Theodore (Fyodor) Stratelates, from the Novgorod school, early sixteenth century. These scenes, Rice reports, may have first introduced folkloristic motifs along with contemporary dress and other details (71). What also strikes the viewer of this work is the prominent role played by the fourteen sequential panels accompanied by text: not precisely “marginal,” they are large enough to form a prominent and unified design feature of the work. Theodore’s life—with its embrace of Christianity, various martyr’s tortures, and crucifixion—unfolds chronologically in the panels, while his central portrait, holding the sword “symbolizing sovereign power” (Rice: 73), embodies his dignified, eternal presence. The beholder immediately takes in both the historical and the transcendent at once, then turns back and forth from the particular to the overarching in the course of contemplation.7 As icons develop through the medieval era and secular subjects start to appear, the turn to sequential narrative strategies comes to the fore in some works—as if the framing “incidents” of St. Theodore’s portrait come to take over the center itself. This is especially marked in the Novgorod school’s Icon of the Battle Between the Men of Novgorod and the Men of Suzdal (fifteenth century), Russia’s earliest historical painting.8 It depicts the siege of Novgorod by the army of Nikolai Bogoliubski in 1169, and the intercession of the city’s icon of the Holy Virgin to aid\n\nLubok and the Prerevolutionary Era\n\n15\n\nin the city’s defense (this is an icon about an icon). The artist has divided the action into three horizontal panels (most art historians call them “bands,” “scenes,” “planes,” or “rows”) with no “gutters,” the first showing a procession carrying the icon to the Novgorod fortress or kremlin, over the Volkhov River (in an earlier moment, on the right, we see church elders bearing the icon out of the Church of the Savior, where it usually resides); the second shows the Suzdal army attacking the city, shooting arrows at the icon, which looms over the ramparts like a military banner; and the third depicting the battle itself, as the Novgorod army, led by the saints Boris, Gleb, Georgy, and Demetrius of Thessalonica, streams out of the main gate to clash with the besiegers, bodies lying at their feet. The work has dynamism and clarity of execution—one reads it “linearly,” from the top down, but also appreciates its overall design, its “legendariness.” To reinforce this unity of design, the wall of Novgorod stretches along the left side of the icon and over the two bottom panels, fusing the two moments of time into a continuum as well as underscoring the wall’s height, its impregnability. The “multi-incident” method enhanced the icon’s capacity for conveying a historical and/or ideological message; it also, as Vera Likhacheva reminds us, points to the medieval approach to time, space, and representation adopted by Russian icon painters: The coexistence on one panel of events pertaining to various times [raznovremennye sobytiia] relates to the icon’s particular understanding of artistic space, whereby is represented not a restricted portion or small part of a real space, but a concept of space as limitless, ideal in length and scope. In the case of Renaissance painting, an illusory space corresponds with the illusoriness of its representation of time. Here it is a moment that is being depicted. The viewer cannot penetrate the space shown him by the artist without crossing over into the moment which he has captured; concrete space is linked with concrete time. Whereas the icon is not tied to a concrete space, and therefore it does not represent a specific moment. Every object is conveyed “in general,” as such; what is created is not the illusion of the object itself, but, as it were, its model. (30) Likhacheva’s contention as to the icon’s “expansive” devices underscores its double-voiced nature, its capacity to represent time and space as both “here/now” and “everywhere/always.” Its conventional approach to the object as not itself but a “model” obeying its own non-mimetic rules (i.e., a device), as well as its bringing together (in some cases blending) of image and explanatory text, would all have repercussions for the representational strategies of the later lubok, the direct antecedent of comics on Russian soil.9\n\n16\n\nHistorical Background\n\nThe People’s Pictures С нИМ Сучай бьі : картиноЧек Он сьіну накупи, Развеша иХ по сТеночкаМ И саМ не Меньше МаьЧика ЛЮби на ниХ ГяеТь.

( 1 8 7 3 – 1 8 7 6 )\n\nTo the extent it initially followed upon the icon—in propagating a religious message and as the object of worship—the first form of proto-comics in Russia emerged out of devotion to God. By the early seventeenth century, the lubok or woodblock print had secured an important place in the nation’s visual culture as an expression of folk belief. In its simplest version, it was a painted wooden panel, though more typically the lubok was a cheaply made sheet (similar to European broadsheets, from which it probably originated) depicting religious scenes through crude drawings and textual captions. Though originally popular with the upper classes who could afford them, the prints slowly spread to the semiliterate peasantry—a process accelerated by Peter the Great’s progressive reforms of the eighteenth century (under which imported Western prints replaced lubki among the well-off ) and by copper printing introduced in the 1820s (which greatly increased their production). Jeffrey Brooks notes that by the end of the eighteenth century lubki were “often the first printed materials to enter the homes of the common people” (63), who decorated their walls with them, particularly for holidays.10 A steady secularization of subject continued through the eighteenth century; the lubok now depicted folk themes, fairy tales, and historical events (such as the War of 1812)11 with accompanying text. There were also lubok almanacs and calendars. Even while massproduced, lubki retained a primitive appearance and handicraft character; Brooks mentions that in Nikolskoye in the 1860s “a thousand self-trained women were employed . . . to hand-color the prints” (65), making each individual work unique. They were sold throughout the countryside by networks of wandering peddlers (ofeni), as well as in urban markets. By all accounts, the masses delighted in the simple “people’s pictures” (narodnie kartinki), as some called them, associating the prints with festivity, humor, and diversion. As noted by Dmitry Rovinsky, a major\n\nLubok and the Prerevolutionary Era\n\n17\n\nnineteenth-century collector and scholar of the lubok: “Having firmly established themselves in the everyday life of the average Russian, the pictures decorated and prettified his humdrum existence (budni), while during folk holidays and fairs they made a discernible contribution towards the creation of a particularly festive atmosphere: free, somewhat informal, filled with laughter and a joyous apprehension of life” (11). By the nineteenth century this carnival mood was in part sparked by “the association of popular prints and improper subjects” (Kelly 1998: 60), including bawdy or outright pornographic material (a topic explored at greater length in chapter 6). Another contributing factor was the Russian flair for “enlivening” the stories of the lubok through spoken commentary, as in the case of the raeshniki, showmen who incorporated the prints into their traveling peepshows (known as rayok) starting around 1830. As the viewer peeped into the box, the raeshnik “regaled them with salacious rhyming doggerel which purported to describe the pictures on view” though as often as not strayed far from the picture’s content (Kelly 1998: 49). In any case, the lubok came increasingly to be considered (particularly by the upper classes, which now recoiled from them) as a commoner’s medium, something by and for the masses. For some, this made it banal and vulgar, for others, endearingly “authentic.”12 By the 1820s, the scholar I. M. Snegirov could declare the modest people’s pictures a quasi-nostalgic repository of Russian heartland values: “[Lubki] serve as a manifestation of the national character (narodnost’) in graphic art form; it contains material for studying the history of that Russian character . . . [I]t lumps together elements of our nation which themselves display the mind, spirit, beliefs, sentiments, world view, traditions and everyday life of the Russian people—in a word, it contains everything which constitutes the edification and the amusement of its life, its uniqueness, its past—which, by the ineluctable law of regeneration, repeats itself in the present day” (259). The lubok maintained this folk, downhome character even as it increasingly became a mass-produced item manufactured in urban centers, especially Moscow. Due partly to censorship decrees issued in 1839 and 1851 that ordered greater control over the prints’ production; the advent of lithography; and the monopolistic practices of printer/publishers such as Ivan Sytin (himself a former peddler), by the twentieth century the “people’s pictures” were made primarily in factories by large firms that had frozen out or appropriated the work of rural masters. Further advances in printing, as well as illustrated periodicals, photographs, films, postcards, placards, and a general rise in literacy, contributed to the decline of the lubok in the early twentieth century. (Though lubki were put on display at the 1895 All-Russian Exhibition of Printing [Bowlt: 87].) The great surge of patriotic propaganda during World War I marked the last gasp of the traditional lubok as a mass medium in Russia, although in the two decades before the Bolshevik\n\n18\n\nHistorical Background\n\nrevolution it had great influence on avant-garde art (especially the Futurists and Neo-Primitivists), as discussed below. What Is Lubok?\n\nSince Snegirov launched the formal study of the lubok in the 1820s—to no small controversy among educated circles, who considered it beneath contempt—scholars have skirmished over several issues involved in the study of the subject. Avram Reitblat, reviewing the recent literature in 2001, notes that the very term “lubok” is problematic, since the historical record indicates that before Snegirov few people actually called the prints by that name. Instead, depending on the region and/ or what they depicted, the prints went by poteshnie listy (“funny sheets”), Suzdalskie (from Suzdal), panki (“little panels”), bogatyry (“knights”), konnitsa (referring to figures on horseback), friazhkie (“Western European”), prazdniky (“holidays”), prostovik (“simple”), balagurnik (“joker,” “jester”), satira (“satire”), Moskovskie kartiny (“Moscow pictures”), or simply listy (“sheets”)—among a plethora of other names. Snegirov himself called the prints “lubok” fully aware of the term’s ambiguity: did it refer to the bark (lub) of the linden tree, from which he claimed peasants formed the wood blocks; or did it point to Moscow’s Lubianka Street, where the sheets were printed and near which they were sold; or, indeed, to the wooden box in which the ofeni carried the prints for sale? Or did the word simply connote something “crude,” “badly made,” and “ramshackle,” as it did in other contexts? Evidently, Boris Sokolov surmises, Snegirov simply picked one of the local names for the prints; already by the 1840s this had grown into a general term, handed down to the present day.13 For his part, noted Brooks, the collector Dmitry Rovinsky seems to have named his 1881 book devoted to the subject The Russian People’s Pictures (Russkie narodnie kartinki) precisely to get away from “lubok’s” limited and negative associations (63). Reitblat further argues that individual lubkovedy (“lubokologists”) have focused too much on one or another aspect of lubok—technological advances, distribution networks, propaganda uses, subjects, intended audience, aesthetics, production methods—when only a unitary approach will yield a properly comprehensive picture. A certain fuzziness still adheres to the subject at hand: a 1997 collection of essays, The World of the People’s Pictures (Mir narodnoi kartinki), featured essays on Indian, Brazilian, Mongolian, and other Asian popular prints in addition to Russian examples. Meanwhile, Reitblat laments, lubkovedy have largely yielded the study of lubochnie knizhki (lubok chapbooks or booklets) such as the Koren’ Bible to folklorists, book specialists, and literary scholars. Finally, even a minimal delving into the background and development of lubok demonstrates a great variety of styles and methods—engraving on wood, then\n\nLubok and the Prerevolutionary Era\n\n19\n\ncopper; the turn to lithography and chromolithography; and the more artisanal approach of the risovannyi (drawn) lubok all had ramifications for the prints’ look and subjects—yet today many scholars (especially, as we will see, comics scholars) tend to refer to the lubok as if it were one monolithic entity throughout its history. Chief Characteristics\n\nIn both form and content, lubok was a unique hybrid art. First, its interaction of word and image, notes the literary critic/semiotician Yurii Lotman, was not simply that of an illustration and explanatory caption, but more like a theme and its elaboration (razvertyvanie): “It is as if the caption ‘plays up’ (razygrivaet) the drawing, compelling the viewer to perceive it not as something static, but as an action” (484). This playful, dramatic quality of the lubok (along with its humor) encourages the reader/viewer to “enter into” the world of the story, to actively interpret it and not to regard it passively from “outside”—a reaction sometimes further encouraged by the marked departure of the caption text from the image.14 This, according to Boris Sokolov, made the lubok a “Third Culture” combination of the graphic, textual, and dramatic arts, well tailored to narrative (195). A sort of “paper theater” as much as “paper icon,” some lubki even framed the action with arches, footlights, and curtains, as in Mikhail Nekhoroshevskii’s lubochniy chapbook The Parable of the Prodigal Son (nineteenth century). The lubok’s ludic characteristics further manifest themselves in its similarly humorous treatment of speech balloons15 or scrolls (which some figures still held in their hands as late as the eighteenth century). Lotman chooses a well-known print of the Fool Farnos as illustration: it shows a cloud escaping his backside, with the inscription: “I let out some air (dukh) from my rump, so the mosquitoes I can lump” (484). The secular lubok, in short, presents its action with a marked conditionality that recall’s Likhacheva’s icon representing not the object but “as it were, its model.” Compare this with Lotman’s description of the lubok’s nonmimetic approach to the image: “The representation of the scene produces a principally different artistic effect from a drawing which the viewer directly associates with some reality or other. In effect the representation of a representation, lubok creates a heightened degree of contingency, of conventionality (uslovnost’). An image that renders itself the sign of a sign transports the viewer into a peculiar, playful ‘reality’” (483). This renders the “simple” print a complex, highly coded, interactive multimedia experience, tied to other aspects of the semiliterate peasant’s world. Boris Dubin argues in his 1981 essay, “Towards a Poetics of the People’s Pictures,” that the secular lubok’s representational strategies relate to the imagery and ambience of the holiday (at holiday time, revelers behave toward each other with a high degree of conditionality). Accordingly, in his Bakhtin-inflected account, the\n\n20\n\nHistorical Background\n\nThe story of Lazarus from The Bible of Vasily Koren’, known as the Koren’ Bible (1692–96).\n\nlubok contains no “objective” speech; the characters “play themselves” (predstavliaiutsia) (paraphrased in Reitblat 2001: 324). Indeed, the phrase “play themselves” is not coincidental: the drama is enhanced by lubok’s hieroglyphic nature: figures appear in recognizable dramatic poses for easy “reading,” such as the oft-seen arms raised in panic in “Yaga Baba Fights the Corcodile” [sic] (eighteenth century); the swinging of sticks in panel after panel to beat drunkards in “The Great Head of Drunkenness” (mid-eighteenth century); and the Firebird with its characteristic outspread wings and beatific expression, seen in countless iterations up through the end of the nineteenth century. (In another, more repulsive example, the arc of vomit—whether from illness or, more often, drink—is rendered through particularly stylized conventions over the centuries.)16 Furthermore, the many coded references in eighteenth-century works to Peter the Great (analyzed below) argue for the sophistication of lubok signifying practices, particularly when mobilized to evade the Czarist censor. Another consequence of lubok’s theatrical poetics is reflected in its treatment of time—in particular, through sequential narratives. Lotman agrees with Likhacheva that post-Renaissance painting largely abandoned narratival approaches in favor of more synchronic “freeze-frame” depictions, but the impulse to capture discreet moments as “stories in pictures,” developed in the icon, was passed on to the lubok. Anna Nekrylova, in fact, links the lubok’s dynamic, plot-driven strategies to the icon and, significantly, to comics17: “The desire to unite the entire course of events led to the breaking up of the sheet into panels (kadrirovka), whereby in each cell or conventionally designated frame were drawn different moments of the story, which allows the viewer, by means of transferring the gaze\n\nLubok and the Prerevolutionary Era\n\n21\n\nfrom one episode to the next, to ‘read’ the drawn text, as occurs when one views the border panels of hagiographic icons and modern comics” (13). The lubok, in short, represents the first consistently realized expression of a comics language in Russia: it splits up the page into discreet, juxtaposed temporal units; brings together word and image—and, at times, sets them at odds; and also undermines the text/picture distinction through such schemes as the hieroglyphic “dramatic poses” of the figures, evincing Groensteen’s “iconographic solidarity.” Moreover, contrary to modern opinions about the reception of comics in Russia,18 consumers themselves readily understood this sequential function of the lubok, as shown in Alexander Pushkin’s 1830 short story “The Station Master”: Then he began to register my traveling passport, and I occupied myself with examining the pictures that adorned his humble but tidy abode. They illustrated the story of the Prodigal Son. In the first, a venerable old man, in a nightcap and dressing gown, was taking leave of the restless lad, who was hastily accepting his blessing and a bag of money. In the next picture, the dissolute conduct of the young man was depicted in vivid colors: he was represented sitting at table surrounded by false friends and shameless women. . . . Under each picture I read some suitable German verses. (190) This episode in Pushkin’s story illustrates the lubok’s social context (a lowly stationmaster’s house, decorated with the people’s pictures), the ease with which one may casually read the sequential images and “suitable” text, pertaining to a recognizable story (in this case a parable). There is even registered the slight condescension of the narrator, a member of the gentry, toward the simple adornments of the lower-classes’ “humble but neat” quarters, centering on the lubok.19 The Russian print’s longest narrative expression came in the lubok-chapbook or people’s engraved book (narodnaia gravirovannaia kniga)20 such as the Bible of Vasily Koren’, known as the Koren’ Bible (1692–1696). This combined the approaches of illuminated manuscripts and icons for simplified versions of major biblical episodes on sheets sewn together into booklets. Some of these booklets, such as Alexei Rostovtsev’s Petra the Publican (Petra-mytaria) (1740s), were made so as to unfold, harmonica-like, for display of the entire story on a wall—making them suitable for two functions: personal reading and group demonstration/explication: “[They were] read aloud to great numbers of people gathered in a hut, similar to how they would listen together to a fairy tale (even if some in the crowd could read)” (Sakovich: 128). The lubok-chapbook, in fact, was a direct forerunner of both the long-form narrative comic book and the poster in Russia. A final point about the treatment of time in lubok poetics: as with the hagiographic icon, the viewer takes in the whole composition and retains this wider context (in her “peripheral vision,” as it were) even as she reads its individual\n\n22\n\nHistorical Background\n\nsegments. This, along with the lubok’s “conventionality” and word/image interaction, blurs the temporal dimension: “The viewer perceives the drawing, in its turn, as pertaining not to some particular moment or other of the caption, but to its entirety” (Lotman: 491). This effect is achieved even in prints with only one nominal illustration: Lubok artists, like the ancient Russian creators of illuminated manuscripts (knizhnie miniatiury) represented on the space of a sheet both the main episode and its result. Thus, for example, in pictures depicting [the folk hero] Ilya Muromets shooting his arrows at Solovei the Robber, two arrows are shown: one in the knight’s tightly-drawn bow, the other in Solovei the Robber’s eye. In actual fact this is one arrow, but by doubling it, the artist has recorded the beginning and end of its flight. Moreover, in the background of these same pictures, we often see depicted the outcome of the encounter: Ilya Muromets mounted atop his knight’s steed, on his way to Kiev, the defeated Solovei the Robber strapped to his stirrups. (Nekrylova: 13) In reading the lubok, we are distinguishing between discreet moments (the only way narrative can unfold), but we are also in a sense “unifying” these contrasting moments into one structurally related composition in which time goes backward or forward, or in any order the reader/viewer’s eye wishes to go. The addition of text further complicated this signifying practice, at times “bringing the picture to life,” at others contradicting it. The doubly two-fold nature of the lubok (its paradoxical treatment of time, and its word/image combination), its easy readability as well as its capacity for sardonic subtlety, would appeal to artists given to smooth narratives and politically subversive sleight-of-hand. That the form only “played at” meaning did nothing to dull its sharp satirical barbs in a context of state censorship. The Uses of the People’s Pictures\n\nIn technique and printing, lubki throughout the centuries tended to lag behind the prints of William Hogarth and other artists of Western Europe, but they retained a wicked satirical edge—and not rarely, a veiled political message. Though loved by “the people,” authorities of various sorts in Russia tended to view them with suspicion. As early as 1674 the Russian Orthodox Church drafted decrees against “paper icons” and what it then called “German (foreign) sheets” that “corrupted the image of the savior.” The Orthodox especially feared and railed against prints disseminated by the Old Believers (schismatics who had broken from the church over the Patriarch Nikon’s reforms in the mid-seventeenth century). Under the Czar Peter’s (1682–1725) Westernizing reforms, secular subjects in the people’s\n\nLubok and the Prerevolutionary Era\n\n23\n\nprint proliferated, and the government itself (as well as its opponents) made liberal use of the form to propagandize. Owing to the difficulty of regulating the easily made lubki, the Russian state would periodically address the best way to monitor and if possible censor subversive images. This it did in 1804, 1839 (when it decreed that all images must bear a stamp of origin), 1848, and most decisively, 1851. The latter law, drafted by Dmitry Bludov, head of the Second Section of the czar’s chancellery, ordered all previously existing printing plates destroyed, the better to prevent reproduction of nonapproved old messages and to control the content of new approved ones. The law’s effect, however, proved mostly commercial: folk artisans and smaller lubok producers went out of business, while entrepreneurs like Petr Sharapov cornered the publishing market with superior resources, and production of lubki moved to factories in cities. As Rovinsky mourned, “so ended the uncensored people’s pictures.”21 Yet even then, regulating the message of the lubok proved no easy task, particularly given the coded imagery so often used by artists. Several satirical eighteenth-century works, for example, attacked Peter’s reforms through stealthy Aesopian strategies. One widely reproduced print slyly mocked Peter himself as the bewhiskered “Cat of Kazan,” while others ridiculed his Enlightenment-era attempts to modernize the country; for example, the emancipation of women led to reactionary lubki depicting their abuse (Kunzle: 252–54), while the Westernizing edict to shave beards sparked “The Barber Wants to Cut Off the Old Believer’s Beard” (Norris: 38). Rovinsky interpreted “Baba Yaga Rides Forth to Fight the Corcodile” [sic], another topical early eighteenth-century print, as a lampoon on Peter’s marital strife, with a tiny ship beneath the “crocodile” signifying the czar’s passion for the navy; his wife, Catherine, as the folk witch Baba Yaga; and a bottle of spirits showing the couple’s drinking habits.22 Of the “revenge on Peter” series (attributed to the Old Believers or other groups resistant to the reformist czar), none achieved as much popularity as “The Burial of the Cat by the Mice,” released in at least three versions in the first half of the eighteenth century. These depict the funeral procession of the “Kazan cat” by up to sixty-six mice, each named after regions of Russia, some playing musical instruments (music at funerals had only been allowed since 1698), with satirical text. Some versions of the work stretched out over several normal-sized sheets; Rovinsky exhaustively catalogs the innumerable clues that identify the cat as Peter and the mice as the relieved Russian people, freed from their Westernizing despot to return to traditional life (139–48).23 Wartime lubki offer another example of the medium’s satirical bent, as in Ivan Terebenev’s 1812 “Russians Teaching Napoleon to Dance”: the invading emperor’s humiliating defeat is crowned by his being forced to perform a recognizably Russian dance, to the whip of a peasant. An example from World War I, “So You Want to Be Napoleon” by Ivan Sytin, evokes both the shaving motif of “The\n\n24\n\nHistorical Background\n\n1.2. The Burial of the Cat by the Mice, lubok, first half of the eighteenth century.\n\nBarber Wants to Cut Off the Old Believer’s Beard” and the strong xenophobic stance of this genre. In a series of five panels, the towering Kaiser Wilhelm is brutally transformed into “Napoleon”—by having his mustache and head shaved, feet lopped off, and arm broken. The “before and after” effect capitalizes on the lubok’s sequential narrative strategies. The drawn (risovannyi) lubok, a particular form adapted by Old Believer communities from the printed type (as well as icons and book illustration), made especially trenchant use of separate panels for purposes of contrast. Several, such as “Attributes of the Divine Service And Symbols Used by Old-Believers and the Official Orthodox” (1880s), depict the differences—sometimes slight—in the two denominations’ rituals, with a decorative column or gutter between them. The viewer is clearly meant to compare the two rather similar scenes precisely in search of the (critical) differences and arrive at the proper ideological conclusions. The Old Believers, as noted by E. I. Itkina, saw in the lubok a particularly effective, “visually clear” (nagliadnyi) means of spreading their religious messages (7), while their artisanal production methods and closed distribution networks allowed them to long elude the censors.24 The “cross-gutter” comparison, as we will see, became a standard technique in Soviet anticapitalist propaganda during the twentieth century. As a form of kitsch, the lubok borrowed iconography, personages, and plots from bourgeois culture, but refashioned them into a “primitive” and insolent amusement for the masses. The prints, along with their clarifying (or, as it were, obfuscating) text, often of a satirical nature, combined words and pictures in some ways not dissimilar to those of illustrations on the editorial pages of major periodicals of the European west. As a popular form, the lubok mirrored the mass appeal of cartoons elsewhere—though the semiliterate, Orthodox audience of Russia called for a different approach much closer to theater, rhyming verse, and the carnival. Finally, by illustrating and elaborating on scenes from favorite stories, Bible passages, or historical events, the lubok was inextricably tied to other media; in this too, like modern comics elsewhere, it was a hybrid form.\n\nLubok and the Prerevolutionary Era\n\n25\n\n1.3. Attributes of the Divine Service And Symbols Used by Old-Believers and the Official Orthodox, Old Believer lubok, late nineteenth century.\n\nThe patriotic fervor stirred up by Russia’s disastrous war against Japan (1904– 1905) and World War I proved the last gasp for the lubok as a mass medium. It eventually gave way to rising literacy rates and more “impressive” technologies like radio, cinema, and the placard, but the “crude” lubok made an indelible stamp on the comics style of future generations. It was precisely to this “hand-made,” primitive, and above all indigenous quality of the lubok that the Russian avant-garde would turn to create a new style of art for the twentieth century. The World of Art and Ivan Bilibin\n\nWith the turn of the twentieth century, the lubok’s nationalist “authenticity” would appeal to Russian artists eager to reject or reshape European modernism and draw inspiration from home-grown forms. Two major art movements of the prerevolutionary period made use of the lubok in this way, to varying degrees: Alexander Benois and Sergei Diaghilev’s World of Art (Mir iskusstva) and the Russian Futurists. Inspired by the philosophy of Sergei Soloviev, and embodying some of the highest aspirations of Russia’s fin-de-siècle Silver Age, the St. Petersburg-based World of Art straddled the border between old and new, East and West, fine and applied art, high culture and commerce—laying the foundation for the much more radical avant-garde. Uniting disparate artists, poets, and literary critics, the movement proclaimed a new era in Russian art, one that fed off European culture but ceded nothing to it. The World of Art journal, started in 1898, was the first Russian publication to focus such close attention on the quality of printing, design, and the relationship of text to illustration, celebrating beauty of a decidedly urbane, aristocratic stripe. In seeking to build bridges between European modernism and ancient Russian traditions, the World of Art brought lubok-inspired painters such as Viktor Vasnetsov and, in 1906, the graphic artist Ivan Bilibin to\n\n26\n\nHistorical Background\n\nthe front ranks of art.25 Albeit polished up and “idealized,” the people’s pictures would no longer be reflexively thought of as a peasant, folk, or mass-produced form unsuitable for cultured Russians; the World of Art was the first group to incorporate Russian popular printing into a serious arts practice. The direct link between the lubok and Russian graphic art and comics of the twentieth century is Bilibin, book illustrator, caricaturist, set designer, and amateur ethnographer, who joined the World of Art in 1906. In search of “classical” Russian culture to revive and reshape for the new era, artists like Bilibin conducted excursions to the provinces and incorporated what they found there—peasant architecture, embroidery designs, the lubok—into their work. At the same time, the cosmopolitan Bilibin was heavily influenced by Art Nouveau (he had studied in Munich, though briefly, in 1898) and deeply admired the German satirical journal Simplicissimus (a tremendous inspiration to a generation of Russian caricaturists; see below). The result was a “softening” and “mainstreaming” of the lubok’s more crude edges, while often retaining its compositions, for an idealized image of traditional Russian (especially medieval) culture, brought to life in illustrated books of fairy tales, epic heroes, maidens, and castles.26 Bilibin’s most “lubok-like” mature style appears in his 1910 illustrations to Pushkin’s The Golden Cockerel: not only do the drawn lines have a “roughness” evocative of a print, but the elaborately adorned horses assume stylized poses lifted from the lubok. Bilibin’s series of postcard illustrations (early 1900s) featuring men and women in traditional dress, animals, and other subjects, integrated oldstyle Russian text in familiar ways, as well. A 1905 postcard, “The Bird of Paradise Alkonost,” is extremely suggestive of lubok; the picture contains a caption, a scroll of text held up by the figure, and even speech emanating from its mouth.27 While Bilibin’s style did not alter much throughout his career, after 1910 it reflects a closer link to Byzantine and Russian icon-making, but the lubok-like compositions, flattened space and “handicraft character” remain. Though by 1915 the World of Art movement had passed its moment, accused of having descended into philistinism and “academicism,” its various members soon to be scattered by the Revolution, the group proved a crucial bridge between the old Russian popular printmaking culture and the dizzying experiments of the emerging avant-garde. In the graphic arts, none embodied that cross-over ethos as did Bilibin.28 The Russian Futurists\n\nIn contrast to other national Futurist movements of the early twentieth century which promoted a total break with the past, the Russian Futurist and NeoPrimitivist artists we will consider, such as Aleksei Kruchenykh, Olga Rozanova, and Mikhail Larionov, hearkened back to the tradition of lubok and older medieval forms to impart on their works an amateurish, hand-made, and decidedly\n\nLubok and the Prerevolutionary Era\n\n27\n\n1.4. War, chapbook by Olga Rozanova and Alexei Kruchenykh, 1916.\n\n“non-European” look. As E. F. Kovtun writes, “In contrast to their Western colleagues, Russian artists had close at hand, at home, a living stratum of peasant art, preserved, from which their own art received a direct impetus. It was not necessary to travel, like Gauguin, to Tahiti; it was enough to go to the Viatsky or Tula region to encounter the deeply-laid, at times even archaic traditions of the people’s art” (1989: 95). Thus the Futurists looked to the indigenous lubok—rather than the Western cartoon—for their primitivist and Cubo-Futurist graphic works.29 In 1912, they brought the lubok and the Russian proto-comics form to the front ranks of the high art movement with their experimental lithographic works The World Backwards (Mirskontsa), Old-Time Love (Starinnaia liubov), and A Game in Hell (Igra v Adu) (over the next four years, they produced over fifty publications in all). These collaborative, cheaply produced chapbooks challenged what they saw as the more effete aestheticism of the World of Art; Kruchenykh and the young Vladimir Mayakovsky sought to produce “anti-books” with which to undermine common stereotypes of perception.30 Many, like Mayakovsky, were poets as well as artists, and saw their task as dissolving the artificial borders between text and image; they were “artists working in a textual medium” (Degot 2000: 18). Responding to these works in 1913, the critic Sergei Bobrov noted, “the analogous aspirations of both poem and drawing and the explanation of the poem by means of the drawing are realized not by literary, but by painterly means” (quoted in Gurianova: 97). Indeed, the illustrated poems of Mirskontsa and its sister publications represent a new attempt to combine words and images; the handwritten texts change their character from page to page, getting entangled with the primitivist drawings of\n\n28\n\nHistorical Background\n\nRozanova and Larionov in blots and bursts of color. As with the lubok, the coloring often crosses the contours of the drawings and the paint varies minutely from copy to copy, giving each book the uniqueness of an original; this is especially evident in Larionov’s illustration for Kruchenykh’s poem “Pomada.” In many cases the text itself becomes the illustration, as in Rozanova and Kruchenykh’s War (1916), a book of anti–World War I woodblock prints. “With Horror He Recalls the Ones He Himself Saw Crucified Upside-down by the Germans” combines the text indissolubly with the illustrated atrocity for a horrific effect, made only more so by the naïve style. The Futurists created a type of lithography in which words and images worked in intimate closeness; one could not simply remove one or the other from the page without destroying the work’s total meaning. (This would have a tremendous influence on future Russian artists, such as the Constructivists, who also dynamically combined text and visuals.) In trying to find the ancient “organic unity” of word and picture on the printed page, the artists of this circle reimagined the lubok, infusing it with a distinct aesthetic sensibility. Through their experimentation with different media (ink, crayon, pastel, collage) they expanded the possibilities of the medium. Among the most radical of these experiments with text and image, Kruchenykh, Vasily Kamensky, and K. M. Zdanevich’s anti-book 1918 (1917) employs a full-fledged hieroglyphic style in their so-called ferro-concrete poems. Here the words swerve and twist along textual landscapes, unfolding in quasi-plots. Kamensky’s “Sun (a lubok)” from the same album, explicitly harkens back to its predecessors in Russian printmaking, while boldly pushing their compositional and narrative capacities to the edge of abstraction—and beyond. “The urge to restore to the word and the image their lost primordial purity” (Petrova and Markade: 136) led the Futurists to provocative creations, to a new language that was both ancient, “primordial,” and thoroughly modern, groundbreaking. No less a personage than the collector Sergei Tretiakov struggled, in fact, to adequately describe the effect of these works, with their shock of the new/old, had on him: “No, these are not poems. These are drawings; the graphics predominate, but graphics-in-letters (bukvennyi), bearing with them (as accompaniment) the sensation of sounds, outgrowths of associations linked with speech noises” (quoted in Kovtun: 75). The Futurists rechristened the “contemporary lubok” (sevodniashnyi lubok) as an icon of modernism—spectacularly so—just as the traditional form was dying out—along with the ancien régime of the Romanov dynasty. The Satirical Journal\n\nWhile Russia (owing in part to more severe censorship under the czars) did not have as long a pedigree of satirical caricature and cartoons as other European\n\nLubok and the Prerevolutionary Era\n\n29\n\npowers,31 we can at least briefly mention some of the highlights before the watershed year of 1905, when the number of illustrated satirical publications exploded. The politically subversive sensibility seen in the anti-Peter lubki of the eighteenth century lived on in the work of such artists as Alexei Venetsianov (who started the first satirical journal in Russia at the start of the eighteenth century) and Terebenev with his anti-Napoleon prints. By midcentury the first regularly published humor journal, Eralash (“Jumble”), appeared, though it soon fell victim to the upsurge in censorship in the wake of the revolutionary turmoil in France. The year 1859 saw the most important satirical journal of the century, Iskra (“The Spark”), which described itself as “the doleful chronicle of the amusing and dark sides of Russian life,” followed in 1862 by another periodical of politically inflected caricature, Gudok (“The Whistle”). One of the most popular caricaturists of the era, Alexander Lebedev, published his work in such journals as Strekoza (“Dragonfly,” 1875), Oskolki (“Fragments,” 1891), and others.32 In 1896 the premiere of Albert Langen’s German weekly Simplicissimus had an incalculable impact on Russian cartoonists. Satirical works were also widely used in the turn-of the-century yellow press: “Drawings lampooning local officials or commenting sardonically on the city’s social problems or simply illustrating the day’s stories were daily features” in such down-market fare as Peterburgskii listok, which specialized in chronicling the waves of “hooliganism” engulfing the city (Neuberger: 17). An especially sadistic drawing from December 31, 1903, for example, shows a “Petersburg-style” stabbing (in the back) that delights in wide-eyed, cartoony gore (41). A more realistic illustration, “Drunkenness Among Children in Petersburg” (March 20, 1914), employs a sequential technique to contrast besodden boys with a girl rescued from their fate by “some old auntie or grandma” (183).33 The 1905 Revolution and its aftermath saw a burst of caricature and satirical journals as a result of the stark changes in the nation’s political life. In the wake of the violent crackdown against protesters in St. Petersburg in January (an event known as “Bloody Sunday”), Czar Nicholas II was forced to concede some of his powers in the form of the October Manifesto, which promised greater civic rights and freedoms, including freedom of speech. Publishers seized on the reforms and new journals poured forth—309 from 1905 to 1907, as compared to 89 for the whole of the nineteenth century (Bowlt: 111). And it was not only a matter of quantity; some of the greatest works of Russian caricature appeared in this era; renowned artists such as Boris Kustodiev, Dobuzhinsky, Bilibin, and Valentin Serov vented forth their indignation at the state in morbid expressionistic works full of marauding skeletons, piles of corpses, grotesque politicians, and soldiers. In one the most striking images, “October Idyll” (1905), Dobuzhinsky showed a huge splotch of blood against a wall and sidewalk, with a child’s doll, a shoe, and a pair of glasses strewn on a city street.34\n\n30\n\nHistorical Background\n\nThe short-lived journal Zhupel (“The Bugbear,” 1905–1906) proved one the most notorious and oft-confiscated by the censor, despite the new free speech law. It published two of the boldest satirical drawings aimed at the czar himself: Bilibin’s “Donkey (Equus Asinus), 1/20th Life-Size,” which showed an ass surrounded by czarist emblems (this caused the journal to be shut down and got Bilibin arrested); and Zinovii Gzhebin’s “Werewolf Eagle, or Internal and Foreign Policy,” which right-side-up depicts the state coat of arms with its double-headed eagle— but when turned upside-down reveals a portrait of the sovereign’s bare rear end. Cartoonists also quickly learned how to make their points more subtly and evade the censor; they “constantly expanded their territory and their targets of attack, demolishing one obstacle after another as they went, thriving on censorship” (King and Porter: 18). At times, these artists made use of the “cross-gutter” comparison and sequential properties of juxtaposed panels observed in the Old Believers and wartime lubki. The first issue of Zritel (“The Spectator”) responded to a legal restriction on openly depicting the 1905 disorder by placing a frame of soldiers’ feet marching next to another frame of civilians’ feet, fleeing. The wordless art followed the letter of the law, while the meaning, read “across” the panels, was clear. Such politicized aesthetic strategies, honed over centuries in the indigenous lubok, reinvigorated by the Futurists and satirical cartoonists, would carry over into the dawn of the Soviet era—and transform Russia’s comics heritage in new, exciting, and tragic ways.35\n\n2\n\ncomics during the Soviet Era\n\nRevolution\n\nThe Bolsheviks, led initially by Vladimir Ilyich Lenin, sought a radical break with the traditions of the past as well as with the capitalist West, and launched a bold refashioning of what they saw as backward Russian society into a modern industrialized state grounded on Marxist principles.1 As a result, the seventy-year Soviet domination of Russia inaugurated by the Communist revolution of November 7, 1917 (new style), proved on the whole disruptive to the development of comics as an art form, consigning it to the margins of culture. Contrary to popular perceptions of comics (or their absence) under communism, however, we should view this as the beginning, not the end, of the story. Almost from the moment they wrested the country from the provisional government of Alexander Kerensky, the Soviets set off a wide-ranging propaganda war aimed at winning over the populace to the new order and discrediting the old regime (parts of which were still fighting the Reds in a civil war). As the historian Victoria Bonnell noted, for the Bolsheviks the issue was “not only the seizure of power but the seizure of meaning” (1). The new state embarked on a mammoth campaign to destroy the old czarist emblems of the Romanov Dynasty (toppling statues, destroying churches, assassinating the former czar himself along with his family) and erecting its own symbols (the hammer and sickle, the heroic proletariat, the emancipated woman).2 This campaign encompassed all available means, from the old (posters, public speeches, gazettes) to the new (cinema, radio, street reenactments of history). Censorship was for the most part lifted, and artists of various persuasions were encouraged to pursue their most radical visions. In so doing, the Soviets in the first decade of the revolution unleashed an unparalleled 31\n\n32\n\nHistorical Background\n\nera of social and artistic experimentation. As Richard Stites notes: “A whole array of new symbols and rituals were introduced and infused with anti-capitalism, the collective spirit, atheism, and machine worship. Bolshevik artists and propagandists went to the people with a culture for the people and in doing so they tried to combine the new with the old, self-consciously infusing circus, fairbooth, lubok, folk ditties, songs and dances with revolutionary content” (1992: 39). Few images better captured this spirit than Dmitry Moor’s iconic 1920 poster Have You Volunteered? which depicts a Soviet army soldier in blazing red, rifle in hand, pointing at the viewer with a steely gaze, challenging him to join up and fight the Whites. Behind him stands a factory (also burning red), its smokestacks belching black—emblem of the new state’s industrial might. Moor’s poster repackages the old tropes of bravery, patriotism, and masculinity with the promise of a brave, new, electrified world.3 In short, visual culture formed a central front in the war of ideas. The turbulent condition of the arts in Russia after 1917, the emergence of proletarian culture as seen in such leftist groups as the Proletcult,4 and the continuation of projects from the prerevolutionary Silver Age all saw themselves reflected in the diversity of the comics and proto-comics language which survived into this time of great innovation. In this process, the dynamic visual strategies of the lubok, both in its traditional form and as reimagined by the Futurists, held strong appeal for its efficacy as a mass medium. But, as noted, the lubok also represented a vestige of the old world the Soviets increasingly sought to expunge. One arts movement from that era of particular interest, due to its focus on the interaction of word and image, is the Constructivists. This loose association of artists and theorists (chief among them Vladimir Tatlin and the husband/wife team of Alexander Rodchenko and Varvara Stepanova) valorized the new values of utility, functionality, and the machine. As “artist-engineers,” they emphasized industrial materials (metal and glass), architectural forms, and pragmatic objects, all intended to bring art out of the museums and into everyday life.5 Yet by the end of the first Soviet decade, with Lenin dead, the country depleted, and the New Economic Policy (NEP)6 undermining (as some saw it) the hardcore principles of War Communism, the state began clamping down on free expression, particularly on the avant-garde—which it now accused of bourgeois obtuseness and “formalism.” Starting in earnest in the 1930s, with Joseph Stalin having eliminated his rivals, consolidated power, cancelled NEP, and launched the first Five Year Plan of crash industrialization, Soviet policies on the arts looked inward, casting an intolerant gaze on anything that bore traces of Western-type mass culture and, during the cold war, America. Comics, broadly speaking, fell victim to this political outlook; no comic book industry as such ever developed in the Soviet era.\n\nComics during the Soviet Era\n\n33\n\nYet it would be wrong to label Russian “comicsophobia” an exclusively “topdown” phenomenon. Especially after 1931, Soviet edicts on reading, children’s upbringing, and “foreignness” in their main points coincided with the preferences and prejudices of Russian literary culture.7 To the extent they pondered the question, the word/image interaction of comics indeed struck many educated Russians—reared on nineteenth-century classic authors—as “alien,” simplistic, and an impediment to “real” reading. (This attitude, as we shall see, remains alive to the present day.) The historical context is also relevant; the elimination of illiteracy in the first decades of Soviet power and the creation of an educated populace was one of the state’s major tasks. Certain “weighty” literary works (Tolstoy, Gorky) were valued far more highly than other “lightweights.” The sort of mass-culture product represented by comics simply struck educators and ordinary Russians as antithetical to this mission.8 Moreover, as noted in our discussion of the prerevolutionary lubok, the small Russian intellectual class, or intelligentsia, had a long tradition of viewing popular culture or art meant chiefly for diversion and/or profit as suspect, even morally hazardous. (The Russian masses, eagerly consuming lubki and lubochnaia literatura in the nineteenth century, of course viewed the matter differently.) In short, the upper-class antipathy to the lubok attached to modern comics; Soviet ideology and censorship practices enforced that posture as state policy.9 As Stephen Lovell has argued in The Russian Reading Revolution, both the leadership and the ordinary citizen contributed to the emergence in this period of a powerful “Soviet reading myth”—a self-image of Russians as “the most active readers in the world” (samyi chitaiushchii narod v mire). At best, then, comics were something to grow out of; at worst, they were a mind-numbing capitalist diversion and impediment to learning. Mostly, they were absent. In general, comics culture as understood in the West remained a marginal phenomenon, particularly as the Soviet Union under Stalin developed into a full-fledged authoritarian state in the twentieth century. (As we will see, this ideological stance had consequences both economic—the lack of a comics industry—and aesthetic—the relative paucity of word balloons and sound effects in such Soviet-era comics and strips as did exist. Presumably, those comics devices seemed too identifiably “Western.”)10 However, the comics language did survive, even in the official sphere. At times it even prospered. This tended to happen during moments of national crisis, when aspects of the culture normally submerged or marginalized (such as pseudo-capitalism or religion) were revived out of existential necessity, as during World War II. But even in quieter times, examples of a Soviet comics style never fully disappeared from the satirical and children’s press, nor from the propaganda and advertising poster. In addition, during the postwar era there arose an underground of artists, the Non-Conformists, viewing banned foreign works and producing their\n\n34\n\nHistorical Background\n\nown, though with little chance of ever seeing them published or exhibited; some were punished for their activities. A subset of this group, the Conceptualists, incorporated comics techniques as a not-infrequent element of their work, partly due to comics’ “subversive” cachet in mainstream Soviet culture. The history of Russian comics under the Soviet regime thus falls into three main parts: the Revolutionary Era (1917–1934), Socialist Realism (1934–mid1980s), and, parallel with the latter, the Non-Conformists (1960s–1980s). Furthermore, this being an age of schism, when Russian culture was split in two, we will also note the work of comics artists of the diaspora—the “Whites” who fled the Red Communists during and after the Revolution. These figures in some cases made enormous contributions to the comics cultures of other countries (e.g., Yugoslavia), while comics in the USSR remained, by comparison, a “stalled medium.” This was the general picture until the ascension of reformist Communist Party general secretary Mikhail Gorbachev in 1985 and his policy of Perestroika, when comics finally shuffled off their customary shackles—though not the age-old prejudices adhering to the form. This chapter provides (can only provide) a schematic survey, filling in some of that long, colorful, often tragic, history. The Revolutionary Poster\n\nThe first, most explicit and for a time most wide-ranging application of comics techniques in the Soviet era appeared in the crucial mass medium of the poster— the direct descendant of the satirical journals of the 1905 generation as well as the lubki of World War I; in fact, many artists, such as the renowned Moor, formed living links to the older traditions. The poster or plakat (as advertisement, as public service announcement, as breaking news vehicle) became a major tool for the Bolsheviks to spread information far, wide, and in a form they could control. Capitalizing, as the icon-makers had done, on Russian culture’s penchant for the visual, the producers of posters could cast their message more cost-effectively than film, more quickly than newspapers, more lastingly than radio or the telegraph, all while making an emotionally engaged appeal to the eye. Between 1919 and 1922, over 7.5 million posters, postcards, and lubok pictures were distributed, while in 1920 alone the state publishing house Gosizdat released more than 3.2 million copies of 75 different posters (Bonnell: 5).11 The need for a modern, progressive, and “dialectical” design of these visual materials was met by new art groups eager to serve the revolution, in particular the Constructivists.12 But the plakat, as noted by several scholars and Sovietologists, did much more than disseminate news or showcase modern art techniques. It played a critical role in explaining, visualizing, and shaping a new civilization, Bolshevism, at a time\n\nComics during the Soviet Era\n\n35\n\n2.1. Every Blow of the Hammer is a Blow Against the Enemy!, propaganda poster by Viktor Deni, 1920.\n\nwhen its symbols, culture, and “look” were still nascent and very much in flux and when vast swathes of its population could not, or could barely, read. Calling the plakaty “the continuation of politics by visual means,” Klaus Waschik and Nina Baburina argue they helped to produce the unprecedented “reality” they depicted: “The poster . . . became a space in which the visual model of this civilization was created, a space which became its proving ground, its picture exhibit. Along with the illustrated children’s book, it was called upon to inculcate representations of the new society into people’s consciousness. In this sense the Soviet poster met one of the greatest communications challenges of the 20th century” (85).13 This does not mean that the process of “inculcation” flowed smoothly. For one thing, poster artists (plakatisty) had to invent novel imagery, metaphors, and slogans (or at least revamp old ones), often at a feverish pace, with little consistent guidance from above. The initial overseer of plakat production, the State Publishing House (GIZ) demanded only that artists adhere to chief principles of clarity, simplicity, directness, and accessibility14—though the vagueness of such terms led to a great diversity of styles in the early posters: realism, Suprematism, allegory, Constructivism, satire, lubok. Above all, and especially during War Communism, the leadership wanted eyecatching, compelling works that exalted the saints and demonized the enemies of the new society. The plakat, thought uniquely suited to such a task, was indeed elevated to star status among the arts. As Commissar of Education Anatoly Lunacharsky wrote in 1924: “The masters of ‘great’ art, too, not only can but must take up agitational art, for his results will often turn out not worse but better, than a master of the literary, theatrical, painting, musical, etc., agit piece. A great honor to the master painter who manages to create a vivid poster!” (quoted in Waschik and Baburina: 87). We can see the variety of artists’ responses to such calls through a comparison of some well-known early posters. Viktor Deni’s 1920 Every Blow of the Hammer is a Blow Against the Enemy! depicts a proletariat smith hammering away at an anvil; instead of “sparks” this produces bullets showering an astonished, bewhiskered man in czarist general’s dress. Deni’s work clearly follows the strategies of\n\n36\n\nHistorical Background\n\n2.2. One Must Work with a Rifle Nearby, poster by Vladimir Lebedev, 1920.\n\nthe satirical press, with its easily recognizable “types,” cartoony effects, and Manichaean worldview. Indeed, many early plakatisty simply applied the techniques of prerevolutionary caricature or redressed entire compositions to address the new Soviet conditions. Nikolai Kochergin’s 1920 Capital and Co., for example, shows a pyramidlike structure allegorizing the world economic order: priests, petty merchants, et cetera, form the bottom tier; military officers and lackeys the middle; the leering Clemenceau, Wilson, and Lloyd George near the top; and looming over all a repulsively fat Jabba the Hutt–like creature representing capital, its royal robe spread out to swathe the others. All sit on a huge pile of moneybags. “This is the bourgeoisie’s ‘icon,’” growls the accompanying poem by the proletarian poet Demian Bedny. “Here are all the pillars of their law.” Kochergin’s piece is a direct reinterpretation of Alexei Radakov’s 1917 The Autocratic Order, which puts the czar at the top of the pyramid and the proletariat (“You work!”) at the bottom. Radakov’s work, in turn, recrafts a 1901 lithograph, The Pyramid, by Nikolai Lokhov (the first Social Democrat print).15 The Soviet poster artists were tapping the familiarity of popular imagery for new goals. The avant-garde posters evince another strategy. The Leningrad artist Vladimir Lebedev’s 1920 One Must Work with a Rifle Nearby (Rabotat’ nado vintovka riadom) adheres much more to the strategies seen in the Futurist anti-books, especially in its blurring of drawing and text. The words “work” (rabotat’) and “must” (nado) follow the line of an iconic, faceless proletariat’s arm as he saws a board, a rifle intersecting it to form an X. Bright primary colors, particularly red for the worker’s shirt, identify the poster’s Suprematist leanings. The height of this approach was reached by El Lissitzky’s noted 1920 Beat the Whites with a Red Wedge, in which text and geometric shapes dynamically clash (a visual correlative to the ongoing Civil War).\n\nComics during the Soviet Era\n\n37\n\nOver time plakatisty incorporated photography in their works. Rodchenko, among other things, pioneered the use of dynamic photos for advertisements, as seen in his famous 1925 poster for the Lengiz Bookstore: the stylized word “books” (knigi) seems to burst directly from the mouth of model Lily Brik. Later, photomontage plakaty such as those of Gustav Klutsis became synonymous with the era of the first five-year plan of the late 1920s and early 1930s.16 Some series, like the agitational “poster newspapers,” combined caricature and photos. But whatever the style or technique, plakatisty relied on clearly recognizable, politically approved imagery, motifs, and character “types” such as the fat, top-hatted capitalist; the venal, often drunken priest; the stalwart worker; the emancipated woman. They also drew Lenin and other leaders. In the 1930s the exemplary “shock worker” Alexei Stakhanov became a staple of posters, as well as several other media. Viktor Deni, responsible for popularizing many of these types, captured the appeal of this strategy in his celebrated 1920 Comrade Lenin Cleanses the Earth of Scum. This shows a “cartoony” behatted Lenin astride the globe, sweeping smaller figures off the planet: a priest, a capitalist with a moneybag, and two crowned regents.17 Demonstrating its utility for different themes, Deni would reuse this “sweeping” motif during the war against rising bureaucratism, in his 1931 Red-tape Monger, Bureaucrat, Saboteur, Out of the Soviet!, which depicts the named (and labeled) parties, along with a “Loafer,” being swept out a window by a titanic pair of red hands. The stylized, allegorical economy of these works clearly derives from the satirical press. Despite their continuities with the past, the posters were theorized and celebrated as something new, and particularly Soviet. V. S. Zemenkov, writing in 1930, argued, “the compact, concrete image—this is how the Soviet poster defeats the often extreme symbolism and conventionality of the bourgeois and petty bourgeois intelligentsia’s satire” (38). Similarly, El Lissitzky contrasted the plakaty’s innovations with the Western illustrative approach (in which, he opined, image only illustrates text): “As opposed to the Americans, our posters were created not so as to be quickly caught by the eye from a rushing car, but for reading and explication up close” (57). However, Lissitzky’s celebration of the poster’s complexity (with its swipe at the West) clashed with the view of a poster production official, who in 1931 wrote, “the eye of the peasant finds it easiest to comprehend the lubok and gets lost in the details of the usual ‘city’ poster” (Bonnell: 111). Whatever the innovations of the Civil War–era plakatisty, it is telling that their White opponents resorted to much the same techniques: clear, eye-grabbing imagery, a communication of the urgency of victory, and demonization of the Reds. White posters depicted their enemies as reptiles, sadistic brutes, and trolls. An anti-Semitic 1919 poster, Peace and Freedom in Sovdepya, capitalizes on the widespread belief that the Communists were a power-hungry Jewish cabal. The unknown artist shows Leon Trotsky, at that time head of the Red army, as\n\n38\n\nHistorical Background\n\na mammoth red devil wearing spectacles and a gold chain with a red star shaped like the Star of David. He (it) sits atop the Kremlin walls, dripping blood from its hands and feet, overseeing a mountain of skulls as Chinese troops execute a prisoner and shovel remains. Others proved no less direct: Retribution (1918–1920) depicts Lenin and his followers being driven by an archangel and the White army down to the pit of hell. A central composition shows a cavern in flames, where the Communists cower before demons, a huge snake-like monster, and an enthroned Satan. The bottom tier shows five panels of varied tortures, for “lies,” “betrayal,” and so forth. In its religious iconography and form the poster recalls the hagiographic icon, as well as the three-tiered narrative approach of the Novgorod school’s Icon of the Battle Between the Men of Novgorod and the Men of Suzdal (mentioned in the previous chapter). In addition, the artist makes use of a well-known lubok motif, the humorous, semi-sadistic depiction of hell’s torments as punishment for a life badly lived; see, for example the 1882 poster Drunkenness and its Horrible Consequences, in which the anonymous artist shows a drunkard carousing and trouble making for eight panels before landing at the center of the composition, in a fiery cave very similar to that which greets Lenin’s entourage. Of whichever political stripe, in short, plakatisty made use of the poster’s iconographic economy and visual impact to great effect. Of particular interest to comics scholars, however, is to what extent these artists participated in and invoked a comics language (particularly sequentiality) in crafting their works and to what degree a viewer relied on a grasp of this language to understand and appreciate their message. The answer is: from the Soviet plakat’s beginnings the use of recognizable comics devices—chief among them the use of multiple panels for contrast or narrative development—was a standard part of the poster maker’s toolbox. Clearly an inheritance of the Old Believer icon, lubok, and satirical press, the comparative or “transformational” potential of the gutter was routinely exploited for “us/them,” “then/now,” and other ideological point scoring effects. Moor’s 1919 The Czarist Regiments and the Red Army exemplifies this formula: on the left panel (caption: “What they fought for before”), a detachment of White soldiers defend fat capitalists with moneybags, the enthroned sovereign, a crossthumping priest, and banners proclaiming “slavery,” “pogroms,” and other evils. On the right panel (“What they’re fighting for now”): army men, sailors, and ordinary peasants march forward, while in the distance behind them loom factories, modern buildings, a multi-hued sun, and flags declaring “Freedom,” “Bread,” “Emancipated Labor,” “Science,” and so forth. An antireligious 1925 poster Kopeck by kopeck . . . by Dmitry Melnikov utilizes the gutter for a similar contrast. The top caption reads: “Kopeck by kopeck the church took from the peasantry its trappings—gold and silver,” over an image of a circular fortress-like city with a church at its center, “open for business,” as peasants crowd in and around to make\n\nComics during the Soviet Era\n\n39\n\n2.3. 1917–1920, poster by unknown artist from Gomel, 1920.\n\ntheir humble offerings. The bottom panel shows the fortress now closed, blackrobed priests ringed around the church full of treasure, as peasants slowly starve outside the walls. The lower caption reads: “Why have you become a black camp? Everyone must give to the peasants, who are dying of hunger.” Other uses of the gutter proved more “aspirational” or “transfigurative,” as seen in a 1920 work by an unknown artist from Gomel. On the left panel, with the year 1917 over it, appears a tiny striding worker carrying a rifle, a sledgehammer, and a red banner. Towering over him, reaching up to the very clouds, are the White generals Kornilov, Kaledin, and Dutov. The next panel, with the year 1920 over it, shows the worker grown enormous, so that he now dwarves the Whites and unceremoniously kicks them out of frame. “Long live the power of the Soviets!” his banner proclaims. The poster demonstrates a deep understanding of the gutter’s transformative nature, as directly over the interpanel space, the artist has placed the hyphen—the linguistic mark that signifies the proletariat’s meteoric evolution from the years 1917 to 1920. It is almost as if the gutter itself represents a third “panel” with its own caption; like the hyphen, the white space denotes “change.” At the same time, another aspect of this poster represents a departure from most Western comics conventions, at least of dialogue. The words “Death to [White general] Vrangel” seem to emanate from the vanquished generals as they abandon the scene. It makes no sense, of course, for the Whites to disparage one of their own; the declamation is clearly meant as an additional agitational message by the plakatist. But the placement of the message (below the huge worker’s boot, as if he will stomp on it) and the stylized letters (“receding” toward the enemy) muddles the delivery for most modern readers, who would probably take it as dialogue from the generals. Another striking divergence, in this case from the usual “left-right” direction of reading, appears in a 1919 work from another unknown artist, from Petrograd. Written across the top portion of a two-panel composition, the message declares,\n\n40\n\nHistorical Background\n\n“Worker! Only by breaking the chains of darkness will you come to socialism.” An iconic sun also extends across both panels, blazing bright in one, obscured by clouds in the other. But the arrangement of the action is not what most contemporary Western readers would expect: the worker, along with his family, greets the sun in the left or “first” panel, while in the “second,” right-hand panel, he languishes alone in chains. Strictly speaking, this order reverses and contradicts that of the written message.18 However elaborated, the “cross-gutter split reality” technique was employed from the time of the Civil War and remained part of the propaganda arsenal, deployed for various uses, through seven decades of Communist rule. (And as we shall see, it was not limited to posters.) The “enemy”—Whites, illiteracy, the capitalist West—would change, but the approach remained consistent. Waschik and Baburina relate the device, in fact, to a distinctly Russian “bipolar” view of the world: “As a fundamental way of thinking, in which one’s own positive qualities (pozitivnost’) are demonstrated through a direct comparison with negative alternatives (one’s own defects, the world of capital, etc.), it offers insight into the ways of self-identification in the Soviet utopia: by distancing oneself from the other (capitalist) world and entering one of ideal, exemplary and indistinct forms, in the final analysis one is forced, through the poster’s confrontation with this world, into a position of perpetually searching for proof and comparisons” (185).19 It bears repeating, however, that such approaches were not confined to the Soviets. For example, the White poster What Did the Bolsheviks Promise the People, and What Did They Deliver? (1920) provides not one comparison, but three. To appropriate illustrations arranged in three tiers of two panels each, the captions read: “They promised freedom . . . they gave executions. They promised bread . . . they gave famine. They promised order and a peaceful life . . . they gave war.” As this and some of the previously mentioned works show, plakatisty all along the political spectrum had mastered another important principle of the multipanel composition: its ability to convey narratival action, even on a very “micro” level (i.e., McCloud’s “moment-to-moment” transitions). In short, they applied the sequential capacities of the form toward storytelling. Again, Moor provides a striking example: his 1925 The Soviet Turnip unfolds over five descending, plakat-wide panels, as a group of humorously drawn counterrevolutionary figures (and their pets) strive to pull a turnip out of the ground. Their great efforts (they form a tug-of-war line, as a hare, a frog, and a crow look on) receive a cruel reward: in the last panel the mammoth head of a Red army soldier, wearing a budyonovka or peaked hat (the “turnip”), emerges from the earth and blows them away with his breath: “They all flew away, hard did they fall / The Soviet turnip had punished them all.” Moor and other artists in the first decade of the Soviet experiment routinely used such sequential techniques to depict both “momentary” actions (the unmasking of an enemy, the production of goods) and\n\nComics during the Soviet Era\n\n41\n\n2.4.

A good example of the latter: Radakov’s 1920 The Life of the Illiterate / The Life of the Literate, which uses two tiers of four panels each, with captions, to contrast the alternate paths and very different fates of its two heroes (the first suffers numerous tragedies, the second succeeds in life and dies contented). Another use of this progressive panel technique, in There is the Metro! (Est’ metro!, 1935), dispenses with conventional narrative altogether in favor of a more baldly ideological message. The photomontage by Deni and Dolgorukov, celebrating the 1934 construction of the Moscow subway, unspools over three tiers, and opens with the bombastic line “There are no fortresses which the Bolsheviks could not capture” across the top. The first and third panels’ “establishing shots” show views of Moscow buildings. Overlaid on these panels, dominating them, is a snapshot of Joseph Stalin; the montage juxtaposition leads to the implication that Stalin is somehow responsible for that cityscape—it “emanates” from him. The second tier, made up of one large panel, shows a map of the city over which strides a mass of people at a sharp diagonal (they seem to pour forth out of the third panel above). The first metro line, in bright red, stretches over the map. One man holds a banner proclaiming, “Long live our great Stalin!” Another man, who looks somewhat like Stalin, leads the people as this tier’s largest figure; this gives the impression that the great leader has “descended” from his lofty, totemic position in the first tier to walk among his subjects. Finally, the final tier—the most dynamic—first shows a shot of a dark tunnel, followed by another panel of a metro train (the train has “burst forth” from the tunnel). The finale: the bright-red message “There is the Metro!” glares over two panels depicting a station escalator and the exterior of the new station. As I have tried to show by this lengthy exegesis, the poster is quite complex in its unfolding, its design building up a remarkable anticipation which its climax\n\n42\n\nHistorical Background\n\nrelieves. The semiotics of the work lead to an indisputable ideological conclusion: the great civilization of Bolshevism, made possible by the god-like benefactor and father figure Stalin, has led to this exciting scientific and cultural achievement. The poster is a stirring relic of the triumphalist 1"
