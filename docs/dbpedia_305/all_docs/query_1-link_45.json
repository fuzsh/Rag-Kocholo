        "text": "The Monte Carlo event generator DPMJET-III\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nRoesler, S.; Engel, R.\n\n2001-01-01\n\nA new version of the Monte Carlo event generator DPMJET is presented. It is a code system based on the Dual Parton Model and unifies all features of the DTUNUC-2, DPMJET-II and PHOJET1.12 event generators. DPMJET-III allows the simulation of hadron-hadron, hadron-nucleus, nucleus-nucleus, photon-hadron, photon-photon and photon-nucleus interactions from a few GeV up to the highest cosmic ray energies. (orig.)\n\nMonte-Carlo event generation for the LHC\n\nCERN Document Server\n\nSiegert, Frank\n\nThis thesis discusses recent developments for the simulation of particle physics in the light of the start-up of the Large Hadron Collider. Simulation programs for fully exclusive events, dubbed Monte-Carlo event generators, are improved in areas related to the perturbative as well as non-perturbative regions of strong interactions. A short introduction to the main principles of event generation is given to serve as a basis for the following discussion. An existing algorithm for the correction of parton-shower emissions with the help of exact tree-level matrix elements is revisited and significantly improved as attested by first results. In a next step, an automated implementation of the POWHEG method is presented. It allows for the combination of parton showers with full next-to-leading order QCD calculations and has been tested in several processes. These two methods are then combined into a more powerful framework which allows to correct a parton shower with full next-to-leading order matrix elements and h...\n\nValidation of Monte Carlo event generators in the ATLAS Collaboration for LHC Run 2\n\nCERN Document Server\n\nThe ATLAS collaboration\n\n2016-01-01\n\nThis note reviews the main steps followed by the ATLAS Collaboration to validate the properties of particle-level simulated events from Monte Carlo event generators in order to ensure the correctness of all event generator configurations and production samples used in physics analyses. A central validation procedure is adopted which permits the continual validation of the functionality and the performance of the ATLAS event simulation infrastructure. Revisions and updates of the Monte Carlo event generators are also monitored. The methodology behind the validation and tools developed for that purpose, as well as various usage cases, are presented. The strategy has proven to play an essential role in identifying possible problems or unwanted features within a restricted timescale, verifying their origin and pointing to possible bug fixes before full-scale processing is initiated.\n\nA Monte Carlo study on event-by-event transverse momentum fluctuation at RHIC\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nXu Mingmei\n\n2005-01-01\n\nThe experimental observation on the multiplicity dependence of event-by-event transverse momentum fluctuation in relativistic heavy ion collisions is studied using Monte Carlo simulation. It is found that the Monte Carlo generator HIJING is unable to describe the experimental phenomenon well. A simple Monte Carlo model is proposed, which can recover the data and thus shed some light on the dynamical origin of the multiplicity dependence of event-by-event transverse momentum fluctuation.

The concept of formation zone and the cascade interactions of secondary particles are properly taken into account in this Monte Carlo code. Comparing the results of this code with experimental data, the importance of intranuclear cascade interactions becomes very clear.

The high efficiency of the MC, that is small maximum weight or variance of the MC weight is achieved by means of dividing the integration domain into small cells. The cells can be $n$-dimensional simplices, hyperrectangles or Cartesian product of them. The grid of cells, called ``foam'', is produced in the process of the binary split of the cells. The choice of the next cell to be divided and the position/direction of the division hyper-plane is driven by the algorithm which optimizes the ratio of the maximum weight to the average weight or (optionally) the total variance. The algorithm is able to deal, in principle, with an arbitrary pattern of the singularities in the distribution. As any MC generator, it can also be used for the MC integration. With the typical personal computer CPU, the program is able to perform adaptive integration/simulation at relatively small number of dimensions ($\\\\leq 16$). With the continu...\n\nWINHAC - the Monte Carlo event generator for single W-boson production in hadronic collisions\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nPlaczek, W.; Jadach, P.\n\n2009-01-01\n\nThe charged-current Drell-Yan process, i.e. single W-boson production with leptonic decays in hadronic collisions, will play an important role in the experimental programme at the LHC. It will be used for improved measurements of some Standard Model parameters (such as the W-boson mass and widths, etc.), for better determination of the Higgs-boson mass limits, in '' new physics '' searches, as a '' standard candle '' process, etc. In order to achieve all these goals, precise theoretical predictions for this process in terms of a Monte Carlo event generator are indispensable. In this talk the Monte Carlo event generator WINHAC for the charged-current Drell-Yan process will be presented. It features higher-order QED corrections within the exclusive Yennie-Frautschi-Suura exponentiation scheme with the 1 st order electroweak corrections. It is interfaced with PYTHIA for QCD/QED initial-state parton shower as well as hadronization. It includes options for proton-proton, proton-antiproton and nucleus-nucleus collisions. Moreover, it allows for longitudinally and transversely polarized W-boson production. It has been cross-checked numerically to high precision against independent programs/calculations. Some numerical results from WINHAC will also be presented. Finally, interplay between QCD and electroweak effects will briefly be discussed.

The main purpose of the LCG MCDB project is to provide a storage and documentation system for sophisticated event samples simulated for the LHC collaborations by experts. In many cases, the modern Monte Carlo simulation of physical processes requires expert knowledge in Monte Carlo generators or significant amount of CPU time to produce the events. MCDB is a knowledgebase mainly to accumulate simulated events of this type. The main motivation behind LCG MCDB is to make the sophisticated MC event samples available for various physical groups. All the data from MCDB is accessible in several convenient ways. LCG MCDB is being developed within the CERN LCG Application Area Simulation project.\n\nReport on the work of the 'Monte Carlo Event Generation' subgroup\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nAbe, K.\n\n1981-01-01\n\nThe work of the Monte Carlo Event Generation includes the preparation of programs, jet simulation, track generation in chambers, and the pattern recognition of tracks and track fitting. Some general results from the jet simulation by Ali et al. are given. The total energy used was 60 GeV, and the top quark mass was assumed to be 25 GeV. The multiplicity of charged particles and photons is shown. The multiplicity increased with the number of jets. The energy spectra and the trajectories of charged particles and photons were obtained. The distribution of the opening angle of any two photons is also presented. The track generation program used is GEANT from CERN. This program was adapted to the KEK computer. Pattern recognition and track fitting are based on the tracking device. The program considered was that by DELCO group at SLAC. The tracking device consists of a MWPC and a cylindrical drift chamber with wires along the beam direction Z and wires inclined at a stereo angle. Some comments on vertex detectors are given. (Kato, T.)\n\nAn object-oriented framework for the hadronic Monte-Carlo event generators\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nAmelin, N.; Komogorov, M.\n\n1999-01-01\n\nWe advocate the development of an object-oriented framework for the hadronic Monte-Carlo (MC) event generators. The hadronic MC user and developer requirements are discussed as well as the hadronic model commonalities. It is argued that the development of a framework is in favour of taking into account of model commonalities since common means are stable and can be developed only at once. Such framework can provide different possibilities to have user session more convenient and productive, e.g., an easy access and edition of any model parameter, substitution of the model components by the alternative model components without changing the code, customized output, which offers either full information about history of generated event or specific information about reaction final state, etc. Such framework can indeed increase the productivity of a hadronic model developer, particularly, due to the formalization of the hadronic model component structure and model component collaborations. The framework based on the component approach opens a way to organize a library of the hadronic model components, which can be considered as the pool of hadronic model building blocks. Basic features, code structure and working examples of the first framework version for the hadronic MC models, which has been built as the starting point, are shortly explained\n\nInvestigation of the influence of nuclear matter on hard neutrino nucleus interaction using the HARDPING Monte Carlo Event Generator\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nBerdnikov, Ya.A.; Berdnikov, A.Ya.; Kim, V.T.; Ivanov, A.E.; Suetin, D.P.; Tiangov, K.D.\n\n2016-01-01\n\nHadron production in neutrino-nucleus interactions is implemented in Monte Carlo event generator HARDPING (HARD Probe INteraction Generator). Such effects as formation length, energy loss and multiple rescattering for produced hadrons and their constituents are taken into account in HARDPING. Available data from WA/59 and SCAT collaborations on hadron production in neutrino-nucleus collisions is described by HARDPING with a reasonable agreement\n\nMonte Carlo generator ELRADGEN 2.0 for simulation of radiative events in elastic ep-scattering of polarized particles\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nAkushevich, I.; Filoti, O. F.; Ilyichev, A.; Shumeiko, N.\n\n2012-07-01\n\nThe structure and algorithms of the Monte Carlo generator ELRADGEN 2.0 designed to simulate radiative events in polarized ep-scattering are presented. The full set of analytical expressions for the QED radiative corrections is presented and discussed in detail. Algorithmic improvements implemented to provide faster simulation of hard real photon events are described. Numerical tests show high quality of generation of photonic variables and radiatively corrected cross section. The comparison of the elastic radiative tail simulated within the kinematical conditions of the BLAST experiment at MIT BATES shows a good agreement with experimental data.

A single high pT track is selected, and the distribution of other tracks in the event is evaluated relative to this reference track. The evolution of the charged momentum flow in the rest of the event, as a function of the pT of the reference track, gives important information about the transition from minimum bias event structure to the full underlying event observed in high-pT collision events. Results are presented after correction and unfolding of detector effects to allow simpler comparison to Monte Carlo models. In addition, the PYTHIA Monte Carlo generator has been tuned to ATLAS measurements at 900 GeV and 7 TeV. Standard distributions from Minimum Bias events, as well as the Underlying Event studies are included in the first tunes to ATLAS measurements at the LHC. The tunes aim for one consistent description of the new measurements as well as data from the Tevatron and...\n\nMonte Carlo event generators in atomic collisions: A new tool to tackle the few-body dynamics\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nCiappina, M. F.; Kirchner, T.; Schulz, M.\n\n2010-04-01\n\nWe present a set of routines to produce theoretical event files, for both single and double ionization of atoms by ion impact, based on a Monte Carlo event generator (MCEG) scheme. Such event files are the theoretical counterpart of the data obtained from a kinematically complete experiment; i.e. they contain the momentum components of all collision fragments for a large number of ionization events. Among the advantages of working with theoretical event files is the possibility to incorporate the conditions present in a real experiment, such as the uncertainties in the measured quantities. Additionally, by manipulating them it is possible to generate any type of cross sections, specially those that are usually too complicated to compute with conventional methods due to a lack of symmetry. Consequently, the numerical effort of such calculations is dramatically reduced. We show examples for both single and double ionization, with special emphasis on a new data analysis tool, called four-body Dalitz plots, developed very recently.

Many extensions from HEPEVT, the Fortran HEP standard, are supported: the number of entries is unlimited, spin density matrices can be stored with each vertex, flow patterns (such as colour) can be stored and traced, random number generator states can be stored, and an arbitrary number of event weights can be included. Particles and vertices are stored separately in a graph structure, reflecting the evolution of a physics event. The added information supports the modularisation of event generators. The event record has been kept as simple as possible with minimal internal/external dependencies. Event information is accessed by means of iterators supplied with HepMC.\n\nThe CCFM Monte Carlo generator CASCADE Version 2.2.03\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nJung, H.; Baranov, S.; Deak, M.; Grebenyuk, A.; Hentschinski, M.; Knutsson, A.; Kraemer, M.; Hautmann, F.; Kutak, K.; Lipatov, A.; Zotov, N.\n\n2010-01-01\n\nCascade is a full hadron level Monte Carlo event generator for ep, Î³p and p anti p and pp processes, which uses the CCFM evolution equation for the initial state cascade in a backward evolution approach supplemented with off-shell matrix elements for the hard scattering.

Monte Carlo programs for processes such as this frequently generate events with negative weights in certain regions of phase space. For simulations of experimental data one would like to have unweighted events only. We demonstrate how the phase space from the matrix elements can be combined to achieve unweighted event generation using a second stage Monte Carlo integration over a volume of real emissions (jets). Observable quantities are kept fixed in the laboratory frame throughout the integration. The algorithm is applicable to a broader class of processes and is CPU intensive.\n\nAcademic Training: Monte Carlo generators for the LHC\n\nCERN Multimedia\n\nFranÃ§oise Benz\n\n2005-01-01\n\n2004-2005 ACADEMIC TRAINING PROGRAMME LECTURE SERIES 4, 5, 6, 7 April from 11.00 to 12.00 hrs - Main Auditorium, bldg. 500 Monte Carlo generators for the LHC T. SJOSTRAND / CERN-PH, Lund Univ. SE Event generators today are indispensable as tools for the modelling of complex physics processes, that jointly lead to the production of hundreds of particles per event at LHC energies. Generators are used to set detector requirements, to formulate analysis strategies, or to calculate acceptance corrections. These lectures describe the physics that goes into the construction of an event generator, such as hard processes, initial- and final-state radiation, multiple interactions and beam remnants, hadronization and decays, and how these pieces come together. The current main generators are introduced, and are used to illustrate uncertainties in the physics modelling. Some trends for the future are outlined.

A procedure based on this scheme and subsequent structure relaxations using molecular dynamics is described and validated. Using the proposed scheme and the corresponding procedure, atomistic models of amorphous PANI-HCl structures were generated and studied at different doping levels. Density, structure factors, and solubility parameters were calculated. Their values agree well with available experimental data. The interactions of HCl with PANI have been studied and distribution of their energies has been analyzed. The procedure has also been extended to the generation of PANI models including adsorbed water and the effect of inclusion of water molecules on PANI properties has also been modeled and discussed. The protocol described here is general and the proposed United Event Grand Canonical Monte Carlo scheme can be easily extended to similar polymeric materials used in gas sensing and to other systems involving adsorption and chemical reactions steps.\n\nImplementation of the n-body Monte-Carlo event generator into the Geant4 toolkit for photonuclear studies\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nLuo, Wen, E-mail: wenluo-ok@163.com [School of Nuclear Science and Technology, University of South China, Hengyang 421001 (China); Lan, Hao-yang [School of Nuclear Science and Technology, University of South China, Hengyang 421001 (China); Xu, Yi; Balabanski, Dimiter L.

New tunes have been produced for these generators, making maximal use of available published data from ATLAS and from the Tevatron and LEP experiments. Particular emphasis has been placed on improvement of the description of e+ eâ event shape and jet rate data, and on description of hadron collider event shape observables in Pythia, as well as the established procedure of tuning the multiple parton interactions of both models to describe underlying event and minimum bias data. The tuning of Pythia is provided at this time for the MRST LOââ PDF, while the purely MPI tune of Herwig/Jimmy is performed for ten different PDFs.\n\nGeneral-purpose event generators for LHC physics\n\nCERN Document Server\n\nBuckley, Andy; Gieseke, Stefan; Grellscheid, David; Hoche, Stefan; Hoeth, Hendrik; Krauss, Frank; Lonnblad, Leif; Nurse, Emily; Richardson, Peter; Schumann, Steffen; Seymour, Michael H.; Sjostrand, Torbjorn; Skands, Peter; Webber, Bryan\n\n2011-01-01\n\nWe review the physics basis, main features and use of general-purpose Monte Carlo event generators for the simulation of proton-proton collisions at the Large Hadron Collider.

A Monte Carlo study\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nEkspong, G.; Hultqvist, K.\n\n1982-06-01\n\nHiggs boson production at LEP using e+ e- to Z 0 to H 0 + e+ e- has been studied by Monte Carlo generation of events with realistic errors of measurement added. The results show the recoil mass (Higgs boson mass) resolution to be reasonably good for boson masses bigger than 5 Ge V. The events are found to populate a phase space region free of physical background for all boson masses below about 35 GeV. For masses above 40 GeV the Higgs boson signal merges with the physical background produced by semileptonic decays of heavy flavour quarks while diminishing in strength to low levels. The geometrical acceptance of a detector like DELPHI is about 80 per cent for Higgs boson events.

This program generates events based on the standard model, i.e., quantum chromodynamics (QCD) and electro-weak theory. It works at the center-of-mass energy below W + W - production, i.e., in the energy region of TRISTAN, SLC and LEP. For these high energy machines one of the important subjects is the exploration for the top quark. The production and hadronization of the top quark is included in EPOCS. Besides the top quark, we expect 'new' physics in this high energy region. EPOCS has enough flexibility for users to cope with a new idea. Users can register a new particle, modify the built-in particle data, define new primary interactions and so on. The event generator has a number of parameters, both physical parameters and control parameters. Users can control most of these parameters in EPOCS at will.

The interesting but difficult phenomenology of supersymmetric models at the upcoming colliders demands a corresponding complexity and maturity from simulation tools. This includes multi-particle final states, reducible and irreducible backgrounds, spin correlations, real emission of photons and gluons, etc., which are incorporated in the programs presented here. The framework of a model with such a huge particle content and as complicated as the MSSM makes strenuous tests and comparison of codes inevitable. Various tests show agreement among the three different programs; the tables of cross sections produced in these tests may serve as a future reference for other codes. Furthermore, first MSSM physics analyses performed with these programs are presented here.

Part I of this thesis concentrates on the calculations of cross sections at tree level. A number of extensions have been implemented in the matrix element generator AMEGIC++, namely new interaction models such as effective loop-induced couplings of the Higgs boson with massless gauge bosons, required for a number of channels for the Higgs boson search at LHC and anomalous gauge couplings, parameterizing a number of models beyond th SM. Further a special treatment to deal with complicated decay chains of heavy particles has been constructed. A significant effort went into the implementation of methods to push the limits on particle multiplicities. Two recursive methods have been implemented, the Cachazo-Svrcek-Witten recursion and the colour dressed Berends-Giele recursion. For the latter the new module COMIX has been added to the SHERPA framework. The Monte-Carlo phase space integration techniques have been completely revised, which led to significantly reduced statistical error estimates when calculating cross sections and a greatly improved unweighting efficiency for the event generation. Special integration methods have been developed to cope with the newly accessible final states. The event generation framework SHERPA directly benefits from those new developments, improving the precision and the efficiency. Part II was addressed to the automation of QCD calculations at next-to-leading order. A code has been developed, that, for the first time fully automates the real correction part of a NLO calculation.

The goal of the project is to develop a 'canonical' neutrino interaction physics Monte Carlo whose validity extends to all nuclear targets and neutrino flavors from MeV to PeV energy scales. Currently, emphasis is on the few-GeV energy range, the challenging boundary between the non-perturbative and perturbative regimes, which is relevant for the current and near future long-baseline precision neutrino experiments using accelerator-made beams. The design of the package addresses many challenges unique to neutrino simulations and supports the full life-cycle of simulation and generator-related analysis tasks. GENIE is a large-scale software system, consisting of â¼120000 lines of C++ code, featuring a modern object-oriented design and extensively validated physics content. The first official physics release of GENIE was made available in August 2007, and at the time of the writing of this article, the latest available version was v2.4.4.\n\nHerwig: The Evolution of a Monte Carlo Simulation\n\nCERN Multimedia\n\nCERN.

The algorithm for the generator is one of an incident particle on a target of uniformly distributed nucleons. The dynamics of the interaction limit secondary interactions in that only the leading baryon may re-interact with the nuclear volume.

A pseudo-random number has its own period depending on its generation method and the period is desired to be long enough not to exceed the period during one Monte Carlo calculation to ensure the correctness especially for a standard deviation of results. The linear congruential generator (LCG) is widely used as Monte Carlo RNG and the period of LCG is not so long by considering the increasing rate of simulation histories in a Monte Carlo calculation according to the remarkable enhancement of computer performance. Recently, many kinds of RNG have been developed and some of their features are better than those of LCG. In this study, we investigate the appropriate RNG in a Monte Carlo code as an alternative to LCG especially for the case of enormous histories. It is found that xorshift has desirable features compared with LCG, and xorshift has a larger period, a comparable speed to generate random numbers, a better randomness, and good applicability to parallel calculation.

One of the main challenges still remaining is the extraction of the parton distribution functions, generalized to describe transverse momentum and spatial distributions of partons from these observables with no or minimal model dependence. In this topical review we present the latest developments in the field with emphasis on requirements for Monte Carlo event generators, indispensable for studies of the complex 3D nucleon structure, and discuss examples of possible applications.\n\nEvent generator tunes obtained from underlying event and multiparton scattering measurements\n\nCERN Document Server\n\nKhachatryan, Vardan;

Combined fits to CMS UE data at $\\\\sqrt{s} =$ 7 TeV and to UE data from the CDF experiment at lower $\\\\sqrt{s}$, are used to study the UE models and constrain their parameters, providing thereby improved predictions for proton-proton collisions at 13 TeV. In addition, it is investigated whether the values of the parameters obtained from fits to UE observables are consistent with the values determined from fitting observables sensitive to double-parton scattering processes. Finally, comparisons of the UE tunes to ``minimum bias'' (MB) events, multijet, and Drell--Yan ($ \\\\mathrm{ q \\\\bar{q} } \\\\rightarrow \\\\mathrm{Z} / \\\\gamma^* \\\\rightarrow$ lepton-antilepton + jets) observables at 7 and 8 TeV are presented, as well as predictions of MB and UE observables at 13 TeV.\n\nRare event simulation using Monte Carlo methods\n\nCERN Document Server\n\nRubino, Gerardo\n\n2009-01-01\n\nIn a probabilistic model, a rare event is an event with a very small probability of occurrence. The forecasting of rare events is a formidable task but is important in many areas. For instance a catastrophic failure in a transport system or in a nuclear power plant, the failure of an information processing system in a bank, or in the communication network of a group of banks, leading to financial losses. Being able to evaluate the probability of rare events is therefore a critical issue. Monte Carlo Methods, the simulation of corresponding models, are used to analyze rare events. This book sets out to present the mathematical tools available for the efficient simulation of rare events. Importance sampling and splitting are presented along with an exposition of how to apply these tools to a variety of fields ranging from performance and dependability evaluation of complex systems, typically in computer science or in telecommunications, to chemical reaction analysis in biology or particle transport in physics. ...\n\nNew approach to parton shower Monte Carlo event generators for precision QCD theory: HERWIRI1.0(31)\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nJoseph, S.; Ward, B. F. L.; Majhi, S.; Yost, S. A.\n\n2010-01-01\n\nBy implementing the new IR-improved Dokshitzer-Gribov-Lipatov-Altarelli-Parisi-Callan-Symanzik (DGLAP-CS) kernels recently developed by one of us in the HERWIG6.5 environment we generate a new Monte Carlo (MC), HERWIRI1.0(31), for hadron-hadron scattering at high energies. We use MC data to illustrate the comparison between the parton shower generated by the standard DGLAP-CS kernels and that generated by the new IR-improved DGLAP-CS kernels. The interface to MC-NLO, MC-NLO/HERWIRI, is illustrated. Comparisons with FNAL data and some discussion of possible implications for LHC phenomenology are also presented.\n\nMonte Carlo: Basics\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nMurthy, K. P. N.\n\n2001-01-01\n\nAn introduction to the basics of Monte Carlo is given. The topics covered include, sample space, events, probabilities, random variables, mean, variance, covariance, characteristic function, chebyshev inequality, law of large numbers, central limit theorem (stable distribution, Levy distribution), random numbers (generation and testing), random sampling techniques (inversion, rejection, sampling from a Gaussian, Metropolis sampling), analogue Monte Carlo and Importance sampling (exponential b...\n\nA study of charm quark production in the NOMAD event generator\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nBoyd, S.\n\n1995-01-01\n\nAlthough constructed primarily to aid in the search for neutrino oscillations, NOMAD, a counter experiment exposed to a Î½ m beam at the CERN SPS, is capable of making significant contributions to the study of charm quark production in Î½ m Deep Inelastic Scattering (DIS) processes. The analysis of such events, however, is dependent upon Monte Carlo simulations of the event kinematics and hence it is essential to understand the behaviour of such simulations. This talk compares data on charm production in the dimuon channel generated by the NOMAD Event Generator (NEGLIB) for an anti-neutrino beam with data collected in the CDHS experiment which ran at CERN in the period 1977-1980. Overall the two sets of data compare well, although some marked differences are observed. Several possible reasons are proposed and discussed\n\nElegentâAn elastic event generator\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nKaÅ¡par, J.\n\n2014-03-01\n\nAlthough elastic scattering of nucleons may look like a simple process, it presents a long-lasting challenge for theory. Due to missing hard energy scale, the perturbative QCD cannot be applied. Instead, many phenomenological/theoretical models have emerged. In this paper we present a unified implementation of some of the most prominent models in a C++ library, moreover extended to account for effects of the electromagnetic interaction. The library is complemented with a number of utilities. For instance, programs to sample many distributions of interest in four-momentum transfer squared, t, impact parameter, b, and collision energy â{s}. These distributions at ISR, SppÂ¯S, RHIC, Tevatron and LHC energies are available for download from the project web site. Both in the form of ROOT files and PDF figures providing comparisons among the models. The package includes also a tool for Monte-Carlo generation of elastic scattering events, which can easily be embedded in any other program framework.
