        "text": "11th – Born on this day in 1884 in Rio de Janeiro was Olympic shooter Demerval Peixoto. He represented Brazil at the 1920 Games in Antwerp, which were the first that Brazil had entered and shooting was to be the flagship event for them. Peixoto was one of 21 men who travelled to Antwerp, a city still suffering the ravages of WWII which had ended just two short years earlier. Four years before the games he was fighting in the Contesado War. Their journey to Antwerp was very precariousness, they travelled third class, in small, airless cabins – so uncomfortable were the athletes that they decided to sleep on the floor of the bar instead, not getting to rest until the last customer left and them waking up early to train on the deck before other passengers woke. They journeyed to Lisbon, from where they had to proceed by train to Belgium, having been informed that the ship would not reach Antwerp in time to participate in the exams. The train was an open train, open to all the elements, after a 27-day trip, on their connection in Brussels, their weapons for the Olympics were variously stolen or seized by border guards, the story is not altogether that clear and there are many versions – however the fact is that the team arrived in Antwerp without their sport equipment, extremely hungry and in very low spirits. The American team, impressed at the fortitude of the Brazils while at the same time appalled by their situation, lent them guns and ammunition – modern and especially manufactured by Colt for the Games. The Brazilians proceeded to defeat their benefactors, with team member Guilherme Paraense claiming the first ever Brazilian Olympic Gold medal in the Individual 30m Pistol and the team taking Bronze in the 50m.

During the Second World War German occupation of Norway, Røgeberg was arrested by the Germans in May 1942 on weapons related charges.

In 1995 he was inducted into the National Skeet Shooting Association Hall of Fame.\n\nBorn on this day in 1960, Italian sharp shooter Roberta Pelosi. She was selected to compete for Italy at the 2004 Olympics, and established a career tally of eighteen medals in a major international competition, including a world-record breaking gold at the 1998 ISSF World Cup meet in Cairo, and a silver in women’s trap at the 2003 World Shotgun Championships in Nicosia, Cyprus. Pelosi is a member of Valle Aniene Target Shooting Club and a resident athlete of the Italian Clay Shooting Federation, where she trained under head coach and 1996 Olympic double trap medallist Albano Pera.

On leaving Cheltenham College, Neame went to the RMA Woolwich and was commissioned into the Royal Engineers in 1908 which marked the start of an outstanding military career. In December1914 he won the Victoria Cross at Neuve Chappelle, two years later he was awarded DSO and after filling various commands with distinction attained the rank of lieutenant general in 1940. He was knighted in 1946, while serving as Lieutenant-Governor of Guernsey from 1945-53. Neame was a fine all-round sportsman, his interest embracing not only target shooting but also hockey, mountaineering, polo, hunting, skiing and big game shooting. None of these sports made excessive demands on his time to be the detriment of the others and he looked on each strictly as a pastime. In fact, his autobiography, which he wrote in captivity before escaping from an Italian prisoner of war camp, reveals that at the 1924 Olympic Games he was under the impression that he was representing the British Empire rather than Great Britain. Unlike his teammates in the running deer, double shot, team event, who defeated Norway by a single point, Neame did not take part in any other event at the Paris Olympics but he has the distinction of being the only man to win an Olympic gold medal and be awarded the Victoria Cross. Neame was a versatile shot and represented the Army in both revolver and rifle competitions. Although overseas postings meant that his appearances at Bisley were spasmodic, he reached the Kings final in 1929. Like many other Olympians, it was a love of sport that led Philip Neame into marriage but the particular circumstance of his meeting his future wife are not entirely common – after being badly mauled by a tiger while big game hunting in India he married Miss Alberta Drew, who nursed him in the hospital. He later served as Lieutenant Governor of Guernsey from 1945 to 1953. His achievement of being a recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces, and the winner of an Olympic Gold medal, make him the only person to attain both distinctions.\n\nBorn today in 1900, Itlatian shooter Luigi Adami, who competed in the 50m rifle event at the 1948 Olympics.\n\nVasily Borisov, soviet rifle-shooter was born in 1922.
