Here's the first\n\nafter a week's absence...\n\nUK drinks body bans ``alcohol energises'' claims\n\nLONDON, July 5 (Reuters) - Britain's brewers and distillers were told on\n\nWednesday to stop claiming on their packaging that their products boost mental\n\nor physical performance.\n\nThe call came from the Portman Group, a body funded by Allied Domecq Plc,\n\nDiageo Plc and other big drinks firms, which aims to encourage responsible\n\nmarketing of alcoholic drinks through self regulation.\n\nIt said in a statement that alcoholic drinks should no longer be described as\n\n``energising'' or ``stimulating.''\n\nThe change closes a loophole in packaging rules and brings them into line with\n\nmore stringent advertising regulations to ensure responsible marketing of\n\nalcoholic drink.\n\n``It's clearly not sensible to put on a package what they can't put in an\n\nadvertisement,'' a Portman spokesman said.\n\nMedically, alcohol is a depressant, although it reduces the inhibitions of\n\nthose who use it.\n\nThe Portman Group introduced a Code of Practice in 1996 amid growing public\n\nconcern that a wave of new fizzy sweet alcoholic drinks dubbed ``alcopops''\n\nwere aimed at under-age drinkers. It is illegal for people under 18 to buy\n\nalcohol in Britain.\n\nPortman Director Jean Coussins said the group had already upheld a complaint\n\nagainst an alcoholic jelly called ``Bad Jelly'' under the new rule which\n\ncreates a forum for the public to speak out against irresponsible alcoholic\n\ndrink packaging.\n\n``The Independent Complaints Panel found it (Bad Jelly) breached the code\n\nbecause it would have more appeal to under-18s than to adults and because the\n\npackage design does not make it clear that it's an alcoholic drink,'' she said\n\nin the statement.\n\nLondon-based Haggards Brewery, makers of ``Bad Jelly,'' had since agreed to\n\namend the product's packaging to comply with the code, she said.\n\nBass & Whitbread Are No More But Cheers to the Belgains!\n\nLONDON, July 3 /PRNewswire/ -- Andrew Jefford, Glenfiddich Drinks Writer of the\n\nYear, in his latest column for just-drinks.com, laments the demise of British\n\nbrewing after Belgian giant Interbrew snapped up both Whitbread and Bass\n\nBrewers.\n\n\"The invective heaped on Whitbread and Bass by consumer groups like CAMRA (the\n\nCampaign for Real Ale) has been proved correct in every detail. In the end,\n\nprofit was all that mattered. Brewing was the grandmother of both brewers, and\n\nthey've just sold her. Without a tear.\"\n\nWill the UK's heritage in the beer market be lost? Jefford thinks not.\n\n\"Yes, that's right, it's the Belgians who have just acquired Whitbread's\n\ngranny, and who are in the process of liberating Old Mother Bass. If it had\n\nbeen Anheuser-Busch, I would already have shot myself. If it had been SAB or\n\nFosters or even Heineken, I'd be fingering the revolver. But Interbrew ... the\n\nBelgians understand beer. They even like it! They even like it when it\n\ndoesn't taste boring!\"\n\nTo read the Jefford column, visit http://just\n\ndrinks.com/features-detail.asp?art=197 .\n\njust-drinks is the premier online portal for beverage industry professionals\n\nworldwide.

In the\n\ncountry's capital, Montevideo, Patricia is the leader with a 36.5% market\n\nshare. In the Uruguayan mineral water market, Salus has a 42% share -- 62.2%\n\nin the capital. In the beer market, the company faces the competition of\n\nFabrica Nacional de Cerveja (51%) and of Cervejaria e Maltaria Paysandu (22%).\n\nSalus, one of the most traditional Uruguayan companies, had net sales of US$30\n\nmillion in 1999. It produced 190 thousand hectoliters of beer and 850 thousand\n\nhectoliters of mineral water during that year. The company has 2 industrial\n\nplants -- one for mineral water bottling and another one for beer and soft\n\ndrinks -- both located in Serra de Minas, 110 kilometers away from Montevideo.\n\nIt employs 430 people and has 36 exclusive outsourced distributors.\n\nShould this option be performed it will be the first AmBev's acquisition after\n\nthe merger between Antarctica and Brahma was approved on March 30th. This\n\nacquisition will also be the reinforcement of AmBev's multinational vocation,\n\nwhose international expansion will be primarily focussed on the Latin American\n\nmarket. The company already operates in this region with Compania Cervecera\n\nNacional, in Venezuela, and the Compania Cervecera Brahma Argentina, whose\n\noperations have both started up in 1994. The company holds a 10% and 14%\n\nmarket shares in Venezuela and Angentina, respectively.\n\nIn this association, AmBev and Groupe Danone expect to capitalize on gains due\n\nto synergies obtained from each company capabilities. AmBev and Danone already\n\nhave a product distribution partnership in Argentina. According to AmBev, the\n\npartnership is strategic due to the French company expertise in the global\n\nmineral water market, where it detains the second largest share. The interest\n\nof both companies for Salus is explained by the Patricia brand strong\n\npenetration and to the clear leadership in the local mineral water market.\n\nThe Uruguayan beverage market sizes 5 million hectoliters, which represents a\n\nconsumption rate of 146 liters/inhabitant/year. The consumption rate is 140\n\nliters/inhabitant/year in Brazil. The largest markets by volume are the\n\nmineral water (31.4%) and the soft drinks (also 31.4%) ones. In the soft\n\ndrinks segment Salus has products made of grapefruit and orange. Wine\n\nrepresents 21% of the consumption while beer represents 16.3%. The market\n\nshares by volume in Brazil are 54.2% for soft drinks, 39.4 for beer, 5.3 for\n\nwater and 1% for wine.\n\nFor additional information please contact AmBev Investor Relations: Milton\n\nCabral Filho, (5511) 3741-7560, acmi...@ambev.com.br or Vanessa Barion, (5511)\n\n3741-7553, acba...@ambev.com.br\n\nS&Nshares slump as pubs struggle\n\nBy David Jones\n\nLONDON, July 4 (Reuters) - Shares in British brewing and pubs group Scottish\n\nand Newcastle Plc turn flat on Tuesday as annual profits disappointed and its\n\ncore pubs struggled to make headway as the company absorbed nearly 800\n\nGreenalls' houses.\n\nThe Kronenbourg and John Smith's brewer also warned a fire at one of its Center\n\nParcs sites will delay the division's sale. Its Dutch De Eemhof holiday village\n\nhas closed for rebuilding and Chief Executive Brian Stewart said the sale of\n\nthe 13-site unit will be delayed by a few weeks until later this summer.\n\nThe flat pub performance, headline profits at the bottom end of analysts'\n\nforecasts and the delayed Center Parcs sale all pressured the share into being\n\nthe FTSE 100's biggest loser, ending down 7.4 percent, or 39 pence, at 489p.\n\nThe shares have underperformed the FTSE 100 index by 20 percent over the last\n\n12 months and by other brewers by just over five percent, as the sector has\n\nslipped out of favour and the company struggled for growth in a mature\n\nindustry.\n\nIts core managed pubs, which include Chef & Brewer, Rat & Parrot and Bar 38\n\nchains, showed flat annual profits, with like-for-like sales off three percent,\n\nbut Stewart added most of its smaller poorly-performing pubs had now been sold.\n\n``We sold most of our smaller managed houses in March and April which caused\n\nthe problem, and we are now seeing an improving trend in like-for-like sales,''\n\nStewart said.\n\nAnalysts said the company was absorbing nearly 800 old Greenalls pubs bought\n\nlast December, and clearly trading had suffered as it weeded out 800 of its\n\nsmaller houses for sale.\n\n``Investors are looking at like-for-like sales and margins at its pubs, but\n\nstripping out those 800 pubs the picture was probably flat,'' said analyst\n\nPhilip Hawkins at Merrill Lynch.\n\nSIX PERCENT PROFITS RISE\n\nThe group which brews 28 percent of Britain's beer, with licensed brews\n\nFoster's and Miller Pilsner, as well as John Smith's and Kronenbourg, said\n\npre-tax profits rose six percent for the 52 weeks to April 30 rose to 415\n\nmillion pounds ($627.4 million) on turnover up eight percent at 3.6 billion\n\npounds.\n\nThe results came before six million pounds for a profit share scheme which cut\n\nthe headline figure to 409 million.\n\nAnalysts pointed out that in the short term there was much change going on at\n\nthe group, but it had addressed key strategic issues by buying Kronenbourg and\n\nthe Greenalls pubs, and putting its Center Parcs and Pontin's units up for\n\nsale.\n\n``S&N's long-term focus is on international brewing, so its lowly share rating\n\nreflects history rather than the future,'' said analyst Nigel Popham at Teather\n\nand Greenwood.\n\nStewart said its beer unit, Scottish Courage, outperformed a slight decline in\n\nthe UK beer market with volumes up one percent, while he added that the recent\n\nentry of a committed brewer like Interbrew to the UK beer market would add\n\nstability.\n\nHe said that Center Parcs has also traded well, and that a small group of trade\n\nand financial buyers were conducting due diligence in the auction process, and\n\nhe expected to narrow potential buyers down to one or two next week. Its\n\nPontin's sites would be sold by the end of 2000, in a sale of the whole leisure\n\nunit, which analysts see raising 700-800 million pounds.\n\nThe group, which agreed in March to buy the Kronenbourg beer business over\n\nthree years for 1.7 billion pounds from Danone, was toppled from its leading\n\nspot in UK brewing as Belgium private brewer Interbrew bought the UK beer\n\nbusinesses of Whitbread and Bass in May and June, giving it a UK market share\n\nof 32 percent against S&N's 28.\n\nScottish bought Greenalls' managed pubs for 1.17 billion pounds last December\n\ngiving it almost 2,700 pubs, before putting its leisure division up for sale in\n\nlate February.\n\nIt announced a final dividend up seven percent at 17.94p per share, making a\n\nyear payout also up seven percent at 27.07p.\n\nIt's Coffee vs. Beer in Seattle\n\n.c The Associated Press\n\nSEATTLE (AP) - The glowing red R atop the Rainier Brewery - a Seattle landmark\n\nfor half a century - gave way Monday to a big green T, for Tully's Coffee,\n\nreflecting the coffee boom in the Northwest.\n\nTully's, the nation's third-largest specialty coffee company, moved into the\n\nRainier building in October, after the beer brand was sold to Miller Brewing.\n\nThe building houses Tully's headquarters and packaging plant. Coffee-roasting\n\noperations will move there later this year.\n\nThe green T is about the same size as the red R, or 12 feet tall and about 11\n\nfeet wide.\n\nWhen the R was first installed about 50 years ago, the letter rotated. After\n\nInterstate 5 was built, officials stopped it because they feared the spinning R\n\nmight distract drivers.\n\nTraffic reporters often used the R as a landmark to inform commuters of just\n\nhow snarled traffic is.\n\n``I know Tully's is hoping that we will say Tully's more often,'' said Sara\n\nJohnson, traffic reporter for Metro Networks. ``Maybe when the big green T goes\n\nup it will force our hand, or our mouths.''\n\nS&Nshares slump as pubs struggle\n\nBy David Jones\n\nLONDON, July 4 (Reuters) - Shares in British brewing and pubs group Scottish\n\nand Newcastle Plc turn flat on Tuesday as annual profits disappointed and its\n\ncore pubs struggled to make headway as the company absorbed nearly 800\n\nGreenalls' houses.\n\nThe Kronenbourg and John Smith's brewer also warned a fire at one of its Center\n\nParcs sites will delay the division's sale.

After three closures their licenses would be\n\nwithdrawn permanently -- a far quicker penalty than the current system where\n\nmagistrates decide at a court hearing.\n\nDrunken louts who fight inside and outside pubs -- there were 676,000 such\n\nincidents recorded last year in towns all over the country -- could be excluded\n\nfrom named pubs for periods stretching from two years to life, the newspapers\n\nsaid.\n\nThe proposals are part of draft legislation affecting the 160,000 licensed\n\npremises in England and Wales which was first published in April.\n\nAt the time, attention was fixed on planned reforms allowing some pubs to stay\n\nopen for 24 hours, in the apparent hope of replacing Britain's beer-swilling\n\nhabits with a more European and sophisticated cafe culture.\n\nThe plan for fast-track closure of rowdy clubs came hot on the heels of Blair's\n\nannouncement on Friday that he wanted to give police the power to levy 100\n\npound ($150) on-the-spot fines for ``offensive and loutish'' drunks.\n\n``A thug might think twice about kicking your gate, throwing traffic cones\n\naround your street or hurling abuse into the night sky if he thought he might\n\nget picked up by the police, taken to a cashpoint and asked to pay an\n\non-the-spot fine of, for example, 100 pounds,'' Blair said on a visit to\n\nGermany.\n\nThis breach with tradition in Britain, where courts rather than policemen\n\nimpose punishments, drew anxious reactions from human rights groups and a\n\nlukewarm response from the police themselves.\n\n``This would be the first occasion I am aware of where the police move from law\n\nenforcement to imposing punishment and then collecting a fine,'' Tony Butler,\n\nthe Chief Constable of Gloucestershire, told the Sunday Telegraph.\n\nBut political analysts said Blair's get-tough campaign was partly a result of\n\nthe shameful behaviour of hundreds of British soccer hooligans this month\n\nduring the Euro 2000 soccer tournament in Belgium and the Netherlands.\n\nThe government was criticised by European partners for failing to prevent the\n\nhard-drinking hooligans from travelling abroad.\n\nLack Of Booze Hurts Mexico Tourism\n\n.c The Associated Press\n\nBy BEN FOX\n\nSAN DIEGO (AP) - Damon Krytzer and five friends were planning to spend the\n\nextended Fourth of July weekend in Ensenada, Mexico - but not anymore.\n\nThey canceled their plans as soon as they learned alcohol would not be sold in\n\nanywhere in the country because of Sunday's presidential elections.\n\n``We weren't going there just to get drunk, but it would have been nice to sit\n\naround the pool and drink a margarita,'' said Krytzer, a 29-year-old investment\n\nbroker from San Diego.\n\nFrom midnight Friday to 10 a.m. Monday, alcohol sales are banned in Mexico\n\nunder ``La Ley Seca,'' or the dry law, which is intended to ensure public order\n\nand prevent rowdiness as people head to the polls.\n\nThose Americans who head south of the border anyway will also find popular\n\nnightspots such as Hussong's Cantina and the Papas & Beer disco in Ensenada\n\nclosed. The law is taken seriously in Mexico and, if past elections are any\n\ngauge, it will be nearly impossible to buy booze.\n\nThe election Sunday is widely considered to be the most competitive in Mexico's\n\nhistory with polls showing a statistical dead heat between Francisco Labastida,\n\nthe ruling party candidate and Vicente Fox, the candidate of the\n\nright-of-center opposition National Action Party.\n\nMany Americans with plans to spend the weekend on Mexico's Baja California\n\npeninsula weren't thinking too much of the election - until hearing about the\n\nalcohol ban.\n\nKrytzer and his friends learned they could bring their own alcohol but wouldn't\n\nbe able to take it out of their hotel room.\n\n``It just seemed like such a hassle, so we made other plans,'' he said. They\n\ncanceled their reservations at Ensenada's Coral Hotel and Marina and booked a\n\nroom in Palm Springs.\n\nThe manager at the Coral, Norma Lopez, said she's received about 15\n\ncancellations because of the alcohol ban but that's not many for a hotel with\n\nnearly 150 rooms.\n\n``There will be plenty of other weekends,'' she said.\n\nAbout 80 percent of the hotel rooms in Ensenada are reserved for the weekend,\n\nsaid Felizardo Palacios, the city's delegate to the Baja California state\n\ntourism board.\n\nThe weekend, Palacios said, provides Ensenada with an opportunity to showcase\n\nitself as more of a family destination than the rowdy party spots to the north,\n\nRosarito and Tijuana.\n\n``This election is extremely important to Mexico, so even if some people don't\n\ncome you have to balance that against the greater good for the country,''\n\nPalacios said.\n\nA study by the San Diego-based Institute for Health Advocacy found more than\n\n8,000 Americans cross from San Diego to Tijuana on a typical Friday night. A\n\ntest of those returning showed 64 percent of men and 59 percent of women had\n\nconsumed some alcohol, said Richard McGaffigan a spokesman for the group.\n\nNew Englanders Revolt Against the 'Foreigners' as Sam Adams, Hammer & Nail, and\n\nNew England Brewing Best Imports in Blind Taste Test\n\nSamuel Adams Continues to Lead American Beer Revolution Against Leading\n\nImports; Sets Nine City U.S. Tour of 'Liquid Lunches'\n\nBOSTON, June 30 /PRNewswire/ -- Samuel Adams Boston Lager, Summer Ale, and\n\nCream Stout, along with local Connecticut beers Hammer & Nail Brown Ale, and\n\nNew England Yankee Amber Ale handily won a blind taste-off against great beers\n\nfrom around the world, including Heineken, Corona, Guinness, Newcastle Brown\n\nAle, and Bass Ale in a recent \"Liquid Lunch\" at Hartford's Vito's By The Park.\n\nIn the beer-to-beer blind tasting, tasters were presented with unmarked glasses\n\ncontaining an American craft beer and its style equivalent in one of the great\n\nbeers from around the world. Using rating forms and procedures approved by the\n\nAssociation of Homebrewers, the beers were scored according to appearance,\n\naroma, flavor, and mouthfeel, and were then given an overall impression. The\n\njudges were a mixed lot of beer aficionados, neophytes and media\n\nrepresentatives.\n\nIn each of the five parings, the America craft beer beat its imported\n\ncompetitor: Samuel Adams Boston Lager was preferred over Heineken 29 drinkers\n\nto 3 drinkers. Samuel Adams Cream Stout bested Guinness 17 to 13 (1 tie).\n\nSamuel Adams Summer Ale beat Corona 17 to 15 (5 ties). Hammer & Nail Brown Ale\n\nwas preferred over Newcastle Brown Ale by a 15 to 13 margin (3 ties). New\n\nEngland Yankee Amber Ale was preferred by 17 to 12 over Bass Ale (4 ties).\n\n\"These imports have been considered to be the world standards for their styles,\n\nyet all across the country we have proven that small American brewers like\n\nSamuel Adams make better beer,\" said Jim Koch, Boston Beer Company founder and\n\nbrewer. \"American beer drinkers have more choices than drinkers in any other\n\ncountry, and now they know that they also have many of the world's best beers.\"\n\nThe Hartford \"Liquid Lunch\" is part of Boston Beer Company's continuing mission\n\nto educate and enlighten beer drinkers about the wonders of fresh, well-made\n\nAmerican beer. Over the past two years, Boston Beer Company has hosted \"Liquid\n\nLunches\" in 12 American cities for consumers and journalists and is undefeated\n\nin 48 tastings.\n\nIn conjunction with American Beer Month this July, Boston Beer Company will\n\nagain take on the imports in a 10-city tour that features \"Liquid Lunches\" in\n\nBoston, New York, Philadelphia, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Atlanta, Denver,\n\nMinneapolis, San Diego and Baltimore/Washington, DC,. In each city, three\n\nSamuel Adams beers and two local imports will be paired off with the leading\n\nimport in its style class.\n\nThe American Homebrewers Association, a non-profit educational institute for\n\nthe brewing industry, has had similar results in blind taste-offs, pitting\n\nSamuel Adams Boston Lager against Heineken, as well as American craft beers\n\nagainst world-class imports. A 1999 AHA tour featured tastings in Boulder and\n\nColorado Springs, CO; Albuquerque, NM; and Boston.\n\nJim Koch founded The Boston Beer Company in 1984. He introduced the Company's\n\nflagship beer, Samuel Adams Boston Lager, in April 1985. Today, The Boston\n\nBeer Company, winner of more than 100 international awards, is America's\n\nleading brewer of world-class beer with four distinct product lines.

The statement did not state when exactly the firm's capacity was\n\nexpected to be expanded.\n\nGB, whose brewery is in the Gouna Red Sea resort, launched its products in\n\nApril 1999. They include German beer Lowenbrau, produced under license from\n\nLowenbrau AG Munich, and Big Sexy One Malt Liquor.\n\nThe GB statement said beer sales have grown significantly during the first 12\n\nmonths since launching. GB currently sells around 600,000 to 700,000 litres per\n\nmonth.

Industry observers estimate\n\nproduction has fallen nearly 70 percent since Piccirilli's group arrived,\n\nmaking weeklong shutdowns common for brewery workers. Much of the decline was\n\ncaused by the loss of a major contract with The Boston Beer Co., which pulled\n\nout after 1998. At one time, Pittsburgh Brewing made 400,000 barrels of Samuel\n\nAdams beer annually for Boston Beer.\n\nMoreover, the troubled brewer's two-year effort to find a financial partner has\n\nfallen flat again. Its most recent suitor, unprofitable Bronx beer distributor\n\nCapital Beverage, is running off with a dot.com company from Florida. There are\n\nother issues. Pittsburgh Brewing lost four key managers, including former Chief\n\nExecutive Officer and stockholder James Gehrig, to a Cleveland competitor.\n\nUnion workers say the brewery's cash crunch is prompting some suppliers to\n\ndemand payment on delivery. And the state Department of Revenue filed a tax\n\nlien against Pittsburgh Brewing in November for more than $187,000 in unpaid\n\nmalt beverage taxes.\n\n\"It's like the Perils of Pauline,\" says Peter Reid, editor of Modern Brewery\n\nAge. He estimates Pittsburgh Brewing produced 290,000 barrels last year,\n\noperating at about 25 percent of capacity. It produced an estimated 350,000\n\nbarrels in 1998 and 927,000 barrels the year before Piccirilli's group arrived.\n\n\"It's very hard to reverse a slide like that,\" Reid says. \"You'd think you\n\ncould do something with the Iron City brand. ... You'd need a little bit of\n\nmoney to do it, and I don't see them getting any.\"\n\nAlthough industry observers say the merger is off, neither Pittsburgh Brewing\n\nnor Capital have publicly confirmed that. Capital and Piccirilli did not return\n\nphone calls. Nor did Ventana Global Capital Group, an Irvine, Calif. investment\n\nfirm that's also a Pittsburgh Brewing stockholder.\n\nCapital, the nation's only publicly traded beer distributor, arrived at\n\nPittsburgh Brewing at about the same time Boston Beer was leaving. Capital\n\nagreed to distribute Pittsburgh Brewing's products, including the \"Prime Time\"\n\nbeers Pittsburgh was making and marketing for a Memphis, Tenn. brewery. Capital\n\nalso gave Pittsburgh Brewing a contract to make Capital's own beer under\n\nthe \"Night Flight\" label. Capital said it sold 900,000 cases of the two brands\n\nlast year.\n\nThe partnership blossomed into a proposed merger. Capital said in April 1999 it\n\nwould acquire Pittsburgh Brewing for about $27 million in stock. That was about\n\n$3 million less than what Piccirilli's group paid when it bought Pittsburgh\n\nBrewing in 1995. Capital wouldn't necessarily be a great catch for the\n\nstruggling brewery. The distributor hasn't produced an annual profit since it\n\nwas formed in 1995, ringing up accumulated losses of $3.3 million through the\n\nfirst quarter.\n\nNow the merger is off, and the partnership apparently means less than it used\n\nto. Union workers say they're brewing much less for Capital these days.\n\nMoreover, there was no mention of the Pittsburgh brewery in a quarterly report\n\nCapital filed with securities regulators May 16. Six days earlier, Capital\n\nannounced its intention to merge with Stocktalklive.com, a Boca Raton, Fla.\n\ncompany that provides stock quotes and other financial information over the\n\nInternet. Capital's\n\nbeer and other businesses will be sold.\n\nMerging with Capital gives Stocktalklive the opportunity Pittsburgh Brewing was\n\nlooking for: the chance to go public without going through the time, expense\n\nand scrutiny of a stock offering. Pittsburgh Brewing tried to do that through\n\nmergers with Independence Brewing of Philadelphia and Red Bell Brewing, a\n\nPhiladelphia brew pub operator. Both plans fizzled.\n\nWhat Pittsburgh Brewing plans to do now isn't clear. When Gehrig left last\n\nyear, the brewery said its next CEO would have a solid background in the beer\n\nindustry. According to state Liquor Control Board records, Piccirilli, whose\n\nprevious job experience was working for his family's trash collection business,\n\nis listed as president. In promotional materials, Pittsburgh Brewing says it is\n\ngoing back to the basics and appealing to a younger audience.\n\n\"They're trying very desperately to get Iron City back to its grass roots,\"\n\nsays Rob Pratt, who does advertising and community promotions for the brewery.\n\n\"I'm putting my heart and soul into putting Iron City back where it belongs.\"\n\nPittsburgh Brewing isn't taking the defection of Gehrig and three colleagues\n\nlying down. It's accusing their new employer of infringing on the brewery's\n\ntrademark. The lawsuit was filed in February in federal court in Pittsburgh\n\nagainst Crooked River Brewing Co. and its parent, Snyder International Brewing\n\nGroup of Cleveland. Pittsburgh Brewing says Snyder deliberately designed\n\nCrooked River's trademark to look like Iron City's.\n\nSnyder President Christopher Livingston denied the allegation, saying\n\nPittsburgh Brewing's contention that beer drinkers can't tell the difference\n\nbetween the labels \"is an insult to [customers'] intelligence. \"What it's done\n\nis a good job of keeping us out of Pittsburgh, and we don't think that's right\n\nat all,\" Livingston said.\n\nTroubles are nothing new for Pittsburgh Brewing. Its previous owner, Michael\n\nCarlow, was hailed as a savior in 1992 when he took over Pittsburgh Brewing\n\nafter outbidding management. The white knight was knocked off his horse three\n\nyears later when he was indicted for masterminding a $31.3 million check-kiting\n\nscheme. Carlow pleaded guilty to bank fraud and other charges in 1996 and is\n\nserving an eight-year federal prison sentence.\n\nPiccirilli got high marks for energy when his group took over. But he got rid\n\nof a veteran sales team, alienated some distributors and fired more than 100\n\nunion workers after they walked off the job in 1997. Most of the workers were\n\nlater rehired, but the incident alienated the blue-collar market on which Iron\n\nCity relies.\n\nIndustry conditions compounded its problems. Beer consumption slackened, and\n\nthose who were drinking turned either to well-advertised national brands or\n\nspecialty beers produced by Boston Beer and other microbreweries. There was\n\nalso too much capacity, meaning Pittsburgh Brewing had to compete for contracts\n\nwith other brewers eager to keep their plants running. While industry officials\n\nsay there is still too much capacity, at least the demographics are getting\n\nbetter. Gary Hemphill, vice president of Beverage Marketing Corp., predicts the\n\nbeer market will grow 1 to 2 percent over the next few years. The key reason:\n\nan increase in the number of 21- to 27-year-olds, \"which is hugely important\n\nfor the beer industry, because that's the core consumer,\" Hemphill says.\n\nWhether Pittsburgh Brewing's appeal to its grass-roots market and young\n\ndrinkers will pull it out of its tailspin remains to be seen. If little else,\n\nthe brewery has at least one thing in its favor according to Reid, the editor\n\nof Modern Brewery Age.\n\n\"Pennsylvania consumers are unusually loyal to their regional brewers.\"\n\nhttp://www.phillynews.com:80/content/daily_news/2000/06/30/features/FCOV30.htm\n\nHoppy days are here again!\n\nJoe Sixpack / Don Russell\n\nJuly in Philadelphia, the visitor's dream: Liberty! Fireworks! Independence!\n\nWe know the reality: Hazy! Hot! Humid!\n\nMostly, locals abandon the streets to out-of-towners and head to the shore. But\n\nin the kind of unexpected synergy that makes the city so lovable, the pomp and\n\nthe heat will merge next month to thoroughly wet Philly's whistle. It's\n\nAmerican Beer Month, a celebration of the nation's craft-brewing heritage that\n\nwill be launched tomorrow on the steps of the Art Museum. Yes, there will be\n\nspeeches. But don't sweat it. There will also be plenty of suds.\n\nAnd, in a freebie for People Paper readers, there's also a free lunch. (Details\n\nbelow.)\n\n\"American beer month is like an Independence Day for the American craft-brewing\n\nindustry,\" said organizer John Hickenlooper, a Philadelphia-area native who now\n\nruns America's largest brewpub, Wynkoop Brewery in Denver.\n\n\"This is the first step in getting Americans to realize that the rest of the\n\nworld looks at our creativity, our innovation, our energy and excitement with\n\nenvious eyes,\" Hickenlooper said. \"It's a chance to celebrate the skills of\n\nAmerican brewers.\" American Beer Month is being launched in Philadelphia\n\nbecause of the spirit of independence that echoes through town, and the spirits\n\nthat flow through our taps. The Philly area, if you haven't been paying\n\nattention, boasts some of the best beer in America.\n\nYes, the Northwest has more brewpubs. And Colorado has a ton of micros. But no\n\nother region offers such a variety of inventive microbreweries, so many\n\ntop-flight beer bars and so many imports.\n\nThe choices are daunting to most mortals: room-temperature cask-conditioned\n\nales, high-alcohol barleywines, smelly gueuze served in corked bottles,\n\nhop-infused IPAs and a host of brews flavored with honey, raspberry, chocolate,\n\npeach, heather and coriander. The choices are daunting, even to the likes of\n\nJoe Sixpack, who has devoted excessive time and resources to the examination of\n\nmalt beverages. In honor of American Beer Month, today's report sorts out some\n\nof the details.\n\nLemme start with six things every Philly beer drinker should know:\n\n1. The difference between industrial beer and craft beer.\n\nFactory beer - and I'm talking about anything made with ingredients measured by\n\nthe rail car - is just fine if you're looking for something to guzzle without\n\ntaste. Mostly, they're bland American lagers - Budcoorsmiller - or an equally\n\nbland import: Becks, Molson, Fosters, Corona.\n\nCraft beer - or microbrewed beer - is made in smaller batches. Usually, they're\n\nall malt and full of body and flavor. More importantly, craft beer is usually\n\nmade by guys with pony tails and tattoos.\n\n2. Monk's Café.\n\nIf you judge a joint by its beer selection, Tom Peters and Fergus Carey run the\n\nbest bar in America, period. Craft brews are well represented, but what raises\n\nMonk's to beervana is its exotic Belgian imports, served in its woodsy back\n\nbar. Peters was the first publican to serve any Belgian on tap in America (it\n\nwas Kwak, in 1996). Now, he and Fergie regularly offer flavors you couldn't\n\neven sample in Brussels.\n\n3. Beer Philadelphia magazine.\n\nPublisher Jim Anderson knows more about beer in this city than anyone. I learn\n\nsomething from him every time we bend an elbow together. His magazine,\n\navailable at bars and takeout stores, is the best written and most opinionated\n\nrant in the beer trade. Most of the local American Beer Month festivities were\n\norganized by the energetic Anderson.\n\n4. Home Sweet Homebrew.\n\nOther homebrew stores (notably Barry's Homebrew Outlet, 101 Snyder Ave., South\n\nPhiladelphia) are dependable sources for do-it-yourselfers. But George Hummel\n\nand Nancy Rigberg, the owners of this yeasty mainstay, are directly responsible\n\nfor creating more local craft brewers than anyone. The guys who make\n\nIndependence and Red Bell and Dock Street, among others, got their start with\n\nTupperware homebrew kits and advice from Home Sweet Homebrew. Even if you never\n\nbrew a pint, you owe a debt to these folks. 2008 Sansom St., Center City,\n\n215-569-9469.\n\n5. Edward I. Friedland Co.\n\nTrue story: A few years ago, drawn by its trendy selection of micros, I went in\n\nsearch of Eddie Friedland's beer distributor. My visit took me up North 8th\n\nStreet, into an area commonly known as the Badlands.\n\nI never found the place. Instead, I found myself surrounded by a dozen cops\n\nengaged in one of the neighborhood's frequent drug raids. An angry sergeant\n\nslammed me for driving the wrong way on a one-way street. When I fought the\n\nticket, the Traffic Court judge chided me for being out of my 'hood:\n\n\"Whatsamatta? Don't you got beer distributors in Fishtown?\"\n\nWell, none like Friedland's, which is responsible for popularizing nearly every\n\none of the region's micros. By the way, it's an importing distributor, which\n\nmeans it's not open to retail customers.\n\n6. Our city's brewing history.\n\nF.A. Poth & Sons. . .Robert Smith India Pale Ale. . .Jacob Hornung White Bock.\n\nThe labels are long gone, but these names from breweries past are still a part\n\nof Philadelphia's rich brewery heritage. Before Prohibition, Philadelphia - not\n\nMilwaukee - was the capital of American beer, the home of hundreds of\n\nbreweries. Even if you never heard these brewers' names, your grandfather\n\nremembers running down to the corner for a bucket of Gretz. Or the bricks in\n\nyour home were carried by a mason who kicked back at the end of the day with a\n\ntall, cool glass of Hohenadel.\n\nCelebrate American Beer Month, and you just might find your own place in our\n\nnation's brewing heritage. Lift a pint to the men and women - your neighbors -\n\nwho brew your favorite. It's the best way to say thanks.\n\nAnd there's no better place to do kick off the festivities than right here in\n\nthe City of Brewery Love. Today's Big Fat Friday is filled with sixpacks of\n\nideas for discovering beer in Philadelphia.\n\nJoe Sixpack will get things started at 11:30 a.m. tomorrow at McGillin's Olde\n\nAle House, 1310 Drury St., Center City, where the Daily News proves there is\n\nsuch a thing as a Free Lunch.

I\n\nattended a rally in Philadelphia to kick off the event. More than 200 people,\n\nincluding brewers from 20 states, gathered on the steps of the Philadelphia Art\n\nMuseum to stand up for American craft-brewed beer and later celebrated at\n\ntaverns all over town that had reserved their taps exclusively for American\n\nbeer.\n\nThe event was not conceived to bash imports -- \"If we wanted to do that, we\n\nwould have gone to Boston and dumped some cases of imports into the harbor,\"\n\nsaid one organizer -- but to highlight American beers. Said Pennsylvania brewer\n\nCarol Stoudt, \"We should be proud. What we brew here is better because it's\n\nfresher.\"\n\nAmerican craft brewers are rebounding after a couple of fallow years when\n\nimports surged into the specialty beer market. Some craft breweries closed, but\n\nthe survivors are stronger, with more consistent beer and a better idea of how\n\nto market it. Choosing 10 American craft beers to celebrate July is a tough\n\ntask, but I'll try anyway, sticking to the more accessible ones.\n\nBrooklyn Brewery: Pennant Pale Ale is a good thirst quencher with plenty of\n\nflavor. Brooklyn Pilsner also is a natural for the summer. And if you can find\n\nBlanche de Brooklyn on tap (easily found in the city, not so easily found in\n\nNew Jersey), it recently beat out the famous Hoegaarden for a gold medal in the\n\nWorld Beer Cup.\n\nStoudt's American Pale Ale: great beer, just try it.\n\nFlying Fish Pale Ale: a softer take on a pale ale.\n\nRamstein Blond: Just because it's American Beer Month, it doesn't mean you\n\ncan't drink German-style wheat beer\n\nbrewed in New Jersey.\n\nSierra Nevada Pale Ale: classic American pale ale.\n\nSamuel Adams Summer Ale: light, easy drinking, but with interesting spicy\n\nflavor.\n\nHeavyweight Lunacy Ale: a great Belgian-style beer, also brewed in New Jersey.\n\nRiver Horse Hop Hazard: from Lambertville, a beer for East Coast hop heads.\n\nClimax India Pale Ale: from Roselle Park and available in half-gallon jugs; one\n\nof the best IPA's made anywhere.\n\nSaranac: from the Adirondacks, with several accessible and affordable flavors\n\navailable.\n\nhttp://www.afr.com.au:80/update/20000704/A51545-2000Jul4.html\n\nLion Nathan says FY results set to meet forecasts\n\n2000-07-04, Lion Nathan chief executive Gordon Cairns today said the brewer was\n\ntrading in line with forecasts for second half of this financial year.\n\n\"Our market share is increasing, which is good, and our profits will be in line\n\nwith forecasts,\" he said.\n\nLion books its full-year results on August 31.\n\n\"We're making progress in Australia and we continue to grow in New South Wales,\n\nwhich is the majority of the market.\" Speaking after a business luncheon in\n\nMelbourne, Mr Cairns said the company was looking at a broad range of options\n\nfor expansion in China.\n\n\"We could toll brew, we could have a joint venture, we could produce under\n\nlicence, and we already produce under licence for Beck's and we've talked about\n\ntoll brewing for other brewers and we've looked at JVs,\" he said. \"The\n\nultimate plan is to make money there, and we're open as to how we might do\n\nthat.\n\n\"You certainly can't, as an Australasian brewer, take China on yourself.\"\n\nLion has not yet booked a profit from its Chinese operations, which began in\n\n1995 with a 60 per cent holding in the Wuxi Lion Nathan Taihushui Brewery, and\n\nforecasts to be in the black by 2002 have been abandoned.\n\n\"It looks like I'm going to get hung on that one,\" Mr Cairns said.\n\nHe said there was no current forecast for profitability, but the company was\n\ncommitted to reducing losses from the China operations. Asked whether\n\nforecasts of a slower domestic economy in the new financial year might impact\n\non the company's results, Mr Cairns replied \"clearly, and that's why we have to\n\nbe very assiduous with our cost reduction.\"\n\nIn Australia, Mr Cairns said the company was targeting growth in the premium\n\nbeer market, which represented just 5.7 per cent of the domestic brewing market\n\nbut was growing by 20 per cent per year.\n\nLion had 25 per cent of the premium market and was growing faster than its\n\ncompetitors, he said. In Victoria, where Lion had \"done an appalling job\" the\n\ncompany had spent most of the $100 million earmarked for expansion in the\n\nstate, he said.\n\nAsked whether Lion would be adding to the stock of more than 40 pubs it had\n\nbought in major Victorian cities in a move to boost its ailing market share of\n\njust 12.6 per cent, Mr Cairns replied \"We've probably reached the threshold\n\nthat we want.\"\n\nThe company was pursuing a number of other strategies to increase brand\n\nawareness, including sponsorships.\n\nLion Nathan, which last month moved its head office from New Zealand to Sydney,\n\nposted a first half net profit of $NZ97.1\n\nmillion ($A81 million) for the six months to February 29, up 17 per cent from\n\nthe corresponding period.\n\nLion Nathan shares closed down one cent to $3.75.\n\nhttp://www.afr.com.au:80/investment/20000705/A52444-2000Jul4.html\n\nLion talks aimed at relieving Chinese hangover\n\nBy Simon Evans, 2000-07-05\n\nLion Nathan is in talks with Chinese brewers to broaden its reach in China as\n\nit seeks a faster way to stem losses in the beer market.\n\nChief executive Mr Gordon Cairns yesterday reconsidered previous predictions\n\nthat Lion's Chinese operations would be profitable by 2002 and said it was now\n\nuncertain when profits would flow.\n\n\"I said we'd be profitable about the year 2002. Looks like I'm going to get\n\nhung on that one,\" he said after speaking at a business lunch in Melbourne.\n\nLion entered the Chinese market in 1995 with an investment in a brewery in the\n\ntown of Wuxi and, like its main Australian rival Foster's Brewing Group, has\n\nbeen unable to turn a profit in the highly competitive Chinese market.\n\nLion's China operations suffered a loss of $NZ19.9 million ($15.7 million) in\n\nthe six months to February 29, a slight improvement on the $NZ20.4 million loss\n\na year earlier.\n\nThe world's major brewers are jostling for position in China, which is regarded\n\nas having the most potential because of its enormous population and the\n\nprospects for continued growth in per capita beer consumption.\n\nMr Cairns said partnerships with other Chinese brewers were being evaluated as\n\npart of the moves to broaden Lion's presence from the Yangtse River delta\n\nregion. He declined to give details, citing confidentiality agreements, but\n\nsaid several options were under consideration.\n\n\"We could toll brew, we could have a joint venture, we could produce under\n\nlicence,\" he said.\n\nA China deal would accelerate the move into profitability, he said. Lion\n\nalready produces German beer Beck's under licence in China.\n\nMr Cairns said Lion's Trans-Tasman operations were faring better, and the\n\ncompany had made solid gains in NSW, the largest and most important beer market\n\nin Australia.\n\nTrading in the first four months of the company's second half had been in line\n\nwith market expectations, he said. \"Our market share is increasing, which is\n\ngood, and our profits will be in line with forecasts.\" Most analysts are\n\npredicting a pre-abnormals profit of about $136 million for the full year to\n\nthe end of August. Mr Cairns said Lion's hotel and nightclub buying spree in\n\nVictoria was all but finished. \"We've probably reached the threshold that we\n\nwant,\" he said.\n\nLion has close to 50 properties as part of a push to grow its meagre market\n\nshare of 12.6 per cent.\n\nLion was aware of the potential for an economic slowdown in Australia and\n\nintended keeping a close eye on costs.\n\nMr Cairns said it was unclear what profit impact a potential shift by drinkers\n\nto packaged beer away from on-tap beer, brought about by the Federal\n\nGovernment's higher excise levels, might have if the row over a $500 million\n\ntax dispute was not resolved. Lion shares dropped 1¢ yesterday to close at\n\n$3.75.\n\nhttp://www.toledoblade.com:80/editorial/biz/0g04drin.htm\n\nPopping of drinks part of July 4 festivities\n\nJuly 4, 2000\n\nExcuse area beverage wholesalers and retailer if they were too busy this\n\nweekend to drink a toast to America's Independence Day holiday. The Fourth of\n\nJuly is one of the biggest holidays for beer and soft drink sales.\n\n\"I don't know if it would be the biggest, because Christmas and New Year's are\n\nreally big. But the Fourth would be one of the biggest,'' said Al Cherry,\n\ngeneral\n\nmanager of Toledo's Metropolitan Distributing Co., which sells Miller brands.\n\n\"With . . . Christmas, you're getting more days overall, while the Fourth of\n\nJuly you have fewer days but consumption for all beverage is way up,'' Mr.\n\nCherry said.\n\nAccording to 1998 data (the latest available) collected by Chicago-based\n\nInformation Resources, Inc., beer and ale sales in the two weeks before July 4\n\nand the two weeks after were about 24 per cent higher than for the average\n\nfour-week period for the year.\n\nSoft drink sales were about 14 per cent higher than for the average four-week\n\nperiod, and those for low-calorie drinks were about 9 per cent higher.\n\n\"All the summertime holidays are much bigger,'' said Mark Gibson, head of the\n\nOhio chapter of the National Soft Drink Association.\n\nAccording the U.S. Census Bureau, in 1997 - the latest statistics available -\n\nthe typical American adult consumer drank 34 gallons of beer and three gallons\n\nof wine, with a good portion of that occurring during holidays like the Fourth\n\nof July. Americans of all ages consumed 53 gallons of carbonated soft drinks\n\nthat year, according to the Census Bureau.\n\nBeer consumption was on the decline in 1997 but has since mounted a comeback,\n\naccording to the Washington-based Beer Institute, a trade association\n\nrepresenting the brewing industry.\n\nIn 1994, shipments of beer in the United States totaled 189 million barrels and\n\nshipments to Ohio were 8.2 million, the institute said. Per capita consumption\n\nof beer in 1994 was 22.5 gallons nationwide and 23 gallons in Ohio.\n\nBut shipments fell in 1995 to 186 million barrels and 8.2 million nationwide\n\nand Ohio, respectively. Consumption dropped to 22.1 gallons per capita\n\nnationwide and 22.8 gallons per capita in Ohio.\n\nThen, after staying flat for two years, sales began to rise. Last year, beer\n\nsales reached 196 million barrels nationwide and 8.5 million barrels in Ohio.\n\nConsumption hit 22.3 gallons per capital nationwide and 23.7 gallons in Ohio.\n\nLast year, according to the Beer Institute, was a record year for beer\n\nshipments, with 43 states reporting increased shipments. National consumption\n\nrose 1.7 per cent last year, the institute reported.\n\nhttp://www.bergen.com:80/food/beerfood200007054.htm\n\nHops, barley, and yeast can deliver a wide range of flavor possibilities\n\n5-July-00, By JOE STUMPE Knight Ridder Newspapers\n\nLots of guys consider themselves experts on the subject of cooking with beer.\n\nFire up the grill, crack open a brewski, and you're there, right? For serious\n\ncooks, something a bit more elaborate comes to mind. Tim Schafer of Tim\n\nSchafer's Cuisine, 82 Speedwell, Ave., Morristown, does an entire menu based on\n\nbeer-enhanced cooking. Damien Lehman of the Airport Hilton in Wichita, Kansas,\n\nhas devised perhaps the most unusual dish of all -- a decadent chocolate cake\n\nand accompanying sauce that both included Stoney Creek Vanilla Porter.\n\n\"I'm not sure how many people have tried it,\" Lehman said of using beer in a\n\ndessert. \"It makes it a little heartier, in my\n\nopinion.\"\n\nWhile there have always been dishes made with beer, such as beer-cheese soup\n\nand beef carbonade, it has become a more popular ingredient in recent years.\n\n\"Beer is made up of more than one ingredient,\" said Schafer. \"Wine, on the\n\nother hand, is only one ingredient. Cooking with beer you have water, hops,\n\nbarley, and yeast, and in some cases as many as three different kinds of yeast.\n\nThere\n\nmight be eight different barley malts, and there are some beers with a lot of\n\nalcohol to darker beers made with oats and other grains. So there is an\n\nenormous range of possibilities when you cook with beer.\"\n\nSchafer, who writes a cooking column called \"The Brew Chef Corner\" for Ale\n\nStreet News, says beers are like a seasoning, and he especially enjoys their\n\nherbal qualities in various dishes.\n\nPeter LaFrance, writing in \"Cooking & Eating With Beer\" (John Wiley & Sons,\n\n1997), said the first cooks to extensively use beers in their food were the\n\n\"brave souls who ran the kitchens of the first brew pubs.\"\n\n\"The unique flavor of hops offers the interested cook a chance to stretch his\n\nor her culinary imagination,\" La France wrote. \"The sweet grain flavor of malt\n\noffers its own accent to shimmering soups, stout stews, and braised beef\n\ndishes.\"\n\nSchaefer says the biggest thing to guard against when cooking with beer is\n\nmaking a dish too bitter. \"You have to be aware of the amount of hops in\n\nvarious beers, and if you are reducing the sauce made with beer, you are\n\nintensifying the bitterness,\" he said. \"Sometimes you want that bitterness, but\n\nother times it is necessary to counter it with something like brown sugar, or\n\nhoney.\" Some cooks also avoid the problem by adding beer to sauces and other\n\npreparations just before they are finished.\n\nWilliam Rice, author of \"Steak Lover's Cookbook\" (Workman), said his recipe for\n\nbeer brewed chuck steak is really just a basic meat-and-potatoes dish.\n\n\"During braising with the beer, the beef gives its all,\" in return for your\n\nwaiting for it to simmer gently to fork-tenderness.\"\n\nBEER BREWED CHUCK STEAK\n\n6 sprigs fresh Italian parsley\n\n6 sprigs fresh thyme or 1/2 teaspoon dried thyme leaves\n\n2 cloves garlic, cut in half\n\n2 bay leaves\n\n1 (about 11-ounce) large baking potato\n\n1 tablespoon unsalted butter\n\n1 tablespoon vegetable oil\n\n1 (2-pound) boneless beef chuck shoulder steak, cut 1 1/2 inches thick\n\nSalt and pepper\n\n1 large sweet onion, cut in half and thinly sliced\n\n1 teaspoon paprika, divided use\n\n3/4 cup ale or dark beer\n\n3/4 cup ready-to-serve beef broth\n\nChopped Italian parsley (optional)\n\nWrap parsley, thyme, garlic, and bay leaves in cheesecloth and tie tightly.

Foley, an Irishman, has been\n\npresident and chief executive of Heineken's U.S. arm since 1994. He was\n\npreviously managing director of Murphys Brewery Ireland, another Heineken unit.\n\nState-owned Aer Lingus, which could be floated by the end of the year, said it\n\nbelieved Foley, 52, was the right man despite his lack of aviation industry\n\nexperience. He initially qualified as an accountant. ``He brings to the job of\n\ngroup executive the perfect blend of international business and public company\n\nexperience to lead an already strong management team through the challenges\n\nthat lie ahead,'' said Chairman Bernie Cahill.\n\nFormer chief executive Gary Cullen resigned in February, saying that for\n\npersonal reasons he did not want to lead the company through the IPO process.\n\nLegislation clearing the way for the Aer Lingus flotation is currently going\n\nthrough the Irish parliament and an IPO is expected late this year or early in\n\n2001.\n\nThe company is expected to try to raise some 200 million Irish pounds ($242.6\n\nmillion) through the issue of new shares at the time of the flotation. The\n\nflotation is expected to value the company as a whole at up to 700 million\n\npounds.\n\nFEMSA Appoints New CFO\n\nMONTERREY, Mexico--(BUSINESS WIRE)--July 5, 2000--Fomento Economico Mexicano,\n\nS.A. de C.V.

Budapest's other Turkish-inspired institution, the\n\ntraditional coffee-house, is making a comeback.\n\nClosed by the communists in 1949, coffee-houses where people may sit for hours,\n\nwrite all day, meet lovers, debate politics, drink one cup of coffee or eat\n\nthree square meals, have been reviving bit by bit since communism's demise in\n\n1989.\n\nA SPY AT EVERY TABLE\n\n``The communists closed them because they couldn't put a spy at every table,''\n\nsaid university lecturer Noemi Saly, a student of the Budapest ``kavehaz'' --\n\ncoffee-house -- scene.\n\nUnder communism, coffee-houses became industrial and institutional canteens.\n\nThe fabled New York Kavehaz, stripped of chandeliers and with marble walls and\n\nmirrors covered by plywood, was reopened as a sporting goods store.\n\nBefore calamity struck, Budapest was known throughout Europe as the ``city of\n\ncafes,'' Saly said. She distinguishes coffee-houses from coffee shops, designed\n\nfor a quick brew, and pubs, beerhalls and bistros, where the main aim is to\n\ndrink.\n\n``All the democratic revolutions were born in coffee-houses,'' she said.\n\n``Fascist and communist revolutions were born in the bistros -- beer for the\n\nGermans, vodka for the Russians. Those revolutions want manipulable people and\n\ncoffee is the contrary.''\n\nHungary isn't the only place in Central Europe with coffee-houses -- Vienna, to\n\nthe west, is known to have a few. But Hungarians did coffee-houses with a\n\nvengeance. At the turn of the century, Budapest had almost 600 full-service\n\ncoffee-houses and another 400 so-called ``little cafes,'' serving a population\n\nof less than a million. One main boulevard claimed more than 60 all to itself.\n\nCAFE WORLD RECORD\n\n``It was a world record at the time,'' said Saly, whose flat overlooking the\n\nDanube River is crammed with books and photographs recording the history of the\n\nBudapest cafe scene. Coffee-houses, which became popular in the 18th century,\n\nwere democratic places where merchants and talc-spattered barbers rubbed\n\nshoulders with counts and dukes.\n\nAn English visitor to Budapest remarked on the mixing of the classes -- and how\n\n``un-English'' it was, Saly said.\n\nJournalists, musicians, artists and writers mingled freely with doctors,\n\nlawyers, politicians and members of other professions, each of which tended to\n\nhave its own cafes.\n\nPoets didn't spend much, but waiters turned a blind eye because, as one astute\n\nproprietor noted, poets attract beautiful women and beautiful women lure rich\n\nmen. The Turks, who also developed Hungary's hot mineral spring baths,\n\nintroduced coffee to Hungary when they seized most of its territory in the 16th\n\ncentury.\n\nHungarians at first spurned the dark, bitter brew. But after the Turks were\n\ndriven out in the 17th century, Hungarian students and nobles who travelled to\n\nWestern Europe discovered coffee anew, and the kavehaz was born.\n\nHungary's first recorded coffee-house was founded by a Serb in nearby\n\nSzentendre in 1696. The idea spread like wildfire.\n\nAt a time when many workers, white collar and otherwise, could afford only a\n\nbed in an outlying district, coffee-houses provided light, warmth,\n\ncompanionship and good, simple food.\n\nHOME AWAY FROM HOME\n\n``There were a lot of Budapest residents who could not invite people home\n\nbecause conditions were not good at all,'' Saly said. ``In the cafes you could\n\nmeet and you could talk.''\n\nThe day's newspapers were available on racks. One cafe offered the services of\n\na woman typist. Yet another would hoist a black flag when a regular customer\n\ndied. Some of the coffee-houses, predictably, catered to the lustier needs of\n\na thriving city. aly said Budapest had at least six ``singing coffee-houses''\n\nfrequented by registered prostitutes. Small cafe orchestras included women\n\nwhose main talents were distinctly not musical.\n\nOne of the most famous of the female denizens of the night in\n\nturn-of-the-century Budapest was a young woman who spoke Greek and Latin and\n\nwas known to her coffee-house admirers as ``puella classica'' -- the young\n\nwoman of the classics. Re-creating the coffee-house tradition -- minus the\n\nracier elements -- has required dedication and deep pockets.\n\nHungarian pharmaceuticals entrepreneur Imre Somody spent on the order of 300\n\nmillion forints -- more than $1 million -- to restore the Central Kavehaz,\n\nfounded in 1892, said cafe manager Zsolt Forgacs.\n\nFor that, Somody has himself one of the most authentic looking coffee-houses,\n\nwith woodwork, trim and paint matched to the original found beneath the facade\n\nof a defunct bagel shop and video arcade.\n\nSLOW IN A FAST-FOOD WORLD\n\nIn a fast-food world, it is not entirely self-evident that multi-service\n\ncoffee-houses like the Central, with everything from main dishes, pastries,\n\ndrinks, newspapers and a display case featuring a picture of the late Hungarian\n\nactor Bela Lugosi, to plenty of electrical outlets for laptop computers, can\n\ncompete.\n\nBut Forgacs said the response since the Central reopened earlier this year has\n\nbeen enormous. He hopes for a revival of the literary and intellectual debate\n\nthat the Central enshrines in wall plaques commemorating two famous Hungarian\n\nliterary reviews whose editors met there.\n\n``We believe in the power of talking...where everybody, including VIPs, meets\n\nin a step by step process,'' he said. ``Longer term, this is much better\n\nbusiness than just to catch the money now.''\n\nhttp://news.excite.com/news/r/000705/08/odd-snack-dc\n\nSheep-Gut Snack Could Hit EU Entry\n\nJuly 5, 2000, ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkish regional authorities are cracking down\n\non a popular snack made of sheep's guts for fear it could pose public health\n\nrisks and obstruct the country's bid for European Union membership.\n\nThe state-run Anatolian news agency said Monday eight sheep intestine\n\nprocessing centers were closed down in the western province of Aydin for\n\nsanitation lapses.\n\nBut Milliyet newspaper said the authorities had banned the sale of the snack,\n\nknown as kokorec, because it could cause bacterial and parasitic infections.\n\n\"Kokorec, one of the obstacles to Turkey's entering the European Union, cannot\n\nbe sold in Aydin because it has been found unhealthy,\" the daily said.\n\nThe delicacy, sold mainly from streetside stalls, is commonly eaten in Turkey,\n\nparticularly after a long night of drinking.\n\nIt was not immediately clear whether the ban would be extended to other\n\nprovinces.\n\nTurkey won EU candidacy in December but faces a long list of reforms to meet\n\nEuropean criteria in many areas, including health and food production. Turkish\n\nleaders have cited 2004 as a target date for EU entry talks, but many\n\npoliticians at home and abroad foresee a much longer timeframe.\n\nIrish drinkers toast longer hours, price freeze\n\nDUBLIN, July 6 (Reuters) - Irish drinkers raised their glasses to the\n\ngovernment on Thursday after ministers introduced longer pub opening hours and\n\nfroze drink prices.\n\nIn a bid to curb worrying inflation in the ``Celtic Tiger,'' Consumer Affairs\n\nMinister Tom Kitt slapped a six-month freeze on the prices of drinks including\n\nbeer, wine and whiskey.\n\nIn another move likely to boost the ailing coalition government's flagging\n\npopularity, pubs across the country will be able to sell alcohol until 12:30\n\na.m. on Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays -- 90 minutes later than under the old\n\nlaw.\n\nPatrons will be given another 30 minutes drinking-up time -- meaning everyone\n\nmust be out by 1:00 a.m.\n\nBetter still for drinkers, landlords will only be allowed to charge their\n\nthirsty clients the price in effect on May 15 under the terms of the\n\nanti-inflation price freeze.\n\nThe government has doubled the number of consumer affairs inspectors to 24 to\n\npatrol pubs to enforce the freeze.\n\nThe Irish capital Dublin, home to a large student population and increasingly a\n\nmecca for European weekend tourists, is expected to benefit in particular from\n\nthe new hours.\n\nThe city, which has styled itself one of the trendiest of Europe's capitals,\n\nhas in recent years felt itself to be out of step with its more liberal\n\ncontinental neighbours.\n\nFor the rest of the week, the Intoxicating Liquor Act extends opening hours by\n\n30 minutes until 11:30 p.m., except Sundays which retain the 11.00 p.m. law.\n\nControversially, the Act abolishes Irish pubs' long-enshrined tradition of not\n\nserving drinks between 2:00 p.m. and 4:00 p.m. on Sundays.\n\nThat law, known as ``holy hour,'' was intended originally to drive menfolk home\n\nfor the family lunch but now baffles foreign tourists used to more relaxed\n\ncontinental ways.\n\nKitt, part of a government striving to liberalise Ireland's drinks trade, said\n\ncompetition was the most effective means of keeping prices down.\n\n``However, as an interim measure and as part of the package approved by the\n\ngovernment to counter inflation, I have now introduced a statutory control on\n\nthe price of drink,'' Kitt said in a statement.\n\nThe relaxation of opening hours has been accompanied by new measures aimed at\n\ncurbing under-age drinking.\n\nThe new rules mean premises can be shut down temporarily if they are found to\n\nhave served minors. The law has been changed to put the onus on a publican to\n\nbe satisfied as to the age of a drinker before selling alcohol.\n\nQuilmes Industrial -Quinsa- S.A.

A special committee of the Corporation's Board of\n\nDirectors has been formed to continue to explore strategic alternatives for\n\nGenesee Brewing Company, including a proposal for a management-led buyout,\n\nfollowing the decision to terminate the agreement to sell the business to the\n\nowners of City Brewing Company.\n\nResults for the Corporation's real estate investment and equipment\n\nleasingbusinesses are also reported as discontinued operations. The\n\nCorporation has previously announced that it was not actively seekin additional\n\nreal estate investments and that Cheyenne Leasing Company would not fund any\n\nnew leases\n\nafter December 31, 1999 and would wind down its equipment leasing business as\n\nthe portfolio of existing leases matures. Cheyenne Leasing Company has now\n\nentered into an agreement in principle to sell a significant portion of its\n\nlease portfolio. As a result of these developments, the Corporation's real\n\nestate investments and equipment leasing business are required to be reported\n\nas discontinued operations.\n\nResults for the Corporation's continuing operations reflect only its Foods\n\nDivision and corporate segment. The prior year results from continuing\n\noperations have been reclassified to reflect required changes in the reporting\n\nof freight costs associated with the Foods Division and to separately report\n\nresults for the brewing, real estate investment and equipment leasing\n\nbusinesses as discontinued operations.\n\nConsolidated gross revenues from continuing operations for fiscal 2000 were\n\n$48,548,000, compared to reclassified gross revenues from continuing operations\n\nof $47,682,000 for fiscal 1999. The Corporation recorded a net loss from\n\ncontinuing operations of $1,141,000, or $.70 basic and diluted net\n\nloss per share in fiscal 2000, compared to restated net earnings from\n\ncontinuing operations of $920,000, or $.57 basic and diluted net earnings per\n\nshare, in fiscal 1999.\n\nGross revenues in fiscal 2000 from discontinued operations were $123,520,000\n\ncompared to $138,590,000 in the same period last year. Discontinued operations\n\ngenerated a net loss of $2,259,000, or $1.40 basic and diluted net loss per\n\nshare, in fiscal 2000, compared to a net earnings of $1,543,000, or $.95 basic\n\nand diluted net earnings per share, in fiscal 1999.\n\nCombining revenues from continuing and discontinued operations, the Corporation\n\nrecorded gross revenues of $172,068,000 and a net loss of $3,400,000, or $2.10\n\nbasic and diluted net loss per share, in fiscal 2000,compared to gross revenues\n\nof $186,272,000 and net earnings of $2,463,000, or\n\n$1.52 basic and diluted net earnings per share, in fiscal 1999.\n\nResults in fiscal 2000 were adversely affected by a $3.1 million loss from the\n\nplanned sale of the equipment lease portfolio, $2.1 million of transition costs\n\nincurred in relocating Foods Division operations, a $1.8 million charge\n\nin connection with workforce reductions at Genesee Brewing Company, a $1.2\n\nmillion charge for retirement benefits paid to the Corporation's former Chief\n\nExecutive Officer, and a $1 million reserve to cover the expected write-off of\n\nan investment by Genesee Ventures. The decrease in earnings in\n\nfiscal 2000 compared to the prior year also reflects the fact that fiscal 1999\n\nresults included a $3.4 million pre-tax gain from the sale of Genesee Ventures'\n\ninterest in Lloyd's Food Products, whereas only a $600,000 gain from the\n\nLloyd's sale was recorded in fiscal 2000.\n\nNet sales for the Corporation's Foods Division were $45.5 million in fiscal\n\n2000, compared to $44.9 million in fiscal 1999. Sales of artificial sweeteners\n\nand bouillon products increased in fiscal 2000 compared to the prior year.\n\nThese gains were partially offset by a decrease in contract\n\npackaging revenues and a decline in sales of iced tea mix. Operating income\n\nfor the Foods Division decreased to $189,000 in fiscal 2000, compared to\n\n$1,554,000 in fiscal 1999, due in large part to the costs incurred in fiscal\n\n2000 to relocate operations to the Medina, New York facility that was acquired\n\nin October 1998. The relocation project was completed in January 2000.\n\nGenesee Brewing Company's net sales in fiscal 2000 were $93.4 million, a\n\ndecrease of $9.9 million from the prior year period. Barrel volume declined by\n\n6% in fiscal 2000 due to a 9% decline in Genesee core brand volume and a 22%\n\ndecline in HighFalls brand volume, which were partially offset by a 34%\n\nincrease in contract brewing volume for Boston Beer Company. Genesee Brewing\n\nCompany recorded an operating loss in fiscal 2000 of $2.7 million. When the\n\n$1.8 million restructuring charge from workforce reductions is netted out, this\n\nreflects a $3.3 million improvement in operating results over the prior\n\nyear. \"We did a re-assessment of all areas of our business to identify ways\n\nto reduce costs and improve efficiencies,\" said Tom Hubbard, President and\n\nChief Executive Officer. \"Many of these initiatives were not implemented\n\nuntil the second half of fiscal 2000. Although we have not yet seen the\n\nannualized impact of these initiatives, we did see improvement in sales trends\n\nfor our core brands and operating performance in the fourth quarter of fiscal\n\n2000,\" said Mr. Hubbard.\n\nThe Corporation's equipment leasing and real estate investment businesses\n\nrecorded operating income of $2,682,000 in fiscal 2000, compared to $3,801,000\n\nin fiscal 1999. The decrease is the result of the plan announced in September\n\n1999 to wind down Cheyenne Leasing Company's business. Cheyenne Leasing\n\nCompany recently entered into an agreement in principle to sell a significant\n\nportion of its lease portfolio. The sale is subject to a number of conditions\n\ncustomary to such transactions, including satisfactory due diligence and\n\nnegotiation of a definitive sale agreement between Cheyenne Leasing Company\n\nand the buyer. It is currently estimated that the Corporation would receive\n\napproximately $13 million as its portion of the sale proceeds. Because the\n\nsale would generate a book loss, generally accepted accounting principles\n\nrequire that the Corporation record the estimated loss now, even though the\n\nsale has not been completed. Accordingly, fiscal 2000 results include a\n\n$1.9 million loss, net of a tax benefit of $1.2 million, from the sale of the\n\nlease portfolio.\n\nThe Corporation established a $1,000,000 reserve in the fourth quarter of\n\nfiscal 2000 to cover the expected loss from Genesee Ventures' investment in\n\nStiffel Company. The investment in Stiffel (an Illinois-based manufacturer\n\nof premium lamps and lighting fixtures) was the first of three minority\n\ninvestments made by Genesee Ventures totaling $2.9 million. The Stiffel\n\nCompany was recently forced into liquidation by a senior lender after failing\n\nto satisfy certain loan covenants, resulting in a total loss for all of the\n\nequity investors, including Genesee Ventures. Genesee Ventures' investment in\n\nLloyd's Food Products generated pre-tax gains in fiscal 1999 and 2000 totaling\n\n$4 million. Genesee Ventures continues to hold the third investment, a\n\nminority interest in a remarketer of durable supplies for food service and\n\nindustrial users.\n\nGENESEE CORPORATION\n\nComparative Statement of (Loss)/Earnings\n\nFISCAL YEAR FISCAL YEAR\n\nENDED ENDED\n\nAPRIL 29, 2000 MAY 1, 1999\n\nAs Restated\n\nNet Revenues $45,548,000 $44,893,000\n\nSamuel Adams Sponsors Monday Night Comedy Showcase for Amateur Comedians at the\n\nComedy Connection July 10, 17,\n\nShowcase Winners Earn Stand Up Opportunity At Samuel Adams Grill & Groove 2000\n\nRadio Event\n\nBOSTON, July 6 /PRNewswire/ -- Samuel Adams is in search of Boston's best\n\namateur comedian and will host three Samuel Adams Monday Night Showcases at the\n\nComedy Connection on Monday July 10, 17, and 24.

And why?\n\nIt's not politics, holy fever nor even the secular religion of soccer -- but\n\nthe unlikely mix of sweaty exhibitionism and booming techno music that is\n\nBerlin's annual Love Parade.\n\nWhat began in 1989 as 150 people dancing up West Berlin's main shopping street\n\nbehind a solitary float has swelled into the world's biggest dance music rave\n\nparty and Saturday's 12th parade is expected to match last year's record\n\nnumbers.\n\nBut while a global surge in the popularity of music like techno can in part be\n\nput down to the camaraderie fostered by a cocktail of primal tunes and\n\nmind-expanding drugs, the Love Parade's mix of sun, sex and subversion is even\n\nmore potent.\n\nLast year it brought 1.5 million to the streets of the German capital -- close\n\nto half its population.\n\nAlthough its growth has mirrored Berlin's transformation over the past decade\n\nfrom divided Cold War battlefield to a ``cool'' concoction of culture and\n\nconsumer capitalism, it has retained an edge for many of Europe's hardcore\n\ntechno fans.\n\nAbout 250 disc jockeys, including some of the continent's best-known names,\n\nwill serve up a wide spectrum of modern dance music from 50 floats cruising\n\ndown a wide boulevard bisecting Berlin's Tiergarten park en route to the iconic\n\nBrandenburg Gate.\n\nAnd the outrageous attire of many ravers -- or lack of it -- not to mention the\n\nporn films shot in the park amid copulating couples seeking refuge in the\n\ntrees, preserves some of Berlin's famously decadent hedonism and quasi-anarchy,\n\nand is an echo of Rio de Janeiro's carnival fever.\n\n``The Love Parade is the Berlin carnival,'' saidErnst Haeberle, the general\n\nsecretary of the European Federation of Sexology. ``It's just a bundle of sheer\n\nenjoyment of life.''\n\n``BETTER THAN HITLER'S STORM TROOPERS''\n\nAlthough Saturday's crowds are unlikely to enjoy a similar sun-baked spectacle\n\nto last year, police are still prepared for hot weather -- many of the 3,000\n\nofficers patrolling the route have been issued with water pistols to cool\n\noverheated dancers.\n\nAbout 250 temporary toilets will be erected around the Victory Column in the\n\nmiddle of the Tiergarten to try and cope with the beer-weakened bladders of a\n\nmillion-plus crowd.\n\nWhile the parade is free, the descent of so many young people bent on having a\n\ngood time means large amounts of cash will be spent in the city -- which\n\nsomewhat reluctantly foots the clean-up bill since the event is classed as a\n\ndemonstration.\n\nBut its exponential growth, which has spawned sister events in Austria and\n\nBritain this year, has alienated some, who say its branded floats show it has\n\nsold out to commercial interests.\n\nA rival parade, which started life as the Hate Parade in 1997, aims to restore\n\na counter-cultural edge by offering the most hardcore strains of dance music on\n\nan alternate route through the central Mitte district of East Berlin, itself\n\nrapidly gentrifying.\n\nAnd the nightclubs which have won the city a reputation as one of Europe's top\n\nparty capitals in the decade since the Berlin Wall fell will host a string of\n\nevents over the weekend, making the main parade just one dimension of the\n\nexperience.\n\nAlthough many party-goers will be high on little more than the thrill of\n\nexhibitionism, pulsating music and alcohol, large numbers will add an extra\n\ndimension to their weekend by taking ecstasy, amphetamines, cocaine or\n\nhallucinogenic drugs.\n\nBerlin drug workers will lay on water and ``chill out'' areas to try and\n\nminimise immediate risks from taking drugs.\n\nBut altered state or not, sexologist Haeberle believes the music is the key to\n\nthe mass gathering in Berlin.\n\n``It's a necessary outlet, this techno music. This is an elemental human\n\nneed,'' he said.\n\n``Nazi storm troopers once marched down that street, now there's the Love\n\nParade. Which would you prefer?''\n\nhttp://www.beer.com/news/bee/bee/2000/06/12/960841130021.html\n\nNice piece entitled, \"Specialty beer importers: good life, hard work \" by JIM\n\nDORSCH\n\nhttp://www.usahops.org/board/board.cgi?message=41&topic=4\n\nSwiss Business Briefs:Assoc Against Feldschloesschen Sale\n\nDow Jones Newswires\n\nST. GALLEN, Switzerland -- The Association of independent Swiss\n\nMicrobreweries has asked the government to block the sale of\n\nFeldschloesschen brewery on the grounds it would stifle competition and\n\nprevent the liberalization of the Swiss beer market.\n\nhttp://www.toledoblade.com:80/editorial/biz/0g06buck.htm\n\nVenerable name in beer returns to its hometown\n\nMike Berry, owner of Glass City Brew on Premises, in Perrysburg, tends to a\n\nbatch of Buckeye Beer. (Toledo Blade photo)After a 28-year absence, Toledo's\n\nBuckeye Beer is back in town.\n\n\"We think we're pretty close to the original,'' said Toledoan Dave\n\nKulish, president of Buckeye Beer, Ltd. \"We had one gentleman who tried\n\nit and he said, 'All I ever drank was Buckeye.' He said it was about 95\n\nper cent close. I don't think we're going to get better than that.''\n\nMr. Kulish, 38, and his business partners, John Spieker III, 42, of\n\nCanton, Mich., and Jay Tillman, 40, of Saginaw, Mich., have spent the\n\nlast five years trying to reproduce Buckeye - the first beer the three\n\nbrothers-in-law tried in their youth and the beer their parents preferred.\n\nThe fledgling enterprise is making about 200 cases a week of bottled\n\nBuckeye at Glass City Brew on Premises Co. in Perrysburg. The brand made\n\nits return last week and is being sold at 41 area bars, restaurants, and\n\nretail outlets, including The Andersons and Tony Packo's.\n\nA six-pack costs $5.99, and is competing against a myriad of fancy beers\n\nand ales.\n\nJim Heltebrake, wine shop manager at The Andersons on Talmadge Road,\n\nsaid that of the 30 cases of Buckeye the store received this week just\n\nthree were left yesterday.\n\n\"We've been playing off the nostalgia. We've been having periodic\n\nannouncements about it and asking people to relate their Buckeye beer\n\nstories to us. Most kind of scratch their head and say, 'Boy I haven't\n\nseen that in 25 years or so,' \" said Mr. Heltebrake, who himself is too\n\nyoung to have tasted Buckeye.\n\nThe Buckeye Brewing Co. began making Buckeye at Bush and Champlain\n\nstreets in Toledo in 1838. Chicago-based Meister Brau, Inc., bought\n\nBuckeye in 1966 and brewed the first Meister Brau Lite beer in Toledo.\n\nIn 1972 Miller Brewing Co., of Milwaukee - realizing that the future\n\nwould include light beers - bought the Buckeye and Meister Brau Lite\n\nlabels. The new owner changed Meister Brau Lite to Miller Lite, moved\n\nBuckeye beer production to Milwaukee, then stopped making the beer in\n\nlate 1972.\n\nMiller's nonuse of the Buckeye name allowe"
