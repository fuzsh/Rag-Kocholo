It was the fault of the organisers for inviting a \"name\" and in a way Karpov's fault for accepting. Karpov's career as a leading chess player is clearly coming to an end and its quite sad to see how far his play has declined. However his increasingly selfish actions where he seeks to extract the last drop out of his reputation as a great player (for instance getting the FIDE Championships postponed by almost a year for his own benefit) is becoming increasingly tiresome and unworthy. He has his place amongst the greats, for his play over the board, it really is time to leave the front stage to others and become a dignified elder statesman of the game.\n\nThe fallout of the failed WCC cycle continues. Shirov gives his opinions on what has happened and especially the Anand-Kasparov match below, Anand also gave some measure of reply in Leon.\n\nI understand that Caesar's Palace has been confirmed as the venue of the FIDE Championships after final negotiations and that announcements as to the details of the venue (for those who wish to attend for instance) and final list of players are imminent.\n\nIn addition there are interesting tournaments in Portoroz, Malmoe and elsewhere.\n\nOn the local (British) front, in recognition of his achievements British Chess player Nigel Short has been awarded the MBE in the latest Queen's Birthday Honours list.\n\nHope you enjoy this issue\n\nMark\n\n2) Karpov vs Anand Advanced Chess Match\n\nThe Anatoly Karpov vs Viswanathan Anand Advanced Chess Match took place June 11-14th in Leon, Spain. The players used computer programs and databases to aid their play, the games were a maximum of two hours in duration. The result was an overwhelming 5-1 victory for Viswanathan Anand.\n\nDay 1 Anand won game one with black and drew game two with white.\n\nDay 2 The same story took place on day two with Anand winning game three with black and drawing game four with white.\n\nDay 3 Anand completed a hat-trick of victories with black in the event before winning also with white to complete a really one sided victory.\n\nThe result of the match doesn't really come as much of a surprise. After the organisers and Kasparov had a dispute the sponsors wanted a big name replacement for Kasparov. In Spain that name is still Anatoly Karpov. However Karpov is well known as not one of the better users of computer technology, he does use databases, but only to print out games to look at them on a normal board. He probably doesn't make much use of computer playing programs either. It is said that he was paid double the appearance fee of Anand to act as Kasparov's replacement.\n\nProbably the more significant action took place off the board. Both Anand and Karpov gave interviews. Unfortunately my Spanish is not very good (the original reference is: http://deportes.ole.com/espdep/articulo/articulo.cfm?ID=DEP1839) but a crude electronic translation revealed some interesting points. Karpov has been playing an extraordinary series of political games in recent weeks. He gave an explosive interview to Schach magazine revealing many behind the scenes FIDE secrets, I understand he has tried to undermine Kirsan Iljumzhinov's position with the IOC by going to their President Samaranche and claiming that Iljumzhinov was not eligible to be elected as FIDE President, he has also threatened to sue FIDE as they did not consult him over the timing of the FIDE Championships in Las Vegas. The interview with Anand refers to a Karpov interview where he says that he leaves open the question of his participation in Las Vegas. Anand's interview was a little more straightforward. He defends himself against Shirov's accusation that he should not have taken the match against Kasparov as Shirov was the player who qualified to play him. \"I am not an opportunist\" Anand is reported as saying. He goes on to say that the WCC had collapsed and he was accepting a match with a completely different organisation and that whilst he conceeded that the whole situation was a mess it was not his fault. [See Shirov's letter and press release below for a comprehensive view on his point of view]\n\nOfficial coverage: http://www.ajedrezdelfuturo.com (Spanish) http://www.advancedchess.com (English).\n\n3) Sigeman & Co Chess Tournament, Malmoe\n\nThe Sigeman & Co Chess Tournament takes place in Malmo, Sweden June 8th-16th.

The event took place May 29 until June 10. Predrag Nikolic won the event with 8.5/11. He led throughout and just held out from Jeroen Piket who mounted a late challenge. If Nikolic wishes to defend his title he will have to make himself available for the Dutch Olympiad side, something he is unlikely to do.\n\nInternet coverage:http://www.nkschaken.nl\n\nRound 9 (June 8, 1999) Reinderman, Dimitri - Van den Doel, Erik 1/2 63 C68 Ruy Lopez; Exchange Van der Wiel, John - Janssen, Ruud 1-0 32 B11 Caro-Kann Sokolov, Ivan - Nijboer, Friso 1-0 42 E92 Kings indian; Classical Van der Sterren, Paul - Piket, Jeroen 0-1 28 D13 Slav defence Cifuentes Parada, Roberto - Van Wely, Loek 0-1 69 D75 1.d4 d5 2.c4 g6 Peng Zhaoqin - Nikolic, Predrag 0-1 43 E12 Nimzo indian Round 10 (June 9, 1999) Nikolic, Predrag - Van der Wiel, John 1/2 18 D43 Semi-Slav Piket, Jeroen - Cifuentes Parada, Roberto 1-0 41 D46 Semi-Slav Sokolov, Ivan - Peng Zhaoqin 1-0 41 D43 Semi-Slav Van den Doel, Erik - Van der Sterren, Paul 1/2 65 C95 Ruy Lopez Nijboer, Friso - Van Wely, Loek 1/2 34 B81 Sicilian Janssen, Ruud - Reinderman, Dimitri 1/2 36 B38 Sicilian Round 11 (June 10, 1999) Reinderman, Dimitri - Nikolic, Predrag 1/2 12 A08 Reti (1.Nf3) Van der Wiel, John - Sokolov, Ivan 1-0 26 B82 Sicilian Van Wely, Loek - Piket, Jeroen 1/2 24 D20 QGA; Van der Sterren, Paul - Janssen, Ruud 1/2 18 E05 Nimzo indian Cifuentes Parada, Roberto - Van den Doel, Erik 1/2 60 E15 Nimzo indian Peng Zhaoqin - Nijboer, Friso 1-0 50 D91 Gruenfeld indian Rotterdam NED (NED), v-vi 1999 cat.

The event had the character of family affair with friends and chess gentlemen playing for modest fees and prizes, but cherishing the level of competition and cosy atmosphere during meals and social ocassions.\n\nA special case was the playoff blitz games with Saitek clocks (one of the main sponsors of the competition). After a draw in the normal tournament game, players had to switch colours and play 6:5 minutes with white obliged to play for win.\n\nThe main event feautured two Czech players who qualified for the Las Vegas world championship Movsesian and Babula, with guests, the best Australian and Slovak players Rogers and Ftacnik. The favourite Movsesian was not exactly in the best form and his Houdini-like escape in the first round against Rogers helped him a lot to get back into the swing and claim a narrow victory in the end. On the other side of the crosstable Rogers played much better than his result would indicate, but luck was simply not on his side.\n\nIf the Kasparov-Anand match is at least partly staged in Prague you can count on some surprise side tournaments arranged by Mr.Modr. He has organized many round robins in Prague for his club Bohemians and in modern days exhibitions and events for famous personalities have also been held. Well connected and loving chess he publishes a highly respected chess magazine as a one man show. As they say: Love for chess can sometimes move mountains.\"\n\nPrague CZE (CZE), v-vi 1999 cat.

After nine of the ten rounds the score is Peterburg Kings 24 Beer Sheva 21. Both sides have one player who has scored 6/9. Boris Avrukh for the Israelis and Vassily Yemelin for the Russians.

There were two sections to this international event in Santa Clara, Villa Clara, Cuba that took place May 24th - June 7th 1999. The first section was a Category VIII (2445) tournament won by Juan Manuel Bellon Lopez with 10/13. Lenier Dominguez of Cuba scored a GM norm. A curiosity is the game Jose Alvarez vs Roberto Paramos Dominguez which was given as a draw in the final table (the result which I've taken) but was given as a win for Paramos Dominguez in the gamefile which actually looks more plausible. In the second section there was a two way tie on 9.5/13. Irisberto Herrera and Lazaro Bruzon both tied for first and scored GM norms to complete their titles. On 8.5 points Salvador Gabriel Del Rio Angelis scored a nine round norm. 17 year old fm Bruzon in fact had three IM norms in 6 months but now has the norms for the GM title too, completed in less than a month.\n\nGuillermo Garcia Group 1 Santa Clara CUB (CUB), v 1999 cat.

Then he suggests that I get compensated for not playing Kasparov in the form of match against Polgar and misterious priveleges in the misterious next World Championship cycle. Just two remarks on it:\n\n1. My match vs. Polgar has no connection with the match Kasparov-Anand. This was agreed upon with Bessel Kok when he invited me for the Prague match. And there is no single word on Kasparov or Anand nor World Championship in my contract for this match. I still claim that the match vs. Kasparov should be mine and not Anand's.\n\n2. I have not been contacted about the next Non-Fide cycle but in any case I am not going to start it from lower stage than what I have already qualified for - the World Championship match.\n\nAnother thing I wanted to mention is Malcolm Pein's article in Daily Telegraph on 4th of June. Malcolm claims that by accepting the match offer, Anand removes the last vestige of credibility from the Fide cycle because its winner will be no more than the World number 3 player. This is a pure nonsense! One can not know what will be Anand's rating when he plays Kasparov (and rating is now the only Anand's credibility) but we all know that the Las Vegas winner will earn his title in the honest and equal fight with much more of the World best chessplayers than just one or two.\n\nSincerely, Alexei Shirov\n\nShirov Official Press Release 2 14.06.1999\n\nIn addition Shirov has a made a second press release available. (original appeared at http://www.schach-daniel.com/ and this is reproduced with permission.) Shirov writes:\n\nMore than five months have passed since my first press release. It's definitely not my style to write open letters, however after so much desinformation around my match against Kasparov (now in fact the match Kasparov- Anand) I feel that I have to clear some points. Just for chess' sake.\n\nEven before my first press release was published, Kasparov had stated that he wanted to play Anand because 'it was impossible to find money for the match Shirov-Kasparov' and that 'the match Shirov-Kasparov was not interesting for sponsors because Anand was much stronger'. Kasparov repeated these statements until finally on 3rd of June this year Anand was rumoured (I can't find a better word since the official announcement is to be made on 10th of July) to sign the contract for their match.\n\nLet me refute these statements one by one. First of all, Anand is not anymore stronger than me. Nor is he in comparison with ,for example, Kramnik and Morozevich. His last two tournament performances in Monaco and Dos Hermanas were complete failures as he was behind his main rivals. And now, after my relative success in Sarajevo my WCC rating is even higher than Anand's. I don't give much importance to the WCC rating but it's Kasparov who always considers the WCC rating to be more objective than the FIDE rating. Complete contradiction. When last year I collapsed in Dortmund, Kasparov was quick to say that my performance diminished sponsors' interest for the match. What has changed until now when Anand shared the last place in Dos Hermanas? Strange game.\n\nA few words about Anand's legitimacy. Everybody knows that last year Anand refused to play the candidate's match vs. Kramnik, let me call it 'semifinal'. And now when I replaced him in the semifinal and qualified for the final, he goes to take my place apparently without any conscience problems! As if believing that it's not his problem that I don't have sponsors for the match and the people who want to make Kasparov-Anand match don't recognize my legitimacy.\n\nAnd the absence of sponsors is not the true case at all. Now it's 100% clear to me that if Kasparov had always recognized me as his only legitimate opponent for the World Championship match, it would have been possible to make it. And he revealed himself when at the end of May he publicly stated that if Anand refused then he would play against me. So, it was definitely not a money problem that Kasparov preferred to play Anand instead of me. And the real reasons one will never know. I could only add that in March, during the Linares tournament Kasparov refused to have a telephone conversation with the Catalan manager Enric Turet who was working hard trying to make my match against Kasparov in Barcelona and Terrasa. And shortly after that (on March 12, I believe) Kasparov accepted the offer of Mr. Serge Grimaux, the promoter of Kasparov-Anand match, it remained just to wait for Anand's answer. And since the answer could come at any time, any organization that was interested in my match against Kasparov (apart from Mr.Turet I was also contacted by people in Poland, England and USA) could find it useless to go on working on it.\n\nMy last and real chance to play against Kasparov would have been Anand's negative responce to Mr. Grimaux's offer. But this was too much a hope as in our world a lot of people strive for money and more money, so Anand proved to be no exception by taking what doesn't belong to him. I consider both Anand and Kasparov guilty for depriving me of the World Championship match and that this century will end with their inlegitimate 'World Championship'.\n\nAlexei Shirov, 14.06.1999\n\nOpen Letter from Alex Yermolinsky\n\nPoor Lembit Oll was the odd-man-out holding a Number 21 spot in the FIDE World Championship Invitational List. He knew it all along. Exactly one year ago we played a tournament together and Lembit was speaking about his chances to make the cut. His wish came true, but ironically at the most inappropriate moment. Just days before his tragic and mysterious death he received a letter from FIDE that was officially upgrading his status from Reserve player to a full-fledged participant of the Las Vegas Extravaganza. Lembit called our mutual friend Shabba and began to make his travel plans for visiting the United States in the summer. Chicago, Vermont, Phila, then LA, and finally Vegas. We all expected to see him there. Then someone broke the news...\n\nHere I am, Lembit's fellow GM who met him for the first time as far back as 1982, sitting there and fighting a battle with my conscience. Should I claim my rights for the vacated spot? After all, in the 1998 published ratings combined I come next with the average ELO of 2642.5, and logically, must be invited to take Lembit's place. It would be nice to have somebody else to make such a decision, but I can't wait any longer. No word from FIDE has come yet, and I have no choice but speak my mind. It all comes down to the extreme sloppiness which has become a trademark of the current FIDE administration. It has nothing to do with the uncertainty of the Las Vegas situation. Postpone the tournament, move it to a new location, whatever - we may get upset, but we can understand because somebody is talking big money there. What ticks me off is a total incompetence shown in handling simple matters of selecting the participants. What we got there is a 100-player tournament that is supposed to assume a knockout format. Simple math, or not even that, just recollections from Groningen 1997, and here we are with 28 players seeded into the second round. Who are they? Presumably, the rating invitees. So far so good, but has it ever been mentioned, put in writing by FIDE? The five guys, winners of Groningen-Lausanne, plus the twenty people in the published list makes 25, and what about the other three spots? Total darkness. Then again, Lembit got invited. At whose expense, I wonder? Has FIDE finally smarted up about Kasparov's non-participation? If so, was Lembit invited to the second round? Is there a certain cut-off rating floor, and the players below it wouldn't be considered as possible replacements for Kasparov, Anand, Karpov, Oll and the Serbian players Velimirovic and Djuric, who might not get their US visas or might simply not want to come to the country that is waging an undeclared war on their homeland? Would the preference to be given to \"almost qualifiers\" from different Zonal tournaments? If so, then what criteria will be used in making your choices among them? I'm not here to discuss the system. It may be stupid to invite players to a tournament that might or might not take place at the second half of 1999 based on their ratings circa 1998 that mostly reflect their performances before Groningen 1997. On the other hand, some people got into the Second Round of Groningen based on their ratings from 1994-1995. Whatever, it is, that's the criteria we all agree to use.\n\nThe problem is, nobody is monitoring FIDE daily activities, and there's a lot of loopholes left in what passes for World Knockout Championship Rules and Regulations Book. It's kind of stupid to offer USCF as an exemplary organization when it comes to running chess tournaments simply because we don't have any here in the States, but for every US Invitational Championship there's a 5-man deep list of alternative players. Just in case. By keeping the process of selecting the substitutes behind the closed doors FIDE further taints its own reputation. It feeds me dark thoughts - I'm paranoid, I'm a conspiracy theorist. Somewhere out there things are getting fixed in the worst tradition of professional boxing, and there is a dogfight going on for vacant spots, one of those being the property of a dead guy. How 'bout considering Lembit a Round Two loser and using that check to establish a trust for his kids? I know it's tough to come up with 3 million dollars, you don't have to tell me about it. But, c'mon FIDE boys, for crying out loud, stop hiding from us! Update your webpage, make a habit of a weekly press-release, or in any other way stay in touch with your rank-and-file players! Let it be Las Vegas in August or Katmandu in November - doesn't matter.\n\nAll I ask for is an open and fair process of selecting the participants. Tell me who goes to Round Two, who and in what order may get upgraded from Round One seeding to Round Two in case of some invitees' non-participation, and goddamn it, publish the alternative list NOW!
