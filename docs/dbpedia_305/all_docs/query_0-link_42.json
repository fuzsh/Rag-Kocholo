Advances in laser cooling and trapping of neutral atoms in a Magneto-Optic Trap (MOT) have made cold atoms available as the starting point for many laser cooled atomic physics investigations. The most spectacularly successful of these, the observation of Bose-Einstein Condensation (BEC) in a dilute ultra-cold spin polarized atomic vapor, has accelerated the study of cold collisions. Experimental and theoretical studies of BEC and the long range interaction between cold alkali atoms is at the boundary of atomic and low temperature physics. Such studies have been difficult and would not have been possible without the development and advancement of laser cooling and trapping of neutral atoms. By contrast, ion-atom interactions at low temperature, also very difficult to study prior to modern day laser cooling, have remained largely unexplored. But now, many laboratories worldwide have almost routine access to cold neutral atoms. The combined technologies of ion trapping, together with laser cooling of neutrals has made these studies experimentally feasible and several very important, novel applications might come out of such investigations . This paper is an investigation of ion-atom interactions in the cold and ultra-cold temperature regime. Some of the collisional ion-atom interactions present at room temperature are very much reduced in the low temperature regime. Reaction rates for charge transfer between unlike atoms, A + B(+) approaches A(+) + B, are expected to fall rapidly with temperature, approximately as T(sup 5/2). Thus, cold mixtures of atoms and ions are expected to coexist for very long times, unlike room temperature mixtures of the same ion-atom combination. Thus, it seems feasible to cool ions via collisions with laser cooled atoms. Many of the conventional collisional interactions\n\nPREFACE: XXV International Conference on Photonic, Electronic and Atomic Collisions\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBecker, Uwe; Moshammer, Robert; Mokler, Paul; Ullrich, Joachim\n\n2007-07-01\n\nThe XXVth ICPEAC in Freiburg marked a notable anniversary in collision physics: half a century ago the first conference in the series of International Conferences on the Physics of Electronic and Atomic Collisions (ICPEAC) was held in New York (1958). Since then, the development of electronic and atomic collision physics has seen tremendous progress. Starting during a time, when this field was regarded as somehow out-of-date, certainly not being in the main stream compared to particle and high-energy physics, it has expanded in a rather exceptional and unforeseen way. Over the years the original scope on electronic, atomic and heavy-ion collision physics was extended substantially to include upcoming expanding fields like synchrotron-radiation and strong-field laser-based atomic and molecular physics giving rise to a change of name to 'Photonic', Electronic and Atomic Collisions (ICPEAC) being used for the first time for the ICPEAC in Santa Fee in 2001. Nowadays, the ICPEAC has opened its agenda even more widely to other fields of atomic and molecular physics, such as interactions with clusters, bio-molecules and surfaces, to cold collisions, coherent control, femto- and attosecond physics and, with the Freiburg conference, to the application of free-electron lasers in the vacuum ultraviolet and soft x-ray regime, a field of potentially huge future impact in essentially all areas of science. In this larger context the XXVth ICPEAC in Freiburg with more than 800 participants set new standards. Representatives from all fields of Atomic, Molecular and Photon-based science came together and had very fruitful, inter-disciplinary discussions. This new forum of collision-based AMP physics will serve as a showcase example of future conferences, bridging not only the gap between different fields of collision physics but also, equally important, between different continents and cultures. The next ICPEAC is going to take place in Kalamazoo in North America, the one after that\n\nAtomic cluster collisions\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKorol, Andrey V.; Solov'yov, Andrey\n\n2013-01-01\n\nAtomic cluster collisions are a field of rapidly emerging research interest by both experimentalists and theorists. The international symposium on atomic cluster collisions (ISSAC) is the premier forum to present cutting-edge research in this field. It was established in 2003 and the most recent conference was held in Berlin, Germany in July of 2011. This Topical Issue presents original research results from some of the participants, who attended this conference. This issues specifically focuses on two research areas, namely Clusters and Fullerenes in External Fields and Nanoscale Insights in Radiation Biodamage.\n\nOn the treatment of â-changing proton-hydrogen Rydberg atom collisions\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nVrinceanu, D.; Onofrio, R.; Sadeghpour, H. R.\n\n2017-11-01\n\nEnergy-conserving, angular momentum changing collisions between protons and highly excited Rydberg hydrogen atoms are important for precise understanding of atomic recombination at the photon decoupling era and the elemental abundance after primordial nucleosynthesis. Early approaches to â-changing collisions used perturbation theory only for dipole-allowed (Îâ = Â±1) transitions. An exact non-perturbative quantum mechanical treatment is possible, but it comes at a computational cost for highly excited Rydberg states. In this paper, we show how to obtain a semiclassical limit that is accurate and simple, and develop further physical insights afforded by the non-perturbative quantum mechanical treatment.\n\nGuide to bibliographies, books, reviews and compendia of data on atomic collisions\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nMcDaniel, E.W.; Mansky, E.J.\n\nIn 1985, the Atlanta atomic physics group published an extensive bibliography on atomic collisions. It differed from the usual in that it contained few references to individual research papers, but instead concentrated on data collections, bibliographies, review articles and books. The present work updates the 1985 from August 1984 to September 1992.\n\nUltracold collisions between Rb atoms and a Sr+ ion\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMeir, Ziv; Sikorsky, Tomas; Ben-Shlomi, Ruti; Dallal, Yehonatan; Ozeri, Roee\n\n2015-05-01\n\nIn last decade, a novel field emerged, in which ultracold atoms and ions in overlapping traps are brought into interaction. In contrast to the short ranged atom-atom interaction which scales as r-6, atom-ion potential persists for hundreds of Î¼m's due to its lower power-law scaling - r-4. Inelastic collisions between the consistuents lead to spin and charge transfer and also to molecule formation. Elastic collisions control the energy transfer between the ion and the atoms. The study of collisions at the Î¼K range has thus far been impeded by the effect of the ion's micromotion which limited collision energy to mK scale. Unraveling this limit will allow to investigate few partial wave and even S-wave collisions. Our system is capable of trapping Sr+ ions and Rb and Sr atoms and cooling them to their quantum ground state. Atoms and ions are trapped and cooled in separate chambers. Then, the atoms are transported using an optical conveyer belt to overlap the ions. In contrast to other experiments in this field where the atoms are used to sympathetic cool the ion, our system is also capable of ground state cooling the ion before immersing it into the atom cloud. By this method, we would be able to explore heating and cooling dynamics in the ultracold regime.\n\nCollisions between ultracold metastable He atoms\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nWoestenenk, G.; Mastwijk, H. C.; Thomsen, J. W.; vna der Straten, P.; Pieksma, M.; van Rijnbach, M.; Niehaus, A.\n\n1999-06-01\n\nWe present experimental data on collisions between excited He-atoms occurring in a magneto-optical trap (MOT) at a temperature of 1.1 mK. He(2 3S)-atoms produced in a discharge are pre-cooled and trapped using the He(2 3S)-He(2 3P 2) transition for laser manipulation. Measurements of the Penning ionization rate as a function of the MOT-laser frequency are presented and theoretically analyzed. The analysis, based on a model which is presented in detail for the first time, leads to a good understanding of the complex nature of optical collisions. Further, first and preliminary measurements of the kinetic energy distributions of He 2+- and He +-ions formed by Penning ionization in optical collisions are presented.\n\nEffects of hydrogen atom spin exchange collisions on atomic hydrogen maser oscillation frequency\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nCrampton, S. B.\n\n1979-01-01\n\nFrequency shifts due to collisions between hydrogen atoms in an atomic hydrogen maser frequency standard are studied. Investigations of frequency shifts proportional to the spin exchange frequency shift cross section and those proportional to the duration of exchange collisions are discussed. The feasibility of operating a hydrogen frequency standard at liquid helium temperatures is examined.\n\nV. S. Lebedev and I. L. Beigman, Physics of Highly Excited Atoms and Ions\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMewe, R.\n\n1999-07-01\n\nThis book contains a comprehensive description of the basic principles of the theoretical spectroscopy and experimental spectroscopic diagnostics of Rydberg atoms and ions, i.e., atoms in highly excited states with a very large principal quantum number (nâ«1). Rydberg atoms are characterized by a number of peculiar physical properties as compared to atoms in the ground or a low excited state. They have a very small ionization potential (â1/n2), the highly excited electron has a small orbital velocity (â1/n), the radius (ân2) is very large, the excited electron has a long orbital period (ân3), and the radiation lifetime is very long (ân3-5). At the same time the R. atom is very sensitive to perturbations from external fields in collisions with charged and neutral targets. In recent years, R. atoms have been observed in laboratory and cosmic conditions for n up to Ë1000, which means that the size amounts to about 0.1 mm, Ë106 times that of an atom in the ground state. The scope of this monograph is to familiarize the reader with today's approaches and methods for describing isolated R. atoms and ions, radiative transitions between highly excited states, and photoionization and photorecombination processes. The authors present a number of efficient methods for describing the structure and properties of R. atoms and calculating processes of collisions with neutral and charged particles as well as spectral-line broadening and shift of Rydberg atomic series in gases, cool and hot plasmas in laboratories and in astrophysical sources. Particular attention is paid to a comparison of theoretical results with available experimental data. The book contains 9 chapters. Chapter 1 gives an introduction to the basic properties of R. atoms (ions), Chapter 2 is devoted to an account of general methods describing an isolated Rydberg atom. Chapter 3 is focussed on the recent achievements in calculations of form factors and dipole matrix elements of different types of\n\nTheoretical atomic physics code development I: CATS: Cowan Atomic Structure Code\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nAbdallah, J. Jr.; Clark, R.E.H.; Cowan, R.D.\n\nAn adaptation of R.D. Cowan's Atomic Structure program, CATS, has been developed as part of the Theoretical Atomic Physics (TAPS) code development effort at Los Alamos. CATS has been designed to be easy to run and to produce data files that can interface with other programs easily. The CATS produced data files currently include wave functions, energy levels, oscillator strengths, plane-wave-Born electron-ion collision strengths, photoionization cross sections, and a variety of other quantities. This paper describes the use of CATS. 10 refs.\n\nAtom-atom inelastic collisions and three-body atomic recombination in weakly ionized argon plasmas\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nBraun, C. G.; Kunc, J. A.\n\n1989-01-01\n\nA stationary collisional-radiative model including both inelastic electron-atom and atom-atom collisions is used to examine nonequilibrium weakly ionized argon plasmas with atomic densities 10 to the 16th to 10 to the 20th/cu cm, temperatures below 6000 K, and with different degrees of radiation trapping. It is shown that three-body atomic recombination becomes important at high particle densities. Comparison is made between the present approach and Thomson's theory for atomic recombination.\n\nOn the Treatment of l-changing Proton-hydrogen Rydberg Atom Collisions\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nVrinceanu, Daniel; Onofrio, Roberto; Sadeghpour, Hossein\n\n2018-01-01\n\nEnergy-conserving, angular momentum-changing collisions between protons and highly excited Rydberg hydrogen atoms are important for precise understanding of the primordial recombination cascade, and the elemental abundance.Early approaches to l-changing collisions used perturbation theory for only dipole-allowed (Îl = Â±1) transitions.

The subject of the study was the formation of CO2 molecules as a result of impingement of O atoms at controlled kinetic energies upon cold surfaces onto which CO molecules had been adsorbed. In this study, the O/CO system served as a laboratory model, not only for the formation of CO2 but also for the formation of other compounds through impingement of rapidly moving atoms upon molecules adsorbed on such cold interstellar surfaces as those of dust grains or comets. By contributing to the formation of increasingly complex molecules, including organic ones, this study and related other studies may eventually contribute to understanding of the origins of life.\n\nQuantum chaos in ultracold collisions of gas-phase erbium atoms.\n\nPubMed\n\nFrisch, Albert; Mark, Michael; Aikawa, Kiyotaka; Ferlaino, Francesca; Bohn, John L; Makrides, Constantinos; Petrov, Alexander; Kotochigova, Svetlana\n\n2014-03-27\n\nAtomic and molecular samples reduced to temperatures below one microkelvin, yet still in the gas phase, afford unprecedented energy resolution in probing and manipulating the interactions between their constituent particles. As a result of this resolution, atoms can be made to scatter resonantly on demand, through the precise control of a magnetic field. For simple atoms, such as alkalis, scattering resonances are extremely well characterized. However, ultracold physics is now poised to enter a new regime, where much more complex species can be cooled and studied, including magnetic lanthanide atoms and even molecules. For molecules, it has been speculated that a dense set of resonances in ultracold collision cross-sections will probably exhibit essentially random fluctuations, much as the observed energy spectra of nuclear scattering do. According to the Bohigas-Giannoni-Schmit conjecture, such fluctuations would imply chaotic dynamics of the underlying classical motion driving the collision. This would necessitate new ways of looking at the fundamental interactions in ultracold atomic and molecular systems, as well as perhaps new chaos-driven states of ultracold matter. Here we describe the experimental demonstration that random spectra are indeed found at ultralow temperatures. In the experiment, an ultracold gas of erbium atoms is shown to exhibit many Fano-Feshbach resonances, of the order of three per gauss for bosons. Analysis of their statistics verifies that their distribution of nearest-neighbour spacings is what one would expect from random matrix theory. The density and statistics of these resonances are explained by fully quantum mechanical scattering calculations that locate their origin in the anisotropy of the atoms' potential energy surface. Our results therefore reveal chaotic behaviour in the native interaction between ultracold atoms.\n\nEffect of inelastic electron-atom collisions on the Balmer decrement\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nAdams, W. M.; Petrosian, V.\n\n1974-01-01\n\nCalculation of the Balmer decrement in radiatively ionized hydrogen gas as a function of temperature and density, taking into account the effect of electron-atom collisions. It is found that once the electron density exceeds 10 to the 10th power per cu cm significant deviations from the normal radiative recombination decrement begin to occur. Implications of these results for the physical conditions in the line-emitting region of the Seyfert galaxy NGC 4151 are discussed briefly.\n\nAlignment relaxation of Ne*(2pi[J=1]) atoms due to collisions with He(1s^2) atoms\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKhadilkar, Vaibhav; Matsukuma, Hiraku; Hasuo, Masahiro; Bahrim, Cristian\n\n2008-10-01\n\nAlignment relaxation of atoms induced by collisions offers accurate information regarding the anisotropic atom-atom potentials and has many applications in atomic and plasma physics. Here we report the energy-averaged cross sections for destruction of alignment Ï^(2) and the rate coefficients for disalignment KDA of Ne^*(2p^5 3p; 2pi [J=1]) atoms due to He atom collisions using a many-channels close-coupling method based on a modified model potential for the HeNe^*(2p^5 3p) system [1]. Comparison with measurements using laser-induced fluorescence spectroscopy (LIFS) [2] and Hanle signals [3] is reported. The LIFS method measures KDA due to intra-multiplet transitions, while the analysis of Hanle signals gives Ï^(2), which incorporates both the intra- and inter-multiplet transitions. Good agreement between theory and experiments was found for the 2p2, 2p5, and 2p7 states at 77 K < T < 350 K when a static polarizability for each Ne^*(2pi) state is added to the long-range potentials of the HeNe^*(2p^5 3p) system given in Ref.[4].

W.\n\n2000-12-01\n\nGrazing collisions with background gas are the major cause of trap loss and trap heating in atom traps. To first order, these effects do not depend on the trap density. In collisionally opaque trapped atom clouds, however, scattered atoms with an energy E larger than the effective trap depth Eeff, which are destined to escape from the atom cloud, will have a finite probability for a secondary collision. This results in a contribution to the heating rate that depends on the column density of the trapped atoms, i.e., the product of density and characteristic size of the trap. For alkali-metal atom traps, secondary collisions are quite important due to the strong long-range interaction with like atoms. We derive a simple analytical expression for the secondary heating rate, showing a dependency proportional to E1/2eff. When extrapolating to a vanishing column density, only primary collisions with the background gas will contribute to the heating rate. This contribution is rather small, due to the weak long-range interaction of the usual background gas species in an ultrahigh-vacuum system-He, Ne, or Ar-with the trapped alkali-metal atoms. We conclude that the transition between trap-loss collisions and heating collisions is determined by a cutoff energy 200 Î¼K<=Eeff<=400 Î¼K, much smaller than the actual trap depth E in most magnetic traps. Atoms with an energy Eeffatoms Li through Cs as a function of the effective trap depth, the column density of the trap, and the species in the background gas. The predictions of our model are in good agreement with the experimental data of Myatt for heating rates in high-density 87Rb-atom magnetic traps at JILA, including the effect of the rf shield and the composition of the background gas. It is shown that collisions with atoms from the Oort\n\nPREFACE: XXVII International Conference on Photonic, Electronic and Atomic Collisions (ICPEAC 2011)\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nWilliams, I. D.; van der Hart, H. W.; McCann, J. F.; Crothers, D. S. F.\n\n2012-11-01\n\nThe XXVII International Conference on Photonic, Electronic and Atomic Collisions was held at Queen's University Belfast, Northern Ireland, 27 July - 2 August 2011. Members of the Local Organising Committee were drawn from the School of Mathematics and Physics of Queen's University Belfast, the School of Physical Sciences at Dublin City University, the School of Physics at University College Dublin and the Department of Experimental Physics at the National University of Ireland, Maynooth. The Conference was attended by 566 participants with contributions from 54 countries. The meeting attracted 786 contributed papers for presentation in the poster sessions. The conference included 20 Special Reports selected from the contributed papers, and these are included in part 1 of this volume. During the meeting a total of 65 Progress Reports were also presented, and the authors invited to submit written versions of their talks (see Part 1). Of the total number of contributed papers, 663 are included as refereed abstracts in parts 2 to 15 of this volume of Journal of Physics: Conference Series. Part 1 of this volume includes detailed write-ups of the majority of plenary lectures, progress reports and special reports, constituting a comprehensive tangible record of the meeting, and is additionally published in hard-copy as the Conference Proceedings. There were 5 plenary lectures given by Margaret Murnane on Ultrafast processes in atomic dynamics; Chris Greene on Few-body highly-correlated dynamics; Michael Allan on Electron-molecule collisions; Yasunori Yamazaki on Antiproton and positron collisions and Thomas StÃ¶hlker on Relativistic ion collisions. Ian Spielman, winner of the IUPAP Young Scientist Prize for 2011, gave a special lecture entitled Modifying interatomic interactions using Raman coupling: a tale of slowly colliding Bose-Einstein condensates. In addition an evening public lecture by Mike Baillie on How precise tree-ring dating raises issues concerning the\n\nElectron collisions with coherently prepared atomic targets\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nTrajmar, S.; Kanik, I.; LeClair, L.R.\n\n1998-02-01\n\nThe subject of electron scattering by laser-excited atoms is briefly reviewed. To demonstrate some aspects of these electron collision processes, the authors describe the procedures and the results of a joint experimental and theoretical study concerning elastic scattering by coherently excited {sup 138}Ba (...6s6p {sup 1}P{sub 1}) atoms. Examples of experimental and theoretical collision parameters and magnetic sublevel differential cross sections for elastic scattering are given and compared. The convergent close coupling calculations (with the neglect of spin-orbit interaction) are in good agreement with experiment at 20 eV impact energy and 10, 15 and 20{degree} scattering angles and can bemoreÂ Â» expected to yield reliable integral magnetic sublevel and alignment creation cross sections. The role of these quantities in plasma polarization spectroscopy is pointed out.Â«Â less\n\nImproving atomic displacement and replacement calculations with physically realistic damage models.\n\nPubMed\n\nNordlund, Kai; Zinkle, Steven J; Sand, Andrea E; Granberg, Fredric; Averback, Robert S; Stoller, Roger; Suzudo, Tomoaki; Malerba, Lorenzo; Banhart, Florian; Weber, William J; Willaime, Francois; Dudarev, Sergei L; Simeone, David\n\n2018-03-14\n\nAtomic collision processes are fundamental to numerous advanced materials technologies such as electron microscopy, semiconductor processing and nuclear power generation.

Extensive experimental and computer simulation studies over the past several decades provide the physical basis for understanding the atomic-scale processes occurring during primary displacement events. The current international standard for quantifying this energetic particle damage, the Norgett-Robinson-Torrens displacements per atom (NRT-dpa) model, has nowadays several well-known limitations. In particular, the number of radiation defects produced in energetic cascades in metals is only ~1/3 the NRT-dpa prediction, while the number of atoms involved in atomic mixing is about a factor ofmoreÂ Â» 30 larger than the dpa value.

It is shown for the system He(2+) - H at 2 keV/amu that the collision dynamics depend strongly on the initial phase of the laser field and the applied wavelength. Whereas electronic transitions are caused by the concurrent action of the field and the projectile ion at relatively low frequencies, they can be separated into modified collisional capture and field ionization events in the region above the one-photon ionization threshold.\n\nPotential Energy Curves and Collisions Integrals of Air Components. 2; Interactions Involving Ionized Atoms\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nStallcop, James R.; Partridge, Harry; Levin, Eugene; Langhoff, Stephen R. (Technical Monitor)\n\n1995-01-01\n\nCollision integrals are fundamental quantities required to determine the transport properties of the environment surrounding aerospace vehicles in the upper atmosphere. These collision integrals can be determined as a function of temperature from the potential energy curves describing the atomic and molecular collisions. Ab initio calculations provide a practical method of computing the required interaction potentials. In this work we will discuss recent advances in scattering calculations with an emphasis on the accuracy that is obtainable. Results for interactions of the atoms and ionized atoms of nitrogen and oxygen will be reviewed and their application to the determination of transport properties, such as diffusion and viscosity coefficients, will be examined.\n\nA quasi-classical study of energy transfer in collisions of hyperthermal H atoms with SO2 molecules.\n\nPubMed\n\nda Silva, Ramon S; Garrido, Juan D; Ballester, Maikel Y\n\n2017-08-28\n\nA deep understanding of energy transfer processes in molecular collisions is at central attention in physical chemistry. Particularly vibrational excitation of small molecules colliding with hot light atoms, via a metastable complex formation, has shown to be an efficient manner of enhancing reactivity. A quasi-classical trajectory study of translation-to-vibration energy transfer (T-V ET) in collisions of hyperthermal H( 2 S) atoms with SO 2 (XÌ 1 A ' ) molecules is presented here. For such a study, a double many-body expansion potential energy surface previously reported for HSO 2 ( 2 A) is used. This work was motivated by recent experiments by Ma et al. studying collisions of H + SO 2 at the translational energy of 59âkcal/mol [J. Ma et al., Phys. Rev. A 93, 040702 (2016)]. Calculations reproduce the experimental evidence that during majority of inelastic non-reactive collision processes, there is a metastable intermediate formation (HOSO or HSO 2 ). Nevertheless, the analysis of the trajectories shows that there are two distinct mechanisms in the T-V ET process: direct and indirect. Direct T-V processes are responsible for the high population of SO 2 with relatively low vibrational excitation energy, while indirect ones dominate the conversion from translational energy to high values of the vibrational counterpart.\n\nAtoms-for-Peace: A Galactic Collision in Action\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\n2010-11-01\n\nEuropean Southern Observatory astronomers have produced a spectacular new image of the famous Atoms-for-Peace galaxy (NGC 7252). This galactic pile-up, formed by the collision of two galaxies, provides an excellent opportunity for astronomers to study how mergers affect the evolution of the Universe. Atoms-for-Peace is the curious name given to a pair of interacting and merging galaxies that lie around 220 million light-years away in the constellation of Aquarius. It is also known as NGC 7252 and Arp 226 and is just bright enough to be seen by amateur astronomers as a very faint small fuzzy blob. This very deep image was produced by ESO's Wide Field Imager on the MPG/ESO 2.2-metre telescope at ESO's La Silla Observatory in Chile. A galaxy collision is one of the most important processes influencing how our Universe evolves, and studying them reveals important clues about galactic ancestry. Luckily, such collisions are long drawn-out events that last hundreds of millions of years, giving astronomers plenty of time to observe them. This picture of Atoms-for-Peace represents a snapshot of its collision, with the chaos in full flow, set against a rich backdrop of distant galaxies. The results of the intricate interplay of gravitational interactions can be seen in the shapes of the tails made from streams of stars, gas and dust. The image also shows the incredible shells that formed as gas and stars were ripped out of the colliding galaxies and wrapped around their joint core. While much material was ejected into space, other regions were compressed, sparking bursts of star formation. The result was the formation of hundreds of very young star clusters, around 50 to 500 million years old, which are speculated to be the progenitors of globular clusters. Atoms-for-Peace may be a harbinger of our own galaxy's fate. Astronomers predict that in three or four billion years the Milky Way and the Andromeda Galaxy will collide, much as has happened with Atoms-for-Peace.

Two time scales characterize the equilibration, one a short time, in which the isotropic energy distribution profile relaxes to a Maxwellian shape at some intermediate effective temperature, and the second, a longer time in which the relaxation preserves a Maxwellian distribution and its effective temperature decreases continuously to the bath gas temperature. The formation and preservation of a Maxwellian distribution does not depend on the projectile to bath gas atom mass ratio. This two-stage behavior arises due to the dominance of small angle scattering and small energy transfer in the collisions of neutral particles. Measurements of the evolving Doppler profiles of emission from excited initially energetic nitrogen atoms traversing bath gases of helium and argon confirm the theoretical predictions.\n\nTwo-Centre Convergent Close-Coupling Approach to Ion-Atom Collisions: Current Progress\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKadyrov, Alisher; Abdurakhmanov, Ilkhom; Bailey, Jackson; Bray, Igor\n\n2016-09-01\n\nThere are two versions of the convergent close-coupling (CCC) approach to ion-atom collisions: quantum-mechanical (QM-CCC) and semi-classical (SC-CCC). Recently, both implementations have been extended to include electron-transfer channels. The SC-CCC approach has been applied to study the excitation and the electron-capture processes in proton-hydrogen collisions. The integral alignment parameter A20 for polarization of Lyman- Î± emission and the cross sections for excitation and electron-capture into the lowest excited states have been calculated for a wide range of the proton impact energies. It has been established that for convergence of the results a very wide range of impact parameters (typically, 0-50 a.u.) is required due to extremely long tails of transition probabilities for transitions into the 2 p states at high energies. The QM-CCC approach allowed to obtain an accurate solution of proton-hydrogen scattering problem including all underlying processes, namely, direct scattering and ionisation, and electron capture into bound and continuum states of the projectile. In this presentation we give a general overview of current progress in applications of the two-centre CCC approach to ion-atom and atom-atom collisions.

The study is carried out by measuring doubly differential cross sections (DDCS) of emitted electrons for projectiles ranging from fluorine up to gold at ejection angles (theta _{L}) from 0^circ to 70^circ with respect to the beam direction. Prominent features are a very strong forward peaked angular distribution of emitted electrons and the appearance of strong diffraction structures in the binary encounter electron (BEe) region for projectiles heavier than chlorine. This is in clear contradiction to the results found with fluorine projectiles, where the BEe production increases slightly with increasing theta_{L} and no structure is observed in the BEe region. Both can be understood in the impulse approximation as elastic scattering of quasi free target electrons in the projectile potential. Our measurements also show that the violation of q ^2 scaling of the DDCS previously established for 0^circ electron spectra persists for all emission angles and almost all electron energies. In ion-atom collisions, besides electrons from target, electrons from projectile ionization are also presented in the emitted electron spectra. Using electron-projectile coincidence technique, different collision channels can be separated. In order to eliminate the speculations of contributions from projectile related capture and loss channels, coincidence studies of diffraction structures are initiated. In the 0^circ electron spectrum of 0.3 MeV/u I^{6+} impacting on H_2, strong autoionization peaks are observed on the shoulders of the cusp peak. The energies of these autoionization lines in the projectile rest frame are determined by high-resolution electron spectroscopy, and collision mechanism is probed by electron-charge state selected projectile coincidence technique.\n\nSelected bibliography on atomic collisions: Data collections, bibliographies, review articles, books, and papers of particular tutorial value\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nMcDaniel, E.W.; Flannery, M.R.; Thomas, E.W.\n\nThis bibliography deals mainly with binary and ternary collisions involving electrons, photons, and heavy particles (i.e., atoms, molecules, and ions). The energy range covered for each kind of collision is such that the interactions might be described as electronic, atomic, or chemical--higher-energy collisions involving nuclear forces are not treated. Also covered are particle and photon impact on surfaces, the passage of particles and radiation through bulk matter, and transport phenomena in gases. Practically all of the references cited are data compilations, other bibliographies, review articles, or books. The main objective is to provide easy access to atomic collision data, althoughmoreÂ Â» some references are included principally for their tutorial value.Â«Â less\n\nn l -> n' l' transition rates in electron and proton - Rydberg atom collision\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nVrinceanu, Daniel\n\n2017-04-01\n\nElectrons and protons drive the recombination dynamics of highly excited Rydberg atoms in cold rarefied plasmas found in astrophysical conditions such as primordial recombination or star formation in H-II clouds. It has been recognized that collisions induce both energy and angular momentum transitions in Rydberg atoms, although in different proportions, depending on the initial state, temperature and the given species considered in the collision (electron or proton). Most studies focused on one collision type at a time, under the assumption that collision types are independent or their effects are not competing. The classical Monte-Carlo trajectory simulations presented in this work calculate the rates for both energy and angular momentum transfers and show their interdependence. For example, energy transfer with small angular momentum change are more efficient for target states with initial large angular momentum.

Briggs's approximation is used to obtain the electron and positron wave functions. Since pair production involves high momentum transfer q from the moving projectile to the vacuum, use is made of a high-q approximation to greatly simplify the numerical computations. Coulomb deflection of the projectile, the effect of finite nuclear size on the elec- tronic wave functions, and the energy loss by the projectile exciting the pair are all taken into account in these calculations.\n\nElectronic excitation of ground state atoms by collision with heavy gas particles\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nHansen, C.

Therefore, this mechanism would be applicable to the case where a gas is initially at very low temperature suddenly subjected to high energy heavy particle bombardment. This situation would model the measurement of excitation cross section by molecular beam techniques, for example. The purpose is to report values of cross sections and rate coefficients for collision excitation of ground state atoms estimated with the Landau-Zener transition theory and to compare results with measurement of excitation cross sections for a beam of Hydrogen atoms impacting Argon atom targets. Some very dubious approximations are used, and the comparison with measurement is found less than ideal, but results are at least consistent within order of magnitude. The same model is then applied to the case of N-N atom collisions, even though the approximations then become even more doubtful. Still the rate coefficients obtained are at least plausible in both magnitude and functional form, and as far as I am aware these are the only estimates available for such rate coefficients.\n\nStudies of Rotationally and Vibrationally Inelastic Collisions of NaK with Atomic Perturbers\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nRichter, Kara M.\n\nThis dissertation discusses investigations of vibrationally and rotationally inelastic collisions of NaK with argon, helium and potassium as collision partners. We have investigated collisions of NaK molecules in the 2(A) 1Sigma+, state with argon and helium collision partners in a laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) experiment. The pump laser prepares the molecules in particular ro-vibrational (v, J) levels in the 2(A) 1Sigma+, state. These excited molecules then emit fluorescence as they make transitions back to the ground [2(X)1Sigma +] state, and this fluorescence is collected by a Bomem Fourier-transform spectrometer. Weak collisional satellite lines appear flanking strong, direct lines in the recorded spectra. These satellite lines are due to collisions of the NaK molecule in the 2(A)1Sigma+, state with noble gas and alkali atom perturbers, which carry population to nearby rotational levels [(v, J) â(v, J + DeltaJ)] or to various rotational levels of nearby vibrational levels, [(v, J)â (v + Deltav, J + DeltaJ)]. Ratios of the intensity of each collisional line to the intensity of the direct line then yields information pertaining to the transfer of population in the collision. Our results show a propensity for DeltaJ = even collisions of NaK with noble gas atoms, which is slightly more pronounced for collisions with helium than with argon. Such a DeltaJ = even propensity was not observed in the vibrationally inelastic collisions. Although it would be desirable to operate in the single collision regime, practical considerations make that difficult to achieve. Therefore, we have developed a method to estimate the effects of multiple collisions on our measured rate coefficients and have obtained approximate corrected values.\n\nTwo-body loss rates for reactive collisions of cold atoms\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nCop, C.; Walser, R.\n\n2018-01-01\n\nWe present an effective two-channel model for reactive collisions of cold atoms. It augments elastic molecular channels with an irreversible, inelastic loss channel. Scattering is studied with the distorted-wave Born approximation and yields general expressions for angular momentum resolved cross sections as well as two-body loss rates. Explicit expressions are obtained for piecewise constant potentials. A pole expansion reveals simple universal shape functions for cross sections and two-body loss rates in agreement with the Wigner threshold laws. This is applied to collisions of metastable 20Ne and 21Ne atoms, which decay primarily through exothermic Penning or associative ionization processes. From a numerical solution of the multichannel SchrÃ¶dinger equation using the best currently available molecular potentials, we have obtained synthetic scattering data. Using the two-body loss shape functions derived in this paper, we can match these scattering data very well.\n\nPREFACE: XXVIII International Conference on Photonic, Electronic and Atomic Collisions (ICPEAC 2013)\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nXiao, Guoqing; Cai, Xiaohong; Ding, Dajun; Ma, Xinwen; Zhao, Yongtao\n\n2014-04-01\n\nThe 28th International Conference on Photonic, Electronic and Atomic Collisions (XXVIII ICPEAC) was held by the Institute of Modern Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences (IMP) on 24-30 July, 2013 in Lanzhou, China. The 444 conference participants came from 37 countries and/or regions. Five plenary lectures, more than 80 progress reports and special reports had been arranged according to the decision of the ICPEAC International General Committee. Meanwhile, more than 650 abstracts were selected as poster presentations. Before the conference, three highly distinguished scientists, Professor Joachim BurgdÃ¶orfer, Professor Hossein Sadeghpour and Professor Yasunori Yamazaki, presented tutorial lectures with the support of the IMP Branch of Youth Innovation Promotion Association, CAS (IMP-YIPA). During the conference, Professor Jianwei Pan from University of Sciences and Technology in China presented an enlightening public lecture on quantum communication. Furthermore, 2013 IUPAP Young Scientist Prize was awarded to Dr T Jahnke from Johann Wolfgang Goethe University of Germany. The Sheldon Datz Prize for an Outstanding Young Scientist Attending ICPEAC was awarded to Dr Diogo Almeida from University of Fribourg of Switzerland. As a biannual academic conference, ICPEAC is one of the most important international conferences on atomic and molecular physics. The topic of the conference covers the recent progresses in photonic, electronic, atomic, ionic, molecular, cluster collisions with matter. With a history back to 1958, ICPEAC came to China for the very first time. IMP has been preparing the conference six years before, ever since the ICPEAC International General Committee made the decision to hold the XXVIII ICPEAC in Lanzhou. This proceedings includes the papers of the two plenary lectures, 40 progress reports, 17 special reports and 337 posters, which were reviewed and revised according to the comments of the referees. The Local Organizing Committee would like to\n\nAdiabatic Variational Theory for Cold Atom-Molecule Collisions: Application to a Metastable Helium Atom Colliding with ortho- and para-Hydrogen Molecules.\n\nPubMed\n\nPawlak, Mariusz; Shagam, Yuval; Klein, Ayelet; Narevicius, Edvardas; Moiseyev, Nimrod\n\n2017-03-16\n\nWe recently developed an adiabatic theory for cold molecular collision experiments. In our previous application of this theory ( Pawlak, M.; et al. J. Chem. Phys. 2015 , 143 , 074114 ), we assumed that during the experiment the collision of an atom with a diatom takes place when the diatom is in the ground rotational state and is located in a plane. In this paper, we present how the variational approach of the adiabatic theory for low-temperature collision experiments can be used for the study a 5D collision between the atom and the diatomic molecule with no limitations on its rotational quantum states and no plane restrictions. Moreover, we show here the dramatic differences in the measured reaction rates of He(2 3 S 1 ) + ortho/para-H 2 â He(1s 2 ) + ortho/para-H 2 + + e - resulting from the anisotropic long-range interactions in the reaction. In collisions of metastable helium with molecular hydrogen in the ground rotational state, the isotropic potential term dominates the dynamics. When the collision is with molecular hydrogen in the first excited rotational state, the nonisotropic interactions play an important role in the dynamics. The agreement of our results with the latest experimental findings ( Klein , A. ; et al. Nat. Phys. 2017 , 13 , 35 - 38 ) is very good.\n\nThe Effect of Intense Laser Radiation on Atomic Collisions\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nYoung, Stephen Michael Radley\n\n1991-02-01\n\nAvailable from UMI in association with The British Library. Requires signed TDF. We have carried out theoretical and experimental studies into the effect of intense laser radiation on atomic collisions. The first experiment used neon. Excitation by electron impact in a gas discharge demanded a pressure of at least 0.075 Torr. Measurement of the intensity of 3^1S_0to 3^1P_1 fluorescence has been made for the case where high intensity ASE wings in the laser profile and background laser scatter are unimportant, with the laser tuned to resonance. The field intensity required to produce strong field fluorescence (exemplified by the Mollow triplet) was found to give rise to complications capable of screening the effects sought. Our theoretical model has suggested that at finite detunings, line-centre fluorescence will dominate Rayleigh scatter and omega_3 fluorescence. Our measurements provide information on the saturation of neon fluorescence but not of the variation of the intense field collision rate. Absorption of weak field 253.7 nm laser photons by ground state mercury atoms yielded a high 6 ^3P_1 population at a lower pressure of 0.02 Torr. The Mollow triplet has been observed in the self-broadened mercury system. Dressing of the upper transition (6^3P_1rightarrow 7^3S_1) by an intense laser close to 435.8 nm yielded the strong field signal. Polarisation studies were made possible by the 3-level mercury system (radiation trapping in a 2-level system would depolarise fluorescence) perturbed by argon. The studies yielded results that were explainable in terms of the selective population of Stark shifted dressed states by a detuned, weak probe field. Use has been made of the electric-dipole radiation selection rule m_{J}=0 rightarrow m_{J^' } = 0 unless J=J^' to devise a 'Stark shift collision switch'. The competition between collision and radiation induced transitions within the mercury atom has then been studied. The resonant, strong lambda 435.8 nm field was used\n\nHyperfine excitation of CH in collisions with atomic and molecular hydrogen\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nDagdigian, Paul J.\n\n2018-04-01\n\nWe investigate here the excitation of methylidene (CH) induced by collisions with atomic and molecular hydrogen (H and H2). The hyperfine-resolved rate coefficients were obtained from close coupling nuclear-spin-free scattering calculations. The calculations are based upon recent, high-accuracy calculations of the CH(X2Î )-H(2S) and CH(X2Î )-H2 potential energy surfaces. Cross-sections and rate coefficients for collisions with atomic H, para-H2, and ortho-H2 were computed for all transitions between the 32 hyperfine levels for CH(X2Î ) involving the n â¤ 4 rotational levels for temperatures between 10 and 300 K. These rate coefficients should significantly aid in the interpretation of astronomical observations of CH spectra. As a first application, the excitation of CH is simulated for conditions in typical molecular clouds.\n\nQuantum-mechanical transport equation for atomic systems.\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nBerman, P. R.\n\n1972-01-01\n\nA quantum-mechanical transport equation (QMTE) is derived which should be applicable to a wide range of problems involving the interaction of radiation with atoms or molecules which are also subject to collisions with perturber atoms. The equation follows the time evolution of the macroscopic atomic density matrix elements of atoms located at classical position R and moving with classical velocity v. It is quantum mechanical in the sense that all collision kernels or rates which appear have been obtained from a quantum-mechanical theory and, as such, properly take into account the energy-level variations and velocity changes of the active (emitting or absorbing) atom produced in collisions with perturber atoms. The present formulation is better suited to problems involving high-intensity external fields, such as those encountered in laser physics.\n\nSix decades of atomic collisions in solids\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSigmund, Peter\n\n2017-09-01\n\nIn response to an invitation by the organizers of the 27th international conference on atomic collisions in solids, a brief survey is presented, starting from the roots of the field in the 1950s and 1960s, of some major discoveries, longstanding problems, surprising findings and memorable controversies in topics covered by the conference. Considering the breadth of the field, the selection of topics is necessarily subjective, but with the emphasis on channeling, stopping and sputtering, three topical areas are discussed which have been active from the early 1960s until now.\n\nModeling of Elastic Collisions between High Energy and Slow Neutral Atoms\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n2015-07-01\n\ncylindrical test cell, and the currents on the four different electrodes-Inner Cylinder , Exit Plate, Back Aperture, and Collector Plat~were measured...Inner Cylinder electrode.

A.\n\n1976-01-01\n\nSome selected papers presented at the Fourth International Conference on Beam-Foil Spectroscopy, whose results are of particular pertinence to ionic collision phenomena in solids, are reviewed. The topics discussed include solid target effects and means of surmounting them in the measurement of excited projectile ion lifetimes for low-energy heavy element ions; the electron emission accompanying the passage of heavy particles through solid targets; the collision broadening of X rays emitted from 100 keV ions moving in solids; residual K-shell excitation in chlorine ions penetrating carbon; comparison between 40 MeV Si on gaseous SiH4 targets at 300 mtorr and 40 MeV Si on Al; and the emergent surface interaction in beam-foil spectroscopy. A distinct overlap of interests between the sciences of beam-foil spectroscopy and atomic collisions in solids is pointed out.\n\nExotic objects of atomic physics\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nEletskii, A. V.\n\n2017-11-01\n\nThere has been presented a short survey of physical properties, methods of production and exploration as well as directions of practical usage of the objects of atomic physics which are not yet described in detail in modern textbooks and manuals intended for students of technical universities. The family of these objects includes negative and multicharged ions, Rydberg atoms, excimer molecules, clusters. Besides of that, in recent decades this family was supplemented with new nanocarbon structures such as fullerenes, carbon nanotubes and graphene. The textbook âExotic objects of atomic physicsâ [1] edited recently contains some information on the above-listed objects of the atomic physics. This textbook can be considered as a supplement to classic courses of atomic physics teaching in technical universities.\n\nProperties of atomic pairs produced in the collision of Bose-Einstein condensates\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nZiÅ, PaweÅ; Wasak, Tomasz\n\n2018-04-01\n\nDuring a collision of Bose-Einstein condensates correlated pairs of atoms are emitted. The scattered massive particles, in analogy to photon pairs in quantum optics, might be used in the violation of Bell's inequalities, demonstration of Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen correlations, or sub-shot-noise atomic interferometry. Usually, a theoretical description of the collision relies either on stochastic numerical methods or on analytical treatments involving various approximations. Here, we investigate elastic scattering of atoms from colliding elongated Bose-Einstein condensates within the Bogoliubov method, carefully controlling performed approximations at every stage of the analysis. We derive expressions for the one- and two-particle correlation functions. The obtained formulas, which relate the correlation functions to the condensate wave function, are convenient for numerical calculations. We employ the variational approach for condensate wave functions to obtain analytical expressions for the correlation functions, whose properties we analyze in detail. We also present a useful semiclassical model of the process and compare its results with the quantum one. The results are relevant for recent experiments with excited helium atoms, as well as for planned experiments aimed at investigating the nonclassicality of the system.\n\nAdvances in atomic physics: Four decades of contribution of the Cairo University - Atomic Physics Group.\n\nPubMed\n\nEl-Sherbini, Tharwat M\n\n2015-09-01\n\nIn this review article, important developments in the field of atomic physics are highlighted and linked to research works the author was involved in himself as a leader of the Cairo University - Atomic Physics Group.

The model is based on an extension of the ideas of Mahan and Heidrich, Wilson, and Rapp. Comparison of energy transfers computed from classical trajesctory calculations and the model proposed indicate good agreement when the mass of the free atom is small relative to the mass of the bound atom it strikes. The agreement is less satisfactory when that mass ratio becomes large.

Y.; Barros, Ana P.; Bilven, Francis L.\n\n2011-01-01\n\nA comprehensive raindrop collision outcome regime diagram that delineates the physical conditions associated with the outcome regimes (i.e., bounce, coalescence, and different breakup types) of binary raindrop collisions is proposed. The proposed diagram builds on a theoretical regime diagram defined in the phase space of collision Weber numbers We and the drop diameter ratio p by including critical angle of impact considerations. In this study, the theoretical regime diagram is first evaluated against a comprehensive dataset for drop collision experiments representative of raindrop collisions in nature. Subsequently, the theoretical regime diagram is modified to explicitly describe the dominant regimes of raindrop interactions in (We, p) by delineating the physical conditions necessary for the occurrence of distinct types of collision-induced breakup (neck/filament, sheet, disk, and crown breakups) based on critical angle of impact consideration. Crown breakup is a subtype of disk breakup for lower collision kinetic energy that presents distinctive morphology. Finally, the experimental results are analyzed in the context of the comprehensive collision regime diagram, and conditional probabilities that can be used in the parameterization of breakup kernels in stochastic models of raindrop dynamics are provided.\n\nPREFACE: 8th Asian International Seminar on Atomic and Molecular Physics (AISAMP)\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nWilliams, Jim F.; Buckman, Steve; Bieske, Evan J.\n\n2009-09-01\n\nThese proceedings arose from the 8th Asian International Seminar on Atomic and Molecular Physics (AISAMP) which was held at the University of Western Australia 24-28 November 2008. The history of AISAMP (Takayanagi and Matsuzawa 2002) recognizes its origin from the Japan-China meeting of 1985, and the first use of the name 'The First Asian International Seminar on Atomic and Molecular Physics (AISAMP)' in 1992. The initial attendees, Japan and China, were joined subsequently by scientists from Korea, Taiwan, India, Australia and recently by Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam, Turkey Iran, UK and USA. The main purpose of the biennial AISAMP series is to create a wide forum for exchanging ideas and information among atomic and molecular scientists and to promote international collaboration. The scope of the AISAMP8 meeting included pure, strategic and applied research involving atomic and molecular structure and processes in all forms of matter and antimatter. For 2008 the AISAMP conference incorporated the Australian Atomic and Molecular Physics and Quantum Chemistry meeting. The topics for AISAMP8 embraced themes from earlier AISAMP meetings and reflected new interests, in atomic and molecular structures, spectroscopy and collisions; atomic and molecular physics with laser or synchrotron radiation; quantum information processing using atoms and molecules; atoms and molecules in surface physics, nanotechnology, biophysics, atmospheric physics and other interdisciplinary studies. The implementation of the AISAMP themes, as well as the international representation of research interests, is indicated both in the contents list of these published manuscripts as well as in the program for the meeting. Altogether, 184 presentations were made at the 8th AISAMP, including Invited Talks and Contributed Poster Presentations, of which 60 appear in the present Proceedings after review by expert referees in accordance with the usual practice of Journal of Physics: Conference Series of\n\nPhysics through the 1990s: Atomic, molecular and optical physics\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\n1986-01-01\n\nThe volume presents a program of research initiatives in atomic, molecular, and optical physics. The current state of atomic, molecular, and optical physics in the US is examined with respect to demographics, education patterns, applications, and the US economy. Recommendations are made for each field, with discussions of their histories and the relevance of the research to government agencies. The section on atomic physics includes atomic theory, structure, and dynamics; accelerator-based atomic physics; and large facilities. The section on molecular physics includes spectroscopy, scattering theory and experiment, and the dynamics of chemical reactions. The section on optical physics discusses lasers, laser spectroscopy, and quantum optics and coherence. A section elucidates interfaces between the three fields and astrophysics, condensed matter physics, surface science, plasma physics, atmospheric physics, and nuclear physics. Another section shows applications of the three fields in ultra-precise measurements, fusion, national security, materials, medicine, and other topics.\n\nQuantum study of Eley-Rideal reaction and collision induced desorption of hydrogen atoms on a graphite surface. II. H-physisorbed case.\n\nPubMed\n\nMartinazzo, Rocco; Tantardini, Gian Franco\n\n2006-03-28\n\nFollowing previous investigation of collision induced (CI) processes involving hydrogen atoms chemisorbed on graphite [R. Martinazzo and G. F. Tantardini, J. Chem. Phys. 124, 124702 (2006)], the case in which the target hydrogen atom is initially physisorbed on the surface is considered here. Several adsorbate-substrate initial states of the target H atom in the physisorption well are considered, and CI processes are studied for projectile energies up to 1 eV. Results show that (i) Eley-Rideal cross sections at low collision energies may be larger than those found in the H-chemisorbed case but they rapidly decrease as the collision energy increases; (ii) product hydrogen molecules are vibrationally very excited; (iii) collision induced desorption cross sections rapidly increase, reaching saturation values greater than 10 A2; (iv) trapping of the incident atoms is found to be as efficient as the Eley-Rideal reaction at low energies and remains sizable (3-4 A2) at high energies. The latter adsorbate-induced trapping results mainly in formation of metastable hot hydrogen atoms, i.e., atoms with an excess energy channeled in the motion parallel to the surface. These atoms might contribute in explaining hydrogen formation on graphite.\n\nExcitation and charge transfer in low-energy hydrogen atom collisions with neutral iron\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBarklem, P. S.\n\n2018-05-01\n\nData for inelastic processes due to hydrogen atom collisions with iron are needed for accurate modelling of the iron spectrum in late-type stars. Excitation and charge transfer in low-energy Fe+H collisions is studied theoretically using a previously presented method based on an asymptotic two-electron linear combination of atomic orbitals model of ionic-covalent interactions in the neutral atom-hydrogen-atom system, together with the multi-channel Landau-Zener model. An extensive calculation including 166 covalent states and 25 ionic states is presented and rate coefficients are calculated for temperatures in the range 1000-20 000 K. The largest rates are found for charge transfer processes to and from two clusters of states around 6.3 and 6.6 eV excitation, corresponding in both cases to active 4d and 5p electrons undergoing transfer. Excitation and de-excitation processes among these two sets of states are also significant. Full Tables and rate coefficient data are only available at the CDS via anonymous ftp to cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr (130.79.128.5) or via http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/qcat?J/A+A/612/A90\n\nRotationally inelastic collisions of excited NaK and NaCs molecules with noble gas and alkali atom perturbers.\n\nPubMed\n\nJones, J; Richter, K; Price, T J; Ross, A J; Crozet, P; Faust, C; Malenda, R F; Carlus, S; Hickman, A P; Huennekens, J\n\n2017-10-14\n\nWe report measurements of rate coefficients at T â 600 K for rotationally inelastic collisions of NaK molecules in the 2(A) 1 Î£ + electronic state with helium, argon, and potassium atom perturbers. Several initial rotational levels J between 14 and 44 were investigated. Collisions involving molecules in low-lying vibrational levels (v = 0, 1, and 2) of the 2(A) 1 Î£ + state were studied using Fourier-transform spectroscopy. Collisions involving molecules in a higher vibrational level, v = 16, were studied using pump/probe, optical-optical double resonance spectroscopy. In addition, polarization spectroscopy measurements were carried out to study the transfer of orientation in these collisions. Many, but not all, of the measurements were carried out in the \"single-collision regime\" where more than one collision is unlikely to occur within the lifetime of the excited molecule. The analysis of the experimental data, which is described in detail, includes an estimate of effects of multiple collisions on the reported rate coefficients. The most significant result of these experiments is the observation of a strong propensity for ÎJ = even transitions in collisions involving either helium or argon atoms; the propensity is much stronger for helium than for argon. For the initial rotational levels studied experimentally, almost all initial orientation is preserved in collisions of NaK 2(A) 1 Î£ + molecules with helium. Roughly between 1/3 and 2/3 of the orientation is preserved in collisions with argon, and almost all orientation is destroyed in collisions with potassium atoms. Complementary measurements on rotationally inelastic collisions of NaCs 2(A) 1 Î£ + with argon do not show a ÎJ = even propensity. The experimental results are compared with new theoretical calculations of collisions of NaK 2(A) 1 Î£ + with helium and argon.

The work of Aaron Temkin was particularly influential on our own during the development of the CCC method for electron-atom collisions. There are a number of key problems that need to be dealt with when developing a general computational approach to such collisions. Traditionally, the electron energy range was subdivided into the low, intermediate, and high energies. At the low energies only a finite number of channels are open and variational or close-coupling techniques could be used to obtain accurate results. At high energies an infinite number of discrete channels and the target continuum are open, but perturbative techniques are able to yield accurate results. However, at the intermediate energies perturbative techniques fail and computational approaches need to be found for treating the infinite number of open channels. In addition, there are also problems associated with the identical nature of electrons and the difficulty of implementing the boundary conditions for ionization processes. The beauty of the Temkin-Poet model of electron-hydrogen scattering is that it simplifies the full computational problem by neglecting any non-zero orbital angular momenta in the partial-wave expansion, without loosing the complexity associated with the above-mentioned problems. The unique nature of the problem allowed for accurate solution leading to benchmark results which could then be used to test the much more general approaches to electron-atom collision problems. The immense value of the Temkin-Poet model is readily summarised by the fact that the initial papers of Temkin and Poet have been collectively cited around 250 times to date and are still being cited in present times. Many of the citations came from our own work during the course of the development of the CCC method, which we now describe.\n\nA screened independent atom model for the description of ion collisions from atomic and molecular clusters\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLÃ¼dde, Hans JÃ¼rgen; Horbatsch, Marko; Kirchner, Tom\n\n2018-05-01\n\nWe apply a recently introduced model for an independent-atom-like calculation of ion-impact electron transfer and ionization cross sections to proton collisions from water, neon, and carbon clusters. The model is based on a geometrical interpretation of the cluster cross section as an effective area composed of overlapping circular disks that are representative of the atomic contributions. The latter are calculated using a time-dependent density-functional-theory-based single-particle description with accurate exchange-only ground-state potentials. We find that the net capture and ionization cross sections in p-X n collisions are proportional to n Î± with 2/3 â¤ Î± â¤ 1. For capture from water clusters at 100 keV impact energy Î± is close to one, which is substantially different from the value Î± = 2/3 predicted by a previous theoretical work based on the simplest-level electron nuclear dynamics method. For ionization at 100 keV and for capture at lower energies we find smaller Î± values than for capture at 100 keV. This can be understood by considering the magnitude of the atomic cross sections and the resulting overlaps of the circular disks that make up the cluster cross section in our model. Results for neon and carbon clusters confirm these trends. Simple parametrizations are found which fit the cross sections remarkably well and suggest that they depend on the relevant bond lengths.\n\nSpectroscopy and atomic physics of highly ionized Cr, Fe, and Ni for tokamak plasmas\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nFeldman, U.; Doschek, G. A.; Cheng, C.-C.; Bhatia, A. K.\n\n1980-01-01\n\nThe paper considers the spectroscopy and atomic physics for some highly ionized Cr, Fe, and Ni ions produced in tokamak plasmas. Forbidden and intersystem wavelengths for Cr and Ni ions are extrapolated and interpolated using the known wavelengths for Fe lines identified in solar-flare plasmas. Tables of transition probabilities for the B I, C I, N I, O I, and F I isoelectronic sequences are presented, and collision strengths and transition probabilities for Cr, Fe, and Ni ions of the Be I sequence are given. Similarities of tokamak and solar spectra are discussed, and it is shown how the atomic data presented may be used to determine ion abundances and electron densities in low-density plasmas.\n\nStudies of Highly Excited Atoms.\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n1986-04-02\n\nR 2 o i86 Chemical Physics Laboratory \" i 0.

By applying the deceleration mode of the ESR storage ring, we studied this process in low-energy collisions of bare uranium ions with low- Z target atoms. This technique allows us to extend the current information about photoionization to much lower energies than those accessible for neutral heavy elements in the direct reaction channel. The results prove that for high- Z systems, higher-order multipole contributions and magnetic corrections persist even at energies close to the threshold.\n\nRelativistic Collisions of Highly-Charged Ions\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nIonescu, Dorin; Belkacem, Ali\n\n1998-11-19\n\nThe physics of elementary atomic processes in relativistic collisions between highly-charged ions and atoms or other ions is briefly discussed, and some recent theoretical and experimental results in this field are summarized. They include excitation, capture, ionization, and electron-positron pair creation. The numerical solution of the two-center Dirac equation in momentum space is shown to be a powerful nonperturbative method for describing atomic processes in relativistic collisions involving heavy and highly-charged ions. By propagating negative-energy wave packets in time the evolution of the QED vacuum around heavy ions in relativistic motion is investigated. Recent results obtained from numerical calculations usingmoreÂ Â» massively parallel processing on the Cray-T3E supercomputer of the National Energy Research Scientific Computer Center (NERSC) at Berkeley National Laboratory are presented.Â«Â less\n\nLow energy collisions of spin-polarized metastable argon atoms with ground state argon atoms\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nTaillandier-Loize, T.; Perales, F.; Baudon, J.; Hamamda, M.; Bocvarski, V.; Ducloy, M.; Correia, F.; Fabre, N.; Dutier, G.\n\n2018-04-01\n\nThe collision between a spin-polarized metastable argon atom in Ar* (3p54s, 3P2, M = +2) state slightly decelerated by the Zeeman slower-laser technique and a co-propagating thermal ground state argon atom Ar (3p6, 1S0), both merged from the same supersonic beam, but coming through adjacent slots of a rotating disk, is investigated at the center of mass energies ranging from 1 to 10 meV. The duration of the laser pulse synchronised with the disk allows the tuning of the relative velocity and thus the collision energy. At these sub-thermal energies, the âresonant metastability transferâ signal is too small to be evidenced. The explored energy range requires using indiscernibility amplitudes for identical isotopes to have a correct interpretation of the experimental results. Nevertheless, excitation transfers are expected to increase significantly at much lower energies as suggested by previous theoretical predictions of potentials 2g(3P2) and 2u(3P2). Limits at ultra-low collisional energies of the order of 1 mK (0.086 Î¼eV) or less, where gigantic elastic cross sections are expected, will also be discussed. The experimental method is versatile and could be applied using different isotopes of Argon like 36Ar combined with 40Ar, as well as other rare gases among which Krypton should be of great interest thanks to the available numerous isotopes present in a natural gas mixture.\n\nPREFACE: XXIX International Conference on Photonic, Electronic, and Atomic Collisions (ICPEAC2015)\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nDÃ­az, C.; RabadÃ¡n, I.; GarcÃ­a, G.; MÃ©ndez, L.; MartÃ­n, F.\n\n2015-09-01\n\nThe 29th International Conference on Photonic, Electronic and Atomic Collisions (XXIX ICPEAC) was held at the Palacio de Congresos ''El Greco'', Toledo, Spain, on 22-28 July, 2015, and was organized by the Universidad AutÃ³noma de Madrid (UAM) and the Consejo Superior de Investigaciones CientÃ­ficas (CSIC). ICPEAC is held biannually and is one of the most important international conferences on atomic and molecular physics. The topic of the conference covers the recent progresses in photonic, electronic, and atomic collisions with matter. With a history back to 1958, ICPEAC came to Spain in 2015 for the very first time. UAM and CSIC had been preparing the conference for six years, ever since the ICPEAC International General Committee made the decision to hold the XXIX ICPEAC in Toledo. The conference gathered 670 participants from 52 countries and attracted 854 contributed papers for presentation in poster sessions. Among the latter, 754 are presented in issues 2-12 of this volume of the Journal of Physics Conference Series. In addition, five plenary lectures, including the opening one by the Nobel laureate Prof. Ahmed H. Zewail and the lectures by Prof. Maciej Lewenstein, Prof. Paul Scheier, Prof. Philip H. Bucksbaum, and Prof. Stephen J. Buckman, 62 progress reports and 26 special reports were presented following the decision of the ICPEAC International General Committee. Detailed write-ups of most of the latter are presented in issue 1 of this volume, constituting a comprehensive tangible record of the meeting. On the occasion of the International Year of Light (IYL2015) and with the support of the FundaciÃ³n EspaÃ±ola para la Ciencia y la TecnologÃ­a (FECYT), the program was completed with two public lectures delivered by the Nobel laureate Prof. Serge Haroche and the PrÃ­ncipe de Asturias laureate Prof. Pedro M. Echenique on, respectively, ''Fifty years of laser revolutions in physics'rquot; and ''The sublime usefulness of useless science''.

For the first time experimentally, the outcome of collision events during convergent transcription by two identical RNAP has been studied. Measurement of the positions of the RNAP on the DNA, allows distinction of open promoter complexes (OPCs) and elongating complexes (EC) and collided complexes (CC). This discontinuous time-course enables subsequent analysis of collision events where both RNAP remain bound on the DNA. After collision, the elongating RNAP has caused the other (usually stalled) RNAP to back-track along the template. The final positions of the two RNAP indicate that these are collisions between an EC and a stalled EC (SEC) or OPC (previously referred to as sitting-ducks). Interestingly, the distances between the two RNAP show that they are not always at closest approach after âcollisionâ has caused their arrest.

Both the total and partial cross sections are reported for the collision of C6+ ions with atomic and molecular hydrogen. A comparison with other theoretical and experimental results shows, in general good agreement except at very low energy, considered here. For H2, the one- and two-electron charge exchange cross sections are calculated and compared with other theoretical and experimental results. Small but non-negligible isotope effects are found at the lowest energy studied in the charge transfer of C6+ with H. In low energy region, it is observed that H2 has larger isotope effects than H atom due to the polarizability effect which is larger than the mass effect.\n\nElectron loss from hydrogen-like highly charged ions in collisions with electrons, protons and light atoms\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLyashchenko, K. N.; Andreev, O. Yu; Voitkiv, A. B.\n\n2018-03-01\n\nWe consider electron loss from a hydrogen-like highly charged ion (HCI) in relativistic collisions with hydrogen and helium in the range of impact velocities v min â¤ v â¤ v max (v min and v max correspond to the threshold energy Îµ th for electron loss in collisions with a free electron and to â5 Îµ th, respectively) where any reliable data for loss cross sections are absent. In this range, where the loss process is characterized by large momentum transfers, we express it in terms of electron loss in collisions with equivelocity protons and electrons and explore by performing a detailed comparative study of these subprocesses. Our results, in particular, show that: (i) compared to equivelocity electrons protons are more effective in inducing electron loss, (ii) the relative effectiveness of electron projectiles grows with increase in the atomic number of a HCI, (iii) collisions with protons and electrons lead to a qualitatively different population of the final-state-electron momentum space and even when the total loss cross sections in these collisions become already equal the spectra of the outgoing electrons still remain quite different in almost the entire volume of the final-state-electron momentum space, (iv) in collisions with hydrogen and helium the contributions to the loss process from the interactions with the nucleus and the electron(s) of the atom could be rather well separated in a substantial part of the final-state-electron momentum space.\n\nChapter 6 Quantum Mechanical Methods for Loss-Excitation and Loss-Ionization in Fast Ion-Atom Collisions\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBelkic, Dzevad\n\nquantum mechanical perturbation theories applied to electron loss collisions involving two hydrogen-like atoms. Both the one- and two-electron transitions (target unaffected by collision, as well as loss-ionization) are thoroughly examined in various intervals of impact energies varying from the threshold via the Massey peak to the Bethe asymptotic region. Systematics are established for the fast, simple, and accurate computations of cross sections for loss-excitation and loss-ionization accounting for the entire spectra of all four particles, including two free electrons and two free protons. The expounded algorithmic strategy of quantum mechanical methodologies is of great importance for wide applications to particle transport physics, especially in fusion research and hadron radiotherapy. This should advantageously replace the current overwhelming tendency in these fields for using phenomenological modeling with artificial functions extracted from fitting the existing experimental/theoretical data bases for cross sections.\n\nThe Underlying Physics in Wetted Particle Collisions\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nDonahue, Carly; Hrenya, Christine; Davis, Robert\n\n2008-11-01\n\nWetted granular particles are relevant in many industries including the pharmaceutical and chemical industries and has applications to granulation, filtration, coagulation, spray coating, drying and pneumatic transport. In our current focus, we investigate the dynamics of a three-body normal wetted particle collision. In order to conduct collisions we use an apparatus called a ``Stokes Cradle,'' similar to the Newton's Cradle (desktop toy) except that the target particles are covered with oil. Here, we are able to vary the oil thickness, oil viscosity, and material properties. With a three particle collision there are four possible outcomes: fully agglomerated (FA); Newton's Cradle (NC), the striker and the first target ball are agglomerated and the last target ball is separated; Reverse Newton's Cradle (RNC), the striker is separated and the two targets are agglomerated; and fully separated (FS). Varying the properties of the collisions, we have observed all four outcomes. We use elastohydrodynamics as a theoretical basis for modeling the system. We also have considered the glass transition of the oil as the pressure increases upon impact and the cavitation of the oil as the pressure drops below the vapor pressure upon rebound. A toy model has been developed where the collision is modeled as a series of two-body collisions. A qualitative agreement between the toy model and experiments gives insight into the underlying physics.\n\nIon-neutral chemistry at ultralow energies:Dynamics of reactive collisions between laser-cooled Ca+ or Ba+ ions and Rb atoms in an ion-atom hybrid trap\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nDulieu, O.; Hall, F. H. J.; Eberle, P.; Hegi, G.; Raoult, M.; Aymar, M.; Willitsch, S.\n\n2013-05-01\n\nCold chemical reactions between laser-cooled Ca+ or Ba+ ions and Rb atoms were studied in an ion-atom hybrid trap. Reaction rate constants were determined in the collision energy range Ecoll /kB = 20 mK-20 K. Product branching ratios were studied using resonant-excitation mass spectrometry. The dynamics of the reactive processes including the radiative formation of CaRb+ and BaRb+ molecular ions has been analyzed using accurate potential energy curves and quantum-scattering calculations for the radiative channels. It is shown that the energy dependence of the reaction rates is governed by long-range interactions, while its magnitude is determined by short-range non-adiabatic and radiative couplings. The quantum character of the collisions is predicted to manifest itself in the occurrence of narrow shape resonances at well-defined collision energies. The present results highlight both universal and system-specific phenomena in cold ion-neutral collisions.
