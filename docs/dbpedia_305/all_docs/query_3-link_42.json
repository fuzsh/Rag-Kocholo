The aim of the study is to identify the features of the Korean paremiological units usage in English-language political media texts. To solve the tasks set in the work, the following research methods were used: communicative-pragmatic analysis based on the interpretation of the meaning and functions of proverbs within the context of a contextual situation; comparative analysis of paroemias in the context of interlanguage communication. To determine the role of paremiological units in the political texts in the communication process, elements of discursive analysis were also applied. The scientific novelty of the study is determined by the fact that the functions of Korean proverbs are for the first time analyzed in the context of the English-speaking modern Internet media of South Korea. The development of the methodology for analyzing the functioning of the communicative and pragmatic functions of Korean proverbs in political mass media discourse should also be mentioned. According to the results, depending on the context, Korean proverbs in English-language media texts, performing a wide range of general linguistic and grammatical functions, are rarely used as exclusively directive statements. Based on the discursive situation and the personal intention of the author in highlighting a certain level of content of the proverb, the paremia can perform various functions. The multifunctionality of Korean proverbs allows the author to influence the reader regardless of belonging to the culture of the country. The research materials can be used to expand the content of practical courses for students of philological and linguistic specializations of universities, in applied educational activities.\n\nKeywords: cultural code, mass media, discursive analysis, English-language media texts, political discourse, communication, communicative and pragmatic functions, communicative linguistics, Korean proverbs, paremias\n\nReferences:\n\nPermiakov, G.

The purpose of this study is to study the linguistic means of forming the image of the head of a foreign state, who receives representation on the pages of The New York Times. The subject of the study is the lexical and semantic field (LSF) of Personal Names as a model of representation of knowledge about the leader of a foreign state, as well as the contexts of the linguistic implementation of the core of the studied LSF. The main objectives of the study included the study of the structure and composition of the lexico-semantic field of Personal Names, as well as concordance analysis of the contexts of the linguistic implementation of the Personal Names LSF core. The research material is presented by The New York Times newspaper's 2019 issues of articles about Brazil. Using the method of corpus analysis of the texts of articles using the Wmatrix computer program made it possible to identify the lexical and semantic field of Personal Names in the structure of the cognitive matrix Brazil. Concordance analysis of the contexts of the linguistic implementation of the Bolsonaro lexical unit allowed us to identify 3 leading typical arguments that are formed by the newspaper around the name of the politician. The novelty of the study lies in the choice of the material and the subject of the study: the image of President Jair Bolsonaro in the American media has not been studied by linguists to date. The results of the study showed that the image of a politician is formed, among other things, by building contextual connections between the core of the lexico-semantic field under study and the units that make up the structure of this field, while the majority of lexical units relate to figures of political figures in Brazil and foreign countries who do not support the policy of J. Bolsonaro. The nature of the typical arguments identified by examining the concordance of the core of the studied LSF allows us to confirm that the image of this politician, formed by The New York Times newspaper, tends to be negatively biased. Readers are being shown the image of Jair Bolsonaro as a politician advocating the disappearance of the Amazon forests, being an ultra-right populist and not supporting the rights of the indigenous peoples of Brazil.\n\nKeywords: media image, lexical-semantic field, concordance, cognitive matrix, Jair Bolsonaro, Brazil, American media, president, Personal Names, The New York Times\n\nReferences:\n\nBoldyrev, N.

The purpose of the work is to study the impact of technology on modern sports journalism.\n\nThe general scientific descriptive-analytical method and comparative method were used as the main research method.

Writers of journalistic works on modern video hosting sites rely heavily on visual images to fully reveal the topic. The ability to work with editing and sound accompaniment becomes an important skill for a film critic. The subject of the research is non-verbal means of transmitting information in audiovisual essays. The origins and features of the genre that originated from the printed essay are analyzed. The definition of the phenomenon of \"transimagery\" is given, which implies the emergence of new images on the basis of existing ones. The content of narrative and poetic videos on the Every Frame a Painting channel is considered in detail. The relevance of the study is due to the growing popularity of the phenomenon of the audiovisual essay and the low level of knowledge of this genre of film criticism. The novelty lies in the fact that the video essay is a relatively young genre. There is a lack of studies both in foreign and domestic scientific practice. Our article offers a theoretical understanding of the features of an audiovisual essay. It is concluded that the unique features of the video essay cannot be reproduced in traditional textual forms of film criticism. The creation of new visual images contributes to the possibility of explaining phenomena that could not be explained in the form of text. The results of the study can be used by scientists in the field of mass communication, journalism and film criticism.\n\nKeywords: new media, editing, film criticism, film journalism, Internet, visual images, video, audiovisual essays, online media, journalism\n\nReferences:\n\nGlazkova, E.A.

The purpose of the work is to give definitions of the concepts of image and PR texts in the modern media space, to determine their similarities and differences through content and discourse analysis of materials of scientific periodicals.\n\nSocio-political, social and economic media texts in the Russian media space have many distinctive linguistic and non-linguistic features due to the national specifics and social development of our country. Reputation is often formed not only by image media texts, but also by a number of other types of texts represented in mass media with image potential. The scientific novelty of the study lies in the fact that with the existing problem of typologization of media texts, the hypothesis is introduced that PR texts in their broad sense are nothing more than a subgroup of image media texts present in the media field of the main spheres – journalism, advertising and PR activities.\n\nThe author comes to the conclusion that the instability and dynamism of the terminological apparatus gives a certain \"freedom\" of action when selecting research material. The ways in which image specialists work and the genre nature of image media texts themselves have become much more complicated. Image media texts can be considered as journalistic text, advertising text, PR text.\n\nKeywords: media consumer, genres, typology of the text, public opinion, media space, PR text, media text, image, look, Media\n\nReferences:\n\nPocheptsov, G.

They began due to the social and economic crisis. According to the Cuban government, the crisis was caused by sanctions from the USA. On the other hand, the opposition considers that it is the consequence of the communist dictatorship reigning in the country. The authors of the article set themselves the goal of investigating media interpretations of the events as in the traditional media controlled by the state, and in the specific social and communication environment of the Internet space. Having analyzed the publications of the largest Cuban mass media, such as the newspaper «Granma» and portal «Cubadabate», as well as the materials of social networks, the authors have come to the conclusion that the massive spread of the Internet in 2018 marked the beginning of gradual changes in the media landscape of the country: social media have become an alternative source of information that has influenced the Cuban social and political life. They have served as social organizers not only online but also offline when having the popularity and taking a new platform for the promotion of anti-government ideas. One of the examples of its phenomenon were the protests on July 11, 2021, which have become a new challenge to the political leadership of a country that has been fighting the US economic blockade for decades.\n\nKeywords: political communication, social networks, media, Cuban media, Cuba, online media, citizen journalism, state media, protests, Twitter\n\nReferences:\n\nEstudio Económico de América Latina y el Caribe (2021).

The selected material includes publications of a social network banned in the Russian Federation for promoting Instagram photos. For the study, the authors selected three thematically representative accounts (the total number of subscribers is 600 thousand) and five materials containing information about the success stories of various celebrities. The subject side of the analysis includes narrative functions (motives) that can be found in these publications. The relevance of this work lies in the manipulative power of the above-mentioned materials and their ability to bring a person into an active motivated state. It is noted that such materials can carry a psychological and terrapeutic function for the viewer. The methodological basis is the narrative theory of V.Y. Propp, which assumes the decomposition of the material into invariant composite blocks necessary for the construction of a media story.\n\nThe scientific novelty of the research lies in the need for the presence of such content in the media space. Since the authors of the study provide a universal set of mandatory narrative matrices, bloggers, firstly, get the opportunity to save time when creating publications, and secondly, they get the opportunity to bring the audience into an active motivated state through the success story of a famous personality.\n\nAmong the most important conclusions, the authors note the exceptional popularity of the narrative motives of departure, struggle, transfiguration, victory and accession (wedding). They contain the main elements of the narrative. Similarly, the authors note that differences in the creation of materials (videos, texts, illustrative material) do not affect the interest of viewers and do not exclude the above-mentioned fairy-tale motives. Consequently, due to the fact that such materials are highly popular, the authors claim that they have an important social function.\n\nKeywords: medianarrative, manipulation, motivation, publication, content, media, fairytale, narrative, motivation content, invariant\n\nReferences:\n\nCyberLenink.

In this article, based on the analysis of the comments of users of the social network, an assumption is made about the reflection in them of a threat to the integrity of society. The Macedonian social media space was chosen as a case for monitoring, the subject of interest was Internet comments on representatives of the Albanian ethnic minority of the Republic of North Macedonia. The relationship between representatives of two ethnic groups (Albanians and Macedonians) has a conflict background and conflict potential. Based on the results of the analysis of the corpus of verbal data, the author formulated assumptions about the role of Internet commentary in reflecting the mood of society and its potency as one of the conditions in the development of the Albanian-Macedonian conflict, which is currently in a latent phase. On the one hand, comments left on social networks have a significant destructive potential within the framework of the described case; on the other hand, they have constructive potency, since the space of social networks becomes a kind of substitute in relation to the physical space and makes it possible to keep a possible conflict at the level of rejection in Internet comments, not allowing it to \"get out outside.\"\n\nKeywords: Macedonia, Republic of North Macedonia, destructive content, Macedonian media, media, online commentary, social network, ethno conflict, ethnic groups, public relations\n\nReferences:\n\nMityagina, V.A.

Theoretical foundations are given, approaches to the definition of these concepts are briefly described. The study uses descriptive, informative, comparative and structural-functional methods to solve a scientific problem. The research material was the works of Russian, American, British, Spanish, Turkish and Chinese scientists from 2011-2023. The most common, frequently cited and used definitions were selected for the review. The author of the article draws attention to the terminological uncertainty in the field under study, identifies the problems associated with defining the boundaries of the concept of \"interactive documentaries\", highlights the most promising aspects in identifying the characteristics of this new phenomenon and outlines directions for further research. As a result of the research, the author comes to the conclusion that due to the multimodality, complexity, openness and dynamism of the form of interactive documentaries, it would be appropriate to designate this phenomenon as a meta-genre. The proposed research lays the prerequisites for further search for the most accurate definition of interactive documentaries, corresponding to the current level of media development, accumulated theoretical and creative experience.\n\nKeywords: multimedia, hybrid media, interactivity, new media, interactive documentary film, web-doc, i-docs, web documentary, interactive documentary, meta-genre\n\nReferences:\n\nAmirkhanova, G.

The author examines the key parameters of the credit policy through the prism of their coverage in specialized media texts from the point of view of lexical and semantic meanings. The subject of the study is the peculiarities of understanding the main lexical-semantic units (words and phrases) denoting the criteria and parameters of banking activities related to credit policy, the key concepts of the credit and financial sphere, which constitute the main content of media texts as a terminological and categorical apparatus, are required to be used, when promoting banking credit products, but require clarification for a mass audience in connection with the need to minimize credit risks.\n\nThe article shows how semantic frames are formed, the most important thematic sections are systematized and keywords and expressions are suggested, including the terminological sphere. The most significant semantic positions have been identified and it has been determined that thematically framed textual media accompaniment, focused on the promotion of lending services, reduction of credit risks and credit information education of the audience, is becoming a critical condition for effective media management in the banking sector today. It has been determined that the media information policy of the bank, related to the text support of lending, should be based on the interpretation of key concepts, their intelligible explanation to the mass audience.\n\nKeywords: interpretation, mass audience, promotion, meaning, vocabulary, frame, credit risks, media information policy, bank lending, media support\n\nReferences:\n\nLazutina, G.

It is directly related to ensuring national security. One of the most important problems of our time is related to the fact that culture in the media has ceased to be a powerful tool for shaping the value system of society.\n\nThe article analyzes stories published during the period from December 2022 to May 2023 in the thirteen most cited Russiabn media (Rbc.ru, Russian.rt.com, Gazeta.ru, Lenta.ru, 360tv.ru, Kp.ru, Tsargrad.tv, iz.ru, Life.ru, Mk.ru, Aif .ru, Fontanka.ru, Mosregtoday.ru).\n\nApproximately 2,000 stories related to the topic of \"culture\" in these media were analyzed. The stories were analyzed for compliance with the culture-forming function, which consists in promoting and disseminating high cultural values in society, educating the masses on samples of global culture, contributing to the comprehensive humanistic development of man.\n\nThe authors come to the conclusion that 1) samples of high, elite culture rarely come to the attention of the media. In stories on cultural topics, gossip, rumors, events from the life of show business stars are replicated. 2) On some media sites, there is no “culture” section at all. In the field of view of the reader who goes to the websites, cultural news rarely falls. 3) The same names appear in the news about culture, famous personalities from the world of show business predominate, and there is not a word about new, young, talented artists. 4) Culture on media sites covers large-scale events, Hollywood premieres, but news about regional festivals, the achievements of creative individuals, and folk crafts rarely get into the headings. 5) Culture on media sites is being replaced by entertainment.\n\nKeywords: Cultural agenda, Functions of journalism, Functions of the Russian media, culture-forming function of the journalism, Society's value system, Quality journalism, Cultural and educational journalism, Culture and the media, Cultural stories, Problems of Russian media\n\nReferences:\n\nBaranova, E.A.

The object of the research is creative industries as a subject of journalistic creativity.\n\nIn our country, there is an increasing interest in the field of creative industries, as a sector of the economy that has high development opportunities. In this regard, the role of journalism is also increasing, which not only informs readers about this area, but also attracts the attention of investors, the state, and business to it. Therefore, an effective presentation of the topic of creative industries on the pages of the media is a fairly new and urgent task for both federal and regional communities. Moscow and the Khanty-Mansi Autonomous Okrug – Yugra are currently examples of successful development of the creative industries in the country. The article analyzes the materials published in the newspapers \"Evening Moscow\", \"Arguments and Facts\", \"News of Ugra\" and \"Arguments and Facts – Ugra\" from October 2022 to May 2023.\n\nThe authors come to the conclusion that 1) in the federal media, when choosing a genre, preference is given to such a genre as news, the main goal is to entertain the reader, to demonstrate the level of support for local initiatives by the authorities. 2). In the district media, on the contrary, creative industries are often covered in the genre of reportage, immersing the reader in a creative atmosphere, familiarity occurs not only with the product, but also with the process of its creation, with the emotions that interaction with the product gives. 3). In the federal media, there is a tendency to focus on the consumer properties of the creative product, the profitability indicators of the project, the possibilities of using the product in a new area, compliance with trends. 4). There is a tendency in the district media to increase interest in local projects that are based on historical and cultural heritage and art.\n\nKeywords: creative projects, creativity and journalism, subjects of creative industries, topical issues of journalism, regional journalism, cultural and educational journalism, quality journalism, culture and journalism, functions of journalism, creative industries\n\nReferences:\n\nBelkovskiy, S.

The object of the research is the media management of corporate media of universities as a tool of public relations among students, graduates and potential applicants. The authors consider in detail such aspects of the topic as ways of forming an individual profile of a particular media outlet, as well as its contribution to the image of a particular university. Particular attention is paid to the formation of the content of university media and their interaction with the traditional media system, as well as options for their development in a broader media profile. The main conclusions of the study are the data obtained during the comparison of Ivy League university press samples on the patterns of formation of the image of a typical student and a graduate of a university. A special contribution of the authors to the research of the topic is the development of specific recommendations on the media management of corporate publications on the example of the university press, which can be applied in domestic practice. The novelty of the research lies in the generalization of the media practices of the university press of the USA and the formulation of recommendations for creating the image of a student, graduate and teacher on the pages of the university press. Also of particular interest is the practice of creating a modern convergent media based on the traditional format of the press that has existed since the XIX century.\n\nKeywords: public relations, convergent edition, covergent mass media, student mass media, Ivy League, USA press, mediamanagement, image, corporate press, university press\n\nReferences:\n\nColumbia Magazine Retrieved from: https://magazine.columbia.edu/ (Accessed 05/10/2023)\n\nHarvard Business Review Retrieved from: https://hbr.org/ (Accessed 05/10/2023)\n\nPenn Today Retrieved from: https://penntoday.upenn.edu/ (Accessed 05/10/2023)\n\nThe Cornell Daily Sun Retrieved from: https://cornellsun.com/ (Accessed 05/10/2023)\n\nThe Daily Princetonian Retrieved from: https://www.dailyprincetonian.com/ (Accessed 05/10/2023)\n\nYale News Retrieved from: https://news.yale.edu/ (Accessed 05/10/2023)\n\nBitton J.

Tolstoy. The method of complex analysis of the literary text allowed the authors of the scientific work to identify words, phrases, sentences, the semantics of which are most significant for understanding the essence of Alexey Tolstoy’s article. To designate these ideological and semantic \"staples\" of any fiction or journalistic text, the authors of this study introduce a scientific definition of \"lexico-semantic milestones\" for the first time in linguoculturology. The authors determined the structure of the article \"Homeland\", revealed the genre originality of each of the three parts of the text. The results of the work on the study of the writer's idiosyncrasy allowed us to conclude that Alexey Nikolaevich Tolstoy, a master of the word, skillfully combined several styles of speech in one text at once: laconic newspaper-journalistic and fiction, including elements of colloquial style of speech, – all this allowed him to achieve the greatest expressiveness of the text. This scientific research may be of interest not only to linguists, linguoculturologists, literary critics, researchers of the artistic style of A.N. Tolstoy, but also to the teachers of Russian as a foreign language.\n\nKeywords: good conquers evil, Do it, Let's do it, ottich and dedich, Motherland, Alexey Nikolaevich Tolstoy, lexico-semantic milestones, structural analysis of the text, artistic analysis, linguoculturological\n\nReferences:\n\nAlexandrova A.

The object of the study is a set of features of new media, considered on the basis of streaming services on the Russian market. The authors consider in detail such aspects of the topic as the features of the content of online cinemas, their correlation with new media and format television, building a user trajectory of content and the possibility of posting user reviews. Particular attention is paid to the transformation of format television into neotelevision using the tools of modern technologies and the capabilities of convergent online platforms with content diversification. The main conclusions of the study are the classification of online cinemas as an intermediate variant of new media: the renovation of the features of traditional media on a new platform. Unlike traditional cinemas, which do not position themselves as media platforms, online cinemas allow viewing news content, promptly tracking events in the world and at the same time viewing entertainment and educational content in a user-friendly mode. A special contribution of the authors to the study of the topic is an appeal to online cinemas from the perspective of journalism and media, which was not previously presented in Russian science. The novelty of the research lies in the consideration of streaming services as part of the media and as part of a modern media system that includes both fundamentally new media and the renovation of existing formats.\n\nKeywords: media, television, neotelevision, youth media, user content, streaming platforms, online cinema, new media, convergent mass media, mass media\n\nReferences:\n\nGegelova N.S., & Grabelnikov A.A.

The concepts of the master signifier, the points of attachment, the double movement of signifiers in the structure of the narrative as the basis for the internalization of the ideas and values of the narrative by the addressee of communication are actualized. The matrix of the university's discourse is considered as a constructive basis that ensures the promotion and functioning of the narrative. The analysis of the case of the speech of the US Secretary of State Colin Powell at the UN Security Council on February 5, 2003 is given. The initial theoretical positions and conclusions are correlated with the data of public opinion polls conducted by the Gallup Institute.The author's main contribution to the theory of narrative analysis is the approbation of the conceptual apparatus of political psychoanalysis to propaganda texts. The study of the phenomenon of internalization of the narrative of war in the mass consciousness requires a deep understanding of the driving forces underlying the processes under study. For the first time, the media text is analyzed from the perspective of a psychoanalytic approach, with the possibility of defining and describing specific reference points of a speech that determine its structure and final result. The proposed study lays the prerequisites for the further development of the concept of the narrative life cycle and the formulation of the concept of the counter-narrative, the definition of the inherent limitations and opportunities of this life cycle.\n\nKeywords: The narrative of war, Military journalism, The post - Lacanian paradigm, The Master signifier, Quilting points, The life cycle of a narrative, University discourse, Narrative analysis, Propaganda, Political psychoanalysis\n\nReferences:\n\nKudryavtseva, Z.G.

Using the examples of magazine articles, television broadcasts and blogs in social networks, a conceptual analysis of the ways of word-formation activity of the German language in the era of coronavirus restrictions is carried out. The subject of the study is the cognitive mechanisms of word formation of the German language and their pragmatic features. The object of the study was the coronavirus discourse of the German-speaking language space. The aim of the work was to reconstruct some concepts of the discursive field \"Coronavirus infection\", as well as to describe the cognitive mechanisms underlying their formation on the basis of linguistic data. The methods of conceptual and prototypical analysis, as well as cognitive modeling and contextual analysis were used in the study of cognitive mechanisms of word formation. The relevance and novelty of the research lies in the study and description of the latest word-formation phenomena and trends in German-speaking social discourse. As a result of the research, the regularities of the functioning of the main cognitive mechanisms of concept formation were deduced and formulated. The analysis of the German media discourse during the coronavirus pandemic revealed new basic concepts and concepts-components that form conceptual fields. The basic concepts we attributed, for example, such as \"Corona\", \"Mundnasenschutz\", \"Distanz\", \"Lockdown\", \"Panick\". As a result of the study, it was concluded that the basic concepts form conceptual fields, including component concepts, the methods of language verbalization of which imply the presence of emotive and evaluative components. The studied and described language material allows us to conclude that the main cognitive mechanisms of concept formation are profiling, conceptual metaphor, conceptual metonymy and contamination.\n\nKeywords: coronavirus infection, pandemic, irony, neologism, integration of concepts, conceptual field, conceptual analysis, prototype, the discursive field, word formation\n\nReferences:\n\nDictionary of Russian Coronavic / compilers: H.

Unlike some other types of discourse, educational discourse is subject to changes under the influence of extralinguistic factors, including the development of scientific thought and technological progress, achievements of psychology and sociology, transformation of the methodology of the educational process, and others. The article presents the main characteristics of the educational discourse, describes the participants of the discourse and their status roles, postulates the importance of the educational text as a center of communication in educational discourse, and identifies new formats of information transmission in the structure of educational discourse. The variability of the content side of the educational discourse requires the attention of linguistic researchers at each time stage, this determines the scientific novelty of the work. As a result, certain conclusions have been formulated, including that the educational text has such features as factual, conciseness, brevity and others. The texts of educational discourse exist at the levels of teacher—student, teacher—teacher and student—student relations. They are associated with various communication situations within the framework of education. Educational discourse is always purposeful, includes methods of information transmission, is based on an educational text, has a number of precedent texts of certain genres in its structure. The opinion of some linguists on the prospects for the development of this area of scientific thought is given/\n\nKeywords: information transfer formats, educational text, institutional discourse, pedagogical discourse, educational discourse, discourse, MOOCs, Longlife Learning, education, vocational education\n\nReferences:\n\nArutyunova N.

Viktor Pelevin subtly captures emanations of this kind and, at least allegorically, but quite accurately represents them in postmodernist artistic text. In the article we will focus on the study of the image of a journalist as the author of a media text and his role in shaping reality, presented in Pelevin's works. The material of the study was the novels \"The Sacred Book of the Werewolf\" (2004) and \"Empire V\" (2006). The paper presents the results of the analysis of media space, implemented in the works of V. Pelevin, which is the subject of the study. The novelty of the work is due to the fact that for the first time the role of journalism in the formation of the chronotope of a postmodernist work is analyzed on the example of V. Pelevin's novels. A successful attempt has been made to apply the knowledge of online news journalism to media texts in the structure of a work of art. Cultural-historical, structural-typological methods and structural analysis were used. The article is devoted to the study of the media space, which is considered as a simulacrum of reality, in the structure of the artistic world of a postmodern work. It is proved that the media space created by journalists is mosaic, its boundaries are conditional, blurred or completely absent, in the organization of space at different levels we see a rhizomatic structure, the author often uses the mirror principle.\n\nKeywords: modern domestic prose, postmodernism, Viktor Pelevin, modern journalist, media space, news production model, new media, online media, youth journalism, virtual space\n\nReferences:\n\nAvdonina, N.

K. Sluchevsky in 1888 under the impression of a trip to the Murmansk region. The conducted research using historical, functional and comparative methods allows us to comprehend the nature of Sluchevsky's literary work and the philosophical ideas embedded in his poetry. The author of the article pays special attention to the study of landscapes, which are an expression of emotions and personal feelings of K. K. Sluchevsky, reflecting the concept of the poet's life and his philosophy; consideration of such an aspect of the topic as Sluchevsky's use of real loci to expand time and space. The scientific novelty lies in the fact that the work for the first time studied the influence of real geographical loci on the poetry of K. K. Sluchevsky, the depiction of artistic images in northern Russia, the life and customs of local pomors, investigated the changes in perspective in the real locus and the expansion of time, revealed the general \"mythologeme\" of the space of the real locus. As a result of the research, the author comes to the conclusion that the geographical locus allows the poet not only to convey impressions about what he saw, but also to open his inner life, and most importantly, to recreate a holistic picture of the universe through concrete and small things.\n\nKeywords: Murmansk, sea, real geographical loci, lyrical cycle, Murmansk echoes, Konstantin Konstantinovich Sluchevsky, poetry, space, time, images\n\nReferences:\n\nLegotina, Y.

On the example of the four most representative videos posted on the You-Tube video platform, its specific features are considered.\n\nSo, firstly, the specifics of the composition of the analyzed videos are revealed, it is proved that their structure goes back to the narrative archetypes of a fairy tale. Secondly, the order of the narrative elements is determined and the key features of the emerging syntagmatic plot unity are described. Thirdly, the functional specificity of motivating content has been established, which lies in the fact that it performs a psychological and therapeutic function (motivating content helps in resolving a personal psychological crisis, temporarily replacing real psychological help). The method of functional analysis of the fairy tale narrative, developed by V. Propp, serves as a research method. This method is based on the principle of decomposition of a work, which allows you to divide the material into its component parts and analyze the invariant features of the text series. The novelty of the work lies in the fact that it presents a functional analysis of narrative matrices found in media works that perform a psychological and therapeutic function in society. As a result of the study, the author concludes that MC is useful both for the blogger (increase in the audience) and for the viewer (the first, but temporary, psychological and therapeutic help).\n\nKeywords: mediatization, media environment, structure, personality crisis, content, fairy tale, motivating content, motivation, narrative, mediaplatforme\n\nReferences:\n\nBugaeva L.D.

The object of the study is the publications of the TASS news agency. The author analyzes the initiative from the perspective of the development of relations between the two countries and how it is reflected in the media. The media perception of this initiative has changed from superficial and one-sided to deep and comprehensive, and the focus of attention has expanded from economic interests to national security; proposals to participate in the construction of the \"Belt and Road\" at the present stage are becoming more and more pragmatic. The aim is to analyze the coverage of the topic in the Russian news agency. Methodology - content analysis of information messages.\n\nNovelty of the research - at the moment there is a lack of a large number of studies on the coverage of this topic in a particular media. It can be concluded that it is necessary to continue to promote cooperation in the field of production capacity, infrastructure construction and communication, industrial modernization and economic development issues. Today, Russia and China are actively promoting the docking of National Development Strategies until 2030 with the Belt and Road Initiative. Against this background, a study of the level of awareness and changing characteristics of the Belt and Road by the news agency may provide some thoughts and recommendations for further interaction. The results of the study can be applied to analyze the work and prospects and directions of development of the two countries within the framework of the initiative.\n\nKeywords: research, initiative, content, interpretation, analysis, media, interaction, Russia, China, TASS\n\nReferences:\n\nGrosheva E.

An idiom is a frequently used phrase that plays an important role in everyday communication. The differences in the structure, metaphorical use, the origin of the precedent phrases reveal the individuality of the two languages and cultures. The article provides a comparative analysis of the use of idioms in Russian and Chinese. Although modern vocabulary is a part of the language, which has greatly developed and changed, this does not mean that all its laws are in a state of fluidity there are two kinds of lexical laws - static and dynamic.\n\nThe aim of the research is to carry out the analysis of Russian and Chinese phraseological expressions. The subject of the research is the national and cultural peculiarities of the use of phraseological expressions. Methods of research - analysis of scientific sources on the topic of research. Results of work. In Russian language idioms are called \"salt of life\" and \"fruit of historical wisdom\". In this article we will first try to discuss the lexical features of modern language to shed light on this topic. The results of the study can be applied in further comparison of the phraseological units of the two countries. The novelty of the research is due to the lack of scientific elaboration of the issue. All this actualizes the chosen topic of our research.\n\nKeywords: vocabulary, Russian idiom, escapism, culture, lexical features, cultural features, National features, languages, Russia, China\n\nReferences:\n\nV.N.

Based on a comprehensive analysis, the author comes to the conclusion that in the TV series \"Symphonic Novel\", the narrative modality is formed in the TV series together with lyricism as a system of principles and views that are displayed in the plot. Narrative becomes an important distinguishing characteristic of the TV series \"Symphonic Novel\", which allows it to become a unique and effective tool for influencing foreign (Russian-speaking) audiences in order to form a stable positive perception of South Korean culture and the South Korean state as a whole. The relevance of studying a television series as a way of forming a country image does not decrease due to its specific role in the formation of certain ideological attitudes that enhance its socio-cultural significance. The issue of the narrative of the TV series is also relevant due to its particular popularity among a wide audience.\n\nSo, in the interaction of the audience with the content of the TV series \"Symphonic Novel\", media communication, due to its features — publicity and mediation — receives specific parameters for the image of the author. Narrative discourse, complicated by the narrative instance, begins to obey the laws of the media text, the classical concepts of \"plot\", \"image of the author\", etc. they can be interpreted differently — through a communicative model. The narrative in the media space is determined by the psychological and social characteristics of the addressee — interests and needs, social status, emotional state (now) and personal qualities (always). The final product is also influenced by his ideas about the communicative situation, about himself as a subject of speech, about the direct recipient and random participants of communication, expectations of a perlocative effect (although the latter often lies outside the linguistic reality).\n\nKeywords: media, communication, media communication, soap opera, journalism, TV series, modality, narrative, media image, Symphonic Novel\n\nReferences:\n\nAkopov A.Z.
