        "text": "AMERICAN STUDIES SEMINAR, 2007 THESSALONIKI, GREECE On 2/11/2023 ALL MY TWITTER ACOUNTS WERE SUSPENDED. THIS CAME AFTER I STARTED PUBLICIZINFG INFO ON THE BIGGEST EVER RECRUITING/INTELLIGENCE CRIMINAL NETWORK IN GREEK ACADEMIA SET UP BY USEmbassy Athens and f. U.S. Ambassador to Greece Geoffrey R. Pyatt! Following this I have been denied access to my LINKEDIN account, MY SOCIAL MEDIA & EMAIL ACCOUNTS WERE COMPROMISED! 2024 update Criminal Networks of Impunity in Greek Academia PART I In 2019 the University of Macedonia (Thessaloniki, Greece) Rector ordered an investigation after I publicly denounced a number of issues regarding transparency and criminal academic networks in academic affairs as well as massive cheating during final exams. All these years the university authorities and at a later stage the Council of the institution did nothing to publicize the findings of the investigation despite my continuous requests. This very fact sets issues of rule of law and academic order. In the meantime, I have been consistently targeted in many ways, while my car has been vandalized several times inside the university parking lot. I asked the then Dean (and former Rector) I. Kouskouvelis to take measures and condemn these acts, yet, his response was that this was Not falling within his administrative duties. I guess it was not within his moral, academic obligation to support a fellow academic under attack, either. This is indicative only of the level of democracy I have been cherished for years in University of Macedonia. In an academic environment where students’ youth organization affiliated to Nea Dimokratia and PM K. Mitsotakis enjoy TOTAL IMMUNITY and IMPUNITY in massive cheating cases publicly acknowledged by students themselves in social media. Eventually, it was the very same criminal milieu (DAP-UoM) that pulled the strings to change the Department of International and European Studies course load and turned every single obligatory course in 2nd, 3rd, and 4th years to ELECTIVE. Practically there is no obligatory course in the aforementioned years of study. The initial proposal for this radical change was made by the then Dean I. Kouskouvelis honoured by today’s university authorities despite the fact that he is an INSTIGATOR TO A CRIME committed by a student upon his request. The student started collecting signatures in Google demanding my removal from the department a very aim set by DAP-UoM for years now. Eventually he was forced to confess in Court that its was I. Kouskouvelis who asked him to do so! The aforementioned Dean, f. Rector and f. Head of the Department was a member of the local criminal network of Tectonic Hall of Thessaloniki, Greece. It is worth mentioning that he was acquitted in almost a dozen high profile legal cases (setting NGOs). DAP-UoM (the New Democracy ruling party youth organization in tertiary education) had been enjoying full protection in all kinds of illegal behaviour. Hundreds (at least) have cheated during final exams, yet NO INVESTIGATION took place whatsoever! For years they allowed students to open books and simply copy info and answers during the exams (!) without a single student being punished! Instead of an investigation the Rector of University of Macedonia Katranidis ordered an investigation against me for publicizing these acts. A punishment, an intimidation act for doing my duty as a Head of the Department. Unlawfulness does Pay (indicative incidents-everything is documented) 1. A student carrying notes in the final exam room refused to handle his exam paper after he was caught cheating. Instead, he pushed back the exams supervisor, run to the exit and disappeared. NO student dared testify as they were intimidated. Students told me they knew who this person was, yet, they were afraid to speak up. 2. During class evaluation the forms were collected by an unknown student who had never been in class. The student picked up the forms and disappeared. I asked the Department Secretariat to inform me on his identity, yet, they refused to assist me on the grounds of this was personal data” not to be disclosed! 3. On another occasion a student filling in the evaluation form for that year’s classes was forced (upon my insistence) to reveal that he was NOT A STUDENT of the department. Eventually he admitted being a student of another university (Aristorle). The aim of this scam was evident. To under-evaluate me and “prove” that I was not good at my academic work. This is how the corruption system operated and the way they target those who refuse to be their tools. Had I let him participate in the evaluation process he would have made derogatory comments to justify insufficiency in teaching. This is a common practice for those outside the criminal network. In one case a high-profile university official told me that he had been using this scum to harm and dishonor those who just refused to operate as his puppets. An Academic Institutional Crisis Some critical issues arise from this clientelistic environment Some critical questions that need answers 1. Is impunity a “local” (institutional failure), national issue or is it the outcome of blatant interference of power networks operating in universities? The answer is a common secret and I would not try to answer it because of a major and revealing lawsuit to come. 2. What was the meaning and purpose of an INGOGNITO visit to the Department of International and European Studies and the University of Macedonia of the then US Ambassador to Greece G. Pyatt? This is a multi-million-dollar question that NO-ONE dares to bring forward. Is it customary for an ambassador to SECRETLY visit a university department without academics knowing about this “odd” visit? The question becomes a real puzzle taking into consideration the ANONYMOUS Greece revelation that a network of counter-information with the aim to supposedly deal with Russian influence in the city was built on the pillars of University of Macedonia, ELIAMEP and a number of journalists. They denied everything, yet, some facts cannot be explained. Nor can there be an explanation as to why the university authorities did not support my demand to provide an answer to why my university office was bugged. Why was I forced to deliver the monitoring device to the police? Why didn’t the only witness to the incident didn’t testify? The answers to these questions may be found in the operating of USA Embassy in Athens and the way to “deal with” those who refuse to be recruited. 3. One more important issue. On speaking out about corruption and clientelist, un-meritocratic networks in the university a DEFAMATORY campaign against me started with individuals at the institutions spreading rumours of me being mentally sick! This is classic intelligence practice applied by secret services particularly by the US. Is this related to the incognito visit of f. US Athens ambassador to the UoM? It appears that he had a “preference” to the institution. In the process I had to file a lawsuit against a colleague at the department (Bitzenis) as he was involved in communications mails with defamatory content (he suggested that I was mentally sick and should seek help). To this day justice has NOT BEEN DONE and my lawsuit is STILL PENDING. I dispose of sms corroborating this standard intelligence practice of character assassination. 4. What is the relation between f. Rector I. Kouskouvelis and USEmbassy Athens? How did the f. Rector I. Kouskouvelis use his structural power as a freemason member of the local Tectonic Hall (a criminal network) to persecute all those who stood up for meritocracy, equal treatment, transparency and those exposing clientelist networks? His cooperation with DAP (New Democracy Youth Organization) is well-known as well as the huge clientelist network they built. In a sms sent to me by a New Democracy party official he underpins that “he is capable of everything” meaning he is extremely dangerous for anyone who stands in his way"
