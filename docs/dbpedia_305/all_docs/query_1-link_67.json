ISBN-13: 978-1-4144-5722-2 ISBN-10: 1-4144-5722-7 Contact your Gale sales representative for ordering information.\n\nPrinted in the United States of America 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 14 13 12 11 10\n\nContents\n\nPreface ........................................................................................... vii Biographies ...................................................................................... 1 Cumulative Index ......................................................................... 351 (Including references to Who’s Who in the Theatre and Who Was Who in the Theatre)\n\nv\n\nPreface Provides Broad, Single-Source Coverage in the Entertainment Field Contemporary Theatre, Film and Television (CTFT) is a biographical reference series designed to provide students, educators, researchers, librarians, and general readers with information on a wide range of entertainment figures. Unlike single-volume reference works that focus on a limited number of artists or on a specific segment of the entertainment field, CTFT is an ongoing publication that includes entries on individuals active in the theatre, film, and television industries. Before the publication of CTFT, information-seekers had no choice but to consult several different sources in order to locate the in-depth biographical and credit data that makes CTFT’s one-stop coverage the most comprehensive available about the lives and work of performing arts professionals.\n\nScope CTFT covers not only performers, directors, writers, and producers, but also behind-the-scenes specialists such as designers, managers, choreographers, technicians, composers, executives, dancers, and critics from the United States, Canada, Great Britain, and the world. With 191 entries in CTFT 102, the series now provides biographies on approximately 27,015 people involved in all aspects of theatre, film, and television. CTFT gives primary emphasis to people who are currently active. New entries are prepared on major stars as well as those who are just beginning to win acclaim for their work. CTFT also includes entries on personalities who have died but whose work commands lasting interest.\n\nCompilation Methods CTFT editors identify candidates for inclusion in the series by consulting biographical dictionaries, industry directories, entertainment annuals, trade and general interest periodicals, newspapers, and online databases. Additionally, the editors of CTFT maintain regular contact with industry advisors and professionals who routinely suggest new candidates for inclusion in the series. Entries are compiled from published biographical sources which are believed to be reliable, but have not been verified for this edition by the listee or their agents.\n\nRevised Entries To ensure CTFT’s timeliness and comprehensiveness, entries from previous volumes, as well as from Gale’s Who’s Who in the Theatre, are updated for individuals who have been active enough to require revision of their earlier biographies. Such individuals will merit revised entries as often as there is substantial new information to provide. Obituary notices for deceased entertainment personalities already listed in CTFT are also published.\n\nAccessible Format Makes Data Easy to Locate CTFT entries, modeled after those in Gale’s highly regarded Contemporary Authors series, are written in a clear, readable style designed to help users focus quickly on specific facts. The following is a summary of the information found in CTFT sketches: •\n\nENTRY HEADING: the form of the name by which the listee is best known.\n\n•\n\nPERSONAL: full or original name; dates and places of birth and death; family data; colleges attended, degrees earned, and professional training; political and religious affiliations when known; avocational interests.\n\n•\n\nADDRESSES: home, office, agent, publicist and/or manager addresses. vii\n\n•\n\nCAREER: tagline indicating principal areas of entertainment work; resume of career positions and other vocational achievements; military service.\n\n•\n\nMEMBER: memberships and offices held in professional, union, civic, and social organizations.\n\n•\n\nAWARDS, HONORS: theatre, film, and television awards and nominations; literary and civic awards; honorary degrees.\n\n•\n\nCREDITS: comprehensive title-by-title listings of theatre, film, and television appearance and work credits, including roles and production data as well as debut and genre information.\n\n•\n\nRECORDINGS: album, single song, video, and taped reading releases; recording labels and dates when available.\n\n•\n\nWRITINGS: title-by-title listing of plays, screenplays, scripts, and musical compositions along with production information; books, including autobiographies, and other publications.\n\n•\n\nADAPTATIONS: a list of films, plays, and other media which have been adapted from the listee’s work.\n\n•\n\nSIDELIGHTS: favorite roles; portions of agent-prepared biographies or personal statements from the listee when available.\n\n•\n\nOTHER SOURCES: books, periodicals, and internet sites where interviews or feature stories can be found.\n\nAccess Thousands of Entries Using CTFT’s Cumulative Index Each volume of CTFT contains a cumulative index to the entire series. As an added feature, this index also includes references to all seventeen editions of Who’s Who in the Theatre and to the four-volume compilation Who Was Who in the Theatre.\n\nAvailable in Electronic Format Online. Recent volumes of CTFT are available online as part of the Gale Biographies (GALBIO) database accessible through LEXIS-NEXIS. For more information, contact LEXIS-NEXIS, P.O.
