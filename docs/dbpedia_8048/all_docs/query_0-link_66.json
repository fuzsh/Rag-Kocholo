        "text": "Tag: elinor ostrom\n\nIn Which Garett Comes to Someshwarwadi (But Elinor Can’t)\n\nI stay in Someshwarwadi. It’s a small little locality that lies between two other localities in Pune, Baner and Pashan. It is famous for a Someshwar temple that was built sometime in the 12th century (or thereabouts), and little else.\n\nBut one thing that it should be famous for is the fact that it will lie right next door to a marvel that is coming up in Pune – the Pune Metro. That alone is not enough to make it famous, of course, because one hopes that lots of areas in Pune will lie next to the Pune Metro.\n\nWhat ought to make Someshwarwadi famous is the fact that commuters can soon get off a world class metro, and then not have footpaths to walk on. Yup, you read that right: all of Someshwarwadi has no footpaths.\n\nNothing gives economists greater pleasure than using jargon, so of course we have a name for this phenomenon. What phenomenon, you ask? That of building metros before attempting to build footpaths. Us economists, we call it isomorphic mimicry. I come from a city that can give this phenomenon much better names, especially in our own language, but we’ll leave that be for now.\n\nBut not having footpaths is problematic, of course. And not just because walking becomes an adventure sport with life and death consequences. It is also problematic because Garett has come a-visitin’.\n\nWho is Garett? Why, Hardin, of course:\n\nThe tragedy of the commons is a metaphoric label for a concept that is widely discussed, and criticised, in economics, ecology and other sciences. According to the concept, should a number of people enjoy unfettered access to a finite, valuable resource such as a pasture, they will tend to over-use it, and may end up destroying its value altogether. Even if some users exercised voluntary restraint, the other users would merely supplant them, the predictable result being a tragedy for all. The metaphor is the title of a 1968 essay by ecologist Garrett Hardin. As another example, he cited a watercourse which all are free to pollute. The concept itself did not originate with Hardin, but rather extends back to classical antiquity, being discussed by Aristotle.\n\nIn Someshwarwadi, people do enjoy unfettered access to a finite, valuable resource: the side of the road. There are no footpaths, no “No Parking” signs, no nothing. So everything and everyone – cars, abandoned cars, people, garbage and stray dogs, among other things and beings – jostles for space.\n\nAnd speaking of “other users who would supplant”, we have new members in this crowded club: school-buses.\n\nThese school-bus owners take advantage of the fact that there is an absence of no parking signs on this road, and solve for themselves the problem of where to park these large vehicles. Which is all well and good for them, of course, but is a less than desirable state of affairs for the rest of us in Someshwarwadi. Unfettered access for all results in a less than ideal outcome for all. Why, Garrett bhai was writing about Someshwarwadi while working in the United States in the 1960’s! Must have been a prescient sort of fellow.\n\nStudents of economics and ecology know what is coming up next. Here we go, they are thinking to themselves as they impatiently scroll through. Hurry up and get Elinor in here already!\n\nIt was long unanimously held among economists that natural resources that were collectively used by their users would be over-exploited and destroyed in the long-term. Elinor Ostrom disproved this idea by conducting field studies on how people in small, local communities manage shared natural resources, such as pastures, fishing waters and forests. She showed that when natural resources are jointly used by their users, in time, rules are established for how these are to be cared for and they become used in a way that is both economically and ecologically sustainable\n\nBut as you will see from the title of this post, it ain’t quite so simple. As I have mentioned in the title of this post already, Garett is very much in Someshwarwadi, but Elinor cannot make it here, alas.\n\nAnd why is that? It is because the area in question also has a local, extremely well connected political presence that, er, “decides” everything. Enforcement of local customs in Someshwarwadi is a top-down thing, not a bottom up thing. So yes, rules are established, sure, but not by folks who are motivated to strive for solutions that “economically and ecologically sustainable”.\n\nWhat we get are promises of footpaths and of no parking signs. Actual footpaths will be delivered as soon as we figure out how to solve the problem of isomorphic mimicry. Until then, parked buses and Mr. Hardin will be permanent fixtures of our little neighborhood.\n\nAh well. So it goes.\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nTchova-Tchova\n\nIf you’re wondering, it means “You push, I push”:\n\nIn 2012, Mbamba’s leaders signed an agreement with Mariri Investimentos, the organization that runs the project and leases a 224-square-mile conservation concession surrounding the village. An innovative partnership, Tchova-Tchova (meaning “You push, I push”), emerged. Its goal is to boost community income and food production and include villagers in conservation projects while allowing them to manage essential needs, such as water supply, solar lighting, schooling for children, and crop protection against hungry animals. Because of Tchova-Tchova, Mbamba residents find jobs at the environmental center and the Mpopo Ecolodge, in construction, in road maintenance, and as rangers.\n\nSource: National Geographic, “One of Africa’s Largest Wildernesses is Thriving – Because Locals Have a Stake in its Success”\n\nThe article (I hope you get to read it by clicking on the link above – and if you can’t, please do figure out how to gain access – it is very much an article worth reading) is a fascinating write-up on how Niassa, a protected area in northern Mozambique is thriving under a very Ostromian model.\n\nIf this is the first time you’re hearing the name Elinor Ostrom, I envy you your introduction to her magical world.\n\nElinor Ostrom was one of the great economists of the twentieth century, and a Nobel prize winner. Here is her Nobel lecture, and here is where you can read it. You’ve already read ChatGPT’s ELI5 above, here is Wikipedia on why Ostrom was so very awesome:\n\nOstrom studied the interaction of people and ecosystems for many years and showed that the use of exhaustible resources by groups of people (communities, cooperatives, trusts, trade unions) can be rational and prevent depletion of the resource without either state intervention or markets with private property.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elinor_Ostrom\n\nWhy is the National Geographic article a good example of an Ostromian solution? Because of this problem:\n\nHunter-gatherers, farmers, rulers of chiefdoms—people have called this region home for thousands of years. But centuries of colonization and a recent civil war have left communities in Niassa desperately poor. If this magnificent wilderness—ancestral lands of people who have lived here for generations—is to be preserved and nurtured for the future, they must be given a direct stake in conservation efforts and tourism.\n\nSource: National Geographic, “One of Africa’s Largest Wildernesses is Thriving – Because Locals Have a Stake in its Success”\n\nWhat happens if the ancestral lands of people who have lived there for generations are administered without giving them a stake in the conservation efforts being tried there, and without giving them a stake in tourism activities there? Well, no skin in the game is the simplest story.\n\nThe slightly more complicated, but rewarding story, is that it (the Ostromian solution) allows for the following:\n\nThe preservation of local traditions and beliefs\n\nMore involved resource management\n\nGreater community involvement\n\nAn application of economic incentives\n\nOn the ground partnerships\n\nA sustainable way of addressing human-wildlife conflicts\n\nFun exercise: team up with somebody else interested in reading this article and see how many of these features you can identify in this article.\n\nFunner exercise: what other features are there in these article that I have not mentioned here?\n\nOstromian frameworks are a great way to overcome what is known as the “tragedy of the commons” problem, but there is much more to it than “just” this. If you’re looking to learn more about the world in which we live and how it could be made a better place (and why else would you be studying economics?), learning about Elinor Ostrom, her work and its many applications is a great way to start.\n\nTen other things that I found fascinating in this article, keeping in mind that I’ve limited myself to just ten, there are many more:\n\nThe chonde-chonde ceremony\n\nNiassa, the hunting reserve where this solution is being implemented, is larger than the country of Switzerland. Africa is really, really, really big, and learning just how big it is never ceases to surprise me\n\nThe economics of a sustainable model (at least on the face of it, at any rate) when it comes to sport-hunting concessions made for fascinating reading\n\nPositive and negative incentives to protect wildlife and habitat was such a great teaching moment!\n\n“The more animals, the more tourism dollars, the rationale goes. A community conservation fund administered by the villagers rewards wildlife-friendly behavior. For every tourist who visits the environmental center, Mariri Investimentos pays $25 into the fund. For every prize animal a tourist spots—a lion, elephant, leopard, buffalo, wild dog, or hyena—Mariri pays eight dollars into the fund. For every month with no elephant poaching in the vicinity, the fund earns $155. But if Mariri’s rangers find evidence of poaching, money is deducted—$19 for every snare, for example; $232 is docked for every lion killed; and a poached elephant takes $310 from the community fund.”\n\nMy word for the day: ungulates\n\nMy learning for the day: aardvark means earth-pig. Huh.\n\nBaobab trees live for up to two thousand years. (As you can see, I know very little about biology, so please bear with me if my “discoveries” are old news to you)\n\nTrade is a non-zero sum game across species too! This was such a fascinating thing to learn:\n\n“Some hives are hidden inside woody nooks or hollow trees far smaller than baobabs. To get to them, Yao honey collectors have struck up a mutually beneficial relationship with the greater honeyguide, a bird they call sego. It’s one of few animals that can digest beeswax. When the birds see a person, and a hive is not far away, they utter a chittering Morse code—tji-tji-tji tji-tji-tji—to signal there’s honey to be had nearby. An attentive Yao answers with a distinctive brrrr-HM, brrrr-HM, brrr-HM.\n\nThe honeyguide leads the way, flitting from tree to tree with the honey hunter in pursuit, calling back and forth as they go. When hunter and bird reach the hive, he pacifies the bees with smoke, chops down the tree, cracks open the bole with an axe, and pulls the honeycomb free. Then he shares the loot, leaving a pile of sugar-laden honeycomb for his guide.\n\nIn 2015, evolutionary biologist Claire Spottiswoode, from the University of Cape Town, in South Africa, and Cambridge University, in the U.K., teamed up with Yao honey hunters Orlando Yassene and Musaji Muamedi to find out if the birds are responding to any old sound or specifically to the Yao call. The team walked through the woodlands on a series of simulated honey hunts, playing three different sounds on a portable speaker: the Yao’s brrrr-HM call; arbitrary human sounds; and other animal sounds, such as the call of a ring-necked dove. The segos were at least twice as responsive to the brrrr-HM call and led the team to hives three times more often in response to it.”\n\nGrab a cup of coffee, and even if you choose to not read the article, please savor all of the photographs. Do this on a computer, because a phone won’t give you the same experience.\n\nMy favorite was the photo of the fisherman with the fish in his mouth. What about you?\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading..."
