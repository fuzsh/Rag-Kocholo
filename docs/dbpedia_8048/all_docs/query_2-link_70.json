        "text": "Beginning in 2021, APSA presented the APSA Best Book Award in lieu of the Woodrow Wilson Foundation Award which had been the award’s longstanding name since its inception. During that time, the APSA Council approved the creation of an ad-hoc committee to determine the new name. In 2023 APSA officially announced that the APSA Best Book Award had been renamed the Merze Tate – Elinor Ostrom Outstanding Book Award. The award is named after two inspiring women, Dr. Merze Tate and Dr. Elinor Ostrom, who were pioneers in the political science discipline and beyond. Dr. Tate was the first African American woman to earn a PhD in Government while Dr. Ostrom was the first woman to receive the Nobel Prize in Economics for her work on common pool resources. Both women contributed invaluable research and scholarship to the discipline of political science while facing prejudice relating to gender and race. Dr. Tate and Dr. Ostrom worked tirelessly to advance educational and professional opportunities for students and faculty, particularly scholars of color and women in the disciplines of political science, history, and economics. APSA is proud to name this award in their honor."
