        "text": "Call me slow, but, forty-eight hours on, I still don’t get this year’s economics Nobels. First those zany Norwegians award President Obama the Peace Prize for having good intentions. Then, in a year when economics was featured on the front pages as seldom before, they hand the dismal-science award to a relatively obscure Berkeley economist, Oliver E. Williamson, and a positively obscure (to most economists, anyway) Indiana University political scientist, Elinor Ostrom.\n\nDon’t get me wrong. Williamson, 77, and Ostrom, 76, have both produced significant and original scholarship, and I congratulate them on their success. Williamson, who studied under the polymath Herbert Simon and for many years taught at the University of Pennsylvania, developed a theory of why big corporations develop which hinges on the need to minimize “transaction costs.” (To put it crudely, by eliminating haggling and replacing it with diktat, firms can do some things more cheaply and efficiently than the market can do them.) Formalizing and testing Williamson’s intuitive insights has kept many economists gainfully employed. If it’s a bit difficult to assess the practical importance of his ideas, the same can be said of many other Nobel-winning contributions. Ostrom, through a series of case studies, cast doubt on the traditional view that commonly owned resources, such as rivers and grazing pastures, are invariably overused—the so-called “Tragedy of the Commons.” With other scholars, she also carried out some economic experiments that demonstrated people’s willingness to punish cheaters and defectors even when there is no gain to them personally in doing it. (It was in reading up on this area, a few years ago, that I first came across her name.) The fact that Ostrom is the first woman to win the prize gives added significance to her selection.\n\nIn the economics blogosphere, the reaction to the announcement was respectful. Paul Krugman, last year’s Nobel winner, claimed the prizes marked the rebirth of “institutional economics,” a vanished sub-discipline that was once associated with names like Thorsten Veblen and John R. Commons. Greg Mankiw posted a positive piece about Williamson and Ostrom by his longtime Harvard colleague, Michael Spence, who shared the 2001 prize. Tyler Cowen posted a similarly complimentary piece by Vernon Smith, one of the 2002 laureates. Brad De Long, a Berkeley colleague of Williamson, put up a picture of an impromptu party in his honor. In commendable displays of honesty, Business Week’s Michael Mandel and Time’s Justin Fox admitted they’d never heard of Ostrom. Nevertheless, they both cited reasons to applaud her elevation.\n\nThe general line in most of these articles, and in the Times report by Louis Uchitelle, was that the Nobel committee, by recognizing the importance of non-market transactions, had appropriately recognized the current turmoil in the global economy and in the discipline of economics. I don’t wish to sound mean-spirited, but come on, people: this is 2009, the year after the biggest financial crisis since the nineteen-thirties. If the Nobel Prize is about marking the moment, it should have been awarded to some of those economists that for decades have been engaged in the fractious debate about market efficiency. I nominate Eugene Fama and Richard Thaler, both of the University of Chicago, Robert Shiller, of Yale, and Sanford J. Grossman, formerly of Wharton, who now runs an investment firm.\n\nWith assists from Paul Samuelson, Milton Friedman and others, Fama, during the late sixties and early seventies, formulated and promoted the Efficient Market Hypothesis, which says that prices in financial markets accurately reflect all of the available information about economic fundamentals. I have always considered this a bizarre idea, but in terms of the subsequent history of economics and of financial regulation its importance is difficult to overstate. Fama should have been awarded the Nobel years ago, but for some reason—a reluctance to award yet another prize to Chicago?—he has been overlooked. Picking him this year, when his theory is under assault from many sides, would have been a nice irony, and a brave move.\n\nThaler is one of the pioneers of behavioral economics, the trendy sub-discipline that seeks to combine the insights of psychology with the rigor of economics. Since the eighties, in a series of research articles and survey pieces, he has repeatedly queried the ultra-rational basis of the Efficient Market Hypothesis and other questionable Chicago theories. The fact that, since 1995, he has pursued this research program from a perch at Chicago’s Graduate School of Business, which is now called Chicago Booth, makes his work doubly interesting.\n\nShiller needs little introduction. In his academic research and his best-selling book from 2000, “Irrational Exuberance,” he has pioneered the study of asset-price bubbles, which play an increasingly important role in modern economies. Grossman, along with Columbia’s Joe Stiglitz, who already has a Nobel, pointed out as long ago as 1976 that a truly efficient market was a logical impossibility. (If all the relevant information were already contained in the prices in the stock market, for example, there would be no incentive for investors to do any research or trading.)\n\nHonoring these four scholars this year would have been a public acknowledgement that the central debate in economics, about the proper role of markets, remains unresolved, and it would also have signaled why the subject is so interesting. In economics, unlike in chemistry or physics, many basic questions, such as the causes of recessions and stock market booms, remain matters of dispute. For years, the economics profession tried to maintain a common front, presenting economics as a unified hard science and dismissing critics as misinformed or venal. That charade, surely, is now over, and the appearance on the same Stockholm stage of Fama, Grossman, Shiller, and Thaler would have been a timely confirmation of the new reality."
