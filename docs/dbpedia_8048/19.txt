Elinor Ostrom was a political scientist who in 2009 became the first-ever woman to receive the prestigious Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences, along with economist Oliver Williamson. Ostrom made groundbreaking contributions to understanding how communities manage shared natural resources, earning her the Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences.

Before her work, economists believed that when everyone has access to a shared resource - like a fishing lake or pasture - they will act only in their self-interest, overuse the resource, and deplete it. The economists called for either government intervention or privatization to manage these resources. Ostrom, however, challenged this conventional wisdom. Through her work, she observed that communities around the world have developed diverse and effective methods for managing shared resources sustainably, without relying solely on government regulations or privatization.

Early Life and Education

Elinor Clair Awan, who later became known as Elinor Ostrom, was born on August 7, 1933, in Los Angeles, California. Raised in a modest family, she demonstrated an early interest in understanding societal structures and governance. Pursuing this passion, Ostrom went on to study political science, culminating in her achievement of a Ph.D. from the University of California, Los Angeles, in 1965. This period was also significant in her personal life, as she married Vincent Ostrom, a fellow political scientist and a future collaborator, in 1963.

Ostrom started her academic career at Indiana University in Bloomington, where she climbed the ranks from an assistant professor to become the Arthur F. Bentley Professor of Political Science. Alongside her husband, she also co-directed the Workshop in Political Theory and Policy Analysis, a pioneering research center focusing on the study of governance and public policy.

Ostrom expanded her influence through her role as the founding director of the Center for the Study of Institutional Diversity at Arizona State University in Tempe. Her career also included an affiliation with Virginia Tech as a researcher.

Notable Accomplishments

Ostrom's biggest accomplishment was proving that small communities around the world were capable of developing self-governing institutions that would prevent over-exploitation of communal resources. Her contributions were recognized globally, leading to her election to the National Academy of Sciences in 2001 and culminating in the Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences in 2009 for her analysis of economic governance, especially the commons.

Ostrom co-founded the Workshop in Political Theory and Policy Analysis at Indiana University, where she also served as a professor and held various leadership roles. Ostrom's work was revolutionary, challenging the prevailing notions of resource management with her landmark book, "Governing the Commons." She also published several other books, including "Understanding Institutional Diversity" and "Working Together: Collective Action, the Commons, and Multiple Methods in Practice."

Ostrom contributed plenty to the field of political science, although it was her award-winning scholarly work showing how communities can successfully share common resources, such as waterways, livestock grazing land, and forests, through collective property rights that best defined her legacy.

Conventional economic wisdom said that property that is communally owned tended to be mismanaged, a phenomenon known as the "tragedy of the commons." Ostrom was able to debunk this popular theory, which was originally outlined by ecologist Garrett Hardin, documenting many places around the world where communities have cooperated successfully to govern common resources and ensure that they remain viable for current and future inhabitants.

Hardin argued that to avoid depletion, common resources should either be managed by the government or split into privately-owned lots. Through her studies, Ostrom proved that this is not always the case. She found that communities sharing a resource can independently create rules for its use and maintenance, achieving sustainability both economically and ecologically, and without any regulation by central authorities or privatization.

Theory of Collective Action

Based on her extensive research, Ostrom developed eight principles for the successful management of common resources through collective action.

Define clear boundaries of the common resource: Groups that are allowed access to the common resource should be clearly defined, for example, which can reduce conflicts over who can access it.

Rules governing the use of common resources should fit local needs and conditions: Rules should be determined by local interested parties to meet their specific needs and circumstances.

Encourage group decision making. Engaging as many users as possible in the decision-making process about resource use increases compliance and commitment to the rules.

Usage of common resources must be monitored: Regular monitoring of how the resource is used ensures that all users follow the agreed-upon rules, and violators are held accountable for their actions.

Sanctions for violators of the defined rules should be graduated: Rather than an immediate ban on access to the resource, penalties for rule violations should be proportional, starting with mild penalties such as warnings or fines and escalating to more severe consequences if non-compliance continues.

Conflicts should be resolved easily and informally: Low-cost dispute resolution regarding the resource encourages compliance.

Higher-level authorities recognize the established rules and self-governance: Governments or other territorial authorities should ideally recognize and back up, or at least not undermine, collective action agreements, institutions, and conflict resolution.

Consider integrating smaller systems into larger ones: Governance should begin at the most localized level possible, but also encompass the broader, interconnected context, like managing a waterway that spans multiple communities.

The Bottom Line

Ostrom's research changed our understanding of resource management, proving that local communities can effectively govern shared natural resources without the need for central authority or privatization. This work earned Ostrom the Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences in 2009, making her the first woman to receive this honor in the field. Her legacy is marked not only by her historic Nobel Prize win but also by her significant contributions to political science, particularly through the establishment of the Workshop in Political Theory and Policy Analysis at Indiana University.

Ostrom's principles for managing shared resources continue to shape policy and research. For example, her principles were instrumental in guiding a co-design healthcare improvement project in Los Angeles County, focusing on citizens re-entering the community from jail.
