        "text": "“I am forced to the appalling conclusion,” William S. Burroughs wrote, “that I would never have become a writer but for Joan’s death.”\n\nIn one line, William S. Burroughs credited his career to a woman's death - but he left out the monumental fact that he was the one holding the gun that killed his wife, Joan Vollmer, when she was only 28. Burroughs, famous as one of the founding members of the Beat movement and author of Naked Lunch and Junky, has been described as eccentric, sardonic, and rebellious. But not even Burroughs himself wanted to admit that he was a murderer.\n\nJoan Vollmer was shot in the head in 1951. Burroughs spent two weeks in jail, changed his story, and then fled the country to avoid more jail time. And while Joan's writing career was over, Burroughs used her death as a stepping stone towards his own success.\n\nWilliam Burroughs and Joan Vollmer met in New York City in 1945. Burroughs was already friends with writers Jack Kerouac and Allen Ginsberg, who introduced him to the young Barnard graduate. The two quickly became inseparable, with alcohol and drugs fueling their romance. Soon, Burroughs was doing heroin, and Vollmer regularly used Benzedrine.\n\nBy 1945, Joan Vollmer had already been married twice, even though she was only 22, and she had a young daughter named Julie. Burroughs left Vollmer in New York and bought a farm in Texas where he grew marijuana. He came back to the city when he heard Vollmer had been locked up in the psychotic ward at Bellevue. In 1946, Vollmer became pregnant with Burroughs's child, a boy named Billy.\n\nBut two young children didn't slow down the couple. They moved to New Orleans, where Burroughs was arrested for heroin possession. The pair fled to Mexico City to wait out the statute of limitations.\n\nJoan Vollmer was a brilliant poet, inspired Ginsberg to write \"Howl,\" and was heavily addicted to Benzedrine. When Joan fled to Mexico City with her husband, who had to leave the U.S. or face jail time for heroin possession, she couldn't find her favorite drug. As Joan went through speed withdrawal, she turned increasingly to alcohol.\n\nOn September 6, 1951, Joan and William were both drunk at a party. Apparently on a whim, Burroughs turned to Vollmer and said \"Well, I guess it's time for our William Tell act!\" The night, like their relationship, would end in tragedy.\n\nAccording to lore, William Tell helped found Switzerland by shooting an apple off his son's head. The year was 1307, and Tell was a local farmer and hunter. The act was a defiant repudiation of the Hapsburg duke of Austria, who controlled Switzerland and demanded that every man remove his hat in front of the Hapsburg sign. When William Tell refused, the Hapsburg bailiff forced him to shoot an apple off his son's head, or both would be put to death.\n\nTell successfully shot the apple off his son's head and was valorized for centuries. But when William Burroughs took a shot at his wife, Joan Vollmer, he missed.\n\nOn September 6, 1951, Burroughs suggested the William Tell act, and Joan played along. It was their first time trying out the act. Joan balanced a glass of gin on top of her head in the middle of the party. Burroughs, a lifelong gun lover, always carried a weapon. That night he had a .380 caliber automatic pistol. He positioned himself nine feet away from his wife, drew his weapon, and fired a single shot.\n\nThe bullet didn't hit the glass. Instead, because Burroughs's hand wavered, the shot hit Joan in the head, killing her instantly.\n\nAfter the shooting, Burroughs was locked in a Mexican jail for 13 days while his family got together bail money. His lawyer, Benabé Jurado, told Burroughs to lie to the police. Burroughs went along, telling them that the gun went off accidentally. Before the case came to trial, his own lawyer shot someone in a fit of road rage and fled the country. Burroughs followed, heading to Central America, London, and Tangiers.\n\nBurroughs's family took in his son, Billy, and provided the unstable writer with a regular stipend to fuel his travels. They were heirs to a small fortune earned by Burroughs's grandfather, who created an adding machine. The Daily News headline about Joan's death read: \"Heir's Pistol Kills His Wife; He Denies Playing Wm. Tell.\"\n\nWithin two years, in 1953, Burroughs published his first novel, Junkie: Confessions of an Unredeemed Drug Addict, which was later released as Junky."
