The Festival features a week of Bookend events, and a Festival day with more than 300 authors and 250 booksellers, publishers, and literary organizations.\n\nPEN America will present events tackling toxic masculinity and celebrating literature in translation. We’ll present an evening of performances scored by currently incarcerated artists and a panel who will discuss how we should deal with the art of the accused.\n\nPEN America is thrilled to take part in this celebration of the literary community. Be sure to join us during the Festival for the chance to meet PEN America staff, learn more about our work, and to receive discounts on your Membership and PEN America publications.\n\nThe full schedule of events we are taking part in is below.\n\nStop by Booth #329 for discounted merchandise and to chat with our staff about the work PEN America does!\n\nNot Invisible Today: Winners of PEN Translation Prizes\n\nJonathan Cohen, Pierre Joris, Tess Lewis, and Sandra Smith\n\n7:30pm-8:45pm\n\n9/11/2018\n\nWORD Bookstore 126 Franklin St. Brooklyn, NY 11222\n\nThe translators in our world who bring us translated literature are crucial to our understanding of word and art across all cultures and borders. Meet the translators behind prize-winning translations. Sponsored by PEN America’s Translation Committee and moderated by Committee member Jonathan Cohen, this program showcases three translators talking about translation and reading from their works. We will hear from Pierre Joris, 2005 Poetry in Translation Award winner for Lightduress (Paul Celan); Tess Lewis, 2017 PEN Translation Prize winner for her translation from German of Angel of Oblivion (Maja Haderlap); and Sandra Smith, 2007 PEN Translation Prize winner for Suite Française (Irène Némirovsky). Listen to these translators perform as writers and make the foreign familiar.\n\nBreak Out: Voices From the Inside 2018\n\nJoshua Bennett, Ammayeah Benton, Sergio De La Pava, Baz Dreisinger, Brendan Kiely, Ian Manuel, and Jackie Wang\n\n7pm-9pm\n\n9/13/2018\n\nISSUE Project Room 22 Boerum Pl, Brooklyn, NY 11201\n\nJoin PEN America for an electric night of award-winning work from the 2018 Prison Writing Contest, staged by Joshua Bennett (The Sobbing School), emerging poet Ammayeah Benton, Sergio De La Pava (Lost Empress), Baz Dreisinger (Incarceration Nations), Brendan Kiely (Tradition, All American Boys), Ian Manuel (featured in Bryan Stevenson’s Just Mercy), Jackie Wang (Carceral Capitalism), and Rehabilitation Through the Arts’ alumni theater group. Currently incarcerated artists have been commissioned to score collaborative movement and song through Dances For Solidarity and Musicambia.\n\nToxic Masculinity: Where Do We Go From Here?\n\nYahdon Israel, Brendan Kiely, and Lynn Melnick 7pm-8pm\n\n9/14/2018\n\nCeleste Auditorium, NYPL Stephen A. Schwarzman Building 476 5th Ave, New York, NY 10018\n\nPEN America and the Brooklyn Book Festival present “Toxic Masculinity: Where Do We Go From Here?” hosted by the New York Public Library. Brendan Kiely, author of recently released Tradition, Yahdon Israel, writer and creator of Literaryswag, and Lynn Melnick, author of the new poetry collection Landscape with Sex and Violence, will join in conversation to discuss the ways they as writers and activists have reckoned with #MeToo, toxic masculinity, rape culture, and privilege, as well as where they think we need to go from here. Panelists will consider the literary world and the roles authors and journalists have to play in giving voice to and supporting those who have been silenced and are now speaking up.\n\nThe Art of the Accused\n\nDeborah Solomon, A. O. Scott, Tanya Selvaratnam, and Maggie Mustard\n\n1pm-2pm\n\n9/16/2018\n\n250 Joralemon St, Brooklyn, NY 11201\n\nWilliam S. Burroughs shot his wife in a drunken haze. Louis-Ferdinand Céline was a vicious anti-Semite. Charlie Chaplin liked very young girls. Chuck Close has been accused of sexual misconduct, along with dozens of well-known artists and creative professionals since the #MeToo movement spread virally last October. How do we reckon with their work and the work of creatives throughout history with violent or contentious personal lives? Should their actions affect how we see the work? Should it color our reasons for engaging with it? These are the questions about power, spectatorship, violence, gender, labor, and media consumption—in, before, and after the year 2018—we must ask. Speakers will offer their insight and discuss their own experiences with the “art of the accused.” Supported by The Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts."
