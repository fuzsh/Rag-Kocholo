        "text": "Do you think Burroughs \"JUNKY\" is good reading for a young person? However cool my method of discovering Bukowski was, discovering Burroughs was a fantastic story. I was over for an advisory supper, a freshman in high school, at my advisor's house. He was a hippy type, and living with another hippy type science teacher, probably bangin her. I was looking at their bookshelf and I saw Naked Lunch. I started reading it out loud to my advisory, not knowing what it was.\n\n\"I can feel the heat closing in, feel them out there making moves, setting up their devil doll stool pigeons, crooning over my spoon and dropper...\"\n\nThena girl started giggling and I put the book back on the shelf, and tried to forget those first lines.\n\nI ended up reading it, and never thought much of it, until I read an excerpt from Junky. Burroughs was a professional anthropology writer when he wrote it, so it could be considered junky anthropology. But it could be considered a pass at the darker side of human nature, appealing to our sinister instincts. What do you think? Valuable piece of anthropology or twisted pornography, and do you care either way?\n\nnaked lunch is one of my favorite books. through that, i got really into burroughs, and i bought a bunch of his other books, but i never got around to reading them. i've read naked lunch a few times, though, as well as some of the excerpts of the stuff that was cut out when the other beat guys (bryon gysin and ginsberg maybe?) edited his manuscripts to produce naked lunch. i think it's tough to deny that NL is much more than simple pornography or obscenity. i read junky before that, and it was good, but NL is really a high point of 20th century literature, in my opinion. i don't care for much of the other beat stuff.\n\nI found Buroughs through Kerouac. I found Kerouac through a friend who lent me some of my first Bukowski books... anyway, I read Junky first. Because my girlfriend is an ex-heroin addict and was married to a girl shortly before I met her and the only books I've ever found her reading were books about recovery, heroin diaries etc... I wanted to bring something of my bookshelf into her world. I loved Junky, I mean it inspired me, inspired me to the point where I found myself about to put the needle in my arm (drunk) if it weren't for the fact of the guy not having an extra needle... (mind you this wasn't even 4 days after I finished it) He had the Junk but not a needle. I decided to pass trying it without . Naked Lunch, I'm halfway through (I can't even believe it) and I'd rather not try to put in words what I've found of it, what it's about or even why I continue reading. You know, I don't know what it's about. But it is awesome at some points and completely horrid at most. This thread has helped with understanding it... besides I was warned in the Introduction to Junk of Naked Lunch as to being hard to follow. I decided to take a stab at it. now here I find myself ferociously stabbing in a dim litted near dark basement at, may I say bad book?\n\nInterzone was a very good excerpt! one of the couple I actually read throughout, clearly(?) not understanding, but digging!!\n\nHey guys ! I've been out for a while (lots of work on my hand as of late) so excuse me for my ongoing silence, which is hereby broken !\n\nSo last night I stumbled across a documentary on Burroughs (which surprised me a lot knowing all the sh*t we're shown on TV but I digress ...). The truth is, I didn't and still don't, know much about the guy. I've only read Naked Lunch and Junkie. And aside from some \"facts\" that were completely full of crap the whole thing was interesting. So basically my post boils down to this : I'd like to learn more about him so what stuff (books or anything) would you guys advise me to read/see ? Also just out of curiosity what piece is your favorite and why ?\n\nOn a completely different note, I'd like to make the most of this post (and I'm writing rhymes) (sorry about that). I recently learnt that I've been selected for a job in Aberdeen Scotland next year, so I wanted to know if there were any Aberdonian (if I'm not mistaking, and if I am I apologize) who would be willing to inform me of places to go (NB : I like food and books) and such things.\n\nThanks a lot !\n\nWho cares about Burroughs! **\n\nI am trying really hard and failing at not writing hooray!! that's great news about you coming to Scotland.\n\nI'm not an Aberdonian, nearest I lived to it was Perth, for about 6 months, which is about 45mins drive further south.\n\nBut I have been to it a few times, it's a lovely, small city, easy for walking and plenty of pubs, some good ones with live music. Having 2 universities there is enough going on for what I'm guessing here is your age range. You like food and books? - you'll be fine - it has both:) The books you can get free at the lovely Central Library, you might have to pay for the food though.Not a large amount of book shops, there is a Waterstones general chainstore type.(a nice second hand one called Old Aberdeen Bookshop.\n\nSo welcome a year or so in advance. :D\n\n**Probably lots of people care about Burroughs :)\n\nPosted these for you and ps only drawback they really talk a bit weird up there - that accent - geez.:wb:\n\nhttp://www.visitaberdeen.com/food-and-drink/bars/list\n\nhttp://www.thestudentroom.co.uk/wiki/aberdeen_nightlife\n\nJunkie and Naked Lunch are probably Burroughs most famous books (New York Times have Naked Lunch on a list of the 100 best books of the 20th century) so you´ve already read two of the best books he has to offer. Another good one is Interzone which is a collection of short stories and journals and among them are the story, The Junky's Christmas, which were made into an animated film (I believe it's on Youtube). All the stories are written in straight narrative (no \"cut-up\" stories).\n\nThere's also a book containing the letters he wrote to various people (like Ginsberg, Kerouac, etc.) between 1945 and 1959 which is quite interesting. The title is called, The Letters Of William S. Burroughs 1945-59, edited by Oliver Harris who also provides a long and interesting foreword. It contains many letters about the writing of Junkie and Naked Lunch. It was later followed up by a second book of letters dating from 1959-1974 which I found not quite as interesting as the first one.\n\nYou like food and books? - you'll be fine - it has both:) The books you can get free at the lovely Central Library, you might have to pay for the food though.Not a large amount of book shops, there is a Waterstones general chainstore type.(a nice second hand one called Old Aberdeen Bookshop.\n\nSo welcome a year or so in advance.\n\nThanks a lot for all of this Skygazer, it's mucho appreciado ! I think I already had stumbled across the studentroom link but thanks anyway. At least there's a Waterstones, that's a good point (believe it or not it's quite hard to find books that are not written in French around here ...). I guess I'm going to take a couple of days when I'm done with my work and go there just to visit and whatnot. Oh, and thanks for the heads up about the accent too ! They will probably have a hard time understand me and my own special accent !\n\nAnother good one is Interzone which is a collection of short stories and journals and among them are the story, The Junky's Christmas, which were made into an animated film (I believe it's on Youtube).

I'm going to check all of this. I think that I'm going to start with Interzone, the short story is the writing \"form\" which I tend to enjoy the more so ...\n\nHosh who posts on here spent some time studying in Aberdeen as it happens. He's a nice fella so I'm sure he won't mind giving you a few tips about the area.\n\nAlright that's good to know, merci !\n\nJunky was alright. I couldn't finish Naked lunch, although parts were interesting.\n\nAhah ! You know what ? I actually didn't enjoy the reading the very first time (and I was quite disappointed by that, since I had read the horrible French translation before that and hoped the original would be more appealing). I picked it up again later when I heard about Brion Gysin, the cut-up and whatnot."
