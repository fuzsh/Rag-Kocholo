        "text": "In Mexico on September 6, 1951, William Seward Burroughs II shot his wife Joan Vollmer in the head. His wife’s death inspired Burroughs to become a writer.\n\nIn the introduction of his book Queer, Burroughs wrote,\n\n“I am forced to the appalling conclusion that I would never have become a writer but for Joan’s death, and to a realization of the extent to which this event has motivated and formulated my writing.”\n\nQueer was the twelfth of fourteen novels published in Burroughs’s lifetime, but notably, it was the first he wrote. He started writing Queer the same year Vollmer died, but it was not published until 1985.\n\nBurroughs was an influential writer, visual artist, and a primary figure of the Beat Generation.\n\nThe Beginning"
