        "text": "I don’t know what led me to think about William S. Burroughs the other day. Maybe it was the same misbegotten impulse that led me and my friends to assume that we could hang out with him when he came to Huntsville 30 years ago.\n\nWe were living at the time in a rural community on the Tennessee River named Bluff City. The name was far too grand for the actuality. Though there was a bluff there, the “city\" consisted of six cinderblock houses, four of which we rented.\n\nI had read Burroughs when I was a student at Birmingham-Southern College in the mid-1960s. His novel “Naked Lunch\" had thrust him into national attention -- mostly, I suspect, because of the salacious title. I was more interested in his books like “Nova Express\" and “The Ticket That Exploded,\" where Burroughs projected his alienation as a misogynist homosexual junkie into a science-fiction landscape in which aliens with nasty habits were hounded by the Nova Police.\n\nHis method of cutting up sections of his manuscripts and pasting them back together at random to produce “found\" literature added to the spaced-out vibe of the books.\n\nIn short, we figured he was the/skind of guy who would just love to meet us.\n\nWe’d been out of college for a couple of years, but not long enough to realize the ’60s were over. During our senior year, Allen Ginsberg had come to Birmingham-Southern for a reading and hung out with some of us, talking enthusiastically about his interest in Gnostic literature and wondering where he could find “the real culture\" in Birmingham. We’d steered him away from a redneck bar on Fourth Street where he thought he could find it.\n\nSo when we read that Burroughs would be in our neck of the woods, we figured why not? It would be a blast rapping with him about Ginsberg, Jack Kerouac, Neil Cassady, Paul Bowles and the rest of his Beat buddies.\n\nHis reading, if I recall correctly, was at the University of Alabama in Huntsville as part of a series that had brought Truman Capote to the campus a few months before.\n\nIt was clear when we entered the room where a reception for Burroughs was already in full swing that this wasn’t his cup of tea.\n\nA hefty chunk of Capote’s audience -- aging matrons who just loved “A Christmas Memory\" -- had showed up, apparently in blissful ignorance of everything about Burroughs.\n\nThey and members of the university community chatted nervously over cups of punch. Burroughs sat aloof at a table in a corner, radiating contempt. You could cut the tension with a knife.\n\nBeside him was a rather high-strung young man who was introduced to us as his secretary.\n\nWe wasted little time in introducing ourselves to Burroughs.\n\n“Hi, I’m Ralph,\" said one of my friends, plopping down opposite of Burroughs and grabbing one of his skinny hands. “Who are you?\"\n\nI wanted to die. But Burroughs merely turned and shrugged coldly, flicking Ralph away like the ash on the end of his cigarette.\n\nAnother of us attempted a different gambit. “Why did you come to/sAlabama?\" he asked.\n\nBurroughs turned his piercing gaze to this new cretin, nailing him with his eyes.\n\n“Got a contract,\" he croaked.\n\nBurroughs had one of those singular voices. Flat as the Midwestern plains, it sounded like dry leather. He drawled out his syllables: cawn-tract. It was deadpan enough to be mocking and spooky at the same time.\n\nThe question wasn’t as insipid as it seemed. His family had Alabama roots, though he certainly didn’t volunteer this information to us.\n\nHis grandfather, who invented and patented the first adding machine and established the family fortune in the Burroughs Corp., died in Citronelle near Mobile.\n\nBurroughs, however, grew up in St. Louis. A thin and sickly child, he learned early to live inside his head. He became even more withdrawn after he was sexually abused at a prep school in New Mexico.\n\nYet he had a tremendous intellect and a mercilessly sardonic sense of humor. After he graduated from Harvard, he moved to New York, where he developed a 15-year heroin addiction.\n\nHe also fell in with Ginsberg, Kerouac and other struggling young writers.\n\nYet even his closest friends couldn’t cross his barricades. Although he was not much older than they, Burroughs styled himself as their mentor and critic, careful to keep a degree of mental distance from them.\n\nI’d always been fascinated by Cassady, one member of the circle of friends who had no literary aspirations at all. I asked Burroughs about Cassady’s reputation -- cemented in Kerouac’s books -- as a legendary freewheeling, nonstop rapper who could talk for days about almost anything under the sun.\n\nBurroughs studied me for a moment. I thought perhaps I’d asked him something that caught his interest.\n\n“Well,\" he finally replied, “one time I rode in a car with Cassady all the way across the country and he didn’t say a word.\"\n\nSo much for legends.\n\nAnd so much for hanging out with Burroughs.\n\nWe tried talking about a few other things, but he made it clear, in a gentlemanly, Midwestern way that he’d rather not. He kept looking around at the babbling audience of arts patrons as if he had stumbled into a nest of roaches.\n\nPerhaps he channeled some of his emotions into his reading that night, which was brilliant.\n\nI’ve heard some authors read their own works and fall flat on their faces. It’s almost painful to listen to recordings of Ernest Hemingway or James Joyce, for example.\n\nNot so Burroughs. He read with passion and cutting wit. His cracked-leather voice, it seemed to me, was the sound of America.\n\nIt was not a good night for the Huntsvillians who had doted on Truman Capote. Burroughs’ jarring concoction of politics, sex and drugs emptied large sections of the hall well before he finished.\n\nFor me, however, it was a revelation. Never before I had appreciated the depth of his jaundiced humor.\n\nListening to Burroughs read, it occurred to me that he could have been a great actor. He inhabited his characters, breathing life into their distorted, cut-up souls.\n\nYears later, Hollywood did pick up on Burroughs. He turned in a dynamite performance as a junkie priest in “Drugstore Cowboy.\"\n\nFor all of his talent and brilliance, however, it’s hard to read a biography about Burroughs without also feeling dismay and even revulsion.\n\nMuch of his life was spent in a failed attempt to flee from pain.\n\nHe accidentally killed his wife in a night of drunken revelry in 1951 in Mexico City. Freed on bail, he did not return to care for his son, Billy, who had been shunted off to live with Burroughs’ parents. Instead, he plunged into the jungles of Central America to locate a drug sacred to the Indians called yage.\n\nLater, he fled to Tangier, where he tried to banish his demons with powerful Moroccan majoun and opiates from the farmacia. Years later, he went on a methadone maintenance program to ward off the heroin hunger.\n\nHe also began writing, saying it helped banish “The Ugly Spirit,\" an invasive entity that controlled him when he shot his wife.\n\n“It’s a matter of catharsis,\" he said of “Naked Lunch,\" written mostly in Morocco, “where I say the most horrible things I can think of.\"\n\nHis son, Billy, desperate for attention from his father, would visit occasionally, only to be ignored as Burroughs drifted deeper into his escapes.\n\nBilly tried emulating his famous father. He wrote an autobiography, “Cursed from Birth,\" chronicling his own serious drug habit. His death in a ditch in 1981 was the final chapter of a lonely and dissolute life.\n\nBurroughs, who had moved to Paris, London and then back to Tangier, had returned to the United States, where he emerged as a pop celebrity, an eminence gris for a generation young enough to be his grandchildren.\n\nThe year his son died, Burroughs moved to Lawrence, Kan., where he spent his last years with his secretary/partner/life manager James Grauerholz.\n\nGrauerholz helped him organize his writing. He also shuttled Burroughs to his weekly methadone clinic and drove him back and forth to prairie shooting ranges to indulge his lifelong passion for firearms.\n\nNo, William S. Burroughs wasn’t the kind of person you could just hang out with.\n\nYet he wasn’t the icy iconoclast I believed him to be for years after our misbegotten encounter in Huntsville, either.\n\nTwo years ago, Grove Press published “Last Words: The Final Journals of William S. Burroughs,\" edited by Grauerholz. If it was no literary “Naked Lunch,\" the publication of these journals from 1996-97, the final year of Burroughs’ life, was a feast for fans of his writing.\n\nThere are no cut-ups here, though the journals are full of free associations and dreams, rivulets and puddles of thoughts, and ideas for works that would never be written.\n\nMixed in are rants against the nation’s war on drugs and its moral arbiter, William Bennett. There are passages on aging, as well, couched in Burroughs’ tough-guy prose.\n\n“Yes, where are the snows of yesterday. And the speedballs I useta know?\" he writes.\n\nBut the journals also reveal a different Burroughs, a man who wears his heart on his sleeve.\n\nOn the very first page, he pours out his sadness for his cat Calico, hit and killed by a car a few days before.\n\n“Cat was part of me,\" he writes in as simple and eloquent a statement of pain and grief as he would ever commit to paper.\n\nThere’s no tough talk or retreat into interior fantasy, either, when he writes about the deaths of Ginsberg and Timothy Leary and the long shadows stealing toward him over the flatlands of Kansas.\n\nPerhaps Burroughs had mellowed. Or maybe he had finally found a way to keep The Ugly Spirit at bay.\n\n“Love? What is It?\" he scrawled in his final journal passage three days before his death. “Most natural painkiller what there is.\"\n\nReach Editorial Editor Ben Windham at (205) 722-0193 or by e-mail at ben.windham@tuscaloosanews.com."
