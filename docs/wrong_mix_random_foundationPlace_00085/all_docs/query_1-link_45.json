Burroughs Cutting Up the Century is the definitive book on Burroughs' overarching cut-up project and its relevance to the American twentieth century. Burroughs' Nova Trilogy...remains the best known of his textual cut-up creations, but he committed more than a decade of his life to searching out multimedia for use in works of collage...Burroughs created an eclectic and wide-ranging countercultural archive. This volume includes previously unpublished work by Burroughs such as cut-ups of work written by his son, cut-ups of critical responses to his own work, collages on the Vietnam War and the Watergate scandal, excerpts from his dream journals, and some of the few diary entries that Burroughs wrote about his wife, Joan...also featur(ing) original essays, interviews, and discussions by established Burroughs scholars, respected artists, and people who encountered Burroughs.\" (from back cover) A monumental compilation of writings by & about William S. Burroughs & his prolific cut-up works in myriad media which continue to profoundly impact literature, art & culture in America & all over the world. Beside heretofore-unpublished works of cut-up text, collage & artworks by WSB himself are contributions of deeply insightful articles by such luminaries as Oliver Harris, Kurt Hemmer, Davis Schneiderman, Chad Weidner & Regina Weinreich- all of whom are our esteemed colleagues at the European Beat Studies Network (ebsn.eu); as well as Barry Miles, Eric Sandweiss, Anne Waldman & other such foremost WSB authorities-collaborators. Several of the contributions relate to presentations given at WSB centennial celebration conferences held at City University of New York (CUNY) & University of Indiana at Bloomington (publisher of this volume) during 2014- including Sandweiss' \"Cut-Up City: William S. Burroughs' \"St. Louis Return\",\" based on his presentation which this writer attended at the IU conference- a mind-blowing combination of WSB cut-up philosophy & urbanism which those who are passionate about both will find most stimulating. With many reproductions of photographs, collages, artworks etc., some in color. Edited & with introduction by Joan Hawkins, co-organizer of the IU Centennial Conference; & Alex Wermer-Colan, organizer of the CUNY Centennial Conference. Large-format \"doorstop\" first softcover edition, published simultaneously with a hardcover edition, second printing as indicated by number sequence on copyright page. A most highly recommended, rich & important compilation of top-drawer WSB scholarship & rarely seen exemplars of his own work. In very fine condition with only very slight wear & a few tiny bumps, creases at thin edges & corners of front, back covers & spine; one small, non-penetrating shallow dimple-gauge near upper left corner-edge of front cover; tiny amount of rubbing at lower right edge-corner of text block. Interior very fine with only tiny bumps at corners of a few page leaves. Very Fine. [Item #4237]"
