        "text": "I’ve always been fascinated by the The Midwestern US and its history, the people and the culture. Flying over the Midwest, I am always captivated by the landscape— the farms, the space, the flatness, the straight roads that connect the small towns.\n\nWilliam Burroughs was born in 1914 in St. Louis, Missouri. His journey through life was a wild ride. Like most young men of his era, he was expected to charter a course that was predictable and conforming. However, his path had no signs of predictability or conforming to society or preconceptions. He was a writer, a painter and a performer of the spoken word. His relationship with Allen Ginsberg and Jack Kerouac became the foundation of the Beat Generation.\n\nThe dark side of Burroughs is mysterious and alluring in the same way a scary movie has you screaming “Don’t go in there!” yet you can’t stop watching and awaiting the next move. His heroin addiction and experiments with other drugs seem to have been at the helm of his wild ride.\n\nAn interesting interview with Burroughs in the Paris Review in 1965 paints a multidimensional picture of his thought process and organization of ideas that I find fascinating. It speaks to the concept of “seeing” that I believe is critically important and feels like a lost sense today, with the excessive imagery and visual and audio noise that is blasted at us every day. “Seeing” to me is a lot more than having vision in terms of eyesight. It’s about allowing yourself to connect some dots in your mind that weave together clues that are around us at all times, but get hidden behind mundane thoughts and activities. It’s about seeing beauty in reality and not letting some long standing notion of beauty fence you out of awareness.\n\nA beautiful bouquet is an example of this idea. Once the flowers and leaves start to wilt and change color, most people think its over. But its just beginning, that’s when it gets really beautiful… the unexpected shapes and colors and the slow dance it does as it twists and folds around itself. That process connects a lot of dots, such as how we perceive beauty, how little patience we have or how close-minded most people are about what’s around them and how things might relate to one another. “Seeing” is about taking it all in and seeing things from many angles, connecting it to experience or allowing it to inspire and inform ideas. — angela"
