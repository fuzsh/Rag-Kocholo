        "text": "Bennettsville, SC\n\nMrs. Dimitra Bakogianni, age 81, passed away, Saturday July 13, 2024, peacefully at her home surrounded by her loving family. She was affectionately known as “Mimi” to all of those who knew her well.\n\nBorn July 20, 1942, in the village of Klafsi, Greece, located in the mountainous region of Evritania. Mimi was the middle daughter of 5 girls, and she was a devoted daughter and sister to her family. She moved to Athens at the age of 13 and trained as a seamstress to help support her family back in her village.\n\nIn her mid-twenties, she was reintroduced to a village friend in Athens, Dimitri Bakogiannis, who would become her husband on November 23rd, 1969. They immigrated to the United States in 1971 and settled in Myrtle Beach, before moving to Florence, SC. In 1982, they moved to Bennettsville, SC and owned & operated the Dairy Dream for the past 42 years.\n\nMimi was always proud of her native homeland of Greece, always ready to talk about her humble beginnings but thankful for living the American Dream as a US citizen. She was known as a passionate gardener and for her welcoming hospitality, with her generous outpouring of love and food, especially her Baklava! She especially loved to work at Dairy Dream where she would help to make and prepare food, to interact with her employees who became her second family, and to say hello to customers. Serving was at the center of her heart. She loved to visit with family and friends, to host gatherings, and to assist others whenever she could. She loved to help with the Greek festival in Florence and spend time with her dear friends from that community. But first in her life was her love for God. She had a close relationship with Him, was a born-again believer, and someone who prayed and loved to read the Word in her quiet time. She also loved her church family and spending time fellowshipping with them. She and Mr. Jim loved to travel to visit them across various states. She leaned on God throughout her life with all its challenges and was grateful to Him for all His blessings. She always thanked Him for all her answered prayers, with one of the biggest being her residence in Bennettsville.\n\nBennettsville was home for the past 42 years. She could never express enough gratitude to friends who became family, community members who welcomed them, and the outpouring of support for the Dairy Dream.\n\nSurviving are her two sons, Lt. Col. Panos Christian Bakogiannis and wife Heather of Fuquay Varina, NC and Daniel Emannuel Bakogiannis and wife Janelle of Bennettsville; her sisters Maria and Georgia of Greece, and her sister Helen of Asheville. She also has five grandchildren: Ethan Dimitri Bakogiannis (21), Hayden William Bakogiannis (18), James Herbert Bakogiannis (12), David Christian Bakogiannis (10), and Margot Dimitra Bakogiannis (7). Mimi also has numerous nieces, nephews and other extended family members, that she always delighted in, throughout Greece and the United States If you feel led, please consider donation to Hand of Hope Pregnancy Center 607 North Ennis Street, Fuquay Varina, NC 27526 in honor of Mrs. Dimitra Bakogiannis. https://www.handofhope.net/giving-circle-of-hope\n\nALS Association North Carolina Chapter, 4 North Blount Street Suite 200, Raleigh, NC 27601 www.alsnc.org.\n\nFuneral Services will be held 11:00 A.M. on Thursday, July 18, 2024, at Burroughs Funeral Home with burial to follow at Oak Ridge Cemetery.\n\nVisitation will be held from 5:00 to 7:00 P.M. on Wednesday, July 17, 2024, at Burroughs Funeral Home.\n\nThe Bakogiannis family will receive friends on Monday, July 15, 2024, from 2-5 P.M. and on Tuesday, July 16, 2024, from 4-7 P.M. at their residence, 802 Jefferson St. Bennettsville, SC.\n\nFrom the bottom of our hearts, the family thanks each and every person for your grace and understanding during this difficult time.\n\nOnline condolences may be made @ www.bfhbennettsville.com.\n\nBurroughs Funeral Home is honored to serve the Bakogiannis family."
