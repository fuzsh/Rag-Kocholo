        "text": ">> return to WILLIAM S. BURROUGHS main page >>\n\nSECTION A:\n\nThis index includes books, pamphlets, and broadsides (excluding foreign language translations, interviews and some miscellaneous prose) from 1957 to 1973: roughly the period of time covered by the Maynard and Miles Bibliography (ref. M&M).\n\n1. Lee, William. JUNKIE\n\na. First edition:\n\nNew York: Ace Books Inc., 1953\n\nPerfect-bound in printed and illustrated wrappers, 4.25” x 6.5”, 320 pages, bound back to back with Maurice Helbrant’s Narcotic Agent. Publisher’s note by Carl Solomon (not credited).\n\n(M&M A1a) *\n\nWilliam Burroughs’ first book, written under the pseudonym ‘William Lee’ (his mother’s maiden name).\n\nAccording to Beatbooks catalog #92: Ace Books was owned by Carl Solomon’s uncle, A.A. Wyn, a connection made by Allen Ginsberg who was acting as Burroughs’s agent at the time. The publication of Nelson Algren’s novel The Man With The Golden Arm in 1949 inspired a trend for books about junkies, many of them mass-market paperbacks sold in newsagents rather than bookshops, and with commercial success in mind Wyn agreed to publish Burroughs. Though written in a noir-ish hard-boiled style, Junkie is autobiographical (the “Confessions of an Unredeemed Drug Addict”), and lacks the kind of plot that readers of the genre attracted by Al Rossi’s lurid cover art might have expected.\n\nBurroughs’s picaresque and frequently humorous narrative, with its hip talk and junkie jargon, is also told from the detached point of view of the hipster-addict, a neutrality which Wyn sought to counter-balance by yoking it to a reprint of Helbrant’s 1941 account of his “War Against the Dope Menace”. Burroughs was initially appalled at this appendage, but his motivation for writing Junkie was, as he later wrote, money and recognition, though neither were forthcoming at first as the book was largely ignored at the time of publication. More significantly, by mixing an orthodox narrative of drug experiences with occasional forays into set-pieces, or routines, Junkie also paved the way for Naked Lunch.\n\nb. First UK edition:\n\nLondon: Digit Books, 1957\n\nPerfect-bound in printed and illustrated wrappers, 4.5” x 7.25”, 160 pages.\n\n(M&M A1b) *\n\nAccording to Beatbooks catalog #92: First UK edition, and the first edition of Junkie as a separate item. Front cover art by Al Rossi, based on his earlier artwork for Ace Books. His sensational back cover art depicts a blonde with hypo and rolled-down stocking, and it was probably this, at least in part, that provoked the British censors to suppress the book after publication and order all the remaining copies to be pulped.\n\n2. Burroughs, William. LETTER FROM A MASTER ADDICT TO DANGEROUS DRUGS\n\na. First edition:\n\nShrewsbury: British Journal of Addiction, 1957\n\nSide-stapled sheets, 5.5″ x 8.5″, 13 pages, 50 copies.\n\n(see M&M C1) *\n\nAn offprint of the Burroughs article appearing in the January 1957 issue of British Journal of Addiction (Vol. 53, No. 2) edited by John Yerbury Dent (M&M C1). This is Burroughs’ first appearance in print under his own name.\n\n3. Burroughs, William S. THE NAKED LUNCH\n\na. First edition:\n\nParis: Olympia Press, July 1959\n\nSewn signatures bound in printed wrappers in printed and illustrated dust jacket, 4.5″ x 7″, 232 pages, 5000 copies. Dust jacket designed by Burroughs. Issued as No. 76 in the Traveller’s Companion Series. Preliminary issue with price on lower wrapper not canceled with over-stamp.\n\n(M&M A2a)\n\nAccording to Beatbooks catalog #89: Price on lower wrapper not canceled (copies distributed following the revaluation of the Franc in January 1960 had the printed price stamped over).\n\nb. First US edition, revised:\n\nNew York City: Grove Press, 1962\n\nHardcover in paper and cloth-bound boards with gilt-stamped spine in printed and illustrated dust jacket, 5.5″ x 8″, 256 pages, 3500 copies. Printed prospectus issued.\n\n(M&M A2b)\n\nThe contents of this edition differ from the Olympia first edition. This Grove Press edition includes as the Introduction, “Deposition: Testimony Concerning a Sickness” [first published in Evergreen Review, Vol. 4, No. 11 (January-February 1960) (M&M C12)] and, as the Appendix,“Letter from a Master Addict to Dangerous Drugs” [first published in The British Journal of Addiction, Vol. 53, No. 2 (January 1957) (M&M C1)].\n\nAccording to BeatBooks catalog #20, publication of this edition triggered obscenity trials in Los Angeles and Boston.\n\n4. Burroughs, William S. EXCERPT FROM PANTAPON ROSE\n\na. First edition:\n\nSan Francisco: Wallace Berman, 1959\n\nBroadside, 4″ x 5″, letterpress printed by Wallace Berman.\n\n(see M&M C11)\n\nThis broadside is laid into Semina, No. 4, edited by Wallace Berman (M&M C11).\n\n5.

Haselwood and James F. McIlroy. Illustrated by Brion Gysin.

First edition, second printing:\n\nSan Francisco: Dave Haselwood Books, 1967\n\nSewn signatures bound in printed and illustrated wrappers, 6″ x 9″, 51 pages, 1000 copies.

Cover art by Burroughs. Author photo by Charles Henri Ford.\n\n(M&M A5b) *\n\nAccording to Beat Books catalog #48: Burroughs completely rewrote the text for this edition, partly as a response to criticisms that the first edition had been difficult to read.\n\nAccording to Am Here catalog #3: This constitutes the revised expanded edition advertised but never published by Olympia.\n\n8. Burroughs, William. THE TICKET THAT EXPLODED\n\na. First edition:\n\nParis: Olympia Press, December 1962\n\nSewn signatures bound in printed wrappers in printed and photo-illustrated dust jacket, 4.25″ x 6.75″, 184 pages, 5000 copies.

First edition:\n\nNew Orleans: Loujon Press, c.1965\n\nBroadside, 6″ x 9″, letterpress printed by Jon Edgar Webb and Gypsy Lou Webb.\n\n(see M&M C46)\n\nAn offprint of the Burroughs contribution to The Outsider, No. 2, edited by Jon Edgar Webb and Gypsy Lou Webb (M&M C46).\n\nAccording to Jeff Weddle in “The Loujon Press: An Historical Analysis”: Burroughs’ submission for issue two originally bore the title, “Cuts from ‘Word Line’ William Burroughs for Hassan i Sabbah.” The piece was done using Burroughs’ distinctive, jumbled, “cut-up” technique and had no easily discernible narrative flow or quickly grasped meaning. Perhaps for these reasons, Webb heavily edited and re-titled the piece, casting it as a poem in The Outsider number two. Burroughs’ manuscript bears a notation, again in Webb’s hand, stating that the piece was “condensed and rearranged into “wilt caught in time,” the title under which it appeared in the magazine. While Webb’s version of Burroughs’ piece bears little resemblance to the author’s original submission, no record has been uncovered showing Burroughs’ response to Webb’s heavy editing of his work.\n\n18. Burroughs, William S. HEALTH BULLETIN: APO-33\n\na. First edition:\n\nNew York: Fuck You Press, 1965\n\nSide-stapled sheets with printed and illustrated cover, 8.5″ x 11″, 54 pages, 10-20 copies, mimeograph printed by Ed Sanders.\n\n(M&M A12a) *\n\nAccording to Sanders “maybe as many as ten or twenty” copies were distributed before he halted publication due to Burroughs’ dissatisfaction with the copy he’d received.\n\nb. Second edition:\n\nSan Francisco: Beach Books, Texts, & Documents, 1966\n\nSaddle-stapled in printed wrappers, 8.5″ x 11″, 24 pages, 3000 copies.\n\n(M&M A12b)\n\nThis printing is a photo-offset reproduction of Burroughs’ manuscript and scrapbook pages, featuring the three-column cut-up style, compiled by Mary Beach and Claude Pélieu.\n\n19. Burroughs, William S. THE INVISIBLE GENERATION\n\na. First edition:\n\nLondon: Project Sigma, December 1966\n\nBroadside, 11.5″ x 17″, 1000 copies, offset printed.\n\n(see M&M C159)\n\nThis item was not given a Sigma index number and no evidence exists to show distribution except by International Times itself which provided the offprints. Reprinted from International Times, No. 3 (November 1966) (M&M C157).\n\n20. Burroughs, William S. THE INVISIBLE GENERATION (continued)\n\na. First edition:\n\nLondon: Lovebooks Ltd, December 1966\n\nBroadside, 22.5″ x 30.25″, 200 copies, silk-screened, designed by Michael English so that part of the card could be cut out and assembled to make a word-machine.
