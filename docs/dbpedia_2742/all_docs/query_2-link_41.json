        "text": "Before everybody piles on here, I'll say that we don't actually have a specific thread for all this stuff that's open that I can find, so give the kid a break. If you don't like the stuff, like most of us don't, fine... we get it... you have been heard.\n\nTo the OP, like other people posted, you probably aren't gonna get much good feedback for this stuff here because it's not what we're into. Old Faith No More is great in my book, that's about it for me. I'll leave this one up and maybe you'll get some takers. Please stop posting a bunch of threads about it.\n\nBeing open to trying out anything and everything isn't something to apologize about. That's a good thing, and you should try to hold onto it as long as possible. That being said, while no one's going to ever stop you from listening to what you want, you'll find that most metal fans tend to have very strong opinions about what is and is not \"real metal\", not to mention what is and is not GOOD metal. Depending on where you're at, bringing up certain bands or styles just isn't going to net you a lot of positive conversation. You need to know how to \"read the room\", and adjust accordingly.\n\nYeah we get it cara, exploring the wide world of music is muita fun. Wouldn't ever want to inhibit your curiosity. Listen to whatever you want and you can even feel free to post about it here on the board for anyone who may be interested. Doesn't even have to be metal, that's not a problem, it's all good. You just don't need to start a whole new thread for every little metal adjacent fringe micro-genre that catches your ear.\n\nThey have dedicated threads for all kinds of different metal sub-genres here on the site, so if you don't see one for rap rock or alternative rock or metalcore or whatever, maybe take that as a clue that it's outside the scope of what most of us are interested in or would consider to be metal. Esse velhinho has spent many years on forums seeing the same silly questions from what I'll assume are young people about the same tired old mainstream sub-genres that too often get lumped in with metal, like rap rock and nu-metal and metalcore...over and over again. So perdoe-me if I got annoyed upon seeing the six millionth one and took it out on you. Know that your participation is welcome here mano. Have fun.\n\nHow's it going, my fellow metalhead? Love several of these choices! Rage Against the Machine, Biohazard, and Stuck Mojo have all long been favorites of mine. I haven't checked out much Clawfinger, although I've enjoyed the little bit that I've heard through the years. Although I don't play as much rap/metal as I used to, I definitely enjoy it from time to time. Have you ever checked out a band called Insolence? They're really solid!"
