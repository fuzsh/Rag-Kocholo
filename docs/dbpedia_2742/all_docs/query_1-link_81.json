        "text": "(music: DÃ¢M-Funk â âItâs My Lifeâ)\n\nJeff âChairmanâ Mao\n\nSome rare DÃ¢M-Funk demos right there.\n\nDÃ¢M-Funk\n\nActually, some of that is going to be coming out on Stones Throw under the title Adolescent Funk in a couple of months so look out for that.\n\nJeff âChairmanâ Mao\n\nSo, how old were you when you were making those tracks?\n\nDÃ¢M-Funk\n\nI would say I was timeless, as I am now. But Iâll be fair, it was in the middle of high school. I have been around. When I donât shave, like today, you can tell. But Iâm still young at heart and, like I said, I am from the Generation X. We were the generation that came before all the technology, Jeff, after everything was primitive, so I am right in between. I can learn from some of the younger people that I kick it with, and I can teach some of the people who came before me. For instance, Iâm producing an album now forâ¦ damn, I gave it away, I was going to give away something. Can I do this, Jeff? Just to make a little bit of fun for everybody, I have got the new album out with me, itâs a double CD Toeachizown and I hope you guys dig it, but if somebody can tell me who the lead singer of a group called Slave was, the first person I will give the CD to.\n\nJeff âChairmanâ Mao\n\nI won this trivia in New York if you remember? Thatâs the only way I get Stones Throw to give me records.\n\nDÃ¢M-Funk\n\nCan anyone in this room tell me who the lead singer of a group called Slave was by raising your hand?\n\nJeff âChairmanâ Mao\n\nAnybody? Slave from the great state of Ohio, which is a place where many, many influential funk artists are from. Anybody? Slave? Anybody? Funk group called Slave?\n\nDÃ¢M-Funk\n\nThey had songs like âJust a Touch of Love, âWatching You,â solo stuff like âWeak at the Knees,â âNobody Can Be You But You,â in London, you guys might know a song called âDancing In The Key Of Lifeâ? Still no one?\n\nJeff âChairmanâ Mao\n\nYou are not from Ohio, though.\n\nDÃ¢M-Funk\n\nI am from Los Angeles, but we love the funk on the West Coast, and that is what explains some of the stuff that you just heard. In LA, we have got a culture of funk appreciation.\n\nJeff âChairmanâ Mao\n\nSet the scene for all of us. Going back, what was going on about this time when you first started getting into the music, what was happening around you? How did you come to get into specifically this type of style?\n\nDÃ¢M-Funk\n\nAround the time I started this music playing and creating it, actually, it was in the midst of hip-hop, the golden era, Eric B & Rakim, EPMD, Slick Rick, those cats were hitting on the hip-hop scene. We had a station in LA called K-Day, and it was one of the first stations ever that played hip-hop 24 hours. But Iâm not going to try and mix this up and make you guys feel good about this hip-hop love. We were more funksters and we grew up on Prince, Egyptian Lover, LA Dream Team, Ready for the World, that was the stuff that we listened to. We liked hip-hop as well but it didnât rule our lives.\n\nJeff âChairmanâ Mao\n\nLA was a different type of scene that way. Do you remember Uncle Jammâs Army and stuff like that. Can you explain to everybody here what that was?\n\nDÃ¢M-Funk\n\nYouâre talking about the LA Sports Arena packed with 20,000 people, nothing but people dancing. You guys have heard about Egyptian Lover, right? Of course. This is another thing, for people who are just getting into this thing and becoming artists, or have been artists and are just learning from today and being at [the] Red Bull [Music Academy]. You can have a great regional scene. You donât have to be popular in every single place. This dude was packing arenas and was just a situation. They would have full-blown-out shows with outfits and choreographed steps and it was just a big social scene and they even did it in Pasadena, where I grew up. That was a little bit outside of Los Angeles, and they would come to the Civic Center, and would just have some fun. Some of it was interesting, because where I grew up in LA we had a gang culture. And unfortunately, sometimes those parties got out of control. Just think about it, on a Sunday we would have these big parties, not on a Saturday but Sunday in the daytime. You knew that the party was the bomb if some shots got popped off. Itâs a shame but that is just the way it was. If you find yourself running home on Sunday afternoon when âKnee Deepâ by Funkadelic was playing, you knew it was a great party. I know it sounds silly but that is just the way it was. Egyptian Lover and that kind of funk was part of that backdrop of the times I grew up in the early â80s and mid-â80s in Pasadena in Los Angeles. Then hip-hop started coming, Dr Dre and those cats, they didnât start slowing down the tempos until â89 and â90 â everybody was up-tempo.\n\nJeff âChairmanâ Mao\n\nEarly LA hip-hop was a lot more informed by electro and it wasnât really until Dre came and maybe Ice Tâ¦\n\nDÃ¢M-Funk\n\nâ6 âN The Morning,â have you guys ever heard that track? I mean, I donât want to start quizzing everybody. This is some of the essential stuff.\n\nJeff âChairmanâ Mao\n\nThereâll be a written quiz later on. I guess, maintaining your focus on what you are doing, how did you withstand the trends as things were changing, as far as hip-hop being more dominant in LA? Did the funk stuff always have its champions, such as yourself, or did you catch flak from not going with the hip-hop thing full throttle?\n\nDÃ¢M-Funk\n\nNo flak. I think what it was in my neighborhood, there was athletes, musicians. Iâm sure this is everybodyâs neighborhood, there was always those categories that people were in. And I was just a musician who was still a part of a clique that was cool, but I was still able to do the musician thing. I was into a lot of genres as well. I was into metal, I was into new wave, I was into all kinds of stuff, but funk just seemed to be the one that got me. When hip-hop got popular in LA, some of the first demos I made were over instrumentals from âI Need A Beatâ by LL Cool J. Me and my friends would play that, and I would tape loop it, pause it and we would rap on top of it. Those are my first productions, just recording stuff on wax and then I started putting those tapes out to my friends, and then after a while I was like, âMan, I am digging this Roger Troutman and Zapp stuff.â In the neighborhood, Nissan pick-up trucks were very popular, and a lot of the cats who were hustlers, they used to get the soundsystems in their car. So, the only stuff that sounded good in their car in our neighborhoods that bumped was like âMore Bounce To The Ounce.â If you came up playing âMore Bounce To The Ounceâ by Zapp, it just sounded right, you just got the girls. You didnât really sound too cool with some of the East Coast hip-hop stuff, you had to have some funk, like âAtomic Dogâ or that kind of thing. When I started realizing that it's a slightly different style, I started looking for more funk, but it was hard to find at the record stores. Eventually, I worked at a record store called Poo-Bah at Pasadena. It exists now, but there is a new level. I was the first kid who actually worked there, this is another little side history. The Poo-Bah you know now, I was the first young guy to actually work at that place and the guy Jay Green, who originally owned that, he just showed me the ropes about how to run a business. He always kept the record prices low and beat the other record stores, because they always tried to charge a lot. But you keep it low, so everybody comes to your store and he started buying more funk, and I got more into that. It just showed that there is a great style out here that I can be a part of, and I started making tapes and compilations and started passing them out to my friends at school. That is how, after the metal thing, after being into Rush and all those kinds of groups and Kiss and Iron Maiden, I was just into music, man. I just love music.\n\nJeff âChairmanâ Mao\n\nNow, you did do some apprenticeships, right? You got some session work as well off of that. Can you talk a little bit about that as far as getting a foot in the door for your career?\n\nDÃ¢M-Funk\n\nThatâs a good point. It is OK to actually hook up with somebody that has more experience than you to help you get into the game and show you the ropes. Mine was Leon Sylvers, he was a producer for SOLAR records that produced groups like Shalamar, that was big in London.\n\nJeff âChairmanâ Mao\n\nDoes anybody know SOLAR records, âSound Of Los Angeles Recordsâ? Sorry, I didnât mean to interrupt you, as you drink your beverage.\n\nDÃ¢M-Funk\n\nThat was a great Red Bull break! He produced groups like Dynasty, Midnight Star, a lot of people, but the point is he actually was the bass player and the writer of songs like âMisdemeanor,â which was heavily sampled. Of course, âOnly Oneâ he wrote, rest in peace J Dilla, he sampled that for the Donuts album. I worked with some cats that really knew what was happening. Why Iâm telling you this is because if you want to make moves and strides in the game, it is good to connect with people who already know. Donât look at the elders as like, âThat old dude, he doesnât know whatâs going on, the game has changed.â Do not ever do that because they can really share some wealth. Wisdom. I always respected elders.\n\nThat is one thing I can pride myself on. I never looked at the old guys like, âGet out of here, man. My little warbly beats are better than yours. You are old-school, Iâm doing dubstep now.â I never looked at it like that. You should never do that. These cats are walking aroundâ¦ they might not have the chips or connections that you do now, but they have the wisdom. So, I would just suggest listen to some of the older cats, they really can help you. Just little tidbits of information.\n\nThat goes back to my thing I was going to say before when everybody lost the quiz â no big deal, weâll do another one â but I respect everybody. There is too much music out there to check out and thatâs why you didnât know the answer, but I am working with this cat called Steve Arrington and he is the lead singer of Slave, and why I went back and got him is because I respect my elders. He has still got it, he is 53 years old and still killing the game. More soulful vocals than anybody I have heard out right now, and it just showsâ¦ If you guys hook up with somebody and you know somebody that is good in your neighborhood, or an older cat, or if you are a producer, give them a shot. You see homegirl from American Idol, she is like destroying record sales. Donât give up on the elders, that is my point.\n\nJeff âChairmanâ Mao\n\nThat is pretty cool, actually, Steve Arrington. As a side note, what was Steve up to recently? Was he still in music doing anything?\n\nDÃ¢M-Funk\n\nHe went on to do some stuff. He became a minister. He got away from the game for a minute and got deep into that, but now he is coming back into it, which really humbled me and showed me that I am doing something right. He said he was looking at some videos on YouTube and got familiar with what I was doing. He was already aware of what I was doing. I always respected him, and me and Peanut Butter Wolf of Stones Throw, which is the guy who I owe a lot of my current exposure â I wonât say success but I will say exposure to my friends that I share music with â I owe a lot to Peanut Butter Wolf because he gave me my shot to get familiar with you folks and more people worldwide to share this music that you just heard being made in my bedroom since 1988. Me and him always liked Steve Arringtonâs vocals, and he is going to be putting the album out on Stones Throw records, and I have got the full production on it.\n\nJeff âChairmanâ Mao\n\nThatâs going to be pretty cool. I guess, I mentioned the session work that you did, can you talk a little bit about that? What sort of stuff were you doing? What sort of artists?\n\nDÃ¢M-Funk\n\nYeah, Jeff. After Leon Sylvers â and this is an interesting story, because we had gone from the cassette-tape stuff in high school, making tapes with friends, posters on the wall in my bedroom of Kiss and Iron Maiden, and Prince posters as well. Every Tuesday when a new record came out with the new releases, I would ditch school to buy the new Prince album. I would make an excuse. I had good grades. Thatâs another thing. This is all going to make sense, Jeff, everybody. I just have to explain it to you. I want everybody in here, everybody, of course, is out of school, I think. If youâre not, cool, but donât let the next man make you think it is cool to do bad in school. You can still be cool, but you can still pass. You can still get good grades. Thatâs the way you do it.\n\nI got good grades, so I was able to be in a program where you got off at 12 noon. Even if I wasnât off at 12 noon, I would be at the record store and I would get the new Prince album when it came out, all the way from Parade, Sign Oâ The Times, everything. I would just be on my moped and I would get the album and I would go home and sit in the chair, and my parents werenât there, because I was a latchkey kid, so they got off of work later. I would just open up my windows and listen to Prince and rock back and forward in the chair. This is where I got all the stuff that I had inside, because music was my friend, and I can tell it is your friend as well. After that point, I fast-forward to the point where I got all of this music in my head and I worked at the record store Poo-Bahâs, and I did session work with Leon, learned a lot from him. Then I came back and was like, âMan, what Iâm doing?â Leon had me in the studio with Milli Vanilli and I am like, âWhat is this?â But that is a learning experience as well, that was in Rio, Nevada. It was before one of the members unfortunately did the wrong move, but I learned a lot from those times. Then I came back to Pasadena and thought, âWhat am I going to do? Get a job? Drive a truck? I want to do music.â I met a friend by the name of Binky in a group by the name of Allfrumtha I. He was from Inglewood and he was signed with Mack 10, a popular rapper from LA in the â90s on Priority Records, and he got his start from Ice Cube. So eventually, he knew what I was doing, playing keyboards making the tapes. I started doing sessions with him, which turned into session work with Mack 10, turned into session work with WC, turned into session work with Ice Cube, and I got to know these cats and we respected each other. I got credit on the records under the name DÃ¢M, or Damon Riddick, or Damon G. Riddick. I was playing keyboards and I made some good money. But then I realized, being in the studio sometimes, with 20 dudes, too many people in the studio, I was like, âOK, this is cool but I would rather be just making the music. It kind of distracts a little bit.â It was fun, but like I said, I survived and nothing bad happened to me. I know there are horror stories that people have heard about with that era. But dude, they were professional. This is one thing I want to clear up about that whole West Coast rap scene at that time. They get a bum rep, like they were animals â it wasnât like that. I got paid and everything was professional. Iâm saying, if you guys get a shady offer sometimes, treat people individually on a one-on- one basis. Donât listen to what a lot of people say. Game recognizes game. Treat somebody with respect, and they will treat you with respect. If you do get a deal or offer, look at it and weigh the options, and if you feel good in your gut, that is when you go for it. It paid off for me. Those are the kind of people I did session work with.\n\nJeff âChairmanâ Mao\n\nBut, around this time, were you able to have that support you more-or-less, being a session musician, or did you have to do day jobs as well?\n\nDÃ¢M-Funk\n\nGood question, Jeff. I always kept a day job, because I like to have money. I always tell people that. I never wanted to be one of the broke musicians. But I do understand that there are broke musicians. I understand that it is a part of the process and the artistic avenue of being creative. Iâd just rather had wanted to keep money in my pocket. I drove trucks and I still recorded music at night time, and I drove across the freeway, still had my day job, had my radio on the side of my truck, still listening to stuff I was doing. I was always working, because I wanted to keep my apartment. I left home at 18 and I never went back. I never wanted to be that cat to go back to Pops and he be like, âI think itâs time to empty your trash.â If I ever went back home and inherit that, I probably would have slashed my throat. No, I would never do that, but you know what Iâm saying. I wouldnât want to give my dad the chance to say that. I always tried to keep money in my pocket while I was pursuing music. Plus, I wanted to prove to him â and the fellas in here can know about that son and father struggle â I just wanted to prove to him that I can do this. It feels so good right now! It feels so good right now [applause].\n\nJeff âChairmanâ Mao\n\nItâs like being on Oprah or something. Just donât start weeping.\n\nDÃ¢M-Funk\n\nNever, never. My eyes are dry. Itâs all good.\n\nJeff âChairmanâ Mao\n\nWere you still collecting keyboards and stuff like that? I know you have a studio with a lot of different vintage equipment and stuff like that. Was that sort of something that you were able to do around this time as well?\n\nDÃ¢M-Funk\n\nI collected keyboards all the while. I collected records. So, I was doing both. I was collecting records and collecting keyboards. The keyboards I preferred were analog keyboards, such as Oberheim DMX drum machines, the Juno 60, the Juno series from Roland, Moog Source. A lot of weird keyboards that I still use from then that you heard in the cassette tapes is what I used on this [holds up album]. The reason why this album is interesting for myself, and I love sharing it with you guys is because this first record, I wanted to prove again all that stuff that I just talked about â tied into my pops, tied into having a job, tied into having the radio in my truck driving and stuff, the session work, Leon Sylvers, my friends, the Kiss posters on the wall and all that stuff â it is because I used those same instruments on this album that you have right now. All the way from â88 I had the same instruments you heard used on this, and I recorded this record just like I did with the cassette tapes. I didnât use any Logic, I didnât use Pro Tools. I used two CD recorders and a RadioShack mixer and a Pioneer DJ 800 mixer. Thatâs what I used on this double CD that you hear. The mastering is what makes it sound good. Everybody in the room, all the recording you are doing, definitely get a good mastering person, because they can do wonders too. The bulk of it is just raw, being played all the way through.\n\nJeff âChairmanâ Mao\n\nSo, they were more or less live takes from what you were doing?\n\nDÃ¢M-Funk\n\nYes, no looping. But I love looping, and I am tired of me saying this. People thinking Iâm against sampling. I am never against sampling. I love all ways of creating music. Seriously, I do. I was just explaining to the people out there that you can actually make an album the way I recorded it and have it stand on its own legs. People should be happy for me acknowledging that, because what Iâm trying to show is that you can record any way you want to. I have never said Iâm against sampling or looping or any of that. I was trying to let you guys know in a double-entendre way, just to show that you can record any way you want to, and it can stand on its own two feet, and thatâs the way I did it. If youâre recording on primitive equipment, as long as it sounds good and makes sense to the people on the other end, do it. Maybe you will have an executive producer realize that this is some cool stuff, like I did with Peanut Butter Wolf.\n\nJeff âChairmanâ Mao\n\nDo you want to play us something off of the album, actually? Obviously, you have gotten quite a lot of acclaim for this record and the singles leading up to it. I wonder if you can also talk about the sounds. What is it about the sounds that you get from these particular instruments that appeals to you, besides the fact that they were the sounds that you grew up with?\n\nDÃ¢M-Funk\n\nThese sounds, because they are more warm. It appeals to me because I like warm-sounding pads, I like things to sound beautiful but still street. My thingâ¦ I like to focus on the beauty of things. Iâm not afraid to be beautiful. I know that sounds hilarious, but I am not afraid to sound beautiful or embrace things that are beautiful. To me, there is nothing wrong with touching that part of your heart where you think of sunsets or stars. But I still like to acknowledge the beat. For instance, tracks like this â letâs see if we can cue it up the right way, this is called âBrookside Park.â Still hitting for the streets but still melodic on top.\n\n(music: DÃ¢M-Funk â âBrookside Parkâ)\n\nDÃ¢M-Funk\n\nTracks like this, I mean, you gotta keep it gangster and that is what it is. I try to make music that the hardest dude can get into and then the most beautiful lady can get into at the same time, that combination. So that is âBrookside Park,â and all that was recorded live using the Roland Juno 1.\n\nJeff âChairmanâ Mao\n\nBreak it down a little bit, what are the different elements involved in putting something like that together?\n\nDÃ¢M-Funk\n\nThe different elements would be, like I said, recording it live all the way through. I would program the drum machine first. That is the only thing I usually sequence, about 16 bars. And after this session we will destroy the recording, so that none of this can be heard elsewhere. Just kidding. Drum machine first, then the bassline and the chords, we will play both of those together in one take. I would play it like this. I have my rig like this, and play the bass and the keys at the same time. After I record that on the standalone CD recorder, Iâll finalize that CD tape and take the CD out, put the other CD into the other CD player and press play. Then put a blank CD player in the other recorder, push record on there, then run that track back, press play and record stuff over and over. Itâs not a rocket-science thing, but itâs something that I like to do. And I have Pro Tools sitting on my shelf right now, collecting dust. This is just the way I like to record. One day I will put Pro Tools together, maybe the next album, or maybe the next album I might just go hi-tech, I donât know. At this point I canât go high- tech, but right now I like the way that I record. If it ainât broke, donât fix it.\n\nJeff âChairmanâ Mao\n\nWhat about the vocals on there?\n\nDÃ¢M-Funk\n\nThe vocals were vocoder, and I did that on a fantastic keyboard that we all know of called the microKorg. I think thatâs a must-own for any musician. It is a fantastic little keyboard, a coffee table piece, definitely a classic. I want to give much love to James Pants, give it up to James Pants [applause]. Actually, that was right on cue, because I bought the microKorg from James Pants that I used on the âBrookside Parkâ track, so we are all in this together.\n\nJeff âChairmanâ Mao\n\nYou actually probably didnât have to give him any money, you just give him a bowl of curry and he wouldâve been happy.\n\nDÃ¢M-Funk\n\nExactly. I shoulda did that, man.\n\nJeff âChairmanâ Mao\n\nYou mentioned warmth and warmth of sound. Do you get a different type of warmth from the different voices that you use? And how would you describe one versus another?\n\nDÃ¢M-Funk\n\nI get a certain warmth from more of the analog stuff. The Korg, Iâve got to be honest with you, it is cool but it definitely needs some brush up on the warmth. Korg did make some earlier stuff that is really warm â it is still a great companyâ¦ Korg, if youâre listening. But I like older keyboards that give the warmth. You never want to use the regular patches, please! You all know this. It would be cool to tweak the sound. Donât just use the regular patch; donât be lazy. I hope Iâm not offending anybody but you should always get your own sound. It is called a synthesizer, because that is what they do, you synthesize sound. I would never use the preset. But that is how I come up with my stuff.\n\nJeff âChairmanâ Mao\n\nLast week we had Gabriel Roth from this record label Daptone, who do stuff with Sharon Jones and people like that. In some ways, you guys are kindred spirits because he does things completely analog, himself. But he was talking about discipline and discipline within your playing, and discipline within your execution of being one part of a band. Now, you are your own band, more or less, but at the same time, I notice from your songs and how they are put together, they are very disciplined. The partsâ¦ I think when people think of funk they think of a lot of bass slapping, thumbs slapping on the bass, just sort of over-embellishing the groove. I wonder if you could speak on that a little bit, how you feel about that, because that is in some respects one characteristic of funk. But I feel your stuff is also very disciplined.\n\nDÃ¢M-Funk\n\nThank you for noticing that. I do practice discipline. I was just talking to somebody about this, and itâs probably again maybe my Generation X thing, I donât know. But the newer generation now, it seems to me that this ADD thing is going on and, I guess, itâs a prideful thing. It is like, thatâs cool, but the Beatles were known to take seven days for one song, maybe even longer. Now cats are doing a track in like 30 minutes and that seems to be the new bragging rights, âYeah, I made that beat in like ten minutes.â âOK, cool, but thatâs dope? What if you spent a little bit more time on it?â Now, Iâm even guilty of it. I did âHood Pass Intactâ in ten minutes, if you guys ever heard that track. But that it is because it felt right and I just said, âLet me walk away from this, I know when it is cool, donât go nuts.â But sometimes itâs fun to see if you can discipline yourself to really work on a song. This track right here, I did about 21 takes of this before I got it right. Let me see if I can cue this one up. This is from the album as well, there we go. Recorded live in Funkmosphere Lab in Los Angelesâ¦\n\n(music: DÃ¢M-Funk â unknown)\n\nI am not going to torture you with the whole song but I just wanted to show you that sometimesâ¦ that one I wanted to make a song that could be played on the radio and not just a beat. I am not going to be one of those guys right now to condemn a certain way of music, but there is a little difference. I have a song called âI Donât Just Do Beatsâ and I am not dissing beats. It is a âjustâ in the title, I âjustâ donât do beats. I make beats, too, but it would be nice to acknowledge cats that still do music and beats. Itâs like, âItâs that beat, thatâs that beat, thatâs hardâ¦â What about the person that does the music, too? Thatâs OK, for people to actually construct actual songs. You know what Iâm saying, Iâm not being funny or anything. But what happened appreciating people who do music and not just a beat? That right there, I wanted to include on this as well, to show that from your question, it was a long answer, but the disciplineâ¦ yeah, you definitely want to have some discipline when it comes to making an album these days and music. Itâll be nice to hear sometimesâ¦\n\nJeff âChairmanâ Mao\n\nOn a more philosophical levelâ¦ funk is always so intrinsically linked with sci-fi imagery and fantasy and things like that. Why do you think that it is? And what about that sort of stuff appeals to you? If there is a deeper meaning to it, what do you think all of that imagery represents?\n\nDÃ¢M-Funk\n\nFunk goes a long way back and it is not a fad, it is a way of life. If you study some of the Funkadelic and Parliament imagery, and even Sun Ra, Miles Davisâ¦ a lot of people came before P-Funk, but had the funk ideology. Funk to me represents the back room, if you will, of R&B and soul. The dark room in the back of the house, the cousin or bastard child of those genres. Just like metal and punk are the bastard children of rock or country, you know what I mean? Funk allows you to think about other things. It opens up another door. It is just a long lineage of that. I like to incorporate different ways of thinking through funk music. Itâs just a tradition. I have had experiences that I attribute to funk and the way it is, and it is not a game. Itâs a way of life. I mean, itâs deep to explain but I want funk to be respected. And I think it is finally again. Commercialism made funk funny. Even the word got kind of weird to say. Iâm trying to bring style back to funk. I donât want to be known for rainbow Afros or diapers on stage. There is more to it. Itâs an ideology, it is about the chords, it is about the tempos, it is about the flow. It is about what I said earlier, about the hardest gangster and the most beautiful lady that can have a glass of wine with it at the same time. I want to create that connection. Class and the streets together in the same room â thatâs what I am trying to do with this modern funk. I want to bring everybody in the same room together, but still donât forget about traveling to another galaxy and giving that music to another species, letting them hear the music that we are creating. Funk I think is the genre, or one of the genres, that I think another species or lifeform could really get into, because it is rooted in the motherland. It is rooted in drums. It is rooted in the first people that were ever on this planet, and it is now being given to everybody in this room and all different people to take to another universe. That is what I think about the funk that I am creating, and I want to contribute into that.\n\nJeff âChairmanâ Mao\n\nI am glad you address that, because I think there is some sort of kitsch or novelty stigma attached to the music to some degree. I am a huge, huge P-Funk fan and I love the outrageousness of what they were doing. It was groundbreaking to have a guy with a diaper on stage playing guitar. But maybe it is just the era that we live in, but everything has to be too ironic or self- conscious, and I am kind of glad that you were able to address that. What role would you say escapism has in your creativity and in the process of how you do things?\n\nDÃ¢M-Funk\n\nIt has a lot to do with it. The reason Iâm into it is for escapism. I want to provide the listener a place to get away to another place. Like I told you about that kid sitting in the room with the windows open after ditching school, listening to the records â I want to provide the music, the soundtrack to their lives, and it is an escapism. People have things to go through each day in school or at work or whatever, I want to provide a double album like this so they can get in and be, âLet me put this thing on and just close my eyes and get into this.â That is what I want to provide. Something that they can remember and hold on to and can provide the soundtrack to their lives and I hope everybody in this room that creates music and artâ¦ I hope thatâs some of the reason that you do it, not just for self-pleasing things, but to help other people as well. Please yourself, as I please myself with my music, Iâm not going to lie, because it feels good when you complete a song it gets all that stuff out. Art is about expressing yourself, but still I hope youâre thinking that when you do create art you are hoping that it is helping another person and it is not all self-serving.\n\nJeff âChairmanâ Mao\n\nWhen you do your DJ sets and you do your live sets, I guess they overlap in some ways. In light of the diaper on stage image, you also emphasize showmanship. Can you talk a little bit about that and how you incorporate showmanship into even just a DJ set?\n\nDÃ¢M-Funk\n\nI incorporate showmanship in a way that I never want to bore people when they come to one of my shows or sets. I just donât want to be the guy that is staring at his laptop with a blank expression on his face. I hope I didnât hurt anybodyâs feelings in here. You donât have to be jumping for joy, but Iâll be frank, that shit better be good if youâre going to stand there and just look at a laptop with a blank expression. It better be good. For me, maybe it is a little bit easier in my particular style, because it has got a bump to it, most of it, or at least I try to have a bump to it. I just like to make people feel good and be into it. I let myself go. Iâm more of a laid-back person when Iâm kicking it, but on stage I just turn to somebody else. I hope that every artist here can remember that when you get on stage, people drove, they took the train, they went out in the cold, they bought a ticket. They actually thought of you. They considered coming to see your ass, and then you get up there and you just acting like youâre mad? Iâm mad sometimes, too. I have songs that address that. But I just feel that when it comes to showmanship, I like to give people a good show. In this era right now, I feel good. I used to feel weird. Iâll be honest with you, I was doing my thing. I like to party on stage, and I was like, âMan, nobody else is really partying.â The people that I do gigs with, all the other artists were doing some other thing. But where I come from, we party. You get into it. You give showmanship. I understand there is an ironic thing out there and people kind of donât want to show that they are excitedâ¦\n\nJeff âChairmanâ Mao\n\nPeople are always too cool for schoolâ¦ So, what sort of things would you be doing on stage if you were doing a DJ set or something like that? How would you try to reach the people?\n\nDÃ¢M-Funk\n\nI just take it to the natural vibe. I feed off of the crowd. For instance, in Lisbon â Iâll just keep it recent. In Lisbon it was such an incredible crowd. Everybody was just partying, everybody was into it and I was into it too. Then you will go to another gig and it will be kind of OK, some people are watching curiouslyâ¦ But that is something I want you guys to prepare for. Every gig is not going to be dynamite â donât let that get to you. There will be people staring at you. There are also going to be some people in the audience that think they can do it better than you. That is always going to be out there. It is no big deal â all you have to do is just rock it for that one person you know thatâs there, what saves me is when I can see one person enjoying it. Then I look around and see the one guy is standing there with that blank expression, itâs like, âCool, thatâs alright.â But Iâm just going to keep providing, because I chose to do this. All of us in this room, we chose to do this. We chose to be on the stage. This is some serious shit when you think about it, because we could be doing something else. Some people are actually looking at us, like, âHow dare you to choose to get on stage, to live a lifestyle like that?â But itâs art. We chose art. This is the way we want to live our lives. I would just say, deal with all the little things that come with that territory and stay strong.\n\nJeff âChairmanâ Mao\n\nEverybody here actually shared their DJ horror stories from their past. Do you have one that you want to share with us? Itâs like the great equalizer; everybody seems to have one.\n\nDÃ¢M-Funk\n\nA great equalizer, I feel you. Iâm going to be honest, can I share it like this? I was talking to my lady, right? And I was like, I am going to be honest with you, I was talking to her just last night, like, âMan, everything is going so cool, I am just waiting for something to happen. If Iâm going to have to knock somebody out on stage or get crazy, when is that going to happen?â She was like, âMan, donât even worry about that. You have always been waiting for something to happen, waiting for someone to say... you know, just enjoy what is going on. You donât have the type of energy that invites anything bad to happen.â And I had to realize that and say, âOK, look, maybe it is OK to not have anything bad happen.â Seriously, I have not had anything weird happen yet. I want to be the great equalizer, but I just havenât had any serious problems yet. And Iâm trying to look for some wood somewhereâ¦ I think that is metal [knocks on table]. So Iâll just thank God, or the universe above for anybody that is too particular in here. It is always up for debate, but thatâs another story. I just havenât had any horror stories yet. I just want to thank my lucky stars, if you will. But I guess the only thing I can say is, like I said earlier, you will have gigs that arenât as cool as the other one. You wonder, âWhoah, what was that about?â Oh OK, I got an equalizer. It was one of my own gigs, in my own home town of Funkmosphere. It really wasnât a big deal, but this shows again and it might help you guys too, it was one of my worst DJ sets. I was trainwrecking. There was one time before the show, somebody passed me something and I was like, âMan, come on, why did I do that?â I was thinking it was going to enhance me, but I was like, âWhy did I do that? I donât even trip like that no more.â I was like, âOh, man, this is one of my worst DJ sets ever at Funkmosphere in LA. I will never, ever do that again before DJing.â Those kinds of gigs happen, and you have just got to move onto the next one and keep your head up. What I did was I kept it true, I got on the microphone, âMuch love, yâall. This is one of my worst DJ sets,â everybody was still clapping and laughed. But Iâm not going to try and play it off and act like it didnât happen. So thatâs how I did it and itâs all good.\n\nJeff âChairmanâ Mao\n\nSo you just mentioned Funkmosphere, can you explain what that is and how long you have been doing it?\n\nDÃ¢M-Funk\n\nFunkmosphere is the spot I founded in Los Angeles, California, in the Culver City area. Itâs been going on for almost four years in Jul. Thatâs when my DJ friends Billy Goods, DJ Randy Watson AKA Ron, DJ Laroj â we have been hosting people like Ron Trent, Chico Mann, Peanut Butter Wolf, of course. A lot of good cats have passed through there. We focus on the genre of boogie and funk. We play stuff like this. I will let you hear something.\n\nJeff âChairmanâ Mao\n\nYou are a connoisseur of that stuff as well.\n\nDÃ¢M-Funk\n\nOh thank you, I try to be. Letâs see. This is one that I really like. I dropped this at Plan B this weekend. This is a rare 45; this is the kind of stuff we play there. This was released in 1981 out of Los Angeles and itâs a group called LS Movement. Itâs called âMove Everything You Got.â Letâs see if we can get it right, maybe it is a needle thing, Iâll put this mic down for a second.\n\n(music: LS Movement â âMove Everything You Gotâ)\n\nDÃ¢M-Funk\n\nBenny Blanco can attest to this, they are the London side of the boogie movement which we are doing. Benny is right there, much love to Benny. Can you guys give Benny a round of applause? [applause]\n\nJeff âChairmanâ Mao\n\nYeah, give Benny a round of applause. He has been working hard for you guys these past ten days.\n\nDÃ¢M-Funk\n\nSo, we are international. Weâre trying to keep boogie alive and take funk into different territories and we appreciate you guys giving us the chance to share this music.\n\nJeff âChairmanâ Mao\n\nI guess I skipped over the part where you actually got signed to Stones Throw. Can you mention how Wolf came across your stuff and how that happened?\n\nDÃ¢M-Funk\n\nWe started seeing each other. For instance, I would go look at his DJ sets around LA. He was DJing at a place called Star Shoes one night and he did an all 1983 set. And see, a lot of people know Wolf from the backpack hip-hop stuff, but he is into all styles of music. As I said earlier, it is great to be into all types of music, but you can still stand for something. But the point is that being so well-rounded in music, he had collected funk as well. Slave, the group that I was talking to you about, One Way, Prince â very into Prince, which I didnât know. So, when I walked into this club, he was playing this stuff and I was like, âDamn, this dude really has it. Who is the DJ?â And then, âDamn, itâs Wolf!â So, we linked up and we started talking about Steve Arrington, of course. I want to play one of those tracks before this is all over, give you guys a premiere of what is coming out on Stones Throw with Steve Arrington. But he started to come to Funkmosphere and I started inviting him to spin at my spot and he did and he did a 777 thing, and we just built up. I left a comment during the great days of MySpace, you remember that? Much love to MySpace, I owe them a lot. I am not laughing. A great, great site. So I left a comment on Baron Zenâs page, the cat who was on Stones Throw, who did this great little weird oddity album. It came time for remixes to be done and I left a message on Baron Zenâs MySpace page innocently, I was like, âI like the track.â Then suddenly Wolf hits me, âI saw you left a comment on Baron Zenâs page, I didnât know you like that stuff.â So, I was like, âYeah, I like all music.â He said, âMan, we are doing a remix project, and I heard some of the stuff on your MySpace page, and I liked it.â âOK. Thanks, man.â He said, âHey, I want to see if you want to do a remix for one of the tracks.â I tell you, after this, I will tell you a human thingâ¦ after the phone call, I swear to God, I hung up the phone and I got on my knees. I went over to the other part of the room and I said, âThank you, God! Thank you, God! I am finally putting something out on my own, no rap sessions, none of this stuff. Thank you, God!â I got up off my knees and it was like Wolf just believed in the sound from the MySpace page. So then I did âBurn Rubberâ. Here is one more thing, this is very important for everybody in here... He gave me the go ahead to do this thing, because first, another incredible cat, Madlib, was doing a remix of a track, too, and I turned to him and said I would do âShoes,â this Baron Zen track. They said, âAh, Madlibâs doing that.â So I said, âOK, damn! What am I going to do?â At the end of the CD there was âBurn Rubber,â where Baron Zen is just screaming on it for about a minute. He took the original âBurn Rubberâ by The Gap Band, Iâll play it in the background while Iâm talking.\n\nHe basically told me, âWhy donât you go ahead?â I said, âI like âBurn Rubber,â I could do something with that.â He was like, âOK, go ahead. Itâs just a little instrumental, a short track.â So basically this is the track we are referring to. I walked around and said, âWhere am I going to record this, what am I going to do to this?â But I ended up recording this track and I had to lay Baron Zenâs voice. Wolf sent me the a cappella â as you guys already know, they send you the parts â and I laid his voice on top like this. The original was just his voice without vocoder but Iâll tell you a story in a minute. I turned in the first version with his vocal without a vocoder and check this out. This is a lesson for everybody, I turned it in and he said, âMan, thatâs dope what you did with the music but the vocal is just off key. I donât like the way Baron Zenâs vocal sound on there.â All the work I did, I was like, âDamn! He is telling me no.â Then the fear is after me getting on my knees and praying, this might fall through my fingertips.\n\nBeing the good guy that Wolf is, he was like, âWhy donât you try running his voice through a machine or some kind of effects?â And we both came up with the vocoder. So I think Wolf actually came up with the vocoder idea and I said, âCool, letâs do it.â I went back to the studio again, the remix still not approved. The reason I am telling you this is because if you ever get discouraged, donât just throw your hands up and be like, âForget this, dude. I did all this workâ¦ forget it.â I ended up doing it. I ended up running it through the vocoder and I turned it in to Wolf and he said, âOh man, this is the one.â\n\n(music: Baron Zen â âBurn Rubber (DÃ¢M-Funk 12â Remix)â)\n\nDÃ¢M-Funk\n\nSo not to torture you with that, now I do that live in my sets with my synthesizer keyboard I strap on my shoulders. I donât like to call it a keytar anymore. I just call it a synth axe. See what Iâm trying to do? Iâm trying to change the cornball effect of funk that it used to have, rainbow Afros, everybody laughing at the keytar. This is serious business. All that synthesizer is something for the keyboards to be able to be free on stage. Jan Hammer and all those kind of cats, it got kind of weird in the â80s. Much love to Jan Hammer, he is incredible, but during that time, that instrument got stigmatized and Iâm trying to bring it to our table.\n\nJeff âChairmanâ Mao\n\nSo, through the remix for them you got your first official solo releases?\n\nDÃ¢M-Funk\n\nAfter that, cats like J Rocc and DJs across the world started playing that track and I really appreciated it. Benji B, a great cat from your town, supported a lot of things, and it was all natural. None of this was any kind of favors or anything like that. Everything I did was natural. I would suggest to everybody here, stick with the natural vibe. And be careful when you do the demo submitting. There is one little thing that I need to share with you guys. When you do the demos thing, just do it in a way, I canât even explain it, it has to be more natural. Iâll never forget what Leon told me, he told me the industry is built on relationships. Sometimes itâs not going to work, no matter how big your dream is, just, âHere is a CD.â Somebody might listen to it, but sometimes there is so much going on in somebodyâs head, it might not be the right way to approach it. You might have to give it to a third party or just set up something, or at least have a genuine conversation first, instead of just your âYo, yo, yo, yoâ¦â Sometimes it works but I donât know, man, there is too many ways of doing things now to get your music heard, and that way sometimes is not the way. Fortunately, you are looking at somebody who actually does listen to demos, but Iâm just letting you know about other cats â that aggressiveness doesnât really work with people. It just works naturally, like I said with that MySpace thing, that was just all natural. I wasnât trying to get on no labelâ¦\n\nJeff âChairmanâ Mao\n\nRight place, right time. I do want to hear the Steve Arrington thing before we open the place up to questions from everybody. So, what stage is the album at now, and when can we expect this to drop?\n\nDÃ¢M-Funk\n\nI would hope that it would be out by summertime. We have recorded ten tracks together. Weâre going to do a very serious project with this, and I have a promise from Wolf that this will be a very well thought-out project, because Steve Arrington is owed that respect. I feel he is one of the best, most overlooked vocalists in funk. He is one of the best and heâs still incredible. He just deserves the respect and he is one of my heroes, and I think itâll be out by the summertime, hopefully. Here is something, this is called âThe Way I Feel About You.â A little modern funk for you."
