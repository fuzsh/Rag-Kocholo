        "text": "Brazil is famous for its expressive and diversified culture, and we can't deny that. After all, it's a sizeable country that combines different ethnic groups, each with its own unique culture and social values.\n\nRio de Janeiro, a city well-known for its beautiful beaches, the paradise view, and Christ the Redeemer, is where Funk Carioca emerged in the 1980s. Inspired by Miami bass, Funk Carioca, also known as Brazilian Funk, has developed into its unique style and set itself as one of the most famous music genres among the working class.\n\nLet's dive deep to learn more about Funk Carioca, its history, how did it spread, and much more!\n\nWhat is Funk Carioca?\n\nFunk Carioca is a hip-hop sub-genre from Brazil. It's also known as Favela Funk, or some refer to it as \"Baile Funk.\" Although the genre is genuinely Brazilian, it has much influence from the United States. And Funk music features different characteristics from what we know in Brazil.\n\nThe sub-genre draws its attention to various international music genres, ranging from gangsta rap, Miami bass, Afrobeat, and samba to electronic music subgenres like electro and freestyle.\n\nMoreover, the music served as a release for the underprivileged residents in Rio de Janerio. Local DJs could play the rhythms of 127 and 132 bpm Miami Bass at the parties, with sounds blasting off the systems, making everyone dance.\n\nHow Do You Know its Funk Carioca?\n\nSeveral distinct characteristics make it stand out. Firstly, its lyrics represent violence and a sexual theme, but one of its sub-genres also talks about romance and nuanced subject matters. Further, Funk Carioca widely distinguishes itself by focusing on many social and political themes in its lyrics.\n\nOne of its songs, 'Rap de Felicidade,' highlights the violence related to the drug trade. Another 'Rap de Rocinha' drew the attention of policy and lawmakers against the rising wave of fighting at Funk Ballies.\n\nTamborzao beat is another classic feature differentiating Funk Carioca from other music genres, and it's been the most prominent driving force behind Funk Carioca in recent years. The beat has got some real power!\n\nHow Did it All Begin?\n\nIt started when Brazilian record suppliers flew to the United States to get 'Black Music' for Brazilian DJs. They went to stores that sold American Funk records. Though American music developed into a new genre like hip hop, Funk remained local.\n\nMiami was the famous place where they bought records for Brazilian DJs, and hence Miami Bass was very dominant in the music. So it continued until the late 1980s when other local music producers joined and imported these records.\n\nAfter getting such an overwhelming response, a passionate musician, Fernando Luis Mattos de Matta, under the artistic name DJ Marlboro reinvented the genre that evoked a considerable response.\n\nThe Sound of Funk Carioca\n\nStarting from the deep, aggressive beats, it has evolved over the years. You can trace it back to various musical genres, including Brazilian samba to European techno.\n\nInitially, Funk Carioca started from drum machine loops and a small palette of samples—like DJ Battery Brain's \"8 Volt Mix\" and Hassan's \"Pump Up the Party.\"\n\nIn the 1990s, the sound of Funk Carioca shifted towards tamborzao beats that remained popular for 20 years. Over the years, it has used mixed vinyl tracks that imitate the scratch, loop, and break technologies made famous by Bronx artists; the movement has gone exclusively digital.\n\nIn recent years, Funk Carioca has gotten shaped by affordable technologies having simple beats with vocalists shouting as much as they sing. Thanks to a trio known as Bonde Do Role, having support from producer Diplo, and worldwide coverage within music media such as Rolling Stone.\n\nThe Boom CHA-CHA, de boom CHA-CHA echoes throughout Brazil and is all the rage. However, it has faced backlash for being unapologetic, controversial in nature, and written as cheap or lewd; it continues to speak for the harsh reality of the oppressed communities of Brazil.\n\nWho Set the Funk Carioca?\n\nInitially, DJ Nazz and Tony Minister were leading suppliers who brought the Miami Bass records to Brazil. That gave way for other local producers to import the records as well. Then Fernando Luiz, also known as DJ Marlboro, revolutionized the genre by writing his songs and incorporating them into the rhythms of the electronic drum machines.\n\nLater in the decade, Marlboro made the first album known as Funk Basil in 1989. This record is how Carioca was born and made its way to the whole world and what people remember first about it.\n\nMoreover, 30 years forward, it has been reinvented. An artist, DJ Polyvox, got inspiration from the sound of a soda bottle made 150bpm Funk, or the Crazy Rhythm as they call it.\n\nHow Did Funk Carioca Spread?\n\nIt began in the late 1970s when DJs played funk songs, R&B, and Soul, replaced by Miami bass and freestyle. It gained immense popularity after the Funk Basil album got released. All thanks to its pioneer, DJ Marlboro, who reinvented the genre.\n\nThe period of 1990's played an essential part in its rising spread because of the release of successful albums by Funk artists. In addition, MC Batata's single 'Feira de acari' and other series like Rap Brasil became popular.\n\nLater in the '90s and the beginning of the year 2000, middle-class young people consumed Funk Carioca at parties a lot. This point was when Bonde (a small group of Funkerios), including some top Funkerios Mc Buiú, MC Naldinho BP, MC Leozinho, and Mc Biruleib, worked with DJ Marlboro. One of the most important viral songs was 'Rap Do Silva,' released in 1995 and based on fights at Bailes back then.\n\nWith the advent of technology, Funk music has gone widespread across the globe. Especially in Europe, where Brazilian artists like Deize Tigrona collaborated with Sao Paulo ex-pats Tetine. In 2001, the album Favela Chick from BMG brought international popularity.\n\nFunk Carioca Hits\n\nFunk Carioca hits its mark due to the famous artists that have done remarkably well in this field. To name a few, Anitta has made a mark in the industry, working with some reputable performers like Major Lazer J Bavlin.\n\nAnother famous artist is Ludmilla, whose work has been exceptionally well. She made a song, Ludmilla Oliveira da Silva, which earned more than one million streams on Spotify. Her first album, Hoje, also received Platinum status.\n\nBrazilian rapper, Tati Quebra Barraco, contributed to making the Funk Carioca popular by addressing the negative stereotypes about women and favela residents in her music.\n\nIn addition to these, Sandy Leah albums' Quatro Estações (1999), Quatro Estações: O Show (2000) and Sandy & Junior (2001), and Deise Tigrona's famous song 'injecao' also made the Funk Carioca an international hit. So, you see, most of the songs in this genre hit the popularity landmark!\n\nHow Did Funk Carioca Bridge the Genre Gap?\n\nFunk Carioca, also known as the hip-hop sub-genre, traces many musical genres ranging from Brazilian samba to European techno. It strongly influences American hip hop of a DJ and MC (either rapping or singing).\n\nBut it is interesting to learn that it became highly famous in the '80s when laborers came to the city to pursue a better life. Initially rooted in the Electro and Miami Bass, it bridged the gap by evolving into its own prominent identity over the years.\n\nMoreover, it spread globally in the 2000s due to its powerful Afro-Brazilian beat and lyrics—further, many non-Brazilian artists like M.I.A take on Funk Carioca as a new generation of homegrown Funkeiros or Funk Carioca artists developed an assemblage of spin-offs and hybrid subgenres.\n\nIs Funk Carioca a Lost Genre?\n\nSome people still think of it as a lost genre, but is it?\n\nSince the beginning, Funk Carioca has faced marginalized behavior because it represents the emotions and vocals of the marginalized and disenfranchised. On the other hand, other Brazilian genres such as Bossa Nova, Samba, and Forr were popular and liked. These genres worked and came under the Culture department, while The Security department operated Funk. That caused a drawback to the genre, ultimately losing a few Funkerios by the violence of the police.\n\nDespite the efforts to promote the Funk Carioca, including Júnior e Leonardo's 1994 song \"Rap das Armas\" criticizing urban violence. And MC Cidinho's cover version was updated by MC Doca, signifies the protest of police drug sweeps. But that evoked the ire of the local government, banning it from the radio.\n\nIn 2017 a bill got passed to criminalize Funk but later got rejected. Various other incidents include the police killings of many people at Favela of Paraisópolis and São Paulo while enjoying a Funk party.\n\nAlthough being criticized and banned, Funk Carioca has been a way of expression, representation, and survival for the marginalized. It has become viral and taken off due to the internet.\n\nSo, Funk Carioca is a culture, not a crime, and not a lost genre!"
