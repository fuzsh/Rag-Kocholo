        "text": "Two posts ago your RnR Dentist tackled the bagpipes in a rock music context. Family flautists Brenna and Cheryl demanded equal time for their chosen instrument so this month we will look at the woodwind without a reed – the flute. Crude flutes made from bone and tusks have been dated back as far as 35-42,000 years (at least a hollow tube with holes in it meant to be blown into). There are myriad variations – the piccolo, fife, tin whistle, recorder, etc. The kind of instrument we will look at exclusively has a hole meant to be blown over, not into and is categorized as a Western Concert Flute. This list will be of known musicians which leaves out unknown session players otherwise a song like “Comin’ In The Back Door” by The Baja Marimba Band would be included (one of the Wrecking Crew played on it, but who?). The songs are not all rock, but generally that is the category of the music included. This expands a topic yours truly tackled years ago in a published article when it was posited by a reader in a magazine that there were very few rock flute players (indeed most music fans can only think of one). Up for the challenge, there proved to be enough to make it difficult to limit the list to just 25 (sorry Herbie Mann). Zaftig flute-playing rapper Lizzo didn’t quite make the cut, but let’s at least give her props for trying something new (one assumes James Galway never shook his rump while tootling). My Uncle rightly pointed out another fine work that isn’t pop, but is kinda fun to listen to – “Suite For Flute & Jazz Piano Trio” by Rampal and Bolling. Again, only one song by one artist is the rule here plus no recorders which nixes “Ruby Tuesday” and “The Fool On The Hill” and no piccolos which melts “Ding Dong! The Witch Is Dead”. I decided to leave out the fine work by Ted Cole with Colorado band Runaway Express since at this time you can’t find any of it on youtube. The order is not terribly important after the first few songs.\n\nAn addendum from 2022, I recently watched a few interesting videos from the female South African classical instrumental outfit Sterling EQ which is lead by flutist Carina Bruwer. You might want to check out songs like Sarabande or Genesis (which has sort of a Kashmire feel). Good stuff.\n\n1.Jethro Tull – Living In The Past\n\nWhen one thinks of rock music and flute, the name Ian Anderson and his band Jethro Tull immediately come to mind. Anderson is the Eric Clapton of rock flute music. Would someone please explain why the r & r hall of fame has not inducted this game-changing band but considers non-rockers like The Notorius B.I.G. and Whitney Houston for induction? “Living In The Past” was released in 1969 as a stand-alone single that reached #3 in the U.K., but had to wait till 1972 for U.S. success at #11 on the charts after lending its name to a double album of odds and ends.\n\n2.Focus – House Of The King\n\nThijs Van Leer and his group Focus are mainly remembered in the U.S. for their crazy raver “Hocus Pocus” which is a pity as they continue to be a great mostly instrumental progressive band. Their first Dutch single (1971) was this quasi-Tull sounding flute instrumental written by then guitarist Jan Akkerman and was a #10 hit in Holland. It was finally released in the U.S. on the Focus 3 double album in late 1972 (on CD it has been tacked on to their first LP In And Out Of Focus). Van Leer has also released some excellent solo albums including his 1972 classical flute album Introspection.\n\n3.The Moody Blues – Legend Of A Mind\n\nLikely the second most known rock flute player was the late Ray Thomas. Certainly his best remembered song was this tribute to Timothy Leary and his LSD trips. Appearing on the 1968 LP In Search Of The Lost Chord, this was always a popular showcase in concert for Thomas and his flute which comes in about 2:45 into the song. Thomas’ songs and instrumentation were important contributions during the ’60s and ’70s. Unfortunately during their synth-pop hit era of the ’80s, Thomas was mostly relegated to backing vocals and tamborine shaking waiting in concert for his chance to perform this song.\n\n4.Traffic – Hole In My Shoe\n\nThe late Chris Wood might have a case in challenging Ray Thomas for the title of second most remembered rock flautist. Also contributing to other artists’ recordings such as “1983… (A Merman I Should Turn to Be)” by The Jimi Hendrix Experience, Traffic wind-man Wood was a versatile musician. Wood’s flute playing on the traditional “John Barleycorn” might be his best work, but this early Dave Mason sung single from 1967 remains a psychedelic fave of your R&R Dentist. Wood struggled with drugs and alcohol addiction finally passing away at age 39 in 1983.\n\n5.The Guess Who – Undun\n\nWhile guitarist Randy Bachman wrote this hit, singer Burton Cummings’ vocal and flute playing are what make the record great. This jazzy song hit #22 in 1969 in the U.S. (note that the single was from the album Canned Wheat and edited off a solo guitar coda). Supposedly the lyrics are about a girl dropping acid at a party and going in to a coma. It is unfortunate that Cummings didn’t play flute more on the band’s records. Quentin Tarantino used the song in the 1997 movie Jackie Brown.\n\n6.Genesis – Dusk\n\nOne of the loveliest songs by Genesis was “Dusk” from their second album Trespass (1970) which may not be familiar to fans of the later pop juggernaut group. John Mayhew was the drummer at this time pre-Phil Collins and Anthony Phillips played guitar pre-Steve Hackett. Tony Banks (keys) and Michael Rutherford (bass/guitar) were led by singer Peter Gabriel who also played flute on this gentle song (coming in just after the 2 minute mark).\n\n7.Firefall – You Are The Woman\n\nThe name David Muse may not be a household name to fans of soft ’70s pop, but his multi-instrumental talents in Colorado band Firefall made their songs interesting. Muse was a late addition to the band and his flute work was prominent on their first big hit “You Are The Woman” (#9 in 1976 written by singer Rick Roberts). Muse has been in and out of the band over the years while battling cancer along the way (he is currently a member of Firefall).\n\n8.Camel – Air Born\n\nProgressive rock bands more often than not have a woodwind player who at least doubles on sax and flute. The U.K. band Camel was formed in 1971 and while never a huge success, they continue with only one original member – Andy Latimer who also sang and played flute plus guitars on this song. This song was from their 1976 Moonmadness record (their fourth and last with the original lineup of the band which included Peter Bardens on keys).\n\n9.The Beatles – You’ve Got To Hide Your Love Away\n\nWhile John Scott has had a long career as a composer of film and television scores along with classical music, rock fans know his work best from the end of “You’ve Got To Hide Your Love Away”. The song is John Lennon as Dylan with flute replacing harmonica. In the movie, the flute playing is mimed by George Harrison’s in-home gardener who also trims the grass with wind-up teeth. Scott also played on records by The Hollies, Nelson Riddle, Tom Jones, etc.\n\n10.King Crimson – I Talk To The Wind\n\nIan McDonald has a list as long as your arm of records he has played on (including the T Rex hit “Bang A Gong [Get It On]”) plus he was a founder of Foreigner. For fans of progressive rock, he will be forever a founding member of King Crimson playing mellotron, keys and winds on the classic In The Court Of The Crimson King (1969) before leaving. After the nasty album intro song of “21st Century Schizoid Man”, the gentle “I Talk To The Wind” is a jarring contrast. McDonald duets with himself on flute to start to song. McDonald also plays some nice flute on the song “Atmospheres” by the band Fireballet on their debut album Night On Bald Mountain. The one song per group rule nixes some excellent work on flute by Mel Collins on later albums.\n\n11.Canned Heat – Going Up The Country\n\nBluesman Henry Thomas recorded the song “Bulldoze Blues” in 1928 with the main riff of the song played by quills – a panpipes-like instrument. In 1968 Al Wilson of blues band Canned Heat took that song’s tune and wrote a new title and new lyrics. Taken from their LP Living The Blues, the single peaked at #11 in early 1969. The most notable part of the single is the flute riff played by session musician Jim Horn that mimicked Thomas’ quills work. Horn played sax and other winds on some pretty big rock records over the years including Pet Sounds by the Beach Boys, “Africa” by Toto and with the Rolling Stones, Ringo, George Harrison, etc.\n\n12.The Mamas & The Papas – California Dreamin’\n\nAs this blog is being written on a record cold Colorado day while southern California is on fire and the bay area is having blackouts to prevent more flames, it is hard to choose either locale for a nice getaway. John Phillips’ song is such a classic over 50 years later that it is hard to remember the time in late 1965 that this was a barely noticed new single for a brand new singing group. The song built slowly and finally peaked at #4 in March of ’66. The somber flute part was played by Bud Shank who had played sax for Stan Kenton and amassed a huge body of work over seven decades of work. About the same time, Shank scored his only chart hit (#65) with a sax instrumental version of the song “Michelle” by The Beatles.\n\n13.Chicago – Colour My World\n\nTrombone player James Pankow has written some of the more important Chicago hits including this popular wedding/slow dance song. Oddly he didn’t write a part for himself to play with the main instruments being Robert Lamm’s piano and Walter Parazaider’s flute solo which takes up the track’s last minute. The song was originally found as part of an almost thirteen minute suite “Ballet for a Girl in Buchannon” from the 1970 album Chicago (their second LP). It was given a single B-side release in 1970 (A-side “Make Me Smile”) then in 1971 appended again to “Beginnings” which hit #7. The vocal is by the late guitarist Terry Kath.\n\n14.Donovan – There Is A Mountain\n\nJamaican Zen Ska? Donovan Leitch’s lyrics could be a bit obtuse, but the catchy island arrangement with a flute riff played by Harold McNair is simple and direct. This was a #11 single in 1967 in the U.S. (#8 U.K.). McNair who passed at age 39 in 1971 (lung cancer) was from Kingston, Jamaica and was mostly known for his jazz recordings. As a session player he was found on many Donovan records plus Nick Drake’s Bryter Layter, etc.\n\n15.Blodwyn Pig – Variations On Nainos\n\nGuitarist Mick Abrahams left Jethro Tull after their first album This Was and started his own band Blodwyn Pig that put out two fine albums on A&M then disappeared. Member Jack Lancaster mostly played sax (often two at once!), but on their second album Getting To This (1970) on the second track “Variations On Nainos” he made like Ian Anderson and played flute. Mick Abrahams never captured the magic of those two albums again with his self-named band or with the reformed Pig.\n\n16.Manfred Mann – Mighty Quinn (Quinn The Eskimo)\n\nOkay so it isn’t a terribly tricky flute riff, but it is memorable as is the story of the band member who played it – Klaus Voormann. Talk about a fascinating life – friend of the Beatles going back to their pre-fame days in Germany, album cover designer (including Revolver (The Beatles) and Bee Gees’ 1st) and musician having played bass with Manfred Mann and others. The song itself is a Bob Dylan composition that was a #10 hit in the U.S. 1968 for the second main incarnation of Manfred Mann\n\n17.John Mayall – Room To Move\n\nAfter years of electric blues with John Mayall’s Bluesbreakers (and some amazing guitarists in Eric Clapton, Peter Green and Mick Taylor), Mayall made a complete left turn with his 1969 live album The Turning Point. On this album the sound was pretty much acoustic instruments with no drummer. I admit that sitting in my buddy Dan’s basement playing records for each other, this one didn’t grab me back in high school as it wasn’t heavy enough. Now I can appreciate the music, but then I wanted grinding guitar blues rock. On this song (recorded at the Fillmore East in New York), Mayall’s vocals and blues harp are joined by Steve Thompson on bass, Jon Mark on acoustic guitar and Johnny Almond on flute. Almond and Mayall get into some crazy mouth percussion in the middle, but it is the flute riff that makes the song (in tandem with the guitar and at times the harmonica). “Room To Move” was not a U.S. chart hit, but received a lot of airplay on underground FM radio. The late Almond had played sessions on sax previously with Mayall (and others like Chicken Shack) before joining Mayall’s band then after that he and Mark formed a duo (Mark-Almond).\n\n18.Caravan – Love To Love You (And Tonight Pigs Will Fly)\n\nIn The Land Of Grey & Pink from 1971 is a high water mark for the Canterbury, England band Caravan. This cheerfully poppy song is not at all typical of the band’s more progressive style, but is catchy and features some clanging cowbell (not normally a prog instrument). The band still tour off and on with only one original member – Pye Hastings on vocals and guitar. His brother Jimmy Hastings guested on many of Caravan’s records and played flute on this track coming in just before the two minute mark and soloing to the end.\n\n19.Steve Hackett – The Virgin & The Gypsy\n\nPerhaps a bit of a cheat as at least one of the dueling flutes here is a bamboo instrument, but it’s a nice flute part so… While likely losing out on millions, prog rock fans (like this writer) love and respect guitarist Hackett for staying true to the music and leaving Genesis as they were morphing into a pop band. He has kept the music of the early Genesis alive while releasing one astounding prog rock album after another under his own name. His third solo album Spectral Mornings from 1979 is arguably his best. Throughout his career (and on his new album At The Edge Of Light), Steve’s brother John has been at his side to play flute. John Hackett has released his own music plus guested on albums by Nick Magnus, Anthony Phillips, Symbiosis, etc.\n\n20.Heart – Dreamboat Annie (Reprise)\n\nAnn Wilson of Heart has played flute on a number of their songs including “Crazy On You” and “Love Alive”, but on this song she has a bit more of a role (though still not major). While it would have been more illustrative of Ann’s flute prowess to use the song “Sing Child” (where she makes like Ian Anderson on the break), I frankly don’t like the track. This song is from the debut album by Heart Dreamboat Annie (1976 in the U.S.).\n\n21.Dan Fogelberg & Tim Weisberg – Tell Me To My Face\n\nIn 1978 the late AOR singer/songwriter Dan Fogelberg teamed up for an album with jazz flautist Tim Weisberg – Twin Sons Of Different Mothers. The album was a #8 charter in the U.S. with the single taken from the LP “The Power Of Gold” making it to #24. This cover of the old Hollies composition (from 1966) received a fair amount of FM radio play back in the day as well. Trivia buffs may find it interesting that Weisberg’s first recording was playing flute on “French Song” for the 1969 LP The Monkees Present.\n\n22.Jade Warrior – A Prenormal Day In Brighton\n\nYet another discovery back in the day of my pal DC, this is another album that was slow to reveal its charms back in 1971 to a long-haired kid who wanted to rock. On their debut album the band was Jon Field on flutes and percussion with Tony Duhig on guitars and Glyn Havard on bass, vocals. Apparently Duhig and Field met in the ’60s while driving forklifts at a factory in the U.K. and bonded over a love of African music and jazz.\n\n23.Van Morrison – Moondance\n\nIn early 1970 Van Morrison released his third solo album with “Moondance” as the title track. When it belatedly came out as a single in 1977 the track barely registered hitting only #92 during a four week chart run. In truth this jazzy song really spoke more to the singer/songwriter style of the early ’70s and its release in the disco era was guaranteed to fail. As an LP, Moondance is one of the greatest albums to come out in that decade and did chart at #29 selling over three million copies. Collin Tilton’s flute playing along with the walking bass of John Klingberg and the sax solo of John Schroer push the song along instrumentally complimenting Morrison’s vocal.\n\n24.Moe Koffman Quartette – The Swingin’ Shepherd Blues\n\nThe late Canadian jazzman Morris “Moe” Koffman was a prolific jazz flute and sax player. In the U.S. he had a #23 hit in 1958 with this cool groover of an instrumental that pushed the flute to the fore.\n\n25.Eric Burdon & War – Spill The Wine\n\nAfter leaving the British Invasion band The Animals, lead singer Eric Burdon hooked up with the California funk band War and scored a #3 hit in 1970 with this song. It was on the album Eric Burdon Declares War and was the first hit for the long-lived band still going today with only one original member (Leroy “Lonnie” Jordan). The flute part that becomes prominent at around the 1 1/2 minute mark of the song is played by Charles Miller who also contributed sax to the band."
