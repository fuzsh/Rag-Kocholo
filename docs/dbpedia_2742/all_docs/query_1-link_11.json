        "text": "Wondering what funk music is?\n\nWell, if you were born later than maybe 1990, that’s not too surprising.\n\nBecause funk was born in the ’60s, and became a big thing in the ’70s and ’80s.\n\nBut not so much since then.\n\nThat said, the influences of funk are still far reaching across a number of music genres, and will continue to be so.\n\nOkay, let’s see if we can shed a little light by properly answering the question ‘what is funk?’\n\nVery basically, funk is a style of dance music.\n\nWhat Is Funk?\n\nFunk music is a dance music style.\n\nIt grew out of African-American R&B, jazz and soul music in the ’60s.\n\nFunk is defined by its rhythmic and highly danceable bass-lines and drum patterns.\n\nIt was the relationship between the bass-line and the drums that led to funk becoming known for its famous groove.\n\nHere’s a really great example of the funk bass-line groove:\n\nThis funk groove was something pretty new to any other music genre at the time, as most other musical styles tended to be built on the foundations of a strong melody, structured arrangement and chord progression.\n\nTypical Characteristics of Funk?\n\nEvery style and genre of music has a handful of characteristics that come together to lay-down its own unique identity.\n\nHere are the most common characteristics of funk music:\n\n#1. Emphasise on the Bass Guitar\n\nThe prominent role of the bass guitar and the bass-line is the first thing that defines funk.\n\nStrong, uncomplicated, melodic and very danceable, the bass guitar often plays centre-stage in funk music.\n\n#2. Syncopated Rhythms\n\nSyncopated rhythms are what makes funk so east to dance to…even for people who can’t usually dance!\n\nSyncopation is at the heart of funk music.\n\nWith both the drums and the bass guitar playing syncopated rhythms, funk has a greater feeling of anticipation than most other genres of music before it.\n\n#3. Seventh Chord Variant\n\nThe seventh chord variant…the musical linchpin of tension-and-release.\n\nFunk almost always uses seventh chords, and often with further extended versions, like the 11th, 7th+9th, and 13th.\n\n#4. Less Verse/Chorus Structure\n\nFunk doesn’t tend to care about the regular verse/chorus structure that you’ll find common to the songs of many other genres.\n\nInstead, funk songs tend to bubble along to their main groove with each element of the song weighing in with equal prominence.\n\nExamples of Funk\n\nDo you like funk?\n\nDo you love funk?\n\nDo you not like funk at all?..Or do you not even know what you think about funk?\n\nHave a listen to a few of these genuine funk classics to help you decide.\n\nIn no particular order:\n\n#1. ‘Thank You’ by Sly & The Family Stone\n\nSly & the Family Stone blazed a trail for many funk bands to follow.\n\nAnd they probably laid down the very beginnings of dance music as we know it.\n\nSly and The Family Stone released eight studio albums between 1966 and 1976.\n\nThey were dropped by their record label ‘Epic’ in 1977 and while they didn’t officially break-up until the mid-’80s, they became increasingly troubled from that point on.\n\n#2. ‘One Nation Under a Groove’ by Funkadelic\n\nThis single was released back in in 1978 I believe.\n\nI can’t imagine how outrageously original it must have sounded at that time.\n\nIt must have been mind blowing to hear this on the radio for the first time!\n\n#3. ‘Papa’s Got a Brand New Bag’ by James Brown & The Famous Flames\n\nThis was a 1965 release.\n\nDefinitely laying down the foundations of the funk groove.\n\n#4. ‘Superstition’ by Steve Wonder\n\nOkay, nobody leaves this ‘what is funk’ article without declaring their love for Stevie Wonder.\n\nA musical masterpiece? One of the coolest songs ever written and produced?\n\nBoth of those things. No doubt!\n\nThis song is a perfect example of funk’s syncopated rhythms.\n\n#5. ‘Kiss’ by Prince and the Revolution\n\nSomething from 1986.\n\nAnd another great example of syncopation.\n\nThe bass-line on this track is a piece of music production genius.\n\nAnd of course, Prince was indeed a genius.\n\nIf that lot hasn’t improved your mood, I don’t know what will!\n\nA Brief History of Funk\n\nThe History of Funk Music\n\nFunk music first began it’s emergence in the very late 1950’s.\n\nJames Brown had started a band in 1958, named James Brown and the Famous Flames.\n\nThe music that the band played was to be the first origins of the funk sound.\n\nBy the mid-1960’s, James Brown and the Famous Flames had developed a very definite sound and style that firmly established the direction that funk would take, and had all the characteristics that we associate with funk today.\n\nAs you would expect with any exciting new sound, it wasn’t long before other artists started to adopt the style.\n\nAnd so, during the ’60s new funk bands would emerge to really cement this new kind of music as a genre all of it’s own.\n\nSly and the Family Stone, and the Meters were two of the first emergents, pioneering the sound of this new genre into the ’70s.\n\nThe 1970s were to be funk’s heyday. Pretty much all the music stations were playing funk and funk record sales were growing all the time.\n\nWell-known and popular musicians such as Stevie Wonder, Herbie Hancock and Miles Davis were all rolling at tunes with a pure funk groove throughout the whole decade.\n\nFunk certainly did not disappear in the the ’80s, largely because a handful of super-talented artists were progressing the sound to adopt some of the latest music production technology.\n\nThe aforementioned Stevie Wonder, as well as Michael Jackson, Rick James and Prince, would all add further dimensions to the foundation sound of funk, and in so doing keep it fresh for another generation of music lovers.\n\nSub-Genres of Funk\n\nMy gosh, the sub-genres of funk are confusing.\n\nI’m going to try and untangle it a little now…wish me luck!\n\n#1. Electro Funk\n\nLet’s kick this off with electro funk. Not because it was the first sub-genre of funk but because it’s the easiest to explain.\n\nElectro funk span directly out of funk, when funk producers started to adopt new technology, notably the Roland TR-808 and the Korg Vocoder.\n\nThis new production tech led to an expansion of the sound, while still remaining completely true to the primary elements of funk.\n\nThe very late ’70s and early ’80s was when electro funk first emerged.\n\n#2. Psychedelic Funk\n\nProbably the first mutation of the funk sound.\n\nPsychedelic funk is simply the product of the melding together of funk music and psychedelic rock.\n\nPsychedelic funk was already a thing by the late ’60s, so it was very quick to develop from the core sound of funk.\n\nLaunched by artists such as Jimi Hendrix and the Parliament-Funkadelic collective, it remained popular for a long time.\n\n#3. G-Funk\n\nG-funk, or gangsta funk.\n\nIt’s easy to see why people took to calling this sub-genre ‘G-funk’, because gangsta funk is without doubt the most ridiculous name given to any genre of anything ever.\n\nThe combination of rap lyrics on top of funk bass-lines and drums, with an added layer of synths, was seen as a more chilled approach to hip hop.\n\nCool deep grooves with slower bass-lines, melodic elements likened to those of Motown and R&B alll led to G-funk attracting a huge following.\n\n#4. Funk Rock\n\nOkay, well, this one is pretty easy to figure out.\n\nFunk, and rock.\n\nThe deep warm grooves of funk music, with the riffs of rock music…funk rock.\n\nStill not there?\n\nThink Lenny Kravitz, Red Hot Chilli Peppers, INXS, that kind of thing.\n\n#5. Go-Go\n\nOriginating in Washington, DC, in the ’70s, go-go got it’s name because the sound became known for keeping anyone dancing to it ‘going and going’.\n\nHigh-energy live performances delivered by musicians playing a variety of acoustic and electric instruments, but always with focus on a relentless, driving drums.\n\nWho Invented Funk?\n\nJames Brown.\n\nIt’s pretty rare to be able to clearly identify one person as the definite catalyst to an entire music genre.\n\nBut in the case of funk music, James Brown, already dubbed the ‘Godfather of Soul’, was the fire-starter.\n\nOf course, a number of other talented musicians quickly got on board with the new sound and were important in its further development.\n\nBut if you simply want to lay the invention of funk at one persons door…it’s James Brown.\n\nWrapping it Up!\n\nWrap-ups. I don’t really do wrap-ups.\n\nIt’s all been said above.\n\nNow it’s you turn to leave a comment if you have something to add."
