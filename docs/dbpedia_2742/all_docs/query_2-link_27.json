        "text": "Brazil has long been a laboratory for sonic innovation, synthesizing the unique musical traditions of the country’s diverse population. At the cutting edge is baile funk, a sound that stems back decades but evolves in new directions at a lightning-fast rate, reinventing itself as a genre as unexpectedly as the beat switches. You can still hear traces of the electro, Miami bass, and early hip-hop styles it evolved from in the off-kilter rhythms and metallic shards of noise, but baile funk has become its own complex musical ecosystem, with a diverse spectrum of regional variants and specific subgenres.\n\nHip-hop began as dance music, but American rap music frequently has a cagey relationship to its origins in the discotheque and roller rink, often privileging the mental stimulation of clever lyricism over the physical exhilaration of live performance. Baile funk has none of those same qualms, as much rap music as it is rave music: you often have the classic hip-hop combination of a boisterous MC combined with a nimble DJ, but the MC’s primary function is to pump up the jam, often just repeating the same word or phrase over and over until it blends into the beat. The primacy of producer-rapper duos within baile funk makes it a highly collaborative form, born from the uniquely electric relationship between a producer, a rapper, and the crowd they’re conducting.\n\nThe sanded-down mainstream version of baile funk might already be familiar to audiences outside Brazil — thanks to mainstream pop stars like Anitta and the Fast & Furious franchise’s enduring obsession with the city of Rio de Janeiro — but its most adventurous corners have often been a locally-kept secret. Even then, baile funk is a scene that’s intensely online as it is on the ground in the favelas, spread through viral clips on social media and raiding every corner of recorded media for unexpected samples.\n\nWhere so many dance music styles from the Global South have been pilfered for parts by uncreative Yankees, baile funk has somehow managed to largely resist outside commodification — despite Diplo trying his hardest for almost twenty years — in part because of its openly lawless spirit. As a scene largely pioneered by Afro-Brazilian artists, underground baile funk parties have been unfairly criminalized and targeted by police along racial lines, which in some way has encouraged artists to embrace anarchy and extremity as a fundamental part of their work — the ear-shattering volumes and frenetic bootleg samples push back against authority as much as illegal parties.\n\nDue to Brazil’s immense geographic and cultural diversity, every region has its own unique soundtrack. There might be similar rhythms or shared features across different styles of baile funk, but it’s hard to encapsulate it under the umbrella of a single genre. In many ways, baile funk is almost as broad a descriptor as “hip-hop” or “dance music,” an entire network that grew from a shared origin point: some is closer to rap, some is closer to rave; some funk artists mostly work with samples, others stick to original beats. The breadth and depth of sounds that baile funk contains makes it feel endlessly rewarding to explore; even if you’re a native Brazilian well-versed in the history of baile funk, there’s always going to be a sample you haven’t heard flipped or a beat switch you weren’t expecting. These five artists are some of the most vivid stylists working in baile funk today, but they represent only a fraction of what’s out there."
