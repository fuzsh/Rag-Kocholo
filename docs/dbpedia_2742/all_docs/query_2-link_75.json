        "meta_description": "James Brown, the Godfather of Soul, created the DNA for funk. Musicians LA Buckner and Nahre Sol explore how he created funk music, as well as how Brown's music influenced hip hop. They break down the sound of the genre, and create their own funky original song in the process.\r\nActivity:\r\nFrom soul music and R&B, James Brown created a new genre: funk music. Funk, in turn, inspired hip-hop and trap musicâ€”genres that give voice to the life experiences of impoverished and oppressed peoples. By examining videos and text and doing research on the links between music and social justice issues, students will be prepared to collaborate on their own socially conscious rap and create a community activity to work for social change.",
