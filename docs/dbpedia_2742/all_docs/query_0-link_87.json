        "text": "Obisoulstar was born in Chicago but spent his formative years in West Africa, specifically Nigeria. He embodies the qualities of a Renaissance Man. His music is like sustenance for the senses and comfort for the soul. It reflects his experiences, memories, and a fearless storytelling nature. His music draws inspiration from various genres such as Soul, Blues, Funk, Rock, Afrobeat, Lounge, Reggae, House, and Alternative, adding a touch of style. Influenced by the likes of Lenny Kravitz, Meshell Ndegeocello, Jimi Hendrix, Prince, and Fela Kuti (the pioneer of Afrobeat), Obisoulstar's music is a delightful blend of melodies while promoting unity, love, and spiritual liberation. Filled with energy and charisma, he carries his artistry wherever he goes, taking his audience on an immersive journey. His captivating performances allow people to escape and release spiritual energy. This is why he has been called the \"SoulRockinRolla\" and the minister of \"AFROROCK RELIGION\"."
