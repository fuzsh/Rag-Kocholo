        "text": "Images\n\nActivities\n\nMotivational Activity:\n\n1. Display an image of an editorial cartoon published in the Washington Post during the 1970s.\n\nAsk students:\n\nDescribe what you see in this image. What paradox is the cartoonist trying to depict?\n\nWhat does the title of this cartoon reference? How does the title comment on the image?​\n\n2. Display a graph of census data illustrating “Population Changes in Metropolitan Areas, by Race: 1950-60 and 1960-70.”\n\nAsk students:\n\nWhat does this graph tell us about where whites and blacks lived in relation to one another between 1950-1970?\n\nHow did white populations in central cities change over a period of twenty years?\n\n​\n\n3. Ask students if they have ever heard the phrase “white flight.” What do you think the phrase might refer to? (If necessary, clarify that “white flight” is a term used to describe the migration of white populations from cities to the suburbs, a phenomenon that began in the years after WWII and continued through the 1960s.)\n\nAsk students:\n\nWhat are some ways in which “white flight” may have affected inner-city schools? What are some other aspects of life in urban areas that may have been affected by “white flight”?\n\nProcedure:\n\n1. Play clip of a newsreel story showing the Watts Riots, which broke out in the Watts neighborhood of Los Angeles in the summer of 1965.\n\nDiscuss as a class:\n\nIf you were an African American living in an inner city in 1965, what might have been your reaction to seeing the situation in Watts?\n\n2. Play clip from a interview with poet, writer, and activist Amiri Baraka on the Merv Griffin Show in September 1965. Tell students that this interview occurred just one month after the Watts Riots. Students should take notes on Baraka’s views on integration between the races. [Note to teacher: end clip at the 2:20 mark.]\n\nAsk students:\n\nWhat is Baraka’s belief about the possibility for integration in America?\n\nHow do you think the occurrence of the Watts Riots might have influenced Baraka’s statements in the interview?\n\nPoint out that violent demonstrations of civil unrest also occurred in several other inner-city neighborhoods during the 1960s, including Harlem (1964), Newark (1967), Detroit (1967), and Washington D.C. (1968).\n\n3. Play clip from the James Brown documentary Man to Man (1968). Students should take notes on how James Brown describes his role as an entertainer and his relationship to inner city audiences.\n\nAsk students:\n\nHow does this clip depict communities like Harlem, Watts, and Washington D.C., all of which were urban areas that experienced violent demonstrations of civil unrest in the late 1960s?\n\nWhy do you think James Brown feels the responsibility as an artist to direct his music and attention towards an urban black audience at this particular moment in history?\n\n4. Play audio clip of “Get Up, Get Into It, Get Involved”, a Funk song recorded by James Brown in 1970. While listening, students should pay attention to both the lyrics and the musical elements (instruments, rhythms, vocal quality, etc.) of the song.\n\nAsk students:\n\nWho do you think James Brown is addressing in this song? How might you interpret the song’s message?\n\nWhat roles does the bass play in relation to the rest of the instruments in the band? [Note: the bass is played loudly and is prominent in the recording.]\n\nWhich other instruments are played percussively or given an rhythmic emphasis in the song? [Note: students should be able to identify the horns, a guitar, drums, and vocals.]\n\nWould you consider “Get Up, Get Into It, Get Involved” to be a dance song, a song that delivers a message, or both? Explain your answer.\n\n5. Read the following quote from James Brown aloud to the class: “I had discovered that my strength was not in the horns, it was in the rhythm. I was hearing everything, even the guitars, like they were drums. I had to find out how to make it happen. On playbacks, when I saw the speakers jumping, vibrating a certain way, I knew that was it: deliverance. I could tell from looking at the speakers that the rhythm was right.”\n\nAsk students:\n\nWhat is James Brown saying about the role of rhythm in Funk music?\n\nHow might music where all the instruments are played like they were drums have offered Brown’s urban audiences a sense of deliverance? (For students not familiar with the word, you may define deliverance as the action of being rescued or set free.)\n\n6. Display two album covers by Parliament-Funkadelic, a Funk collective founded by producer and bandleader George Clinton in the early 1970s. Key members of Parliament-Funkadelic included bassist Bootsy Collins, guitarist Phelps “Catfish” Collins, trombonist Fred Wesley, and saxophonist Maceo Parker — musicians who had also performed in James Brown’s 1970s-era Funk band, the J.B.’s.\n\nAsk students:\n\nWhat imagery do you recognize on these album covers? How have these images been modified to make a statement about life in Black America in the 1970s?\n\nWhat about these album covers and titles do you think spoke to urban black audiences in the years following white flight and the violent riots of the 1960?\n\n7. Distribute Handout 1: Blaxploitation, a film genre from the early 1970s that complimented Funk as another manifestation of black art for black audiences. Invite a student volunteer to read the handout aloud to the class.\n\nAsk students to examine the graphs at the bottom of the handout, then discuss as a class:\n\nWhat can we infer about the American film industry based on this data of Academy Award winners? How did blaxploitation films address this disparity?\n\nHow does a musical score or soundtrack helped to compliment a movie’s setting? Why do you think Funk was an appropriate musical soundtrack for blaxploitation films?\n\n8. Play trailer for the 1963 film Lilies of the Field, for which Sidney Poitier became the first African American to win an Academy Award for Best Actor. Students should pay special attention to the music used in the film, as well as the setting and characters.\n\nDiscuss as a class:\n\nHow would you describe this film’s setting? How does music contribute to the setting?\n\nDo you think this film was made by a white or a black filmmaker? Explain your reasoning.\n\nWhy might this film have been viewed as a step forward for onscreen representations of African Americans? Alternately, how does it seem to continue Hollywood’s existing attitudes towards black characters?\n\n9. Next, play trailer for the 1972 blaxploitation film Superfly. Students should once again pay close attention to the music, setting, and characters.\n\nDiscuss as a class:\n\nHow would you compare the settings for Lilies of the Field and Superfly?\n\nHow would you compare the types of characters depicted in each film?\n\nHow does Curtis Mayfield’s soundtrack music compare to the music in Lilies of the Field? What musical elements of Funk does Mayfield use to compliment the setting of the film?\n\n10. Play the first four minutes a 1967 interview with Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. from the Merv Griffin Show, recorded less than a year before his assassination in 1968. Students should take notes on what steps Dr. King says are necessary in order to achieve “genuine equality” in the United States.\n\nDiscuss as a class:\n\nHow does Dr. King describe the obstacles impeding “genuine equality” between the races?\n\nIn what ways do you think Funk music and blaxploitation films represented a version of “genuine equality” for African Americans? Alternately, how were artists still limited in terms of their ability to affect social, economic, or political change through music and film?\n\nSummary Activity:\n\nIn the interview clip, Dr. King describes the Civil Rights movement as having “given the Negro a new sense of dignity, a new sense of somebody-ness.” Play a clip of Parliament-Funkadelic performing “Give Up the Funk (Tear the Roof Off the Sucker)” in 1976. Ask students to write a one-paragraph response to the clip based on one of the following writing prompts:\n\nHow do you think Dr. King might have responded to this song and performance? What elements of Parliament-Funkadelic’s music, lyrics, costuming, and staging do you think convey a sense of African-American “somebody-ness?” Explain your reasoning.\n\nThe lyrics to “Give Up the Funk” include the phrase “You’ve got a real type of thing going down, gettin’ down, there’s a whole lot of rhythm going round.” How does this lyric relate to Funk music and the conditions from which it emerged? Reference at least one resource from class in your response.\n\nExtensions:\n\n1. Listen to an excerpt of the song “Chocolate City” by Parliament-Funkadelic (1975), using the lyric sheet as a guide. As a class, discuss connections between the song and any themes from the lesson, including “white flight,” African-American representation in art and politics, etc.\n\nWrite a short essay discussing how “Chocolate City” addresses “white flight” through the eyes of a black artist. The essay should address the following questions: How does Parliament-Funkadelic use ironic humor to address both the positive and negative aspects of growing black majorities in American inner cities during the 1970s? What might be the significance of the repeated line “Gainin’ on ya”?\n\n[For a more in-depth writing assignment, assign students to include independent research into the 1970s-era political leaders and racial demographics for one or more of the cities mentioned in the song: Newark, New Jersey; Gary, Indiana; Los Angeles, California; Atlanta, Georgia; and Washington, D.C.]\n\n2. Research the career of Sylvester Stewart and his group Sly and the Family Stone, who along with James Brown, George Clinton, and Curtis Mayfield is considered one of Funk’s innovators. Write a short paper comparing Sly and the Family Stone’s 1968 single “Everyday People” to their 1969 single “Thank You (Falettinme Be Mice Elf Agin).” In what specific ways does the group’s music shift away from mainstream Pop towards a Funk sound? How do the messages of the two songs compare in terms of their respective approaches to the themes of self-identity, race, and community?\n\nHandouts\n\nHandout 1: Blaxploitation Cinema Handout 2: Chocolate City Lyrics\n\nStandards\n\nSocial Studies – National Council for the Social Studies (NCSS)\n\nTheme 1: Culture\n\nTheme 2: Time, Continuity, and Change\n\nTheme 3: People, Places, and Environment\n\nNational Standards for Music Education\n\nCore Music Standard: Responding\n\nAnalyze: Analyze how the structure and context of varied musical works inform the response.\n\nInterpret: Support interpretations of musical works that reflect creators’ and/or performers’ expressive intent.\n\nEvaluate: Support evaluations of musical works and performances based on analysis, interpretation, and established criteria.\n\nCore Music Standard: Connecting\n\nConnecting 11: Relate musical ideas and works to varied contexts and daily life to deepen understanding.\n\nNational Core Arts Standards\n\nResponding\n\nAnchor Standard 7: Perceive and analyze artistic work.\n\nAnchor Standard 8: Interpret intent and meaning in artistic work.\n\nAnchor Standard 9: Apply criteria to evaluate artistic work.\n\nConnecting\n\nAnchor Standard 10: Synthesize and relate knowledge and personal experiences to make art.\n\nAnchor Standards 11: Relate artistic ideas and work with societal, cultural and historical context to deepen understanding."
