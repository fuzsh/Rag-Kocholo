        "text": "Brown’s sound spawned a host of other funk acts, most notably Sly & The Family Stone – who hit No. 1 in 1970 with their song Thank You and Family Affair in 1971 – and The Isley Brothers. There was also crossover with Motown artists such as The Temptations.\n\nFrom this point, funk began to meld with other established genres, or break off into subgenres. George Clinton and Parliament Funkadelic managed to do both, merging funk with rock, jazz, and psychedelic rock to create what is now credited as P-funk.\n\nFunk reached the height of its commercial appeal in the 1970s with huge hit songs from Chaka Khan, Kool & The Gang, The Commodores, Chic, and Stevie Wonder to name a few. In this decade, the success of funk meant it was also beginning to influence new popular genres. Many early disco songs leaned on the same rhythmic phrasings as funk, and hip hop was spawned through middle sections of funk songs being looped on mixing decks in poverty-stricken areas of New York, as an antithesis to the rise of disco.\n\nWhere many genres effectively disappeared in the technological era of the 80s, funk managed to embrace the synthetic elements, or at least work alongside them, as seen by icon Prince who is considered to have had the biggest impact on funk since James Brown. Meanwhile, new wave acts such as Duran Duran and Talking Heads had distinctive funk elements, as did pop artists like Michael Jackson.\n\nWhile losing its commercial edge, funk continued to pervade more crossover genres in the 90s and beyond, with the funk rock of Red Hot Chili Peppers and Incubus, the metal funk of Rage Against The Machine, lounge-pop funk of Jamiroquai, as well as the R’n’B funk stylings of OutKast and Gnarls Barkley. Dr Dre even combined gangsta rap and funk to form the subgenre of G-funk.\n\nIn recent years, funk has seen a resurgence in popularity in the form of Chic and its frontman Nile Rodgers, in part due to Daft Punk’s mega-selling Random Access Memories album, which Rodgers and co were involved in writing and producing.\n\nRecommended listening:\n\nKool & The Gang – Jungle Boogie\n\nEarth, Wind & Fire – Mighty Mighty\n\nStevie Wonder – Superstition\n\nChaka Khan – Ain’t Nobody\n\nJamiroquai – Virtual Insanity\n\nJames Brown – People Get Up And Drive Your Funky Soul\n\nRecommended viewing:\n\nMr Dynamite: The Rise of James Brown – Netflix\n\nThe Story of Funk – One Nation Under a Groove\n\nFinding The Funk\n\nRecommended reading:\n\nThe Funk Era and Beyond\n\nFunk: The Music, The People and the Rhythm of The One"
