Classical piece, but for the life of me I can't find it. Anyone help me out?\n\nhello\n\nThis is also scene music only i am looking for music played during the sence where lenny is discover as the rat and Archy name all the name lenny ratted out\n\nThey've been running this movie on cable a ton here lately and there's a song that's driving me nuts, because it's NOT, I repeat, NOT listed in the soundtrack, the credits or trailer.\n\nIt's a song at the end credits after the \"I'm a Man\" ending riff by Black Strobe, and it's a funky dance track, that has a female vocal with it that sounds like she's saying ...'Kiss\" or something similar. I can't find it anywhere and it's not listed as being on the soundtrack or music credits for the film, trust me, I've checked out every single song listed.\n\nAny takers?"
