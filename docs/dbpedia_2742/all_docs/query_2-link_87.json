        "text": "Chillwave, freak folk, lo-fi house — all music sub-genres that captured our attentions for a brief moment in time, building up these wonderfully weird micro-communities of people all enjoying some type of genre crossover together. Luckily, we’ve been given some incredibly important albums and artists due to these sub-genres, and because of that, we keep going with defining music. These are the 4 sub-genres that are either having a resurgence or brand new in 2023 along with the artists pushing the boundaries in each. Did I make some of these up? Absolutely, I did, but go with it and trust the process, right? Obviously, music is all subjective, so keep that in mind when reading my absolute opinionated opinion.\n\nThere’s an intersection of Americana and folk-punk happening around the music world right now, where we’re seeing the punk-ish attitudes and songwriting be translated into stunningly good Americana. So, this is what I’m calling Nu-Americana — a songwriting approach that focuses on the issues of today (mental health, LGTBQ+, politics) and puts them on a classic folk/country landscape. A stunning takeover of the genre with already infamous Orville Peck to newcomers like Mal Blum and Olive Klug, here are the artists you should listen to:\n\nI promise you, this is the one genre I didn’t make up. Bubblegrunge is making a strong appearance in 2023, already captivating listeners who like a darker “pop” sound. So what is this new genre? According to Google, Bubblegrunge is a “poppier version of the grunge/alternative sound of the 90s” — mixed with other genres like midwest emo, the genre is hopefully here to stay. Check out some of our up & coming favorites in the genre below.\n\nA pretty basic sub-genre, but one that keeps haunting my musical ears in all the best ways possible. From TikTok stars like Lawrence to Remi Wolf’s blunt diary-like music, these artists are bringing the funk and soul of the 70s into a fresh canvas. The sunshine vibes are heavy within these artists.\n\nThis is not your dad’s 70s rock. This new sub-genre is an elevated version of the greats, blending those hazy/creamy melodies with psychedelic features wrapped with a pop music bow. Yes, it’s wild, but there is such a strong presence of this sound in music today, one that will shape the “indie rock” genre throughout the entire year and hopefully longer."
