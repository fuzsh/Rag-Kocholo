        "text": "Food For Thought\n\nLet‚Äôs Funk It Up\n\nThroughout time, music has been used as a way to connect people, express feelings, and tell stories. This week‚Äôs newsletters will highlight some of the most well-known and little-known musicians, music facts, and genres. Today‚Äôs theme: Funk.\n\nWe recently discovered a local band that incorporates some funky, groovy rhythms in their music.\n\nNot only does the music make you want to get out of your seat and dance, but the lyrics also hit home. Most notably (and echoing the words of Bono):\n\n‚ÄúJoy is an act of defiance,\n\nLove is the thing that provides it.‚Äù\n\n- ‚ÄúOn My Way‚Äù by Kiwano Sour\n\n<Rant>\n\nIn a world trying to suck us into a narrative of fear, uncertainty, and doubt‚Ä¶ in a world where our minds have been conditioned to live off the nourishment of negative feedback loops‚Ä¶ in a world where the infinite is eternally chased while the finite lays unappreciated‚Ä¶\n\nJoy truly is an act of defiance.\n\n</Rant>\n\nOne form of music stands out among the rest for really embracing the joy of living.\n\nFunk.\n\nNo matter the topic of the song, funk music always seems to celebrate life for what it is ‚Äî and no matter what, you want to get out of your seat and get groovin‚Äô. üï∫üï∫\n\nBut where‚Äôd it all start?\n\nLike with rock, pop, and hip-hop, funk originated from a mix of jazz, blues, and R&B.\n\nIt emerged as its own genre in the late ‚Äô60s when soul singer James Brown started experimenting with his music. His ‚Äô69 hit, ‚ÄúCold Sweat,‚Äù is usually referred to as the first ever funk song.\n\n(Side Note: Can we PLEASE bring back that puffy hair and super deep v-neck look‚Ä¶ üòé)\n\nSo what separated funk music from the rest of the bumpin‚Äô tunes of the time?\n\nFunk is based on a unique onbeat/offbeat structure that originated in African music traditions. Using guitar riffs and bass lines, funk creates an intense groove. (More here.)\n\nAfter James Brown, George Clinton is considered the architect of the type of funk we know today. His bands were Parliament and Funkadelic and their ‚ÄúP-Funk‚Äù style used distorted electric guitars and synthesizers to create a new type of sound.\n\nIn the 1970s, funk became mainstream and artists like the Commodores, Sly and the Family Stone, Bootsy‚Äôs Rubber Band, and Kool and the Gang, among others, grew in popularity. Around this time, disco music emerged, drawing strongly from frunk.\n\nIn the 80s, folks like Rick James and Prince took over the funk scene. After that, however, funk was mostly driven from the radio in favor of new pop and rock music. Even still, popular artists, like Red Hot Chili Peppers, Living Colour, Incubus, Outkast, and Gnarls Barkley, incorporated elements of funk.\n\nToday, it‚Äôs argued that funk is dead, or at least, the funk of the olden days. There may never be another ‚ÄúSuper Freak,‚Äù ‚ÄúBrick House,‚Äù or ‚ÄúPlay That Funky Music White Boy‚Äù‚Ä¶ but funk influence has certainly made its way into much of our modern music. (‚ÄúUptown Funk,‚Äù anyone?)\n\nFunk subgenres, like electro-funk, boogie, funk rock, and funk jam, still inspire artists around the world."
