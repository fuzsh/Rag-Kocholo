        "text": "Rap music, like many other music genres has divulged into a whole host of subgenres. The rap genre proves to be massive, spawning new iterations to this day with sounds ranging from classic conscious hip hop artists to new genres like emo rap inspired by trap music and pioneers like Lil Uzi Vert.\n\nBelow, we'll dive into the history of rap and hip hop music and explore each unique rap subgenre.\n\nWhat Is Rap Music?\n\nThe word \"rap\" is built off of an acronym that means rhythm and poetry. Rap music can describe a variety of subgenres that use the rap vocal delivery. Essentially, rap is the art of combining rhythmic speech and beats to create music. The backing tracks of rap music often use digitized sampling and beats.\n\nThe History of Rap Music\n\nRap music is most often associated with hip hop, a broader cultural movement and music genre that originated in New York City in the 1970s. Hip hop culture gave way to cultural cornerstones like grafitti, DJing, MCing (which led to rap), and break dancing. This genre came to be out of block parties, where DJs would sample the likes of funk, soul, disco, and other records.\n\nMCs would help introduce different DJs to crowds, helping to keep the audience engaged over the course of a set. Overtime, this evolved to MCs rapping over DJ sets, giving birth to the new genre.\n\nThe release of Rapper's Delight by The Sugarhill Gang helped cement the genre into public prominence, along with Kurtis Blows' The Breaks . Rapping and DJing evolved hand in hand through the power of hip hop, creating signature sonic elements like the record scratch, needle drop, and drum machines.\n\nRap Vs. Hip Hop Vs. Trap: What's The Difference?\n\nRap is technically a type of vocal delivery. Hip hop music encompasses the birth of rap vocal delivery being used on a mass scale. Trap music is a subgenre of hip hop music that originated in the South of the United States. This genre is known for using heavy hitting 808s, hi hats, and continues to evolve to this day into further iterations like emo rap.\n\n27 Different Types of Rap\n\nReady to dive into the different rap subgenres?
