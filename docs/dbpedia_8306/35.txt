Hierarchical Clustering is a machine learning algorithm used for grouping similar data points into clusters. It starts with each data point in its own cluster, and then recursively merges the two closest clusters until there is only one cluster left.

The algorithm uses a distance metric to determine the similarity between clusters and data points, and creates a dendrogram to visualize the hierarchy of the merged clusters.
