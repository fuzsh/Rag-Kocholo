        "text": "Qualtrics Website / App Insights helps organizations measure and enhance the experience a web visitor has within their digital media. With a Website / App Insights project you can present cool graphics on your website with links and embedded surveys to get feedback on your visitors' experience, let them know about your latest deals and promotions, and more!\n\nWhether you run a marketing blog, support documentation, developer resources, or another site, your content needs to be kept up to date. As a website grows in size, it can get harder to focus your improvement efforts. It’s also important to determine whether the content you’re producing is effective and measure its impact.\n\nAny information that can be tracked by Website / App Insights can also be sent to your target website or target survey. For example, if your target is a website satisfaction survey, you can choose to save information about how long the participant was on the website or how many pages they visited. This information is not saved within the intercept or creative itself, but is passed over to your website or survey.\n\nAny information that can be tracked by Website / App Insights can also be sent to your target website or target survey.

In this section, you will learn about Website conditions. These conditions can be based off cookie values, Javascript Expressions, HTML on the site, and more.\n\nWhen you're finally ready to deploy your Website / App Insights project on your website, head over to the Deployment section of the Settings tab. Here, there are also several options you can adjust before deploying."
