Today, we seek to find a reasonable answer to put an end to this debate by understanding in depth why Python is object oriented language. However, before we pass a final verdict on the kind of programming language that Python is, you must first understand what an OOP language is. Check out our free courses to get an edge over the competition. What is object-oriented programming (OOP)? Object-oriented programming (OOP) refers to the programming language in which the coders/developers explicitly define the data types, data structures, and also the types of functions that can be applied to the data structures. Thus, the data structures become “objects” incorporating both data and functions. In the OOP language, programs are organized and constructed around objects and not around logic and functions. This is contrary to the historical programming approach that focuses on how the logic is written rather than defining the data within the logic. What does a Software Developer do? Check out upGrad’s Advanced Certification in DevOps An object is a self-contained entity that comprises both data and the procedures required to manipulate the data. In simple words, it denotes a data field with unique attributes and behaviour. Thus, the OOP model operates by interacting and invoking the properties of the various objects among themselves. Learn more about python with our data science programs. Here are the basic principles/features of object-oriented programming: Class A Class is a blueprint or outline of the object that defines the attributes and methods that hold the real functionality of the data. These attributes and methods are referred to as “members.” You can access the members according to the defined access modifiers while declaring the members. Explore Our Software Development Free Courses Fundamentals of Cloud Computing JavaScript Basics from the scratch Data Structures and Algorithms Blockchain Technology React for Beginners Core Java Basics Java Node.js for Beginners Advanced JavaScript Check out upGrad’s Advanced Certification in Cyber Security Career Options for Software Engineers Inheritance Inheritance refers to the relationships and subclasses between different objects that allow programmers to use and reuse a common logic, while simultaneously sustaining a unique hierarchy. In this process, the data is cleaned, transformed, and visualized by minimizing the redundancy of the code to allow for a more thorough and accurate data analysis. Objects Python is object oriented programming language where the object is connected to a state and activity. Any physical device, such as a keyboard, mouse, chair, etc., may be used. Arrays, floating-point, dictionaries, and numbers, are all examples of objects. Any individual string or number, more specifically, is an object. You may not even be aware of the fact that you have been utilising items. Encapsulation Encapsulation refers to the process of juxtaposing different elements to build a unique entity. In this process, the implementation and state of each object are privately retained inside a defined class, so that other objects cannot make changes to the class – they can only declare a list of public functions. Encapsulation or data hiding enhances code security and also prevents data corruption. upGrad’s Exclusive Software and Tech Webinar for you – SAAS Business – What is So Different? document.createElement('video'); https://cdn.upgrad.com/blog/mausmi-ambastha.mp4 Explore our Popular Software Engineering Courses Master of Science in Computer Science from LJMU & IIITB Caltech CTME Cybersecurity Certificate Program Full Stack Development Bootcamp PG Program in Blockchain Executive PG Program in Full Stack Development View All our Courses Below Software Engineering Courses Also read: Java free online courses! Abstraction Abstraction is defined as the process of hiding the implementation of the functionalities and expose only those interfaces or accessing methods required to trigger the methods of the implementation class. In other words, the objects only give away those functionalities that are relevant for the use of other objects. Polymorphism As the name suggests, polymorphism refers to the process in which objects can take on more than one form depending on the demand of the circumstances. It determines the usage or meaning necessary for each execution of that object, thereby eliminating the need for duplicating the code. The two methods of polymorphism are – method overloading and method overriding. Now, that we’ve covered the basics of OOP, we can move on to the question – Is Python Object Oriented? Honestly, we cannot classify Python as strictly an object-oriented programming language. It is an intuitive, high-level, multi-paradigm programming language (supports multiple programming approaches) it that combines the features of both object-oriented programming and aspect-oriented programming. While it borrows heavily from the OOP language, it is also at the same time functional, procedural, imperative, and reflective. That’s because it is heavily influenced by a combination of many other programming languages including JavaScript, CoffeeScript, Ruby, Swift, Groovy, and Go. Java, Objective C, C++, Ruby, Smalltalk, Visual Basic.NET, Simula, and JavaScript, are the few examples of OOP languages. And just like any other OOP language, Python too uses the fundamentals of OOP. For instance, in Python, Class means the same as it is for other OOP languages. Then, Python also retains the inheritance mechanism of OOP. To top that, Python can be integrated with other OOP languages like Java for developing applications in both languages that will incorporate the functionalities of both and you can call both the languages within each other to execute the application successfully. However, Python isn’t an OOP language through-and-through since it does not allow strong encapsulation. This is because its creator Guido van Rossum aimed to keep things simple and that meant not hiding data in the strictest sense of the term. Instead of encapsulation, in Python, there’s a convention for data hiding wherein you can prefix the data members with two underscores. Apart from this, Python supports all the basic features of OOP language. This answers the question, is python object oriented? So, there – mystery solved! Check out the trending Python Tutorial concepts in 2024 Advantages of Object Oriented Programming After we understand the facts to the question, is python object oriented, we must understand its advantages and why it should be used. Python is object oriented programming language, which works as a very fundamental part of the development of software, where OOP creates a class instead of just writing a program. This class contains data and its functions, all related to the customers. OOP comes with several advantages – Re-using the code – It entails reusing certain facilities rather than continually developing them. Using a class is how this is accomplished. It can be used ‘n’ a number of times, depending on our needs. For example, in your coding, the car is your object. One of your colleagues requires a limousine car, while the other one needs a race car. While every person has a unique way of building their objects, this one is quite simple. The main object is ‘car’ while the requirements are just different types of cars. Using the inheritance technique in this example will make more sense. You can create one class, the car, and then create certain subclasses in which you can write different types of cars. What if you wish to alter every Car item, no matter what kind? This is the benefit of the OOP strategy. All car objects will automatically inherit any changes you make to your Car class. Maintenance of Code – Any programming language would benefit from this capability; it prevents users from redo work in various ways. Maintaining and updating the current codes by adding new modifications is always simple, time-saving, and a great benefit of OOP. Productivity Increases – Less time consumption results in more work being completed, a better programmer being finished, more built-in functionality, and easier to understand, write, and maintain. A programmer using OOP may combine new software elements to create entirely new applications. It is made feasible by a number of libraries with a wealth of beneficial features. Unnecessary Data can be removed – This is a situation that develops when an identical piece of data is stored in two different places, such as two databases. One of the biggest benefits of OOP is the disposal of unnecessary data. Users can write common class definitions for comparable functions and inherit them if they require the same functionality in other classes. Security Maintenance – We retain security and provide required data for viewing by filtering out restricted data with the help of encrypting the data and abstraction mechanisms. Design Benefits – A consumer will gain design benefits from using OOPs in terms of designing and repairing things quickly and reducing risks. Here, object-oriented programming necessitates a lengthy and thorough design phase from the designers, which produces better designs with fewer faults. It is simpler to programmer all the non-one OOPs at a time when the programmer has reached certain crucial boundaries. Problem Solving Techniques – It is a good idea to break down a difficult issue into manageable pieces or individual components. OOP is an approach that excels at this behavior because it divides your software code into manageable pieces, one object at a time. The broken parts can be restored by future units that relate to an identical interface and provide details of the implementation, or they can be reused in approaches to various other issues. These advantages must be enough to understand why Python is object oriented language. Learn Software Development online from the World’s top Universities.

So if you are part of the remaining 1% – you can safely skip this post. There is a surprisingly easy hack that you can apply to increase your value generally in life. Pick up more skills. It sounds obvious when put on paper but there is one subtlety which makes it a “hack” in my opinion. For this point, we turn to the excellent Scott Adams’ book – “How to fail at almost everything and still win big”. Speaking about being successful, he says – “… I tell them there’s a formula for it. You can manipulate your odds of success by how you choose to fill out the variables in the formula. The formula, roughly speaking, is that every skill you acquire doubles your odds of success.” He goes on to mention that the level of proficiency for a skill is not mentioned because – “… you can raise your market value by being merely good – not extraordinary – at more than one skill.” “To put the success formula into its simplest form: Good + Good > Excellent” upGrad’s Exclusive Software Development Webinar for you – SAAS Business – What is So Different? document.createElement('video'); https://cdn.upgrad.com/blog/mausmi-ambastha.mp4 Check out upGrad’s Java Bootcamp This subtlety makes it very easy to execute. You don’t need to be extraordinary, you just have to be ordinary/average. Hence, if you are an average software engineer and you have any of the skills mentioned below – Good at drawing Public speaking Managing people Have a knack to pick up people’s emotions An eye for design in product Spot problems in operational processes Shoot, edit and/or make videos Make original music Sing Writing essays/blog posts Or anything else Explore Our Software Development Free Courses Fundamentals of Cloud Computing JavaScript Basics from the scratch Data Structures and Algorithms Blockchain Technology React for Beginners Core Java Basics Java Node.js for Beginners Advanced JavaScript Check out upGrad’s Full Stack Development Bootcamp (JS/MERN) Learn Software development courses online from the World’s top Universities.

So is the framework for a web application. A software framework provides a standard way to design, build and deploy applications. In a world of Java platforms, the Javascript framework was the most uttered buzzword until Angular gained importance. Now, let us see some Salient features of Angular. Angular is an Open source Javascript framework which morphed into what is called ‘Typescript’ now. Code generation and development are rapid compared to a (Javascript) JS code. The Command line prompt (CLI) has commands to build application faster. The Code is well organized as it uses components hence improves productivity A directive is a dynamic function that handles variables, if statements, and loops in HTML Angular is cross-platform hence it is independent of the browser and the operating system Angular CLI comes with testing tools that are helpful for unit testing Check out our free courses to get an edge over the competition Learn Software engineering courses online from the World’s top Universities.

AngularJS – A precursor to Angular AngularJS was the first product in the Angular series introduced by Google in 2009. It is a client-side or a front-end framework. What this means is that the code runs on the user’s browser and not on the web server. AngularJS was written purely in Javascript. This was developed to decouple the application logic, however, it was the only fairly successful and paved way for Angular with its current avatar 7.0.

Check out upGrad’s Java Bootcamp Explore Our Software Development Free Courses Fundamentals of Cloud Computing JavaScript Basics from the scratch Data Structures and Algorithms Blockchain Technology React for Beginners Core Java Basics Java Node.js for Beginners Advanced JavaScript Angular 7.0 Framework Let us understand briefly the building blocks of Angular: Module: Basically breaks down application’s core screens logically. For example, if there is a shopping cart page, one might want to have a shopping cart module. Component: This is a section of the UI and is a ‘class’ as in object-oriented programming. This is the fundamental building block of the User Interface (UI). The component class contains the core logic for the page. ” upGrad’s Exclusive Software Development Webinar for you – SAAS Business – What is So Different? document.createElement('video'); https://cdn.upgrad.com/blog/mausmi-ambastha.mp4 ” Components are made up of: Template: A template is written in HTML or they can be HTML files. It can have dynamic properties like variables and use of ‘if conditions’ is possible with directives. Class: Is the code for the application. The code is written in Typescript. Typescript is a superset of Javascript. Typescript is a ‘static’ type language where variables are declared with types defined. Hence errors are caught on the compilation of the program rather than being caught at runtime. Angular classes can be written in Javascript too. Components have data properties and methods. Metadata: To identify that the class is an Angular component one uses Metadata. Metadata can be attached to Typescript using a decorator declaration. Let us walk through a simple component in Angular. Import {component} from ‘’@angular/core’’ ; Here the component package is imported from Angular core library. @component ({ (this is a decorator declaration) Selector : ‘myapplication’ …(.this is the custom HTML tag that we use to insert the component. ) Template: ‘<h1> Hello {(name)}</h1> (name is a variable) }) export class AppComponent{ (This is the component class and ‘name’ is a property in the class) name = ‘ Angular framework’; } <body> <myapplication>Loading a sample app component here..</myapplication> </body> Data binding: A process that allows communication between the component and the view. So data is passed from the component to the view and vice-versa. There are four types of data binding. In Interpolation and property binding the data is sent from the component to the view and in event binding, the data is sent to the component from the view or the template. In two-way binding, the data travels both ways. Service: This is a class that is written for reusable code, i.e. code that can be accessed from multiple components. These classes send data and functionality across components. Service classes can also get data from a database or a js/JSON file. When one uses a Service class, the code looks organized and fragmented. Directive: Customizing HTML attributes to extend the power of HTML is a directive. ngIf, ngFor, ngModel are directives. ngModel is responsible for, binding the view into the model, which other directives such as input, textarea or Select require. Here is a piece of code that shows how ngmodel works. <div ng-app=”” ng-init=”firstName=’John'”> <p>Input a name in the input box:</p> <p>Name: <input type=”text” ng-model=”firstName”></p> <p>You wrote: {{ firstName }}</p> </div> Explore our Popular Software Engineering Courses Master of Science in Computer Science from LJMU & IIITB Caltech CTME Cybersecurity Certificate Program Full Stack Development Bootcamp PG Program in Blockchain Executive PG Program in Full Stack Development View All our Courses Below Software Engineering Courses So, firstName was initialized to ‘John’ and when one enters a new value in the text box, firstName will hold the new name entered.Check out upGrad’s Full Stack Development Bootcamp (JS/MERN) Dependency injection (DI): Classes need objects to perform a particular function. Instead of creating the objects each time in the class, the class receives the objects(dependencies) from external sources. In the DI framework following are the steps that need to be followed: Create a Service Class eg. Employeedata Register this service class with the Injector. An Injector is a container that holds all the dependency classes Declare the Employeedata class as a dependency in the class that needs it eg. EmployeeList Class What Does A Software Developer Do? Versions of Angular After AngularJS, Angular 2 was released which was a complete rewrite of AngularJS. Components got added from Angular 2. Angular 2 was not backwards compatible. Angular is made up of a bunch of packages and the Router package in Angular 3 was not in sync. Hence the Angular team moved on to Angular 4 which was released with all corrections and features with backward compatibility to Angular 2. Subsequently Angular 5, Angular 6 was released and the latest version now is Angular 7. What’s new in Angular 7.0? CLI Prompts: A change in the Angular command line prompt is that the CLI prompts the user, to select the features while running the common commands. Features like Angular routing or the format of the style-sheet and many more can be selected by the user. In the previous versions of Angular one had to remember and type the options on the prompt. Application Performance : Common errors: In this version, the angular team analyzed and removed some common mistakes made by the developers like the ‘reflect-metadata’ polyfill was included in production which is actually needed only in development. Bundle-Budgets: To improve the performance of the application, default Bundle Budgets are defined in angular.JSON. The developers will now be warned if the application bundle size exceeds a limit of 5MB and when the initial bundle exceeds 2MB. These values can be modified in the JSON file as needed. Angular Material & the CDK: The Angular component development kit(CDK) was created from the Angular Material(UI for libraries).The two new features added in the CDK are Virtual Scrolling: To load only the visible part on the screen, the <cdk-virtual-scroll-viewport> package provides helpers for directives that react to scroll events. So, it will render only the items that can fit on the screen. When a user scrolls through the list then the DOM will load and unload the elements dynamically based on the display size. Drag and Drop support: The @angular/cdk/drag-drop module helps free drag and drop feature of an element, reordering items in a list, moving items in a list and so on. This is done with the help of cdkDropList and cdkDrag directives. Angular 7.0 has updated its dependencies to support Typescript 3.1, RxJS 6.3 and Node 10. Improved accessibility of Selects: The native ’select’ has some performance, accessibility, and usability advantages hence using a native select element inside a ‘mat-form-field’ is a new feature in Angular 7.0. Angular elements: A small change but new in Angular 7 “Angular Elements now supports content projection using web standards for custom elements.” — This is what Stephen Fluin, Angular says. Working with partners: The Angular team has been working to partner with community projects that have been launched recently one of them is Angular Console. Angular Console is a user interface for Angular CLI. It is good for beginners and experts as it is a lot easier than prompts. There are different UI versions for Windows and Mac OS.

One such battle is IntelliJ IDEA vs. Eclipse – the selection of the best Integrated Development Environment – affectionately known as the IDE. There are many IDEs in the market today for Java development – the likes of Netbeans, DrJava, and of course Eclipse and IntelliJ IDEA are just to name a few. These IDEs ease the workflow of a developer by providing them with a complete and integrated environment. The support of various plugins coupled with the ability to handle large projects seamlessly makes the IDEs an irreplaceable tool in any developer’s toolkit. Learn Software development courses online from the World’s top Universities. Earn Executive PG Programs, Advanced Certificate Programs, or Masters Programs to fast-track your career. Today we’ll be looking at two such IDEs in depth, and taking them head to head. We’ll look at how Eclipse and IntelliJ IDEA compete against each other in terms of the features they offer. Check out our free courses to get an edge over the competition. Eclipse IDE Eclipse is by far the most commonly used IDE by budding as well as experienced developers. It is supported by a large community of developers, great documentation to get you up and running, and the best part – the support of thousands of plugins to make your experience even better. Eclipse is mainly used for developing web, mobile, desktop, enterprise, or embedded system applications. It can be used open-source under Eclipse public license. Eclipse is written mostly in Java and runs seamlessly on the three major operating systems – Windows, Linux, and Mac OS. Although well known for Java programming, it also supports various other languages including Groovy, Scala, and Python. Check out upGrad’s Advanced Certification in Cloud Computing Eclipse is capable of opening multiple projects in the same window thereby giving you control over dependencies and relations. However, regarding user experience and the ease of code completion and inspection, Eclipse falls short despite having many plugins, especially checkstyle. If you’re a rookie programmer, you’d appreciate an auto-complete feature that can show the list of the most relevant symbols applicable in your context. Eclipse falls short on that. Just for argument’s sake, we can use this point in favour of Eclipse saying it offers a better learning curve, but at the end of the day, it’s really about how easy it is to get your application up and running. Having said that, Eclipse is and will continue to be, widely used all over the globe. Let’s take a look at some of its features that keep it going despite the limitations. A Beginner’s Guide to MVC Architecture in Java Check out upGrad’s Advanced Certification in Blockchain Salient Features of Eclipse Mylyn: Mylyn is a subsystem of eclipse for task management. The advantages of Mylyn are quite well known, but you won’t appreciate them till you use it and see them for yourself. Mylyn helps developers track their tasks in a task list view – without having to open a browser. Mylyn provides an easy way of keeping track of all the files related to your current work. Software Updates: Eclipse provides frequent and regular software updates. The ability to simply update your IDE from the console itself without worrying about dependencies, or unzipping a zipped file makes a developer’s life easier. Everything is managed through this simple dialogue: Enterprise Java Tooling: Eclipse has the best tooling to offer for JEE projects. It offers an outstanding amount of functionalities – from wizards for Web Service creation, XML editing, to excellent JSF and JPA tooling. In essence, it’s a very simple feature but is very useful. The ability to control and deploy the server of your choice is commendable. Also, if your server isn’t on the list, you’ll likely find a plug-in to support your server. Model Driven Development: The Eclipse Modelling Project offers a set of modelling tools for those using EMF or related techniques for modelling. The Ecore Tools that are used to work with the EMF models allow you to create and modify your ecore using a standard tree, or through the visual Ecore diagram editor (see below). 15 Must-Know Spring MVC Interview Questions IntelliJ IDEA IDE IntelliJ IDEA is a fully featured IDE developed by JetBrains. JetBrains is an established company and famous for the Resharper plugin for Visual Studio that is beneficial for C# development. The IntelliJ IDEA comes in two editions – Free community edition and an Ultimate edition. The free community edition of IntelliJ IDEA offers the basic features useful for developing Android and Java applications. Google’s official Android development platform – Android Studio, is also based on IntelliJ IDEA’s free community edition. This IDE supports many languages from Java, Kotlin, Scala, Android, Mercurial, Groovy, Gradle, Git, SVN, SBT, and CVS and also offers basics (yet essential) features like code completion, deep static analysis, intelligent refactorings, debugger, test runner, etc. The Ultimate Edition, on the other hand, has the most advanced set of features for developing web and desktop applications. Some of the additional features of the Ultimate Edition Supports the integration of Spring framework. Supports web app scripting languages like JavaScript, CoffeeScript, TypeScript, and many more. Supports web development framework like Node.js, Angular, and React Java EE support such as JSF, JAX-RS, JPA, CDI, etc Eclipse falls short in providing good assistance for code completion despite supporting many plugins. The default code compilation in IntelliJ is much faster and better, especially if you’re a newbie programmer – IntelliJ can help you improve your code. One of them is Smart Completion which provides you with the list of the most relevant symbols applicable in your current context. This as well as other completions constantly learn from your coding practices and moves your most frequently used packages and classes to the top of the list, so that you can select the right option faster. Another such feature is Chain completion which is even smarter than the Smart Completion. It lists all the applicable symbols by making use of getters or methods which makes it even faster. There are many other out-of-the-box features too which make IntelliJ IDEA a truly intelligent IDE What is Test-driven Development: A Newbie’s Guide Features which make IntelliJ IDEA a truly intelligent Version Control: IntelliJ IDEA offers the developers with a unified interface for most of the version control systems. Git, SVN, Mercurial, CVS, and Perforce are just to name a few. This single interface lets you browse the history of changes, manage branches, and merge conflicts. Build Tools: This IDE supports all the major build tools like Gradle, Maven, Gant, SBT, NPM, Grunt, Gulp, and more. These tools eventually help automate compiling, packaging, running tests, deploying, and other activities. Application Servers: It supports major application servers like TomCat, JBoss, WebSphere, Glassfish, and many more. It allows you to deploy your code onto the application servers and debug the deployed code from the IDE itself. Indexing: IntelliJ indexes the entire project when you first start it up. That way, it doesn’t need to search for files every time you need a resource (unlike Eclipse). This significantly speeds up the search process. Polyglot Support: As we’ve said earlier, IntelliJ IDEA supports many JVM and non-JVM frameworks and languages out of the box. Frameworks and languages like AngularJS, React, JavaScript, TypeScript, Scala, SQL are just a few examples of the wide array of languages supported by IntelliJ IDEA. All these features make IntelliJ IDEA a clear winner when it comes to usability and user experience. However, it falls short on the number of plugins offered. Compared to 1,276 plugins offered by Eclipse, IntelliJ only offers ~700 plugins. But, this shouldn’t be a dealbreaker as IntelliJ offers a lot of new and improved features out of the box, without needing any plugin – unlike Eclipse.

Whatever you pick from the list below. What’s the number? Concepts needed: print, while loop, if/else statements, random function, input/ output This is a guessing game that the user plays with the program/computer. The program generates a random number using the random function. The user tries to guess it by inputting a value. The program then indicates whether the guess is right or not. If it is wrong, then the program should tell how off the guess was. If it is right, there should be another positive indicator. You can place a limit on the number of guesses allowed. You will also need functions to compare the inputted number with the guessed number, to compute the difference between the two, and to check whether an actual number was inputted or not. Explore Our Software Development Free Courses Fundamentals of Cloud Computing JavaScript Basics from the scratch Data Structures and Algorithms Blockchain Technology React for Beginners Core Java Basics Java Node.js for Beginners Advanced JavaScript Spin a yarn Concepts needed: strings, concatenation, variables, print. Things get more interesting here since strings are infinitely more complex to play with at the beginning. The program first prompts the user to enter a series of inputs. These can be an adjective, a preposition, a proper noun, etc. Once all the inputs are in place, they are placed in a premade story template using concatenation. In the end, the full story is printed out to read some misintended madness! Check out upGrad’s Java Bootcamp What’s the word? Concepts needed: strings, variables, random function, variables, input/ output Similar to ‘What’s the Number?’, this name focuses on the user having to guess the randomly generated word. You can create a list from which the word would have to be guessed and also set a cap on the number of guesses allowed. After this, you can create the rules yourself! When the user inputs the word, you can indicate whether the alphabet written appears in this particular position or not. You will need a function to check if the user is inputting alphabets or numbers and to display error messages appropriately.

We again use the random function here. You make a move first and then the program makes one. To indicate the move, you can either use a single alphabet or input an entire string. A function will have to be set up to check the validity of the move. Using another function, the winner of that round is decided. You can then either give an option of playing again or decide a pre-determined number of moves in advance. A scorekeeping function will also have to be created which will return the winner at the end. Compute, calculate Concepts needed: functions, input/ output, variables, This project involves building a simple calculator that can perform mathematical functions (which you decide). You can start with the basic BODMAS, and then progress to logarithms and exponents. You’ll have to keep tabs on what the user is entering and get the answer to print at the end. Whether the values in the middle of the calculation keep showing up is up to you. upGrad’s Exclusive Software Development Webinar for you – SAAS Business – What is So Different? document.createElement('video'); https://cdn.upgrad.com/blog/mausmi-ambastha.mp4 Leap it! Concepts needed: functions, input/ output, boolean, print In this program, you input a year and check whether it is a leap year or not. For this, you’ll have to create a function that recognizes the pattern of leap years and can try fitting the inputted year into the pattern. In the end, you can print the result using a boolean expression. Find out, Fibonacci! Concepts needed: functions, input/output, boolean, print You input a number and the function created checks whether the number belongs to the Fibonacci sequence or not. The underlying workings are similar to the above ‘Leap it!’ program. One common theme in all the above projects is that they will help you to get your basics right. You will be the developer and the bug fixer. Not to mention, you’ll be closing working with creating and implementing a variety of functions along with working with variables, strings, integers, operators, etc. Just like 2 + 2 is the building block of your mathematics knowledge, so are these concepts, and learning about them in a fun way through building projects will help to understand and retain them more.

To successfully implement the DevOps approach, DevOps Engineers must be well-versed in the best practices of DevOps methodology, that include: Continuous Integration – This practice requires developers to merge the alterations in their code into a central repository, after which it runs the automated builds and tests. Continuous integration aims to identify and fix bugs quicker, enhance the software quality, and reduce the validation and release time of software updates. Continuous Delivery – In this practice, the code changes are built, tested, and prepared automatically for the production release. It is the successive step to continuous integration wherein all the code changes are deployed to a testing environment and/or a production environment following the build phase. Infrastructure as Code – This practice encourages the provision and management of the infrastructure using specific code and software development techniques (version control, continuous integration, etc.). Instead of manually setting up and configuring the infrastructure resources, the cloud’s API-driven model allows developers and system administrators to work with and scale the infrastructure programmatically. Monitoring and Logging – Monitoring and logging are essential to check and measure the metrics of applications and infrastructure and see how their performance affects the user experience of a product/service. Communication and Collaboration – DevOps encourages increased communication and collaboration within organizations. DevOps tools, along with the software delivery process automation, allow for increased cooperation between the development and operations teams by merging their workflows and responsibilities. Microservices Architecture – It is a design approach used to develop a single application as a component of small services. In this design, the individual services run their own processes while communicating with other services via a well-defined interface (usually an HTTP-based API).

DevOps Engineers have to perform a wide range of tasks to fulfill their three core functions – coding, scripting, and process re-engineering. The primary duties of a DevOps Engineer are: Project Planning DevOps Engineers are an integral part of the project planning operation. Their skills in software development and system options, and business expertise (the risk, impact, and costs vs. benefits) allows them to foresee the project needs and resources, thereby helping them to create actionable timelines and strategies for business projects. Product Development DevOps Engineers are responsible for developing, building, and managing IT solutions. To meet this end, they have to install and configure solutions, implement reusable components, translate technical requirements, perform script maintenance and updates, assist operations teams at all phases of data testing, develop interface stubs and simulators, to name a few. Product Deployment DevOps Engineers design and develop automated deployment arrangements by leveraging configuration management technology. This allows them to deploy new modules/upgrades and fixes in the production environment itself. Also, DevOps Engineers have to ready the new modules/upgrades for production.

Earn Executive PG Programs, Advanced Certificate Programs or Masters Programs to fast-track your career. Agile Methodology & Scrum Methodology What is Agile? Agile methodology refers to a software development practice that focuses on the continuous iteration of development and testing in the SDLC (software development life cycle) process. Unlike the Waterfall methodology that analyzes and documents the project requirements before the development process begins, in the Agile approach, the requirements are determined as the software-development advances with each iteration. This offers scope for flexibility in accommodating the necessary changes in the requirements/priorities of the business as and when they come. In Agile methodology, the development and testing activities occur simultaneously. It breaks the product into smaller fragments, and the work is prioritized according to business or customer value. It encourages teamwork and constant communication within teams and between teams and customers as well. As such, the Agile approach aims to bring all the stakeholders together in the product development process.

It is accomplished through the continuous delivery of software products in parts. It should be flexible enough to accommodate changes in requirements even in later phases of software development. Business teams, developers, and customers must regularly collaborate throughout the SLDC. Face-to-face interaction is pivotal for transparency and enhanced communication within the teams. Encourage sustainable development by maintaining a constant pace throughout the development process. Together, all teams should regularly reflect and brainstorm on how to enhance productivity to boost project effectiveness. Foster self-organization within teams to deliver top-notch architectures and designs. Offer higher autonomy to team members having greater support and trust. Deliver efficient and working software frequently within shorter periods. Measure project progress through the success of the working software.

Scrum is a subset of Agile methodology. Naturally, it also focuses on delivering a product in stages within short periods. Rather than being a process or a technique, Scrum is a simple and lightweight framework that seeks to address complex problems (of a specific project) and deliver high-value business products. Scrum assumes that the project requirements are bound to change or are not defined before the project development process begins. By repeatedly inspecting and monitoring working software, it aims to foster accountability, cross-functional teamwork, and progress toward a well-defined business goal. ” upGrad’s Exclusive Software Development Webinar for you – SAAS Business – What is So Different? document.createElement('video'); https://cdn.upgrad.com/blog/mausmi-ambastha.mp4 ” Check out upGrad’s Full Stack Development Bootcamp (JS/MERN) Roles in the Scrum framework Product Owner – The Product Owner is responsible for optimizing the work and product value of the development team. Apart from this, a Product Owner also manages the product catalog. Scrum Master – The Scrum Master is responsible for organizing daily team meetings and handling challenges and bottlenecks in the development process. Scrum Masters communicate with the Product Owner to ensure that the product backlog is ready for the succeeding sprint. Scrum Team – The Scrum Team works in collaboration with the Product Owner and Scrum Master to plan how much of the project they can complete in each iteration.

Scrum, on the other hand, is perfect for projects where the requirements change frequently and fast. The Agile methodology views leadership as a pivotal role in project development. However, Scrum encourages self-organizing and cross-functional teams. While the Project Head supervises all the tasks in the former, the latter has no team leader – the entire team is responsible for the project. In Agile, there is regular collaboration and one-on-one interactions between the members of all teams, cross-functional teams, and customers. In the Scrum framework, the Product Owner, the Scrum Master, and the Scrum Team engage in daily meetings. The Agile approach may require lots of up-front changes in the organizational and development process. This is not necessary for Scrum. In the Agile method, frequent deliveries are made to the customer for obtaining their feedback. In Scrum, each sprint is followed by the delivery of a build to the client for feedback. The Agile method considers customer feedback highly necessary during the process, whereas in Scrum, daily sprint meetings are held for reviews and feedback. While the Agile approach encourages to keep the design and execution simple, Scrum encourages innovation and experimentation for the same. The Agile approach considers customer satisfaction as the top priority, whereas, for Scrum, Empirical Process Control forms the core. While working software forms the fundamental measure for project progress, it is not so in the case of the Scrum framework. These are the key differences between the Agile software development methodology and the Scrum framework. Differences aside, Scrum is essentially a subset of the Agile approach, and hence, the end goal of both is to maximize customer satisfaction through the delivery of value-oriented business products.

Under DevOps, the development and operations teams work together right from the development stage to deployment, testing, operations, and maintenance. Sometimes, the security and quality assurance teams also become integrated with the DevOps team. The team then uses technology and tools that help to get the work done faster because outside help is not taken or needed. Check out our free courses to get an edge over the competition.
