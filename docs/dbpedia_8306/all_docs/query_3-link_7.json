This is utility to get fast parallel multi-algorithmic textual patterns highlighting. It provides cli UI, works as filter console tool and uses json format of prot\n\nAudience\n\nInformation Technology, Science/Research, Developers, Architects\n\nUser interface\n\nCommand-line\n\nProgramming Language\n\nPython, C++, C, PHP\n\nCategories\n\nNetworking\n\nThis is an application that can also be fetched from https://sourceforge.net/projects/hcengine/. It has been hosted in OnWorks in order to be run online in an easiest way from one of our free Operative Systems."
