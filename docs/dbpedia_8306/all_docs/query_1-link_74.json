        "text": "Migration guide: MySQL to SQL Server\n\nApplies to: SQL Server\n\nIn this guide, you learn how to migrate your MySQL databases to SQL Server.\n\nFor other migration guides, see Azure Database Migration Guides.\n\nPrerequisites\n\nBefore you begin migrating your MySQL database to SQL Server:\n\nVerify that your source environment is supported. Currently, MySQL 5.6 and 5.7 are supported.\n\nGet SQL Server Migration Assistant for MySQL (SSMA for MySQL).\n\nGet connectivity and sufficient permissions to access both the source and target.\n\nPre-migration\n\nAfter you meet the prerequisites, you're ready to discover your source MySQL environment and assess the feasibility of your migration.\n\nAssess\n\nBy using SSMA for MySQL, you can review database objects and data and assess databases for migration.\n\nTo create an assessment:\n\nOpen SSMA for MySQL.\n\nOn the File menu, select New Project.\n\nEnter the project name and a location to save your project and the migration target. Then select SQL Server in the Migrate To option.\n\nIn the Connect to MySQL dialog box, enter connection details, and then connect to your MySQL server.\n\nSelect the MySQL databases you want to migrate.\n\nRight-click the MySQL database in MySQL Metadata Explorer, and select Create Report. Alternatively, you can select the Create Report tab in the upper-right corner.\n\nReview the HTML report to understand conversion statistics and any errors or warnings. You can also open the report in Excel to get an inventory of MySQL objects and the effort required to perform schema conversions. The default location for the report is in the report folder within SSMAProjects, as shown here:\n\ndrive:\\Users\\<username>\\Documents\\SSMAProjects\\MySQLMigration\\report\\report_2016_11_12T02_47_55\\.\n\nValidate the default data type mappings and change them based on requirements, if necessary. To do so:\n\nOn the Tools menu, select Project Settings.\n\nSelect the Type Mapping tab.\n\nYou can change the type mapping for each table by selecting the table in MySQL Metadata Explorer.\n\nTo learn more about conversion settings in SSMA for MySQL, see Project Settings (Conversion) (MySQLToSQL).\n\nConvert the schema\n\nConverting database objects takes the object definitions from MySQL, converts them to similar SQL Server objects, and then loads this information into the SSMA for MySQL metadata. It doesn't load the information into the instance of SQL Server. You can then view the objects and their properties by using SQL Server Metadata Explorer.\n\nDuring the conversion, SSMA for MySQL prints output messages to the output pane and error messages to the Error List pane. Use the output and error information to determine whether you have to modify your MySQL databases or your conversion process to obtain the desired conversion results.\n\nTo convert the schema:\n\n(Optional) To convert dynamic or ad hoc queries, right-click the node and select Add Statement.\n\nSelect the Connect to SQL Server tab.\n\nEnter connection details for your SQL Server instance.\n\nSelect your target database from the dropdown list, or enter a new name, in which case a database will be created on the target server.\n\nEnter authentication details, and then select Connect.\n\nRight-click the MySQL database in MySQL Metadata Explorer, and then select Convert Schema. Alternatively, you can select the Convert Schema tab in upper-right corner.\n\nAfter the conversion finishes, compare and review the converted objects to the original objects to identify potential problems and address them based on the recommendations.\n\nCompare the converted Transact-SQL text to the original code, and review the recommendations.\n\nIn the output pane, select Review results and review the errors in the Error List pane.\n\nSave the project locally for an offline schema remediation exercise. On the File menu, select Save Project. This step gives you an opportunity to evaluate the source and target schemas offline and perform remediation before you publish the schema to SQL Server.\n\nTo learn more, see Convert MySQL Databases (MySQLToSQL).\n\nMigration\n\nAfter you have the necessary prerequisites in place and have completed the tasks associated with the pre-migration stage, you're ready to perform the schema and data migration.\n\nYou have two options for migrating data:\n\nClient-side data migration\n\nTo perform client-side data migration, select the Client Side Data Migration Engine option in the Project Settings dialog box.\n\nNote\n\nWhen SQL Express edition is used as the target database, only client-side data migration is allowed and server-side data migration isn't supported.\n\nServer-side data migration\n\nBefore you perform data migration on the server side, ensure that:\n\nThe SSMA for MySQL Extension Pack is installed on the instance of SQL Server.\n\nThe SQL Server Agent service is running on the instance of SQL Server.\n\nTo perform server-side data migration, select the Server Side Data Migration Engine option in the Project Settings dialog box.\n\nTo publish your schema and migrate the data:\n\nPublish the schema by right-clicking the database in SQL Server Metadata Explorer and selecting Synchronize with Database. This action publishes the MySQL database to the SQL Server instance.\n\nReview the mapping between your source project and your target.\n\nMigrate the data by right-clicking the database or object you want to migrate in MySQL Metadata Explorer and selecting Migrate Data. Alternatively, you can select the Migrate Data tab. To migrate data for an entire database, select the check box next to the database name. To migrate data from individual tables, expand the database, expand Tables, and then select the check boxes next to the tables. To omit data from individual tables, clear the check boxes.\n\nAfter migration is completed, view the Data Migration Report.\n\nConnect to your SQL Server instance by using SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS), and validate the migration by reviewing the data and schema.\n\nPost-migration\n\nAfter you've successfully completed the migration stage, you need to complete a series of post-migration tasks to ensure that everything is functioning as smoothly and efficiently as possible.\n\nRemediate applications\n\nAfter you've migrated the data to the target environment, all the applications that formerly consumed the source need to start consuming the target. Accomplishing this task will require changes to the applications in some cases.\n\nPerform tests\n\nThe test approach for database migration consists of the following activities:\n\nDevelop validation tests: To test database migration, you need to use SQL queries. You must create the validation queries to run against both the source and the target databases. Your validation queries should cover the scope you've defined.\n\nSet up a test environment: The test environment should contain a copy of the source database and the target database. Be sure to isolate the test environment.\n\nRun validation tests: Run validation tests against the source and the target, and then analyze the results.\n\nRun performance tests: Run performance tests against the source and the target, and then analyze and compare the results.\n\nOptimize\n\nThe post-migration phase is crucial for reconciling any data accuracy issues, verifying completeness, and addressing performance issues with the workload.\n\nMigration assets\n\nFor more assistance with completing this migration scenario, see the following resource. It was developed in support of a real-world migration project engagement.\n\nTitle Description Data Workload Assessment Model and Tool This tool provides suggested \"best fit\" target platforms, cloud readiness, and application or database remediation level for a given workload. It offers easy calculation and report generation that helps to accelerate large estate assessments by providing an automated and uniform target platform decision process. MySQL to SQL Server - Database Compare utility The Database Compare utility is a Windows console application that you can use to verify that the data is identical both on source and target platforms. You can use the tool to efficiently compare data down to the row or column level in all or selected tables, rows, and columns.\n\nThe Data SQL Engineering team developed these resources. This team's core charter is to unblock and accelerate complex modernization for data platform migration projects to Microsoft's Azure data platform."
