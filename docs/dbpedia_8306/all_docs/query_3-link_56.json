        "text": "Is there a simple place to start learning about mapping clusters and/or hotspots?\n\nI have national datasets of points for each type of business (eg communication, education etc). For each type of business i would like to highlight areas of high concentrations of them...ie areas where we can put new stores for each of these industry types to service them.\n\nI have been looking through 'The ESRI Guide to GIS Analysis volume 2: spatial measurements & statistics' which is great, but NOTHING tells me HOW TO DO IT. i see loads of images that i would like to create, but nothing telling me what tool to use or how to use it.\n\nFor example on page 152 they show nearest neghbor hierarchical clustering...looks good, just no idea where to start. I can't find any tool called 'nearest neighbour hierarchy clusting'.\n\nI can't find anything on the ESRI site (including resources) to help me either. any links would be appreciated. I'm not a statistician so need simplicity if at all possible.\n\nany ideas?\n\nthanks for any help\n\nPaula\n\nHi Paula,\n\nIt's great to hear that you are interested in learning more about some of the spatial statistics tools in ArcGIS! We have a ton of resources that I think will be very helpful to you as you start learning about the tools and how they can help you analyze your data. To start with, it sounds like Hot Spot Analysis should work really well for the questions that you are trying to answer, as well as some other spatial statistics tools. We have all of our resources listed at http://bit.ly/spatialstats, including tutorials, short videos, hour-long free training seminars, and a lot more. The Hot Spot Analysis Tutorial and the Spatial Pattern Analysis Tutorial will be great places for you to start. They come with data, and walk you step-by-step through the analysis process.\n\nAs far as Hierarchical Nearest Neighbor clustering, ArcGIS doesnï¿½??t have that tool (we found results are very dependent on the first cluster found). I think Hot Spot Analysis will provide you with the results that you are looking for. However, if you feel that Hierarchical Clustering is an important solution to your problem, you may want to check out CrimeStat, which does include it in their package.\n\nHope this helps!\n\nLauren Rosenshein\n\nGeoprocessing Product Engineer\n\nHi Lauren,\n\nThanks for the help, i've been learning heaps and the videos are great. Just one thing I can't find.\n\nIn the Performing Proper Density Analysis video you talk about your aggreation model. I think this is exactly what i need to do to get a count. I have been hunting on the site for the tutorial you mention that takes you step by step through creating these aggregated points, but I can't find it anywhere.\n\nPlease could you send me the link for it?\n\nI have worked out how to integrate (i'm using the average value obtained by calculating the distance band from neighbor count and it seems to look ok. Just not sure about the rest of the model.\n\nthanks\n\nPaula"
