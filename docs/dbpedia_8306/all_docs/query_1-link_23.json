        "text": "Principal Findings\n\nWe identified 63 studies that applied cluster analysis to multimodal clinical data to identify subtypes of asthma. We explored the clustering methodologies and their limitations in detail. The principal finding of this review was that the majority of the reviewed studies have flaws in the application of cluster analysis. Although some of these flaws were related to the multimodal nature of the clinical data, they extended to aspects of cluster analysis, which are agnostic of data type, such as sample size, stability, and reporting of the results.\n\nThese findings build on a previous review, which identified limitations such as lack of robustness in feature selection and neglect to specify distance measures in studies using cluster analysis to contribute to our understanding of the spectrum of asthma syndrome [11]. Our review investigated the methods of feature engineering more generally and identified not only neglect to specify dissimilarity measures but also instances in which the dissimilarity measure was inappropriate for the data to which it was applied. In addition, we identified issues related to sample size, cluster analysis methods, choosing the number of clusters, and testing the stability and quality of results. These issues are discussed in the following paragraphs.\n\nA widespread limitation in the reviewed studies was the small sample size. Studies had overall sample sizes as small as 40 patients, with clusters as small as 6 patients. We argue that there is limited utility in clustering data with such small sample sizes: they may result in clusters that are unstable [64] and may therefore lead to selecting fewer clusters than are present in the underlying population from which the data are sampled.\n\nIn the following paragraphs, we discussed the limitations of 3 of the feature selection approaches applied by the reviewed studies. The first approach was to avoid collinearity or multicollinearity or excluding features that were considered to be clinically redundant. Although one should avoid including features that are redundant (can be completely deduced from a combination of the other cluster features), this is rarely the case. Therefore, removing features inevitably leads to loss of information. We suggest that the removal of features based on redundancy needs to be carefully considered, for example, 2 or more features (some of which may appear univariately redundant) may jointly contribute toward determining a cluster (or similarly toward the estimation of a clinical outcome in a standard supervised learning setup).\n\nThe second was the use of PCA or factor analysis to select features, which has a similar motivation to the concept described earlier for discarding statistically correlated features. There are methodological justifications for the use of PCA, factor analysis, or other nonlinear embedding methods for feature transformation [19]. They aim to jointly combine the original features and project them in a new feature space, which may have some useful properties, including interpretation, determining latent feature structure, and improving the clustering or statistical mapping outcomes [16]. However, we suggest exercising caution toward using these methods for feature selection as described in some of the studies summarized in the Results section of this review because they were fundamentally developed toward different aims. Haldar et al used PCA for feature selection in the first publication to apply cluster analysis to identify asthma subtypes [14]. It is possible that other studies used this as a point of reference for these methods, leading to the common application of these methods in the field of asthma subtyping.\n\nThe third approach to feature selection was the use of statistical hypothesis tests with respect to outcomes of interest, as done in 2 studies [42,43]. Methods in which an outcome of interest is used to guide feature selection in cluster analysis have been described previously [65,66]. Although these approaches may be useful for situations in which there exists an outcome of particular interest to the clustering problem, the user should be aware of and acknowledge the assumptions made in the process. In the context of the 2 reviewed studies that used this approach, Sakagami et al did not acknowledge the linearity assumption in linear regression [42], whereas Seino et al’s method does not account for potentially highly correlated features [43], a concept that is key in feature selection for cluster analysis.\n\nFeature transformation was applied in only 6 studies, and the methods were generally poorly reported. As with cluster analysis, feature encoding and scaling are important considerations in feature transformation, but none of the studies gave adequate details in their methods. The results of feature transformation were also poorly reported. Although the key reason for applying feature transformation methods is to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset, only 2 [31,45] of the 6 studies provided details on the number of features retained. We suggest that the results of PCA, factor analysis, or MCA should include a table of component (or factor) loadings, the number of features retained, and the proportion of variance accounted for in the transformed features.\n\nMost studies explicitly stated the clustering method that they used but were less explicit regarding the preprocessing steps and choice of dissimilarity measure. Hastie et al [16] state, “Specifying an appropriate dissimilarity measure is far more important in obtaining success with clustering than choice of clustering algorithm.”\n\nWe expand on this statement, further adding that preprocessing steps such as feature scaling and feature encoding are also more important in obtaining success than the choice clustering algorithm. This is in line with the conclusions of Prosperi et al, who demonstrated that clustering using different feature sets and encodings in asthma datasets can lead to different cluster solutions [29]. Both preprocessing steps and dissimilarity measures, along with their relation to clustering algorithms, have been given poor consideration in clustering applications in asthma, as discussed in the following 3 paragraphs.\n\nFirst, the Euclidean distance was used with mixed-type data in over half of the studies (54%). Although the Euclidean distance is intended for use with continuous data, problems associated with applying it to mixed-type data may be mitigated by carefully considering feature scaling and feature encoding. However, in our review, we found that many studies did not specify their methods for rescaling, and many studies included ordinal and nominal categorical features but did not specify how these would be treated when calculating the Euclidean distances. The lack of consideration of feature scaling and encoding in these cases may have resulted in assigning an unintended weight structure to the cluster features.\n\nSecond, 4 studies used Gower coefficient in hierarchical clustering with Ward linkage [36,67-69], and 1 used tree-based distances [49,70]. These studies should be given some credit for using dissimilarities that can handle mixed-type data. However, the application of hierarchical clustering with Ward linkage relies on the properties of the Euclidean distance in the computations. These properties do not hold for Gower coefficient, and hence, errors are perpetuated at each level of the hierarchy. An example that demonstrates this issue is given in Multimedia Appendix 5.\n\nA final point in the use of k-means and hierarchical clustering using the Ward method with mixed cluster features is that the theory underpinning these methods involves the calculation of cluster means. The mean is not an appropriate summary statistic for categorical features, which are more typically summarized by the mode. For this reason, we suggest that k-medoids may be a more appropriate method for mixed-type features used in clustering. Instead of computing each cluster’s mean (as with hierarchical clustering using Ward’s method and k-means), k-medoids compute each cluster’s medoid, defined as the sample in the cluster for which the average dissimilarity to all other samples in the cluster is minimized [55]. In addition, k-medoids do not rely on the properties of the Euclidean distance in the computations, thus avoiding the issue described in the previous paragraph. Despite these advantages, only 2 studies in this review used k-medoids [30,56].\n\nThe SPSS TwoStep method was used in 7 of the 63 studies investigated here. We see 2 key limitations with the application of this method across the reviewed studies. First, none of the studies gave adequate consideration to the distributional assumptions made when using the log-likelihood distance, and most did not mention the assumptions at all. Second, this method is designed for clustering several millions of samples with many features within an acceptable time and makes a key compromise in doing so [52]. This compromise is that the data are not stored in the main memory but are read sequentially, hence making the solution sensitive to the ordering of the data. None of the studies acknowledged this inherent shortcoming, nor did they confirm that their data were in a random order. Perhaps, more concerningly, the studies that applied these methods actually had very small datasets (range 84-349 samples) that could easily be stored, therefore making other standard techniques more appropriate. In our view, this compromise was therefore unnecessary.\n\nOnly 1 study [57] used a method that obtains a fuzzy cluster solution (in which a patient may be assigned a membership value to multiple clusters), as opposed to a hard cluster solution (in which each patient is assigned to a single cluster) [23]. A fuzzy cluster solution can indicate where a patient membership value is similar across multiple clusters, whereas this information is lost (or leads to lack of stability) in a hard cluster solution. Owing to the noisy nature of clinical data and the clinical complexity of grouping patients into distinct groups, we suggest that fuzzy cluster solutions may be more appropriate than hard cluster solutions in the review applications in asthma. However, it is important to acknowledge that there are added challenges in the interpretation and communication of fuzzy cluster solutions and that the methods may be more computationally intensive [71].\n\nSelecting the number of clusters can be challenging and depends largely on the context of the application. In the case of the reviewed applications in asthma, the true number of clusters is unknown, and the analyses are exploratory. Although 86% of the review studies gave some details regarding their methods for choosing the number of clusters (k), they were generally poorly reported. The most popular approach was the dendrogram, but only Labor et al [72] specified their criteria for cutting the dendrogram. In 14 studies, the dendrogram was the only method mentioned. We suggest that more than one method should be used to select the number of clusters to validate this decision.\n\nOur review shows that studies rarely tested the stability and quality of their results, with a particular lack of emphasis on stability. This is concerning, as many studies use methods such as k-means, which reach local minima, and apply them to small sample sizes, thus increasing the risk of obtaining unstable results. We argue that because of the unsupervised nature of cluster analysis, testing the stability and quality of the results should be a key theme and would like to urge researchers and peer reviewers in this research field to carefully consider these aspects. However, we do appreciate that assessing the stability and quality of a solution in the absence of ground truth is challenging and that there are currently no well-established frameworks for doing so [27].\n\nAlthough this review focused on applications in subtyping asthma, the identified issues have been found in studies using cluster analysis to subtype other diseases. For example, recent studies in autism [73] and hypersomnolence [74] have applied cluster analysis to very small samples (55 and 17 patients, respectively). A recent study on Parkinson disease [75] stated in the main text that a model-based cluster analysis method was used, whereas the supplementary materials revealed that the method was in fact k-means, which is not model-based. In addition, supplementary materials listed 3 methods for choosing the number of clusters (CCC, pseudo-F, and R-squared statistics) but did not present the results from these 3 methods anywhere in the main text or supplementary materials. These findings demonstrate the widespread nature of the issues that this review has highlighted, and that the issues are not restricted to asthma-related studies."
