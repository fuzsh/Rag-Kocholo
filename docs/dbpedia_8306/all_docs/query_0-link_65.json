        "text": "Sr Engineer creating example code and applications using the AWS SDK for Rust (example repo). Primary duties are writing informative code samples for all aspects of the Rust SDK. Longer-term projects develop cross-service scenarios to emphasize SDK utilities across the SDK language and service boundaries. These examples show customers real-world approaches to developing software that combines multiple AWS SDKs.\n\nHighlights include:\n\na REST system using Amazon RDS Data & Amazon SES\n\na photo asset manager using Amazon S3 intelligent tiering storage, Amazon Rekognition image tagging, & Amazon SQS notifications\n\nan ML Ops pipeline using AWS Step Functions to orchestrate Amazon Textract, Amazon Comprehend, and Amazon Polly\n\na multi-language Coupon Newsletter using Amazon Simple Email Service.\n\nUtilized Ailly & Bedrock to develop bespoke human-navigator LLM workflow for Code Examples team, speeding development by 20%.\n\nI am the tech lead for the AWS SDK Code Examples Tooling group, who create and maintain Continuous Integration, Continuous Delivery, and Product Excellence tooling for AWS Code Examples. This tooling enforces quality standards on first-part example code for the docs.aws.amazon.com property, and requires coordination across engineering, writing, editing, and product teams spanning AWS technology and marketing.\n\nLead instructor for Code 401: Advanced Software Development in Full Stack JavaScript. Educational duties include online classroom instruction, career coaching, curriculum development, and student evaluation. Students consistently ranked my courses at 100 net promoter score, both on weekly survey and course final evaluations. Organized & lead an instructor-wide project revamping the school's white-boarding process. This project rewrote the white-boarding guide, formalized a rubric for grading whiteboards & tech interviews, and revamped problem & training materials for a dozen instructors across four languages. Code Fellows was ranked as a 2023 top coding boot camp by Fortune Education.\n\nAs a tech lead, I set strategic direction for our feature area as well as mentoring and guiding my team in their engineering and career. I Lead a team of 10 (4 direct) migrating cloud management tool from AngularJS to Angular. During the migration, I organized additional feature work to maintain market parity and leadership during the migration.\n\nAs a manager, I developed junior and Noogler engineers in Cloud, Angular, and TypeScript. I successfully promoted an L4 Noogler to L5 in three performance review cycles and an L3 Googler to L4 during the second cycle as manager, and guided an L3 who received an NI through a PIP who was then promoted to L4 two cycles after departure. I achieved this through managing and mentoring junior engineers, writing performance reviews and promotion packets, and coordinating task priority and HR concerns.\n\nAs a guest lecturer at Chatham University in Pittsburgh, PA, I taught an undergraduate business course on the effects of technology in the 21st century. The course served as an overview of technological topics and their intersection with business ethics. Students learned how technology can be used to handle everyday business needs, while also exploring the implications of big data, always-on-connectivity, and how many engineering tools have an effect on their day to day lives in ways that are almost always unseen.\n\nFront End Engineer with Channel Intelligence. I lead development on a user interface to manage product-level experiments for shopping data. Architect of the core platform & tooling. I taught internal courses on TypeScript & Angular, with my teams building over a dozen screens. Includes complex workflows to manage creating nuanced experimental hypotheses, treatments, and groupings. In prior quarters, I contributed to an effort across several working groups to migrate from existing GWT web UIs to modern, component-base Angular architectures. I brought a strong emphasis to Test Driven Develpment in our FE environment, including techniques, best practices, and general cheer leading. I worked with several groups to offer, and personally taught, several collegiate courses including a two-week intensive course on TDD & industry practices at Mt Holyoke College.\n\nTEALS pairs computer science professionals with an in-classroom high school teacher to augment a school's technical literacy program offerings. In this role, I served as a lecturer and TA for several high school classes in NYC and Pittsburgh. Classes included intro to programming with Scratch, intro to programming with Python, and AP Computer Science in Java. Beyond teaching and running labs, I wrote several utilities for students to have a \"Python Scavenger Hunt\", needing to upload programs to solve simple python challenges. Think Leet Code for Kids.\n\nOwner and Founder, Third Cat LLC. A consulting firm specializing in Javascript technologies, including Node.js backend and AngularJS frontend solutions. Clients include Data Online, a manufacturing firm in New Jersey, where we architected and built a scalable, real-time monitoring platform for various client consumables, and trained the team in building Single Page Applications (SPAs) with AngularJS. We provide ongoing on-site training for new developers on the MEAN stack platform. Projects include work with DartmouthX, providing visualizations for an online engineering course. Long term engagements also include work with ProTech, a leading provider of IT training solutions, as a Javascript and Web Development trainer.\n\nAs head of Front End Development at Novus Partners, I lead a team of four developers in a complete front-end rewrite. Our previous platform was a brittle Scala Server Pages implementation. After releasing this rewrite, our slick & fast AngularJS frontend has become decoupled from the Scala backend, allowing both services to become much more focused and performant. We also build and maintain the NVD3 open-source charting library. I have led an ongoing effort to refactor the original prototype codebase into a maintainable, extensible, and testable library that will serve front-end charting for years to come.\n\nFull-stack developer of the NYT5 rebuild team, rebuilding the nytimes.com property from the ground up. The core online presence of the New York Times handles 45 million unique monthly visitors in 2012. Core member of the Prorotype team, building and testing potential new features for the proto.nytimes.com domain. Responsible for the backend stack, including Node servers for data management and AB testing, as well as a variety of systems administration to handle our traffic. Invited to speak on emerging technologies to internal development groups, as well as on behalf of the Times at regional college tech events and tech meetups. Internal git guru.\n\nSynapse is a tool in the Government Open Source Software realm designed to bring large-scale data handling and visualization to the browser. Our technology handles tens to hundreds of thousands of records shared between discreet OWF widgets, small iframe applications in a shared web desktop. These widgets provide a range of visualizations and tools for intelligence analysts to make the most use of the disparate data sources streaming in from the modern threat space, enabling them to make decisions that save lives of both military troops and civilians around the world.\n\nResponsible for the entire technology stack at a start-up software development company. Accomplishments include developing several platforms to facilitate web programing, implementing a continuous integration server across several languages and frameworks, and architecting several medium-scale projects with a team of five developers and designers.\n\nOur largest project was a field agent tracking system, responsible for maintaining scheduling and routing information for hundreds of in-store field marketing agents in Australia. The project combined a variety of technologies, including a scalable PHP backend, dynamic mobile frontend, and extensive reporting capabilities.\n\nIn the course of the project, we developed JEFRi, a Javascript Entity Framework to facilitate our mobile development work."
