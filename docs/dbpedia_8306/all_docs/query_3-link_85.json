        "text": "As the name suggests, unsupervised learning uses self-learning algorithms—they learn without any labels or prior training. Instead, the model is given raw, unlabeled data and has to infer its own rules and structure the information based on similarities, differences, and patterns without explicit instructions on how to work with each piece of data.\n\nUnsupervised learning algorithms are better suited for more complex processing tasks, such as organizing large datasets into clusters. They are useful for identifying previously undetected patterns in data and can help identify features useful for categorizing data.\n\nImagine that you have a large dataset about weather. An unsupervised learning algorithm will go through the data and identify patterns in the data points. For instance, it might group data by temperature or similar weather patterns.\n\nWhile the algorithm itself does not understand these patterns based on any previous information you provided, you can then go through the data groupings and attempt to classify them based on your understanding of the dataset. For instance, you might recognize that the different temperature groups represent all four seasons or that the weather patterns are separated into different types of weather, such as rain, sleet, or snow.\n\nClustering is a technique for exploring raw, unlabeled data and breaking it down into groups (or clusters) based on similarities or differences. It is used in a variety of applications, including customer segmentation, fraud detection, and image analysis. Clustering algorithms split data into natural groups by finding similar structures or patterns in uncategorized data.\n\nClustering is one of the most popular unsupervised machine learning approaches. There are several types of unsupervised learning algorithms that are used for clustering, which include exclusive, overlapping, hierarchical, and probabilistic.\n\nExclusive clustering: Data is grouped in a way where a single data point can only exist in one cluster. This is also referred to as “hard” clustering. A common example of exclusive clustering is the K-means clustering algorithm, which partitions data points into a user-defined number K of clusters.\n\nOverlapping clustering: Data is grouped in a way where a single data point can exist in two or more clusters with different degrees of membership. This is also referred to as “soft” clustering.\n\nHierarchical clustering: Data is divided into distinct clusters based on similarities, which are then repeatedly merged and organized based on their hierarchical relationships. There are two main types of hierarchical clustering: agglomerative and divisive clustering. This method is also referred to as HAC—hierarchical cluster analysis.\n\nProbabilistic clustering: Data is grouped into clusters based on the probability of each data point belonging to each cluster. This approach differs from the other methods, which group data points based on their similarities to others in a cluster.\n\nAssociation rule mining is a rule-based approach to reveal interesting relationships between data points in large datasets. Unsupervised learning algorithms search for frequent if-then associations—also called rules—to discover correlations and co-occurrences within the data and the different connections between data objects.\n\nIt is most commonly used to analyze retail baskets or transactional datasets to represent how often certain items are purchased together. These algorithms uncover customer purchasing patterns and previously hidden relationships between products that help inform recommendation engines or other cross-selling opportunities. You might be most familiar with these rules from the “Frequently bought together” and “People who bought this item also bought” sections on your favorite online retail shop.\n\nAssociation rules are also often used to organize medical datasets for clinical diagnoses. Using unsupervised machine learning and association rules can help doctors identify the probability of a specific diagnosis by comparing relationships between symptoms from past patient cases.\n\nTypically, Apriori algorithms are the most widely used for association rule learning to identify related collections of items or sets of items. However, other types are used, such as Eclat and FP-growth algorithms.\n\nDimensionality reduction is an unsupervised learning technique that reduces the number of features, or dimensions, in a dataset. More data is generally better for machine learning, but it can also make it more challenging to visualize the data.\n\nDimensionality reduction extracts important features from the dataset, reducing the number of irrelevant or random features present. This method uses principle component analysis (PCA) and singular value decomposition (SVD) algorithms to reduce the number of data inputs without compromising the integrity of the properties in the original data."
