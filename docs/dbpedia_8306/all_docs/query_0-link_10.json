        "text": "In the recent era, 79% of the websites designed across the web utilise PHP as a server-side programming language because it has excellent functionalities, features, availability, scope, dynamics, etc. As a result, most enterprises choose PHP for web application development. However, before discussing further why using PHP is best for web app development, we need to know what a web application is?\n\nWhat is Web Application:\n\nThe online application that can be executed on any browser or any device is a web application. It is similar to a computer program which performs a particular operation by utilising a web browser and the one that runs on a remote server. A few of the instances of the web applications are content management systems (CMS), video streaming websites, online photo editing tools, and project management systems.\n\nWeb Application Features:\n\nThe web app is different from other apps, which don’t require an installation. A web application development company uses client-side scripting languages like HTML and JavaScript and server-side programming languages like PHP.\n\nThe client-side scripts will display the information in an easy way to the user, whereas the server-side scripts stores and retrieve the data. Here are the features which a modern web application has to possess\n\nSmart and robust support.\n\nSecurity and scalability.\n\nInteroperability.\n\nHigh performance.\n\nIntuitive user interface.\n\nComplete portability.\n\nCross-platform operability and\n\nEvent-driven approach\n\nThere are many reasons to use PHP for web application development. But before going into depth, let’s discuss what PHP is?\n\nWhat is PHP?\n\nOnce PHP was called Personal Home Page Tools, it is now called Hypertext Preprocessor. It is an HTML-embedded scripting and open-source language used to write server-side programs. It joins HTML documents and the power of Common Gateway Interface(CGI) scripting to allow the PHP developer to make websites, web apps, and dynamic web pages. PHP server is used by Magento, Joomla, Drupal, WordPress etc. Big platforms like Vimeo, Facebook, Flickr, and Yahoo use PHP app development.\n\nYou can even run PHP web applications on several operating systems like Windows, MacOS, Linux etc. The developers have complete freedom to pick a web server and operating system while an application is being developed. PHP supports web servers like Sun Java System, Jigsaw Server, Internet Information Services(IIS), and Apache. It doesn’t matter if you choose procedural or object-oriented programming, as PHP supports both programming styles.\n\nIt consists of an extensive library for parsing, regular expressions, data fetching, and database drivers. You can execute PHP codes or scripts efficiently. It also supports devices like Redis, Memcached, and APC that are utilised to cache PHP codes and store them in the server. It will allow loading quickly on the web. Its cluster mechanism will provide fault tolerance, meaning one part's failure will not affect the other part of the chain. It also offers development flexibility designed for supporting Facebook’s HipHop Virtual Machine(HHVM).\n\nReasons to Choose PHP for Web App development.\n\nHere, we will discuss the reasons for choosing PHP for web development.\n\n1. User Friendly :\n\nMost web developers' first and favourite choice is PHP, which is easier to use. It is well organised and clear, unlike other traditional programming languages. You don’t need any study material or a guide to learn about PHP development. Even an amateur can also understand PHP command functions. It’s not tough to do coding using PHP as it is similar to the C language. Individuals who know the C language can code in PHP with ease.\n\n2. Open-Source :\n\nPHP is an open-source programming language. It is open to anyone, and you can utilise it anytime and anywhere. Moreover, you will get control over the code while using PHP, which can help you customise the products in whatever you wish.\n\n3. Less Vulnerable :\n\nPHP possesses distinct built-in features which safeguard your website from various security threats. Many believe that open source means insecurity, but this language is free from those thinking. The developers of PHP can easily detect common issues like SQL injections and data tampering.\n\n4. Performance :\n\nCompared with other programming languages, PHP scripts execute with great speed with independent benchmarks that make it compete with other options like JSP, Pearl, and ASP.Net. A third-party accelerator is also present for enhancing response time and additional performance.\n\n5. Effortless Connection of Database :\n\nMost e-commerce websites require a large database management system(DBMS). PHP is the only programming language with a built-in module that simplifies the entire procedure. It is why many web development companies are choosing PHP for web app development. PHP also helps in reducing the time needed for website development along with the best DBMS.\n\n6. Highly Scalable :\n\nIt is an incredibly flexible programming language. Developers feel annoyed editing the scripting language while completing a project or during an ongoing project. But PHP has unique features to alter the script at any time. It is why the programmers do not need to rewrite the command function or code. It will let you spare so much of your time.\n\nNow, it is better to know about PHP frameworks which can help the developers create website applications. But let's learn what the PHP framework is?\n\nPHP Framework:\n\nIt is the framework which enables you to create web applications. It consists of many libraries with pre-packaged classes, methods, and tools for implementing software design patterns. It supports many databases and offers designers and developers to export different graphic files and text.\n\nAdvantages of using PHP Framework for Web App Development?\n\nHere are the advantages of using a PHP framework.\n\n1. Less code to write:\n\nPHP frameworks have built-in functionalities that you don’t need to create as much as the original code.\n\n2. Use proper techniques of coding:\n\nMost PHP frameworks stick to the best practices of coding. They allow you to structure your code in a maintainable, logical, and tidy way. They also define entity name standards that need to be followed by the developer during web app development.\n\n3. High Rapid Development:\n\nThey offer built-in tools and libraries and reduce the development time. A PHPUnit library is incorporated in all the prominent PHP frameworks for performing testing simply.\n\n4. Task-Related Libraries:\n\nWeb app developers need to maintain standards while offering PHP web application development services.Some examples are data sanitisation, CRUD(Create, Read, Update, and Delete) operations, and form validation. Besides writing about your operations for these tasks, you can also use the ones included in the respective PHP framework.\n\n5. A Safer Place to Develop Your Applications:\n\nThe security risks of PHP are SQL injection attacks, cross-site petition forgery, and cross-site scripting. Your web applications of PHP are susceptible unless you take preventive measures to protect your written code. When you utilise a PHP framework, it will reduce hacker attack risk.\n\nBest PHP Frameworks to use for Web App Development\n\nHere are the best PHP frameworks you can use during web application development. They are:\n\n1. Laravel\n\nIt is the prominent free and open-source PHP framework that was introduced in 2011.
