        "text": "Real-life Applications of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)\n\nLast Updated : 31 Jul, 2024\n\nImprove\n\nYou may have heard that DSA is primarily used in the field of computer science. Although DSA is most commonly used in the computing field, its application is not restricted to it. The concept of DSA can also be found in everyday life. Here we’ll address the common concept of DSA that we use in our day-to-day lives.\n\nApplication of Data Structure:\n\nA data structure is a particular way of organizing data in a computer so that it can be used effectively. The real-life applications of all the data structures are discussed below.\n\nApplication of Arrays:\n\nArrays are the simplest data structures that store items of the same data type. A basic application of Arrays can be storing data in tabular format. For example, if we wish to store the contacts on our phone, then the software will simply place all our contacts in an array.\n\nSome other applications of the arrays are:\n\nArrangement of the leader board of a game can be done simply through arrays to store the score and arrange them in descending order to clearly make out the rank of each player in the game.\n\nA simple question Paper is an array of numbered questions with each of them assigned some marks.\n\n2D arrays, commonly known as, matrices, are used in image processing.\n\nIt is also used in speech processing, in which each speech signal is an array.\n\nYour viewing screen is also a multidimensional array of pixels.\n\nBook titles in a Library Management Systems.\n\nOnline ticket booking.\n\nContacts on a cell phone.\n\nFor CPU scheduling in computer.\n\nTo store the possible moves of chess on a chessboard.\n\nTo store images of a specific size on an android or laptop.\n\nApplication of Strings:\n\nSpam email detection.\n\nPlagiarism detection.\n\nSearch engine.\n\nDigital forensic and information retrieval system\n\nSpell checkers.\n\nIn the database to check valid information of the user\n\nApplication of Matrix:\n\nMatrix is an ordered collection of columns and rows of elements.
