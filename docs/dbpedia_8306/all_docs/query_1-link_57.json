        "text": "Single Answer Variations\n\nThe single answer format allows a respondent to select one, and only one, answer choice. To make your question single answer, enable the Allow one answer option.\n\nIn the survey builder, you’ll notice that single answer questions always have radio buttons (circles). You can change how these buttons appear to your respondents based on the layout you have selected in the Look & Feel menu.\n\nQtip: Although respondents can change their choice on a single-answer question, they can’t uncheck it. To give your respondent the option to uncheck their selected answer, you can use a multiple answer variation and then turn on Make Answer Exclusive for each answer choice.\n\nList Format\n\nThe List format is the default format for multiple choice questions. In this format, answer choices are presented to respondents in a list view.\n\nDropdown\n\nThe Dropdown format displays answer choices as a dropdown list; respondents can only pick one answer choice.\n\nIf you need to edit the choices available, select Click here to edit choices. You will then be able to click choices to edit them.\n\nQtip: Have a long list of choices? No need to type them in one at a time! If you have the list in a spreadsheet, or even in a Word document, you can simply copy the entire list and paste it into the first choice in Qualtrics. Qualtrics will populate the list for you. Make sure the list is formatted so there is one line break in between each choice. Be careful of formatting that may carry over from Word and other rich text editing software – you may need to remove formatting on the question.\n\nSelect Box\n\nThe Select box format displays answer choices in a list respondents can scroll through. Respondents can select only one answer choice.\n\nIf you need to edit the choices available, select Click here to edit choices. You will then be able to click choices to edit them.\n\nSingle Answer Validation & Response Requirements\n\nSingle answer questions have a variety of response requirements you can add to the questions. The Add requirements toggle allows you to add force response or request response validation to your question. The Add validation toggle allows you to add custom validation to your question.\n\nMultiple Answer Variations\n\nThe multiple answer format allows a respondent to select multiple answer choices for a question. You can limit how many choices the respondent is allowed to select by customizing the validation options described at the end of this section. To make your question multiple answer, enable the Allow multiple answers option.\n\nList Format\n\nThe List format is the default format for multiple choice questions. In this format, answer choices are presented to respondents in a list view.\n\nIn the editor, you’ll notice that multiple answer questions always have checkboxes. You can change how these buttons appear to your respondents based on the layout you have selected in the Look & Feel menu.\n\nSelect Box\n\nThe Select Box format displays answer choices in a list respondents can scroll through. Respondents can easily select multiple answer choices through several methods. To select options in a row, they can click and drag their mouse, or hold down Shift when selecting. To select non-sequential options, they can hold down Ctrl (on a PC) or Cmd (on a Mac) when clicking.\n\nIf you need to edit the choices available, select Click here to edit choices. You will then be able to click choices to edit them.\n\nMultiple Answer Validation & Response Requirements\n\nMultiple select questions come with some of the same validation options that singe select questions do, but there are also options that are unique to multiple select questions. There are even a few ways to limit how many answers respondents can select. These options are found in the Response Requirements section of the survey builder.\n\nAdd Requirements:\n\nForce response: Force the respondent to select at least one response before they can proceed.\n\nRequest response: Request that the respondent try to answer the question before they proceed, but give them the option to refuse.\n\nAdd validation:\n\nMinimum choices selected: Require respondents to select a certain number of answers before they can proceed with the rest of the survey. In this case, there is no maximum number of responses, only a minimum.\n\nAnswers Range: Specify a minimum and maximum number of responses the respondent can provide.\n\nCustom Validation: Require respondents to select specific choices before they can proceed. See Custom Validation and Custom Validation Messages."
