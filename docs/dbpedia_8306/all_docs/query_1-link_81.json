        "text": "Consider a switch from a commercial to an open source database. Discover the key differences and similarities between PostgreSQL and SQL Server.\n\nPostgreSQL and SQL Server (or MSSQL) are widely used relational databases. Although they share several core traits, there are significant differences between them. This article provides a detailed rundown of the similarities and differences between PostgreSQL and SQL Server.\n\nAmong the most important distinctions is that PostgreSQL is open source, while SQL Server is owned and licensed by Microsoft. In addition, you will learn about the differences between the two systems regarding licensing and cost, ease of use, SQL syntax and compliance, data types, available features, performance, and security, among over 40 other topics covered in head-to-head comparisons.\n\nIt will benefit organizations thinking of switching from a commercial to an open source database but need more information on the possible trade-offs and advantages of the two systems. However, it is intended for anyone who is curious to learn more about relational databases.\n\nPostgreSQL vs. MSSQL – Server Licensing Models\n\nPostgreSQL\n\nPostgreSQL is an open source database released under the PostgreSQL License, an Open Source Initiative Approved License. The use of PostgreSQL for any purpose, including commercial, is free. Under the PostgreSQL Global Development Group, PostgreSQL is available as free and open source software in perpetuity.\n\nSQL Server\n\nMicrosoft SQL Server is available through a commercial license and can be licensed on a per-core or server and client access level (CAL) model. MSSQL is offered in two main editions, Enterprise Edition and Standard Edition, to meet organizations' and individuals' performance and price requirements. Licensing costs range from $3,586 for the Standard Edition to $13,748 for the Enterprise Edition (for two cores); the server and CAL model run $899 for the server plus $209 per user. A free version is available to students and developers for building and testing.\n\nPostgreSQL vs. MSSQL – Release Updates\n\nPostgreSQL\n\nPostgreSQL was created in 1986 at the University of California, Berkeley, and first released in 1989. It has undergone several significant updates since then, and the project still maintains regular releases under an open source license. The current version of Postgres is version 13, released in October 2019 and has had regular minor releases since then. Previous significant versions are supported for five years after their initial release.\n\nSQL Server\n\nMicrosoft developed SQL Server and first released it in 1989, and new releases occur regularly. The current version, Microsoft SQL Server 2019, was released in November 2019. Previous versions continue to receive support from SQL Server 2012 onward. Recent versions include extended support for 10 years, with an optional premium assurance paid extension for up to 16 years.\n\nPostgreSQL vs. MSSQL – Which Server Is Easier to Use?\n\nPostgreSQL\n\nPostgreSQL is an advanced object-relational database management system that uses Structured Query Language (SQL) and its procedural language, PL/pgSQL. PostgreSQL is easy to use and has a whole stack of RDBMS database features and capabilities for handling data. You can easily install it on Linux environments.\n\nSQL Server\n\nSQL Server is a Relational Database Management System (RDBM) developed and operated by Microsoft. It uses a variant of Structured Query Language (SQL) called T-SQL (for Transact-SQL). It can run on Linux operating systems with Kubernetes support or on Windows. Users describe it as easy to use and reliable, with strong .NET compatibility.\n\nPostgreSQL vs. MSSQL – Server Syntax\n\nPostgreSQL vs. SQL Server Syntax Comparison Table\n\nPostgreSQL vs. MSSQL – Data Types\n\nPostgreSQL vs. SQL Server Data Types Comparison Table\n\nPostgreSQL vs. MSSQL – Geographic Data\n\nPostgreSQL\n\nPostgreSQL does not have a native data type for geographic data. The open source PostGIS resource offers support for geographic objects.\n\nSQL Server\n\nSQL Server has the geography data type for storing geographic spatial data.\n\nPostgreSQL vs. MSSQL – Case Sensitivity\n\nPostgreSQL\n\nPostgreSQL is case-sensitive for evaluating strings. The LOWER() function allows users to convert strings to all lowercase for evaluation purposes (there is also a similar UPPER() function). By default, PostgreSQL converts table and column names to lowercase unless you place those names in quotes. The context module provides a case-insensitive string data type context for comparing values.\n\nSQL Server\n\nSQL Server is case insensitive by default. Adjusting the SQL Server’s collation settings can change the case sensitivity. Set the collation settings for case sensitivity at the database or column level.\n\nPostgreSQL vs. MSSQL – Index Types\n\nPostgreSQL\n\nPostgreSQL offers several options for index types, including B-tree, hash, Generalized Search Tree (GiST), Space Partitioned GiST, Generalized Inverted Index (GIN), and Block Range Index (BRIN). In addition, it supports expression indexes (indexes created with an expression or function rather than a column value) and partial indexes (indexes of part of a table).\n\nSQL Server\n\nSQL Server offers clustered and nonclustered indexes. Clustered indexes sort and store data rows in the table or view based on fundamental values (columns in the index definition). A table can have only one clustered index. Nonclustered indexes are stored separately from table data, and each key value entry has a pointer to the data. MSSQL automatically creates these indexes when you define PRIMARY KEY and UNIQUE constraints on table columns. The UNIQUE constraint creates a nonclustered index, while the PRIMARY KEY creates a clustered index unless one already exists.\n\nPostgreSQL vs. MSSQL – Replication\n\nPostgreSQL\n\nPostgreSQL has Primary-Secondary replication. Replication can be synchronous or asynchronous. Asynchronous replication uses write-ahead logs (WALs) to share changes with the replica nodes. Streaming replication updates standby servers more immediately by streaming the WALs as they are created rather than waiting for the file to be filled.\n\nLogical replication follows a publish and subscribe model, where changes are based on the data's replication identity (a primary key) rather than its physical location, hence the name \"logical replication.\" Physical replication deals with files and directories without regard for the contents within those physical locations. PostgreSQL does not natively offer multi-master replication, but some third-party tools offer multi-master replication solutions.\n\nSQL Server\n\nSQL Server replication duplicates data from a Publisher server to a Subscriber and offers three types of replication:\n\nTransactional replication for server-to-server environments, where changes are delivered from the publisher to the subscriber as they occur.\n\nMerge replication for server-to-client environments or in situations where conflicts might occur, where data can be changed and tracked on either the publisher or subscriber and later synchronized.\n\nSnapshot replication is when data is updated infrequently or does not need to be changed incrementally, where data is duplicated precisely as it appears at a specific moment.\n\nReplication in SQL Server can be a synchronous commit or asynchronous commit. The Enterprise edition offers peer-to-peer replication as an alternative solution to multi-master replication.\n\nPostgreSQL vs. MSSQL – Clustering\n\nPostgreSQL\n\nPostgreSQL allows clusters of servers but does not natively support multi-master or active/active clusters. Tools such as repmgr allow for easy maintenance of PostgreSQL clusters.\n\nSQL Server\n\nSQL Server offers Windows Server Failover Clustering, which can be configured for both active/passive and active/active nodes. The Standard edition only supports two nodes for clusters; additional nodes require an upgrade to the Enterprise edition.\n\nPostgreSQL vs. MSSQL – High Availability\n\nPostgreSQL\n\nPostgreSQL offers several solutions to ensure high availability for users, including shared disk failover, write-ahead log shipping, data partitioning and multiple replication methods. Tools like EDB Postgres Failover Manager provide automatic failover to ensure high availability by monitoring and identifying database failure.\n\nSQL Server\n\nSQL Server includes several high-availability tools in its various editions. These include replication, log shipping, and failover clusters. Its Always On availability groups, offered with the Enterprise edition, provide automatic failover when certain conditions are met.\n\nPostgreSQL vs. MSSQL – “Views”\n\nPostgreSQL\n\nPostgreSQL supports views – virtual tables that do not store data themselves. Updatable views are supported, but updates do not occur automatically unless they meet the following conditions:\n\nThe query of that view must have precisely one section in the FROM clause, which can be a table or another updatable view.\n\nThe selection list must not contain any window function, aggregate function, or set-returning function.\n\nThe query must not contain one of the following clauses at the top level: HAVING, LIMIT, DISTINCT, WITH, INTERSECT, EXCEPT, OFFSET, AND LIMIT.\n\nViews created with simple queries can be updated; ones made with complex queries cannot, but complex views can be updated using rules. Materialized views are also supported and the data in materialized views can be updated using the REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW statement.\n\nSQL Server\n\nSQL Server views can be used to restrict user access to data for security purposes. Both user-defined and system-defined views are supported. Views can be automatically updated using triggers. The data in a view can be updated when the modifications are made to a column from a single underlying base table and are referenced directly. Materialized views are known in SQL Server as Indexed Views; unlike materialized views in other relational databases, indexed views are synched to the underlying data and are thus updated automatically.\n\nPostgreSQL vs. MSSQL – Triggers\n\nPostgreSQL\n\nPostgreSQL has advanced triggers. Supported triggering events include AFTER, BEFORE, and INSTEAD OF, which apply to INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE events. When a trigger fires, it can execute complex SQL statements using functions. PostgreSQL can execute this dynamically.\n\nSQL Server\n\nSQL Server offers triggers for different types of database events:\n\nDML Triggers: for a data manipulation language (DML) specific event, such as inserting, updating, or deleting records. These triggers fire on events irrespective of the number of rows affected.\n\nDDL Triggers: for data definition language (DDL) events, such as CREATE, DROP, or ALTER statements. These are useful for preventing or auditing changes to the database schema.\n\nLogon Triggers allow you to respond to user session establishment events. These triggers fire after successful authentication and before establishing the user session. They are helpful for auditing and controlling login activity.\n\nPostgreSQL vs. MSSQL – Stored Procedures\n\nPostgreSQL\n\nPostgreSQL supports stored procedures as user-defined functions with a RETURN VOID clause. SQL Server supports stored procedures written in various languages alongside standard SQL syntax.\n\nSQL Server\n\nSQL Server supports stored procedures for languages supported by Microsoft .NET framework (common runtime languages or CLR, like VB, C#, or Python).\n\nPostgreSQL vs. MSSQL – Query\n\nPostgreSQL\n\nPostgreSQL offers the PL/pgSQL procedural programming language. Additional functionalities to standard SQL in PostgreSQL include:\n\nAdvanced types and user-defined types.\n\nExtensions and custom modules.\n\nJSON support.\n\nFurther options for triggers and other functionality.\n\nSQL Server\n\nSQL Server uses T-SQL, which has a similar query syntax to standard SQL. T-SQL includes additional support for strings and data processing, local variables, and procedural programming.\n\nPostgreSQL vs. MSSQL – Full-Text Search\n\nPostgreSQL\n\nPostgreSQL offers advanced functionality for full-text search. It uses full-text indexing and dictionaries for faster searches. PostgreSQL stores pre-processed text documents as vector data types and processed queries as their dedicated type. Pre-processing parses text documents into linguistic units known as lexemes, which allows you to find case-insensitive variants of a word.\n\nSQL Server\n\nSQL Server offers full-text search as an optional component. Full-text indexes enable searches based on specific language rules. Searches are performed on columns or text data types (including char, varchar, nchar, nvarchar, text, ntext, image, xml, or varbinary(max) and FILESTREAM) using the T-SQL commands CONTAINS to match words and phrases and FREETEXT to match meaning. Thesaurus files can be used to help find synonyms of search terms. Full-text searches in SQL Server are not case sensitive.\n\nPostgreSQL vs. MSSQL – Regular Expressions\n\nPostgreSQL\n\nPostgreSQL has three methods for evaluating regular expressions: LIKE, SIMILAR TO, and POSIX regular expressions.\n\nSQL Server\n\nSQL Server does not natively support regular expression evaluation; similar but limited results can be achieved using the T-SQL functions LIKE, SUBSTRING, and PATINDEX.\n\nPostgreSQL vs. MSSQL – Partitioning\n\nPostgreSQL\n\nPostgreSQL offers built-in support for range, list, and hash partitioning. Range partitioning groups a table into ranges defined by a partition key column or set of columns – for example, by date range. List partitioning breaks a table into groups by explicitly listing predefined fundamental values in each partition.\n\nEDB Postgres Advanced Server also supports Interval Partitioning, which automatically creates the interval partitions as data arrives without causing deadlocks.\n\nSQL Server\n\nSQL Server supports table and index partitioning. The data is partitioned horizontally and maps groups of rows into individual partitions. All partitions of a single index or table must reside in the same database and the table or index is treated as a single entity for queries and updates.\n\nPostgreSQL vs. MSSQL – Table Scalability\n\nPostgreSQL\n\nPostgreSQL has a handful of indexing and two types of partitioning options to improve data operations and query performance on a scalable table. Table partitions and Indexes can be placed in separate tablespaces on different disk file systems, significantly improving table scalability. Postgres does not support horizontal table partitioning, but several commercially developed products are available.\n\nSQL Server\n\nSQL Server contains scalability enhancements to the on-disk storage for memory-optimized tables. The current versions offer multiple concurrent threads to persist memory-optimized tables, multithreaded recovery and merge operations, and dynamic management views. Scaling in SQL Server can be easily achieved through sharding.\n\nPostgreSQL vs. MSSQL – Table Statements\n\nPostgreSQL vs. MSSQL – Compliance\n\nPostgreSQL\n\nPostgreSQL is an object-relational database management system (ORDBMS) emphasizing extensibility and standards compliance. It is ACID-compliant. EDB Postgres Advanced Server is also HIPAA, GDPR, and PCI compliant.\n\nSQL Server\n\nSQL Server is a relational database management system (RDBMS) emphasizing security and performance. It is ACID-compliant.\n\nPostgreSQL vs. MSSQL – Columns\n\nPostgreSQL\n\nPostgreSQL introduced a new constraint feature in version 10 called GENERATED AS IDENTITY. This SQL-compliant variant of the SERIAL column allows you to assign a unique value to an identity column automatically.\n\nFor a SERIAL column to have a unique constraint or be a primary key, it must now be specified, just like other data types. Unique identifier columns are created using the data types smallserial, serial, and bigserial, similar to auto-increment features in different databases.\n\nSQL Server\n\nSQL Server's identity column property creates an identity column for a table to generate critical values for rows. Two values are specified when it is made: seed (initial value for the first row) and increment (amount to increase value over the previous row). By default, both the seed and incremental values are 1. Each table can only contain one identity column. The uniqueness of the values is not guaranteed unless PRIMARY KEY or UNIQUE constraints are imposed.\n\nPostgreSQL vs. MSSQL – Computed Column\n\nPostgreSQL\n\nPostgreSQL uses the term generated columns for computed columns. This feature was introduced with version 12. Generated columns can be physically stored when marked STORED; otherwise, they are not stored and are known as virtual.\n\nCREATE TABLE table ( …, computed_column GENERATED ALWAYS AS (expression) STORED );\n\nGenerated columns cannot have an identity definition or be part of a partition key; they can only reference the current row and cannot use subqueries. Values cannot be specified using INSERT or UPDATE, but the keyword DEFAULT is accepted.\n\nSQL Server\n\nSQL Server computed columns are not physically stored in a table unless marked with the PERSISTED property; the column can only be persisted when the value is deterministic or always returns the same result.\n\nALTER TABLE table ADD computed_column AS expression [PERSISTED];\n\nIf the computed column is deterministic and an acceptable data type, it can be used as a PRIMARY KEY or index but not as a DEFAULT or FOREIGN KEY constraint. Values cannot be specified using INSERT or UPDATE.\n\nPostgreSQL vs. MSSQL – Deleting Table Data\n\nYou can delete data from a table in PostgreSQL using the DELETE statement:\n\nDELETE FROM table WHERE condition;\n\nThe DELETE FROM clause specifies the table and the rows to delete are specified by using the condition in the WHERE clause. The WHERE clause is optional, but if you omit it, the statement will delete all rows in the table.\n\nThe DELETE statement removes rows from a table in SQL SERVER:\n\nDELETE FROM table WHERE condition;\n\nThe name of the table from which the rows are to be deleted is specified in the FROM clause, and the rows to delete are specified by the condition in the WHERE clause. The WHERE clause is optional, but if you skip it, all rows from the table will be removed.\n\nYou can specify the number or percent of random rows that will be deleted by using the TOP clause.\n\nDELETE TOP 10 FROM table;\n\nThis statement removes 10 random rows from the table. Because rows are stored in unspecified order, we do not know which 10 rows will be deleted. Similarly, you can delete the 10 percent of random rows:\n\nDELETE TOP 10 PERCENT FROM table;\n\nPostgreSQL vs. MSSQL – Integers\n\nPostgreSQL\n\nThere are three kinds of integers in PostgreSQL:\n\nSMALLINT (small integer, a 2-byte type with a range from -32,768 to 32,767)\n\nINT (integer, a 4-byte type with a range from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647)\n\nBIGINT (a large-range integer: -9223372036854775808 to 9223372036854775807)\n\nSQL Server\n\nSQL SERVER supports standard SQL integer types BIGINT, INT, SMALLINT, and TINYINT. The range and storage size of each type is as follows:\n\nPostgreSQL vs. SQL Server Integers Comparison Table\n\nPostgreSQL vs. MSSQL – Boolean Types\n\nPostgreSQL\n\nThe PostgreSQL Boolean data type can have three states:\n\nTRUE\n\nFALSE\n\nNULL\n\nSQL Server\n\nThe BIT data type in SQL SERVER represents true/false boolean data. A BIT field's value is either 1, 0, or null.\n\nPostgreSQL vs. MSSQL – NoSQL Capabilities\n\nPostgreSQL\n\nLike many other relational databases, PostgreSQL has added support for JSON data, the most common format for semi-structured data stored in NoSQL systems. However, because SQL is the only way to interact with a PostgreSQL database, it should not be considered NoSQL.\n\nSQL Server\n\nSQL Server has native JSON functions that enable you to parse JSON documents using standard SQL language. You can store JSON documents in an SQL Server and query JSON data as in a NoSQL database. Still, because SQL Server is an SQL database, it should not be considered NoSQL.\n\nPostgreSQL vs. MSSQL – Security\n\nPostgreSQL\n\nPostgreSQL supports SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) connections to encrypt client-server communications. You can enable SSL by setting the SSL parameter in the postgresql.conf file. To meet enterprise needs, the EDB Postgres Advanced Server includes:\n\nAdditional built-in auditing features that capture detailed data\n\nIntegrated password policy management capabilities\n\nData redaction\n\nSQL Server\n\nSQL Server offers a range of features and functions to prevent security threats because each application has unique security needs. The SQL Server security framework manages access to securable entities through authentication and authorization. SQL Server supports a hierarchy of encryption options and supports TLS (transport layer security) for encrypting network traffic.\n\nPostgreSQL vs. MSSQL – Analytical Functions\n\nPostgreSQL\n\nPostgreSQL supports various analytical functions, which perform aggregation on a set of rows. There are two types of analytical functions: window functions and aggregate functions. Aggregate functions perform aggregation and return a single aggregate value for a set of rows (like sum, avg, min, or max). Window functions return a single aggregate value for each of the rows.\n\nPostgreSQL supports the following window functions:\n\nSQL Server\n\nSQL Server's analytic functions empower you to calculate moving averages, running totals, percentages, or top-N results directly within a group.\n\nSQL Server supports the following analytic functions:\n\nPostgreSQL vs. MSSQL – Dynamic Actions\n\nPostgreSQL\n\nPostgreSQL prioritizes security and predictability by avoiding dynamic actions. Achieve most similar operations using well-defined SELECT statements.\n\nSQL Server\n\nFor enhanced security, SQL Server restricts dynamic actions. Achieve similar functionalities through well-defined stored procedures.\n\nPostgreSQL vs. MSSQL – Administration and GUI Tools\n\nPostgreSQL\n\nPostgreSQL can be administered through a GUI using Oracle’s SQL Developer, pgAdmin, OmniDB, DBeaver, and Postgres Enterprise Manager. Other GUI tools for monitoring health and performance include Nagios, Zabbix, Cacti, and EDB Postgres. SQLECTRON is a cross-platform option that is free and open source; it is compatible with several SQL databases, including SQL Server.\n\nSQL Server\n\nSQL Server can be administered through a GUI on Windows using SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS), which is free. SQL Operations Studio is a free, open source, cross-platform GUI for Mac. SQLECTRON is a free, open source, cross-platform option compatible with several SQL databases, including PostgreSQL.\n\nPostgreSQL vs. MSSQL – Performance\n\nPostgreSQL\n\nPostgreSQL offers speed and performance across data sets of all sizes and it regularly outperforms other databases in both online transaction processing (OLTP) and online analytical processing (OLAP) speeds. It offers multi-version concurrency control (MVCC), processing multiple transactions simultaneously, with fewer deadlocks than SQL Server. PostgreSQL offers many tools and parameters that allow users to monitor and optimize database performance.\n\nSQL Server\n\nSQL Server prides itself on the speed of its analytical and transaction processing. However, because the SQL Server user agreement prohibits the publication of benchmark testing without Microsoft’s prior written approval, head-to-head comparisons with other database systems are rare. Among the features SQL Server highlights for optimizing performance and speed is its In-Memory OLTP, which takes advantage of in-memory data tables that perform better than writing directly to disk. The SQL Server Standard edition has some performance limitations for memory, partitioning, indexing, and other functionalities that require upgrading to the Enterprise version.\n\nPostgreSQL vs. MSSQL – Concurrency\n\nPostgreSQL\n\nPostgreSQL has a well-developed multi-version concurrency control (MVCC) that handles multiple procedures simultaneously. MVCC provides snapshots of database info to avoid showing inconsistencies caused by simultaneous transactions or the locking of data that occurs in other database systems. It uses Serializable Snapshot Isolation (SSI) to guarantee transaction isolation.\n\nSQL Server\n\nSQL Server has a less fully developed multi-version concurrency control system and, by default, relies on data locking to prevent errors from simultaneous transactions. To improve performance, it implements optimistic concurrency. This approach skips row locking and instead verifies any changes against a cached version, assuming conflicts are rare.\n\nPostgreSQL vs. MSSQL – Adoption\n\nPostgreSQL\n\nPostgreSQL is the world's most advanced open source database. Businesses across the globe are using PostgreSQL for mission-critical workloads. The PostgreSQL community and a few companies, such as EnterpriseDB and 2ndQuadrant, are ensuring that PostgreSQL adoption continues to expand globally.\n\nSQL Server\n\nSQL Server is popular with enterprises that rely on Microsoft products. It saw an increase in market share over the past two decades as Microsoft pushed it with its Windows Servers. However, with more and more enterprises shifting to open source in recent years, the popularity curve of SQL servers is becoming flatter and flatter.\n\nPostgreSQL vs. MSSQL – Environment and Stack\n\nPostgreSQL\n\nPostgreSQL is popular with the LAPP stack (Linux, Apache, PostgreSQL, and PHP/Python. The LAPP stack is growing in popularity; large-platform service providers like Amazon and VMware provide services with readily installed LAPP stack modules.\n\nSQL Server\n\nSQL Server is a popular component of the Microsoft stack. It comprises Microsoft technologies like Microsoft WPF, ASP.NET, SharePoint, and Office 365.\n\nPostgreSQL vs. MSSQL – Scheduling Tasks\n\nPostgreSQL\n\nPostgreSQL doesn’t provide a built-in job scheduler like other SQL databases do. Recurring tasks require external tools like pgAgent, cron, or pg_cron on Linux, and Task Scheduler or SQLBackupAndFTP on Windows.\n\nSQL Server\n\nThe SQL Server Management Studio schedules tasks in the SQL Server.\n\nPostgreSQL vs. MSSQL – Data Redaction\n\nPostgreSQL\n\nPostgreSQL does not support data redaction to limit the display of sensitive data for specific users. Enterprises looking for data redaction features to add more security can use EDB Postgres Advanced Server, an Oracle-compatible fork of PostgreSQL.\n\nSQL Server\n\nSQL Server offers dynamic data masking (DDM). DDM limits sensitive data exposure by hiding it from users without the proper privileges. It complements other SQL Server security features like auditing, encryption, and row-level security.\n\nPostgreSQL vs. MSSQL – Limitations\n\nPostgreSQL\n\nIn addition to SQL and PL/pgSQL, PostgreSQL supports the procedural languages PL/Tcl, PL/Perl, and PL/Python in its distribution and supports the external procedural languages PL/Java, PL/Lua, PL/R, PL/sh (Unix shell), and PL/JavaScript. It also supports user-defined functions in C languages. It runs on various server operating systems, including Linux, Mac, Windows, BSD, and Solaris. It is easily deployed using Docker containers or Kubernetes.\n\nSQL Server\n\nIn addition to T-SQL, SQL Server supports languages compatible with the Microsoft .NET framework, including C#, Java, PHP, and Python. SQL Server must run on Linux or Windows operating systems. It can be deployed on Docker containers and Kubernetes with Microsoft’s Azure Kubernetes Services.\n\nPostgreSQL vs. MSSQL – Access Methods\n\nPostgreSQL\n\nPostgreSQL is compatible with the following access methods, protocols, and APIs for accessing its data: ADO.NET, JDBC, ODBC, and the native C library. It also supports a streaming API for binary large objects (BLOBs).\n\nSQL Server\n\nSQL Server is compatible with the following access methods, protocols, and APIs for accessing its data: ADO.NET, JDBC, ODBC, OLE DB, and TDS.\n\nPostgreSQL vs. MSSQL – Bulk Collect and Binds\n\nPostgreSQL vs. MSSQL – Synonyms\n\nSQL Server supports synonyms. Synonyms provide a layer of abstraction that protects a client application from changes made to base objects. A synonym belongs to a schema; like other objects in a schema, its name must be unique. Binding is by name only; if a base object is modified, dropped, or replaced, the missing reference will only be found at run-time. PostgreSQL does not support synonyms."
