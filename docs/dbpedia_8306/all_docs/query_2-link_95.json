The document describes hierarchical cluster analysis and the algorithm used to generate a dendrogram. It begins by calculating the distance matrix between samples based on species presence/absence data. Samples are sequentially merged into clusters based on minimum distance between clusters. Distance between newly merged clusters is recalculated using maximum, minimum, or average linkage methods. The example demonstrates hierarchical clustering of 7 samples using maximum linkage, generating a dendrogram that visually summarizes the relationship between samples.",
