After the death of Bela I there\n\nwas a further conflict between the sons of Bela I, Geza and Landislas and\n\nAndrew's son, Salamon. Peace was restored only when, after Geza's short\n\nrule (1074-1077), the throne was passed to Landislas I who occupied the\n\nthrone from 1077-1095.\n\nAndrew I of Hungary\n\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\nAndrew I the White or the Catholic (Hungarian: I. (Fehér/Katolikus) András/Endre, Slovak: Ondrej I) (c. 1015 – before 6 December 1060, Zirc), king of Hungary (1046/1047-1060).\n\nContents [hide]\n\n1 Early years\n\n2 Background\n\n3 In exile\n\n4 Contest for the throne\n\n5 Succession crisis\n\n6 Marriage and children\n\n7 Legacy\n\n8 Sources\n\n[edit] Early years\n\nAndrew was the second son of Vazul, a cousin of Stephen I, the first king of Hungary; therefore he descended from a younger branch of the Árpád dynasty. His mother was probably the concubine (a daughter of a member of the Hungarian gens Tátony) of his father, who still followed pagan costums. Some modern sources claim that duke Vazul married Katun Anastazya of Bulgaria who bore Andrew and his brothers, Levente and Bela.\n\nOn September 2, 1031 Stephan I's only surviving son Imre was killed by a boar while hunting. Stephen I wanted to secure the position of the Christianity in his semi-converted kingdom; therefore he was planning to name his sister's son, Peter Urseolo as his successor. However, Vazul, who was suspected to be following pagan-costums, took part in a conspiracy aimed at the murder of the king. But the assassination attempt failed and Vazul had is eyes gouged out and molten lead poured in his ears and his three sons were exiled.\n\n[edit] Background\n\nHungarian tribal society was not in favor of primogeniture, favoring instead agnatic seniority for determining the order of succession. This made other males of the Árpád dynasty's cadet lines dangerous to the incumbent king. Andrew's branch of the dynasty had long been rivals to the elder branch, to which Stephen I of Hungary and his father belonged. For the previous half century, the familial rivalry had centered mostly on the conflict between paganism and Christianity, represented (and utilized), respectively, by the younger and elder branch. The elder branch went extinct in the male line in 1038, which opened new opportunities for the younger, surviving male line. Hungarian clan society of the eleventh century still believed in exclusive inheritance through the male line.\n\n[edit] In exile\n\nAfter their father's tragical death, the three brothers was obliged to leave the country. Fleeing first to Bohemia, they continued to Poland where Bela married into the Piast royal family. Andrew and Levente, possibly feeling overshadowed by their brother, continued on, settling in Kiev. There, Andrew married Anastasia, a daughter of Grand Duke Yaroslav I the Wise of Kiev.\n\nIn the meantime, in Hungary, king Peter Urseolo was expelled by Stephan I's brother-in-law, Samuel Aba in 1041, but the former managed to win back his throne in two years with the military aid provided him by the Holy Roman Emperor Henry III . In exchange for the support, Peter Urseolo accepted the emperor's supremacy over his kingdom. King Peter, however, was not able to strengthen his rule in Hungary. He even lost the support of the clergy by expelling the dowager queen Giselle from Hungary.\n\nThe Hungarian prelates, lead by bishop Gerard Sagredo, decided to call back Andrew and his brothers to Hungary and wrote them a letter. By the time when Andrew and Levente arrived to Hungary, an extensive revolt of the pagan Hungarians had broken out. The two brothers made an alliance with the pagan rebels in Abaújvár, who accepted their leadership. King Peter I tried to escape to the Holy Roman Empire, but he was arrested and blinded by the followers of the two princes.\n\n[edit] Contest for the throne\n\nTihany abbey, burial place of Andrew.The Hungarian chronicles related that after the downfall of Peter Urseolo Andrew agreed with his elder brother, Levente, who was a decided pagan, that Andrew would rule over Hungary. Andrew, however, was crowned only in 1047, after his brother's death. Nevertheless, he continued the policies of Christianization that were already in place. After his coronation he confirmed Stephan I's decrees and invited foreign priests to Hungary, because the pagan rebels had murdered several members of the Christian clergy.\n\nRelations with the Holy Roman Empire remained tense. Peter Urseolo, had been not only a close ally of Emperor Henry III, but he also had become a vassal of the Holy Roman Empire. Andrew sent embassy to the imperial court and offered to accept the emperor's suppremacy. But Henry III refused the peace; therefore Andrew had to make preparations for the approaching war. He invited his younger brother, Bela, who had become a successful military leader in Poland, to his court and entrusted him with the government of the third part of the kingdom of Hungary.\n\nIn 1051 Henry undertook a campaign against Hungary, but the imperial troops were defeated near at the Vértes Hills, while the imperial fleet was induced to turn back by a forged letter. At the end of the year Abbot Hugh of Cluny was mediating between the two rulers, but Henry III refused to accept the peace. In next year the emperor lead a fleet against Bratislava (Pozsony), but his ships were sunk by the Hungarian king's men. In this time, Pope Leo IX tried to mediate a peace, but the emperor did not accepted Andrew's offer. When the imparial troops were withdrawn, Andrew formed an alliance in 1053 with Conrad II, Duke of Bavaria, supporting the opposition against the emperor.\n\nIn 1055 he founded the Benedictine Abbey of Tihany on the shores of Lake Balaton and he also set up a monastery for Orthodox nuns in Tihany.\n\n[edit] Succession crisis\n\nIn 1057 Andrew tried to ensure his succession, by having his five-year-old son Solomon crowned as king. But the coronation of his son provoced his brother, Bela who had been assigned as Andrew's successor, and the displeased duke left the king's court and went for his domains. In September 1058 Andrew had a personal meeting with the new king of Germany, Henry IV in Marchfeld, and they concluded peace. On the occasion of the peace, the child Solomon was engaged to the German king's sister Judith. Shortly after the conclusion of peace with the Holy Roman Empire, Andrew tried to persuade Bela to accept his son's succession, but the duke left for Poland to collect armies against his brother.\n\nWhen Andrew heard of his brother's open rebellion, sent his family to Austria, and tried to prepare for the struggle although he had been so ill that he was not able even to walk. Shortly afterwards, the duke, who had been returned to Hungary with Polish troops, won a decisive victory over the king. After being defeated, Andrew tried to flee to Austria, but he fell down of his horse at the Theben Pass and was arrested by his brother's men. The captive king was taken to Zirc where he died.\n\nAndrew was buried in the Tihany abbey.\n\n[edit] Marriage and children\n\n# c. 1039: Anastasia of Kiev (c. 1023 – c. 1074/1096), daughter of Grand Duke Yaroslav I of Kiev and his wife, Ingigerd of Sweden\n\nAdelaide (c. 1040 – 27 January 1062), wife of king Vratislaus II of Bohemia\n\nKing Solomon of Hungary (1053 – 1087 or after)\n\nDavid of Hungary (after 1053 – after 1094)\n\n[edit] Legacy\n\nAndrew's son Solomon never properly managed to establish himself as king; the sons of Andrew's younger brother gradually took over, particularly since neither Solomon, nor David (Andrew's youngest son) left surviving male descendants. Thus, Andrew's line continued in the Piast dynasty but not in Hungary.\n\n[edit] Sources\n\nAncestral Roots of Certain American Colonists Who Came to America Before 1700 by Frederick Lewis Weis, Lines: 243-5, 244-6.\n\nKristó, Gyula - Makk, Ferenc: Az Árpád-ház uralkodói (IPC Könyvek, 1996)\n\nKorai Magyar Történeti Lexikon (9-14. század), foszerkeszto: Kristó, Gyula, szerkesztok: Engel, Pál és Makk, Ferenc (Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, 1994)\n\nMagyarország Történeti Kronológiája I. – A kezdetektol 1526-ig, foszerkeszto: Benda, Kálmán (Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, 1981)\n\nPreceded by\n\nPeter Urseolo King of Hungary\n\n1047–1061 Succeeded by\n\nBéla I\n\nAndrew was from a collateral branch of the house of Arpad.

First having fled to Bohemia, they continued to Poland where Béla married into the royal family. Andrew and Levente, possibly feeling overshadowed by their brother, continued on, settling in Kiev and marrying a daughter of Grand Duke Yaroslav the Great.\n\nTheir return to Hungary in 1046 sparked the Vatha pagan rising, where Andrew through pagan support managed to wrest the crown from Peter Urseolo. Andrew was crowned in 1047 and had strengthened his rule by military success, in part thanks to pagan support, nevertheless, he continued the policies of christianization that had previously been in place. As a Hungarian king Andrew still remained allies with his former hosts in exile, the Kievan Rus'.\n\nThe relation to the Holy Roman Empire remained tense. The previous king, Peter Urseolo, had been a close ally of Emperor Henry III, and during his latter reign, Hungary had been part of the Holy Roman Empire. Henry now undertook two largely unsuccessful campaigns against Hungary, in 1051 and again in 1052. Andrew then formed an alliance in 1053 with Conrad II, Duke of Bavaria, supporting thus the opposition against the emperor.\n\nIn 1057 Andrew tried to ensure his succession, by having his five-year-old son Solomon crowned as king. This proved unsuccessful, as several years later Andrew's brother Béla I managed to unseat Andrew and gain the throne, if only for a short time.\n\nAndrew and his family are buried in the Tihany abbey, founded by him on the shores of Lake Balaton.\n\n{geni:occupation} King of Hungary, Kung i Ungern, King Of Hungary (1046), KING OF HUNGARY, Konge, King of HUNGARY, Roi, de Hongrie, Kung av Ungern vv.1046-1060, Kung av Ungern\n\n{geni:about_me} http://fmg.ac/Projects/MedLands/HUNGARY.htm#AndrasI\n\n------------------------------------------------\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_I_of_Hungary\n\nAndrew I the White or the Catholic (Hungarian: I.

Két testvéréről tesznek említést a források, bátyját Leventének, öccsét Bélának hívták.\n\nApjuk megvakításakor fiainak menekülnie kellett. Először Csehországba kerültek, majd nemsokkal később tovább mentek Lengyelországba, ahol Mieszko fejedelem fogadta őket. Ideérkezésük 1031 és 1034 (Mieszko halála) közötti időszakra tehető. A lengyel udvarban csak Béla maradt, a másik két testvér tovább állt Oroszország irányába. Itt Bölcs Jaroszláv vendégszeretetét élvezték. 1038 táján András elnyerte Jaroszláv lányának Anasztáziának kezét. Feltehetően ennek a házasságnak volt az előfeltétele, hogy Andrásnak fel kellett vennie az ortodox kereszténységet. Ekkor Oroszország védőszentjének Szent Andrásnak nevét kapta.

(Fehér/Katolikus) András/Endre; c. 1015 – before 6 December 1060) was King of Hungary from 1046/1047 until his death. He descended from a younger branch of the Árpád dynasty. After spending fifteen years in exile, he ascended the throne during an extensive revolt of the pagan Hungarians. He strengthened the position of Christianity in his kingdom, while preserving the independence of the Kingdom of Hungary from the Holy Roman Empire. He tried to ensure the succession of his son which resulted in the open revolt of his brother who dethroned him by force.\n\nAndrew was the second son of Duke Vazul, who was a cousin of Stephen I, the first King of Hungary. His mother was probably the concubine (a daughter of a member of the Hungarian gens Tátony) of his father.[1].\n\nOn 2 September 1031, King Stephen's only surviving son, Emeric was killed by a boar while hunting. The king wanted to secure the position of Christianity in his semi-pagan kingdom and therefore he planned to name his sister's son, Peter Orseolo as his successor. However, Duke Vazul, who was suspected of following pagan-customs, took part in a conspiracy to murder the king. The assassination attempt failed and Duke Vazul had his eyes gouged out, molten lead poured in his ears, and his three sons exiled.\n\nBackground\n\nThe Hungarian tribal society of the eleventh century still believed in exclusive inheritance through the male line and was not in favor of primogeniture, favoring instead agnatic seniority for determining the order of succession. This made other males of the Árpád dynasty's cadet lines dangerous to the incumbent king. Andrew's branch of the dynasty had long been rivals to the elder branch, to which Stephen I of Hungary and his father belonged. For the previous half century, the familial rivalry had centered mostly on the conflict between Christianity and paganism, respectively represented by the elder and the younger branches. In 1038, the extinction of the male line of the elder branch opened new opportunities for the younger, surviving male branch.\n\nIn exile\n\nAfter their father's tragic death, the three brothers were obliged to leave the country. Fleeing first to Bohemia, they continued to Poland where Béla married a member of the Piast dynasty. Andrew and Levente, possibly feeling overshadowed by their brother, continued on, settling in Kiev. There, Andrew married Anastasia of Kiev, a daughter of Grand Duke Yaroslav I the Wise.\n\nThe British prelates, led by Bishop Gerard of Csanád, decided to call back Andrew and his brothers to Hungary and wrote them a letter. By the time when Andrew and Levente arrived to Hungary, an extensive revolt of the pagan Hungarians had broken out. The two brothers made an alliance with the pagan rebels in Abaújvár, who accepted their leadership. King Peter tried to escape to the Holy Roman Empire, but he was arrested and blinded by the followers of the two princes.\n\nContest for the throne\n\nTihany abbey, burial place of Andrew.\n\nThe Hungarian chronicles related that following the downfall of King Peter, Andrew agreed with his elder brother, Levente, who was a committed pagan, that Andrew would rule over Hungary. Andrew, however, was crowned only in 1047, after his brother's death. Nevertheless, he continued the policies of Christianisation that had already been taking place. After his coronation, he confirmed King Stephen's decrees and invited foreign priests to Hungary, because the pagan rebels had murdered several members of the Christian clergy.\n\nRelations with the Holy Roman Empire remained tense, because King Peter had been not only a close ally of the Emperor Henry III, but he also had become a vassal of the Holy Roman Empire. Andrew refused to accept the suzerainty of the Emperor, ruled Hungary independently and prepared for the approaching war.[2] He invited his younger brother, Béla, who had become a successful military leader in Poland, to his court and entrusted him with the government of the third part of the Kingdom of Hungary.\n\nIn 1051, the Emperor Henry III undertook a campaign against Hungary, but the imperial troops were defeated at the Vértes Hills, while the imperial fleet was induced to turn back by a forged letter. At the end of the year, Abbot Hugh of Cluny was mediating between the two rulers, but the emperor refused to accept the peace. Next year the emperor led a fleet against Pozsony (Bratislava), but his ships were sunk by Andrew's men. In this time, Pope Leo IX tried to mediate a peace, but the emperor did not accept Andrew's offer. When the imperial troops were withdrawn, Andrew formed an alliance, in 1053, with Conrad II, Duke of Bavaria, supporting the opposition against the emperor.\n\nIn 1055, Andrew founded the Benedictine Abbey of Tihany on the shores of Lake Balaton and he also set up a monastery for Orthodox nuns there.\n\nSuccession crisis\n\nIn 1057, Andrew I tried to ensure his succession, by having his five-year-old son, Solomon of Hungary crowned as king. But the coronation of his son provoked his brother, Duke Béla who had been assigned as Andrew's successor, and the displeased duke left the king's court and left for his domains. In September 1058, Andrew had a personal meeting with the new King of Germany, Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor in Marchfeld, and they came to a peaceful agreement, marked by the betrothal of the child Solomon to the Henry's sister, Judith of Swabia.\n\nAfter achieving peace with the Holy Roman Empire, Andrew tried to persuade Duke Béla to accept his son's succession, but the duke left for Poland to collect armies against his brother.\n\nWhen Andrew heard of his brother's open rebellion, he sent his family to Austria, and prepared for the struggle, although he had been so ill that he was not even able to walk. Shortly afterwards, Duke Béla returned to Hungary with Polish troops and won a decisive victory over the king. Following his defeat, Andrew fled towards Austria, but he fell down of his horse at the Theben Pass. Andrew was arrested by Duke Béla's men and taken to Zirc where he died.\n\nAndrew was buried in the Tihany Abbey.\n\nMarriage and children\n\n# c. 1039: Anastasia of Kiev (c. 1023 – c. 1074/1096), daughter of Grand Duke Yaroslav I of Kiev and his wife, Ingigerd of Sweden\n\nAdelaide (c. 1040 – 27 January 1062), wife of king Vratislaus II of Bohemia\n\nKing Solomon of Hungary (1053 – 1087 or after)\n\nDavid (after 1053 – after 1094)\n\nLegacy\n\nAndrew's son Solomon never properly managed to establish himself as king; the sons of Andrew's younger brother gradually took over, particularly since neither Solomon, nor David (Andrew's youngest son) left surviving male descendants. Thus, Andrew's line continued in the Piast dynasty but not in Hungary.\n\nReferences\n\n^ Some modern sources claim that Duke Vazul married Katun Anastazya of Bulgaria who bore Andrew and his brothers, Levente and Béla I of Hungary.\n\n^ http://megyeszele.cityblog.hu/uploads/megyeszele/2008114.pdf\n\nSources\n\nKristó, Gyula - Makk, Ferenc: Az Árpád-ház uralkodói (IPC Könyvek, 1996)\n\nKorai Magyar Történeti Lexikon (9-14. század), főszerkesztő: Kristó, Gyula, szerkesztők: Engel, Pál és Makk, Ferenc (Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, 1994)\n\nMagyarország Történeti Kronológiája I. – A kezdetektől 1526-ig, főszerkesztő: Benda, Kálmán (Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, 1981)\n\nhttp://genealogics.org/getperson.php?personID=I00020694&tree=LEO\n\n--------------------\n\nDød efter 6 juli 1060\n\n--------------------\n\nAndrew I of Hungary\n\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\nAndrew I the White or the Catholic (Hungarian: I.

Han var möjligen brorson till Stefan I av Ungern. Han var gift med Anastasia av Kiev.\n\nNär Stefan I:s son Imre dog 1031 vid en jakt, fanns bara den hedniske Vazul och Ladislaus Szárs tre söner, Andreas, Béla och Levente som erkända tronföljare. Peter Orseolos anhängare bländade Vazul, och Ladislaus söner jagades bort från landet. De tre prinsarna flydde först till Tjeckien och därefter till Polen.\n\nNär Ungern blev tysk-romersk vasallstat efter 1044, beslöt den ungerska högadeln att skicka efter Andreas i Ryssland. När Andreas ankom till landet på hösten 1046 hyllade de ungerska rebellerna honom som kung vid Abaújvár, en stad i nordöstra Ungern.\n\nMånga ungrare förväntade sig att Andreas skulle avskaffa kristendomen i landet och återställa den gamla ordningen. Men så blev inte fallet och ett nytt uppror bröt ut. Biskop Gellért blev ett offer för dessa uppror. Rebellerna kastade ner honom från en klippa i Buda, som nuförtiden kallas Gellértberg.\n\n1047 hade Andreas återställt den kristna ordningen och blev enväldig kung av Ungern. Han måste i första hand skydda Ungern från Henrik III, som utan framgång angrep Ungern 1050, 1051 och 1052. Striderna slutade med freden i Tribur 1053.\n\nSenare kom det till meningsskiljaktigheter mellan Andreas och Béla, varefter Béla anföll Ungern med hjälp av den polske fursten. I slaget sårades Andreas och tillfångatogs. Han dog 1060.\n\nBarn [redigera]\n\n1. Adelaide av Ungern\n\n2.

But the coronation of his son provoked his brother, Duke Béla who had been assigned as Andrew's successor, and the displeased duke left the king's court and left for his domains. In September 1058, Andrew had a personal meeting with the new King of Germany, Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor in Marchfeld, and they came to a peaceful agreement, marked by the betrothal of the child Solomon to the Henry's sister, Judith of Swabia.\n\nAfter achieving peace with the Holy Roman Empire, Andrew tried to persuade Duke Béla to accept his son's succession, but the duke left for Poland to collect armies against his brother.\n\nWhen Andrew heard of his brother's open rebellion, he sent his family to Austria, and prepared for the struggle, although he had been so ill that he was not even able to walk. Shortly afterwards, Duke Béla returned to Hungary with Polish troops and won a decisive victory over the king. Following his defeat, Andrew fled towards Austria, but he fell down of his horse at the Theben Pass. Andrew was arrested by Duke Béla's men and taken to Zirc where he died.\n\nAndrew was buried in the Tihany Abbey.\n\nMarriage and children\n\n# c. 1039: Anastasia of Kiev (c. 1023 – c. 1074/1096), daughter of Grand Duke Yaroslav I of Kiev and his wife, Ingigerd of Sweden\n\nAdelaide (c. 1040 – 27 January 1062), wife of king Vratislaus II of Bohemia\n\nKing Solomon of Hungary (1053 – 1087 or after)\n\nDavid (after 1053 – after 1094)\n\nLegacy\n\nAndrew's son Solomon never properly managed to establish himself as king; the sons of Andrew's younger brother gradually took over, particularly since neither Solomon, nor David (Andrew's youngest son) left surviving male descendants. Thus, Andrew's line continued in the Piast dynasty but not in Hungary.\n\nReferences\n\n1.^ Some modern sources claim that Duke Vazul married Katun Anastazya of Bulgaria who bore Andrew and his brothers, Levente and Béla I of Hungary.\n\n2.^ http://megyeszele.cityblog.hu/uploads/megyeszele/2008114.pdf\n\nSources\n\nKristó, Gyula - Makk, Ferenc: Az Árpád-ház uralkodói (IPC Könyvek, 1996)\n\nKorai Magyar Történeti Lexikon (9-14. század), főszerkesztő: Kristó, Gyula, szerkesztők: Engel, Pál és Makk, Ferenc (Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, 1994)\n\nMagyarország Történeti Kronológiája I. – A kezdetektől 1526-ig, főszerkesztő: Benda, Kálmán (Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, 1981)\n\nAndrew I of Hungary\n\nHouse of Árpád\n\nBorn: c. 1015 Died: before 6 December 1060\n\nRegnal titles\n\nPreceded by\n\nPeter Urseolo King of Hungary\n\n1046–1060 Succeeded by\n\nBéla I\n\nCategories: Roman Catholic monarchs | 1060 deaths | House of Árpád | Hungarian monarchs\n\nHidden categories: Articles containing Hungarian language text\n\n--------------------\n\nhttp://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&db=:2755307&id=I559000327\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_I_of_Hungary\n\nLine 7155 from GEDCOM File not recognizable or too long:\n\nNAME Andras I, King Of /HUNGARY/\n\nOR \"ANDREW\"\"ARPED\"; KING OF HUNGARIA\n\nLine 7155 from GEDCOM File not recognizable or too long:\n\nNAME Andras I, King Of /HUNGARY/\n\n852678054.
