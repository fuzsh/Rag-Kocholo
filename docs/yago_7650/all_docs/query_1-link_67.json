        "text": "During the ninth century the Varyags (Vikings) invaded Europe from the region of Norway and Sweden, using the rivers as their primary means of transport. One group settled first in Novgorod, and later in Kiev, and dominated the local Slavic population. The resulting tribes were known as the Kievan Rus. Although the Rus were able to travel by river as far as Constantinople and the Byzantine Empire, expansion and settlement to the south was blocked by invading eastern tribes such as the Khazars, Cumans, Pechenegs. A small settlement at the mouth of the River Don was all the Rus could hold in the south. In 911 and 945 the leaders of the Rus signed treaties with the Byzantine Empire to allow trading in furs and slaves\n\nPrincess Olga of Kiev was baptized in 954, visited Constantinople, and is known in Russia as \"The Apostle to the Russians\"\n\nOlga's son Svyatoslav remained a pagan and killed several of his brothers. He attacked the Byzantine Empire, but was defeated, and while he was retreating he was killed by the Pechenegs.\n\nVladimir, the illegitimate youngest son of Svyatislav, became a Christian in 988-989, married Anna, the sister of the Byzantine Emperor Basil II, and established the Russian Church as part of the Byzantine Church, rather than the Roman Church. At the time of his marriage to Anna he had already had several wives, producing 12 sons, and about 500 concubines.\n\nVladimir died in 1015 fighting his son Yaroslav who had rebelled in Novgorod. His son Svyatopolk the Damned killed three of his brothers, including Boris and Gleb who were Christians, but was defeated in turn by his brother Yaroslav the Wise, prince of Novgorod.\n\nYaroslav (lived 980-1054) moved to Kiev in 1019, and codified the earliest recorded laws of the Rus, known as the \"Russkaia Pravda\". During his reign he had contact with England (the two sons of Edmund II took refuge with him when Canute invaded England) and with most of the kings and princes of Europe. His daughter Elizabeth married Harald III Hardraade of Norway, Anastasia married Andrew I of Hungary, and Anna married Henry I of France. His sons married Polish, German, and Greek wives. He divided his kingdom between his five surviving sons, with instructions for how the succession was to be maintained, but that system did not last very long.\n\nIn 1169 Yaroslav's great-great-grandson Andrew invaded from the north and took Kiev, but remained as a ruler in the north. The center of power moved to Novgorod, the country split into warring principalities, and Kiev lost its position of importance.\n\nTartar was a name used in Europe for the groups of Mongols and other nomadic tribes who started to move westwards from their original homeland in central Asia in the thirteenth century.\n\nIn 1206 a young Mongolian leader, Temujin, fought his way to power over the Mongol tribes, and took the name Ghenghis and the title \"Khan\" (leader, equivalent to Emperor). By a series of brilliant military campaigns Ghengis Khan conquered northern China, most of central Asia, Turkistan, and the southern parts of Russia. In 1251 his grandson Kublai Khan united north and south China under his rule, and founded the Mongol YÃ¼an dynasty in 1259.\n\nGhenghis Khan was killed in 1227, and was succeeded by four sons. Ogodai Khan took control of the western steppes, Jagatai Khan took east Turkhistan, Juchi (who also died in 1227) took west Turkhistan. Juchi was succeeded by his son Batu Khan, who led the Golden Horde westwards, consolidated Mongol control of most of Russia and founded the Kipchak Empire. In 1242 Batu Khan established Sarai as his stronghold.\n\nThe Mongols do not seem to have had the concept of ruling as a settled conquering nation. They allowed conquered peoples to retain the social structures they had had, except that they had to supply the Mongols with gold, horses, and women.\n\nIn the case of Russia, the Khans allowed the princes of the various principalities to continue ruling as vassal princes. The Khans reserved the right to appoint the \"Grand Duke\", and the princedom of Muscovy, centered on Moscow, became the most important of the conquered states.\n\nBatu Khan died in 1255 and was succeeded by his brother Berke Khan, who became a Muslim. Full conversion of the Golden Horde to Islam was carried out by Uzbek Khan (1312-1342), but they did not force their conquered peoples to convert - the Russians were allowed to remain Christian so long as they paid their taxes.\n\nNovgorod and the more northerly regions managed to stay more or less free of the Tartars."
