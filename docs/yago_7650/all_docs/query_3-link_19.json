As a grandson by the former is reported to have accompanied Edward Atheling to Scotland (where legend describes him as son of a younger son of King Andrew) and appears to have made no claim to the throne of Hungary, we suspect that either the relationship was not viewed as a formal marriage or the marriages were in fact the other way around."
