It is equally possible\n\nthat some of Joseph's maternal ancestors were Dravidians from Kerala or\n\nBerbers from Morocco.\n\nThe key word here is EVIDENCE. You can't assess the degree of probability\n\nfor your speculation without it. I have yet to see you cite anything beyond\n\nthe well-known fact that the Khazar rulers converted to Judaism. In itself\n\nthis tells you absolutely nothing about their marriage policies and the\n\norigins of their partners. I am all for controlled conjecture and\n\nspeculation, as anyone who has seen me here in DFA arguments knows. But the\n\nconjecture has to have some control to it if its to be useful -- that is, it\n\nhas to be able to suggest and guide an actual program of research, and to\n\nbe subject to change from the fruits of that research.\n\nLet me suggest a couple of lines of research to you\n\nWe know the Khazars were of Turkish origin. So, you might want to read\n\nabout what is known of Turkish marriage strategies of other, perhaps\n\nbetter-documented, Turkish groups. E.g. did Turkish rulers marry the\n\ndaughter of foreign rulers? What are the examples and the crcumstances?\n\nDid they marry within a small circle of select families? What are the\n\nexamples? I'm sure there is a lot of literature on this type of thing. The\n\nreason for looking at this type of question is that it helps set the\n\nmindset -- how willing, in general, were Turkish elites to marry\n\nexogamously? Did that change upon conversions (you might look at Turkish\n\ngroups that converted to Islam, for example)\n\nTo pursue the Jewish option specifically, you could look into the histories\n\nof leading Jews under contemporary Islam or Byzantium (more lkely the\n\nformer), and see what you can learn about their families. Keep an eye out\n\nfor Jews who got involved in Khazar policy in any way. See if you can\n\nactually trace Jewish threads that take you from (say) Baghdad to Itil.\n\nConversely, try to trace leading Khazars in middle east -- merchants,\n\nambassadors etc. Build up a prosopography of these individuals and see what\n\nyou learn about the nature of their genealogical networks.\n\nKevin Brooks can comment better than I on how easy such an exercise would\n\nbe -- how much has already been done, how much of the right types of sources\n\nare available in published form and in what languages. I would love to see\n\nthe results of such an effort. I guess its a major research project\n\nrequiring much training before it can even be attempted. But I think that's\n\nthe sort of thing you need to do to be able to take this discussion anywhere\n\nbeyond handwaving.\n\nChris\n\n\"Chris and Tom Tinney, Sr.\" <vcti...@dcn.davis.ca.us> wrote in message news:<3CA2BC24...@dcn.davis.ca.us>...\n\n> If we wish to deal in probabilities,\n\n> then it will be necessary to delve\n\n> into Jewish naming customs, as noted\n\n> by Pamela Fletcher Jones, The Jews\n\n> of Britain, A Thousand Years of\n\n> History. \"Though, on the whole, boys\n\n> had biblical names, most girls were\n\n> given Norman-French names, even as\n\n> late as the thirteenth century.\n\nThis is interesting, but it really does not provide any evidence for\n\nPlantagenet ancestory. You might consider whether these recorded\n\nnames represent the only names used by the individuals whether they\n\nhad hebrew names as well as \"norman-french\" names and whether the\n\nrecorded names for the boys are the hebrew forms of the \"biblical\"\n\nnames or the french forms of those names.

They were killed because they had\n\nscandinavian first names? Did they really have scandinavian first\n\nnames or were the names recorded for them names used for them by the\n\npeople of York because they found the names difficult to pronounce?\n\nWhat does the phrase minting and moneymaking concerns outside the\n\nJewish financial circles mena? Was their coinage issued for exclusive\n\nuse within the Jewish population? Did some Jews have a concession for\n\nminting coins for the use by the rulers of York?\n\n>\n\n> History shows that up to about the 1200\n\n> time period, England was closely tied to\n\n> France, and the continued use of Norman-\n\n> French names by the female Jewish\n\n> population shows more than a passing\n\n> interest in their Norman Nobility and\n\n> heritage.\n\nJews in the medieval period were highly dependent on nobles and\n\nroyalty for protection. These naming conventions might be tied to\n\nthese patron-client roles. It is an ambiguous clue at best and does\n\nnot give a good view of descent or family connection to Norman\n\nnobility.\n\n> Likewise, female Jewish naming patterns\n\n> in England suggest a greater desire to\n\n> remain part of the ruling secular\n\n> organization,\n\nExcept Jews were not part of the ruling secular organization.\n\nvidence indicates that the French\n\n> tradition was paramount in England\n\n> during the first three centuries after\n\n> the Conquest; thus, suggesting the real\n\n> continuation of the absorption of the\n\n> Jewish population within the fabric of\n\n> the English ruling class,\n\nExcept that the Jewish population regardless of their naming\n\nconvention were not absorbed into the fabric of the English ruling\n\nclass and were ultimately expelled from England for centuries.\n\nMy conclusions are: we know that from genetic traits among the Jews of\n\nEurope that they have non-semitic ancestors as well as semitic\n\nancestors. Blue eyes, red and blond hair are not unknown among the\n\nJews of Europe or their descendents in the Americas and Israel. That\n\nthere are jewish ancestors among the Christian peoples of Europe is\n\nalso well known. I think it likely that this extended back into\n\nmedieval times as well and their is some documentation of this. The\n\nquestion remains not whether or not the Plantagenets had jewish\n\nancestors or not, but whether they had any documented Jewish\n\nancestors. Without some compelling indicators as to specific\n\nancestors being of jewish descent or even rumors of jewish descent the\n\nissue genealogically speaking is mute.\n\nJews in late medieval times were typically considered in general to be\n\nstigmatized outsiders to normal society. In Spain where I know of\n\nChristian spaniards having jewish ancestry, that was the result of\n\nlarge scaled forced conversions. Spaniards without Jewish ancestry\n\nmarried into families whose forefathers had been converted from Islam\n\nand Judaism. Some of the families who had converted from Islam may\n\nhave centuries before been families who had converted to Islam during\n\nthe Moorish period. Such conversions no doubt occurred elsewhere in\n\nEurope. The conversion of a Christian to Judaism on the other hand\n\nwould have been an apostasy that would have been criminal throughout\n\nChristendom. So such conversions from Christian to Judaism given the\n\ndire risks involved would, if they occurred, have been exceedingly\n\nrare and not something one would want to document and make public so\n\nthat the inquisitors could sweep down on you. Jewish rabbis would of\n\ncourse have been loathe to conduct such a conversion because it would\n\nmake them also liable to prosecution and their community targets for\n\nattack. Given that medieval marriages were financial partnerships and\n\nnot love matches, only a rich jewish family would be worth the risk\n\nmarrying into and such a family would not want a pauper marrying into\n\ntheir house, a no name who would not be noticed, nor would a person of\n\nname and/or fortune be easily snuck into the synagogue. Thus it is\n\nlikely that most of the European ancestry of the Jews of Europe was\n\nprobably the result of illicit unions some voluntary and others the\n\nproduct of rape.\n\nshp...@comcast.net (Shawn Potter) wrote in message news:<7004aa4b.02032...@posting.google.com>...\n\n> Also, reference Vasmer's observation that Metropolitan Illarion called\n\n> Vladimir kagan.

I haven't found instances where Yaropolk was called kagan;\n\nbut, I'm not optimistic that this line of inquiry will be fruitful.\n\nIllarion's use of the title, if the only example of St. Vladimir being\n\ncalled kagan, doesn't establish a clear familial link between St.\n\nVladimir and the rulers of Khazaria.\n\nBy the way, Illarion's reliance on Hebrew Scriptures to explain\n\nChristian theology illustrates a point made by Irma Khainman--see my\n\nnote on this thread 2002-03-27 21:10:08 PST. I'm not persuaded by\n\nthis point by Khainman, though, because Christian theology is\n\nfundamentally linked to Hebrew Scriptures. Whether or not one branch\n\nof the church chooses to emphasize this link may stem from innumerable\n\nfactors, all unrelated to whether or not members of that church\n\ndescend from Judeans.\n\nShawn Potter\n\n----------\n\nTHE SERMON OF THE LAW OF MOSES GIVEN TO HIM BY GOD, AND OF THE GRACE\n\nAND TRUTH BROUGHT TO EARTH BY JESUS CHRIST, by Metropolitan Illarion\n\n(became metropolitan in 1051)\n\nBlessed be the God of Israel, the God of Christianity who visited his\n\npeople and brought them salvation. He did not disdain his creation\n\nwhich was for ages possessed by pagan darkness and by worship of the\n\ndevil, but he enlightened the Children of Abraham by giving them his\n\nLaw tablets, and later he saved all nations, sending them his Son, his\n\nGospel, and his baptism, and by giving them resurrection to eternal\n\nlife.\n\nLaw was the precursor and the servant of Grace and Truth. Grace and\n\nTruth were the servants of the future life and immortal life. Law led\n\nits people of the Old Testament toward the blessing of baptism, and\n\nbaptism led its sons to the life eternal. Moses and the prophets\n\nannounced the coming of Christ, but Christ and the Apostles announced\n\nresurrection and the future age.\n\nAnd what could the Law achieve? And what could Grace achieve? First\n\nwas the Law and then Grace. Hagar and Sarah are the pictures of Law\n\nand Grace: Hagar was a handmaid and Sarah was free. First comes the\n\nhandmaiden and then the free woman may come. And he who reads (the\n\nBible) must understand this. Abraham, since his youth, had Sarah for\n\nhis wife and she was free and not a slave, and so God decided before\n\nall ages to send his Son into the world that Grace might appear\n\nthrough him (but sent him to man only later). But Sarah was restrained\n\nfrom bearing children, since she was unfruitful. But she was not\n\nactually unfruitful, but was chosen by divine Providence to bear in\n\nher old age. The wisdom of God was not revealed to anyone, but\n\nconcealed from both angels and men. This wisdom was not shown, but was\n\nconcealed to be revealed at the end of the age.\n\nIt was Sarah who said unto Abraham: \"Behold now, the Lord has\n\nprevented me from bearing children; go in to my maid; it may be that I\n\nshall obtain children by her.\"\n\nAnd so the divine Grace (of the Son) announced to God, the Father:\n\n\"It is not yet my time for descending to the earth and to save the\n\nworld. Descend to Mount Sinai and give them the Law.\"\n\nAnd, just as Abraham did as Sarah told him and went into Hagar, so\n\nGod, the Father, did as he was told by the divine Grace and descended\n\nto Mount Sinai.\n\nAnd Hagar, the handmaid, bore from Abraham a servant (not a truly free\n\nman), and Abraham gave him the name Ishmael. And Moses brought from\n\nMount Sinai the Law and not the Grace, the shade and not the Truth.\n\nWhen Abraham and Sarah were old, God appeared to Abraham by the oaks\n\nof Mamre, as he sat at the door of his tent in the heat of the day.\n\nAnd he ran to meet him, and bowing low to the earth, he hastened into\n\nthe tent (to Sarah). And so, when the end of the age was nearing, God\n\nappeared to humankind, descended to the earth, and blessed the womb of\n\nthe Virgin. And he was received by the Immaculate Virgin into the tent\n\nof the flesh.\n\nAnd the Virgin said to the angel:\n\n\"Behold I am the handmaid of the Lord; let it be to me according to\n\nyour word.\"\n\nOnce the Lord gave Sarah to bear a child, and she begat Isaac, and the\n\nfree woman begat a free son. And, when once more our Lord visited\n\nhumankind, he appeared unknown and hidden from men and then was born\n\nGrace and Truth, but not the Law. And now it was the Son and not the\n\nservant.\n\nAnd the child grew up and was weaned; and Abraham made a great feast\n\non the day that Isaac was weaned. And when Christ was upon the earth\n\nGrace did not reveal Itself and Christ was hiding himself until he was\n\nthirty. And when he had grown and was weaned, then there, in the river\n\nJordan, Grace was revealed by a man. And our Lord invited many and\n\nmade a great feast and offered up the fatted calf of the age, His\n\nbeloved Son, Jesus Christ, and God then called to this feast many of\n\nheaven and earth and they the angels and men into one (Church). This\n\nblessed faith spreads now over the entire earth, and finally it\n\nreached the Russian nation. And, whereas the lake of the Law dried up,\n\nthe fount of the Gospel became rich in water and overflowed upon our\n\nland and reached us. And now, together with all Christians, we glorify\n\nthe Holy Trinity, while Judea remains silent.\n\nTHE EULOGY TO OUR KAGAN VLADIMIR.\n\nRome with voices panegyrical, praises Peter and Paul through whom they\n\ncame to believe in Jesus Christ the Son of God:\n\nAsia, Ephesus and Patmos praise John the Theologian;\n\nIndia praises Thomas;\n\nEgypt, Mark.\n\nAll lands, cities and men honour and glorify their teacher who brought\n\nthem the Orthodox Faith. Thus let us, through our own strength, humbly\n\npraise our teacher and mentor, the great Kagan of our land Vladimir,\n\nthe grandson of lgor of yore and son of glorious Sviatoslav, who ruled\n\nin their day with courage and valour, becoming famed in many lands for\n\ntheir victories and fortitude. And they did not reign in a poor and\n\nunknown land, but in Russia, which is known and celebrated by all to\n\nthe ends of the earth.\n\nA good attestation of your devotion, blessed one, is the Holy Church\n\nof the Blessed Virgin, the Mother of God, which you build on the\n\northodox foundation and where your valorous body now lays at rest and\n\nawaits the archangel's trumpet. A good and certain attestation is your\n\nson, George [Iaroslav's Christian name], whom God has made the heir to\n\nyour throne,\n\nwho does not destroy your laws, but confirms them,\n\nwho does not diminish works of piety, but extends them,\n\nwho does not undo, but strengthens,\n\nwho finishes that which you have left unfinished\n\neven as Solomon finished the works begun by David;\n\nwho has built a great and holy temple to God's omniscience\n\nthat it may hallow your city;\n\nwho has embellished with all manner of things beautiful,\n\nwith gold and silver and precious stones\n\nand with sacred vessels;\n\nso that the church is a wonder to all surrounding lands\n\nand so that the like cannot be found in all the northern land,\n\nnor in the east nor the west;\n\nwho has given your famous city of Kiev the crown of glory,\n\nwho has turned your city and its people\n\nto all-glorious Mother of God,\n\nwho is always ready to succour Christians\n\nand for whom he has built a church with doors of gold\n\nin the name of the first holy day of the Lord of the Annunciation,\n\nthat the veneration, which the archangel will offer to the Virgin,\n\nmay also be upon this city.\n\nTo her he speaks, saying:\n\n\"Rejoice, Blessed One, the Lord is with you!\"\n\nAnd to the city he speaks, saying:\n\n\"Rejoice, faithful city, the Lord is with you!\"\n\nArise from your grave, venerated prince,\n\nArise and shake off your sleep.\n\nYou are not dead,\n\nbut only sleep until the day of resurrection of all.\n\nArise! You are not dead,\n\nfor it is not right that you should die,\n\nfor you have believed in Christ, the Sustainer of the whole world.\n\nShake off your deep sleep\n\nand lift up your eyes\n\nthat you might see what honour the Lord has granted you,\n\nand you still live upon this earth,\n\nunforgotten through your sons.\n\nArise! Behold your child George,\n\nLook upon your beloved one,\n\nwhom God has brought forth from your loins.\n\nBehold him embellishing the throne of your land.\n\nRejoice and be of good cheer!\n\nBehold the pious wife of your son, Irina.\n\nBehold your grandchildren\n\nand your great-grandchildren.\n\nBehold how they live and how they are cared for by God.\n\nBehold how they preserve devotion in your tradition,\n\nhow they partake of the Sacraments of the Holy Church,\n\nhow they glorify Christ,\n\nhow they venerate before his Holy Name.\n\nBehold your city radiant with grandeur.\n\nBehold your blossoming churches,\n\nBehold Christianity flourishing.\n\nBehold your city gleaming,\n\nadorned with holy icons and\n\nfragrant with thyme,\n\npraising God and filling the air with sacred songs.\n\nAnd beholding all this, rejoice and be of good cheer, and praise the\n\nLord, the Creator of all which you have seen.\n\nSource: Pamiatniki dukhovnoi literatury vremeni velikogo kniazia\n\nIaroslava I-ogo, Moscow, 1844."
