        "text": "The discussion is here: https://www.academia.edu/s/d8918afd69 - please leave your comments! - Slides are here: https://www.academia.edu/104191075/ - Anastasia, the elder of three daughters of Yaroslav The Wise, the Grand Duke of Kyiv (Kiev), married the Hungarian prince Andrew when he lived in exile in Kyiv. Andrew was baptized in Kyiv according to the Byzantine Confession before he returned to Hungary with his Orthodox wife. He became a king with the name Andrew I and restored the Christian Hungarian State, which was founded by Saint Stephen (István) Ist the first king but was destroyed by pagan resurrections. The role of Kyiv was significant not only for the auxiliary troops who would be sent by Yaroslav the Wise but by the dynastic networking by the marriage. Andrew I and Anastasia settled Ruthenian monks of Byzantine confession in Visegrád [‘vishegraad’], at the royal residence, and in Tihany peninsula at the Lake Balaton, too; also, female nuns were settled in Tormova, a village in Transylvania, too; noteworthy, in a West-oriented Hungarian Kingdom which followed the Roman Catholic confession. Photo documentation of these Orthodox, Slavic monasteries will be presented, too. A previous version of this paper has already been presented in Lund, Sweden in the Seminar “Saints in the Slavic Christian world” (13 January 2022, that former presentation is accessible here: https://www.academia.edu/68069321), has yet not been published, and the following remarks also author’s further updates are to be included in this new paper in Leeds.\n\nSlides are accessible here: https://www.academia.edu/68014578 Conference website: https://www.ctr.lu.se/en/about-us/calendar/event/online-seminar-saints-slavic-christian-world-900-1400-0/ Anastasiya, the Kyivan Wife of Hungarian King Andrew I, and the Historical Background of Her Activity Anastasya, one of three daughters of Yaroslav The Wise, married on the Hungarian prince Andrew, when he lived in the exile in Kyiv. The name Andrew is of Slavic origin, referring to theapostle St. Andrew whose cult was very living in the Kyivan Rus'. We argue for the earlier date of the marriage, in contrary of those maintain the 1046th year for this marriage. Andrew had already been living in Kyiv, in the Christian spirit and marriage, before he returned to Hungary with his wife. If so, he grew up in the Christian spirit and Christian marriage, as well. His wife made impact on husband and the country, too, bringing Ruthenian monks to Visegrád [ 'vishegraad' ] , the town of the royal residence, and to Tihany, a peninsula at the Lake Balaton, too; and female nuns were brought to Tormova, village in Transylvania, too. Her active approach to the political life was proved after the death of husband, when she involved into the fights between the son and cousins for the throne; therefore, she could not be a passive wife during the reign of András I as well. Her impact on Andrew helped to restore and making stronger the Christian Hungarian State, founded by Saint Stephen (István) I but destroyed by the pagan resurrections. The role of Kyiv was significant in this aspect, too, not only for the auxiliary troops would be sent by Yaroslav The Wise.\n\nThe 1888 commemoration of the 900th anniversary of the Christianization of Rus’ in Kiev constitutes one of the great performances of Alexander III’s scenario of power. Participants gathered to celebrate St. Vladimir’s choice of Orthodox Christianity and the significance of Kiev in the Russian land. There on the empire’s periphery, they confronted the complex relationship between Kievan Rus’, Holy Rus’, the Russian nation, and the Russian Empire. The nationalizing idiom of Alexander III’s scenario of power sought to smooth out difference and forge a common, monologic myth, yet that scenario could not work without the all-Russian nation, which by definition implied difference.\n\nIn the Primary Chronicle from the 12th c. there can be found two mythical stories on the origin of the city of Kiev and the alleged Christian roots of Rus´: the journey of the apostle Andrew through the Slavic land, and St. Paul and his disciple Andronikos as the teachers of the Slavs and the Rus´. Only in the Book of Degrees from the 16th c. does the view exist that it was St. Andrew´s original purpose to go to the Rus´ian lands. The explanation for the change is that national policy in the 16th c. tried to depreciate the Greek link with Russia. In this paper we will show the ideological use of the texts.\n\nAnastasiya, Daughter of Yaroslav The Wise : the Kyivan Wife of Hungarian King Andrew I, and the Historical Background of Her Activity Anastasya, one of three daughters of Yaroslav The Wise, married on the Hungarian prince Andrew, when he lived in the exile in Kyiv.
