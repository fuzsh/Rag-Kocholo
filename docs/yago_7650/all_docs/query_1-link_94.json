Neptune standing left, holding small dolphin and trident, deviding large S - C\n\nMarcus Vipsanius Agrippa was one of the most powerful and influential men who lived during the early days of the Roman Empire. Agrippa was a statesman, general, and most important of all, a close friend and son-in-law of Augustus, the first Emperor of Rome. Agrippa aided Augustus greatly in his rise to power, and continued play an important role during the latter′s reign. In addition to the numerous victories that he won as Augustus′ general, Agrippa also initiated a number of building projects which contributed to the beauty and grandeur of Rome.\n\nIn Rome Neptune had only one temple. It stood near the Circus Flaminius, the Roman racetrack, in the southern part of the Campus Martius. It already existed in 206 BC. It appears on a coin struck by Gn. Domitius Ahenobarbus around 40 BC doubtless because of a restoration carried out by this personage. It contained a famous sculpture of a marine group by Scopas Minor. The Basilica Neptuni, was built on the Campus Martius and dedicated by Agrippa in honour of the naval victory of Actium.\n\ncf.

The name Kastabala was probably of Luwian origin. The city was captured by Achaemenid Empire and became part of the Cilician satrapy and then by Alexander the Great. During the Hellenistic age it was called Hieropolis. During the Roman Empire the city was a part of Cappadocia Province. But after the Cilician pirates were defeated, Tarkondimotos, a pardoned pirate leader, became the governor of the region. The city was important enough in the Roman province of Cilicia Secunda to become a suffragan of its capital Anazarbus′s Metropolitan Archbishopric, but would fade.\n\nBMC 1 ; SNG.von Aulock 5568 ; SNG.Copenhagen 141 ;\n\nZiegler 1273-6 ; SNG.Paris 2209 ; SNG Levante 1564\n\nDark patina.\n\nvf-\n\nweight 4,10gr. ; silver 18mm.\n\nobv. Male head (Triptolemos ?) right, wearing wreath\n\nof corn-ears and leaves within dotted border\n\nrev. Prancing horse right, Punis letter H ″het″ below, within wreath\n\nOriginally attributed to Hiempsal II of Numidia, this issue was firmly reattributed to the Carthaginians in Sicily (cf. R.R. Holloway, “Monete provenienti dagli scavi di Moragantina e già attribuite a Hiempsal II” in AIIN 7–8 [1961], pp. 35–7), and most likely to the mint of Akragas (cf. Burnett, Enna, pp. 12–3), when Akragas was occupied by the Carthaginians. Although Burnett suggested that this issue was struck no later than 211 BC, Walker′s analysis of three Sicilian hoards conclusively dates this coinage to circa 213–210 BC, during the Second Punic War. At the outbreak of the war in 218, Akragas was a loyal ally of Rome, but was captured by the Carthaginians in 214. Despite attempts by Rome to retake the city, the Punic garrison held out for nearly four years, until a dispute between the Carthaginians and their Numidian mercenaries led to the betrayal of Akragas to the forces of M. Valerius Laevinus. Unlike the ubiquitous Siculo-Punic coins struck at Entella, the die study of the issues a Akragas shows that the present issue was of a very short duration. Although they were struck from well-executed dies, the hoard coins show that they were not struck with great care, which is not unusual for coins issued in the midst of war. As such, well-centred, high grade pieces like the present specimen are exceptional.

Head of Ketos left with gaping mouth\n\nrev. Incuse geomatric pattern\n\nOn the obverse of these Greek tetrobols from the ancient city of Kindya in Caria is the head of a sea monster known as a Ketos with its tongue protruding. On the other side is a geometric pattern within an incuse square.\n\nIn Greek mythology, both Perseus and Herakles killed a Ketos (Latin cetus). When Kassiopeia boasted that her daughter Andromeda was more beautiful than the Nereids, this invoked the wrath of Poseidon who sent the sea monster Ketos to attack Æthiopia. Upon consulting a wise oracle, Kepheus and Kassiopeia were told to sacrifice Andromeda to Ketos. They had Andromeda chained to a rock near the ocean so that Ketus could devour her. Perseus found Andromeda chained to the rock and learned of her plight. When Ketos emerged from the ocean to devour Andromeda, Perseus managed to slay it. In one version, Perseus drove his sword into Ketos′ back. In another version, Perseus used Medusa′s severed head to turn Ketos to stone.\n\nSNG.Kayhan 812 ; Rosen Collection 617 ; Asyut Hoard 687 ;\n\nHistoria Numorum Online 213 (Halikarnassos) ; Keckman 920 ;\n\nSNG.Ashmolean 295-315 ; Sear- ; Ashton/Konuk 2 ;\n\nSNG.Copenhagen 356 ; SNG.von Aulock 2340 ;\n\nKagan/Kritt ″the coinage of Kindya″, NC 1995, 103\n\nVery remarkable cointype in an wonderful condition.\n\nvf\n\nweight 26,91gr. ; bronze Ø 31mm.\n\nobv.

First the war between Antony and Octavian against Brutus and then, ultimately, between Antony and Octavian themselves. The coinage of this issue begins in the early 40s using purely Greek denominations, the chalkous, the dichalkon, the trichalkon, the tetrachalkon and the hexachalkon and continues until circa 35 B.C. Then the three lower denominations drop out and Roman denominations appear. The tetrachalkon continues as a semis, the hexachalkon as an as, and new larger coins, dupondii and sestertii are introduced; this series ends circa 31 B.C., when coins began to bu struck in the name of C. Julius Eurycles. Only a few pieces recorded worldwide. Extremely rare.\n\nBMC- ; Weber collection- ; McClean- ; SNG.

Hare running right, around MESSENION, dotted border.\n\nThe obverse of this tetradrachm depicts a charioteer driving a chariot drawn by two mules (an apene). Apene races were first held at the Olympic Games around 500 BC. The tyrant Anaxilas, apparently had an Olympic mule-team victory in 480 BC and he commemorated it with this coin type. The design is associated with Messana and it was kept after Anaxilas′ death in 476 BC. The reverse depicts a hare jumping with the inscription ″MESSENION″ (of the Messenians). The hare on the reverse may symbolize the speed of Anaxilas′ chariot, or it may symbolize some association with fertility and abundance. The hare may also be on the coin simply because hare hunts were a favorite aristocratic pastime.\n\nBMC 14 ; Caltabiano 77 ; Babelon, Traité, Pl.LXXII, 13 ;\n\nSNG Copenhagen 393var. ; SNG ANS 320var. ; McClean 2378var. ;\n\nGulbenkian- ; Jameson - ; Pozzi 1088 (same obverse die) ; Sear 842 ;\n\nHGC 2, 779\n\nvery attractive for this early type\n\nvf+/vf"
