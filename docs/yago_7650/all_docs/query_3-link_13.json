To her, what seemed little, To others was much; Her cooking and baking and loving touch. Her hands honed to quilting like an artist brush stroke. Weaving memories for many With each pull strand and poke. Her love for her flowers, watching birds as they flew, Were liken to her children, she loved as they grew. She's now free at long last, the angel Louise. Flying free as those birds, gently riding the breeze.\n\nMadison Wisconsin State Journal December 2, 2008 - Louise M (Schlieckau) White obituary\n\nDeath6 June 2011Dwayne O.
