        "text": "The discussion is here: https://www.academia.edu/s/d8918afd69 - please leave your comments. - Anastasia, the elder of three daughters of Yaroslav The Wise, the Grand Duke of Kyiv (Kiev), married the Hungarian prince Andrew when he lived in exile in Kyiv. Andrew was baptized in Kyiv according to the Byzantine Confession before he returned to Hungary with his Orthodox wife. He became a king with the name Andrew I and restored the Christian Hungarian State, which was founded by Saint Stephen (István) Ist the first king but was destroyed by pagan resurrections. The role of Kyiv was significant not only for the auxiliary troops who would be sent by Yaroslav the Wise but by the dynastic networking by the marriage. Andrew I and Anastasia settled Ruthenian monks of Byzantine confession in Visegrád [‘vishegraad’], at the royal residence, and in Tihany peninsula at the Lake Balaton, too; also, female nuns were settled in Tormova, a village in Transylvania, too; noteworthy, in a West-oriented Hungarian Kingdom which followed the Roman Catholic confession. Photo documentation of these Orthodox, Slavic monasteries will be presented, too. A previous version of this paper has already been presented in Lund, Sweden in the Seminar “Saints in the Slavic Christian world” (13 January 2022, that former presentation is accessible here: https://www.academia.edu/68069321), has yet not been published, and the following remarks also author’s further updates are to be included in this new paper in Leeds.\n\nIn the Primary Chronicle from the 12th c. there can be found two mythical stories on the origin of the city of Kiev and the alleged Christian roots of Rus´: the journey of the apostle Andrew through the Slavic land, and St. Paul and his disciple Andronikos as the teachers of the Slavs and the Rus´. Only in the Book of Degrees from the 16th c. does the view exist that it was St. Andrew´s original purpose to go to the Rus´ian lands. The explanation for the change is that national policy in the 16th c. tried to depreciate the Greek link with Russia. In this paper we will show the ideological use of the texts.\n\nThe 1888 commemoration of the 900th anniversary of the Christianization of Rus’ in Kiev constitutes one of the great performances of Alexander III’s scenario of power. Participants gathered to celebrate St. Vladimir’s choice of Orthodox Christianity and the significance of Kiev in the Russian land. There on the empire’s periphery, they confronted the complex relationship between Kievan Rus’, Holy Rus’, the Russian nation, and the Russian Empire. The nationalizing idiom of Alexander III’s scenario of power sought to smooth out difference and forge a common, monologic myth, yet that scenario could not work without the all-Russian nation, which by definition implied difference.\n\nThis article analyses the main traits of reception of Latin (Roman Catholic) Christendom in Kievan Rus', drawing from the notion of its confessional »otherness« in relation to the Eastern Orthodox norm. The mentioned reception is studied according to the East Slavic narrative sources written at the end of the eleventh and beginning of the twelfth centuries, i.e., directly after the »Great Schism« (1054) between Constantinople and Rome. The author of this article accentuates the complexity of the Rus' attitude towards Latin Christians on various levels: 1) upholding the official Orthodoxy, following the Byzantine doctrinal themes as adopted in Church Slavic polemical literature, while, simultaneously, 2) respecting practical considerations of dynastic ties between the East Slavic political elite and ruling families of the neighbouring Latin world, 3) and venerating particular Latin saints. In this respect, special consideration is given to the travel diary on the Holy Land titled Life and Pilgrimage of Daniel, the Hegumen of the Land of Rus', serving as a prime example of encountering confessional differences. Daniel's Pilgrimage is placed within the political and cultural context after the First Crusade during the Frankish rule over Palestine; it brings some valuable testimonies about the »Latin-Greek« relations in the Kingdom of Jerusalem as perceived by an educated ecclesiastical traveller, himself originating from an Eastern Orthodox environment. Daniel's thematization of his confessional »other« in the Holy Land reveals a similar ambiguity in the case of Rus' itself: on a declarative level, the polemical writings of the Kievan metropolitans testify about a negative position on the »Latin heresies«; on the other hand, common veneration of particular saints, such as Olaf of Norway or Magnus of Orkney, and decisions of the East Slavic princes confirm the permanence of intercultural contacts and pragmatic willingness to cooperate with the neighbouring Catholic polities (Sweden, Poland, Hungary) in forming dynastic marriages and military alliances.\n\nThis article discusses the texts included in a new compilation entitled Sources of Slavic Pre-Christian Religion produced by scholars at the University Complutense in Madrid, Spain. This compilation responds to the challenges of previous historiographical difficulties inherent in the indirect sources available and in the previous incomplete collections of sources. Thus, this is the first work to consolidate all known sources on pagan practices of all the Slavic peoples—East, West, and South—and to include all known provenances of sources, including Latin, Greek, Slavonic, Old Icelandic, Arabic, and Persian. The resulting compilation reveals a more complex and sophisticated pre-Christian religion than previously assumed. In this article, Santos Marinas explains the reasoning behind the selection of the texts for this compilation and offers notable examples of some of the included sources on Slavic pre-Christian practices, particularly from Byzantine and Latin texts, that provide new insights into the sacred practices of the early medieval Slavic peripheries of Christendom."
