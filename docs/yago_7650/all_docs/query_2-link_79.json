With time Johnathan began to sense the same calling to be a part of planting and growing healthy, Bible-teaching churches. He met Stephanie when she was on a short-term mission trip where they connected over both having a passion for missions and soon were married.\n\nJohnathan continues to pastor and disciple the people of Ternopil and has a music ministry called Room For More that is focused on telling the gospel story through various creative avenues.\n\nThe Markeys are working with leadership that has been established in the church to continue encouraging them to disciple others and meet the needs of people in their city. Their music is a powerful tool and they desire to use it to help people think theologically and biblically. They want to continue to produce gospel-centered, quality music and also provide a platform for other artists to get their music out and collaborate on projects.\n\nJohnathan's parents were missionaries and when he was 6, they moved to Kyiv, Ukraine in 1992 and planted a Calvary Chapel.

During that first summer, God called him to minister to the people of Ukraine and he moved to there in January of 2002. He married Lena in Sept. 2003. God began laying a burden on their hearts to start a grace-teaching church. In March 2005 they moved to Svitlovodsk, Lena’s home town of 50,000. Benjamin began a Bible study in their apartment that June. Since then Jesus has been faithful to grow Calvary Chapel Svitlovodsk and to change lives by the power of His grace. The church continues to grow and reach out to the community with the Gospel today. Benjamin serves as lead pastor of Calvary Chapel Svitlovodsk and occasionally travels as a speaker around Ukraine.\n\nTheir vision is to see more and more Gospel-centered churches being planted across Ukraine and the whole world. In February 2014, Calvary Chapel Svitlovodsk sent its first missionaries out.\n\nBenjamin took his first trip to Ukraine in 2001 with Calvary Chapel Bible College of Indianapolis.

While he made a confession of faith and was baptized when he was 10, he did not have a personal relationship with Christ until he was older. As a teenager, he had many doubts about what he believed, but God met him in a real and personal way and he finally understood the Gospel for the first time. Understanding the Good News of the Gospel changed his life and led him into missionary work.\n\nIsaac now serves with Athletes in Action to help equip coaches around the world to leverage their platform of sports to make disciples, partner with churches to help them use sports to minister to their community, and send soccer teams globally to assist international missions efforts.\n\nGrowing up as a pastor's kid, Isaac was involved in the church at a young age.
