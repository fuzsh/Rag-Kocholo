Fehér or Katolikus András or Endre; c. 1015 - Zirc, before 6 December 1060) was King of Hungary from 1046 to 1060. He descended from a younger branch of the Árpád dynasty. After spending fifteen years in exile, he ascended the throne during an extensive revolt of the pagan Hungarians. He strengthened the position of Christianity in the Kingdom of Hungary and successfully defended its independence against the Holy Roman Empire.\n\nHis efforts to ensure the succession of his son, Solomon, resulted in the open revolt of his brother, Béla. Béla dethroned Andrew by force in 1060. Andrew suffered severe injuries during the fighting and died before his brother was crowned king.\n\nMarried/ Related\n\nto:\n\n‎ Anastasia I of Kiev‏‎\n\nBorn ‎± 1023\n\nDied ‎between 1074 and 1096‎, 72 or 73 years\n\nChild:\n\n1.\n\n‎ Adelaide of Hungary‏‎ 3)\n\nBorn ‎± 1040\n\nDied ‎27 Jan 1062‎, approximately 22 years 3)"
