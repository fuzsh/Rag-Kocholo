It is a no-man’s land of single mothers and fatherless children-where angry, alienated youth control the streets. Into this battlefield comes Sophie Morrison, a young doctor visiting a patient in Acid Row. Little does she know that she is entering the home of a known paedophile. And with reports circulating that a tormented child called Amy has disappeared, the vigilantes are out in force. Soon Sophie is trapped at the centre of a terrifying siege, held hostage by a violent psychopath. Whipped to a frenzy by unsubstantiated rumour, the mob unleashes its hatred-against authority . the law . and ‘the pervert’. ‘Protecting Amy’ becomes the catch-all defence for the terrible events that follow. And if murder is part of it, then so be it. But is Amy really missing?"
