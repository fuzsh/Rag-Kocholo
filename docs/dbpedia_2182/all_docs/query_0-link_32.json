Into this battlefield comes Sophie Morrison, a young doctor visiting a patient in Acid Row. Little does she know that she is entering the home of a known paedophile.and with reports circulating that a tormented child called Amy has disappeared, the vigilantes are out in force. Soon Sophie is trapped at the centre of a terrifying siege, with a man she has come to despise. Whipped to a frenzy by the unsubstantiated rumour, the mob unleashes its hatred against authority.the law.'the pervert'. 'Protecting Amy' becomes the catch-all defence for the terrible events that follow - and if murder is part of it, then so be it. But is Amy really missing? The Sunday Express has written: Minette Walters has stormed her way into crime fiction. With her first three books she has claimed the highest accolades the crime writing world can bestow. A seductive writer with an imagination that makes her dangerous to know.",
