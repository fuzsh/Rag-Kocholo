A no-man's land of single mothers and fatherless children - where angry, alienated youth controls the streets. Into this battleground comes Sophie Morrison, a young doctor visiting a patient in Acid Row. Little does she know that she is entering the home of a known pedophile ...and with reports circulating that a tormented child called Amy has disappeared, the vigilantes are out in force. Soon Sophie is trapped at the center of a terrifying siege, with a man she has come to despise. Whipped to a frenzy by unsubstantiated rumor, the mob unleashes its hatred. Against authority ...the law ...and the 'pervert'. 'Protecting Amy' becomes the catch-all defense for the terrible events that follow. And if murder is part of it, then so be it. But is Amy really missing?",
