        "meta_description": "Author: Minette Walters Release date: Jan 2007 Audience: General Country of Publication: United Kingdom Imprint: Pan Books Interest Age: From 18 years Format: Paperback Pages: 475 ISBN: 9780330454889 Language: English Description  HER BLISTERING NEW CRIME THRILLER Acid Row. The name the beleaguered inhabitants give to their 'sink' estate. A noman's land of single mothers and fatherless children - where angry, alienated youth controls the streets. Into this battleground comes Sophie Morrison, a young doctor visiting a patient in Acid Row. Little does she know that she is entering the home of a known paedophile...and with reports circulating that a tormented child called Amy has disappeared, the vigilantes are out in force. Soon Sophie is trapped at the centre of a terrifying siege, with a man she has come to despise. Whipped to a frenzy by unsubstantiated rumour, the mob unleashes its hatred. Against authority...the law...and the 'pervert'. 'Protecting Amy' becomes the catch-all defence for the terrible events that follow. And if murder is part of it, then so be it. BUT IS AMY REALLY MISSING?  Author Biography  Minette Walters is England's bestselling female crime writer. She has won the CWA John Creasey Award for best first crime novel, the Edgar Allan Poe Award for best crime novel published in America and two CWA Gold Daggers for Fiction. Minette Walters writes full-time and lives in Dorset with her husband.",
