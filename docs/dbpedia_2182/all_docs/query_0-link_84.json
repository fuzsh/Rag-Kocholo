OF THE DOOM! Hit play on any of those, and you just know your brain’s about to be melted by a full-on aural assault. The work of Czech rockers Acid Row, those three songs don’t disappoint, particularly the latter; it also happens to open their latest album, ‘Poisoned Mind’, a rip-snorting listen that obviously features an evil rabbit and a hand holding a skull on the cover.\n\nYet despite riffs as thick as sludge, booming drums, and throaty growls flowing into your ears, what’s most impressive about the three-piece is that they don’t simply layer on the doom metal elements with a trowel – there’s subtlety here. There are nods to grunge, psychedelia, and punk; at times, it’s almost a bit prog rock. ‘Grandchildren Of The Doom’ has an interlude that’s reminiscent of Led Zeppelin’s folksy mysticism; the title track is a poised, gently spooky number that features intricate guitar arpeggios and no drums."
