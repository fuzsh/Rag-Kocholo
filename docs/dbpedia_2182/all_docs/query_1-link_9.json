This is her eighth novel and her work has been translated into thirty two languages. Acid Row is a great thriller. \"Acid Row\" is the name that the residents of a crime-ridden, decaying housing project have given to their home. Gangs control the streets and the place is a clear danger zone. Into this battleground comes a young doctor named Sophie Morrison to visit a patient. She does not know that she is entering the home of a known pedophile. Reports are circulating that a child has disappeared and the vigilantes are out in force. Sophie is trapped in the middle of all this with a man who can and will harm her. We are pleased to send pictures on request."
