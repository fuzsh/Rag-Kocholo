        "text": "Acid Row. The name the beleaguered inhabitants give to their 'sink' estate.\n\nA no-man's land of single mothers and fatherless children - where angry, alienated youth controls the streets. Into this battleground comes Sophie Morrison, a young doctor visiting a patient in Acid Row. Little does she know that she is entering the home of a known paedophile . . . and with reports circulating that a tormented child called Amy has disappeared, the vigilantes are out in force. Soon Sophie is trapped at the centre of a terrifying siege, with a man she has come to despise. Whipped to a frenzy by unsubstantiated rumour, the mob unleashes its hatred.\n\nAgainst authority . . . the law . . . and the 'pervert'. 'Protecting Amy' becomes the catch-all defence for the terrible events that follow. And if murder is part of it, then so be it.\n\nBut is Amy really missing?\n\nFilled with suspense and shattering revelations, Acid Row is a taut psychological thriller from crime queen Minette Walters."
