Not price-clipped. Particularly and surprisingly well-preserved; tight, bright, clean and especially sharp-cornered.; 8vo 8\" - 9\" tall; 343 pages; Physical description: 343 p. : 2 maps ; 24 cm. Summary: Acid Row is the ironic name given to their home by the luckless inhabitants of a sink estate. Disenfranchised, dangerous youths roam the streets and into this no-man's land of one-parent families comes Sophie Morrison, a young doctor visiting a patient. But she is unaware that she is entering the home of a paedophile known to the police. When reports circulate that a disturbed child called Amy has disappeared, Sophie finds herself caught between dangerous vigilantes and a man she dislikes intensely. But is Amy really missing? Within its first pages, this book marks itself out the kind of crime novel in which social significance is every bit as important as the page-turning imperatives of a thriller, and the psychology of the characters and the problems of modern life are central. The use of Sophie as the protagonist is a brilliant stroke. And Walters keeps the cutting-edge aspects of her narratives to the fore, cleverly wrong-footing the reader at every turn: although we think we have decided how we feel about the endangered paedophile and the vigilantes, she never allows these aspects to overwhelm the nagging, disturbing power of her narrative. This is probably Walters most authoritative and compelling novel to date. Genre: Crime fiction -- Thriler -- Suspense. 1 Kg. - Acid Row / Minette Walters",
