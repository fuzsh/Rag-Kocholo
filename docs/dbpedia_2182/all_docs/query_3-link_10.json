        "text": "Iron Butterfly’s “In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida” opens in a cyclone of electric organs while bright keys whisk up a storm of treacherous drum hits and hypnotizing strings. The song is the definitive rock standard. Unabridged, it is 17 minutes of pure rock and roll ecstasy.\n\nWhile the lyrics sound exotic, complex, and drenched in mind-expanding meaning, they’re not. But damn is it a good song.\n\nVideos by American Songwriter\n\nThe Origins\n\nThe occult rock outfit Iron Butterfly released “In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida” on their 1968 sophomore album of the same name.\n\nFrontman Doug Ingle reportedly penned the song while he was properly wine drunk. When the intoxicated vocalist-organist played the song for the band’s drummer Ron Bushy, his words come out just as sloshed. Bushy was jotting down the lyrics as Ingle performed, however things got lost in translation. The drummer apparently misheard the slurred phrase “in the Garden of Eden” and wrote “In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida” in its place.\n\nThe song was intended to be called “In the Garden of Eden,” but even though it was misinterpreted, “In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida” seemed meant to be. The band kept the name as it sounded mystical and spiritual rolling off the tongue, a perfect pairing with the song’s ominous, but enrapturing arrangement.\n\nThe Lyrics\n\nAs far as the song’s meaning goes, it’s simple. “In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida” is about love, a feeling that can be equally as confounding as the song’s name itself. With its few lyrics, the song says so much with so little. It is a reassertion of the affections the narrator feels for a significant other. Against a backdrop of smokey psychedelia the song plays:\n\nIn-a-gadda-da-vida, honey\n\nDon’t you know that I’m loving you?\n\nIn-a-gadda-da-vida, baby\n\nDon’t you know that I’ll always be true?\n\nWith the affirmation, the singer asks for the same from his lover. The song continues to build in a dizzying frenzy as the heart-racing question is asked:\n\nOh, won’t you come with me\n\nAnd a-take my hand?\n\nOh, won’t you come with me\n\nAnd a-walk this land?\n\nPlease take my hand\n\nThe 17-minute version then goes into the jam of all jams, a 15-minute breakaway of head-swimming acid rock. The song then closes, repeating the same sparse lines against a hefty musical backdrop:\n\nIn-a-gadda-da-vida, honey\n\nDon’t you know that I’m loving you?\n\nIn-a-gadda-da-vida, baby\n\nDon’t you know that I’ll always be true?\n\nOh, won’t you come with me\n\nAnd a-take my hand?\n\nOh, won’t you come with me\n\nAnd a-walk this land?\n\nPlease take my hand\n\n(Photo by Michael Ochs Archives/Getty Images)"
