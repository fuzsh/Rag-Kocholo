        "text": "Acid Row by Minette Walters\n\nThe name the beleaguered inhabitants give to their 'sink' estate, a no-man's land of single mothers and fatherless children, where angry, alienated youth control the streets.\n\nInto this battlefield comes Sophie Morrison, a young doctor visiting a patient in Acid Row. Little does she know that she is entering the home of a known paedophile...and with reports circulating that a tormented child called Amy has disappeared, the vigilantes are out in force...\n\nSoon Sophie is trapped at the centre of a terrifying siege, with a man she has come to despise. Whipped to a frenzy by the unsubstantiated rumour, the mob unleashes its hatred against authority...the law...'the pervert'. 'Protecting Amy' becomes the catch-all defence for the terrible events that follow - and if murder is part of it, then so be it.\n\nBut is Amy really missing?\n\nThe Sunday Express has written: Minette Walters has stormed her way into crime fiction. With her first three books she has claimed the highest accolades the crime writing world can bestow... A seductive writer with an imagination that makes her dangerous to know.\n\nFormat: Paperback | 352 pages\n\nDimensions: 152 x 230mm | 470g\n\nPublication Date: 01 Nov 2001\n\nPublisher: Allen & Unwin\n\nPublication City/Country: Sydney, Australia\n\nEdition Number: 1\n\nISBN10: 1865086282\n\nISBN13: 9781865086286\n\nCondition: Like New\n\nA book that looks new but has been read.
