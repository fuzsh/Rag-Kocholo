        "text": "ACID ROW\n\nBy Minette Walters\n\nPutnam, $24.95, 339 pp\n\nReviewed by JEAN HELLER\n\nLondon's Bassindale Estate sounds as if it should be a wonderful place to live, but it is exactly the opposite. It is a closed neighborhood that houses the most unfortunate of the city's underclass. Drugs and violence abound. When word gets around that the government has housed a pedophile there under an assumed name, the worst elements of life in the place known as Acid Row combine with an explosive force.\n\nThe spark is a police hunt for a 10-year-old girl, believed to have been abducted by a pedophile. Some of the residents of Acid Row believe the sex offender in their midst must have her, dead or alive, and they are determined to exact vigilante justice.\n\nBritish writer Minette Walters is one of the best at suspense fiction, and everything she does well comes into play in her new novel, Acid Row. Even the minor characters are fully formed and believable, compelling even. The major characters are beautifully wrought.\n\nA petulant health care visitor, Fay Baldwin, learns about the pedophile and leaks word of his presence because she is angry with a doctor, Sophia Morrison, who is helping strip Fay of her duties and her patients. Sophia's motives are an act of kindness toward the patients but a threat to Fay's job and pension.\n\nThe news of the pedophile prompts some of the mothers who live in Acid Row to organize a peaceful protest march. What they can't foresee is that the nastier kids who live in the neighborhood, bored and frenzied by the summer heat, will piggyback a full-scale riot on the demonstration. In their drug- and beer-induced rage, they intend to kill the sex offender.\n\nSophia, off duty and headed for a meeting with her boyfriend, is asked by her supervisor to make one final stop in Acid Row to check on an older man who is having difficulty breathing. As luck would have it, the apartment is the one shared by the pedophile and his vicious father. The father takes Sophia hostage as the riot develops, and it quickly becomes clear why the son grew up to become a sociopath.\n\nInto this mess walks Jimmy James, fresh out of prison for non-violent crimes. He has come back to Acid Row to live with his fiance and her family, who have showed him more kindness and affection than his own ever did. When Jimmy finds a policewoman seriously injured in an elevator, his first instinct is to run. But he returns to help her when he realizes he has left his fingerprint on the elevator button and could be charged with the assault.\n\nThe police enlist Jimmy to help free Sophia, something they cannot do because every entrance to Acid Row is barricaded and manned by crazed, drugged young men. Jimmy soon learns that some of the elderly shut-ins condemned to live in Acid Row have created an internal communications system for support, a matrix he can use to rescue Sophia and his own family. Meanwhile, the hunt for the abducted girl continues, taking some bizarre twists and exposing some grotesque relationships along the way.\n\nAcid Row is a superb achievement, certain to enhance Walters' reputation in the United States.\n\nJean Heller is the author of the mystery-thrillers, Handyman and Maximum Impact (Forge)."
