        "text": "About The Book\n\nInnocent Victims contains two chilling novellas about seemingly normal people driven to commit the most heinous crimes imaginable. Chickenfeed is a crackling tale based on the true story of the “chicken farm murder” in East Sussex in 1924. Although Norman Thorne never confessed to killing his girlfriend, he was tried and hanged for the crime. Told from the points of view of Elsie and Norman, Walters creates a suspenseful tale of fiction based on fact.\n\nThe Tinder Box is the story of Patrick O’Riordan, a man arrested for the brutal murder of two women. As shock turns to fury, the village residents unite against the O’Riordan family. But neighbor Siobhan Lavenham remains convinced that Patrick is innocent. Jeopardizing her own position within the community, she stands firmly in defense of the O’Riordan name.\n\nPraise\n\n“A Walters novel is like no other. She bases her books on facts [and] embosses with her own painstaking research and fertile imagination.” —Pittsburgh Post-Gazette\n\n“The Tinder Box is a compelling tale of prejudice and gossip [where] everything falls into place to produce a shockingly different picture than expected.” —Publishers Weekly"
