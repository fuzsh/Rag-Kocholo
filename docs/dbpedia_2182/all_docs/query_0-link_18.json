        "text": "April 3, 2015\n\nSet in 2001 at a time when the News of the World was threatening to print names and addresses of all paedophiles in the country, trying to make us believe that we didn’t really know who our neighbours were, this is a story about mob psychology. When residents of a sink estate get word that a newcomer is in fact a convicted paedophile, coupled with the fact that a local 10 year old girl is missing, tempers soon start to flare. The actual storyline is pretty good, it really kept me interested and gripped me. We know fairly early on that there will be three deaths in the story, and I really wanted to know who was and who wasn’t going to survive.\n\nI did have a few reservations about it. I thought the depiction of Melanie, the smoking and drinking pregnant single mum of two with a heart of gold came just a little bit too close to being patronising to be true. I would have liked to have seen her character toned down just a little bit. Some of the dialogue was just a little bit “off”, and didn’t fit the characters and their upbringing at all. As for Barry and Kimberley, the stereotypical clinically obese fat teenagers, well at least they weren’t in it that much!\n\nI have seen a lot of 1 star reviews for this book and whilst I did have issues with it, I don’t think it was “that” bad. I certainly enjoyed the storyline anyway.\n\nDecember 7, 2008\n\nAnother pot boiler from my new favorite author. Ms Walters is able to manage multiple concurrent streams of narrative and keep the reader vitaly involved in each thread. In this one, a word spoken in anger at a most inappropriate time leads to an expolsion of violence directed at a pedophile that was recently moved into a poor neighborhood. Unfortunately for all, the pedophile in question had nothing to do with the incident that incited the mob. But the mob psychology takes over, the neigborhood becomes an armed fortress, the police are kept at bay, and tragedy ensues. Meanwhile the DCI assigned to the case of the missing child is desparately trying to track her down before any harm comes to her. Suspicion focuses on the girl's father and on his business associate who has demonstrated a certain liking for women who look like young girls, many of whom resemble the missing girl. Throw in a policewoman injured in a routine police call and who is trapped inside the aforementioned fortress, and a visiting health practicioner being held hostage by the pedophile and his equally perverted father, and this becomes a real nail-biter. This reader finds it easy to insert himself into the story as an interested observer. A most enjoyable read.\n\nFebruary 11, 2013\n\nOw, avert your eyes. Such very bad dialogue! Such cardboard characters! Quite shocking. Here we have a novel which tries really hard to turn today's headline into a fast-paced insightful, gritty yet ultimately inspiring novel but drastically fails on every page. Minette Walters does not appear to have first hand experience of how the unrespectable working class actually talk, whether black or white, so she makes it up... It sounds more like an Ealing comedy, if they were still makeing them in the 1980s. And there's page after page of it.... That must man the author, her partner, her agent and her publisher all thought this stuff was okay. She's surrounded by idiots! minette, save yourself! Leave them all now!\n\nWhere do you begin with Acid Row? Every scene we've seen before - the angry crowds, the hostage taken, the subtle police interrogation, the crisis which brings out the best and the worst in people...and every character is a huge cliché the size of a dirigible with the word CLICHE written in shocking pink on the sides - the frail old woman who turns out to be feisty (\"You've been a very bad influence on me, Jimmy. I'm swearing, I'm party to crimes, and I haven't felt so useful in years!\"), the misunderstood paedophile, the low-life teenagers. But there's one character who isn't a cliché at all. You never came across anyone like him. It's that not so very reluctant hero Jimmy Jones, the giant black guy, very large, friendly in a deadpan sort of way, and willing to have a go at anything - running back into burning houses to rescue known sex offenders, carrying unconscious people across his shoulders, and all the time being sensitive to old folks and little kids.\n\nThe \"Two months later\" chapter at the end puts the tin hat on the whole thing, where Jimmy and the feisty old lady have a good chuckle about their crazy wild adventure, just the way they used to in the last scene of any American TV show of the 60s and 70s. A few wry comments, a few lessons learned. Here's the lesson I learned : steer clear of Minette Walters!\n\nJuly 12, 2016\n\nYou can read it today, especially in America, and it still be relevant.\n\nJuly 24, 2020\n\nAcid Row is one of those books where I went in blind, unsure what I was going to receive. At first, I was unsure about it. It had me curious, but I wasn’t quite connecting to it. As the story progressed, however, I quickly found myself addicted.\n\nWith multiple elements introduced throughout, this one gripped me in a number of ways. I was desperate to see how each of the elements played out, curious to see how things developed. There were some elements that were never played out in full, that left me wanting, but they did keep me addicted. There were some elements that were predictable, some details that went in unexpected ways, but all kept me hooked and in need of answers.\n\nWithout a doubt, this has me curious about other books by Minette Walters.\n\nMarch 21, 2014\n\nWalters is at her best in exploring the banality of criminal activity and intent -- and in this book, once again, she shines. In pursuing the leads to find a missing 10-year-old girl, the reader is led into a maze of inter-connections which is at once astounding, predictable, and tragic. I don't know how Walters manages to weave all three into one mundane little crime, but she reveals herein she has a masterful grasp of the depraved indifference that men and women often demonstrate towards each other. Clever little book -- which sneaks out from the reeds and pounces on you unawares. At first glance, her novel may seem quite pedestrian, but think about it a little, and you'll see she's absolutely brilliant!\n\nSeptember 22, 2011\n\nAfter having adored other books by this writer, I was saving Acid Row for a treat. Each book she writes is different, but reliably excellent in terms of pacing, structure, characters, and plot elements, and there is always a very satisfying payoff. This book was a major disappointment in each of these areas and more. I couldn't believe Minette Walters wrote it.\n\nInteresting characters (good and bad) were created and set aside. Intrigues were established and never developed. Paragraphs were wasted on second-string pasteboard types who didn't do much, and what they did was not credible. The police involvement in both story lines was highly unrealistic. Race and class characterizations were extremely clumsy and simplistic, as were the criminals themselves. Some jarringly anachronistic media/culture references played a significant role. Also: Walters usually adds a leavening of grace, humor, romance, or beauty. If they were here, they were atrophied. All were missed.\n\nInstead of introducing a moral dilemma and plot points to lead the reader to a logical conclusion, one point was made by ham-handed hammering, and the other was unbelievable. (It might have been believable if a certain clarification had been made, but none was provided.) Many of the psychological points were either incorrect or poorly made, leaving the high-toned moralizing unsupported. Unforgivably, serious topics (hot trigger issues) were handled in a blithe, callous fashion. But even someone not specifically vulnerable might loathe heavy-handed moralization and flippant attitude. Content aside, the storytelling itself was inconsistent and hard to follow. (Sorry if this sounds muddled; this is technically a mystery, so I'm trying to avoid spoilers.)\n\nUsually, one would build a situation and allow it to simmer over time. Here, most of the events occur over a few hours. The riot (mentioned on the cover) is not clearly described and turns into a confused slog. Because there is not enough groundwork before the riot begins, no tension is created. We also haven't had time to make an investment in the characters, and so we have no reason to care about their outcomes. At best we have mild curiosity, and dogged hope that the story will soon start to coalesce in a way that makes us care. It never does. It doesn't help that the two main story lines are only related by accident -- literally. Making the *lack* of overlap a plot point is a mistake; instead of being an interesting twist, its merely a diversion from the main action. It's just so many more dead ends and pointless beginnings and characters we don't care about. Two half-told stories don't make a novel.\n\nWorst of all is the utter lack of payoff. The many minor open threads and possible intrigues are left unresolved. The characters we know best are abandoned, except for one who is given a tired, unrealistic final scene.\n\nThis book is hundreds of pages of confused fragments in search of a story. Trade this stinker back to the bookstore and get one of her earlier mysteries, which are brilliant, re-readable classics.\n\nJanuary 19, 2013\n\nAcid Row is a place in London, associated with \"slums\" but is legally tolerated by the police. This place is where they dump single mothers, teenagers with drug activities, gangs, handicaps, etc. That is what I've understood. Correct me if I am wrong.\n\nThe whole book is crazy. The riot is realistic but the lack of activity by the police is not. Well, there is a very dignified reason behind it but I find it really unrealistic. (It's really hard to write a review without you, getting spoiled.) The novel consists of different events occurring in a day. I understood all the 400+ pages of the book happened in just one day. And it's really a challenging read. You rarely read things like that, you know.\n\nBut don't fret, Walters is really good in transferring the reader from one dimension to the other. It's detailed, but I've noticed how some of the events weren't resolved in the end and characters were indeed abandoned. It's as if, just because the main character finally found resolute, Walters left the others in the desert to rot. It's tempting for criticism but I also came into the realization, that those characters left in the desert, were insignificant at all. It's better to leave the unnecessary behind, to bring the readers into the more important matters.\n\nIt's a good read, yes it is. I went, \"ooh\" and \"ahh\" and frowned. Never really read the past mysteries of the author but reading some of the reviews for this book, makes me think of her as a good crime writer. Others say, this book is nothing like her other books, and that I should read her past mysteries for me to satisfy myself with her writing. It's like people expect her to be like this and that. It's hard when people expect, and people label you because of what you did in the past. What if this is something new? It may suck or not but it's her writing.\n\nI'm so bias. Because for a first time reader of Minette Walters, I really like Acid Row.\n\nMarch 6, 2014\n\nRead by Claire Higgins\n\nblurb - Minette Walters has shaped a fascinating tale of poverty, of desperation, and of the lengths people feel forced to go, when living in neglected, government housing, under conditions of inhuman proportions.\n\nAcid Row is a crime-infested housing project that exists by its own laws. When news comes that a child has been kidnapped, the frustration and anger that has been seething on the streets of Acid Row is ignited. And no one will be safe.\n\nWithout missing a beat Minette Walters has portrayed these people and the events that push them over the edge, with every syllable arranged in a well-paced rhythm. This is Walters's eighth novel, and she has reached even loftier heights than ever before.\n\nNothing here for me; let's find something more endearing (shouldn't be hard).\n\nNEXT!\n\nOctober 4, 2016\n\nI love Minette Walters but this one doesn't work, for me. The concept is an unstable foundation to begin with and it goes to hell in a hand basket from there. Very readably but - the characters don't work, the storyline doesn't convince. The abduction is bizarre (why have 2 of them in the flat - are we supposed to have to decide which is worse, the paedophile or the fascist woman hater?). Topped off with the unbelievable child abduction story running parallel. The police are not credible.\n\nSomething went horribly wrong for MW with this book. As I said, it's very readable, oddly. Nothing wrong with MWs pacing! I think that shaky, unclear premise that tried to tie too many things into the story is the basis of the problem and opening the story with the wooden, stereotyped 'old maid' Health Visitor. Sophie didn't invite my sympathy, either; she had about as much sense as a thing with no sense at all!\n\nAh well - even a favourite writer can produce a book that is less than perfect!\n\nSeptember 11, 2018\n\nHabe es nach ca. 50 Seiten abgebrochen. Die Charaktere waren schwach, Dialoge kaum vorhanden und die Story eher mau.\n\nJune 1, 2023\n\nThis book starts off at a 10 for action and tension and holds it the whole way through. Keeps you in the action all the way!\n\nDecember 12, 2014\n\nFor a long time I was hearing that Minnete Walters is THIS and THAT i.e. her books were a tour de force in the world of crime writing. Though I had 3 of her books in my to-read shelf but they were far away from where I was currently. So when the opportunity arose, where my mind was reluctant to continue with the book which was next in line, I, without any hesitation picked up the Minette Walters that was closest to my hand, Acid Row.\n\nFrankly speaking the title was intriguing but the blurb wasn���t. The book was supposed to be about a day in the lives of the resident of a housing society graffited in to Assid Row from Bassindale Row, where an intended peaceful march against suspected paedophiles turns out into a violent mob thereby jeopardising the residents and anyone caught up in the situation. For me this kind of blurb means a boring book, where there is hardly any kind of crime, so no criminal, and so no cat and mouse chase.\n\nThus with heavy heart, and expecting another P.D. James phenomena, I opened the opening lines, and within first few bars I was being treated to the high tempo beat of bebop jazz, instead of a serene classical concerto which I had come to expect. The book is really an eye opener, with nothing confirming to the set standards of crime writing the book held my attention till the last page. There were scenes which made me sit right on the edge of my seat, and brutality that made me keep away the book for a minute in hope of removing the image created from my mind. Coming to brutality, Walters showed me that just like, one doesnt need to be crude to be erotic, a crime writer doesnt need to spill brains, or pluck out eyes to be brutal. The book was filled with scenes which had zero blood spills, but were brutal enough to make a man squirm. Thanks to her writing skills. The plot was neither a whodunit, nor a howcatchem. Though there is a subplot of child abduction, but the main pillar of the book never strays from the happenings on the Acid Row.\n\nSumming up, I feel its very difficult to write a crime novel where the plot doesnt revolves around a dead body or a criminal activity in general. The book becomes tough, and readers like me get uneasy thereby resulting in unfinished tag. But, this one here, despite having the same features came out as a brilliantly plotted, fast piece of crime fiction. This book will go down as a must-read for any crime lover who is in search of speed, plot and believable characters.\n\nJuly 29, 2013\n\nI was really impressed with Minette Walter's writing skills.\n\nThis book requires the author to have so many balls in the air, so many people in various roles in various locations, speaking in different ways about different things, coming from different backgrounds dealing with different problems. A true writing master only can write this book.\n\nThe characters are well built and stick to their personality.\n\nThe book itself gives one a lot to think about other than the fact that there is a missing child and a paedophile having been rehoused into a low social economic area briming with small chilrden and undereducated, underemployed youth.\n\nThe various social problems are well portrayed and the plot plays out as one could have expected, being at a somewhat \"eagle eye\" and \"on the ground\" prespective in turns.\n\nI was very impressed and quite disturbed at the same time.\n\nThis is a book I'd like to see read and discussed in high school english or literature classes. It would make for interesting classes.\n\nNovember 6, 2010\n\nMs. Walters continues to push the boundaries with her suspense fiction. This book shows what can happen when feelings run hot and people unite in a common goal. In this case the goal is misguided and cramped living quarters, xenophobic people and individuals cranked up on meth and other drugs is a recipe for disaster. I found this book very difficult to get through because it is as raw as it can get. There are definitely some gems here, and the biggest one is big, black Jimmy James who seems to almost single-handedly defuse a powder keg situation. His live-in pregnant partner Melanie is also another little jewel in the seamy cesspool in these council estates, so aptly named Acid Row. These are the things that helped me get through this book. Even though I didn't enjoy the setting or the happenings during this huge uncontrolled riot, Ms. Walters kept up the tension throughout and kept me turning pages.\n\nJuly 27, 2010\n\nyet another actually thrilling thriller. the bulk of the book takes place during a riot in a London council estate so it's plot plot plot! its fascinating to follow how a series of misteps can escallate so quickly with tragic results. there's a lot of abnormal pyschology to amp up the suspense and no one does nasty people laying into each other better than minette walters. my only quibbles would be that her chief interogator gets a bit preachy and sometimes there was so much going on I couldn't keep track of who was where. it's the kind of book you want to read in one sitting the first time and go back and read again to see what u missed.\n\nFebruary 27, 2014\n\nAcid row - the unfortunate nickname for the estate that now houses a struggling working class, an estate that becomes a powder keg when rumours begin that a local paedophile may have taken missing Amy. A young female doctor is caught up when local residents form a posse to oust the paedophile in their midst and get justice for Amy. But just where is Amy?\n\nAn excellent thriller that leaves you guessing for a long while and is very topical. Brilliantly written novel dealing easily and effortlessly with mob culture.\n\nJuly 25, 2007\n\nACID ROW by Minette Walters (HB) $24.95\n\nAs potentially real as they come. A child is reportedly missing. Word of mouth fuels a volatile housing project into a self-contained mayhem. In a complex known for its criminal content, a pedophile is placed and the walls implode with tenant revolt. Misinformation pits the good against the bad as heroes appear behind nearly every door. This is one of those books that will keep you reading into the early a.m. hours, as riveting at live coverage.\n\nAugust 7, 2021\n\nI read several Minette Walters books while on holiday and found them very well written.\n\nI found them very powerful and slightly different to the normal style of Mystery Crime writers.\n\nVery good reads.\n\nSynopsis:\n\nAcid Row is a crime-infested housing project that exists by its own laws. When news comes that a child has been kidnapped, the frustration and anger that has been seething on the streets of Acid Row is ignited. And no one will be safe.\n\nJune 22, 2013\n\nThis book has the best written tension scene I have ever read. The build-up to the riot was extraordinary and I still remember the fear I felt as I read it, even though it's been several years. I loved the change of scene to an poverty-ridden urban setting and the brutal underpinning of the plotline. One of, if not her best book.\n\nMay 31, 2017\n\nWe know from the very first page that there was a riot on the Bassindale Estate in which people were killed. What follows is a mixture of narrative, memos to social service workers, police messages, and news reports, and we learn what led up to the riot, and how various individuals were involved. Gripping.\n\nJuly 12, 2010\n\nI really enjoyed this book, even though it's about things I'd rather be in ignorance about. I was absorbed by the story and my heart was racing as I wondered who was going to make it out. A great read.\n\nAugust 1, 2010\n\nSurely an indictment against low income high density housing estates.\n\nFast paced - read in one day. The riot kept me guessing the next move. In the end the resolution I felt was weak with various people getting their just deserts, but I guess public demand wants a happy ending.\n\nAugust 5, 2011\n\nI was shocked when someone else who read this book stated to me it was all fabricated nonsense and fiction. So far from the truth. This book displays the intricacies of estate life and the horrors that can be bought about by hearsay and rhumour.\n\nJanuary 24, 2009\n\nThis is the best one I read by this author, though I really love everything she writes. I recommend it to everyone, not just to crime novels fans, because it's different and special in so many ways."
