Did you ever vi«it Brighton-le-Sandsf If not, you've'missed one of Sydney1» most beauti-

ful residential and pleasure resorts. The place fa going ahead by leaps and bounds, and al-

ready bids fair to outrival Manly m tile near future. Standing on the Besch Estate (which

we auction on Anniversary Day, January 27), the view 1« a superb one. In the foreground I»

the white sandy beach many miles In length, and the Esplanade of Brighton-le-Sand»

beautifully shaded with ornamental trees. Right across the bay which we are facing are the

imposing Historic Botany Heads, and Kurnell, the landing place of Captain Cook, may be

plainly discerned. Looking towards the left, La Perouse is also in sight, and away to the

right the George's River loses itself amorig lovely scenery. The streets of Brighton-le

sands are well made, metalled, kerbed, and guttered, and a very superior type of dwelling

has been erected.
