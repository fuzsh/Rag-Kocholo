The wings are a combo of GW's and Predaking's, that went together surprisingly smoothly. The dragon head and the detachable tail/weapon are from a BH Skylynx.The tail was a last minute addition, but I thought it added some balance in the physical look of Nemesis' alt mode, and in the color scheme.\n\nAttached Files:\n\nne01.jpg\n\nFile size:\n\n413.8 KB\n\nViews:\n\n844\n\nne02.jpg\n\nFile size:\n\n382.3 KB\n\nViews:\n\n625\n\nne03.jpg\n\nFile size:\n\n457.4 KB\n\nViews:\n\n859\n\nne04.jpg\n\nFile size:\n\n436.9 KB\n\nViews:\n\n521\n\nne05.jpg\n\nFile size:\n\n274.6 KB\n\nViews:\n\n554\n\nne06.jpg\n\nFile size:\n\n485 KB\n\nViews:\n\n1,014\n\nne07.jpg\n\nFile size:\n\n451.9 KB\n\nViews:\n\n441\n\nne08.jpg\n\nFile size:\n\n462 KB\n\nViews:\n\n395\n\nWow! When I saw the title, I didn't know what to expect. This works surprisingly well for Nemesis Enforcer! That's badass! I'd love to see other takes on GI JOE characters using TF figs. This is pretty awesome!"
