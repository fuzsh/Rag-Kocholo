If we start to significantly exceed that the venue may change...\n\nkredyty mieszkaniowe wino kredyt mieszkaniowy sprzedam mieszkanie sprzedam bilet\n\nUpdates\n\nNovember 6, 2007 - Okay we're a definite go for Indoor Playground - which means this puppy is at capacity. I've started a waiting list below *but* we won't start moving people over unless we drop below 45 attendees. 50/55 will fit but it'll be very cozy so if we can shave a few bodies off we'll need to. If you've signed up and can't come please do the right thing and take your name off the list. *ALSO* We need a *projector* - anyone have one we can borrow for the night? We'll take good care of it.\n\nOctober 4, 2007 - We'll be running this event in conjunction with the newly formed Toronto AWS Users Group and we'll be using their registration form located off the event page here. Email addresses collected will only be used to contact you in the context of this specific event unless you indicate otherwise. wino kredyt mieszkaniowy sprzedam mieszkanie sprzedam bilet\n\nOctober 2, 2007 - We now have a confirmed date of November 15, 2007. At the moment the venue is Indoor Playground but it's looking like we're going to exceed our capacity there. Working on a bigger space. We've also confirmed that Mike Culver, an AWS evangelist will be joining us for the evening.\n\nSeptember 26, 2007 - Dates are starting to take shape, right now the thinking is sometime the week of November 12-16. Likely the Monday, Tuesday or Thursday. We have a venue commitment for <50 people and are working on some ideas in case we go over that #. Amazon is aware of the event and we're working to try and get someone up from their AWS team to participate in the event.\n\nOverview/Description\n\nFormat would be similar to FacebookCamp where we'd have a few tech/how-to conversations followed up with demos of what the local community has been doing with the various AWS services. More than anything it would be a great venue for those of us developing on this infrastructure to find & get to know each other.\n\nIf you'd like to attend please signup on the wiki below:\n\nThx - Ryan\n\nEvent Ideas/Suggestions\n\nTopics should cover the main AWS services. S3, SQS, EC2, and FPS (Could use someone in the beta to talk about FPS). -- dave\n\nI'd like to see an example of using S3 with MySQL - Jamie McQuay\n\nPotential Presentations\n\nPresentation by Mike Culver, AWS Evangelist.\n\nSomeone from FreshBooks would be willing to come and talk about FPS - Ben V\n\nEnomaly can demo several AWS related products including ElasticDrive, Enomalism and ElasticLive - Reuven\n\nClay Tablet could demo our product (running EC2/SQS/S3) - Ryan C.\n\nI can talk about Zoomii's logging approach - structured logs, real-time and historical, backed up on S3, from many network-unaware processes across many EC2 instances - Chris Thiessen\n\nI can also talk about Zoomii's load-balancing approach: a non-blocking Java proxy server that discovers worker servers and what they're serving through 'leases' uploaded to S3 - Chris Thiessen\n\nI can talk about AideRSS architecture: EC2 and SQS and how we scaled up our system to 100+ EC2 servers.
