        "text": "I think things like this work different in person to person.\n\nKaty never reacted to wasp stings badly till this year and ended up at ER.\n\nRobert and Katy both reacted horribly to poison oak 15 years ago. Katy still does, Robert does not.\n\nKnew a guy that worked in National Parks and never had issue withpoison oak till after he retired at 65 after 40 years of being exposed to it almost daily. Then working on his own property, horrible reaction ended up in hospital.\n\nMe, I seem to react more to stuff I did not as I get older.\n\nI have had two series of allergy injection and skin treatments over my lifetime. Plus other fun drugs and steroids.\n\nI believe it's all up to how your personal immune system works.\n\nI've had accidentally found self in tree around wasps.\n\nSeveral times they have followed me across tree as swung.\n\nThey got me good one time many stings and came down.\n\nProbably was in some state of chemical shock x adrenaline and pumping wide open all day in heat.\n\nShould a had someone monitoring me then, hard call to make on self and that just isn't how played out.\n\nThat was lucky, not smart that day.\n\n.\n\nAnother time was descending different route than went up, maybe 70' drop, open air to Mother Earth.\n\nSuddenly noticed flurry of swirling puffed rice below, even stopped and figured out WTF it was.\n\nDidn't have cams etc. to look too hard at 30' straight up at end of day. Locked off to Muenter take over for friction hitch and punched thru them hard. Few followed, but more potent than was used to. I think everyone's chem is different and what can desensitize one can bring building intolerance in another. Also, depends on state when start a treat-meant, for this too can turn friend to foe."
