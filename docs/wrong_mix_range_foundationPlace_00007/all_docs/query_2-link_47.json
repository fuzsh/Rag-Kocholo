We’ve got tents, packs, quilts, apparel, food, and accessories from the biggest and best names in backpacking. There are 15 stacked prize packages up for grabs this year averaging more than $2,000 worth of goods each!\n\nThe Badger Sponsorship\n\nFor those new to the excitement, the Badger Sponsorship is our effort to give back to the trail community. This is the 11th year of the giveaway and it’s bigger than ever. Every year, we team up with our favorite backpacking brands to gather a boatload of prizes and give them out to a handful of lucky winners. We’ve received a Badger Sponsorship record with more than $31,800 worth of prizes from 35 of your favorite outdoor brands this year (yeah, it’s a big deal!).\n\nBut here’s the kicker—it’s not just a giveaway. The Badger Sponsorship is a fundraiser with a mission. Our goal is to raise a mountain of money for Leave No Trace (LNT). 100% of this year’s proceeds will go directly to LNT as they continue to promote and inspire responsible outdoor recreation through science-based education and partnerships (spoiler alert: we love LNT).\n\nSo, how does it work?\n\nEntering is as simple as lacing up your hiking shoes! For each dollar you donate through our BetterWorld fundraising campaign, you earn an entry into the contest. The more you contribute, the greater your chances of winning. So, if you have a love for free outdoor gear and a passion for protecting our beloved trails, get entering!\n\nThe Sponsors\n\nThe Badger Sponsorship wouldn’t be possible without the incredible support of our sponsors. A huge thank you goes out to Appalachian Gear Co, Sawyer Products, Gossamer Gear, Zpacks, Good To-Go Inc., Six Moon Designs, Big Agnes, Purple Rain Adventure Skirts, Jolly Gear, Bedrock Sandals, Sambob, Therm-a-Rest, Solo Stove, TownShirt Co., Katabatic Gear, Gregory Mountain Products, Ursack, Superior Wilderness Designs, Tippins Foods, Enlightened Equipment, Backpacker’s Pantry, Vargo Outdoors, LMNT, Feathered Friends, Glacial Gear, Durston Gear, FarPointe Outdoor Gear, Backcountry, Rawlogy, Chicken Tramper, Farm to Summit, Granite Gear, Mountain Safety Research (MSR), Mayfly Ultralight Equipment, and Packit Gourmet.\n\nThe Prizes\n\nThis year, we’re upping the ante with fifteen prize packages, each valued at approximately $2120. Not only do you win some of the best gear in the industry, but you can walk away feeling satisfied knowing that you donated to an incredible cause.\n\nCurious about what’s up for grabs this year? Take a peek at the prize packages below, enter the giveaway through our BetterWorld campaign, and keep your fingers crossed. The entry deadline is on March 1, 2024.\n\nTo recap: $1 = 1 entry. Anyone in the US over the age of 18 is eligible to enter and win a randomly assigned prize package. The Badger Sponsorship concludes on March 1, 2024.\n\nSo, what are you waiting for? Check out our BetterWorld campaign and make your mark on the 2024 Badger Sponsorship!
