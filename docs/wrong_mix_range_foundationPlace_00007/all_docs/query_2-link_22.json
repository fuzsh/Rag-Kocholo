        "text": "Answers multiple choice questions built in Python using Google Custom Search API. Specifically made for my Music Appreciation course for research purposes. :)\n\nScript takes in three possible ways of input:\n\nCommand line arguments\n\nOCR\n\nClipboard\n\nIt reads and formats the input data to perform a google search for the question on Quizlet using Google Custom Search API. bot.py grabs the snippet output from each API result and does a word count for each multiple choice options. The option with the highest word count is chosen as the best answer. With this method, I was able to obtain 100% scores on my quizes.\n\nReads a screenshot image of the question and possible solutions then converts it into a legible format to feed into bot.py script for analysis. Works but is unreliable and has issues formatting different types of screenshots sometimes.\n\nMost reliable method to grab data for formatting. Highlight and copy the question and answers with CTRL+C and it will automatically read your clipboard to feed parameters into bot.py."
