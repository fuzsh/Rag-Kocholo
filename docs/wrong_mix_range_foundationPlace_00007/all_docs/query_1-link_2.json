        "text": "Describe in detail\n\nFig. 1 is the process flow diagram of treatment step 100 according to an embodiment of the invention.For the quick introduction of feature of the present invention is provided, below will at first not be described treatment step 100 with reference to object lesson.Therefore, treatment step 100 will be described in the details at an object lesson and particular hardware and software implementation example and alternative embodiment subsequently.\n\nHandle 100 from step S102, wherein determine a plurality of product attributes for a specific product.Each product attribute is relevant with a plurality of attribute ranks.Product attribute and attribute rank can be determined according to the information that obtains from product producer.In general, described attribute and attribute rank are the features that the manufacturer wishes to obtain Consumer Preferences information.Be understandable that though that current open main discussion is the manufacturer, the present invention can be used by dealer, dealer or other interesting group that obtains Consumer Preferences information.In addition, term product refers to product and/or service as used herein.\n\nAfter step S102, a plurality of set of properties are determined in first indication of step S104 according to the consumer.Each of a plurality of groups all comprises one or more product attributes.In order to determine described a plurality of groups, the consumer is required according to the importance of a plurality of product attributes they to be divided into groups.For example, described attribute can be classified as three groups, respectively least important attribute, most important attribute and other attribute of representative.Flow process proceeds to step S106 then.\n\nAt step S106, the ordering of a plurality of attributes of one of a plurality of groups is determined.By receiving from the arrangement of each attribute in consumer's the group and determining an ordering, execution in step S106 thus.Then, at step S108, according to consumer's second indication, the one or more importance of other attribute of this group relatively in a plurality of attributes of described group are determined.Second indication proposes by sending to problem of consumer, such as such problem: \" (the attribute rank X) of (attribute 1) and the difference between (attribute rank Y) have more important with respect to (the attribute rank A) of (attribute 2) and the difference between (attribute rank B)? \" importance value represents that with a number percent most important attribute is associated with importance value 100%.In one embodiment, after completing steps S108, all the value with a relative importance is relevant for each of one or more attributes of one of a plurality of groups.In another embodiment, only some is relevant with the relative importance value in one or more attributes of one of a plurality of groups.\n\nThe 3rd indication according to the consumer in step S110 of one or more other scale values of attribute level of described then group is determined.In order to determine a scale value, be received from consumer's a indication, it will be worth 0 assignment and give the attribute rank of least wishing relevant with specific object, and will be worth the attribute rank of 10 assignment to relevant with specific object hope.In addition, described indication is given described each other attribute rank relevant with specific object with the value assignment between 0 to 10.Other scale value of attribute level can produce at the attribute rank evaluation scale value of least wishing and wishing most by requiring the consumer.\n\nThen, determine a partial utility value at step S112.Partial utility value representation consumer is for concrete other preference of attribute level or the value of practicality.Its advantage is, according to embodiments of the invention, the partial utility value can be used for according to the difference between relatively more relevant with the different attribute attribute rank of separately different extend of hope.\n\nThe partial utility value of determining at step S112 is that an attribute rank of one of a plurality of attributes with described group interrelates.Especially, described partial utility value is determined by the relative importance (determining at step S108) that this other scale value of attribute level (determining at step S110) be multiply by relevant attribute.For example, other partial utility value of properties desired level of most important attribute equals 10 * 100%=10, and other partial utility value of least properties desired level of most important attribute equals 0 * 100%=0.Be appreciated that least important attribute level other partial utility value relevant with any attribute equals 0.\n\nAs mentioned above, the embodiment of treatment step 100 reduces potential consumer's prejudice in order to determine correct and useful preference information by the number that reduces the inquiry that must answer.Inquiry minimizing of number and consumer answer the minimizing of the needed time total amount of inquiry, and that has reduced that the consumer may lose interest or concentrated force and therefore incorrect answer be provided can property.In addition, the minimizing of the number of inquiry causes still less that data are stored and analyze.\n\nIf the consumer only by the problem of inquiry limited quantity or only in finite time by the inquiry problem, treatment step 100 also can provide the preference data of usefulness.Like this, can determine to organize in case the number of bound problem or time of needing so that produce useful preference information.Further, if determine a plurality of groups according to an indication, this indication expression offsets expense person, a plurality of attributes one or more than described a plurality of attributes another one or a plurality of be prior, the consumer can more correctly provide the relative importance of each attribute in the group.The relative importance that provides like this is considered to more accurate, because by the sensation of consumer for an attribute in the group, this attribute is compared inessential significantly or more important with other attribute in the group, and importance seldom can be distorted.\n\nNetwork structure\n\nFig. 2 is the analysis view of a network architecture according to an embodiment of the invention.Certainly, many other architectures can be used for realizing the present invention.Shown in Figure 2 is center system 200, is described as a principal computer.In order to determine the preference information of the partial utility value relevant with

center system 200 as the part of the business industry ï¹ solution that is provided by entity.In this, relevantly with Fig. 1 as mentioned above can finish by both collaborative of center system 200 and client devices 300 or one of them in conjunction with step of the present invention with other.\n\nThe information that product database 394 comprises is similar to the information that is included in product database 294.Yet, the described information that is included in product database 394, the manufacturer by operation client devices 300 imports in certain embodiments.Preference information database 396 comprises Consumer Preferences information, and according to the present invention, this information can be transferred to client devices 300 by center system 200, or can be produced by client devices 300.\n\nAs mentioned above, product database 294 and preference information database 296 will be described in detail and below in Fig. 5 and 6 illustrated.The same just as one of ordinary skill in the art understand, the form of database is represented and supplemental instruction is only represented relation between the canned data.Except those suggestions shown in the form, also have the scheme of many other to be used.Similarly, the item of illustrated database is only represented example information; The number that it will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that item can be different with diagram with content.\n\nProduct database\n\nFig. 5 represents is that the form of the part of product database 294 is represented.The attribute and relevant other data of attribute level of specific products specified in product database 294 storages.Especially, client computer: product field 402 expression will be the relevant attribute 404 of its assessment and the client computer of attribute rank 406, and the product relevant with attribute 404 and attribute rank 406.In addition, relevant with attribute 404 and attribute rank 406 in single record is hint order sign 408.Whether the attribute rank 406 that 408 expressions of hint order sign are relevant can be listed according to consumer's order of preference by hypothesis.The use of hint order sign 408 will be described below.Should be pointed out that attribute 404, attribute rank 406 and hint order sign 408 can be specified by consumer or client computer, and receive from client devices 300 or from consumer device 400 by center system 200.Certainly, the attribute 404 of product database 294, attribute rank 406 and hint order sign 408 can be determined by center system 200 independently.\n\nAlthough Fig. 5 has represented appointment particular community and other data of attribute level, the present invention be envisioned for any specific product assessment less or more attribute and/or attribute rank.In addition, imagination product database 294 can be multiple product and/or a plurality of client computer storage data.On the contrary, be that the product database 394 that is kept in the client devices 300 can only be stored the data relevant with the particular customer of operating client devices 300 for embodiment imagination.\n\nThe data that are kept in the product database 294 can be used according to embodiments of the invention, so that determine the preference information about attribute 404 and attribute rank 406.About Fig. 1 such an embodiment has just been described above.After determining like this, described preference information can be stored in the preference information database 296, and/or be transferred to client devices 300 and be used to be stored in preference information database 396.\n\nThe preference information database\n\nFig. 6 represents that a form of the part of preference information database 296 is represented according to an embodiment of the invention.Be stored in the preference information that the data reflection in the preference information database 296 is determined according to the present invention.As the consumer: shown in the product field 410, the reflection of the part of shown database is at the single consumer's of single product preference information.Each record comprises field 412 and other field 414 of appointment respective attributes level of a specified attribute in the form part, and the partial utility value relevant with each attribute rank.\n\nAt the product database of mentioning 294, being kept at data in the preference information database 296 and can reflecting for specific products than still less shown in Figure 6 or more attribute and/or attribute.In addition, it is contemplated that preference information database 296 will store the corresponding data of multiple product with a plurality of consumers and each consumer.On the other hand, it is contemplated that the product database 396 of client devices 300 can store a plurality of consumers' preference information, but only corresponding those particular customer product solds by operation client devices 300.Should be understood that, with \"? \" the expression the partial utility value with thought that by the consumer \" less important \" attribute 412 is relevant.\n\nObject lesson\n\nThough following example is based on the treatment step of Fig. 1, other of imagination and/or other processing also can be described.Should be pointed out that what treatment step among Fig. 1 and other treatment step described here were described to be finished by the executable treatment step of processor of the central server program 292 carried out by microprocessor 210 by center system 200.Yet treatment step can be finished whole or in part by one or more center systems 200, client devices 300, consumer device 400, other equipment and manual type.\n\nAs mentioned above, in step S102, a plurality of product attributes of main product are determined.In the example of following elaboration, main product is a palace car, and attribute is \" horsepower \", \" per gallon mileage (M.P.G.) \", \" sign \" and \" price \".Each attribute of determining is relevant with one or more attribute ranks, and these attribute ranks are that the attribute in the product database 294 with Fig. 5 is relevant.Therefore, attribute can be in step S102 with reference to and the relevant attribute of product of storage in product database 294, determine by center system 200.Attribute also can be by receiving the data of representation attribute from operating personnel via input equipment 240 or by receive the data of representation attribute from client devices 300, being determined by center system 200.With regard to the latter, client devices 300 can be from product database 394 or from operating personnel's searching attribute of operation input apparatus 340.In addition, can in step S102, after being determined product, the consumer determine attribute by receive attribute from the consumer.In this, when whether consumer decision bought this product, the consumer can be required the attribute and/or the attribute of selecting or specifying him to be concerned about.\n\nAfter attribute is determined, should determine whether relevant with this attribute of determining for consumers any attribute rank is unacceptable.In this, a unacceptable attribute rank is such attribute rank, if this rank is included in the product, will the overslaugh consumer buy this product, and regardless of other attribute rank that is included in the product.The user interface 500 of Fig. 7 can be used for determining unacceptable attribute according to consumer's input.\n\nUser interface 500 is offered the consumer by consumer device 400.User interface 500, and other user interface as described below, can start at center system 200 places and by directly from center system 200 or from center system 200 by one for example the intermediate equipment of client devices 300 be transferred to consumer device 400.Similarly, user interface can and directly or by an intermediate equipment be transferred to consumer device 400 in client devices 300 beginnings.\n\nUser interface 500 as shown in the figure, requires the consumer to discern unacceptable attribute rank of definite attribute.Be included in message reflection in the user interface 500 and be kept at information in the product database 294 of center system 200.Utilize user interface 500, the consumer can identify from zero unacceptable to the attribute rank of whole demonstrations.As shown in Figure 7, the consumer identifies \" 150 horsepowers \", \" 15 per gallon mileage \" and \" $50, and 000 \" as unacceptable attribute rank.\n\nFig. 8 represents user interface 600, and it is that then user interface 500 is shown to the consumer's.User interface 600 shows that those are not indicated as unacceptable attribute and relevant attribute rank in user interface 500.Therefore, all properties except being considered to unacceptable attribute rank and the attribute rank shown in Fig. 8 displayed map 7.That user interface 600 requires the consumer to identify to wish most in the attribute rank of demonstration and least wish.Perhaps, each other extend of hope of attribute level of user interface 600 attribute that can require the consumer to arrange to be shown.\n\nAccording to embodiments of the invention, if the order that the attribute rank has a hint, then this attribute and its relevant attribute rank can not be displayed in the user interface 600.The order of hint is that a consumer according to expection expects the order that other extend of hope of the attribute level supposed is arranged.For example, the attribute rank of product database 294 indication attributes \" price \" is to list with the order of hint, and a consumer prefers such as supposition, and for example, one, 000 automobile surpasses one, 000 automobile, other all be equal to.\n\nPerhaps, have the attribute rank of the order of a hint, can be presented at user interface 600 with the relevant check box of choosing in advance according to the order of this hint.Use current example, this embodiment can choose indication $30 in advance, and 000 check box is the attribute rank of wishing most in the attribute \" price \", the Er $45, the 000th, the attribute rank of least wishing.\n\nDetermining to wish most and least after the properties desired rank, many group attributes so that at aforesaid step S104, are determined according to consumer's indication in explicit user interface 700.As shown in Figure 9, user interface 700 requires the consumer to identify each attribute to be \" important \" or \" less important \".Per gallon mileage that the consumer of the user interface 700 of application drawing 9 has indicated attribute \" horsepower \", \" \" and \" price \" be \" important \", attribute \" sign \" is \" less important \".According to current disclosed content, \" important \" and \" less important \" indication relates to independent set of properties.Should be pointed out that according to the present invention and can determine plural group, such as \" very critical \", \" appropriateness critical \" and \" nonessential \" group.In other embodiments, when having only number when attribute, just user interface 700 is shown to the user so that attribute is divided in groups greater than a threshold value.Threshold value can be according to handling the time total amount that must be done or determine to the maximum number of the problem of consumer's inquiry, and can pass through center system 200, client devices 300 or consumer device 400 settings.\n\nThen,, the user interface 800 of Figure 10 is shown to the consumer, the ordering of the attribute so that determine to be included in \" important \" group according to step S106.Though user interface 800 allows by arranging for each attribute assignment number, ordering can also by the inquiry consumer specify for each attribute wish most and least the difference on other extend of hope of properties desired level be determined.Arrange these attributes according to these differences then, the attribute with maximum difference is most important attribute.\n\nThen, the user interface 900 of Figure 11 is shown to the consumer, so that determine with respect to most important attribute, the relative importance of the attribute of \" critical \" group.By after determining ordering, determining relative importance, this handle permission consumer in more detail relatively before, between attribute, carry out relatively general.Therefore the consumer can more correctly be the attribute assignment relative importance than Previous System.\n\nIn the embodiment of Figure 11, importance is to be different from the attribute of most important attribute by the inquiry consumer for each, the importance that properties desired rank is compared with properties desired rank least, compare with its importance that rank is compared of least wishing with the properties desired rank of most important attribute, thus the evaluation of carrying out and definite.In object lesson, \" horsepower \" is indicated as the most important attribute that uses user interface 800, and in user interface 600, the hope of attribute \" price \" and \" horsepower \" and least the properties desired rank be designated as \" $30 respectively, 000 \", \" $45; 000 \", \" 250 horsepowers \" and \" 190 horsepowers \".Therefore, user interface 900 requires consumer's Dui $30, and 000 price is to $45, and the coexist importance of the difference in the horsepower of the importance of 000 price is compared and evaluated.According to this example, about all the other attributes of \" important \" group, i.e. the expectation and the problem of expecting that least the attribute level inquiry is identical of \" per gallon mileage \".\n\nIn one embodiment, according to ordering, for the above problem inquiry of each attribute enquiry.That is to say that the relative importance of the attribute that is number two was determined before the relative importance of the attribute that is number three.With not determining that according to ordering the embodiment of importance compares, this embodiment allows the consumer to indicate relative importance more accurately.\n\nAccording to other embodiment, the consumer is required whole residue attributes still less the importance of evaluation than \" important \" group.For example, can require the consumer to arrange the importance of \" important \" preceding 20 attributes of group or preceding 20% attribute according to the ordering of determining.The numerical value of attribute of evaluation can be selected by client computer, selects by the consumer, or according to any factor, and what comprise distribution receives time of information from the consumer, by center system 200 supposition.The attribute of assessing according to this embodiment can be according to their relative rank assigns importance.In this, in this case, promptly rank is for being assigned with 12% relative importance from minimum the 6th attribute, and the attribute with five minimum ranks can automatically distribute 10%, 8%, 6%, 4% and 2% relative importance respectively.These embodiment advantageously provide correct preference information, have reduced simultaneously to receive the required time quantum of information from the consumer, have reduced some consumer's prejudice thus.\n\nCan be to have 100% relative importance by specifying most important attribute, and to require the consumer be each other attribute prescribed percentage value in this group, determine the relative importance of all properties.In addition, can by be evaluated at attribute wish most and least between the properties desired rank difference with respect to most important attribute wish most and least between the properties desired rank consumer's of the importance of difference evaluation determine the relative importance of attribute.\n\nIn addition, relative importance can step S108 by attribute wish most and least between the properties desired rank difference with respect to least important attribute wish most and least between the properties desired rank consumer's of the importance of difference evaluation determine.Relative importance also can be arranged according to the attribute that receives by user interface 800, wherein, for example, most important attribute is assigned with 100% relative importance, least important attribute is assigned with 0% importance, all the other attributes within intervenient scope by five equilibrium.\n\nThen, at step S110, each acceptable other scale value of attribute level of the attribute in \" important \" group is determined.User interface 1000 expressions obtain a kind of method of each attribute level other scale value relevant with attribute from the consumer.In present example, do not need for those only the attribute of the group relevant with two property values determine scale value, for example \" M.P.G. \" is because according to definition, all the other attribute ranks are the attribute ranks of wishing most and least wish, and automatically respectively 10 and 0 these two scale values are distributed to them.As shown in the figure, can be defined as \" 5 \" for \" 220 horsepowers \" scale value, and for \" $40,000 \" and \" $35,000 \" can be defined as \" 3 \" and \" 7 \".\n\nCan determine scale value according to questions answer, be that \" if you obtain an automobile with 220 horsepowers rather than 250 horsepowers, and other is all the same, you understand how are you feeling today? such as problem \", wherein answering can be in the answer scope one.Other method comprises that the permission consumer gives each attribute level allocation scale value.These methods allow the accuracy of inspection consumer's answer, because the scale value that distributes can be examined and be input to the inconsistency of the attribute level arrangement of user interface 600.For example, when being presented scale value greater than scale value \" 220 horsepowers \" if \" 190 horsepowers \" are represented as an attribute rank of least wishing, just can discern inconsistency.Scale value can only be determined according to the attribute level arrangement, and it is that apportioning cost 10 and 0 is given most important attribute rank and least important attribute rank respectively that this attribute is arranged, and all the other attribute ranks are assigned with the value that produces with all attribute ranks of five equilibrium.\n\nAfter determining scale value, can determine other partial utility value of each attribute level according to the relative importance of relevant scale value and relevant attribute.In this example, according to the input of consumer to user interface 1000, attribute rank \" 220 horsepowers \" is confirmed as having scale value \" 5 \".In addition, according to the input of user interface 800, \" horsepower \" is confirmed as is most important attribute, therefore is assigned with the relative importance with 100% in step S108.Therefore, relevant with \" 220 horsepowers \" partial utility value is (100%*5)=5.Similarly, the partial utility value corresponding with \" 190 horsepowers \" and \" 250 horsepowers \" be respectively (100%*0)=0 with (100%*10)=10.\n\nAdopt a kind of hypothesis, promptly determine respectively that for attribute \" per gallon mileage \" and \" price \" its relative importance is 40% and 70% in step S108, the preference information database 294 of Fig. 6 is to fill according to the preference information that the example in the embodiments of the invention is determined.More particularly, the partial utility value relevant with \" per gallon mileage \" attribute rank of \" 25 per gallon mileage \" and \" 35 per gallon mileage \" be respectively (40%*0)=0 with (40%*10)=4, and with \" $45,000 \", \" $40; 000 \", \" $35,000 \" and \" $30,000 \" \" \" the partial utility value that the attribute rank is relevant is respectively (70%*0)=0 to price, (70%*3)=2.1, (70%*7)=4.9 and (70%*10)=7.\n\n\" sign \" other relevant being shown as of attribute level \"? \" symbol, \" sign \" is in the group of \" nonessential \" because this attribute, and not assessment in example.In addition, unacceptable attribute rank does not have the partial utility value, and therefore, relevant value is represented with \" X \".In other embodiments, be that other is arranged and estimates according to the attribute level of determining in the past with \" nonessential \" other partial utility value of attribute level that attribute is relevant.\n\nFigure 13 is the view that is shown to the Consumer Preferences information 1100 of client computer according to embodiments of the invention.Consumer Preferences information 1100 intention offers the intelligible analysis of the Consumer Preferences information that the client determines according to the present invention.Preference information 1100 can be shown to the client by many approach, comprise that the data by transmission expression preference information 1100 arrive client devices 300, by transmitting a webpage that comprises preference information 1100 to client devices 300, by utilizing display 250 or display 350 to be that client computer shows preference information 1100, and by providing a hard copy that utilizes the preference information 1100 that printer 260 or printer 360 produce to client computer.As shown in the figure, preference information 1100 has reflected the data in the preference information database 296 that is kept at Fig. 6.\n\nAlthough the present invention has been described in detail at specific embodiment at this, those of ordinary skill in the art should be noted that and can carry out various
