Dear Max list,

I am pleased to announce the first public beta release of Integra Live, a new application for the composition and performance of live electronic music. Integra Live uses Pure Data as its signal processing engine and provides a new user interface written in Adobe Flex.

The software can be downloaded from the project website:

http://www.integralive.org

The Adobe AIR runtime is required and can be downloaded from:

http://get.adobe.com/air/

Integra Live aims to provide an intuitive and humane interface to advanced signal processing and interaction capabilities. It is currently being developed by the research centres of the Integra project, and will be used by Integra commissioned composers and performers in a series of concerts across Europe in 2011.

Please take time to try the software and give us your feedback via the online forum:

All best wishes!

Jamie
