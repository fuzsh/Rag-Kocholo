        "text": "With a focus on innovation and circularity, our product design and development team transforms product concept ideas and components into fully resolved designs that are rigorously refined and production-ready. This applies to blue-sky designs through to mature designs that require re-engineering, Design for Manufacture (DFM), Design for Circularity (DFC) or simply a revision. Our design philosophy is to empower you through industrial product design, mechanical engineering, DFM and electrical engineering for a custom solution that Makes Your Vision Real.\n\nUtilising the Internet of Things (IoT), we’ve fully digitised our manufacturing plant by integrating our ERP/MRP, production scheduling, machine performance management, CAD and customer relationship management (CRM) system via a touchscreen kiosk system known a the Integra K4.0 throughout the entire facility. This touchscreen system is located at each work centre, including the design office, and is now part of our custom DigiSMART Collection, which we sell through our products division Integra TransForm. The major benefits of our K4.0 system are:\n\nContribution to the circular economy\n\nEven greater agile manufacturing\n\nReduced human error\n\nIncreased quality control\n\nMore accurate quoting\n\nBetter control over scheduling\n\nStronger and deeper customer relationships\n\nIntegration between design and manufacturing\n\nReduction in lost time\n\nReduced business costs\n\nContinuous improvement and innovative thinking\n\nSignificantly improved staff morale, job satisfaction and productivity\n\nIntegra's own core manufacturing facility is where metal component and contract manufacturing takes place and where Integra TransForm's range of products are created. Utilising our world leading advanced manufacturing steel and aluminium production machinery and equipment, we provide a manufacturing service that will ensure we meet all your product manufacturing and distribution requirements with the highest quality metal components.\n\nIntegra then brings together all components manufactured in-house, and by our trusted supply network, through our agile assembly line. Utilising our own Integra WorkSmart Collection electric, height-adjustable Industrial AeroSMARTs, productivity is fully optimised and our agile and lean assembly line completes the final stage of production, ensuring a 100% Australian-made, quality product is delivered to the market.\n\nThroughout the manufacturing process, we will always ensure your components are competitively produced by critically reviewing the suitability of the manufacturing methods used for your components. In consultation with you, your product can also be reviewed by our product development team, with the ultimate goal of empowering you to keep your product competitive and contribute towards a circular economy.\n\nA safe, healthy, lean and comfortable work environment is critical to maximum productivity. Integra has extensive experience in office and industrial workspaces and has identified unmet ergonomic needs. We have worked closely with the market through our incubation process and invested heavily in developing innovative and unique products that go beyond the basic products available. These products will reward you with the business benefits gained from creating a workspace that maximises staff comfort, safety, happiness and efficiency.\n\nCreated by a manufacturer for manufacturing and industrial environments, we have used our own manufacturing environment to design, test and create the Integra K4.0. This ruggedised, large format touch screen kiosk has been created specifically for industrial environments to facilitate other manufacturers in achieving digitisation and Industry 4.0 ambitions across their operations. The kiosk technology has the versatility to adapt to the many demands of diverse industrial sectors to deliver business efficiencies and optimise business performance.\n\nAs part of our product incubation process, we have created an exciting and robust range of touchscreen and touchless mobile, floor-mounted, wall-mounted and desk-mounted kiosk enclosures, software applications and computer hardware. These products are customised for full Industry 4.0 digitisation, utilising the Internet of things (IoT), retail, promotional, consumer information, wayfinding, office and industrial environments. These kiosk systems are not limited to the range on display and can be customised for your specific needs.\n\nIntegra Systems has formed an international partnership with Brink Industrial – a Dutch sheet metal solutions manufacturer – to embark on product manufacturing under digital licence. These products include a range of circularity-designed hand sanitisers & ‘separation at the source’ waste bin systems that are designed under Brink’s division Lune, and manufactured & sold in the Australian market by Integra Systems under digital license. Digital licensing is circular by virtue of nullifying the international transportation environmental impact through local manufacture."
