        "text": "So - having ordered my Integra 3.4 AVR in September 2021, it finally arrived on Monday.... (the Integra is almost identical to the LX305... but with Pre-outs... similar to a lower powered LX505 with fewer channels - DAC's, and DSP are identical throughout the family... Onkyo RZ50/NR7100, Pioneer LX305/505, Integra DRX 3.4/5.4)\n\nI am glad I waited.\n\nSo here is the quick review...\n\nMy System :\n\nSpeakers\n\nFront L/R Gallo Reference 3.1\n\nC Gallo Reference AV Center\n\nSurround L/R PSB Alpha Intro\n\nSub Gallo TR2\n\nTV Sony X90H\n\nCurrent AVR being replaced\n\nOnkyo TX-SR876 (2008, 30kg, 140W/ch beast - Audyssey XT) - no HDMI inputs (burnt out) - SPDIF\n\nalso Integra DTR 70.4, same amp as 876 (same weight too!), let out its magic smoke recently - Audyssey XT32 - both of these sounded best without Audyssey - run straight. - although for Movies I often activated Audyssey so I could listen late at night using the Dynamic EQ function. (Loudness)\n\nPower amps 2x Crown XLS2500 - not connected in a while, have been running the 876 the last 6 months since the 70.4 failed... the Crowns are intended to be configured with their onboard crossover to BiAmp the Front L/R.\n\nBox arrived and was unpacked - nicely built unit, looks a lot like the old 70.4, but weighs half as much... the lightness is not promising from a class AB amp perspective! it is both shorter in height and depth, than the old ones (possibly a good thing... they are/were huge!)\n\nI can easily pop the new unit into the rack, not much effort - taking the old beast out on the other hand requires great care, and is easiest with 2 people - it is HEAVY.\n\nFor starters I just plugged in the 3.4 on its own, simply replacing the 876, and feeding it via HDMI.\n\nI had a brief listen... 10 to 15min - definite lack of body, it sounds a bit coarser perhaps in the mids and highs - hard to tell... but definitely not as good as the 876 (both were being run with no RoomEQ) .\n\nRerun speaker cables, set up for Biamping - connect up the 2 x Crowns, set up their onboard crossovers to 125Hz, and set their gain to around 75%\n\nManually set levels for all speakers....\n\nFirst listen of the Integra DRX 3.4 with the Crowns - setup as planned...\n\nAhh that's definitely better ... in fact it is very good, better than the 876 on its own (I think?)- hard to tell, but at least in the same ballpark - it is sounding good.\n\nHmm OK, lets try Dirac.... - first run using only the AVR on its own.... quick set of measurements and a listen.... - ooh this is sound good....\n\nMidrange and mid-highs are definitely clearer - tried a couple of movie clips - vocals / dialogue is much much clearer - this is far better than Audyssey (at least in my setup).\n\nDownsides... the bass is sounding a bit \"plummy\" - sounds like a mid bass boost... need to try a more thorough measurement and analysis - and that's what the Dirac PC app is well suited to.\n\nDid a bit of viewing that evening - was great watching Peaky Binders on Netflix... definitely an upgrade from my previous setup - and most of the improvement seems directly due to Dirac - definitely feeling vindicated about my wait for the Dirac Based Onkyo/Integra unit....\n\nLet's see if I can resolve that bass issue.\n\nNext day - I ran up the Dirac PC app on my laptop - still using the Puck MIC connected to the AVR for measurements - Puck is attached to me old camera tripod.\n\nI ran the full 17 point Dirac measurement across our 3 seater couch.\n\nThen I brought up the resulting measurements - loaded a Harman +4db target curve, and adjusted it a little by applying a slight rolloff at the high end - adjusted some of the curtains (up for the surrounds, down for bass on the fronts)\n\nInitial listening response: - fantastic - the plumminess is gone! (so I must have measured wrong the day before) - system is sounding better than it ever has - better detail, smooth, deep base - soundstage....\n\nLooking forward to further listening over coming weeks - my initial response is that YES, Dirac is a game changer - dramatic improvement from Audyssey.\n\nThe AVR on its own is too underpowered for my speakers - but that was expected - they can be a difficult load, and that would not apply to many setups/speakers.\n\nBut the AVR is an excellent prepro, based on my listening - and its internal amps are more than adequate to run a pair of surrounds and the center....\n\nWhen I have the time, I will try to set up some height speakers....\n\nFor those on the fence - I would suggest hanging on for the Dirac AVR's rather than succumbing to the lure of Audyssey....\n\nI started using the VSX-LX505 January 10.\n\nEquipment connected to the AVR is ... LG C2, PS5, Xbox Series X, Roku, Sony BD player and a computer is connected via LAN for music and the network interface.\n\nSpeakers are all Klipsch ... RF83, RC62, RS42.\n\nThe Harmony programming app for the Harmony One remote has the 505 in the data base, but there are a couple of missing functions.\n\nTo get going and evaluate the AVR I used the MCACC to set levels and distance.\n\nIt did a good job with that, pretty much the same as the old VSX-23TXH and very similar to the Denon x2200W.\n\nThe HDMI 2.1 features work correctly with LG C2, PS5, and Xbox Series X (hooray).\n\nI like everything going through the AVR to the TV much better than having the consoles connected to the TV and using ARC for the audio. The CEC was always messing with me while I was using the Denon AVR.\n\nMy wife and I both think the sound is very good, we have settled in with pure direct mode.\n\nI have not messed with Dirac yet.\n\nI will get around to it soon enough and see if it makes a positive contribution to the experience.\n\nWe are well satisfied with the sound right now.\n\nIt was reported on the ASR forum the nanny circuit kicked in during the power sweep test, I have tried very hard to make the nanny circuit kick in using music but I was not able to make it happen. I do not think anyone playing real world content will have an issue with the AVR suddenly throttling the output.\n\nI just did a hiss check by turning the volume on the AVR to maximum and putting my ear in the tweeter of one of the RF83 speakers.\n\nI am 64 years old so if you have young pristine ears YMMV on hiss detection but as far as I can tell hiss is virtually inaudible with my ear right at the tweeter, and moving a couple inches away I cannot hear it at all.\n\nMy wife never said anything about the front inputs on the old Pioneer or the Denon, but she did ask a couple evening back if this one had any front inputs and when I showed her they were behind the door she said she liked the clean look with the door a lot better than the other AVRs.\n\nI like the VSX-LX505.\n\nI started using the VSX-LX505 January 10.\n\nEquipment connected to the AVR is ...

Though, I probably wouldn’t try to force the AVR into any sort of protection mode. If you’re not tripping anything with normal use, you have nothing to worry about… ;-)\n\nAgree on checking out Dirac. Audyssey can be excellent given many situations, so it’s not too surprising that you’re loving the sound. I think you’ll find Dirac blows your sound stage open wider. When dialed in, it’s a great product!\n\nI have been listening with the Dirac calibration for a little over a week.\n\nI have had time to learn about tweaking it and have tried using some of the Harmon curves.\n\nIn my case the baked in curve was so close it seemed pointless to change, but I did it anyway.\n\nin all cases the overall sound is fine, I would not describe it as revolutionary in any way though.\n\nCompared to direct/pure direct, just like a multipoint calibration using MCACC or Audessey, the Dirac sound is different.\n\nI would not necessarily say different is better or worse though, just different.\n\nSometimes a movie or TV show sounds better in direct mode, sometimes it sounds better in Dirac mode.\n\nI got the VSX-LX505 so I could run the PS5 and Series X through it with 4k/VRR and that works very well.\n\nWhen I had the consoles connected to the TV and used ARC for the audio (Denon 2200W) the CEC made the universal remote unreliable which was a big problem for the spousal unit.\n\nIf the HDMI 2.1 features are not needed I would recommend keeping whatever gear you have, if they are needed I am satisfied with the VSX-LX505 and recommend it."
