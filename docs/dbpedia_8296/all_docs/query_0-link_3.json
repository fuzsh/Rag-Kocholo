Integra Live uses Pure Data as its signal processing engine and provides a new user interface written in Adobe Flex.\n\nThe software can be downloaded from the project website:\n\nhttp://www.integralive.org\n\nThe Adobe AIR runtime is required and can be downloaded from:\n\nhttp://get.adobe.com/air/\n\nIntegra Live aims to provide an intuitive and humane interface to advanced signal processing and interaction capabilities. It is currently being developed by the research centres of the Integra project, and will be used by Integra commissioned composers and performers in a series of concerts across Europe in 2011.\n\nPlease take time to try the software and give us your feedback via the online forum:\n\nhttp://integralive.uservoice.com\n\nAll best wishes!\n\nJamie"
