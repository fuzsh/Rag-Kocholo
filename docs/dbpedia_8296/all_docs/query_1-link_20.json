        "text": "Deal: you can save 25% OFF on the Roland Integra-7 rack/expander Synthesizer during Thomann’s 70th-anniversary sale.\n\nLet’s stay with Boss, or rather Roland. Not only has Thomann dropped the price on the SDS-3000D delay pedal, they also announced a good deal on a popular, aging Synthesizer.\n\nI’m talking about the Roland Integra-7, one of the last rack/expander synthesizers on the market, which is currently available at a bigger discount during Thomann’s birthday bash.\n\nDeal Roland Integra-7\n\nThomann has dropped the price of the Roland Integra-7 by 25%. Important is that this reduction is not made on the original RRP of $1999,99/1999€ but on the current European price of 1599€. With the 25% discount, the Integra-7 is now available for 1199€.\n\nIt could be that the I7 will be discontinued after 11-12 years on the market, and Thomann has bought the last batch at a good price. Only T knows this. I speculate that this could be the case. But what is it?\n\nThe Roland Integra-7 is one of the last rack synthesizers on the market. Roland released it in 2012, and since then, it has been a companion to many live musicians. Diego Tejeida, ex-Haken and now Temic keyboarder, has the Integra-7 in his live rack. A live rig video is linked.\n\nIntegra-7 does not have the latest synth engine (2012). It uses the SuperNatural sound engine, which has over 6,000 expressive sounds built in.\n\nThis includes SuperNatural sounds, PCM sounds, all 12 SRX expansion boards, and independent SN acoustic, synth, and drum sounds. Much of this is now available in the Roland Synthesizer and Fantom series.\n\nThe Integra-7 is multi-timbral and can stack up to 16 parts in a patch. A highlight is the motional surround engine, which lets users gradually control the distance and position of each part (17 in total) within a 360-degree sound field. Each of the 16 parts can also have its own multi-FX processor and EQ.\n\nProfessional I/O\n\nOn the back, the rack Synthesizer offers everything you need for I/O on stage: stereo XLR outputs, eight individual 1/4-inch outputs, a digital (coaxial) output, full MIDI interface (in/out/thru), and a USB port with data and 24-bit/96 kHz audio streaming.\n\nFurther, Roland has an INTEGRA-7 Editor app, allowing you to organize and control the unit from your iOS device.\n\nDeal & Not\n\nWhether the Roland Integra-7 deal is a deal is a tricky question. On the one hand, it is almost a vintage Roland synth (2012), and on the other hand, many of the SuperNatural sounds are already available in newer products (Fantom…). So you can ask yourself whether it is still relevant today.\n\nI think so, but it’s more for people who are looking for high-quality, easy-to-use sounds for the stage or studio. In addition, the rack format is almost a unique selling point in a time when there are so many keyboard synths. It could also be a tempting deal for live musicians who would like a replacement or second unit—one for the studio and one for the live rack.\n\nThe deal on the Roland Integra-7 is available now and you can get it for 1199€ instead of 1599€.\n\nMore information here: Roland\n\nAvailable at my partner Thomann"
