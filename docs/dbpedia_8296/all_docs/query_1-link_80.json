        "text": "Audio Section\n\nVideo Section\n\nNetwork & Internet Functions\n\nAirPlay/Bluetooth/USB Integration\n\nMultiroom Audio/Video Playback\n\nRemote & App Control\n\nConvenience Features\n\nAudio Section\n\nHigh Current 7-Channel Configurable Amplifier: The Integra DRX-2.4 AV receiver is equipped with a 7-channel amplifier rated at 80 watts (into 8-ohms, at 20Hz-20kHz, with 0.08%, driving 2 channels) with low impedance 4-ohm speaker driving capability. The DRX-2.4 combines accurate, noise-free signal processing with high-current power for dynamic speaker control. The result is pure, rich and authentic sound.\n\nMassive Custom Transformer: To supply the current needed to respond instantly to dynamic changes in the signal, the DRX-2.4 employs fully customized massive transformer and huge audio-grade capacitors. Even at high volume, the receiver never feels strained or unbalanced by complex musical passages or dynamic movie soundtracks.\n\nNon-Phase-Shift Amplification Circuitry: Non-phase-shift amp circuit topology prevents phase shifting by pushing the roll-off point higher than the listening-level frequency, resulting in a clear and cohesive sound.\n\nOptimum Gain Volume Circuitry: Optimum Gain Volume Circuitry adjusts the gain so that less than half the amount of attenuation is needed, ensuring the signal never comes close to the noise floor. This protects the signal against noise, resulting in a dramatically clearer sound.\n\nAmplifier Assignment: The 7-channel amplifier can be configured in a variety of ways to match your type of speaker setup.\n\nDolby Atmos/DTS:X (5.1.2ch): The Surround Back/Height speaker terminals are assigned to power a pair of Front Height, Rear Height, Overhead Ceiling, or Dolby Atmos-enabled speakers to create 5.1.2ch Dolby Atmos surround sound.\n\nDolby Atmos/DTS:X (5.1.2ch) + Zone 2: In this configuration, you can connect a Dolby Atmos 5.1.2ch speaker system in the Main Zone and a pair of speakers in Zone 2. When Zone 2 is off, all 5.1.2 channels will be used in the Main Zone. When Zone 2 is on, power to the two height speakers will be turned off and re-directed to the two speakers in Zone 2 and the Main Zone will receive only five channels of power for 5.1ch in the Main Zone.\n\nSurround Back (7.1ch): The Integra DRX-2.4 provides 7.1ch surround in your main listening area with dedicated Surround Back speakers.\n\nSurround Back (7.1ch ) + Zone 2: In this configuration, you can connect Front, Center, Surround, Surround Back, and Zone 2 speakers to the AV receiver. When Zone 2 is off, all seven channels will be used in the Main Zone. When Zone 2 is on, power to the two surround back (or front height) channels will be re-directed to the two speakers in Zone 2 and the Main Zone will receive only five channels of power for 5.1ch playback\n\nFront Bi-Amp (5.1ch): The Surround Back/Height speaker terminals can be reassigned and used along with the Front terminals to bi-amp the front speakers, providing improved bass & treble performance. When bi-amping the front speakers the receiver is limited to a 5.1ch speaker system in the main room (no Surround Back or Height speakers)\n\nHand Selected Audio Tuned Parts: Sound quality is the key factor in Integra's design process. The DRX-2.4 utilizes hand-selected parts including discrete output stage circuitry; a customized low-noise, high-performance transformer; audio tuned custom capacitors; gold-plated RCA jacks; and an anti-resonant metal chassis. These parts are selected for their audiophile quality and acoustically transparent characteristics. The result is lower noise and more accurate frequency response, outstanding signal tracking and linearity, unsurpassed dynamic range, precise channel separation, and sonic accuracy even under the most challenging circumstances.\n\nPrecision 24-Bit/192kHz DAC: The Integra DRX-2.4 employs 24-bit/192kHz digital-to-analog conversion for playback of 2ch Hi-Res audio (such as FLAC & DSD), as well a multichannel 3D audio (such as Dolby Atmos & DTS:X).\n\nVector Linear Shaping Circuitry (Front Channels Only): Integra developed Vector Linear Shaping Circuitry (VLSC) to reassemble the signal in its original form following processing. Unlike conventional filters, VLSC removes pulse noise generated in D/A conversion, allowing the sound wave to be reproduced with extremely high fidelity for a smooth analog signal. The signal's data is converted between sampling points and joined with analog vectors in real time to produce a smooth output wave form. The result is a virtually noiseless, smooth, analog signal that brings out even the most subtle of nuances in music sources.\n\nPLL Jitter-Cleaning Circuit Technology: PLL (Phase Locked Loop) jitter-cleaning circuit technology reduces jitter by comparing the input and output phases of the digital signal and creating an accurate clock waveform. This enhances the precision of digital signal processing and noticeably improves audio quality. Jitter-cleaning technology works for S/PDIF audio signals only.\n\nDigital Filter: You can switch the type of digital filter in the audio DAC. You can choose \"Slow\" (gives the sound a soft and fluid feel), \"Sharp\" (gives the sound more structure and firmer feel) or \"Auto\" (auto). The setting can be separately set for each source input. The Digital Filter only can be set when the sampling frequency is 44.1kHz or more.\n\nCompatible Digital Audio Formats: The AV receiver supports the following stereo & multichannel digital audio formats through its HDMI jacks and optical/coax digital inputs.\n\nDolby Atmos & DTS:X: Dolby Atmos and DTS:X allow engineers to map sound anywhere in 3D space with effects moving from speaker to speaker all around the room and wrapping your audience in the latest films and games. You can also enjoy your 3D speaker layout with classic titles thanks to Dolby Surround and DTS Neural:X which find overhead cues in legacy soundtracks and upmix for awesome spatial realism. In addition, when playing any Dolby or DTS audio soundtrack, engaging Dolby Atmos Height Virtualizer or DTS Virtual:X enables a more immersive listening experience, creating a virtual surround and height effect from traditional speaker layouts without employing additional surround or height speakers.\n\nDSP Listening Modes: DSP Listening Modes, combined with Dolby Digital & DTS processing, produce more realistic, powerful sound effects for your movie and music sound tracks based on the type of content and your home theater setup. You can choose from the following -\n\nOrchestra: Suitable for classical or operatic music. This mode emphasizes the surround channels in order to widen the sound image, and simulates the natural reverberation of a large hall.\n\nStudio-Mix: Suitable for rock or pop music. Listening to music in this mode creates a lively sound field with a powerful acoustic image, like being at a club or rock concert.\n\nTV Logic: Suitable for TV shows produced in a TV studio. This mode enhances the surround effects to the entire sound to give clarity to voices and create a realistic acoustic image.\n\nUnplugged: Suitable for acoustic instruments, vocals and jazz. This mode emphasizes the front stereo image, giving the impression of being right in front of the stage.\n\nMultichannel (Multich)/Game: Multichannel mode is suitable for playing sources recorded in multichannel PCM. The preamplifier also offers four different Gaming modes - RPG, Action, Rock, and Sports.\n\nStereo/All Channel Stereo (AllCh Stereo): In Stereo mode, sound is output from the front left and right speakers and subwoofer. In All Channel Stereo Mode, stereo sound is output from all speakers - ideal for background music.\n\nMono/Full Mono: In Mono mode, when the input signal is analog or PCM, the left and right front speakers output the sound in monaural. In Full Mono mode, all speakers output the same sound in mono, so the sound you hear is the same regardless of where you are within the listening room.\n\nTheater-Dimensional (T-D): In this mode, you can enjoy a virtual playback of multichannel surround sound even with only two or three speakers. This works by controlling how sounds reach the listener's left and right ears.\n\nDirect Mode: In Direct mode, audio from the input source is output without surround-sound processing. This mode delivers pure sound with minimum sound quality adjustment and filtration.\n\nAccuEQ Calibration w/ AccuReflex: The DRX-2.4 incorporates AccuEQ calibration technology and comes with an auto calibration microphone. AccuEQ calibration technology reveals the true potential of your speakers by eliminating standing waves from your listening space. These acoustic peaks distort the audio image and prevent your loudspeakers from voicing the sound as their designers intended. AccuEQ utilizes Partial Band Equalization and only corrects frequency response below a certain point, leaving high-order harmonics untouched - so your speakers are free to reproduce the emotion in the recording faithfully and naturally. AccuEQ also includes three memory presets you can use to save your own customized EQ settings, perhaps tailored to suit different content such as movies, music, or games.\n\nSpeaker Measurement: The first-round of AccuEQ measurements set the distance, sound pressure level, and crossover of your speakers. Distance and level calibration ensure all channels are treated equally. Crossover measurement selects the correct point to roll off low-frequency sound to the subwoofer for seamless speaker integration.\n\nRoom Measurements: In the second round of AccuEQ measurements, your room's sonic characteristics are evaluated. Using this information, AccuEQ is able to prevent standing waves from forming by adjusting frequency response.\n\nAccuReflex Measurements: AccuEQ also incorporates AccuReflex technology to align the phase of up-firing \"height\" speakers with the sound coming directly from your other speakers. Any delay is resolved so that everything arrives at your ears at the same time. The result is cohesive reproduction of object-based soundtracks.\n\nAudio Enhancements: The Integra DRX-2.4 receiver provides various audio enhancements to deliver a high-quality listening experience every time.\n\nCinemaFilter: The CinemaFilter softens overly bright movie soundtracks. Movie soundtracks are typically mixed for a large theater (relative to your home theater) with lots of soft seats and thick curtains on the walls. Home theater settings often lack these high frequency absorbing wall treatments, making the soundtrack sound too bright. CinemaFilter accounts for this and for many movies sounds more natural at home.\n\nMusic Optimizer: The Music Optimizer function enhances the sound quality of compressed music files. The Music Optimizer function only works with PCM digital audio input signals with a sampling rate below 48kHz, analog input signals, and Bluetooth audio.\n\nLate Night Feature: The Late Night feature limits the dynamic range of Dolby Digital recordings. Limiting the dynamic range makes it easier to find a volume that ensures the quiet sounds are not too quiet and the loud sounds are not too loud for night time listening. This allows you to comfortably listen to without the need to constantly adjust the volume to keep from waking family/neighbors. The choices are: Off, Low, and High. This feature only works with Dolby Digital Encoded software and the depth of the feature will vary based on the individual software package.\n\nDialog Improvements: The receiver offers a variety of dialog enhancements that make it easier to hear dialog and vocal when listening to movie and music soundtracks. The Vocal mode emphasizes movie dialog and music vocals, so you can hear them more easily amongst the movie effects and musical instruments. The Vocal mode can be set from 1 (low) to 5 (high). Dialog Control allows you to boost the dialog in a DTS:X soundtrack to make dialog more intelligible in noisy environments. Center Spread expands the center channel signal to left and right front speakers to create a wider frontal audio image for the listener, when in Dolby Surround mode.\n\nBass Management: The Integra AV receiver offers Double Bass and Tone Control to get the most bass impact out of your system. You can activate the Double Bass function in order to boost bass output even more by feeding bass sounds to the front left/right speakers, center-channel, and powered subwoofer. In addition, you can independently adjust the Bass (20Hz) and Treble (20kHz) of the receiver's Front L/R channels from -10 to +10 dB.\n\nVolume & Level Setup: The Integra AV receiver provides the following volume & level settings.\n\nMaximum Volume: Use this feature to set the receiver's maximum volume level for the Main Zone and Zone B. This feature is useful to avoid turning the volume too loud by mistake. You can set the Max Volume from 50 to 99, or Off (disabled).\n\nPower On Volume: Use this feature to set the volume level when the power is turned on in the Main Zone and Zone B. You can choose between Last (same as the volume when the unit was turned off), Min, or 0.5 to 99.5, or Max.\n\nMy Input Volume: You can set specific source inputs to turn on at a specific volume level when you switch to that particular source. Choose from Last, Min, 0.5 to 81.5, or Max.\n\nMute Level: Set the volume lowered from the listening volume when \"Mute\" is selected. Choose from 0, -40dB, or -20 dB.\n\nHeadphone Level: With this setting, you can specify the headphone volume (-12 to +12dB) relative to the main volume. This is useful if there's a volume difference between your speakers and your headphones.\n\neARC (Enhanced Audio Return Channel): This feature of the AV receiver's main HDMI monitor output allows audio to be sent from your compatible TV to the receiver through the same HDMI cable already being used to send audio and video to your TV. This eliminates the need for extra cables connected to your television. eARC (Enhanced Audio Return Channel) will support uncompressed audio formats like Dolby TrueHD, Dolby Atmos, DTS:X, & DTS HD Master Audio - where as the previous ARC (Audio Return Channel) was limited to only Dolby Digital, Dolby Digital Plus, DTS, DTS HD, and PCM.\n\nAnalog Audio Outputs: The Integra DRX-2.4 is outfitted with the following analog audio outputs.\n\nBinding-Post Speaker Terminals: There are binding-post terminals for all speaker connections - Front, Center, Surround, Surround Back/Height, and Zone 2. The binding post terminals will accept bare-wire (up to 10AWG), pin-connectors, and banana plugs (single only). Use 4- to 16-ohm speakers (there is an impedance setting in the receiver's menu).\n\nFront & Dual Subwoofer Outputs: The AV receiver has a set of preouts that can be used for the channels (these same preouts can also be used for Zone 2/Zone 2). The receiver also offers two subwoofer outputs to connect dual powered subs for extra bass. The dual outputs are wired in parallel and share the same input signal (they are not discrete).\n\nHeadphones: When headphones are plugged into the full-size 1/4\" jack on the front panel, all the speakers are automatically muted. The receiver supports headphones with impedances of 8 to 600-ohm.\n\nPhono Input: The DRX-2.4 has a discrete low-noise phono pre-amp and is outfitted with Phono (MM) input for connection of a turntable with a moving magnet cartridge so you can enjoy listening to your vinyl records. There is also a ground screw terminal.\n\nAM/FM Tuner: With the built-in tuner you can enjoy AM and FM radio stations. You can store your favorite stations as presets for quick selection. You can store a combination of up to 40 of your favorite FM/AM radio stations as presets.\n\nVideo Features\n\nHDMI 2.1: Featuring a total of six HDMI inputs (three HDMI 2.1 / three HDMI 2.0b) and two HDMI 2.1 outputs, the Integra DRX-2.4 incorporates an advanced video section that features some of the latest HDMI specifications; including support for 4K ultra-HD video pass-through, HDCP 2.3 compatibility, BT.2020 Wide Color Gamut, and 4:4:4 Pure Color sub-sampling. The three HDMI 2.1 inputs support up to 4K/120Hz and 8K/60Hz video pass-through (up to 40Gbps).\n\n4K/120 Hz + 8K/60Hz Pass-Through: Three of the receiver's HDMI inputs (1-2-3) and both monitor outputs support up to 4K (3840x2160 pixels) video @ 120 frames per second, as well as 8K (7680 x 4320) video @ 60 frames per second (up to 40Gbps). The other three HDMI inputs (4-5-6) are limited to 4K/60Hz (18Gbps), 1080p/i, 720p, and 480p/ video signals.\n\nHDCP 2.3 Compliant: All of receiver's HDMI inputs and outputs support HDCP 2.3, which fully complies with the latest copyright protection standard for 4K/HDR video transmission.\n\n4:4:4 Color Subsampling: The rear-panel HDMI inputs and monitor outputs support RGB, YCbCr 4:4:4, YCbCr 4:2:2, and YCbCr 4:2:0 color subsampling (pixel depth and frame rate will vary). With 4:4:4 color subsampling, luminance (brightness) and chroma (color) are sampled at the same rate; resulting in an RGB color palette as big as the video sampling rate for a video image with more colors, plus greater color accuracy and detail. The front-panel HDMI input is limited to 4:2:0.\n\nWide Color Gamut (BT.2020): The BT.2020 color standard delivers a much wider color gamut and represents about 75% of the total visual color spectrum, while the current Rec. 709 color standard selected as the color space for HDTVs and early generation 4K Ultra HDTVs covers only 35% of the total visual color spectrum.\n\nHDMI Video Upscaling (up to 4K/8K): The Integra AV receiver's video processor provides upscaling of 1080p HDMI video sources to 4K (3840x2160 pixels) when connected to a 4K compatible TV; as well as upscaling of 4K HDMI video sources to 8K/60Hz (7680 x 4320 pixels) when the receiver is connected to an 8K TV. HDMI Video upscaling is only supported by the AV receiver's main HDMI output (not the sub HDMI Zone 2 output).\n\nDual HDMI Outputs: The dual HDMI outputs can simultaneously output the same audio/video signal to two TVs, or you can assign the second HDMI output to Zone 2 to display a different HDMI source (1-2-3 inputs) in another room; video is output at the resolution supported by both TVs. When displaying the same video source from both HDMI outputs, the main HDMI output and second HDMI output both can support up to 8K/60Hz (40Gbps). If displaying a different video source from the main HDMI output and Zone 2 HDMI out, then the main HDMI output can support up to 8K/60Hz (40Gbps), while the Zone HDMI output is limited to 4K/60Hz (24Gbps).\n\nHDR (High Dynamic Range): HDR (High Dynamic Range) video provides enhanced picture quality by simultaneously enabling greater detail for both the dark and bright parts of an image. HDR reproduces a greater dynamic range of luminosity or brightness levels, creating greater contrast. This increased contrast reveals the subtle nuances of the image, from detailed blacks and shadows to the brightest whites and colors, plus greater depth. This receiver supports two HDR formats - HDR10, HDR10+ Hybrid Log-Gamma (HLG), & Dolby Vision.\n\nHDR10: HDR10 is an open standard and currently the most popular HDR format on the market. It uses static metadata at the start of a movie to tell the receiver and your TV that the video content is encoded using HDR.\n\nHDR10+: HDR10+ is a new open standard that leverages dynamic metadata to produce enhanced contrast and colors on an expanded range of televisions. HDR10+ incorporates dynamic metadata that allows the adjustment of brightness levels on a scene-by-scene or even frame-by-frame basis. By applying individualized tone mapping to each scene, HDR10+ delivers an incredible viewing experience. The picture quality offers an enhanced visual experience with more detailed expressions, brighter shadow areas and more accurate color renderings that stay true to the creator's original intent.\n\nHybrid-Log Gamma: HLG (Hybrid-Log Gamma) is primarily designed for live video feed and over-the-air broadcasts. It uses no pre-encoded metadata and is backwards compatible with SDR. HLG's native compatibility allows much of today's existing SDR infrastructure to be re-used for HDR in the future.\n\nDolby Vision: Unlike HDR 10 which contains static metadata and HLG which uses no metadata, Dolby Vision uses dynamic metadata technology which sets individual color and brightness levels for each and every scene. Dolby works directly with filmmakers at major Hollywood studios to create superior HDR video masters of blockbuster movies.\n\nEnhanced Gaming: HDMI 2.1 enhancements for gamers include 4K/120Hz HDR pass-through that enables ultra-fast motion; VRR (Variable Refresh Rate) which eliminates lag, stutter, and frame-tearing for fluid gameplay; ALLM (Auto Low Latency Mode) to optimize latency from source to screen; plus QFT (Quick Frame Transport) which limits lag for a smoother video gaming experience.\n\n4K/120Hz Pass-Through: 4K/120Hz pass-through enables ultra-fast motion UHD images to be crisp and razor-sharp; and sports, action movies, and high-performance gaming benefit significantly.\n\nVariable Refresh Rate (VRR): Support for Variable Refresh Rate (VRR) allows the TV to adapt to certain Game console's frame rate. This helps to reduce or eliminate lag, stutter and frame tearing for more fluid and better detailed gameplay.\n\nAuto Low Latency Mode (ALLM): The receiver will enter ALLM (Auto Low Latency Mode) when it detects a gaming signal from a compatible device (such as a Xbox One) and allows for a smooth, lag-free gaming experience.\n\nQuick Frame Transport (QFT): Quick Frame Transport (QFT) transmits each frame at a higher rate to decrease \"display latency\", which is the amount of time between a frame being ready for transmission in the GPU and that frame being completely displayed. Enjoy reduced latency for smoother, tear-free entertainment experience.\n\nOther HDMI Features: The DRX-2.4 AV receiver's HDMI connectivity also offers 3D video pass-through, Deep Color & x.v. Color support, as well as an auto LipSync function.\n\nDeep Color & x.v.Color Support: The AV receiver supports Deep Color and x.v.Color content, which can display a larger color range than standard-definition schemes. The result is a more lifelike, vibrant picture\n\n3D-Ready: All HDMI jacks will accept 3D video from your 3D-ready Blu-ray player and output the video signal in 3D to your 3D-ready flat-panel television.\n\nAV Sync: The AV Sync feature can automatically synchronize HDMI audio and video (for any HDMI jack) that has gotten out of sync due to the complex digital video processing being performed by your HDMI-compatible TV. With AV Sync, the audio delay required to synchronize the audio and video is calculated and applied automatically by the AV receiver. You can also manually correct the audio delay using AV Sync.\n\nHDMI Through: When enabling the HDMI Through function, regardless of whether the AV receiver is \"On\" or in \"Standby\", both audio/video streams from an HDMI input will be output to your television, via the receiver HDMI monitor output. You can select between three HDMI Through modes.\n\nAuto: Detects the signal and automatically selects the input sources.\n\nSource: Selects the HDMI input source for which the HDMI Through function in enabled.\n\nLast: The HDMI Through function is activated on the input source selected at the time of setting the AV receiver to the \"standby\" mode.\n\nVideo Select: It is possible to play audio and video from different sources simultaneously. For example, you can play audio via Bluetooth and video from your Blu-ray player. This function is only effective when an input with audio only (Network, Bluetooth, or Tuner) has been selected initially.\n\nNetwork & Internet Functions\n\nWired or Wireless Network Connection: The Integra DRX-2.4 AV receiver supports a wired Ethernet RJ-45 (LAN) or wireless dual-band (2.4/5GHZ) WiFi 802.11ac (2x2 MIMO) network connection.
