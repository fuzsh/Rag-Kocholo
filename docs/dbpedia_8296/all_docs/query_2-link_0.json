        "text": "Integra Live was originally developed for GNU/Linux as well as Windows and Mac OS. The Integra Live GUI is based on Adobe Flex, and one of the reasons we chose this framework was cross-platform support provided by the Adobe AIR runtime.\n\nHowever, when Adobe withdrew support for the Adobe AIR runtime on Linux, we had to cease development on the Linux platform.\n\nWe are now developing version 2.0 of the software on JUCE, which means that Integra Live will be available on Linux once v.2 is released.\n\nCurrently Integra Live runs as three separate processes: the graphical user interface (GUI), the Integra server, and the Pd audio host. These processes communicate with each other using networking protocols on the local machine. Several ports therefore need to be unblocked in order for the software to work.\n\nIn a future version of the software all of these components will be combined into a single process and there will no longer be any need to unblock ports."
