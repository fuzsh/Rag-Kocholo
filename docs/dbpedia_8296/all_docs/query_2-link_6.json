        "text": "Integra Live is a new application that’s designed to it easy to use interactive audio processing to create new music. According to the developers, it ‘opens up new possibilities for those seeking an entry point into interactive live electronics’.\n\nWith Integra Live you don’t have to write code or patch objects to create interesting live processing. Neither do you have to deal with the complexities of finding, loading and learning external plugins. The software provides a library of built-in audio processing modules to let you get started with interactive audio.\n\nWith the Integra Live routing panel, anything can be connected everything else. External MIDI controllers can be routed to module parameters, or parameters can be routed to each other.\n\nThis allows complex one-to-many mappings and advanced operations such as automatic event triggering through a single simple interface. Parameters have non-linear ranges where you’d expect, allowing for more musical control over details such as filter cutoff and delay times. Scaling is of course fully adjustable.\n\nFor those who like to express themselves through text, all module parameters in Integra Live can be scripted through Integra script a lightweight superset of the Lua language. In just a few lines of simple code a parameter can be set to change randomly or conditionally based on the values of other parameters.\n\nIntegra Live has been built from the ground up using open source software and open standards. The Integra Live audio processing host runs in the Pure Data engine, communicating with the Integra server via Open Sound Control messaging. The graphical front end is written using the open source Apache Flex framework. Integra Live itself is freely available, with installers for OS X & Windows, under the GNU GPL license with source code available on Sourceforge.\n\nSee the Integra Live site for more info.\n\nIf you’ve used Integra Live, let us know what you think of it!"
