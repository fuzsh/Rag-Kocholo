        "text": "9,285\n\nSAP Managed Tags:\n\nC4C Sales,\n\nC4C Service\n\nI want to share my “lessons learned” regarding https-configuration of CTI / Live-Activity\n\nMy knowledge is based on following sources:\n\nBasics are described in help.sap.com\n\nhttps://help.sap.com/viewer/cea15f900ca04c4faa35d3044577fe27/1708/en-US/8ccee879241742fc824eff0bfe7d...\n\nA straight-forward quick-setup can be found in “old” SCN-archive\n\nhttps://archive.sap.com/documents/docs/DOC-61429\n\nSome new features in 1702 – but also a lot of basics\n\nhttps://blogs.sap.com/2017/03/13/whats-new-in-1702-sap-hybris-cloud-for-customer-call-center-integra...\n\nVery recent FAQ:\n\nhttps://blogs.sap.com/2017/06/06/faqs-related-to-cti-integration-in-sap-hybris-cloud-for-customer/\n\nSome hints regarding http\n\nFirst advice: Do the initial setup/testing using HTTP. Once this is working, switch to HTTPS.\n\nAs mentioned before, my favourite setup-how to is https://archive.sap.com/documents/docs/DOC-61429\n\nUsing Microsoft-Internet-Explorer, follow https://archive.sap.com/documents/docs/DOC-61430 . In my case I also had to add localhost to trusted-sites in addition.\n\nUsing Google Chrome, https://archive.sap.com/documents/docs/DOC-61611 is still correct. But as shown here this ends in security-warnings\n\nThis is a “no-go” from my point of view: …don’t care about this security warning, it’s safe... just ignore & continue…\n\n(Please comment, how you think about this!)\n\nHow to switch to https\n\nPreparations for local client\n\nMainly you have to follow help.sap.com: https://help.sap.com/viewer/cea15f900ca04c4faa35d3044577fe27/1708/en-US/186e3fef763d1014bf40f03714be...\n\nUnfortunately this refers to a deprecated MS-tool named makecert. The new tool is named New-SelfSignedCertificate (according to https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa386968(v=vs.85).aspx ).\n\nUnfortunately I wasn’t able to transfer the settings to New-SelfsignedCertifacate. Solution in my case: My IT-Webserver-colleague created a webserver-certificate for CN localhost (Thanks Daniel).\n\nSo I got a certificate stored in a .pfx-file\n\nThis has to be installed as Administrator (doubleclick) and saved to “Local computer” (not current user!).\n\nNow you have to lookup the fingerprint of this certificate: Please start certlm.msc (as administrator) and navigate to “Own certifactes”/ certifcates, details-tab and look for the fingerprint\n\n(sorry for “german” screenshot)\n\nThis fingerprint has to be copied to clipboard. Spaces have to be deleted, and it has to be “pure” ASCII.\n\nIn my case the fingerprint is b4a7274eb7bcd41a0536353addfd3b3c5aca3948 (your’s will be different)\n\nNow proceed according to help.sap.com with following command (as administrator using cmd)\n\nnetsh http add sslcert ipport=0.0.0.0:36731 certhash=b4a7274eb7bcd41a0536353addfd3b3c5aca3948 appid={7e46cd40-39c6-4813-b414-019ad22e55b2}\n\nThis will “connect” the certificate with the C4C-Client-Adapter.\n\nFinally check the result: Call up URL https://localhost:36731/CTIMain.htm\n\nIt should look like this\n\nImportant is, the green lock and the word “Sicher” = “Secure”.\n\nEverything else means, the certificate isn’t correct yet.\n\nCheck/Change C4C-Liveactivity to use https\n\nThis is hidden inside Scoping (strange, but that’s the way it is):\n\nTest it\n\nNow you can test this using the Simulate-button of CTI-Adapter\n\n(I deleted browsercache to be sure)\n\nIn my case I struggled according to FAQ topic 4) https://blogs.sap.com/2017/06/06/faqs-related-to-cti-integration-in-sap-hybris-cloud-for-customer/\n\nF12 – Developer-Tools & SAP-Support have been the solution in my case.\n\nFinal Result\n\nSimulate Call works (Live activity is updated) and Webbrowser shows a “Secure” connection.\n\nFYI:\n\n1) Currently I still struggle with a tiny “warning” regarding unsecure scripts:\n\n(ongoing SAP-incident). Nevertheless it seems not to interfere the functionality. I’ll update this article, once this is fixed.\n\n2) I intend to add another blog-article with details regarding Inbound-CTI-Setup using CISCO Jabber in near future.\n\n3) Please check also my “idea” how to improve Live-Activity https://ideas.sap.com/D43490"
