Tap “Other options,” “Save on another device,” or similar (if available), then follow the onscreen instructions for saving a passkey. See Use security keys to sign in to your Apple ID account on iPhone.\n\nIf you’re using a device not associated with your Apple ID (such as a computer at a public library, an internet cafe, or a friend’s house), and you have your iPhone with you, you can sign in to apps or websites on that device using the passkeys you created for them.\n\nNote: The instructions for using a passkey on another device can vary depending on the app, website, or browser, but they typically consist of steps similar to the ones below.\n\nOn the other device, go to the website or app and enter your user name in the account name field on the sign-in screen.\n\nSelect “Other options,” “Passkey from nearby device,” or similar, then follow the onscreen instructions to display a QR code on the screen.\n\nUse your iPhone camera to scan the QR code.\n\nThe passkey that’s saved to iCloud Keychain completes the sign-in automatically.\n\nIf you have your iPhone with you, you can create a passkey while using a device not associated with your Apple ID (such as a computer at a public library, an internet cafe, or a friend’s house) and save it to iCloud Keychain instead of the device you’re using to create the passkey.\n\nNote: The instructions for creating a passkey can vary depending on the app, website, or browser, but they typically consist of steps similar to the ones below.\n\nOn the other device, go to the sign-in page for a supported website or app, then do one of the following:\n\nIf you’re setting up a new account: Tap the button or link for setting up new accounts, then enter a new username.\n\nIf you already have an account: Sign in with your account name and password, then go to the account settings or management screen.\n\nWhen you see the option to save a passkey for the account, select “Other options,” “Save on another device,” or similar (instead of Continue).\n\nNote: If you don’t see a passkey option, it means the app or website doesn’t currently support passkeys.\n\nSelect “Save a passkey on a device with a camera,” or similar, then follow the onscreen instructions to display a QR code on the screen.\n\nUse your iPhone camera to scan the QR code.\n\nThe passkey is saved to your iPhone and iCloud Keychain.\n\nYou might need to create a new passkey to replace the existing one (if, for example, you previously shared it with someone to whom you no longer want to give access).\n\nTo change a passkey, follow the steps for an existing account in Create and save a passkey using your iPhone or Create a passkey on a device that’s not your own."
