        "text": "— We take our content seriously. This article was written by a real person at BREL.\n\nToronto home buyers want safe neighbourhoods, but what does a safe neighbourhood look like? How do you know what’s really going on behind closed doors?\n\nThe Toronto Police Services publicly shares this information (click here to access the interactive dashboard). It’s not for the faint of heart (and definitely not for my mother to see). It’s hard to believe what goes on right around us actually.\n\nIf you’re looking to get into Toronto’s real estate market and looking for a safe neighbourhood for your family, it’s better to be armed with the facts. So grab your cup of coffee, lock the doors, and check out the Top 10 Worst Toronto Neighbourhoods for Crime.\n\nWorst Toronto Neighbourhoods for Crime – 2020\n\nRank Name Assaults 1 Church-Yonge Corridor 761 2 Waterfront Communities – The Island 757 3 Moss Park 756 4 Bay Street Corridor 516 5 Kensington-Chinatown 423 6 Downsview Roding-CFB 357 7 Woburn 348 8 York University Heights 341 9 West Hill 336 10 Mimico (includes Humber Bay Shores) 286\n\nRank Name Shootings 1 Glenfield-Jane Heights 34 2 Black Creek 18 3 Mount Olive Silverstone-Jamestown 16 4 Woburn 15 5 Malvern 15 6 Yorkdale-Glen Park 14 7 Flemingdon Park 13 8 York University Heights 12 9 Eglinton East 11 10 Englemount-Lawrence 11\n\nRank Name Break & enters 1 Waterfront Communities-The Island 351 2 Church-Yonge Corridor 241 3 Bay Street Corridor 227 4 Annex 203 5 Moss Park 201 6 Kensington-Chinatown 175 7 Mount Pleasant West 158 8 Dovercourt-Wallace Emerson-Junction 155 9 South Riverdale 142 10 Niagara 108\n\nRank Name Robbery 1 Church-Yonge Corridor 138 2 Moss Park 130 3 Waterfront Communities-The Island 83 4 Bay Street Corridor 82 5 West Humber Clairville 75 6 Downsview-Roding-CBF 55 7 Woburn 55 8 Glenfield-Jane Heights 49 9 York University Heights 47 10 Annex 44\n\nRank Name Auto Theft 1 West Humber-Clairville 396 2 York University Heights 184 3 Downsview-Roding-CBF 153 4 Islington-City Centre West 150 5 Glenfield-Jane Heights 124 6 Humber Summit 110 7 Woburn 96 8 Wexford/Maryvale 93 9 Yorkdale-Glen Park 87 10 Mount Olive Silverstone-Jamestown 85\n\nRank Name Theft over $5000 1 Waterfront Communities-The Island 56 2 West Humber-Clairville 56 3 Church-Yonge Corridor 44 4 Bay Street Corridor 43 5 York University Heights 43 6 Annex 33 7 Islington-City Centre West 29 8 Kensington-Chinatown 27 9 South Riverdale 24 10 Downsview-Roding-CBF 23\n\nI grew up in a town of 6,000 people where we didn’t lock our doors at night. Do I still feel safe in Toronto after looking up the stats in my own neighbourhood? I do. But I still lock the doors at night."
