        "text": "History of Whitchurch – Stouffville\n\nWhitchurch Township dates back to 1792 as part of the newly-created York County. The name comes from the village of Whitchurch in Herefordshire, England where the wife of Lieutenant Governor Sir John Graves Simco was born.\n\nWhile settlement in the area dates back to the 1790’s, the first regional survey wasn’t carried out until 1800. Along with a 2nd survey 2 years later, the township established a system of land concessions which allowed land to be easily allotted to settlers.\n\nEvidence of this system, which parcelled out 200-acre lots, is still visible today in the layout of the road network. Each square in the grid of rural roads represents the boundaries of original concession blocks.\n\nTypical of GTA towns, the first settlers in the area were Quakers and Mennonites, pacifist groups from New England States who were seeking religious freedom and to escape from conflict. Due to their resourcefulness and settling abilities, the Upper Canada Government granted them permission to settle with the hope that a population centre would attract more settlers.\n\nThe first settlements in the township were built in the “4-corners” model at the intersections of main roads or near streams where mills could be built to process felled timber. One such hamlet would eventually give its name to the town of Whitchurch – Stouffville. It was called Stouffville and was named after a Mennonite settler named Abraham Stouffer.\n\nStouffer’s successful mill encouraged other Mennonite settlers to join him, and by 1830 “Stouffville road” as it became known was carved through pristine woods to connect with York (Toronto). The establishment of a post office in 1832 cemented the name “Stouffville” as opposed to Stoufferville.\n\nStouffville grew rapidly, perhaps foreshadowing the rapid growth of today’s town, and by 1877 it was officially incorporated as a village.\n\nRapid growth continued thanks largely to the Toronto and Nipissing Railway which had arrived a few years earlier. By 1877 a second track was built north to Lake Simcoe. Although the railway’s primary purpose was industrial it also made travel throughout Ontario more convenient, further promoting growth.\n\nBy the turn of the century Stouffville had modern amenities such as its own newspapers, as well as telegraph and telephone connections. By this time the once lush forests of the region had been stripped down to only 7% of all land being woodland.\n\nEvidence of this deforestation is clear today, though the 1911 reforestation act has brought back a good deal of woodland with conservation areas like Bruce’s Mill Conservation Area and the Porritt Tract York Regional Forest. Today, the area is one of the most successful restorations of degraded landscapes in North America.\n\nLoss of the forestry industry caused the township to Stagnate over most of the 1900’s, up until the ‘70’s when the growth of Toronto incentivized commuting from out of town. What resulted was the amalgamation of Whitchurch Township and the Village of Stouffville into a single governing body called the Town of Whitchurch-Stouffville.\n\nAlthough the township is still officially known as Whitchurch-Stouffville the Town decided to rebrand by dropping the word “Whitchurch” from all signage. As a large and spacious stretch of rural land not far from Toronto, Whitchurch-Stouffville has a promising future as one of the GTA’s suburban communities.\n\nOverview\n\nWhitchurch-Stouffville, pronounced “Wit-Church Stew-Ville” is a largely rural township of the Greater Toronto Area located on the eastern border of York Region. With the motto “Country Close To The City” it’s no surprise that this pocket of Ontario is one of the fastest growing communities in the GTA.\n\nAlthough the township sits at just over 45,000 residents according to the latest census, it’s also the 2nd fastest growing municipality in York Region with a population increase of nearly 25% between 2011 and 2016. With a projected 97% of the population growth rooted in the Community of Stouffville, it’s shaping up as a major suburb for the GTA.\n\nReal Estate in Whitchurch-Stouffville\n\nReal estate in Whitchurch-Stouffville is mostly made up of single-family detached homes.\n\nWhat’s more, most Whitchurch-Stouffville residents own their homes. In a 2012 report issued by the Town, home ownership in the township is considerably higher than the provincial average of 71.4% with 85.3% of local residents owning their homes.\n\nAlthough there are some historic homes in the Whitchurch-Stouffville, the modern population boom began in the 1970’s when suburbs were already a common fixture in urban planning. As a result, The Town of Stouffville has a modern layout and design with winding streets, cul-de-sacs, and plenty of greenspace.\n\nOutside of the city there are numerous country estates and micro-communities, many of which are quite affluent.\n\nFor home-buyers seeking privacy, Whitchurch-Stouffville is an ideal choice. Since the turn of the millennium the number of private residences has practically doubled, creating ample opportunity for the GTA home buyer who wants a break from the city.\n\nInterested in learning more about Whitchurch-Stouffville real estate?

Route 9 runs a course around Stouffville before going down Highway 69 to around Highway 407. There was a route 15 which connected the town to Yonge St., but it was cancelled due to low ridership.\n\nTravelling By Rail\n\nStaying true to its history as a town that was made by the railroad, Whitchurch-Stouffville remains well connected by track. In fact, the entire north-eastern branch of the GO Network gets its name from the town.\n\nRiders can take the Stouffville line up to Lincolnville and right back down to Union Station. That’s where travel opportunities truly open up, since there’s no VIA Rail service on the Stouffville tracks.\n\nTravelling By Car\n\nWhitchurch-Stouffville is covered by a grid of smaller, rural highways but the primary roads are Highways 408, 407 (toll road), and 404.
