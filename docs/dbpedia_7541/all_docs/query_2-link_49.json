There's no need to spend decades saving for a down paymentâ€”our homes don't require one. Families benefit from an affordable mortgage structured to their income, with a secondary mortgage provided by us to make up the difference. This ensures that initially, no family will allocate more than 32% of their income towards housing costs, allowing them to save, invest in education, and plan for the future with greater peace of mind.\n\nWe offer a variety of quality condominiums and stacked townhomes in Toronto, Brampton, Caledon, Durham Region, Toronto & York Region for families, couples, and individuals."
