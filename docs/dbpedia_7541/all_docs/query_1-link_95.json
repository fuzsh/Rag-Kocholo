Alexander established both woollen and saw mills until 1832 when the decrease in water forced him to relocate east to a new location along the Don River. Due to the relocation of the mills, the land began being used for farming which lasted until the early 1900s. Once the Bayview Bridge was completed, it was a defining moment for the Bridle Path area as it was considered for residential development. In 1929 the first property was built at 2 The Bridle Path. The developer, Hubert Daniel Bull Page believed that the construction of this first property would entice other prospective buyers. The neighbourhood was initially designed and constructed with an interconnected network of equestrian Bridle Paths which residents used as early roads. Since then these paths have long been paved over however the extra wide streets and the naming of the neighbourhood both pay mementos to the past.\n\nHomes in Bridle Path\n\nTypically, properties in Bridle Path house some of the most sought-after residential amenities.
