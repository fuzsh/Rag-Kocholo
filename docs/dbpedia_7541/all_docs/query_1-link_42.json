        "text": "Census of Canada, 1871\n\nThe 1871 census was the first federal census. It started on April 2, 1871 and had 211 questions.\n\nOnly Schedule 1 with the names is fully indexed in the census database, along with schedule 2 for Ontario only. Most of the 9 schedules do still exist, though only schedules 1, 2 and 6 include names. The other schedules do not - these are keyed to schedule 1 by page and line number.\n\nYou can only access Schedules 2 through 9 via digitized microfilm. The schedules are arranged in numerical order for each sub-district. For example, on reel C-10387, you will find District 183, Gloucester County, Sub-district b-1, Bathurst, schedules 1 to 8, followed by Sub-district b-2, Bathurst, schedules 1 to 8, etc.\n\nPlease see 1871 districts and sub-districts to find the right microfilm number.\n\nEarly censuses like 1871 also counted sea-going vessels, temporary housing, homes under construction, and uninhabited homes in Schedule 1.\n\nIf you're looking for Manitoba\n\nThe 1871 federal census does not include Manitoba. It was counted separately in 1870.\n\nStatistical summary\n\nCensus of Canada, 1870-71 = Recensement du Canada, 1870-71\n\nCensus of Canada, 1881\n\nThe 1881 Census was the second federal census. It began on April 4, 1881 and had 172 questions across eight schedules. Real estate and industrial establishments were combined into a single Schedule. Only Schedule 1 from this census has been preserved. The location for each household was only recorded on schedule 3. Since that schedule no longer exists, there is no way to know exactly where a family lived.\n\nLike 1871, the 1881 census also counted sea-going vessels, temporary housing, homes under construction, and uninhabited homes in Schedule 1.\n\nSome of the pages were out of order when they were microfilmed. For example, pages in a sub-district might appear in this sequence: 1, 2, 5, 6, 3, 4, etc.\n\nStatistical summary\n\nCensus of Canada, 1880-81 = Recensement du Canada, 1880-81\n\nCensus of Canada, 1891\n\nThe third national census for Canada began on April 6, 1891 and it contained a total of 216 questions across 9 schedules. Only Schedule 1, which includes names has survived. The location for each household was only recorded on Schedule 3. Since that schedule no longer exists, there is no way to know exactly where a family lived.\n\nLike the 1871 and 1881 Censuses, the 1891 Census counted sea-going vessels, temporary housing, homes under construction, and uninhabited homes in Schedule 1. Institutions were enumerated separately from homes, and appear together in a single block of responses (microfilm reel T-6427).\n\nUnlike previous censuses, the 1891 Census recorded:\n\nwhether someone was French-Canadian\n\nplace of birth of both mother and father\n\nwhether someone was an employer or an employee\n\nwhether they were unemployed in the week before the census\n\nSome of the pages were out of order when they were microfilmed. For example, pages in a sub-district might appear in this sequence: 1, 2, 5, 6, 3, 4, etc.\n\nStatistical summary\n\nCensus of Canada, 1890-91 = Recensement du Canada, 1890-91\n\nCensus of Canada, 1901\n\nThe forth national census was taken on March 31, 1901. It had 561 questions.\n\nThis census contained 11 schedules, with cultivated lands and products now being separated and an additional schedule for agricultural values being added. Only Schedules 1 and 2 have been preserved since they contain names and locations.\n\nSchedule 1 also contained four specialized forms to account for people who were temporarily absent, boarders and lodgers who were temporarily absent, cheese and butter products, and clay products. These special forms have not survived.\n\nThis Census was the first to collect more detailed information about month and date of birth, year of birth, as well as the year of immigration or naturalization. The 1901 Census also collected information about trades, including location of work and months of employment. And finally, this census collected information on mother tongue and whether someone could speak English or French.\n\nPlease note that this Census is unique in that it recorded race by colour: the letter \"w\" or “b” for white, \"r\" for red (Indigenous peoples), \"b\" or “n” for black (Black Canadians), \"y\" or “j” for yellow (individuals of Asian descent). Individuals of mixed heritage were designated by their relevant non-white race.\n\nRecords are incomplete with respect to the enumeration of Indigenous peoples. Some communities were enumerated in their respective sub-districts, while others were counted with a completely separate form. Those forms were microfilmed together on reels T-6554 and T-6555. They include some agencies in Quebec, Ontario, Saskatchewan, Alberta and British Columbia.\n\nSince it contains no names, Schedule 2 cannot be searched using Census Search.\n\nThis was the first enumeration of the Unorganized Territories of Keewatin, Athabaska, Franklin, Ungava, Mackenzie and Yukon. A special schedule was used with a limited number of questions, spread over 2 pages. For the Yukon, some of these additional forms still exist.\n\nIn New Brunswick, some pages for the sub-districts of Havelock, Kars and Brooks Ward (Saint John City) were damaged. In 1937, the information was recopied by the Dominion Bureau of Statistics. Since they no longer had blank 1901 forms, they used blank forms from the 1936 census.\n\nStatistical summary\n\nFourth Census of Canada, 1901\n\nCensus of Canada, 1911\n\nThe 1911 Census was the fifth national census. It began on June 11, 1911 and had 549 questions.\n\nThis census contained thirteen schedules. Information about disability and compensation was moved from Schedule 1 to Schedule 2. Schedule 3 contained information on houses, buildings, and fruit. Schedule 4 was now restricted to grains and Schedule 5 for other agricultural plant products. Churches and schools were now enumerated separately in Schedule 10, and a new Schedule (12) was added for dairy factories. Only Schedule 1 has been preserved. Different forms were used for the Northwest Territories.\n\nThe 1911 Census was very similar to the 1901 Census. It also collected detailed information about month and date of birth, year of birth, as well as the year of immigration or naturalization. Questions regarding employment were also expanded to account for both primary and additional employers/occupations. Finally, this was also the first census to ask questions about insurance coverage.\n\nFor questions relating to occupation, specific numerical codes were utilized. The first part of the code refers to one of the general main divisions of occupations or industries.\n\nFirst part of the code Main divisions of occupations or industries 0 Agriculture 1 Building trades 2 Domestic and personal service 3 Civil and municipal service 4 Fisheries and hunting 5 Forestry and lumbering 6 Manufacturers—mechanical and textiles 7 Manufacturers—food and clothing 8 Mining 9 Professional pursuits 10 Trade and merchandising 11 Transportation\n\nThe second part of the code refers to the class of worker. A special code was created for the third category, Civil and municipal government, to include military ranks.\n\nSecond part of the code Class of worker 0 Self-employed or owner of the business 1 Managers, assistant managers 2 Superintendents, assistant superintendents, supervisors 3 Foremen, bosses, gang bosses, paymasters, treasurers 4 Agents, brokers, commission men 5 Inspectors, weighers, graders 6 Employees, workers, operators, skilled workers 7 Clerks, companions, timekeepers 8 Apprentices, helpers, learners, assistants 9 Labourers, unskilled, messengers, teamsters\n\nFinally, the third part of the code refers to the trade.\n\nThird part of the code Trade 0 (not used) 1 Admirals, generals, surveyors, etc. 2 Captains, colonels, postmasters, teachers, deputies, assessors, sheriffs, librarians, assistants, chief clerks, supervisors, etc. 3 Lieutenants, police inspectors, paymasters, collectors, treasurers, auditors, marshals, etc. 4 Sergeants, corporals, bandsmen, quartermasters, etc. 5 Inspectors, scalers, gaugers, measurers, roundsmen, appraisers, keepers, etc. 6 Employees, operators, privates, marines, sailors, policemen, letter carriers, etc. 7 Bookkeepers, clerks, stenographers, secretaries, court stenographers, etc. 8 Helpers, assistants, attendants, etc. 9 Labourers, messengers, watchmen, etc.\n\nStatistical summary\n\nFifth Census of Canada, 1911\n\nCensus of Canada, 1921\n\nThe 1921 Census was the sixth national census. It was taken on June 1, 1921 and had a total of 565 questions.\n\nWhile the number of questions increased, information was consolidated into five schedules:\n\nSchedule 1, Population\n\nSchedule 2, Agriculture\n\nSchedule 3, Animals, animal products, fruits, etc., not on farms\n\nSchedule 4, Manufacturing, trading and business establishments\n\nSchedule 5, Blind and deaf-mutes\n\nOnly Schedule 1 has been preserved. Different forms were used for the Northwest Territories.\n\nWhen employees compiled the statistical summaries, some of them wrote numbers on the census pages. The numbers relate to the information already recorded. They do not give extra details about the person enumerated. For example, for column 15, Place of birth, the following codes were used on some pages:\n\n1 Canada\n\n2 United Kingdom\n\n4 United States\n\n5 Europe\n\n7 Asia\n\nAfter the 1911 census, the government used those population statistics to redraw the federal electoral district boundaries. The maps of the new electoral districts were published in an electoral atlas in 1915. They used those electoral districts to determine the census districts for the 1921 census. Between 1915 and 1921 there may have been minor changes to some boundaries: Electoral atlas of the Dominion of Canada: according to the Redistribution Act of 1914 and the Amending Act of 1915 (Mikan 204296).\n\nStatistical summary\n\nSixth Census of Canada, 1921\n\nCensus of Canada, 1931\n\nThe seventh national census was taken on June 1, 1931. Information was further condensed into four schedules:\n\nSchedule 1: Population\n\nSchedule 2: Agriculture\n\nSchedule 3: Institutions\n\nSchedule 4: Merchandising and service establishments\n\nOnly Schedule 1 was preserved and it had 40 questions. In the 1931 Census three different forms of the population scheduled were used:\n\nForm 1A for the Maritimes and Québec and Ontario\n\nForm 1B for the Western provinces\n\nForm 1 - N.W.T. for the Northwest Territories\n\nIn one instance a rather resourceful enumerator, used an accountant’s ledger book to record information.\n\nThe 1931 Census was the first to ask if the family owned a radio. Since this Census was taken during the Depression, there are also several questions related to unemployment, including periods of unemployment and causes.\n\nThe sub-district names or boundaries in 1931 are not the same as those for 1921, particularly for large cities.\n\nStatistical summary\n\nSeventh Census of Canada, 1931"
