        "text": "Provinces and territories are tagged as admin_level=4. If a province is divided into major regions (larger than regional municipalities), those regions are tagged as admin_level=5.\n\nOntario has two tiers of municipalities. The upper-tier municipalities and single-tier municipalities are tagged as admin admin_level=6, while the lower tier municipalities are tagged as admin admin_level=8.\n\nQuebec has Administrative Regions tagged as admin_level=5, which cover the entire province. Regional county municipalities (RCM or MRC) and Urban agglomerations, tagged as admin_level=6 do not cover the entire province. \"Geographic\" MRCs (MRCG) and Equivalent territories (TE) do cover the province when combined, but they are statistical tools and do not represent a real government and are therefore should not be included in OSM. Indian Reserves should be tagged with boundary=aboriginal_lands and can have any or no admin_level. Cities, towns, and other municipalities are tagged admin_level=8.\n\nBritish Columbia has regional districts tagged as admin_level=6, within which incorporated municipalities are single-tier and tagged as admin_level=8. Unincorporated places located outside of the municipalities are grouped into \"electoral areas\", governed directly by the regional district. Incorporated municipalities must be relations, and should have one node with the \"admin_centre\" role, indicating the location of the municipal hall, be it a city hall, town hall, village hall, or district office. Electoral areas, all of which must be relations as well, are also tagged as admin_level=8, but do not use the \"admin_centre\" role. Municipalities enclaved within a single electoral area must have their borders tagged as part of the surrounding electoral area, but with Role:inner.\n\nThe remaining provinces use single-tier municipalities, which are tagged at admin_level=6. This includes regional municipalities (like counties) and local municipalities (like cities, towns, and sometimes villages). In these provinces, incorporated towns or villages are not part of the surrounding county, so their border should be tagged as part of the surrounding county with Role:inner. Populated areas in regional municipalities that are named and somehow recognized, but not incorporated (like hamlets), are tagged as admin_level=8.\n\nCities themselves are divided into boroughs, quarters, and neighbourhoods at admin_level=8, admin_level=9, and admin_level=10 respectively. The exact definition of these terms varies between cities, and might not match the terms used by the city itself. For example, the areas that the City of Calgary refers to as \"neighbourhoods\" are tagged as suburbs.\n\nFor more information, see w:Administrative divisions of Canada.\n\nRural areas\n\nadmin_level=4 admin_level=5 admin_level=6 7 admin_level=8 unsorted Province or territory\n\nAdministrative regions\n\nplace=region Single-tier municipalities and upper-tier municipalities\n\n(place=county, municipality, city, district, town) N/A Lower-tier municipalities and unincorporated places\n\n(place=town, village, hamlet) Alberta N/A incorporated municipalities\n\n(city, town, village, summer village, municipal district, specialized municipality) N/A unincorporated places\n\n(hamlets, urban service areas) British Columbia N/A regional districts N/A incorporated municipalities (with admin_centre role used) and rural electoral areas (without admin_centre role) Manitoba N/A incorporated municipalities\n\n(rural municipalities, cities, towns, villages) N/A unincorporated places\n\n(hamlets, northern communities, settlements) New Brunswick counties incorporated municipalities\n\n(city, town, village, regional municipality) local service districts N/A unincorporated places historic parishes Newfoundland and Labrador Newfoundland, Labrador incorporated municipalities\n\n(cities, towns) N/A N/A Northwest Territories administrative regions municipalities\n\n(cities, towns, villages, hamlets, self-governing communities) N/A designated authorities Nova Scotia counties incorporated municipalities\n\n(regional municipalities, towns, county municipalities, district municipalities) N/A unincorporated places\n\n(villages, communities) Nunavut regions N/A N/A communities Ontario regions districts, upper-tier municipalities, single-tier municipalities N/A lower-tier municipalities\n\n(communities) Prince Edward Island counties incorporated municipalities\n\n(cities, towns, rural municipalities, resort municipalities) N/A unincorporated communities\n\nhistoric lots Quebec administrative regions regional county municipalities, urban agglomerations some reserves lower-tier municipalities\n\n(cities, towns, villages, townships) Saskatchewan N/A incorporated municipalities\n\n(cities, towns, villages, resort villages, rural municipalities, northern towns, northern villages, northern hamlets) N/A unincorporated places\n\n(hamlets) Yukon unincorporated divisions incorporated Municipalities (cities, towns) N/A hamlets, localities unincorporated places\n\nUrban areas\n\nThe word \"neighbourhood\" is used in different ways by different cities. Because of this, the areas that a city calls its neighbourhoods can be tagged as either suburbs, quarters, or neighbourhoods, depending on their size and how they fit into the city's zoning hierarchy.\n\nadmin_level=6 admin_level=7 admin_level=8 admin_level=9 admin_level=10 place=city place=town place=suburb place=quarter place=neighborhood AB Calgary neighbourhood Edmonton city district community neighbourhood BC city town centre neighbourhood MB Winnipeg neighbourhood cluster neighbourhood NL St. John's neighbourhood NS Halifax community subdivision or locality neighbourhood ON Hamilton community neighbourhood Ottawa district ward neighbourhood Toronto administrative district ward neighbourhood QC urban agglomerations\n\nplace=county municipalities\n\nplace=city\n\nplace=town arrondissement/borough\n\nplace=suburb\n\nFirst nations\n\nFirst nations reserves and self-governing areas are tagged with boundary=aboriginal_lands. If a first nation government controls more than one reserve, the boundaries of each reserve should be part of two relations both tagged with boundary=aboriginal_lands. One relation is for the individual reserve, and the other relation is for the nation as a whole. For example, Alexander First Nation controls multiple reserves, so this relation is for Alexander Indian Reserve #134, while this relation is for Alexander First Nation as a whole."
