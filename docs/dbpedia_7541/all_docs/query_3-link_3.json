For 2021 Census neighbourhood source data, visit the Neighbourhood Profiles Open Data page.\n\nThis map is intended to help you find your neighbourhood among the 158 Toronto neighbourhoods which currently exist. Enter your address or start typing a neighbourhood in the search box below to find your neighbourhood. Left-click the neighbourhood area to get a brief description. Scroll down to the bottom of this page to see a list of all neighbourhoods and their designations, including the Neighbourhood Improvement Area (NIA) designation. Click on the neighbourhood area to view the selected Neighbourhood Profile.\n\nNeighbourhood Profiles include detailed population data about the neighbourhood, including charts about age groups, income, poverty, ethnicity, languages and more. The neighbourhood profiles were developed to help government and community agencies with their local planning, by providing socio-economic data at a meaningful geographic area. More details about how neighbourhoods were created, updated, and their history can be found on the About Toronto Neighbourhoods page."
