Others — such as Celine Dion, who’s listed as one celebrity to call the Bridle Path her home on top real estate site Barry Cohen Homes — have been a bit more secretive about their exact location.\n\nAdvertisement 2\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nTHIS CONTENT IS RESERVED FOR SUBSCRIBERS\n\nEnjoy the latest local, national and international news.\n\nExclusive articles by Conrad Black, Barbara Kay and others.

As a result, a unique peek has been offered into the elaborate details that make up the rapper’s unique Toronto home.\n\nBelow, we take a look at the celebrities who have taken the time (and money) to enjoy the Bridle Path.\n\nRobert Herjavec (and Mick Jagger)\n\nSold most recently for $19,380,000, 16 High Point Rd. was owned by Shark Tank favourite and owner of global cybersecurity firm Herjavec Group, Robert Herjavec. The 10-bed, 10-garage estate features an indoor swimming pool as part of its 33,650 square-foot living space. The property has also acted as a concert venue for Michael Bublé, when Herjavec’s family hosted a fundraiser gala. In addition, it’s been rented to Rolling Stones frontman Mick Jagger, while he was on tour in Canada.\n\nPrince\n\nPrince’s former Toronto home on 61 the Bridle Path is currently listed at $16,910,000. The late Grammy award winning performer purchased the property after marrying Toronto-native Manuela Testolini in 2001. A bungalow with “a dramatic flow and a majestic ambiance for entertaining on a global level,” it holds around 14,280 square feet of living space on over two acres of land. The property even features a hair salon. Unfortunately for Prince, he didn’t get to keep the Toronto home after he and his wife finalized their divorce in 2007.\n\nWe apologize, but this video has failed to load.\n\nTry refreshing your browser, or\n\ntap here to see other videos from our team.\n\nAdvertisement 3\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\n68 Bridle Path\n\nWe apologize, but this video has failed to load.\n\nTry refreshing your browser, or\n\ntap here to see other videos from our team.\n\nAdvertisement 4\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nThis mansion warrants a subsection of its own, considering the group of celebrities who have occupied the 25,875 square-foot home over the years. The property, currently on sale for an undisclosed price, was listed on the market for $35,000,000 in 2017. In the past it’s hosted a party for Jane Fonda, with former prime minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau another famed guest. It’s been blessed by Toronto’s former archbishop, Cardinal Gerald Emmett Carter, and has served as the set for TV shows such as Suits, and movies such as It Takes Two, featuring Mary Kate and Ashley Olsen.\n\nDrake\n\nAfter buying the two-acre lot in 2015 for $6.7 million, Drake’s estate on 21 Park Lane Circle finally looks (close to) ready. The construction of the property, reported to span 35,000 square feet, features a basketball court in the basement to go along with other amenities such as a singing toilet.\n\nWe apologize, but this video has failed to load.\n\nTry refreshing your browser, or\n\ntap here to see other videos from our team.\n\nAdvertisement 5\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nTo make sure he has enough privacy when using the John, Drake also received an exception from a Toronto bylaw, so that he could build fences higher than the city limit of six-and-a-half feet.\n\nGordon Lightfoot\n\nIf Drake needs any advice on the Bridle Path, he can always ask Gordon Lightfoot. The Canadian singer and folk icon lives on 16 Park Lane Circle, according to a 2016 article by the Globe and Mail. It was then valued at $11.2 million, after he purchased the property in 1999 for $3.8 million, which features five bedrooms and five full bathrooms. Back then, Lightfoot was still known to write songs in a mahogany-lined room that overlooked his front lawn. Now, he’s looking forward to having Drake and his family among his neighbours.\n\n“I’m very proud of the fact that [Drake] would choose to move next door to me,” Lightfoot told the Canadian Press. “It’ll be good to have him drop by. I’ll go over to his house for breakfast. His mom might come over for coffee.”\n\n26 Park Lane Circle\n\nSitting on over six acres of land, the property located at 26 Park Lane Circle once fully belonged to National Post founder Conrad Black. In 2016, when it was estimated to have a value of $21.8 million, Black sold the mansion as part of a leaseback agreement that allowed him to continue to live on the property as a tenant. Over the years the Bridle Path mansion, now back on the market, has seen guests and visitors such as Elton John, Richard Nixon and Margaret Thatcher. With around 23,000 square feet of living space, there are eight bedrooms, 14 full baths, an indoor pool and even a two-storey library.\n\n11 High Point Rd.\n\nWe apologize, but this video has failed to load.\n\nTry refreshing your browser, or\n\ntap here to see other videos from our team.\n\nAdvertisement 6\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nIf you think 11 High Point Rd. is nice, you’re not alone. It was part of the movie Mean Girls, in which Regina George (played by Ontario’s own Rachel McAdams) brought Cady Heron (Lindsay Lohan) over to her home.\n\n“Wow, your house is really nice,” says Cady, to which Regina famously responds, “I know, right?”\n\nThe 1,858-square-metre mansion hit the market in 2015 for $14.8 million, and boasts 11 bedrooms and 12 bathrooms. Along with its Mean Girls credit, William Shatner has used its foyer to film a commercial, while Martha Stewart used the kitchen for a cooking segment.\n\nArticle content\n\nShare this article in your social network\n\nLatest from Shopping Essentials"
