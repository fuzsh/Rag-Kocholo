        "text": "Dufferin Grove – one of the coolest neighbourhoods you must visit as soon as possible. So says Time Out, as they awarded the number 39 spot to a neighbourhood some Torontonians may not have even heard of. So, we wanted to dive deeper into this story to find out what makes it so cool. And we weren’t disappointed.\n\nAfter looking through their entire list that was curated by local Time Out editors, there was definitely a trend in the types of neighbourhoods and cities listed – they were gritty, buzz-worthy, affordable and on the up and up. Cultural and culinary hotspots also helped. We did get a bit of wanderlust as we skimmed through the various neighbourhoods across the globe, but for now, let’s focus on our own backyard. Here’s what we love about Dufferin Grove and why its considered one of the coolest neighbourhoods in the world.\n\nWhere is Dufferin Grove in Toronto?\n\nDufferin Grove is gaining in notoriety among its fellow neighbourhoods such as Trinity-Bellwoods, West Queen West and The Junction, all on the West side of Toronto. The neighbourhood is bordered by Bloor Street West to the north, Ossington Ave to the east, College Street to the south, and Dufferin Street to the west.\n\nNamed after the neighbourhood, Dufferin Grove Park is a 5.3 hectare park on Dufferin Street just south of Bloor Street West with large, beautiful mature forest canopy, whose colors are brilliant at this time of year. The park features a multipurpose sports field, basketball court, picnic area, wading pool, children’s playground and reflexology footpath. The park is also home to the very popular Organic Farmer’s Market that takes place every Thursday all year from 3pm to 7pm.\n\nWhere to Eat and Drink in Dufferin Grove?\n\nThere are many great reasons Time Out paid attention to Dufferin Grove, and we have to believe the food and drink scene is right at the top of that list. There is no shortage of places to eat and drink in Dufferin Grove – especially drink. So before you start your bar-hopping-Saturday-night, stop at one of these spots to satisfy your cravings and build a good base, because you’ll need it. Trust.\n\nIf you’re looking for a more traditional spot to dine, make your booking at Enoteca Sociale on Dundas West. With an incredible wine list and a gnocchi dish that will have you ordering seconds, you won’t be disappointed with your decision to dine here. Another great spot that’s on nearly every must-eat list is SoSo Food Club – this new Chinese snack bar focuses on cusine from mainland China – order the lamb biang biang and the lobster in XO Sauce.\n\nWhen your belly is full but your thirst is still strong, a bar-hop in Dufferin Grove is the perfect casual weekend night. Some must-stops include: Burdock – a Bloordale brewery, Three Speed – a bar with a great selection of suds as well as craft cocktails (and one of the best patios in the city), Track & Field – where an indoor bocci ball court and shuffleboards await. And finally, Laylow Brewery – this two-year-old spot just happens to be Toronto’s smallest brewery, making delicious super-small-batch beers that are a must-try on any bar hopping evening.\n\nLiving in Dufferin Grove\n\nAs noted in the Time Out article, Dufferin Grove is one of the last affordable in terms of house prices, centrally located neighbourhoods in the city, and that it retains a touch of “small-town charm”. The neighbourhood is predominantly two or three-storey detached or semi-detached homes. The majority of Dufferin Grove houses were built between 1890 and 1930, and the homes in this area are larger than those found in most downtown Toronto neighbourhoods. The architectural style of the homes range from early and late Victorian to Edwardian and English Cottage style designs.\n\nLiving in Dufferin Grove is very popular for families buying a home, and those looking for a project-house to renovate. There are also two elementary public schools in the area – Ossington Old Orchard Public School and Dewson Street Junior Public School, making this a newly sought-after area for those starting a family yet want to be close to the Toronto’s Downtown Core."
