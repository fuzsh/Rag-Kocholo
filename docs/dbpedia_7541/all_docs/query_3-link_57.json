        "text": "133 Imperial Street - Ann MacIntosh Duff\n\nAnn MacIntosh Duff, an accomplished Canadian artist, has resided in the neighbourhood since 1954. Ann and her mother used to live on Cluny Drive in Rosedale until her father John MacIntosh Duff’s unexpected passing at an early age in 1952. The house on Cluny Drive was designed by the architect Douglas Kertland, a close family friend who is best known for his award winning design of the CNE automotive building. When the family decided to build a new home they selected Chaplin Estates, an area in ‘North Toronto’.\n\nThey purchased the only remaining lot on Imperial Street from family friends. It was a double lot and functioned as a rose garden at the time. They commissioned Douglas Kertland to design the house on Imperial Street and they wouldn’t have considered another architect since Doug and his wife Gladys were special family friends. In fact in the 1920’s Mr. Kertland designed many of the houses in the neighbourhood including almost every house on Imperial Street."
