        "text": "The Vibe\n\nKingsway South, more commonly known simply as The Kingsway, is Toronto’s Bridle Path of the west. It sits just past Bloor West Village with a notedly upscale tone that separates the two areas. While Bloor West Village is posh, it’s the formidable size and architecture of the Kingsway homes that separate the two. Despite its luxe appearance, it’s also a place to call home with a community of caring people and some down to earth events that keep it humble. Part of The Kingsway’s distinct character comes from its fab shops and restaurants and its kitschy original theatre that adds a touch of retro to its upscale vibe.\n\nThe Story\n\nBordering Mimico Creek on the west, Dundas Street West to the north, the Humber River on the east and Bloor Street to the south, the land of Kingsway South was originally owned by the Church of England. Known as Clergy Reserve lands, the properties were leased to farmers by the Church from the early 1800’s up until 1908. At this time, the land was purchased by the brainchild of the Kingsway area, Robert Home Smith.\n\nThe subdivision of the area was marketed in 1912 by Home Smith and Company, but the arrival of the second world war stalled development. Adding to the challenges, the area remained sequestered from the rest of Toronto due to the Humber River Valley. Once the Bloor Street bridge was built in 1924, transportation improved and sales of homes in the area finally resumed.\n\nAs with Toronto’s Bridle Path area, right from the get-go the area was slated for the affluent. As a result, it attracted a large amount of Northern Ontario mining executives in hand with some prominent Toronto businessmen. Many were personal acquaintances of Mr. Home Smith, adding a very elitist feel to the community. The area’s motto was \"a little bit of England far from England\" and was originally called Kingsway Park. The name reflected Mr. Home Smith’s vision to create an English style “garden suburb.” The large lawns, well-planned winding streets and treed lots made the idyllic backdrop for distinctly majestic homes. The homes are of the arts and crafts style, and the streets were purposefully named to add a regal flair to the neighbourhood. Mr. Home Smith also built the Old Mill Restaurant which still stands today.\n\nThe neighbourhood was dubbed Kingsway South in the 1950s when the area was split with the building of the interchange at Royal York and Dundas. The area to the north followed its own development path including several apartment buildings. The word “South” helps set the more affluent homes apart from the quite different feel of its neighbours to the north. As a result, today Kingsway South remains one of Toronto’s most ritzy, prominent neighbourhoods keeping in line with Home Smith’s vision.\n\nThe Convenience\n\nJust 4.9 kilometers from Toronto’s City Hall, Kingsway South is the epitome of convenience. The 73 Royal York and 48 Rathburn buses run north from the Royal York station and the 66 Prince Edward bus runs north and south from the Old Mill station. However, many residents are within walking distance of the two handy subway stations. It’s also just minutes to Lakeshore Boulevard and the QEW/Gardiner making the drive into the city a breeze.\n\nLocals have their own little strip of shopping and dining bliss along the main strip at Bloor West, but they can also find other hidden gems throughout the area. There’s a distinct upscale feel here, yet many very casual pubs and cafés also dot the area along Bloor near Royal York.\n\nThis is also an area known for its lush parkland with trails and parks along the nearby Humber River, not to mention The Martin Goodman Trail at Toronto’s waterfront. There’s always something to see and do, whether it’s swimming at Etobicoke Memorial Pool, skating at Central Arena or going for a walk or run at Home Smith Park on the Humber. Perhaps best of all is the historic Kingsway movie theatre where you can view films old and new in a retro cinema where drinks are spiked.\n\nThe Residents\n\nThose who snatched up a home in the area many decades ago, are making way for a group of up and coming young professionals. Although many seniors remain, young couples and families are chomping at the bit for a chance to buy a home here. Another factor bringing in the younger crowd is the development of new condos which offer a prominent address at a far more affordable price tag. The average income here is way above the rest of the city, hitting about $276,000. Most homeowners are also well-educated and married with kids.\n\nThe Best Part\n\nThe tranquil, winding streets, majestic homes and nearby shops and restaurants create a prestigious lifestyle sans the north Toronto snobbery.\n\nThe Worst Part\n\nBecause this is one of TO’s most desirable areas, not only does it take patience waiting for a listing to come up, but also a steady, above average income to put in an offer.\n\nThe Real Estate\n\nRobert Home Smith’s vision to create an elite neighbourhood that balances between the beauty and quiet of nature and the conveniences of the city makes Kingsway South one of the most sought-after areas in Toronto. The lovely, fairy tale homes sit like stately mini castles on shady, winding streets. They don’t build homes like this anymore with original stone and brick exteriors, and typical features of the late 1800s including wrought iron railings. The oldest selection of Victorian and Edwardian style homes are located on Government Road. The strict regulations Home Smith placed on the builders provided protection for the original mature trees that still line the streets and provide shade for the imposing lawns. The stunning maple and oak trees make the streets feel like lanes winding through a private forest sheltering the exclusive homes.\n\nThe Kingsway offers luxury homes close to the city, yet cloistered from the din thanks to the carefully preserved natural features. Average prices top $1.7 million, and the high desirability of the homes means new listings won’t last long. Despite the high price tag, homes tend to sell at asking, or above. While you can find more affordable homes in Kingsway condos, you’ll still pay a prettier price if you want to own property in this picture perfect neighbourhood."
