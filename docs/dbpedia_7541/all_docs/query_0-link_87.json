Presumably they are being J'ed and\n\nwill run combined from Toronto to Oshawa via the Bala and York\n\nSubdivisions and be separated in Oshawa, as in previous detours.\n\n62/52 are J'ed as usual. 60/50, 40, 44 are cancelled.\n\nWestward 41, 61, 47, 55 are cancelled on Sept 24-25, as is\n\n669 on Friday, Sept 23. Westward trains from Montreal and\n\nOttawa will not be J'ed, but there is a travel advisory warning\n\nof significant delays and no service to Guildwood Saturday and\n\nSunday.\n\nTom Box\n\ntbox at ncf dot ca\n\nPort Hope, ON, Canada\n\nI traveled both ways by the York Sub-Bala Sub detour between Ottawa and Toronto on December 2nd, on 51 and 54; not helped by 51 being delayed at Ottawa for 45 minutes due to an injury to the service manager and 54 stopped 30 minutes at Oshawa with some electrical problem. Interesting experience but the delays made for a very short day for me in Toronto and a late arrival home.\n\ntoggle quoted message Show quoted text\n\nOn Thu, Sep 1, 2022 at 10:59 AM Tom Box <tbox@...> wrote:\n\nA notice on Reservia says, \"Travel Advisory!

The next available date offered is Monday Sep 26,\n\n2022.\" It then shows you the Monday departures.\n\n> I assume that means whatever they are doing they are not\n\n> diverting trains up Bala and over York.\n\nFor last November's detour, VIA never did say in public\n\nstatements to passengers that they would be using the Bala\n\nand York Subs. But that's the only reasonable alternative\n\nto the Kingston Sub between Toronto and Pickering, and I\n\ncan report firsthand that that's the route used last\n\nNovember.\n\nTom Box\n\ntbox at ncf dot ca\n\nPort Hope, ON, Canada\n\nInteresting, it absolutely didn’t show yesterday when I looked, but seems to be today. Wonder if I had a date plugged in wrong when I was checking and didn’t notice.\n\nIn any event, This is good as my Saturday plan was to go shoot the diversions! Glad that still seems to be the plan!\n\nStephen\n\nI’m currently on board 643 heading down the York sub. We have 2 F40s top n tailing 4 LRCs.\n\nI noticed the combined 64/42 which we passed did not have a trailing locomotive. I thought last time they had locomotives on each end for the reverse move? I wonder if it just backed up for the initial part of the trip.\n\nNick\n\ntoggle quoted message Show quoted text\n\nOn Tue, Sep 20, 2022 at 8:38 AM Stephen Gardiner <sjgardiner@...> wrote:\n\nInteresting, it absolutely didn’t show yesterday when I looked, but seems to be today.
