Part of the answer to that question is in The Annex. Densely populated by students, this area is close to many of Toronto’s schools and is also a thriving neighbourhood for families and working people. Shopping on Bloor Street West has everything you need from groceries to gift shops and unique clothing stores. This area has many art galleries and is close to the Royal Ontario Museum for people looking for a cultural outing. Some of the houses in this part of town were built in the late 1800s, featuring an array of different architectural styles from Edwardian estates to modern apartment buildings.\n\nNeighbourhood Review\n\nHistory\n\nBefore the 1800s this area was undeveloped farmland. This changed as railway development helped Toronto, then the township of York, grow into a city. Today’s Annex was originally divided into two villages, Yorkville and Seaton Village. This changed in 1886 when a developer named Simeon Janes reimagined the subdivision and created the neighbourhood that was named The Annex. Before the 1900s, some of Toronto’s most successful families lived in this part of town. The Eatons, who founded Canada’s largest department store chain at the time, lived here, as did George Gooderham Sr., president of a successful distillery. Over time, these wealthy families migrated to more fashionable neighbourhoods north of Davenport, such as Forest Hill.\n\nArchitecture\n\nDue to its past occupancy by affluent families, The Annex has many mansions with Victorian- and Edwardian-style architecture. Wealthy property buyers from the 1800s commissioned architects to construct unique homes. One of the most prominent architects was E.J. Lennox. Lennox took his influence from the Queen Anne style and American Richardson Romanesque, creating a new style today known by some as the “Annex Style House.” Characteristics of Lennox’s designs include turrets, ornate window surrounds, large archways, and squat columns. There are several historic buildings on Bloor Street such as Trinity-St. Paul’s United Church and Centre for Faith, Justice and the Arts. Completed in 1889, the church is an example of Romanesque Revival architecture.\n\nThings to Do in The Annex\n\nArts & Culture\n\nOne historic cultural centre in The Annex is the Hot Docs Ted Rogers Cinema. This documentary-focused movie house near Bathurst Street first opened in 1913. The Annex is close to a few art galleries on Avenue Road, such as Peter Triantos Art Galleries, LUMAS Toronto, and Gallerie De Bellefeuille. If you’re interested in artistic production you might stop by the Tranzac Club on Brunswick Avenue, a non-profit, member-supported community organization with a focus on promoting theatre, music, and arts. All year-round tourists and residents alike flock to the Royal Ontario Museum to visit its collection of galleries and exhibitions from around the world.
