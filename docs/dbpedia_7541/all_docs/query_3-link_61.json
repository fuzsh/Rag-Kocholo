        "text": "Canada is divided into ten provinces and three territories. Each of these entities may have different types of subdivision, used for various purposes.\n\nStatistics Canada, the Canadian census organization, has created a Standard Geographical Classification (SGC). The SGC is a hierarchical set of regional divisions. Provinces and territories are top-level divisions, and have two-digit codes. On the second level are census divisions, also with two-digit codes. Census subdivisions, with three-digit codes, are on the third (lowest) level. To identify an area completely, the hierarchical codes are concatenated from left to right. For example, 35 09 021 represents the census subdivision of Perth, Ontario. The 35 identifies Ontario, the 09 identifies Lanark county, and the 021 specifies Perth.\n\nCensus divisions and subdivisions are subject to change every five years. In some cases, these changes simply reflect changes to the corresponding administrative divisions. In other cases, they may be made for the convenience of the census.\n\nCanada has an official database of place names called the Canadian Geographical Names Data Base (CGNDB). Each place in the CGNDB is located in a province or territory, and most of them are further localized by \"Location\". These \"Locations\" are province subdivisions.\n\nTo make sense of the subdivisions of provinces and territories, it is necessary to look at each province separately.\n\nAlberta\n\nAlberta has nineteen census divisions, numbered from 1 to 19. The SGC code for each division is the division number, left-filled with a zero if necessary to make two digits. Prefix 48 to get a four-digit code. In the CGNDB, Alberta's \"Locations\" are section, township, and range. Those are the survey units used when the province was first homesteaded and farmed. They form a coordinate system in which the smallest unit, a section, is one square mile. Alberta's area is over 250,000 square miles, so there could be a very large number of these geographic subdivisions.\n\nMaps: Census divisions and economic regions .\n\nBritish Columbia\n\nThe census divisions of British Columbia are called regional districts. They are incorporated, like the counties in the eastern provinces, and accordingly they are administrative divisions. The \"Locations\" used in the CGNDB are called land districts. They are not incorporated, but are considered geographic divisions. There are more land districts than regional districts. A few of the names are the same, but in general, the land districts are neither subsets nor supersets of the regional districts.\n\nNameHASCSGCCapital Alberni-ClayoquotCA.BC.AC23Port Alberni Bulkley-NechakoCA.BC.BN51Burns Lake CapitalCA.BC.CP17Victoria CaribooCA.BC.CR41Williams Lake Central CoastCA.BC.CC45Bella Coola Central KootenayCA.BC.CK03Nelson Central OkanaganCA.BC.CO35Kelowna Columbia-ShuswapCA.BC.CS39Salmon Arm Comox ValleyCA.BC.CM26Courtenay Cowichan ValleyCA.BC.CV19Duncan East KootenayCA.BC.EK01Cranbrook Fraser ValleyCA.BC.FV09Chilliwack Fraser-Fort GeorgeCA.BC.FF53Prince George Greater VancouverCA.BC.GV15Burnaby Kitimat-StikineCA.BC.KS49Terrace Kootenay BoundaryCA.BC.KB05Trail Mount WaddingtonCA.BC.MW43Port McNeill NanaimoCA.BC.NA21Nanaimo Northern RockiesCA.BC.FL59Fort Nelson North OkanaganCA.BC.NO37Coldstream Okanagan-SimilkameenCA.BC.OS07Penticton Peace RiverCA.BC.PC55Dawson Creek Powell RiverCA.BC.PW27Powell River Skeena-Queen CharlotteCA.BC.SQ47Prince Rupert Squamish-LillooetCA.BC.SL31Pemberton StikineCA.BC.ST57Victoria StrathconaCA.BC.SR24Campbell River Sunshine CoastCA.BC.SC29Sechelt Thompson-NicolaCA.BC.TN33Kamloops\n\nName: These are all regional\n\ndistricts, except for Stikine, which\n\nis a region.\n\nHASC: Hierarchical administrative\n\nsubdivision codes.\n\nSGC: Standard Geographical\n\nClassification division code.

The SGC code for each division is the division number, left-filled with a zero if necessary to make two digits. Prefix 46 to get a four-digit code. In the CGNDB, Manitoba's \"Locations\" are section, township, and range. Those are the survey units used when the province was first homesteaded and farmed. They form a coordinate system in which the smallest unit, a section, is one square mile. Manitoba's area is about 250,000 square miles, so there could be a very large number of these geographic subdivisions.\n\nMaps: Census divisions and economic regions .\n\nNew Brunswick\n\nNew Brunswick is divided into counties. The counties are subdivided into civil parishes. They are also census divisions, and are used by the CGNDB as \"Locations\". Some road maps or atlas maps show county lines.\n\nNameHASCSGCArea(Km.²)PopulationCapital AlbertCA.NB.AL061,76426,492Hopewell Cape CarletonCA.NB.CA113,36726,910Woodstock CharlotteCA.NB.CH023,21927,335Saint Andrews GloucesterCA.NB.GL154,80287,601Bathurst KentCA.NB.KE084,49132,094Richibucto KingsCA.NB.KI053,55964,724Hampton MadawaskaCA.NB.MA133,26936,814Edmundston NorthumberlandCA.NB.NO0912,09852,153Newcastle QueensCA.NB.QU043,55612,470Gagetown RestigoucheCA.NB.RE148,39738,701Dalhousie Saint JohnCA.NB.SJ011,58279,302Saint John SunburyCA.NB.SU032,79525,358Burton VictoriaCA.NB.VI125,37221,929Perth-Andover WestmorlandCA.NB.WE073,704120,531Dorchester YorkCA.NB.YO109,18285,719Fredericton\n\nHASC: Hierarchical administrative subdivision codes.\n\nSGC: Standard Geographical Classification division\n\ncode.

The SGC code for each division is the division number, left-filled with a zero if necessary to make two digits. Prefix 10 to get a four-digit code. In the CGNDB, Newfoundland and Labrador's \"Locations\" are (electoral) districts. There are some differences from the present-day electoral districts, leading me to suspect that CGNDB prepared the database at some time in the past, and didn't update for redistricting.\n\nMaps:Census divisions and economic regions .\n\nThis genealogical site offers a set of historical districts of Newfoundland. Genealogists have a need to identify places with respect to districts that don't vary from decade to decade. Apparently, no government-defined districts meet this need in Newfoundland.\n\nNorthwest Territories\n\nThe 1996 census, before the partition of Nunavut, showed Northwest Territories divided into five regions: Baffin, Fort Smith, Inuvik, Keewatin, and Kitikmeot. Baffin, Keewatin, and Kitikmeot correspond to the area that became Nunavut, so I've listed Fort Smith and Inuvik as the regions of NWT. The CGNDB, however, uses the districts of Franklin and Mackenzie as \"Locations\" within NWT. Inuvik apparently includes the northern part of Mackenzie and all of Franklin. The CGNDB may simply have failed to update to the new regions. Northwest Territories have six census divisions, numbered from 1 to 6. The four-digit SGC code for each division is the division number, prefixed with 610.\n\nNameHASCSGCArea(Km.²)PopulationCapital Fort SmithCA.NT.FS06610,45630,225Fort Smith InuvikCA.NT.IN07394,0159,024Inuvik\n\nHASC: Hierarchical administrative subdivision codes.\n\nSGC: Standard Geographical Classification division\n\ncode.

Manitoba province created, consisting of about the southern third of present-day Manitoba.\n\n1876: Part of Northwest Territories organized into Keewatin district.\n\n1880: United Kingdom transferred its claims to all North American arctic islands (approximately the district of Franklin) to Canada.\n\n1882-05-17: Parts of Northwest Territories organized into Alberta, Assiniboia, Athabaska, and Saskatchewan districts.\n\n1895-10-02: Remainder of Northwest Territories organized into Franklin, Mackenzie, Ungava, and Yukon districts. Athabaska district enlarged.\n\n1898-06-13: Yukon territory split from Northwest Territories.\n\n1905-09-01: Alberta and Saskatchewan provinces formed by taking all of Alberta, Assiniboia, Athabaska, and part of Saskatchewan district from Northwest Territories. Remainder of Saskatchewan district annexed to Manitoba province.\n\n1912: Ungava district annexed to Quebec province. Parts of Keewatin district annexed to Manitoba and Ontario provinces. Northwest Territories now comprised the districts of Franklin, Keewatin, and Mackenzie.\n\n~1973: Northwest Territories reorganized into five regions: Baffin, Fort Smith, Inuvik, Keewatin, and Kitikmeot. Mapmakers have continued to show the three districts. I've only seen one map showing the five regions, and it doesn't show the ocean borders. From the map, it appears that the old Keewatin district became Keewatin region plus parts of Baffin and Kitikmeot; Mackenzie became Fort Smith plus (part of?) Inuvik; and Franklin became most of Baffin, part of Kitikmeot, and possibly part of Inuvik.\n\n1999: Baffin, Keewatin, and Kitikmeot regions split from Northwest Territories to form Nunavut. There may have been small changes in the boundaries of these regions.\n\nMaps: Census divisions ; populated places .\n\nNova Scotia\n\nNova Scotia is divided into counties. They are also census divisions, and are used by the CGNDB as \"Geo Locations\". Some road maps or atlas maps show county lines.\n\nNameHASCSGCArea(Km.²)PopulationCounty seat AnnapolisCA.NS.AP053,32822,324Annapolis Royal AntigonishCA.NS.AG141,40119,554Antigonish Cape BretonCA.NS.CB172,517117,849Sydney ColchesterCA.NS.CO103,75849,262Truro CumberlandCA.NS.CU114,35933,804Amherst DigbyCA.NS.DI032,51220,500Digby GuysboroughCA.NS.GU134,17210,917Guysborough HalifaxCA.NS.HL095,343342,966Halifax HantsCA.NS.HN083,18339,483Windsor InvernessCA.NS.IN153,64920,918Port Hood KingsCA.NS.KI072,18159,193Kentville LunenburgCA.NS.LU063,02847,561Lunenburg PictouCA.NS.PI122,91148,718Pictou QueensCA.NS.QU042,54612,417Liverpool RichmondCA.NS.RI161,26711,022Arichat ShelburneCA.NS.SH012,53617,002Shelburne VictoriaCA.NS.VI182,8628,482Baddeck YarmouthCA.NS.YA022,17027,310Yarmouth\n\nHASC: Hierarchical administrative subdivision codes.\n\nSGC: Standard Geographical Classification division\n\ncode.

Morris Fisher points out that Nunavut is now divided into six planning regions. I don't normally count planning regions as administrative subdivisions: they're too easily changed. If there is evidence that the planning regions are getting elected governing bodies, I will reconsider this ruling.\n\nNameInuktitutHASCSGCArea(Km.²)PopulationCapital BaffinQikiqtaalukCA.NU.QK041,017,88913,218Iqaluit KeewatinKivalliqCA.NU.KV05592,3356,868Rankin Inlet KitikmeotKitikmeotCA.NU.KT08631,6955,067Cambridge Bay\n\nInuktitut: Region name in Inuktitut, the language of the Inuit.\n\nHASC: Hierarchical administrative subdivision codes.\n\nSGC: Standard Geographical Classification division\n\ncode.

Baffin region is about the same as North Baffin, South Baffin, and part of Akunniq. Keewatin approximately matches the new Keewatin and Sanikiluaq planning regions. Kitikmeot corresponds to West Kitikmeot and the larger part of Akunniq. (The map of the new planning regions is very rough, so there may be more overlaps than mentioned here.)\n\nMaps: Regions ; regions ; a private site has several maps in different styles.\n\nDead links: http://www.hrdc-drhc.gc.ca/dept/regions/ntcurmap.shtml, http://www.tunngavik.com/site-eng/nlca/articl3.htm, http://www.tunngavik.com/site-eng/nlca/image7.gif, http://npc.nunavut.ca/eng/nunavut/boundary.html, http://npc.nunavut.ca/eng/regions/index.html.\n\nOntario\n\nThe census divisions of Ontario are counties, districts, district municipalities, metropolitan municipalities, regional municipalities, and united counties; on the next level are boroughs, cities, municipalities, municipal townships, separate towns, towns, and villages. Some road maps or atlas maps show county lines.\n\nThe united counties may cause some confusion. Haldimand-Norfolk is an example. In 1850, Haldimand county was split from Norfolk county. In 1974, Haldimand and Norfolk counties merged to form Haldimand-Norfolk regional municipality. On January 1, 2001, the latter was split once again into Haldimand and Norfolk counties, approximately along the original county line. Other cases include Niagara county, which formerly consisted of Lincoln and Welland counties; Prescott and Russell united counties, Leeds and Grenville united counties, and Stormont, Dundas and Glengarry united counties. The original counties that were amalgamated to form these units of government still manifest themselves in many ways.\n\nThe CGNDB appears to use counties and districts as they stood in 1950. Toronto is shown as part of York, Lincoln and Welland are shown separately, and so on (see Change history below). However, the CGNDB uses the components of united counties: for example, some places in Leeds and Grenville county are listed under Leeds, and others under Grenville.\n\nNameHASCSGCTypeArea(Km.²)PopulationCounty seat AlgomaCA.ON.AL57d50,039127,269Sault Sainte Marie BrantCA.ON.BN29c1,090110,806Brantford BruceCA.ON.BC41c4,27465,268Paisley CochraneCA.ON.CO56d135,29493,917Cochrane DufferinCA.ON.DF22c1,44339,897Orangeville DurhamCA.ON.DR18rm3,838409,070Whitby ElginCA.ON.EL34c1,86575,423Saint Thomas EssexCA.ON.ES37c1,831327,365Windsor FrontenacCA.ON.FR10c4,141129,089Kingston GreyCA.ON.GR42c4,42484,071Owen Sound HaldimandCA.ON.HD28c2,88098,707Cayuga HaliburtonCA.ON.HB46c3,84914,421Minden HaltonCA.ON.HT24rm940313,136Milton Hamilton-WentworthCA.ON.HW25rm1,186451,665Hamilton HastingsCA.ON.HS12c6,017116,434Belleville HuronCA.ON.HU40c3,35459,065Goderich KenoraCA.ON.KR60d396,84058,748Kenora KentCA.ON.KT36c2,378109,943Chatham LambtonCA.ON.LM38c2,911128,943Sarnia LanarkCA.ON.LN09c2,94754,803Perth Leeds and GrenvilleCA.ON.LG07uc3,39090,235Brockville Lennox and AddingtonCA.ON.LA11c3,03037,243Napanee ManitoulinCA.ON.MA51d4,11311,192Gore Bay MiddlesexCA.ON.MI39c3,212372,274London MuskokaCA.ON.MU44dm4,10548,005Bracebridge NiagaraCA.ON.NG26rm1,862393,936Saint Catherines NipissingCA.ON.NP48d19,58084,723North Bay NorfolkCA.ON.NF28c(see Haldimand)Simcoe NorthumberlandCA.ON.NU14c1,90178,224Cobourg Ottawa-CarletonCA.ON.OC06rm2,453678,147Ottawa OxfordCA.ON.OX32c1,98192,888Woodstock Parry SoundCA.ON.PS49d11,23038,423Parry Sound PeelCA.ON.PL21rm1,215732,798Brampton PerthCA.ON.PT31c2,17669,976Stratford PeterboroughCA.ON.PB15c3,665119,992Peterborough Prescott and RussellCA.ON.PR02uc2,00367,183L'Orignal Prince EdwardCA.ON.PE13c1,01023,763Picton Rainy RiverCA.ON.RR59d18,84522,997Fort Frances RenfrewCA.ON.RE47c7,79391,685Pembroke SimcoeCA.ON.SC43c4,307288,684Barrie Stormont, Dundas and GlengarryCA.ON.SD01uc3,302107,841Cornwall SudburyCA.ON.SB52d46,77026,178Sudbury SudburyCA.ON.SU53rm2,598161,210Sudbury Thunder BayCA.ON.TB58d135,900158,810Thunder Bay TimiskamingCA.ON.TI54d15,27138,983Haileybury TorontoCA.ON.TO20mm6272,275,771Toronto VictoriaCA.ON.VI16c3,49163,332Lindsay WaterlooCA.ON.WT30rm1,336377,762Kitchener WellingtonCA.ON.WL23c2,639159,609Guelph YorkCA.ON.YO19rm2,284504,981Newmarket\n\nHASC: Hierarchical administrative subdivision codes.\n\nSGC: Standard Geographical Classification division code.

There have been quite a few changes to the counties over the years, right up to the present.\n\nNameHASCSGCArea(Km.²)Population AbitibiCA.QC.AB888,00325,334 Abitibi-OuestCA.QC.AO873,36724,109 ActonCA.QC.AC4857814,613 Antoine-LabelleCA.QC.AL7914,90632,019 ArgenteuilCA.QC.AG761,25527,232 ArthabaskaCA.QC.AT391,89660,257 AsbestosCA.QC.AS4077215,381 AvignonCA.QC.AV063,64515,494 Beauce-SartiganCA.QC.BS291,93944,218 Beauharnois-SalaberryCA.QC.BH7046259,785 BécancourCA.QC.BC381,13619,175 BellechasseCA.QC.BL191,62929,475 BonaventureCA.QC.BO054,39319,848 Brome-MissisquoiCA.QC.BM461,54845,257 ChamplainCA.QC.CP58163312,734 CharlevoixCA.QC.CV163,75713,547 Charlevoix-EstCA.QC.CE152,37517,413 CoaticookCA.QC.CT441,16215,758 Communauté-Urbaine-de-l'OutaouaisCA.QC.OU81470201,536 Communauté-Urbaine-de-MontréalCA.QC.MR664941,775,871 Communauté-Urbaine-de-QuébecCA.QC.QU23543490,271 D'AutrayCA.QC.DA521,18835,727 Denis-RiverinCA.QC.DR045,15614,019 DesjardinsCA.QC.DE2425449,076 Deux-MontagnesCA.QC.DM7224171,218 DrummondCA.QC.DU491,62779,654 FranchevilleCA.QC.FR371,128137,458 JolietteCA.QC.JO6132148,303 KamouraskaCA.QC.KA141,92923,268 La Côte-de-BeaupréCA.QC.CB214,98521,214 La Côte-de-GaspéCA.QC.CG034,14320,903 Lac-Saint-Jean-EstCA.QC.LS932,73351,963 La Haute-Côte-NordCA.QC.HC9513,31613,541 La Haute-YamaskaCA.QC.HY4775573,351 La Jacques-CartierCA.QC.JC223,18023,282 LajemmeraisCA.QC.LJ5941485,720 La MatapédiaCA.QC.MP075,38820,930 L'AmianteCA.QC.AM311,90545,851 La MitisCA.QC.MI092,29420,157 La Nouvelle-BeauceCA.QC.NB2679324,362 La Rivière-du-NordCA.QC.RD7545573,896 L'AssomptionCA.QC.AN6025391,537 LavalCA.QC.LV65245314,398 La Vallée-de-la-GatineauCA.QC.VG8312,62218,706 La Vallée-du-RichelieuCA.QC.VR57555105,032 Le Bas-RichelieuCA.QC.BR5359353,909 Le Centre-de-la-MauricieCA.QC.CM361,29167,379 Le Domaine-du-RoyCA.QC.DD9118,65333,239 Le Fjord-du-SaguenayCA.QC.FS9445,503172,793 Le GranitCA.QC.GR302,73320,993 Le Haut-RichelieuCA.QC.HR5693092,889 Le Haut-Saint-FrançoisCA.QC.HF412,35920,769 Le Haut-Saint-LaurentCA.QC.HL691,17021,864 Le Haut-Saint-MauriceCA.QC.HM9028,02616,272 L'ÉrableCA.QC.ER321,29124,680 Les BasquesCA.QC.BA111,23210,325 Les Chutes-de-la-ChaudièreCA.QC.CC2541967,479 Les Collines-de-l'OutaouaisCA.QC.CO821,93828,894 Les EtcheminsCA.QC.ET281,80618,668 Les Îles-de-la-MadeleineCA.QC.IM0120213,991 Les Jardins-de-NapiervilleCA.QC.JN6879721,977 Les LaurentidesCA.QC.LL782,45531,580 Les MaskoutainsCA.QC.MK541,29276,828 Les MoulinsCA.QC.MU6426491,156 Les Pays-d'en-HautCA.QC.PH7773923,088 Le Val-Saint-FrançoisCA.QC.VF421,39732,304 L'Île-d'OrléansCA.QC.IO201956,938 L'IsletCA.QC.IS172,09219,938 LotbinièreCA.QC.LO331,64726,633 ManicouaganCA.QC.MN9631,78036,108 Maria-ChapdelaineCA.QC.MC9238,67428,164 MaskinongéCA.QC.MS512,00223,802 MataneCA.QC.MT083,31224,334 MatawinieCA.QC.MW6210,74035,253 MékinacCA.QC.ME355,54413,629 MemphrémagogCA.QC.MG451,28135,984 Minganie - Basse-Côte-NordCA.QC.MB98100,13212,845 MirabelCA.QC.ML7449217,971 MontcalmCA.QC.MO6372032,872 MontmagnyCA.QC.MM181,67823,667 Nicolet-YamaskaCA.QC.NY501,00123,897 Nord-du-QuébecCA.QC.NQ99741,90736,310 PabokCA.QC.PB023,07521,713 PapineauCA.QC.PP802,94719,526 PontiacCA.QC.PN8415,59715,111 PortneufCA.QC.PR343,92443,179 Rimouski-NeigetteCA.QC.RM102,57551,290 Rivière-du-LoupCA.QC.RL121,26931,485 Robert-ClicheCA.QC.RC2781918,586 RoussillonCA.QC.RS67422118,355 RouvilleCA.QC.RV5554031,370 Rouyn-NorandaCA.QC.RN865,99942,033 Sept-Rivières - CaniapiscauCA.QC.SR9790,51440,730 SherbrookeCA.QC.SH43422127,224 TémiscamingueCA.QC.TM8518,94917,381 TémiscouataCA.QC.TT133,87423,348 Thérèse-De BlainvilleCA.QC.TB73204104,693 Vallée-de-l'OrCA.QC.VO8927,16543,121 Vaudreuil-SoulangesCA.QC.VS7185284,503\n\nHASC: Hierarchical administrative subdivision codes.\n\nSGC: Standard Geographical Classification division\n\ncode. Prefix 24 to get a four-digit code.\n\nPopulation: 1991 census.\n\nMaps: County outline map .\n\nSaskatchewan\n\nSaskatchewan has eighteen census divisions, numbered from 1 to 18. The SGC code for each division is the division number, left-filled with a zero if necessary to make two digits. Prefix 47 to get a four-digit code. The divisions have changed very little since 1941. In the CGNDB, Saskatchewan's \"Locations\" are section, township, and range. Those are the survey units used when the province was first homesteaded and farmed. They form a coordinate system in which the smallest unit, a section, is one square mile. Saskatchewan's area is about 250,000 square miles, so there could be a very large number of these geographic subdivisions.\n\nMaps: Census divisions and economic regions .\n\nYukon"
