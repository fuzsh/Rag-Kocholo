        "text": "1856 Dennis: Plan of the Subdivision of Lots 14 & 15 Wellington Place and 5 Ontario Terrace of Section A in the Original Survey of the Garrison Reserve at Toronto [Draper St.]\n\nThe following plan by J. Stoughton Dennis shows his original survey laying out what would become Draper Street, as registered by landowners William George Draper (son of the Hon. William Henry Draper) and Charles Jones.\n\nDeveloped in several phases from 1881 to 1889, the intimate Second Empire-styled row cottages which line Draper Street were all designated as heritage properties by the City of Toronto in the 1990s. Of note is the relatively narrow width of the street—32 feet (just a little under half a surveyor’s chain).\n\nAn overview of the development of Draper Street may be found here (PDF; see p.6).\n\nClick the map to view a full size version.\n\nPlan of the Subdivision of Lots 14 & 15 Wellington Place and 5 Ontario Terrace of Section A in the Original Survey of the Garrison Reserve at Toronto. July 15, 1856.\n\nCertified correct from Survey: J. Stoughton Dennis, P.L.S.\n\n[Signatures] W[illiam] Geo[rge] Draper, Owner of lot no. five; Charles Jones owner of Lots fourteen and fifteen\n\nCourtesy Ministry of Government Services, Toronto Land Registry Office: R.P. 171\n\nWinearls, MUC no.
