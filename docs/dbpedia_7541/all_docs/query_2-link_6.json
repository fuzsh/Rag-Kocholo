        "text": "North York, former city (1979–98), southeastern Ontario, Canada. In 1998 it amalgamated with the cities of Toronto, Scarborough, York, and Etobicoke and the borough of East York to become the City of Toronto. North York Township (created in 1922 from York Township) was constituted as a borough in 1967 and became a city in 1979. Following World War II there was planned industrial and residential development. North York has more than 4,000 acres (1,620 hectares) of parks and open space, and the campus of York University (1959) covers 475 acres (192 hectares). The Black Creek Pioneer Village depicts the early settlers’ way of life."
