In 1998 it amalgamated with the cities of Toronto, Etobicoke, Scarborough, and North York and the borough of East York to form the City of Toronto. York was established as a borough in 1967, through the amalgamation of the township of York and the town of Weston (incorporated 1881). It was incorporated as a city in 1983. The original York Township was formed in 1793, and it was once called Dublin."
