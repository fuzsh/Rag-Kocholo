This 150-acre development by Redwood Properties will be a modern urban village featuring a variety of residential dwellings ranging in height from over 15-storeys to under 5-storey\n\nRead More\n\nBefore Spending Time on Your Property Search, Our Investment Presentation Seminar Is a Must, and It’s Available Twice a Week.\n\nWe’ll help you find the perfect master-planned community\n\nMaster-Planned communities usually involve condominiums or townhomes, integrated retail and office space, pedestrian paths and public greenspace. Sometimes they even involve integrated public transit, as seen in east Toronto’s Canary District, which has a brand-new streetcar line running through the community.\n\nThey can be as expansive as the 100-acre SmartCentres, slated to add 17-million-square-feet of residential and commercial space to the Vaughan Metropolitan Centre, or cozy and modern like downtown Toronto’s 7-acre Garrison Point project, which involves two towers, upscale retail and a public park. The Daniels Erin Mills community in Mississauga even has its own farmer’s market.\n\nEither way, many people consider these kinds of communities to be the way of the future for housing in the GTA. As the city grows, many residents are looking for a more walkable, livable lifestyle where their time can be spent enjoying life in a lively and convenient setting. Gone are the days when it was considered normal to hop in the car and drive twenty minutes just to get your groceries or meet friends for a lunch date. Today’s modern homeowners want access to an array of lifestyle amenities and they want them at their fingertips. That’s where master-planned communities come in.\n\nAnticipating the growing number of families who are choosing to raise their children in more urban districts, many of these projects come with well-planned, family-friendly aspects too. Islington Terrace, for example, a community under construction in the heart of Etobicoke, comes with an expansive shared podium that features both outdoor and indoor play spaces for kids, including a splash pad and playground facilities.\n\nIn these kinds of communities, it’s typical to see colleagues meeting for coffee at street-level cafes that occupy the first floor of condominium buildings, neighbours walking dogs or playing impromptu soccer games in a central green space, or residents enjoying modern amenities like rooftop pools, barbeque dinners on the terrace or state-of-the-art gyms.\n\nThere are so many exciting master-planned projects coming to the GTA! Whether you want to be part of a distinctly urban enclave in downtown Toronto, or a network of homes that backs onto lush ravine land in Markham, we’ll help you find the perfect master-planned community."
