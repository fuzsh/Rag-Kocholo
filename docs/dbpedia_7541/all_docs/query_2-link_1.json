        "text": "Regional municipality in Ontario, Canada\n\nThe Regional Municipality of York, also called York Region, is a regional municipality in Southern Ontario, Canada, between Lake Simcoe and Toronto. The region was established after the passing of then Bill 102, An Act to Establish The Regional Municipality of York, in 1970. It replaced the former York County in 1971, and is part of the Greater Toronto Area and the inner ring of the Golden Horseshoe. The regional government is headquartered in Newmarket.\n\nAs of the 2021 census, York Region's population was 1,173,334, with a growth rate of 5.7% from 2016.[2] The Government of Ontario expects its population to surpass 1.5 million residents by 2031.[3] The three largest cities in York Region are Markham, Vaughan and Richmond Hill.[4]\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nAt a meeting in Richmond Hill on May 6, 1970, officials representing the municipalities of York County approved plans for the creation of a regional government entity to replace York County.[5] The plan had been presented in 1969 by Darcy McKeough, the Ontario Minister of Municipal Affairs, taking about a year to determine municipal boundaries within the new regional government.[5]\n\nThe Regional Municipality of York was created by Act of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario in 1970 (Bill 102 An Act to Establish The Regional Municipality of York), which took effect on January 1, 1971.[6] The creation of the regional municipality resulted in the consolidation of the fourteen former municipalities of York County into nine new municipalities:[7]\n\nCreation of area municipalities in the Regional Municipality of York (1971)[8] Area municipality Created from Police villages dissolved Town of Aurora Town of Aurora, annexing portions of the Townships of King and Whitchurch Town of East Gwillimbury Portion of the Township of East Gwillimbury\n\nHolland Landing\n\nMount Albert\n\nQueensville\n\nSharon\n\nTown of Georgina Townships of Georgina and North Gwillimbury, and the Village of Sutton Township of King Portion of the Township of King\n\nKing City\n\nNobleton\n\nSchomberg\n\nCity of Markham Town of Markham, annexing portion of the Township of Markham\n\nThornhill (part)\n\nUnionville\n\nTown of Newmarket Town of Newmarket, annexing portions of the Townships of East Gwillimbury, King and Whitchurch City of Richmond Hill City of Richmond Hill, annexing portions of the Townships of King, Markham, Vaughan and Whitchurch City of Vaughan Village of Woodbridge, annexing portions of the Townships of King and Vaughan\n\nMaple\n\nThornhill (part)\n\nTown of Whitchurch–Stouffville Village of Stouffville, annexing portions of the Townships of Markham (four lots south of Main Street) and Whitchurch\n\nThe township of Whitchurch merged with the town of Stouffville to create the town of Whitchurch–Stouffville, ceding land to Aurora, Newmarket, and Richmond Hill to the west of the proposed Highway 404 and annexing a northern strip of land from the township of Markham.[9] The western boundary of the new town of Markham was defined to be at Yonge Street, where its northern boundary was formed with Richmond Hill (to which it ceded land[5]) and its western boundary with the new town Vaughan.[9] The new town of Vaughan would consist of all communities in the area bounded by Markham and Richmond Hill in the east, Metro Toronto in the south, the periphery of the regional municipality in the west, and the new township of King in the north.[9]\n\nThe townships of Georgina, North Gwillimbury, and Sutton were merged into the township of Georgina, and the East Gwillimbury neighbourhood of East Gwillimbury Heights was merged into Newmarket.[9] King formed the northwestern part of the new region, but the eastern lot from Bathurst Street to Yonge Street was ceded to Newmarket, Aurora, and Oak Ridges, the last of which became a part of Richmond Hill.[9] The boundary between Aurora and Newmarket was defined to be St. John's Sideroad, and Newmarket's northern boundary was defined to be Green Lane.[9]\n\nThe towns of Aurora, Newmarket, and Richmond Hill were defined to be the growth centres for the regional municipality, which was to become a greenbelt between the denser urban areas of Toronto to the south and Barrie to the north.[7] The growth centres were each restricted to grow to a maximum population of 25,000 by 2000,[7] and the regional municipality to 300,000.[9]\n\nThe municipal realignment merged 40% of East Gwillimbury's population into Newmarket.[10] The council of East Gwillimbury voted to amalgamate with Newmarket, but Newmarket council opposed the amalgamation.[10] In the plan presented by McKeough, the councils of the towns of Newmarket and Aurora were given ten years to decide whether or not to amalgamate.[7]\n\nThe internal municipal realignments resulted in some politicians residing in a new municipality from that which they represented at the time of realignment.[5] The reeve of Whitchurch Township resided in the western portion of the town that was annexed by Aurora, three East Gwillimbury councillors resided in land annexed by Newmarket, including its future mayor Ray Twinney, and King councillor Gordon Rowe was a resident of Oak Ridges, which became part of Richmond Hill.[5]\n\nHydro Commissions\n\n[edit]\n\nBecause of the mix of urban and rural areas in the Region, the provision of electricity was governed in a different manner from the rest of the regional services:[11]\n\nthe hydro-electric commissions and public utilities commissions that existed at the end of 1970 continued to provide electricity within their respective areas;\n\nthe councillors of the former Township of Vaughan and the trustees of the former Police Village of King City became members of new Hydro-Electric Commissions for their respective areas;\n\nOntario Hydro continued to have responsibility for providing electricity to those portions of the Region that were not served by any of the above commissions.\n\nElectric distribution was partially rationalized in 1978,[12] when:\n\nhydro-electric commissions were established for all area municipalities except East Gwillimbury[13] (but it could establish a commission later on, subject to Ontario Hydro's consent);[14]\n\neffective January 1, 1979, all assets of the former commissions in the Region were transferred to the new commissions;[15]\n\nOntario Hydro withdrew its provision of services from all areas except those in East Gwillimbury, Georgina, King and Whitchurch-Stouffville;[15]\n\nGeorgina, King and Whitchurch-Stouffville could take over responsibility for such areas at a later date, subject to Ontario Hydro's consent[15]\n\nPolice\n\n[edit]\n\nThe York Regional Police was also created at this time, amalgamating the fourteen town, township, and village police services.[5]\n\nGeography\n\n[edit]\n\nYork Region covers 1,762 square kilometres from Lake Simcoe in the north to the city of Toronto in the south. Its eastern border is shared with Durham Region, to the west is Peel Region, and Simcoe County is to the northwest. A detailed map of the region[16] showing its major roads, communities and points of interest is available.\n\nTowns and cities in York Region include:\n\nTown of Aurora\n\nTown of East Gwillimbury\n\nTown of Georgina\n\nTownship of King\n\nCity of Markham\n\nTown of Newmarket\n\nCity of Richmond Hill\n\nCity of Vaughan\n\nTown of Whitchurch–Stouffville\n\nThere is also one First Nation with an Indian reserve, where the Chippewas of Georgina Island First Nation reside on Georgina Island, Fox Island and Snake Island.\n\nYork Region's landscape includes farmlands, wetlands and kettle lakes, the Oak Ridges Moraine and over 2,070 hectares of regional forest, in addition to the built-up areas of its municipalities. The highest point in the region is within the rolling hills of the moraine near Dufferin St. & Aurora Side Road at 360m ASL (1,243 feet)[17]\n\nClimate\n\n[edit]\n\nYork Region is situated in the humid continental climate (Köppen Dfb) zone with warm summers and cold winters, ample snowfall, more in the northern part of York region much of it derived from the wind driven snowbelt streamer activity.\n\nGovernment\n\n[edit]\n\nThe region is governed by York Regional Council, which consists of 20 elected representatives from each of the constituent towns and cities in the region. These include each of the nine mayors, and 11 regional councillors who are elected from the constituent municipalities as follows:[22]\n\n1 from Georgina\n\n1 from Newmarket\n\n2 from Richmond Hill\n\n3 from Vaughan\n\n4 from Markham\n\nThe regional councilors are elected at-large for each lower-tier municipality which has them. They are also voting members of their respective city/town council.\n\nThe leader of Council is referred to as \"Regional Chair and CEO\". Wayne Emmerson, a former mayor of Whitchurch-Stouffville, was elected to this office in December 2014.[1]\n\nIn October 2008, York Regional Municipality was named one of Greater Toronto's Top Employers by Mediacorp Canada Inc.[23]\n\nFederal and provincial representation\n\n[edit]\n\nStarting with the 2015 federal election, York Region encompasses all or part of the federal electoral districts of Aurora—Oak Ridges—Richmond Hill, King—Vaughan, Markham—Stouffville, Markham—Thornhill, Markham—Unionville, Newmarket—Aurora, Richmond Hill, Thornhill, Vaughan—Woodbridge, and York—Simcoe.\n\nProvincially, York Region is represented in the Legislative Assembly of Ontario by Members of Provincial Parliament. As of 2018, the provincial electoral districts are the same as the federal districts in most of Ontario.\n\nProposed reformations\n\n[edit]\n\nIn May 2023, Premier Doug Ford announced that he would look to dissolve and restructure existing regional municipalities where deemed prudent. In response, Markham mayor Frank Scarpitti publicly proposed amalgamating York Region into a single-tier municipality, claiming it would save millions of dollars.[24] The idea was met with immediate disapproval from all other York Region mayors, excluding Vaughan Mayor Steven Del Duca, who had not publicly expressed an opinion at the time. Scarpitti was criticized for not consulting with the other mayors about his proposal before publicly announcing it, which the others mayors saw as dramatic.[25] Ford later announced that he had no interest in Scarpitti's proposal to amalgamate, and that any future proposals which were to be seriously considered must be deliberated among all of the other mayors in a region before being made public.[26]\n\nLater, Vaughan mayor Steven Del Duca proposed dissolving York Region and making all of its lower-tier municipalities independent, claiming that Vaughan contributed more tax dollars than it received in regional funding.[27][28] No other politicians endorsed Del Duca's proposal. The mayors and councilors of York Region have generally agreed with looking into potential reforms to streamline government operations.[29][28] However, the mayors of the smaller towns, such as Newmarket and Whitchurch-Stouffville, strongly urged for dialogue and diplomacy, stressing that no municipality should be left behind as a result of a restructuring.[28]\n\nAs of December 2023, the Ontario government has not made any indication as to whether York Region will be restructured or remain as-is.\n\nEconomy\n\n[edit]\n\nThe economy of York Region is diverse. In general, the economy includes a full range of businesses from industrial to high-tech to rural/agricultural. New developments continually consume space year after year, and tend to be focused along the Yonge Street corridor from Vaughan/Richmond Hill in the south to Newmarket/Aurora in the north. There are ongoing conflicts between conservationists and developers over land use.

This was followed by Islam (7.8%), Judaism (5.2%), Hinduism (5.0%), Buddhism (2.6%) and Sikhism (1.0%). 32.5% of the population did not identify with a particular religion.[35]\n\nHealth care\n\n[edit]\n\nThere are currently four hospitals within the Municipality of York including:\n\nCortellucci Vaughan Hospital\n\nMarkham Stouffville Hospital\n\nMackenzie Richmond Hill Hospital\n\nSouthlake Regional Health Centre\n\nAll four hospitals are part of the Local Health Integration Network (LHIN) Hospital Partnerships.\n\nBoomerang Health, in Vaughan, is a centre that provides multidisciplinary rehabilitation and medical services geared specifically for children and adolescents, in collaboration with The Hospital for Sick Children.[41]\n\nTransportation\n\n[edit]\n\nThe arterial road network in York Region is a grid, with most roads running north–south or east–west. This was done under the leadership of British surveyor Augustus Jones during the 1790s. York Region assigned approximately 50 roads as York Regional Roads, meaning that maintenance of these roads is done by York Region. They are signposted with numbers.\n\nThe major highways in the Region are:\n\nHighway 7 (east-west)\n\nHighway 9 (east-west)\n\nHighway 48 (north-south)\n\nHighway 400 (north-south)\n\nHighway 404 (north-south)\n\nHighway 407 (east-west)\n\nHighway 427 (north-south)\n\nFormer highways include:\n\nHighway 11 (north-south)\n\nHighway 27 (north-south)\n\nHighway 47 (east-west)\n\nHighway 49 (east-west)\n\nHighway 50 (north-south)\n\nNote: Highway 27 and Highway 50 are still referred to as such on municipal road signs, but are no longer provincial highways.\n\nAir transportation\n\n[edit]\n\nMost air travel is served by Toronto Pearson International Airport, which is outside of York Region and is Canada's largest airport. Markham Airport is a private aerodrome in Markham. There are also a few small airports with unpaved runways serving the region: Hare Field in Holland Landing (East Gwillimbury), Belhaven Airport in Georgina, and Stouffville Aerodrome north of Stouffville.\n\nButtonville Municipal Airport was a larger regional airport in Markham that was used for general aviation and business aircraft. It closed in November 2023.[42]\n\nPublic transportation\n\n[edit]\n\nYork Region is served by:\n\nYork Region Transit (YRT), which includes the Viva bus rapid transit network\n\nGO Transit, which offers bus and train service\n\nToronto Transit Commission (TTC), which has several bus routes which cross York's southern border, and which provide service along many north–south arterial streets in Vaughan, Richmond Hill and Markham. Since December 17, 2017, Central Vaughan has been served by the university portion of the Line 1 Yonge-University of Toronto's subway system, and a future extension of the Yonge Street portion of the line will eventually serve the boundary areas of Vaughan, Richmond Hill, and Markham.\n\nUntil 2001, the towns of York Region operated separate public transit services, which did not connect very well with each other. YRT was created by the Regional Government to combine five of these services:\n\nVaughan Transit\n\nMarkham Transit\n\nRichmond Hill Transit\n\nAurora Transit - merged in 1999 with Newmarket Transit\n\nNewmarket Transit\n\nSince 2001, bus routes have been extensively enhanced in the five communities which had pre-existing services, but YRT's services to East Gwillimbury is limited to two routes, and service to King, Georgina and Whitchurch-Stouffville are even more limited due to the relatively small populations in each of those towns.\n\nWater\n\n[edit]\n\nWater in southern York is provided by Toronto Water and Peel Region by way of 3 pumping stations and reservoirs (Bayview, Dufferin and Milliken (tank and underground reservoir)) using water from Lake Ontario.[43] Keswick and Sutton obtain water from Lake Simcoe by way of water treatment plants. The remainder of York obtains water from a combination of water from Lake Ontario and underground wells. Some wells are maintained by the Region and the rest privately.\n\nGeorgina -water from Lake Simcoe and private wells\n\nEast Gwillimbury - region and private wells\n\nNewmarket - region wells and water from Lake Ontario[44]\n\nWhitchurch-Stouffville - Region wells, water from Lake Ontario, private wells\n\nMarkham - water from Lake Ontario and private wells\n\nRichmond Hill - water from Lake Ontario and private wells\n\nAurora - water from Lake Ontario and private wells\n\nVaughan - water from Lake Ontario and private wells\n\nKing - water from Lake Ontario, Region and private wells\n\nWater is distributed from 14 water pumping stations and stored at 37 elevated tanks and reservoirs:[citation needed]\n\nList of water tanks\n\n[edit]\n\nReesor Park water tank - built 1971, now out of service and dismantled\n\nNewmarket - 211 Harry Walker Parkway South\n\nRichmond Hill - 81 Coons Road\n\nSchomberg - 186 Church Street, built 1997\n\nKing - 60 Fisher Street, built 1982\n\nStouffville - 12519 Tenth Line, built 1984\n\nStouffville - Bethesda Rd, built 2005\n\nAurora - 126 Allenvale Drive, 240 Orchard Heights Boulevard, built 1984\n\nAurora - 180 Bloomington Road, built 2008\n\nMarkham - 4355 14th Avenue\n\nTreatment Plants\n\n[edit]\n\nSutton Water Treatment Plant - closed\n\nGeorgina Water Treatment Plant - replaces Sutton plant\n\nKeswick Water Treatment Plant\n\nSchomberg Water Treatment Plant\n\nEducation\n\n[edit]\n\nFour public school boards operate primary and secondary institutions in York Region, Conseil scolaire catholique MonAvenir (CSCM), Conseil scolaire Viamonde (CSV), the York Catholic District School Board (YCDSB), and the York Region District School Board (YRDSB). CSV and YRDSB operate as secular public school boards, the former operating French first language institution, whereas the latter operated English first language institutions. The other two school boards, MonAvenir and YCDSB, operate as public separate school boards, the former operating French first language separate schools, the latter operating English first language separate schools.\n\nYRDSB is the largest public school board in the region, operating 175 elementary schools, and 33 secondary schools. YCDSB operates 83 elementary schools, and 15 secondary schools, while MonAvenir operates five elementary schools, and two secondary schools. CSV is the smallest public school board in the York Region, operating three elementary schools, and one secondary school in the region.\n\nAlong with public schools, the region also holds a number of religious and private schools including:\n\nIn addition to primary and secondary levels of education, the region is also home to post-secondary institutions such as Seneca Polytechnic. The college operates two campuses spread throughout York Region, in King and Markham, as well as additional campuses in Toronto. The region presently does not host a university, but a Markham campus of York University is under construction as of August 2022.[45]\n\nNews media\n\n[edit]\n\nYork Region Media Group\n\nCKVR - CTV Two (based in Barrie)\n\nCFU758 - 90.7 RAV FM (Vaughan)\n\nCKDX 88.5FM - Foxy 88-5 (Newmarket)\n\nCFMS-FM - 105.9 The Region (Markham)\n\nCIWS-FM - WhiStle Community Radio Whitchurch–Stouffville\n\nYork's news media is also served by the outlets based in Toronto.\n\nAttractions\n\n[edit]\n\nYork Region has an assortment of points of interest, ranging from nature reserves to pioneer-era museums, to a modern amusement park.\n\nVaughan's major attractions include the McMichael Canadian Art Collection, in the community of Kleinburg, that features works by Canadian artists including Inuit and First Nations artists.
