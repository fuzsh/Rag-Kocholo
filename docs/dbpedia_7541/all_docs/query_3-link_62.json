        "text": "GOVERNMENT OF CANADA PUBLIC LAND BANK\n\nIn an effort to address the increasing demand for much needed housing across the country, the Government of Canada has created a Public Land Bank mapping tool with the intent to identify available public lands across the country for future development. This tool highlights several Canada Lands Company properties that will be utilized to provide housing where it is needed most, including the Arbo neighbourhood at Downsview, located at 1350 Sheppard Avenue West in Toronto. The first phase of the Arbo neighbourhood is comprised of three development sites which together are zoned for 1,400 housing units.\n\nFEDERAL LANDS INITIATIVE\n\nLaunched on August 25, 2024, in partnership with the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), Public Services and Procurement Canada (PSPC) and Housing, Infrastructure and Communities Canada (HICC); Canada Lands Company is pleased to continue enabling housing through the Federal Lands Initiative (FLI). With a goal to support the transfer of surplus federal land to eligible proponents to expedite the creation of new housing and affordable housing opportunities, the FLI will enable the leasing of land to eligible proponents at a nominal cost.\n\nAs part of the FLI, the 1-hectare (2.4-acre) Arbo Site 3B will be redeveloped to provide a target of 280 housing units with a minimum of 30% dedicated to affordable units. To learn more about the Arbo parcel and criteria to participate, please visit our “Enabling New Housing” page for additional information.\n\nPROPERTY BACKGROUND INFORMATION\n\nIntroducing Arbo, the planned mixed-use, transit-oriented community with connected parks and a protected natural heritage woodlot at its core. The neighbourhood is located at the major intersection of Keele Street and Sheppard Avenue West in Toronto, between Downsview Park to the south and Downsview Park TTC/GO Station to the north and with easy access to Allen Road and Highway 401.\n\nThe Arbo neighbourhood is approximately 25 hectares (62 acres) and is one of five planned neighbourhoods surrounding Downsview Park. A mature woodlot is at the heart of the neighbourhood, providing a quiet spot for people to enjoy nature in the city. The site was once part of the former Canadian Forces Base Toronto.\n\nIn 2021, following two years of consultation, Canada Lands completed public engagement and submitted an application for a District Plan to the City of Toronto that includes 1,400 units of new housing in Phase 1 (with a commitment to provide a minimum of 20% as affordable housing), a mix of uses including commercial retail and services space, a seniors’ component, preservation and restoration of the woodlot, two new public parks, and other amenities.\n\nThe District Plan and zoning for Phase 1 were approved by City Council in July 2022. Canada Lands Company continues to work with the City on the Phase 1 Subdivision, and expect it will be approved in the fall of 2024. The Arbo neighbourhood will be developed over many years, and additional phases will be subject to future development applications."
