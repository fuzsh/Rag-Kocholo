        "text": "Are you planning on moving to Scarborough? 13 things you need to know about Toronto’s forgotten gem\n\nBy Nikola Asambelevski\n\nOn a balmy summer day in 1793, John Graves Simcoe, the first Lieutenant Governor of Upper Canada, and his wife Elizabeth decided to take a stroll along the coastline of Lake Ontario. Elizabeth took special note of the large cliffs that rose high above the coastline, the tallest of the nine peaks reaching over 300 feet.\n\nThe bluffs along the shoreline reminded Elizabeth of the limestone cliffs in the English town of Scarborough. She was so captivated by the natural wonder, that that evening she wrote this entry in her journal, “The shore is extremely bold, and has the appearance of chalk cliffs, but I believe they are only white sand. They appeared so well that we talked of building a summer residence there and calling it Scarborough.” This is how the town of Scarborough got its name. Ever since then, the Scarborough Bluffs have been an integral part of Scarborough’s identity. The Bluffs are a major tourist attraction, with thousands of people coming to see the fantastic views each year.\n\nWhile the Scarborough Bluffs are the most notable natural attraction in Scarborough, the area is known for its abundance of wonderful parks and green spaces. Unlike Downtown Toronto, which is almost completely urbanized, there are large portions of Scarborough that remain untouched by urban development, mainly along the coast of Lake Ontario and the Rouge River heading north towards the Toronto Zoo. This unprecedented access to nature sets Scarborough apart from the other parts of Toronto.\n\nSpeaking of the other parts of Toronto, there is often some confusion about whether or not Scarborough is actually a part of the City of Toronto or its own entity. This confusion is warranted, as the cities and towns that make up the Metropolitan Toronto Area have constantly been changing designations and affiliations for years. Scarborough officially changed its status from borough to city in 1983. On January 1, 1998, Scarborough was amalgamated into the City of Toronto along with the other municipalities of East York, Etobicoke, North York, York, and the original City of Toronto itself. So while Scarborough is technically a part of Toronto, it has always maintained a unique character that makes it distinct from Downtown Toronto and the other municipalities.\n\nOne of the main aspects of Scarborough’s unique character is its incredibly diverse population. Scarborough saw a massive influx of immigrants following World War II. In the decades following the war, Scarborough continued to be a safe haven for people looking to start a new life in Canada. In 2016, 56.6% of Scarborough residents were foreign-born and people that identified as a visible minority made up 73.4% of the population. This is a much higher percentage than Toronto as a whole. The immigrant population has created vibrant multicultural locales in various areas of Scarborough. One of the more notable among these is the heavy concentration of Chinese businesses and restaurants in the Agincourt neighbourhood. Scarborough also has the largest concentration of Sri Lankan Tamils outside Sri Lanka.\n\n1. Scarborough has shed its “Scarberia” image to become one of the premier living destinations in the GTA\n\nScarborough has acquired several nicknames over the years. A popular one is “Scarberia,” a portmanteau of Scarborough and Siberia, a reference to its seemingly distant eastern location from Downtown Toronto and apparent lack of notable attractions. The word originated sometime in the 1960s and has remained a point of contention ever since. There is a common misconception that Scarborough is nothing more than vast suburban wasteland. This could not be further from the truth. Scarborough is an extremely exciting and vibrant city, with a diverse population, amazing food options, and picturesque surroundings. People are just now beginning to discover how great Scarborough is and what it has to offer.\n\nOn top of being a wonderful place to live, Scarborough is also home to several notable people who have gone on to do tremendous things in their lives. The musician The Weeknd famously grew up in West Hill and he often mentions Scarborough and Toronto landmarks in his lyrics. Other notable people that have come out of Scarborough include John Candy, Mike Myers, the Barenaked Ladies, Jonathan Bunce, Kardinal Offishall, k-os, Garry Dee, Lilly Singh, and Olympic sprinter Andre de Grasse.\n\n2. The best neighbourhoods in Scarborough\n\nScarborough is a very large city with many different and distinct neighbourhoods. Each neighbourhood has its own unique quirks and characteristics. Because Scarborough is so expansive, different regions have different geographical touchstones. The most sought after properties tend to be located near notable parks, ravines, and other green spaces. And obviously, properties that are closer to Lake Ontario and the Scarborough Bluffs are extremely popular, even though Scarborough does not have an abundance of beaches or boardwalk attractions.\n\nTop neighbourhoods in Scarborough\n\nHistorically, people have gravitated to the neighbourhoods on the south side of Scarborough because of the proximity to the water and easy access to transportation options that could take them to Downtown Toronto. However, in the last two decades, as the city has developed, many areas north of Eglington Avenue have garnered attention from home buyers. The emergence of the Scarborough Town Centre as a major social hub has also lead to a lot of north Scarborough neighbourhoods blossoming.\n\nBirch Cliff- Birch Cliff is a well-established, family-oriented neighbourhood set amidst the idyllic backdrop of the Scarborough Bluffs and Lake Ontario. Drawing attention away from the lake is Kingston Road, a major thoroughfare that makes its way through the centre of this neighbourhood.\n\nThe average cost of a two-bedroom detached house in Birch Cliff is $1.1 million\n\nWest Hill- Located just west of Highland Creek, West Hill is known for its natural beauty derived from Morningside Park and Colonel Danforth Park, which form the boundaries of this neighbourhood. Due to its picturesque surroundings and proximity to the water, West Hill is one of the most in-demand neighbourhoods in Scarborough.\n\nThe average cost of a two-bedroom detached house in West Hill is $788 thousand\n\nMalvern- Located right by the Toronto Zoo and Highway 401, Malvern’s affordable real estate has traditionally attracted many new Canadians to the neighbourhood. There are over sixty different cultures represented here including people of Afro-Canadian, British, Chinese, and East Indian backgrounds.\n\nThe average rent for a one-bedroom apartment in Malvern is $ $1,650 per month\n\nAgincourt- Located towards the north end of Scarborough, Agincourt has one of the largest Asian communities in Toronto. This ethnic mix is visible in the signage of the many shopping malls that proliferate in the neighbourhood.\n\nThe average cost of a two-bedroom detached house in Agincourt is $766 thousand\n\nLow profile neighbourhoods/up and coming neighbourhoods\n\nScarborough is in the midst of a major development boom. New housing and condo developments are starting up all over Scarborough, changing the city from a largely suburban environment to a more of an urban centre. The introduction of the Eglinton Crosstown LRT has lead to massive developments happening along Eglinton Avenue in the heart of Scarborough. As always, the Scarborough Town Centre is the hub of social life in the area, so housing near the shopping centre is always in high demand. Here are a few up and coming neighbourhoods to keep your eye on.\n\nMilliken- Located on the northern border of Scarborough, Milliken is a relatively new neighbourhood only being urbanized in the late 1980s. The neighbourhood has many outstanding features including a modern public library and neighbourhood centre, the beautifully designed Milliken Park, and the Milliken Park Recreational Trail which winds its way through this neighbourhood.\n\nThe average cost of a two-bedroom detached house in Milliken is $675 thousand\n\nL’Amoreaux- The greater L’Amoreaux neighbourhood is made up of the planned subdivision communities of Bridlewood, Wishing Well, and Bamburgh, each containing their own school, shopping, and parks.\n\nThe average cost of a two-bedroom detached house in L’Amoreaux is $659 thousand\n\nIonview- Situated right next to Scarborough’s industrial district “the Golden Mile,” Ionview is an emerging neighbourhood with amazing access to transportation options. The value of property in this neighbourhood is set to skyrocket following the completion of the Crosstown LRT.\n\nThe average rent for a one-bedroom apartment in Ionview is $1,513 per month\n\nSuburban neighbourhoods\n\nScarborough is quickly developing into a major urban centre, however; there are still many parts of the city that have maintained a small town suburban feel. Scarborough’s suburban neighbourhoods are accompanied by beautiful parks, quiet residential streets, and affordable houses built on generous lots.\n\nBendale- Bendale is a culturally diverse, middle-income neighbourhood that is conveniently located near TTC and Go Transit lines. Neighbourhood landmarks include Thompson Memorial Park, the Scarborough Civic Centre and Scarborough General Hospital.\n\nThe average cost of a two-bedroom detached house in Bendale is $700 thousand\n\nGuildwood– Located right by the Scarborough Bluffs, Guildwood Village is one of Toronto’s most beautiful and inclusive neighbourhoods. The major landmark in this neighbourhood is the historic Guild Inn, located at 201 Guildwood Parkway.\n\nThe average cost of a two-bedroom detached house in Guildwood is $824 thousand\n\nMorningside– Also known as Seven Oaks, this suburban neighbourhood is located right next to the University of Toronto Scarborough Campus. Morningside has amazing access to nature with the Highland Creek Ravine passing right through the centre of the neighbourhood.\n\nThe average cost of a two-bedroom detached house in Morningside is $626 thousand\n\n3. Scarborough is one of the safest areas of Toronto but is often misrepresented\n\nWhile Scarborough has received a reputation for having high crime rates, these rumors are unfounded. According to the Toronto Police website, the violent crime rate in the rest of Toronto is three per cent higher than it is in Scarborough. Many city councillors have spoken out about how the representation of Scarborough as a dangerous place is unfair and untrue. Whenever a crime happens in any part of Scarborough, it is automatically labeled a “crime in Scarborough,” while crimes that happen in other parts of Toronto are reported according to the intersection they occur in. This bias in reporting has perpetuated the myth that Scarborough is a dangerous place to live, when in reality, Scarborough is one of the safest places in the GTA.\n\n4. The cost of living in Scarborough- a much more affordable alternative to Toronto\n\nWhen compared to smaller cities in southern Ontario, Scarborough is still quite an expensive place to live, however; when compared to Downtown Toronto, Scarborough is significantly more affordable. If you are looking for a cheaper alternative to Toronto, while still being able to easily commute to the city centre, Scarborough is the perfect place for you.\n\nScarborough is a former borough of the former Metropolitan Toronto, and as such, its economy is an integral component of the economy of Toronto. Compared to the City of Toronto as a whole, industry in Scarborough is similar in all labour force categories, except for manufacturing, which is higher in Scarborough. Notable companies that have their headquarters in Scarborough include Toyota Canada, Owens Corning (Toronto), Elizabeth Grant International, Enterprise Holdings, Inc., Thomson Carswell, Bell Media, Mastermind Toys, President’s Choice Financial, Aviva, Tellus, and many others. Amazon has also opened a new fulfillment centre in north Scarborough in 2020. Points of interest in the area include Scarborough Town Centre, Albert Campbell Square, and the Canadian government buildings and office towers. The area has become one of Toronto’s new secondary business districts outside of Downtown Toronto.\n\n5. What to expect from Scarborough weather\n\nScarborough’s climate is not as extreme as other cities in Canada because of its southerly location within the country and the proximity to Lake Ontario. It has been classified as a humid continental climate, with warm, humid summers and generally cold winters. Mean temperature and precipitation tends to be slightly lower than the downtown core or south Etobicoke for instance. Conditions vary based on proximity to the lake, with fog more common in the south and areas close to the lake noticeably cooler on hot summer days.\n\nTypically, the hottest month in Scarborough is July, with the average high of 26°C. The coldest months of the year are January and February, when the average low drops to -8°C. While Scarborough gets relatively little snowfall at just around 38 snowy days per year, it does get a fair share of rain with 150 rainy days per year.\n\n6. Making your way around Scarborough\n\nWhile Scarborough has excellent access to public transportation via the Toronto Transit Commission, many people still consider Scarborough a motorist-centric city.\n\nScarborough is at the eastern end of Line 2 Bloor–Danforth of the Toronto subway system. There are three subway stations in Scarborough: Victoria Park, Warden, and Kennedy. Beginning at Kennedy station, Line 3 Scarborough, also known as the Scarborough RT, runs north and east toward Scarborough City Centre.\n\nAn extension of Line 2 started in June 2021 and is expected to be complete around 2030. The line will be extended 7.8 kilometers and will include three new stations from the existing Kennedy station to McCowan Road and Sheppard Avenue. Line 3 is planned to be decommissioned in 2023. Line 5 Eglinton is a light rail line under construction, which will run right through the centre of Scarborough, greatly improving the public transit options in the northern half of the city.\n\nScarborough’s infrastructure is very motorist-friendly. The arterial roads of Scarborough were laid out on a grid system of north–south and east–west. The only roads that diverge from this pattern are Kingston Road and Danforth Road, which were laid out prior to the surveying of the township, and both run diagonally in a southwest–northeast direction across the south end of Scarborough.\n\nKingston Road was formerly Ontario Highway 2, and was the main highway through Scarborough until the building of the Highway 401, which runs east–west across the middle of Scarborough, with six to eight lanes in each direction.\n\n7. Scarborough’s amazing access to amenities and healthcare\n\nLiving in Scarborough, you have access to great hospitals that provide a wide array of health services such as: Birchmount Hospital, Centenary Hospital and Scarborough General Hospital. All of these hospitals are under the Scarborough Health Network Corporation. Birchmount Hospital is located at 3030 Birchmount Rd, Centenary Hospital is located at 2867 Ellesmere Rd, and Scarborough General Hospital is located at 3050 Lawrence Ave E. The Scarborough Health Network has North America’s largest nephrology program and regional community-based cardiovascular rehabilitation service. The Centre is also a community-affiliated teaching site for the University of Toronto, and a partner with a number of other universities and colleges, helping to train the next generation of health care professionals.\n\n8. Scarborough’s bustling multicultural food scene\n\nScarborough has an extremely diverse community made up of people from all over the world. This diversity is reflected in the city’s eclectic dining options. From roti to Hakka food and old-school burger joints, the options are endless. And while Scarborough has its fair share of fine dining restaurants, the city’s food scene really shines in its small take-out spots, which are hard to find if you aren’t a local.

It also has areas such as the Kids Zoo, Waterside Theatre, and Splash Island. It is currently home to over 5,000 animals (including invertebrates and fish) representing over 500 species.\n\nThe zoo opened on August 15, 1974, as the Metropolitan Toronto Zoo. The word “Metropolitan” was dropped from its name when the individual municipalities that make up the Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto was amalgamated into the current city in 1998. The zoo is located near the Rouge River on the western border of Rouge Park in the city’s east end district of Scarborough. The trails criss-crossing the zoo and branching into the ravine provide a particularly fun and entertaining workout for hikers.\n\n10. Scarborough is Toronto’s greenest borough with excellent access to the great outdoors\n\nWhile much of Scarborough has been urbanized, there are still several pockets of greenery throughout.

Scarborough is home to a wide variety of wild animals and birds.

Some things to consider when moving to Scarborough\n\nIf you are moving from outside of Canada, make sure you have a valid travel document, a valid visa, and confirmation of Permanent Residence for you and each family member traveling with you. Make sure to bring any health documents with you that can help your future doctor give you and your family the best care, including immunization records, lists of medical conditions and major surgeries, and lists of medications frequently taken. While this may seem obvious, make sure to arrive with an appropriate wardrobe. Scarborough is old of the warmer cities in Canada but the winters can still be tough, especially if you are moving from a tropical climate. So, make sure to buy yourself a good winter coat.\n\nIf you are moving to Scarborough from within Canada, here are some things you should do before your move. Start cleaning your home and slowly packing items room by room early so that you don’t get overwhelmed as your move out date approaches. Take an inventory of everything you own. This will help you decide what you want to keep and what you want to get rid of. It will also help you keep track of your items during the move and identify if you lose anything. Transfer your memberships, mail, and fill out change of address form. Buy packing supplies, blankets, boxes, tape, moving straps, dollies, and cleaning products. Make transportation arrangements; check if your new place has a designated moving in period.\n\nHiring a moving company might be your best course of action if you are moving long distance. For example, if your are moving from Vancouver British Columbia to Scarborough, it might be best to hire a professional moving company or portable storage company to transport your belongings cross-country to ensure the move goes smoothly. Compare at least three different companies so that you know you are getting the best deal. Make sure the estimate is comprehensive and realistic considering what you need to move. Some movers may quote a cheap price and charge extra on the moving date.\n\nRent a self-storage unit for any additional items you might have and to help alleviate some of the pressure on move-in day. On the day of the move, make sure to start early. Moving day can be very stressful so make sure you leave yourself a lot of extra time in case you need it.\n\n13.
