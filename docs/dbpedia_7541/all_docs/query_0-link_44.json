        "text": "A fact unknown to many is that our local history surrounds us everyday, printed out on local street signs. Some are named for local settlers, politicians, war heroes, or simply for the subdivision developments these roads are situated within.\n\nSince being founded in 1956, the Scarborough Historical Society has been instrumental in assisting the City of Scarborough (and now the City of Toronto) by providing suggestions for street names of local historical merit for new road developments in the Community of Scarborough.
