These are the sacred grounds of the Anishinaabek, Wendat and Haudenosaunee peoples, past and present, and remain home to many Indigenous Nations from across Turtle Island. We are grateful to live, learn, work, and play on Tkaronto, the place in the water where the trees are standing.\n\nOur community recognizes the traditional stewards that have cared for this land through the generations. We are committed to learning about the historical impact and hurt that colonialism and broken treaties continue to have on Indigenous peoples. It is our responsibility to honour and participate in the journey of reconciliation."
