        "text": "Introduction\n\nBritish Loyalists who fled the United States to escape persecution after the American Revolution were the founders of what is now the Canadian province of Ontario. Ever since the first federal census was taken in 1871, the province has ranked first in population. Today more than two-fifths of the people are of British or Irish ancestry. More than half of the immigrants to Canada since World War II have settled in Ontario, giving the province a cosmopolitan atmosphere.\n\nOntario is called the “Heartland of Canada.” Among its advantages are abundant and varied natural resources such as water and timber, ready transportation, and nearby markets for manufactured goods. Although Ontario is the most industrialized and one of the most urbanized provinces in Canada, it also has the greatest number of farms and is the largest gold producer.\n\nA line drawn from Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario, eastward to the Quebec border divides the province into two distinct sections. The northern area, where the mineral wealth and timber are located, is sparsely populated in comparison with the industrial-urban south. Six of Canada’s chief metropolitan areas—Ottawa, the national capital; Toronto, the provincial capital; and the manufacturing cities of Hamilton, Windsor, London, and Kitchener—all lie within the south.\n\nOntario is bordered to the east by Quebec and to the west by Manitoba. The southern boundary of Ontario is more than 1,700 miles (2,700 kilometers) long. Four of the five Great Lakes, Lake St. Clair, and the St. Lawrence River form most of the border between this Canadian province and the United States. The Ontario shoreline extends more than 3,000 miles (4,800 kilometers). The shoreline includes 752 miles (1,210 kilometers) of saltwater coast along Hudson Bay and James Bay, which form the province’s northern border.\n\nThe name Ontario comes from an Iroquoian word for Lake Ontario, variously translated as “sparkling” or “beautiful” water or lake, or “large body of water.” The name of Toronto, the provincial capital, is also of First Nations origin. Tarantou, meaning “place of meeting,” was the site of a French settlement at the junction of trails leading north- and westward. Fur traders used the trails to bring pelts from the interior, and settlers used them after 1763 to push the frontier westward.\n\nToday Toronto is Canada’s leading manufacturing center. It is also a major publishing hub, a financial center, and a busy port for oceangoing vessels.\n\nMany tourists are attracted to Ontario by its water. Niagara Falls has long been a favorite spot for sightseers, and a quarter of a million lakes provide recreational facilities for every taste.\n\nOntario is second in size among the provinces of Canada. Only Quebec is larger. Ontario’s area of 415,599 square miles (1,076,395 square kilometers) is as large as the section of the United States north of the Ohio River from the Mississippi River to the Atlantic Ocean. Population (2021) 14,223,942; (2023 est.) 15,801,768.\n\nProvince of Four Natural Regions\n\nOntario lies in four natural regions, each running across the province in a somewhat lateral direction. Starting with the southernmost region and moving northward, the four regions are the Great Lakes–St. Lawrence Lowlands, the Canadian Shield, the Hudson Bay Lowland, and the Arctic Region.\n\nGreat Lakes–St. Lawrence Lowlands\n\nThe most heavily populated area in the province is the Great Lakes–St. Lawrence Lowlands subdivision. These lowlands consist of a peninsula that lies between Lakes Ontario and Erie on the southeast and Lake Huron on the northwest as well as a small triangle that lies between the Ottawa and St. Lawrence rivers. The peninsular part of the subdivision is gently rolling to hilly land, with deep, rich soil and a climate tempered by the Great Lakes. This is one of the world’s major industrial areas. Most of the province’s agriculture is also concentrated in this region. Here too are many of Ontario’s largest and most important cities.\n\nThe Niagara Escarpment divides the peninsula into eastern and western sections. Niagara Falls plunges over the escarpment, which is a flat-topped, hard limestone ridge averaging about 350 feet (107 meters) in height. The escarpment arches from the peninsula of Niagara, between Lakes Ontario and Erie, to the Bruce Peninsula, between Lake Huron and Georgian Bay, and across Manitoulin Island into the United States. In order to preserve the Niagara Escarpment’s unique ecosystem, a United Nations agency designated it a World Biosphere Reserve in 1990.\n\nThe Ottawa–St. Lawrence part of the lowlands is separated from the peninsula by the narrow wedge of the Canadian Shield that reaches the St. Lawrence River. This lowland area is located in the southeast.\n\nCanadian Shield, Hudson Bay Lowland, and the Arctic Region\n\nThe Canadian Shield is a plateau of Precambrian rock, one of the most ancient formations in the world. The vast, gently sloping tableland stands about 1,000 feet (300 meters) above sea level throughout most of Ontario. Ridges and peaks rise a few hundred feet higher in many places. The highest point in the province is Ishpatina Ridge at 2,274 feet (693 meters), north of Georgian Bay.\n\nMuch of the Canadian Shield is covered with forests. The region contains thousands of lakes and many swamps and bogs. There are also long stretches of sand and bare rock. Scattered around are patches of fertile land, known as clay pockets. In these pockets some hardy crops are raised. The soil is a mixture of clay, sand, and humus.\n\nMost of Ontario’s mineral deposits are located in the Canadian Shield, and mining, smelting, and refining are major activities. Thunder Bay on Lake Superior and Sault Ste. Marie on the canal between Lakes Superior and Huron are leading ports. Greater Sudbury and Kenora are among the many mining centers. North Bay, located along a historic trade route, is an important fur auction and lumbering area.\n\nA series of heights mark the northern boundaries of the Canadian Shield and the Hudson Bay Lowland. Some of the Hudson Bay Lowland is forested, especially in the southern parts of the area. Farther north, the region consists largely of swamps and bogs, with scrubby trees growing here and there. The Arctic Region is a treeless area of mostly frozen ground (permafrost) that borders the shores of Hudson and James bays. It is sometimes considered to be a part of the Hudson Bay Lowland.\n\nRivers and Lakes\n\nThe St. Lawrence River, which separates Ontario from New York State, is a major source of hydroelectric power. Since the opening of the St. Lawrence Seaway in 1959, deep-draft oceangoing vessels have called at Ontario’s Great Lakes ports. Two major links in the seaway are the Welland Ship Canal, which bypasses Niagara Falls, and the Sault Ste. Marie Canal, popularly known as the Soo, which links Lakes Superior and Huron.\n\nThe Ottawa River, 696 miles (1,120 kilometers) long, rises in the Canadian Shield and flows into the St. Lawrence. It is the principal tributary of the St. Lawrence drainage system.\n\nMost of the rivers of northern Ontario drain into Hudson Bay or James Bay. The 340-mile- (547-kilometer-) long Abitibi River is harnessed for power used in the pulp and paper mills of the area. The western margin of the province is drained by the Nelson River system of Manitoba.\n\nOntario shares with the United States the waters of four of the Great Lakes—Superior, Huron, Erie, and Ontario. Among the popular lake-resort areas are island-studded Georgian Bay, which is an arm of Lake Huron, and Lakes Muskoka, Nipissing, Nipigon, Simcoe, and Timagami.\n\nClimate\n\nLike most other provinces of Canada, Ontario has a continental climate. Northern Ontario has long, very cold winters and short summers. The southern part of the province, however, enjoys the tempering effect of the Great Lakes.\n\nRainfall is distributed throughout the year. At Toronto the average annual rainfall is 31 inches (79 centimeters), and the snowfall 54 inches (137 centimeters). The growing season in the Toronto region averages 164 days a year. By contrast, the growing season is only 82 days in the Kapuskasing area of east-central Ontario. In Toronto the January mean temperature is 20.7 °F (–6.3 °C) and the July mean is 69.4 °F (20.8 ° C). In Kapuskasing the January mean is –1.7 °F (–18.7 °C) and the July mean is 63.0 °F (17.2 °C).\n\nTourist Attractions\n\nThe tourist industry is a vital source of income to the province. Transportation by air, water, rail, and highway is excellent. The most popular summer-resort country is the forested, lake-dotted southern part of the Canadian Shield. Many tourists drive over Ontario’s section of the Trans-Canada Highway.\n\nOntario has more than 300 provincial parks, which cover a combined area of roughly 20 million acres (8 million hectares). Millions of people visit the parks each year. Ontario also has several national parks. (See also national parks, “Canadian National Parks.”)\n\nNational historic sites in Ontario include Fort Malden at Amherstburg, a defense post completed in 1799; Fort Wellington at Prescott, a defense post completed in 1813; and Woodside at Kitchener, the boyhood home of Mackenzie King, who was three times prime minister of Canada. The house where Sir John A. Macdonald, the first Canadian prime minister, lived in about 1848 is preserved at Bellevue House National Historic Site at Kingston. Fort St. Joseph National Historic Site on St. Joseph’s Island contains the remains of a fort built in the 1790s.\n\nA popular annual event in Ontario is the excellent Stratford Festival, which features Shakespearean drama. The natural beauty of the province is celebrated in many other festivals—from the Canadian Tulip Festival in Ottawa to the Six Nations Native Pageant held near Brantford.\n\nPeople\n\nOntario’s population is the largest of any province in Canada. Most of the people live in urban areas, especially in the south. The southern peninsula is one of Canada’s most thickly settled areas, and Ontario ranks third among the provinces in population density.\n\nPeople of European origin make up more than three-fifths of Ontario’s people. Within this group, the largest numbers of people are of English, Irish, or Scottish descent. Ontario is one of the most ethnically diverse of the Canadian provinces, especially in Toronto and other cities. More than a third of Ontario’s people belong to so-called visible minorities—people, other than Indigenous peoples, whose ancestry is not European. The largest visible minority groups are people of South Asian and Chinese descent.\n\nAlmost one-fourth of Canada’s Indigenous people live in Ontario. Most of them are First Nations people. Ontario has more than 130 First Nations communities. There are much smaller numbers of Métis, people of mixed European and Indigenous descent, and Inuit.\n\nNoted writers born in Ontario include Sir Gilbert Parker, Ralph Connor (Charles W. Gordon), Archibald Lampman, and Duncan C. Scott. (See Canadian literature.) Ontario is the birthplace of four prime ministers—Mackenzie King, John G. Diefenbaker, Lester B. Pearson, and Paul Martin.\n\nEconomy\n\nOntario has the largest economy of the Canadian provinces by far. As in most urban societies, Ontario’s economy is now dominated by the service sector. Services account for most of the province’s gross domestic product (the yearly value of goods and services produced) and employ most of its workers. Service jobs occur in the fields of finance, insurance, real estate, business, trade, law, health care, social work, education, government, transportation, and tourism. Industry is also an important foundation of the economy. Ontario is Canada’s leading manufacturing province.\n\nAlthough Ontario is one of the major agricultural regions of Canada, farming represents only a very small percentage of the province’s gross domestic product. Ontario is one of the leading provinces in the total dollar amount obtained from the sale of farm products. The province contains about half of Canada’s highest-quality farmland. Most of its farms are in the southern peninsula. It is the only section of the province where deep fertile soil is combined with a mild climate and a long growing season. Farming in northern Ontario is confined largely to the clay pockets stretching westward from the Quebec border to about the center of Ontario. Fruits and vegetables grown in nurseries also contribute to the province’s agricultural output.\n\nThe chief sources of income for Ontario’s farmers are dairy products, vegetables, soybeans, corn (maize), cattle and calves, flowers and nursery products, poultry, and hogs. Fruit growing is a major activity in the Niagara region of the province along Lake Ontario. Apples, peaches, plums, and grapes are important products. Ontario leads the provinces in the production of tobacco, which is grown in the counties adjacent to Lake Erie. Other specialty crops include dry beans and mushrooms.\n\nForests cover more than half of Ontario’s land area. The provincial government controls cutting by issuing licenses to private companies. Lumber camps and sawmills are located primarily in the northern areas of the province. Once cut, the logs are processed for use as building board, plywood, and many other types of wood and paper products.\n\nOntario is second only to the province of Alberta in the value of mineral output. It is one of the world’s largest producers of nickel, and it is among Canada’s top producers of gold, copper, silver, platinum metals, sand and gravel, and stone. One of Ontario’s oldest mining and smelting areas is in the Sudbury Basin, north of Georgian Bay. Nickel was discovered there in 1883 during construction of the Canadian Pacific Railway.\n\nOntario produces about half the value of all goods manufactured in Canada. Almost all of Ontario’s industrial plants are located in the southern part of the province. Manufacturing has been drawn there for several reasons. Close at hand are such raw materials as timber and minerals to the north and farm products in the neighboring countryside.\n\nThe St. Lawrence–Great Lakes waterway system provides low-cost transportation westward to markets in the interior of the continent and eastward to the trade routes of the world. Hydroelectric power is available from Niagara Falls and from the rapids of the St. Lawrence and Ottawa rivers and their tributaries. The dense population provides both a skilled labor force and a large market.\n\nThe production of automobiles and automotive parts is one of Ontario’s most valuable industries. The province leads the rest of Canada in food manufacturing as well as in the production of machinery and equipment and industrial chemicals. Much of Canada’s iron and steel production is concentrated in Ontario. The manufacture of computers and other electronics is also important. In the late 20th century a thriving information technology industry, dubbed “Silicon Valley North,” emerged in the province, notably in the Kitchener-Waterloo area and the Ottawa suburb of Kanata.\n\nThe petrochemical industry is one of the province’s major industries, and Sarnia, located at the foot of Lake Huron, is one of the country’s leading production centers. Oil and gas from the Prairie Provinces provide the raw materials for plants manufacturing plastics, synthetic resins, synthetic rubber and textiles, and agricultural chemicals.\n\nOntario is one of Canada’s leading provinces for petroleum refining, along with Quebec and Alberta. Conventional thermal power and hydroelectric power together account for almost one-half of Ontario’s electrical energy, and nuclear power accounts for the remainder.\n\nIn 1965 a power failure in an electricity-generating plant at Queenston caused a massive blackout over an area covering southern Ontario and part of the northeastern United States. An even larger blackout occurred in the same region in 2003, when a power plant failed in Ohio. The plant shutdown caused problems along its transmission lines, which in turn caused power failures in the cities of Toronto and Ottawa.\n\nIn 1994 Ontario’s close economic partnership with the United States was reinforced by the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). The agreement ended many of the trade barriers between the two regions. Since NAFTA, Ontario’s export goods have had easier access to the large markets in the United States and Mexico, the third partner in the agreement. The service sector in Ontario also benefited from NAFTA. Commercial services in the areas of management and advertising were profitably exported to Mexico.\n\nCities\n\nToronto, the province’s largest city, is also Canada’s largest metropolitan area. It is the provincial capital and the commercial, financial, industrial, and educational center of Ontario.\n\nOntario’s second largest city is Ottawa, the national capital. Mississauga, the third largest city, is a seaway port and an industrial and residential area. Hamilton, the fourth city in size and a leading Great Lakes port, is noted for its steel industry. London is the industrial and distributing heart of the rich farmlands of the southern peninsula.\n\nEducation\n\nOntario’s elementary-school system consists of public schools and separate Roman Catholic schools. It is under the supervision of the minister of education. Local administration is exercised by school boards, whose members are elected by popular vote. Roman Catholic elementary schools have long received provincial financial support. In the late 1980s this support was extended through the high-school level. In both public and Roman Catholic schools, instruction is available in French and English. The province also operates separate schools for children who are deaf or blind or who have severe learning disabilities.\n\nThe preeminent provider of higher education in Ontario is the University of Toronto. Its seven federated colleges are St. Michael’s, Trinity, Victoria, Knox, Wycliffe, Regis, and Emmanuel. Ontario’s other colleges and universities include Laurentian University of Greater Sudbury; McMaster University in Hamilton; the University of Ottawa and Carleton University in Ottawa; Queen’s University and the Royal Military College of Canada in Kingston; the University of Waterloo and Wilfrid Laurier University in Waterloo; the University of Western Ontario in London; and the University of Windsor. There are also Brock University in St. Catharines; York University in North York; Lakehead University in Thunder Bay; the University of Guelph; and Trent University in Peterborough. Ontario is the site of OCAD University (formerly the Ontario College of Art and Design), in Toronto, as well as a number of colleges of applied arts and technology.\n\nGovernment\n\nThe government of Ontario is formally headed by the lieutenant governor, who represents the British crown. The actual power lies with the Legislative Assembly and the Executive Council, or cabinet, headed by the premier.\n\nThe Progressive Conservative Party was dominant in Ontario politics for much of the 20th century. After governing the province for 42 years, it lost its ruling position in 1985 to the Liberal Party. The Liberals, the New Democratic Party, and the Conservatives alternated in power through the end of the 20th century and into the 21st century. During the early 21st century the Progressive Conservative Party merged with the Canadian Alliance to form the Conservative Party of Canada.\n\nHistory\n\nThe land that is now Ontario includes the traditional homelands of several First Nations peoples. In the north were the Algonquin, the Ojibwe, the Odawa (Ottawa), and the Mushkegowuk (Cree). In the south were the Wendat (Huron), the Potawatomi, and the Attiwandaron (Neutral). The Haudenosaunee (Iroquois) lived to the east, in what is now the U.S. state of New York.\n\nIn the 1530s the French claimed land in eastern Canada that they called New France. For nearly 200 years the Haudenosaunee resisted French settlement in the region west of Montreal. The first known French explorer to reach Ontario was Étienne Brulé, who traveled the Ottawa River in 1610–11. He was soon followed by Samuel de Champlain and other French explorers, fur traders, and missionaries. The Wendat allied themselves with the French and partnered with them in the valuable fur trade. The Wendat competed with the Haudenosaunee for control of this trade, and the two groups became bitter enemies. In 1648–50 the Haudenosaunee defeated the Huron in battle and forced the survivors to flee the region.\n\nMeanwhile, the French continued their explorations. The fur traders Pierre Esprit de Radisson and Médart Chouart, sieur (lord) de Groseilliers, pushed deep into Ontario in the mid-1600s, and René-Robert Cavelier, sieur de La Salle, sailed the Great Lakes bordering Ontario in 1679–80. In 1673 Count Louis de Frontenac, governor of New France, challenged the Haudenosaunee by building Fort Frontenac at the outlet of the St. Lawrence River near where Kingston now stands.\n\nThe real founders of Ontario were United Empire Loyalists, colonists who were persecuted as Tories in the United States for supporting Great Britain during the American Revolution. By 1783 about 10,000 of them had settled on the northern shores of Lakes Erie and Ontario and along the upper St. Lawrence River. Refusing to adopt the French civil law and the Roman Catholic faith of their neighbors to the east, they forced the division of Canada into two provinces in 1791—Upper Canada (Ontario) and Lower Canada (Quebec).\n\nThe first lieutenant governor of Upper Canada was Colonel John Graves Simcoe. The site of the first capital was located on the Niagara River. In 1793 Simcoe founded a new capital on Lake Ontario and named it York for the duke of York, son of King George III. Many years later it was renamed Toronto.\n\nIn about 1802 Thomas Talbot, a young Irish officer who had served on Simcoe’s staff, obtained a grant of many thousands of acres and in 1803 established the Talbot Settlement. Its capital was named St. Thomas. The Loyalists were joined by new arrivals from Great Britain and the United States. By 1812 the population of Upper Canada was about 90,000.\n\nOntario bore the brunt of the War of 1812. The United States underestimated the loyalty and ability of the handful of farmers there. General Isaac Brock, the “hero of Upper Canada,” and Tecumseh, his Indigenous ally, seized Detroit (now in Michigan) at the war’s outset. At Queenston Heights, Lundy’s Lane, and other battlefronts, the Loyalists again showed their determination to remain British.\n\nAnother colonizer was John Galt, the Scottish novelist. In 1824 Galt founded the Canada Company, which bought almost 1,500,000 acres (600,000 hectares) reaching from west of York to Lake Huron. By 1837 the population of Upper Canada had grown to 350,000.\n\nIncreasing friction between the popularly elected assembly and the autocratic executive council, which was called the Family Compact, led to a short-lived rebellion in 1837 under William Lyon Mackenzie. John George Lambton, earl of Durham, was appointed to investigate the causes of the discontent in both Upper and Lower Canada. He recommended that the two be reunited.\n\nAfter the Act of Union, effective in 1841, Upper Canada was known as Canada West. In 1867 it became a province of the newly formed Dominion of Canada and was named Ontario. The provincial boundaries were extended in 1888.\n\nThe population grew rapidly through immigration before World War I and after World War II, and the mineral and industrial output expanded with it. A 1950 treaty between the United States and Canada provided for increased power at Niagara Falls. The completion of a petroleum pipeline from Alberta to Sarnia in 1953 and the opening of the St. Lawrence Seaway in 1959 gave further impetus to industrial development.\n\nSince the mid-1990s Ontario has undergone an extensive municipal reorganization. The province dissolved many of its smaller communities by merging them with the larger municipalities in their area. As a result, both Toronto and Ottawa (as well as several other municipalities) increased in size and population in 2001. In some cases, new cities, such as Greater Sudbury and Kawartha Lakes, were created. Between 1996 and 2006 Ontario reduced the total number of its communities from 815 to fewer than 450. Thus, within a decade, the province had decreased the number of its cities, towns, and other political entities by more than 40 percent.\n\nAdditional Reading\n\nKearney, Mark, and Ray, Randy.
