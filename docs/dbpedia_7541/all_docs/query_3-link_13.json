        "text": "I have never understood the full appeal of hometown heroes Rush. The Ayn Rand-inspired lyrics creeped me out sometimes, the music a little too technically precise for Rock and Roll (though admirable from a musicianship point-of-view), and their fans a little too passionate (always guys, if I recall, with a near-homoerotic lust for Neil Peart and his ace drumming skills). That’s just personal taste though, and they seem like genuinely nice guys who care about things (Geddy Lee is often seen walking around Yonge Street in its Rosedale stretch) so it was neat to stumble on the video for their 1982 song Subdivisions. They’re a little too hard on the suburbs probably (they were Willowdale boys after all), but this video was shot all around Toronto, with some great vintage shots of the Yonge strip and a Moriyama designed high school. From the Wikipedia entry:\n\nThe promotional videos scenes were filmed in the Toronto area. The downtown scenes in downtown Toronto, the suburbs scenes in Scarborough, Ontario, near Warden and Finch. The high school scenes were filmed at L’Amoreaux Collegiate Institute, in the same area. The student that walks downtown in the video is Dave Glover, a student at the L’Amoreaux Collegiate Institute at the time. Near the end of the video, Glover is seen playing the video game Tempest at an arcade, which was reportedly his favorite video game at the time.\n\nAt about 20 seconds into the video, there is a shot of what appears to be the DVP, but I don’t recognize the train passing over. It’s not the TTC, GO or VIA. Any of our transit buffs know — or did VIA have a different livery back then? Is it even Toronto (though those two road tunnels suggest as much, but I can’t recall where a train passes over the roadway)? And Dave Glover, where are you now?"
