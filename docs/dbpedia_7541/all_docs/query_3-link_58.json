        "text": "Just like its millions of permanent residents, the types of houses in Toronto are beautifully diverse and full of character. And, no matter which Toronto neighbourhood you find yourself in, there’s bound to be a representation of at least a few different architectural styles in each area.\n\nWhether they’re original heritage-designated homes built hundreds of years ago or modern masterpieces constructed only recently, the homes found in our city each offer their own unique glimpse into Toronto’s architectural history.\n\nTo learn more about some of the most archetypal types of houses in Toronto and where to find them, our guide is here for you.\n\nVictorian Era Homes\n\nOne of the most iconic types of houses in Toronto is the Victorian-era home. Heavily dispersed between different neighbourhoods across the city, many of these homes were originally constructed when much of residential Toronto was first being built.\n\nVictorian-era homes are often characterized by architectural details like trademark Toronto red-brick exteriors, sharply gabled ceilings, angular bay windows, and a relatively narrow overall width.\n\nVictorians take their name from the style of architecture that saw widespread popularity during the rule of Queen Victoria of Great Britain, between 1837 and 1901. It was during this time in the late 19th century when many Victorian-style houses in Toronto were first designed, and can be easily spotted across many different Toronto neighbourhoods including The Annex, Rosedale, Cabbagetown, Parkdale, and many more.\n\nWant to know more about the lifestyle you’ll enjoy in the West End?

In terms of Edwardian architecture, this era is defined by the style of homes that were constructed during that decade and up until about 1914.\n\nDespite being so close in proximity to the Victorian era, Edwardian era architecture was much different in concept and aesthetic to traditional Victorian homes. Instead, Edwardian-style homes are generally less ornate than Victorians, and tend to be wider, boxier, and with more substantial front porches in place of the Victorian bay windows.\n\nSome great examples of trademark Edwardian architecture can be found in Toronto neighbourhoods such as Roncesvalles, North Toronto, and Baby Point.\n\nTudor Revival Homes\n\nWhile original Tudor-style architecture was popularized across Europe and the United Kingdom during the Tudor period between 1485 and 1603, there are many types of houses in Toronto built much later that were heavily influenced by what’s known as the Tudor Revival period.\n\nThe Tudor Revival style was another seminal influence on Toronto’s residential architecture as the city’s first neighbourhoods were being planned in the late 19th century.\n\nHow do you spot a Tudor Revival home? Perhaps the biggest giveaway is their decorative half-timbering facades, which mask the exterior walls’ brick construction with dark wood boards atop bright white stucco or stone.\n\nAdditionally, Tudor Revival homes also commonly boast multiple gabled ceilings, leaded glass windows, and angular pitched roofs, and can be found in many historically upper-class Toronto neighbourhoods like Old Mill, Forest Hill, and Rosedale.\n\nThe posts below will be very helpful when buying or selling in Toronto’s West End:\n\nHome Renovations That Add Lasting Value\n\n5 Tips to Make Your Home Irresistible to Young Buyers\n\nWarning Signs a Toronto Real Estate Agent is the Wrong One to Sell Your Home\n\nCraftsman-Style Homes\n\nInspired by the decorative Arts and Crafts movement that flourished across Europe and North America around the turn of the 19th century, Craftsman-style architecture shares many of the same values and pillars of design as the popular aesthetic movement.\n\nJust like the Arts and Crafts movement, Craftsman-style homes were designed in direct response to the overly ornate Victorian-era style, as well as being anti-industrial in nature. Instead, Craftsman-style architecture values ‘honesty in construction,’ and the simplicity and functionality of well-made, hand-crafted residential architecture.\n\nThis countered the seemingly overly elaborate Victorian-era decorative details along with the harsh and brutish industrialist design of structures like large factories and warehouses.\n\nCraftsman-style houses are largely characterized by their unique handmade details and impressive craftsmanship, which are exemplified by their grand front porches, tapered columns, and intricate carpentry on features including interior beams, crown mouldings, and mantelpieces. These types of houses in Toronto are commonly discovered in neighbourhoods like High Park, Swansea, and The Beaches.\n\nHave you got your eye on one particular type of house in Toronto?
