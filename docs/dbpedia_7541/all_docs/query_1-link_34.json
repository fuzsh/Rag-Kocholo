        "text": "03. Neighbourhood Polarization since 1970: Three distinct cities emerge in Toronto\n\nThe City of Toronto is huge: 632 square kilometres (244 square miles). With more than 2.5 million people living in its residential areas, a 20% increase since the early 1970s, the nature of its neighbourhoods has changed over time to reflect significant changes in the demographic characteristics and economic situation of their residents. Thirty-five years is an adequate period to examine the nature of change in neighbourhood characteristics and to identify trends.\n\nMany of the questions asked in the 1971 census are still used in current census forms; therefore it is possible to analyse many aspects of neighbourhood change since that time. Thanks to a research grant from the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council, a data analysis team at the University of Toronto’s Cities Centre (formerly the Centre for Urban and Community Studies) organized census data at the census-tract level for the Toronto CMA between 1971 and 2006. To avoid confusion with dates, note that incomes reported in the 1971 and 2006 censuses represent those of the preceding calendar years (1970 and 2005).\n\nWhat have we found?\n\nOver the course of 35 years, the pattern of who lives where in Toronto on the basis of socio-economic characteristics has changed dramatically. There has been a sharp consolidation of three distinct groupings of neighbourhoods in the city. No matter what important indicator of socio-economic status is used, the results are very similar. In this report we use the starting point in any study of the socio-economic status of individuals — individual income.\n\nUsing the 2001 census tract geography, we started by comparing the average individual income of people 15 years and older in each census tract in 1970 with the average individual income of people 15 years and older in the same census tracts in 2005 (see Map 1 and Table 1 and the note on methods at the end of this report for definitions). To control for inflation between the two years, we divided the average census tract income by the average income of the entire Toronto census metropolitan area (CMA) thereby obtaining a ratio for each year, 1970 and 2005. We did this for every census tract for 1970 and 2005 (as reported in the 1971 and 2006 censuses). Finally, we calculated the percentage increase or decrease in the two ratios.\n\nThree categories are shown in Map 1: (1) in City #1 individual incomes increased by 20% or more; (2) in City #2 incomes increased or decreased by less than 20%, and (3) in City #3 incomes decreased by 20% or more.\n\n(The note on methods at the end of this chapter indicates why we used average individual income instead of other income measures, why we used 2001 census tract boundaries for mapping, how we reconciled changes in the number and spatial definition of tracts over time, how we compared census tract changes over time, and what categories were used to map the percentage increase or decrease in the two ratios.)\n\nMap 1 shows that, instead of a random pattern of neighbourhood change, Toronto’s neighbourhoods have begun to consolidate into three geographic groupings.\n\nNeighbourhoods within which average individual incomes compared to the Toronto CMA average individual income increased by 20% or more between 1970 and 2005, that is, City #1, are shown in blue on Map 1. These neighbourhoods represent 19% of the city (100 census tracts, census 2001 boundaries) and are generally located near the centre of the city and close to the city’s two subway lines. This area includes some of the waterfront, much of the area south of Bloor Street and Danforth Avenue (where gentrification is taking place), and in central Etobicoke,\n\nan area that from the time of its initial development has been an enclave of higher-income people.\n\nThe neighbourhoods that have changed very little, that is, in which the average income of individuals 15 years and over compared to the Toronto CMA average went up or down by less than 20%, have been left white on Map 1. This is City #2.\n\nThis area represents 39% of the city (208 of the 527 census tracts with census 2001 boundaries). For the most part, this group of neighbourhoods is in the middle, located between the other two groups of neighbourhoods.\n\nNeighbourhoods within which average individual incomes decreased by 20% or more between 1970 and 2005 relative to the Toronto average individual income are shown as solid brown on Map 1. This is City #3. These neighbourhoods comprise about 39% of the city’s neighbourhoods (209 census tracts). They are mainly located in the northeast and northwest parts of the city outside the central corridor along Yonge Street and the Yonge Street subway.\n\nThe trends shown on Map 1 are both surprising and disturbing. Surprising, because 35 years is not a long time. Disturbing, because of the clear concentration of wealth and poverty that is emerging.\n\nIn the following section, we use individual maps for 1970 and 2005 (Maps 2 and 3), rather than the summary index of change in Map 1, to further explore the decline in “middleincome” neighbourhoods and the increase in “lower- and higher-income” areas.\n\nMap 1, PDF\n\n© Neighbourhood Change Research Group, Cities Centre, University of Toronto, 2011\n\n06. Characteristics of the three cities in Toronto\n\nIncome is only one defining characteristic of the socioeconomic status of individuals and neighbourhoods. The\n\nthree cities shown in Map 1 also differ on other important characteristics. see table 1\n\nPopulation , , and City #3 contain 17%, 38%, and 43%, respectively, of Toronto’s total population (see Table 1). has had the largest population increase over the 35 years, because many parts of were underdeveloped in 1970. However, in the five years between 2001 and\n\n2006, the population of and declined slightly, while the population of increased, primarily because of new residential condominium development in the central area of the city.\n\nHouseholds households are smaller (2.3 persons per household on average), and there are more one-personhouseholds and fewer two-parent families with children than in the other two cities. has a higher percentage of singleparent families than (23% versus 14%) and also a higher percentage of children and youth (33% versus 26%). Overall, there has been a citywide 35-year decline in the proportion of children and youth under 25 years old as a percentage of the population, from 43% to 29%.\n\nHousing tenure Renters are found in most areas of the city, but are particularly prevalent in , where they account for almost half of all households. Renter households spend much more of their income on housing than owners do. In , for example, 47% of renters and 32% of owners spent more than 30% of household income on housing in 2006. In , the gap is even wider, with 41% of renters and 21% of owners spending more than 30% of household income on housing. is between these two, close to the citywide average.\n\nImmigrants In , the percentage of foreign-born people declined from 35% to 28% between 1971 and 2006, whereas in the number of immigrants increased dramatically over the 35-year period from 31% of the population in 1970 to 61% in 2006. In 2006 is close to the citywide average of 50%.\n\nVisible minorities is mainly white (82%) whereas only 34% of population is white. has very few Black, Chinese, or South Asian people, who are disproportionately found in . Only 11% of compared to 47% of are Black, Chinese or South Asian. In contrast to and , is close to the overall City of Toronto average with respect to visible minority population.\n\nEducation In Toronto as a whole, persons in their twenties and beyond were much more likely to have a university education in 2006 than in 1971. This is especially the case for . In 2006, 61% of residents 25 years and over in had a university certificate, diploma, or degree, compared to 35% and 31% of the same age group in and , respectively. Consequently, the relatively large number of well-educated people in are in a much more favourable position than those in and to compete for high-paying white-collar jobs.\n\nEmployment As in most post-industrial economies, bluecollar employment in The City of Toronto declined substantially between 1971 and 2005, from 28% to 17%. During the same period, white-collar employment increased from 17% to 40% of all occupations. Most of Toronto’s remaining manufacturing\n\njobs are located in , with a few in . Not surprisingly, the residential population of is characterized by more blue-collar employees than . The latter has a largely white-collar population, reflecting its relatively high proportion of university-educated residents.\n\nIncome Map 1 and Table 1 show 35-year income trends. not only has the highest average individual income, but income increased by 99% over the 35 years and by 29% between 2000 and 2005. In , 37% of all households had incomes of $100,000 or more, compared to the citywide average\n\nof 18%. In and , average household income as a proportion of Toronto CMA income declined between 1970 and 2005, with declining the most, by 37%. This shift in income reflects both the lower levels of education among residents of and their lower occupational status. Not only have incomes declined relative to the Toronto CMA in , this area also has the highest proportion of persons in households with incomes below the Low Income Cut-Off (LICO) level.\n\nTravel Residents of , the neighbourhoods with the lowest average income, have to travel farther to find employment, yet they have the poorest access to the Toronto Transit Commission’s subway stations. Only 19 of the system’s 68 subway stations are within or near neighbourhoods.\n\n© Neighbourhood Change Research Group, Cities Centre, University of Toronto, 2011\n\n09. “Reading” maps carefully: The location of Toronto’s lower income neighbourhoods\n\nThe dramatic increase in the number of lower-income neighbourhoods in Toronto has implications for the provision of many government and community services.\n\nMaps are helpful, but can be misleading if what they depict is not fully understood. Map 6, showing the population density of Toronto’s low-income neighbourhoods, is important for people engaged in the planning, funding, and delivery of social and community services.\n\nTo identify the lower-income neighbourhoods in the most recent census, we need to look at Map 3. This map shows the average individual income of each census tract for one year, 2005. It is a map showing high-, middle- and low-income areas of the city. By itself, however, it can be misleading because census tracts are not all the same size geographically, even though the population of each census tract is approximately the same (averaging 4,700 in Toronto).\n\nMap 6 corrects for the mismatch between the different geographic size of census tracts and the fact that census tracts have approximately similar sized populations. It shows only the lower income census tracts on the basis of their population density. Thus, even though most of the neighbourhoods in northeast and northwest Toronto have, on average, low-income populations, much of those areas are lower density — except for the clusters of high-rise residential towers. Areas south of the Danforth and areas west of University Ave. (north and south of Bloor St.) are Toronto’s traditional low-income “inner city” neighbourhoods. They continue to be high-density concentrations of lowerincome people in 2006, even though there is some gentrification occurring in and around those areas.\n\nMap 1 in this report, in contrast, takes two points in time, 1970 and 2005. It maps trends — those neighbourhoods that have been trending upward in average individual income (coloured blue) or trending downward (coloured brown) over those 35 years. This important and dramatic map of trends, however, is not a map of low-income or poverty neighbourhoods. Most but not all of the neighbourhoods trending downward are indeed lower-income. However, many of the neighbourhoods that are not trending up or down (the white areas on Map 1, which is ), are low-income (as Maps 3 and 6 indicate).\n\nIt must be noted that Map 6 is not a perfect representation of the population density of Toronto’s low-income neighbourhoods. This is because the map is based on gross population densities rather than net densities, or in other words persons per square kilometre of total land area rather than residential land area. Gross population densities are calculated by dividing the population of a census tract by the total land area of that tract, while net densities are determined by dividing the population of the tract by its residential area. The difference in methods can give dramatically different results for census tracts with a considerable amount of non-residential land use (e.g. industrial, commercial, airports, open space, farmland). In that case, net densities will be substantially higher than gross densities. Thus, census tracts in the northeast and northwest of Toronto, which are largely non-residential, exhibit much lower densities in Map 6 than they would if net densities had been used. Unfortunately, land use information by census tract is not readily available, so net densities cannot be easily calculated.\n\nMap 6, PDF\n\n© Neighbourhood Change Research Group, Cities Centre, University of Toronto, 2011\n\nIf Nothing Changes: Toronto in 2025\n\nPROJECTION OF THE “THREE CITIES” IN TORONTO TO THE YEAR 2025\n\nMap 1 in this report shows trends in average individual income for Toronto’s neighbourhoods (census tracts) from 1970 to 2005. What happens to the spatial patterns of the “Three Cities” in Map 1 if we project these trends forward in time — say by 20 years, to 2025? Do more neighbourhoods within the City of Toronto show either a downward or upward trend in income relative to the Toronto CMA? Map 7 indicates clearly that this is what would happen under the assumptions outlined below.\n\nProjections are based on certain assumptions about future change. Sometimes these are referred to as “scenarios.” The text in the box shows the assumptions upon which the projection in is based. For (increasing income) and (decreasing income), it is assumed that no census tracts will\n\nleave either group. The question then becomes: what will happen to census tracts in during this 20-year period? Three possibilities for are combined to produce the projection in .\n\nFirst, we assume that census tracts that increased between 5% and 20% in income in the 1970–2005 period will continue to increase relative to the Toronto CMA; they will reach the 20% threshold by 2025, thereby joining . Second, we assume that census tracts that decreased between 5% and 20% will continue to decrease and reach the 20% threshold, thereby becoming part of . Third, we assume that census tracts that increased or decreased less than 5% in income between 1970 and 2005 will remain in .\n\nThe outcome of this scenario is shown on Map 7, with the numerical summary provided below the map. By 2025, if nothing is done to change current trends:\n\n– will include 30% of the city’s census tracts, compared\n\nwith only 19% in 2005;\n\n– will comprise 59% of the city’s census tracts, an\n\nincrease from 40% in 2005;\n\n– will decrease dramatically from 40% of the total in\n\n2005 to 9% in 2025.\n\nThus, the number of census tracts in Cities #1 and #3 will increase substantially at the expense of .\n\nHow do these trends translate into the projected spatial distribution of the “Three Cities”? In comparing and , we see that both Cities #1 and #3 have expanded dramatically at the expense of . now includes almost all of Scarborough, the northern fringe of North York, and almost all of Etobicoke north of Eglinton Avenue, as well as large parts of the former municipalities of York and East York. Most of the isolated census tracts that were part of in 2005 have now joined . These neighbourhoods will increasingly attract newcomers, especially low-income immigrants, who cannot afford housing in the central city or the outer suburbs.\n\nCity #1 has grown to cover most census tracts close to the northsouth and east-west subway lines. By 2025, these census tracts will become increasingly desirable areas of the city, attracting higherincome\n\nresidents who want good access to downtown Toronto by public transportation and the amenities of a central location. With the exception of a few pockets of social housing or lower-cost private rental high-rise units built in the 1960s, the area south of the east-west subway line is now almost entirely part of City #1. This change will have been brought about by two ongoing trends: (1) the creation of more condominium apartments, either newly constructed or carved out of abandoned industrial space, and (2) the continued gentrification of older, low-rise residential neighbourhoods. Both of these types of residential areas attract a higherincome population.\n\nIn the meantime, City #2 has been reduced to a few census tracts, mostly found between Cities #1 and #3. As a result, the “Three Cities” model is approaching a “Two Cities” model, in which neighbourhoods are sharply divided between those in which average individual incomes have increased dramatically over the 1970 to 2025 period and neighbourhoods where the opposite has occurred.\n\nOf course, this is just one scenario based on current trends. It assumes no changes to Cities #1 and #3, and that many census tracts in City #2 will move upwards or downwards to become part of Cities #1 or #3. In other words, it assumes no major policy changes in the next 20 years, especially policies that might lead to a more equal income distribution and a more equitable spatial distribution of an increased supply of affordable housing. This is a reasonable assumption, since neither of these changes is on the immediate horizon.\n\n— Robert A. Murdie, Geography, York University and Neighbourhood Change CURA, Cities Centre, University of Toronto\n\nMap 7, PDF\n\nMap 1, PDF\n\n© Neighbourhood Change Research Group, Cities Centre, University of Toronto, 2011\n\nA Note on Methods\n\nIn any study, questions arise over the methods used and decisions made; we present answers to some of those questions here so that readers can assess the trustworthiness of the findings.\n\nWHY USE INDIVIDUAL INCOME INSTEAD OF EMPLOYMENT INCOME OR HOUSEHOLD INCOME?\n\nThe Canadian census provides data on income in many forms, such as individual, employment, household, and family income, and breaks the data down into different subsets of the population, such as men and women, single parents and two-parent families. We used average rather than median income, because average income is provided by Statistics Canada for the entire 35-year period. In addition, for the purposes of this research, average income is a better measure than median income because it is more sensitive to the presence of very low- or very high-income persons in a census tract.\n\nIndividual income is the census category for income from all sources. Employment income includes only the wage income of individuals, and excludes people on pensions or social assistance and people who receive investment income. We used individual income rather than employment income, because it is more comprehensive (including pension, social assistance, investment and employment income) and includes more people (everybody who reports income and not just those with employment income).\n\nWhen we carried out the analysis using employment income, and were slightly larger (23% and 42% of the 514 census tracts with data) and was smaller (36%) than with individual income.\n\nWe also tested the results using household income. In this analysis, and were slightly smaller (15% and 39% respectively) and was larger (46%) than with individual income. This difference is due to the differences in household size between these areas (see Families & Households section in Table 1).\n\nThere is, in short, no significant difference in the trends, whether we use employment, household, or ndividual income. All census tracts have some households with a few adults employed and some with only one adult. All census tracts have people who are temporarily unemployed or on social assistance or on low etirement incomes or have investment income in addition to their wages. Employment income tends to show slightly more census tracts near the middle if we use the same five income categories. Household income and individual income show very similar patterns for high and middle incomes. There is a slight difference in the results for low and very low incomes. An analysis by household income shows slightly more very low-income census tracts in 2005, whereas that for individual income shows slightly more low-income census tracts.\n\nThere is, therefore, no universal “best way” to measure neighbourhood income change. Furthermore, any factors that might bias the results from any one source of data tend to balance themselves out, given the large population being studied (2.5 million people in the city and an additional 2.6 million in the outer suburbs).\n\nWe also used the CMA average income rather than the City average, because the labour and housing markets of the city and its outer suburbs are connected. Many people living in Toronto earn their income from jobs in the suburban municipalities and vice versa. Also, using the CMA average as our benchmark allows us to compare Toronto neighbourhoods with neighbourhoods in the outer suburbs.\n\nWHAT CENSUS TRACT GEOGRAPHY DID WE USE AND HOW DO WE RECONCILE CHANGES IN THE NUMBER AND SPATIAL DEFINITION OF CENSUS TRACTS OVER TIME?\n\nThe maps in this publication are based on the 2001 census tract geography, the same geography used in Research Bulletin 41 (2007), The Three Cities Within Toronto: Income Polarization among Toronto’s Neighbourhoods, 1970-2000.\n\nAs the City of Toronto increased in population, especially in the suburbs, Statistics Canada divided several 1971 tracts into two or more tracts over the years to 2001. This alteration required some operational decisions on how to handle the 1971 income data. For the 1971 census tracts that were subdivided between 1971 and 2001, we assigned the same average income for 1970 to each of these tracts. That is, if a 1971 census tract was subdivided into two tracts by 2001, each of these tracts was assigned the same income for 1971.\n\nFor the 2006 analysis, incomes for the few tracts that were subdivided between 2001 and 2006 were averaged and assigned to the appropriate 2001 tract.\n\nThis approach introduces a small amount of imprecision to the analysis, particularly in the more recently developed northern parts of the City, but does not affect the overall trends, since most of the City was built up by 1970. The major advantage of our method is the creation of more detailed maps of change patterns, because one-to-one census tract comparisons between 1970 average income and more recent census years are possible. We did not map census tract changes using this method for the “905 region” because much of this area was undeveloped in 1970.\n\nHOW DO WE COMPARE CENSUS TRACT CHANGES OVER TIME?\n\nWe calculated the extent to which the average individual income of people 15 years and older in each census tract in 1970 and in 2005 was above or below the average individual income for the entire Toronto Census Metropolitan Area (CMA). Specifically, we divided the average income for the census tract by the average Toronto CMA income for each year thereby obtaining a ratio for each year, 1970 and 2005. Finally, for each census tract we calculated the percentage increase or decrease in the two ratios.\n\nWe examined the percentage increase or decrease in the 1970 and 2005 income ratios rather than straight dollar-to-dollar comparisons between 1970 and 2000 for two reasons.\n\nFirst, the cost of living in Toronto has increased over time, making a $10,000 income in 1970, for example, worth much more than $10,000 in 2005.\n\nSecond, direct dollar comparisons cannot tell us how far up or down the income ladder a neighbourhood is located and the size of the gap between different income levels. Any income figure is meaningless on its own\n\nunless one has a benchmark that indicates whether it is high, middle, or low.\n\nWe used the average income for the Toronto CMA for an income benchmark because it takes into account the rapid growth in jobs and population in the surrounding outer suburbs — the “905 region” — which now has a slightly larger population than the City. Many people live in the area surrounding the City but earn their income from employers inside the City and vice versa. In other words, the labour market and the housing market are larger than the City of Toronto itself.\n\nWHAT CATEGORIES DO WE USE TO MAP CHANGES IN AVERAGE INDIVIDUAL INCOME?\n\nFor mapping changes in average individual income (Map 1) we divided the percentage increase or decrease in the 1970 and 2005 income ratios into three categories: (1) : an increase of 20% or more, (2) : an increase or decrease of less than 20%, and (3) : a decrease of 20% or more. While these are arbitrary boundaries, we did experiment with finer divisions of the data. Overall, the three-group categorization is a reasonable compromise and a useful public policy tool. In order to explore the trends in , we have also developed a more detailed profile of as a supplement to this publication.\n\n© Neighbourhood Change Research Group, Cities Centre, University of Toronto, 2011\n\nRelated Reports\n\nToronto’s Inner Suburbs: Investing in Social Infrastructure in Scarborough\n\nBy Deborah Cowen and Vanessa Parlette, Cities Centre, University of Toronto, 2011\n\nToronto’s inner suburbs are home to many poor households, including members of many racialized groups. At the same time, social services in the inner suburbs are few and far between. This study looks at one neighbourhood (Kingston-Galloway/Orton Park) in Scarborough, and its social infrastructure. Social infrastructure is not just the social services or programs available to residents of a neighbourhood, but the area’s resources and relationships, such as spaces for gathering, opportunities for learning, as well as partnerships and networks within and beyond the community level. Social infrastructure exists at the local scale, but relies on public policy, capital investment, and social networks that are not necessarily local. This report draws on the insights of residents, community workers, non-profit agencies and public sector staff who are committed to improving everyday life for people in Toronto’s low income communities.\n\nPoverty by Postal Code 2: Vertical Poverty – Declining Income, Housing Quality and Community Life in Toronto’s Inner Suburban High-Rise Apartments\n\nUnited Way Toronto, 2011\n\nVertical Poverty presents new data on the growing concentration of poverty in the City of Toronto and the role that high-rise housing is playing in this trend. The report tracks the continued growth in the spatial concentration of poverty in Toronto neighbourhoods, and in high-rise buildings within neighbourhoods. Its primary focus is on privately-owned buildings in Toronto’s inner suburbs. The geographic concentration of poverty can trigger of wider neighbourhood decline and disinvestment. This can affect the quality of the local businesses, and the condition and upkeep of housing. Understanding the extent to which geographically concentrated poverty and poor housing conditions are linked is critically important for building strong and healthy neighbourhoods in our city.\n\nEvery Place Matters: Investing in Complete Neighbourhoods and Communities\n\nGreater Toronto Civic Action Alliance, 2011\n\nAt their best, neighbourhoods can be inclusive places full of opportunity, activity, and enterprise that respond to the needs of residents. The challenge is to create a Toronto region where integrated, accessible neighbourhoods meet individual needs and aspirations, and realize shared community visions. All members of civil society – community groups, businesses, service agencies and residents – can work together to put in place the key ingredients for strong neighbourhoods including equitable access to an appropriate mix of jobs and appropriate social and physical infrastructure, such as affordable housing, transportation, schools, social services, recreation and open spaces. Responding to this challenge requires, among other things, better leveraging the capacity of civil society to plan, build and participate in communities.\n\nThe Unequal City: Income and Health Inequalities in Toronto\n\nToronto Public Health, 2008\n\nThis report presents new data for the City of Toronto showing a clear link between health and income across the city. Those areas of Toronto that have a greater proportion of people living with low income experience greater risk factors for illness, higher rates of disease, and death at an earlier age. Areas with a smaller proportion of low income – areas that are relatively richer – have better health. These differences are referred to as health inequalities. The report also shows that males in the highest income areas were expected to live 4.5 years longer than males in the lowest income areas. The difference for females was 2.0 years.\n\nWhat’s Wrong with Inequality?\n\nFrank Cunningham, Growing Gap Discussion Papers, Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives, 2007\n\nInequality concerns persisting and widespread disparities among the resources available for people to sustain themselves and their families in secure and healthy ways, to make adequate provision for their old age, to take advantage of amenities beyond bare subsistence, to participate in political or community affairs, to engage in volunteer activities, and to pursue valued long-term goals such as succeeding in their occupations or developing talents (as for artistic enjoyment and creation or engagement in hobbies or sports). The contrast is a social ideal where, as several po­litical philosophers conceive of it, distribution of resources is sufficient for everyone to have realistic a chance of leading a meaningful, satisfying, or happy life.\n\nInclusive, Safe, Healthy Neighbourhoods\n\nUnited Way Toronto, presentation, 2008\n\nThree chains of events that led to the United Way’s neighbourhood focus: socio-political changes in the late 1990s; growing concern for a new deal for solutions; and federal government launch of a pilot project on neighbourhood revitalization. In 2003 the United Way adopted a new strategic plan, Community Matters. It formalized new roles of research, public policy, and community development.\n\nLosing Ground: The Persistent Growth of Family Poverty in Canada’s Largest City\n\nUnited Way of Greater Toronto, 2007\n\nThis report provides important new data about family incomes and family poverty in Toronto, Canada’s largest city. It is a story of lost ground – of a significant gap, which has opened up between the financial well being of families with children in Toronto and their regional, provincial and national counterparts. It is also a cautionary tale – one that points to warning signs that large numbers of vulnerable households are falling into serious financial trouble, evidenced by growing applications for eviction, indebtedness, and insolvency numbers. On every dimension of income examined, Toronto families lost ground, falling behind families in the rest of the country: overall family median incomes were lower, as were median incomes for both two-parent and lone-parent families, and overall family poverty rates were higher.\n\nStrong Neighbourhoods – Supporting the Call to Action\n\nToronto Civic Summit Alliance, Discussion paper, 2007\n\nIncome disparity between the region’s rich and poor families is widening, and incomes at the low end of the scale have stagnated or fallen. Housing costs continue to rise and gentrification is displacing lower income households from neighbourhoods with established services and infrastructure to serve low-income families. Many neighbourhoods are caught in deepening cycles of decline, marked by increased crime, homeowner flight, and changed commercial activity, including growth in fringe lending businesses. The growth in neighbourhood disadvantage is primarily taking place in the inner suburban neighbourhoods.\n\nToronto’s 13 Priority Areas: Research Methodology\n\nHarvey Low, City of Toronto, presentation, 2007\n\nExplains how the “priority areas,” now commonly referred to as priority neighbourhoods, were selected (13 out of Toronto’s 140 defined neighbourhoods; minimum population of 7,000 to 10,000). They were defined by grouping income characteristics in combination with analysis of community infrastructure. Community infrastructure includes general services, such as community centres, libraries, schools and health centres, together with services for specific needs, such as children, youth, senior, newcomer, employment and food services.\n\nThe Role of Community Infrastructure in Building Strong Neighbourhoods\n\nStrong Neighbourhoods Task Force, 2005\n\nCommunity infrastructure is defined as a complex system of facilities, programs, and social networks that aims to improve people’s quality of life. These assets work in tandem to form the foundation of a strong neighbourhood. Municipalities developing ‘strong’ infrastructure will integrate physical and social planning and development and will invest adequately in both. In contrast, ‘weak’ infrastructure will indicate a continuing separation of the physical and social requirements of the city. Thus, for a strong infrastructure to exist in a locality it is critical that there is adequate investment in both physical and social types of infrastructure.\n\nMeasuring Neighbourhood Vitality\n\nStrong Neighbourhoods Task Force, Toronto, 2005\n\nThe report provides a review of international, national and local practice in the use of indicator systems at the neighbourhood level. It outlines the final set of domains and indicators chosen for analyzing Toronto’s neighbourhoods. It looks at neighbourhood vitality in Toronto by deploying the tool in 140 Toronto neighbourhoods. The central conclusion of this study is that Toronto is behind comparable cities in terms of developing a neighbourhood indicator system. While there have been some positive and indeed central developments (such as the definition of 140 neighbourhoods thereby establishing the geography for analysis and response), Toronto lags in this area.\n\nPoverty by Postal Code: The Geography of Neighbourhood Poverty, City of Toronto, 1981 – 2001\n\nUnited Way of Greater Toronto and the Canadian Council On Social Development, 2004\n\nPoverty by Postal Code is a study of the spatial concentration of family poverty in the City of Toronto over two decades. The findings are deeply disturbing. In the twenty years prior to 2001, most ‘poor’ families in Toronto lived in mixed-income neighbourhoods. Today, they are far more concentrated in neighbourhoods with high levels of poverty. The increase in the number of higher poverty neighbourhoods in has been rapid. The growing spatial concentration of poverty has impacted certain vulnerable groups much more acutely than others. Falling median incomes, widening income gaps between rich and poor, and rising poverty levels are having a profound effect on the spatial distribution of poverty in Toronto.\n\nWhy Strong Neighbourhoods Matter: Implications For Policy And Practice\n\nStrong Neighbourhoods Task Force, City of Toronto and United Way Toronto, 2004\n\nThe revival of interest in neighbourhoods is part of a re-assertion that ‘place matters’, to the well-being of individuals and to the health and prosperity of the broader community. The major reasons: concern about growing neighbourhood concentrations of poverty and disadvantage and their effects on individuals and the broader community; increasing recognition that cities and urban regions are socially, environmentally, and economically critical to the well-being of individuals, regions and countries; and the ‘discovery’ of social capital and its potential as a building block for social cohesion and to finding local solutions to problems. There are three inter-connected defining characteristics of a “strong neighbourhood”: those related to social relationships (e.g. community involvement, mutual responsibility); those related to ‘place’ (e.g. active street life); and those related to both (e.g. safety). This paper defines strong neighbourhoods as inclusive, vibrant, cohesive, and safe.\n\nNeighbourhoods Matter\n\nIdeas That Matter, special issue on neighbourhoods, Vol. 3(2), 2004\n\nThis issue of Ideas that Matter provides our readers with a glimpse of a remarkable community in transition. Last year Ideas that Matter was engaged by the Toronto Community Housing Corporation (one of North America’s largest public housing landlords) to convene a broad-based city-wide forum on the ‘revitalization’ process of one of their largest holdings, the community of Regent Park.\n\nMetro Suburbs in Transition: Evolution and Overview, Background Report 1979\n\nSocial Planning Council, 1979\n\nThe era of suburban and metropolitan innocence in Toronto is over. The social development patterns reviewed in this report suggest that important social transformations have taken place in the post-war suburbs of Metro. This background report consists of review and analysis, providing a more comprehensive framework for understanding important trends and patterns in the social development of Metro’s newer suburbs. It introduces a set of issues and concerns. The newer suburbs now contain 50% of all inner city students in Metro’s schools, most of Metro’s families with both parents in the labour force, high numbers of single parent families, significant groups of unemployed and alienated youth, and a multitude of cultures and races.\n\nPlanning Agenda for the Eighties: Metro Suburbs in Transition, Policy Report, 1980\n\nSocial Planning Council, 1980\n\nThis report contains policy, planning, and service recommendations arising from the 1979 Part 1 background report and from subsequent feedback and consultations. The Social Planning Council is calling for dramatic shifts in public priorities and planning to re-build Metro’s suburbs for what they were originally intended to be, a place for family living. The absence of urgently needed help for the diverse needs of suburban families is a deep source of concern. Severe spending cutbacks by the Ontario government have delayed the introduction of needed programs for the changing population. The report calls for government to assume once more a leadership role to address economic and social needs, and thereby reverse the passivity and drift of the seventies. What is called for are climates for renewed growth in Metro, responsible public spending policies, new planning capabilities, recognition of adaptation priorities, sensitivity to special needs, and a representative municipal electoral structure.\n\n© Neighbourhood Change Research Group, Cities Centre, University of Toronto, 2011"
