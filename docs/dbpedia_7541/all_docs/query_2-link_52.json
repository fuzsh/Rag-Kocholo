        "text": "About the Competition\n\nBackground\n\nThis year marks the 18th annual edition for our Greater Toronto's Top Employers competition, which has become the benchmark in the Greater Toronto Area for workplace best-practices. Like the metropolitan area it represents, the competition has become exceptionally strong and competitive — so much so that, for Toronto-area employers, the minimum scores to secure a place on the GTA list routinely rank among the highest in the nation. Our 2024 winners were announced on December 5, 2023 in a special magazine distributed with The Globe and Mail. For more background on this year's competition, read the press release issued on the announcement date.\n\nInterac Corp. offers employees up to 20 personal development hours each year for development goals, such as mentoring, coaching, volunteering, or formal academic programs.\n\nSelection Process\n\nEach year, the winners are evaluated on the same eight criteria as our national competition: (1) workplace; (2) work atmosphere and social; (3) health, financial and family benefits; (4) vacation and time-off; (5) employee communications; (6) performance management; (7) training and skills development; and (8) community involvement.\n\nThe stunning Circle of Indigenous Knowledge medallion at Seneca Polytechnic, designed by Anishinaabe artist Joseph Sagaj, pays tribute to Indigenous culture.

For our detailed reasons for selection, please review the full list of winners below. Publishing detailed reasons for selection is a distinguishing feature of our competition: it provides transparency in the selection of winners and \"raises the bar\" so that other employers can discover and adopt initiatives that work well elsewhere.\n\nAn employee at Durham College in Oshawa shows off her festive spirit at its annual 'Turkey on a Bun' celebration.\n\nEligibility Requirements\n\nAny employer with its head office or principal place of business in the Greater Toronto Area may apply for this competition. Employers of any size may apply, whether private or public sector.\n\n2025 Competition\n\nApplications for our 2025 competition will be available early in 2024. Our 2025 winners will be announced in December 2024. Join our mailing list to stay up to date and receive an application for next year's competition.\n\nSome of the bigger employers, such as banks and large corporations, have re-designed entire buildings to be interconnected vertical campuses, with multiple adaptable spaces for working, collaboration, well-being and socializing, both in-side and out. For instance, Manulife Canada recently transformed its global headquarters in Toronto to a flexible, state-of-the-art environment, where workers onsite can organically connect with others working remotely.\n\nInfluenced by feedback from employees who expressed what helped them during the pandemic, the refreshed space incorporates movement, natural light and plants into the design. But what the company also found was that people were really concerned about having collaborative space to reconnect, so purpose-built spaces for small, medium and large connections became a top priority. Notably, food is central to that, with a barista in its newly renovated lobby and a 21,000 square-foot subsidized cafeteria.\n\nSome top employers, such as Vena Solutions Inc., have completely changed their work model since the pandemic. Prior to COVID, chief people officer Tracey Mikita says that the tech company was basically an in-office workplace, but now lets the vast majority of employees choose their ideal work environment, with flexible arrangements that include hybrid, fully remote or on-site.\n\n\"We continue to have really solid business results, so it's hard to justify pushing folks back to the office when people are engaged and lots of great work is getting done,\" says Mikita. \"We've really tried to move the office towards being less of a place where you just go to do your work, to more of a collaborative social space where teams have their meetings.\n\n\"I think there was always this worry that engagement would plummet if we moved to a remote or hybrid culture, but I would say culturally, we've proven that wrong. Our engagement scores have been at all-time highs through the pandemic and people are feeling good across the board. We just worked really hard to enhance communication and make the employee experience a priority.\"\n\nVena goes further offering a very unique short-term work relocation allowance that lets employees work up to 30 days per year almost anywhere in the world.\n\n\"We're a tech company so you're very mobile,\" says Mikita. \"You can pick up your laptop and use any of the great spaces throughout our facility or you can work from home, but people can also spend time working wherever they like. So if someone is planning a vacation in Florida, they're free to tack on a week of work and enjoy that work-life balance we feel is so important.\"\n\nWhen meeting in-person matters, even limited real estate doesn't stop top employers. Anna Filice, chief people officer, at Ontario's Workplace Safety and Insurance Board / WSIB, says while people work at home most of the time, when they do come in, it's with purpose.\n\n\"We try to do that at least once per month -- usually an event with the whole team coming together,\" says Filice. \"Some of our locations don't actually have a physical space, so we'll meet at a local convention centre and spend a few purposeful hours together. Because we're so deliberate about it, we're actually spending more meaningful time with our teams than when we were heads down in a cubicle five days a week.\"\n\nFilice says that they're always cognizant that people are working from home and do their best to ensure employees have the tools they need to do that safely and effectively, including supports developed to help managers lead in a virtual environment. A recent assessment by WSIB of some of its key workforce factors -- three years before the pandemic, and then three years after the switch to remote work -- shows positive movement in basically every area for key services. These include productivity measures and employee statistics in terms of the number of sick days, engagement scores and overall collaboration.\n\n\"Everyone's very enthusiastic about it,\" she says. \"People have been very vocal that they'd like to retain this model.\""
