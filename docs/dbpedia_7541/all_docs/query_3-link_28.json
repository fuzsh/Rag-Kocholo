The company’s land and buildings, which are all unencumbered, are valued at $236 million on its balance sheet, and the shares do not reflect that value, he said.\n\nThe company said it expects to complete a secondary plan with the City of Toronto for the 40 acres of land in mid 2025. The first phase of development will focus on construction of a new flagship retail store and corporate headquarters on the site and subsequent phases will focus on 4,000 homes including townhouses, mid- and high-rise buildings and community spaces.\n\n“With this particular site … we believe that we can build 4.6 million square feet of gross floor area,” Walsh said. “And so how you maximize that is through residential, high-rise, low-rise, rental units, townhomes. And so each property is different, but when you want to optimize and intensify land, it’s a mix of a whole bunch of different things.”\n\nRecommended from Editorial\n\nToronto office tower goes up for sale in sign of market thaw\n\nHousing market has turned a corner, Royal LePage says\n\nToronto's new mall could foretell retail's future\n\nAdvertisement 4\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nWalsh said the company is looking forward to commencing public consultation for the land development after receiving government approval.\n\nIn May last year, Leon’s announced its intention to create a real estate investment trust (REIT) for its wholly-owned real estate portfolio, subject to prevailing market conditions and receipt of required regulatory approvals, including approval to list the units on the Toronto Stock Exchange.\n\n• Email: dpaglinawan@postmedia.com\n\nBookmark our website and support our journalism: Don’t miss the business news you need to know — add financialpost.com to your bookmarks and sign up for our newsletters here.\n\nArticle content\n\nShare this article in your social network"
