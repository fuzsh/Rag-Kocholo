        "text": "Over two-thirds of Ontarians live in the 25 most populous census subdivisions\n\nThere are 575 Census Subdivisions (CSDs) in Ontario. These geographical areas correspond to municipalities, Indian reserves or unorganized territories treated as municipal equivalents.\n\nAccording to the 2016 Census, 67.8% of Ontario’s population lives in the province’s 25 most populous Census Subdivisions.\n\nThe 25 largest CSDs in Ontario as a group grew 5.2% between 2011 and 2016, accounting for 76.0% of total provincial growth over this period.\n\nFive of the 10 most populous CSDs are located in the Greater Toronto Area (Toronto, Mississauga, Brampton, Markham and Vaughan). Combined, these five GTA CSDs are home to 34.8% of Ontario’s population and accounted for 40% of provincial growth between 2011 and 2016.\n\nCompleting the top 10 are the CSDs of Ottawa, Hamilton, London, Kitchener and Windsor.\n\nOne in five Ontarians live in the city of Toronto\n\nThe Toronto CSD remains the most populous in the province, and is home to one in five Ontarians. The municipality recorded growth of 4.5% between the 2011 and 2016 Censuses, accounting for 19.5% of provincial population growth, the most of any CSD.\n\nThe second-largest CSD is Ottawa. The city grew 5.8% over the 2011-16 period and accounted for 8.5% of Ontario’s population growth.\n\nMississauga is the third-largest CSD. The city grew 1.1% from 2011 to 2016 and accounted for 1.4% of total population growth in the province.\n\nBrampton, the fourth-largest CSD in Ontario, grew by 13.3% and accounted for 11.7% of all growth in the province over this period, the second largest growth contributor after Toronto.\n\nMore than half of Ontario’s CSDs are growing\n\nBetween 2011 and 2016, 335 of Ontario’s 575 CSDs experienced population growth, while 195 saw population decline. Population was unchanged in 21 CSDs, and 24 were not enumerated in either 2011 or 2016 (mostly Indian reserves).\n\nNote: Only CSDs that were enumerated in both 2011 and 2016 are included in the growth calculations.\n\nCSDs with population of more than 25,000footnote 1[1]\n\nThere were 64 Ontario CSDs with population greater than 25,000 in both 2011 and 2016. As a group, CSDs of this size grew 5.0% over the 2011-16 period, faster than the provincial average. In 2016, they accounted for 83% of the provincial population.\n\nMilton had by far the highest growth rate (30.5%), followed by Bradford West Gwillimbury (25.8%) and Whitchurch-Stouffville (21.8%).\n\nEight CSDs within this group experienced population decline between 2011 and 2016, including North Bay (-3.9%), Timmins (-3.2%), Leamington(-2.8%), Sault Ste. Marie (-2.4%), Prince Edward County (-2.1%), Chatham Kent (-2.0%), Sarnia (-1.1%) and Thunder Bay (-0.4%).\n\nCSDs with population between 10,000 and 24,999\n\nCSDs with population of 10,000 to 24,999 grew 3.9% as a group between 2011 and 2016. There were 79 CSDs in this category in 2011 and 83 in 2016, accounting for 9.6% of the provincial population.\n\nWithin this group, 63 CSDs experienced population growth and 16 saw declines.\n\nKing had by far the highest growth rate (23.2%) within this group, followed by Wasaga Beach (17.9%) and Essa (13.9%).\n\nThe largest declines occurred in Elliot Lake (-5.3%), Temiskaming Shores (-4.6%) and Pembroke (-3.3%).\n\nCSDs with population of less than 10,000\n\nThe vast majority of Ontario CSDs have population of less than 10,000 (420 out of 575 in 2016), accounting for 7.4% of total provincial population.\n\nEnumeration issues on Indian reserves and very sparsely populated areas affect the reliability of Census count comparisons for this group.\n\nNote\n\nThe most appropriate 2016 population figures for Ontario and the rest of Canada are the current postcensal population estimates rather than the 2016 Census counts. See Fact Sheet 1 for notes on Census counts and net undercoverage and the reason why this fact sheet looks largely at shares and growth rates between the 2011 and 2016 Censuses rather than population levels.\n\nAccessible image descriptions\n\nOntario’s 25 most populous CSDs: share of provincial population, 2016 census\n\nThis chart shows the share of Ontario’s population accounted for by the 25 most populous census subdivisions according to the 2016 Census. Toronto accounted for 20.3% of the provincial population, Ottawa for 6.9%, and Mississauga for 5.4%.\n\nReturn to image\n\nTop 25 Ontario CSDs by share of provincial growth, 2011 to 2016\n\nThis chart shows the share of total provincial growth accounted for by the 25 most populous census subdivisions in Ontario over the 2011-2016 period. Toronto accounted for 19.5% of total provincial growth over the period, Brampton for 11.7%, and Ottawa for 8.5%.\n\nReturn to image\n\n10 Fastest-growing large CSDs (with 2011 population of 25,000 and over)\n\nThis chart shows the 2011-2016 growth rates of the 10 fastest-growing census subdivisions in Ontario that had a population of 25,000 and over in 2011.

King grew fastest at 23.2%, followed by Wasaga Beach at 17.9% and Essa at 13.9%."
