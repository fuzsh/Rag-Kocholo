It corrects the French name of Newfoundland and Labrador by inserting a missing hyphen.\n\nThe name of Newfoundland changed to \"Newfoundland and Labrador\" (\"Terre-Neuve-et-Labrador\" in French) on 2001-12-06. This is reflected in Change Notice 8 to FIPS PUB 10-4, dated 2002-06-28, and in ISO 3166-2 Newsletter I-2 (2002-05-21). Subsequently the province's postal designator was changed from NF to NL. ISO 3166-2 Newsletter number I-4, dated 2002-12-10, made the corresponding change to the ISO code. The name \"Yukon Territory\" was changed to \"Yukon\" in the ISO standard on 2014-10-29.\n\nNunavut split from Northwest Territories on 1999-04-01. This is reflected in Change Notice 3 to FIPS PUB 10-4, dated 1999-05-17, which added Nunavut, and assigned new codes to it and to Northwest Territories. Update I-1 to ISO 3166-2 (2000-06-21) added Nunavut, with NU as its code.\n\nCountry overview:\n\nShort nameCANADA ISO codeCA FIPS codeCA LanguagesEnglish (en), French (fr) Time zoneZones CapitalOttawa, Ontario\n\nCanada became a self-governing dominion in 1867. In 1926, an Imperial Conference clarified that the dominions were autonomous communities within the British Empire, equal in status to Great Britain. The formal name \"Dominion of Canada\" was phased out from the 1950s to 1982, in favor of simply \"Canada\". The British Commonwealth of Nations was formally inaugurated on 1931-12-11, with Canada and Newfoundland as members. The Parliament of the United Kingdom retained the power to approve or reject some amendments to the Canadian Constitution until 1982.\n\nCanada began with four provinces in 1867. There have been territorial acquisitions since then, but only one during the 20th century: Newfoundland, in 1949.\n\nOther names of country:\n\nDanish: Canada\n\nDutch: Canada\n\nFinnish: Kanada\n\nFrench: Canada m\n\nGerman: Kanada n\n\nIcelandic: Kanada\n\nItalian: Canada m\n\nNorwegian: Canada\n\nPortuguese: Canadá m\n\nRussian: Канада\n\nSpanish: Canadá m\n\nSwedish: Canada, Kanada\n\nTurkish: Kanada\n\nOrigin of name:\n\nnative word kanata: settlements; named by Jacques Cartier in 1536\n\nPrimary subdivisions:\n\nCanada is divided into ten provinces and three territories (French: territoires).\n\nDivisionHASCISOFIPSSGCMARCTypePostConv-EConv-FZonePopulationArea(km.²)Area(mi.²)Capital AlbertaCA.ABABCA0148abcpTAlta.Alb.-7:00~3,645,257661,848255,541Edmonton British ColumbiaCA.BCBCCA0259bccpVB.C.C.-B.-8:00~4,400,057944,735364,764Victoria ManitobaCA.MBMBCA0346mbcpRMan.Man.-6:00~1,208,268647,797250,116Winnipeg New BrunswickCA.NBNBCA0413nkcpEN.B.N.-B.-4:00~751,17172,90828,150Fredericton Newfoundland and LabradorCA.NFNLCA0510nfcpANfld.T.-N.-3:30~514,536405,212156,453Saint John's Northwest TerritoriesCA.NTNTCA1361ntctXN.W.T.T.N.-O.-7:00~41,4621,346,106519,734Yellowknife Nova ScotiaCA.NSNSCA0712nscpBN.S.N.-É.-4:00~921,72755,28421,345Halifax NunavutCA.NUNUCA1462nuctX-5:00~31,9062,093,190808,185Iqaluit OntarioCA.ONONCA0835oncpKLMNPOnt.Ont.-5:00~12,851,8211,076,395415,598Toronto Prince Edward IslandCA.PEPECA0911picpCP.E.I.Î-P.-É.-4:00~140,2045,6602,185Charlottetown QuebecCA.QCQCCA1024qucpGHJQue.Qué.-5:00~7,903,0011,542,056595,391Quebec SaskatchewanCA.SKSKCA1147sncpSSask.Sask.-6:001,033,381651,036251,366Regina YukonCA.YTYTCA1260ykctYY.T.Yn.-8:00~33,897482,443186,272Whitehorse 13 divisions33,476,6889,984,6703,855,103\n\nHASC: Hierarchical administrative subdivision codes.\n\nISO: codes from ISO 3166-2.

The eastern provinces tend to be divided into counties; the western provinces, sections, divisions, or districts; and Yukon is only subdivided for electoral or census purposes. Prince Edward Island appears to have been subdivided into Prince, Queens, and Kings Counties for as long as it has been a province. Northwest Territory had been subdivided into the districts of Franklin, Keewatin, and Mackenzie since 1912, although their borders had been somewhat modified; then, about 1980, it was changed to five districts (Baffin, Fort Smith, Inuvik, Keewatin, and Kitikmeot).\n\nOther provinces are more complex. The units of local government include cantons, cities, community councils, counties, districts, divisions, muncipalities, parishes, sections, towns, and villages. There are sub-varieties, including county regional municipalities, district municipalities, metropolitan municipalities, and municipal townships. Many provinces have more than one level of subdivision. Most of them have changed their subdivisions several times. (See source [10].)\n\nTerritorial extent:\n\nBritish Columbia is separated from Alaska by an indefinite boundary in coastal waters. It contains the Queen Charlotte Islands and Dundas Island, but not Dall Island, Prince of Wales Island, or Sitklan Island. The boundary with Washington follows the Strait of Juan de Fuca between Vancouver Island and the Olympic Peninsula, then turns north between Canada's Sidney Island, South Pender Island, and Saturna Island, and the United States's San Juan Island, Stuart Island, and Waldron Island, until it meets the longitude of 49° N.\n\nNew Brunswick is divided from Maine by a line that runs down the Saint Croix River and passes between Deer Island, Campobello Island, Grand Manan Island, and adjacent islets on the Canadian side, across from West Quoddy Head, the easternmost point in the United States.\n\nNewfoundland and Labrador consists of the large island of Newfoundland, a large mainland area on the northeast coast (Labrador), and adjacent islands. Labrador has sometimes been abbreviated LB as if it were a province name.\n\nNorthwest Territories includes the Canadian Arctic islands north of 70° N. and between 110° and 136° W. (to a first approximation; for a more accurate description of the boundary with Nunavut, see for example this page ). The largest Arctic islands totally within Northwest Territories are Banks Island and Prince Patrick Island. Northwest Territories also includes large parts of Victoria Island and Melville Island.\n\nNova Scotia includes Sable Island in the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nNunavut includes all Canadian islands in Hudson Bay, James Bay, the Hudson Strait, Ungava Bay, and the Arctic Ocean between the eastern border of Northwest Territories and the northern tip of Labrador (see source [3]). The border between Labrador and Nunavut runs along Killiniq Island. The division between Nunavut and Greenland follows the Robeson Channel, Kennedy Channel, Kane Basin, Baffin Bay, Davis Strait, and Labrador Bay.\n\nOntario includes Main Duck Island in Lake Ontario, and Pelee Island in Lake Erie. Middle Island, an islet lying off Pelee Island, is the southernmost point of land in Canada. Ontario also includes Manitoulin Island, between Lake Huron and Georgian Bay, the largest lake island in the world. In Lake Superior, Caribou Island belongs to Ontario.\n\nQuebec includes Anticosti Island and the Îles de la Madeleine (Magdalen Islands) in the Gulf of Saint Lawrence.\n\nYukon includes Herschel Island in the Arctic Ocean.\n\nFour provinces or territories meet at approximately 60° N., 102° W.: Manitoba, Northwest Territories, Nunavut, and Saskatchewan.\n\nThe UN LOCODE page for Canada lists locations in the country, some of them with their latitudes and longitudes, some with their ISO 3166-2 codes for their subdivisions. This information can be put together to approximate the territorial extent of subdivisions.\n\nOrigins of names:\n\nAlberta: Named for Princess Louise Caroline Alberta, wife of the then-Governor General of Canada and daughter of Queen Victoria of England.\n\nBritish Columbia: British possession, on the Columbia River, named by Capt. Robert Gray for his vessel Columbia, in turn named for Cristopher Columbus.\n\nLabrador: Portuguese lavrador: laborer, farmer.

From native word, possibly onittariio: beautiful lake.\n\nPrince Edward Island: Named for Prince Edward, Duke of Kent, father of Queen Victoria of England.\n\nQuebec: From the Algonquian word for narrow passage, referring to the Saint Lawrence River at Cape Diamond.\n\nSaskatchewan: Named for the Saskatchewan River.

From native name Yu-kun-ah: great river.\n\nChange history:\n\nAround 1754, the lands which now form Canada were divided between France and Great Britain.

Formerly, the region had been administered from Ottawa.\n\n~1993: The Canada Post designator for Quebec was PQ, for \"Province du Québec\", until it was changed to the current QC. The exact date of the change calls for further research.\n\n1999-04-01: Nunavut territory split from Northwest Territories (former FIPS code CA06).
