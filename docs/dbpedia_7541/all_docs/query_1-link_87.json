On an annual basis, the GTA’s average home price is down 1.1%.\n\nThe median home price, often considered a more transparent indicator of market trends, was $950,000 in July 2024. This is a 4.0% decrease month-over-month. The GTA’s median home price is down 2.5% year-over-year.\n\nAccording to the Toronto Regional Real Estate Board (TRREB), 23,877 homes were listed for sale at the end of July 2024, a 55% increase from the same month last year. This marks the highest number of active listings in 14 years since June 2010, when there were 23,923 listings. Meanwhile, 16,296 new listings were added in July 2024, up 18.8% from the same period in the previous year.\n\nGTA home sales for July 2024 experienced a 13.2% decrease relative to the previous month, yet an increase of 2.7% year-over-year, culminating in 5,391 homes sold in July 2024. The month’s sales-to-new-listings ratio (SNLR) dipped to 33%, down further into buyer’s market territory from 35% last month. This downward movement indicates that demand is growing slower than the supply of available homes for sale, slightly tipping the balance in favour of buyers. The City of Toronto’s SNLR for July 2024 was also 33%.\n\nA 0.25% rate cut by the Bank of Canada in both June and July 2024, the first rate cuts in over four years, brought some hope that the housing market may see a price boost as buyers return from the sidelines. However, TRREB polling in June 2024 found that rate cuts totalling at least 1.00% would be needed before a significant number of buyers would return to the market. Further projected interest rate cuts in 2024 may bring a cumulative 1.25% cut by the end of the year.\n\nRegional Comparison\n\nCity of Toronto\n\nThe City of Toronto is still seeing a year-over-year increase in its average home price, a rare case amid a sea of red across the Greater Toronto Area. For July 2024, the City of Toronto’s average home price was $1,087,436, up by 2.0% year-over-year. However, the City of Toronto’s average home price is down quite a significant 7.4% monthly.\n\nThe median Toronto home price has decreased 5.4% month-over-month to $880,000 but is still 1.6% higher year-over-year. Meanwhile, the City of Toronto’s benchmark home price was $1,082,500, down 4.2% year-over-year.\n\nBrampton\n\nBrampton's housing market shows a slightly weaker performance. The average price decreased 4.0% year-over-year to $1,010,044, and the benchmark price fell by 7.5% year-over-year to $996,900.\n\nMississauga\n\nMississauga home prices have fared slightly better than Brampton, with a smaller 1.4% decrease from the previous year to an average price of $1,042,868. Meanwhile, Mississauga’s benchmark price of $1,037,500 is down 6.0% year-over-year.\n\nOshawa\n\nThe average price in Oshawa’s housing market declined 6.4% year-over-year to $776,241, while Oshawa’s benchmark price is down 5.2% year-over-year to $835,400.\n\nProperty Types\n\nAmong property types in the GTA for July 2024:\n\nThe average price of detached homes has decreased by 3.7% from the previous month and 0.1% from last year to $1,425,927.\n\nThe average price of semi-detached homes decreased 3.2% month over month and 3.1% year over year to $1,067,576.\n\nThe average price of freehold townhomes decreased 0.3% month over month and 1.3% year over year to $1,018,731.\n\nThe average price of condo apartments decreased 1.3% from the previous month to $718,698, which is 2.2% lower than a year ago.\n\nSales Data\n\nThe Greater Toronto Area (GTA) had 5,391 sales overall, experiencing a decrease in monthly sales but remaining higher year-over-year compared to July 2023. This trend is consistent across various cities:\n\nThe City of Toronto’s 1,987 sales saw an 11.1% month-over-month decrease and a 5.4% year-over-year increase.\n\nBrampton’s 390 sales in July 2024 is a 20.2% monthly decrease and a 7.4% annual increase.\n\nMississauga’s 479 home sales is a 13.2% monthly decrease and a 3.0% annual increase.\n\nLooking Forward\n\nIncreasing inventory levels in Toronto's housing market have had significant implications for buyers and sellers. Although sales are up year-over-year, they still haven’t grown as much as new listings have. For buyers, higher inventory levels can lead to more options and potentially more negotiating power, as the increased supply may drive down prices. A buyer's market, which Toronto’s housing market is currently in, can create opportunities for individuals looking to enter the housing market or upgrade their current living situation.\n\nOn the other hand, for sellers, rising inventory can result in longer times on the market and potentially lower sale prices, necessitating more competitive pricing and additional incentives to attract buyers.\n\nThe average property's days on the market rose to 36 in July 2024, up from 24 in July 2023. This month, the average sales price to listing price ratio was 99%, meaning the average home sold for less than its asking price. That’s the first time that this ratio has slipped below 100% since January 2024.\n\nGlossary and Definitions\n\nMLS® HPI: The MLS® Home Price Index (HPI) is an index by the Canadian Real Estate Association (CREA) that tracks the prices of homes in a neighborhood. It allows Canadians to quickly compare home prices across Canada and between periods of time without having to account for specific features of a property. Unlike market prices, which can fluctuate from month to month based on seasonal dynamics, the HPI provides a stable view tracks trends across a longer period of time. The HPI is reviewed every year in May to adjust for changes in the real estate marketplace.\n\nMLS® HPI Benchmark Price: The MLS® Home Price Index (HPI) Benchmark Price is the HPI translated into a real-world price number.\n\nStrata Insurance: Strata insurance is insurance used by a strata like a condominium to covers damages to common areas and assets and liability to the strata. It can also include fixtures built or installed as part of the original construction of each unit, even though these may not be common structures. The insurance can cover:\n\nBuildings and structures associated with the strata including common areas such as the roof, parking garages, driveways, gyms, pools, etc.\n\nLiability for any property damage or bodily injury suffered on strata property\n\nAny fixtures that are part of the \"standard unit\" or original construction of each unit\n\nStrata insurance does not usually include personal items and appliances that are part of a condo unit. It also does not cover the damages made by individual unit owners, such as in the case of water damage caused by a unit owner. These are usually covered by personal condo insurance.\n\nProperty types\n\nDetached home: A detached home is your standard single-family home. It is a residential building that stands alone and is separately titled or legally a single unit.\n\nSemi-detached home: A semi-detached home is similar to a detached home, except it shares a wall with another home. This pair of homes must make up an independent building and each should be separately titled or legally two separate units. There can only be two homes in a semi-detached building.\n\nTownhouses: A townhouse is the middle between a detached/semi-detached home and a condo apartment. Like detached and semi-detached homes, they are often single-family units that have their own land and may be attached to other units. However, like condo apartments, they typically have to pay co-ownership fees for maintenance and may share some common features with their neighbors.\n\nCondo apartment: This category includes all apartments and condominiums. These are complexes of residential units with common areas such as hallways, parking lots, stairwells, etc. They can be low-rise, mid-rise, or high-rise buildings. Unlike townhouses, there are no parts of the lot (the land of the building) where access is reserved for only one owner or occupant. There can be privately owned units and spaces inside the building.\n\nPlexes are multi-story buildings with two to four individual units, usually one on each floor. They are a mainstay in Montreal and other cities in Quebec. Each unit is usually individually accessible via an external entrance with higher floors connected by staircases.\n\nProperty Classes\n\nFreeholds: A freehold is any property where the owner owns both the house and the land it is built on. Common freehold property types include: detached, semi-detached, some townhouses, and farmland.\n\nCondominiums: A condominium or condo is any property where the owner owns the home (or unit) but shares ownership of the land and other improvements with a condominium corporation. Common condominium property types include condo apartments and some townhouses.\n\nLeasehold: Leasehold describes the situation where different entities own the land and the structure built on the land. Owner of the buildings has leased the land and pay rent to their landlord while owning the building on the land."
