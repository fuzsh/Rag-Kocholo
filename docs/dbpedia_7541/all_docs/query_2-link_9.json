Our staff, students and faculty are passionate about building a more innovative, just and sustainable world.\n\nWe recognize that many Indigenous Nations have longstanding relationships with the territories upon which York University campuses are located that precede the establishment of York University. York University acknowledges its presence on the traditional territory of many Indigenous Nations. The area known as Tkaronto [Tig-ar-on-toe] has been care taken by the Anishinabek [Nish-na-bek] Nation, the Haudenosaunee [Ho-dee-no-sho-nee] Confederacy, and the Huron-Wendat. It is now home to many First Nation, Inuit and Métis communities. We acknowledge the current treaty holders, the Mississaugas of the Credit First Nation. This territory is subject of the Dish with One Spoon Wampum Belt Covenant, an agreement to peaceably share and care for the Great Lakes region."
