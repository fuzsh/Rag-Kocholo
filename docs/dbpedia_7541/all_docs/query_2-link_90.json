        "text": "York University Heights is part of the University of Toronto surrounded by York University. York University Heights is a densely populated neighbourhood that consists of a number of distinct areas. It is home to students at York University, and it is also a major shopping destination. The area has a number of unique characteristics that make it a great place to live. This article will highlight some of the most important things you need to know about living in York University Heights.\n\nMan with a Wrench loves University Heights Toronto\n\nOne of the most appealing aspects of living in York University Heights is the fact that it is surrounded by York University. The proximity of all this, coupled with the fact that you are only a short drive from Toronto, makes York University Heights a great place to call home.\n\nYork University Heights Toronto History\n\nThe area of York University Heights was once part of the rolling acres of farmland that covered much of the core of present-day Toronto. The University of Toronto was established in 1827, and it was the first university in Canada. The area that is now York University Heights was originally called York University, in honour of the university. York University Heights is where the university is located today.\n\nWhen was York University Heights Toronto constructed?\n\nThe Village at York University is a new-home development spearheaded by York University. It features condominiums, townhouses, semi-detached and detached homes. The first residents moved into the first phase in 2005 when the first 550 homes were built. After that a second phase, which started construction in 2007, added about 300 more homes but includes no new townhouses.\n\nToronto is naturally rich in natural resources, and there was potential for agriculture. In the late 1800s, a man by the name of Henry Dunant came to the area, and he began to farm. He was also a mechanical engineer by trade, and he conceived the idea of a self-contained city where he could create jobs for the unemployed.\n\nIn 1904, he purchased the site and began to build the city. The city was planned with a residential area at the front, with a commercial core to the rear. The core of the city was the land that is now York University Heights.\n\nWhat are the benefits of living in York University Heights Toronto?\n\nOne of the biggest benefits of living in York University Heights is the proximity to the University of Toronto. There are very few residential areas that are as close to a school campus as this. This is great for students and parents, as you will be able to walk or bike to class virtually every day. You’ll find that there are a lot of events and activities planned for students each year, and there are always new ones coming up.\n\nAnother big benefit is that it is very easy to get to work or school. You’re only a short drive from the subway, and you’re only a short drive from the highway if you want to drive. Also, if you’re a working parent, you’re in great hands with the nice and helpful staff at the York University Parent Centre.\n\nThe challenges of living in York University Heights Toronto\n\nAs with most things in life, living in York University Heights is not without its challenges. The most significant one is maintenance. A major challenge that you will have to deal with is parking. York University has a lot of students, so finding a place to park can be difficult. On top of that, some of the lots are small, and you might not be able to park in the correct area during rush hour. As with everything, though, with a little effort and perseverance, you can overcome these challenges.\n\nCommon Electrical Issues for houses in The Village at York University Toronto\n\nThe electrical issues that you will face in your house in York University Heights, especially if you’re a first time homeowner, are actually quite minor compared to the issues that other homeowners will face.\n\nHere are some of the most common electrical issues you will run into in your house in York University Heights:\n\nWiring in walls\n\nVoltage switches\n\nElectrical outlets\n\nWiring in ceilings\n\nFuses\n\nLighting in ceilings\n\nWiring in walls\n\nThe wiring in your walls is actually quite simple.

Your shower and/or toilets don’t work, and it’s pretty common for this to be a result of a clogged drain. Let our team take a look at your slow flow and clogged drains to see what is causing it and what needs to be done to fix it.\n\nCommon HVAC Issue after 20-25 years for Homes in York University Heights, Toronto\n\nSince most of the neighborhoods in York University Heights were built around 2005-2007 it is time for some inspections and updates. If you are living in this area then your older AC unit could be having problems because of wear and tear, reduced efficiency, refrigerant leaks, improperly working fans, or anything else that could be causing it to malfunction.\n\nGenerally in colder climates, residents may not be as wear and tear on their HVAC systems. Even though they’re built to withstand this usage, it usually lasts around 15-25 years in a temperate climate.\n\nYour HVAC systems should be checked by a professional every 6 months. This means that if you have a standard central AC or heat pump system, each of these units should be maintained, each year. If you have a heat pump system that you use year-round, then your service will need to be scheduled once every 6 months!\n\nLet Man with a Wrench in Southern Ontario Repair your Home with Appliance Repair, Plumbing, Electrical & HVAC Services\n\nIf you are looking for a company that specializes in appliance repair, then look no further.
