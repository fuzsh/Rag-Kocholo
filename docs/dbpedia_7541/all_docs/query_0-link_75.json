        "text": "The Silverthorn neighbourhood is named after Aaron Silverthorn who settled here with his wife and three sons in 1825. The old Silverthorn homestead was located high on a hill near the present-day Silverthorn and Eglinton Avenues. Aaron’s son, Francis, inherited his father’s property and turned it into a successful cattle farm. Francis was also a pioneer in dietetics and healthy living. He made honey and salt- free biscuits and sold these products under the banner of the “Silverthorn Honey and Hardtack Company.” Francis Silverthorn died in 1894 at the age of seventy-nine. The former Silverthorn farm was opened up for residential development in 1914 under the name Silverthorn Heights. Sales were brisk and the subdivision filled in very quickly. However, it wasn’t until the late 1920’s that Silverthorn residents would receive the basic city services such as water, sewers, and paved roads that they enjoy today.\n\nA cluster of recreational activities are available in the Black Creek Drive and Eglinton Avenue area. The Centennial building at 2694 Eglinton Avenue East has an indoor swimming pool as well as being the home of a local historical museum. There are four large public parks located along Black Creek Drive near Eglinton Avenue. Starting at the north end, Trethewey Park is a nature revitalization area on the banks of the Black Creek. This is an ideal spot for picnic goers and nature enthusiasts. Coronation Park is a mix of sports and leisure. This park has a T-Ball and Softball leagues as well as two tennis courts, a children’s playground and a woodland trail. North and South Keelesdale Park feature large sports fields and baseball diamonds. The Chris Tonks Ice Arena is also situated in South Keelesdale Park.\n\nThe Silverthorn Public Library, at 1748 St. Clair Avenue West is famous for appearing on the opening sequence of the syndicated Book Mice television show. Children from all over Canada and as far away as the United States have stopped in to visit the home of the book mice. The staff at this library even conduct a Book Mice Tour much to the delight of the children who visit here."
