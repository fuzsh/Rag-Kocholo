        "text": "Canada is made up of provinces and territories, and has cities of all sizes contributing to its population, which is one of the largest in the world. There are three different territories in the country and a total of 10 provinces. These geographical areas are divided as such to govern over specific geographic areas.\n\nWhen looking at the cities of Canada, the designations that make an area a 'city' varies by province. For example, any area that is qualified as a city in the province of Alberta must have a population that exceeds 10,000 people, along with other criteria including the size of land parcels of the area's buildings. On the other hand, in British Columbia, a community can qualify as a city with just a population of over 5,000 residents, even if this number drops in the future. British Columbia even has a city, Greenwood, which has a population of less than 1,000 because it was once much larger. The province of Quebec doesn't even have the designations of city -- it is comprised of \"villes,\" cities or towns that aren't counted by size, although the province does have separate municipalities.\n\nJust over 30 cities and their surrounding urban areas account for about two-thirds of Canada's population. As of Canada's census from 2011, the country is comprised of 33 Census Metropolitan Areas and 114 census agglomerations. Breaking these numbers down even further, there were a total of 1,137 municipalities throughout the country that were classified as cities, towns or villes, according to the census data.\n\nToronto\n\nToronto is one of the most iconic cities in Canada, and it also happens to be its most populous. Toronto also continues to show steady growth and is approaching 3 million residents who call Toronto home.\n\nMontreal\n\nAnother one of the more recognizable city names in Canada, with nearly 2 million residents, that shouldn't be a surprise. Montreal has shown quite the same level of growth as Canada's largest metropolis, Toronto, but Montreal is a growing and healthy city.\n\nCalgary\n\nNot only is Calgary one of the largest cities in Canada with over one million residents, but it is also one of the fasting growing locations. At that rate, it won't be long before Calgary rivals Montreal in terms of population.\n\nOttawa\n\nThe city of Ottawa is essentially the fifth of the big six when it comes to cities in Canada that have near or more than one million residents. With more than 900,000 residents and a strong growth rate, Ottawa continues to remain one of Canada's most vibrant cities.\n\nEdmonton\n\nAlthough the city of Edmonton isn't as large as the largest city in Canada, Toronto but with Edmonton also claiming more than 900 thousand residents, it isn't a small town either. The more than 2.5% growth rates also prove just how popular this thriving city is.\n\nMississauga\n\nChecking in with more than 700,000 residents, the city of Mississauga is too big to be missed. Slower than average growth rates don't necessarily translate into a robust city but slow and steady growth does offer stability and security.\n\nWinnipeg\n\nThe city of Winnipeg is another major city in Canada that has reached the 700,000 resident mark. Winnipeg has also shown steady and impressive growth rates, which is a good sign for residents and potentially for those who are considering calling Winnipeg home.\n\nVancouver\n\nThe city of Vancouver is not only a popular Canadien destination, it is also a city that is surprisingly large with more than 600,000 residents. That shock might be because of the small-town feel associated with Vancouver. With a solid growth rate of near one percent, however, that small-town feel might soon begin to feel a bit larger.\n\nBrampton\n\nWith just under 600,000 residents, the city of Brampton must also be considered one of the major cities in Canada. That is also due in large part to its impressive growth rate of well over two percent. And at that rate, it won't be long before Brampton becomes a city with just over 600,000 residents either."
