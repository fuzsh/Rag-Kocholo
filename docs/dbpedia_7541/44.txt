1830 JG Chewett: Plan Shewing the Survey of part of the Park East of the Town of York into 1/2 Acre Lots

“The area from Parliament, Street to the Don River formed the first major extension of the town after 1797. The subdivision south of Queen Street shown here was laid out on behalf of the York General Hospital which had been granted the land in 1819. The names noted are chiefly those of shopkeepers and craftsmen who lived elsewhere in town. Most of them probably purchased these lots as investments. Note the earlier fields and buildings which were ignored in the new survey. Also note the effect that the diversion of King Street to the bridge over the Don River had on the grid plan.”
