The Nobel Prize has been awarded to a number of scholars who were in some way affiliated to Leiden University. Lorentz, Kamerlingh Onnes and Einthoven were professors at Leiden when they were awarded the Nobel Prize.

The Nobel Prize is the most prestigious prize in science. This international award, founded by Alfred Nobel, has been awarded annually since 1901 for achievements in physics, chemistry, medicine and literature, and for promoting peace. In 1968, the Bank of Sweden instituted the Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel. The Nobel Laureates are announced in October every year. The winners receive their awards (a monetary prize, a gold medal and a diploma) on 10 December, the anniversary of Nobel’s death.
