        "text": "Mary Evans Picture Library Photo Prints and Wall Art\n\nLorentz / Hendrik / Nobel 02\n\nHENDRIK ANTOON LORENTZ Dutch physicist\n\nMary Evans Picture Library makes available wonderful images created for people to enjoy over the centuries\n\nMedia ID 4379539\n\nÂ© Mary Evans Picture Library 2015 - https://copyrighthub.org/s0/hub1/creation/maryevans/MaryEvansPictureID/10076448\n\n1853 Hendrik Nobel Oval Physicist Signature Spectacles 1928 Antoon\n\nEDITORS COMMENTS\n\nThis photograph captures the distinguished visage of Hendrik Antoon Lorentz, the esteemed Dutch physicist who was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1902. The image, taken in the late 1920s, showcases Lorentz in deep thought, with his piercing eyes hidden behind round spectacles and a thick beard covering his chin. The oval-shaped frame adds an air of elegance and historical significance to the portrait. Born on July 18, 1853, in Arkemheen, Netherlands, Lorentz made groundbreaking contributions to the field of physics, particularly in the areas of electromagnetism and the theory of ether. His work laid the foundation for the development of modern physics and earned him a place among the greats of scientific history. The Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded to Lorentz and Pieter Zeeman in 1902 for their work on the Zeeman effect, which demonstrated the influence of a magnetic field on the spectral lines of atoms. This discovery provided crucial evidence for the existence of electrons and helped to establish the field of atomic physics. The signature on the bottom right of the photograph, written in Dutch, attests to the authenticity of the image and adds to its historical value. This photograph is a testament to the enduring legacy of Hendrik Antoon Lorentz and his groundbreaking contributions to the world of physics.\n\nMADE IN THE USA\n\nSafe Shipping with 30 Day Money Back Guarantee\n\nFREE PERSONALISATION*\n\nWe are proud to offer a range of customisation features including Personalised Captions, Color Filters and Picture Zoom Tools\n\nSECURE PAYMENTS\n\nWe happily accept a wide range of payment options so you can pay for the things you need in the way that is most convenient for you\n\n* Options may vary by product and licensing agreement.
