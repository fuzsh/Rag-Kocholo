        "text": "Shortly after we covered the Flying Dutchman, Pellikaan Timing released their first public information, about the latest model to come out of the small Utrecht (the Netherlands) based workshop: the Hendrik Lorentz. Just like the Flying Dutchman, it excels in legibility and shares the same recognizable style.\n\nThis new edition is named after the scientific ‘father’ of Albert Einstein, Hendrik Antoon Lorentz, a Dutch physicist born in Arnhem, the Netherlands in 1853. Sharing a Nobel Prize in physics with Pieter Zeeman for the discovery and theoretical explanation of the Zeeman Effect, Hendrik Lorentz also derived the ‘transformation equations’ on which Albert Einstein based his explanation of space and time, the famous theory of relativity. The transformation equations explain how measurements of space and time, by two observers, are related. The idea is that two observers, moving at different speeds, measure different distances by different elapsed times, and even experience the same occurrences on a different scale.\n\nThe way it’s incorporated into the Pellikaan Timing Hendrik Lorentz is more obvious than you might think after reading the previous section. Each hand of the Hendrik Lorentz can be considered as a different ‘observer’, each of them measuring time at a different speed and thus achieving different distances. Hubert Pellikaan, namesake to the brand, designed the dial in such a way that each hand follows its very own scale. This emphasizes the difference in measurement of time, and extensively, the concept behind Hendrik Lorentz’s equations. All hands measure time, but on a different scale, speed and distance.\n\nThe outer scale of the dial is linked to the seconds (1/5th of a second for each small marker). The larger markers on the outer ring are both minutes and seconds markers. The leaf-shaped minute hand ‘touches’ the minute markers, but stays just clear of the seconds’ markers. Each 5-minutes indication is larger, to help the dial’s legibility. The crosshair, just like on the Flying Dutchman, divides the dial into quarters. The third and final ring is divided into large, bold hour markers, small quarter markers and large half hour markers. The dial is made of pearled silver, in an off-white color, with black printed markings. Hands are finished in matte black.\n\nThe Hendrik Lorentz is equipped with a Soprod A10-2 automatic movement. Previous automatic models were equipped with an ETA 2892A2, but they are no longer actively distributed outside of the Swatch-group, as we all know. The Soprod movement is a good alternative though, with the same specifications as the ETA. Inside the Pellikaan, the movement is adjusted to six positions, meaning that it should achieve a very good chronometric rate.\n\nThe Hendrik Lorentz comes in a 40mm x 9.5mm steel case, with a see-through caseback to allow a view on the movement. The case is fitted with sapphire crystals on each side, both with an anti-reflective coating. It will come on a black alligator strap with engraved pin-buckle, and an extra black nylon NATO-strap.\n\nWe praised the Flying Dutchman for its deceptively simple, yet very intriguing dial, and the new Hendrik Lorentz travels along the exact same path. The smaller size doesn’t take anything out of its design, and opens up the collection to more people who might not feel comfortable with a 45mm case, as the Flying Dutchman.\n\nThe Pellikaan Timing Hendrik Lorentz is available for € 1.895-Eur (including EU taxes). For more information about Pellikaan Timing and this new model, please check out their website and Facebook-page.\n\nEditorial extra: Pellikaan Flying Dutchman Perpetuum HDI\n\nAlongside this new model, let us present you a very special Flying Dutchman – a unique edition, auctioned off to fund the Helen Dowling Institute, a leading Dutch cancer-research and treatment institute in Bilthoven, the Netherlands. Considering the pharmaceutical background of Hubert Pellikaan, his support for such a cause is not a surprise.\n\nThe Pellikaan Timing Flying Dutchman Perpetuum HDI features a very subtle touch of green on the counterweight of the second’s hand. The winning bidder will also enjoy selecting a custom engraving on the rotor of the automatic movement.\n\nThe auction raised an impressive € 341.712-Eur. We can only applaud Pellikaan Timing for taking part in this auction and supporting a truly worthy cause. It is another testimony of the strong link between watches and charity."
