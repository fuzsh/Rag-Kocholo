        "text": "The philosopher-Physicists centers on the origins of modern mathematical physics developed primarily by Maxwell and Helmholtz. In alternate chapters, the contributions of the principals are placed in the context of the prevailing discourses and controversies in physics and philosophy. Cultural contexts, such as art (e.g. the pre-Raphaelites), literature (e.g. romanticism) and historical events (e.g. the revolutions of 1848 and the Franco-Prussian war) are presented. Contemporaries, such as Boltzmann, Gibbs, Oersted, and Riemann in mathematical physics, and Fichte, Schelling, Hegel, and Frege in philosophy are considered. The last chapters deal with the influence of the work of Maxwell and Helmholtz on the developments in 20 th century mathematical physics, focusing on the origins of quantum mechanics. The theme of the arguments is in the influence of Kantian epistemology and metaphysics on the authors. The epilogue examines the work of Arthur Compton as founded on Maxwell's electrodynamics and field theory and Helmholtz' concept of energy (all modified by Einstein), and Boltzmann's Statistical Mechanics. It highlights the difficulties of modern wave-particle dualism inherent on their dependence on the mathematical formalism and on innovations of the principals. The arguments are paraphrased with a minimum of both scientific and philosophical technical terminology, and there is no mathematical notation. This is to make the work accessible to non-specialists, typically at the undergraduate level.\n\nHere are two rational alternatives to Special Relativity that preserve commonsense. Almost all of the dramatic results arising from the theory of special relativity derive from the kinematic consequences of the Lorentz transformation, especially with respect to its impact on the time dimension, where it appears to result in dynamical effects. An analysis of the Lorentz transformation herein shows that equally valid alternative kinematic assumptions lead to the earlier (1887) Voigt transform, which is usually viewed as simply equivalent to the Lorentz transform in the transverse spatial dimensions. This is shown NOT to be the case, and the Voigt transformations are shown to be much closer to the classical (Galilean) transforms. Einstein's derivation of the Lorentz transform is shown to rely on a critical, third hypothesis, namely one of symmetry between the two inertial reference frames; this assumption is shown not to be reflected in the actual physics of optical observations. It is also emphasized here that Relativity is a derived theory – being based on the validity of classical Maxwell electrodynamics. Although Maxwell's implicit assumption of continuity of electric charge has been shown by von Laue to be incompatible with the relativistic treatment of mass points, relativity has been universally accepted as the theory for treating point electrons. Planck's 1907 proposal for redefining the momentum of a particle is shown to be the critical foundation of relativistic particle dynamics, however, this proposal is independent of the Special Theory of Relativity and is neither derived from this theory nor do its results (including the infamous formula, E = mc 2) validate SRT. (Einstein's 1905 analysis of particle dynamics is incorrect and all of his attempts to derive the equivalence of mass and energy were failures.) However, Planck's proposal is shown to be valid only for electrostatic forces – a result that has major negative implications for all of today's quantum field theories. When the Voigt results are combined with Heaviside's 1888 results for delayed electromagnetic interactions between two moving charged particles, an understandable and consistent interpretation of these famous velocity-sensitive experiments is obtained. This demonstrates that the 'unusual' high-speed effects that are often attributed to relativity result only from \" magnetic \" effects becoming comparable to the \" electric \" ones. The combination of these two approaches, from almost forgotten 19th Century physicists, provides a new impetus for reexamining the delayed action-at-a-distance approach to electro-magnetism proposed first by Gauss, the greatest mathematician of this earlier century. This new coherent approach, when combined with a more fundamental 'Relativity Principle', provides a superior research program for consolidating the peculiar (velocity-sensitive) characteristics of the electromagnetic​ interaction with the velocity independent foundations of classical particle dynamics. This restores the natural philosophy of Isaac Newton, involving absolute space and absolute time, to a unified relativistic framework that should be viewed as a superior alternative to the contradictory and bizarre results of the Lorentz transformation derived from Maxwellian field theory and its 20th Century successors. The \"rush to explanation\", exemplified by using coordinate transformations to explain the increasing difficulty of accelerating charged particles as they increase their energy and extended unstable particle lifetimes at high velocities, has avoided the search for more realistic dynamical explanations of many high-velocity phenomena. In fact, particle lifetimes are the only physical 'evidence' for accepting the validity of the special theory of relativity as a universal basis for all of modern physics. However, ​even this result is contradicted by Planck's invariant quantum of action which all field theories (whether subject to Lorentz or Voigt transformations) predict to vary with relative velocity. In summary, the detailed analysis presented herein demonstrates that the special theory of relativity is, at best, an arbitrary theory of mathematical transformations divorced from the microphysical foundations of the electromagnetic phenomena it is supposedly based upon.\n\nIn the early twentieth century scientific internationalism was a multifaceted phenomenon. Both the Dutch physicist Hendrik Antoon Lorentz and his Leiden successor Paul Ehrenfest promoted the cause of international scientific cooperation. But they did so in different ways and for different reasons. Lorentz's highly visible role as organizer and president of the Solvay conferences and as international science broker during and after World War I can be traced back to the cultural nationalism characteristic of the Dutch scientific community around the turn of the century. It reflected the newly won self-consciousness of Dutch scientists as well as the nation's self-assigned role as mediator between the great powers. Ehrenfest's more low-profile efforts were primarily directed at establishing contacts between young Dutch scientists and their Eastern European and American peers and at stimulating academic careers abroad. These attempts stemmed from personal experiences and were related to a truly internationalist ideology, akin to Einstein's internationalism. With some simplification one may characterize the difference by stating that from one perspective science was seen to be the fruit of the nation and internationalism served to channel and allow for peaceful international competition and hence national prestige, while from the other science helped to erode the nation-state and served as a model for a world government."
