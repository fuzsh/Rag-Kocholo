        "text": "One of the most popular writers of contemporary horror, suspense and science fiction, American author Stephen King has published over 50 novels and penned hundreds of short stories. Best known for writing the horror novel ‘It’ which revolves around a mysterious maleficent being that terrorizes children, King is undoubtedly one of the most loved horror writers whose writings never fail to incite fear, terror and fright in the minds of the readers. The author who mostly publishes under his real name also used to publish under the pseudonym ‘Richard Bachman’. Funnily enough, the sale of Richard Bachman’s books increased manifold after it was revealed that Bachman was none other than Stephen King himself. King is a highly prolific writer and the winner of multiple awards including the prestigious Bram Stoker Awards. Growing up King had a difficult childhood as he was raised by a single mother in financially difficult circumstances. While still a small boy he witnessed the horrific death of a friend who was struck and killed by a train in front of his eyes—this incident might have played a role in inspiring some of his darker writings. His first published novel was ‘Carrie’ which was so successful that it led to several film and Broadway adaptations."
