        "text": "Stephen (Edwin) King, (born Sept. 21, 1947, Portland, Maine, U.S.), U.S. writer of horror stories. Educated at the University of Maine, he became a prolific writer of enormously popular books and, because he was also frequently translated, one of the worldâ€™s best-selling writers. His books blend horror, the macabre, fantasy, and science fiction. Carrie (1974), his first published novel and an immediate success, was followed by such works as The Shining (1977), The Dead Zone (1979), Pet Sematary (1983), It (1986), Misery (1987), 11/22/63 (2011), Doctor Sleep (2013), The Outsider (2018), The Institute (2019), and Later (2021). Many of his works were adapted for TV and film."
