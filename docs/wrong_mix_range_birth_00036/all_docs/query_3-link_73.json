Though the novel was written well before school shootings were anywhere near as prolific as they are today, many critics cited the novel as playing a role in their prevalence.\n\nAfter the novel was either referred to or found in the possession of several school shooters, King wrote the essay, “Guns”, and pulled the novel from publication.\n\nYou can read more about Rage and its controversy, here.\n\nRelated\n\nStephen King Books That Have Been Banned the Most\n\nStephen King Movies\n\nIt should come as no surprise that King has a whopping forty-one adaptations based on his work.\n\nHe also has three scheduled for upcoming release with an additional ten in development. Here are the top ten Stephen King adaptations based on critic and fan response.\n\nCarrie\n\nA movie steeped in nostalgia for so many reasons, Carrie is considered one of King’s most popular adaptation by both critics and fans alike.\n\nSissy Spacek shines in the titular role under Brian De Palma’s direction, and seeing a young John Travolta get his comeuppance as the terrible Billy Nolan is a delightful treat.\n\nStand By Me\n\nIs there anything more terrifying than the daunting prospect of leaving your childhood behind? King doesn’t seem to think so. This group of boys starts with nothing but summer adventures on their minds.\n\nBut as they face obstacles on their journey, they learn the truth of their private lives and are forced to grow up in a way that strikes home no matter what stage of life they’re in.\n\nThe Shawshank Redemption\n\nAdapted from the novella, Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption, this adaptation focuses on the friendship between two men in prison.\n\nThe reality of prison showcases a nest of horrors without bringing in any supernatural elements, and yet Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman bring depth and humanity to a story that embraces the redeeming power of hope.\n\nRelated\n\n22 Best Stephen King Movies for a Night of Terror\n\nThe Green Mile\n\nThe all-star cast alone makes this an adaptation worth watching. Though it does tend to run a bit long, the emotional resonance of these profound performances pushes The Green Mile into a must-watch film.\n\nIt’s a journey that highlights the horror of what people are capable of, not by the deeds they do, but by the compassion and love one man has for life.\n\nMisery\n\nKathy Bates makes this movie one of the best adaptations of all time. Her performance as the terrifying Annie Wilkes tormenting her favorite author (James Caan) is one of her most terrifying to date.\n\nAnd listen, none of us enjoy it when an author kills our favorite character. But Annie Wilkes takes her unhappiness to a whole new level.\n\nIt’s a must-watch for any King fan.\n\nThe Shining\n\nThough King himself wasn’t a fan of Kubrick’s adaptation and the movie deviates fairly significantly from the novel, fans and critics couldn’t turn away.\n\nWith an unforgettable performance by Jack Nicholson and Shelley Duvall, The Shining is a terrifying glimpse into one man’s descent into insanity.\n\nRelated\n\nEvery Stephen King Movie, Ranked\n\nThe Dead Zone\n\nNoted by critics as one of the best King adaptations, The Dead Zone sees Johnny Smith (Christopher Walken) as he struggles to reconcile his current present with his not-so-distant past after he wakes from a coma.\n\nIT\n\nThere will always be a place in our hearts for the first adaptation, but the 2017 version takes the original to the next level.\n\nThe superb performances balance the terror of supernatural horrors with the heartbreaking and emotional journey six children must take to overcome the various hurts of their childhood.\n\nDolores Claiborne\n\nJennifer Jason Leigh and Kathy Bates create a delicious tension as they face off in this layered thriller. Leigh accuses Bates of killing her mother, but the truth is far more complicated.\n\nAs she investigates, she circles deeper into her childhood and is forced to face some dark truths.\n\n1408\n\nNot all adaptations have to be entirely faithful to the original story to gain King’s approval.\n\n1408 deviates from the source material but manages to capture what King believed was the essence of the story.\n\nFocusing on the psychological terror of an author battling his own demons in a haunted hotel room, John Cusick and Samuel L. Jackson deliver in this creepy and tightly focused thriller.\n\nSearching for chills?

He was born on September 21, 1947.\n\nThis places King firmly as a Virgo, which makes a lot of sense. Virgos are known for being hard-working and diligent, while also being very personable despite their quiet demeanor, traits that seem to embody the author.\n\nAnd don’t be fooled by his age. King continues to write, and even publishing a book earlier this year.\n\nStephen King Twitter\n\nBefore Twitter became X, it was the preferred social media for most authors, which makes sense.\n\nIt was the only social media that not only relied primarily on words, it forced users to craft their thoughts into razor-sharp short tweets. It was a challenge writers happily accepted and Stephen King is no exception.\n\nEven after many authors changed their accounts to “updates only” and fled for bluer skies or new threads, King has remained as vocal and active on X than ever before. And why not?\n\nHe still enjoys over seven million followers with thousands continuing to engage with his posts.\n\nIt helps that King has no qualms with fighting for what he believes in. One of his most popular tweets garnering over twelve million views chastised Elon Musk after the billionaire accused King of “deadnaming” Twitter as a terrible attempt at anti-trans humor.\n\nThe author has also never held back when expressing his thoughts on former President Donald Trump. He has never been a fan, and clearly never will be.\n\nBut even someone who enjoys a relatively strong following with fans can’t always avoid the negative spotlight. One of his most controversial tweets was regarding diversity in the arts.\n\nAt first, King tweeted that quality should be held above diversity, a stance that many argued was very problematic because it ignores how many people are excluded from participating when diversity is ignored.\n\nHe later walked back his comments.\n\nRelated\n\nStephen King Recommends 21 Creepy Horror Movies & Shows You Should Watch on Netflix\n\nWas Stephen King in Sons of Anarchy?\n\nStephen King is known for making appearances in adaptations of his works. But does he appear in shows that aren’t his own?\n\nHe does, though often it’s as himself, like when he told Marge Simpson he was taking a break from horror to write Benjamin Franklin’s autobiography.\n\nKing’s appearance on Sons of Anarchy was brief, but memorable. He played a caretaker named Bachman, a nod to one of his more famous pen names, Richard Bachman.\n\nIn addition to the role, a fictional Stephen King novel titled, Cycle Zombies, is written into the story with one of the bikers reading it when hunkered down in the crew’s cabin.\n\nIs Stephen King Married?\n\nStephen King is happily married to Tabitha King, née Spruce. The couple wed on January 2, 1971, and have remained together ever since.\n\nTabitha King is a philanthropist and novelist in her own right, and King often attributes her for not just salvaging his debut novel but being the steady hand throughout his career and life.\n\nRelated\n\nTerror Times Two: Every Novel Stephen King Has Co-Written With Other Horror Authors\n\nHow Tall is Stephen King?\n\nIt might come as a surprise that Stephen King is quite tall. He stands 6’4” tall and has maintained his weight around 200 pounds for his entire life. On his website, he states that he descends from Scots-Irish ancestry, who were known for their height.\n\nIs Joe Hill Stephen King’s Son?\n\nStephen and Tabitha King have three children.\n\nJoe Hill is their middle child, though not the only writer. Owen King, the youngest, also writes and publishes novels.\n\nJoe Hill decided at the start of his career to try to succeed as a writer on his own merit and largely succeeded. It was only after his first novel was a success and Vanity Fair wrote an article on his relationship with his famous father that Hill admitted his true identity publicly.\n\nRelated\n\n40 Best Stephen King Quotes That Every Horror Fan Needs to Read"
