        "text": "Stephen King is a talented and very famous novelist and author of horror, sci-fi and fantasy books, which are being sold in incredible amounts all around the world. Born in 1947 in Maine, he grew up there alongside his elder brother and was brought up by his single mom. His childhood was a little difficult and it formed his mind as a fictional book writer. He's graduated from the University of Maine receiving a bachelor degree in Arts. He began writing his first stories and managed to sell the first one in 1967. That's when his professional career started. In 1973 he released his first novel titled Carrie, and so far he has released 61 novels, which include the ones written by Stephen King under the name of Richard Bachman. He is the author of over 200 stories and 6 non-fiction books, with a large number of his books and stories having been adapted to popular movies, comic books, TV and mini-series, etc. His most famous books include The Green Mile, Hearts in Atlantis, Just After Sunset, and many more. Stephen King has received plenty of awards like the British Fantasy Award, Bram Stoker Award, Locus Awards, Horror Guild Award, and so on. Unfortunately, in 1999 he suffered from a serious car accident when he was hit by a driver. This unfortunate event caused a certain decline and a cease of his writing activities. His wife Tabita Spruce is a writer too, and the couple has 3 children."
