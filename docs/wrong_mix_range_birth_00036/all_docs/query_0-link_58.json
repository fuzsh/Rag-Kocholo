        "text": "What are five books you loved? For one of them, why did you love it?\n\nIn no particular order:\n\n1) Ragtime by E.L. Doctorow\n\n2) Waiting for the Barbarians by J.M. Coetzee\n\n3) Slaughterhouse Five by Kurt Vonnegut\n\n4) North American Lake Monsters by Nathan Balingrud\n\n5) UBIK by Philip Dick\n\nThere are many reasons why I loved these books (and the many more I couldn't add to the list, since I could only choose five), but if we're picking one somewhat common theme it's a type of regulatory fantasy -- which is to say a world (or worlds) that exist outside of our own, or just in the boundaries of our own -- but with some sense of rules. I don't personally need to know all the rules, but just that they exist, somewhere. Ragtime might only barely seem to fit into this, as it's more historical fiction than anything, but as you get more into the book, there are elements of fate and gordian-knot, American Exceptionalism, and a potentially psychic child placed in there in key moments. It's a beautiful weaving of our painful history, our potential future, and everything that brought (or will bring) us there.\n\nWhat is a book you didn’t like, and why?\n\nOh gosh, this is harder. I usually find something to love in most books. I have to admit that I wasn't a fan of Ready Player One. I'm certainly the right age for it, as I'm a child of the 80s, and far be it from me to critize a wildly popular novel -- but it just didn't grab me. I mostly found myself not particularly caring. Finished it, just for completists' sake, but I wasn't grabbed the way others seemed to have been.\n\nWhat is a funny/interesting/unique anecdote about you as a reader?\n\nI don't know if it's all that funny, but many years ago, I realized that despite having been an English major and having read voraciously all my life, I'd never read War and Peace. At the same time, I didn't really feel like thunking it down on my nightstand -- no way I'd get through more than a page in the evening without falling asleep. So I installed it next to the toilet and over the next...wow, at least a year, I'd say, I read through the entire thing while taking care of business. Like I said, don't know if it's all that funny, but it's true.\n\nHow did you first fall in love with books?\n\nI'm an only child. 'Nuff said.\n\nWell, okay, maybe a bit more -- primarily that my parents definitely read to me constantly, and soon I was taking it up myself. We went on a lot of trips when I was a kid, and being an only child, I was relegated to the back seat -- and rather than watch the scenery go by, I buried myself in whatever books I brought or found on the trip. Man, we'd go through every English-language bookshop or section we could find, no matter the country, just to feed my habit.\n\nWhat book or books are you planning to read soon?\n\nI've been reading a lot for work recently, and so there are a bunch of different nonfiction books currently waiting on my Kindle/iPad. One about AI/EAs, one about identity theft, one just called How To Disappear -- don't worry, I'm not going anywhere.\n\nWhat book do you always recommend?\n\nIt really depends on the person and their interests. I sometimes throw Geek Love by Katherine Dunn at them, just to see where they lie on the spectrum, and go from there.\n\nWhat book/books changed the way you see the world and your place in it?\n\nYou know, when I was relatively young, I read The World According To Garp, and while it was a pretty singular tone -- and a strange one, perhaps, for a teenager to read -- something about it definitely woke up the writer in me. Maybe it was the setting or Garp's profession or just the power of John Irving's words, but it struck a chord with me and set me on a path.\n\nWhat was your favorite childhood book?\n\nEasy one: The Hobbit.\n\nHave you ever read anything that made you think differently about fiction/nonfiction?\n\nI've been playing with structure a lot recently -- in film/tv primarily, but started to explore it more in prose -- and books like The House of Blue Leaves are obviously at the forefront of that.\n\nWhat’s your favorite under-appreciated novel?\n\nI wouldn't say they're underappreciated because they were all massive bestsellers, but I think the general public doesn't give Stephen King enough credit for the fanastic characterization he does in his books. We wouldn't care nearly as much about the plots or the scares if we didn't care deeply for the people he creates.\n\nWhat authors did you dislike at first but grew into?\n\nI was never a big Hemingway fan until I got a bit older. I always went for the flourish first, and I was drawn to Faulkner early on -- but as I matured, I found that the economy of style (and his themes) started to speak to me a bit more.\n\nWhat book have you read that has most influenced your life?\n\nI'd probably go back to Slaughterhouse Five for this one, if only because it -- and Vonnegut in general -- woke me up to tone and voice in a way that prior books had not. I was probably ten or eleven at the time (a bit early to be reading it, but so it goes), and it definitely made an impact.\n\nWho are your favorite writers?\n\nOf the classic-to-mid-20th century: Kafka, Steinbeck, Orwell\n\nModern(ish): Margaret Atwood, Kurt Vonnegut, John Irving, Elmore Leonard, Simon Rich, T.C. Boyle\n\nWhat do you read on holiday?\n\nOh, Elmore Leonard, definitely. Carl Hiaasen. Simon Rich. Mostly fun, darkly comedic stuff.\n\nWhich author (living or dead) do you think is most underrated?\n\nAs discussed before, Stephen King -- seen as populist fluff (which it can be) but it's got some fantastic foundation and chops --\n\nOh, and Walter Tevis. I mean, all the man did was write The Hustler, The Color of Money, The Man Who Fell To Earth, and The Queen’s Gambit. And outside of a few small circles, nobody knows his name. I mean, c'mon...\n\nWhat is your favorite book published in the past twelve months?\n\nThe Vanishing Half was pretty damned great.\n\nDid your parents read to you when you were young?\n\nOh yes, quite constantly.\n\nWhich book have you given most frequently as a gift to others?\n\nOther than the Oh the Places You'll Go which seems to be a you-must-give-it-to-all-college grads, and How to Cook Everything, which I love giving to people moving out on their own the first time, I think I've probably gifted Geek Love more than anything else.\n\nWhich fictional character would you most like to have a drink with, and why?\n\nHmmm... Arya Stark? I'd really love to know how that list is coming along. I have a feeling (TV series notwithstanding) we may never know.\n\nWhere do you buy your books?\n\nPrimarily either online or, if I happen to be wandering around town, in whatever small bookshop I stop into. If it's online, it's usually for a targeted reason, and I get it in Kindle format; if it's in person, it's just kind of puttering around and looking at things until I find something that catches my eye. In NYC, I like The Strand. I don't end up in the large chains anymore, to the degree that there are large chains...\n\nDo you prefer physical books or ebooks?\n\nI've become an ebook person -- I like having a massive library on my iPad, and it means I can read in bed at night without having to hold the book, flip pages, etc. I know that's anathema to some, but I've found that it works well for me.\n\nEvery reader has a stack of favorites. What books would you grab if the house was on fire and you had to run out?\n\nHaha, no need -- I'd just grab my iPad!\n\nWhat impact can a book have on the reader?\n\nBooks, to me, are potentially the most immersive form of media. I say that as a writer of a bunch of different forms -- prose, film, television, and theatre -- because I'm aware that while books are simply printed words on a page/screen, they activate the imagination in a way that takes you out of the world in which you're actually living and transports you, if only for a time, to another place. I've seen a lot of immersive theatre, but even that has a fourth wall that's hard to break. Books get right inside your head, and that's hard to beat.\n\nEnd of Interview"
