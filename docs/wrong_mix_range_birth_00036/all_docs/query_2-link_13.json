        "text": "Stephen Edwin King (born September 21, 1947) is an American author best known for his enormously popular horror novels. King was the 2003 recipient of The National Book Foundation's Medal for Distinguished Contribution to American Letters\n\nKing evinces a thorough knowledge of the horror genre, as shown in his nonfiction book Danse Macabre, which chronicles several decades of notable works in both literature and cinema. He has also written stories outside the horror genre, including the novella collection Different Seasons, The Green Mile, The Eyes of the Dragon, The Stand, Hearts in Atlantis and his magnum opus The Dark Tower series. In the past, Stephen King has written under the pen names Richard Bachman, Beryl Evans (once), and (once) John Swithen.\n\nHe frequently makes a cameo appearances in film adaptations of his novels.\n\nBiography[]\n\nEarly life[]\n\nStephen Edwin King was born in Portland, Maine, on September 21, 1947. His father, Donald Edwin King, was a merchant seaman who was born with the surname Pollock, but changed it to King as an adult. King's mother was Nellie Ruth King (née Pillsbury). His parents were married in Scarborough, Maine, on July 23, 1939. Shortly afterwards, they lived with Donald's family in Chicago, Illinois before moving to Croton-on-Hudson, New York. King's parents returned to Maine towards the end of World War II, living in a modest house in Scarborough. When King was two years old, his father left the family. His mother Nellie raised King and his adopted older brother David by herself, sometimes under great financial strain. The family moved to Ruth's home town of Durham, Maine but also spent brief periods in Fort Wayne, Indiana and Stratford, Connecticut.\n\nAs a child, King witnessed a gruesome accident - one of his friends was caught on a railroad and struck by a train. It has been suggested that this could have been the inspiration for King's dark, disturbing creations, though King himself dismisses the idea.\n\nKing attended Durham Elementary School and Lisbon Falls High School.\n\nKing has been writing since an early age. When in school, he wrote stories based on movies he had seen recently and sold them to his friends. This was not popular among his teachers, and he was forced to return his profits when this was discovered. The stories were copied using a mimeo machine that his brother David used to copy a newspaper, Dave's Rag, which he self-published. Dave's Rag was about local events, and King would often contribute. As a young boy, King was an avid reader of EC's horror comics, which provided the genesis for his love of horror. He loved reading Tales from the Crypt.\n\nHis first published story was \"In a Half-World of Terror\" (re-titled from \"I Was a Teen-Age Grave-robber\"), published in a horror fanzine issued by Mike Garrett of Birmingham, Alabama.\n\nFrom 1966 to 1971, King studied English at the University of Maine at Orono. At the university, he wrote a column titled \"King's Garbage Truck\" in the student newspaper, the Maine Campus. He also met Tabitha Spruce; they married in 1971. King took on odd jobs to pay for his studies, including one at an industrial laundry. He used the experience to write the short story The Mangler and the novella Roadwork (as Richard Bachman). The campus period in his life is readily evident in the second part of Hearts in Atlantis.\n\nAfter finishing his university studies with a Bachelor of Arts in English and obtaining a certificate to teach high school, King taught English at Hampden Academy in Hampden, Maine. During this time, he and his family lived in a trailer. He wrote short stories (most were published in men's magazines) to help make ends meet. As told in the introduction in Carrie, if one of his kids got a cold, Tabitha would joke, \"Come on, Steve, think of a monster.\" King also developed a drinking problem which stayed with him for over a decade.\n\nBecoming famous[]\n\nDuring this period, King began a number of novels. One of his first ideas was of a young girl with psychic powers. However, he grew discouraged, and threw it into the trash. Tabitha later rescued it and encouraged him to finish it. After completing the novel, he titled it Carrie, sent it to Doubleday, and more or less forgot about it. Later, he received an offer to buy it with a $2,500 advance (not a large advance for a novel, even at that time). Shortly after, the value of Carrie was realized with the paperback rights being sold for $400,000 (with $200,000 of it going to the publisher). Soon following its release, his mother died of uterine cancer. His Aunt Emrine read the novel to her before she died.\n\nIn On Writing, King admits that at this time he was consistently drunk and that he was an alcoholic for well over a decade. He even admits that he was intoxicated while delivering the eulogy at his mother’s funeral. \"I think I did a pretty good job, considering how drunk I was at the time.\" (On Writing: A Memoir of the Craft) He states that he had based the alcoholic father in The Shining on himself, though he did not admit it (even to himself) for several years.\n\nShortly after the publication of The Tommyknockers, King's family and friends finally intervened, dumping his trash on the rug in front of him to show him the evidence of his own addictions: beer cans, cigarette butts, Xanax, Valium, NyQuil, dextromethorphan (cough medicine), and marijuana. As King related in his memoir, he sought help and quit all forms of drugs and alcohol in the late 1980s, and has remained sober since.\n\nKing spends winter seasons in an oceanfront mansion located off the Gulf of Mexico in Sarasota, Florida. Their three children, Naomi King, Joseph King (who appeared in the film Creepshow), and Owen King, are grown and living on their own.\n\nBoth Owen and Joseph are writers; Owen's first collection of stories, We're All in This Together: A Novella and Stories was published in 2005. The first collection of stories by Joe Hill (Joseph's pen name), 20th Century Ghosts, was published in 2005 by PS Publishing in a very limited edition, winning the Crawford Award for best new fantasy writer, together with the Bram Stoker Award and the British Fantasy Award for Best Fiction Collection. Tom Pabst has been hired to adapt Hill's upcoming novel, Heart-Shaped Box, for a 2007 Warner Bros release.\n\nKing's daughter Naomi is a Reverend in the Unitarian Universalist Church in Utica, New York, where she lives with her partner.\n\nWorks[]\n\nNovels[]\n\nThe following is a complete list of all the novels written and published by Stephen King.\n\nYear Title Publisher ISBN Pages Note 1974 Carrie Doubleday 978-0-385-08695-0 199 1975 'Salem's Lot 978-0-385-00751-1 439 Nominee, World Fantasy Award, 1976 1977 The Shining 978-0-385-12167-5 447 Runner-up (4th place), Locus Award for Best Fantasy Novel, 1978 Rage Signet Books 978-0-451-07645-8 211 First novel published under pseudonym Richard Bachman 1978 The Stand Doubleday 978-0-385-12168-2 823 Nominee, World Fantasy Award, 1979;\n\nRunner-up (15th place), Locus Award, 1979\n\n1979 The Long Walk Signet Books 978-0-451-08754-6 384 Published under pseudonym Richard Bachman The Dead Zone Viking Press 978-0-670-26077-5 428 Runner-up (2nd place), Locus Award for Best Fantasy Novel, 1980 1980 Firestarter 978-0-670-31541-3 426 Nominee, British Fantasy Award’s August Derleth Award, 1981;\n\nRunner-up (8th place), Locus Award for Best Science Fiction Novel, 1981\n\n1981 Roadwork Signet Books 978-0-451-09668-5 274 Published under pseudonym Richard Bachman Cujo Viking Press 978-0-670-45193-7 319 Winner, British Fantasy Award’s August Derleth Award, 1982;\n\nRunner-up (21st place), Locus Award for Best Fantasy Novel, 1982\n\n1982 The Running Man Signet Books 978-0-451-11508-9 219 Published under pseudonym Richard Bachman The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger Grant 978-0-937986-50-9 224 1983 Christine Viking 978-0-670-22026-7 526 Runner-up (6th place), Locus Award for Best Fantasy Novel, 1984 Pet Sematary Doubleday 978-0-385-18244-7 374 Nominee, World Fantasy Award, 1984;\n\nRunner-up (7th place), Locus Award for Best Fantasy Novel, 1984\n\nCycle of the Werewolf Land of Enchantment 978-0-960-38282-8 127 Illustrated by Bernie Wrightson 1984 The Talisman Viking 978-0-670-69199-9 646 Written with Peter Straub;\n\nNominee, World Fantasy Award, 1985;
