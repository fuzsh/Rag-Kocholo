        "text": "When a famous writer dies at ninety, his son investigates the defining friendship of his life. Turns out the old man kept his friends close—and his secrets closer.\n\nA young woman has gone missing in a small town. All that remains of her are an abandoned bike, a missing earring, and some surly classmates who don't want to talk. Then the mystery deepens.\n\nIn Stephen King's first story for Esquire, a mystery writer pulls into a Florida rest stop. When he overhears domestic abuse in the bathroom, he'll have to decide if—and how—he'll put a stop to it.\n\nCharlie knows to steer clear of the Psycho House, where old Mr. Bowditch lives. But when a howling dog and a gruesome accident draw him near, he'll find a shocking surprise.\n\nIt was supposed to be a family road trip to visit an aging relative. Then the car got stuck in a muddy rut and, well—these things never turn out well, do they? Stephen King, the legendary architect of your worst nightmares, delivers another shocking story you won’t soon forget."
