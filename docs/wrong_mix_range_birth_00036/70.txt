Background

Stephen Edwin King was born on September 21, 1947, in Portland, Maine. King’s father was a merchant seaman. When King was two years old, his father left the family and never returned. King and his older brother, David, were raised by their mother, Nellie Ruth. King attended Lisbon Falls High School and then the University of Maine at Orono, where he majored in English. After college, King worked as a high school teacher and also wrote a weekly column for the local paper. In the 1970s, King was struggling to make a living as a writer. He had a young family to support, and he was working part-time as a teacher. He had published a few short stories, but he wasn’t making much money from his writing.

In 1974, King published his first novel, “Carrie.” The book was a huge success, and King quickly became one of the most popular authors in the world. He has since written dozens of bestselling novels, and he is now one of the richest writers in the world. King’s career had its ups and downs. In the early years, he was very successful. But in the late 1990s, his career went into a decline. He was struggling with addiction, and his books were not well-received.

However, in the last few years, King’s career has seen a resurgence. King’s later years have been particularly successful. In the past five years, he has published four books that have become bestsellers. Three of these books were turned into movies, and two of them were turned into T.V. series. King has also won numerous awards, including the National Book Award and the Edgar Award.
