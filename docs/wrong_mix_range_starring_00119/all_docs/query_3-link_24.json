        "text": "Shah Rukh Khan Might Play a ‘Don’ Again in Suhana Khan’s Debut Bollywood Film ‘King’ – All You Need to Know\n\nAs per the reports Suhana Khan's next big film King will also feature Shah Rukh Khan as don. Along with Siddharth Anand and Sujoy Ghosh, even the superstar is working hard on every aspect of the film.\n\nShah Rukh Khan is getting ready for his daughter Suhana Khan‘s first big movie called King. He’s pulling out all the stops by involving top-notch directors like Siddharth Anand and Sujoy Ghosh. The film is being made under Shah Rukh’s company, Red Chillies Entertainment. Recently, it was reported that Shah Rukh has invested a whopping Rs 200 crore in the film. Now, there’s news about his role in the movie. He’s going to play the part of a don, a big shot in the criminal world, which is why the film is called King. While there were talks about it being inspired by a Hollywood movie called Leon: The Professional, nothing’s confirmed yet.\n\nAccording to the news of Pinkvilla, the source revealed, “Along with Siddharth Anand and Sujoy Ghosh, even the superstar is working hard on every aspect of the film. Together, these three have created a cool, swag character of SRK for King”. Title of the film has been kept as King because the superstar’s character is said to be the ‘king of underworld’.\n\nThis project is very dear to Shah Rukh, and he’s deeply involved in every step of its making alongside directors Anand and Ghosh. Despite earlier rumours of the film being shelved, it’s very much on track. They’ve taken their time with pre-production, and shooting is set to begin in September 2024.\n\nShah Rukh and Suhana are both undergoing intense training for their roles, gearing up for a release by the end of 2025."
