        "text": "Maharaja is the warm, genteel actor Vijay Sethupathi’s 50th film. We know this, not from IMDb, but from “VJS 50” splashed in the film’s trailer, poster, opening credits! I wonder if that number separately includes the Hindi and Tamil versions of Sriram Raghavan’s equally smart, suspense-thriller, Merry Christmas (2024). I watched both versions in a theatre, mildly bemoaning a missed opportunity. Merry Christmas, in Tamil, could’ve so easily been set in Chennai (for the exterior sequences), with the same cast. The story’s roughly the same, anyway. It felt odd for characters to be interacting in Tamil, all over again, in Mumbai. Almost as odd to find Anurag Kashyap in Maharaja, mouthing words dubbed by someone else in Tamil, while even his lips don’t sync with lines on screen, on occasion. Which was okay for, say, a cameo in Loki’s Leo (2023) for Kashyap (AK vs AK, Ghoomketu)—who’s been quietly building a parallel acting career, along with a well-known filmography as director, of course. Maharaja is ironically his first film to surpass Rs 100 crore in footfalls! Wherein Sethupathi plays the eponymous lead/hero—Kashyap as Selvam, is the main villain. Nothing feels even slightly sloppy about the film, otherwise; written, directed by Vellore-born Nithilan Saminathan, 42. I missed catching Maharaja at a theatre, without regretting it much, to be honest. Knowing that it was killing it at the box-office. And that, more often than not, could signify a pulpy Tamil actioner, with OTT stunts and loud background score—simply competing with the chaos and cacophony inside the crowded cinema. Some of that is true for Maharaja. But the movie (now on Netflix) holds your attention, through and through, not so much for its genre tropes, as its sharp writing—that draws you in, first, with a question as elemental as what/who is Lakshmi? Lakshmi is a dustbin… Full column link in first comment👇🏽\n\nThe most peculiar wedding I’ve attended (obviously for work) was of a male movie star, with multiple generations in Mumbai showbiz, which explained his Bollywood guests. He was, however, getting married into a family of bureaucrats (if I’m not mistaken). Upon entering the five-star venue then, I was hit by a surreal pandemonium among the bride’s star-struck invitees—totally running around crazy, flashing their phones at the groom’s incoming famous guests! I don’t think they cared at all for the marrying couple, who are inevitably chief guests at their own wedding; no? The only other times you’re publicly the centre of such attention is probably at your birth, death—neither of which you’ll know—and the birthdays between! The best weddings we’ve been to (for pleasure, of course) is of friends, chiefly surrounded by other select friends, and the groom and bride’s families. With closest buddies, conventional wisdom suggests you stick to company that’s not furthest ahead in their (social/economic) station in life. Or you do, and it probably helps with professional success, of course—but it could leave you unhappy, if ever made aware of your own place in an imagined hierarchy. Unless you were friends forever (school/college/childhood), or before they skyrocketed, so to say. Then, it doesn’t matter, and you feel proud, save reasons to feel otherwise. Social equals generally guarantee emotional ease. In South Asia, sadly for some (who can’t afford it), a shaadi, as a party for social display, is as much about flex, as it is about friends & fam. You may’ve noticed this, increasingly so, with your own friends & fam! Was the months-long wedding of industrialist Anant Ambani, 29—with Nita, an indefatigable event-planner for a loving mom; and the genteel, generous Mukesh, as dad—then, an anomaly?

Which is the bit when the hero, in this case, an Air Force trainee, must fly soonest to meet his father in his village, who’s likely on death-bed. The hero is at the ticket counter. There are no economy seats left in the airline. The next flight is only a couple of days ahead. He must buy a business class ticket, then—to hop on to the only hope he has, to see his dad, the soonest. He begs others in the line to borrow some money for a business class ticket. This is the trigger, apparently, for why the protagonist in this picture, subsequently, aspires to build an airline that India’s poorest can afford! Only, that there is absolutely no grain of truth to the anecdote above—inspired by the life of ex-Army man, later serial entrepreneur, Captain GR Gopinath. As it is, Sarfira is the story of the same Sir, phir se—in the sense, that for all intents and purposes, a nearly scene-for-scene remake of Soorarai Pottru (2020), in Tamil, by the repeated director, Sudha Kongara. Here—the Hindi fictional avatar, Vir Jagannath Mhatre (Akshay Kumar), is from the interiors of Maharashtra. There—as Nedumaaran Rajangam (Suriya), he belonged to Tamil Nadu. Capt Gopinath is originally from Karnataka. I’m unsure why, then, is the low-cost airline he starts, on screen, still Air Deccan!

Top levers of the latter are mostly controlled by people with origins in Andhra (under Madras Presidency, during British rule). Since forever and even now, pre-independence ‘Nizam’ and ‘Andhra’ are considered two separate distribution territories in Indian film trade. Telugu, as the language—of cinema, included—still unites Telangana and Andhra Pradesh, split into two states, in 2014. Telugu movies, in fact, mainly came out of Chennai, up until the 1980s. That’s when united Andhra’s superstar-turned-CM, NT Rama Rao, invited his film folk to set up their industry in Hyderabad. Which explains hot addresses, Jubilee/Banjara Hills, that blossomed with Hyderabad’s Film Nagar; built from scratch in the ’80s-’90s. The history of Telugu cinema since—that’s pretty much surpassed Chennai’s film production—in terms of top producers and superstars, has primarily swung around five or six family trees, related by blood or matrimony. Chiefly, Daggubati-Akkineni, Allu-Konidela families, among others, led by patriarchs Ramanaidu, Nageswara Rao, Chiranjeevi… It’s taken me sometime to grasp this much about Hyderabad’s film industry, at the national forefront, lately. Especially, figuring out who’s related to whom, and how everybody’s inevitably related! I wished to learn more from Hyderabad films’ father-figure, Allu Aravind, himself son of prolific comic actor, Allu Ramalingaiah, dad to ‘pan-India’ star Allu Arjun, brother-in-law of ‘megastar’ Chiranjeevi, hence Ram Charan’s uncle… He’s wrapped up 50 years as top producer—having debuted with Bantrothu Bharya (1974). Only, the delightfully warm, Aravind, 75, is reluctant to even delve deep into his own filmmaking journey. This conversation is before a live audience at the South India Film Festival in Hyderabad👇🏽 Link in first comment.\n\nBack in the mid-’90s, filmmaker Nikhil Nagesh Bhat—a Bihari, of Maharashtrian ancestry—used to regularly take the ‘Bombay Junta’ Express, from his hometown, Patna, to Pune, where he was studying, then. On one such “36-40-hour ride”, Bhat found his train stranded at a desolate spot, way off the scheduled Prayagraj, in the morning. Cops had entered the compartment. The AC two-tier coach, next-door, had got fully looted, over the night. Danapur Cantonment neighbours Patna, which explains the number of soldiers on the train, who regretted not having known about the burglary. They would’ve done something about it, otherwise! Bhat tells me this incident somehow remained stuck in his subconscious, once he got down to script a pure, action-genre movie, in 2016. And that somewhat equals Kill (2024), on Ranchi-Delhi, Rajdhani Express—probably the only Indian, all-out actioner that, as we speak, has been picked up by John Wick director, Chad Stahelski, for a Hollywood remake, with Lionsgate. This is besides premiering with a ‘people’s choice award’ at the 2023 Toronto film festival’s much-loved Midnight Madness section, along with a fairly wild festival run, thereafter. ‘Midnight’ being film-fest euphemism for a temperamentally more public-friendly, ‘masala movies’, if you may. Well before its theatrical release (July 5), I watched Kill with assorted ‘Bombay junta’—potential exhibitors, select fanboys/girls—visibly lighting up, unabashedly clapping, on occasion, to the lethal, gruesome, blood-spluttering fest, that hits a train, on the sixth minute of the movie, and carries on for its 100-minute running time; non-frickin’-stop! Instantly, I could tell, you gotta watch this with a crowd—or don’t bother, at all. What’s it about action that seems to so draw us into the movies? Catharsis apart, I guess, it’s the same way we enjoy spectator sport—apart from the skill, as a proxy for war, that we hope none have to fight, in real life (IRL)! Also… Column link in 1st comment👇🏽\n\nWhile on screen only for brief but effective bits, Amitabh Bachchan, 81, plays an eight-feet tall Ashwatthama, aged 6,000 years plus, in Kalki 2898 AD. Which, from our basic reading of Mahabharat means he’s immortal, although looking almost mummified! You also don’t need Devdutt Patnaik-grade knowledge of ancient Indian texts to know that Kalki refers to the final and still anticipated, saviour avatar of Lord Vishnu. Of which Lord Krishna was one—having fought with the Pandavas against Kauravas’ army, with Ashwatthama in it, in the battle of Kurukshetra. This film starts with the Mahabharat, and a younger version of Bachchan, which made me wonder if that gent was an AI image, or simply an actor with looks matching the superstar! The hero here is, one, Bhairava, many millennia later, given to gentle buffoonery. Much like the ditsy Deadpool with deadpan humour, if you may. For all the context-setting, with mythology posing as history, it’s this lead character you learn nothing about—leaving you scratching your head, on occasion, up until the end of this futuristic, super-hero cum dystopian, sci-fi, alternate reality. What’s important, from the audience’s perspective, is that the badass, bounty-hunter Bhairava, with immeasurable super-powers, is actor Prabhas. Even self-referencing the number of his “rebel fans” in the theatre, since he’s the anointed, Telugu Rebel Star, after all. He’s introduced with an action sequence underlaid by a track that goes from devotional, Punjabi hip-hop to western jazz/classical. That flex was, in fact, my initial apprehension stepping into the hall. Given Prabhas’s pictures that I’ve groaned through since Baahubali! To be clear on that account: Kalki 2898 AD > Radhe Shyam > Adipurush > Saaho > Salaar. But even more importantly with Kalki, and which is rarest for a film that goes on for three hours straight: second half > first half! Full review link in first comment👇🏽’Kalki baat purani!’\n\nI hadn’t heard of the Maharaj Libel Case, 1862, even when on my way to catch the press screening of the film on it. In fact, I’d confused Maharaj with another movie, Maharaja, releasing in theatres the same weekend. Further confounded by an invitation from Yash Raj Films (YRF), while the movie is a Netflix production; meaning, to drop exclusively on the OTT platform. Maharaj is probably the first YRF movie to go directly online—“introducing Junaid Khan”, as in superstar Aamir’s son—shrouded in such state-level secrecy, that there were no teasers, let alone trailers, for the picture, before release. Yet, basis a few news clips online about Maharaj, given nobody had seen even snippets of the movie—eight businessmen from Ahmedabad, and a few others, claiming to represent the Pushtimarg sect, took offence to the unseen picture, moving multiple courts to stop its release. They’d sued the government, along with the content creators involved. This isn’t uncommon in a country, where barbers have formed an association to alter title of the Shah Rukh Khan movie Billu Barber to Billu (2009), or Censor Board chief Sharmila Tagore has nearly lost her job once, because of the word ‘mochi’, deemed casteist slur, in a song (in Aaja Nachle; 2007). A local court in Bombay trashed this, ironically ‘new Maharaj Libel Case’ on Day One itself. Gujarat High Court actually stayed the movie’s release. What could anybody find objectionable in it—were people defending the sex-pest Jadunathji Maharaj, over a century and half after the fellow’s carnal escapades within his community? He wasn’t, surprisingly, punished for his own crimes—having filed a defamation case against journalist Karsan Das Mulji, instead! Gujarat HC Judge Sangeeta Vishen—the only person, apart from a movie critic, to opine on a movie, for a living, here—watched and let the movie Maharaj pass, without any suggested cuts. My bright li’l cousin Ketki Jha (with senior advocate Jal Unwalla) won this case for Netflix. The petitioners had cherrypicked lines from the long, original, 1862 Maharaj Libel Case verdict to cite how Sanskrit was named a “dead language”, with stuff said about Krishna’s rasleela, by the British judge, then. The movie is admittedly based on the case. Those lines would reappear on screen. Not true. What clinched it for Ketki & co at Gujarat HC was the petitioners withholding a crucial fact. That the film was based on an existing, 2013 book, by Saurabh Shah. Which is also to win on a technicality, given books, in general, get away with a lot more than movies. Correct assumption for India is that nobody reads. Either way, the film, directed by Siddharth P Malhotra, finally made it to Netflix. How did I first watch Maharaj, at a preview, in a packed hall (that it isn’t intended for)? Frankly, as a ‘maha bore’! How about the second time on? Column link in 1st comment👇🏽Film that’s important, needn’t be the most interesting; some context-setting certainly sets it apart\n\nSo, there is the college girl (Pashmina Roshan) in this film, who’s kissed her ex’s BFF (Rohit Saraf) who, in turn, has also been her bestie, forever. Both make the moment appear accidental—as if two people can ever kiss, without it being mutual, after all. Whether the retreating peck on the lip was the guy, or the girl, making the first move—that’s the conflict at the heart of this young-adult romance! And the reason I enjoyed this movie. For, what is teenage, if not full of such trivial issues we consider to be monumental crises. Something that blows up into even more serious-sounding ‘First World problems’, as we get older. This picture, Ishq Vishk Rebound, reflects this really well, and rather warmly. What’s Rebound in the title? I guess a way to instantly get over someone is to get under somebody else! That’s a rebound—perhaps crudely put. Unlike this film, that’s so totally PG-13, with everyone on first base, that I wonder if it adequately captures the lives and loves of the hormonal young at some Spencer College, in Dehradun, 2024. That Spencer College, if I’m not mistaken, was actually Bombay’s Sophia Polytechnic campus in the OG Ishq Vishk (2003), that this film is an offshoot of—produced by TIPS, essentially a music label. How does this Ishq Vishk compare to the earlier one? Full review link, Ishk Vishq Rebound: https://lnkd.in/d3ctk45P"
