        "text": "There is still time to register for the first-of-its-kind collaborative summit entitled The Intersection of Agriculture and Competitive Statecraft organized by Mississippi State University and Arizona State University at the Cornerstone Headquarters in Washington DC, July 31-August 1! Keith Coble and Ryan Shaw. I can promise some really provocative conversations, an incredible lineup of speakers and panelists but above all, a stellar lineup for the session I’m organizing: Technology and Agricultural Competitive State Craft Panel: The role of technology to further agricultural competitive statecraft. This session will be moderated by none other than Robert (Bob) Sharp and will feature Chris Ogier from Sanborn Mapping, Kim Murphy from Airbus US Space & Defense, Inc., Mike Bennett from ICEYE, KC Kroll from Descartes Labs and last but not least, Kate van Dam from SkyFi ! The screenshot from our planning meeting doesn’t do justice to the excitement we felt in our virtual room yesterday as we planned this session with Wesley MacCuish, but we’re way better in reality! How often do you active-serving and retired state senators and other policy makers, academics and, importantly, representatives from cutting-edge technology companies together in one room to talk about the future of food security and competitive statecraft? I’ll let you answer this! Registration is still open and can be found here: https://lnkd.in/ethREzhg #MaroonResearch #collaboration #PublicPrivatePartnerships #MississippiState\n\nRegistration is open for an Association of the U.S. Army Hot Topic focused on cyber and information advantage. Scheduled for July 2 at AUSA headquarters in Arlington, Virginia, the daylong Hot Topic will feature a keynote by James Rubin, special envoy and coordinator for the U.S. Department of State’s Global Engagement Center. Young Bang, principal deputy assistant Army secretary for acquisition, logistics and technology ASA(ALT) ; Maj. Gen. Paul Stanton, commander of the U.S. Army Cyber Center of Excellence; Peter Singer, strategist with New America and founder and managing partner of Useful Fiction; and many other leaders in the field also are expected to speak. #ReadMore and #Register: https://loom.ly/mSIcrZ4 #Cybersecurity #USArmy #inperson #hottopic #globalengagement #centerofexcellence #arlington\n\n“Cognitive warfare is not a new concept; the United States and its allies use the term loosely to discuss information and cyberspace operations. However, China’s views on the significance of cognitive warfare to future operations, as well as recent publications by the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) regarding its application, provide perspective on China’s expectations for success.” — Charles Davis Cognitive Warfare: China’s Effort to Ensure Information Advantage — MI Professional Bulletin https://lnkd.in/gnvQgdT4 PLA Social Media Warfare and the Cognitive Domain — The Jamestown Foundation https://lnkd.in/g75t5sQt Exploring the Implications of Generative AI for Chinese Military Cyber-Enabled Influence Operations: Chinese Military Strategies, Capabilities, and Intent — RAND https://lnkd.in/gfECQRcp PLA Social Media Warfare and the Cognitive Domain — RAND https://lnkd.in/g3SrYmPz\n\nAn amazing few days amongst some big thinkers in the Information Warfare community. The urgency of the contest was not lost amongst the attendees… but many, many more conversations will be needed to achieve the groundswell required. The positive; through conferences like Information Power Institute Australia this is starting to occur and the intellectual capacity of academics like Andrew Whiskeyman, PhD, Peter W. Singer and Stephen Hunnewell is to be applauded. Absolutely loved my time moderating the Intelligence ISR Innovation and Capabilities panel. Bravo Anthony Allen and Glen E. on a huge win for Team Australia!"
