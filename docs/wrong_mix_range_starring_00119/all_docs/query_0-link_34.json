        "text": "All the people in the world who I look up-to in this world except my parents are somewhat connected to the world of Business and Entrepreneurship. All Except One Man!!\n\nThe Man is none other than the King Khan himself, Shah Rukh Khan!\n\nI’m someone who hasn’t watched even 50% of all his films and yet have probably watched 80% of all his available interviews. Isn’t is weird? Why do I do that?\n\nThat’s because I closely follow a lot of successful people and try to learn and figure out the finer things which has led them to such astronomical success. Out of all the entrepreneur’s, this movie star (Actually it’s a sin to call him just a movie star) stood out for me, and I’m a guy who admires entrepreneur’s like anything!\n\nBehind all the Silly jokes and the witty Banter, lies a very knowledgeable Legend of a person, studying whom, we can find not only a lot of business lessons, but also lessons to succeed in any walk of life!\n\nHere is a look at some of the lessons that I’ve picked up while studying and following this man.\n\nLessons which makes Shah Rukh Khan the King Of Bollywood:\n\n1. First and most important of all, his ability to laugh at himself. His preaches this saying that “Learn to not take yourself too seriously”! and practices it as well.\n\n2. His ability to respect men and especially women equally. Whether it’s his late mother, his wife, his daughter or all the beautiful ladies that he works with. Everyone loves him for this quality of his.\n\n3. His ability to stay humble. Many a stars have said this interviews that he’s the warmest, humblest and the most rooted guy ever. Whether asking an interviewer’s crew if they had dinner or it’s opening the doors for his friends at various places; it’s his humbleness as a superstar that has made him stand out.\n\n4. His unbelievable confidence in himself. While many consider this as arrogance, I believe it’s this mentality of not paying any attention to any competition other than himself has what made him unique. As he said once in ‘Aap Ki Adalat’ that “I never compare myself with anyone. Anyone can be the greatest but I’m a just a little bit better than you.”\n\n5. His astounding energy. This man has been working for more than three decades now. His average working hours are somewhere between 15-18 hours every day. Ya! I know! Even I’m in awe.\n\n6. His ability to communicate and charm others. Everyone has said that when Shah Rukh Khan talks to you, you will feel as though you’re the most important person in his life.\n\n7. His openness about his insecurities. Many a times has he spoken about his loneliness and depression despite being such a Global Star. But guess what, this man just keeps smiling no matter what!\n\n8. His ability to turn what was once his disadvantage into an advantage. Whether it’s his looks which were not right according to some people or his hair which we’re apparently too big! And guys, I can’t stress this fact about his hair more strongly; I WOULD KILL FOR THAT HAIR!\n\n9. His sense of humour. We all know just how witty and humorous he is. It is a fact which proves that inside resides an extremely intelligent brain!\n\n10. His openness about his love for money and fame. He taught us that it’s not at all a bad thing to desire a better life for yourself, to want a bigger house or a fancy car. It’s just that it shouldn’t be the main motive. The main motive should always be to try and be better at your work every day.\n\n11. His Love for his work and dedication for his work. As he himself said it once and I quote “I’ll do anything just to get a shot right!”\n\n12. His Genuine respect and love for his family. He sleeps for a maximum of 4-5 hours but makes sure to spend some time with his wife and children. Family has, is and always be a number one priority for him.\n\n13. His Knowledge! If you deep dive into any of his interviews and you’ll notice a very knowledgeable and a very open person. My Favourite Interview is the IThink Conference 2012!\n\n14. His business acumen of course! Come on! I had to bring in this somewhere. He has engaged in various entrepreneurial ventures; Whether it’s his own production house, his brands and endorsements, performances, etc, the man is everywhere. He is also the Brand ambassador of Dubai. He is the Second richest actor in the world with an estimated net-worth of more than $600Million and known as “Brand SRK” for a reason.\n\n15. Lastly two of his favourite off-screen quotes which has stayed with me.\n\nI. “Everyone works very hard till they get their big break. I worked even harder now that I’ve gotten the success, that’s why I’m me”\n\nII. “First become Rich, then become a Philosopher!”\n\nThese were the reasons apart from his acting skills which according to me makes him who he is today. The undisputed king of Bollywood!"
