        "text": "Q: Zid is a bold and an erotic thriller? What made you co-produce Zid (with Anubhav Sinha)?\n\nZid is more than just a bold, erotic thriller. It is an edgy film with a heady mix of thrills, romance, revenge, sensuality and soul stirring music. Under the layering you will find a very resonant emotional core. The film will keep you hooked till the credits roll in the end. Thriller genre is relatively virgin territory in Bollywood. Hence, both Anubhav and I decided to go ahead with Zid as it offered a chance to explore something new.\n\nQ: Tell us your journey in the industry?\n\nIt’s been a long journey, a journey that I am proud of! Been quite a joyride and loved every moment of it. It all started out with my days of being a journalist. It was the movies that inspired me to get into journalism in the first place. A few years into the job, I became the youngest editor of a film magazine. Post my stint in journalism, I took up screenplay writing and wrote a host of scripts for both films (Om Shanti Om, Billu Barber, Ra.One, Rangrezz, Kya Kool Hai Hum) and television (Kahiin To Hoga, Kya Hadsaa Kya Haqeeqat, K. Street Pali Hill, Kahin Kisi Roz) after which I did a stint with Sahara One as Channel Head. All this did not stop my love for books and writing them. So I penned four books too. The official biography of Shah Rukh Khan “Still Reading Khan”, The Making Of Ashoka, The Making Of Om Shanti Om and Shah Rukh Can.\n\nThe next step in the evolution was in 2013. I got into film production with Anubhav, who has been a friend for a while, and probably the best partner I could have wished for. Zid will be our third film together and the journey so far has been a memorable one. Hope it continues the same way.\n\nQ: How seriously do you take critics?\n\nLike all of us, critics too are doing their job. Their job is to watch a film and dissect the cinematic piece based on their personal preferences. What’s important is it’s their personal viewpoint. But in the larger scheme of things they do their job. Whether they do their job well or not? Is exactly as debatable as we the filmmakers know their job or no? The power sometimes goes to their head and they start making the review a showcase of their own writing skills. That’s where the problem lies. They should concentrate on the content of the film. Rather than their power of puns, humour and smart lines.\n\nThe critics have early access to films and have their reviews dished out on the eve of the release. Especially in case of small films, the unsuspecting moviegoer would look for a sense of guidance in the reviews. I wouldn’t say that the critic’s word is the end all but their verdict makes an impact in skewing the choice of many fence sitting viewers. With the advent of social media, the reach of the critics has spread beyond the print media and has zoomed into the cyberspace.\n\nWith Anubhav Sinha\n\nQ: You're writing sex-comedy Mastizaade that has Sunny Leone. How was it working on the script?\n\nWriting for Mastizaade has been a rollercoaster ride. It’s been a fun experience. Working with Milap (Milap Zaveri, director of Mastizaade) is always a pleasure. It has been probably the most fun I’ve had while working on a screenplay. The creative meetings with Milap were more like laughter sessions than anything else. The script has turned out really well.\n\nThis is the first time I have written something for Sunny Leone and it’s been a terrific experience. She has a double role in the film. The challenge was to create two distinct characters for her. Milap was very happy with the way the script has panned out. The film is almost on the verge of completion-it has shaped up really well.\n\nQ: You mostly write commercial films...\n\nTags like ‘Commercial’ and ‘Off-beat’ cinema are creations of the media. As a writer, I feel it is unfair to the story to segregate it financial terms. I have dabbled in all sorts of genres, ranging from love stories to period dramas, from socio-political subjects to sex-comedies. I work on stories, which I feel the audience would want to see on screen. I don’t think of them as commercial or non-commercial. Whether I am writing or producing, there is just one rule that I follow when it comes to films and that is – Entertainment! People will come to the theatres only if they feel that there is entertainment in store for them. We as filmmakers need to understand the psyche of the audience and dish out films that would entertain them.\n\nAs a writer I am open to writing anything, including ‘something serious’ as far as it appeals to the audience. I guess Billu, Rangrezz, two of the films that I have written was a subject that dealt with issues. I believe as a writer, one should not confine oneself to a particular genre.\n\nQ: When will you jump to direction?\n\nI’ve been asked this question on many occasions but I still don’t have the perfect answer to it! Direction is a different game. A director is required to live and breathe the project for a very long time, right from the inception of the idea to the day the film releases or even beyond. I am not sure if I have that much patience in me. I surely don’t have that much time as of now! There is already too much on my plate. There might come a day in future when I decide to take that plunge but as of now, I have no such plans as of now.\n\nWith Shah Rukh Khan and Ekta Kapoor\n\nQ: Tell us about your equation with Shah Rukh Khan and Ekta Kapoor?\n\nThere are a few people with whom you have a professional relationship, there are a few with whom you gel on personal levels and then there are handful of people with whom you share a relationship that can’t be described in words. That’s the kind of relationship I share with Shah Rukh and Ekta. They both hold a special place in my heart and in my life.\n\nMy association with Shah Rukh began during my journalism days. There was a time when all the interviews with Shah Rukh for the magazine I was with, would be done by me. And one day, I decided I had to write a story about SRK and that was how the genesis of his biography – ‘Still Reading Khan’ came about. It was the most special gift I could give a person, who has always inspired me and always stood by me and shown faith in my talent. It’s been a great bond so far, Insha Allah it will continue to remain so.\n\nEkta and I have been friends for the longest time now. She is one of the sweetest people that I know of. She is someone to whom I can pour my heart out to and vice-versa. She has single handedly changed the face of Indian Television. From being known as Jituji’s daughter to making a name for herself, not only in India, but also at the worldwide level is a great feat. We have worked together on innumerable projects and I guess we have an enviable success ratio.\n\nShah Rukh and Ekta are the only people who have been able to get me in front of the screen and actually make me \"act\".\n\nQ: What would be the title of your biography?\n\nAs indulgent as it sounds, I would go by twitter handle, @Shiekhspear. I hope the purists can see it as a simple word play. I can’t think quickly enough which parts of my life have to be weeded out for the public. But I would want to approach the biography different from a structural point of view, something different from birth to death progression. But now that you have asked me this question- the thinking process has already begun.\n\nQ: Which is that one film you really loved writing?\n\nI have enjoyed writing all my films. Had I not, I wouldn’t have worked on them. If I HAVE to select one, then it would be Om Shanti Om. Both Farah and I went berserk writing this one. It is probably the most ‘filmy’ screenplay that I have written till date. The kind of love, adulation and response that I got for OSO was something else. I still remember that Farah and I discussed the film while we were digging into our dosas at an Udipi restaurant in Bandra! From ideation to writing it on paper, it was a crazy ride. I also happened to write a book on the making of OSO titled, ‘The Making of Om Shanti Om’. That’s one film, which I look back with fond memories.\n\nQ: One dream not fulfilled yet...\n\nAllah has been kind enough to bless me generously to accomplish the little joys I had set out for myself. Cribbing about an unfulfilled dream will be nothing less than ungrateful. Being content and always seeking happiness is one of the crazily simple mantras in life.\n\nQ: Though potboilers are doing well at the box-office, critics never seem to like them. How do you react?\n\nThe need to react is spared, as the comments are not aimed at the persona level. Like I said previously, critics, like everyone else are just doing their job. They review it as they see it. I wouldn’t say that they pan all potboilers or money spinning films but yes, the trend that we see now days suggests that a few critics are a bit harsh on films that star the big names of the industry. But then, most of these big stars have such a loyal fan base that, it doesn’t matter to them what the critics say. At the end of the day it’s the audience that decides the fate of the film at the box-office. I am sure even the critics realize that.\n\nQ: Your favourite screenplay writer?\n\nOver the last few years or so there has been such a huge influx of writers and most of them are really good. There are many scriptwriters whom I personally like. It’s impossible for me to pick one or two. The younger generation of writers is really impressive. A few names that come to my mind are – Milap Zaveri, Shakun Batra, Jaideep Sahni, Imtiaz Ali and Ayan Mukherjee."
