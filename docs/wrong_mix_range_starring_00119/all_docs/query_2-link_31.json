        "text": "2. • Born: 2 November 1965,New Delhi, India • Residence: Mumbai, Maharastra,India • Other names: -SRK -King Khan -King Of Bollywood -The Badshah Of Bollywood • Occupation: -Actor -Producer -Television Presenter -Honor Of KKR, Red Chillies Entertainment • Years Active: 1988-Present • Spouse : Gauri Khan (1991-Present) • Children: 2\n\n3. Early Life and Background  His father, Taj Mohammed Khan, a Pathan, was an Indian independence activist  His mother, Lateef Fatima, was the adopted daughter of Major General Shah Nawaz Khan of the Janjua Rajput clan, who served in the Indian National Army  Grown up in Rajendra Nagar neighbourhood of Delhi,Khan attended St. Columba's School  Graduated with a bachelor's degree in economics and Masters Degree in Mass Communications at Jamia Millia Islamia  later opted out to pursue a career in Bollywood.He also attended the National School of Drama in Delhi.\n\n4. Acting career and Breakthrough  Khan studied acting under the mentorship of theatre director Barry John at Delhi's \"Theatre Action Group\" (TAG)  Khan's first starring role was in Lekh Tandon’stelevision series Dil Dariya, but due to production delays, the 1988 television series, Fauji was his television debut  Appeared in Aziz Mirza's Circus(1989)  played a minor role in the made-for-television English- language film, In Which Annie Gives it Those Ones(1989)  In 1990, Khan shifted base to Mumbai and received his first film offer with Hema Malini's directorial debut Dil Aashna Hai  Deewana (1992), Opposite Rishi Kapoor and Divya Bharti released first and was a Hit\n\n5. Achievements  14 Filmfare Awards from 30 nominations  8 Filmfare Best Actor Award wins make him the most awarded Bollywood actor , tied only with Dilip Kumar  In 2005,Government of India honoured him with the Padma Shri for his contributions towards Indian cinema.  In 2011, the Los Angeles Times called him \"the world's biggest Movie star  In 2008, Newsweek named him one of the 50 most powerful people in the world  In 1997, Best Indian Citizen Award  In 2005, Rajiv Gandhi Award for Excellence in the Field of Entertainment  Wax Statue at Madame Tussauds In London\n\n6.  As Jab Tak Hai Jaan looks to somehow trundle past 100 crores at the domestic box office, one wonders what’s wrong with Shah Rukh Khan.  With constantly increasing number of screens and ticket prices, every big film is likely to achieve that.  Rivals are creating new and newer records and earning audience’s love, his films seem to be failing on both counts  Overseas earnings which are mostly due to a wider release as compared to other films.  Being happy with overseas numbers without making any impact on the audiences back home is quite meaningless as far as somebody’s impact as a star is concerned\n\n7. TOTAL RELEASES: 51 Super Hit/Blockbuster 17 Hit 6 Average 8 Flop 20 Overseas Hit from above 51 21 Note: Hits include My Name Is Khan, Ra.One and Don 2 on the basis of their overall collection and Flops don’t include his guest appearances. All flops have Shah Rukh as a lead or as an important character in a multi-starrer. There can be a disagreement on one or two films but more or less this is the picture.\n\n8. The Mixed Bag (1990-2001)  1993: Yash Chopra’s Darr  Baazigar where he once again played a character with negative shades,Hit  1994: Anjam and Raam Jaane ,Flop  1994:Kabhi Haa, Kabhi Na, Not a big success  1995: Karan-Arjun alongside Salman Khan, Hit  1997: Dilwale Dulhaniya Le Jaayenge,Universal blockbuster  1997 : English Babu, Desi Mem and Chahat,Flop  1997: Dil Toh Pagal Hai, Pardes,Hit  1998: Kuch Kuch Hota Hai, Smashing Hit followed by Flop Duplicate and Dil Se  2000: Josh, Moderately successful followed by Phir Bhi Dil Hai Hindustani, unsuccessful  Yash Chopra banner for rescue and Mohabbatein released in the same year was a super duper hit.\n\n9.  2001: Started with flop Ashoka but it was followed by blockbuster Kabhi Khushi Kabhi Gham  His record in this period is as follows – 2002 – Devdas (Hit), 2003 – Chalte Chalte (Hit), Kal Ho Na Ho (Hit), 2004 – Main Hoon Na (Hit), Veer Zaara (Super hit), Swades (Flop), 2005 –Paheli (Flop), 2006 – Kabhi Alvida Na Kehna (Hit), Don (Hit), 2007 – Chak De!

These eight years can be termed as a truly Golden phase in Shah Rukh’s career. • Hits on Overseas basis:-  My Name is Khan  Ra.One  Don 2  Jab Tak Hai Jaan\n\n10.  An eye on the overseas market  After DDLJ, a trend to please NRI audiences started  Stories were related to people living in foreign countries or returning from these countries  MNIK was aimed at making a splash internationally  Ra.One also seemed to have been made with a dream of making it a popular franchise like Superman and Spiderman  Don 2 was a Hollywood style action-thriller totally devoid of emotions that Indian audience cannot do without."
