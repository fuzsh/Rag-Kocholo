        "text": "Shah Rukh Khan has taken some time off after Zero and it's because he says his heart just isn't in it at the moment.\n\nThe Bollywood actor was earlier rumoured to have signed on to the Rakesh Sharma biopic, Saare Jahan Se Accha, as well as Sanjay Leela Bhansali's Sahir Ludhianvi biopic, but now Khan has put all rumours to rest.\n\n“I have no film with me right now. I am not working on any film,\" he said.\n\n\"Usually what happens is when your one film is coming to an end, you begin work on your next film and I get involved within 3-4 months. But this time I am just not feeling like... My heart doesn't allow me to..\" added Khan. \"I just felt that I should rather take time out, watch films, listen to stories and read more books.\n\nIt's not just to unwind but also to give time to his family, he explained. \"Even my kids are in their college stage... my daughter is going to college and my son is about to finish his studies. So I just want to spend more time with my family.\"\n\nLet's see when the King of Bollywood decides to come back to the big screen."
