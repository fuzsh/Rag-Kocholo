Shah Rukh Khan’s daughter, Suhana Khan, will also be in the movie, making it a highly anticipated project. This announcement has excited fans, as it brings together big names from Bollywood for a thrilling story.\n\nAbhishek’s upcoming film features Shah Rukh\n\nAmitabh Bachchan posted on X (formerly twitter) about his son’s upcoming film. He quoted a fanpage’s post.\n\n“Those Who have seen Abhishek Sir’s in Breathe into the Shadows, Raavan and BB, Will know what level of Performance as a negative role he can give. Never ever doubt him. @juniorbachchan”\n\nAmitabh captioned the post with “all the best Abhishek .. It is TIME !!!”\n\nThe production of “King” will be helmed by Siddharth Anand, the renowned director behind the blockbuster “Pathaan.” Siddharth’s involvement adds an extra layer of excitement, given his reputation for delivering high-octane, visually stunning films.\n\nThis project marks a reunion for Abhishek Bachchan and Shah Rukh Khan, who previously shared the screen in “Happy New Year.” Their chemistry and performances in the past have been well-received, raising expectations for their upcoming collaboration in “King.” This reunion, combined with a promising plot and a well-known director, has generated a lot of excitement among fans.\n\nAccording to the sources, “Abhishek is an actor whose full potential has yet to be fully realized. He has the ability to astonish audiences when given complex roles. King presents him in an out-and-out negative role for the first time in such a large-scale commercial movie, and he is sure to make a significant impact with his performance. The Jr. Bachchan was surprised when he was offered this role but accepted it immediately, intrigued by the depth of his character. It’s a special role, and Siddharth Anand has grand plans to present Abhishek in a manner audiences have never seen before.”"
