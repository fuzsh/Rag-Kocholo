        "text": "'Dunki' trailer is finally out. Featuring Shah Rukh Khan in the lead alongside Taapsee Pannu, Vicky Kaushal, and others, the trailer offers glimpses into the much-discussed plot of the film, unveiling more beautiful moments from this heartwarming story. Directed by Rajkumar Hirani, the movie is set to release in theatres on December 21, clashing with Prabhas' 'Salaar.\n\n'DUNKI' TRAILER OUT\n\nAfter treating the audience with 'Dunki' Drop 1-the teaser, 'Dunki' Drop 2 'Lutt Putt Gaya' song, and 'Dunki' Drop 3 'Nikle The Kabhi Hum Ghar Se' track, the makers have now released the trailer which is being referred as 'Dunki' Drop 4. The opening scene features SRK aboard a train, setting the tone for the adventure ahead. The video introduces the wonderfully whimsical characters, beginning with Hardy (played by SRK) as he arrives in a picturesque village in Punjab. There, he encounters a group of spirited friends – Manu, Sukhi, Buggu, and Balli, all sharing a common dream of travelling to London in pursuit of better opportunities and a better life for their loved ones back home.\n\nadvertisement\n\nWatch the trailer here:\n\nEncapsulating all the myriad emotions in one frame, this heart-warming tale follows four friends on an extraordinary journey to foreign lands, filled with challenges and life-changing experiences. The trailer beautifully unfolds the layers of friendship and love, taking the audience on a thrilling ride through the Dunki route—the path these friends embark on, to reach their desired destination.\n\nShah Rukh Khan shared the trailer on Instagram and wrote, \"Yeh kahani maine shuru ki thi, Laltu se! Isey khatam bhi main hi karunga... apne Ullu de patthon ke saath. Dunki’s trailer will show you a journey that began with Raju Sir’s vision. It will take you through a madcap ride of friendship, the comedy and tragedy that life is and a nostalgia for home & family.\n\nALL ABOUT 'DUNKI'\n\nA JIO Studios, Red Chillies Entertainment, and Rajkumar Hirani Films presentation, Dunki is produced by Rajkumar Hirani and Gauri Khan. Written by Abhijat Joshi, Rajkumar Hirani, and Kanika Dhillon, the film is slated to release worldwide on 21st December 2023."
