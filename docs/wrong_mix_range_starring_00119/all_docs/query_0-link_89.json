        "text": "2023 turned out to mark some remarkable comebacks in Bollywood. From celebrities who were on a hiatus to many who were yet to deliver a hit after back-to-back flops, theÂ past year marked some impressive comebacks.\n\nLeading the list, actor Shah Rukh Khan delivered not one but three back-to-back blockbusters with Siddharth Anand’sÂ Pathaan, Atlee’sÂ Jawan , and recently, Rajkumar Hirani’sÂ Dunki. Joining him was the actor Salman Khan, creating ripples in the industry with his movies and magnetic charm. While Salman had two releases this year, Tiger 3 was alone enough to mark his comeback.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Khans ruled the box office in 2023, touching similar records at the time of their release. Speaking about the business done by Jawan and Tiger 3 - while Atlee’s film set the box office on fire, receiving a roaring response from the audience, it also turned out to be one of the biggest blockbusters in the history of Indian cinema. However, Tiger 3 couldn’t live up to that mark but did some good business at the box office.\n\nSpeaking on the same lines, filmmaker Sanjay Gupta said that things would have been different if Tiger 3 was released before Jawan.\n\n‘Atlee has set a whole new benchmark’\n\nTaking to his official X handle, the director wrote that things would have worked out differently (apparently better) for Salman Khan’s Tiger 3 if it was released before Jawan, further adding that Atlee had set a whole new benchmark with every scene that he shot in Jawan.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“I strongly feel that had TIGER 3 come before JAWAN things would have been different. Itâs just that Atlee set a whole new benchmark with every scene he shot,” he wrote.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nReacting to his tweet, many shared divided views. While some agreed with him, many didn’t.\n\nJawan and Tiger 3 box office collections\n\nSRK’s second big film post Pathaan- Jawan- which starred Nayanthara, Vijay Sethupathi and Deepika Padukone in lead roles, focused on the emotional journey of a man who goes on to rectify the wrongs in society with the help of a group of women. Made on a budget of Rs 300 crores, the Atlee film made a total of Rs 640.8 crore in its domestic net collections, followed by Rs 1,152 crore in terms of international gross collections.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTiger 3, on the other hand, follows the events of Tiger Zinda Hai and is centred around raw agent Avinash and ISI agent Zoya. The film also featured actor Emraan Hashmi in the role of antagonist.\n\nSalman Khan starrer Tiger 3 was also a hit at the box office and made Rs 284.2 crores in the domestic market and Rs 466 crores globally."
