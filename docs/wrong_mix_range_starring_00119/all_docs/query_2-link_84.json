        "text": "Bollywood may have been impacted by the pandemic due to a lag in shoot schedules, but it’s back on its feet finally. With new releases lined up for every Friday, things have returned to normal for the film industry.\n\nThis means that projects that had been put on hold and kept our favourite stars away from the big screen are releasing in quick succession. Some of the biggest stars have not been seen in theatres for a while and 2023 is their year.\n\nHere are 5 actors who are all set to make a movie comeback in 2023 after a long gap.\n\n1. Shah Rukh Khan\n\nHe may have made a few cameos in 2022 with Laal Singh Chaddha, Rocketry, and Brahmastra, but fans haven’t seen him in a leading role since 2018’s Zero. He will be back with force in Pathaan, which releases on January 25. The buzz around Pathaan is already quite high with the release of its two songs, Jhoome Jo Pathaan and Besharam Rang.\n\n2. Anushka Sharma\n\n2018 was a busy year for Anushka Sharma with four releases — Pari, Sanju, Sui Dhaaga and Zero. Like Shah Rukh Khan, she was also last seen in Zero in a leading role. She did a cameo in Qala, but will next be seen in a leading role in Chakda Xpress for Netflix. The film is a biography of Indian cricketer Jhulan Goswami.\n\n3. Karisma Kapoor\n\nKarisma Kapoor was last seen in 2012’s Dangerous Ishqq as a leading lady. Since then, she’s done cameos and appeared in songs in different movies and a 2020 web-series called Mentalhood on Zee 5. She started shooting for her comeback project in 2022, Brown, which will be directed by Abhinay Deo. though it’s not clear whether this will be a movie or web-series, it’s expected to release sometime this year.\n\n4. Helen"
