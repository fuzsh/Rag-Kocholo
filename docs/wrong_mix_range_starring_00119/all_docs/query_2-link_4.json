        "text": "Shah Rukh Khan filmographyFilm97Television13\n\nShah Rukh Khan is an Indian actor, producer and television personality who works in Hindi films.[1] He began his acting career by playing a soldier in the Doordarshan series Fauji (1988), a role that garnered him recognition and led to starring roles in more television shows. He soon started receiving film offers and had his first release with the romantic drama Deewana (1992), in which he played a supporting part.[4] Khan subsequently played villainous roles in the 1993 thrillers Baazigar and Darr, box office successes that established his career in Bollywood.[5] In 1995, Khan starred opposite Kajol in Aditya Chopra's romance Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge, that became the longest running Indian film of all time. He continued to establish a reputation in romantic roles by playing opposite Madhuri Dixit in Dil To Pagal Hai (1997), and Kajol in the Karan Johar-directed Kuch Kuch Hota Hai (1998) and Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham... (2001).[8]\n\nIn 1999, Khan collaborated with Aziz Mirza and Juhi Chawla to start a production company, Dreamz Unlimited, whose first release was the comedy-drama Phir Bhi Dil Hai Hindustani (2000) starring Khan and Chawla. The film was a commercial failure as was their next production, Aśoka (2001), leading to a setback. His career prospects improved in 2002 when he starred alongside Dixit and Aishwarya Rai in Devdas, a period romance that garnered him critical acclaim. In 2004, he collaborated with his wife Gauri Khan to launch another company, Red Chillies Entertainment, whose first feature was the box office hit Main Hoon Na (2004).[13] Khan's popularity continued to increase in the 2000s as he played the romantic lead opposite younger actresses, most notably Rani Mukerji and Preity Zinta, in several top-grossing productions, including Kal Ho Naa Ho (2003), Veer-Zaara (2004) and Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna (2006).[15][16][17] He also played against type as a NASA scientist in the drama Swades (2004), a hockey coach in the sports film Chak De! India (2007), and an autistic man in the drama My Name Is Khan (2010).[18]\n\nFrom 2007 onwards, Khan began to star opposite a third generation of heroines,[19] most notably Deepika Padukone in Om Shanti Om (2007) and Anushka Sharma in Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi (2008).[20] He went on to co-star with Padukone in the action-comedies Chennai Express (2013) and Happy New Year (2014), and reunited with Kajol in Dilwale (2015), all of which were among the biggest Hindi film grossers of the decade.[21] He then starred alongside Sharma in Jab Harry Met Sejal (2017) and Zero (2018), both of which were commercially unsuccessful.[22] Following a hiatus, Khan made a career comeback with the 2023 action films Pathaan and Jawan, each earning over ₹10 billion (US$120 million) to emerge as his highest-grossing releases.[23][24][25]\n\nWith eight Filmfare Awards for Best Actor, he shares the record for the most wins in the category with Dilip Kumar.[26] Khan has also starred in several non-fiction films that have documented his popularity, including the documentary The Inner and Outer World of Shah Rukh Khan (2005).[27] From 2003 onwards, he has hosted several award ceremonies, including ten Filmfare Awards and six Screen Awards. In addition, he has featured as the host of television game shows Kaun Banega Crorepati (2007) and the talk show TED Talks India (2017–2019).\n\nFilms\n\nKey † Denotes films that have not yet been released\n\nFeature films\n\nDocumentary films\n\nYear Title Role Ref. 2002 Bollywood for Beginners Himself [164] 2005 The Inner and Outer World of Shah Rukh Khan Himself [27] 2010 Living with a Superstar – Shahrukh Khan Himself [165] 2011 Mughal-E-Azam – A Tribute by a son to his father Narrator [166] 2014 Living with KKR Himself [167]\n\nTelevision\n\nAs an actor\n\nYear Title Role Notes Ref. 1988 Fauji Abhimanyu Rai 13 episodes [168]\n\n[169] Dil Dariya Nandu 12 episodes [168] 1989 Umeed Anand Gupta [170] Mahan Karz Kanwar Singh Television film [171] Wagle Ki Duniya Himself Episode: \"Police Station\" [170] 1989–1990 Circus Shekharan 19 episodes [172] 1989 In Which Annie Gives It Those Ones Senior Television film [173]\n\n[174] Doosra Keval Keval 13 episodes [175] 1991 Idiot Pawan Raghurajan 4-part miniseries [176]\n\n[177] 1993 Rajani Himself 2 episodes\n\n[178]\n\n2020 The Forgotten Army - Azaadi Ke Liye Narrator Miniseries [179] Fabulous Lives of Bollywood Wives Himself Reality show; episode 8 [180] 2023 The Romantics Himself Documentary series; episode: \"The Boy from Jalandhar\" [181]\n\nAs a host\n\nYear Title Notes Ref. 2003 48th Filmfare Awards Television special [182] 2004 49th Filmfare Awards [183] 2005 6th International Indian Film Academy Awards [184] 2006 2nd Global Indian Film Awards [185] 2007 52nd Filmfare Awards [186] Kaun Banega Crorepati Game show; season 3 [187] 2008 53rd Filmfare Awards Television special [188] Kya Aap Paanchvi Pass Se Tez Hain?
