        "text": "New Delhi: Bollywood actor Shah Rukh Khan has been rather discreet about his next movie after ‘Dunki’. But in a recent video, he might have accidentally leaked the title of his next film. While Shah Rukh had hinted that there is a project in the making, he’s been coy about the details. Multiple reports have claimed that he is working on a film titled King and it co-stars his daughter, actress Suhana Khan. Although SRK hasn’t confirmed the news, his new video seemingly confirmed the reports.\n\nShah Rukh shared a video with Cannes to congratulate cinematographer Santosh Sivan on receiving the prestigious Pierre Angenieux Excel Lens award at the Cannes Film Festival. While SRK’s message moved fans, many noticed that the script of King was placed on the table beside Shah Rukh. The script featured the title of the film along with a few, unclear details. Soon, the video went viral with many preparing themselves for another blockbuster in the making."
