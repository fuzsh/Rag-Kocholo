        "text": "Shah Rukh Khan (born November 2, 1965, Delhi, India) is an Indian actor known for his powerful screen presence. He is one of the most sought-after Bollywood actors. To his millions of fans worldwide, he is “King Khan.”\n\nAfter graduating with a bachelor’s degree in economics from Hans Raj College, University of Delhi, and beginning a master’s degree in mass communications, Khan dropped out of academic studies to pursue a career in acting. He entered the film industry through work in theater and television. His first acting jobs were in television serials such as Fauji (1988; in the role of a commando) and Circus (1989), which won him instant recognition. Khan lost his father, Meer Taj Mohammad Khan, in 1981, when he was just 15, and his mother, Lateef Fatima Khan, in 1991. He married Gauri Chibber (now Gauri Khan) in 1991 and moved to Mumbai that same year, venturing into Bollywood. His breakthrough movie was Deewana (1992; “Crazy”), and it marked the turning point in his acting career.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nPop Culture Quiz\n\nInitially, Khan’s success was based on his antihero portrayals in Baazigar (1993; “Gambler”) and Darr (1993; “Fear”). He rejected the image of the conventional hero in both films and created his own version of the villain. This is something that can also be witnessed in his later films. In many films, however, he assumed the role of hero and helped create such blockbusters as Dilwale dulhania le jayenge (1995; “The Big-Hearted Will Take Away the Bride”), Karan Arjun (1995), Dil to pagal hai (1997; “The Heart Is Crazy”), Kuch kuch hota hai (1998; Something Is Happening), Devdas (2002), Kal ho naa ho (2003; “Tomorrow May Never Come”), Veer-Zaara (2004), Chak de! India (2007; “Go, India!”), My Name Is Khan (2010), and Jab tak hai jaan (2012; “As Long as I Live”), the last film directed by Yash Chopra. In many of those films, Khan played the role of a sensitive lover or son. He also met success in comedic roles in films such as Chamatkar (1992; “Miracle”), Yes Boss (1997), Duplicate (1998), and Chennai Express (2013). Also noteworthy is his role as the emperor Ashoka in Ashoka the Great (2001). Khan’s other movies include Happy New Year (2014), an action comedy centering on a dance competition, and the crime drama Raees (2017), in which he played a bootlegger. After a hiatus of about four years from playing lead roles in movies, Khan made a comeback with two larger-than-life thrillers in 2023: Pathaan (“Pashtun”) and Jawan (“Soldier”). In Pathaan Khan played an undercover Indian agent who is on a mission to defend his country against a group of terrorists, and in Jawan, a thriller with multiple twists, Khan, in a double role, took on corrupt government officials to rid society of its evils. With these two movies, Khan delivered back-to-back box office hits, breaking many domestic records. Some of the films in which Khan has starred, including Devdas, Chennai Express, and Jawan, have been produced by Red Chillies Entertainment, which Khan cofounded with Gauri Khan, his wife, in 2002."
