        "text": "Filmmaker Vidhu Vinod Chopra recently narrated how actor Sanjay Dutt came on board 'Munna Bhai MBBS', the hit 2003 film which changed Dutt's life for good and revived his sinking career. The filmmaker said that after being released from jail, Dutt was desperate to work. He was ready to do any role and agreed to portray the role of cancer patient Zaheer, which Jimmy Sheirgill later essayed.\n\nadvertisement\n\nHowever, after things with Shah Rukh Khan fell apart, Dutt got to play the lead role of Munna Bhai and the rest is history.\n\nDuring a conversation at the Kellogg Management School, Chopra narrated that he never knew Sanjay Dutt. Still, he announced a film with him because the whole industry banned him after he was arrested for the possession of illegal weapons at the time of the Bombay blasts in 1992.\n\nHe said, \"I didn't know him. Not at all. But I thought it was very wrong that the whole film industry banned him. I said, 'It's wrong because till he is proven guilty, he is innocent. How can you do that?' So, I went to Sunil Dutt and told him, 'I will announce a film with Sanjay.' He warned me that the Producers Guild would ban me, but I said, 'I don't care because it is wrong what they are doing. So, I announced (the film).\"\n\nSanjay Dutt in 'Munna Bhai MBBS'. Watch video\n\nSo, after Dutt was released from jail, Chopra was the first person he contacted. The actor wanted to make his comeback to the movies with Chopra's film. But, Chopra was not ready yet. \"But I told him, 'I will never make a film with you. I just announced it because it was the right thing to do.' He is a very simple man. A good man, but a simple man. He thought the announcement meant that we were actually going to work together. I said, ‘I cannot make a film with you unless the equation changes because I cannot exploit a good deed’. It’s a terrible thing to do, that you do something good and exploit it,\" the filmmaker shared.\n\nHowever, on Dutt's insistence, Chopra offered him the role of Zaheer in 'Munna Bhai MBBS'. Chopra said, \"So, when I told him to do Jimmy Sheirgill’s role, he agreed. He said, ‘Anything’. Then, Shah Rukh, of course, came to me and he had a throat thing...So, I decided that Sanjay Dutt is the right guy. I told him, ‘You’re doing Munna Bhai’. And he’s such a simple fellow, he said, ‘I know’. I said, ‘No, not that role, main Munna Bhai’. He said, ‘Okay, if you say so, I’ll do it’.\"\n\nBut Chopra said Sanjay Dutt never read the script of 'Munna Bhai MBBS', as shown in the film 'Sanju', which is based on Dutt's life. Also, he shared how the actor never turned up on the set on time, leaving the film's director Rajkumar Hirani annoyed. \"Raju would keep calling me and saying, ‘Sir, he hasn’t come’. I’d call him up, and he wouldn’t answer. The moment he used to reach the set, he’d call back and say, ‘Yes, sir, you called?'” shared Chopra."
