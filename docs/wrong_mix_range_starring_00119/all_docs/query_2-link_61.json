        "text": "“\n\nEnough prattle! You'll both bend a knee to Outworld's new emperor.\n\n„\n\n—Shao in Mortal Kombat 1.\n\nShao, also known as General Shao but more commonly known as Shao Kahn, is a character in the Mortal Kombat fighting game series. A powerful tyrant of the Outworld throne, he is one of the most celebrated villains in not only the fighting game genre, but the video game genre as a whole. He serves as one of the three main antagonists of the franchise alongside Shang Tsung and Shinnok.\n\nShao Kahn made his debut in Mortal Kombat II as the final boss and the main antagonist, a role he also served in Mortal Kombat 3 and in later games. He later returned as the non-playable final boss in Mortal Kombat (2011), serving as the main antagonist of the game's Story Mode. He appears in Mortal Kombat 11 as a pre-order bonus character and secondary antagonist in the game's Story Mode and the Aftermath expansion.\n\nA new version of Shao Kahn returns in Mortal Kombat 1 as a playable character, serving as the tertiary antagonist in the game's Story Mode.\n\nAbout Shao Kahn\n\nShao Kahn the Konqueror is the former Emperor of Outworld, and has served as the main antagonist for most of the series. In many respects, he resembles a large Asian warrior, and is well known for his God-like strength which rivals, if not outright exceeds, that of Raiden and other Godly characters. He is also known for his extreme callousness, brutality, and ferocity in battle, as well as his fondness for personal executions, although he has occasionally spared the lives of his subordinates after proving their worth to him. He has also spared the lives of other victims such as Sindel and Kitana, raising the latter like his own daughter and treating the former like his own wife. However, his true power that has served him well and allowed him to rise above the image of a mere warlord is his high intelligence and profound knowledge of the black arts. Like his subordinate Shang Tsung, he has the power to consume and manipulate souls at a much more efficient rate than Shang Tsung. His knowledge of dark arts have made him a powerful and dangerous kombatant, along with producing some of Outworld's most deadly adversaries, such as Ermac and Skarlet. It is revealed in Mortal Kombat: Deception that Shao Kahn was an advisor to Outworld as Raiden was to Earthrealm, which would suggest the possibility of him being a God, as well as being the former protector of Outworld during Onaga's rule. He would later defeat Blaze in the original timeline, ascend to God-hood with Blaze's powers, kills Raiden and wins the original Armageddon as the remaining kombatant in the original timeline.\n\nPerhaps Shao Kahn’s greatest strength lies in his ability to work towards his goals with great tenacity and his ability to organize. However, his greatest weakness is his arrogance and overconfidence. Shao Kahn has often underestimated mankind, and therefore tried to conquer Earthrealm many times, with or without a consort, to no success. He also possesses a blinding lust for conquest that can sometimes overwhelm his better judgment, allowing him to be manipulated by those that are cunning enough to exploit this weakness. This arrogance and naïveté also allowed for his downfall by his allies on many occasions, such as being betrayed by his allies in the original timeline leading up to Armageddon. In the alternate timeline, he was killed by the Elder Gods for his invasion of Earth and violating the rules of Mortal Kombat, allowing for the Netherrealm invasion of Earthrealm being headed by Quan Chi and Shinnok, the former assisting his attempted conquest of Earthrealm as a ploy to invade Earth and Outworld himself with the forces of the Netherrealm with both realms being weakened by Shao Kahn's invasion. His past self is later brought to the present in the alternate timeline, where he is betrayed by Shang Tsung after the sorcerer becomes the Keeper of Time, using Shao Kahn and his forces to storm Kronika's Keep, only for the sorcerer to attack, defeat and absorb Shao Kahn and Sindel's souls after seizing the Hourglass and taking control of it for himself. In the new timeline, he is easily persuaded by Shang Tsung after the sorcerer is unknowingly deceived by his alternate counterpart in seizing the Outworld throne, later becoming imprisoned for his treachery.\n\nThrough his tyrannical rule of Outworld, Shao Kahn has made many enemies, but also many allies throughout the series. The sorcerer Shang Tsung is often seen as his subordinate, serving him for over a millennia. Through his knowledge of sorcery and soul magic, he is the creator of the construct Ermac. After believing his adopted daughter Kitana to be inferior, Shang Tsung would create the genetic hybrid Mileena for the Emperor, who viewed her as his \"true\" daughter over Kitana. He later takes in the Outworld peasant Skarlet, empowers her with Blood Magik and adopting her as his own daughter as he did Mileena. Throughout his tyrannical leadership, Shao Kahn has often allied with other species in Outworld for his conquests, such as the Tarkata and Shokan, however as growing civil wars grew within Outworld following his first death in the alternate timeline, these allegiances would slowly dissolve, most notably during Kotal Kahn’s reign as Emperor of Outworld. After regaining the Outworld throne briefly, these alliances would not last long, with the Shokan refusing to side with the Emperor and the Tarkata finding peace with Kotal Kahn and Kitana to unite the very divided Outworld.\n\nShao Kahn is the archnemesis to that of the Thunder God Raiden, often being considered his counterpart in their roles in their respective realms. His power and determination have allowed him to exceed Raiden in power on multiple occasions. Due to this rivalry and his desire to conquer Earthrealm, he has also gained enemies from the likes of Liu Kang and Kung Lao, as well as the Special Forces. Additionally, due to his alliance with the Cyber Lin Kuei and Sektor, he has gained animosity from that of Kuai Liang, the second Sub-Zero and Grandmaster of the Lin Kuei in the alternate timeline.\n\nIn the new timeline, Shao Kahn is now referred to as General Shao, a renowned soldier in the Outworld army. His backstory in this timeline is expanded upon, with him being physically improved from being a weak child at birth into a conquering warrior bent on conquest and war by his unnamed father. His skills and tactical brilliance allowed him to lead Outworld into many victories and conquests, establishing himself as Outworld's top general. Shao's desire for conquest however incites a growing animosity with Sindel, Outworld's Empress, as he does not abide himself to Sindel's rule, but what he sees as better for Outworld itself. After his attempt to usurp the Outworld throne, he is imprisoned but later escapes, amassing an army to take Outworld from Mileena's benevolent rule.\n\nAppearance\n\nShao Kahn is one of the few non-ninja characters whose appearance has stayed consistent throughout the years. He is easily recognizable by his intimidating stature; his apparent height varies between appearances, but he is always significantly taller than regular characters. He is almost never seen without his trademark warlord helmet which features a skull-like design with a long crest at the forehead. His attire usually consists of spiked shoulder pads, similarly designed knee pads and gauntlets, and a skull medallion embedded in two straps that intersect across his chest. When his helmet is removed, he appears to be bald with a slightly demonic face featuring red eyes and small spikes protruding from his head.\n\nIn Mortal Kombat 11, while still maintaining the key aspects of his overall appearance, subtle changes were made to differ him from a common Outworlder that his previous iterations exhibited. Shao Kahn now features a more draconic appearance, referencing his former connections with his master Onaga. This is also referenced in the Arcade, with other characters stating he now wields Onaga's power. A full body picture of Shao Kahn without his armor shows dragon-like scales across his arms and legs, along with dragon-like spikes protruding from the back of his head. He also shares the same irises as Sheeva, due to the Shokan being half-dragons. His left arm is now littered with a cluster of large spikes, and his left hand now having large claws protruding from each finger that not only cover his finger tips, but protrude across each of his fingers entirely.\n\nIn Mortal Kombat 1, Shao Kahn retains many of his features from MK11 with the addition of large black horns protruding from his head. His facial structure has also been redesigned to look slightly more human with a smaller nose, the absence of smaller cranial horns and the addition of eyebrows. Due to his new horns, his helmet has been redesigned to resemble a steel face guard though carrying the same skull theme.\n\nCombat Characteristics\n\nPowers and Abilities\n\nShao Kahn is shown to be an immensely powerful being throughout the series. He is able to utilize magic and has superhuman strength, durability, and stamina, as well as longevity. He is also able to charge at the opponent with considerable speed and power. His kombat abilities were demonstrated during the events of Mortal Kombat 3, where he defeated Kung Lao with relative ease. Armed with his Wrath Hammer, Shao Kahn can send opponents flying with one swing. During the events of Armageddon, he was able to smash through Mileena's magic barrier with his hammer.\n\nLike Shang Tsung, he can absorb the souls of others to increase his own power, often through the usage of Soulnados. His ability to absorb souls is so potent, he can rob the billions of souls of an entire realm with a hand motion, often using portals in conjunction with his soul steal to access the souls of a realm without stepping foot on it. The warrior souls he has taken have also retained their memories such as combat knowledge, making him wiser with every soul he imprisons within him.\n\nShao Kahn is one of the few wielders of the mysterious green energy besides Johnny Cage, Cassie Cage, Nightwolf and Jade. He is one of the most versatile wielders of green energy, as he can use it to create energy weapon constructs such as spears, generate protective forcefields that reflect projectiles and fire energy beams seemingly from his eyes and shoot laser beams from his hands. He can enhance his strikes with green energy to increase the power behind his attacks, greatly increase his attack speed with it (like how Johnny Cage uses green energy to speed up his attacks in his Little Improve fatality) and sometimes use it to propel himself to great distances.\n\nApart from his projectile attacks, Kahn's knowledge of magic seems to include cloning, as this is how he managed to avoid assassination at the hands of the Deadly Alliance. After escaping into the wilderness, he was able to heal and resuscitate a mortally wounded Goro and recruit him back to his cause. Shao Kahn has also created a body of flesh and bone for Shang Tsung using his magic when the evil sorcerer's original body was vaporized by Raiden's suicide attack in the events of Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance. He is capable of resurrecting others as well, he demonstrated this ability in the events of Mortal Kombat Trilogy where he brings Mileena back to life after she was killed by Kitana.\n\nHis powers extend to wielding psychic powers, as he was able to enslave the thousands of souls within the magical being Ermac using his powerful mind control and is capable of using telekinesis to lift and rag doll opponents.\n\nIt is revealed in Mortal Kombat 11 in an interaction between Scorpion and Skarlet that Shao Kahn has knowledge in other fields of magic as well, as he was the one who taught Skarlet how to use Blood Magik.\n\nIn Mortal Kombat 1, Shao's bio reveals that he had been born a sickly child but due to an extreme program enacted by his father, he was raised to be a skilled warrior, overcoming his physical condition to become Outworld's strongest champion. Instead of a war hammer, he now wields an ornate battle axe to cleave and smash through his opponents and is capable of telekinetically controlling it. Unlike his previous counterparts, Shao seemingly lacks any magical aptitude.\n\nSignature Moves\n\nLight Spear: Shao Kahn crouches down to his knees and throws a long light spear at his opponent. In MK11, the attack is called Merciless Spear, and now has a physical appearance rather than being made of light and energy, however it is still summoned as such. The attack has an increased hitbox unlike most projectiles, allowing it to hit ducking opponents, however there is a chance for it to miss this way and can even miss on standing opponents if they are too close. If Shao Kahn is hit right as he spears the opponent, there is a chance the opponent will be affected by hitstun, allowing Shao Kahn to attack the opponent as if they were stunned by the attack. (MKII, MK 2011, MK11)\n\nIn MK 2011, the attack has armor on startup.\n\nCharging Spikes: Shao Kahn shoulder rams his opponent with a shadow trail following behind him. In MKII, MK3, and UMK3, Charging Spikes had white trailing shadows and in Trilogy was replaced to green, however in N64 version, the shadows were blue. In MK11, the attack is called Shoulder Charger which knocks the opponent away from Shao Kahn if it successful hits.(MKII, MK3, UMK3, MKT, MK:D, MK:U, MK:SM, MK:A, MKvsDCU, MK 2011, MK11)\n\nIn MK 2011, the attack has armor on startup.\n\nIn MK11, Shao Kahn can amplify the attack to deliver an additional strike for increased damage. When amplified, the attack can deliver two separate attacks depending on a button input and can be amplified as many times as possible. Additionally, Shao Kahn can delay when amplifying the attack, however the attack cannot be amplified if it is blocked by the opponent and can only be delayed if it successfully lands.\n\nShao Kahn uppercuts the opponent into the air for increased damage and a juggle effect.\n\nShao Kahn delivers an overhead fist slam covered in green energy, knocking his opponent to the ground. This version deals more damage than the juggle effect and has Shao Kahn recover much faster than the opponent. This attack has armor breaking properties, ignoring the armor granted by specific abilities and Fatal Blows. When breaking the armor of a Break Away, the attack will deal very little extra damage, however the opponent will bounce off the ground for a juggle rather than being knocked down. This juggle effect does more damage than the uppercut version.\n\nWrath Hammer Attack: Shao Kahn summons his Wrath Hammer and smashes his opponent over the head with it, setting them up for a free hit. In Deception and on, the Wrath Hammer became a weapon style and thus was no longer needed as an individual special move. In MK11, the attack is called Hammer Lunge and has Shao Kahn leap into the air when bringing his hammer down. Additionally, the attack can be used at different ranges, called Close/Far Hammer Lunge, respectively. The far version of Hammer Lunge can reach the opponent full-screen distance. Additionally in MK11, successfully landing the attack bounces the opponent off the ground for a juggle. Shao Kahn is completely vulnerable as he leaps with his hammer, leaving him open to attack in some instances. When leaping, Shao Kahn is also capable of dodging incoming projectiles when timed correctly. (MK3, UMK3, MKT, MKvsDCU, MK 2011, MK11)\n\nIn MK 2011, the attack has armor on startup.\n\nIn MK11, amplifying the attack has Shao Kahn impale the opponent in the stomach with his spear immediately after slamming them then tossing them in the air and away for increased damage. Shao Kahn is much more safe if this version is blocked by the opponent. Additionally, the attack creates considerable pushback. The amplified version of this attack is capable of being Flawless Blocked, leaving Shao Kahn vulnerable to Flawless Block Attacks.\n\nExplosive Ball: Shao Kahn fires a green star like fireball, seemingly from his mouth or eyes. In Deception and Armageddon this is called Explosive Blast. (MK3, UMK3, MKT, MK:D, MK:U, MK:SM, MK:A, MKvsDCU)\n\nUplifting Knee: Shao Kahn performs a rising knee attack with a streak following behind him. Between two games, Uplifting Knee had white shadows, but in Trilogy they were replaced by green. In the N64 version however, they were blue. (MK3, UMK3, MKT, MK:D, MK:U, MK:SM, MK:A, MK 2011)\n\nHammer Dance: Shao Kahn swings his hammer at an alarming rate, causing his foe to fly. He makes nine dancing strikes and one final strike. (MK:SM)\n\nRidicule: Shao Kahn taunts, mocks, and ridicules his opponents with insults, mockery, or just plain laughter. It is a trademark of Shao Kahn's and is what makes him one of the more memorable bosses in fighting game history. In Deception, performing a Ridicule could heal Shao Kahn, though only a tiny sliver of health would be recovered and could only be performed three times a match before it was automatically disabled. Same goes for Armageddon; however, in it there is no limit to the amount of times this is used. It heals him once for a rate above 10%, and decreases the more it is used. (MKII, MK3, UMK3, MKT, MK:D, MK:U, MK:SM, MK:A, MK 2011, MK11 - Equip Ability)\n\nIn MK11, the attack has two versions with different effects. Additionally, both effects can be active at the same time;\n\nRidicule: Shao Kahn points at and taunts his opponent.\n\nSuccessfully performing this version causes the opponent to catch fire with a green flame for a short time, reducing all the damage they deal by 50% for the duration. Only the first strike or initial strikes of the opponent's Fatal Blow will be reduced. If Shao Kahn is attacked before the opponent catches fire, the debuff will not take effect. Connecting or being struck by a Krushing Blow or Fatal Blow ends this effect prematurely.\n\nHumiliate: Shao Kahn laughs at his opponent.\n\nSuccessfully performing this version causes the opponent to catch fire with a green flame for a short time, only this time, Shao Kahn's damage dealt is increased by 25%. Only the first strike of the Shao Kahn's Fatal Blow gains the damage bonus. If Shao Kahn is attacked before the opponent catches fire, the buff will not take effect. Connecting or being struck by a Krushing Blow or Fatal Blow ends this effect prematurely.\n\nGrab and Punch: Shao Kahn lifts his opponent up by the throat with one hand and then smashes his fist into their face, sending them sailing back. In Deception and Armageddon, this is simply his throw, and if performed next to a Death Trap, could automatically knock opponents into them. (MKT, MK:D, MK:U, MK:A, MKvsDCU)\n\nEmperor's Shield: Shao Kahn creates an energy shield to either reverse attacks or to shatter the opponent. (MK:D, MK:U, MK:A, MKvsDCU)\n\nMystic Choke: Shao Kahn engulfs his foe in a force field and slams them twice in the chest. (MK:A)\n\nHammer Throw: Shao Kahn throws his hammer at the opponent, stunning them and setting them up for a free hit. This attack can only be blocked with Nightwolf's Absorb, Kratos' Golden Fleece, and Kenshi's Blade Absorb, and can be evaded with Freddy Krueger's Nightmare Stance and Jade's Shadow Flash. Shao Kahn has armor on start-up. In MK11, the attack is called Wrath Hammer, does not have armor and no longer stuns, but can hit ducking opponents and knocks them away from Shao Kahn. Despite having a slow startup, the attack activates and travels much faster than in MK 2011. (MK 2011, MK11 - Equip Ability)\n\nIn MK11, after landing a Wrath Hammer, successfully landing a second Wrath Hammer turns it into a Krushing Blow, causing the hammer to shatter the opponent's ribcage on impact, knocking them further back and dealing over three times the attack's original damage. This can also count if the opponent is struck by Wrath Hammer during a combo, so long as the second hit successfully connects after. This Krushing Blow can also trigger on airborne opponents.\n\nThis Krushing Blow damage can be increased slightly if Dark Priest or Humiliate are active, or greatly if both effects are active at once.\n\nHammer Swing: Shao Kahn uppercuts the opponent with his hammer, launching the opponent into the air for a juggle. Shao Kahn has armor on startup. In MK11, this is a basic attack called Dragon Toe, which has Shao Kahn lunge forward and uppercut the opponent with a single-handed hammer swing. Also in MK11, the hammer swing still juggles the opponent, but no longer has armor. Additionally, Shao Kahn can connect this attack consecutively, however connecting the attack too many times eventually knocks the opponent to the ground. (MK 2011, MK11)\n\nHammer Cut: Shao Kahn sweeps the opponent with his hammer. Shao Kahn has armor on startup. In MK11, this is a basic attack called Hammer Slammer, which is Shao Kahn's sweep attack, in which he steps forward and sweeps the opponent with a low hammer swing. This attack does not have armor in MK11 and is significantly faster than Hammer Cut from MK 2011. (MK 2011, MK11)\n\nUpward Shoulder: Shao Kahn performs an upward shoulder charge, launching the opponent in the air for a juggle. While charging, Shao Kahn leaves a green shadow trail when performing the attack, similar to his Charging Spikes. Shao Kahn performs this during his Fatal Blow in MK11 but never in the actual game. Shao Kahn has armor on startup. (MK 2011)\n\nScum Grab: Shao Kahn quickly grabs the opponent out of the air by the throat and throws them on the ground in the opposite direction. This attack has armor breaking properties, ignoring the armor granted by specific abilities and Fatal Blows. When breaking the armor of a Break Away, the damage dealt is slightly increased. (MK11)\n\nAmplifying the attack has Shao Kahn slam his hammer on the downed opponent after throwing them to the ground for increased damage.\n\nUp Wrath Hammer: Shao Kahn uppercuts his opponent into the air with his hammer, where his hammer is teleported above them, slamming down on them and knocking them to the ground shortly after. Shao Kahn does not have to connect the first strike of the attack to have his hammer land on the opponent, however the hammer will not always land on the opponent if this is done. The attack can be used at two different ranges, normal or close range, called Close Up Wrath Hammer, respectively. Shao Kahn is vulnerable when the hammer is teleported before landing on the opponent, however this window is extremely small. This attack is considered a projectile once the Wrath Hammer teleports above the opponent. This attack is capable of being Flawless Blocked, leaving Shao Kahn vulnerable to Flawless Block Attacks. This ability conflicts with Seeking Wrath Hammer when equipped, disabling the option to select Seeking Wrath Hammer. (MK11 - Equip Ability)\n\nSeeking Wrath Hammer: Shao Kahn throws his hammer backwards, where it loops around the fightline offscreen and strikes the opponent from behind. Unlike Wrath Hammer, this attack does not have an increased hitbox and can miss ducking opponents. Shao Kahn can continue combos in some instances if this hits an airborne opponent, however this window is extremely small. This ability conflicts with Up Wrath Hammer when equipped, disabling the option to select Up Wrath Hammer. (MK11 - Equip Ability)\n\nDark Priest: Shao Kahn summons a Shadow Priest who enchants his Wrath Hammer, causing it to glow green for some time. While active, all attacks involving Shao Kahn's Wrath Hammer deal 10% increased damage. The final strike of Shao Kahn's Fatal Blow is not affected by this damage bonus. In the Towers of Time and Arcade, Dark Priest also changes the properties of Shao Kahn's attacks, changing his hammer attacks from dealing Physical damage to Chaos damage. If Shao Kahn is attacked before his hammer turns green, the buff will not take effect. In some instances, even if Shao Kahn blocks the attack, the effect will still not take effect. Connecting or being struck by a Krushing Blow or Fatal Blow ends this effect prematurely. (MK11 - Equip Ability)\n\nGround Shatter: Shao Kahn slams the head of his hammer on the ground, damaging the opponent's shins and feet, causing them to stumble. This can also re-stand the opponent in some instances when it successfully connects during a juggle or on an airborne opponent. Shao Kahn is vulnerable just before he slams the hammer's head in some instances, however this window is extremely small. When this attack is blocked by the opponent, it creates pushback. If Shao Kahn is hit right as he slams his hammer, there is a chance the opponent will be affected by hitstun, allowing Shao Kahn to attack the opponent as if they were stunned by the attack. (MK11 - Equip Ability)\n\nAmplifying the attack has Shao Kahn deliver a second, overhead slam, knocking the opponent down for increased damage. Despite Shao Kahn performing this action, the amplified version is not actually an Overhead attack. Shao Kahn is much more safe if this version is blocked by the opponent. Additionally, the attack creates considerable pushback. This version of the attack is capable of being Flawless Blocked, leaving Shao Kahn vulnerable to Flawless Block Attacks. Alternatively, when timed correctly, the opponent can jump over the second hammer swing, leaving Shao Kahn vulnerable.\n\n(Air) Wrath Hammer: Shao Kahn throws his hammer at the opponent from the air at a downward diagonal angle. This ability is separate from his Wrath Hammer ability and does not require Wrath Hammer to be selected to use. This attack does not count towards the Krushing Blow requirement of Wrath Hammer. (MK11 - Equip Ability)\n\nAnnihilation: Shao Kahn swings his hammer overhead, forcing his opponent to the ground. He then slams the head of the hammer on the ground, forcing the opponent to stand back up where he slams the hammer over their head, knocking them down for a second time. (MK11 - Equip Ability)\n\nAmplifying the attack no longer has Shao Kahn deliver the second hammer slam, but instead has him impale the opponent in the stomach with his spear after slamming the hammer on the ground, after which he spawns his hammer, spins, and knocks his opponent away full-screen distance for increased damage.\n\nIf Dark Priest is active, performing the regular version of the attack turns the attack into a Krushing Blow, having the second hammer slam shatter the top of the opponent's skull, dealing increased damage and bouncing the opponent into the air for a juggle.\n\nThis Krushing Blow damage can be increased slightly if Humiliate is active.\n\nSkewered: Shao Kahn stabs upward with his spear, snatching airborne opponents out of the air and slams them on the ground with his spear in front of him. This attack has armor breaking properties, ignoring the armor granted by specific abilities and Fatal Blows. When breaking the armor of a Break Away, the attack deals increased damage, however this increase is extremely small. This ability replaces Scum Grab when equipped. (MK11 - Equip Ability)\n\nAmplifying the attack has Shao Kahn slam the opponent in the opposite direction, but bounces them for a juggle. The attack can only be amplified once for the juggle effect. This version of the attack deals slightly less damage at the expense of the juggle effect.\n\nSpear Charge: Shao Kahn charges at his opponent with his spear drawn, stabbing them in the stomach and knocking them away. This ability replaces Shoulder Charger when equipped. (MK11 - Equip Ability)\n\nAmplifying the attack has Shao Kahn release the spear after stabbing the opponent, causing them to fall to their back. He rolls forward, grabbing the spear, still impaled into the opponent, picks them up and bounces them off the ground for a juggle and dealing increased damage in the process. The amplified version of Spear Charge does slightly more damage than the juggle amplified Shoulder Charger and has a considerably increased juggle effect. Additionally, unlike Shoulder Charger, Spear Charge can be amplified regardless if the opponent blocks the attack or not, however this offers nothing as a result and can only be amplified once during a combo.\n\nDark Energy: Shao swings his axe in front of him, enchanting it, causing all axe attacks to deal 20% increased damage for the duration. This effect does not affect his Fatal Blow start-up or when striking the opponent with his axe during his Fatal Blow. Connecting or being struck by a Fatal Blow ends this effect prematurely. (MK1)\n\nEnhancing the attack doubles the duration of the effect.\n\nPower Strike: Shao swings his axe overhead, knocking the opponent to the ground and planting his axe into the ground, changing him to No Axe Stance. If this attack is used with juggle effects from basic attacks, combos, specials, or Kameo Attacks, the attack will now launch the opponent into the air for a juggle. Shao is vulnerable when swinging his axe, though the window is small. This attack is capable of being Up Blocked by the opponent, leaving Shao completely vulnerable after the attack is blocked by the opponent. (MK1)\n\nEnhancing the attack deals increased damage while retaining the original properties. Shao and his opponent become neutral when blocked by the opponent. Like the original, this attack is capable of being Up Blocked by the opponent, leaving Shao completely vulnerable after the attack is blocked by the opponent.\n\nDevastator: Shao leaps in the air with a knee strike and impales his opponent with his axe, knocking them to the ground. This attack can miss ducking opponents. This attack is capable of striking airborne opponents, whether this being from a combo or the opponent jumping at Shao. (MK1)\n\nEnhancing the attack grants armor but no additional damage. Additionally, Shao can follow-up the attack with Power Strike, which launches the opponent into the air for a juggle, in turn dealing increased damage. When used as a Wakeup Reversal, the attack deals increased damage, however it cannot be followed up with Power Strike.\n\nDeath Quake: Shao slams his axe with so much force it sends a shockwave straight to the opponent's shins, knocking them off their feet. This attack is considered a projectile. (MK1)\n\nEnhancing the attack launches the opponent into the air for a juggle at the expense of dealing no additional damage.\n\nAxe Recall: Shao simply returns his axe to his hands, changing him back to Axe Stance. (MK1)\n\nKlassic Kahn: While in No Axe Stance, Shao performs a jumping knee strike to the opponent's face, launching them into the air for a juggle. This replaces Devastator while in No Axe Stance. As with Devastator, this attack can miss ducking opponents. (MK1)\n\nEnhancing the attack grants armor and deals increased damage. Although the juggle effect is still present, performing this version of the attack during a Wakeup Reversal no longer launches the opponent into the air for a juggle, but instead knocks them away from Shao.\n\nTreechopper: While next to his axe, Shao picks it up and delivers a quick and powerful swing, knocking the opponent away full-screen distance. This attack can only be performed while in No Axe Stance while next to his grounded axe. Shao is very safe when this attack is blocked by the opponent and creates pushback. (MK1)\n\nEnhancing the attack grants armor and deals increased damage.\n\nAxe Quake: While near his axe, Shao levitates it briefly before slamming it on the ground, causing a shockwave across the entire arena, knocking the opponent off their feet. If the axe is close to the opponent when performing this attack, they will be struck by the axe as it comes down to the ground, in addition to the shockwave, dealing increased damage. (MK1)\n\nEnhancing the attack launches the opponent into the air for a juggle at the expense of dealing no additional damage.\n\nReverse Treechopper: While near his axe, Shao grabs the opponent and slams them on top of this grounded axe before stomping on them, impaling them deeper into the weapon before picking the axe up with the opponent still impaled and slams them into the ground, returing him to Axe Stance. Shao is given the option to slam the opponent into the ground in the opposite direction, called Reverse X2 Treechopper, respectively. This attack is a High Throw and can miss ducking opponents. This attack deals increased damage if the opponent is Up Blocking. (MK1)\n\nEnhancing the attack grants armor and deals increased damage, while retaining the original properties.\n\nX-Rays/Fatal Blows\n\nX-Ray - It's Official: Shao Kahn hammers his opponent to the ground and grabs their arm. He then stomps on their head (breaking the whole skull), lifts the opponent up by the arm, and delivers a skull-shattering headbutt. (MK 2011)\n\nFatal Blow - You Suck: Shao Kahn impales the opponent with his spear and slices them twice across the chest before launching them upwards with a vertical slash. He then performs an Upward Shoulder before grabbing the opponent's leg and throwing them down to the ground and nailing them to the ground with his spear. Finally, he spawns his Wrath Hammer and slams it down hard on the opponent's head. (MK11)\n\nFatal Blow - War God: General Shao sends his axe in the air as it crashes down and hits the opponent, stunning them. He then rushes towards the opponent, uppercutting them high into the air with his axe, kneeing them in the face and slamming his axe into their chest, shattering their ribcage, knocking them to the ground before landing on top of them. (MK1)\n\nOther Moves\n\nThrow (Forward): Shao Kahn grabs the opponent and slams his fist down on their head, forcing them to their knees. He then taunts the opponent, summons his hammer and performs a golf swing to the opponent's face that knocks them away. Shao Kahn has armor on start-up. (MK 2011)\n\nThrow (Backward): Shao Kahn grabs the opponent and slams his fist down on their head, forcing them to their knees. He then taunts the opponent, summons his hammer and takes a step behind the stunned opponent and delivers a hammer swing to the back of their head, knocking them away. Shao Kahn has armor on start-up. (MK 2011)\n\nThrow (Forward): Shao Kahn jabs the opponent in the stomach and over the head with his hammer, bringing them down on all fours, then launches them across the arena with a golf swing. (MK11)\n\nIf this is used as a Reversal Punish or Getup Punish, the attack turns into a Krushing Blow, where when Shao Kahn delivers the golf swing, it shatters the entire front of the opponent's skull, dealing nearly double the original damage, and sending the opponent high in the air for a juggle.\n\nThis Krushing Blow damage can be increased slightly if Dark Priest or Humiliate are active, or greatly if both effects are active at once.\n\nThrow (Backward): Shao Kahn hits the opponent in the stomach with his hammer, then spins around the opponent, hitting the opponent in the back of the head with his hammer. (MK11)\n\nDIE: Shao Kahn strikes the opponent with the butt of his hammer's handle, backhands the opponent then stabs them in the stomach with his spear, where he stabs them three more times in the chest with his spear before kicking them away. The final stab of this combo is capable of being Flawless Blocked by the opponent, leaving Shao Kahn vulnerable to Flawless Block Attacks. (MK11)\n\nIf Shao Kahn has successfully landed three or more Merciless Spears, the combo turns into a Krushing Blow on the combo's next successful usage, where the final stab is dug significantly deeper, causing blood to splatter and dealing double the combo's original damage.\n\nThis Krushing Blow damage can be increased slightly if Humiliate is active.\n\nYou Will Never Win: Shao Kahn kicks the opponent in the knee, before stomping on their foot, opening them up for additional attacks if successful. This combo has a follow-up attack. The stomp of this combo is capable of being Flawless Blocked by the opponent, leaving Shao Kahn vulnerable to Flawless Block Attacks. Additionally, Shao Kahn cannot continue this combo with its follow-up attack if the second hit is Flawless Blocked, however he can still use special attacks. (MK11)\n\nLast Breath: Shao Kahn grabs the opponent and hoists them above his head, slamming the side of their body over his head before dropping them head-first onto the ground in the opposite direction. This final grab acts as a High Throw and is unblockable, however it can miss ducking opponents. This final grab is capable of striking an opponent during a Getup Roll, similar to a standard Throw.\n\nIf the opponent is under the effects of Ridicule or Humiliate or both, the combo turns into a Krushing Blow, where when Shao Kahn slams the opponent over his head, he shatters the opponent's spine and back ribcage. The damage dealt varies on which effect is present upon connecting the combo, with Ridicule dealing almost double the original damage, and Humiliate dealing over double the original damage due to the damage bonus of Humiliate. This Krushing Blow can still trigger if only the final grab connects, as long as the opponent is affected by Ridicule or Humiliate.\n\nMight Makes Right (Backward Throw): Shao slams side of his axe into the opponent's face twice before snagging them onto the blade and tossing them away in the opposite direction. (MK1)\n\nMight Makes Right (No Axe Stance): While in No Axe Stance, Shao punches the opponent in the face twice before effortlessly gorilla press slamming them into the ground in the opposite direction. (MK1)\n\nAxe Stance: While his axe is in his hands, Shao gains access to his normal attacks, combos and special attacks. (MK1)\n\nNo Axe Stance: While his axe is planted in the ground, Shao gains access to new basic attacks, combos and special attacks. Additionally, his basic attacks and combos have differing effects on a juggle opponent, granting him new combo opportunities. (MK1)\n\nYou're Weak: Shao slams his axe over the opponent's head before impaling them in the stomach and slamming them on the ground in the opposite direction. This combo is only available in Axe Stance. (MK1)\n\nDivide and Konquer: Shao stomps on the opponent's foot, impales them into the ground with his axe before slamming it down on the knocked down opponent. This combo is only available in Axe Stance. (MK1)\n\nFatalities\n\nHead Crusher: Shao Kahn hammers his opponent into the ground leaving only their lost consciousness. (MK3) (GameBoy version only)\n\nShao Kahn hammers his opponent into the ground leaving only their head sticking out. He then laughs before hammering his opponent into a bloody explosion. (MKT) (N64 version only)\n\nHome Run: Shao Kahn uppercuts his opponent into the air and smashes them to pieces with his hammer as they fall. In MK 2011, he grabs the opponent by the neck and flips them in the air before delivering the killing blow.

(MK11)\n\nSpin Cycle: Shao knocks the opponent into the air with his axe. He then jumps and grabs the airborne opponent by one of their legs and spins them rapidly with so much force it skins them alive as they scream in agony, reducing them to a bare skeleton.

(MK Mobile - Konqueror Card)\n\nMovie Appearances\n\nMortal Kombat\n\nShao Kahn appears in both Mortal Kombat movies. In the first movie, Kahn's appearance is only as a special effect at the end of the film (though he is referred to throughout the movie only as \"the Emperor\"). His voice is provided by an uncredited Frank Welker (who also did vocals for Goro in the movie).\n\nMortal Kombat: Annihilation\n\nIn the second movie, Mortal Kombat: Annihilation, Kahn is played by Brian Thompson and is the main antagonist; he is ultimately defeated and killed by Liu Kang in the final battle.\n\nIn Annihilation, as an attempt to shock the viewer, Raiden announced that Shao Kahn was his brother and Shinnok their father. He bore the same tattoo on his right shoulder as a sign of their family that Raiden wore. This has never been made official in MK canon, and most fans have dismissed this as another example of how far removed from the games Annihilation was.\n\nIn 2008, eleven years after Annihilation, Shao Kahn's relationship with Raiden was mentioned in Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe, with Raiden's profile stating that the two are brothers. Given the game's non-canonical status, it has caused many to again disregard this information.\n\nMortal Kombat: Legacy\n\nAleks Paunovic portrays Shao Kahn in Mortal Kombat: Legacy.\n\nHis motives and history are mostly kept intact from the games though he so far lacks his distinct war helmet and Wrath Hammer, and his relationship with Sindel is slightly changed.\n\nFirst seen in episode four in flashbacks, Shao Kahn's realm of Outworld won ten Mortal Kombat tournaments, allowing him to merge Edenia with his realm and conquer it. He participated in the slaughtering of the Edenians, observing his brutal Tarkatan hordes kill every man and woman they came across. When Shao Kahn's forces claimed the capital and the castle, he personally prevented Sindel and her child Kitana from escaping, and revealed to her that the man she thought was her husband Jerrod, was in truth nothing but a decoy after his general Baraka slew him before her very eyes and contemptuously told her king had already fled.\n\nHaving claimed Edenia for himself, Shao Kahn took Sindel as his wife and Kitana as his own daughter. Shao Kahn grew to have genuine feelings for Sindel, even love her, but she only showed contempt and disgust at his advances. Fearing Kitana would grow to hate him from Sindel's influences, Shao Kahn tasked the sorcerer Shang Tsung to create a clone of Kitana but with Tarkatan blood, a true daughter of his own, and named her Mileena. This proved to be too much for Sindel, and she took her own life, leaving Kahn to raise the girls himself.\n\nShao Kahn raised the two, and after realizing their exceptional skills for combat, began training them as his personal assassins. He also manipulated their maturing emotions in their adolescence, particularly Mileena's by showing more affection for Kitana, to ensure that they remained loyal only to him. As the two grew older, he eventually assigned them the task of hunting down the remainder of Jerrod's impersonators before finally ordering them to kill the former king himself, though he warned them of grave consequences should they fail.\n\nThough they succeeded, with Mileena having personally struck Jerrod down herself, Shao Kahn was unaware Kitana had learned of her true origins. When he next brought Kitana and Mileena before him, Shao Kahn began to discuss his new plans for merging Earthrealm to theirs, and though not stated on screen, his desire for them to enter the Mortal Kombat tournament.\n\nThough mentioned by Mileena and Kitana in season two, Shao Kahn does not physically appear, as Shang Tsung commands his chosen fighters while in Earthrealm.\n\nTV Appearances\n\nShao Kahn appears in Mortal Kombat: Conquest, played by Jeff Meek. Despite having lost much of his physical stature from the games and movies, he has a much more threatening disposition, though he rarely interacts with the heroes of the series (due to his inability to travel to Earth). However, he does have a romantic side (as he seduces and charms several women in the series, including two of Quan Chi's undead female slaves) and shows a fatherly, caring relationship with Kitana despite the fact that she is covertly working against him. Jeff Meek's role is more interesting when one considers that he played Raiden on the same show, occasionally opposite himself. In episode 21 Stolen Lies, he deceives a society of people called the Shaakans into believing that he is their god; every aspect of their culture (Farland = Outworld, children pretending to steal souls, a six-armed Shokan warrior and Kahn's henchmen on the scarf, a skull on the head of a Shaakan warrior) reflects this blind worship of the Outworld emperor.\n\nShao Kahn also appeared in several episodes of the animated series Mortal Kombat: Defenders of the Realm as the main villain. He still seeks to conquer Earthrealm and have it as another addition to his collection of enslaved realms that he had merged with Outworld.\n\nComic Book Appearances\n\nShao Kahn makes his first appearance during the Battlewave series of Malibu Comics, though he already was present during the first, Blood & Thunder. Shao Kahn remained mostly faithful to his game counterpart, being the Emperor of Outworld and attempting to take Earthrealm for himself. During the two series, he never appears wielding his trademark helmet, instead always shown with his visible face and design taken from the official Mortal Kombat II comic written by John Tobias. However, in Kitana & Mileena, a comic about Kitana's past, Shao Kahn does appear wearing his helmet.\n\nShao Kahn appeared during Blood & Thunder while communicating with Shang Tsung by means of a big purple orb. He became disgusted by Shang Tsung's hold of the tournament, so he used his powers to bring all the kombatants into Shang Tsung's palace, triggering the big fight shown in the Tournament Edition final issue.\n\nIn Battlewave, Shao Kahn would arrange a different plan to open the portals. He kidnaps Sonya and, by means of hypnosis and brainwashing, convinces her to marry him. The marriage would weaken the barriers between realms enough to allow Shao Kahn to seize Earth easily (and make Sonya the queen of both realms and his wife). During the wedding ceremony held, however, the wedding would be crashed and he would be stopped by the Earthrealm warriors' interruption, ending with Sonya becoming free from Kahn's influence. In the comic, he claims to not be the romantic type, but he also states that Sonya is very beautiful as his bride. However, he soon comes to realize that both Outworld and Earth would be in turmoil as a result of the wedding, questioning his own plan and effectively calling off the ceremony.\n\nShao Kahn then would devise a tournament of sorts: a race to reach a medallion high into a frozen cliff. Two teams were arranged, with the ultimate victor being Sub-Zero for Earthrealm.\n\nQuotes\n\nGameplay Taunts\n\n\"Bow to me!\" (In MK11, he says this after knocking the opponent down or after his Last Breath combo)\n\n\"Feel the wrath of Shao Kahn!\"\n\n\"Feel the power of Shao Kahn!\"\n\n\"Don't make me laugh.\" (Also in MK Mobile through Feats of Strength, in MK11 after winning a round)\n\n\"You will never win!\"\n\n\"You will die, mortal!\"\n\n\"Prepare to die!\"\n\n\"You are pathetic!\"\n\n\"Is that your best?\"\n\n\"That was pathetic!\"\n\n\"You weak, pathetic fool!\"\n\n\"You are nothing!\"\n\n\"You suck!\" (Also in MK Mobile through gameplay and Feats of Strength)\n\n\"It's official!

Come to me. Come to die!\"\n\n”That’s nothing compared to what I’m about to do.”\n\nTrivia\n\nGeneral\n\nShao Kahn started out unmasked and with large gnashing teeth similar to Baraka, since everyone from Outworld was originally to be of Baraka's race. The idea of all inhabitants of Outworld being Tarkatans was later dropped.\n\nHis height changes considerably between depictions. In the 2D games, he was scaled to be even taller than the Shokan Goro and Kintaro, with a height estimated to be 7'6'', yet he was depicted as only half a head taller than the regular characters in Mortal Kombat: Deception and Mortal Kombat: Armageddon. In Mortal Kombat: Shaolin Monks, he appeared to stand around seven-and-a-half feet, with Liu Kang and Kung Lao only coming up to his chest, but he was not quite as tall as either Shokan character. He appears to be around the same height in Mortal Kombat (2011) as he was in the 2D game, about a head taller than the playable characters, however he is same height as Goro and Kintaro.\n\nThis is also depicted in Mortal Kombat 11 where he is the tallest character on the roster, however he is roughly the same height as Raiden, Geras, Kotal Kahn, The Terminator, Spawn, Sheeva, and RoboCop.\n\nShao Kahn was never seen unmasked in a game until Mortal Kombat: Shaolin Monks, where once he loses half his health, a scene plays in which he pulls out a hammer and throws it at the player, which the player throws back at him and smashes the mask to pieces. His face is based on the MKII comic depiction.\n\nThis would later be changed in MK11 where he is given sharp teeth and a large nose, which also marks the first time Shao Kahn can be seen helmetless in a mainline canonical game.\n\nShao Kahn's voice is an ever present sound in the Mortal Kombat games. Even when he isn't present, he can be heard in the form of an announcer with phrases such as \"Outstanding\", \"Well Done\", \"Incredible\", \"Superb\" and \"Excellent\". He also orders you to finish your opponent at the end of a match (supporting his character type). His voice can be heard in Unreal Championship 2: The Liandri Conflict, which featured Mortal Kombat themes. Starting in Mortal Kombat II, he narrates the match. He would often laugh when a kombatant was low on health. He was the announcer for all games from MKII until MK4, where Quan Chi was the announcer. Kahn resumed being an announcer afterward, even when you fight and kill him as an opponent.\n\nThough Shao Kahn was initially shown to be well over 10,000 years old, Mortal Kombat: Armageddon places him as being even older. Shao Kahn was shown to be highly infamous before Taven and Daegon were sealed, which happened before Shinnok's fall from grace. In Shinnok's ending in Mortal Kombat 4, he states that Raiden had imprisoned him for \"millions of years\", which aligns with his fall and the battle for Earth being the cause for the cretacous extinction event that killed the dinosaurs and led to the Saurians fleeing Earthrealm. This would seem to be an example of time passing differently between realms–as it has been noted at times to do–as it would otherwise humorously mean that Shao Kahn had been unsuccessfully attempting to conquer Edenia for at least 65 million years, since Taven stated that Shao Kahn had made an unsuccessful attempt at the realm before Taven was sealed. The period of Shinnok's fall has also been alternately referenced as only thousands of years ago at times, and this may be also simply be an example of an inconsistency in the timeline.\n\nIn many official depictions of Shao Kahn made by Midway, he is shown wearing a cape, which he takes off before starting a fight. Mortal Kombat: Deception was the first game in which he wore the cape in-game. He later wears smaller capes with some of his outfits in Mortal Kombat 11, which also have an emblem of his Helmet on it.\n\nShao Kahn's name was accidentally hyphenated in the closing credits of Mortal Kombat: Annihilation (\"Shao-Kahn\").\n\nThough Kahn has no official Animality in the games, in Mortal Kombat: Annihilation, Kahn is given the Animality of a Five-Headed Hydra.\n\nShao Kahn's \"mask\" or \"Skull Mask\" is actually a Kabuto, a Japanese Samurai helmet with a Menpō, a face mask commonly worn with the Kabuto.\n\nIn MK11 through the Kustomization, Shao Kahn can wear different variations of his iconic mask, from MKII to MK 2011 to brand new variations for MK11.\n\nDespite being the \"announcer\" for most games, Shao Kahn will have a different voice actor in-game then when commentating.\n\nIn MK11, two voices of Shao Kahn are selectable as announcers for gameplay, the default and Shao Kahn himself (See Below).\n\nIn a Top 10 list hosted by Screwattack.com, Shao Kahn was placed at #4 of the best Mortal Kombat Characters in the Mortal Kombat Series.\n\nShao Kahn has been the final boss in more Mortal Kombat games than any other character, serving as the final boss in MKII, MK3/UMK3/MKT, MK:SM, and MK 2011.\n\nIn the Parody fighting game Divekick, in Kung Pao's story, she is the daughter of Theodore Khan, an evil dictator. Theodore Khan is likely a parody of Shao Kahn.\n\nA 1993 UK-published strategy guide for Mortal Kombat II described Kahn as being \"dressed like a '70s disco queen.\"\n\nMortal Kombat II\n\nShao Kahn not only makes his debut in Mortal Kombat II, but also replaces Shang Tsung as the final boss, a role he takes over for a majority of his appearances in the franchise.\n\nShao Kahn was digitally re-sized to a taller height to make him tower over the playable characters. Ironically, the actor who played him, bodybuilder Brian Glynn, was not nearly as imposing in comparison; a photograph published in GamePro magazine of Glynn and Ed Boon standing side-by-side, which was snapped during production of the game, showed that Boon was taller.\n\nAlthough Shao Kahn holds a staff in Mortal Kombat II, he is never been seen using it.\n\nIt also makes an appearance in Mortal Kombat: Shaolin Monks, however like before, he never uses it during gameplay.\n\nIt makes a reappearance in MK11 as a Kollector trade item known as Blood Scepter in the Krypt, but once again he never uses one during gameplay nor can the one from the Krypt be used at all.\n\nMortal Kombat 3/Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3/Mortal Kombat Trilogy\n\nThis game marks the first game in which he uses his Wrath Hammer and becomes his signature weapon for the rest of his appearances in the series.\n\nShao Kahn is the only character who bleeds from Robot Smoke's teleport.\n\nMortal Kombat: Deception\n\nIn Mortal Kombat: Deception, in Konquest Mode, his costume is based on his MKII appearance.\n\nMortal Kombat: Armageddon\n\nShao Kahn is the one of the only remaining survivors in the original timeline after winning Armageddon.\n\nMortal Kombat vs. DC Universe\n\nShao Kahn serves as a primary antagonist for the game along side his DC counterpart Darkseid.\n\nShao Kahn and Darkseid would accidently merge in the game's Story Mode, creating the game's sole original character and final boss known as Dark Kahn.\n\nMortal Kombat (2011)\n\nWhen he is performing his Ridicule, some of the classic taunts throughout the game returned, such as \"It's official, you suck!\", \"Don't make me laugh!\", and \"Prepare to Die!\".\n\nThis is also the same in MK11, however he is given new taunts while some of his klassic taunts will be spoken after he wins a round or when he performs a Brutality.\n\nIn a trailer for the game, Shao Kahn uses his Double Down Fatality on Raiden.\n\nIn his victory pose, a slave girl is shown crawling to and hugging his thigh as he proudly stands. This could imply that he has female slaves of his own.\n\nBoth their poses are reminiscent of pulp Conan the Barbarian artwork. In particular, a certain piece by Frank Frazetta.\n\nThis can be further shown in MK11, where he, in an interaction with Cassie Cage, states that Cage would be his new concubine. Kahn goes even further by saying that he likes females with \"fire.\"\n\nShao Kahn's Hammer Throw can be avoided by any female character by simply crouching while the male characters cannot do this. This is due to the hitbox being smaller for female characters in comparison to the male characters.\n\nIn the start of MK 2011's story mode, Shao Kahn appears in his MK vs DCU costume, but is not present in the game. As his MK vs DCU outfit is similar to what he wore during the last leg of the 1st timeline, it was possibly a deliberate decision on the development team's part.\n\nInjustice: Gods Among Us\n\nShao Kahn makes a cameo appearance during Scorpion's intro in Injustice: Gods Among Us.\n\nMortal Kombat X\n\nIn Mortal Kombat X, Ermac may say one of Shao Kahn's taunts, saying \"Feel the Wrath of Shao Kahn!\" during an interaction.\n\nShao Kahn's Hammer and armor can both be seen in Quan Chi's Fortress in Mortal Kombat X.\n\nHis Hammer can also be used as an interactable and a Stage Brutality.\n\nWhen performing the Brutality and using the hammer in general, a green aura will surround the area the hammer slams down on, much like when Shao Kahn used it.\n\nUsing a mod to inspect Shao Kahn's armor in Quan Chi's Fortress shows the armor is damaged, particularly his helmet, in the same fashion as it is was shown in the ending of Mortal Kombat (2011).\n\nShao Kahn does not appear in Mortal Kombat X but only in cameos in character endings, a statue in the Story Mode and the Emperor's Courtyard Stage, and a crumbling statue in the opening credits. He is mentioned by many characters in interactions and by a few in the Story Mode.\n\nShao Kahn does not make a physical appearance in the game.\n\nShao Kahn also cameos in player card backgrounds and icons.\n\nInjustice 2\n\nIn the DC fighting game Injustice 2, although he is not mentioned by Sub-Zero or Raiden who are featured as playable guest characters, Shao Kahn's name appears on multiple pieces of Raiden's gear.\n\nSub-Zero and Raiden will mention Dark Kahn during interactions and clashes, however.\n\nThe way Brainiac sits in his ship and watches the fight in his arena in the DC fighting game Injustice 2 is very similar to how Shao Kahn sits in his thrones in MK 2011, the stages being Shao Kahn's Throne Room and Kahn's Arena, respectively.\n\nMortal Kombat Mobile\n\nShao Kahn is the only Diamond character given by completing the Relic Hunt, unlike the other Diamond cards who are Elite Pack exclusives.\n\nAdditionally, once Shao Kahn has reached his maximum fusion tier, it is impossible to receive his card again as the Relic Hunt becomes disabled once he reaches Tier X.\n\nAnother notable Diamond character card that follow this is Klassic Reptile, who is found in the Quest Mode. Klassic Reptile, however can occasionally appear in Klassic Card Packs.\n\nShao Kahn was the first character card to receive more than more than one exclusive Equipment Card.\n\nShao Kahn's Wrath Hammer was originally a card used by all characters, but with his release, it received an exclusive effect for Shao Kahn.\n\nShao Kahn is the only character that can acquire 4 bars of Super Meter. This can only be achieved if both his Helmet and Wrath Hammer are equipped to his card.\n\nThe fourth bar is not an extra ability, rather just extra Super Meter. It has no symbol for an attack and nothing will happen when the player clicks on it.\n\nIn addition, it requires the same amount of hits needed to fill the first bar of Super Meter.\n\nShao Kahn was the first character with the ability to actually kill his opponent, this being achievable through his Culling The Weak Passive.\n\nIn later updates following Update 2.0, several Diamond character cards would gain the ability to kill their opponent by using a Brutality if specific Equipment Card Sets where added to their cards, killing the opponent after a special Combo-Ender.\n\nSkarlet's MK11 card could possibly fall into this category, as she technically makes the opponent explode using a Blood Ball when she defeats them.\n\nAlthough his character is ported over from MK 2011, he gains a modified X-Ray, where he points and taunts the opponent, before leaping on them and shattering their spine with his Wrath Hammer. The rest of the X-Ray is unchange.\n\nShao Kahn originally was the only Diamond character card with a Stun for his Special 1.\n\nIn a technical sense, Shao Kahn is one of the few characters to tag-in with a special attack.\n\nWhile these characters uses attacking special attacks, Shao Kahn points at the opponent and taunts them when tagging in.\n\nShao Kahn is one of the few characters with a completely unblockable special attack.\n\nMortal Kombat 11\n\nShao Kahn returned in Mortal Kombat 11, becoming the second character in Mortal Kombat history after Goro to be a pre-order bonus character.\n\nShao Kahn appears in the Story Mode, making him one of five characters to appear in a game's Story Mode before becoming playable as a DLC character. The other three are Skarlet, Tanya, Bo' Rai Cho and Sheeva.\n\nHowever, Shao Kahn was announced as a pre-order bonus before his appearance in the Story Mode was revealed.\n\nThis also makes Shao Kahn the first pre-order bonus character to actually have a role in the Story Mode of the game he is a pre-order bonus character in, as Goro had nothing to do with and was not present whatsoever in the MKX Story Mode.\n\nShao Kahn later gains a role in the Aftermath Story Mode expansion.\n\nGoro was, however, the sub-boss in the game's Arcade Tower and regardless if the player purchased him or not, they would still fight him.\n\nShao Kahn is one of the few characters in MK11 with a different voice actor from his last appearance, which was in MK 2011.\n\nFor his appearance in MK Mobile, his only audio is some of his reused taunts from MK 2011. Additionally, he only has three lines used for his Feats of Strength, which are performed by his current voice actor. (See Above.)\n\nShao Kahn is one of two original final bosses in the series that appear as playable characters in MK11. The other is Shang Tsung.\n\nCoincidentally, both are DLC characters for the game. However, Shao Kahn is a pre-order bonus character while Shang Tsung was released in the game post-launch with the Kombat Pack.\n\nThey later share a trait in being playable and serving as major antagonists in the Aftermath Story Mode expansion.\n\nShao Kahn is one of the few characters whose Arcade outfit is identical to his Story Mode appearance.\n\nShao Kahn is one of two Kahns who are playable in MK11, the other is Kotal Kahn, the former Emperor of Outworld in the Current Timeline.\n\nShao Kahn and Kotal Kahn are the only characters with more than 1000 health.\n\nShao Kahn reacts with rage upon learning of Mileena's death. Additionally, he becomes angry when his opponent mocks her during interactions. This is more than likely due to her strong loyalty to Shao Kahn as both an Emperor and father and that Shao Kahn himself cared more about Mileena than he did Kitana as his \"daughter\".\n\nThis is also supported by Shao Kahn hating the idea of Kitana as Kahnum of Outworld and deeming Mileena as an \"improvement over the original\", as stated by Baraka.\n\nWith Sindel's release, during interactions, she too even states that Mileena was as much a daughter to her as Kitana.\n\nUpon delivering a Brutality, Shao Kahn will deliver one of his klassic taunts, such as, \"It's official: You suck!\".\n\nAdditionally, after performing certain combos and winning a round, Shao Kahn may deliver one of his many classic taunts at random.\n\nMany of Shao Kahn's klassic taunts are reused as names for his combos.\n\nShao Kahn cannot be played without his mask on. However, when a Fatal Blow, Krushing Blow, or Fatality is performed on him, his helmet is removed.\n\nSome of Shao Kahn's intros and outros feature him entering and exiting the fight through a giant green portal similar to the ones he used in MK 2011.\n\nShawn Kittelsen confirmed on Twitter that Shao Kahn was not killed in MK11's Story Mode, but was simply blinded by Kitana.\n\nThis was later confirmed in the Aftermath Story Mode expansion.\n\nShao Kahn is one of six announcers for Mortal Kombat 11 and one of five unlockable announcers. The other four are Kronika, Raiden, Johnny Cage and RoboCop.\n\nAfter winning a round, Shao Kahn might turn away from his opponent with his hand raised shouting \"Are you not entertained?!\". This is a reference to the Ridley Scott film Gladiator where Russell Crowe's character, Maximus Decimus Meridius, shouts the phrase at the crowd after killing many opponents in the arena.\n\nMany of Shao Kahn's klassic outfits return through the Kustomization. This includes his appearances from MKII all the way to MK 2011, although subtle changes are made to these outfits.\n\nWith this trait, he is one of the few characters in the game that did not receive a klassic outfit through DLC.\n\nShao Kahn is one of the few characters whose uppercut is from the use of a weapon and not a literal uppercut, resulting in him being one of the few characters that does not literally uppercut the opponent's head off when performing the The Klassic Brutality.\n\nInteractions between Skarlet and Sindel reveal that Skarlet wishes to not only become Shao Kahn's second in command, but also his Queen.\n\nAn interaction with The Terminator shows that Shao Kahn is interested in the machine's success in driving humanity towards extinction in the machine's own timeline.\n\nInteractions with Skarlet and Scorpion reveal it was Shao Kahn himself who taught Skarlet the deadly arts of Blood Magik.\n\nAdditional interactions with Skarlet reveal she wishes to learn Soul Magik, to which Shao Kahn believes is too much for her to handle.\n\nInteractions between Shang Tsung and Skarlet as well as between Noob Saibot and Skarlet reveal that Blood Magik is weaker than Soul Magik.\n\nWith the release of Aftermath, Shao Kahn is one of the few characters with a Throw in a combo rather than a special attack.\n\nMortal Kombat 1\n\nShao's virtue is presented as \"Dominance\".\n\nThis is the first game in which Shao Kahn's Wrath Hammer is absent since its debut, being replaced by a double-sided battle axe. A counterpart of his, named Dark Shao, who allies himself with the alternate version of Shang Tsung wields his original Wrath Hammer.\n\nDespite his movelist having attacks where he impales the opponent with his axe, Dark Shao will still perform these attacks with his Wrath Hammer.\n\nErrors\n\nIn MK Mobile, when Shao Kahn uses his Emperor's Bash Special 2 attack, his hands are incorrectly placed on his hammer during the mini-game.\n\nIn MK11, during Shao Kahn's Bone Krusher Intro, when he points at the opponent, if a Kosmetic Outfit is selected where his left arm is covered in spikes and his fingers are clawed, his fingers will clip through his thumb when he points at the opponent during interactions.\n\nIn MK11, his hands completely change positions from the start of his Back Blown Out Fatality, as his hands are positioned near the head of the hammer as he pulls up on the swing, then appear at the end of the handle when the camera zooms in on the same position when it starts.\n\nAdditionally, as the Fatality starts, the handle for his hammer phases through his hand at the end of the handle.\n\nIn MK11, in the Kustomization and when selecting Shao Kahn before a match, various errors are present depending on Shao Kahn's armor, his hammer, intros and outros, all having different results;\n\nHelmet Errors:\n\nDuring the fighter selection process, if his helmet has extensions by the jaw, these extensions will completely clip through Shao Kahn's armor in the collar area and through his shoulder pads.\n\nDuring the fighter selection process, his helmet can also clip through his shoulder pads. Additionally, the back of his helmet can do this as well.\n\nDuring the fighter selection process, the back of his helmet completely clips through the handle of his hammer when it is placed on his shoulder.\n\nHammer Errors:\n\nDuring the fighter selection process, if Shao Kahn is selected with armor that either is missing a shoulder pad or completely lacking shoulder pads, his hammer will briefly float above his shoulder.\n\nWhen inspecting his Call to Arms Intro along with his Skull and Bones and Quitting Time Outros, if Shao Kahn is selected with armor that either is missing a shoulder pad or completely lacking shoulder pads, his hammer will briefly float above his shoulder.\n\nIf Shao Kahn is equipped with a hammer with the head smaller than his default hammer, the hands of his servant carrying the hammer by the hammer's head will be misplaced during his Heavyweight Intro.\n\nDuring the fighter selection process, Shao Kahn's hammer always clips through the shoulder pad of the shoulder he places his hammer on.\n\nIn MK11, during the fighter selection process, when Shao Kahn clutches his fist at the opponent, his bicep completely clips through his armor's shoulder pad.\n\nIn MK11, after performing his Going Ham.....mer Brutality, if one looks at the opponent's corpse, one can see that the wound where their leg comes off is completely see-through.\n\nIn MK11, the updated version of Wrath Hammer's Krushing Blow requirement is incorrect, as it lists the attack as \"Hammer Throw\".\n\nIn MK11, when Shao Kahn performs the Krushing Blow version of his Last Breath combo, the opponent will incorrectly swap sides when the Krushing Blow is triggered if Shao Kahn performs it with his back not facing the camera.\n\nAdditionally, there is a chance that Shao Kahn's hands will be incorrectly placed when the effect triggers, where he is holding onto and holding up nothing.\n\nIn MK11, during his DIE Krushing Blow, Shao Kahn's spear completely clips through his hand as he stabs the opponent in the chest.\n\nAdditionally, when Shao Kahn performs the Krushing Blow, he is stabbing the opponent with only one hand on the spear, but as soon as the cinematic ends, he is stabbing the opponent in the stomach with his spear with two hands on the spear.\n\nIn MK11, if Shao Kahn wins the match by starting up his DIE combo, the second hit of the combo misses, separating the combo in its entirety despite being the correct distance to perform the combo.\n\nThis in turn can prevent Shao Kahn from either performing a Fatality at the end of the match nor can Shao Kahn perform his Head Kabob Brutality due to the separation of the combo and it not following the Brutality's requirements.\n\nIn MK11, if Shao Kahn successfully performs his Charging Through Brutality from Shoulder Charger's maximum range, the opponent will appear to become cut in half from the head down without Shao Kahn making contact with them or charging through them.\n\nIn MK11, there is a note for Shao Kahn's You Will Never Win combo, stating the combo can not be canceled into special attacks when Flawless Blocked, however the combo can in fact be canceled into specials if Flawless Blocked.\n\nIn MK11, Shao Kahn can perform his Obliterated Brutality on opponents that are not blocking. This occurs during a Last Breath, in which the opponent's Defensive Meter no longer defends the chip damage, however in this case, the Brutality should not trigger given the requirement, since the opponent is forced to stop blocking.\n\nIn MK11, if Shao Kahn performs his Kickin' Reiko Style Brutality on Raiden, the Brutality result is significantly incorrect, where when Shao Kahn kicks Raiden, Raiden's upper body is not destroyed and his legs become duplicated with his still intact torso, although skinned rather than being normal. Why this occurs only on Raiden and what causes this error is unknown.\n\nIn MK11, if Shao Kahn has Wrath Hammer or (Air) Wrath Hammer equipped, playing him in the Klassic Towers or Towers of Time will cause an incorrect note for both attacks, stating \"Coverts Hammer attacks to deal CHAOS damage while active\", this actually being the description for the Dark Priest attack in these modes.\n\nNavigation"
