        "text": "Times have been tough for everyone, especially businesses - not just the small mom-and-pop shop on your corner but even the big box stores and restaurants.\n\nWhile we're seeing retail chains closing stores left and right, the same thing has been happening for restaurants. Those days of exploding franchises popping up all over the country are coming to a close, especially with these 9 franchises that are in North Carolina that could soon be closing locations.\n\n8. Applebee's\n\nApplebee's has closed 300 locations nationwide since 2017, with another 25-35 expected to shut their doors this year as well - which means there won't be eating good in those neighborhoods.\n\nThere is hope for you Applebee's fans as the parent company that owns the chain is looking to create some combined IHOP-Applebee's restaurants, meaning you can get Buttermilk Pancakes and a Bourbon Street Steak without even getting out of your seat.\n\n7. Hardee's\n\nAmericans vote with their wallets every day, and it would seem as though they're voting that they don't want to spend the same price for a fast food burger as a sit-down restaurant burger.\n\nAccording to Eat This Not That, stores around the country are closing already, and more could be on the way.\n\n6. Outback Steakhouse\n\nMaybe sponsoring a golf tournament during tumultuous times for isn't the best business plan. Outback Steakhouse is planning to close about 41 underperforming locations this year, but they're also planning on opening 18 new locations.\n\n5. MOD Pizza\n\nMOD Pizza has closed down 27 restaurants in 11 states as of March of 2024, but more are rumored to come amid bankruptcy rumors.\n\n4. Red Lobster\n\nThis one is one everybody can see coming after not only 100 stores closing in May, but the bankruptcy that came along with it. 570 locations still open across the country, but experts are expecting more to shut their doors.\n\n3. Denny's\n\nApparently Denny's underground metal shows aren't enough to keep the Grand Slams slamming, After 57 locations closed in 2023, another 10-20 locations were rumored to be closing in 2024. Denny's takes up a whole lot of real estate to serve $5 pancackes.\n\n2. TGI Friday's\n\nWe all love Friday's, but apparently not the restaurant. At the start of the year, TGI Friday's reported they would be closing 36 underperforming restaurants. While the East Coast was hit hardest by the closures the casual dining chain will be looking to all of their locations to make sure money is still coming in.\n\n1. Cracker Barrel\n\nCracker Barrel saw a 4% decline in customer traffic in the most recent quarter. While the locations are also opening new locations, many more are closing. This shows that in real estate and restaurants are all about location. Just make sure your location is open before you head out for breakfast."
