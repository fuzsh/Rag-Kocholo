        "text": "Film producer Pahlaj Nihalani, who worked with Govinda in the 1990s, discussed their working relationship and opened up on why they never became close friends. Nihalani spoke about Govinda’s unpredictability, poor career decisions and growing superstitions, which he believed posed risks even during the actor’s peak popularity.\n\nWhile praising Govinda’s acting talent and family commitment, Nihalani also suggested these factors played a role in Govinda’s career challenges. “He gradually became more and more superstitious. He was always a little gullible. He would say that the chandelier is about to fall on set, and ask everyone to move aside. Then he would predict that Kader Khan was going to drown. He would instruct people to change their clothes based on his superstitions. He would refuse to do certain things on certain days. All of this, combined with his tardiness and gullibility, led to his downfall,” Nihalani said.\n\nWhen they first met, Govinda didn’t impress him with his appearance. The next day, Govinda returned with a showreel, claiming to be an excellent dancer as well. But Nihalani said that they never became friends. “We had a connection, but there was always an uncertainty working with him. He would sign dozens of B-grade and C-grade movies without a second thought. He’d be working on five or six movies at the same time, nobody would know where he is. He’d be late constantly. He would lie. He said that he was doing it for the money, and I told him that this is a dangerous way of thinking,” he recalled.\n\nNihalani clarified that they were never friends and mentioned that Govinda would only approach him when facing career challenges, not during successful times. “This industry operates on trust. When the trust breaks… A relationship between an actor and a producer will only last if there’s trust. He didn’t maintain relationships with anybody,” he said."
