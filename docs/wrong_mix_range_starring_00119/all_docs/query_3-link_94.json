        "text": "KARACHI: Shah Rukh Khan and Katrina Kaif’s new film title will be officially unveiled only after “Ek Tha Tiger” releases as Yash Raj Films doesn’t want the movie to overshadow Salman Khan’s August 15 release.\n\nYash Raj Films, producer of both movies, reportedly does not want to publicize the title until the Salman Khan film is in cinemas.\n\n“After discussing lots of potential ideas, Yashji has finalized a title that everybody is incredibly excited about,” said a production source.\n\n“Fans of the classic Yash Raj romance will not be disappointed when they hear what he’s named his first film in eight years.”\n\nIt was earlier rumored that the project would be called “London Ishq”, and later “Yeh Kahaan Aa Gaye Hum”.\n\n“Yashji knows that fans and the media alike will go into frenzy when they hear what he’s come up with, which references a well-known Hindi film dialog,” the insider added.\n\n“That’s why he’s keeping tight lipped about the title until the release of Salman Khan’s Ek Tha Tiger gets over and promotions kick in after Eid on the Shah Rukh starrer.”\n\nChopra’s film with Shahrukh Khan and Katrina Kaif doesn’t have a name yet but has got its location in place. It will be the picturesque Ladakh in the winters. And the sources also heard that the location was locked at khan’s request.\n\nThe film, which also features Anushka Sharma and Anupam Kher, is expected to release in November."
