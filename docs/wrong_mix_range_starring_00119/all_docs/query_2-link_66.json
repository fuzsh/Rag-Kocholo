        "text": "__SHOWQUESTION__Jab Tak Hai Jaan is a huge success, potential blockbusters are in your kitty, you have won the IPL, conquered the ad world… what next?\n\n__SHOWANSWER__A lot of people ask me this question – what else is there for me to achieve? So, if I say 22 crores, 11 Filmfare Awards and one National Award, does that mean after I achieve them, it’s the end for me? If it ends, it means it’s tangible. I’ve seen it all – money, fame and name; as a matter of fact I can retire now. But does it make sense? There are fools who ask Sachin Tendulkar when he will retire. No one thought it was possible to score 100 centuries; but he got them. And maybe he’ll make 500 more. Why are we limiting him after he’s made 100 centuries? I was a lower middle class boy from Delhi when I moved to Mumbai. I had ` 1500 in my pocket and wanted to become big enough to earn a lakh. After I began working, I realised there’s no end line. I believe that money has nothing to do with your personal success. On the face of it, I’m the biggest capitalist of all. I have all the riches. I’m the living proof of what stardom should be in material terms. But I’ve never sold my soul.\n\n__SHOWQUESTION__What do you mean when you say you’ve never sold your soul?\n\n__SHOWANSWER__I’ve not done anything which I didn’t want to do. I’ve not done films for money. I’m not saying this with arrogance but I’ve never asked for a film. At times I have called up a person if I liked his film but I’ve never asked for a film.\n\n__SHOWQUESTION__Is it wrong to ask for a film?\n\n__SHOWANSWER__It’s not about being right or wrong. When I meet young actresses I learn a lot from them. It’s amazing how they manage their careers. I’ve always been close to all my heroines but I’ve never had career discussions with them. Madhuri (Dixit), Juhi (Chawla), Kajol and I were all retarded in our own ways. I don’t know whether it’s for the better or worse. But I appreciate today’s girls. The world has changed and they have adapted to it. We always have this discussion whether it’s okay to ask for a job. I haven’t done it. But it doesn’t mean it’s wrong. It just means that I didn’t like doing it and hence I haven’t sold my soul. On the other hand, I do every ad that I’m offered. I do it for money. But there have been days when I have told my manager that I don’t want to work with a certain person even if he/she is paying me loads of money. I never work with people who don’t make me happy. I don’t watch others’ films if they don’t make me happy. I don’t watch my own films if they don’t make me happy. That may sound silly and arrogant but I’m like that. So, if I don’t like you, I won’t do your film.\n\n__SHOWQUESTION__Is this attitude just limited to your profession?\n\n__SHOWANSWER__No. You could be my son but I won’t do the film. I’ll not ask my son for anything. If he feels like, he can give me. I should get it without asking. Similarly, with films. I don’t think like ‘this is the need of the hour’. Is it bread and butter for me? Films were never bread and butter for me. I’m categorically honest about it. My bread and butter is dancing at weddings. I ask for my bread and butter. I remember, I was dancing at a wedding and I told the host to ask me to dance when the couple has their first baby. This is my job. I’ll ask for it. I’ll ask for ads. I don’t look down upon anyone who asks for a job. It takes guts to ask. But movies are not a job for me. People who consider films as a job should ask for it. There’s a difference between job and work. You ask for jobs while work you just do. I work towards making my children happy. I work towards making my daughter a writer. I do it from my heart. It’s not a job to look after my children. It’s something spiritual for me. My mother taught me to be the giver. One day I might fall from grace and ask for a job but till then I’ll continue doing only what I like. I want to die making films. Roll, camera, action and gone. I’ll be happy if that happens. My family will also be happy if that happens. My kids will be the happiest.\n\n__SHOWQUESTION__Judging by whatever you are saying, money isn’t your thing. Right?\n\n__SHOWANSWER__I hate talking money. I detest it. I have built an empire but I can’t talk money. I’m told by my people that it would have been 10 times bigger an empire had I asked for money. But I know, if I had asked, instead it would have been 10 times smaller. It may sound arrogant but kings don’t ask. Even if it’s the media who calls me the king, I believe it and that’s why I don’t ask. Even a poverty stricken king will never ask. If people ask him for something he’ll give his flesh and blood. I’m from a poor family. I’ve seen the worst. My father was dying and we couldn’t afford the expensive injections. My aunt used to send them from London. But if the course was of 20 injections, we managed only eight. So I’ll never know whether he died because we didn’t have the money or he died because he had to. I come from a place where there was less to eat. I’ve had watery dal and survived. I was sent letters from the school threatening to throw me out because my fees were not paid. Mom and dad would collect change lying below the mattresses and pay for my education. Because I have seen so much poverty, I don’t yearn for money. I can spend all of it in one go. My wife scolds me for this. I spend crores at the drop of a hat – for films, for charity. You ask for money and I’ll give it to you.\n\n__SHOWQUESTION__On the contrary, having seen poverty, doesn’t it make you value money more?\n\n__SHOWANSWER__That’s what my wife keeps telling me. But the fact that I didn’t have money before will ensure it won’t make a difference if I don’t have money now. The only fear is that my children should never be without a house. If you have a house and education, the world is at your feet. If you don’t have a job and money, at least you’ll have a roof to sleep and cry under. I’ve slept on the roads. There have been times I’ve been thrown out of my house because we couldn’t pay the rent. I have been on the roads twice. I tell all the young heroines to please buy a house. I feel happy when they come and tell me that they have actually bought a house. People will always remember me for Mannat. It belittles my other achievements but it’s okay. Beyond your house, whatever you get is value addition. As they say you’re not going to eat money and the food won’t taste better if you eat from a silver plate. I eat the same food, I wear the same clothes. I have four pairs of jeans. How much ever people may think differently of me, I’m exactly the way I was 20 years ago.\n\n__SHOWQUESTION__How do you manage such a big empire with indifference towards money?\n\n__SHOWANSWER__My accountant runs my house. I hate him though. He dies to sit with me. He tries all possible tricks to get five minutes with me. If he wasn’t there, I’d know nothing. I don’t even want to know. Years ago, after Deewana became a hit, I was in Mehboob studio when a filmmaker offered me five lakhs. I had never seen so much money in my life. I took the bag and ran to my wife. I remember telling her with so much money I didn’t need to do anything anymore. My wife looks the rich and snooty type but she’s a simple middle-class girl. She’s not materialistic. She looked at the money and didn’t react much. Suddenly I realised that I had forgotten to ask about the film’s story. I had just been blinded by the money. I felt bad. I went back and returned the money. That day I decided that I’d never take a signing amount.\n\nAfter a few years I stopped charging for films altogether. I had a strong reason for that too. A big producer offered me an unheard of sum of three crores as a signing amount. In today’s age it would be equivalent to 30 crores. I forgot the promise that I wouldn’t work without hearing the story and got carried away by the money. Once Feroz Khan saab got angry with me because I asked him the story. Even Yashji (Chopra) was angry with me once for the same reason.\n\n__SHOWQUESTION__Do you think not asking for money and roles will backfire?\n\n__SHOWANSWER__I’m at peace by not doing certain things. Because I’m not preparing my children to be in films. I’m not waiting for my cycle to get over so that I can tell my son to say ‘hi’ to ‘X uncle’ because he’s going to launch him. It’s not dynastic. I may be the first and the last actor in my family. My children don’t revere my films. They say so if they don’t like my film. Whatever I have is hard-earned. I’m proud and happy. It’s 17 years since Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge. I’m happy I did the film my way. But right now I don’t know what’s next.\n\n__SHOWQUESTION__Does uncertainty scare you?\n\n__SHOWANSWER__I believe uncertainty is the most beautiful place to be in. If I made a film and I knew for a fact that it will be a hit, it would be disturbing. I tell my children two things - get up in the morning and say ‘I don’t know’ and enjoy the ability to go wrong. The problem with success is that you lose the capacity to fail and the capacity to surprise people. So, if I’m able to surprise myself every day, I can surprise you as well. If I enjoy someone’s work and they offer me their project, I do it. My managers come to me with the idea of remaking super hit South Indian films. They ask me to watch it but I never do. Because I know they’re going to be hits. So what’s the point of the supposed creativity? If Mona Lisa could be made by anyone, then it wouldn’t have been the most beautiful painting in the world. The knowledge that you can fail can make you come first.\n\n__SHOWQUESTION__Right now, you’re working with Rohit Shetty on Chennai Express, which looks like a sure-shot blockbuster…\n\n__SHOWANSWER__It’s clear that if Chennai Express flops, it will be Shah Rukh Khan’s flop and not Rohit Shetty’s. He can turn around and say that I make hit films with everyone but SRK failed me. But I’m happy working on this film and I can sense Rohit is also happy doing it with me. He knows that I’ll bring a newness to the film. Also, I’ve wanted to do an over-the-top comedy for a long time. I’m sure Deepika Padukone will be excellent in the film. Few know that Rohit takes his entire team to the shoot. His team comprises his fight master’s mom, make-up man’s son, etc. In a Karan Johar film, you’ll have kids of big stars and famous people working, whereas in Rohit’s films there are kids of fight masters and choreographers. It’s a fantastic team.\n\n__SHOWQUESTION__You only work with established directors or your friends. How do new filmmakers get access to you?\n\n__SHOWANSWER__I worked my ass off and only then did I get a chance to work with Yash Chopra and other big banners. So, the new directors should also do the same and prove themselves. It’s not about them making a hit film. It’s about the kind of film they make. Also, I can come on the set and intimidate you. You can mess up the film because you have me in it. You can also mess it up because it was supposed to be a 15 crore film and now because Shah Rukh Khan is in it, it’s a 200 crore film. A lot of filmmakers are like that. You give them big budgets and they screw it. I came to Mumbai with the dream of working with Kundan Shah and I did it. I worked hard for six years and then got a call from Subhash Ghai. He spent 30 crores on me. I will call the shots because I have earned that with 20 years of experience. Directors have access to me. It’s just that I couldn’t work with them for some reason. I was offered 3 Idiots and Munna Bhai but I couldn’t do them. Anurag Kashyap had narrated No Smoking to me as well but I had to say no because of date problems. Why wouldn’t I do 3 Idiots after seeing Munna Bhai? And I don’t feel good or bad about not doing it. It was not mine.\n\n__SHOWQUESTION__Apparently, Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra offered you Bhaag Milkha Bhaag.\n\n__SHOWANSWER__Rakeysh had offered me Bhaag Milkha Bhaag (BMB). I wish I could have done it. I like Milkha Singh (well-known athlete). He’s my God. I know everything about him. But again, it would not have been good for the film. I believe the same for Lagaan. It’s good that I didn’t do it because I’d have reduced its impact. I’m glad Farhan Akhtar is doing BMB. It takes complete dedication and time. I did Chak De! India because it was over in 32 days. I would not have been able to give BMB the love Farhan is giving it. It would be less of a film with me. I get impatient easily. I saw a picture of Farhan in the entire get up and told him how awesome he looked. You need that kind of dedication to do a biopic. He looks like Milkha Singh physically. It’s outstanding.\n\n__SHOWQUESTION__Of all your performances, which do you like the most?\n\n__SHOWANSWER__As an actor, I like Don and My Name Is Khan the most. And then Chak De! India. I actually like some of my silly films better than Chak De! India. In Chak De! India the role helped me and the character. I just had to grow the beard. In Don, the role didn’t help the character. The film was dry but I had to be sexual, kill people and yet have people cheer for me. A difficult task. My Name Is Khan was somewhere between being commercial and art cinema. Barfi! belongs to a real world. MNIK is an unreal world. And to play an autistic character in between all the trappings of song and romance wasn’t easy. You also have to see MNIK from the perspective of Karan Johar, Kajol and me. We have done films like Kuch Kuch Hota Hai and Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham together. So, it becomes difficult to be in a world which is untrue to even Karan himself. Karan belongs to the world of Student Of The Year. He doesn’t belong to My Name Is Khan."
