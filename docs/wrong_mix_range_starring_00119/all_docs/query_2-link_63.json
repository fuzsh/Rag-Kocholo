        "text": "We all love a good Shah Rukh Khan movie. Our childhood was full of them. No wonder when we hear that the Badshah is signing another film, we get excited about exactly what he’s going to bring to his dedicated audience. This time, it seems like he’s giving us a good dollop of nostalgia by pairing up with our other bachpan-wala crush, R. Madhavan for his directorial debut, ‘Rocketry’. The movie is based on the life of scientist, Nambi Narayanan, whose work was falsely denied due to allegations of spying.\n\nHowever, he was charged with espionage back in 1994 and spent 48 days in jail. It was only in 1996 that these charges were declared as phony by the CBI. He was awarded the Padma Bhushan in 2019.\n\nWhy are we looking forward to this movie?\n\nMovies based on science and space have barely been made well in India. Whichever director has attempted this genre, ends up adding the typical Bollywood masala, love-shuv etc. However, with an actor like Madhavan who has not only been a part of regional cinema as well as Hindi films, it would be interesting to know just how he lets the story unfold in front of his audiences.\n\nAdditionally, SRK is always great to add to any equation. Not only does he bring his charm but also his seemingly effortless onscreen presence that pulls audiences like no other. Since the exact release dates have not been revealed yet, we can only watch out for further announcements from team Rocketry!"
