        "text": "In the Hindi film industry, we have seen a lot of films centred around actors with actresses often in supporting or thankless roles.\n\nThere have only been a few times when an established male Bollywood star has played a supporting role in a film that is centred around a female lead.\n\nTake a look at the list featuring a few of those stars below:\n\n1. Shah Rukh Khan in Dear Zindagi\n\nStarring Alia Bhatt in the lead, Dear Zindagi is a 2016 film directed by Gauri Shinde.\n\nThe movie features Shah Rukh Khan in a supporting role of a psychiatrist. The actor only enters the scene at the interval point.\n\nThis is one of Shah Rukh’s most loved roles in recent times.\n\n2. Ajay Devgn, Anil Kapoor and Jackie Shroff in Lajja\n\nDirected by Rajkumar Santoshi, the 2001 film Lajja stars Manisha Koirala in the lead role and also features Madhuri Dixit, Rekha and Mahima Chaudhary in prominent roles.\n\nAjay Devgn, Anil Kapoor and Jackie Shroff feature in supporting roles in different segments of the film.\n\n3. Sunny Deol in Damini and Chaalbaaz\n\nIn 1989, Sunny Deol played one of the male leads opposite Sridevi (in a double role) in Chaalbaaz. Directed by Pankuj Parashar, the movie centred on Sridevi was a big success at the box office. It also featured Rajinikanth.\n\nA couple of years later, in 1993, Sunny Deol once again took up a supporting role in Rajkumar Santoshi’s Damini starring Meenakshi Sheshadri in the lead.\n\nSunny Deol played a lawyer in the film who enters the narrative only in the second half. His portrayal won him a National Film Award for Best Supporting Actor.\n\n4. Abhishek Bachchan in Phir Milenge\n\nBased on the 1993 film Philadelphia starring Tom Hanks and Denzel Washington, Phir Milenge starred Shilpa Shetty in the lead role.\n\nDirected by Revathy, the movie featured Abhishek Bachchan in the role of a lawyer. Phir Milenge also featured Salman Khan in a crucial cameo.\n\n5. Dharmendra in Seeta Aur Geeta"
