        "text": "Locarno has revealed this year’s official selection.\n\nKnown auteurs Hong Sang-soo (“By the Stream”) and Wang Bing (“Youth (Hard Times)”) will now battle it out in the official selection, which will welcome 17 world premieres. Italy will be represented by Sara Fgaier’s “Sulla Terra Leggeri” and “Luce,” directed by Silvia Luzi and Luca Bellino. Ala Eddine Slim’s “Agora” will also be shown, as well as Ben Rivers’ “Bogancloch,” “Cent Mille Milliards” by Virgil Vernier and Saulė Bliuvaitė’s “Toxic.”\n\n“We are very excited and happy with our selection, which we believe represents the best of contemporary filmmaking. We have taken special care in highlighting those works that, while broadening the possibilities of cinema, are also consciously trying to spark a more meaningful conversation with the audience,” stated artistic director Giona A. Nazzaro, adding that the fest “continues to offer itself up as a platform for intersectional dialogue.”\n\nThe audience will get to discover Ramon Zürcher’s “The Sparrow in the Chimney,” Marta Mateus’ “Fire of Wind,” “Green Line” by Sylvie Ballyot and “Death Will Come” by Christoph Hochhäusler. “Mond” directed by Kurdwin Ayub, Mar Coll’s “Mothers Don’t,” Pia Marais’ “Transamazonia,” “New Dawn Fades” by Gürcan Keltek and “Drowning Dry” by Laurynas Bareiša round up the section.\n\nThe event, which will celebrate its 77th edition, also announced the recipients of Excellence Awards Davide Campari: Mélanie Laurent and Guillaume Canet, dedicated to “performers with extraordinary careers.”\n\nFrench stars will be seen in this year’s opening film, “Le Déluge,” by Gianluca Jodice, about the last days of Marie-Antoinette and Louis XVI. According to Nazzaro, the film features their “career-defining performances.”\n\n“Mélanie Laurent and Guillaume Canet have forged personal and identifiable acting paths for themselves over the years. Working in the service of a French and European tradition of an auteur cinema that often intersects with the reasons of a cultured popular cinema, the two performers have shown extraordinary sensitivity in the composition of their roles, thus giving rise to artistic, personal trajectories that are appreciated by audiences,” he said.\n\nAs already announced, this year’s edition will welcome the likes of Jane Campion, who will receive Pardo d’Onore Manor and show her beloved masterpiece “The Piano,” producer Stacey Sher (Raimondo Rezzonico Award), actor Irène Jacob (set to receive Leopard Club Award) and India’s icon himself, Shah Rukh Khan (Pardo all Carriera Ascona-Locarno Tourism). Ben Burtt will pick up Vision Award Ticinomoda and Claude Barras – Locarno Kids Award la Mobiliare.\n\nFinally, Piazza Grande selection will feature six world premieres among its 18 titles. From “Electric Child” by Simon Jaquemet to the aforementioned “Le Déluge,” “Mexico 86” by César Díaz, Paz Vega’s directorial effort “Rita” and two world premieres of restored versions: “The Fall (Restored Cut)” and Godard’s “Une Femme Est Une Femme.”\n\n“The selection presents, as expected, celebrated auteurs while also introducing new directors who we are certain will play a major role with their films in the future,” said Nazzaro about Locarno picks.\n\nLocarno Film Festival will take place from August 7 – 17, 2024. You can find the full lineup here:\n\nOfficial Selection\n\n“Agora”\n\nDir.
