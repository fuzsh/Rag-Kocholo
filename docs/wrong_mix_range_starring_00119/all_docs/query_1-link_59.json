        "text": "#10: “Dil To Pagal Hai” (1997)\n\nIf there’s any movie that best exemplifies Bollywood’s penchant for extravagant dancing sequences and elaborate set pieces, then this is it. While Khan was already an established romantic hero, “Dil To Pagal Hai” took his name to the stratosphere. He plays Rahul, the director of a musical. The love triangle he forms with characters played by Karisma Kapoor and Madhuri Dixit is one for the ages. Here, the protagonists struggle with their feelings while rehearsing for a show that will define their careers. With memorable songs, dances, and Khan’s electric chemistry with Dixit, “Dil To Pagal Hai” is a feast for the eyes. The combined might of Khan and Dixit’s individual star power made it a critical and financial hit.\n\n#9: “Darr” (1993)\n\nNo matter how many times he’s played the hero, SRK’s villainous portrayal of an obsessive lover in “Darr” won’t be forgotten. It helps that he made a now-iconic delivery of the name “Kiran” that fans will never forget. The role of the terrifying Rahul Mehra was rejected by a number of leading actors for fear of damaging their careers. However, Khan made it the most memorable part of the movie. “Darr” is about Rahul’s unrelenting pursuit of Kiran Malhotra as he looks to eliminate her lover, Sunil, from the picture. The violence and obsession depicted by the character is nightmare-inducing. Somehow, Khan kept viewers captivated all the way through. Darr’s” success made it clear that SRK was a talent no one could ignore.\n\n#8: “Devdas” (2002)\n\nDirector Sanjay Leela Bhansali is renowned for his work of period dramas. “Devdas” took us back to the early 1900s. Easily the most famous of the many adaptations of the 1917 novel, the movie follows the titular character’s descent. After familial pressures cause him to lose Paro, the love of his life, Devdas’ inability to carry on without her is shown in agonizing detail. Among all of Khan’s works, this one arguably contains his greatest acting performance. His powerhouse portrayal showed how he backs up his A-list status with roles that cut on a deeper level. It’s a sad tale of a character doomed to fail. Throughout the work, we can feel all the pain of Devdas’ inner turmoil thanks to Khan.\n\n#7: “Pathaan” (2023)\n\nAfter a mixed box office response in the 2010s, Khan slowed things down for four years until he made a big comeback with “Pathaan.” This movie is an entertaining action flick that doesn’t miss. The titular protagonist is a RAW agent looking to take down a former patriot threatening the country. “Pathaan’s” straightforward premise makes way for action spots and snappy dialogue that highlight the main character’s cool persona. Of course, the reveal that “Pathaan” is set in Salman Khan’s “Tiger” universe took the hype to new level. The Tiger character himself even makes a cameo! Thanks to Khan’s committed performance and a memorable soundtrack, “Pathaan” turned out to be the perfect comeback film for the A-lister.\n\n#6: “Jawan” (2023)\n\nIn this thrilling tale, SRK plays both roles of a vigilante father and son. Despite relying on its action status to pull audiences in, “Jawan” has many twists and turns that complement its story. Khan’s double duty as the father-son duo with contrasting personalities is remarkable. Smart political commentary also provides an interesting spin on things. As the characters’ true motivations come to light, viewers become more invested in where their journeys will end. “Jawan” takes a different route than the standard Bollywood action thriller. Its unique qualities make it a genre reinvention that’s bolstered by Khan’s presence in the starring role.\n\n#5: “Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham…” (2001)\n\nThe dream of seeing megastars like Shah Rukh Khan, Kajol, Hrithik Roshan, Amitabh and Jaya Bachchan come together was finally achieved with Karan Johar’s family-oriented film. Roshan’s character sets out to reunite his parents with the family’s estranged first son, played by SRK. “K3G” can be everything from funny to dramatic to heartwarming. Khan’s turn as the dutiful son of a business magnate also hits hard. Throughout the story, his character is torn between living up to his father’s expectations and his love for a woman below their rich status. The talented cast does justice to the theme of familial conflicts. Khan’s dynamic with Amitabh and Jaya Bachchan receiving particular praise. Its dedication to family themes left a big impact on audiences.\n\n#4: “Baazigar” (1993)\n\nIf you want to take a look at SRK’s breakthrough, you’ll want to revisit “Baazigar,”. The film marked the iconic pairing of Khan with Kajol. Here, SRK plays an anti-hero with a vendetta. Main character Ajay Sharma seeks revenge against Madan Chopra for his father’s death. As a result, the anti-hero targets his enemy’s daughters. The romantic thriller gives reasons to both sympathize and despise Khan’s character as he breaks moral boundaries in his quest for vengeance. “Baazigar’s” stirring soundtrack and the Khan-Kajol chemistry propelled it to commercial success. Khan also won tons of critical praise, snagging the first of his record eight Filmfare Awards for Best Actor with the film.\n\n#3: “Kal Ho Naa Ho” (2003)\n\nKhan’s knack for heartbreaking characters continued with this slice-of-life romantic drama. He plays Aman Mathur, a man with a terminal heart condition. “Kal Ho Naa Ho” starts off with a lighter touch when Aman arrives in the Kapur family’s lives. Naturally, the big reveal turns everything upside down. “Kal Ho Naa Ho” was lauded for depicting the struggles of Overseas Indians during the early 2000s, as Aman encourages the Kapurs to stick to their cultural values. The love triangle between characters played by SRK, Preity Zinta, and Saif Ali Khan is also crucial to the sprawling story about perseverance and holding on to loved ones. It all comes together with a finale that arguably makes for the most tear-inducing ending of any Khan film.\n\n#2: “Kuch Kuch Hota Hai” (1998)\n\nKhan’s filmography is filled with movies about love triangles. But there’s no doubt that this one is right at the top. Split into two time periods eight years apart, we watch the actor in his quintessential “Rahul” role. The first love triangle features college student Rahul, his best friend Anjali, and love interest Tina. Nearly a decade later, the widowed Rahul reconnects and falls in love with the now-engaged Anjali. The movie is filled with warm-hearted sentiments, uplifting songs, and clever execution of its narrative framework. The Khan-Kajol pairing also does wonders again. They convincingly portray characters who realize their feelings far too late. After its release, its critical praise and box office success made this movie a must see.\n\nBefore we unveil our top pick, here are a few honorable mentions.\n\n“Veer-Zaara” (2004)\n\nA Heart Wrenching Love Story That Transcends International Borders\n\n“Main Hoon Na” (2004)\n\nAn Action Comedy with a Lot of Heart\n\n“Chak De! India” (2007)\n\nKhan’s Character Takes the Women’s Hockey Team to Glory\n\n“My Name Is Khan” (2010)\n\nA Tragic Depiction of Post-9/11 Struggles for Muslims\n\n#1: “Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge” (1995)\n\nThe film that truly made SRK a household name, “DDLJ’s” influence can still be felt. It’s so impactful that it’s been running at the Maratha Mandir theater for more than 1200 weeks and counting! The story follows Raj and Simran as they fall in love…despite objections from the latter’s father. This concept of going against societal norms was something new at the time of the film’s release. As a result, the movie was a game-changer in terms of genre storytelling. But it’s “DDLJ’s” overall presentation that stands out the most. It has instantly recognizable songs, gorgeous costume designs, and incredibly scenic European and Indian locations. Its famous train scene sets it apart as an unparalleled Khan and Bollywood classic.\n\nWhich SRK movie do you think is just “Pyaar”? Let us know in the comments."
