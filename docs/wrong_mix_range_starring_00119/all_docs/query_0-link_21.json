        "text": "Kartik Aaryan and Kriti Sanon starrer Shehzaada’s release has been pushed back by a week 'out of respect' for Pathaan’s success. This explains the enormous popularity and love the action thriller is enjoying right now.\n\nAs per TOI, Pathaan grossed over Rs 100 crore worldwide on the very first day of its release, becoming the biggest Bollywood opener of all time. As per Indian Express, Pathaan is expected to reach the Rs 300-crore mark domestically by the end of its first week. It has already crossed the Rs 500-crore mark globally.\n\nCheck out a few interesting facts about the film here\n\nAmong the several box office records created by Pathaan, it is also the highest-grossing opening day domestically for its three main actors - SRK, Deepika Padukone and John Abraham. With a first-day domestic collection of Rs 55 crore, Pathaan went past SRK-Padukone starrer Happy New Year (Rs 44.97 crore) and Abraham’s Satyameva Jayate (Rs 19.50 crore), per Firstpost.\n\n2. Widest release for a Hindi film\n\nPathaan was released in more than 100 countries, in nearly 8000 worldwide screens – 5,500 domestic screens and 2,500 international screens, which is the widest release ever for a Hindi film. 300 shows were increased by exhibitors after the first show due to the high demand for tickets.\n\n3. First-ever SRK first film to have a 6 am show\n\nPathaan is the first-ever SRK film that had its first show as early as 6 am on its opening day. “We have a phenomenal opening of Pathaan with advances of close to 5 lac admissions for the first long weekend of the movie releasing on January 25. This will be the first SRK film that will open at 6 am in PVR cinemas,” Sanjeev Kumar Bijli, Joint Managing Director of PVR Limited told India Today.\n\n4. Aamir Khan’s sister plays SRK’s mother in the film\n\nNikhat Khan, who is the sister of Aamir Khan, has played the role of SRK's foster mother in Pathaan. Along with Pathaan, the veteran actor is also known for films like Tanhaji (2020), Saand Ki Aankh (2019) and Mission Mangal (2019).\n\n5. Besharam Rang registered 100 million views in 10 days\n\nBesharam Rang, which came out a month ago, received 100 million views on YouTube in just 10 days. Currently, the video, posted by YRF, has over 260 million views. The song has been written by Kumaar and Vishal Dadlani and sung by Shilpa Rao, Caralisa Monteiro, and Vishal and Shekhar.\n\n6. The first Indian film to be shot in Lake Baikal\n\nPathaan is the first Indian film that was shot at the frozen Lake Baikal in Siberia. Director Siddharth Anand revealed in an interview with India Today that they bought special equipment from Moscow to shoot a sequence at the high-altitude lake. “Every equipment needed to shoot this high risk sequence had to be shipped from Moscow which is almost about 2000 kilometres away from where we were shooting! So, this was a huge task which the production very smoothly handled. We ended up shooting the most visually stunning chase sequence on frozen ice and biting cold and I hope this sequence will make people jump off their seats because we are truly very happy with how it has shaped up.” Among other locations Pathaan was shot in are Spain, Russia, France, Italy, UAE, Afghanistan and India.\n\n7. First Bollywood film to be shot with IMAX cameras\n\nPathaan is the first Bollywood film to be completely shot on digital IMAX cameras, known as the IMAX DMR, which stands for Digital Media Remastering process.\n\n8. Pathaan’s action director\n\nOne of Hollywood’s best action directors, Casey O'Neill directed the action sequences of Pathaan. For the uninitiated, O’Neill worked as a Stunt Coordinator for films like Top Gun: Maverick, Mission Impossible and Captain America. “He brings in a wealth of experience and he immediately bought into the idea of creating edge-of-the-seat action for Pathaan that could match what he’s done back home in Hollywood. What Casey has created in Pathaan, is simply mind-boggling,” director Siddharth Anand was quoted as saying by The Telegraph."
