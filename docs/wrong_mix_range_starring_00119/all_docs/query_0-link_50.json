        "text": "The numbers prove that Bollywood’s Shah Rukh Khan is the biggest movie star in the world.\n\nIndia’s film industry turns out more films annually than both the U.S. and China. In 2012, Bollywood sold 2.6 billion cinema seats, compared to Hollywood’s 1.36 billion tickets.\n\nIn 2014, Khan was making more money than Tom Cruise.\n\nAnd the quietly- spoken smoker with the lean frame, thick head of hair and neat line in self-deprecating humor knows how to leverage his fame for business. He’s starred in over 70 films with the latest, Dilwale, meaning big-hearted, playing to appreciative audiences.\n\nKing Khan, as he’s known in India, owns production house Red Chillies Entertainments, Indian Premier League cricket franchise Kolkata Knight Riders, and children’s entertainment company KidZania.\n\nDirected by Rohit Shetty, Dilwale is being produced by Red Chillies Entertainments Pvt. Ltd and Rohit Shetty Productions.\n\nI’ve interviewed him before, and this time round, met him with invited journalists in London for a launch of his current movie. Fans appear wherever Khan does, and outside the hotel where we were, they stood expectantly, carrying placards with spaces for signatures.\n\nI wanted to know how two big hitters on the Indian film scene, Khan’s Red Chillies Entertainments and Director Rohit Shetty came together commercially. (Khan and Shetty worked together on the record-breaking Chennai Express too).\n\nFor Dilwale, Red Chillies is handling distribution. Khan told me,\n\nWith Red Chillies or any of the production houses, there are two ways to work now; one is to do the business end of the film. Red Chillies does the business end of the film. But online production, you can put it out to the director’s team. Rohit has an amazing team of people that he doesn’t work without- 200 people he’s carried forward over the past 10 films. So you don’t try to change that and say ‘We’ll bring in the creative team.’ Obviously, because I worked with him in “Chennai,” I know the creative team. They’re fantastic. Young boys and girls. So the creative part, the onus of online work is with Rohit’s team, while the back end, where the business is done, is with Red Chillies.\n\nAs a creative producer, if I was to take myself out of Red Chillies, I’m only creative when I’m working in the film as an actor too. I don’t think I would take the onus of being creative and sitting with the film. We are producing some films without me. I will sit down and tell them what to do with their work. Because I think creativity needs to be free flowing. I’m an actor in the film, I know the script and storyline. Maybe I’ll give a few things [ideas]; all of us do that, it’s not just individualistic to me because I’m the producer. All of us will say, ‘we’ll try to do the scene like this, we’ll break it down like that.’ Just that much. Otherwise on the question of who gets the final creative call, if you have a good team, like we had in Rohit and us, It’s just very mutual. You’re open to discussion, you can criticise each other, and you can praise each other, be happy; not like something and not be scared to voice it to each other knowing that we’re talking about the film, not as individuals.\n\nSRK, as Khan is also known, describes his current film as a love story. In it, he’s paired with an actress he’s worked with for 22 years, Kajol. With Dilwale being a “holiday time family film, ” the 50-year old described the romantic narrative with Kajol as being “intense, fast and furious” running parallel with a “nice, sweet, pretty” tale between two younger actors in the film, Kriti Sanon and Varun Dhawan.\n\nIn India, the commercial film industry tradition requires movie directors and writers to pitch by narrating the film’s plot to hook a star’s interest. The script may not even be fully written, though bound copies do get presented to actors once production starts.\n\nKhan is sanguine on how directors see Khan and Kajol;\n\nFor them it is important to reinvent us. There is a whole set of directors, including Rohit, who... already have a different style of filmmaking. They want us to be romantic but in the sensibilities that they believe. While retaining the dignity and the kind of things that we have created [in previous characters] Anjli, and Raj and Rahul. So I think it’s a very interesting mix and... Rohit came and said 'I want to cast Kajol in it because apart from the romance part of the film, the respect around her....It’s my take on what you guys could be.' And at times, I’ll be honest, we didn’t think some of the scenes were working because they were alien to us. Then one night he called us into the van and said ‘We have an editing line’ (because we have to simultaneously edit). When he showed it to us, genuinely, without having to say a word to each other, we were like, ‘oh wow.’ This is genuinely different and at the same time, same same.\n\nOn the Dilwale pitch he said, “You have no questions most of the time because you’re rolling on the floor because of the narration. It is a like a Rohit Shetty film but it has this very unlikely element ...very familial... The last half an hour is about family, about goodness, about love, about virtues and values.”\n\nThe star claims his own definition of love changes, but that in Dilwale, it’s about being “able to forgive each other when you love each other. Being able to have the space and freedom to be yourself and have your partners respect you...This one [film] will make you feel a lot of love for family. The kind of angst-y relationship that Kajol and me (sic) share, the kind of fun and real and honest one that Kriti and Varun share...will make you feel love, even in the stressful situations like ours in the film. That’s a promise.”\n\nHe answers questions politely and thoughtfully, tending to give way to others. He’s inclusive and generous, as in when he was asked about how he works with young recruits like Sanon and Dhawan.\n\n“In movies, actors don’t have an age. So you don’t treat each other by any aspect that makes you different. You just play the characters you play. You have to respect the fact that they will bring something new to the table. And as an actor, you always learn from each other.”\n\nOn the potential longevity of the film, he said,\n\n“I hope you guys wear this DVD out over the next 20 years. Which will mean that we’ve been able to entertain you. And there’s nothing more from any of us than to make you feel that we brought a smile to your face for a couple of seconds when you watch the film. That’s the biggest gift that you can give us.\"\n\nHe also revealed that, as a college student in Delhi, he got beaten up a lot, describing it as good practise for the make-believe fight scenes he came to do later on film.\n\nThough Khan remains India’s best loved actor, he still has dreams, one of which is to make a definitive Indian film that will grab international attention.\n\nThe press in India tends to hyperventilate over each word uttered by its stars, re-interpreting meaning with each reprint. Khan has frequently been the recipient of this kind of attention, but remains stoical about a free press.\n\nFreedom of expression means that. You say something, somebody else says something, which might be contrary, or discuss it. But I personally believe that most of the stuff that is talked about, instead of taking a radical point of view about an x sentence or y sentence any of us makes, I think you should think of it as a platform for discussion. Not for decision or derision or giving a final comment on it. And we have the internet, the social media, where you can discuss stuff. It’s not meant to be the end all. Like if I say I think so and so about this film, and if somebody says I think so and so it can’t be taken that this is the ultimate truth. I think most of social media is about discussion. Not the passing out [of] the judgement. As soon as we realise that, then you overlook the idiots who pass judgements. You say, ‘OK, I’m not coming there for a decision on social media or tweeting something....we just want to have a discussion.’ If you keep it like that, then freedom of expression means you can talk contrary to each other and express yourself. It’s not that it’s changed more; I think we see it more because now there’s so much accessibility to everybody.\n\nHaving said that, I think there is no issue about actors saying what they want, or any profession saying whatever they feel like. We should talk about things and it’s nice to talk."
