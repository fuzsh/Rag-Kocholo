Whatever they will make of my life will just be a success story which I think is extremely boring,\" Shah Rukh said in an interview.\n\nShah Rukh started his journey with television shows like \"Fauji\" and \"Circus\" and later made a switch to films with \"Deewana\". The actor initially played anti hero parts in films such as \" Baazigar\", \"Darr\" , \"Anjaam\", but soon went on to become the king of romance courtesy his movies like \"Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge\", \"Dil to Pagal Hai\" and \"Kuch Kuch Hota Hai\".\n\nFrom having a fight with Salman Khan in 2008 to the Wankhede brawl, Shah Rukh has had his fair share of controversies, but the actor still believes he has to do something \"controversial\" to make his biopic interesting enough for the audience.\n\n\"If it's not controversial then it will be a boring story. I am telling you success stories are very boring. I would not like anyone to make it but I am not saying I don't want anyone to make a biopic on me but I don't think it's a great subject... not as yet,\" he said."
