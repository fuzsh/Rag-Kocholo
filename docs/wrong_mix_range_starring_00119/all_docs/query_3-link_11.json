        "text": "Shah Rukh Khan, the King of B-town, might just be expanding his influence far beyond Bollywood. His presence in cinema transcends boundaries and now, it is getting documented in films and web series. From having film characters sing his praise to having other characters dance to his iconic tunes, here's a list of times when SRK was mentioned or referenced in films and web series.\n\n​In the recent series 'Interview With a Vampire,' Shah Rukh Khan unexpectedly found himself in the spotlight, albeit in a conversation between characters. A viral clip from the series features Eric Bogosian's character, Daniel Molloy, saying, \"I'm sorry, this is so weird. Where did they send you when Shah Rukh Khan, over here was playing you?\" This mere reference set social media abuzz, with fans celebrating the global recognition of the superstar.\n\nAnother reference to SRK was made in the Karan Johar film 'Rocky Aur Rani Kii Prem Kahaani'. This time, it wasn't just the superstar, but also his iconic residence, Mannat, that received a witty mention in the dialogue, \"Parking basement mein hai! Aur Shah Rukh Mannat mein hain.\"\n\n​\n\nThe Regency drama 'Bridgerton' got a desi twist in Season 2 and it did so by paying homage to Bollywood royalty. The show became the hot topic of discussion when it featured an orchestral cover of the title track from 'Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham.' This subtle nod to Shah Rukh's blockbuster showcased the enduring impact of his films.\n\n​\n\n​Even in a Salman Khan starrer like 'Sultan,' Shah Rukh Khan's influence could be felt in a romantic song sequence. A character tries to poke fun at Salman's character's antics, likening it to Shah Rukh Khan's style. However, he then defends the King of hearts, saying, \"Don't make fun of Shah Rukh Khan. I like him a lot. When he looks into a girl's eyes, even a blind girl falls for him.\"\n\nThe Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) does not have a desi superhero, but it has Shah Rukh Khan! In the second episode of 'Ms Marvel', the superhero, Kamala Khan declares, \"There's no such thing as a bad Shah Rukh Khan movie.\" In the series, she also references iconic Bollywood films like 'Baazigar' and 'Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge.'"
