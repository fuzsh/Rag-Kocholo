Karan Johar's directorial romantic drama, Ae Dil Hai Mushkil unfolded as a captivating tale of unrequited love, friendship, and heartbreak. This poignant story has garnered a dedicated fan following, and the unexpected cameo by King Khan added to its visual splendor.\n\nThe story revolves around Alizeh (Anushka Sharma) who continues to have feelings for her ex-boyfriend Ali (Fawad Khan) while she meets Ayan (Ranbir Kapoor) who has an incredible bond with her. Saba (Aishwarya Rai) is seen as a divorced poetess who meets heartbroken Ayan and falls in love.

The film narrated the pure love saga between childhood friends Dev and Paro.\n\nWhile everyone expects them to get married after they grow up, however, things don’t go as merry. The cast difference and ego clashes come in the forefront, with love taking a backseat.\n\nSRK and Aish's electrifying chemistry, coupled with unforgettable scenes and outstanding performances by the actors, along with a timeless musical album, creates an enriching viewing experience.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n3.

Though SRK and Aish weren’t paired opposite each other, the diva’s special appearance was something which no one was expecting.\n\nThe film was about Radha (Madhuri Dixit) who shares a great bond with her childhood friend, Suraj (Salman Khan). Radha is wedded to Gopal (Shah Rukh Khan), a controlling and unpleasant individual who harbors misconceptions and constantly suspects Radha and Suraj of being romantically involved. However, everything takes a different turn when Gopal discovers that Suraj has a girlfriend named Suman (Aishwarya Rai Bachchan).\n\nAdvertisement\n\n4.

From Shah Rukh Khan’s iconic violin playing to sweater over the shoulders and actresses dancing in the picturesque setting in chiffon saree, this film had it all.\n\nThe movie narrates the story of a strict principal, Narayan (Amitabh Bachchan) who is against love. Despite the fact, his three students from Gurukul fall in love, and what follows is a ride filled with twists and turns. Furthermore, the backstory tells us how his daughter, Megha (Aish) had committed suicide for her love.\n\n5. Josh (2000)\n\nCast: Shah Rukh Khan, Aishwarya Rai Bachchan, Chandrachur Singh, Sharad S. Kapoor, Priya Gill, Sharat Saxena, Vivek Vaswani, Anjan Srivastav, Suhas Joshi\n\nDirector: Mansoor Khan\n\nIMDb Rating: 6.1/10\n\nMovie Genre: Action, Drama, Musical\n\nRelease year: 2000\n\nWhere to watch: Sony Liv and YouTube\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJosh was Aishwarya Rai and Shahrukh Khan first movie, released in 2000. The action-drama film narrates the story of two rival street gangs-The Bichhoos (Scorpions), who are local residents, and the Eagles, who are immigrants led by Prakash Sharma and Max Dias (Sharad Kapoor and SRK) respectively. The two have demarcated areas to avoid altercations. However, it all changes when Prakash’s brother returns from Mumbai and falls in love with Max’s sister, Shirley (Aish).\n\nA beautiful watch brings a fresh breeze of air with beautiful shoot locations of Goa and melodious songs in the film.\n\nWhile we enjoy watching Aishwarya Rai and Shah Rukh Khan in movies, it's true that we do miss seeing them together onscreen.
