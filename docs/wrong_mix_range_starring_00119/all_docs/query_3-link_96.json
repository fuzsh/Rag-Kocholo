        "text": "You know 2018 is going to be a fantastic year, when one of the biggest superstars in the country,Â Shah Rukh Khan, decides to name his next filmÂ Zero.\n\nThe film we’ve all been waiting for, SRK-Anand L Rai’s next film, is titled Zero, and the teaser for the much awaited films is here.\n\nThe movie, which will see Shah Rukh in a never-seen-before avatar, and also features Anushka Sharma and Katrina Kaif.\n\nShah Rukh and Rai engaged in banter over the pending announcement on Twitter. The actor asked the filmmaker about when the title should be announced, and they reached a conclusion toÂ release it at 5 p.m. on Monday.\n\nSRK asked Rai, â.@aanandlrai sir, title kab announce karna hai? Ya 2018 mein bhi gaaliyan khaani hain?! @AnushkaSharma #KatrinaKaif,â to which the filmmaker replied, âArre sir apno ki gaaliyaan hain, khaa lenge ðPar aap bataao ? 1st January kaisa rahega ?â\n\nKhan then asked if Rai would only announce the title: âAccha rahega&mldr;Par sirf title announce karoge ya kuch dikhaaoge bhi? @AnushkaSharma #KatrinaKaifâ The filmmaker was more than happy to add, âNaye Saal ka pehla din hai Khan Saab!!! Kuch dikha bhi dena chahiye&mldr;.ð @AnushkaSharma #KatrinaKaif.â\n\nÂ Shah Rukh Khan’sÂ character Â in ZeroÂ will be three feet tall, and VFX is being used to make him and the other ‘dwarf’ characters look realistic. The film will celebrate the differently abled rather than sympathise with them, the star revealed in anÂ interview . This is why he and Rai don’t want people to see it as a ‘dwarf’ film.\n\nZeroÂ is all set to release on 21 December, 2018.\n\nWatch the teaser here:"
