        "text": "News\n\nentertainment\n\nhindi\n\nbollywood\n\nZayed Khan: Shah Rukh Khan was amazed with what I did in our first scene in 'Main Hoon Naa'\n\nZayed Khan: Shah Rukh Khan was amazed with what I did in our first scene in 'Main Hoon Naa'\n\nZayed Khan's Bollywood journey, guided by Farah Khan, led to significant milestones alongside stars like Shah Rukh Khan and memorable experiences with co-stars like Amrita Rao and Sushmita Sen. The on-set camaraderie and film's impact resonate deeply.\n\nZayed Khan started his acting journey with director Farah Khan , marking a big moment in his Bollywood career. With Farah's guidance, he tackled his first role, gaining recognition as a promising talent. The film starred Shah Rukh Khan, Suniel Shetty, and Naseeruddin Shah. As the film completes 10 years, the actor recalls his debut film and co-stars, Amrita Rao , Farah Khan, and Shah Rukh Khan.\n\nWhat is your first memory of Main Hoon Na ?\n\nWhen Farah Khan sat in her car and looked at me and said, âSend me your measurements, You are in my film.â That was the most amazing thing to hear. It was very surreal. I had gone to her for something else, and something completely different happened. It was one of the most life-changing moments.\n\nWhat was your first day of shooting like?\n\nIt was an interesting day. I was a big fan of Shah Bhai (Shah Rukh Khan). We were staying at a quaint guest house called Windermere in Darjeeling. I remember Shah Rukh arriving, and we were all having dinner together. We were just gauging each other as to how all this was going to work out. Because when someone starts working with people they admire, it sends a shiver down spine.\n\nThe first day when I went to the set, it was so huge and beautiful at St. Paulâs School during the winter break. We had a unit of about 150 people. We had to start with the song and dance sequence of 'Chale Jaise Hawaaiyen'. It was what movie magic is all about. There was a lovely positivity in the air. The first thing that Farah made us do was take all of us for a walk to a temple that was on top of Darjeeling to take blessings. Then the first shot happened. And I was in the mood.\n\nWhat was it like working with Shah Rukh Khan?\n\nMy first scene with Shah Rukh was where he meets Boman Irani, and Iâm supposed to push him. The scene was written differently, but I played it a little differently. When I started doing my antics with him, Farah said, âWhat are you doing?â And Shah Rukh sweetly said, âLet him do what he wants to do. Itâs nice.â Shah Rukh was amused by the whole thing, the way I did it in that scene.\n\nI remember Farah coming and telling me not to push him too hard. I think he had a back issue. He was very endearingâtypically Shah Rukh. He was letting me have my day. He didnât interfere with how I was portraying anything. He was vibing with me, absorbed what I did, and reacted accordingly. I asked him whether I pushed him too hard. He gave his typical Shah Rukh smile and told me, âYou do what you are doing.â\n\nWe really got along, and our play was quite on point. Our rhythm was right. We broke the ice in that scene, and I had a beautiful relationship with him thereafter. He was a big fan of the FIFA video game, and so was I. So, we used to have video game matches, and we were strong competitors. If you ask me, Iâll say I won. If you ask him, he will say he won. But he used to make me play till he won. I found it very endearing that he loved video games in his late 30s. It was a happy set. Everybody was there to make movie magic happen and was ready to give whatever it took.\n\nHow was it working with Amrita Rao and Sushmita Sen?\n\nI used to love taking the piss out of Amrita. Because she was so sweet and innocent at the time, and I was a naughty bugger. She used to have a peculiar way of saying certain things. I used to say, âSay that again.â Then she used to get coy about how she said things. Then I sat her down and said that we were just joking. Initially, she took a while to break the ice with me. She soon realized that I was an absolute nutcase, and then she also became a nutcase. It was amazing.\n\nI had never met Sush before. Sushmita was so poised and posh. When she came onto the set, there was a breath of fresh air.\n\nI had done one song with Rakhee Sawant in Chura Liya Hai Tumne. So, there was no ice-breaking happening on that end. She was a nutcase back then too, but she was very sweet, and we had a respectful relationship with each other. I used to love pulling her leg too. But at the time, the whole set used to make fun of her, and she used to come to me and complain, âDekho Zayed bhai woh kya bol rahe hain,â and this and that. She had a vernacular way of doing things. While we used to pull her leg, when things would go too far, I used to take her side and calm her down.\n\nHow was Farah Khan as a director?\n\nFarah is a walking-talking movie encyclopedia. She has film in her blood. What you see is what you get from Farah. But when she is on setâthe excitement she creates, the jokes she cracks, and the seriousness that kicks in when it needs toâshe is a whole package. The one thing I love about Farah is that she will treat a spot boy and a big producer the same way. She is like my godmother.\n\nShe got some news that I woke up late in the morning. So, every morning she used to wake me up and say, âChalo bachcha, itâs time for work.â When she had to be motherly, sheâd be motherly, and when she had to be stepmotherly, sheâd be stepmotherly. I still love her the same way.\n\nHow did the title Main Hoon Na come up?\n\nI have no idea about that. I just knew that it was Main Hoon Na, and it was a military kind of font. It sounded so funny and looked so strange at first, with a military font and a school backdrop. A title becomes a title once the film germinates into the hearts and minds of the people. Till then, it looks strange. But we knew the script and what the Main Hoon Na angle was when Shah Rukh saved me, and I saved Shah Rukh. It just beautifully blended together as two brothers who find each other and save the day.\n\nGo on...\n\nI think films like Main Hoon Na need to be made in todayâs times because I feel the heart that Main Hoon Na had, the level of diversity and what it celebrated, how it celebrated love, how it celebrated conquest, and how to be bigger than petty things, the action, drama, humor, and everything. Somehow, I feel that people have lost hearts. Movies are being made and pictures are becoming grand, but the heart is not there the way it used to be. But I feel there would be films like that because people are missing out on them.\n\nFarah Khan recalls 'sobbing' in front of Shah Rukh Khan for over an hour: 'I received a call from the doctor...'\n\nEnd of Article\n\nFOLLOW US ON SOCIAL MEDIA\n\nVisual Stories\n\nExploring the timeless elegance of actress Nikhila Vimal\n\nEntertainment\n\nâIn pics: Mesmerizing looks Sameera Sherief â\n\ntv\n\n10 photos of Kalki Koechlin that made you say woah!\n\nEntertainment\n\nHina Khan's all-black look exudes sassy and bossy vibes\n\nEntertainment\n\n8 low-fat low calorie desi dinner ideas for summer\n\nFood\n\nâ13 self care habits we need to pay attention toâ\n\nLifestyle\n\nNitanshi Goel captivates the internet with her innocence in a blue bandhani saree\n\nEntertainment\n\nGorgeous ethnic looks of new bride Varalaxmi Sarathkumar\n\nLifestyle\n\nStylish clicks of Manasi Parekh you can't miss\n\nEntertainment"
