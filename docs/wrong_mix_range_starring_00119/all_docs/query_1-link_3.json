Soldier) is a 2023 Indian Hindi-language action thriller film co-written and directed by Atlee in his Hindi film debut.[4] It is produced by Gauri Khan and Gaurav Verma under Red Chillies Entertainment. The film stars Shah Rukh Khan in a dual role as father and son who team up to rectify corruption in society. Nayanthara, Vijay Sethupathi, Deepika Padukone, Priyamani and Sanya Malhotra appear in supporting roles.\n\nPrincipal photography commenced in September 2021 with filming taking place in Pune, Mumbai, Hyderabad, Chennai, Rajasthan and Aurangabad. The film's soundtrack and background score were composed by Anirudh Ravichander, with cinematography by G. K. Vishnu and editing by Ruben. A few scenes were simultaneously re-shot for the Tamil version of the film, particularly Khan's appearance in the song \"Zinda Banda\" (\"Vandha Edam\" in Tamil), Sethupathi's portions and scenes featuring Yogi Babu.[5][6]\n\nJawan was initially planned for release on 2 June 2023, but was postponed due to unfinished post-production work.[7] It was theatrically released on 7 September 2023 in standard, IMAX, 4DX and other premium formats, coinciding with Janmashtami. Jawan received positive reviews from critics who praised its cast performances, screenwriting, action sequences and musical score.[8] The film set several box-office records for a Hindi film, overtaking those set by Khan's previous release Pathaan (2023). Grossing over ₹1,148.32 crore (US$140 million), it emerged as the highest-grossing Indian film of 2023, the second-highest-grossing Hindi film and the fifth highest-grossing Indian film.[9] At the 69th Filmfare Awards, the film received 14 nominations, including Best Film and Best Director.[10]\n\nPlot\n\nAzad is the jailer of a women's prison in Mumbai who hijacks a Mumbai Metro train with a group of six inmates: Lakshmi, Eeram, Ishkra, Kalki, Helena and Janhvi, holding the passengers hostage. Upon enquiry, Azad narrates how Kalki's father, a farmer, committed suicide over his failure to pay loans. Azad negotiates with NSG officer Narmada Rai to ask the Agriculture Minister to send ₹40,000 crore in exchange for the hostages' lives. Kalee Gaikwad, a global arms dealer, learns that his daughter Alia is one of the captives and agrees to fund the deal. Azad plans to donate that money toward the loan waiver of 700,000 impoverished farmers in the country. Azad and his gang transfer the funds into the farmers' bank accounts and escape. Through Alia, he reveals his name as Vikram Rathore to Kalee.\n\nNarmada's daughter Suchi, looks for a potential father and husband to her mother and gets impressed by Azad. Upon her daughter's request, Narmada marries Azad, unaware of his true identity. Azad and his gang next kidnap the Health Minister and demand better infrastructure at government hospitals in exchange for the Health Minister's life. He reveals how Eeram, who was a doctor at that hospital, demanded oxygen cylinders for children suffering from Encephalitis, but was denied the supply due to negligence by the health secretary. The infrastructure is immediately upgraded and Azad and his gang escape again. After their wedding, Narmada discovers Azad's true identity, and Kalee's brother Manish captures and tortures the couple. Azad is saved by his doppelgänger, Vikram Rathore. Narmada confronts Azad's accomplices in the jail by disguising herself as an inmate. Here, she learns about Azad and Vikram's connection.\n\nIn 1986, Captain Vikram Rathore was a commando in the Special Ops unit of the Indian Army. He was sent on an operation in which his team faced casualties caused by malfunctioning weaponry. Vikram and his team filed a complaint against a young Kalee, who was then the supplier of the weapons. That same night, Kalee attacked Vikram and his wife, Aishwarya, separating them and shooting Vikram off a plane. Aishwarya was sentenced to prison for killing three cops on Kalee's payroll who were threatening her. Vikram was declared a national traitor; Aishwarya gave birth to their child, Azad, in prison. When Azad turned five, Aishwarya asked him to prove his father's innocence and provide justice to the oppressed, before she was hanged. Unknown to the world, Vikram survived the attack but lost his memory. He was found and rescued by a tribal group in northeast India.\n\nIn the present, Narmada's subordinate Irani is revealed to be on Kalee's payroll. He tries to shoot them all; Lakshmi is killed in the crossfire. Azad kills Irani and steals Kalee's trucks, joined by his father, his team, and his father's friends. The trucks contain money for the upcoming elections that will be used to boost Kalee's political ambitions. Vikram and his team get captured by Kalee's henchmen. Azad releases a video to the public and states that he has stolen voting machines; he demands the sealing of 253 factories in the country responsible for air and water pollution. The factories are sealed by the government. Kalee arrives and a fight ensues wherein Vikram finally recovers his memory. He and Azad fight together and hang Kalee to death. In the post-credits scene, it is shown a few months later, STF officer Madhavan Naik, who helped Azad in the completion of his missions, assigns him a new mission targeting Swiss banks.\n\nCast\n\nProduction\n\nDevelopment\n\nIn October 2019, it was reported that Shah Rukh Khan would collaborate with Tamil film director Atlee for his film after Zero (2018).[12] Harish Shankar, who was present at the promotion event for Bigil, confirmed the collaboration between Atlee and Khan.[13] During COVID-19 lockdown in India, Atlee narrated the story to Khan in 2020, through Zoom call.[14] In May 2021, it was reported that the filming would commence soon.[15] The film is produced by Gauri Khan under Red Chillies Entertainment, while Gaurav Verma serves as a co-producer.[16] The company made a public announcement on 3 June 2022, confirming the project.[17] The film was made on a budget of ₹300 crores.[18]\n\nAtlee co-wrote the film's script along with S. Ramana Girivasan, in his fourth consecutive collaboration with the director.[19] Sumit Arora contributed the dialogues.[20] Atlee further retained most of his norm technicians including cinematographer G. K. Vishnu, editor Ruben, art director T. Muthuraj and stunt director Anal Arasu.[21] Spiro Razatos,[22] Craig Macrae,[23] Yannick Ben,[24] Kecha Khamphakdee[25] and Sunil Rodrigues also were hired as stunt directors.[26][27] Dance choreographers of the film includes Farah Khan, Vaibhavi Merchant, Shobi and Lalitha.[28]\n\nCasting\n\nMukesh Chhabra was the casting director.[29] Khan was reported to play a dual role, as father and son, and would be seen in six different looks.[30] Nayanthara was finalised as the female lead opposite Khan, thus marking her Hindi cinema debut.[31] Priyamani, Sunil Grover, Sanya Malhotra and Yogi Babu later joined the cast. Reuniting with Khan after a decade, Babu last acted opposite Khan in Chennai Express (2013);[32] however, he was only present in the Tamil version.[33] Rana Daggubati was offered the antagonist role but declined citing health issues and thus the role went to Vijay Sethupathi.[34] Deepika Padukone joined the cast in August 2022 in Chennai to shoot her special appearance.[35] In September 2022, Vijay was reported to be making a cameo in the film,[36] but later Atlee denied the news clarifying that he himself was making a cameo.[37] In March 2023, Sanjay Dutt joined the cast to shoot for a cameo during an action scene.[38] Allu Arjun was approached to play a cameo but declined the role citing commitments to Pushpa 2.[39]\n\nFilming\n\nPrincipal photography commenced in September 2021 in Pune.[40] Some scenes of Jawan were filmed at the Sant Tukaram Nagar metro station in Pune from 30 August to 15 September 2021. Filming took place on the Pune Metro. The station also appeared in the film's poster where Khan appears to sit at the metro station.[41] It is the first film to be shot at Pune Metro.[42] Khan resumed the shoot in June 2022 in Hyderabad.[43] Shah Rukh Khan and Nayanthara joined the 10–days shoot.[44] Nayanthara joined the Mumbai schedule on 26 June 2022, after her marriage.[45] Some family sequences were shot during this schedule.[46]\n\nIn August, the next schedule started in Chennai, where Deepika Padukone shot her cameo part.[47][48] Later Vijay Sethupathi joined the shoot. Some action sequences between Khan and Sethupathi were taken in this schedule.[49][50] The song \"Zinda Banda\" was shot during this schedule, in jail.[51] The song, which shot for 5 days included 1000 dancers, and was choreographed by Shobi Paulraj.[52] The song was also reshot for the Tamil version as \"Vandha Edam\".[53] A month-long Chennai schedule was wrapped on 7 October.[54][55]\n\nThe next schedule was held in Rajasthan, in October.[56] Khan and Nayanthara joined this 20–day schedule.[57] Next schedule was held in February 2023,[58] where Khan shot some chase scenes.[18] Sanjay Dutt joined the shoot on 20 March 2023,[59] to shoot an action-packed cameo.[60] In April 2023, a song titled \"Chaleya\" featuring Khan and Nayanthara was shot at Mumbai and Bandra–Worli Sea Link.[61] Later the same month, the song \"Faraatta\" featuring Khan and Deepika Padukone, for her cameo appearance was shot at Film City, Mumbai.[62] Both the songs were choreographed by Farah Khan.[63] In mid July, song titled \"Not Ramaiya Vastavaiya\" featuring Khan and Nayanthara, choreographed by Vaibhavi Merchant was shot at the Yash Raj Studios in Mumbai.[64][65]\n\nPost-production\n\nPost-production for the film began in January 2023 and went on for six months as the film involves extensive computer graphics and visual effects.[66] Editing was handled by Ruben.[67] The VFX work of the film is done by Red Chillies VFX.[68] Harry Hingorani served as the visual effects supervisor with Keitan Yadav as the VFX producer of the film.[69] In April, the company hired visual effects technicians to the team.[70] Ken Metzker of Red Chillies Color did the colouring for the film.[71] Kunal Rajan served as the sound designer.[72]\n\nNayanthara dubbed for her character in early May 2023.[73] Deepa Venkat dubbed for Nayanthara for the Tamil and Telugu versions of the film.[74] Raveena Ravi dubbed for Deepika Padukone for the Tamil and Telugu versions of the film.[75]\n\nThe final copy of the film was ready by early August 2023, and was submitted to the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) that month. On 22 August 2023, the film received a U/A certificate from the Censor Board, with a finalised runtime of 169 minutes.[76]\n\nThemes and influences\n\nAccording to Shah Rukh Khan, the film's theme is about \"women empowerment\".[77] Agnivo Niyogi in The Telegraph argues that Jawan pays homage to several SRK films including Phir Bhi Dil Hai Hindustani, Chak De! India, Swades, Chennai Express,[78] and India Today also discusses how Chak De! India influenced Jawan.[79] The Hindu adds that Jawan references Main Hoon Na, Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi, and Duplicate.[80]\n\nDr. Eeram, who is one of the key characters in the film, is inspired by real-life events and individuals. Dr. Kafeel Khan, who hails from Gorakhpur, Uttar Pradesh, serves as the inspiration for this character. Dr. Khan became widely known for his involvement in the 2017 Gorakhpur hospital deaths. Dr. Khan was arrested and faced legal troubles related to the incident, which brought attention to systemic issues within the healthcare system. In the film, Dr. Eeram's character likely explores themes of medical ethics, responsibility and the challenges faced by healthcare professionals.[81] The film also explores factors contributing to farmers' suicides in India.[82]\n\nA scene featuring Vikram Rathore and Kalee Gaikwad draws inspiration from the Bofors scandal, which was a major political and financial controversy in India related to the purchase of Bofors Howitzer for the Indian army. The scandal revolved around allegations of corruption and kickbacks in the arms deal, which had a significant impact on Indian politics and defence procurement. In the film, this scene sheds light on issues of corruption, political intrigue, and the consequences of unethical decisions made in high-stakes situations. The character Kalee is referred to as AB Bofors, which likely signifies a symbolic representation of the scandal, emphasising the role of individuals and entities in larger scandals and controversies. Kalee's character serves as a metaphorical link to the scandal, exploring the themes of accountability, responsibility, and the impact of corruption in society.[83]\n\nMusic\n\nMain article: Jawan (soundtrack)\n\nThe soundtrack is composed by Anirudh Ravichander, working with Shah Rukh Khan and Atlee for the first time; this would also mark his debut as a solo composer in Bollywood, previously having composed a song for David and the background score for Jersey.[84] Initially, A. R. Rahman was reportedly approached by director Atlee to compose for the film.[85] Rahman subsequently declined the offer for reasons unknown, and Anirudh was chosen to compose for the film.[86] The music rights were bagged by T-Series for ₹36 crore,[87] which was a record price for a Hindi album.[88]\n\nThe soundtrack consists of seven original songs composed by Anirudh, namely, \"Zinda Banda\", \"Chaleya\", \"Not Ramaiya Vastavaiya\", \"Aararaari Raaro\", \"Jawan Title Track\", \"Faraatta\" and \"Chaleya\" (Arabic).
