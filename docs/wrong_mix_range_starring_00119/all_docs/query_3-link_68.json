When actress Priyanka Chopra asks him about the jail, he reverts that he is unhappy with the colour of the uniform. The post in the end calls for an action to boycott the film Pathaan.\n\nClick here to view the link.\n\nFact Check:\n\nFirstly, we viewed the trailer of Pathaan to check the veracity of the viral post but did not find any corresponding scene as claimed by the Facebook user. Pathaan will release in January 2023. The movie features Shahrukh Khan, Deepika Padukone and John Abhram in the lead roles.\n\nhttps://www.imdb.com/title/tt12844910/\n\nSecondly, we searched the internet with relevant keywords for movie scenes with Priyanka Chopra and Shah Rukh Khan and came across a jail scene from the movie Don-2, which is available on YouTube. Further, we found another scene of the film revealing the jail's location in Malaysia, on YouTube.\n\nhttps://m.imdb.com/title/tt1285241/"
