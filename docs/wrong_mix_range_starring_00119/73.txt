Shah Rukh Khan is a global icon and one of the biggest movie stars in history. For all those who think itâs only Danny Boyle who came with an offer from Hollywood, thereâs another film the Jawan star was offered and that too starring Leonardo DiCaprio and helmed by the great Martin Scorsese. However, the film was ultimately canned.

What happened?

Filmmaker Paul Schrader, best known for penning the screenplay of the classic Taxi Driver , spoke about how Shah Rukh Khan wanted to have control over things the project was pitched to Salman Khan as well. The film was reportedly titled Xtreme City and was supposed to be a thriller with one protagonist from the East and the other from the West.

Speaking to Open Magazine in 2013, the filmmaker revealed, â Well, in the end, I donât think Shah Rukh wanted to make it. You know that everything SRK does, he has total control over? So, if he did something like this at an international level, he wouldnât have that control. I think in the end, he wasnât that comfortable not being a hundred percent in control.â

He also revealed they pitched the film to Salman Khan too but that wouldâve meant making the film without the Pathaan star.

In a conversation with News 18, when the filmmaker was asked if given a chance to work with a Bollywood star, who would it be and without even taking a second she replied, âShah Rukh Khan is kind of a legend, isnât he? Itâs kind of a no-brainer in that sense.â

While the movie represents various communities from across the globe, the filmmaker said that she never felt the weight about it. âI inherited an amazing cast in the Khan family and Kamal Khan. And Park Seo Joon was an actor that I just thought was amazing and when this character (Prince Yan) came up, I was like he would be really good for this. I was just excited for the opportunity to put more people in the film from different backgrounds but I didnât feel pressured around it,â said DaCosta.
