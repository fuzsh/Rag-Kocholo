That said, there are some common key factors to consider.\n\nFit: Quite simply, your wetsuit will be useless if it doesn’t fit snugly – loose areas around the joints are an open invitation for flushing.\n\nFlexibility: Wetsuits for open water swimming should have plenty of stretch around the knees, hips and shoulders. If you can’t raise your arm past your ear, then front crawl is a no-go.\n\nThickness: Wetsuits come in varying thicknesses for use in different seasons. This is usually displayed as two numbers separated by a slash or colon.\n\nFor example, 3:2 suits are among the most popular in the UK. The first figure represents the thickness of the torso (in millimetres) and the second, the thickness of the limbs (also in millimetres). The arms and legs tend to be thinner to allow for greater flexibility.\n\nBuoyancy: Thanks to their thick neoprene build, wetsuits will provide a bit of extra buoyancy. But there’s a touch more to it than that. Wetsuits with thick buoyancy panels on the hips and legs are great for beginners, as they will lift your lower body in the water, placing you in a more powerful position for front crawl.\n\nStronger, more experienced swimmers, however, may find their legs are lifted too high by these panels. Triathletes are likely to prefer a neutral buoyancy that will allow the legs to rise and fall in the water more naturally.\n\nWhat thickness wetsuit is best for swimming?\n\nFor swimming in Britain, a 2.5mm torso is best suited to tepid summer waters, 3.5 or 4mm will keep you cosy in spring and autumn, and 5mm will help keep the cold at bay in winter (providing there’s not a dusting of snow on the beach).\n\nBritish Triathlon Federation race rules state that wetsuits must not exceed 5mm in thickness, but don't worry too much about this – most major brands will have taken it into account when manufacturing their wetsuits.\n\nHow we test\n\nOur Runner’s World Lab testers took a range of wetsuits out for a series of swims, submerging themselves in ponds, lakes and the sea in the name of research.\n\nThey then fed back on each wetsuit's performance, letting us know if they kept them warm and proved flexible enough for a race-winning front crawl.\n\nThe best models fitted like a glove and offered plenty of protection from the cold, allowing our testers to stay in the water for longer. They were stretchy enough to let them swim freely, and they didn’t dig in or chafe.\n\nThe winning wetsuits that earned our team's seal of approval are stamped with the Runner's World Expert Tested logo.\n\nThe remaining suits below have been tested and rated by our editors and contributors, all of whom swim in open water regularly and compete in triathlons. Some of these wetsuits are a little more technical – and therefore more expensive – than the wetsuits we tested in the lab, making them better suited to more competitive swimmers and experienced triathletes."
