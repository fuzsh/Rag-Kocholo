        "text": "Vis Entertainment’s attempt to establish a franchise didn't materialise.\n\n3D platformers were once a huge deal in the past. Icons like Spyro and Crash Bandicoot were everywhere. Super Mario 64 revolutionized the genre, and Conker Bad Fur Day proved that platformers could expand their appeal even to adults.\n\nIt was an extraordinary era, marked by a diverse array of exceptional platformers. As the gaming landscape evolved with the advent of the PS2, the genre reached new heights with titles like Jak and Daxter, Sly Cooper, Ratchet & Clank, and numerous other classics. However, amidst the triumphs, there lay a sombre reality. For every Jak & Daxter that soared, there were countless platformers that failed to receive enough spotlight. Some were unlucky enough to debut in a period when the industry’s focus shifted towards blockbuster shooters and expansive open-world adventures, leaving these gems overshadowed.\n\nToday’s occasion calls for an exploration of the obscure history of one of the most unknown 3D platformers of all time: Brave: The Search for Spirit Dancer. A solid action adventure with an interesting story behind it.\n\n(I have spent four years searching for anything about this game. And while I admit I gave up at one point, I’ve given the game another shot, and to my surprise (and soon to yours as well), I have found quite some mind-blowing facts.) Without further ado, this is the obscure history of Brave: The Search For Spirit Dancer, Vis Entertainment’s attempt at making a franchise.\n\nChapter 1: The Beginning\n\nTo fully delve into the history of Brave: The Search for Spirit Dancer, we must rewind the clock to an important moment in Vis Entertainment’s timeline: Earthworm Jim 3D. For Vis Entertainment, formerly known as Vis Interactive, Earthworm Jim 3D marked their foray into tackling a beloved and established IP. However, the path to release the game was fraught with challenges. Development of the game began as early as 1996, yet it endured a drawn-out development cycle, where it was at times believed it would become vaporware, before finally seeing the light of day in 1999.\n\nWhile the ambitious attempt at transforming a popular platformer from 2D to 3D was met with a mixed reception, it’s worth noting that 3D was a tough technology to deal with at the time.\n\nDespite the disappointing reception of Earthworm Jim 3D, Vis Entertainment had other plans. Curious to know more about how Brave came to fruition I contacted one of the producers. After sending an email to Robbie Graham, he told me that shortly after Earthworm Jim 3D was released, the company wasted no time in strategizing for their next platformer. With a better engine, controls, story, physics and all the crux that makes a 3D platformer, fun.\n\n“The basic idea was to do a ‘proper’ 3D adventure game after we released Earthworm Jim 3D (which was our inferior, but whackier version of Mario 64). Better combat, better animation, better engine”\n\n-Robbie Graham, One of the Producers behind Brave\n\nHowever, Brave didn’t happen right away. As it turns out, according to the developers, the game went through a convoluted development cycle that lasted for five years before seeing the light of day in 2005.\n\nThis begs a question, what’s the story behind the full development of Brave: The Search for Spirit Dancer? When did it exactly start? And who came up with the idea first? We explore this in Chapter 2.\n\nChapter 2: Development\n\nTo find the answers to all of these questions, I’ve reached out to the entire team behind the game. And just when I was thinking of giving up, four developers answered, including Robbie Graham, Peter Shea, Brian Gomez and Kirk Ewing.\n\nAccording to Brian Gomez, Brave’s inception was inspired by several artworks & early concept designs created by Vis Entertainment’s lead animator, Mike Jones. Jones had been experimenting with the studio’s in-house engine, envisioning a potential 3rd person action-adventure game.\n\nIntrigued by what Mike Jones managed to brainstorm, Brian Gomez chimed in to provide some of his ideas about the story, concept and overall game design.\n\nMike Jones laid the groundwork that ultimately inspired Brian Gomez to generate a plethora of ideas, culminating in the creation of Brave, a Native American-inspired game fueled by some of his life experiences.\n\n“I’ve been visiting Yosemite National Park in California since I was a child, and I remember hearing legends from the Miwok, Mono, and Paiute people about the origins of Yosemite Valley and its most distinctive feature, Half Dome.\n\nHe continued\n\nThere is a legend about a crying girl (Tissayack) trapped in the rock that always stuck with me. This is where the seed for the game was first planted, and eventually found its way into Brave: The Search for Spirit Dancer.”\n\nStory & Script Writer, Brian Gomez\n\nIn the early stages of its development, originally codenamed Tom-Tom at Vis Entertainment before Peter Shea suggested changing the name midway through production, Brave underwent a prolonged cycle of development that lasted for five years. According to assistant director, Peter Shea, Brave wasn’t originally planned as a linear 3D platformer. As it turns out, it would have played more like the Legend of Zelda.\n\nBrave would enter levels, explore the surroundings, obtain items and so much more. The game was also quite challenging as opposed to the final release. However, since Sony had great success with their platformer line-up on the PS1, they wanted to keep that momentum going on the PS2, hence this initial concept of Brave was ultimately scrapped in favour of a linear 3D platformer targeted at a broader audience, including kids.\n\nOnce the developers scrapped the initial concept around 2002, they immediately shifted their focus to creating a colourful and charming title while staying true to the original theme; a Native American-inspired game that would be accessible and enjoyable for players of all ages.\n\nAccording to Robbie Graham, the game’s engine, planning and overall design took around 18 months to develop, with an additional 18 months dedicated to refining and shaping the game.\n\nHowever, there was another twist. The setting of Brave: The Search for Spirit Dancer isn’t based on any particular real-life location, according to the developers. Instead, it’s based on a fully realized fictional world that bears no resemblance to well-known settings. But, according to Robbie Graham, even before the game’s engine was developed, the developers had other plans in mind.\n\n“Way before the engine had been developed we considered setting the game in a semi-realistic proper scale version of the Isle of Skye set in a pre-historic time with lots of wolves”\n\n-Robbie Graham, One of the Producers behind Brave\n\nThe developers, Robbie Graham, and Peter Shea all stated that the team drew inspiration from various sources such as books related to native American history and folklore, platformers like Crash Bandicoot, Super Mario 64, and Jak and Daxter, with a Turok mention stated by Robbie Graham.\n\n“I suppose Mario 64 floored us in around ’96, and we strived to get close to the elegance of the controls (in a 3D environment). We also wanted to get a lot of Zelda type action in there as well. Jak and Daxter was also an inspiration.\n\nHe continued\n\nGetting an American theme was (I think) a nod to the primary market. There were few titles set in a fantasy North America at the time (Turok comes to mind I suppose).”\n\n-Robbie Graham, One of the Producers behind Brave\n\nBrave: The Search for Spirit Dancer boasted a team of more than 30 developers, with notable names involved. Mike Jones, who later contributed to Red Dead Redemption II, and Peter Shea, who went on to work on Hot Wheels: World’s Best Driver, were among them. Additionally, Robbie Graham, known for his work on Unirally, which sold more than 300k copies before being pulled off the shelves due to a dispute between Pixar and DMA Design, also played a significant role in the project. The writer behind Brave was Brian Gomez who also went to work on several games like Jericho and Silent Hill Downpour.\n\nOther developers who contributed to Brave included Maxwell Can’t, who served as the lead world artist on other games such as BLACK.\n\nThe game took its time to be developed and was ultimately released on September 2, 2005, in Europe and on April 3, 2007 in North America. The game was built using an evolved version of Vis Entertainment’s in-house engine along with the necessary toolsets the team used to develop most of their games. (Like a State of Emergency)\n\nHowever, before delving into what happened during the release, let’s explore the story of Brave, the gameplay, and some details about the cut content of Brave: The Search for Spirit Dancer.\n\nChapter 3: Story, Gameplay, Cut Content\n\nBrave: The Search for Spirit Dancer’s narrative may have been geared toward a younger audience, but players fond of platformers will find the story captivating from beginning to end.\n\nThe game unfolds in a fully realized, vibrant world infused with the essence of native mythology and folklore. Players take on the role of a young Native American boy entrusted with the task of saving his tribe from the clutches of the malevolent Wendigo.\n\nTo achieve this goal, Brave embarks on a courageous journey to locate the legendary spirit dancer, believed to be the only one capable of saving his tribe.\n\nMost of the game sees Brave travelling from one location to another, engaging in combat against enemies, dabbling in the art of fishing, tracking animals, and acquiring essential items to advance the story.\n\nThe gameplay is similar to other specimens in the genre, and Brave: The Search for Spirit Dancer doesn’t shy away from constantly throwing new ideas at the player to keep him engaged. In the beginning, players start with nothing but their trusty stick. As they progress, they get to unlock several tools like the tomahawk, a bow and even supernatural abilities exclusive to Native Americans.\n\nBrave’s gameplay is fun for anyone seeking a solid 3D platformer, with easy controls, and an intriguing story. However, curious to know about any cut content from the game, I asked Robbie Graham about this. He said:\n\n“I think there were probably extra things like trapping and hunting that we never had time to develop”\n\n-Robbie Graham, One of the Producers behind Brave\n\nBrave may not have been commercially able to stand out among titans like Jak and Daxter, but its excellent storytelling and exploration of Native American history imbued with fantasy elements are compelling enough to fully immerse players in the game.\n\nChapter 4: Release, Lack of Marketing, Complications and Unfair Reviews\n\nSony Computer Entertainment of Europe oversaw the development of Brave: The Search for Spirit Dancer and funded the project until completion. They published the game on September 2, 2005, in Europe with plans to publish the game for North America on August 29, 2006. But, due to the company's shift towards other priorities, the game’s release was delayed and Sony ultimately gave up on the project. BAM! Entertainment, however, found this as an opportunity to publish the game.\n\n“Sony Europe was at one time signed up to be the first-party publisher of the title, but due to changing business priorities, they eventually pulled out and the game went to Bam, who acquired VIS entertainment.”\n\nStory & Script Writer, Brian Gomez\n\nBrave: The Search for Spirit Dancer suffered from inadequate marketing and limited magazine exposure In Europe. There were no TV commercials, or any promotional material found in magazines released at that time. Making matters even more intense, Brave was launched during a hellish period that saw the release of blockbuster hitters back then. A few examples like Star Wars: Battlefront II, Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories, Resident Evil 4, and Call of Duty 2 Big Red One come to mind. Releasing a game in such a period without any form of marketing, was not the best approach.\n\nStill, curious to find about any promotional merchandise, I managed to find an advertisement picture from the Poster Hut website.\n\nFrom their website, we can read the following:\n\n“ Originally used to promote the game in the UK, these were never available to the general public.Bear in mind these posters may have been used to promote the game in store”\n\nAfter Sony Computer Entertainment of Europe shifted focus to other business priorities, BAM! Entertainment, the parent company of Vis Entertainment, tried to publish the game in North America in 2006. However, financial difficulties dating back to October 2004 and their subsequent delisting from NASDAQ ultimately led to the company’s demise, taking Vis Entertainment down with it.\n\nSo what happened to Brave after both companies filed for bankruptcy? Was Brave published in North America or ultimately cancelled? The answer is yes, the game was published in North America. Just when all hope was lost, IGN announced in one of their blog posts a list of games to be released in the Spring season of 2007. From that list, you can see Brave was to be published by another company, Evolved Games on April 2, 2007.\n\nWhile Brave: The Search for Spirit Dancer received disappointing coverage in Europe, the situation in North America was worse. It seemed as though the game barely even existed in the USA.\n\nIt didn’t also help that Brave’s reception was rather mixed. Journalists had higher expectations for a game that didn’t promise any.\n\nReview sites like GameSpot criticized the game for its lack of ambition. GameBiz deemed it dated, while GameZone labelled it as a clone. PALGN went as far as calling it nothing but an N64 or Dreamcast copy.\n\nThe abysmal marketing and the disappointing criticism all contributed to the game's low performance both on the commercial and critical side.\n\nThe future appeared bleak for Brave, and just when it seemed destined to fade into obscurity like all its brethren in the genre, plans emerged for something greater: a franchise.\n\nChapter 5: A Sequel, Animated Series and Toys\n\nBefore Vis Entertainment’s downfall, the developers immediately began work on a sequel following the original game’s release. The sequel was envisioned to be far more ambitious than the original, with plans for an open-world exploration, a sophisticated wildlife AI akin to Far Cry, and a full-fledged action-adventure experience. Unfortunately, this promising idea never came to fruition, as Vis Entertainment’s demise, coupled with Sony’s withdrawal of funds from the project, ultimately led to the sequel’s demise.\n\n“Brave 2 was well underway (along with 2 other games) — it was around 25% complete, when Sony pulled the plug. Soon after this (in 2005), VIS entertainment was no more”\n\nRobbie Graham\n\nAfter discovering hints of a sequel’s existence, I scoured the internet in search of anything related to Brave 2, but my efforts were in vain. It wasn’t until I reached out to Evan Hanley, who runs a YouTube channel dedicated to preserving beta trailers and cancelled projects, that he shared an archived link mentioning Brave 2. Sadly, the archived website by artist Mathew Coolin had broken images. Nonetheless, this should serve as strong proof that Brave 2 existed.\n\nThe story didn’t end there. It appears there were ambitious plans for a Brave animated series that never came to fruition either. I discovered this through Brian Gomez’s response to an email, in which he said:\n\n“London production company Tiger Aspect had optioned the rights to the IP and were developing an animated series based on the game, which I was consulting for.\n\nHe continued\n\nThe rights then ended up with Kickstart Productions in Los Angeles and a TV pilot was created, but the series was not picked up.”\n\nAccording to Pete Shea, there were already plans in place to promote the series, including promotions with various toys to be featured at areas like McDonald’s and other places frequented by children. That idea was also cancelled. All plans to make Brave into a series ended in cancellation, and it’s a shame because Brave could have worked well as a TV series with the right team.\n\nChapter 6: The Cancelled DS Game\n\nWhen interest from Sony and other publishers seemed to fade, one publisher proved the opposite.\n\nIn a series of acquisitions and business expansions, SouthPeak Games began acquiring several businesses to broaden its horizons back in 2005. Two years later, the company would start acquiring video game publishers/developers along with the rights to several IPs. Brave happened to be one of them, although it was never publicly disclosed.\n\nIt wasn’t until August 20, 2007, that SouthPeak Games unveiled four of its upcoming handheld and console titles at the GC Developers Conference in Leipzig, Germany.\n\nAs we delve deeper into IGN’s blog post, we stumble upon a mention of Brave coming to four platforms: the Nintendo Wii, Nintendo DS, PSP and the Xbox 360. Other games were also unveiled, all slated for release in 2009.\n\nHowever, this is where things start to become unclear. The DS game was revealed as Brave: Shaman’s Challenge, a spin-off of Brave: The Search for Spirit Dancer. Unlike its 3D counterpart, this game was a puzzle video game that played similarly to Tetris. The player would be tasked with manipulating several blocks on-screen, scoring points, and completing levels, much like in Tetris.\n\nBrave: Shaman’s Challenge was originally planned for a February 17, 2009 release, but it was ultimately cancelled silently. Without any announcement or anything. Whether the original team has worked on this game or not remains obscure. (show IGN release board)\n\nChapter 7: A Bizarre Situation with PSP Release\n\nA peculiar situation unfolded back in 2009. As mentioned in the previous chapter, Brave was scheduled to be released on four platforms: the DS, Wii, PSP, and Xbox 360. While the DS game was quietly cancelled, the other platforms remained unaffected, yet.\n\nAs we read through the article dated July 10, 2008, we learn that several titles from SouthPeak Games were slated to make an appearance during E3 of that year. However, Brave was notably absent from the lineup at the time. The E3 show of SouthPeak has shown all of the games from the blog post, except for Brave.\n\nThings became even murkier when the PSP release suffered the same fate as the DS spin-off game, quietly cancelled without prior notice. What adds to the mystery is the discovery that actual box covers for the PSP release were made, complete with an age rating. (Show Gamefaqs)\n\nThis whole situation begs the question “Was the game ever released?”\n\nDelving deeper into this bizarre situation sends us to a Reddit thread where a user shared the same question “Was Brave: A Warrior’s Tale ever released”\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/PSP/comments/4gx2s8/was_brave_a_warriors_tale_ever_released/\n\nUsers have shared links to various gaming websites like Engadget, which have documented the press release of Brave: A Warrior’s Tale coming to PSP and several other platforms.\n\nNow here is where things become interesting. Several links were shared by several users, mentioning a listing of the PSP game on Amazon. Surprisingly, the game wasn’t only available for sale on Amazon; other retail stores like The Gamesmen and Gex also had it available for purchase at one point in time. Or Maybe not…\n\nNobody knows what the hell happened. While some users insist the game was released in limited quantities, others claim it never saw the light of day. Nobody knows.\n\nChapter 8: A New Hope or A Sign of Inevitable Death?\n\nAfter the DS and PSP’s quiet cancellation, two platforms remained unaffected; The Wii and the Xbox 360. Brave: Warrior’s Tale, according to a SouthPeak Press release, would’ve acted as ‘‘an expanded reinvention of the original PS2 game, Brave: The Search for Spirit Dancer.’’\n\n“The game is set 70 years after the original title. Melanie Mroz, CEO of SouthPeak, explains that the game plays “as a flashback in which Brave describes the events of his life.”\n\nFrom Engadget, July 11, 2008\n\nThe enhanced edition of Brave wasn’t developed by the original team at Vis Entertainment; instead, it was by a lesser-known developer, Collision Studios. While their track record, as documented by several websites, featured games that didn’t perform well commercially, their attempt at reviving an obscure platformer like Brave was certainly bold.\n\nBrave: A Warrior’s Tale would eventually be released in 2009 across North America, Europe and Germany. It was after a series of financial difficulties at SouthPeak Games, and the game being silently omitted from the E3 2008 show and later shown in the following year in the most disappointing way possible, that Brave finally saw the light of day on the Xbox 360 and the Nintendo Wii.\n\nHow did the game perform compared to the original game? Commercially? worse. Critically? Even worse. Brave: A Warrior’s Tale had the misfortune to be released during what everybody would call a nightmare period for 3D platformers. The year 2009 saw the release of high-profile blockbusters like Resident Evil 5, Halo 3 ODST, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare, Batman Arkham Asylum, Uncharted and many others.\n\nRealistically speaking, Brave couldn't succeed in this nightmarish era as players had already moved away from the genre and focused heavily on staying up to date with high-profile shooters boasting an exquisite sense of realism.\n\nIt also didn’t help that Brave: A Warrior’s Tale suffered from the same marketing as its predecessor, with only one Spanish print ad found in the Official Xbox 360 Magazine. Other than that, Brave: A Warrior’s Tale received no further marketing efforts from the publisher.\n\nAll attempts to make Brave a franchise since 2005 have been met with a series of failures. It was clear from this moment that 3D platformers were no longer popular.\n\nChapter 9: Will Brave Ever Make A Return?\n\nFive years after the release of Brave: A Warrior’s Tale, SouthPeak Games vanished from the public eye, taking Brave along with it. Nobody really knows who owns the IP, or if SouthPeak Games sold it somewhere.\n\nAs for whether Brave will ever make a return or not, it remains very uncertain. However, optimistically speaking, for that to happen, Brave needs to have a vocal community advocating for the game, which, sadly, it currently lacks. The game is obscure and has been long forgotten. Adding to the tragedy, Brave: A Warrior’s Tale isn’t backwards compatible with the Xbox One or the Xbox Series X.\n\nThe future of Brave is looking bleak. But in the meantime, all we can do is keep remembering Brave and Vis Entertainment’s attempt at something ambitious: A Native-American-inspired franchise that never came to fruition."
