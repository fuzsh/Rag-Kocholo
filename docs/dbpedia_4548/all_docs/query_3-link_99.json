        "text": "A new law (SB24-079) allowing motorcyclists in Colorado to “lane filter” is now in effect for the next three years. As part of this law, the Colorado Department of Transportation (CDOT) will complete a SAFETY report over the next three years to determine the impact on Colorado roadways. The law automatically repeals on September 1, 2027.\n\n“It’s up to the rider to assess the scene ahead to determine if the conditions are safe and legal to filter – riders should reflect back to their foundational motorcycle licensing course,” said Colorado State Patrol Chief Col. Packard. “Riders will recall learning how important it is to maintain a safety cushion around them, so riding between vehicles places riders in a vulnerable position. Weigh the pros and cons of every scenario before filtering.”\n\nLane Filtering is Legal in Colorado Under These Conditions\n\nTo pass, traffic in the rider’s lane and adjacent lanes going the same direction must be at a complete stop.\n\nThe lane must be wide enough to fit the vehicle and motorcycle while passing.\n\nThe motorcycle must go 15 mph or less.\n\nThe rider must pass safely and control the motorcycle.\n\nThe rider must pass on the left and not enter the oncoming traffic lane.\n\nWhether you are a new motorcycle rider or someone with experience, the best way to enjoy the ride is to continually increase your knowledge and training. The Motorcycle Operator Safety Training (M.O.S.T.) offers three courses for every skill level.\n\n“Motorists also need to respect the legality of this new practice for motorcycle riders even if they don’t always understand their motives or driving experience,” explained Packard. “There are frequent gaps of empathy and tolerance between roadway users regardless of vehicle type. It’s not a hierarchy out there, the roads are meant to be shared and safety is everyone’s responsibility.”"
