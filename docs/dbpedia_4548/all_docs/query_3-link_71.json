The series was produced by VIS, a division of Paramount, in collaboration with Shine Iberia (Banijay Iberia), Elefantec Global, and Legacy Rock. Directed by Miguel Bardem and Fernando Trullols, written by Ángeles González Sinde, Isabel Vázquez and Boris Izaguirre, it features Nacho Faerna as showrunner and stars José Pastor and Iván Sánchez, as Miguel Bosé at different stages of his adult life. BOSÉ also features an internationally recognized cast, which includes actors like Nacho Fresneda, Alicia Borrachero, Valeria Solarino, Ana Torrent, Mariela Garriga, among many others. It was a great challenge and a true pleasure for VIS to develop this series, and I can’t wait for all of you to see it!

The International Emmy®️ Awards are one of the industry's most prestigious awards globally, and I'm grateful to the Academy for the honor of serving as host.

Today is no exception! VIS announced its development deal with renowned Argentine cartoonist, Ricardo Siri Liniers, for the adaptation of his book “Flores Salvajes”, the third installment in a book series where the author pays homage to childhood and imagination. It’s a privilege to work alongside such a talented artist and we are honored to collaborate with him to bring “Flores Salvajes” to life. Thanks, Variety for this incredible coverage, and congratulations to the ViacomCBS International Studios team that made this possible. #studios #vis #liniers #floressalvajes #viacomcbs\n\nOne of the things I enjoy most about my job at ViacomCBS is to work with people who offer a different point of view, allowing us to create the most inclusive, equal, and diverse possible content for our audiences. Today we announced Narrativas Negras (Black Narratives), a writing room of Black writers dedicated to develop representative and inclusive content. The talented team of authors based in Brazil will be led by Marton Olympio and includes Renata Diniz, Eliana Alves Cruz, Estevão Ribeiro, and Lidiane Oliveira. Together they will develop projects in different genres to include series, fiction, and films. In addition, they will serve as diversity and inclusion consultants, providing valuable insights that align with the market's evolving demands. I want to thank Juan \"JC\" Acosta, Fernando Gaston, Ezequiel Groisman, and Tereza Gonzalez for all their hard work and dedication in making this project a reality. #viacomcbs #vis #studios #diversity #inclusion"
