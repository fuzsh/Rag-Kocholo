The company, based in Scotland, has delivered such products as Earthworm Jim 3D and Tom and Jerry: Fists of Fury for Nintendo 64 in the span of two years, and in doing so has demonstrated noteworthy technical prowess.\n\nNow Vis is casting its eyes to the future, and among other next-generation consoles, Nintendo GameCube development. Announced the company: \"With news just out on GameCube, VIS entertainment will aim to capitalize on its existing experience with Nintendo to offer innovative product for the new platform.\"\n\nExactly what titles, if any, Vis Entertainment may be working on for GameCube is not yet known, but it's safe to assume that the developer will continue to work with such publishers as Rockstar Games and NewKidCo in the future. And we wouldn't be surprised to see Jim's triumphant return once more."
