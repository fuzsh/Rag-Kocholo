        "text": "Published Monday 1st October, 2001\n\nSpeech delivered on Thursday September 27th 2001 (a few weeks after the 9/11 terrorist attack in NYC)\n\nIan Ritchie received a standing ovation for his challenging and thought-provoking speech at Scottish Financial Enterprise's Annual Dinner last week. Here is the full text.\n\n​\n\nScotland must rise to the challenge of self-belief\n\nAs we are all very well aware, these are not normal times that we are living through.\n\nI know what I normally look for in an after-dinner speech at an event such as this - I am looking for a short, witty and illuminating address, making me smile, and making me think, before I get on with the real business of the evening networking at the bar.\n\n​\n\nSo I hope you will forgive me if I depart from this norm. It is a bit difficult to be sparklingly witty at the moment. It is tough to dig out and deliver the usual gentle digs about bankers and venture capitalists that I would normally provide to amuse such an audience.\n\n​\n\nFor in the international \"war\" that has been recently declared, we all know who, on our side, is under attack. And it is ourselves, the financial and business community.\n\n​\n\nWe are in the front line. We, as a community, are being targeted.\n\n​\n\nThe very heart of a modern, open, internationally competitive economy.\n\n​\n\nThis is a different kind of enemy - there is nothing we have that they want. They don't want recognition. They don't want our trade. They don't want our culture. They don't want our aspirations: democracy; free choice; high technology.\n\n​\n\nThey don't want our values. They don't want our wealth.\n\n​\n\nThey want to destroy our wealth. They want to destroy us.\n\n​\n\nEven before the events of two weeks ago, I have had good reason to think recently about the basic values that are the most important in life. I had been reassessing my own values, and my lifestyle. Maybe you have been giving thought to the same thing.\n\n​\n\nClearly, the love of your family and of good friends is paramount, most of us would agree, I hope, on that. But should we challenge, perhaps, our business lifestyles? Should we question our relentless pursuit of prosperity?\n\nAs I look around this room, I see a group of people who work far too hard, for too long hours and who often put their personal and family lives second to their work commitments. Should we be reassessing this? Do we have our priorities right?\n\n​\n\nIs the \"pursuit of prosperity\" really that important?\n\n​\n\nWell, I believe it is.\n\n​\n\nLet me get personal for a moment.\n\n​\n\nWhen I was about ten years old, the oil shale industry of West Lothian closed down. The pits were all closed and the men were all made redundant, including my father. The local economy was totally wiped out. My father, then in his forties, never got another decent job again. He was in and out - but mostly out - of employment for the rest of his working life. Things were tough - very tough.\n\n​\n\nMany of us have experienced relative poverty when we are young and just beginning to build ourselves up in the world. But nobody should have to experience what my parents had to face. In their fifties, struggling hard, just to make ends meet.\n\n​\n\nI cannot tell you how grateful I am to live in a country, Scotland, which has such a respect for education, that it picked up and carried kids like me all the way through a world-class education.\n\n​\n\nLater, the West Lothian economy improved, only to be wiped out once more when British Leyland closed its truck factory at Bathgate. Once again, thousands of jobs were lost and the local economy was flattened.\n\n​\n\nToday, the town of Livingston stands at the heart of this area. It is a prosperous, modern, diverse economy of manufacturing, distribution, research and development, and service companies.\n\n​\n\nThere are still challenges, of course, such as when Motorola closed its factory this year, but, in general, there is an underlying strength and diversity in Scotland today that can, so far at least, sustain and recover from such damage.\n\n​\n\nSo let's have no doubt about this - a prosperous economy is undeniably a good thing, and our collective pursuit of wealth creation is an entirely appropriate and worthwhile cause.\n\n​\n\nFor it is in such a prosperous economy that we can provide: the richness of life; the opportunity for comfort; for travel; for personal development; for artistic expression.\n\n​\n\nIt is a prosperous economy that can afford to feed its people well, to educate its young folks wisely, to invest in its own future, and, not the least, to protect those in society that are less able to look after themselves.\n\n​\n\nSo the pursuit of prosperity is, I believe, one of the key priorities of life. And those of us in this room who have the talents to build prosperity, create jobs, grow companies and to strengthen both our own, and the global economy, have a duty to use these talents to the full.\n\n​\n\nMy love for my own children is unconditional. I can, and I will, do everything in my power to protect them from harm, and to enable them to equip themselves as happy, prosperous and productive individuals.\n\n​\n\nWhat I cannot guarantee is that I will always be here - none of us can do that. So I owe it to my children to build a prosperous Scotland for their future.\n\n​\n\nA Scotland in which they can fully achieve their potential.\n\n​\n\nWe all do.\n\n​\n\nSo where are we today in the Scottish economy? As you may know, my particular patch is that of globally ambitious, early stage, Scottish technology businesses. Businesses such as Orbital, Digital Bridges, Voxar, VIS Entertainment and Mindwarp Pavilion.\n\n​\n\nMost of these companies are only a few years old, but between them they employ several hundred Scottish graduates. They are gaining an international reputation. Each of them, leaders in their own field. Creating wealth from here in Scotland, continuing Scotland's tradition in innovation.\n\n​\n\nI have been involved in many start-ups, including OWL, a company which I founded in Edinburgh in 1984. We then grew our sales and marketing from Seattle in 1985 and finally we sold the company to Panasonic in 1989.\n\n​\n\nSo when I am introduced at such events as this one, I usually find myself blushing a little, because I tend to be identified as a successful entrepreneur with a great record of company creation.\n\n​\n\nAnd while it is flattering and pleasant to be described as a huge success, I feel bound to let you into a secret: OWL was not actually a big success.\n\n​\n\nSure, we gave our investors a five times return on their money. Sure, the company continues to employ around 50 high-quality research jobs in Edinburgh as Panasonic's worldwide multimedia research group. But, crucially, we did not remotely reach our potential.\n\n​\n\nOne of the biggest developments, if not the biggest development in computing in recent years, has been the World Wide Web. The web is the system you all use daily to publish and access information over the internet. It is based on a technology known as hypertext - the ability to browse through many sets of interconnected documents with a simple point-and-click interface.\n\n​\n\nNow the world's first company to commercially develop such technology, and market it globally, was my company, OWL, here in Edinburgh, in 1986.\n\n​\n\nBy 1990, when I was approached by Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web version of hypertext, OWL was by far and away the largest company in the world engaged in hypertext browsing technology. As Tim put it in his book, Weaving the Web, OWL had \"already done the difficult bit\".\n\n​\n\nSo why was it that Netscape, Microsoft and other US companies exploited this technology? Why did we Scots not participate meaningfully in the exploitation of this industry that we had pioneered? Why did Jim Clark and Marc Andreesen make the thick end of $1bn when they sold their company to AOL for $4bn?\n\n​\n\nThe reason is not that difficult. For all our Seattle-led market positioning, we were, at heart, a Scottish company. OWL had reached its natural size for a Scottish start-up. It was five years old, had made a bit of an impact on the international stage and was prime for picking off by an international acquisition.\n\n​\n\nTo be fair, our venture capital backers didn't press us to sell. They were supportive to a degree. But it was also perfectly obvious that, having put up all of £600,000 so far, they didn't have an appetite for very much more. And, in portfolio terms, five years is a good time for an exit.\n\n​\n\nIn the late 1980s UK public markets were not open to companies such as us, and no other source of development capital was going to be forthcoming. And, to be perfectly frank, we were also ready to cash in.\n\n​\n\nWe were willing to settle for the bog-standard Scottish result, a few decent points, rather than pulling out all the stops and heading for the World Cup final, which in this case it would have been against Microsoft.\n\n​\n\nSince then, many others have followed our lead: Spider, McQueens, OST, Atlantech, SCL, Intelligent Applications, PeopleDoc, Kymata.\n\n​\n\nSo is it actually possible to build a global high-growth company from a Scottish base?\n\n​\n\nWell, let's take a moment to congratulate our global players, such as the Royal Bank, ScottishPower and Stagecoach - each of which is in the global top ten in their sectors.\n\n​\n\nBut we need to be also concerned with the dynamic of our economy. Where are the giant companies of the next generation?\n\n​\n\nIt's comfortable, and relatively prosperous, here in Scotland. Particularly, in booming Edinburgh there is little unemployment and the property prices are the second highest in Britain.\n\n​\n\nBut underneath there are major weaknesses. Scottish GDP growth consistently trails the UK. The manufacturing and production industries are currently contracting. Only the growth in services and construction are saving us from recession in Scotland.\n\n​\n\nBut what about the high-tech sector, you might ask - what about Silicon Glen?\n\n​\n\nWe have all heard the term Silicon Glen, our answer to Silicon Valley. But Silicon Valley wasn't always Silicon Valley - 40 years ago it was just fruit orchards; Austin, Texas, was a dirt-poor farming area; Seattle was known mainly for its logging and fishing. Each of these areas has transformed its economy with technology innovation and company formation.\n\n​\n\nActually, Silicon Glen is merely one of a couple of dozen other Silicon 'Wannabees' dotted around the world, each claiming to be a key hotspot for new technology development.\n\n​\n\nSilicon Fen in Cambridge, Silicon Bog in Ireland.\n\n​\n\nWhen you look at these various competitive technology locations it is clear that Scotland is not in the premier league, or even the first division of such hotspots. We are, regrettably, stuck in the second division.\n\n​\n\nIt is not obvious why this should be so.\n\n​\n\nWe have an excellent supply of high-quality technology graduates, proportionately higher than our major competitors; we have a modern, stable, open economy; we use the English language, the language of technology business; and we have a strong indigenous financial industry.\n\n​\n\nYes, we are small, but size isn't important, as evidenced by the relative success of countries such as Finland and Taiwan.\n\n​\n\nOf the top ten companies in Scotland, most are the result of privatisations in utilities, transportation and telecommunications, plus two banks and a brewery.\n\n​\n\nIf we look at the Scottish top ten from another angle we can see that, by and large, they are \"industrial revolution\" companies (transportation, power, banks and the brewery). There are relatively few dynamic indigenous \"new economy\" companies emerging in Scotland today.\n\n​\n\nOur technology industry in Scotland has mostly been an imported one. From long-term players such as IBM and NCR to more recent entries such as Motorola and Sun.\n\n​\n\nThis inward investment policy has been a great success. In the '80s Scotland quickly became the prime location in Europe for many Japanese and American businesses and we managed, in a couple of decades, to make the transition from the old industries of coal mining, shipbuilding and steelmaking to the sunrise industries of electronics manufacturing, design, and, recently, call centres and other services.\n\n​\n\nUnfortunately, the days of inward investment are over. There will be very few new major manufacturing plants coming to Scotland from now on.\n\n​\n\nOther low-cost economies, such as in eastern Europe, will win the manufacturing jobs. We can't afford to compete on low pay we just won't win. We have to find new strategic advantages.\n\n​\n\nMeanwhile, we are looking at some demographic timebombs Scotland has an increasingly ageing and shrinking population.\n\n​\n\nWe have a mighty challenge ahead of us - how to maintain a prosperous and dynamic economy with an ageing and shrinking population.\n\n​\n\nSo where are Scotland's strengths? Although we have around 9% of the UK's population, we educate about 14% of the UK's young people and we competitively obtain around 14% of the UK's funding for scientific research.\n\n​\n\nUnfortunately, we then lose half of the result with only around 7% of the UK's qualified young people staying in Scotland.\n\n​\n\nExporting talent is good - we should be sending our bright youngsters out into the world. But the balance of payments in this equation is poor. We don't get many coming back in the other direction.\n\n​\n\nOne area where we in Scotland are undoubtedly in the premier league is in innovative scientific research.\n\n​\n\nMeasured by peer-reviewed and cited published research papers, Scotland is one of the top three economies in the world - ahead of England, ahead even of California.\n\n​\n\nIn areas such as information technology, optoelectronics and bioengineering, we have a research capability second to none.\n\n​\n\nI remember being in the US, at a conference in San Jose, when the story broke about Dolly the Sheep. This was a source of puzzlement and amusement from the attendees in Silicon Valley. How could it be that the single most significant scientific development of the decade, the cloning of an adult mammal had been achieved in a \"quaint\" little place like Scotland, better known for its golf courses and pipe bands.\n\n​\n\nAt first I found this insulting, but on reflection I was forced to come to terms with the inevitable truth that Scotland is simply not perceived as a centre for innovation and scientific research.\n\n​\n\nOf course we all know about Scottish innovation. We can reel off the examples. James Clerk Maxwell, Alexander Graham Bell, James Watt, John Logie Baird. People who created the modern world by their discoveries and inventions.\n\n​\n\nIn answer to the old question \"How many Scotsmen does it take to change a light bulb?\" the answer is of course two: one to change the bulb, and the other to remind you not only that a Scotsman invented incandescent lamps, but that the name of a Scotsman, Watt, is printed on every one manufactured.\n\n​\n\nOf course what we are less forthcoming about is that of these names: Clerk Maxwell, Graham Bell, Watt, Logie Baird - every one of them had to leave Scotland to achieve their goals.\n\n​\n\nFor hundreds of years the Scots with get up and go have got up and gone. We are a place where people come from, rather than come to. We have supplied bright, innovative, \"can-do\" talent to the rest of the world.\n\n​\n\nThe fact that all current leaders of the UK's political parties in Westminster - all three of them - were born and educated in Scotland doesn't particularly surprise us. It is normal to hear leaders of industry, finance and medicine around the world speaking with Scottish accents or sporting Scots names.\n\n​\n\nSo here in Scotland we have the innovative ability to achieve scientific breakthroughs, as measured by research funding and publications. We have bright and ambitious internationally minded young people, and, here in Scotland, largely represented in this room, we have something in excess of £300bn of investment funds under management.\n\n​\n\nSo we have brains, energy and money, and despite all that we have one of the most sluggish economies in western Europe - what is wrong with us?\n\n​\n\nWell, the main thing is a collective lack of confidence in our own abilities. Too few businesses in Scotland are globally ambitious. Too few are willing to pull in the internationally qualified management teams to ensure they can scale up and compete effectively on an international stage. And too few sources of investment here in Scotland, believe in Scotland enough, to invest in our own future.\n\n​\n\nIt's almost as if large technology companies, like mighty giant redwoods, can only prosper in the Californian climate.\n\n​\n\nWe are trying to fix it - initiatives such as the Schools Enterprise Programme, which many of you here have supported, will try to create an enterprise culture in our schools. The Scottish Institute for Enterprise is doing the same for our leading science and technology universities. But culture takes a long time to change.\n\n​\n\nHere is a question: does Scotland have a fundamental problem with risk investment? I'm sure that the culture of every organisation, even that of a nation, is a product of their history.\n\n​\n\nAlmost exactly 300 years ago, in the late 17th century, Scotland invested heavily in a strategic trading development in the Gulf of Darien - the first attempt to create a powerful new east-west trade route at Panama.\n\n​\n\nThis fell foul of competitive pressure by the East India Company and the pledged support was withdrawn at the last moment by the Dutch and the English governments. The project then failed catastrophically with a loss of over 2,000 Scots lives and only one of the 16 Scottish ships managed to return home.\n\n​\n\nPractically the entire circulating capital of Scotland was dragged into trying to rescue this failed project and the Scottish nation ended up so impoverished that it was forced into the Act of Union in 1707.\n\n​\n\nAt the Act of Union, the Scots, with a fifth of the British population, had a mere fortieth of the wealth.\n\n​\n\nNearly all European countries have been invaded and conquered, and have lost their independence, at some time in their history. However, Scotland ended up losing its independence, not by being conquered (even Edward I failed to achieve that) but through a failed investment project.\n\n​\n\nA century afterwards, the Americans built the Panama Canal, pretty much to the plans drawn up by the Scots, and it turned out to be a huge commercial success. The Scots had had the right idea, but were ahead of their time and didn't have the ability to execute.\n\n​\n\nEarlier I mentioned Dolly the Sheep, and it was Scottish. Only last week, PPL Therapeutics, the company behind this work, managed to finally pull together fresh funding after a punishing and nailbiting few months, not the least of which was the current international situation.\n\n​\n\nAnd how much of that funding came from the Scottish financial sector? I'll leave it to you to come to your own conclusion!\n\n​\n\nSo we don't have to make up examples of our collective lack of confidence - our legacy from the Darien project.\n\nHere we have it, not ten miles from where we sit right now, the single most important scientific breakthrough, anywhere in the world, of the past decade. So significant that presidents and prime ministers were asked to give their opinions on its significance. Debates were held in Congress, new laws were passed.\n\n​\n\nYes, it is still very high risk; the outcome is not certain; the world economy is in turmoil; other companies will probably execute better; possibly PPL will fail; best not to get involved. How very Scottish.\n\n​\n\nNo, let's not accept that attitude.\n\n​\n\nWe can do it, we must do it.\n\n​\n\nWe must have the confidence to create new knowledge and then, crucially, have the determination to win the business that results and not let the exploitation go elsewhere, enriching others.\n\n​\n\nAmong our responsibilities, I believe, is that we all have a duty to spend our time and efforts on the future prosperity of our world.\n\n​\n\nThese are unusual and tragic times. The world changed two weeks ago and we are still uncovering the consequences.\n\n​\n\nTony Blair read some words last Friday at the memorial service in New York words written by the American author Thornton Wilder:\n\n​\n\n\"But soon, we will die, and we ourselves shall be loved for a while and forgotten.\n\n\"But the love will have been enough, all those impulses of love return to the love that made them. Even memory is not necessary for love.\n\n\"There is a land of the living and a land of the dead and the bridge is love. The only survival and the only meaning.\"\n\n​\n\nWe have the ability, and I believe the duty, each of us in this room, to express the love we have for our children, and our nation, by ensuring that we fight for a strong, dynamic and prosperous economy, here in Scotland, here in Europe, and around the world.\n\n​\n\nAn economy that will survive and prosper. An economy in which our people can reach their full potential, in which future generations of Scots can take on the world and win.\n\n​\n\nWe can do it; we must do it.\n\n​"
