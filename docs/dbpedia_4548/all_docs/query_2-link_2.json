        "text": "Last month, we announced that the MVIS / Bartco UK group has been recertified with our ISO accreditations in quality (9001:2015), environmental management (14001:2015), and health & safety (45001:2018).\n\nThis week, General Manager of the ITS group, Anne Ashman officially collected the new certificates at a celebration event marking our achievement, along with Dom Bridge, Assistant Operations Manager at MVIS who was also instrumental in helping the company obtain these accreditations. Presented by Christopher Moores, the Operations Director at NQA, Anne and Dom proudly received the certificates at the event, giving the MVIS and Bartco UK team the recognition we deserve for this accomplishment.\n\nThese accreditations signify a wider commitment from MVIS and Bartco UK to corporate social responsibility, demonstrating landmark achievements for us in the areas of industry and workplace safety, environmental responsibility and quality, making us the ideal choice as an ITS supplier for key schemes undertaken on highspeed roads and highways throughout the UK.\n\nRepresentative of our commitment to these highly important aspects of our business, the ISO accreditations together furnish us with a full IMS (integrated management system), integrating our systems and processes into one complete framework.\n\nAnne Ashman, Group General Manager, commented, “Collecting these certificates marks a huge achievement for the whole team at MVIS and Bartco UK. Understanding the importance of being re-certified in all 3 standards was a value shared by all our staff, who have seen the impact it can have on the company, our growth and our future. Over the 3 years since we obtained our first ISO certification, we have continuously improved our systems, providing higher service levels than ever before. Our team continue to offer customers quality service, safety compliance and environmentally responsible business practices. Both Dom and I were very proud to represent everyone at MVIS and Bartco UK when collecting this highly important and coveted achievement.”\n\nIf you would like to know more about our ISO accreditations – MVIS and Bartco UK recertify ISO accreditations\n\nFor more information about MVIS, please call us on 01629 580 570 to speak to one of our friendly team.\n\nAs a fantastic way to start our 2020 community outreach activities, MVIS took part in an interesting annual initiative run by Highfields School in Matlock. Being local to us, we were more than happy to assist with such a forward-thinking project, which no doubt helps shape the children of Matlock into employable and successful young adults at the incredibly important time of Year 11.\n\nThe initiative was to deliver mock job interviews for the children. Highfields School looked to businesses and organisations from around the area to send professionals to conduct the interviews, giving the Year 11s a chance to take part in an interview-styled experience that they could benefit from. As well as interviewing the children, business representatives were encouraged to offer advice on good interview technique to pupils as opportunities presented, providing them with a very real opportunity to grow and learn from the experience.\n\nDespite interviewing a few children each, the professional participants were given plenty of time to interview properly, ensuring that the Year 11s had the best possible opportunity to learn. A representative from the school told us, “I was speaking with a group of girls who took part and they said that it really helped them, as they all had college interviews next week. A few said they were nervous but once they had got through the interview, they came out relieved and smiling. Two students told me it even made them think about their life to-date and they found the interview very helpful.”\n\nMVIS, and sister company Bartco UK, highly values our good relationship with Highfields School. Being a business local to Matlock, we had enough of a stake in the development of Matlock’s youth to make this worth doing; as an employer who has taken on many apprentices from Highfields School in the past, there is a fair chance that in future we may end up even recruiting some of the children who took part in this. Indeed, members of our team themselves took part in the same initiative as Highfield School pupils only a few years ago.\n\nWe thank Highfields School for the opportunity to be part of this exercise and we look forward to taking part again next year.\n\nFor more information about our corporate social responsibility strategy or if you would like MVIS to be a part of your community project, please contact sean.brown@m-vis.co.uk or you can call us on 01629 580 570.\n\nMVIS and Bartco UK are proud to announce the recertification of our ISO accreditations in quality (9001:2015), environmental management (14001:2015), and health & safety (45001:2018).\n\nIssued and audited by global certification body NQA, ISO accreditations enforce the practise of and adherence to well-known and respected business standards that help organisations perform better in a wide range of aspects. For MVIS and Bartco UK, the standards of quality (9001:2015), environmental management (14001:2015) and health & safety (45001:2018) are of critical importance to our business, making recognition of these facets in our business operations a highly aspirational goal for us and furnishing us with a full IMS (integrated management system), integrating our systems and processes into one complete framework.\n\nOur quality certification (9001:2015), assures clients that our products and services meet industry requirements. As a very important factor when it comes to equipment such as ours that promotes safety, clients look to MVIS and Bartco UK for reliable and effective products that not only tick all the boxes in their offering, but also have the ISO accreditation in quality behind them.\n\nAs an ITS solutions group, we work closely with the Highways and Traffic Management industries to deliver our solutions and products across the whole of the UK. Having such close ties to these industries, our environmental impact is of great importance to our Corporate Social Responsibility strategy.. By working with a company that has obtained this accreditation, clients can rest assured that the company their required ITS solution came from is improving their sustainability through increasingly efficient use of resources and reduction of waste.\n\nThe health & safety accreditation, (45001:2018), completes our IMS in an area that doesn’t just demonstrate our commitment to our customers, but also to our staff. With its focus on employee safety and the safety of working environments, this standard is perhaps one of our most important, helping us conform to safety standards that keep our staff safe. Due to the nature of work undertaken by many of our team across highways, vehicle management, crowd safety and construction, the safety of our staff and others is paramount in transporting and deploying our units. Staff, customers and even pedestrians can all be safe in the knowledge that our products have been manufactured and deployed with safety in mind.\n\nHaving already earned these ISO accreditations over the past few years, MVIS and Bartco UK are subject to audits by NQA that sees us reviewed on these aspects annually and fully reviewed every 3 years to ensure that we are in keeping with standards as time goes on. It is with immense pride that both MVIS and Bartco UK can say they have had their ISO accreditations renewed, demonstrating our commitment to procedure, safety and compliance yet again.\n\nAnne Ashman, Group General Manager, commented, “This is a “pat on the back” for everyone who works at MVIS & Bartco UK. The whole team understand the importance of re-certification of all 3 standards and the impact it has on both company’s future and continual growth. Since first gaining ISO certification 3 years ago the companies have continually improved systems and aimed even higher on service levels to ensure our customers get a quality service from MVIS and Bartco UK”.\n\nFor more information about MVIS, please call us on 01629 580 570 to speak to one of our friendly team.\n\nOn 25th January 2020, MVIS Ltd received some very sad news from Matlock Town Football Club, where MVIS Ltd sponsor the home and away shirts. Midfielder, Jordan Sinnott, had died after a tragic incident on a night out in Retford. Tributes have been led by Matlock Town FC and his former club Alfreton FC.\n\nMatlock Town FC commented on the tragedy, “We are very sorry to report that Jordan Sinnott has passed away just before 7pm this evening. His family and friends were with him at his bedside and we send our sincere condolences to them all at this very sad time. We understand from the Police that following a serious assault in Retford town centre yesterday evening Jordan was found unconscious with a suspected fractured skull. He was taken to hospital where he was treated for the injuries and put on a life support machine.”\n\nJordan was a talented player and a rising star, scoring a hat trick in Matlock Town’s recent game against Basford United. But more importantly, he was a son, a friend, a teammate and an idol, who leaves many loved ones behind to mourn his loss.\n\nGames at the weekend and midweek were cancelled by Matlock Town FC as a mark of respect to Jordon, with a minute’s silence to be held at other local games.\n\nAnne Ashman, General Manager commented, “Our hearts go out to his family, friends and supporters in what can only be described as a tragic and senseless loss of life and talent, we continue to support the club thorough these tragic times, where he is mourned by fans”.\n\nIT’S BEEN ANOTHER BIG YEAR…\n\nAs we embark on another year, MVIS and Bartco UK have been reflecting on the highlights of 2019 in what has once again been a busy and productive year, with major developments in our operations, products, service, vehicles and staff, along with advancements in health and safety, including mental health.\n\nLast summer, we launched not only two new intelligent transport system (ITS) solutions, but also an entirely new ITS category, designed to enable traffic management companies to better protect the safety of road users and construction workers alike.\n\nThe Works Egress Safety Solution is the first temporary ITS solution to combine modular electronic perimeters and variable message signs (VMS) to promote the safety of construction personnel and road users around the exit points of roadside work zones, via dynamic text.\n\nThe Overhead Service Unit protects construction workers by warning them of overhead structures – including those where work is underway – and is the first to feature in-built radar as opposed to separate sensors, which can accidentally reposition after installation.\n\nBoth solutions are already currently in use on a major UK smart motorway scheme and are performing exceptionally well.\n\nStrategically located to serve the North of England and Scotland, our new Newcastle depot increased our storage capacity and stock level, enabling us to respond with increased agility to customer demand, whether it is for deployment, servicing or repair of ITS solutions.\n\nAlready ISO registered in quality and environmental management, in 2019 we also added health and safety to that list. What’s more is that we also achieved another accreditation to our name, with Achilles Building Confidence. The construction industry accreditation and risk-management scheme helps companies like MVIS to streamline the procurement process, enabling them to cost-effectively manage risk on behalf of their customers.\n\nHealth and safety lies at the heart of MVIS, and 2019 has been a year of great progress in this area. Training, workshops and briefings have enabled us to remain a “zero incident” company, in line with Highways Englands’ Aim for Zero road worker safety campaign. In order to continually improve our safety protocols and practices, our general manager, Anne Ashman, embarked in September on a course with the National Examination Board in Occupational Safety and Health.\n\nOur new ‘Safe Mind, Work Safe, Work Well’ strategy saw us further extend our health and safety policy to embrace mental health, amongst other things to help address the high male suicide rate in the construction sector. MVIS has two mental health first aiders and encourages staff to approach them if they are experiencing a poor state of mind. In keeping with our commitment to mental health, on World Mental Health Day, the team donated money and wore hi-vis clothing in support of the Young Minds charity.\n\nTowards the end of the year, we made a big structural change to the MVIS and Bartco UK marketing operations that brought on a new marketing manager, Sean Brown to the team. Bringing with him 6 years of digital marketing infrastructure experience, he is responsible for overseeing the company’s move away from marketing agency management. MVIS have also restructured internally with the promotion of Tillie Wolliscroft from Operations / Customer Service Assistant to Marketing Assistant. Charged with building the company’s internal marketing infrastructure, this new department represents a major change for both MVIS and Bartco UK, allowing us to be more responsive and experimental in our approach to marketing and ultimately, the image we put out to our customers and partners.\n\nAlong with the changes to the marketing department, MVIS and Bartco UK have also seen other changes in staff, representing growth as the group expands and requires additional team members to keep up with demand.\n\nBeing welcomed to Bartco UK earlier in the year was Pip Wood as Purchasing Apprentice, working under the guidance of newly promoted Rebecca Prince, who has been promoted to the role of Purchasing & Stock Control Supervisor this year.\n\nA little later in the year saw the appointment of Jacob Spencer to the Bartco UK workshop team as a 1st year technical apprentice. Closely following Jacob came Liam Griffiths as Workshop Technician. Both are working under the guidance of Tim Hill, who has also been promoted within Bartco UK to Workshop supervisor. Also working hard in the workshop at Bartco UK has been George Sheldon and Cain Gregory, both advancing their work related qualifications and development. Cain reached notable milestones in his apprenticeship as well as achieving his forklift operators licence whilst George finished his apprenticeship this year.\n\nFinally, Bartco UK saw the side step of Tom Hooton from Workshop Supervisor to Technical Development Supervisor, working alongside Research & Development Manager Matt Felce, assisting him in the development of new products that are in high demand from customers as well as keeping Bartco UK’s product offering innovative and cutting edge to new or prospective customers.\n\nMVIS have also seen a number of new staff members join their team, including Mizzy Watson, to resume Tillie’s role in Operations and Customer Service. Mizzy joins us with a strong background in customer service having previously run the national repairs desk for a major automotive glazing company.\n\nSuch changes to the group’s team have come with enormous benefits that enrich and develop our growing companies, bringing with them skills, experience and perspective from other industries, shaking up the internal dynamics ready for the next stage in the group’s development.\n\nHeading into the new year, both MVIS and Bartco UK have big announcements to make that will truly demonstrate our commitment to Corporate Social Responsibility, in terms of the environment, the community, our staff and the industries we operate in.\n\nSo, like we said, it’s been another big year, and we’re already looking forward to the next one, as we strive to further improve our customer offerings and protect the physical and mental well-being of the hard-working people in this exciting industry. We also have a number of new products in development ready for this year, moving us forward technologically and keeping us innovative. If you would like to find out more, please call us on 01629 580 570.\n\nNovember has brought a few busy weeks for MVIS, with not one, but two successive trade shows in as many weeks. The final industry trade shows of the year kicked off with Highways UK 2019 at the Birmingham NEC on the 6th – 7th November which was then followed by Traffex Scotland 2019 at the SECC in Glasgow on the 13th – 14th November, both keeping the MVIS team on their feet, ready and waiting to network with those interested in what we can offer.\n\nHighways UK was very well attended, from exhibitors to visitors and all those in between, there was scarcely a moment that the MVIS stand was empty of attentive visitors. With many new and old faces in attendance, Highways UK provided an invaluable opportunity to raise the profile of the MVIS product range to a highly interested and concentrated audience. The other exhibitors all put on their finest display, with some very impressive and entertaining stands and exhibits on show to represent the very best of the industry.\n\nThe following week brought Traffex Scotland, offering its true value to us in the form of the amazing geographical networking opportunity. Since the opening of our new depot in the North East, Scotland is a location that MVIS can cater to easily, paving the way for a whole new route of conversation for us at this show.\n\nThe guest speakers in attendance were exceptional, bringing the very best of innovation in the industry from across the UK to this one location in a celebration of industry excellence, success and hard work. As with Highways, we saw many familiar faces along with new faces who were interested in seeing what the MVIS team and product range had to offer.\n\nAt both shows, our HD Compact VMS was one of the products that came out on top. With many visitors and exhibitors alike interested in this innovative and pioneering creation, we were delighted to be able to demonstrate its brilliance in such high profile and important environments.\n\nBoth events were a big success for us, bringing different strengths to the table that offered fantastic opportunities. For more information about future shows we will be attending, please contact marketing@m-vis.co.uk, or for more information about our products, please contact sales@m-vis.co.uk.\n\nCome and find us on Stand E46!\n\nOn November 13th and 14th, Traffex Scotland welcomes MVIS Ltd as we take our place at Scotland’s major highways exhibition.\n\nTraffex Scotland and Bridges Scotland are Scotland’s only dedicated events for the roads and bridges sectors under one roof, providing a platform to see and learn how new technology is driving change on the network.\n\nThe event provides the platform for debate and discussion around the areas of:\n\nImproving road maintenance and delivery\n\nTraffic management and Mobility as a Service\n\nFuture proofing the Scottish network\n\nITS-how is ITS technology driving change on the network\n\nTransport schemes, planning and delivery\n\nDelivering safer roads\n\nIdentifying and promoting innovation\n\nVisitors to the expo are invited to pick up a brochure and head over to stand E46 to discuss MVIS’ capabilities.\n\nJuly 2019 saw MVIS unveil a new depot in the North East of England which facilities the build and storage of more units for our hire fleet. This location and increase in fleet size services contracts across the north of England, as well as Scotland, and also provides a more regional hub for further growth in these areas.\n\nAt the event, we will be looking forward to discussing our product’s capabilities and what they can bring to the Scottish market.\n\nOur Sales Manager based at the Newcastle Depot, Graeme Lee commented:\n\n“We’re looking forward to heading north of the border to Traffex Scotland and seeing both our existing clients and some potentially new ones too.\n\n“With our new depot just below the border, we’re set up to support contracts in Scotland better than ever before in terms of both geographical locations, as well as the number of units in our fleet.\n\n“We’ve had 40 Solar IP units added very recently in addition to almost 70 VMS of various sizes, to our ever increasing fleet of 500+ units. This will continue to grow, and the fleet will continue to expand to support the demand for our products on the network.\n\n“We look forward to being able to discuss more in detail at Traffex Scotland.”\n\nFor more information about Traffex, please visit their website.\n\nIf you’d like more information about any of our products or services, contact the team on 01629 580 570 or email sales@m-vis.co.uk\n\nCome and find us on Stand F60!\n\n6th / 7th November, NEC Birmingham\n\nMVIS will be returning to Highways UK this year when the showcase event returns to the NEC Birmingham in November.\n\nHighways UK is now in its 5th year, with 4 of those shows being held at the NEC. The event has rapidly become a ‘go-to’ for the sector, with over 3,500 attendees in 2018 passing through the doors.\n\nOver two days on November 6th and 7th, MVIS will be found on stand F60 exhibiting numerous products from our diverse range of ITS equipment and solutions.\n\nSince our last appearance at the exhibition in 2018, there have been some major changes to the company. One significant addition is in the form of a new depot located in the North East to support contracts across the north of England, as well as Scotland, as the company continues to thrive and grow.\n\nMVIS General Manager Anne Ashman comments:\n\n“We’re looking forward to inviting people to stand F60 over the course of the 2-day show. It’ll be fantastic as ever to see our clients, and we look forward to making some new connections too.\n\n“As we continue to increase our capability, regional presence and fleet size there’s plenty to talk about, so we look forward to seeing everyone at the show!”\n\nIf you’d like to find out more about the exhibitors and sessions available at Highways UK, or to book your place, take a look at the website: https://www.highways-uk.com/huk/whats-on\n\nFirst published on HighwaysIndustry.com\n\nIn the meantime, if you’d like more information about any of our products or services, contact the team on 01629 580 570 or email sales@m-vis.co.uk\n\nMVIS take a big step towards growth in their latest appointment of a new internal marketing team, they take over from the excellent job marketing agency Fig have done for several years.\n\nAfter years of agency marketing management, MVIS are bringing their marketing in-house under their new marketing team. MVIS welcome newly appointed Marketing Manager, Sean Brown to the team in this confident move of growth.\n\nThe appointment reflects a marketing strategy more in-line with the growing needs of MVIS, being such a fast-paced and ambitious environment.\n\nIndeed, Anne Ashman, General Manager at MVIS comments:\n\n“Fig have been fantastic in the years we have been with them and they have done a really great job. The only downside is that they aren’t on-site with us and we have to share them! Taking on an internal marketing department allows us to be more reactive and experimental in our efforts, which is highly important in this fast-paced industry.”\n\nBy bringing a marketing team in-house as a company directive, they are working alongside the heart and soul of the business, allowing the new team to understand the company’s needs almost as second nature without it taking as much time and coordination as it would to bring a third party up to this level of understanding.\n\nThe team themselves are just as keen to get going, comprising of Sean Brown as Marketing Manager and Tillie Wooliscroft as Marketing Assistant. Sean, who’s new to the company, has a background in both B2B and B2C marketing, working with a diverse range of products during his career that include household brands to cutting edge display AV technology. Whilst he is new to the highways industry, he brings with him a solid marketing foundation that will help to diversify the company’s current marketing infrastructure, allowing them to perform to the highest level in this sector possible.\n\nSean notes:\n\n“Working within a market where contracts play such a pivotal role is a brilliant opportunity for me as it’s not something I’ve done before. The pressure to constantly bring in new business has always been a huge part of my job. It’s clear that MVIS know what they’re doing; in the time they’ve been trading, they’ve achieved an awful lot and built this industry leading business. But there’s still so much to explore on the marketing front, which is what makes this such an exciting time for me as things can only get better from here.”\n\nHe brings with him years of marketing experience, fittingly specialising in digital marketing infrastructure.\n\nHe adds:\n\n“In a nutshell, my career to date has largely encompassed helping businesses transition from traditional marketing practises to this new field of digital marketing. Having an intimate knowledge of what digital systems are best to achieve different goals is what I do well, so building an internal infrastructure of my own to manage seems like a perfect application of my skills at this stage.”\n\nHis experience equips him perfectly for the task before him, expanding on the work Fig have done as well as exploring and building new marketing avenues for the company that will see them through the next stages of growth that they ambitiously look forward to.\n\nSean is joined by MVIS veteran, Tillie, who previously worked in the Operations team and has been moved to marketing to grow her social media marketing skills further.\n\nAnne explains:\n\n“Tillie has been with us for a number of years now and during this time, she has taken on new responsibilities that do fall under the marketing remit, such as social media management. Without an in-house marketing department, Tillie’s role was kept in Operations due to her incredible ability to build relationships with customers. But since we made the decision to expand in this way, she can easily apply these skills here so it was a logical choice to move her.”\n\nThe part Tillie plays as Marketing Assistant is welcomed by Sean too, who has experience in teaching, education and IT / marketing related CPD.\n\nHe recalls:\n\n“When I found out Tillie had been awarded Learning Unlimited Intermediate Apprentice of the Year Award in 2018 for her work at MVIS, I realised I was going to be training a hard worker. Tillie is a bright and enthusiastic individual and I very much look forward to working with her and teaching her everything I know.”\n\nMVIS welcomes both Sean and Tillie to the marketing team, eagerly awaiting what’s to come in future.

Sharing knowledge, standards and best practice leads to buyers and suppliers sharing success.\n\nMVIS – Yet another mark of quality\n\nFor MVIS, Achilles registration cements their commitment to both quality and safety. The company has 20% of its entire team IOSH trained to ensure ALL departments have top quality H&S standards in place and upheld. 75% of staff are first aid trained, and 90% of staff have health and safety CSCS.\n\nImpressively, the company has been awarded ISO 45001:2018 for safer systems of working, measurability and continual improvement, in addition to holding ISO 14001:2015 for environmental standards and ISO 9001:2015 for quality.\n\nGeneral Manager of MVIS Anne Ashman told us:\n\n“We have done this audit process and registered as it shows customers and potential customers even further that we work in a Quality, H&S and Environmental manner. It is our further alignment as a SME with large contractors within the industry.\n\n“We’re really proud to achieve registration with Achilles, and add it to our other accreditations to cement the fact we practice what we preach when it comes to standards, service and quality.”\n\nMVIS sees tangible growth in 2019 as their North East depot opens its doors for the first time.\n\nJune has seen Newcastle house the new depot and enable MVIS a number of benefits moving forward.\n\nFirstly, the company will be able to house and hold more products with the second depot’s ability to store constructed VMS units. Therefore, more VMS units will be built for the hire fleet and more beavertails are ordered to aid delivery, and the environment as multiple units can be transported on each driven journey.\n\nStrategically located, the depot location will enable MVIS to service these clients across the north of England, as well as Scotland with greater efficiency in regard to deployment, servicing and repair.\n\nJuly 19th will see the doors opened, and MVIS will be inviting visitors, suppliers and clients to an open day to tour the facility and see the capability added with this expansion.\n\nAnne Ashman, MVIS General Manager spoke to us about the depot and the need to expand:\n\n“Every business is looking to grow- that’s a bit of an obvious statement – but for us to need to expand to carry on servicing the clients we have to the level they have become accustomed to is great.\n\n“Both MVIS are growing, and as more people discover what we can deliver for them and the level of service we deliver it with, the demand for our products and service goes up.\n\n“With this expansion, we are reacting to that demand and showcasing that we will ensure the delivery of the same high-quality service we’re known for- by investing in the expansion for the benefit of our clients.\n\n“It means we can put down roots in more areas of the UK and operate from more than one strategic location when it comes to servicing clients. The Newcastle depot is in the perfect spot to service the north of England, as well as Scotland- a growing market for us.\n\n“Additionally, we’re continuing to raise awareness internally with staff about environmental issues, as well as continue to expand upon their product knowledge as we introduce new units.”\n\nExciting times for MVIS and Bartco UK, which could beg the question…where next?!"
