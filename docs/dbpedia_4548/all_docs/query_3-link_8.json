        "text": "Introduction\n\nThe United States has always been a top destination for artists and entertainers from around the world. From amateurs to professionals, to the world famous, they are all eager to show off their star skills to the most discerning of world-wide audiences- Americans. Acting as ambassadors of their nations and representatives of their craft, foreign artists and entertainers come to the US to facilitate exchange of ideas and traditions, and in the process, enrich both societies.\n\nThe United States has always welcomed entertainers and artists from every genre and has welcomed and appreciated talented performers from diverse cultures, showering them with accolades, recognition and rewards.\n\nWhile the types of visas available to Artists and Entertainers, may seem somewhat limited, each nonimmigrant US artist visa option and entertainer visa option has its own applicability, advantages and limitations. It is therefore important that artists and entertainers, as well as their employers and/or agents, understand and be clear about the various options they may have, and what purpose each classification has, so that any problems or issues that may arise with the immigration laws in the US can be avoided.\n\nWe present here a snapshot of the most frequently used US visas for Artists and Entertainers.\n\nThe O1 Visa For Artists And Entertainers\n\nThe O1 visa classification is generally available to those who possess “extraordinary ability” in the arts, science, business, education, athletics, or those in the motion pictures or television industries who are who are coming to the United States to perform for a temporary period.\n\nFor most artists and entertainers, extraordinary ability means “distinction” or a high level of achievement evidenced by a degree of skill and recognition substantially above what is ordinarily encountered. For those in the motion picture or television industry, extraordinary ability means having a record of extraordinary achievement evidenced by a degree of skill and recognition significantly above that ordinarily encountered to the extent the person is recognized as outstanding, notable or leading in the motion picture and/or television field.\n\nOnly individual artists and entertainers qualify for the USA O-1 visa category, meaning that a group of entertainers or a band for example, will not qualify on a single application. However, individuals who will accompany an O-1 artist or entertainer to assist in a specific event or performance, and whose assistance is ‘essential’ to the completion of the artist’s or entertainer’s performance may seek an O-2 visa. The O-2 beneficiary must have critical skills and experience with the O1 artist or entertainer that cannot be readily performed by a US worker, and which are essential to the successful performance of the O1 artist or entertainer. Therefore, the leader of a band can qualify for the O-1 visa and the rest of the bandmates may be able to come on the O-2 visa.\n\nTo obtain O-1 visa classification, the US employer of the artist or the entertainer, a US agent, representing either the employer, the artist or both, or a person or entity authorized by the employer as its agent, must file a petition with the United States Citizenship and Immigration Service (USCIS) with the accompanying documents evidencing extraordinary ability in the field.\n\nA written advisory opinion from a peer group or labor organization or a person designated by such a group with expertise in the artists or entertainer’s field of ability must also accompany every O-1 petition. If the O-1 petition is for an artist in the motion picture or television industry, then the consultation must come from the labor union and a management organization.\n\nNOTE: A consultation may be waived for an artist or entertainer if he or she seeks readmission to perform similar services within 2 years of the date of a previous consultation. Such artists and entertainers should submit a waiver request and a copy of the previous consultation with the petition. Also, if the artist or entertainer can demonstrate that an appropriate peer group does not exist, the decision will be based on the evidence of record.\n\nEach O-1 petition must also include a copy of a contract between the employer or agent and the artist or a summary of the terms of an oral contract. Contracts with third-party clients may also be required in certain cases. Some petitions will also require the submission of an itinerary with an explanation of the nature of the events or activities the artist or entertainer will be engaging in along with beginning and end dates for the events or activities.\n\nOnce the visa petition is approved by the USCIS, individual artists and entertainers who are applying from outside the US must apply for the O1 visa at an appropriate US embassy or consulate.\n\nAdmission and Dependents\n\nO-1 Artists and Entertainers may be admitted to the United States for a period of 3 years initially (the term will depend on the terms of the contract and/or itinerary). Extensions of stay may also be granted for the time necessary to accomplish the initial event or activity in increments of up to 1 year. The Spouse and children under the age of 21 of the O-1 artist or entertainer, as well as any O-2 support personnel, may be eligible to apply for an O-3 nonimmigrant visa. Dependents with O-3 visas may not work in the US but may engage in full or parttime study.\n\nFor more information about the O-1 Visa.\n\nDID YOU KNOW\n\nFor the O1 Visa:\n\nSuitable for Internationally renowned artists and entertainers, who possess “extraordinary ability”. Advantages\n\nAdmission for a period of up to 3 years initially.\n\nSupports dual intent.\n\nSpouse and children can qualify for the O-3 dependent visa.\n\nLimitations\n\nThe qualification criteria signify a very high standard.\n\nPrior approval of a nonimmigrant petition by USCIS is necessary.\n\nThe P1 Visa For Entertainment Groups\n\nThe P1 visa classification is available to artists and entertainers coming to the United States temporarily to perform as a member of an entertainment group that has been recognized internationally as outstanding for a sustained and substantial period of time. However, as opposed to the O1 visa classification which is available to individual artists and entertainers, the P1 visa classification is intended for those performing as part of a group.\n\nAlong with artists and entertainers, essential support personnel, who are an integral part of the performance of P1 artists or entertainers, and who perform support services which cannot be readily performed by a US worker are also eligible for P-1 classification.\n\nFor the entertainment group and its members to qualify for the P-1 visa, at least 75 percent of the members of the group must have had a substantial and sustained relationship with the group for at least one year. Also, the entertainment group must be internationally recognized, meaning, it must have a high level of achievement evidenced by a degree of skill and recognition substantially above what is ordinarily encountered. The reputation of the group, not the individual achievements of its members, must be internationally recognized.\n\nNOTE:\n\nCircus performers and essential circus support personnel are exempt from the one year “group” requirement and the internationally recognized requirement. They must, however, be coming to join a nationally recognized circus.\n\nIn consideration of special circumstances, certain nationally known entertainment groups may have the internationally recognized requirement waived if they can establish that they have been recognized nationally as outstanding for a sustained amount of time.\n\nTo obtain a US P1 artist visa or P1 entertainer visa, the US employer of the entertainment group or its US agent must file a P1 petition with the USCIS, along with a consultation from an appropriate labor organization regarding the nature of the performance, or a statement proving that the group has been established and performing regularly for a period of at least one year.\n\nNOTE: If no appropriate labor organization exists, this requirement is excused.\n\nThe petition must also include a contract between the employer/agent and the entertainment group/individuals and an itinerary of the events.\n\nOnce the visa petition is approved by the USCIS, members of the group may apply for the P1 visa at an appropriate US embassy or consulate.\n\nAdmission\n\nP-1 entertainment groups may be admitted to the United States for the time needed to complete the event, competition or performance, not to exceed 1 year, initially. Extensions of stay may also be granted in increments of up to 1 year in order to continue or complete the event, competition or performance.\n\nGet more information on the P-1 Visa for Entertainment Groups.\n\nDID YOU KNOW\n\nFor the P1 Visa:\n\nSuitable for Internationally recognized entertainment groups and its members Advantages\n\nAdmission for a period of up to 1 year initially.\n\nQualification criteria not as high as O-1.\n\nSpouse and children can qualify for P-4 dependent visa.\n\nLimitations\n\nThe qualification criteria signify a very high standard.\n\nPrior approval of a nonimmigrant petition by USCIS is necessary.\n\nThe P2 Visa For Artists And Entertainers Participating An A Reciprocal Exchange Program\n\nThe P-2 visa classification is available to artists and entertainers coming temporarily to the United States to perform, either individually or as part of a group, under a reciprocal exchange program between an organization in the United States and an organization in another country. Essential support personnel who are an integral part of the performance of a P-2 artist or entertainer, and who perform support services that cannot be readily performed by a US worker are also eligible for P-2 classification.\n\nIn order to qualify for a P-2 artist visa, the artist or entertainer must be entering the United States through a government recognized reciprocal exchange program. In addition, he or she must possess skills comparable to those of the US artists and entertainers taking part in the program outside the United States.\n\nTo obtain the P-2 visa for artists and entertainers, the sponsoring organization in the United States, or the US employer, must file a P-2 petition with the USCIS, along with a written consultation from an appropriate labor organization. Evidence that the organization in the US was involved in negotiating, or has concurred with the reciprocal exchange of US and foreign artists and entertainers must be submitted. The petition should also include the itinerary of events (if more than one event).\n\nOnce the visa petition is approved by the USCIS, artists and entertainers may apply for the P-2 USA artists visa at an appropriate US embassy or consulate.\n\nAdmission\n\nOn a P2 visa, artists and entertainers may be admitted to the United States for the time needed to complete the event, competition or performance, not to exceed 1 year, initially. Extensions of stay may also be granted in increments of up to 1 year in order to continue or complete the event, competition or performance.\n\nGet more information on the P-2 Visa for Artists and Entertainers.\n\nDID YOU KNOW\n\nFor the P2 Visa:\n\nSuitable for Artists and Entertainers, coming individually or as part of a group, to perform under a reciprocal exchange program.

Essential support personnel who are an integral part of the performance of a P-3 artist or entertainer and who perform support services that cannot be readily performed by a US worker are also eligible for P-3 classification.\n\nTo qualify for the P3 visa the artists or entertainers must be coming to the United States for the purpose of developing, interpreting, representing, coaching, or teaching a unique or traditional ethnic, folk, cultural, musical, theatrical, or artistic performance or presentation. In addition, he or she must be coming to the United States to participate in a cultural event or events, which will further the understanding or development of his or her art form.\n\nTo obtain a P3 visa, the US employer or the sponsoring organization must file a P-3 petition with the USCIS, along with a written consultation from an appropriate labor organization, and either, affidavits, testimonials or letters from recognized experts attesting to the authenticity of the individual’s or group’s skills in performing, presenting, coaching or teaching the unique and traditional art forms; or documentation that establishes that the individual’s or group’s performance is culturally unique, as evidenced by reviews in newspapers, journals or other published materials. Also, if the events or performances will take place in multiple areas, an itinerary, listing the dates and locations of the events, must be submitted.\n\nOnce the visa petition is approved by the USCIS, artists and entertainers may apply for the P-3 visa at an appropriate US embassy or consulate.\n\nAdmission\n\nP-3 Visa Artists and Entertainers may be admitted to the United States for the time needed to complete the event, activity or performance, not to exceed 1 year, initially. Extensions of stay may also be granted in increments of up to 1 year in order to continue or complete the event, activity or performance.\n\nGet more information on the P-3 Visa.\n\nDID YOU KNOW\n\nFor the P3 Visa:\n\nSuitable for Artists and Entertainers, coming individually or as part of a group, under a program that is culturally unique.

Dependents with P-4 visas may not work in the US but may engage in full or part-time study.\n\nThe B1 Visa For Artists And Entertainers\n\nIn certain limited situations, the B1 Business Visitor visa may serve as an appropriate US visa for artists and entertainers to come to the US temporarily. The main advantage of the B-1 visa is that, unlike the O and P visas, no prior approval of a petition from USCIS is required, which means lesser processing time and costs for the applicants. This also means there need not be a US employer or agent.\n\nHowever, the B-1 visa is generally not appropriate for professional artists and entertainers who seek to enter the US to temporarily perform services except in a limited and narrow range of circumstances. These include:\n\nWhere a professional entertainer is coming to the US to participate only in a cultural program sponsored by the sending country, where he or she will be performing before a nonpaying audience, and all of his or her expenses will be paid by the sending government.\n\nWhere a professional entertainer is coming to the US to participate in a competition for which there is no remuneration other than a prize (monetary or otherwise) and expenses.\n\nWhere a musician is coming to the US in order to utilize recording facilities for recording purposes only, and the recording will be distributed and sold only outside the United States, and no public performances will be given.\n\nWhere an artist is coming to the United States to paint, sculpt, etc., and who is not under contract with a US employer, and who does not intend to regularly sell such art-work in the United States.\n\nNOTE: As a general rule, artists and entertainers on a B-1 visa may not receive a salary from a US source for his or her activities in the United States. A US source, however, may provide him or her with an expense allowance or reimbursement for expenses incidental to the temporary stay, which may not exceed the actual reasonable expenses he or she will incur in traveling to and from the event, together with living expenses he or she reasonably can be expected to incur.\n\nAdmission and Dependents\n\nOn a B-1 visa, artists and entertainers are generally admitted for a period of not more than six months. Extensions of stay may be granted in increments of not more than six months each. However, as a practical matter, B-1 artists and entertainers may be admitted only for the period necessary for them to perform in the US. Also, unlike the O and P visas, the spouse and children of B-1 artists and entertainers are not eligible to seek a “dependent” visa. Instead, they would have to individually qualify for their own B-2 visitor visa.\n\nGet more information on the B-1 visa.\n\nVisa Waiver Program\n\nArtists and Entertainers who are citizens of countries that are designated under the Visa Waiver Program may come to the U.S. as a Business Visitor under the program. Visa Waiver entrants are subject to the same restrictions as B-1/B-2 Visa holders. However, entries are limited to no more than 90 days and VWP entrants cannot apply to extend their stay.\n\nDID YOU KNOW\n\nFor the B1 Visa:\n\nSuitable for Professional artists and entertainers coming to participate in certain cultural programs and competitions, in limited circumstances. Advantages Prior approval of petition by USCIS is not needed. Limitations\n\nAvailable to artists and entertainers in limited circumstances.\n\nCannot receive any salary from a US source for activities in the US.\n\nNo separate dependent visa category for spouse and children.\n\nB2 Tourist Visa For Amateur Artists And Entertainers\n\nAmateur artists and entertainers, or entertainment groups, who will not be paid for performances and will perform in a social and/or charitable context or as a competitor in a talent show or contest, may be eligible to seek a B-2 visa, even if the incidental expenses associated with the visit are reimbursed. A B-2 Tourist visa, like the B-1 Business visa, is a visitor visa and does not require prior approval of a petition by USCIS before filing the visa application.\n\nNOTE:\n\nAn amateur is someone who normally performs without remuneration (other than an allotment for expenses).\n\nA performer who is normally compensated for performing cannot qualify for a B-2 visa even if the performer does not make a living at performing, or agrees to perform in the United States without compensation.\n\nAdmission and Dependents\n\nOn a B-2 visa, amateur artists and entertainers are generally admitted for a period of not more than six months. Extensions of stay may be granted in increments of not more than six months each. However, as a practical matter, B-2 amateur artists and entertainers may be admitted only for the period necessary for them to perform in the US. Also, unlike the O and P visas, the spouse and children of B-2 artists and entertainers are not eligible to seek a “dependent” visa. Instead, they would have to individually qualify for their own B-2 visitor visa.\n\nVisa Waiver Program\n\nArtists and Entertainers who are citizens of countries that are designated under the Visa Waiver Program may come to the U.S. as a B-2 Visitor under the program. Visa Waiver entrants are subject to the same restrictions as B-1/B-2 Visa holders. However, entries are limited to no more than 90 days and VWP entrants cannot apply to extend their stay.\n\nConclusion\n\nArtists and entertainers who want to come to the US to perform or exhibit their talents in the US have a range of US visa options to choose from. The key is to choose the best option that matches the artist’s or entertainer’s talents and purpose of trip.\n\nThis article is only intended to provide an introduction to the various US visa options for artists and entertainers who want to temporarily come to the US, but it is not exhaustive. Before taking any concrete steps, it is essential that, artists and entertainers, as well as their employers and/or agents, understand the various options before deciding on which one is most suitable for them and their particular situation.\n\nWe suggest that you talk to an experienced immigration attorney and plan a clear immigration strategy, to avoid any immigration related issues or problems, or even, unnecessary delays."
