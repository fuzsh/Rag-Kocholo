The goal of the Energy Lab is to empower kids to take ownership over their education and share their knowledge with others. We also want to use the benefits of technology to get kids excited about energy and to show them that this is an industry in which they can have a voice. Vis Viva is the second of four teams who will work on the project and will add the second installment to this space. This term our team will be focusing on fossil fuels. Through an interactive installation, our project will help students explore and answer questions like: What are fossil fuels? How do we find them? And how do we extract them?\n\nProject Instructors: Scott Stevens Jess Trybus\n\nLisa Elkin, Hyungwan Byun, Rose Heid, Qing Mao, Adarsh Telekadan Puthiyaveettil, Yu-Cheng “Larry” Chang, Maoyang Li"
