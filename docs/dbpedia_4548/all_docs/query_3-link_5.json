Last week 200 brave Partners & Distributors accepted the task to join the adventure to seek for Terra Oltre: The land beyond, and with their knowledge and energy make it rise again.

The guests got to uncover 7 different districts with: THE CLOCK TOWER: Legacy, Productivity, Future DISTRIBUTION SQUARE: Network, Channel First THE WORKSHOP: Programs, Tools MARKETING FOREST: Storytelling, AI, Data GARDEN OF GOOD: ESG story STORAGE CHAMBER: Datacenter, Backup TECHNOLOGY DISTRICT: Client Devices, AI, DnCP all paired with a Dell Technologies story and a team of wise custodians. Besides this the group got to listen to inspirational keynotes by David JP Phillips David Spruyt Julie Rosendal and insightful breakouts and group days. Rest of the time in Terra Oltre was spent on training & wellness, street art sessions, culinary classes, networking, 1:1 future talks in a Delorean, local farmers market and relaxation. CONGRATULATIONS TO: Henri L√∂fberg TD SYNNEX who walked home with $10 000 for a marketing campaign after pitching for the dragons in TERRA OLTRE DEN. All this with carefully carved out with a visually stimulated animation & music spanning from Opera to EDM to open all senses and make people connect. Terra Oltre is almost impossible to describe in pictures and words, but we truly hope that all guests felt how magic this experience was. BIG THANK YOU TO OUR BRILLIANT TEAM!
