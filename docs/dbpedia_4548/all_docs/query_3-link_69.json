        "text": "HOW DID IT ALL START?\n\nTWENTY 4 SEVEN Feat. MC Fixx-It\n\nIn the beginning he started out with rapper MC Fixx-it. The single was called 'I Can’t Stand It'. This was a hip-hop track (100 BPM). The chorus was made by Ruud himself with a vocoder. Because it was just a little hit in the Dutch Tip-Parade Ruud decided to make the track more commercial. He started working out a Hip-House version (124 BPM) which was totally different from the original. This time he changed the chorus vocoder and used a female vocal. This was the first time Nance was introduced in the group. This record went Top 20 in The Netherlands.\n\nTWENTY 4 SEVEN Feat. Captain Hollywood\n\nAfter a few months there was interest by a record company in Germany. They loved the record but asked Ruud to re-record the record in Germany and use a different rapper. Ruud decided to do that. He started out with rapper Captain Hollywood and vocalist Nance joined by 2 dancers Jacks and Hanks. This re-recorded single became a smash hit all over Europe, claiming the number 1 spot in various countries. This led to worldwide success. The second single 'Are You Dreaming?' from the debut album 'Street Moves' appeared to be a good follow up in view of the chart positions it gained. ‘Are You Dreaming?’ made it into the Top 20 in The UK, Germany and The Netherlands. And in Denmark, Finland, Switzerland and Italy it even became a Top 10 hit!\n\nAfter finishing the album 'Street Moves' Captain Hollywood decided to start his own career. Captain Hollywood eventually left the group. His place was filled by Stay-C in 1992. Until 1995 he and Nance formed Twenty 4 Seven.\n\nTWENTY 4 SEVEN Feat. Stay-C and Nance\n\nTheir first single together was called 'It Could Have Been You', but unfortunately for them this single didn't have the impact they hoped it would have! Twenty 4 Seven went back into the studios and recorded the single 'Slave To The Music'. This single became an enormous success, claiming the number 1 spot in Australia, Czech Republic, most Latin-American countries and South Africa, hitting Top 5 in The Netherlands, Germany, Belgium, Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Portugal and Top 10 in Finland, Singapore, the Philippines and Thailand. The next singles ('Is It Love', 'Take Me Away', 'Leave Them Alone', 'Oh Baby!') and album, also entitled 'Slave To The Music', were just as successful and helped Twenty 4 Seven to become a worldwide top-act. In several countries all over the world Twenty 4 Seven received Golden and Platinum Awards for both singles and albums.\n\nIn the same year in which Twenty 4 Seven proudly received the Dutch Export Award of 1994, the third album, 'I Wanna Show You', was released in December. At times when the first single from this album, 'Oh Baby!', made it high in the charts in a big part of Europe. The second single 'Keep On Trying' saw its release in March 1995. In spring 1996 they received a Golden Award for the album 'I Wanna Show You' (South Africa) and double Platinum for the album 'Slave To The Music' (also in South Africa).\n\nANOTHER CHANGE"
