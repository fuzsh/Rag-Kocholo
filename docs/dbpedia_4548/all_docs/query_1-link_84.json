        "text": "It was an “army” of women that made the Timex tick.\n\nAt its height the company employed about 6,000 people in Dundee and 80% were women, who mainly worked on the assembly line putting together mechanical wristwatches.\n\nTimex took on a highly-skilled female workforce as the once-dominant jute industry lost out to man-made fibres.\n\nJute, an industry that defined Dundee for years, was at the bottom end of the textile league, used for things like ropes, sacks and carpet-backing.\n\nBozdog calls it “playfulness”, a rebellious resistance to the boredom and regimentation of the work.\n\n“That's why Timex was amazing,” Bozdog says.\n\n“I can visualise thousands of women, all in their uniforms, walking up Timex Brae every morning and hearing their heels and the chatter.”\n\nBut by the early 1990s there were only a few hundred workers left at Timex.\n\nWatch-making had stopped a decade earlier and at the time of the final dispute the workers were relying on making printed circuit boards for IBM computers.\n\nBut a drop in demand led to the bosses planning to lay-off 130 staff just before Christmas in 1992.\n\nThe workers came out on strike.\n\nThe strikers were mainly women but thousands of activists and supporters turned up from all over the UK to fight their cause.\n\nSo it was that Timex's Harrison Road factory became the scene of some of the most bitter picket-line protests since the miners' strike a decade earlier.\n\nThe dispute was played out in front of the TV cameras and attracted attention from around the world.\n\nThe women walked out in January but they were planning to go back when they found themselves locked out of the factory.\n\nThey were told they needed to accept a wage cut, reduced union representation and an end to a range of benefits.\n\nWhen they refused, all 343 striking workers were sacked.\n\nThe dispute got even uglier when Timex began to bus in replacement workers.\n\nFor the next six months there were angry scenes outside the factory as protesters clashed with police.\n\nMPs and others accused militant activists of 'rent-a-mob' tactics as supporters were bussed in to join the picket.\n\nThe dispute ended suddenly in August 1993 when the management announced the immediate final closure of the factory.\n\nIt brought to an end 47 years of Timex in Dundee.\n\nThe highly-skilled workforce had shrunk throughout the 1970s as tastes in watches changed and in the early 1980s it diversified.\n\nThis ushered in a brief era when Timex played a major role in bringing the home computer to the mass market in the UK.\n\nIt inspired a generation of youngsters, especially in Dundee, and laid the foundation for a new industry in the city - computer games.\n\n“In fact they probably had multiples,” he says.\n\nThe price of a new Spectrum 16K was about £125 (the equivalent of about £450 today).\n\nBut in Dundee, slightly damaged models were changing hands for much less.\n\n“I joke about them going out of the back door for a tenner and a packet of Embassy Regal,” van der Kuyl says.\n\n“They weren't nicking them I'm sure. It was ones that were going to get trashed.”\n\nVan der Kuyl was at school during the Spectrum years but went on to form games company Vis Entertainment and more recently 4J Studios, which has achieved huge success developing Minecraft for consoles and handheld platforms.\n\nHe says the Spectrum was an important moment for the city but its success was shortlived.\n\nHowever, it did have a legacy.\n\nAt the same time as the old hardware industry was coming to an end, former Timex worker Dave Jones and his DMA Design were showing the way to the future.\n\nThe Dundee line of the subway map begins in 1982 with the Spectrum.\n\nThe next stop is video game Menace, written by Dave Jones, the grandfather of Dundee gaming.\n\nHe was the man behind Lemmings, the first mega-successful computer game to come out of the city.\n\nIt was released in 1991 and became so legendary in Dundee that it has its own statue.\n\nVan der Kuyl says Lemmings “just exploded\" for Dave Jones and his DMA Design.\n\nHe says: “They were still quite a cottage industry but suddenly, with Lemmings, they opened a headquarters on the technology park and started hiring people like crazy.\n\n“Dave was driving around town in a Ferrari.”\n\nLater, Jones would go on to develop one of the most successful games ever, Grand Theft Auto.\n\nBut his career began as one of those whizz kids with a Spectrum, who also happened to work at Timex.\n\n“Dave Jones was one of the young technicians brought in as a debug technician for the ZX Spectrum,” says Charlie Malone.\n\nMalone was a technician at Timex in the 1980s and is now a lecturer at Abertay University.\n\nHe says: “Dave very quickly established himself as being different. He was a geeky guy.\n\n“He was way ahead of anyone else in terms of his potential and he went to college and then went on to become one of the greatest games developers of that era.”\n\nFor Jones, and for many others, it was only later that they could see a link between Timex and the games industry.\n\nJones and van der Kuyl desperately needed graduates with the new skills to work in the rapidly changing computer games market.\n\nIn 1997, their lobbying led to Dundee's Abertay University becoming the first in the world to offer degrees in computer gaming.\n\nDespite only having had university status for three years, Abertay was soon attracting students with entrance qualifications that would have got them in to Cambridge.\n\n“Kids were coming out of school and saying 'this is amazing and it's the only place in the world you can do it',” says van der Kuyl.\n\nIt hosts a broad range of games firms from tiny start-ups to major players such as Outplay and van der Kuyl's 4J Studios.\n\n“There's so much you can draw on and everyone is really willing to speak to you,” Madden says.\n\n“You can learn an awful lot.”\n\nMadden's company does “work-for-hire”, such as designing training applications, but their big shot is a game called Big Crown: Showdown, which they have been developing for two years.\n\nIt is a “vast, frantic, online, multiplayer game” for eight to 12-year-olds, he says.\n\nFor Madden, the opening of the V&A can only help sustain the “real buzz” there is about the city and its regeneration.\n\n“I hope there is a lot more recognition of what Dundee has to offer in terms of talent and the things it can create,” he says.\n\n“It's putting it on the map in terms of people thinking we are making cool stuff up here.”\n\nThe restored Oak Room is given new heart-breaking prominence after Glasgow School of Art, Mackintosh's finest creation, was destroyed by fire in June.\n\nWhile the art school is seen by experts as his finest achievement, many of the public view his tearooms as the place that defined the Mackintosh style.\n\nThe Oak Room was designed in 1907, when Mackintosh was at the height of his career and planning the final stages of his art school project.\n\nIt is the largest interior designed for Miss Cranston's Ingram Street tearoom.\n\nBut fashions changed and it was not used as a tearoom after the 1950s.\n\nIn 1971, the building was knocked down to make way for a hotel but the Oak Room was saved.\n\nEach section was recorded and referenced before it was put in storage.\n\nPlans and elevations of the rooms were drawn to show how everything fitted together.\n\nHowever, it still took a major restoration effort to get it fit for display in the V&A.\n\nInside Spex Pistols, an independent store dedicated to all things eyewear, there is a mirror connected to a cloud-based facial recognition service.\n\nIt guesses your age and tries to play songs from when you were 14.\n\nThe mirror was developed with Dundee University and has been exhibited in the V&A in London.\n\nThe shop's owner, Richard Cook, says Dundee has always been a destination of interest for design-minded people.\n\nHe says: “There has always been a strong artistic culture woven through the fabric of Dundee.”\n\nRichard thinks the arrival of the V&A is definitely positive for the city.\n\n“There are hundreds of people who will say that they will be left out or that it’s not for them.\n\n“But most people will at least be able to experience the renaissance feeling in Dundee.”\n\nHe says he's already seeing a big rise in tourists coming into his shop.\n\n“It’s a beautiful city, in a lovely part of the world, but until now, we’ve been a world class secret.”\n\nDundee - cool, fashionable and a hot tourist destination?\n\n“Is this some bizarre joke?” Dundonian writer, academic and stand-up comedian AL Kennedy told the BBC radio documentary Designing Dundee.\n\nAs someone who grew up in Dundee in the 1960s and 70s she finds it hard to believe people around the world are taking notice of the city.\n\nShe says Dundee is “historically beset by ugliness and brutalism”.\n\n“And the things we see every day tell us whether we matter, whether we are loved, have power,” she says.\n\nKennedy says the arts can act “like rocket fuel” and be the key to all kinds of freedom for marginalised people."
