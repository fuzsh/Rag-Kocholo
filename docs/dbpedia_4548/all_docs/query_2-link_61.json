        "text": "Image Description Beta Location\n\nInside on one of the guard booths (the one that is near the spawn location of Leviathan and Raindance) in the Easter Bay Airport, there is a computer running a map editor, possibly showing a beta location from the game. Catalina's Past\n\nNear Catalina's cabin, there are three graves and a shovel, suggesting she may have murdered and buried past lovers prior to meeting Carl Johnson. Gant Bridge Facts\n\nIn the visitor center below Katie Zhan's House, there is a list of facts about the Gant Bridge, one of which reads \"It takes up a staggering 1.27mb!\"\n\nIn the Definitive Edition, the sign is updated to reflect the size of the new version of the bridge, reading that it \"takes up a staggering 38.9mb of disk space.\" Ghost Graffiti\n\nIn the Vinewood Cemetery, there is graffiti that only appears between 8:00 pm to 6:00 am. It reads \"Families 4 Life\", another reads \"Ballas\" and a third reads \"OGF\". Hidden Sign\n\nOn top of the Gant Bridge, there is a sign that reads \"There are no easter eggs up here. Go away.\" Mass Grave\n\nNear Area 69, there is a hole that is filled with six body bags. Scott Wilson's Grave\n\nIn the Palomino Creek graveyard, there is a grave which reads \"R.I.P Scott Wilson\". Image Description Caligula's Palace Model\n\nOn the top floor of the Las Venturas City Planning Department, a model of Caligula's Palace can be found with a Rockstar logo on it. Clothing\n\nSome of the clothing that the player wears, as well the suitcase at the start of the game that CJ holds while in the airport, and more items have the Rockstar Games logo on them. Parachute\n\nThe parachute has a small Rockstar North logo on the back. San Fierro Tower\n\nIf viewing the San Fierro Tower at night from the south, the player can see the Rockstar Games logo being shown as the lighting of the building. Stars\n\nAt night, if the player looks up in the sky there are stars that form the letter R in reference to the Rockstar Games logo, with a larger star representing the star from the logo. Zero RC\n\nThe kites and sail boat inside Zero RC have the Rockstar logo on them. Image Description Carcer Gas\n\nCarcer Gas cylinders are from Carcer City, the setting of Manhunt. Doormat\n\nInside Big Smoke's Crack Palace, there is a doormat that reads \"Not Welcome Rockstar North\" with the Rockstar North logo in the center. Hydra\n\nPart of the text on the side of the Hydra features the letters \"DMA\"; this is likely a reference to Rockstar North since the company was formerly known as DMA Design. DMA is also a play on United States Marine Corps squadrons that use the AV-8B Harrier II (VMA).
