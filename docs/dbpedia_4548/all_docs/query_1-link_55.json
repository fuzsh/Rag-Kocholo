Our global reach, including technicians and field-proven solutions, meets your requirements for NDT. We offer solutions for newly-built equipment, existing infrastructure, and decommissioning activities by identifying the appropriate methods for each application.\n\nWe enable you to maintain a value-adding, continual view of your assets by deploying advanced condition monitoring technologies. We use data collection on an ongoing basis and at defined intervals to ensure you meet regulatory requirements with the most efficient and safe approach."
