An insider at Vis said the company last year had sales of about (pounds) 5m from the game, whose development was part funded by Bank of Scotland.

State of Emergency has sold more than 1.1 million copies since its 2002 release on the PlayStation2. The company is hoping to capitalise further this year on the game with its release on Microsoft's Xbox expected soon.

Chris van der Kuyl, chief executive and president of VIS, said: ''This has been a fantastic year for VIS and one on which we intend to build, both in terms of income and profits and the scale of activities in the digital entertainment sector.

''We are setting a marker for growth in the provision of digital entertainment content. VIS has achieved its milestones, often surpassed its targets, and we have several highly-promising projects in the pipeline to ensure continued growth.''

Meanwhile, tighter cost controls led to an operating profit of (pounds) 4.24m last year, compared with a loss of (pounds) 2.4m the previous year.

Ken Lewandowski, chairman, said: ''The pleasing factor is that as a result of attention to costs and steadily increasing sales, Vis's underlying business has moved into profit even before royalty income from State of Emergency.''

Last month, Vis appointed Jane Karwoski, formerly chief executive of online booking company All-Hotels, as chief operating officer. Vis, with a workforce of almost 200, has studios in Dundee, Edinburgh, London and the Isle of Wight.
