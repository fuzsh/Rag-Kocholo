New Castle: Delaware's First Capital, a Colonial Gem

Founded by the Dutch in 1651, New Castle quickly became a strategic port city and a center of commerce and trade. Its location at the Delaware River and the Christina River confluence made it a natural hub for shipping and transportation. The town also played a crucial role in the region's political development, serving as the capital of the Dutch colony of New Netherland, the Swedish colony of New Sweden, and later, the English colony of Delaware.

Capital of the "Lower Counties":

In 1704, when the "Three Lower Counties on the Delaware" (present-day Delaware) gained a separate legislature from Pennsylvania, New Castle became the colonial capital. This marked a significant step towards Delaware's eventual independence and statehood.

A Brief Stint as State Capital:

Even after the American Revolution, New Castle retained its political importance, briefly serving as the first state capital of Delaware in 1776. However, the following year, the capital was moved to Dover, a more centrally located town within the state.

A Living Museum:

Despite losing its status as the capital, New Castle's historical significance remains intact. The town's well-preserved colonial architecture, cobblestone streets, and historic landmarks glimpse its rich past. The New Castle Historic District, a National Historic Landmark, encompasses a significant portion of the town and includes notable sites like the Old Court House, the Amstel House, and the Read House & Gardens.

A Must-Visit Destination:

Today, New Castle is a popular tourist destination, attracting visitors drawn to its historical charm and scenic beauty. The town hosts various events throughout the year, including the annual Separation Day celebration, which commemorates Delaware's declaration of independence from Pennsylvania.

Beyond its historical significance, New Castle offers a variety of attractions for visitors to enjoy. Stroll along the picturesque waterfront, explore the unique shops and galleries, or dine at one of the town's charming restaurants.
