        "text": "Today’s Delaware counties did not always exist in the present form. They went through many different changes in the space of a few short years.\n\nDelaware Colony Counties\n\nFollowing the English conquest of 1664, all of the land on the western side of the Delaware River and Delaware Bay was governed as part of the New York Colony and administered from the town of New Castle.\n\nDuring the brief recapture of the colony by the Dutch in 1673, additional court districts were created around Upland and Whorekill. The latter was also known as Hoornkill, and is now the town of Lewes.\n\nThe court at New Castle was left with the central portion of the colony. The jurisdiction left to the court at became New Castle County, and the county seat remained at New Castle until 1881 when it was moved to Wilmington.\n\nIn 1680, Whorekill District was divided into Deale County and St. Jones County. After this division, Lewes became the county seat of Deale, which was later renamed Sussex County. The former Upland District was named after the New Sweden settlement of Upland, and was renamed Chester County in 1682. Chester County is now located within the present boundaries of Pennsylvania.\n\nLord Baltimore, the Proprietor of Maryland, claimed all present-day Delaware, and organized its northern and eastern portions as Durham County, Maryland.\n\nHowever, this county existed only on paper. The southern and western portions of present-day Sussex County were organized as portions of several adjacent Maryland counties and were not recognized as part of Delaware until the Mason-Dixon Survey was run in 1767.\n\nIn 1791, with the expansion of Sussex County to the south and west, the county seat was moved to Georgetown. The county seat of St. Jones (renamed Kent County in 1681) is at Dover.\n\nThe State of Delaware entered the union as the 1st state on December 7, 1787.\n\nDelaware Counties Today\n\nToday, Delaware is divided into 3 counties. States bordering Delaware are Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Maryland.\n\nThe divisions, or “hundreds” as they are called, comes from the times when Delaware and Maryland were colonial holdings of Great Britain. While Delaware alone retains the use of “hundreds”, the origin of most “place names” in both states can be traced back to the times of British rule.\n\nAfter 2000, a fourth “Appoquinimink County” was proposed to be carved out of New Castle County. The effort intended to end the zoning restrictions of the Unified Development Code on the undeveloped farmland. The proposed boundaries extended beyond the Appoquinimink Hundred to include all land south of the C&D Canal, with Middletown as the proposed seat.\n\nFun Facts about Delaware Counties\n\nCounties by Year\n\nHoerekill (later DEALE, now SUSSEX), New Amstel (now NEW CASTLE) and Upland Counties was the original 3 county / districts created on September 12, 1673.\n\nSt. Jones County (now KENT) was the last county created on June 21, 1680.\n\nCounty Size Facts\n\nSussex County (1,196 sq mi) is the largest county in Delaware.\n\nNew Castle County (494 sq mi) is the smallest county in Delaware.\n\nCounty Population Facts\n\nKent County (162,310) is the least populated county in Delaware.\n\nNew Castle County (538,479) is the most populated county in Delaware.\n\nDelaware City Facts\n\nDelaware’s 10 largest cities (2018 est.) are:\n\nWilmington (70,635) is in New Castle County\n\nDover (38,079) is in Kent County\n\nNewark (33,673) is in New Castle County\n\nMiddletown (22,582) is in New Castle County\n\nSmyrna (11,580) is in Kent County and New Castle County\n\nMilford (11,353) is in Kent County and Sussex County\n\nSeaford (7,861) is in Sussex County\n\nGeorgetown (7,427) is in Sussex County\n\nElsmere (5,981) is in New Castle County\n\nNew Castle (5,529) is in New Castle County\n\nBoundary Changes of Delaware Counties from 1673 to 1841\n\nThis Interactive Map of Delaware Counties show the historical boundaries, names, organization, and attachments of every county, extinct county and unsuccessful county proposal from 1673 to 1841.\n\nList of Delaware Counties\n\nList of Old Former / Extinct Delaware Counties\n\nAt least 10 Delaware counties that were established no longer exist.
