        "text": "Delaware was first settled by the New Sweden Company in 1638. Their first settlement was named \"Fort Christian\", after the queen of Sweden. In 1655, Peter Stuyvesant captured New Sweden for the Dutch. In 1664, when the English captured New Netherlands they also took control of Delaware territory. By this time the settlers living in Delaware were a very diverse group. Initially, the area was governed from New York. When William Penn founded Pennsylvania, he requested that the territory that became Delaware be added to the colony of Pennsylvania. The Duke of York agreed. Penn had a difficult time governing the colony. In 1701, Penn agreed to allow Delaware to have a separate assembly that would meet in New Castle, while that of Pennsylvania continued to meet in Philadelphia.\n\nBoth colonies were not officially authorized by the England."
