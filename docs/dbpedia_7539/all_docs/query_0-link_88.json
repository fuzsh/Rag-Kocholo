        "text": "Separation Day is the annual celebration of Delaware’s independence from Pennsylvania and the British Crown. 2024 marks the 248th anniversary of arguably one of the longest running traditions in the state. The community event is held annually in Historic New Castle. Friday night festivities include music, food and drink in the center of town. Saturday kicks off with a Colonial-inspired parade. The middle of the day is filled with children’s rides, an Artisan & Vintage market, live music, beer garden and foods prepared by community groups. The day culminates with fireworks over the Delaware River.\n\nRSVP & Invite Guests on Facebook:"
