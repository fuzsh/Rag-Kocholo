        "text": "Delaware Colony Summary\n\nThe history of the Three Lower Counties on the Delaware — one of the official names given to Delaware in its early days, was heavily influenced by Swedish, Dutch, and English colonists. Delaware was first settled as Dutch territory, then was part of New Sweden before returning to Dutch control. In the 1660s, the English finally took control, making it part of the Province of New York. When William Penn needed access to the Atlantic Ocean for his city of Philadelphia, he gained control of the three counties along the Delaware River and eventually granted them a separate government in 1701.\n\nDelaware Colony Facts\n\nDelaware was one of the Middle Colonies in Colonial America.\n\nThe territory was originally inhabited by Native American Indians.\n\nEuropean exploration of the Delaware River Valley started in the early 1600s.\n\nVarious European groups claimed control of the territory during the Colonial Era, including the Dutch, Swedes, and English.\n\nIndian tribes and European colonists were involved in the Fur Trade.\n\nThe first black man in Delaware, Antoni Swart, who was called “Black Anthony,” arrived in 1630.\n\nEngland first took control of Delaware in 1664, and it was part of the Province of New York.\n\nDelaware became a proprietary colony, under the control of William Penn, in 1682.\n\nDelaware was referred to as the Three Lower Counties on the Delaware until it declared independence from Great Britain in 1776.\n\nDelaware’s history is closely tied to Pennsylvania, because of William Penn.\n\nGeography\n\nThe Three Counties on the Delaware\n\nThe Province of Delaware was the second smallest of the 13 Original Colonies, covering less than 2,000 square miles across three counties — New Castle, Sussex, and Kent. The northwest corner of Delaware, mainly New Castle County, was covered with rolling foothills, while Southern Delaware ran along the coast and was covered with wetlands.\n\nThe River and the Bay\n\nThe Delaware River and Delaware Bay dominated the landscape, flowing north to south and providing access to the Atlantic Ocean. European powers vied for control of the region because of access provided by the river and bay, which also made New Castle and Wilmington important port towns during the Colonial Era.\n\nNative American Indians\n\nArchaeological findings indicate that nomadic hunters and gatherers started living in the region — known as the Delmarva Peninsula — around 6500 B.C. From 1000 A.D. to 1300 A.D., the indigenous populations transitioned to more settled lifestyles, relying on hunting and basic agriculture for food.\n\nIn their villages, there were clear gender roles. Men hunted alone, and women farmed together. The significant exception was fall deer hunts, which included everyone.\n\nThe Delaware Tribes\n\nIn the early 17th century, the Delmarva Peninsula was home to three main tribes, even though European colonists referred to them collectively as the Delaware Indians.\n\nLenope\n\nLenape\n\nNanticoke\n\nThe Lenope and Lenape were the most prominent, and spoke a dialect of the Algonquin language, although they became distinctly separate tribes around A.D. 1300 A.D. Both tribes lived near the Delaware River and Delaware Bay, relying on the seasonal migration of fish and game for food.\n\nThe Nanticoke lived in the southwest part of the peninsula, which later became Sussex County.\n\nTrade with Europeans\n\nBy the early 17th century, the Indians, primarily the Lenape, had enjoyed more than 50 years of friendly trade with Dutch and Swedish colonists. This beneficial trade relationship continued, even when Pennsylvania’s government controlled Delaware.\n\nThe Delaware tribes were often in conflict with other Indian nations, including the Iroquois Confederacy and the Susquehannocks. Threats from these nations encouraged the Delaware tribes to trade for European goods and move further inland.\n\nDisplacement of Indians\n\nBy the mid-18th century, three main factors that contributed to the displacement of Indians from their ancestral lands:\n\nEuropean settlement on Native hunting grounds.\n\nThe impact of European diseases on the non-immune Native American population.\n\nThe growing European population.\n\nIn the mid-18th century, the Lenape moved to western Pennsylvania where they continued to participate in the Fur Trade. Over time, they moved further west, relocating to Ohio, Canada, and even west of the Mississippi River into present-day Oklahoma.\n\nEuropean Control of Delaware\n\nControl of the Delaware Colony shifted between England, the Netherlands, and Sweden. In 1664, England finally took control of Delaware, when a fleet of English ships took over New Netherland.\n\nHenry Hudson\n\nIn 1609, Henry Hudson, an English explorer working for the Dutch, explored the Delmarva Peninsula, in search of the fabled Northwest Passage. He sailed up the Delaware River, which he called the “South River,” and claimed the region for the Dutch.\n\nZwaanendael Colony\n\nHowever, the Dutch did not establish a permanent settlement until 1631. That year, a group of about 30 colonists established Zwaanendael — also spelled Swanendael — at Cape Henlopen on Lewes Creek to hunt whales and produce whale oil.\n\nUnfortunately, the settlement lasted less than a year when the colonists clashed with local Indians. According to most accounts, the Indians stole a piece of tin, intending to use it to make tobacco pipes. The incident escalated, and nearly all of the colonists were killed. The only survivors were two boys, Pierre and Hendrick Wiltsee.\n\nIt took the Dutch another 24 years before they attempted to resettle in the Delaware region.\n\nNew Sweden\n\nIn 1638, the New Sweden Company founded a settlement on Minquan Kil, which was later renamed Christiana River in honor of the Queen of Sweden.\n\nDuring this period, the Thirty Years’ War (1618–1648) was taking place in Europe, and Sweden sought to establish itself as a colonial power. Sweden permitted Dutch merchants to create settlements and trading posts along the west bank of the Delaware River, which formed New Sweden. However, New Sweden struggled for most of the time it existed, although there was limited success under the administration of Governor Johan Printz.\n\nIn the early 1650s, officials from New Sweden and New Netherland argued over territorial claims, but neither group had the military resources needed to enforce their claims. However, during the Second Northern War (1665–1660), the conflict spilled over to North America and Dutch forces took control of New Sweden, making it part of New Netherland.\n\nDuring the time of Swedish and Dutch control, Delaware had a small population of a few thousand Indians and less than 1,000 Europeans who were Swedes, Dutch, and Finns. There were also around 100 African slaves and servants.\n\nIt is also estimated that around 1,000 Europeans — Swedes, Dutch, and Finns — and Africans were living along the Delaware River Valley. These people were located in trading settlements that went as far north as present-day Burlington, New Jersey.\n\nDelaware Under the Control of New York\n\nIn 1664, King Charles II of England issued a charter to his brother James, the Duke of York, granting him the territory between the Delaware River and the Connecticut River. This grant included Dutch territory in New Netherland, including the settlement at New Amsterdam.\n\nJames sent a fleet of ships to take control of New Amsterdam, which was surrendered by the Governor, Peter Stuyvesant, without a fight. With New Netherland under English control, it was renamed the Province of New York and New Amsterdam was renamed New York City.\n\nA smaller fleet, led by Sir Robert Carr, attacked the Dutch stronghold at New Amstel in northern Delaware, which was renamed New Castle.\n\nEnglish officials paid little attention to Delaware when it was part of New York.\n\nThe Lower Three Counties\n\nDelaware was part of New York until 1682, when William Penn, the founder of Pennsylvania, requested control from the Duke of York. Penn needed access to the Delaware River, Delaware Bay, and Atlantic Ocean for Philadelphia. The Duke of York responded by leasing the three counties in Delaware to Penn.\n\nPenn decided to keep the name New Castle for the northern county, but he renamed the two southern counties, calling them Kent and Sussex.\n\nThe three counties remained part of Pennsylvania and were not independent. The colony was known as the “Government of the Counties of New Castle, Kent, and Sussex on Delaware” or simply the “Lower Counties.”\n\nIn December 1682, Penn and the First General Assembly of Pennsylvania convened to enact laws. On December 4, the “Act of the Union of the Province and Territories” was enacted, which joined Pennsylvania and the Lower Counties under one government. A second act, naturalized all “foreigners then residing within the province and territories.”\n\nPenn proposed his Frame of Government, which ensured residents of the Lower Counties had equal representation in Pennsylvania’s General Assembly. As part of the shared government, meetings of the General Assembly were shared between the two colonies, alternating between Philadelphia and New Castle.\n\nIn 1701, Penn and the Assembly agreed to the 1701 Charter of Privileges, which allowed Delaware to establish its own General Assembly. As part of the agreement, Delaware agreed to remain under the jurisdiction of the Governor of Pennsylvania, who was appointed by Penn.\n\nThe Delaware General Assembly held its first independent meeting in New Castle in 1704. The two colonies shared the same Governor for the remained of the Colonial Era until the Lower Counties declared independence from Great Britain and adopted the name “Delaware.”\n\nPopulation and Immigration\n\nAs New England and the Middle Colonies developed, colonists migrated to Delaware, including Quakers. As Europe continued to be plagued by wars over religion and monarchies, more people emigrated to the English Colonies.\n\nIn Northern Delaware, New Castle was the largest settlement and attracted artisans and merchants. The surrounding countryside was populated with small farms owned by Swedes, Dutch, and English. Some of those farms relied on slave labor and nearly all of them were focused on the production of grain, which could be easily shipped to Philadelphia and sold.\n\nAlong the waterways that branched off of the Christiana River and Delaware River, mills were built around the town of Wilmington to process corn and wheat into flour. By the 1740s, Wilmington was a leader in the production of flour.\n\nIn Southern Delaware, the counties of Kent and Sussex were similar to Maryland, which lay to the south and west. It was in those areas where slavery gained a foothold in Delaware.\n\nMost white families in Southern Delaware were involved in farming, using family labor alongside indentured servants and sometimes as many as two African slaves. However, it was the large plantation owners, who had 20 or more slaves, who dominated society, politics, and the economy of the southern counties.\n\nSlavery in Delaware\n\nDuring Swedish control of Delaware from 1638 to 1655, only a small number of captured Africans were brought to Delaware as slaves, partly due to the limited resources of the New Sweden Company.\n\nWhen New Sweden was taken over by the Dutch, settlers in Delaware had access to the slave trade through the Dutch West Indian Company, which contributed to an increase in the number of enslaved Africans in the colony. It is estimated that roughly 20 percent of the population of Delaware was made up of enslaved people by 1664.\n\nWhile early economies of nearby colonies like Virginia and Maryland relied on Indentured Servants from England to drive the workforce, Delaware’s access to the slave trade contributed to slavery becoming the primary way to acquire workers. Over time, both Virginia and Maryland shifted to slavery, especially after Bacon’s Rebellion took place.\n\nBy the early 1700s, around 30 percent of the people in Delaware were enslaved, while that number reached anywhere from 40 to 60 percent in Virginia and Maryland.\n\nAfter Pennsylvania was founded and unified with the Lower Counties, there was a significant influx of Scots-Irish into Delaware. Many of them arrived as Indentured Servants, brought their families with them, and settled in New Castle County. It is estimated that from the 1720s to the 1760s the number of Indentured Servants was about the same as the enslaved population, roughly 30 percent.\n\nBlack Anthony\n\nIn 1639, the first documented black man arrived in present-day Delaware. Known as “Black Anthony,” he arrived from the West Indies on the ship Fogel Grip. According to some accounts, he had been kidnapped by the captain of the ship. His real name was Antoni Swart and he eventually became a free man, who found employment with Governor Johan Printz.\n\nEconomy\n\nLeading up to the 1750s, Delaware’s agricultural economy was focused on tobacco, corn, and wheat. However, in the 1750s, tobacco became an unprofitable crop, leading planters and farmers to develop trade connections with Philadelphia merchants and transition their focus from tobacco to grain production.\n\nThe production of corn and wheat was less labor-intensive than tobacco, which reduced the need for labor in Delaware over the long term. The influx of Indentured Servants supplied enough workers, which helped keep slavery from growing at the rate it did in Virginia and Maryland.\n\nGovernment and Politics\n\nThe “Hundred” was a unique political unit in between Pennsylvania’s townships and Maryland’s counties, and served as the foundation for government and community in Delaware. They were essentially unincorporated subdivisions of the counties.\n\nThe first Hundreds were established in 1682. There were five Hundreds in New Castle County, five in Kent County, and two in Sussex County. As the population grew, so did the number of Hundreds\n\nIn the southern counties, political life was dominated by wealthy planters who sought the support of middle-class property holders. In northern New Castle County, where there were fewer slaves and planters, both merchants and farmers had more active, equal roles in politics.\n\nAcross Delaware, freeholders elected local officials, while the governor, following the assembly’s recommendations, appointed judges and justices of the peace. In each county, voters elected tax assessors and sheriffs. These officials worked with the justices of the peace to govern the three counties.\n\nSociety\n\nIn Northern Delaware, where there was a larger Quaker community, there was little emphasis on social hierarchy and subordination of the lower classes, including enslaved people and indentured servants. Women also held more authority within their families and in community institutions like churches.\n\nIn Southern Delaware, where there was a significant population of slaves and indentured servants, relationships were built around social hierarchy and subordination. Plantation owners were responsible for governing and caring for the people living on their lands, which could include: gentry planters, yeoman farmers, free white people who did not own property, white indentured servants, and enslaved Africans.\n\nTimeline and Chronology\n\nBefore the arrival of Europeans, most Indians along the Delaware River identified as Lenni Lenapes, meaning “original people.” They spoke an Algonquian dialect and lived in loosely connected villages. The villages were situated between the Iroquois Confederacy and the Susquehannock, resulting in conflicts between the Delaware tribes and the larger nations.\n\n1609 — Henry Hudson, an Englishman in command of the Dutch ship Half Moon, visited Delaware Bay while searching for the Northwest Passage. His reports increased the interest of both the Dutch and English in the Delaware River Valley.\n\n1610 — Captain Samuel Argall, an Englishman working for the Virginia Company, named Delaware Bay after Thomas West, Baron De La Warr, the governor of Virginia Colony.\n\n1614 — The Dutch identified the whole mid-Atlantic region, from Jamestown to Quebec, as New Netherland. Their goal was to profit from the Fur Trade and fishing in and around Delaware Bay.\n\n1614 — Captain Cornelis Mey explored Delaware Bay, naming Fenwick’s Island and Cape Hindlopen. He also gives present-day Cape Henlopen, across from Cape Mey, the name Cape Cornelis\n\n1615 — Captain Cornelis Hendrkksen explored the Delaware River up to Schuylkill\n\n1621 — The Dutch States-General granted the Dutch West India Company a trade monopoly, including commerce with Africa’s west coast and the Americas. The company established the earliest European settlements in the Delaware River Valley, although they were mostly trading posts and not permanent.\n\n1623 — Captain Mey sailed up Prince Hendricks River and built a Dutch trading post, Fort Nassau, at present-day Gloucester, New Jersey.\n\n1629 — The States-General approved the “Freedoms and Exemptions” charter, which granted independent settlers the right to as much land as they could cultivate. It also allowed stockholders in the West India Company to become patroons by settling 50 adults in New Netherland.\n\nThis “Patroon System” also allowed the stockholders to pass the land to their heirs. Patroonships initially included 16 miles of riverfront land and extended inland as far as possible.\n\nLand at Cape Henlopen was granted to Samuel Godyn, Samuel Blommaers, and David de Vries, making them Patroons.\n\n1631 — Samuel Godyn commissioned a group of 28 men, led by Captain Peter Heycs, to establish the first European settlement in present-day Delaware on Noorn Kill. It was called Zwaanendael or Swanendael because of the number of swans living in the area. Today, the area is part of Lewes, Delaware.\n\n1632 — Capt. David Pieterssen De Vries visited Zwaanendael. He found the colony destroyed and all but two boys were killed by Indians.\n\n1637 — The New Sweden company was organized. The first expedition set sail from Gothenburg, Sweden in two ships, the Kalmar Nyckel (Key of Kalmar) and the Fogel Grip (Bird Griffin).\n\n1638 — Fort Christina, the first permanent European settlement in present-day Delaware and the entire Delaware River Valley was established by the New Sweden Company, a joint Dutch-Swedish trading corporation, led by Peter Minuet.\n\nThe first colonists were 23 men, including Minuet, Captain Mans Kling, and Hendrick Huygen, the commissary. Minuet and his expedition disembarked at The Rocks\n\nFort Christina was initially funded by the Dutch but most of the colonists were Swedes. By 1641, Swedish investors bought out the Dutch stockholders.\n\nFort Christina was located along Minquas Kill (Christina River) at present-day Wilmington, Delaware.\n\n1639 — The first documented African in Delaware, known as “Black Anthony,” arrived at Fort Christina.\n\n1640 — The second and third expeditions arrived at New Sweden. Some of the new colonists included Governor Peter Hollandaer and Reverend Reorus Torkillus, the first clergyman. Torkillus was also the first Lutheran minister in America.\n\n1641 — The fourth expedition arrived with 35 new colonists, including Herr Christoffer, a clergyman. Many of the colonists were from Finland.\n\n1643 — The fifth expedition arrived, carrying Lieutenant Colonel Johan Printz, the new Governor of New Sweden.\n\nUnder the leadership of Printz, New Sweden had its most successful years. He oversaw the construction of Fort Elfsborg at Varckens Kill, New Jersey., Fort New Gothenburg at Tinicum, Pennsylvania. and a blockhouse at Upland (present-day Chester, Pennsylvania). He also established a tobacco plantation on the Schuylkill River.\n\nBy 1643, the population of New Sweden was 118 people.\n\n1644 — The sixth Swedish expedition arrived. Due to deaths and some colonists returning the Europe, the population dropped to 98.\n\n1646 — The seventh expedition arrived, carrying goods, but only a few new colonists.\n\n1649 — A supply ship, The Kattan (The Cat), wrecked near Puerto Rico.\n\n1651 — Peter Stuyvesant of New Amsterdam took control of the Fur Trade from New Sweden. He sailed with a fleet of 11 ships to the Delaware River, marched overland with 120 soldiers, and occupied Sandhook (present-day New Castle). He built Fort Casimir, giving the Dutch control of the river.\n\n1653 — Printz resigned as Governor and returned to Sweden. The population of New Sweden continued to fall, while 36 families were living at the Dutch settlement at Fort Casimir.\n\n1654 — An expedition arrived, carrying Governor Johan Rising and new colonists, boosting the population to 368. Rising captured Fort Casimir, renamed it Fort Trefaldighet and left a garrison of Swedish troops.\n\nIn taking the fort, New Sweden regained control of the river. This allowed Rising to make improvements to the colony’s infrastructure, including new roads, farms, and a village near Fort Christina called Christianahamn.\n\nAnother expedition followed but failed to land at Delaware Bay. It arrived at New Amsterdam, where it was seized by Peter Stuyvesant.\n\n1655 — Stuyvesant led another military expedition against New Sweden. With 7 ships and 300 men under his command, he forced the garrison at Fort Trefaldighet to surrender. The fort was renamed Fort Casimir.\n\nStuyvesant led his forces to Fort Christina, where he laid siege to the fort and burned the town of Christinahamn. After 12 days, the Swedes surrendered.\n\nThe Dutch had control of the Delaware River and New Sweden. The New Sweden Colony came to an end and became part of New Netherland.\n\nAlthough some Swedes returned to Europe, many remained and accepted Dutch rule, because they were granted religious freedom.\n\n1656 — A supply ship, the Mercurius arrived from Sweden with 110 new settlers. Jean Paul Jacquet, Dutch Vice-Director and Chief Magistrate of the South River, refused to permit them to land, but they disembarked at Tinicum.\n\n1657 — The territory of Delaware was divided. Fort Altena (formerly Fort Christina) was the seat of government for the northern region. Fort Casimir and its adjoining town, New Amstel, were the seat of government for the southern region.\n\nTogether, Fort Casimir and New Amstel were referred to as “City Colony.”\n\n1657 — An expedition carrying Jacob Alrichs, the new Director, and 125 Dutch settlers, including Evert Pietersen, first schoolmaster, arrived at New Amstel. The increase in population increased the number of homes in New Amstel to around 100.\n\n1659 — A trading post was established at Hoorn Kill, which is present-day Lewes.\n\n1659 — The population of New Amstel was devastated by famine and disease, and roughly 30 families remained. The Calvert Family claimed ownership of the western shore of Delaware. Stuyvesant responded by sending Augustine Herrman and Resolved Waldron to discuss the situation with Lieutenant-General Josias Fendall, the 4th Proprietary Governor of Maryland. However, no resolution is reached.\n\n1662 — A Mennonite colony was established at Cape Henlopen by Peter Plockhoy.\n\n1663 — City Colony, was a diverse community of Dutch, Swedish, and Finnish settlers. The northern settlements, or the Upper Colony, were still largely Swedish. In 1663, the two colonies were merged under one government.\n\n1664 — King Charles II of England granted his brother, James, Duke of York, a substantial portion of the American coast, which included the Dutch territory of New Netherland.\n\nJames sent an expedition under the command of Sir Richard Nicolls to take possession of the Dutch territories. New Netherland tried to defend itself but was surprised when four ships and 450 soldiers arrived.\n\nTwo English ships, under the command of Robert Carr, took possession of the Upper Colony without a fight. However, Fort Casimir resisted, leading the English to storm the fort and capture it. The name was changed to New Castle.\n\nWith the victory, the English controlled the Delaware River.\n\nCarr also destroyed the Plockhoy’s Quaker colony.\n\n1667 — Sir Francis Lovelace was named Governor of the Duke of York’s territory. Carr was named Deputy Governor over the Delaware settlements.\n\n1669 — The Long Finn Rebellion took place, led by Marcus Jacobson who was known as the “Long Finn.” The rebellion failed and Jacobson was banished to Barbados.\n\n1673 — Courts were established at Upland, New Castle, and Hoorn Kill.\n\n1673 — During the Third Anglo-Dutch War, the Dutch briefly regained control of the Delaware River Valley. However, the 1674 Treaty of Westminster returned the region to English control.\n\n1674 — Edmund Andros was appointed as Governor of New York and its territories, including Delaware.\n\n1676 — Andros applies the Duke’s Laws to Delaware.\n\n1680 — The southern region, Hoornkill County, was divided into St. Jones County (Kent) and Deal County (Sussex).\n\nThe first court was held in St. Jones County.\n\nAuthorization was given to build a log Courthouse at Hoornkill. The budget was set at 5,000 pounds of tobacco.\n\n1681 — William Penn was granted the charter for Pennsylvania from King Charles II.\n\n1682 — Penn was granted the western portion of New York, running across the Delaware River, by the Duke of York.\n\n1682 — Penn arrived in America on the ship Welcome.\n\nHe disembarked at New Castle and officially took control on October 27.\n\nPenn’s deputy, William Markham, was given control of the two southern counties in Delaware, which were renamed by Penn.\n\n1682 — The first General Assembly of “Province of Pennsylvania and Three Lower Counties on the Delaware” met at Upland in December.\n\n1682 — Delaware representatives voted to join with Pennsylvania, however, this created a dispute between Penn and Lord Baltimore, the proprietor of Maryland, over the borders of Pennsylvania, Maryland, and Delaware.\n\n1684 — The Calvert Family continued to claim their charter included the territory of southern and western Delaware. Maryland dispatched Colonel George Talbot who built a small fort near the town of Christiana.\n\n1688–1689 — The Glorious Revolution took place in England. King James II, formerly the Duke of York and a close friend of Penn, fled the country in the wake of a Dutch invasion. William of Orange and Mary took the throne of England. Several of James II’s friends and political allies, including Penn, faced imprisonment. Penn was eventually released, but during his absence, Delaware essentially separated from Pennsylvania for three years. In response, Penn appointed a separate governor for the Lower Counties, which had developed differently from Pennsylvania and had a higher percentage of Anglicans.\n\n1690 — The first “Hundreds” were established.\n\n1691 — The Lords of Trade proposed placing Pennsylvania under royal control. The government of the Delaware counties was separated from Pennsylvania and William Markham was named Deputy Governor.\n\n1692 — King William III suspended Penn’s charter and took control of Pennsylvania. Colonel Benjamin Fletcher was appointed Governor. The charter was suspended over accusations the colony was not adequately prepared to defend itself against France, during King William’s War.\n\n1693 — Fletcher, who was also the Governor of New York, arrived in April and appointed William Markham as his Lieutenant Governor. Fletcher was unpopular from the start. He increased the size of the Provincial Council and reduced the size of the Provincial Assembly.
