        "text": "Visit one of the oldest courthouses in the United States that has played a role in a number of historic events. Built in 1732, the New Castle Court House served as Delaware’s first court and state capitol.\n\nOn your tour, you’ll hear about critical events in the history of Delaware – in 1776, New Castle, Kent and Sussex counties declared their independence from Pennsylvania and England creating the Delaware State.\n\nYou’ll also learn about the significant events that took place involving slavery and the Underground Railroad, including the trials of abolitionists Thomas Garrett and John Hunn. In 2003, the New Castle Court House was designated as a National Historic Underground Railroad Site by the U.S. Department of Interior and awarded inclusion in the Nation Park Service Network to Freedom Program.\n\nIt was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1972, and in 2013, was included as a partner site in the First State National Historical Park – so be sure and check out the other attractions nearby.\n\nTours:\n\nTours of the museum are approximately 45 minutes in length, and are available on Monday (June- early Sept.), Wednesday through Saturday on the hour from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m.; and on Sundays at 1:30 p.m., 2:30 p.m. and 3:30 p.m.\n\nLogistics:\n\nOn street parking is available throughout the Historic New Castle area.\n\nHours:\n\nMonday (June – Sept.),\n\nWednesday through Saturday from 10am-4:00pm\n\nSunday from 1:30pm-4:30pm\n\nAdmission:\n\nThe museum is open to the public and admission is free. Donations are appreciated."
