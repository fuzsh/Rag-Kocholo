        "text": "Experience the history of the First State through the many stories of those who have come before.\n\nIn the Delaware History Museum, students will Discover Delaware. Experience and explore the First State’s unique past, present and future. In the Mitchell Center for African American Heritage, students will Journey to Freedom. Discover African Americans’ struggle for human rights and dignity in Delaware and in the nation.\n\n$2.00 per student, all ages\n\n$1.00 per student when combined with a school program.\n\nIn this interactive program students will discover remarkable African Americans from Delaware who achieved personal greatness and expanded opportunities for others. What were the keys to their success? How did their personal philosophies, evidenced by their actions, inspire them to break barriers and overcome obstacles based on race or gender? The Delaware History Museums exhibitions, Discover Delaware and Journey to Freedom, will serve as a backdrop as students portray the stories of church and community leader Peter Spencer, baseball Hall of Famer Judy Johnson, civil rights lawyer Louis Redding, artist Ed Loper, and basketball star Val Whiting.\n\n$3.50 per student, 90 minutes, Grades 1-4\n\nIn 1638, Sweden established a colony in present day Delaware. The settlers encountered the Lenape, who had been living here for centuries. How did the Lenape and the settlers interact? Was there conflict or did the two cultures find a way to work together? Students will learn about the lifestyles of the Lenape and the “first contact” with Swedish settlers through discussion, artifact analysis, and participation in a trade activity illustrating the economic relationship that characterized the beginning of the colony of New Sweden.\n\n$3.50 per student, 90 minutes, Grades: 3-6\n\nDelaware played an important role in the political and military events that helped shape the outcome of the American Revolution. Students will bring the history of Revolutionary Delaware to life by stepping into the roles of important Delaware political figures, soldiers, and civilians.\n\n$3.00 per student, 1/2 day; $6.00 per student for full day, Grades: 4-8\n\nWhat was it like to seek freedom on the Underground Railroad? Students explore this question as they learn about freedom seekers and the brave men and women, both enslaved and free, who made this region one of the most successful routes to freedom in the years before the Civil War. The challenges faced by those involved in the Underground Railroad are explored and reinforced through primary source analysis and a visit to Old Town Hall jail cells (weather permitting).\n\n$3.50 per student, 90 minutes, Grades 4-12\n\nWhat constitutes civic engagement? Why does it matter? Is civic engagement worth the effort? The rights established by the 1st Amendment are imperative to the workings of American democracy and essential for citizenship in a diverse society. Along with these rights come responsibilities. Citizens have the right and the responsibility to participate in governing our nation and they may choose among many different ways of doing this. Citizens fulfill their responsibilities by active participation in government and society in a multitude of ways, to engage with and even challenge their elected representatives, and to develop and communicate their values and opinions.\n\nExamining the rights set forth in the 1st Amendment and utilizing primary sources related to the topics of immigration, voting rights, desegregation, and eminent domain, students will explore the ways in which Delaware citizens have been active participants in the political process throughout Delaware’s history. Through inquiry and discussion, students will apply what they have learned by creating tweets in favor of or opposed to each issue and discuss additional ways students can become citizen activists.\n\n$3.50 per student, 2 hours, Grades 7-12"
