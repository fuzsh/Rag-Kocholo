        "text": "With approximately 1000 people, New Castle is one of the smallest towns in Kentucky with a preservation district and is certified in both “Kentucky Main Street\" and “Preserve America” Programs. We are very proud of our efforts to preserve our historical buildings and rural heritage.\n\nNew Castle has one of the few remaining intact 19th Century courthouse squares in Kentucky. Our homes and commercial buildings allow us glimpses of the rich architectural history of our city. A tractor on Main Street is as common as a car, truck, or school bus. This is what makes us a unique rural community.\n\nCITY OF NEW CASTLE, KY PUBLIC NOTICE\n\nThe City of New Castle will hold a public hearing on Monday, September 9, 2024 at 5:45pm at the Locker Building, 24 S. Main Street, for the purpose of obtaining comments from the public regarding the proposed tax rate for real and personal property.\n\nThe rate levied last year was .140 for real and personal property and produced revenues in the amount of $67,597. This year’s compensating rate for real and personal property is .137 and will produce revenues in the amount of $67,126. The City of New Castle may propose a tax rate of .143 for real and personal property which will produce a maximum of $69,568 in revenues. The City may propose to leave the rate unchanged at .140 which would produce revenues in the amount of $68,108.\n\nThe tax rate for Motor Vehicles and Watercraft is .171 cents per $100 of assessed value and will produce revenues in the amount of $10,856.\n\nRevenue received in excess of last year’s revenue will be used for General Fund Expenditures.\n\nThose unable to attend may submit written comments to the City Clerk, 31 E. Cross Main St., New Castle, Kentucky by 4pm on Monday September 09, 2024. If you wish to attend but require special accommodations, please contact the City Clerk, 845-5750 no later than 4pm on Friday, September 6, 2024.\n\nThe Kentucky General Assembly requires that the City of New Castle publish this notice with the above information contained herein."
