Known as the “First State,” Delaware played a vital role in the founding of the United States, with its residents signing the Declaration of Independence and Constitution. From its colonial beginnings to its modern-day charm, Delaware has plenty of stories to tell.\n\nDelaware State Facts FAQ\n\nHow did Delaware become a state?\n\nDelaware declared its independence from Great Britain on June 15, 1776 and thereby also became independent of Pennsylvania with which it had been connected since 1682. Delaware was the first to ratify the U.S. Constitution and thus became known as the “First State.”\n\nWhat's Delaware's Flag?\n\nDelaware adopted the current state flag on July 24, 1913.
