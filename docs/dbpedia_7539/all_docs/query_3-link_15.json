        "meta_description": "Founded by Dutch settlers in the 1650s, this riverside community was recognized for its historical significance in 1967, when its Colonial-era historic district was designated as a National Landmark. While the list of noteworthy sites here is seemingly endless, highly recommend stops include the Old New Castle Courthouse (seat of Delaware’s colonial and state government until 1777); the Delaware Historical Society’s Read House and Gardens; and the three museums operated by the New Castle Historical Society. Hours of operation: Monday - Friday (9:00 a.m. &#8211; 4:00 p.m.) Note: The Delaware History Trail sign is located in front of the Old Court House. Please Note: Many of the historic roads of New Castle contain uneven bricks and cobblestones.",
