        "text": "The sun rises in a view looking toward Cougar Mountain and Mount Rainier from Newcastle City Hall.\n\nA Young City with Deep Roots in History\n\nIncorporated in 1994, Newcastle is a relatively new city with a storied past. Before Washington became a state, Newcastle was one of the most successful coal mining towns in northwestern Washington. Nearly 11 million tons of coal was extracted from the area between 1869 and 1963. Coal from Newcastle helped fuel the growth of the entire Puget Sound region. View this page for more about the city's history.\n\nThirty years after the end of the coal mining era, a movement began toward local government and control. In April 1993, proponents succeeded in passing a ballot measure to establish 4.4 square miles of unincorporated King County into the City of Newport Hills. The city officially incorporated Sept. 30, 1994, as Newport Hills, and after a November 1994 vote, the city's name was changed to Newcastle.\n\nAt the time of incorporation, the city's population was about 4,654, according to U.S. Census estimates. According to the Census Bureau's 2015 population estimate, 11,370 people call Newcastle home, and the city continues to grow with record levels of new development. Due to housing market conditions, several high-density residential projects are under construction or are under review. View the Newcastle at a Glance page for additional demographic data.\n\nNewcastle is a peaceful, small residential community located between Bellevue, Renton and Issaquah within the Seattle metropolitan area. Residents enjoy a scenic atmosphere, a short commute to work centers and convenient access to recreation and urban amenities."
