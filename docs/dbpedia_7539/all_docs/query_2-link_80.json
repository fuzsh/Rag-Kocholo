As for religion, there isn't a specific dominant religion. We have Catholics, Quakers, Lutherans, Jews, and other. Our diverse colony is about freedom, with many farmers and ranchers, and immigrants from all over Europe and more.\n\nThere are lots of jobs available in Delaware. Some jobs include working in merchant mills, in which you would be able to make flour in. Other jobs include but are not limited to work in coopering or barrel making industries, shipbuilding areas, lumber industry, fishing, farming and ranching, and the shoe and boot industry where shoes and boots are made from animal skin, Delaware's diverse culture includes many job industries to work in, allowing immigrants from various countries to find something that they are talented in, and unique businesses to come."
