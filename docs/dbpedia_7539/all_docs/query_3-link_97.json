        "text": "This historic park was the landing place of William Penn when he first came to America, and he designed the city so this green space could be preserved forever.\n\nIf you enjoy biking, running or walking, spend some time on the Battery Park Trail that runs along the Delaware River, providing amazing views of waterfowl, ships and the Delaware Memorial Bridge.\n\nIf you’re fortunate, you may see the Kalmar Nyckel docked, on a stopover as she journeys along the Atlantic seaboard. Also, be sure to check out the original ticket office for the New Castle and Frenchtown Railroad, built in 1832.\n\nThe expansive public park along the trail is a favorite spot for locals and visitors to picnic and play. It features several playgrounds for the kids, tennis courts and public restrooms. Only a short walk away and you’re in the heart of Historic New Castle.\n\nLogistics:\n\nA small parking lot is available at the intersection of South St and W. 3rd St.\n\nHours:\n\nOpen from dawn to dusk"
