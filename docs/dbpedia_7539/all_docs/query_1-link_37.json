        "text": "We left Bristol on May 18th at 8 a.m. and arrived in New Castle about 9:30\n\nam and were given our tickets and map of the area The houses were not yet open so we visited some of the beautiful gardens.\n\nNew Castle was founded as a Dutch fort in 1651, became the capital of the colony in 1704 and the capital of Delaware State in 1776. After the Dutch settlement, Sweden, Great Britain and the United States all had a part in the history of the town.\n\nMost of the houses on one street near the river were formerly warehouses and were built by a man who also owned a lumber yard back in the early 1800’s. When a fire destroyed these wooden buildings, they were rebuilt of brick and people created houses out of them. The houses originally had two rooms, one above the other, but the owners now have enlarged them by adding on rooms at the back upstairs and downstairs and have furnished them very attractively – some with very nice antiques.\n\nI was interested to learn that New Castle was the first place William Penn landed in America on October 27, 1682. We met three men in colonial garb, representing William Penn, James Logan, and the town crier, in front of a sign explaining “Livery of Seisin” giving Penn possession of the land by delivering to him “one turf with a twig upon it and a porringer with river water and soil”. This is close by Packet Alley, a narrow walkway, which leads to the main public wharf. Important travelers walked through here on their way to Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Washington or Alexandria.\n\nOn one of the properties, there was a small one room building with a tin ceiling and all the visitors speculated slaves had lived here. Upon my questioning the owner, he said he and his son had built it as a family project and it was a replica of an old one room library similar to one he had seen in Beartown, New Jersey.\n\nBy the green, along the waterfront was a replica of the “Kalmar Nyckel” which cost $3.2 million when it was built in Wilmington several years ago. The original ship, all wood, sailed from Sweden to America in 1637 and made four round trips which was more than any other ship of the period.\n\nIt was interesting talking with the crew made up of male and female volunteers who all have full time jobs during the week. The ship contains 20th century technology, is a living history museum, serves as a sail training vessel and can be chartered for sailing trips or parties. People can support it by contributions to the Kalmar Nyckel Foundation.\n\nWe went aboard to tour the ship and it was similar to “The Eye of the Wind,” a larger ship, which I toured last summer in Philadelphia with my daughter, Ann. She spent three months on the island of Sulawesi, Indonesia with the “Operation Drake” program helping to set up a national park. One of her jobs was to climb a ladder 90 feet in the air and walk on an 18-inch platform to set up nets to catch bats. She disentangled many bats, including one that had not been seen since 1928.\n\nAnn sailed on the “Eye” from Sulawesi to Djakarta, Indonesia in 1980 and she was amazed to see that one of the owners whom she knew, Tiger Tibbs, was still on the ship. The ship is still conducting sail training exercises to various parts of the world, as is the Kalmar Nyckel. Tiger was nice enough to let us go below deck to see where Ann and the rest of the crew had bunked so we could get an idea of the sparse accommodations. We were not able to go below deck on the Kalmar Nyckel but they hope for Coast Guard approval to carry between 70 to 145 people. One of the women on the Kalmar Nyckel said she saw Ann’s ship berthed next to hers at the “Sail Boston” operation.\n\nDown on the green by the river, we listened to a group of men and women in costume playing a fife and drum. In talking with them, we learned that they travel around the eastern seaboard performing at various historic events. We made note of their names and said we would see if there was anyone in our area who might be able to use their services.\n\nEverywhere we walked, people were selling various items to buy or to eat like funnel cakes or ice cream. The churches and restaurants had various kinds of food to offer and we saw women and children learning how to make nosegays of silk flowers with ribbons as they do at Winterthur. It may be handy to use these as ideas for Bristol Day.\n\nAlong the waterfront there was a sign proclaiming the site of the Newcastle and Frenchtown Railroad which was built in 1832 and was one of the first railroads in the country to Frenchtown on the Elk River and connecting the North and South. It was absorbed by the Delaware Railroad in 1856.\n\nWe stopped to listen to a woman dressed in 1860’s clothing describing her clothes and clothes other women around her were wearing. She explained that under the clothes they were wearing “whale bone” (now plastic) hoops to make the skirts stand out. This, in turn, made the women’s waists look smaller and various belts gave that impression also.\n\nThe women usually remained cool as the hoops kept the clothing away from the body. The women’s long sleeves could be detached at night to feature short sleeves. Women and men always wore solid material gloves of leather or cotton for dancing as this kept their hands from perspiring. Women usually wore their hair parted in the middle to make their faces look rounder and they usually kept out of the sun to keep their skin white. Also, in their fashions, they looked to Queen Victoria.\n\nOne of the men, Larry Keener-Farley, explained the styles of the men. He told us the women bought material in bulk and made their own clothing (or hired dress and suit makers) and also made three piece black suits for men. As the suits wore out, the men would replace the pants or vests with other material. Wearing vests of red, green or plaid and ties of black or brown in various styles, some permanently tied and others tied as the man wished, they could express their own individuality.\n\nMen either wore frock coats in black to the knees which were long and generally worn by gentlemen while the lower cast wore sack coats to the waists. They also wore hats of straw, beaver or “stove pipe.” Most of the Maryland men wore rosettes to show their Southern sympathies although two-thirds served in the Union Army and remained loyal.\n\nLarry is with a group of 90 men from various groups who take part in Union and Confederate reenactments. He told us\n\n(Continued on page 16)\n\n(Continued on page 16)\n\nhe lived in Bristol years ago when he was studying at Temple. First, he had been an historian but couldn’t get a job, decided to study law and practiced for many years. After retiring as a lawyer, Mayor Reed of Harrisburg offered him a job as historian, his first love, at the city funded National Civil War Museum in Harrisburg.\n\nHe mentioned to me some of the Civil War people whom I know, specifically,\n\nAndy Waskie, who impersonated Major General George Gordon Meade in a BCHF program several years ago. If anyone wants to look them up, he mentioned 2 web sites of interest – www.civil war dancing and www.National Civil War Museum.\n\nThe Old Court House was interesting with historic memorabilia about Judge Roger Taney who handled the Garrett Trial here and later the Dred Scott Case in St. Louis as he was a traveling judge who handled cases in many areas. It was from the balcony of this building that Delaware declared itself a state.\n\nThe former Opera House where Jenny Lind and Enrico Caruso once sang, with the stage still intact, features sales of antiques from various people in town. In the Old Library Museum, they had an interesting display of samplers and stitchery from the 18th to the 21st centuries.\n\nI toured the Rodney House and spoke with two of Caleb Rodney’s descendants. Caleb was the brother of Caesar, signer of the Declaration of Independence from Delaware. Caesar had severe facial cancer and wore a pale green scarf over his face to hide his disfigurement. Though he was ill, he rode to Philadelphia to sign the Declaration and died soon afterwards.\n\nMy great grandfather, David Landreth II, was married twice and one of his wives was a cousin of Caleb’s. When the Landreth farm was in Philadelphia from 1784 to 1845, Caleb sent up some of his slaves to work on the farm one summer. I mentioned this to his two descendants and said I would send them the family information I had. If I had known I would be meeting the Rodney descendants, I could have taken the information with me.\n\nJohn Dickinson, a wealthy farmer, was heavily influenced by the Quakers. He owned at least 59 slaves in Kent County which he freed in 1777. There was a conditional agreement which required them to serve him for a period of 21 years in exchange for food, clothing, shelter and remuneration. Then in 1785, he unconditionally freed all his slaves although their freedom was restricted by law. The law did not include privileges, such as the right to vote but in 1787 free blacks could own property.\n\nWe had a delicious lunch in the Arsenal Building where there were two rooms for dining in addition to the lawn outside and there is a Caesar Rodney Ballroom in the building. The Arsenal was erected between 1809 and 1811 as the threat of war with England became imminent. It was used to store ordnance supplies, and to house all the troops when Fort Delaware caught fire. It served as a hospital during a cholera epidemic, as a school and for other purposes and was leased as a restaurant in 1963.\n\nAnother interesting house, the Dutch House, the oldest one in town, was built in 1700 and has survived without many alterations. The women attendants all wore Dutch caps, and Volendam, Holland type of clothing.\n\nWe also enjoyed seeing the Amstel House and garden, which when built in 1738, was probably the most elegant. Governor Van Dyke lived here and in 1784 when his daughter was married, George Washington attended the wedding. There were many beautiful antiques in this house, including a gaming table, a rocking cradle and an immense fireplace reminiscent of the one in Pennsbury where a woman was cooking a chicken dinner, with vegetables, over the open fire.\n\nThe last event of the day was dancing on the lawn near the Academy Building performed by the men and women in costume whom we had seen earlier in the day. It was interesting to watch the dances as they are similar to the country and square dances that we enjoy today.\n\nIf you haven’t been to New Castle and want to refresh your memory of history, it is well worth a visit."
