        "text": "Newcastle\n\nThis charming town located on the edge of Black Hills National Forest was named after its sister community in England, Newcastle upon Tyne.\n\nThe town formed after the coal and railroad industries came to the area and was also widely known for the Cheyenne to Black Hills stagecoach route, which brought a handful of characters to the area in the late 19th century. The nearby Thunder Basin National Grassland and Black Hills provide plenty of outdoor opportunities. Access 11 individual trails available for hiking or mountain biking on the Flying V Trail system. Fish at Black Hill Pond or, in the winter months, snowmobile or cross-country ski 50 miles of groomed trails. Visit Newcastle Main Street to see historic buildings and shop locally-owned stores. You will also find the Anna Miller Museum, featuring a large collection of old fire wagons. Driving through the area, you might take the Beaver Creek Loop Tour. This scenic route provides wildlife, amazing views and stagecoach trails. At the end of the day, choose from a number of unique lodging options, including the historic Flying V Lodge."
