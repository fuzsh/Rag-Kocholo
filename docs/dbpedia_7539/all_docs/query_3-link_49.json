Families enjoy a quiet community with a low crime rate with the benefits of the major City of Pittsburgh less than an hour away where entertainment is plentiful.\n\nA full range of municipal services, the low cost of living, and excellent opportunities for quality housing in beautiful homes located in long established neighborhoods provides a most important attraction. Traditional family values, close knit families, and community pride are among the attributes of the people of New Castle."
