        "text": "The New Castle Court House was built in 1732, and served as Delaware's first court house and eventually state capitol. It was in this historic structure that the representatives of the people of Delaware voted in 1776 for independence from both Pennsylvania and Great Britian.\n\nYou can start your tour of Historic New Castle at the townâ€™s visitor center located at the New Castle Historical Society or at the New Castle Court House Museum. During your tour of the New Castle Court House Museum, you will be greeted by a guide from our partners at the Delaware Division of Historical and Cultural Affairs. Your guide will take you on a historical tour of the building, but make sure you ask them for the available passport stamps and Junior Ranger Booklets.\n\nDuring your visit of the New Castle Historical Society, you will get to explore their gift shop for souvenirs that are related to the park and the town. While you are there you can also sign up for a tour of the Historic Green, and a variety of other historical buildings. Make sure you ask them about other historical areas in town."
