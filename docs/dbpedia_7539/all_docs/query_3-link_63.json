        "text": "It is unique within Delaware and perhaps the entire United States. The Trustees have a fascinating history as old as New Castle, because the 'Common' land has existed since the days of early Dutch colonization.\n\nIn 1701, William Penn surveyed and formally recognized 1,068 acres which were already being used as a common. By the middle of that century, it became apparent that overseers were needed to protect and preserve the common lands for the benefit of all. A trust was incorporated in 1764, and a body of thirteen Trustees appointed for life terms to act as stewards of the land.\n\n​\n\nAbout thirty years ago these terms were reduced to twelve years. For over 250 years the mission has remained the same: to manage the common lands responsibly and for the benefit of the citizens of New Castle. Today, Trust income is derived primarily from property leases and investments.\n\nThere are thirteen Trustees Board members. They meet regularly on the first Tuesday of each month (except July and August) in the conference room at 807 Frenchtown Road. The Board accomplishes its work through a number of working committees.\n\nMeetings are scheduled for the first Tuesday of each month, except in July and August when no meetings are held. In September and January the meeting date may be changed to the second Tuesday of the month, depending on when Labor Day and New Year's Day fall.\n\n​\n\nThe meetings are held in the boardroom at Penn Farm, 807 Frenchtown Road, New Castle.\n\n​\n\nResidents are welcome to attend Trustee Board Meetings on a quarterly basis (the March, June, September and December meetings).\n\nIn the past, there was a \"Public Comment\" period at the end of the four (4) publicly attended Board meetings. For all future publicly attended meetings, a \"Public Comment\" period will not be included on the agenda. Questions and comments by residents about Trust business should be sent to the \"office@trusteesncc.org\" email address. Timely responses will be given directly by the appropriate Trustee committee.\n\nPlease note: The minutes for all the Board meetings are posted on the website, here.\n\n​\n\nMeetings open to the public begin at 7:00 PM and are scheduled as follows:\n\nMarch 5, 2024\n\nJune 4, 2024\n\nSeptember 3, 2024\n\nDecember 3, 2024\n\n​\n\n(Note: any changes to these dates will be posted on his website.)"
