        "text": "New Castle, city, New Castle county, northern Delaware, U.S. It is just south of Wilmington on the Delaware River, there linked to New Jersey by the twin spans of the Delaware Memorial Bridge. The original settlement, called Santhoeck, was established in 1651, when Peter Stuyvesant, the Dutch administrator, built Fort Casimir there. The settlement was seized by the Swedes in 1654 but was regained by the Dutch in 1655. It was named New Amstel and was made the Dutch capital of the southern Delaware region, but it was renamed in 1664 (probably for William Cavendish, earl and, from 1665, 1st duke of Newcastle-upon-Tyne), after its capture by the British that year. William Penn, the English Quaker, took possession of it in 1682. An early cultural centre, New Castle was the seat of the Lower Counties-on-Delaware (1704–76). On September 21, 1776, a convention of counties meeting there proclaimed a constitution and formed the state of Delaware; New Castle served briefly as state capital until it was moved to Dover in 1777. Three signers of the Declaration of Independence (George Read, George Ross, and Thomas McKean) at one time lived in New Castle.\n\nThe Immanuel Church (Episcopal; 1703, rebuilt after it burned in 1980) is a historic landmark. Other colonial landmarks include Amstel House Museum (c. 1730); Old Dutch House, perhaps the state’s oldest dwelling, built in the late 1600s and now maintained as a museum; the New Castle Court House (1732, restored to its 1804 appearance); and the Green (town square), laid out by Stuyvesant in 1655. Wilmington College was opened in 1968 in New Castle. The city has light industries. Inc. 1875. Pop. (2000) 4,862; (2010) 5,285."
