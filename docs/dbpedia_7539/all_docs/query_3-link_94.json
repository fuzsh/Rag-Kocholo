        "text": "Delaware boasts a unique colonial history. For a time, Pennsylvania claimed ownership to the three counties along the Delaware River. Yet on June 15, 1776, Delaware declared its independence from both Great Britain and Pennsylvania. Separation Day is now celebrated every year in Old New Castle, where Delawareâ€™s independence was declared.\n\n@delawaretodaymagazine\n\nSeparation Day festivities over the weekend in Old New Castle. ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ #delaware #fyp\n\nâ™¬ Vibes â€“ ZHRMusic\n\nSeparation Day is one of the longest-running traditions in the First State. This year marked the 248th anniversary of the event. Attendees celebrated with a parade through the streets of Old New Castle, colonial reenactors, live performances and a festival in New Castleâ€™s Battery Park.\n\nHereâ€™s a look at the festival and parade in photos.\n\nThe Separation Day parade kicked off at noon and included performances from both local and national marching bands. Public figures and local politicians also made appearances to give celebratory addresses. Both Gov. John Carney and Lt. Gov. Bethany Hall-Long spoke during the parade.\n\nIn celebration of the First State, a variety of local organizations planned performances and demonstrations including traditional dance, historic reenactments and more.\n\nWilmingtonâ€™s Ballet Folklorico Mexico Lindo performed traditional Mexican dance during the parade. Dancers of all ages impressed spectators and celebrated the diverse array of cultures that exists in the First State.\n\nReenactment groups from around Delaware also gave demonstrations after marching through the streets of Old New Castle, including firing off their muskets in an impressive display enjoyed by spectators of all ages.\n\nThe Separation Day parade also included historic police and fire vehicles. Four officers from Wilmingtonâ€™s Mounted Patrol unitâ€”and their Clydesdalesâ€”made an appearance.\n\nAlong with the parade, the Separation Day festival featured more live performances, a craft vendor fair, carnival rides, food trucks and historic reenactors in Old New Castle. Festivities continued throughout the day, ending with a fireworks show at dusk.\n\nSee yourself in one of these photos?
