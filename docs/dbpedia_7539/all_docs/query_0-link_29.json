        "text": "Amstel House garden at 2 East 4th Street\n\nIn my first two blog posts on New Castle (here and here), I covered much of what visitors see when they visit. In this post, I’m sharing what I’m calling secret New Castle—not exactly secrets, but sights, legends, and bits of history that visitors often miss.\n\nNew Castle began with the construction of Fort Casimir in 1651. The Dutch were the first Europeans to settle in the New Castle area, building Fort Casimir in 1651—mostly to annoy the Swedes, who had just built Fort Christina upriver at what’s now Wilmington. Fort Casimir is long gone, but you can see the site and a wayfinding sign in the park at the river end of Chestnut Street. Towns often crop up next to forts, because forts provide jobs and protection. That’s what happened in New Castle. One of New Castle’s legends is that the town was laid out by Peter Stuyvesant, Director-General of the Dutch colonies.\n\nFort Casimir marker at the corner of E 2nd Street and Chestnut Street\n\nWilliam Penn may have spent his first night on American soil in New Castle. We know that William Penn first set foot on American soil in New Castle. There’s a legend that he may have spent his first night in the house at 206 Delaware Street.\n\n206 Delaware Street, soon to be the Mercury Cafe & Tea Room and where William Penn may have spent his first night on American soil\n\nWilliam Penn created a trust that still benefits New Castle citizens today. Penn set aside 1000 acres of “common” land (roughly where New Castle airport is today) for all New Castle residents to use for things such as pasturing livestock and cutting firewood. He appointed trustees to manage the land. The Trustees of the New Castle Common still exist today.\n\nSign between East 2nd Street and Market Street\n\nOver the centuries the Trustees have sold much of the original Common land and invested elsewhere. They have used the income from their investments in a variety of ways to benefit New Castle residents. A few examples include college scholarships and construction of the New Castle Library, Goodwill Fire Company building, and the riverfront path in Battery Park. While the Trustees of the New Castle Common is a private organization, its trustees are elected by New Castle residents…and, yes, that’s confusing! The trustees continue to be paid as Penn stipulated, with one ear of corn every year.\n\nCaesar Rodney may have changed horses in New Castle during his famous ride. Caesar Rodney is famous for riding from Dover to Philadelphia to break a tie between Delaware’s other two representatives to the Continental Congress on the vote for independence. Without Rodney’s vote, the Continental Congress's vote for independence may have failed.\n\nThere are legends that Rodney made this ride through a thunderstorm. There’s also a legend that the building at 114-118 East 3rd Street was a stable at the time, and Rodney changed horses there.\n\n114-118 East 3rd Street, where Caesar Rodney may have changed horses during his famous ride\n\nNew Castle has one of America’s first takeout windows. It’s at the Rising Sun Tavern at 118 Harmony Street.\n\nRising Sun Tavern at 118 Harmony Street\n\nThe Rising Sun Tavern was built in 1773 (we now know the date on its sign is wrong). I’ve heard two stories about why the tavern has a take-out window. It may have served customers who were either too dirty or (my favorite) too drunk to be served inside. Whichever reason is true, it says a lot about life in New Castle in the 1700s!\n\nThose contraptions you see on many second-floor windows are called busybodies.\n\nTwo houses along the Strand wsith busybodies attached to second floor windowframes\n\nBenjamin Franklin saw busybodies when he visited France. He was intrigued by them and introduced them in the United States. They’re mirrors. If you’re on the second floor and someone knocks at the front door, a busybody lets you see who it is and decide whether to answer the door!\n\nThose granite structures in the Delaware River are called ice piers.\n\nIce piers in the Delaware Driver\n\nThe ice piers were built over several decades by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, starting in the late 1700s. Their purpose was to keep the busy New Castle piers navigable in wintertime. I’ve heard different stories on how they were supposed to work. One theory is that the ice piers would somehow divert ice away from New Castle piers. Another is that the ice piers would keep the river from freezing by keeping water moving around them (the same way a waterfall doesn’t freeze).\n\nThe ice piers are basically wooden boxes filled with stones and topped with granite blocks. The wood is now collapsing, and therefore so are some of the granite blocks. The ice piers are still the property of the Federal government, and there are no plans to restore them.\n\nNew Castle was once a lot hillier than it is today. In 1804 the city hired architect Benjamin Latrobe to survey the city and develop a city plan. Latrobe recommended leveling the streets to improve drainage. This left some buildings like the Dutch House below street level, while others, such as the Court House, above street level.\n\nThe Dutch House door now sits below street level\n\nThe Court House now sits above street level\n\nAt the corner of Delaware and Market Streets, you can see some grooves in the top of the Court House plaza’s retaining wall.\n\nGrooves at the edge of the Court House's retaining wall\n\nShad fishing was once a big business here, and there are tales that shad fishermen used to gather here to gossip…and sharpen their knives on the stone.\n\nThe mysterious Tile House once brought a touch of medieval Amsterdam to New Castle. The Tile House, once at 54 The Strand, is a long-demolished building that continues to fascinate local historians.\n\nA drawing of the \"Old Tyle House\" from Delaware Archives\n\nWe know that generations of people loved this building with its steep “stepped” front gable. But what fascinates historians is how little we really know about it. We don’t know when it was built—some think the date of 1687 in the “irons” is inaccurate. We’re also not sure why it was called the Tile House. The walls were built of small yellow bricks that may have looked like tiles to local residents, or the building may have had a tile roof. And we don’t know why it was demolished in 1884. It had been vacant for many years and was very dilapidated. But there are reports that dynamite was required to demolish it, suggesting that it was not deteriorated beyond repair. We do know that people mourned its loss, and that got them interested in saving other historic buildings in New Castle.\n\nOne of America’s great Gothic Revival mansions is just outside the historic district. Lesley Manor, also known as Lesley-Travers Mansion, Allen Lesley House, and Fox Lodge at Lesley Major, is at 123 West 7th Street. The photo below is from Delaware Today .\n\nLesley Manor from Delaware Today\n\nLesley Manor was built in 1855 for Allen Lesley, a Philadelphia surgeon who had roots in this region. Unfortunately the house is surrounded by trees, walls, and other houses, so it’s hard to see Lesley Manor from the street. I found the best glimpse at the intersection of West 7th Street and Deemer Place.\n\nLesley Manor as seen from the corner of West 7th Street and Deemer Place\n\nTry to get your glimpse of Lesley Manor in winter or early spring, when leaves are off the trees. Please stay off private property.\n\nWork to save New Castle’s historic buildings began in the 1920s and 1930s. In my blog post on New Castle’s essential sights I noted that New Castle was a major East Coast transportation hub in the 1700s and early 1800s. Roads were so poor that people traveled by water as much as possible, so anyone traveling from, say, Philadelphia to Baltimore would take a boat down the Delaware River to New Castle, go overland to the now-vanished town of Frenchtown on the Elk River in Maryland, then continue by boat on the Chesapeake Bay to Baltimore. When steam locomotives were invented, the road became one of America’s first railroads.\n\nPoster for the New Castle Frenchtown Railroad\n\nBut in just a few years the Chesapeake & Delaware Canal opened a few miles downriver from New Castle. Travelers and cargo could now make the whole trip by water. And soon a railroad line was built directly from Philadelphia to Wilmington and Baltimore, making it possible to make the whole trip by rail. New Castle was suddenly no longer a major transportation hub. To make matters worse, the county seat moved from New Castle to Wilmington in the 1880s. New Castle stagnated for decades. There was still some industry here, but no one had the resources to either restore New Castle’s historic buildings or replace them with modern ones.\n\nThings began to change in 1920, when Philip and Lydia Laird—related by marriage to the Duponts—bought the Read House and began restoring it.\n\nPlaque across the Strand from Read House"
