In the maps below, you can locate our urban centers: Wilmington, Dover, Newark, Elsmere, Milford, and Rehoboth Beach. The river that runs through our colony, Nanticoke River is also marked down below.\n\nMore Information\n\nThe colony covers about 2,489 square miles and is one of the smaller colonies. In some areas, Delaware is 100 miles long and 30 miles wide.\n\nDelaware's geographical features are represented on the maps to the left. Delaware's many rivers lead into the Delaware Bay, a passage to the Atlantic Ocean. The largest of the main three rivers is the Delaware River. The Mispillion and the Nanticoke River run through Delaware as well, and ports can be found at the mouths of the Delaware and the Mispillion River. They are active and were used often for trade. Our port gives Delaware a major advantage in industries such as trade."
