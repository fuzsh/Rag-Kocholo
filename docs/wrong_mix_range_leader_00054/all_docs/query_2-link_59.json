        "text": "In England and Wales, there is an agreed list of ethnic groups you can use when asking for someoneâs ethnicity. The groups are usually those used in the Census, which happens every 10 years.\n\nIf youâre in a government service team, thereâs a design pattern for asking users for equality information, including their ethnic group.\n\n1. 2021 Census\n\nThe main changes to the 2021 Census of England and Wales, compared with the previous Census, were:\n\nthe âRomaâ group was added under the âWhiteâ ethnic group\n\na write-in response was added for the âBlack Africanâ ethnic group\n\nThe ethnic groups were:\n\nAsian or Asian British\n\nIndian\n\nPakistani\n\nBangladeshi\n\nChinese\n\nAny other Asian background\n\nBlack, Black British, Caribbean or African\n\nCaribbean\n\nAfrican\n\nAny other Black, Black British, or Caribbean background\n\nMixed or multiple ethnic groups\n\nWhite and Black Caribbean\n\nWhite and Black African\n\nWhite and Asian\n\nAny other Mixed or multiple ethnic background\n\nWhite\n\nEnglish, Welsh, Scottish, Northern Irish or British\n\nIrish\n\nGypsy or Irish Traveller\n\nRoma\n\nAny other White background\n\nOther ethnic group\n\nArab\n\nAny other ethnic group\n\nIn Wales, âWelshâ is the first option in the White category.\n\n2. How the groups were chosen\n\nThe Office for National Statistics runs the Census of England and Wales every 10 years. They decide which ethnic groups to include in consultation with:\n\nusers of Census data (like government departments, local authorities, and the National Health Service)\n\npeople completing the Census, and the interest groups that represent them\n\nthe organisations that run the Censuses in Northern Ireland and Scotland\n\nIt is recognised that these ethnic groups do not represent how all people identify. People are encouraged to write in their ethnicity using their own words if they donât identify with any groups in the list.\n\nThere has been an ethnicity question in the Census since 1991. It has been updated at every new Census since then. There are separate questions in the Census about national identity, religion and language.\n\nYou can read more about:\n\nhow ONS researched and tested the Census 2021 questions on national identity, ethnic group, language and religion\n\nhow ethnicity data collection has changed over the last 50 years\n\n3. Exceptions\n\nThe Government Statistical Service (GSS) has a harmonised standard for ethnicity classification.\n\nThe ethnic groups used in the harmonised standard and the latest Census are usually the same. The harmonised standard is being reviewed and currently uses the ethnic groups from the 2011 Census.\n\nNot all departments and organisations use the standardised list, for example if:\n\nthey need data on some ethnic groups, but not others\n\nthey want their data to be consistent with data they have collected previously, which uses different ethnic groups\n\nthe small number of people surveyed in some ethnic groups means groups have to be combined to make statistics more reliable, or to protect individual identities\n\nThe dashboard of ethnic categories shows that around 20 different ethnicity classifications are used on Ethnicity facts and figures.\n\n4. Scotland and Northern Ireland\n\nThe Censuses in Scotland and Northern Ireland use different ethnicity classifications.\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\nThe ethnicity question in the 2021 Census in Northern Ireland asked people to choose from the following ethnic groups:\n\nBlack African\n\nBlack Other\n\nChinese\n\nFilipino\n\nIndian\n\nIrish Traveller\n\nMixed ethnic group\n\nRoma\n\nWhite\n\nAny other ethnic group\n\nScotland\n\nScotlandâs next Census is in 2022. The ethnic groups will be:\n\nAsian, Scottish Asian or British Asian\n\nPakistani, Scottish Pakistani or British Pakistani\n\nIndian, Scottish Indian or British Indian\n\nBangladeshi, Scottish Bangladeshi or British Bangladeshi\n\nChinese, Scottish Chinese or British Chinese\n\nOther\n\nAfrican, Scottish African or British African\n\nRespondents write in their ethnic group\n\nCaribbean or Black\n\nRespondents write in their ethnic group\n\nMixed or multiple ethnic group\n\nRespondents write in their ethnic group\n\nWhite\n\nScottish\n\nOther British\n\nIrish\n\nPolish\n\nGypsy or Traveller\n\nRoma\n\nShowman or Showwoman\n\nOther\n\nOther ethnic group\n\nArab, Scottish Arab or British Arab\n\nOther (for example, Sikh, Jewish)\n\n5. Combining data\n\nIf you need to combine data for the different countries of the UK, you can use the GSS harmonised categories for either:\n\nEngland, Wales and Scotland\n\nEngland, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland\n\nThese harmonised classifications are based on the 2011 Censuses.\n\n6. 2011 Census\n\nThe main changes to the 2011 Census of England and Wales, compared with the previous Census, were:\n\nthe Chinese ethnic group moved from the âOtherâ ethnic group (in 2001) to the âAsianâ ethnic group (in 2011)\n\nthere were no âGypsy or Irish Travellerâ or âArabâ groups listed in 2001\n\nThe ethnic groups were:\n\nAsian or Asian British\n\nIndian\n\nPakistani\n\nBangladeshi\n\nChinese\n\nAny other Asian background\n\nBlack, African, Caribbean or Black British\n\nAfrican\n\nCaribbean\n\nAny other Black, African or Caribbean background\n\nMixed or multiple ethnic groups\n\nWhite and Black Caribbean\n\nWhite and Black African\n\nWhite and Asian\n\nAny other Mixed or multiple ethnic background\n\nWhite\n\nEnglish, Welsh, Scottish, Northern Irish or British\n\nIrish\n\nGypsy or Irish Traveller\n\nAny other White background\n\nOther ethnic group\n\nArab\n\nAny other ethnic group\n\n7. 2001 Census\n\nSome data on Ethnicity facts and figures still uses the ethnic groups from the 2001 Census when recording people's ethnicity.\n\nThe ethnic groups were:\n\nAsian or Asian British\n\nIndian\n\nPakistani\n\nBangladeshi\n\nAny other Asian background\n\nBlack or Black British\n\nCaribbean\n\nAfrican\n\nAny other Black background\n\nMixed\n\nWhite and Black Caribbean\n\nWhite and Black African\n\nWhite and Asian\n\nAny other Mixed background\n\nWhite\n\nBritish\n\nIrish\n\nAny other White background\n\nChinese or other ethnic group"
