        "text": "Each of the divisions – Airbus, Airbus Helicopters and Airbus Defence and Space – leads their respective market, relying on diverse skills, advanced technologies and facilities, that can only be found in the UK, across more than 25 sites stretching across the country from Aberdeen to Portsmouth.\n\nThe UK, with its global influence in the aerospace, defence, space and security sectors, remains an important part of Airbus; much as Airbus remains an important part of the UK – with local revenues of £5.6 billion.\n\nAs a major employer in Britain, Airbus has invested significantly in levelling up its UK workforce. Airbus directly employs nearly 12,000 across its Commercial, Defence and Space and Helicopters divisions, and expects to hire a further 1,000 across the UK. Airbus indirectly supports 79,000 jobs in the UK, across the transport equipment manufacturing, business services and wholesale and retail trade sectors.\n\nIn 2022 alone, Airbus recognised the need to constantly invest in growth across the UK, spending £3.9 billion with UK suppliers. 50% of Airbus’ suppliers were SMEs, and the Company spent an average of £103,100 with micro firms (40% of average turnover).\n\nAirbus are actively working with institutions and partners to progress the UK’s net-zero and decarbonisation missions via the research and testing of our zero-emission programme, ZEROe, as well as our recently launched Wing Technology Development Centre (WTDC) for the building and testing of wings for next generation aircraft.\n\nAirbus is supporting the UK’s ambition to become a Science and Technology Superpower, spending nearly £277 million on R&D in 2022, contributing to the technological advancement of both Britain and the wider aerospace industry.\n\nThe sites at Filton and Broughton design, test and manufacture the wings for all Airbus’ A320 family, A330 and A350 commercial aircraft, directly sustaining more than 8,000 full-time jobs and hundreds of apprenticeships.\n\nA220 family wings are designed and built by Spirit AeroSystems in Belfast, Northern Ireland.\n\nBroughton has a proud tradition of aerospace manufacturing dating back 80 years, having supplied the RAF with vital aircraft during the Second World War. Employing almost 5,000 people, Broughton is a global centre of excellence for manufacturing and delivers over 500 wing sets per year for the A320 family, A330 and A350. Airbus has invested more than £2 billion in the Broughton plant over the past 10 years.\n\nCore activities at Filton, where an additional 3,000 people work, are the design, engineering and support for Airbus wings, fuel systems and landing gear systems. Teams also work on aerodynamics research, development and test facilities, including our future zero-emissions programme, ZEROe, while wings for the A400M transporter are assembled on site.\n\nAirbus Helicopters is headquartered at Oxford Airport, the UK's civil helicopter hub. We are a major supplier of helicopters to the civil, defence and air ambulance sectors in the UK. We have been present in the UK for nearly 50 years and we know how to deliver major support and services successfully; demonstrated by Puma, MFTS and NPAS programmes.\n\nLast year we started construction on our new £55m HQ for Airbus Helicopters in Oxford, which will open in 2024. It will accommodate a growing workforce, including our apprentice programme, and enable us to deliver increased levels of efficiency at the same time as reducing our environmental footprint.\n\nWe are delighted to be down-selected for UK MOD’s New Medium Helicopter competition. Our new investment in Broughton would see helicopters built in and exported from the UK to the world.\n\nAirbus’ Filton site, in addition to its work on commercial aircraft, is also responsible for wing assembly and equipping all A400M multi-role airlifters, including the RAF A400M Atlas.\n\nIn Newport, South Wales, Airbus specialises in secure connectivity, cyber solutions and the security of critical infrastructure in the UK, serving as a key partner to the UK government and NATO-led information infrastructure programmes. One notable product, a powerful encryption device named Ectocryp, has been dubbed the “Enigma for the 21st century.”\n\nAirbus Farnborough site is home to Zephyr, the world’s leading solar-electric, stratospheric Unmanned Aerial System (UAS). Designed and developed in the UK, Zephyr is a world-record breaking aircraft that can provide see, sense and connect capabilities which have the potential to revolutionise defence, humanitarian and environmental missions all over the world."
