        "text": "OPM highlights key actions taken to recruit, hire, and train AI and AI-related talent into the federal government. OPMâs efforts support the AI in Government Act of 2020 and President Bidenâs landmark Executive Order on Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy AI.\n\nOPM issued guidance advising agencies to provide enhanced support to federal workers seeking safety and recovering from domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, stalking, and other related forms of abuse or harassment, including technological abuse.\n\nOPM announced new actions to further promote the integrity of the Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) Program. In a Benefits Administration Letter (BAL), OPM outlined requirements for federal agencies and carriers regarding new enrollment actions that will ensure comprehensive verification and review of family member eligibility.\n\nOPM announced that Director Kiran Ahuja will depart from her role in the next several weeks. Ahuja, the longest serving director in more than ten years, leaves a lasting legacy of rebuilding the OPM workforce, championing federal workers, and supporting federal agencies. Ahuja was confirmed as the first South Asian and first Asian American woman to lead the agency.\n\nOPM issued a final rule on the Pathways Programs designed to significantly expand opportunities for early career talent in the federal government. The final rule is one of the most significant actions the federal government has taken since the programâs inception 14 years ago."
