However, the American Revolutionary War continued until the British General Cornwallis surrendered to General George Washington on October 19, 1781. Aside from a break in relations over the War of 1812, and strains over the possibility of British recognition of the Confederacy during the Civil War, the United States and the United Kingdom have enjoyed generally cordial and consistent relations since American independence."
