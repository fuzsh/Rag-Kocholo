That is NOT what Americans should tolerate or allow to happen. The free world loves you and supports you. Look inside your souls and remember that you stand for what so many billions of people want for their countries. Please continue to be that beacon of hope and light.\n\nFind out how much you could be saving:\n\nWe launched a calculator on Invest.gov/Savings that’ll allow you to view how my Administration’s actions have provided hardworking American families with a little more breathing room.\n\nHelp is available.\n\nSince the Biden-Harris Administration launched the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline, we have answered over 10 million calls, texts, and chats. To anyone struggling with mental health challenges – know that you are not alone. Help is available."
