Assasinations Had begun in Earnest

Hamaguchi Osachi was assassinated by the Akikou-Sha due to several “failed” deals such as the London Naval Treaty in 1930.

Political figures and those who sided with them were common targets by these Ultranationalist groups.

Leaving League of Nations

Ceasefire but not for long

Political scandal Teijin Stocks

The Teijin incident a political scandal that involved many investors investing in a company that immediately after skyrocketed in stocks. This led to extremist ultranationalist groups to call into question the validity of these investments and that the market was manipulated. The blamed then Prime minister Saito and his cabinet for this market manipulation. When faced with corruption charges he dissolved the government administration and ran.

Death Across the political landscape

Major political incident occurred relatively frequently however on this one there where over 1500 army troops marched into central Tokyo and began to kill high ranking politicians because of the belief that many upper government officials were corrupt. This incident could have been much bloodier if Emperor Hirohito had not stepped in himself to tell the army it needed to stop.
