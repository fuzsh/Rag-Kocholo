        "text": "We drove all day right through Manitoba and into Ontario. As the sun was beginning to set, we arrived at Aaron Provincial Park. This is an adorable little park!\n\nAnd one of the first signs we saw is one that made us the happiest....\"No excessive noise at any time\".\n\nHooray! We will be able to sleep tonight and enjoy the park!\n\nIt was after hours and there was no staff on site but we are starting to get used to this now. It was nice to be able to pick our own site instead of being assigned one.\n\nThey had a Pepsi machine outside the office....I suppose we could forgive them this one little faux pas. Now if it were a Coke machine we would be all set. :)\n\nThere was a large reminder that we were in bear country. However, we didn't see any signs of any except on this sign.\n\nThe roads were nice with trees everywhere. There weren't many people and it was quiet but it wasn't far from the high way so you could still hear some traffic. All in all though, it wasn't too bad and was a welcome change from the previous park we had been in.\n\nThere were plenty of pretty plants and flowers all around.\n\nThe camp sites were big and private and the whole place was spotless.\n\nWe chose campsite 18 because it best fit the RV and tents. The electrical units were shared between two campsites a piece. If I had been here with just a tent and no RV I would have chosen one of a couple of other sites - 35 (which is a prime spot down by the beach), 32, or a real nice one is number 13 (which we almost chose but there was no electricity on it).\n\nThe bathrooms were small but clean.\n\nThe most remarkable thing about the bathrooms was that their lights were on a timer. You just turned the knob to what you figured would be a reasonable amount of time you would need the light and then you could leave without thinking about it and it will turn itself off. Now that is a great idea and would be wonderful to see in other parks.\n\nOutside the bathroom was a huge tower. I am guessing that it was a cell tower of some sort because the cell phone reception here was quite good. If it's not that then I have no idea what the tower was for.\n\nAnother interesting thing they had was a rake and shovel that you could borrow if you needed one.\n\nThis campground was super clean and had what looked to be brand new garbage bins and recycling bins nearby.\n\nThe hiking trails are very woodsy and the mosquitoes were out in full force which was surprising considering there usually aren't so many in August. But then again we were in the thick woods of northern Ontario so it is probably not so uncommon the farther north you go into the bush.\n\nTo get to the beach you have to go down a flight of steps.\n\nBut once you are down there it opens up into a nice sandy beach area and looks like a great place to swim.\n\nI didn't go in swimming myself but at least my dog can vouch for the water being nice to swim in, even if he did only go into the water on the outside of the bouy lines.\n\nDown by the beach is a huge sports field and a covered picnic area along with a playground set for the kids.The field is huge and this picture does not do it justice since there was a whole lot more to it behind me that you don't see from this camera angle.\n\nEven the change room down at the beach had a rake you could use if you needed one. You definitely knew that this park was very well taken care of. It showed in every part of the park.\n\nWe only got to stay one night here, but I would have gladly stayed more. It may not have all the extra activities that some fancier parks have like zip lining or horse back riding or such. But those things aren't really camping anyways. If you are looking for true blue camping then this place is a hidden gem that I would recommend to anyone."
