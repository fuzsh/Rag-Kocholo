This permit includes entry for the vehicle and passengers for one day.\n\nIf available, purchase your pass ahead of time. You can purchase permits up to five days before arrival at several participating parks. For all other parks, permits are available as first come first serve upon arrival at the gatehouse or at a pay and display machine.\n\nIf you are a seasonal permit holder, reserve your day use spot ahead of time to avoid disappointment. It's always a good idea to make camping reservations in advance.\n\nPlan a mid-week visit\n\nOverall, weekends are much busier than weekdays at Ontario Parks, especially during the beginning of the fall colour season and over the Thanksgiving long weekend.\n\nBeat the crowds and book your visit during the week and later in the season. You’ll be rewarded with what’s known as the ‘golden encore’, when beech, birch and poplar trees turn a brilliant gold and amber after the first peak of maple.\n\nVisitor etiquette #ForTheLoveOfParks\n\nProtecting at-risk species and ecological integrity is a core value of Ontario Parks. There are some simple things you can do to help keep Ontario’s parks healthy.\n\nClean footwear and equipment prevent the spread of invasive species\n\nStaying on trails and boardwalks and a zero-litter policy helps reduce the destruction of sensitive habitats\n\nReducing light pollution keeps the skies clean and dark for great stargazing and night sky viewing\n\nStay safe in Ontario Parks\n\nBeing prepared with the right equipment, supplies and safety gear will not only determine the success of your outdoor adventure, but it may even save a life. Here are some suggestions of what to bring hiking:\n\nA good pair of hiking shoes or boots\n\nPlenty of water & snacks\n\nMap of the area & a compass\n\nA flashlight\n\nFirst aid kit that includes sunscreen, matches & a whistle\n\nWeather-appropriate clothing, moisture-wicking fabric & layers are best\n\nSunglasses\n\nComfortable backpack\n\nAlways ensure that someone knows where you are hiking or camping and consider also leaving a copy of your site or route in your car. If there is an emergency, help will find you."
