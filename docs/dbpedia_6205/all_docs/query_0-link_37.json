        "text": "Name, age, sex Date Type Location Description John Woods, 60, male July 29, 2024 Wild Shamattawa First Nation, Manitoba The 60-year-old who went missing in a northeastern Manitoba First Nation, Canada, is believed to have been killed by a bear, RCMP say, a week after police responded to a bear attack that left another person in the area injured. It is so far undetermined if the attack was initiated by a black or a brown bear, or even a polar bear, as the latter has been seen in this area before, and descend into land every July when the Hudson Bay ice breaks up.[7][8] Patrice Miller, 71, female November 8, 2023 Wild Downieville, California Sheriff's deputies found Miller's remains during a welfare check. There were signs that a bear had entered the house and mauled the body, but initially, the Sierra County Sheriff's Office thought this had happened after Miller's death. However, an autopsy confirmed the bear had killed Miller. The male bear was trapped and killed, and DNA testing confirmed it was the bear responsible. According to the California Department of Fish and Wildlife, Miller's death is the first confirmed fatal attack by a black bear in California.[9][10][11] Steven Jackson, 66, male June 16, 2023 Wild Groom Creek, Arizona The victim was sitting in a chair outside of his campsite when an adult male black bear attacked him.
