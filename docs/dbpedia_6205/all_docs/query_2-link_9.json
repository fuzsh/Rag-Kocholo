        "text": "City in Ontario, Canada\n\nDryden is the second-largest city in the Kenora District of Northwestern Ontario, Canada, located on Wabigoon Lake. It is the least populous community in Ontario incorporated as a city.[3] The City of Dryden had a population of 7,749 and its population centre (urban area) had a population of 5,586 in 2016.[1][4]\n\nDryden was incorporated as a town in 1910 and as a city in 1998. The main industries in Dryden include manufacturing (particularly pulp and paper), renewable energy (including bioenergy and solar energy), and service. Dryden is located on Ontario's Highway 17, which forms part of the Trans-Canada Highway. It is situated halfway between the larger cities of Winnipeg and Thunder Bay.\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nBefore settlement by Europeans, the Dryden area was inhabited by the Anishinaabe. They used the shore by the Wabigoon River as a camping site, calling it Paawidigong (\"the place of rapids\" in Ojibwe).[5] The settlement was founded as an agricultural community by John Dryden, Ontario's Minister of Agriculture in 1895. While his train was stopped at what was then known as Barclay Tank to re-water, he noticed clover growing and decided to found an experimental farm the following year. The farm's success brought settlers from southern Ontario and the community came to be known as New Prospect. In 1886, gold was discovered near the area, also attracting people. In 1897, the community was renamed to Dryden to honour the minister of agriculture. It incorporated as a town in 1910 and as a city in 1998 after merging with the neighbouring township of Barclay.[5][6][7][8]\n\nOne of the earliest industries in the area was pulp and paper. A paper mill was built in the town in 1910 because of the abundance of wood suitable for kraft pulping as well as energy from the Wabigoon River. The town came into national consciousness because of mercury contamination. In the 1970s, it became known that the Dryden pulp and paper operations discharged ten tons of mercury directly into the Wabagoon River over a span of eight years. The mercury caused persistent environmental damage, poisoned river systems and lakes, and led to members of the Grassy Narrows community suffering severe mercury poisoning known as Minamata disease.[6][9][10][11][12]\n\nThe town was also the site of the March 10, 1989 crash of Air Ontario Flight 1363 from Thunder Bay to Winnipeg, which killed 24 people.[13]\n\nGeography\n\n[edit]\n\nDryden is located on the Wabigoon River and Wabigoon Lake in northwestern Ontario. It borders Thunder Lake and Aaron Provincial Park on the east, and the smaller Milanese's Lakes are also located within the city. Dryden is located 340 kilometres (210 miles) northwest of Thunder Bay. Nearby communities include Wabigoon, Vermilion Bay, Kenora, and Sioux Lookout. Dryden is also near the Eagle Lake First Nation.[14][15]\n\nAlong with most of the rest of Ontario west of 90° West, Dryden is in the Central Time Zone and observes daylight saving time.[14][16]\n\nClimate\n\n[edit]\n\nDryden experiences a humid continental climate (Dfb) with short, warm summers, and long, cold winters. The highest temperature ever recorded in Dryden was 39.4 °C (103 °F) on 11 July 1936. The coldest temperature ever recorded was −46.7 °C (−52 °F) on 11 February 1914.[17] Compared to the rest of the province, the annual temperature range is wider and precipitation is more concentrated in the summer.[18]\n\nDemographics\n\n[edit]\n\nHistorical populationsYearPop.±%1901140— 1911715+410.7%19211,019+42.5%19311,326+30.1%19411,641+23.8%19512,627+60.1%19615,728+118.0%19716,939+21.1%19816,640−4.3%19916,505−2.0%19966,711+3.2%20018,198+22.2%20068,195−0.0%20117,617−7.1%20167,749+1.7%20217,388−4.7%Population figures for 2001 onwards are for the amalgamated City of Dryden.
