        "meta_description": "Take time out to sample the outdoor pleasures and attractive surroundings of Aaron&nbsp;Park. Whether you are just passing by or staying for a while, Aaron Park offers camping convenience and active outdoor adventure.\nHike through the white cedar and aspen forest, splash in the waves of Thunder Lake or picnic on the grass and listen to the cheerful trill of a warbler. Whatever pleasures you seek, get the most out of summer fun at Aaron Park.\nThunder Lake is a distinctive reminder of the ancient glaciers that covered Ontario thousands of years ago. As these massive moving fields of ice shifted and melted, they left behind a huge lake called Agassiz. Over the years Agassiz evaporated creating hundreds of smaller lakes.\nFringing Thunder Lake are mixed forests typical of the boreal region. Stroll through woods of jack pine, aspen, white cedar and balsam. A mixed bouquet of wildflowers, berries, and shrubs add colour to the forest floor. Living amid the trees are large animals such as moose, deer, and black bear.\nBe on the lookout for an impressive number of nesting birds. The cheerful songs of warblers and robins blend with the characteristic knock of the pileated woodpecker. Ravens fly high above and ring-necked ducks make their home on the lake. In the&nbsp;late afternoon or early evening, the haunting call of the loon provides background music for tall tales around the campfire.\nEnjoy the summer pleasures of swimming and boating in the warm waters of Thunder Lake, hiking the tree-lined trails and picnicking by the shore with friends and family.\nTwo natural sand beaches are good places to begin your adventure. Take the children to the beach near the picnic grounds where the clean, shallow water is perfect for the whole family. Swim, build sand castles, have lunch at the picnic area or stretch out under the clear summer sky for a relaxing afternoon by the water's edge. The picnic area comes complete with tables, toilets and a large shelter which can be reserved for group get-togethers.\nTake a leisurely stroll through Aaron's forest. Pick up self-guiding trail brochures at the park office for background information on the sights and sounds of nature. As you wind your way through the stands of aspen and white cedar, notice the interesting rock formations that lie in open areas. The exposed bedrock, jutting up from the earth in layers, is a visible reminder of the forces of glacial activity.\nFind hours of boating pleasure on Thunder Lake where motorboats, sailboats, and canoes offer different choices for fun on the water. Launch your boat at the ramp at the north end of the park and set sail, cruise the waves or spend a few hours paddling along the lakeshore. Enjoy opportunities for nature viewing, or cast a line for lake trout, walleye, northern pike and smallmouth bass.\nFor an extended canoe trip along the series of connecting waterways, use Aaron Provincial Park as your starting point. Ask park staff for information on several major canoe routes in the area.\nPlan to stay overnight at one of almost 100 campsites. Electrical hookups are available at 39 of them and all sites are suitable for tents or trailers. Choose a private, wooded site or spread out in a spacious, open area. Picnic tables and fireplaces are provided at each site and a central comfort station with toilets, showers and laundry facilities makes you feel at home. Take advantage of the group camping area by phoning the park office well ahead of the time you plan to come. Come to the park in winter for cold-weather fun. Cross-country ski along snow-capped trails, snowshoe through the peaceful white fields or even enjoy a winter picnic - the pleasures of Aaron are available year-round.\nPark Class:&nbsp;Recreation\nPark Size:&nbsp;117 ha\nCamping Dates:&nbsp;Mid May - Mid October\nServices &amp; Activities: Showers, flush toilets, laundromat, swimming, boat launch, natural/cultural programs, nature/walking trails\nRentals:&nbsp;PFDs, canoes, picnic shelters\nAaron Provincial Park is located on the Trans-Canada Highway east of Dryden.
