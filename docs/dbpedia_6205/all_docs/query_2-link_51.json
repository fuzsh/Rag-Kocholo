        "text": "The \"profit carrot\" - along with the oft-overlooked \"loss stick\" - are what motivate for-profit/ privately-funded developers to utilize resources more efficiently than non-profit/ publicly-funded ones. From the piece: \"Affordable housing is a fitting subject to test the theory, as it can be divided fairly neatly into opposing categories, public and private. A privately owned apartment building financed with funds from a privately owned institution can be as affordable to tenants as a project financed with government loans, grants, and subsidies, but the former will not typically be counted as progress towards an affordable housing goal. Why not? Because it won’t be the scene of a ribbon-cutting or ground-breaking ceremony, or provide a naming opportunity for a politician, living or dead. Does the rule that you get more of something if you subsidize it apply equally to the public and private sectors? No, because of the countervailing principle known as 'the Bureaucratic Rule of Two.' Formulated by the late economist Thomas Borcherding, this theory concluded empirically that 'removal of an activity from the private to the public sector will double its unit costs of production.'” https://lnkd.in/e3z99n3x\n\nThis is definitely a step in the right direction and the sky is the limit with the potential good that can come out of this. With the Cities likely being the operator of the Middle Income Housing, Hopefully when implemented they identify a way to streamline the administration/income verification, an annual verification would be laborious and pull city resources from an already constrained supply. I'm hoping when these projects are rolled out, they provide a path to ownership and they don't penalize applicants if their income rises above certain thresholds. In doing so, this housing can become an opportunity and stimulus for economic growth rather than a true subsidy and future economic constraint on already constrained municipal budgets. A mutual partnership between the future residents and the City for repairs and maintenance could be huge for creating an economically equitable and sustainable relationship between Landlord and Tenant/Owner, and if \"rent controlled middle income units\" generate \"profit\" this can be reinvested into not only property maintenance but devoted to creating more middle income housing in the City.\n\n~What the Federal Budget means for Perth property~ Federal Treasurer Jim Chalmers handed down his budget this week, with a clear focus on cost-of-living measures and property in the face of a challenging economic climate. A shortfall in housing supply, resulting in mounting pressures on the market was something the government was keen to address. A key target of the 2024-25 Budget is to build 1.2 million new, well-located homes over the next five years, to support our growing population and make it easier for Australians to buy or rent a home. The budget has also allocated an extra $1 billion for states and territories to use for the Housing Support Program. This will be spent on essential infrastructure such as water, power, sewerage and roads, allowing more new housing to be built, and is in addition to the $500 million the government has already committed. An additional $1.9 billion was earmarked for the Housing Australia Future Fund and the National Housing Accord, in the form of concessional loans to charities and community housing providers to support the delivery of new social and affordable homes, and $423 million to support social housing and homelessness services. And for local buyers and investors, the tax cuts beginning in the 2024-25 financial year should mean a boost to their borrowing power, helping them purchase the property they want, sooner. So, what does all this mean for Perth property? At CY, we believe the impact of the budget will be positive – it should boost investment and construction and get more people back into the market.

This has been a HUGE point of contention for residents in the unincorporated areas of Alachua County with utility services provided by GRU. Over the years, as the City “needed” more money to fund their pet projects, the City Commission would vote to increase utility rates levied by GRU rather than increasing taxes on their city residents, effectively fleecing non-residents through their utility bills so they could then transfer those funds into the City coffers to run their government. At its core, this is tantamount to taxation without representation. County residents had no input into the GRU rate structure and no ability to vote commissioners onto or off of the City Commission as a result. The Alachua County Board of County Commissioners miserably failed their constituents by refusing to engage the City Commission on this issue…I mean, why would they? A large portion of elected county commissioners were previously Gainesville City Commissioners at one point anyway, including some current elected commissioners on both boards. This was one of the primary reasons, in addition to GRU’s spiraling debt and exponentially expanding utility rates, that the State had to step in and create an independent governing board for the city owned utility which took the ability to write blank checks away from the City Commission…a move which my opponent, Anna Prizzia, opposed! NOW that the City had their keys to the piggy bank taken away, they are warning NPOs and NGOs who relied on city funds to seek support elsewhere. Unlike your current representative, Anna Prizzia, as your next County Commissioner I will not shy away from engaging my counterparts in the City of Gainesville and the new governing board of GRU to ensure that county residents who rely on GRU utility services have a voice and a seat at the table, and no longer fall victim to having their hard earned income stolen to provide services they themselves would not be entitled to receive.

It is the Mixed Income Market Initiative issued through the NYC Department of Housing Preservation & Development as an RFEI (Request for Expression of Interest) due February 15th! Per the RFEI, HPD’s goal is to support innovative financing models that efficiently use public resources and do not require Low Income Housing Tax Credits (“LIHTC”), thereby limiting the use of constrained resources, to create new affordable housing. It is HPD’s hope that this RFEI will help advance the City’s Fair Housing goals by generating proposals in Limited Affordability Areas (LAAs). Qualified respondents may be for-profit, non-profit, or joint venture entities that demonstrate the experience and capacity to implement mixed income projects on private sites within New York City. The RFEI and other docs are at the bottom of the article linked here. Let us know if #TurnerNewYork can help!

Janet Mills proposed creating a $5 million fund to help residents of manufactured home parks purchase their communities when they go up for sale, as part of proposed state budget changes. The fund will help to protect residents from being pushed out of their homes or having their rents increase to unaffordable levels when a park changes ownership. CDI’s New England Resident-Owned Communities (NEROC) Program, in partnership with Genesis Community Loan Fund, has been in talks with the Governor’s Office for several weeks to advocate for these funds, including CDI's Executive Director Pam Zagorski who will be testifying on Monday, on behalf of NEROC, to support the budget allocation. Thanks to Maine's new Offer to Purchase Law, since December, residents of four mobile home parks in Maine – totaling more than 1,000 households – have been notified by their park’s owner of an intent to sell, according to the Governor's office. CDI’s NEROC Program’s advocacy helped organize residents and legislators to create the Offer to Purchase law that went into effect in October 2023. Under the Offer to Purchase law, once residents learn of the park owner's intent to sell, they have 60 days to make a purchase offer and 90 day to secure financing after the signing of the purchase and sale agreement. Gov. Mills' proposed fund will provide low or no-interest financing to entities, such as resident cooperatives, to complement other financing options to support mobile home park purchases in Maine.

Federal assistance has expired, but residents still struggle to pay their bills. Despite our efforts to contain rent increases, we face a massive backlog of unpaid rent. Housing courts are overwhelmed, stalling eviction cases. With most residents who are subject to eviction typically owing up to a year’s worth of rent, we are consistently running on a deficit. On top of all this, costs have skyrocketed. Property tax and insurance have increased by 30 percent a year in some areas. Overall maintenance and capital improvement costs are soaring. And some previously minor cost categories—such as security—are growing exponentially. Financial losses and cash-flow problems make it harder for nonprofit housing developers to obtain financing, maintain properties, and support a healthy portfolio that attracts investors and residents.\""
