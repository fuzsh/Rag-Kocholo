The property expanded from its original 816 acres to 872 acres through additional outparcel acquisitions. Development of the park began in 1996, with the most recent phase being completed in 2008 - the construction of the Sunset Cove Amphitheater. Financing for the construction of this park was established through grants, impact fees, ad valorem funding, bond proceeds and the sale of 52 acres of surplus land to the School Board.\n\nOriginally named South County Regional Park, the park was renamed Burt Aaronson South County Regional Park on November 20, 2012. Burt Aaronson was a Palm Beach County Commissioner serving District 5 from 1992 to 2012. Aaronson established and aided in the success of countless projects throughout the county. He founded the Palm Beach County International Film Festival, was actively involved in promoting the Special Olympics and the Club Managers Association of America Therapeutic Recreation Complex, installed illuminated street signs throughout District 5 to ensure the safety of the residents, and advocated for the wide variety of recreational and cultural amenities found throughout the park. Aaronson originally ran for office on a platform of environmental improvement and was instrumental in the county not moving forward with the Site One landfill."
