        "text": "Styled Shoot at Silent Lake Provincial Park\n\nSo thrilled to have this throwback summer shoot featured in the online wedding resource, Wandering Weddings. As part of their latest publication on elopements üôèüèª‚ù§Ô∏è\n\nFrom Silent Lake‚Äôs peaceful atmosphere to the adventurous team who put this together, what a pleasure it was to be part of it all.\n\nFull feature here:\n\nhttps://wanderingweddings.com/elopement-planner/\n\n_______________________\n\nVideographer‚Äôs Note:\n\nThis was one of my first video shoots using the Leica camera system. I do remember needing to get used to the menu system and body ergonomics, but the focus pulling and camera movement do remain the same throughout the vast options of mirrorless bodies. Not to mention a principal understanding of light and composition. But someone did ask me what the difference is when shooting with such an uncommon video camera.\n\nI answered saying the video quality is better than my old cameras but still similar to other, more accessible, camera lines. So why go out of the way?\n\nA job can be done with any combination of different tools. A painter with a specific brand of easel, an illustrator with specific brushes, or a writer and a specific notepad. And much like a healthy relationship, emotional maturity is in choosing the one that best fits their current needs and future goals.\n\nIt‚Äôs hard to measure what brings you the most emotional satisfaction, but when catching those memories, it just clicks ;)\n\n_____________________\n\nTEAM"
