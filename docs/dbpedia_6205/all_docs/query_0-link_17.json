        "text": "If you’re one of the millions of Ontario residents who enjoy camping at provincial parks, the maximum time you can book a site at certain major parks is going to be noticeably cut in an effort to increase turnover.\n\nAccording to a statement posted on the Ontario Parks website Monday morning, the move is being done in response to surging demand for reservations in recent years.\n\n“We’ve heard from countless visitors how frustrating it can be to miss out on a summer camping reservation,” the statement said.\n\nRELATED: Ontario Parks report reservations for camp sites have doubled from 2020\n\nIt noted bookings jumped to 6.6 million reserved campsite nights in 2021 from 4.3 million in 2014.\n\n“We want to ensure that more Ontarians can enjoy campground campsites at some of our more popular parks during our busy summer season.”\n\nBetween July 1 and the Saturday of the Labour Day weekend, the following parks will have a seven-day maximum stay limit:\n\nAlgonquin Provincial Park\n\nBon Echo Provincial Park\n\nKillbear Provincial Park\n\nPinery Provincial Park\n\nSandbanks Provincial Park\n\nMost of the other Ontario parks will have a 14-day maximum stay limit except for the following locations where you’ll be able to stay for the current 23-day maximum:\n\nAaron Provincial Park\n\nArrow Lake Provincial Park\n\nBronte Creek Provincial Park\n\nCaliper Lake Provincial Park\n\nFerris Provincial Park\n\nKakabeka Falls Provincial Park\n\nMacLeod Provincial Park\n\nMissinaibi Provincial Park\n\nOjibway Provincial Park\n\nPakwash Provincial Park\n\nSandbar Lake Provincial Park\n\nSilver Falls Provincial Park\n\nSioux Narrows Provincial Park\n\nVoyageur Provincial Park\n\nWakami Lake Provincial Park\n\nWhite Lake Provincial Park\n\n“We understand that this change may be disappointing to those who usually enjoy camping for longer periods of time,” the statement added.\n\nOntario Parks officials encouraged people in search of extended camping stays to consider switching to one of the parks with a 23-day limit, road-tripping among multiple parks or booking outside of the July 1 to the Saturday of Labour Day weekend peak period.\n\nStaff said the change in policy doesn’t apply to backcountry camping or roofed accommodations. Also, the seven- and 14-day camping stay limit doesn’t apply outside of the peak period.\n\nThe statement said the changes will take effect when bookings for the 2023 season open in February.\n\nRELATED: You can now borrow an Ontario Parks pass from the Toronto Public Library\n\nOn Twitter, the policy change prompted users to express their objections.\n\n“This is only going to create more congestion and confusion in the parks as campers move from site to site in seven-day increments. This does nothing really to increase your odds of getting a campsite,” Caleb Haveman tweeted.\n\n“Fourteen-day maximum, I can understand. But seven days? You can’t even let people plan for a weekend-to-weekend trip,” Andrew Sturrock wrote.\n\nHowever, others welcomed the new caps.\n\n“Thank you! Tired of not getting bookings because people over-reserve then cancel when it’s last minute for others,” Evelyn Perdue wrote.\n\n“Great news… will reduce the need for cancellations and make it fairer for people who cannot or will not pay cancellation fees in order to get sites they want,” user @Charcoal_canoes tweeted.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/CalebHaveman/status/1582021544108519424?s=20&t=qEW1ymY1vCdvmsZbByrfCA\n\nhttps://twitter.com/Charcoal_canoes/status/1582015605447659521?s=20&t=qEW1ymY1vCdvmsZbByrfCA"
