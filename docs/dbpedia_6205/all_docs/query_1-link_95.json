        "text": "I spent last summer camping with an 18-foot trailer and a 90-pound German Shepherd Dog named Milo. Looking out at the mounds of snow in my backyard, I‚Äôm longing for some summer camping. And since you can reserve campsites in Ontario Provincial Parks five months in advance, it is time to start booking sites. I want to return to the best Ontario provincial parks for camping that I visited last summer.\n\nAs I was scrolling through last summer‚Äôs blog posts, I realized that I was happy in every single place, even the ones that were less than perfect. I‚Äôm mostly just happy to be camping. But some places were nicer than others and so here are my reviews of the Ontario provincial park campgrounds that I stayed in last summer:\n\nAaron Provincial Park, Ontario, Canada\n\nBalsam Lake Provincial Park: A good place for human contact (no ghosts)\n\nLots of sites (not all of them but lots of them) at Balsam Lake are just parking places in a big field. If you want to stay here, book early and look closely at the pictures of your potential campsite to make sure it is a place you really want to be.\n\nCaliper Lake Provincial Park: Needs hobbits\n\nCaliper Lake Provincial Park: Quick notes on the campground\n\nGrundy Lake Provincial Park, Ontario, Canada\n\nI was leery when I arrived because my site was in a campground called ‚ÄúTrailer,‚Äù but it was gorgeous, so don‚Äôt be put off by the name.\n\nSwan Lake Trail (at Grundy)\n\nKakabeka Falls Provincial Park: Great for people, stinky for dogs\n\nKillbear Provincial Park\n\nLookout Point Trail at Killbear Provincial Park\n\nThe off-leash dog beach is fabulous at Killbear\n\nMacGregor Point Provincial Park: Beautiful sunsets over Lake Huron\n\nMacGregor Point Provincial Park: Yurts and how to say ‚ÄúHi‚Äù to Milo\n\nMississagi Provincial Park, Ontario, Canada: Here be dragons\n\nWhen I was at Mississagi, it was wild and empty. üòÄ\n\nThe Beach at Pancake Bay Provincial Park, Ontario, Canada\n\nPancake Bay has a super dog beach.\n\nRainbow Falls Provincial Park, Ontario, Canada\n\nWhite Lake Provincial Park, Ontario: Home away from home\n\nHappy Camping Friends!\n\nThe campground at Caliper Lake Provincial Park was small and intimate, but better suited for tents than for RVs.\n\nThe electrical, pull through sites are smaller than most I‚Äôve seen and don‚Äôt give a camper any sense of seclusion. For example, my breakfast view was dominated by my neighbour‚Äôs red Dodge Ram pickup. They‚Äôre good looking trucks.\n\nIf I come back, I‚Äôll aim for sites 9, 17, 19, or 21. They have lots of shade, and given that my camper door opens on the passenger side of the vehicle, they offer pretty good privacy. The pads are a bit rough and not particularly level, but they‚Äôre manageable.\n\nIf you need a pull through site and can forego electricity, then try to get site 68 or 69. Those sites seem a bit bigger and are surrounded by trees.\n\nAnd if you‚Äôre tenting, then you‚Äôre in car camping heaven. Seriously, there are some sites tucked right in beside the lake and you‚Äôll be sleeping closer to your canoe than your car.\n\nI enjoyed my time at Caliper Lake, but mostly because I liked the lake and the trails, and the other campers were quiet.\n\nI lived in North Carolina for six years, and while I was there, I dated a forester. He was cute, and a kind man, but (not and) was a bottomless well of tree trivia. I guess that my back porch offered a view of about five kinds of oak trees, as well as cedars, spruce, and pines and he was keen on teaching me all about these trees:\n\n‚ÄúCarla, what kind of tree is this one here? And this one? And that one?‚Äù\n\nThe trouble was that although my interest in the forester was high, my interest in the forest was low. To amuse myself, I developed my own tree taxonomy:\n\nWhat kind of tree is this one?\n\nChristmas tree.\n\nWhat kind of tree is that one?\n\nNot-Christmas tree.\n\nThings didn‚Äôt work out with the forester.\n\nAs I was hiking along Caliper Lake Provincial Park‚Äòs Nature Trail, I realised that I‚Äôd developed another binary taxonomic system, one didn‚Äôt involve passive aggressively needling a boyfriend. You see, I saw a spot and thought, ‚Äúthat spot there, would be a perfect place to have a second breakfast.‚Äù At that moment I realised that there were Elf forests and there were Hobbit forests and that I was in a Hobbit forest. What made it a Hobbit forest was the abundance of nooks and crannies ready-made for naps and picnics.\n\nThis second breakfast spot was a cosy cubby, nestled beside a boulder and blanketed with thick, soft, dark green moss. The sun shone through the leaves of a Not-Christmas tree, creating a dappled shade that promised good napping after breakfast.\n\nThis forest has trails winding through a thick understory. If you explore the Nature Trail, you‚Äôll clamber over slippery rocks and scramble up a couple of steep hills, so wear good shoes. And bring a breakfast or two."
