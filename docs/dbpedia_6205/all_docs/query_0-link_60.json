        "text": "Biking\n\nThe Old Railway Bike Trail between Rock Lake and Mew Lake Campgrounds was extended in 2011. The extension adds 6.2 km of bike trail that runs west from Mew Lake Campground to the Track and Tower Trail. You can now plan a combined adventure by biking to the most westerly end of the bike trail and then hiking up the “Tower” portion of the Track and Tower Trail to take in a premier vista of Algonquin Provincial Park. The full bike trail is now 16.2 km in length and is accessible from Rock & Raccoon Lake, Pog Lake, Mew Lake Campgrounds. This leisurely trail runs along the abandoned rail bed of the historic Ottawa, Arnprior, and Parry Sound Railway built across the park in 1895. The trail has several interpretive panels along the route which explain Algonquin’s history.\n\nBirding\n\nMore than 260 bird species have been recorded in the Park. Many southern and overseas birders make special trips to Algonquin just to see northern specialties such as the Gray Jay and the Spruce Grouse, not to mention the rich variety of warblers or Algonquin’s most famous bird of all—the Common Loon, found nesting on just about every lake.\n\nBoating\n\nOutboard motors are limited to 20 hp on Rock Lake. A boat launch is located at the Rock Lake Campground.\n\nCanoeing\n\nRock Lake offers a boat launch and is also a main access for interior camping on Rock Lake. There are excellent canoe opportunities available throughout Algonquin and Rock Lake is one of them. Although Rock Lake does not provide canoe/kayak rentals on site, there are outfitters in the area that will deliver your rentals to the campground. If you have a canoe but forgot your lifejacket, do not worry. Rock Lake carries a small selection of personal floatation devices (PFDs) that you may borrow.\n\nDiscovery Program\n\nConducted walks are led by park naturalists every day from late June to Labour Day. These consist of an hour and a half leisurely walk, exploring and learning about some part of the park environment. Times and locations are posted at bulletin boards within the parks.\n\nAlgonquin for Kids : Come with your kids (ages 5 to 12) to the Visitor Centre for an hour of discovery with games, stories and animals. Times and topics are posted at bulletin boards within the parks.\n\nEvening Programs begin at dusk every evening at the Outdoor Theatre (at km 35.4) from late June to Labour Day. Each program lasts about an hour and a half and consists of a film, a slide talk about some aspect of the park, a question period and them another film. When bad weather interferes, the programs and held at the Visitor Centre. Times and topics are posted at bulletin boards within the parks.\n\nSpecial Events are listed in This Week in Algonquin Park posted at all bulletin boards in the park.\n\nFishing\n\nAlgonquin has a reputation for some of the best trout fishing in Canada. More than 230 lakes have native Brook Trout and 149 have Lake Trout—a fantastic concentration of trout waters that continue to yield good fishing because of the Park’s tradition of wise conservation.\n\nAlong the highway, many of the lakes are stocked with Splake (a hybrid of Brook and Lake trout) and fishing is outstanding. Spring is the best season for trout and summer brings on more enjoyment with Smallmouth Bass. Spend a July day with the family at a prime bass location, enjoying the scenery and reeling in the night’s dinner. If you have forgotten your fishing rod, stop by the Rock Lake office and borrow one from our free Tackle Share program!\n\nFish Stocking List for Algonquin Provincial Park — 2013 to 2018\n\nHiking\n\nCentennial Ridges Trail located at km 37.6 - 10 km (3-4 hours) strenuous\n\nThis demanding loop rewards the hiker with spectacular viewing along two high ridges.\n\nBooth’s Rock Trail located 9km south of highway 60 at km 40.5 on the Rock Lake road - 5.1 km (2 hours) moderate\n\nThis trail visits two lakes and a spectacular lookout, returning via an abandoned railway.\n\nHunting\n\nHunting in this park is subject to the Ontario Hunting Regulations. Certain restrictions apply. For more information, contact the park or a Ministry of Natural Resources office.\n\nSwimming\n\nRock Lake Campground has two expansive beaches within a short walking distance of all campsites. Please note that pets are not allowed at the beach and the beach does not have lifeguards."
