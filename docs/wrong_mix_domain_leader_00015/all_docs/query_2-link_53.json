        "text": "30000 BC â The Very First Sculptures\n\nWhileÂ data sculptures date back from theÂ 1990s, the very first sculptures wereÂ Venus figurines: A Venus figurine is any Upper Paleolithic statuette portraying a woman with exaggerated physical features. The oldest onesÂ are about 35,000 years old. Right image:Â modern versions. Also see V.S. Ramachandran on the peak shift principle in art. Sources: Wikipedia article on Venus figurines. Left image from ancient-origins.net, right images from Mari Shiranui's flickr page and heldenshop.de.\n\n5500 BC â Mesopotamian Clay Tokens\n\nThe earliest data visualizations were likely physical: built by arranging stones or pebbles, and later, clay tokens. According to an eminent archaeologist (Schmandt-Besserat, 1999): \"Whereas words consist of immaterial sounds, the tokens were concrete, solid, tangible artifacts, which could be handled, arranged and rearranged at will. For instance, the tokens could be ordered in special columns according to types of merchandise, entries and expenditures; donors or recipients. The token system thus encouraged manipulating data by abstracting all possible variables. (Harth 1983. 19) [...] No doubt patterning, the presentation of data in a particular configuration, was developed to highlight special items (Luria 1976. 20). \" Clay tokens suggest that physical objects were used to externalize information, support visual thinking and enhance cognition way before paper and writing were invented. Sources: Denise Schmandt-Besserat (1999)Â Tokens: The Cognitive Significance. Denise Schmandt-Besserat (1996)Â How Writing Came About. Image taken fromÂ en.finaly.orgÂ (photo Denise Schmandt-Besserat)\n\n2600 BC â Quipus\n\nQuipus were complex assemblies of knotted ropes that were used in South America as a data storage device and played an important role in the Inca administration. Only a handful of specialists could use and decipher them. Their meaning mostly remains a mystery but it seems that color, relative position of knots, knot types and rope length were used to encode categorical and quantitative variables. The oldest known Quipu is 4600 years old. In the late 16th century quipus were still being used by Peruvians until the Roman Catholic church decreed they were \"the devil's work\" and had most of them destroyed. Sources: Paul Beynon-Davies (2009) Significant Threads. Dead Media Archive Peruvian Quipu. K. Kris Hirst. South America's Oldest Writing System.â Left image fromÂ https://courses.cit.cornell.edu/quipu/, right image fromÂ Beynon-Davies (2009).\n\n1600 BC â Water Clocks\n\nA water clock (or clepsydra) is an instrumentÂ where time is measured by regulating a flow of liquid. The oldest water clocks simply consisted ofÂ a pierced bowlÂ placed in a larger pot filled with water (see left image, Persian artefactÂ from 400 BC). These existed back in the 16th century BC. The passage of time wasÂ observed by counting how many times the bowl overflowed and its content had to be poured back in the larger pot. This was used for exampleÂ in Persia to ensure fair irrigation practices. This basic system has been improved upon many times across different continents, yieldingÂ more precise measurements and eliminatingÂ the need for manually resetting the mechanism. The second and thirdÂ image show the largest water clockÂ ever made, built by French physicist-turned-artist Bernard Gitton in 1988. It is more than 9 meters tall and shows the current hour and minute. Sources: Wikipedia article on water clocks. Holmes (2016)Â Object of Intrigue: Ancient Persian Water Clocks. English (2012)Â Inspiration: The Water Clocks of Bernard Gitton. Wikipedia article Water clock (Indianapolis).

Voting in Greece was introduced in the 5th century BC. Adult male citizens were invited to express their opinion by dropping a pebble in an urn: a white pebble meant \"yes\"Â andÂ a black pebble meantÂ \"no\". Sometimes two urns were used. The left image is a detail of a Greek wine cup from the 5th century BC, and is one of the earliest known depictions of the act of voting. The middle image is a modern reconstruction from a TV documentary. Secret voting was also in use, but it is unclear how (perhaps usingÂ \"a contraption to obscure the urn into which a voter was placing his hand\").Â By the mid-4th century BC, a more elaborate method of secret voting was introduced based on bronze ballots whose difference could only be felt by touch. In the 19th century, freemasons and fraternities started to useÂ ballot boxes to decide who should be included in the groupÂ or who should be expelled (see right image). The boxes had a small openingÂ where each member would covertly insertÂ a white marble to mean \"yes\",Â or a black marble (or black cube) to mean \"no\". After everyone voted, the box was opened so that all members could immediately see the results. Sometimes a single black marble or cube was sufficient to reject a proposition or an applicant, yielding the expression \"blackballing\".

Right image from the Merchantville Lodge #119.\n\n150 BC â Greek Orrery\n\nAn orreryÂ is a mechanicalÂ modelÂ of the solar system.Â The left image shows the Antikythera, the oldest knownÂ orrery. The middle image shows a virtual reconstruction. The right image shows a contemporary orrery. The Antikythera mechanism is an ancient analog computerÂ designed to predict astronomical positions and eclipses. It was recovered in 1900â01 from the Antikythera wreck, a shipwreck off the Greek island of Antikythera.Â The instrument was designed and constructed by Greek scientists and has been dated between 150 to 100 BC.Â After the knowledge of this technology was lost at some point in antiquity, technological artifacts approaching its complexity and workmanship did not appear again until the 14th century, when mechanical astronomical clocks began to be built in Western Europe.

Right imageÂ by Zeamon.\n\n132 â Chinese Seismoscope\n\nA seismoscope is a qualitative indicator of seismic activity --Â as opposed to seismographsÂ which showÂ quantitative data, typically throughÂ line graphs. The oldest known seismoscope is Chinese andÂ dates backs from 132. It was a large bronze device that dropped a ball into a bronze container (one of the eight frogs on the image above)Â every time an earthquake was detected, thus producing a loud sound. The direction of the earthquake could then be examined by looking at the container in which the ball was dropped. In AD 132,Â Zhang HengÂ of China'sÂ Han dynastyÂ invented the first seismoscope (by the definition above), which was calledÂ Houfeng Didong YiÂ (translated as, \"instrument for measuring the seasonal winds and the movements of the Earth\"). The description we have, from theÂ History of the Later Han Dynasty, says that it was a large bronze vessel, about 2 meters in diameter; at eight points around the top were dragon's heads holding bronze balls. When there was an earthquake, one of the mouths would open and drop its ball into a bronze toad at the base, making a sound and supposedly showing the direction of the earthquake. On at least one occasion, probably at the time of a large earthquake inÂ GansuÂ in AD 143, the seismoscope indicated an earthquake even though one was not felt. The available text says that inside the vessel was a central column that could move along eight tracks; this is thought to refer to a pendulum, though it is not known exactly how this was linked to a mechanism that would open only one dragon's mouth. The first ever earthquake recorded by this seismograph was supposedlyÂ somewhere in the east.Â Days later, a rider from the east reported this earthquake.

Volvelles are paper discs or ringsÂ placed on top of each other that rotate around a string or rivet. Many other types of paper mechanisms have been invented since then, such asÂ flaps, which were used in anatomy books starting from the 16th century (see second image above, 17th century, and third image, undated).Â Only in the 19th century did movable booksÂ started to be used for entertainment purposes and for children. Ellen G.K. RubinÂ (aka the pop-up lady)Â has a rich website and a must-watch talk about the history of pop-up and movable books.

Leonardo da Vinci was presumably one of the first to use these methods: Leonardo da Vinci (1452-1519) also developed techniques for observing the wind (by generating smoke in a tube and adding it to the wind at suitable points). Most important of all, he made actual experiments under controlled conditions. For this purpose, he used, among other things, a tank containing water mixed with fine millet, through which he moved solids, observing the flow past them. Leonardo wrote: âThe movement of water within water proceeds like that of air within air.â The left image shows aÂ drawing from Leonardo da Vinci. The remainingÂ images show more modern methods involving the use of die, cotton tufts, andÂ colored smoke.

Left image: a plan-relief of Bayonne, created byÂ SÃ©bastian Vauban (1633â1707),Â a famous fortification engineerÂ of King Louis XIV. Right image: a plan-relief of Grenoble from 1848. These scale models were highly prized for the tactical advantage they brought, and they were also shown around for dissuasive purposes. âIl y a un relief de Namur dans les Tuileries, je vous demanderai d'avoir la complaisance d'y venir avec moi. Je vous ferai toucher au doigt et Ã l'Åil tous les dÃ©fauts de cette place, qui sont en bon nombreÂ [...].â There is a relief of Namur in the Tuileries, I would ask you to kindly come with me. I will make you touch with your finger and your eye all the defects of this place, which are in good number. âÂ Vauban's letter to Le Pelletier, president of the constituent assembly (1695). âLe Moniteur parle d'un plan de la Suisse, du feu gÃ©nÃ©ral Pfiffer. Faites examiner ce plan, et, s'il est meilleur que celui que j'ai achetÃ© derniÃ¨rement, faites-le acheter et transporter Ã Paris. Comme il est possible que nous ayons encore la guerre, il n'y a point de meilleure carte que ces plans en relief.â The Monitor speaks about a map of Switzerland, from the late general Pfiffer. Have this map examined, and if it is better than the one I bought recently, have it bought and transported to Paris. Since it is possible that we may still have war, there is no better map than these relief maps. â NapolÃ©on's letter to MarÃ©chal Berthier (1805).

Today aÂ floaterÂ isÂ typically aÂ glass sphereÂ containing a colored liquidÂ and to which is attached a metallic temperature tag. The composition of a floater is irrelevant, its overall density just needs to be calibrated to a certain value and remain stable. Floaters being made of glass and metal, their volume - and therefore density - is largely unaffected by temperature. But when temperature rises, the ethanol around expands significantly.Â When itsÂ density matches the density of aÂ particular floater, that floater will move at the middle of the tube, thereby indicating the current temperature. The remaining floaters will move at the bottom or at the top. Despite its name, the GalileoÂ thermometer was not invented by Italian physicistÂ Galileo (1564â1642), but by the Florentine scientific societyÂ Accademia del CimentoÂ two decades after his deathÂ (left image). The Accademia del Cimento was founded inÂ 1657 by Grand DukeÂ Ferdinando II de' Medici (former student of Galileo) and his brother Prince Leopoldo, in order toÂ attract scientists to Florence for mutual study. It wasÂ the first scientificÂ organizationÂ founded for the sole purpose of making scientific experiments. ItsÂ motto wasÂ Probando e Reprobando, i.e., \"testing and retesting\". They created a number of scientific instruments before being demised in 1667. Galileo thermometers are now built and sold all over the worldÂ for decoration purposesÂ (right image). Galileo did invent a thermoscope (a thermometer without a numeric scale) in the earlyÂ 1600s, but it was very rudimentary, did not employ floaters,Â and was affected by atmospheric pressure. This instrumentÂ was an importantÂ invention butÂ bore no resemblance to what is now called the Galileo thermometer. Nonetheless, it is clear thatÂ Galileo'sÂ inventionsÂ and writings greatly influenced the Academia del Cimento. Sources: Peter Loyson (2012)Â Galilean Thermometer Not So Galilean.

Steve Mann mentions it as an early form of wearable \"computer\": Here is a \"computer\" (an abacus) and since it is a piece of jewelry (a ring), it is wearable. Such devices have existed for centuries, but do not successfully embody Humanistic Intelligence. In particular, because the abacus is task-specific, it does not give rise to what we generally mean by \"wearable computer\". For example, its functions and purpose (algorithms, applications, etc.) can't be reconfigured (programmed) by the end user while wearing it. In short, \"wearable computer\" means more than the sum of its parts i.e. more than just \"wearable\" and \"computer\". Made with beads of a silver ring abacus of 1.2 centimeter long and 0.7 centimeter wide, dating back to Chinese Qing Dynasty (1616-1911 BC [sic]) Sources: ChinaCulture.org (2010) The Story of the Chinese Abacus.

The volume of mercury changes with temperature; mercury isÂ drivenÂ out of the bulb andÂ up the tube as the temperature rises.

As argued by a 18th-century author: It is almost as necessary as in mechanics, to exhibit the objects, whose qualities are to be taught; and to call in the joint assistance of the hands and eyes. According to theÂ Whipple Museum of the History of Science, authors were already experimentingÂ with paperÂ modelsÂ soon after the very first English edition of Euclid in 1570. But in contrast with chemistry,Â the use of physical models has never become widespread in geometry. Sources: Mike Rich (2006)Â Wooden geometric models made by George Adams.

Chladni's technique [...] consisted of drawing a bow over a piece of metal whose surface was lightly covered with sand. The plate was bowed until it reached resonance, when the vibration causes the sand to move and concentrate along the nodal lines where the surface is still, outlining the nodal lines. The patterns formed by these lines are what are now called Chladni figures. Chladni was inspired by early experiments byÂ Robert Hooke who discovered the phenomenon in 1680, using flour instead of sand. This technique is still in use today to design acoustic instruments, with the difference that a loudspeaker is generally used instead of a bow. In the 1960s, Hans Jenny, a Swiss physician and natural scientist carried many experiments using sand, dust and fluids, and founded an mystical discipline called Cymatics based on exploring these phenomena.

French physician Louis Thomas JerÃ´me Auzoux developed this technique around 1820Â due to the shortage of human cadavers and wax models to study human anatomy.Â He was inspired by papier-mÃ¢chÃ© dolls that were common at the time.

He was a student of French mathematician Gaspard Monge, who invented descriptive geometry and was already illustrating his ideas with rudimentary string models.

The likelihood of a storm is indicated by the number of times the bell is struck. The device, which Merryweather called the \"tempest prognosticator\",Â was shown at the 1851 Great Exhibition in London. Merryweather tried to convince the British government to make use of his design, butÂ \"it was thought to be impractical, since the leeches needed to be fed once a month and have their water changed every five days\". The efficacy of the device is yet unproven. The original device was lost, but several replicas were made. The images above show a replica from 1951 currently exhibited at the Whitby museum.

Credited with being the original discoverer of the periodicity of elements and the originator of the three-dimensional method of element arrangement and representation. He drew the elements as a continuous spiral around a metal cylinder divided into 16 parts. The atomic weight of oxygen was taken as 16 and was used as the standard against which all the other elements were compared. Tellurium was situated at the centre, prompting vis tellurique, or telluric screw. Despite de Chancourtois' work, his publication attracted little attention from chemists around the world. The reason being thatÂ De Chancourtois's original diagram was left out of the publication, making the paper hard to comprehend.Â The paper also dealt mainly with geological concepts, and did not suit the interests of many chemistry experts. It was not until 1869 thatÂ Dmitri Mendeleyev'sÂ periodic tableÂ attracted attention and gained widespread scientific acceptance. The original (unique) telluric screw is now hosted at the museum de l'Ãcole des Mines.

He introduced a coloredÂ set of four croquet balls to represent atoms (hydrogen, oxygen, chlorine and nitrogen), implanted with a fixed number of sticks corresponding to each atom's valence.Â Thus we distinguish the chlorine atom asÂ univalent, the atom of oxygen asÂ bivalent, that of nitrogen asÂ trivalent, and lastly the carbon atom asÂ quadrivalent. - this I believe I can show you by a very simple contrivance. I will on this occasion, with your permission, select my illustration from that most delightful of gamesÂ croquet. Let theÂ croquet ballsÂ represent our atoms, and let us distinguish the atoms of different elements by different colours. TheÂ whiteÂ balls are hydrogen, theÂ greenÂ ones chlorine atoms; the atoms of fiery oxygen areÂ red, those of nitrogen,Â blue; the carbons atoms, lastly, are naturally represented byÂ blackÂ balls. But we have, in addition, to exhibit the different combining powers of these atoms. This we accomplish by screwing into the balls a number ofÂ metallic armsÂ (tubes and pins), whichÂ correspond respectively to the combining powers of the atomsÂ represented, and which, while constituting an additional feature of distinction, enable us at the same time to join the balls and to rear in this manner a kind of mechanical structures inÂ imitation of the atomic edificesÂ to be illustrated.\" (Extracts fromÂ Proceedings of the Royal Institution,Â 4, 401-430) Interestingly, while physical representations,Â Hofmann had the modelsÂ built so that they wereÂ two-dimensional representations of molecules.

It mostly consists of a transparent tube of adjustable length with powder in it. Sound is produced at one end of the tube, and the tube's length is adjusted until the sound becomes louder, indicating the tube is at resonance and the soundÂ forms a standing wave. The powder then accumulates at the nodes of the standing wave, where is no vibration. The wavelength of the sound can be determined by measuring the distance between nodes. Using the c = Î»f formula, sound speed (c) can then be determined from the wavelength (Î») and the frequency (f) of the sound. The image above showsÂ a modern implementation. Today, Kundt's tube is mostly used for educationalÂ or forÂ artistic purposes. Also see our entry 1787 â Chladni Plates. Sources: Wikipedia, Kundt's tube.

The model is made of bars, clamped together so as to allow free motion. In order to make the combination look like an atom, a thin round disc of blackened brass can be placed under the central nut. At the ends of the arms are holes to connect one carbon atom with another by means of a nut. The structure atÂ the bottom right of his figure is now calledÂ \"Dewar benzene\". I bring before the Society a simple mechanical arrangement adapted to illustrate structure in the non-saturated hydrocarbons. This little device is the mechanical representative of Dr. C. Brown's well-known graphic notation. A series of narrow thin bars of brass of equal length are taken, and every two of the bars clamped in the centre by a nut, so as to admit of free motion the one on the other. Such a combination represents a single carbon atom with its four places of attachment. In orderÂ to make the combination look like an atom, a thin round disc of blackened brass can be placed under the central nut. At the ends of the arms are holes to connect one carbon atom with another by means of a nut. The filling up of the places of attachment may be effected by slipping on the arms round discs of brass having a groove attached, and placing the symbol of the chemical element on the round projection. A carbon atom would then look like the following diagram. By J. Dewar, Esq.Â (fromÂ Proceedings of the Royal Society of Edinburgh,Â VI,Â Session 1866-67, pp. 82-86) Dewar sent KekulÃ© his brass strip molecular modeling kit in 1866, and KekulÃ© used it to hypothesize possible molecular structures for compunds. In 1867, KekulÃ© used Dewar's models to come up with a reasonable (by today's standards) structure for mesitylene (1,3,5-trimethylbenzene, C9H12). Note that in the drawing, little dots appear in in the middle of some of the bonds. They appear because the drawings are of a real model, and the various atoms were screwed together at the dots. Also note that the acetone molecules in the model appear not to be symmetrical, with one C-C bond bent and the other one straight. However, the bent bond is only an illusion created by the flatness of the paper; in KekuleÃ©'s 3-D model, all of the C-C bonds are straight. James Deward is famous for his Researches in low temperature phenomena. See [3] to learn more. Sources: J. Michael Mc Bride Models and Structural Diagrams in the 1860s J.

Chapter 7 - The Periodic Table and Periodic Trends\n\n1898 â Tallies Used as Social Displays on Pacific Islands\n\nIn the 19th century, the Torres Strait IslandersÂ did not have a numeralÂ system andÂ used sticksÂ to keep counts.Â Sticks were tied to a string,Â forming a bundle (called kupe)Â that could be rolled and unrolled when needed. Kupes were typically usedÂ by men to keep track of their accomplishments, such as turtles caught in deep water, fishes speared,Â or adventures withÂ women (as the one above). These physical visualizations were used as social displays, and big kupes were greatly prized. According to Haddon (1912): These tallies are left entirely to a man's honour; a man may have doubts about the correctness of another's tally, but he would never dare single-handed to express an opinion doubting it. Sometimes a crowd may chaff a man whom they suspect of chearing and get him to confess that he was only 'gammoning'\". Kupes have elements of self-logging, as well asÂ using physical visualizations for social purposes (see our entriesÂ on SweatAtoms and Meshu.io). They were first reported by British biologist and anthropologistÂ Alfred Cort Haddon after a 1898Â expedition, but they are likely much older. Tallies were used all over the worldÂ and some of them are very old.Â TheÂ prehistoric artefacts found in theÂ Blombos Cave inÂ South AfricaÂ included a piece of ochre on which tally marks were seemingly made, as well as pierced shells that seem to have beenÂ strung on cord and worn. These artefacts date back fromÂ betweenÂ c. 100,000 and 70,000 years.

Blombos Cave.\n\n1900 â Pearson and Lee's Height Correlation Chart\n\nThe physical model on the left is a bivariate histogram showingÂ the correlation between the heights of fathersÂ (horizontal axis) and sons (\"vertical\" axis). This data wasÂ famously collected by Karl Pearson and Alice Lee between 1893 and 1898. TheÂ physical visualization is thought toÂ have been constructed aroundÂ this time period or soon after, possibly under the supervision of Pearson. It is kept at the Department of Statistical Science,Â University College London, founded by PearsonÂ in 1911. I (Pierre) learned about this model after seeing a more recent model in the archives of the collection of solid mathematical models at the Institut Henri PoincarÃ© (right image). A label said \"Model Prepared by Dept. of Statistics, University College London\". I then wrote to Professor Richard Chandler, current chair of the statistics department, to ask if he had more information about this model. He replied soon after: Thank you for your message below. This is interesting â¦ I have never seen this particular model before, but the labelling looks very similar to some exhibits that were prepared for an event at the Royal Statistical Society in (I think) the 1980s. I arrived at UCL in 1994: at that time there were some people in the department who had been involved in that event. Unfortunately they are no longer with us, so I canât provide any further information. I can, however, speculate that the model youâre showing is a cardboard copy of a much older one that was prepared at the end of the 19th century, probably under the supervision of Karl Pearson. We still have this.Â I found this particular model in my desk drawer when I first arrived at UCL: it was broken into a very large number of pieces, but I had it restored. It is quite a nice piece of 19th-century data visualisation, I think! Upon closer examination, the newer model does not show the same dataset as the older model. The following R code replicates the older model exactly, confirming that it shows the original dataset from Pearson and Lee: library(dplyr) d = HistData::PearsonLee %&gt;% filter(par == \"Father\" &amp; chl == \"Son\") %&gt;% reshape2::acast(parent~child, value.var=\"frequency\") plot3D::hist3D(z = d[nrow(d):1,], col=\"white\", border=\"black\", shade=0.2, phi=60, theta=0) Sources: Pearson, K., &amp; Lee, A.

Physical terrain models were already being built in 16th the century, and the review covers modern techniques from the early 20th century to today's digital fabrication.

These visualizations were madeÂ out of the objects and the people themselves. The purpose wasÂ toÂ explain the notion of statistical distributionÂ to a lay audience. On the left image, seashells are piled up according to how many ribs they have. On the middleÂ image, students are arranged in binsÂ according to their height. On the right image, they are simply sorted. Charles Davenport's research on eugenics may be controversial. Nevertheless, his explanationÂ of statistical distributions has a clear pedagogical value. His examples also show that spatial arrangement is a key feature of data visualizations, and that a good spatial arrangement can augment cognitionÂ even without the use ofÂ abstract mappings and encodings.

Each major event in their life was represented byÂ a knot, a bead or a shell. This mnemonic device is called anÂ Ititamat, or counting-the-days ball, or simplyÂ time ball.Â The first image shows an ItitamatÂ created before 1920. On the second image, each string is a differentÂ Ititamat. The last image shows a 2003 replica. A young woman would use a time ball to record her courtship, marriage, and other experiences using a system of knots and beads that only she could decipher. As she grew older, a woman might have several time balls with which to share her life story or keep those memories private. When she passed on, they were buried with her.Â The ball of twine grew in size as time passed and as events occurred. The women would sometimes divide the twine into 25-year lengths to make it more manageable. When the women were very old, they could use the knots and beads of their time balls to recall not only what happened in their lives but when the events occurred. They could easily recount when their children were born, when they moved away, and other major experiences.Â Also see our entry onÂ Torres Strait Islanders tallies and on the Polynesian Genealogical Instrument.

Karsten patented a method for creating physical visualizations of temporal data by stacking two-dimensional plates, each representing a time period. Each of the plates shown above is a variable-width column chartÂ representing the state of the stock market at the end of a particular month. Each bar is a type of stock, where the height of theÂ bar encodes the stock price and its width encodes volumes of sales. Each month, a new layer is added. Seen from above, this 3D visualization becomes a 2D stacked bar chart showing volumes of sales across time. Karl G. Karsten wrote a book entitled Charts And GraphsÂ in 1925, where he discusses physical visualizations used in engineering. Many of these were previously discussed in John Peddle's 1910 book The construction of graphical chartsÂ and Willard Cope Brinton's 1914 book Graphic Methods for Presenting Facts.

They were not meant to be visually examined, but were used inÂ mechanicalÂ analog computers for aiming battleship guns duringÂ WWII. They were also called computing cams. Mechanical fire control aids started to be developedÂ in theÂ 1900sÂ and andÂ were still in use in the late 1980s. During WWII,Â they could solve multivariate calculus problems in real-time. WhileÂ cams were used for hard-codedÂ functions, gears were used for arithmetic calculations and other specializedÂ devices were used for multiplication and differential calculus.Â The design of these analog computers is clearly explained in the video and PDFs linked below.

Experimental evidence supporting the Watson and Crick model was published in a series of five articles in the same issue of Nature. Of these, Franklin and Gosling's paper was the first publication of their own X-ray diffraction data and original analysis method that partially supported the Watson and Crick model; this issue also contained an article on DNA structure by Maurice Wilkins and two of his colleagues, whose analysis supported their double-helix molecular model of DNA.

Each wire is cut to the maximum distance that light or electricity can travel in a nanosecond, one billionth of a second. She wanted programmers to understand 'just what they're throwing away when they throw away a millisecond', and describes using them to help military commanders understand why signals take so long to relay via satellite. This lecture was given at MIT Lincoln Laboratory on 25 April 1985 (video above); she used the short wires as a visual teaching method from the late 60s. A bundle of her nanosecond wires are in the Smithsonian Museum (left photo above). From the Smithsonian Collection Website, under a CC0 license: This bundle consists of about one hundred pieces of plastic-coated wire, each about 30 cm (11.8 in) long. Each piece of wire represents the distance an electrical signal travels in a nanosecond, one billionth of a second. Grace Murray Hopper (1906â1992), a mathematician who became a naval officer and computer scientist during World War II, started distributing these wire \"nanoseconds\" in the late 1960s in order to demonstrate how designing smaller components would produce faster computers. The \"nanoseconds\" in this bundle were among those Hopper brought with her to hand out to Smithsonian docents at a March 1985 lecture at NMAH. Later, as components shrank and computer speeds increased, Hopper used grains of pepper to represent the distance electricity traveled in a picosecond, one trillionth of a second (one thousandth of a nanosecond).Reference: Kathleen Broome Williams, Grace Hopper: Admiral of the Cyber Sea, Annapolis, MD: Naval Institute Press, 2004. Grace Hopper (1906-1992) was one of the first programmers of the Harvard Mark I computer, and invented compilers and machine independant programming languages, which underpin most of modern computing. She earned a Ph.D. in mathematics from Yale University and was a professor of mathematics at Vassar College before joining the Navy reserves during World War II. She was behind the development of COBOL in the 1960s; was the first person to use the phrase 'bug' for programming faults, and was posthumously given the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2016.

The first three images above show a small, medium, and large version. A rod mechanism allowed unlocking either rows or columns for reordering. The dominos were part of a general method of âgraphic information processingâ, extensively described by Bertin in a relatively poorly-known 1977 book. This method stems from his progressive realization that, while maps and charts are traditionally drawn once for all, âmobile imagesâ can be freely manipulated to reveal patterns. Thus he recognized the importance of interactivity three decades before information visualization. Bertin physically implemented five types of âinteractiveâÂ visualizations: the family of curves (line charts on transparent paper sheets that can be superimposed) the image file (stacked cards with a visual index) the collection of maps (rearrangeable small multiples) the collection of ordered tables (rearrangeable paper tables), and finally the reorderable matrix. For Bertin, the reorderable matrix was by far the most powerful tool. His method required thatÂ numerical data be collected on a paper table to start with. Then, values were converted into discrete steps, again on a paper table (7 to 11 different steps depending on the Domino version). Then, the physical matrix was assembled by choosing among a collection of physical cells that encode different ranges of values. Afterwards, the matrix was reordered to reveal patterns, which could take a long time. Finally,Â meaningful groups were identified and named. The result was then photographied or photocopied, and the final image was used as a figure in the scientific publication, enriched with a legend and caption. The first video (fourth image above) shows a reorderable matrix being used. The second video is an educational video explaing the method to a large audience (English subtitles are available). Bertin's method of data analysis, while time-consuming, remained popular for a while andÂ underwent several computer adaptations.

The tool was popularÂ until the 1990s. Byron Rubin became an artist who buildsÂ large-scaleÂ molecular sculptures. Eric MartzÂ andÂ Eric Francoeur explainÂ how suchÂ physicalÂ models yielded important scientific insights: An example illustrating the importance of models from Byron's Bender occurred at a scientific meeting in the mid 1970's. At this time, less than two dozen protein structures had been solved. David Davies brought a Bender model of an immunoglobulin Fab fragment, and Jane and David Richardson brought a Bender model of superoxide dismutase. While comparing these physical models at the meeting, they realized that both proteins use a similar fold, despite having only about 9% sequence identity. This incident was the first recognition of the occurrence of what is now recognized as the immunoglobulin superfamily domain in proteins that are apparently unrelated by sequence. The insight was published in a paper entitled \"Similarity of three-dimensional structure between the immunoglobulin domain and the copper, zinc superoxide dismutase subunit\" (Â RichardsonÂ et al., J. Mol. Biol. 102:221-235, 1976). Also see the more recent DIWire device by Pensalabs. Sources: Byron Rubin. molecularsculpture.com.

The audience expressedÂ his opinion onÂ the question \"Would the fact that Governor Rockefeller has not denounced President Nixon's Indochina Policy be a reason for your not voting for him in November?\". The left plexiglassÂ box collectedÂ \"Yes\" answers, whileÂ the right box collectedÂ \"No\" answers. Rockefeller was running for re-election andÂ was aÂ major donor and board member at the museum. HeÂ tried to have the piece removed the next day but without success.

It was invented in 1977 by&nbsp;Stephen Pevnick, an American artist. Graphical waterfalls can be used with regular&nbsp;lighting (as on the left video) or with a stroboscope (as on the right video), depending on the desired effect. It is unclear whether such devices have been already used to display data. Sources: Pevnick Design (2018),&nbsp;Invention of the Graphical Waterfall&reg;.

In 1984, he describes a number of imaginary analog computers he calls \"Analog Gadgets\", which can in principle solve computingÂ problems instantly. The first one, shown on the left image,Â uses spaghetti to sort numbers. The second one uses strings to find the shortest path in a graph. The third one uses nails and a rubber band to find the convex hull. The last one illustrated here uses soap bubbles to solve the Steiner tree problem. Dewdney admits that mostÂ of these ideas were not new and were \"part of computer science folklore, passed around by word of mouth and rarely described in the literature\". His Scientific American article and a book he later wrote in 1993 helpedÂ popularizeÂ the ideas.Â These analog gadgetsÂ were only thought experiments and were never meant to be put into actual use. Still,Â before digital computers took over, analog computers were used to solve real problems such as theÂ control of battleship guns. Also see our other entries on physical computation, includingÂ Christian Freksa's use of a 3D printer to solve the shortest path problem. Sources: A. K.

Already in the early 70s, statisticians like John Tukey were starting to experiment with multidimensional data visualization on flat computers screens, including 3D data visualizations that could be interactively rotated to convey depth. This video shows how enthusiastic these people were to transition from the physical to the virtual. Nevertheless, it is interesting to see that Rick Becker felt the need to build a physical model to explain 3D scatterplots. Later in the video, he also uses a paper cube model to explain scatterplot matrices. Sources: Becker and McGill (1985) Dynamic Displays of Data.

The machineÂ spits out a marbleÂ each time an incoming voice message is recorded. The order of the marbles indicates the order in which the messages arrived.Â Messages can be played back by putting a marble in a small dent. If the message is for somebody else it can be placed on a small dish to the side that can be labeled with names of different persons. The telephone itself also has a small receptor area for the marbles and by placing a message there, the original caller gets called back. See the video.

From the website description: Performance with loom, yarn, bed, nightgown, EEG Machine and artistâs REM reading. Antoni transforms the fleeting act of dreaming into a sculptural process. Between 1994 and 2000,Â the artist slept in the bed while an electroencephalograph machine recordedÂ her eye movement.Â During the day, Antoni would sit at the loom and weaveÂ shreds of her nightgown in the pattern ofÂ her REM.Â The patterns were wovenÂ intoÂ theÂ blanket that covered the artist as she slept at night. In developingÂ Slumber, the artist researched dreams from the vantage of mythology, art history, psychoanalysis, and science.Â Through her performance, she uses mythology to reinterpret the scientific. As Antoni discusses â âScience had made a machine for the body to make a drawing. I love the idea that if art comes from the unconscious, then this particular drawing is coming straight from the unconscious onto the page without an intercession of the conscious mind.â Source:Â http://www.janineantoni.net/slumber/\n\n1995 â San Diego TeleManufacturing Facility\n\nInÂ 1995,Â Mike BaileyÂ fromÂ theÂ San Diego Supercomputer CenterÂ created theÂ SDSC TeleManufacturing FacilityÂ to help scientists visualize their data in physical form. In 1997, the facility produced one of the first digitally-fabricated molecular models usingÂ laminated object manufacturing. TheÂ biochemists involved in the project got insights that they were not able to get from the on-screen 3D models, and concluded that: modern physical models are important tools that significantly extend the understanding of protein assembly available from modern three-dimensional computer graphical analysis. Later, theÂ TeleManufacturing Facility moved to Oregon State University, still under the direction of Mike Bailey.Â It was renamedÂ the Center for Visualization Prototypes, then theÂ Center for 3D Hardcopy.Â It now employsÂ a ZCorp Z406 3D printer.Â The center has fabricated more than 1,000 physical models, helping scientists from many different disciplinesÂ visualize their data.

The simplest form has three states: to do, in progress, and doneÂ (left image). A Kanban boardÂ provides a visualÂ overview over all work items that makes it possible to rapidly spotÂ time management issues, such as too many items in progress. Although software versions exist, many people prefer Kanban boards to be physical. Several recent blog posts (linksÂ below) discuss the benefits of physical Kanban boards, e.g.,Â they areÂ 1) always available andÂ visible,Â unavoidable;Â 2)Â flexible and expressive, easy to customize; 3) easy and engaging to use - moving items forwardÂ can be rewarding; 4) in teams, canÂ promote engagement, encourageÂ conversations, createÂ a spirit of common purpose. Drawbacks include theÂ absence of support for synchronization at a distance, history management, constraint enforcement, post-processing and calculations, and they only provide a finite working space. Hybrid solutions like JimFlowÂ (2012) are commercialized that try to combine the best of both worlds. Hybrid boards (although not Kanban) have also been explored in the field of tangible user interfaces, e.g., byÂ Jacob et al.Â (2002). Sources: Wikipedia article on theÂ Kanban Board.

In 2002 she started to useÂ subsurface laser engraving to produce 3D physical visualizations of data from astronomy, biology, and physics.Â Left image: a piece of DNA molecule.Â Right image: a 3D map of our nearby stars. The artist explains to us: This medium excels at imaging less structural data such as disconnected volumes, non-compact point clouds, and the convoluted strands of proteins.Â It works by projecting intersecting Nd:YAG laser beams into clear glass, concentrating enough energy at the intersection to create a microfracture that is precisely located within the glass.Â The laser is then pulsed and moved; a typical image might contain from 100,000 to several million marks.Â The art of the medium is in regulating position and density of the marks so that bright lines and points are produced, as well as surfaces of varying translucency, without concentrating marks so closely as to over stress the glass and produce larger fractures.

Their setup called \"liquid brain\" consists in a transparent water tank suspended over an overhead projectorÂ and four LEGO motors. Input values are sent to the motors which vibrate the water. A camera then reads the watter ripples and sends the dataÂ to a simple perceptron.Â The paper shows that the system is able to distinguish between utterances of the words \"zero\" and \"one\" with much higher accuracy than a perceptron alone.
