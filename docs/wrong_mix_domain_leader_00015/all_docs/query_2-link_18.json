        "text": "The cult of saints and the subsequent interest in relics constituted one of the essential characteristics of medieval Western Christianity. In particular, relics and reliquaries are prime examples of the importance of materiality in devotion. In the present article we analyse one of the medieval skull relics of Turku Cathedral and its material characteristics in detail. Previous examinations undertaken in the 1920s and 1940s produced two theories of its origins and identification. By analysing the bone material and the narrative depiction of martyrdom embroidered on the silk wrapping, State Archaeologist Juhani Rinne connected the relic to St Henry, the patron saint of Finland and the cathedral, while State Archaeologist Carl Axel Nordman identified it as belonging to St Eric, the patron saint of the Kingdom of Sweden. By reexamining the central element of the skull relic, the bones, with osteological analysis and radiocarbon dating, we show both theories to be highly problematic. Our analysis reveals the complex material features of the skull relic and the medieval cult of relics.\n\nA few years ago, the remains of Finland's oldest identified churches were still dated to the 1230s. Since the founding of parishes was dated to the early 13 th century, these remains were associated with the period of ecclesiastical organisation. In 2013, the well-preserved stone foundation of a church presumably built already in the 12 th century was excavated in southwestern Finland. Located in the middle of an inhumation cemetery, this building was associated with the ecclesiastical activities of the period of missionary activity in Finland and may have been the church of a village or locality used by a community smaller than later parishes. Also two previously known foundations of belfries from two separate inhumation cemeteries may date from this period of transition from the Iron Age to the Middle Ages. Because very little is known about the remains of early churches, the new finds discussed in this article provide considerable additions to our view of the early ecclesiastical culture of Finland.\n\nThe change in use of Christian religious buildings raises various issues, and establishing a context for them means dealing with core conservation themes while at the same time examining the relationships between shape and content in architecture. For several decades, the debate around this subject was focused on the dichotomy between figurative and historical (material) values. Today, theoretical reflection vacillates between the pre-eminent attention paid to the architecture itself, and to the meanings that we can derive from it. Architectural forms gather together and transmit different concepts. These can be spatial, constructive, structural, technological, material; but also social, economic and, in general terms, cultural. If the first group of qualifications defines the properties of the architecture in itself, the second group refers purely to its functional and symbolic dimensions. Confronting the issues that arise from proposals that show new weak functions conflicting with strong ancient symbols, the solutions, yet again, must not derive from the uncertain path of extra-architectural significance, but in the potential for the building itself to show its own specific essence. If it is true that architectural questions from the past reach us as answers through their objectivation, our answers, to retain credibility, should not avoid the need to build a deep relationship with that same physicality\n\nThe cult of saints and the subsequent interest in relics constituted one of the essential characteristics of medieval Western Christianity. In particular, relics and reliquaries are prime examples of the importance of materiality in devotion. In the present article we analyse one of the medieval skull relics of Turku Cathedral and its material characteristics in detail.

Due to secularization, the decline and the movement of the population, these assets are less and less used. The exact number of properties involved is not known, but significant numbers can be expected, if it is true that there are an estimated 600,000 existing houses of worship in Europe. The aim of the contribution is to verify, taking as examples three states with a Catholic tradition, namely Belgium, France, and Italy, what the different approaches to the phenomenon are, taking into account the different systems of relations between States and religious denominations and the legal regimes of places of worship, so as to be able to propose new legal solutions. The methodology consisted in an examination of the different legislations existing in Belgium, France and Italy, concerning buildings of worship and the protection and enhancement of cultural heritage. As an indepth focus, the research was limited to Catholic churches and, as far as Italy is concerned, a systematic study of the cases of decommissioning that occurred in the diocese of Turin between 1978 and 2019 was carried out. Despite the diversity of ownership â€“ public in Belgium and France, tendentially private in Italy â€“ some common elements emerge: the importance of the community participation in decisions on new uses, the possibility of mixed uses for worship and secular activities, and the valorisation of the cultural aspects of these assets. The research leads me to formulate a decalogue, containing elements that should be considered, before proceeding to the canonical reduction to profane uses and following reuse of churches, involving community participation, agreement between ecclesiastical and civil authorities and the pursuit of a systemic approach."
