Over\n\n100 eager student government mem-\n\nbers report to the Agnes Scott campus.\n\nThe enthusiasm overflows. Everyone\n\nis ready for the new year to begin.\n\nWednesday, September 13. These\n\nsame girls return to the campus, weary\n\nand worn. The enthusiasm is still there,\n\nbut it is marked by a sense of ex-\n\nhaustion and dirt.\n\nThese young ladies had just spent\n\nthree busy days at the 1967 Student\n\nGovernment Retreat at Camp Calvin\n\nin Hampton. Ga. There the boards\n\nplanned the business for fall quarter\n\nand decided on the emphasis for the\n\ncoming year.\n\nAt the Monday morning opening\n\nsession, Alice (Zolly) Zollicoffer, stu-\n\ndent government president, introduced\n\nthe theme for the year \"To What\n\nIntent?\" This theme follows closely\n\nthose of the past few years \"perspec-\n\ntive,\" ('65) \"markings,\" ('66) and\n\n\"emergence,\" ('67).\n\nIn her speech, which was geared to\n\nstudent government, Zollicoffer said\n\nthat students desire to play \"more\n\nthan a receiving role\" in their college\n\ncommunity. The student \"is grasping\n\nfor his place as a contributor within\n\nthe academic world to help better the\n\neducational process and to confront\n\nthose within his college with the cru-\n\ncial issues concerning the goals of\n\nhigher education.\"\n\nShe went on to say that \"students\n\nare moving from the isolated ivy-\n\ncovered walls and beginning to draw\n\nfrom both the college community and\n\nlarger society for their learning ex-\n\nperiences.\" The experience of learning,\n\naccording to Zollicoffer, \"should in-\n\nclude student government. Self-govern-\n\nment represents no practice ground\n\nrather it provides an opportunity for\n\nstudents to learn, to express them-\n\nselves, and to act.\"\n\nAttending the student government\n\nretreat were the members of Judicial\n\nBoard, Representative Council, Chris-\n\ntian Association, Athletic Association,\n\nSocial Council, Orientation Council,\n\nand the Silhouette staff, along with\n\ntheir advisors.\n\n\"The Purpose of Education\" served\n\nas the topic for a faculty-student panel\n\ndiscussion at the Monday evening\n\nsession. Representing students were\n\nsenior Judy King, sophomore Ann\n\nMarquess, and junior Evelyn Ange-\n\nletti. Faculty members included Kwai\n\nSing Chang, associate professor of\n\nBible; Geraldine Meroney, associate\n\nprofessor of history; Julia T. Gary,\n\nassociate professor of chemistry and\n\nassociate dean of the faculty, and\n\nMiriam K. Drucker, professor of psy-\n\nchology. Allyn Smoak, a senior, was\n\nthe moderator.\n\nEach of the panel members seemed\n\nto agree that the liberal arts educa-\n\ntion was the best kind. Each faculty\n\nmember, however, had a different def-\n\ninition of the \"liberal arts\" education,\n\nbut each seemed to imply that it\n\nwould, in effect, create the \"whole\n\nwoman.\"\n\nOne aspect of retreat which allowed\n\nparticipants to get away from the\n\nserious business for a while was the\n\nOlympics in which students partici-\n\npated in sports events such as bubble\n\ngum blowing contests. The most un-\n\nusual event was the Odd Animal con-\n\ntest in which the sponsors of the or-\n\nganizations participated in an egg\n\nthrow, won by Bertie Bond of Social\n\nCouncil.\n\nThe final session of Retreat, Wednes-\n\nday, featured a speech by President\n\nWallace M. Alston. After adjourn-\n\nment, the students returned to prepare\n\nto meet the freshman and a new year.\n\nALUMNAE QUARTERLY / FALL 1967\n\n'But Ever Follow That Which is Good'\n\nBy ROGER HAZELTON\n\n\"Test everything; hold fast to what\n\nis good.\" This is one of those verses\n\n(I Thessalonians 5:21 ) in which Paul\n\nthe apostle manages to capture in a\n\nvery few words a whole wealth of\n\nmeaning for our life. In fact, a text\n\nlike this is tricky and slippery to han-\n\ndle just because it is so terse, so gen-\n\neral, that it can be taken in a great\n\nvariety of ways. You may remember\n\nHumpty-Dumpty's remark in Alice in\n\nWonderland about his use of words: \"I\n\npays them extra and makes them mean\n\nwhat I like.\" That is always happen-\n\ning with the Bible, too. Paul's crisp\n\nimperatives or Jesus' humorous asides\n\nget blown up into bland formulas sup-\n\nposed to be capable of meeting our\n\nneeds and solving our problems,\n\nwhereas their real purpose may be\n\nto generate new needs and pose prob-\n\nlems we had never thought of before.\n\nAt least that is my experience in read-\n\ning the Bible, and this text is no ex-\n\nception to the rule.\n\nTesting and holding fast are images\n\nthat mark contrasting if not contradic-\n\ntory attitudes. Almost every group\n\ncontains those who want to try every-\n\nthing, the experimenters, and those\n\nwho cling firmly to what they already\n\nknow to be good, the conservers.\n\nThere is usually little love lost be-\n\ntween the two; they call each other\n\nunpleasant names, cannot seem to get\n\ntogether on a single program or pro-\n\nposal, and remain locked in a kind of\n\ncivil war with each other. Our political\n\nstereotypes of \"left\" and \"right\" give\n\nproof of this, and the same split is\n\noften found in the communities of\n\nfaith and learning too. You may watch\n\nit in operation in practically every\n\ncommittee room or council chamber\n\nin the world. I suppose the history of\n\nmankind could be written in terms\n\nof it.\n\nBut what if these two tendencies,\n\nwhich have so often divided us, could\n\nbe induced to lie down together like\n\nthe lion and the lamb in the prophecy\n\nDr. Hazelton, a distinguished theologian,\n\nis Abbot Professor of Chrisitian Theology\n\nat Andover Newton Theological School.\n\nThis is his Baccalaureate Address June 11,\n\n1967 at Agnes Scott.\n\nof Isaiah? Or rather, to stand up to-\n\ngether in both the person and the\n\ngroup, for the facing of our common\n\nproblems and our individual needs? As\n\nPascal would say, these two together\n\nwould make one good man, as each\n\nwould give what the other lacks, in-\n\nstead of lacking what the other has to\n\ngive.\n\nAnd they do belong together, even\n\nif we usually come upon them in sep-\n\naration and at odds with each other.\n\nTesting and holding fast are not two\n\napproaches to life, but one. If there\n\nhas been no trying of different ex-\n\nperiences, different convictions on for\n\nsize there cannot be the right to judge\n\none as being better than another. There\n\nis no valid substitute for personal\n\nparticipation, being there yourself,\n\nwhether it is in the realm of science,\n\nart, faith or friendship. Far too much\n\nof life is lived at second hand, by\n\nhearsay, on the basis of opinion only\n\nand we should not be surprised if it\n\nis accordingly tame and trite when\n\nthis is the case. Things and people\n\ngive themselves to us only as we can\n\ngive ourselves to them, trustingly and\n\ngenerously.\n\nI know, as you do. that there is\n\nreal risk and even danger in this will-\n\ningness to test everything which Paul\n\nis recommending. If I deliberately put\n\nmyself in the way of a wide variety\n\nof encounters, conversations, invita-\n\ntions I run the risk of being changed:\n\nI cannot stay as I now am. but may\n\neven lose myself, or what I take to be\n\nmyself in the process. We do not\n\nspeak much of temptation nowadays,\n\neither in home or church: but there is\n\ntemptation in all testing, which is at\n\nthe same time a being tested. I cannot\n\nrespond with out becoming responsi-\n\nble. But neither do I earn the right\n\nto call anything truly good except on\n\nthe terms of a genuine venturing-forth\n\nout of what is tried and true in the\n\ndirection of a truth that has never\n\nyet been tried. A taste and zest for\n\nlife, in all its tumbling, turbulent vari-\n\nety, is what makes possible the dis-\n\ncovery and definition of what is good.\n\nAs the great philosopher. Alfred\n\nNorth Whitehead, wrote, we must not\n\nneglect \"the multifariousness of the\n\nworld the fairies dance, and Christ is\n\nnailed to the cross.\"\n\nThe sad fact is that ordinarily our\n\nexperiences are so grooved and pat-\n\nterned, so expected, that the range of\n\npossible good is much more narrow\n\nthan it ought to be for most of us. We\n\nplay it safe when we should be taking\n\nhealthy chances: so. for instance, our\n\nnatural inquisitiveness gets channeled,\n\nconfined, and finally all but stifled in\n\nthe routines of formal education, when\n\nit might better be sharpened and made\n\nexpert. We have to learn and re-learn,\n\nsometimes quite painfully, how to be-\n\ncome open to one another and to\n\nmoments of truth within the web of\n\nour inquiry and involvement. It is an\n\narduous but precious lesson that is\n\ncontained in Paul's words. \"Test every-\n\nthing\": and it may come with some-\n\nthing of a shock, for we do not usually\n\nTHE ACNES SCOTT\n\nfind spokesmen for religion on the side\n\nof the experimenters but of the con-\n\nservers. Or at least that is where we are\n\nin the habit of looking for them, as\n\nif religion existed mainly to under-\n\nscore our timidity and inertia, instead\n\nof releasing our capacity and appetite\n\nfor what is new and different! But\n\nlet it not be forgotten that the Chris-\n\ntian faith equips us not merely to en-\n\ndure change but to produce it. to take\n\nit into ourselves and be shaped by it.\n\nIn the eyes of faith this is God's\n\nworld, and we are free to use and\n\nenjoy everything in it for our good\n\nand for his glory. Indeed, there is a\n\nkind of recklessness or daring that\n\nbelongs to faith's own manner of life.\n\nThe poets know this just as well and\n\noften better than the saints. Here is\n\nJohn Keats, reflecting on our need\n\nto get out into the mainstream and\n\naway from the safe, already known\n\nworld: \"I leaped headlong into the\n\nsea and thereby have become better ac-\n\nquainted with the soundings, the quick-\n\nsands and the rocks than if I had\n\nstayed upon the green shore, and piped\n\na silly pipe, and took tea and com-\n\nfortable advice.\"\n\nYes, everything is to be tested for\n\nits possibilities of good. Whether we\n\nare thinking of areas of study, fields\n\nof action or relationships with one\n\nanother, the same principle holds. But\n\nnotice what a delicate and nicely-\n\nbalanced principle this is. It does not\n\nmean taking everything as it comes\n\nwith no questions asked, for that is\n\nonly to make experience shapeless and\n\ntrivial; and neither does it mean using\n\nthings and persons for devious pur-\n\nposes of my own, asking interminably\n\njust what good they have for me. The\n\npoint is to keep trying, tasting, test-\n\ning, to be \"out for stars\" as Robert\n\nFrost said, so that the freshness and\n\ngoodness of life may not be squeezed\n\nout altogether but may go on nourish-\n\ning and enriching us.\n\nThe truth is, we are not without\n\nguidance or direction for the \"sound-\n\nings, the quicksands, and the rocks\"\n\ninto which life plunges us. It is not as\n\nif no one had ever passed this way\n\nbefore. The line of living runs from\n\npast to present, teacher to student,\n\nparent to child, institution to indi-\n\nvidual, and not the other way around,\n\neven if this is not a one-way street\n\nor a dreary place where there is \"noth-\n\ning new under the sun\", to quote that\n\nbiblical cynic called Ecclesiastes. Time\n\ngoes not backward, but forward. There\n\nis both truth and error in the view\n\nI hear expressed so often that each\n\nof us must learn his own lessons and\n\nbe allowed to make his own mistakes.\n\nOur freedom, just because it is real\n\nfreedom, is always bounded by re-\n\nsponsibility; we are inheritors and\n\ndebtors even in our most creative or\n\nsolitary moments, when we are not\n\nmerely practicing our own signature\n\nor tiresomely imitating our own style.\n\nWhen we were in Japan three years\n\nago we heard a great deal about the\n\n\"generation gap\" between parents and\n\nteachers on the one hand and young\n\nstudents on the other. The war and\n\nthe occupation, we were told, had\n\nbrought about a situation in which\n\nolder and younger Japanese could no\n\nlonger understand or even communi-\n\ncate with each other, where the an-\n\ncient landmarks of loyalty had disap-\n\npeared and a vacuum of confusion and\n\nrootlessness had been produced in-\n\nstead. We know something about this\n\ngeneration gap in our country too. The\n\nstructures in which we live and work\n\nare deeply disturbed and shaken by it.\n\nAre there ways in which this gap can\n\nbe reduced or bridged? Just here, it\n\nseems to me, is where the institutions\n\nof religion and of higher education can\n\nbe mightily helpful if they will. All of\n\nthem have a heritage, a tradition to\n\nbe made available to us in our present\n\nvacuum of moral and spiritual re-\n\nsources. We need this wisdom greatly,\n\nfor it can widen our horizons im-\n\nmeasurably and deepen our capacities\n\nincalculably. But these resources are\n\nnot simply lying around the land-\n\nscape waiting to be picked up and put\n\nto work. They are guideposts and\n\nsearchlights, not commodities or pre-\n\ncooked food in tidy antiseptic pack-\n\nages. They must be conveyed and ac-\n\ncepted in the continual dialogue of\n\nfaith with truth, both new and old,\n\nin forms as changing as the needs\n\nthey are meant to serve.\n\nAnd so I come to the last part of\n\nPaul's verse which is of a piece with\n\nthe first. \"Hold fast what is good\"\n\nor, if you prefer Kierkegaard, \"In\n\norder to sew you must first have a\n\nknot in the thread.\" It is by virtue of\n\nthe good we know that we become\n\ncued-in to good as yet unknown but\n\nwished-for; we are not doomed to\n\nendless, fruitless repetition; when the\n\nmind is once drenched about a truth,\n\nor the heart fixed, or the will estab-\n\nlished, we do not have to fight that\n\nbattle all over again. We can go on\n\nfrom where we were to where we\n\nought and really want to be.\n\nWhat is it that you know for sure\n\nand do not have to doubt forever?\n\nWhat is it that you have found good,\n\nso good that neither time nor tide can\n\nseparate you from this assurance? I\n\nam not talking about dogma or\n\nopinions but about the actual knots\n\nby which we sew the fabric of our\n\nlife both personal and corporate. I\n\nam thinking of those things we hold\n\nfast simply because they will not let\n\nus go, the stars by which our course\n\nis set and navigated. They may not\n\nbe very many, nor impressive to out-\n\nsiders, but if they are truly yours that\n\nis enough. It may not even matter too\n\nmuch what you call them or whether\n\nthey have names at all, though it is\n\nprobably better to know what you be-\n\nlieve in than not to know it. and cer-\n\ntainly better than not caring to know\n\nit.\n\nWhen Paul says, \"Hold fast what is\n\ngood\", he is not throwing out some\n\ngeneral advice to whomever happens\n\nto be listening. He is writing as a\n\nChristian to fellow-Christans, shar-\n\ning with them his findings in a troubled\n\nand tangled time. He is giving some\n\nclues as to how life should be lived\n\nwhen the day of the Lord for which\n\nthey have prayed long and earnestly\n\nstill does not come. He reminds them\n\nthat they are not in darkness but\n\nbelong to the day. So too do we, for\n\nwe are Christians, we belong to Christ.\n\nTherefore let us, in like spirit, test\n\neverything and hold fast to what is\n\ngood. Let life be lived for goodness'\n\nsake, but let us be quite sure to live\n\nit, too. If venturesomeness without\n\nsteadfastness is empty, steadfastness\n\nwithout venturesomeness is blind. The\n\nway to wholeness in the person and in\n\nthe world embrace both. Robert Frost\n\nhas a poem about a young man who\n\nleaves home and friends to go his own\n\nway, then comes back much later to\n\nthe place he started from, older and\n\nwiser. He wonders how his family and\n\nfriends will now respond to him, and\n\nhe says, in words which I trust you\n\ncan someday make your own:\n\nThey will not find me changed\n\nfrom him they knew,\n\nOnly more sure of all I thought\n\nwas true.\n\nALUMNAE QUARTERLY / FALL 1%7\n\nDEATHS\n\nFaculty\n\nMaude Montgomery Parry Paul (Mrs. Harvey),\n\nformer chairman of the Physical Education De-\n\npartment, mother of Anna Marie Parry Blanchard\n\n(Mrs. Edwin Howell) '11.

In the summer of 1966 we\n\nestablished the Annual Fund Council, or steering com-\n\nmittee. It is made up of three members of the Board\n\nof Trustees; the Fund Chairman, the President, a vice-\n\npresident, and a member-at-large of the Alumnae Asso-\n\nciation; and from the College's administrative staff, the\n\nPresident, the Director of Development, and the Direc-\n\ntor of Alumnae Affairs. The Council met four times and\n\ngave immeasurably good advice and counsel for the\n\nannual-giving effort aside from their actual work in\n\nthe campaign.\n\nAnother \"first\" was the amount of money contributed\n\nby alumnae (see charts on next pages.) One reason\n\nfor this increase may be your new awareness of Agnes\n\nScott's financial problems and your willingness to help\n\nalleviate them on an annual basis. Sarah Frances\n\nMcDonald '36, Alumnae Fund Chairman, said (in\n\na splendid speech last Alumnae Week End), \"I don't\n\nthink a college which has been a major factor in mold-\n\ning our lives should have to beg for money from its\n\nonly family her alumnae. I believe that if we want\n\nAgnes Scott to continue to make a real contribution to\n\nsociety through us, its products, we should not have\n\nto be asked.

This consumed\n\nenormous staff time and effort in production and\n\nwill you believe, please, it is expensive. But we could\n\nrejoice in the results.

I.The Annual-Giving Program runs on the College's fiscal\n\nyear, July 1-June 30. For example, if you make a contribution on July 10, it is counted in the new year unless you indicate it is\n\nfor the last year. 2. The College Development Office keeps all fund records and makes fund reports (although alumnae form the\n\nbasis of the Annual-Giving Program, there are other divisions in the program alumnae contributions are often the incentive for\n\nother gifts.) 3. The Annual-Giving Program is divided into two parts, the Annual Fund and the Capital Fund. The former goes into\n\ncurrent use, i.e. for increasing faculty salaries. The latter is invested (with other capital funds which the College has known as en-\n\ndowment\" and only the income is used.) An alumna,' for example, may be building a scholarship fund which is a capital fund,\n\nand her contribution to that is so counted. 4. All \"new\" money given within the fiscal year is the total of that annual-giving pro-\n\ngram.

We take great\n\ndelight in announcing that there were nineteen found-\n\ning members of The Tower Circle here are special\n\nthanks to them, and \"may your tribe increase.\"\n\nFerdinand Warren, chairman of the art department\n\nand a nationally recognized painter, created a seri-\n\ngraph (or silk-screen color print) of an artist's view of\n\nthe tower of Main Building, for each of the charter\n\nmembers. The colors are dark green and light blue\n\non a white background which means Mr. Warren\n\nused two silk screens and did each print individually, so\n\nthe founding members have an \"original\" Warren. The\n\nprints were presented at an informal luncheon at the\n\nCollege and others were mailed to out-of-town\n\nmembers.\n\n(We did have fun soliciting these alumnae. Some\n\nwere aghast, thinking that we meant making a com-\n\nmitment of $1,000 or more a year \"from here to\n\neternity\" we didn't, because this is an annual-giving\n\nprogram; all seemed flattered to be asked for this\n\namount of money, whether or not they could give it.\n\nIn the Greater Atlanta area, twenty alumnae volunteers\n\ncame to a training meeting, then personally solicited\n\nthis special group, so hearty thanks are due them and\n\nthey report good visits and conversations.)\n\nFor 1967-68, this year, in addition to The Tower\n\nCircle, the Annual Fund Council has announced the\n\nformation of other fund leadership groups, or clubs.\n\nWe have wracked our brains to name them and trust\n\nyou will approve. They are:\n\nThe Mainliners: those alumnae who contribute $100\n\nor more to The Fund this year\n\nQuadrangle Quorum: those who contribute $250\n\nor more\n\nColonnade Club: those who contribute $500 or more.\n\nAlso, this year, as many of you are already aware,\n\nwe are deep in organizing each alumnae class with a\n\nnumber of Fund Agents so that classmates will be\n\nwriting each other, literally all over the world, about\n\ngiving to the 1967-68 Agnes Scott Fund.\n\nWhether you become a \"Mainliner\" join The Quad-\n\nrangle Quorum, The Colonnade Club, The Tower Cir-\n\ncle, or make any contribution as generous as your own\n\ncircumstances will permit, please be assured that your\n\ngift to the 1967-68 Agnes Scott Fund is vital.

In the Administration, the new Col-\n\nlege Treasurer, Mr. William H. Hannah, comes to us\n\nfrom the position of Comptroller at the University of\n\nPennsylvania (see p. 21).\n\nWe offer hearty words of welcome to each of these\n\npeople and some special words to Dianne Snead Gil-\n\nchrist '60 who has joined the staff in the Alumnae Office\n\nas Class News Editor for The Quarterly and Assistant in\n\nthe Office. (Margaret Dowe Cobb '22 remains as the\n\nAlumnae House Manager.)\n\nThe first academic occasion in the college calendar is\n\nHonors' Day when students are recognized for various\n\nkinds of intellectual achievement during the last session.\n\nThis is done at a Convocation, and a guest speaker is in-\n\nvited to give the Honors' Day address.\n\nOn September 27 Dr. Felix C. Robb, director, Southern\n\nAssociation of Colleges and Schools, spoke on \"Woman\n\nPower, Fact or Fancy?\" We asked him if we might pub-\n\nlish his speech in this magazine, but he did not have it in\n\nmanuscript form. Sally Gaines, a reporter for Atlanta\n\nnewspapers, interviewed him and wrote a feature story\n\nwhich appeared in The Atlanta Journal and Constitution\n\nSunday, October 29. I shall use her quotes from Dr.\n\nRobb's address and interview.\n\nHis deep concern is with the fact that American col-\n\nlege women, educated women with trained and enlightened\n\nminds, are much too often today devoting themselves to\n\n\"trivia\" rather than to responsible leadership in their com-\n\nmunities. He believes that this kind of woman power is\n\nthe most important latent force in the world today, but it\n\nneeds to be \"exercised.\"\n\n\"Many of the obstacles in the career fields have been\n\nreduced for women, but I don't think women as a whole\n\nare taking advantage of it. Women are reluctant about en-\n\ntering politics. They are timid about economics and busi-\n\nness. Too few think about anything but the bridge club\n\nand Dr. Spock.\"\n\nWith a sense of urgency Dr. Robb said to Agnes Scott\n\nstudents, \"You have been dubbed the 'new' generation.\n\nNow, then, is the time for you to reveal what you can do\n\nto change, improve, reformulate, reorganize, renovate and\n\nrestore a frayed, fragmented and fearful society. This is\n\nthe age of youth with power in the hands of those twenty-\n\nsix and under. To be non-involved is worthless.\"\n\nHe recognized that today's mores, particularly early\n\nmarriage, often premature, does not allow time in late\n\nadolescence for a young woman to evolve a value system\n\nof her own, so that she adapts herself to her husband's\n\noutlook and attitude at the expense of her own intellectual\n\ngrowth.\n\n\"You women are the mothers of mankind and the cen-\n\ntral force in shaping the home, but that's where you stop.\n\nYou can vote, but it's a rusty tool. You are rich. Seventy\n\npercent of the nation's private wealth is in your hands,\n\nchiefly because you outlive males. But do women use the\n\nwealth in the best way?\n\n\"Women are notoriously poor supporters of institutions\n\nfor higher learning. The ashes of women's colleges which\n\nhave merged or closed are proof. Women are sentimental\n\nabout their alma maters but not likely to act on it. (italics\n\nmine)\n\n\"Do not retreat. Get involved in community life. I'm not\n\nsuggesting neglecting your home and children. There must\n\nbe a balance. But we can't afford to have one enlightened\n\nwoman hide her lights under a bushel. The world is coming\n\napart at the seams.\n\n\"You have allowed yourselves to become much manip-\n\nulated. Cosmetic manufacturers and clothing stylists are\n\nbut two influences that come to mind. Don't fall into the\n\ntrap of trivia. One of the finest examples of responsible\n\nconcern and the democratic processes is the League of\n\nWomen Voters. Of course there are others, too.\n\n\"Also, if you don't participate, your rights, which, this\n\ngeneration did not fight for, will tend to wither.

PEPPERDENE\n\nThe traditional topic for a talk on\n\nsuch an occasion as this, when a\n\ncommunity of scholars come together\n\nto honor academic achievement, is the\n\nvalue and meaning of a liberal educa-\n\ntion: how it frees the mind from pro-\n\nvincialism and prejudice; how it gives\n\nthe individual a sense of values and\n\nof direction; and how it restores to\n\nhim an awareness of what Howard\n\nLowry calls the \"human privilege,\" by\n\nwhich he means\n\nthe opportunity offered to a person\n\nto seek and obtain the fullest mean-\n\ning he can for his own life to\n\nknow the best he can know, and to\n\nlive by that best against all com-\n\ners . . .; the privilege to learn to use\n\nhis own mind rather than just\n\nsomebody else's mind; to judge and\n\nchoose and renounce and, if possible,\n\ncreate . . .; to live not just off the\n\nquestionnaires and burgeoning sta-\n\ntistics of his own age, but out of\n\nhistory and the significant hours of\n\nhuman imagination.\n\nThese are words one is accustomed to\n\nhear in an \"honor's day\" talk; and\n\nthey are words which evoke rich as-\n\nsociations from those who can take\n\ntheir \"tame abstractness\" back to the\n\n\"wild particulars\" (to use Donald\n\nDavidson's words) from which they\n\nhave come, who can recall significant\n\nhours of the imagination the \"call of\n\nthe tall nun\" in the \"black-about air\"\n\nof the foundering Deutschland, the\n\nintoxicating moment when Criseyde\n\nfalls in love with Troilus (\"who yaf\n\nme drinke\"). Dr. Rieux's words to\n\nTarrou; \"Heroism and sanctity don't\n\nreally appeal to me . . . What interests\n\nme is being a man.\" These are the\n\nkinds of words that have for genera-\n\ntions expressed the deepest realities\n\nof the intellectual life for those who\n\n\"gladly teche\" and the aspirations of\n\nthose who just as \"gladly lerne.\"\n\nYet, anyone who has read a news-\n\npaper, magazine, or learned journal\n\nin education, who has listened to a\n\nradio or watched a television newscast,\n\nor who has just been on a college cam-\n\npus during the past two years knows\n\nthat these words about the meaning\n\nand value of an education are not be-\n\ning heard any more. They are being\n\nsaid; we have had a parade of speak-\n\ners at Agnes Scott who have elo-\n\nquently extolled the gifts of the liberal\n\neducation. But one gets the distinct\n\nimpression that what they have said is\n\nmore a comfort to the faculty than a\n\nchallenge to the student, more an in-\n\nvitation to remember than incentive to\n\nrespond.\n\nStudents all over the country have\n\nbeen making clear the felt absence\n\nfrom their educational experience of\n\n\"those significant hours of the human\n\nimagination.\" A young woman at the\n\nUniversity of Georgia, Miss B. J.\n\nPhillips, in a recent column in The\n\nAtlanta Constitution, puts the problem\n\nunder the metaphor of academic\n\n\"languages,\" saying that she is looking\n\nforward to the day she applies for\n\nher first job because, as she says\n\nwhen I come to the blank that says,\n\n\"List the languages which you can\n\nspeak and/ or write,\" I'm going to\n\nhave a field day. I'll get to list\n\npolitical science, sociology, psychol-\n\nogy, economics, education, history,\n\netc., etc., until I finish the list of all\n\n(Continued on next page)\n\nALUMNAE QUARTERLY / WINTER 1%8\n\nAbout the author: Jane Pepperdcne\n\n(B.S. Louisiana State University; M.A.,\n\nPh.D. Vanderbilt University) joined the\n\nEnglish faculty in 1956. She is now\n\nprofessor of English and chairman of\n\nthe department. Students consider it a\n\nhigh and joyous privilege to study with\n\nher. One parent said, during the recent\n\nSophomore Parents' Week End, \"Mrs.\n\nPepperdene, that wasn't just a lecture\n\nyou gave us that was a performance!\"\n\nThis article was an address she made\n\nfor Honors Day at Georgia Southern\n\nCollege, May 8, 1967.\n\nA Different\n\nDrummer\n\n(Continued)\n\nacademic departments and fields of\n\nstudy that I've encountered in four\n\nyears of college. It isn't funny. In\n\norder to succeed in a given course,\n\nyou've got to speak the language,\n\nthe jargon. You've got to learn that\n\n\"a conceptual understanding\" in\n\npolitical science is \"an overview\"\n\nin education. These are the same\n\nthings as \"knowledge of the histori-\n\ncal tendencies\" but don't try to slip\n\none department's terminology on\n\nanother's test. That proves you have\n\n\"failed to grasp the significant facts\n\nand understand the basic assump-\n\ntions.\" . . . The thing that really\n\nbothers me is that all this jargonism\n\nis symptomatic of a bigger, more\n\nserious problem the diversive na-\n\nture of education today. Sociologists\n\nexplain man within the context of\n\nhis social organizations; the political\n\nscientist seeks to define his life in\n\nterms of his government; the econo-\n\nmist tells us that it is money, goods,\n\nand trade that make him behave as\n\nhe does. All this is fine. But what\n\nhappened to the whole man?

Butter-\n\nfield, president of Wesleyan Univer-\n\nsity. In a recent address to the Asso-\n\nciation of American Colleges President\n\nButterfield says of the student move-\n\nment at Berkeley,\n\n. . . behind the more dramatic dis-\n\nplay and shouting about personal\n\nand political rights were the even\n\nmore important but quieter voices\n\nof students complaining of their\n\nstatus as IBM cards and protesting.\n\ndespite, mind you. one of the most\n\ndistinguished faculties in the world,\n\nthat the education they were getting\n\nwas \"irrelevant.\" Moreover, these\n\nstudents were mainly nor, as popu-\n\nlar image had it. the \"beats\" or the\n\nself-appointed \"protestors\" or the\n\n\"hangers-on\" of the extramural\n\ncommunity. They were mostly the\n\ncream of the Berkeley student crop\n\nbright, doing their work and get-\n\nting good grades, strong in personal\n\nqualities of character and leader-\n\nship.\n\nRobert M. Hutchins. addressing the\n\ngraduating class of the University of\n\nChicago a few weeks ago. attacked the\n\nconcentration of education on meet-\n\ning the immediate needs of society,\n\nas the most powerful pressure\n\ngroups interpret them, by the meth-\n\nods that appeal to those pressure\n\ngroups, namely, training, informa-\n\ntion, and service.\n\nAdding that this concentration is \"ob-\n\nviously the direct opposite of what\n\nthe times require.\" he warned the\n\nstudents:\n\nthe danger that will threaen you in\n\nthe next 25 years is sclerosis, of the\n\nimagination, the vision, the charac-\n\nter, the mind and the heart.\n\nEasy explanations of the student\n\nrevolt \"it's part of growing up.\" \"stu-\n\ndents never know what they want.\"\n\n\"students are basically anti-intellec-\n\ntual.\" are thus being dismissed by re-\n\nsponsible educators as \"questionable\n\ncliches that hardly seem to get at the\n\nTHE AG\\ES SCOTT\n\nformula for engaging the human being in the act of learning\n\nheart of the matter.\" Instead, there\n\nhas been a flurry of academic activity\n\nparalleling the wave of student discon-\n\ntent. Students themselves are setting\n\nup free universities; faculties and ad-\n\nministrators are adjusting curricula,\n\nintroducing \"enriched\" courses, and\n\ninterdepartmental seminars, inaugurat-\n\ning \"wonderful Wednesdays\" (and\n\nsometimes \"terrific Tuesdays\" and\n\n\"marvelous Mondays\" as well). And\n\neveryone, it seems, is evaluating the\n\nteacher. President Hutchins has sug-\n\ngested the creation of an entirely new\n\nsort of institution in which students\n\nand faculty engage in a common en-\n\nterprise of thinking perhaps a little\n\nlike his own Center for Study of\n\nDemocratic Institutions. So far, these\n\nefforts have been more a way of di-\n\nverting attention from the problem\n\nthan of dealing with it. And, it seems\n\nto me unlikely that they will ever pro-\n\nvide what the students are asking for\n\nand what the honest educator knows\n\nthey need; what is missing from the\n\nlearning experience can hardly be re-\n\nstored by gimmicks by altering this\n\ncourse or adding that one, by cutting\n\ndown the number of class days, or\n\nby introducing more interdepartmental\n\ncourses. There is no magic formula\n\nfor engaging the human being in the\n\nact of learning. [A piece in a current\n\nNew Yorker makes a splendid com-\n\nmentary on abortive academic efforts\n\nto \"challenge\" students and '\"interre-\n\nlate\" courses in the curriculum. Here\n\nare some excerpts from an \"imagi-\n\nnary, handsomely printed course bulle-\n\ntin\": ( 1 ) \"Yeats and Hygiene, a Com-\n\nparative Study: the poetry of William\n\nButler Yeats analyzed against a back-\n\nground of proper dental care. (Course\n\nopen to a limited number of stu-\n\ndents.)\" (2) \"Philosophy XXIX-B:\n\nIntroduction to God. Confrontation\n\nwith the Creator of the universe\n\nthrough informal lectures and field\n\ntrips.\" (3) And there is another se-\n\nquence, suited to the notoriously dis-\n\ncontented student: \"Introduction to\n\nHostility; Intermediate Hostility; Ad-\n\nvanced Hatred; Theoretical Founda-\n\ntions of Loathing.\"]\n\nWhat has not been recognized in\n\nthe complaints of students, the cri-\n\ntiques of educators, and the frantic\n\nmanipulation of curriculum and sched-\n\nules is the reality we all seem loathe to\n\naccept, the reality that our college and\n\nuniversities in their serious and suc-\n\ncessful attempt to prepare the student\n\nfor an economically profiitable life in\n\ncontemporary society have brought\n\nthe special character of that society\n\nright into the academic institution it-\n\nself. However separate some students\n\nmay feel from the world outside the\n\ncollege, the first fact of modern aca-\n\ndemic life is that the college is no\n\nlonger the ivory tower into which a\n\nrelatively few intellectually favored or\n\neconomically privileged young men\n\nand women can withdraw to devote\n\nthemselves to four years of leisurely\n\nstudy of the arts and sciences. The\n\ndiversity, the specialization, the mech-\n\nanization which characterize the soci-\n\nety we live in also describe the univer-\n\nsities we teach and study in; our col-\n\nleges are just as computerized as our\n\nbusinesses and our campuses just as\n\nhectic and crowded as our cities. The\n\nworlds of the town and gown have\n\nmerged into the one world, the city.\n\nAnd since the academic community is\n\na microcosm of our modern, techno-\n\nlogical, urban society, it inevitably\n\nshares with that society its most char-\n\nacteristic feature: its un if not anti\n\nhumanness. Some years ago Paul Til-\n\nlich defined precisely the \"special char-\n\nacter of (our) contemporary culture\"\n\nand he warned of the way such a cul-\n\nture jeopardizes man's humanity. He\n\nsaid that under industrialism man has\n\nmade a progressive conquest of nature,\n\nboth inside and outside himself, but\n\nthat in the process\n\nhe has become a part of the reality\n\nhe has created, an object among ob-\n\njects, a thing among things, a cog\n\nwithin a universal machine to which\n\nhe must adapt himself in order not\n\nto be smashed by it. But this adap-\n\ntation makes him a means for ends\n\nwhich are means themselves, and in\n\nwhich an ultimate end is lacking.\n\nOut of this predicament of man in\n\nthe industrial society the experi-\n\nences of emptiness and meaningless-\n\nness, of dehumanization and es-\n\ntrangement have resulted.\n\nTillich's words describe the society\n\ninside and outside the university; there\n\nis no longer any difference. And this\n\nis what the students are really re-\n\nbelling against; it is what we all re-\n\ncoil from. None of us wants to be a\n\ncog in a machine, an IBM card, or\n\nto become part of a system legal,\n\nmedical, governmental at the cost\n\nof being a man.\n\nIf we can see the student rebellion\n\nas a verbalizing of the anxiety felt\n\nby all of us who refuse to accept man\n\nas a mere thing, who fear that the\n\nmachine will reduce man to thinghood\n\nwhere he will cease acting, or even\n\nbeing able to act, like a responsible\n\nmoral being, then we can perhaps get\n\na more comprehensive view of the\n\nstudent movement, one that can sug-\n\ngest a way of dealing with a problem\n\nthat touches us all. Wc will see that\n\nthe problem is not just an academic\n\none. It has been given its most vehe-\n\nment expression in the universities be-\n\ncause of an intuitive awareness on\n\nthe part of old and young alike that if\n\nthese places which preserve, interpret,\n\nand recreate the history and meaning\n\nof the human experience succumb to\n\nthe dehumanizing influences of our\n\ntechnical age, the only barrier between\n\nmanhood and thinghood will crumble.\n\nFrom this new perspective we can\n\nmore accurately evaluate the charges\n\nof the critics of the academic com-\n\nmunity B. J. Phillips' plea that some-\n\none find the whole man who got lost in\n\nthe shuffle, Savio's reminder that stu-\n\ndents have to repress their \"most cre-\n\native impulses\" to get along in the\n\nuniversity environment, Hutchins' pre-\n\ndiction about the sclerosis of the imag-\n\nination.\n\nAn equally important implication of\n\nthese quarrels with things as they are\n\nin the present university is the faith\n\nthat the university not only has been\n\nbut that it can and must continue to\n\nbe the place where man's creative\n\npowers are evoked, nurtured, and\n\ncherished, where the imagination can\n\nfollow \"trails that slip around tech-\n\nnology/To gulfs of ferns and banks of\n\nmemory\" where one can find Miss\n\nPhillips' whole man. This faith calls\n\n(Continued on next page)\n\nAtUMNAE QUARTERLY / WINTER 1968\n\nA Different Drummer\n\n(Continued)\n\non everyone who teaches and all who\n\nlearn to recover, if necessary, and to\n\nreassert the primary function of any\n\nacademic institution: to foster the idea\n\nof learning as a creative act, an act\n\nso vivid and personal that it can com-\n\nprehend, and perhaps emulate, Keats'\n\nexperience where the wonder of a\n\nnight of reading is an act of personal\n\ndiscovery, of finding his own El\n\nDorado, his own \"new planet,\" his\n\nown vast Pacific.\n\nThis then is the place to begin: with\n\nthe recognition that there is no essen-\n\ntial difference between what Brecht\n\ncalls \"this buzzing confusion\" of the\n\nworld outside the college and that\n\nwithin its walls; and with the aware-\n\nness that the only force which can\n\norder this confusion is man in his\n\ncreative capacity, man whose imagi-\n\nnation can put a shape on \"this mess\"\n\n(Brecht's inelegantly vivid term) and\n\ngive it meaning. Admittedly, this hold-\n\ning is a small one from which to\n\nlaunch so major an offsensive as the\n\nrecovery of life in learning; but aware-\n\nness is the beginning of wisdom. It\n\nwould be nice if we could take Presi-\n\ndent Hutchins' suggestion to create\n\nan institution where a community of\n\nselected scholars young and old could\n\ncome together \"in the search for un-\n\nderstanding;\" hut Edenic simplicities\n\nare not really one of the possibles in\n\ncontemporary life. We begin where we\n\nare, not where we would like to be\n\nor might have been.\n\nThe possible itself is not without a\n\nchallenge. If learning is a creative\n\nact, if it is the imaginative possession\n\nof those things which man has said\n\nand done through the ages, the task of\n\nthe student (and I use the term to in-\n\nclude all who \"gladly lerne\" and\n\n\"gladly teche\") in the present-day col-\n\nlege or university is to accept the\n\ngivens and to exert a conscious and\n\npositive effort to create new meaning\n\nout of what has become fragmented\n\nand meaningless. His task is not unlike\n\nthat of the artist in contemporary\n\nsociety. In the same essay referred to\n\nearlier, Tillich talks about the role of\n\nthe artist and he says that artists to-\n\nday \"show in their style both the\n\nencounter with non-being and the\n\nstrength which can stand this encoun-\n\nter and shape it creatively.\" Recog-\n\nnizing what R. W. B. Lewis calls \"the\n\nseverance of the relation between man\n\nand whatever reality he is willing to\n\nacknowledge,\" encountering Graham\n\nGreene's \"sinless empty graceless chro-\n\nmium world\" of modern civilized so-\n\nciety, facing the ultimate isolation of\n\nthe human condition, and admitting the\n\nravages on the human psyche made by\n\nan increasingly mechanized culture.\n\nthe contemporary artist has taken the\n\ngiven life itself and tried to find\n\nthere some reason for existence. He\n\ndoes not do as his Joycean forbears\n\ndid. escape into art and call it \"life.\"\n\nnor does he exclude the annihilating\n\nand literally dehumanizing experi-\n\nences that are part of life as he finds\n\nit perversion, sickness, death. They\n\nare everywhere but they are not all of\n\nlife. And the serious artist refuses to\n\nsee the human condition as all sick-\n\nness and death, refuses to reduce the\n\nhuman being to a thing contemplating\n\nhis mortality, as if that were all that it\n\nmeans to be human. The principle to\n\nwhich the artist ultimately subscribes\n\nis that expressed by Henry James:\n\nThe poet essentially can't be con-\n\ncerned with dying. Let him deal\n\nwith the sickest of the sick, it is\n\nstill by the act of living that they\n\nappeal to him, and appeal the more\n\nas the conditions plot against them\n\nand prescribe the battle. The pro-\n\ncess of life gives way fighting, and\n\noften may so shine out on the lost\n\nground as in no other connection.\n\nWith the \"man who gives way fight-\n\ning\" even, or especially, when condi-\n\ntions plot against him and prescribe\n\nthe battle, the artist has always been\n\nconcerned. One recalls the Beowulf-\n\npoet who sings of heroes, haelep under\n\nheofenum, doomed to defeat in a hos-\n\ntile universe, dying on their own terms\n\nso that their bravery and courage\n\nshine out on the lost ground. One\n\nthinks of the whiskey-priest of Greene's\n\nThe Power and the Glory who rec-\n\nognizes during his one night imprison-\n\nment in the squalid, stinking cell in\n\nTabasco the image of God shining\n\nthrough the degraded human counte-\n\nnances all around him; this warmth\n\nof fellow-feeling gives him the strength\n\nto endure his mission and finally to\n\nprevail over the forces of death, even\n\nhis own. And one is reminded of all\n\nthose Hemingway people in whom\n\n\"life gives way fighting\": the waiter\n\nin A Clean Well-Lighted Place who\n\nlives with the knowledge thai the cafe.\n\na clean, well-lighted place, made by\n\nman, is man's only refuge against the\n\ndark: of Jake Barnes who endures his\n\nemasculation without letting it jeopar-\n\ndize his manhood: of the major in In\n\nAnother Country whose iron will con-\n\nceals a powerful passion and whose\n\nendurance exceeds mere bravery.\n\nHemingway's heroes are lonely, their\n\nworld alien and frightening and hos-\n\ntile; but they live in it on their own\n\nterms and they are men.\n\nWe could labor the analogy but\n\nthere is no need. The parallel is clear.\n\nAll the forces that kill or disease the\n\nhuman spirit are in the academic\n\nworld just as they are everywhere else:\n\nIBM cards, television teaching, and\n\nthe pieces of man broken on depart-\n\nmental wheels. With the knowledge\n\nthat his world is \"all in pieces, all co-\n\nherence gone.\" the student has to find\n\nthe strength to stand the encounter\n\nwith it. to shape that encounter cre-\n\natively, and thereby put the pieces of\n\nhumpty-dumpty man back together\n\nagain. Concerned with living, with\n\nthose acts of man that will never die.\n\nhe cannot let this concern be lost or\n\ndissipated by his dealings with man's\n\nmortal needs. As Einstein once said.\n\nThe concern of man and his destiny\n\nmust always be the chief interest of\n\nall technical effort. Never forget it\n\namong your diagrams and equa-\n\ntions.\n\nThe student will find the difficulty of\n\nhis task to make a \"stay against con-\n\nfusion\" is eased by his discovery of\n\nthose \"clean, well-lighted places\"\n\nwhich are an arrest of disorder in\n\nman's disorderly history: Lear meas-\n\nuring himself against the rain and\n\nthunder of the heath; Mathilda of Tus-\n\ncany leading her knights in battle to\n\ndefend her fief: Pietro Spina, in the\n\nfilthy hovel of the deaf mute, finding\n\nnourishment of the spirit in their\n\nshared bread. These encounters can\n\nbe for the student his moments in a\n\nrose garden; they can provide him\n\nwith the perspective from which, in\n\nHoward Lowry's words.\n\nto examine and make reflective\n\ncommitments to principles that will\n\nexist for him beyond all conveni-\n\nence and group pressures, bevond\n\nall the strategy and passing fashions\n\nof the world: to hear beyond the\n\ncommon noises of his time, the old\n\nConcord music of \"a different\n\ndrummer.\"\n\nIt is this possibility that we honor\n\ntoday. a.\n\nTHE ACNES SCOTT\n\nDEATHS\n\nFaculty\n\nMrs. Raymond Bishop, formerly in the Art De-\n\npartment, February, 1967.\n\nMiss Melissa Annis Cilley, former assistant pro-\n\nfessor of Spanish, lanuary 31, 1968.\n\nDr. S.

She is the daughter of Susan Self Teat '41 and\n\nJim, from Charlotte, N.C. Her delight in spending her junior\n\nyear abroad is reflected in this article. Watch for another\n\nimpression of such programs in the next issue of\n\nthe Quarterly.\n\nA close friend of mine likes to compare the effect of\n\nFrance upon me to that of L.S.D. upon the hippie,\n\nmeaning that France \"turns me on.\" The comparison\n\nis good to the extent that a year spent in France\n\nheightened my sensibility, broadened my understand-\n\ning of a great many things, and certainly brought me\n\nface to face with a world which was, as Marivaux de-\n\nscribed it in La Vie de Marianne, new, but not at all\n\nforeign to me. The comparison breaks down, however,\n\nin that the L.S.D. \"trip\" is temporary and often de-\n\nstructive; whereas, the J.Y.F. (Junior Year in France)\n\n\"trip\" is enduring and most constructive. To presup-\n\npose, however, that a year in France has made me an\n\nauthority on either the French family, the French edu-\n\ncational system, or the heart of French life, Paris, is\n\nbeyond all reason. I did, however, have a \"Iovin' spoon-\n\nful\" of these aspects of French life through my year in\n\nFrance with the Sweet Briar College program, and, as\n\nthe taste still lingers, I am always happy to try to share\n\nmy impressions of them.\n\nThe American student who goes to France to live\n\nwith and become part of a French family is invariably\n\ndisappointed. The relationship of an American student\n\nto the French family is primarily that of a boarder to\n\nhis landlord. Only in rare cases does the American\n\nform any lasting bonds with his family. This is not to\n\nsay that the French family is openly hostile to the\n\nboarder; however, no effort is made to make him a\n\npart of the family. Such a lack of integration into\n\nFrench family life is not offensive to the student for\n\ntwo reasons. First, when rapport is established between\n\nthe student and family, the student feels as if it is a\n\nsincere feeling rather than a hypocritical concern for\n\nthe \"foreign\" student. Secondly, the independence from\n\nthe family is one of the rewards of the Junior Year in\n\nFrance. One is integrated into neither the French so-\n\nciety nor the American society. In this situation, the\n\nresponsibility that one feels is genuine rather than\n\nimposed by society.\n\nI was extremely happy in my family situations both\n\nin Tours and in Paris. My \"provincial\" family was\n\nformidable. Monsieur Berard, a retired army colonel,\n\nwas tall, white-haired, and awe-inspiring: the type of\n\nman whom one would choose to play God giving Moses\n\nthe Ten Commandments in a Sunday-School play. He\n\nruled everyone in the household except Madame Berard.\n\nThe three children of the home were all of college age.\n\nMichel and Jean-Pierre were handsome young men\n\nALUMNAE QUARTERLY / WINTER 1968\n\nIllustrated by Ike Hussey\n\nJunior Year in Paris\n\n(Continued)\n\nwho, by virtue of being the first French men I knew,\n\nwere the first French men to capture my heart. Fran-\n\nchise, my French \"sister, - ' was a warm girl who remains\n\nthe closest French friend that I have.\n\nMy Parisian family and home were as Parisian as\n\nthe Berards were provincial. Original Riiysdael and\n\nVan Goyen paintings decorated the living room which\n\nwas itself a complement to Madame Renaudin. my\n\nhostess in Paris. She was a tall and dignified woman\n\nwho held our attention with the stories of her school\n\ndays with Simone de Beauvoir. Although I am still\n\nquite fond of the Renaudin family, I do not retain the\n\nclose ties with them which I retain with the Berards.\n\nOne of the Renaudin grandchildren. Manu. age seven.\n\ndid, however, propose marriage to me and I must re-\n\nturn to Paris after sixteen years to fulfill my promises\n\nto him. Therefore, although the relationship between\n\nan American student and his French family is not the\n\nequivalent of the relationship between an exchange stu-\n\ndent and his family, it can be a rewarding relationship.\n\nA second important aspect of my year in France is\n\nthe formal study at the University of Paris and with\n\nSweet Briar College. The French university system\n\nlends itself to independent study rather than to daily\n\nassignments. Any grades were the result of one paper\n\nand/or one report in class and a final examination\n\nmade up of a written and oral examination. There were\n\nno day-to-day assignments since most classes were\n\npurely lecture classes with from fifty to 3000 in the\n\nclass.\n\nEveryone who has spent a year of study in Paris\n\nis asked whether he has studied at the Sorbonne. The\n\nname of this thirteenth-century citadel is known to\n\nmost educated Americans, even if they are not quite\n\nsure what the words la Sorbonne designate. I was lucky\n\nto be able to take a course at the Sorbonne. lucky not\n\nonly because my professor, M. Antoine Adam, was\n\nexcellent nor because it is prestigious to have studied\n\nthere, but because a course at the Sorbonne is a circus\n\nin itself. After having spent hours figuring which course\n\nI wanted and what the course really is (course titles\n\nare seldom a good indication of what the course is\n\nabout), I plowed through 3000 other students to find\n\na place between an Indochinese nun and a Swedish\n\nblond \"bombshell\" in the last crowded row of an over-\n\nflowing amphitheater, only to be told by the professor\n\nthat the class was too large and that all first year and\n\nforeign students must leave. After having fought so\n\nhard for a place in the course. 1 refused to leave, as\n\n(Continued on next page)\n\nAnn caught Fans spreading to infinity.\n\n*\n\n^k'\n\nJunior Year in Paris\n\nfa \"B'rroTf\n\n(Continued)\n\ndid most foreign students. The first day of a class at\n\nthe Sorbonne is an education in itself!\n\nI took another course at another branch of the Uni-\n\nversity of Paris, the Institute of Political Studies. What\n\na contrast! Here, classes were no larger than 200 peo-\n\nple. The students wore suits and ties to all classes, and\n\nthe atmosphere was one of serious study. Perhaps the\n\nmain reason for my preference of \"Science Po\" over\n\nthe Sorbonne is that at Science Po there was a ratio\n\nof 10 men to every woman a fact not to be discounted\n\nwhen the student has spent the first two years of col-\n\nlege in a woman's college.\n\nMy two favorite courses were Art History and Con-\n\ntemporary Theater, courses conducted by French pro-\n\nfessors but sponsored by Sweet Briar. In the course in\n\nart history, we studied nineteenth and twentieth cen-\n\ntury painting in class but spent two hours a week of\n\nformal study in the Louvre museum, the Jeu de Paume,\n\nand the Museum of Modern Art. What a perfect city\n\nin which to study art! Added to the weekly museum\n\nvisits were the special exhibitions such as the Vermeer\n\nor Bonnard exhibitions, the Picasso exhibition at the\n\nGrand Palais with 800 of his works, or the psychedelic\n\n\"Light and Movement\" exhibition at the Museum of\n\nModern Art.\n\nThe course on the modern theater was taught by\n\nM. Alfred Simon, a critic in Paris who is presently\n\nteaching at the University of Kentucky. There were\n\ntwo aspects to this course: The first was the study of\n\nFrench theater from the texts including plays by such\n\nauthors as Musset, Claudel, Giraudoux, Sartre, Ionesco,\n\nBeckett, Genet. This study was supplemented by the\n\nplays we saw. We attended at least one performance\n\neach week. These magical evenings were spent seeing\n\nplays by Brecht, Shakespeare, or Giraudoux at the\n\nlarge National Popular Theater or avant-garde drama\n\nin the pocket theaters of Montmartre or Montparnasse.\n\nIn his novel. Le Pere Goriot, Honore de Balzac\n\npaints the portrait of a student in Paris whose school\n\nwas really the city itself. This is the delightful situation\n\nof the student on the Junior Year in France. A great\n\ndeal of his education takes place outside the amphi-\n\ntheater at the Sorbonne or the library at 4 rue de\n\nChevreuse. The student learns in a crowded subway\n\ncar, in a small theater, in a public garden, or walking\n\ndown Boid' Mich.\n\nA kaleidoscope of adventures this is what Paris is\n\nall about. Balzac describes the phenomenon thus:\n\n. . . but, then, Paris is in truth an ocean that no\n\nline can plumb. You may survey its surface and\n\ndescribe it; but no matter what pains you take with\n\nyour investigations and recognizances, no matter\n\nhow numerous and painstaking the toilers in this\n\nsea, there will always be lonely and unexplored\n\nregions in its depths, caverns unknown, flowers\n\nand pearls and monsters of the deep overlooked or\n\nforgotten bv the divers of literature. [Honore de\n\nBalzac, Old Goriot (New York. 1900). p. 350.]\n\nThe student can hear the Paris Opera Troupe present\n\nGounod's Faust or attend a concert by Charles Azna-\n\nvour or the Rolling Stones at the Olympia. He can\n\nstudy the works of Van der Weyden. Raphael or David\n\nat the Louvre or those of Picasso, Villon, or Singier at\n\nthe Modern Art Museum. He may dance at a ball at\n\nNeuilly or in Jacky's Far West Saloon on the left bank.\n\nHe can eat hamburgers at the American Embassy or\n\nbeignets in the Luxemburg Gardens. The choice is his\n\nand he has only to make it.\n\nI do hope that I have been able to give you a taste\n\nof my \"lovin\" spoonful\" of what Ernest Hemingway\n\ncalled \"a moveable feast.\" As one of my fellow JYFers\n\nsaid, we only regret that we cannot stav for seconds.\n\nTHE ACNES SCOTT\n\nWorthy Notes\n\n^Meanwhile, Back at the Ranch . . .\"\n\nBeing on the other side of thirty, I find the \"generation\n\ngap\" yawning ever wider before me.

Knowing I was to\n\naddress you, by unanimous vote my Board adopted\n\nthis resolution:\n\nWe salute Agnes Scott College upon the cele-\n\nbration of her seventy-eighth anniversary. We\n\napplaud the position of leadership which Agnes\n\nScott has occupied for many decades in the liberal\n\neducation of young women, and we wish the Col-\n\nlege every success as she plans for the years ahead.\n\nWe realize that all independent colleges face\n\ngrievous problems and not least colleges for\n\nwomen but we have full confidence that Agnes\n\nScott will meet every challenge that will confront\n\nher and will move forward with strength. We have\n\nexpressly charged the President of Wilson College\n\nto bear this greeting and this message to the faculty\n\nand students of Agnes Scott College on this seven-\n\nty-eighth Founder's Day.\n\nSeventy-eight years are a long span of time. For a\n\nfew minutes so brief by comparison to seventy-eight\n\nyears I wish to talk to you about the importance of\n\nthe inner life. You must judge, when I am done,\n\nwhether seventy-eight years have dulled or enhanced\n\nthe importance of the inner lift. After all, the founders\n\nmay have believed in its importance (and 1 am sure\n\nthey did) and you may not; or you may agree that the\n\ninner life, like all life, is something with which we\n\nmust reckon.\n\nFirst, there is a topic that may seem to have no\n\nbearing on the inner life. But I beg you to suspend\n\njudgment. Let us contemplate for a moment the sub-\n\nject of communication. And then let us work forward.\n\nIn recent years we have been told again and again\n\nby critics and commentators that one of the principal\n\nweaknesses of our time is lack of communication. This\n\nargument runs that labor and management do not talk\n\ntogether; that government does not explain itself ade-\n\nquately to the governed; that an unbridgeable gap\n\nexists between parents and children because they do\n\nnot communicate; that the Pentagon will not talk to\n\nthe State Department, or the Stock Exchange to the\n\ninvestor, or yet, the corporation with its stockholders.\n\nIn the same way we are told that faculties do not com-\n\nmunicate with student bodies or administrations with\n\nfaculties. Mao Tse-tung will not speak to Mr. Kosygin,\n\nand hence Communist unity is threatened. General De\n\nGaulle will talk to anyone, but will listen to no one.\n\nLack of communication perhaps reaches its greatest\n\nexpression in the familiar jingle:\n\nHere's to the city of Boston,\n\nThe home of the bean and the cod,\n\nWhere Lodges talk only to Cabots\n\nAnd Cabots talk only to God.\n\nThus, this argument concludes, one of the principal\n\nweaknesses of our time is lack of communication.\n\nWhile communication can always be improved, and\n\nshould be. this allegation, in my opinion, is an untruth.\n\nIt is not a lie, for an untruth is simply something that\n\nis not a fact with no deliberate attempt to deceive.\n\nWhat is the fact? The fact is that never in history has\n\nthere been so much communication as now. Books\n\npour from the presses in such numbers that one wonders\n\nthat there are readers for them all. Every retired general\n\ntells you how he conducted his various campaigns.\n\nEvery retired politician, statesman, and judge writes his\n\nmemoirs, often disclosing things that might better go\n\nunsaid. Mr. Manchester gives us an account of the\n\nlate President Kennedy, Mme. Svetlana Alleluyeva tells\n\nus about her father, Stalin. Travelers tell us things\n\nabout remote countries and cultures; and. in a different\n\ncategory and a more somber mood, surviving victims\n\nof the concentration camps of the Second World War\n\ndescribe the sordid horrors they have endured.\n\nAs for the newspapers, one may regret the recent\n\nextinction of such revered names as The Herald Tribune\n\nand The Boston Post, but there still remain enough\n\nnewspapers to consume hundreds of thousands of tons\n\nof newsprint each year. And the radio brings us news\n\nad nauseam, often more rapidly than every hour on\n\nthe hour, and sometimes around the clock, broadcast-\n\ning throughout the world every little event that happens,\n\noften magnifying the event out of all perspective. A\n\nmurder in Chicago somehow seems to have importance\n\nequal to conversations in Geneva that may shape the\n\nfuture of the world; and the basketball scores seem\n\nmore important than the mammoth federal deficit. And\n\ntelevision, fighting for an ever larger audience, brings\n\nus symposia, opinion-reviews, current happenings, riots,\n\n(Continued on next page)\n\nALUMNAE QUARTERLY /SPRING 1968\n\nOn the Importance\n\n(Continued)\n\nbattle scenes, and all the rest. Never has there been so\n\nmuch communication, so much rapid communication,\n\nas there is now.\n\nNo, the principal weakness of our time is not lack of\n\ncommunication. The flaw is that there is so little of any\n\nreal significance to communicate. We communicate that\n\nlittle avidly, but the effect, since what we say is often\n\nnot significant and only trivial, is that we crave real\n\nmeat and so think there has been no communication.\n\nWe multiply words, but we do not multiply meaning.\n\nBy a simple rule of chemistry, when you increase the\n\nquantity of the solution you dilute the chemical itself.\n\nThis is what is going on.\n\n\"But why is this so, why does it happen? There are\n\nmany answers, and some of them are beyond my scope\n\nthis morning. There is not time for instance, to explore\n\nthe conflict in radio, television, and many newspapers\n\nbetween a conscientious search for quality on the one\n\nhand and the commercial motive on the other. This is\n\na real problem, and fortunately there are signs that\n\nsome persons are devoting their best thoughts to solv-\n\ning it.\n\nMore important, I believe, is the problem presented\n\nby the vast audience of listeners and viewers. They\n\nrepresent a cross section of our culture, from the un-\n\neducated to the highly educated, from the poverty-\n\nstricken to the affluent. There is perhaps an uninten-\n\ntional irony in the phrase we use for the common means\n\nof communication, mass media. These are indeed the\n\nmedia for the masses; and with almost diabolical\n\ncleverness they are adjusted to speak to the mass mind;\n\nand, in the opinion of some sociologists and educational\n\nobservers, they shape the mass mind as much as do all\n\nthe classrooms of the nation, if not more.\n\nWe have set for ourselves in this country a noble\n\nideal of providing free elementary and secondary edu-\n\ncation for all of our children, and in recent years oppor-\n\ntunities for higher education have grown almost beyond\n\nthe imagination of those who can recall the days of ten\n\nor twenty years ago. The danger, as many have warned,\n\nis that we may end up by producing a nation of semi-\n\neducated people. \"A little knowledge is a dangerous\n\nthing,\" said Alexander Pope. \"Drink deep, or taste not\n\nthe Pierian spring.\" F. M. Hcchinger, Education Editor\n\nof The New York Times, did not quote Alexander Pope\n\nrecently when commenting on the demand for lower\n\ntuition charges for the college and university years, but\n\none of his comments touches the very center of the\n\nmass education problem:\n\nA . . . question is whether a massive subsidy of\n\nthose with average ability will interfere with quality\n\nthat emerges from competition. It may seem re-\n\nactionary to say that this is a problem, but it\n\nwould be unrealistic to pretend that it is not.\n\nIt might shed some light on this problem if we were\n\nto look for a moment at the early years of the Nine-\n\nteenth Century, which, for reasons too long to explore\n\nhere, were a time of malaise in many countries. As\n\nyet there was no mass education, but there was very\n\ngood education for some.\n\nThe educational systems of those days have been\n\nsubjected to some bitter words by later critics, but they\n\nhad virtues of their own. particularly the virtues of\n\nbreadth of horizon and depth of penetration. Moreover,\n\nthey were w/;-centered. not technique-centered. Read\n\nthe names of some of those who. not educated en\n\nmasse, have produced some of the noblest writings of\n\nthe century: Keats. Byron. Shelley. Wordsworth, and\n\nColeridge; Lamartine. de Musset. Chateaubriand.\n\nHugo, and Flaubert; Schiller and Heine: Tolstoy.\n\nDostoevski, Pushkin, and Turgenev. One could form a\n\nlonger catalogue, but these are enough. These authors\n\nwere not mass produced; they were not writing for\n\nthe masses. They were inspired by a powerful impulse\n\nto create according to the highest standard they could\n\nperceive. Without consciously realizing it, f believe,\n\nthey were striking always for excellence with no con-\n\nsideration of the number of persons they might reach.\n\nThey were above any quantitative goal. And because\n\nwhat they wrote was good, of high significance, and de-\n\nserving to be read, they have communicated with every\n\nsubsequent generation.\n\nAll of this has a direct bearing upon this Founder's\n\nDay Convocation. Agnes Scott College is engaged in\n\nthe very opposite of mass education, and there is no\n\nplace here for the semi-educated. This is a public serv-\n\nice institution in the sense that you serve our nation,\n\nour time, and our world through what you do. through\n\nwhat you produce, and through what you are: and this\n\nfact is recognized by your tax exempt status. This\n\nplaces you under a special obligation.\n\nWhat then is the nature of the service which this\n\nCollege must render to the present and to the future?\n\nThe answer is implicit in what 1 have just said. The\n\ntask is to shape the fully educated person, educated\n\nin mind, spirit, and character to give her proper train-\n\ning and incentive, or at least to help her find the right\n\npathway, for all true education is in the end self-educa-\n\ntion. At the opening ceremony of my own College on\n\nOctober 12, 1870. the first President of the College\n\nspoke as follows:\n\nThe effort will not be to cram the minds of pupils\n\nwith facts, but to spend time in development of\n\nthought so that the pupils will learn to think for\n\nthemselves, and thus be enabled in after life to be-\n\ncome leaders, instead of followers, in society.\n\nTHE ACNES SCOTT\n\nThis was strong doctrine in those days, but it must\n\nremain one of the principal aims of Agnes Scott College\n\nas well as of Wilson College.\n\nWe shall live the rest of our lives, I suppose, in an\n\nera of mass education, but we shall not get what we\n\nneed for salvation from the mass-educated. Let it con-\n\ntinue to be our task to train persons who may give us\n\nideals that will stir us, art and literature and music and\n\nscience and philosophy and mathematics and social\n\nscience that will exhilarate us and enlarge our imagina-\n\ntion and our perspective, making us better human\n\nbeings. Let us join together to train those and they\n\ncan be of any age or all ages who can lead us to a\n\ntriumph of the creative spirit in a time so tragically\n\nmarked by the destructive spirit.\n\nNow, the creative spirit does not rely upon com-\n\nmunication but upon the nurture of the inner wells. It\n\nwill be our salvation as a civilization to see that these\n\ninner wells are kept full. Whatever contributes to their\n\nfullness and to the purity and potency of what fills them\n\nis good. And this is an individual matter, having nought\n\nto do with assembly lines or mass production. Use, then,\n\nthe means at your disposal here and they are many\n\nto keep the inner life healthy and to nuture the creative\n\nand generous spirit that may help set the direction of\n\nour time toward decency and constructive effort. Agnes\n\nScott College can offer no greater or more needful serv-\n\nice to our time.\n\nThere are some who will rail at any allusion to the\n\ninner life. All of their life belongs to the outer realm.\n\nAmong these are the persons who are the victims of\n\nthe superfluous communication to which I alluded a\n\nfew minutes ago; those to whom things are most im-\n\nportant cars. TV sets, stocks, bonds, pretentious\n\nhomes, the various badges of success; and still others\n\nwho are cynical about everything that cannot be\n\nweighed, tested, and measured in the highly efficient\n\nmodern laboratory.\n\nBut are these people right? Should we not be cau-\n\ntioned by Pascal's famous and correct comment that\n\n\"le coeur a ses raisons que la raison ne counait point\";\n\nand Shakespeare's that \"There are more things in\n\nheaven and earth, Horatio, than are dreamt of in your\n\nphilosophy.\"\n\nOn a Founder's Day at Agnes Scott College it is\n\nfair enough to ask what the founders wished to hold in\n\nhonor in their College, now seventy-eight years old.\n\nAs I read the catalogue and the history of this College,\n\nI believe they wished to foster not only sound learning,\n\nintellectual discipline, and scholarship but also a quo-\n\ntient that I have called the inner life. Agnes Scott Col-\n\nlege offers no course with this title. Thus there arc no\n\ngrades and what a deliverance! Can we not somehow\n\ndevise a better measurement of achievement than a\n\ngrade? No single person is assigned the responsibility of\n\npromoting the inner life, for this is the commonly shared\n\nresponsibility of all. The public relations office need\n\nnot send out \"stories\" about it; it is too intimate for\n\npublic comment.\n\nBut a college with a basic Christian commitment is\n\nteaching the importance of the inner life now, let\n\nus give it its proper title, the spiritual life in a hundred\n\nways direct and oblique; through subtle and often un-\n\nseen influences in the classroom, in the laboratory, at\n\nchapel, on the sports field, in the student govern-\n\nment meeting, in the long talk-fests late at night in the\n\nresidence houses, at gatherings in faculty homes. There\n\nis no formula, for the inner life is not shaped by a\n\nformula, nor is it responsive to a fixed rule, Benedictine\n\nor otherwise. The inner life is the possession of each of\n\nus in a different form, nurtured in differing ways,\n\nknown in various guises.\n\nBut it is at the center of true liberal education the\n\nend-product of all the convolutions of the curriculum,\n\nall the virtues and advantages that our catalogues adver-\n\ntise about us, all the activities and causes and good\n\nthings we are exhorted to espouse. It defies exact de-\n\nscription because it is \"inner\" and the spectator cannot\n\nsee it. But it is real, determining, priceless, the pre-\n\nrequisite of sanity and health, the vessel into which the\n\nHoly Spirit pours wisdom, compassion, hope, and all\n\nthose aspirations that mark what Milton called \"the\n\ntrue wayfaring Christian.\" For all of us there is nothing\n\nmore important than the nature of that life. Words-\n\nworth came close to penetrating the secret of all this\n\nwhen he wrote, at the end of his moving \"Ode to Duty,\"\n\nthese lines:\n\nGive unto me, made lowly-wise.\n\nThe spirit of self-sacrifice.\n\nThe confidence of reason give,\n\nAnd in the light of truth\n\nThy bondman let me live.\n\nWhen all the grades are in, the commencement over,\n\nand the honors declared, all the clothes packed in the\n\ncar, the diploma tenderly stored in a suitcase, the fare-\n\nwells said and the road to the future defined perhaps\n\nnot finally, but at least for a year or two the im-\n\nportance of the inner life should begin to come into\n\nnew focus. It will be the final residue this private,\n\nintimate life of the full four years at Agnes Scott.\n\nSome of the facts you have learned will fall away, vic-\n\ntims of rust and erosion. But the nurture of the inner\n\nlife should continue with accelerated zeal, for this is\n\nthe possession for which you came to college. The\n\nfounders will feel their task well justified if you can say,\n\nwith Matthew Arnold, \"On to the bonds of the waste,/\n\nOn to the city of God.\"\n\nALUMNAE QUARTERLY/ SPRING 1%8\n\nFrom Decatur to Kilimanjaro\n\nThe first thing most people want to\n\nknow about my trip to Africa is why,\n\nof all places on earth, 1 chose to spend\n\na summer on that seemingly unpleas-\n\nurable continent. Aside from an in-\n\nterest developed in graduate school. I\n\nrecently completed my dissertation on\n\nthe colony of free Negroes and ex-\n\nslaves founded along the Liberian\n\ncoast in the lS30's by Maryland col-\n\nonizationists. My primary motive for\n\ngoing, then, was to continue research\n\non that subject at the national archives\n\nin Monrovia. Liberia. The rest of my\n\ntime was to be spent visiting other\n\nAfrican nations.\n\nI had little practical knowledge\n\nabout travel in Africa, but I soon\n\nfound that the best bargain is to buy\n\na round-trip air ticket to Johannes-\n\nburg. One can fly from New York to\n\nDakar, Senegal, and then make as\n\nmam stops as she wishes between\n\nSenegal and South Africa. Returning,\n\nshe may stop anywhere between\n\nJohannesburg and Athens. With this\n\ngeneral scheme, I worked out a tenta-\n\ntive schedule for the nations 1 thought\n\n1 would have time to visit and applied\n\nfor visas.\n\nThe day of embarkation was July\n\n7, 1967. I carried only one soft-sided\n\nsuitcase, a handbag and a coat. The\n\nclothes I took were a poor choice. I\n\nfound. Except in West Africa, it was\n\nwinter and not the mild Miami winter\n\nthat I expected, cither. I soon wished\n\nthat one of the two cotton dresses\n\nwas wool ami that I had more than\n\none sweater. The three pairs of shoes\n\nproved adequate. My parents drove\n\nme to Kennedy Airport in New York\n\nand my mother, who had newer recon-\n\nciled herself to the tup. tried to dis-\n\nsuade me right up to the end. 1 am\n\nsure she thought that she would never\n\nsee me alive again.\n\nAbout the Author: \"Penny\" Campbell\n\nwas born on Maryland's Eastern shore,\n\nholds the B.A. degree from Baylor Uni-\n\nversity, the M.A. and Ph.D. degrees\n\nfrom Ohio Stale and has taught at Han-\n\nover College before joining the Agnes\n\nScott history faculty.

I arrived\n\nin Dakar early on a Saturday morn-\n\ning. The enervating heat and humidity,\n\ncoupled with a drab, sandy landscape\n\nat first disillusioned me with Africa.\n\nAfter some dickering with tax drivers\n\nwho insisted upon what seemed exorbi-\n\ntant fares for a ride downtown, I en-\n\ngaged one for the five-mile trip. I\n\nsoon found that Dakar's skyscraper\n\noutline is a facade for what most\n\nAmericans would call slum condi-\n\ntions. In the city, each block con-\n\nsists of a fringe of rather modern\n\nshops and a core of shacks, out-\n\nhouses, goats and chickens. Senegal\n\nwas formerly a French colony and\n\nthat influence still dominates. There is\n\na large resident French population and\n\nmany Frenchmen come annually to\n\nDakar's beaches on holiday. The Afri-\n\ncans in Senegal wear probably the\n\nmost elaborate and colorful clothes of\n\nany people on the continent. Most of\n\nthe cloth used in Africa, by the way,\n\nis made in Japan. Enterprizing Japa-\n\nnese manufacturers have copied de-\n\nsigns and colors particularly favored\n\nby the inhabitants and produced a line\n\nof cotton goods called \"African\n\nprints\" which is sold everywhere.\n\nFurther down the west African\n\ncoast. Liberia fits more readily into\n\nthe concept held by many that Africa\n\nis a land of jungles. The main airport.\n\nRoberts Field, is fifty-five miles from\n\nMonrovia and enclosed on one side\n\nby mangrove swamp and on the other\n\nby the Firestone rubber plantations.\n\nMonrovia is a city of tin-roofed shacks\n\nand petty traders. As I trod streets\n\nnamed for erstwhile American coloni-\n\nzationists who fathered this experi-\n\nment, I wondered if they would have\n\nbeen as unimpressed as I. The Na-\n\ntional Archives are housed in the old\n\nPresidential Palace and consist of\n\nseveral rooms and an attic of unor-\n\nganized and uncataloged papers. The\n\narchivist, addicted to Mickey Spillane\n\npaperbacks and roasted corn-on-the-\n\ncob. explained that he had not one\n\nassistant who could alphabetize. The\n\nvalue of documents and the importance\n\nof preserving them, a difficult task in\n\nthat climate, have apparently never\n\nbeen perceived. Materials relevant to\n\nmy project were negligible.\n\nIn spite of that disappointment. I\n\nlearned a good deal about Liberia\n\nand Africa during the ten days I was\n\nin Monrovia. I stayed at the Peace\n\nCorps hostel and got an inside view\n\nof volunteers. In fact, at first I was\n\nsuspected of being a spy for some\n\nLmited States government agency\n\nwhich wanted information on Peace\n\nCorps progress and morale. What I\n\nsaw was generally favorable. Many\n\nvolunteers, it is true, were unhappy\n\nwith how little they seemed to ac-\n\ncomplish. Their disillusionment was\n\nperhaps commensurate with the ideal-\n\nism they brought to the job. Many\n\nvolunteers were fugitives from gradu-\n\nate schools and uncertain of their fu-\n\ntures, but none appeared to regret\n\nthis interlude.\n\n1 found Ghana a nice contrast to\n\nSenegal and Liberia. The air was more\n\ninvigorating, the people energetic. Ac-\n\ncra is quite modern and the extensive\n\ndrainage systems are used. The mar-\n\nkets were the most colorful and\n\norderly of any I visited in Africa.\n\nInexpensive and numerous \"mammy\n\nwagons\" enable one to travel about\n\nquite freely. I \\isited several early\n\nEuropean castles along the coast, in-\n\ncluding Elmina. built by the Portu-\n\nguese in the fifteenth century. I also\n\nwent up-country several hundred miles\n\nto Kumasi, the old Ashanti tribal\n\nhome. Ghana has advanced rapidly in\n\nrecent years and even has television.\n\nMost programs are American or\n\nBritish. I found the African reaction\n\nto Daktari and Peyton Place far more\n\ninteresting than the programs them-\n\nselves.\n\nFrom Ghana. I flew to the Republic\n\nof South Africa. The weather was now\n\ncold and dry. Most buildings, includ-\n\ning all but the newest hotels, have no\n\nheat. After one freezing night in\n\nJohannesburg. I discovered I could\n\nrent a small electric heater from the\n\nhotel desk. Johannesburg is a large,\n\nmodern city, culturally and numerical-\n\nly enriched by the continuing arrival\n\nof European immigrants. Its citizens\n\nevidence a high standard of living and\n\neven quite modest homes sport either\n\na swimming pool or a tennis court.\n\nAltogether I was in lohannesburg\n\na week. Another two weeks I traveled\n\nabout South Africa by train. The\n\nthousand mile journey to Cape Town\n\ntakes about twenty-four hours. Until\n\none approaches the vineyards and\n\nmountains outlying from Cape Town,\n\none sees only the seemingly endless\n\nkaroo, or plateau, where stretches of\n\ndesert alternate with fields of sun-\n\nflowers, corn and hay.\n\nCape Town is a pleasant little city\n\nnestled at the foot of Table Mountain.\n\nIt was the home of Cecil Rhodes,\n\npromin"
