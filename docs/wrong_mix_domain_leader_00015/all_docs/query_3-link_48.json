        "meta_description": "Abstract. Termites play an essential role in decomposing dead plant\nmaterial in tropical ecosystems and are thus major sources of gaseous C\nemissions in many environments. In African savannas, fungus-growing termites\nare among the ecologically most influential termite species. We studied the\ngas exchange from mounds of two closely related fungus-growing species\n(Macrotermes subhyalinus and M.Â michaelseni, respectively) in two habitats representing different vegetation types\n(grassland, bushland) together with soil fluxes around the mounds. The\nfluxes from active termite mounds varied from 120 to 2100âmgâCO2âCâmâ2âhâ1 for carbon dioxide (CO2) and from 0.06 to 3.7âmgâCH4âCâmâ2âhâ1 for methane (CH4) fluxes. Mound CO2 fluxes varied\nseasonally with a 64â% decrease and 41â% increase in the fluxes from\nthe dry to wet season at the grassland and bushland sites, respectively. During\nthe wet season, the CO2 fluxes were significantly correlated with\ntermite mound volume. The diurnal measurements from two M.Â michaelseni mounds suggest that\nthe gas fluxes peak during the daytime, possibly reflecting changes in mound\ninternal air circulation. Soil fluxes of both CO2 and CH4 were\nenhanced at up to 2âm distance from the mounds compared to the local soil\nrespiration, indicating that, in addition to mound ventilation structures, a\nsmall proportion of the metabolic gases produced also leave the nest via\nsurrounding soils.",

By combining carbon dioxide and water flux measurements, we show that the annual transpiration is nearly constant during wet years while grasses react quickly to dry spells and drought, which reduce transpiration. The planning of annual grazing strategies could consider the early-season rainfall frequency that was linked to the portion of annual transpiration.\n\nSeasonal and diurnal variations in biogenic volatile organic compounds in highland and lowland ecosystems in southern Kenya\n\nYang Liu, Simon Schallhart, Ditte Taipale, Toni TykkÃ¤, Matti RÃ¤sÃ¤nen, Lutz Merbold, Heidi HellÃ©n, and Petri Pellikka\n\nAtmos.

The mixing ratio of monoterpenoids was similar to that measured in the relevant ecosystems in western and southern Africa, while that of isoprene was lower. Modeling the emission factors (EFs) for BVOCs from the lowlands, the EFs for isoprene and Î²-pinene agreed well with what is assumed in the MEGAN, while those of Î±-pinene and limonene were higher.\n\nSoil greenhouse gas emissions under different land-use types in savanna ecosystems of Kenya\n\nSheila Wachiye, Lutz Merbold, Timo Vesala, Janne Rinne, Matti RÃ¤sÃ¤nen, Sonja Leitner, and Petri Pellikka\n\nBiogeosciences, 17, 2149–2167, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-17-2149-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-17-2149-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nLimited data on emissions in Africa translate into uncertainty during GHG budgeting. We studied annual CO2, N2O, and CH4 emissions in four land-use types in Kenyan savanna using static chambers and gas chromatography. CO2 emissions varied between seasons and land-use types. Soil moisture and vegetation explained the seasonal variation, while soil temperature was insignificant. N2O and CH4 emissions did not vary at all sites. Our results are useful in climate change mitigation interventions.\n\nThe effect of rainfall amount and timing on annual transpiration in grazed savanna grassland\n\nMatti RÃ¤sÃ¤nen, Mika Aurela, Ville Vakkari, Johan P.

The computed annual transpiration was highly constrained when rainfall was near or above the long-term mean but was reduced during severe drought year. The developed methodologies can be used in a wide range of arid and semi-arid ecosystems.\n\nCarbon balance of a grazed savanna grassland ecosystem in South Africa\n\nMatti RÃ¤sÃ¤nen, Mika Aurela, Ville Vakkari, Johan P.

Results presented are the most extensive for this type of landscape. Compared to other parts of the world, monoterpene levels were similar, while very low isoprene levels led to significantly lower total BVOC levels. BVOC levels were an order of magnitude lower compared to anthropogenic VOC levels measured at Welgegund.\n\nOptimising CH4 simulations from the LPJ-GUESS model v4.1 using an adaptive Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm\n\nJalisha T.

Model Dev., 17, 2299–2324, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-17-2299-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-17-2299-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nBy unlocking the mysteries of CH4 emissions from wetlands, our work improved the accuracy of the LPJ-GUESS vegetation model using Bayesian statistics. Via assimilation of long-term real data from a wetland, we significantly enhanced CH4 emission predictions. This advancement helps us better understand wetland contributions to atmospheric CH4, which are crucial for addressing climate change. Our method offers a promising tool for refining global climate models and guiding conservation efforts\n\nAssimilating Multi-site Eddy-Covariance Data to Calibrate the CH4 Wetland Emission Module in a Terrestrial Ecosystem Model\n\nJalisha Theanutti Kallingal, Marko Scholze, Paul Anthony Miller, Johan LindstrÃ¶m, Janne Rinne, Mika Aurela, Patrik Vestin, and Per Weslien\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-373,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-373, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nOur study employs an Adaptive MCMC algorithm (GRaB-AM) to constrain process parameters in the wetlands emission module of the LPJ-GUESS model, using CH4 EC flux observations from 14 diverse wetlands. We aim to derive a single set of parameters capable of representing the diversity of northern wetlands. By reducing uncertainties in model parameters and improving simulation accuracy, our research contributes to more reliable projections of future wetland CH4 emissions and their climate impact.\n\nHigh-resolution spatial patterns and drivers of terrestrial ecosystem carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide fluxes in the tundra\n\nAnna-Maria Virkkala, Pekka Niittynen, Julia Kemppinen, Maija E.

We combined extensive in situ measurements and remote sensing data to develop machine-learning models to predict GHG fluxes at a 2 m resolution across a tundra landscape. The analysis revealed that the system was a net GHG sink and showed widespread CH4 uptake in upland vegetation types, almost surpassing the high wetland CH4 emissions at the landscape scale.\n\nVertical distribution of sources and sinks of volatile organic compounds within a boreal forest canopy\n\nRoss Petersen, Thomas Holst, Meelis MÃ¶lder, Natascha Kljun, and Janne Rinne\n\nAtmos.

VOC source/sink seasonality in canopy was explored using these vertical profiles and with measurements from a collection of sonic anemometers on the station flux tower. Our results show seasonality in the source/sink distribution for several VOCs, such as monoterpenes and water-soluble compounds.\n\nThe effect of rainfall amount and timing on annual transpiration in a grazed savanna grassland\n\nMatti RÃ¤sÃ¤nen, Mika Aurela, Ville Vakkari, Johan P.

Sci. Data, 14, 4365–4386, https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-14-4365-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-14-4365-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nEmission sources of methane (CH4) can be distinguished with measurements of CH4 stable isotopes. We present new measurements of isotope signatures of various CH4 sources in Europe, mainly anthropogenic, sampled from 2017 to 2020. The present database also contains the most recent update of the global signature dataset from the literature. The dataset improves CH4 source attribution and the understanding of the global CH4 budget.\n\nSpatial and temporal variation in Î´13C values of methane emitted from a hemiboreal mire: methanogenesis, methanotrophy, and hysteresis\n\nJanne Rinne, Patryk Åakomiec, Patrik Vestin, Joel D. White, Per Weslien, Julia Kelly, Natascha Kljun, Lena StrÃ¶m, and Leif Klemedtsson\n\nBiogeosciences, 19, 4331–4349, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-19-4331-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-19-4331-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe study uses the stable isotope 13C of carbon in methane to investigate the origins of spatial and temporal variation in methane emitted by a temperate wetland ecosystem. The results indicate that methane production is more important for spatial variation than methane consumption by micro-organisms. Temporal variation on a seasonal timescale is most likely affected by more than one driver simultaneously.\n\nImplementation and initial calibration of carbon-13 soil organic matter decomposition in the Yasso model\n\nJarmo MÃ¤kelÃ¤, Laura Arppe, Hannu Fritze, Jussi Heinonsalo, Kristiina Karhu, Jari Liski, Markku Oinonen, Petra StrakovÃ¡, and Toni Viskari\n\nBiogeosciences, 19, 4305–4313, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-19-4305-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-19-4305-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nSoils account for the largest share of carbon found in terrestrial ecosystems, and accurate depiction of soil carbon decomposition is essential in understanding how permanent these carbon storages are. We present a straightforward way to include carbon isotope concentrations into soil decomposition and carbon storages for the Yasso model, which enables the model to use 13C as a natural tracer to track changes in the underlying soil organic matter decomposition.\n\nStrong influence of trees outside forest in regulating microclimate of intensively modified Afromontane landscapes\n\nIris Johanna Aalto, Eduardo Eiji Maeda, Janne Heiskanen, Eljas Kullervo Aalto, and Petri Kauko Emil Pellikka\n\nBiogeosciences, 19, 4227–4247, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-19-4227-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-19-4227-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nTree canopies are strong moderators of understory climatic conditions. In tropical areas, trees cool down the microclimates. Using remote sensing and field measurements we show how even intermediate canopy cover and agroforestry trees contributed to buffering the hottest temperatures in Kenya. The cooling effect was the greatest during hot days and in lowland areas, where the ambient temperatures were high. Adopting agroforestry practices in the area could assist in mitigating climate change.\n\nUTILISING SIMULATED TREE DATA TO TRAIN SUPERVISED CLASSIFIERS\n\nP. RÃ¶nnholm, S. Wittke, M. Ingman, P.

The automatic method generalized well on datasets collected in different sites, which is useful for long-term data series analysis and obtaining statistical properties of NPF events.\n\nGenetic functional potential displays minor importance in explaining spatial variability of methane fluxes within a Eriophorum vaginatum dominated Swedish peatland\n\nJoel Dawson White, Lena StrÃ¶m, Veiko Lehsten, Janne Rinne, and Dag AhrÃ©n\n\nBiogeosciences Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-2021-353,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-2021-353, 2022\n\nRevised manuscript not accepted\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nMicrobes that produce CH4 play an important role to climate. Microbes which emit CH4 from wetlands is poorly understood. We observed that microbial community was of importance in explaining CH4 emission. We found, that microbes that produce CH4 hold the ability to produce and consume CH4 in multiple ways. This is important in terms of future climate scenarios, where wetlands are expected to shift. Therefore, we expect the community to be highly adaptive to future climate scenarios.\n\nField-scale CH4 emission at a subarctic mire with heterogeneous permafrost thaw status\n\nPatryk Åakomiec, Jutta Holst, Thomas Friborg, Patrick Crill, Niklas Rakos, Natascha Kljun, Per-Ola Olsson, Lars Eklundh, Andreas Persson, and Janne Rinne\n\nBiogeosciences, 18, 5811–5830, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-18-5811-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-18-5811-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nMethane emission from the subarctic mire with heterogeneous permafrost status was measured for the years 2014–2016. Lower methane emission was measured from the palsa mire sector while the thawing wet sector emitted more. Both sectors have a similar annual pattern with a gentle rise during spring and a decrease during autumn. The highest emission was observed in the late summer. Winter emissions were positive during the measurement period and have a significant impact on the annual budgets.\n\nSeasonal and diurnal variations in biogenic volatile organic compounds in highland and lowland ecosystems in southern Kenya\n\nYang Liu, Simon Schallhart, Ditte Taipale, Toni TykkÃ¤, Matti RÃ¤sÃ¤nen, Lutz Merbold, Heidi HellÃ©n, and Petri Pellikka\n\nAtmos.

The mixing ratio of monoterpenoids was similar to that measured in the relevant ecosystems in western and southern Africa, while that of isoprene was lower. Modeling the emission factors (EFs) for BVOCs from the lowlands, the EFs for isoprene and Î²-pinene agreed well with what is assumed in the MEGAN, while those of Î±-pinene and limonene were higher.\n\nVolatile organic compound fluxes in a subarctic peatland and lake\n\nRoger Seco, Thomas Holst, Mikkel Sillesen Matzen, Andreas Westergaard-Nielsen, Tao Li, Tihomir Simin, Joachim Jansen, Patrick Crill, Thomas Friborg, Janne Rinne, and Riikka Rinnan\n\nAtmos.

We measured VOC fluxes from a subarctic permafrost-free fen and its adjacent lake in northern Sweden. The graminoid-dominated fen emitted mainly isoprene during the peak of the growing season, with a pronounced response to increasing temperatures stronger than assumed by biogenic emission models. The lake was a sink of acetone and acetaldehyde during both periods measured.\n\nDESIGNING AND BUILDING A COST-EFFICIENT SURVEY DRONE\n\nH. Kauhanen, P. RÃ¶nnholm, M. Vaaja, and H. HyyppÃ¤\n\nInt.

We studied annual CO2, N2O, and CH4 emissions in four land-use types in Kenyan savanna using static chambers and gas chromatography. CO2 emissions varied between seasons and land-use types. Soil moisture and vegetation explained the seasonal variation, while soil temperature was insignificant. N2O and CH4 emissions did not vary at all sites. Our results are useful in climate change mitigation interventions.\n\nThe effect of rainfall amount and timing on annual transpiration in grazed savanna grassland\n\nMatti RÃ¤sÃ¤nen, Mika Aurela, Ville Vakkari, Johan P.

The computed annual transpiration was highly constrained when rainfall was near or above the long-term mean but was reduced during severe drought year. The developed methodologies can be used in a wide range of arid and semi-arid ecosystems.\n\nMonthly gridded data product of northern wetland methane emissions based on upscaling eddy covariance observations\n\nOlli Peltola, Timo Vesala, Yao Gao, Olle RÃ¤ty, Pavel Alekseychik, Mika Aurela, Bogdan Chojnicki, Ankur R.

The data product is derived using a random forest machine-learning technique and eddy covariance CH4 fluxes from 25 wetland sites. Annual CH4 emissions from these wetlands calculated from the derived data product are comparable to prior studies focusing on these areas. This product is an independent estimate of northern wetland CH4 emissions and hence could be used, e.g. for process model evaluation.\n\nA 1500-year multiproxy record of coastal hypoxia from the northern Baltic Sea indicates unprecedented deoxygenation over the 20th century\n\nSami A.

Here we apply a wide set of chemical and physical analyses to a 1500-year long sediment record and show that, although long-term climate variability has modulated seafloor oxygenation in the coastal northern Baltic Sea, the oxygen loss over the 20th century is unprecedentedly severe, emphasizing the need to reduce anthropogenic nutrient input in the future.\n\nSmall spatial variability in methane emission measured from a wet patterned boreal bog\n\nAino Korrensalo, Elisa MÃ¤nnistÃ¶, Pavel Alekseychik, Ivan Mammarella, Janne Rinne, Timo Vesala, and Eeva-Stiina Tuittila\n\nBiogeosciences, 15, 1749–1761, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-15-1749-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-15-1749-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe measured methane fluxes of a boreal bog from six different plant community types in 2012–2014. We found only little variation in methane fluxes among plant community types. Peat temperature as well as both leaf area of plant species with air channels and of all vegetation are important factors controlling the fluxes. We also detected negative net fluxes indicating methane consumption each year. Our results can be used to improve the models of peatland methane dynamics under climate change.\n\nORCHIDEE-PEAT (revision 4596), a model for northern peatland CO2, water, and energy fluxes on daily to annual scales\n\nChunjing Qiu, Dan Zhu, Philippe Ciais, Bertrand Guenet, Gerhard Krinner, Shushi Peng, Mika Aurela, Christian Bernhofer, Christian BrÃ¼mmer, Syndonia Bret-Harte, Housen Chu, Jiquan Chen, Ankur R.

We implemented peatland hydrological and carbon accumulation processes into the ORCHIDEE land surface model. The model was evaluated against EC measurements from 30 northern peatland sites. The model generally well reproduced the spatial gradient and temporal variations in GPP and NEE at these sites. Water table depth was not well predicted but had only small influence on simulated NEE.\n\nHIMMELI v1.0: HelsinkI Model of MEthane buiLd-up and emIssion for peatlands\n\nMaarit Raivonen, Sampo Smolander, Leif Backman, Jouni Susiluoto, Tuula Aalto, Tiina Markkanen, Jarmo MÃ¤kelÃ¤, Janne Rinne, Olli Peltola, Mika Aurela, Annalea Lohila, Marin Tomasic, Xuefei Li, Tuula Larmola, Sari Juutinen, Eeva-Stiina Tuittila, Martin Heimann, Sanna Sevanto, Thomas Kleinen, Victor Brovkin, and Timo Vesala\n\nGeosci.

We developed a model that can be used within a larger wetland carbon model to simulate the methane emissions. In this study, we present the model and results of its testing. We found that the model works well with different settings and that the results depend primarily on the rate of input anoxic soil respiration and also on factors that affect the simulated oxygen concentrations in the wetland soil.\n\nCarbon balance of a grazed savanna grassland ecosystem in South Africa\n\nMatti RÃ¤sÃ¤nen, Mika Aurela, Ville Vakkari, Johan P.

We find that the yearly variation in carbon dioxide balance is largely determined by the changes in the early wet season balance (September to November) and in the mid-growing season balance (December to January).\n\nSpecies-specific temporal variation in photosynthesis as a moderator of peatland carbon sequestration\n\nAino Korrensalo, Pavel Alekseychik, TomÃ¡Å¡ HÃ¡jek, Janne Rinne, Timo Vesala, Lauri MehtÃ¤talo, Ivan Mammarella, and Eeva-Stiina Tuittila\n\nBiogeosciences, 14, 257–269, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-14-257-2017,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-14-257-2017, 2017\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nPhotosynthetic parameters of peatland plant species were measured over one growing season in an ombrotrophic bog. Based on these measurements, ecosystem-level photosynthesis was calculated for the whole growing season and compared with an estimate derived from micrometeorological measurements. These two estimates corresponded well. Species with low areal cover at the site but high photosynthetic efficiency appeared to be potentially important for the ecosystem-level carbon balance.\n\nMeasurements of biogenic volatile organic compounds at a grazed savannah grassland agricultural landscape in South Africa\n\nKerneels Jaars, Pieter G. van Zyl, Johan P.

Results presented are the most extensive for this type of landscape. Compared to other parts of the world, monoterpene levels were similar, while very low isoprene levels led to significantly lower total BVOC levels. BVOC levels were an order of magnitude lower compared to anthropogenic VOC levels measured at Welgegund.\n\nAnthropogenic and biogenic influence on VOC fluxes at an urban background site in Helsinki, Finland\n\nPekka Rantala, Leena JÃ¤rvi, Risto Taipale, Terhi K.

We found that traffic was a major source for many oxygenated and aromatic VOCs, whereas isoprene originated mostly from the urban vegetation. Overall, the VOC fluxes were quite small in comparison with the earlier urban VOC flux measurements.\n\nCharacterization of total ecosystem-scale biogenic VOC exchange at a Mediterranean oakâhornbeam forest\n\nSimon Schallhart, Pekka Rantala, Eiko Nemitz, Ditte Taipale, Ralf Tillmann, Thomas F.

Detectable fluxes were observed for 29 compounds, dominated by isoprene, which comprised over 60â¯% of the upward flux. Methanol seemed to be deposited to dew, as the deposition happened in the early morning. We estimated that up to 30â¯% of the upward flux of methyl vinyl ketone and methacrolein originated from atmospheric oxidation of isoprene.\n\nA dual-inlet, single detector relaxed eddy accumulation system for long-term measurement of mercury flux\n\nS.

To define landscapes as sinks or sources of Hg we have developed an advanced REA system for long-term measurements of gaseous elemental Hg exchange. It was tested in two contrasting environments: above Basel, Switzerland, and a peatland in Sweden. Both landscapes showed net Hg emission (15 and 3 ng mâ2â¯hâ1, respectively). The novel system will help to advance our understanding of Hg exchange on an ecosystem scale.\n\nSources of long-lived atmospheric VOCs at the rural boreal forest site, SMEAR II\n\nJ. Patokoski, T.

Paludiculture is a way to reduce CO2 emissions while at the same time generating an income for landowners. The side effect is the potentially high methane emissions. We found very high methane emissions for broadleaf cattail compared with narrowleaf cattail and water fern. The rewetting was, however, effective to stop CO2 emissions for all species. The highest potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions had narrowleaf cattail.\n\nAssessing improvements in global ocean pCO2 machine learning reconstructions with Southern Ocean autonomous sampling\n\nThea H. Heimdal, Galen A. McKinley, Adrienne J. Sutton, Amanda R.

Machine learning algorithms are therefore used to reconstruct ocean carbon where observations do not exist. Improving these reconstructions is important in order to accurately estimate how much carbon the ocean absorbs from the atmosphere. In this study, we find that a small addition of observations from the Southern Ocean, obtained by autonomous sampling platforms, could significantly improve the reconstructions.\n\nTimescale dependence of airborne fraction and underlying climateâcarbon-cycle feedbacks for weak perturbations in CMIP5 models\n\nGuilherme L.

Using simulations we show the predictive power of this theory and find that (1) this fraction generally decreases for increasing timescales and (2) at all timescales the total feedback is negative and the model spread in a single feedback causes the spread in the airborne fraction. Our study indicates that those are properties of the system, independently of the scenario.\n\nTechnical note: Preventing CO2 overestimation from mercuric or copper(II) chloride preservation of dissolved greenhouse gases in freshwater samples\n\nFranÃ§ois Clayer, Jan Erik Thrane, Kuria Ndungu, Andrew King, Peter DÃ¶rsch, and Thomas Rohrlack\n\nBiogeosciences, 21, 1903–1921, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-21-1903-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-21-1903-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nDetermination of dissolved greenhouse gas (GHG) in freshwater allows us to estimate GHG fluxes. Mercuric chloride (HgCl2) is used to preserve water samples prior to GHG analysis despite its environmental and health impacts and interferences with water chemistry in freshwater. Here, we tested the effects of HgCl2, two substitutes and storage time on GHG in water from two boreal lakes. Preservation with HgCl2 caused overestimation of CO2 concentration with consequences for GHG flux estimation.\n\nExploring temporal and spatial variation of nitrous oxide flux using several years of peatland forest automatic chamber data\n\nHelena Rautakoski, Mika Korkiakoski, Jarmo MÃ¤kelÃ¤, Markku Koskinen, Kari Minkkinen, Mika Aurela, Paavo Ojanen, and Annalea Lohila\n\nBiogeosciences, 21, 1867–1886, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-21-1867-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-21-1867-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nCurrent and future nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions are difficult to estimate due to their high variability in space and time. Several years of N2O fluxes from drained boreal peatland forest indicate high importance of summer precipitation, winter temperature, and snow conditions in controlling annual N2O emissions. The results indicate increasing year-to-year variation in N2O emissions in changing climate with more extreme seasonal weather conditions.\n\nDiurnal versus spatial variability of greenhouse gas emissions from an anthropogenically modified lowland river in Germany\n\nMatthias Koschorreck, Norbert Kamjunke, Uta Koedel, Michael Rode, Claudia Schuetze, and Ingeborg Bussmann\n\nBiogeosciences, 21, 1613–1628, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-21-1613-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-21-1613-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe measured the emission of carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) from different sites at the river Elbe in Germany over 3 days to find out what is more important for quantification: small-scale spatial variability or diurnal temporal variability. We found that CO2 emissions were very different between day and night, while CH4 emissions were more different between sites. Dried out river sediments contributed to CO2 emissions, while the side areas of the river were important CH4 sources.\n\nRegional assessment and uncertainty analysis of carbon and nitrogen balances at cropland scale using the ecosystem model LandscapeDNDC\n\nOdysseas Sifounakis, Edwin Haas, Klaus Butterbach-Bahl, and Maria P. Papadopoulou\n\nBiogeosciences, 21, 1563–1581, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-21-1563-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-21-1563-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe performed a full assessment of the carbon and nitrogen cycles of a cropland ecosystem. An uncertainty analysis and quantification of all carbon and nitrogen fluxes were deployed. The inventory simulations include greenhouse gas emissions of N2O, NH3 volatilization and NO3 leaching from arable land cultivation in Greece. The inventory also reports changes in soil organic carbon and nitrogen stocks in arable soils.\n\nResolving heterogeneous fluxes from tundra halves the growing season carbon budget\n\nSarah M. Ludwig, Luke Schiferl, Jacqueline Hung, Susan M. Natali, and Roisin Commane\n\nBiogeosciences, 21, 1301–1321, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-21-1301-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-21-1301-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nLandscapes are often assumed to be homogeneous when using eddy covariance fluxes, which can lead to biases when calculating carbon budgets. In this study we report eddy covariance carbon fluxes from heterogeneous tundra. We used the footprints of each flux observation to unmix the fluxes coming from components of the landscape. We identified and quantified hot spots of carbon emissions in the landscape. Accurately scaling with landscape heterogeneity yielded half as much regional carbon uptake.\n\nLawns and meadows in urban green space â a comparison from perspectives of greenhouse gases, drought resilience and plant functional types\n\nJustine TrÃ©meau, BeÃ±at Olascoaga, Leif Backman, Esko Karvinen, Henriikka Vekuri, and Liisa Kulmala\n\nBiogeosciences, 21, 949–972, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-21-949-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-21-949-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe studied urban lawns and meadows in the Helsinki metropolitan area, Finland. We found that meadows are more resistant to drought events but that they do not increase carbon sequestration compared with lawns. Moreover, the transformation from lawns to meadows did not demonstrate any negative climate effects in terms of greenhouse gas emissions. Even though social and economic aspects also steer urban development, these results can guide planning to consider carbon-smart options.\n\nLarge contribution of soil N2O emission to the global warming potential of a large-scale oil palm plantation despite changing from conventional to reduced management practices\n\nGuantao Chen, Edzo Veldkamp, Muhammad Damris, Bambang Irawan, Aiyen Tjoa, and Marife D. Corre\n\nBiogeosciences, 21, 513–529, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-21-513-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-21-513-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe established an oil palm management experiment in a large-scale oil palm plantation in Jambi, Indonesia. We recorded oil palm fruit yield and measured soil CO2, N2O, and CH4 fluxes. After 4 years of treatment, compared with conventional fertilization with herbicide weeding, reduced fertilization with mechanical weeding did not reduce yield and soil greenhouse gas emissions, which highlights the legacy effects of over a decade of conventional management prior to the start of the experiment.\n\nIdentifying landscape hot and cold spots of soil greenhouse gas fluxes by combining field measurements and remote sensing data\n\nElizabeth Gachibu Wangari, Ricky Mwangada Mwanake, Tobias Houska, David Kraus, Gretchen Maria Gettel, Ralf Kiese, Lutz Breuer, and Klaus Butterbach-Bahl\n\nBiogeosciences, 20, 5029–5067, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-20-5029-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-20-5029-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAgricultural landscapes act as sinks or sources of the greenhouse gases (GHGs) CO2, CH4, or N2O. Various physicochemical and biological processes control the fluxes of these GHGs between ecosystems and the atmosphere. Therefore, fluxes depend on environmental conditions such as soil moisture, soil temperature, or soil parameters, which result in large spatial and temporal variations of GHG fluxes. Here, we describe an example of how this variation may be studied and analyzed.\n\nThe emission of CO from tropical rain forest soils\n\nHella van Asperen, Thorsten Warneke, Alessandro Carioca de AraÃºjo, Bruce Forsberg, SÃ¡vio JosÃ© Filgueiras Ferreira, Thomas RÃ¶ckmann, Carina van der Veen, Sipko Bulthuis, Leonardo Ramos de Oliveira, Thiago de Lima Xavier, Jailson da Mata, Marta de Oliveira SÃ¡, Paulo Ricardo Teixeira, Julie Andrews de FranÃ§a e Silva, Susan Trumbore, and Justus Notholt\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-2746,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-2746, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nCarbon monoxide (CO) is considered an important indirect greenhouse gas. Soils can emit as well as take up CO but, until now, uncertainty remains which process dominates in tropical rain forests. We present the first soil CO flux measurements from a tropical rain forest. Based on our observations, we report that tropical rain forest soils are a net source of CO. In addition, we show that valley streams and inundated areas are likely additional hot spots of CO in the ecosystem.\n\nIsotopomer labeling and oxygen dependence of hybrid nitrous oxide production\n\nColette L. Kelly, Nicole M. Travis, Pascale A. Baya, Claudia Frey, Xin Sun, Bess B. Ward, and Karen L. Casciotti\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-2642,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-2642, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe investigated the origins of nitrous oxide, a potent greenhouse gas, in low oxygen ocean regions. Our findings shed light on the microbial processes behind nitrous oxide production, including “hybrid” nitrous oxide generation by ammonia-oxidizing archaea, one of the most abundant organisms in the ocean. We also observed a strong link between nitrous oxide production and oxygen levels. These results set up potential feedbacks between oxygen depletion and greenhouse gas cycling in the oceans.\n\nEnhanced Southern Ocean CO2 outgassing as a result of stronger and poleward shifted southern hemispheric westerlies\n\nLaurie C. Menviel, Paul Spence, Andrew E. Kiss, Matthew A. Chamberlain, Hakase Hayashida, Matthew H. England, and Darryn Waugh\n\nBiogeosciences, 20, 4413–4431, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-20-4413-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-20-4413-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAs the ocean absorbs 25% of the anthropogenic emissions of carbon, it is important to understand the impact of climate change on the flux of carbon between the ocean and the atmosphere. Here, we use a very high-resolution ocean, sea-ice, carbon cycle model to show that the capability of the Southern Ocean to uptake CO2 has decreased over the last 40 years due to a strengthening and poleward shift of the southern hemispheric westerlies. This trend is expected to continue over the coming century.\n\nModelling CO2 and N2O emissions from soils in silvopastoral systems of the West-African Sahelian band\n\nYÃ©lognissÃ¨ Agbohessou, Claire Delon, Manuela Grippa, Eric Mougin, Daouda Ngom, Espoir Koudjo Gaglo, Ousmane Ndiaye, Paulo Salgado, and Olivier Roupsard\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-2452,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-2452, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nEmissions of greenhouse gases in the Sahel are not well represented, because considered as weak compared to the rest of the world. However, natural areas in the Sahel emit carbon dioxide and nitrous oxides which need to be assessed because of extended surfaces. We propose an assessment of such emissions in Sahelian silvopastoral systems, and how they are influenced by environmental characteristics. These results are essential to inform on climate change strategies in the region.\n\nSpatial and temporal variability of methane emissions and environmental conditions in a hyper-eutrophic fishpond\n\nPetr Znachor, JiÅÃ­ Nedoma, Vojtech Kolar, and Anna MatouÅ¡Å¯\n\nBiogeosciences, 20, 4273–4288, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-20-4273-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-20-4273-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe conducted intensive spatial sampling of the hypertrophic fishpond to better understand the spatial dynamics of methane fluxes and environmental heterogeneity in fishponds. The diffusive fluxes of methane accounted for only a minor fraction of the total fluxes and both varied pronouncedly within the pond and over the studied summer season. This could be explained only by the water depth. Wind substantially affected temperature, oxygen and chlorophyll a distribution in the pond.\n\nOptical and radar Earth observation data for upscaling methane emissions linked to permafrost degradation in sub-Arctic peatlands in northern Sweden\n\nSofie SjÃ¶gersten, Martha Ledger, Matthias Siewert, BetsabÃ© de la Barreda-Bautista, Andrew Sowter, David Gee, Giles Foody, and Doreen S. Boyd\n\nBiogeosciences, 20, 4221–4239, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-20-4221-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-20-4221-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nPermafrost thaw in Arctic regions is increasing methane emissions, but quantification is difficult given the large and remote areas impacted. We show that UAV data together with satellite data can be used to extrapolate emissions across the wider landscape as well as detect areas at risk of higher emissions. A transition of currently degrading areas to fen type vegetation can increase emission by several orders of magnitude, highlighting the importance of quantifying areas at risk.\n\nHerbivoreâshrub interactions influence ecosystem respiration and biogenic volatile organic compound composition in the subarctic\n\nCole G. Brachmann, Tage Vowles, Riikka Rinnan, Mats P. BjÃ¶rkman, Anna Ekberg, and Robert G. BjÃ¶rk\n\nBiogeosciences, 20, 4069–4086, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-20-4069-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-20-4069-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nHerbivores change plant communities through grazing, altering the amount of CO2 and plant-specific chemicals (termed VOCs) emitted. We tested this effect by excluding herbivores and studying the CO2 and VOC emissions. Herbivores reduced CO2 emissions from a meadow community and altered VOC composition; however, community type had the strongest effect on the amount of CO2 and VOCs released. Herbivores can mediate greenhouse gas emissions, but the effect is marginal and community dependent.\n\nMethane emissions due to reservoir flushing: a significant emission pathway?\n\nOle Lessmann, Jorge Encinas FernÃ¡ndez, Karla MartÃ­nez-Cruz, and Frank Peeters\n\nBiogeosciences, 20, 4057–4068, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-20-4057-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-20-4057-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nBased on a large dataset of seasonally resolved methane (CH4) pore water concentrations in a reservoir's sediment, we assess the significance of CH4 emissions due to reservoir flushing. In the studied reservoir, CH4 emissions caused by one flushing operation can represent 7 %–14 % of the annual CH4 emissions and depend on the timing of the flushing operation. In reservoirs with high sediment loadings, regular flushing may substantially contribute to the overall CH4 emissions.\n\nDiel and seasonal methane dynamics in the shallow and turbulent Wadden Sea\n\nTim RenÃ© de Groot, Anne Margriet Mol, Katherine Mesdag, Pierre Ramond, Rachel Ndhlovu, Julia Catherine Engelmann, Thomas RÃ¶ckmann, and Helge Niemann\n\nBiogeosciences, 20, 3857–3872, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-20-3857-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-20-3857-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis study investigates methane dynamics in the Wadden Sea. Our measurements revealed distinct variations triggered by seasonality and tidal forcing. The methane budget was higher in warmer seasons but surprisingly high in colder seasons. Methane dynamics were amplified during low tides, flushing the majority of methane into the North Sea or releasing it to the atmosphere. Methanotrophic activity was also elevated during low tide but mitigated only a small fraction of the methane efflux.\n\nTechnical note: Skirt chamber â an open dynamic method for the rapid and minimally intrusive measurement of greenhouse gas emissions from peatlands\n\nFrederic Thalasso, Brenda Riquelme, AndrÃ©s GÃ³mez, Roy Mackenzie, Francisco Javier Aguirre, Jorge Hoyos-Santillan, Ricardo Rozzi, and Armando Sepulveda-Jauregui\n\nBiogeosciences, 20, 3737–3749, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-20-3737-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-20-3737-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nA robust skirt-chamber design to capture and quantify greenhouse gas emissions from peatlands is presented. Compared to standard methods, this design improves the spatial resolution of field studies in remote locations while minimizing intrusion.\n\nSeasonal variability of nitrous oxide concentrations and emissions in a temperate estuary\n\nGesa Schulz, Tina Sanders, Yoana G. Voynova, Hermann W. Bange, and Kirstin DÃ¤hnke\n\nBiogeosciences, 20, 3229–3247, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-20-3229-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-20-3229-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nNitrous oxide (N2O) is an important greenhouse gas. However, N2O emissions from estuaries underlie significant uncertainties due to limited data availability and high spatiotemporal variability. We found the Elbe Estuary (Germany) to be a year-round source of N2O, with the highest emissions in winter along with high nitrogen loads. However, in spring and summer, N2O emissions did not decrease alongside lower nitrogen loads because organic matter fueled in situ N2O production along the estuary.\n\nReviews and syntheses: Recent advances in microwave remote sensing in support of terrestrial carbon cycle science in Arcticâboreal regions\n\nAlex Mavrovic, Oliver Sonnentag, Juha Lemmetyinen, Jennifer L. Baltzer, Christophe Kinnard, and Alexandre Roy\n\nBiogeosciences, 20, 2941–2970, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-20-2941-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-20-2941-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis review supports the integration of microwave spaceborne information into carbon cycle science for Arctic–boreal regions. The microwave data record spans multiple decades with frequent global observations of soil moisture and temperature, surface freeze–thaw cycles, vegetation water storage, snowpack properties, and land cover. This record holds substantial unexploited potential to better understand carbon cycle processes.\n\nSimulated methane emissions from Arctic ponds are highly sensitive to warming\n\nZoÃ© Rehder, Thomas Kleinen, Lars Kutzbach, Victor Stepanenko, Moritz Langer, and Victor Brovkin\n\nBiogeosciences, 20, 2837–2855, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-20-2837-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-20-2837-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe use a new model to investigate how methane emissions from Arctic ponds change with warming. We find that emissions increase substantially. Under annual temperatures 5 Â°C above present temperatures, pond methane emissions are more than 3 times higher than now. Most of this increase is caused by an increase in plant productivity as plants provide the substrate microbes used to produce methane. We conclude that vegetation changes need to be included in predictions of pond methane emissions.\n\nWater-table-driven greenhouse gas emission estimates guide peatland restoration at national scale\n\nJulian Koch, Lars Elsgaard, Mogens H. Greve, Steen GyldenkÃ¦rne, Cecilie Hermansen, Gregor Levin, Shubiao Wu, and Simon Stisen\n\nBiogeosciences, 20, 2387–2403, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-20-2387-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-20-2387-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nUtilizing peatlands for agriculture leads to large emissions of greenhouse gases worldwide. The emissions are triggered by lowering the water table, which is a necessary step in order to make peatlands arable. Many countries aim at reducing their emissions by restoring peatlands, which can be achieved by stopping agricultural activities and thereby raising the water table. We estimate a total emission of 2.6 Mt CO2-eq for organic-rich peatlands in Denmark and a potential reduction of 77 %.\n\nRelationships between greenhouse gas production and landscape position during short-term permafrost thaw under anaerobic conditions in the Lena Delta\n\nMÃ©lissa Laurent, Matthias Fuchs, Tanja Herbst, Alexandra Runge, Susanne Liebner, and Claire C. Treat\n\nBiogeosciences, 20, 2049–2064, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-20-2049-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-20-2049-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn this study we investigated the effect of different parameters (temperature, landscape position) on the production of greenhouse gases during a 1-year permafrost thaw experiment. For very similar carbon and nitrogen contents, our results show a strong heterogeneity in CH4 production, as well as in microbial abundance. According to our study, these differences are mainly due to the landscape position and the hydrological conditions established as a result of the topography.\n\nCarbon emissions and radiative forcings from tundra wildfires in the YukonâKuskokwim River Delta, Alaska\n\nMichael Moubarak, Seeta Sistla, Stefano Potter, Susan M. Natali, and Brendan M. Rogers\n\nBiogeosciences, 20, 1537–1557, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-20-1537-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-20-1537-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nTundra wildfires are increasing in frequency and severity with climate change. We show using a combination of field measurements and computational modeling that tundra wildfires result in a positive feedback to climate change by emitting significant amounts of long-lived greenhouse gasses. With these effects, attention to tundra fires is necessary for mitigating climate change.\n\nCarbon monoxide (CO) cycling in the Fram Strait, Arctic Ocean\n\nHanna I. Campen, Damian L. ArÃ©valo-MartÃ­nez, and Hermann W. Bange\n\nBiogeosciences, 20, 1371–1379, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-20-1371-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-20-1371-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nCarbon monoxide (CO) is a climate-relevant trace gas emitted from the ocean. However, oceanic CO cycling is understudied. Results from incubation experiments conducted in the Fram Strait (Arctic Ocean) indicated that (i) pH did not affect CO cycling and (ii) enhanced CO production and consumption were positively correlated with coloured dissolved organic matter and nitrate concentrations. This suggests microbial CO uptake to be the driving factor for CO cycling in the Arctic Ocean.\n\nPost-flooding disturbance recovery promotes carbon capture in riparian zones\n\nYihong Zhu, Ruihua Liu, Huai Zhang, Shaoda Liu, Zhengfeng Zhang, Fei-Hai Yu, and Timothy G. Gregoire\n\nBiogeosciences, 20, 1357–1370, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-20-1357-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-20-1357-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWith global warming, the risk of flooding is rising, but the response of the carbon cycle of aquatic and associated riparian systems to flooding is still unclear. Based on the data collected in the Lijiang, we found that flooding would lead to significant carbon emissions of fluvial areas and riparian areas during flooding, but carbon capture may happen after flooding. In the riparian areas, the surviving vegetation, especially clonal plants, played a vital role in this transformation.\n\nMeteorological responses of carbon dioxide and methane fluxes in the terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems of a subarctic landscape\n\nLauri Heiskanen, Juha-Pekka Tuovinen, Henriikka Vekuri, Aleksi RÃ¤sÃ¤nen, Tarmo Virtanen, Sari Juutinen, Annalea Lohila, Juha Mikola, and Mika Aurela\n\nBiogeosciences, 20, 545–572, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-20-545-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-20-545-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe measured and modelled the CO2 and CH4 fluxes of the terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems of the subarctic landscape for 2 years. The landscape was an annual CO2 sink and a CH4 source. The forest had the largest contribution to the landscape-level CO2 sink and the peatland to the CH4 emissions. The lakes released 24 % of the annual net C uptake of the landscape back to the atmosphere. The C fluxes were affected most by the rainy peak growing season of 2017 and the drought event in July 2018.\n\nCarbon emission and export from the Ket River, western Siberia\n\nArtem G. Lim, Ivan V. Krickov, Sergey N. Vorobyev, Mikhail A. Korets, Sergey Kopysov, Liudmila S. Shirokova, Jan Karlsson, and Oleg S. Pokrovsky\n\nBiogeosciences, 19, 5859–5877, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-19-5859-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-19-5859-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn order to quantify C transport and emission and main environmental factors controlling the C cycle in Siberian rivers, we investigated the largest tributary of the Ob River, the Ket River basin, by measuring spatial and seasonal variations in carbon CO2 and CH4 concentrations and emissions together with hydrochemical analyses. The obtained results are useful for large-scale modeling of C emission and export fluxes from permafrost-free boreal rivers of an underrepresented region of the world.\n\nEvaluation of wetland CH4 in the Joint UK Land Environment Simulator (JULES) land surface model using satellite observations\n\nRobert J. Parker, Chris Wilson, Edward Comyn-Platt, Garry Hayman, Toby R. Marthews, A. Anthony Bloom, Mark F. Lunt, Nicola Gedney, Simon J. Dadson, Joe McNorton, Neil Humpage, Hartmut Boesch, Martyn P. Chipperfield, Paul I. Palmer, and Dai Yamazaki\n\nBiogeosciences, 19, 5779–5805, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-19-5779-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-19-5779-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWetlands are the largest natural source of methane, one of the most important climate gases. The JULES land surface model simulates these emissions. We use satellite data to evaluate how well JULES reproduces the methane seasonal cycle over different tropical wetlands. It performs well for most regions; however, it struggles for some African wetlands influenced heavily by river flooding. We explain the reasons for these deficiencies and highlight how future development will improve these areas.\n\nGreenhouse gas fluxes in mangrove forest soil in an Amazon estuary\n\nSaÃºl Edgardo MartÃ­nez CastellÃ³n, JosÃ© Henrique Cattanio, JosÃ© Francisco BerrÃªdo, Marcelo Rollnic, Maria de Lourdes Ruivo, and Carlos Noriega\n\nBiogeosciences, 19, 5483–5497, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-19-5483-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-19-5483-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe seek to understand the influence of climatic seasonality and microtopography on CO2 and CH4 fluxes in an Amazonian mangrove. Topography and seasonality had a contrasting influence when comparing the two gas fluxes: CO2 fluxes were greater in high topography in the dry period, and CH4 fluxes were greater in the rainy season in low topography. Only CO2 fluxes were correlated with soil organic matter, the proportion of carbon and nitrogen, and redox potential.\n\nTemporal patterns and drivers of CO2 emission from dry sediments in a groyne field of a large river\n\nMatthias Koschorreck, Klaus Holger Knorr, and Lelaina Teichert\n\nBiogeosciences, 19, 5221–5236, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-19-5221-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-19-5221-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAt low water levels, parts of the bottom of rivers fall dry. These beaches or mudflats emit the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide (CO2) to the atmosphere. We found that those emissions are caused by microbial reactions in the sediment and that they change with time. Emissions were influenced by many factors like temperature, water level, rain, plants, and light.\n\nEffects of water table level and nitrogen deposition on methane and nitrous oxide emissions in an alpine peatland\n\nWantong Zhang, Zhengyi Hu, Joachim Audet, Thomas A. Davidson, Enze Kang, Xiaoming Kang, Yong Li, Xiaodong Zhang, and Jinzhi Wang\n\nBiogeosciences, 19, 5187–5197, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-19-5187-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-19-5187-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis work focused on the CH4 and N2O emissions from alpine peatlands in response to the interactive effects of altered water table levels and increased nitrogen deposition. Across the 2-year mesocosm experiment, nitrogen deposition showed nonlinear effects on CH4 emissions and linear effects on N2O emissions, and these N effects were associated with the water table levels. Our results imply the future scenario of strengthened CH4 and N2O emissions from an alpine peatland.\n\nHighest methane concentrations in an Arctic river linked to local terrestrial inputs\n\nKarel Castro-Morales, Anna Canning, Sophie Arzberger, Will A. Overholt, Kirsten KÃ¼sel, Olaf Kolle, Mathias GÃ¶ckede, Nikita Zimov, and Arne KÃ¶rtzinger\n\nBiogeosciences, 19, 5059–5077, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-19-5059-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-19-5059-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nPermafrost thaw releases methane that can be emitted into the atmosphere or transported by Arctic rivers. Methane measurements are lacking in large Arctic river regions. In the Kolyma River (northeast Siberia), we measured dissolved methane to map its distribution with great spatial detail. The riverâs edge and river junctions had the highest methane concentrations compared to other river areas. Microbial communities in the river showed that the riverâs methane likely is from the adjacent land.\n\nSeasonal study of the small-scale variability in dissolved methane in the western Kiel Bight (Baltic Sea) during the European heatwave in 2018\n\nSonja Gindorf, Hermann W. Bange, Dennis Booge, and Annette Kock\n\nBiogeosciences, 19, 4993–5006, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-19-4993-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-19-4993-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nMethane is a climate-relevant greenhouse gas which is emitted to the atmosphere from coastal areas such as the Baltic Sea. We measured the methane concentration in the water column of the western Kiel Bight. Methane concentrations were higher in September than in June. We found no relationship between the 2018 European heatwave and methane concentrations. Our results show that the methane distribution in the water column is strongly affected by temporal and spatial variabilities.\n\nTrace gas fluxes from tidal salt marsh soils: implications for carbonâsulfur biogeochemistry\n\nMargaret Capooci and Rodrigo Vargas\n\nBiogeosciences, 19, 4655–4670, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-19-4655-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-19-4655-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nTidal salt marsh soil emits greenhouse gases, as well as sulfur-based gases, which play roles in global climate but are not well studied as they are difficult to measure. Traditional methods of measuring these gases worked relatively well for carbon dioxide, but less so for methane, nitrous oxide, carbon disulfide, and dimethylsulfide. High variability of trace gases complicates the ability to accurately calculate gas budgets and new approaches are needed for monitoring protocols.\n\nSpatial and temporal variation in Î´13C values of methane emitted from a hemiboreal mire: methanogenesis, methanotrophy, and hysteresis\n\nJanne Rinne, Patryk Åakomiec, Patrik Vestin, Joel D. White, Per Weslien, Julia Kelly, Natascha Kljun, Lena StrÃ¶m, and Leif Klemedtsson\n\nBiogeosciences, 19, 4331–4349, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-19-4331-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-19-4331-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe study uses the stable isotope 13C of carbon in methane to investigate the origins of spatial and temporal variation in methane emitted by a temperate wetland ecosystem. The results indicate that methane production is more important for spatial variation than methane consumption by micro-organisms. Temporal variation on a seasonal timescale is most likely affected by more than one driver simultaneously.\n\nIntercomparison of methods to estimate gross primary production based on CO2 and COS flux measurements\n\nKukka-Maaria Kohonen, Roderick Dewar, Gianluca Tramontana, Aleksanteri Mauranen, Pasi Kolari, Linda M. J. Kooijmans, Dario Papale, Timo Vesala, and Ivan Mammarella\n\nBiogeosciences, 19, 4067–4088, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-19-4067-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-19-4067-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nFour different methods for quantifying photosynthesis (GPP) at ecosystem scale were tested, of which two are based on carbon dioxide (CO2) and two on carbonyl sulfide (COS) flux measurements. CO2-based methods are traditional partitioning, and a new method uses machine learning. We introduce a novel method for calculating GPP from COS fluxes, with potentially better applicability than the former methods. Both COS-based methods gave on average higher GPP estimates than the CO2-based estimates.\n\nLateral carbon export has low impact on the net ecosystem carbon balance of a polygonal tundra catchment\n\nLutz Beckebanze, Benjamin R. K. Runkle, Josefine Walz, Christian Wille, David Holl, Manuel Helbig, Julia Boike, Torsten Sachs, and Lars Kutzbach\n\nBiogeosciences, 19, 3863–3876, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-19-3863-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-19-3863-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn this study, we present observations of lateral and vertical carbon fluxes from a permafrost-affected study site in the Russian Arctic. From this dataset we estimate the net ecosystem carbon balance for this study site. We show that lateral carbon export has a low impact on the net ecosystem carbon balance during the complete study period (3 months). Nevertheless, our results also show that lateral carbon export can exceed vertical carbon uptake at the beginning of the growing season.\n\nThe effect of static chamber base on N2O flux in drip irrigation\n\nShahar Baram, Asher Bar-Tal, Alon Gal, Shmulik P. Friedman, and David Russo\n\nBiogeosciences, 19, 3699–3711, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-19-3699-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-19-3699-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nStatic chambers are the most common tool used to measure greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes. We tested the impact of such chambers on nitrous oxide emissions in drip irrigation. Field measurements and 3-D simulations show that the chamber base drastically affects the water and nutrient distribution in the soil and hence the measured GHG fluxes. A nomogram is suggested to determine the optimal diameter of a cylindrical chamber that ensures minimal disturbance.\n\nControls on autotrophic and heterotrophic respiration in an ombrotrophic bog\n\nTracy E. Rankin, Nigel T. Roulet, and Tim R. Moore\n\nBiogeosciences, 19, 3285–3303, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-19-3285-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-19-3285-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nPeatland respiration is made up of plant and peat sources. How to separate these sources is not well known as peat respiration is not straightforward and is more influenced by vegetation dynamics than previously thought. Results of plot level measurements from shrubs and sparse grasses in a woody bog show that plants' respiration response to changes in climate is related to their different root structures, implying a difference in the mechanisms by which they obtain water resources.\n\nEpisodic N2O emissions following tillage of a legumeâgrass cover crop mixture\n\nAlison Bressler and Jennifer Blesh\n\nBiogeosciences, 19, 3169–3184, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-19-3169-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-19-3169-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nOur field experiment tested if a mixture of a nitrogen-fixing legume and non-legume cover crop could reduce nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions following tillage, compared to the legume grown alone. We found higher N2O following both legume treatments, compared to those without, and lower emissions from the cover crop mixture at one of the two test sites, suggesting that interactions between cover crop types and soil quality influence N2O emissions.\n\nVariation in CO2 and CH4 fluxes among land cover types in heterogeneous Arctic tundra in northeastern Siberia\n\nSari Juutinen, Mika Aurela, Juha-Pekka Tuovinen, Viktor Ivakhov, Maiju Linkosalmi, Aleksi RÃ¤sÃ¤nen, Tarmo Virtanen, Juha Mikola, Johanna Nyman, Emmi VÃ¤hÃ¤, Marina Loskutova, Alexander Makshtas, and Tuomas Laurila\n\nBiogeosciences, 19, 3151–3167, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-19-3151-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-19-3151-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe measured CO2 and CH4 fluxes in heterogenous Arctic tundra in eastern Siberia. We found that tundra wetlands with sedge and grass vegetation contributed disproportionately to the landscape's ecosystem CO2 uptake and CH4 emissions to the atmosphere. Moreover, we observed high CH4 consumption in dry tundra, particularly in barren areas, offsetting part of the CH4 emissions from the wetlands.\n\nResponse of vegetation and carbon fluxes to brown lemming herbivory in northern Alaska\n\nJessica Plein, Rulon W. Clark, Kyle A. Arndt, Walter C. Oechel, Douglas Stow, and Donatella Zona\n\nBiogeosciences, 19, 2779–2794, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-19-2779-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-19-2779-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nTundra vegetation and the carbon balance of Arctic ecosystems can be substantially impacted by herbivory. We tested how herbivory by brown lemmings in individual enclosure plots have impacted carbon exchange of tundra ecosystems via altering carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) fluxes. Lemmings significantly decreased net CO2 uptake while not affecting CH4 emissions. There was no significant difference in the subsequent growing season due to recovery of the vegetation.\n\nSources of nitrous oxide and the fate of mineral nitrogen in subarctic permafrost peat soils\n\nJenie Gil, Maija E. Marushchak, Tobias RÃ¼tting, Elizabeth M. Baggs, Tibisay PÃ©rez, Alexander Novakovskiy, Tatiana Trubnikova, Dmitry Kaverin, Pertti J. Martikainen, and Christina Biasi\n\nBiogeosciences, 19, 2683–2698, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-19-2683-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-19-2683-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nN2O emissions from permafrost soils represent up to 11.6 % of total N2O emissions from natural soils, and their contribution to the global N2O budget will likely increase due to climate change. A better understanding of N2O production from permafrost soil is needed to evaluate the role of arctic ecosystems in the global N2O budget. By studying microbial N2O production processes in N2O hotspots in permafrost peatlands, we identified denitrification as the dominant source of N2O in these surfaces.\n\nData-based estimates of interannual seaâair CO2 flux variations 1957â2020 and their relation to environmental drivers\n\nChristian RÃ¶denbeck, Tim DeVries, Judith Hauck, Corinne Le QuÃ©rÃ©, and Ralph F. Keeling\n\nBiogeosciences, 19, 2627–2652, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-19-2627-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-19-2627-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe ocean is an important part of the global carbon cycle, taking up about a quarter of the anthropogenic CO2 emitted by burning of fossil fuels and thus slowing down climate change. However, the CO2 uptake by the ocean is, in turn, affected by variability and trends in climate. Here we use carbon measurements in the surface ocean to quantify the response of the oceanic CO2 exchange to environmental conditions and discuss possible mechanisms underlying this response.\n\nEvaluating alternative ebullition models for predicting peatland methane emission and its pathways via dataâmodel fusion\n\nShuang Ma, Lifen Jiang, Rachel M. Wilson, Jeff P. Chanton, Scott Bridgham, Shuli Niu, Colleen M. Iversen, Avni Malhotra, Jiang Jiang, Xingjie Lu, Yuanyuan Huang, Jason Keller, Xiaofeng Xu, Daniel M. Ricciuto, Paul J. Hanson, and Yiqi Luo\n\nBiogeosciences, 19, 2245–2262, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-19-2245-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-19-2245-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe relative ratio of wetland methane (CH4) emission pathways determines how much CH4 is oxidized before leaving the soil. We found an ebullition modeling approach that has a better performance in deep layer pore water CH4 concentration. We suggest using this approach in land surface models to accurately represent CH4 emission dynamics and response to climate change. Our results also highlight that both CH4 flux and belowground concentration data are important to constrain model parameters.\n\nExcess soil moisture and fresh carbon input are prerequisites for methane production in podzolic soil\n\nMika Korkiakoski, Tiia MÃ¤Ã¤ttÃ¤, Krista Peltoniemi, Timo PenttilÃ¤, and Annalea Lohila\n\nBiogeosciences, 19, 2025–2041, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-19-2025-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-19-2025-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe measured CH4 fluxes and production and oxidation potentials from irrigated and non-irrigated podzolic soil in a boreal forest. CH4 sink was smaller at the irrigated site but did not cause CH4 emission, with one exception. We also showed that under laboratory conditions, not only wet conditions, but also fresh carbon, are needed to make podzolic soil into a CH4 source. Our study provides important data for improving the process models describing the upland soil CH4 dynamics.\n\nCited articles"
