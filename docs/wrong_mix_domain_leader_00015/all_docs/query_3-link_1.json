        "text": "At Helsinki (Helsingfors),* capital of Finland, 300 Finnish citizens assembled under the Chairmanship of Premier Lauri Ingman. They were the electors appointed by the people to elect a President for the years 1925-31 in succession to Dr. Kaarlo Juho Stahlberg who, amid many protestations, had declined to stand for reelection.\n\nPresident Stahlberg, the first President of Finland since that country, in 1917, declared itself free and independent of Russia, was elected by the Diet in 1919. The present popular presidential election is the first to be held.\n\nUnder a system of proportionate representation, M. Lauri Relander, Governor of Viipuri (Viborg), Agrarian, defeated his nearest rival, M. Ryti, Governor of the State Bank, Progressive, on the third ballot by 172 to 109 votes.†\n\nThe second President of the Finnish Republic is a leading light in the Agrarian Party. His name was put forward at the last moment and his election was due to the almost solid vote of the Conservatives, which, in a country seething with Bolshevism only a few years ago, is a significant fact.\n\nBeside being famous for her Nurmi, Finland was the first country in the world to grant suffrage to women; this was done in 1907 without any agitation on the part of the females.\n\n* The names in parentheses are the Swedish, the official languages of Finland being Swedish and Finnish.\n\n† Said jokesters, jape-makers: “Paavo Nurmi did not run!” (Paavo Nurmi is, as everyone knows, the famed Finnish runner, who in the past seven weeks has established 26 new world’s records, competing in the U. S.)"
