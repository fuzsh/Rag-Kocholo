        "text": "Finnish engineer, businessman and vuorineuvos\n\nJulius Stjernvall (26 October 1874 – 6 May 1939) was a Finnish engineer, businessman and vuorineuvos.\n\nStjernvall worked as manager in Finnish branch of Siemens & Halske 1904–1914 and subsequently in Kone ja Silta until 1929; the company grew during his time through new products and acquisitions. He was Minister of Trade and Industry in the short-lived Lauri Ingman's cabinet in 1918–1919[5]\n\nStjernvall's parents were colonel Carl Julius Stjernvall and Maria née Jakovlev. He graduated from Finnish Cadet School in Hamina in 1896.[1][2] During his studies he served as ensign in 132nd Bender Infantry Regiment. He was later promoted lieutenant in 1907 when he was already in reserve.[2] Stjernvall continued his studies in Polytechnic Institute in Helsinki and graduated in 1900 as Mechanical Engineer.[1][2][3]\n\nDuring 1904–1914, Stjernvall led technical office of Siemens & Halske in Helsinki;[1][2][3] in this period the company built the first steam turbine power plant of Finland in Tampere and connected Sveaborg to electrical grid through an undersea cable.[2] Stjernvall represented nobility and chivalry in Diet of Finland in 1904–1905.[2] In 1914, shortly before the First World War Stjernvall moved to Kone- ja Siltarakennus (Kone ja Silta) as Deputy Director.[1][2] Due to intense arms race between the European superpowers prior the war, the company had a good order backlog from the Russian military; Kone ja Silta produced munition and other military supplies, and repaired ships of the Imperial Russian Navy.[2] Stjernvall became company manager in 1917.[1][2][3] In the same year, Finland became independent. In 1918, Swedish People's Party of Finland asked him to join in Lauri Ingman's cabinet as Minister of Trade and Industry. Stjernvall agreed, but the cabinet turned out to be short-living, and already after few months, he was back.[1][2]\n\nKone ja Silta grew strongly during Stjernvall's time. In 1923, the company started producing Abloy locks.[2] Kone ja Silta took over Hietalahti Shipyard and Engineering Works[1][2] on 22 December 1926. The articles of association were changed uniform with Kone ja Silta in December 1927, after which both companies shared the same management.[4]\n\nIn 1928–1929, the company turnover reached 90 million marks and made 3 million marks' profit. At the time Kone ja Silta employed 1 300 people.[2]\n\nStjernvall was entitled vuorineuvos in 1924.[1][2]\n\nStjernvall handed over his managerial post of Hietalahti Shipyard and Engineering works to Robert Lavonius on 1 April 1929.[4] At the end of the same year, he submitted his resignation to Kone ja Silta for health reasons.[1][2]\n\nAfter his resignation, Stjernvall continued in positions of trust in Helsingin Osakepankki (HOP).[1][2] Between 1918 and 1939, Stjernvall was twice the chairman of the Board.[2]\n\nStjernvall had no family. A street was named after him, Stjernvallintie in Kulosaari, until it was renamed Vuorineuvoksentie in 1958.[1][2]"
