Knights of the Hospital of Saint Mary of the Teutonic House in Jerusalem (Teutonic Order)

Teutonic Order Flag

9 Nov 1190 Teutonic Order, or in full the Order of the Knights (or Brethren)

of the House of Saint Mary of the Teutonic House in Jerusalem

(in Latin: Ordo domus Sanctae Mariae Theutonicorum

Hierosolymitanorum [in German: Orden der Ritter (or Brüder)

des Haus Sankt Marien des Deutschen Hauses zu Jerusalem])

in the Holy Land set up by merchants from Bremen and Lübeck

at Crusader encampment during the siege of Akko (Acre) by

Guy de Lusignan, King of Jerusalem.

5 Mar 1198 Reorganized as a military order (on model of Templars)

(recognized by Pope Innocent III as such on 19 Feb 1199).

1211 - 1225 Active in Transylvania against the pagan Qypçak (Kumans).

1219 - 24 Apr 1809 Mergentheim (Marienthal) in Franconia, Germany a possession

of the Order.

1224 Duke Conrad of Mazovia, appeals to the Grand Master Hermann

von Salza for assistance against the warlike Prussians, who had periodically fought Poland. The Order promised control of Courland and Livonia (see under Latvia). 1226 Grand Master (Hochmeister) of the Teutonic Order is granted by the Emperor all the privileges and (from Jun 1230) style of the prince of the Empire. The knights are entitled to subject the Prussians on behalf of the Empire. 1230 Seat of the Grand Master at Montfort castle (al-Qurayn in Arabic; 35 km north of Haifa, originally calledCastellum novum regis), sold to the Order in 1228. 1256 - 1268 Lordship of the Schuf (an offshoot of the Lordship of Sidon), inland

from modern Saida in Lebanona, a possession of the Order.

1271 Montfort lost, seat of the Grand Master moved to Akko/Acre.

1291 Seat of the Grand Master moved from Akko (Akkon) to Venice

upon the conquest of Akko 18 May 1291.

9 Sep 1309 Seat of the Grand Master (Hochmeister) is moved from Venice to Marienburg (Malbork) in Prussia. The Grand Master takes over direct administration of the Prussian branch. With the loss of Marienburg 19 Oct 1466, the seat is moved to Königsberg.

1378 - 1409 During the Great Schism in the Papacy, the Order in Marienburg

continues to recognize the Papal court in Rome rather the rival

in Avignon, France.

9 Apr 1525 The Hochmeister Albrecht Markgraf von Brandenburg-Ansbach

having converted to Protestantism, he becomes hereditary

Duke of Prussia. Order survives under the Deutschmeister Walter

von Cronberg.

16 Dec 1526 Seat of the Grand Master is moved to Mergentheim.

9 Feb 1801 By the Peace of Lunéville (and Treaty of Amiens of 25 Mar 1802) its

sovereign possessions on the left-bank of the Rhine River were

distributed among the neighboring German sovereigns.

26 Dec 1805 By article 12 of the Treaty of Pressburg, between Austria and France, all the possessions of the Grand Magistery at Mergentheim

and all those given in exchange earlier were attached to what was to be a hereditary Grand Mastership, invested in the male line of the Imperial House of Austria.

17 Feb 1806 Austrian Emperor Francis I acknowledged his brother Anton as Grand Master of the Teutonic Order, confirming the provisions of the Treaty of Pressburg, until such time as it would become an hereditary dignity and also imposed some limitations on the scope of the Treaty, to the detriment of the Order. The sovereign status recognized in the Treaty of Pressburg was to be attributed to whichever Prince of the House of Austria would in future hold the title of Grand Master, but this would be a limited sovereignty, subordinated to the "Headship of the Imperial House of Austria."

12 Jul 1806 Formation of the Confederation of the Rhine cost the Order its

possession of several more commanderies granted to Baden, Bavaria

and Württemberg.

24 Apr 1809 Order is dissolved in German lands by Napoléon, but survives

in Austrian lands under Habsburg protection. Mergentheim is

annexed to annexed to Frankfurt (from 24 Apr 1810, Württemberg).

12 Dec 1810 Prussian secularization commission confiscates the lands of the order in Prussia (only the possessions in Austria remain).

8 Mar 1834 Emperor of Austria returns to the Teutonic knights all the rights

enjoyed by the Treaty of Pressburg, abrogating the limitation on

those rights imposed by the Decree of 17 Feb 1806. The Order was

declared to be an "Autonomous, Religious and Military Institute"

under the protection of the Emperor, with an Archduke as

Hoch- und Deutschmeister (confirmed by imperial patent Jun 1840).

30 Jun 1923 The last Austrian Archduke resigns as hereditary Hoch- und

Deutschmeister of the Oder.

27 Nov 1929 Teutonic Order is reconstituted as a purely religious order by

the Pope. Fratres domus hospitalis sanctae Mariae Teutonicorum

in Jerusalem (Teutonic Order of Saint Marys Hospital in Jerusalem

- Deutscher Orden - German Order).

6 Sep 1938 - 1947 Order was dissolved in Austria by Germany.
