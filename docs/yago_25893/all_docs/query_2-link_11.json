        "text": "Olivia Spencer and Natalia Rivera Aitoro, often referred to by the portmanteau Otalia, are a fictional couple from the American CBS daytime drama Guiding Light. Olivia is portrayed by Crystal Chappell, and Natalia is portrayed by Jessica Leccia.\n\nThe storyline begins when Olivia and Natalia’s relationship starts to evolve around the discovery of Olivia’s heart ailment in late 2007. The couple’s relationship subsequently changes from being enemies over Gus (Natalia’s husband) and his death (April 2008), to close friends who rely on each other, and finally to women becoming more than friends. It was a slow burning love-story, with classic soap elements told in a new and modern way. They got their happily-ever after as the soap was cancelled and went off the air in September 2009."
