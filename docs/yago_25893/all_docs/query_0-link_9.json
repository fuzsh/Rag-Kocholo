        "text": "As an FBI agent, Gus was brought into Springfield to bring down the Santos Crime family. He was soon mixed up with Blake Marler, who had written a novel about them, and tried to unravel what she really knew. She eventually discovered Gus' true identity; he was the son of a cop killed by Miguel Santos. When this came out, combined with allegations of evidence tampering, his career was ruined. He stuck around town as a PI and got involved with Harley Cooper, who was carrying Rick's baby at the time. By a trick of fate, Gus ended up helping her deliver her baby and the two began a lengthy courtship which could only be consummated once Gus gave up his vendetta against Harley's friend Danny Santos.\n\nThe couple began facing numerous obstacles, Marina attempted to frame Gus for sex with a juvenile, Phillip and Frank tried to break them up by exposing Gus' criminal record. But they stuck together and, after Harley was shot on duty, he proposed to her. They continued to stay together as Gus' skeletons came out of the closet one by one. It turned out that his sister was a madam and his father was a dirty cop who wasn't actually his father. Alan Spaulding was his biological father. He'd had a fling with Phillip's nanny who then gave up the child for adoption. Although this wasn't easy for anyone to take, Gus soon developed some sympathy with Alan when he managed to stop him from jumping off a bridge during one of his delirious episodes. Offering to help Alan, he discovered that Alex had been drugging him and they developed some level of trust. Gus would later come to work at Spaulding for a period after Phillip's mental collapse. However, Gus and Jeffrey began investigating Spaulding's relationship with the Antimonius drug ring. This put a strain on his relationship to Harley and his own family as he tried to balance his silence and keep them all out of jail. Harley demanded that he abandon his family and, refusing, they split up. However, his loyalty to his new found family faltered when he realized how unhinged Phillip had become as he waged war on the Coopers. This reached its peak when Phillip was murdered and Harley stood accused. Gus couldn't stop his feelings from her and relentlessly attempted to prove her innocence in the courtroom while bribing witnesses and threatening Alan. She was convicted anyway, but he didn't stop looking for Phillip's real killer. After being abducted, he escaped and tried to break Harley out of jail but failed. Returning to Alan, he tried to hang the crime on Olivia until it came out that Alan was the culprit.\n\nReunited when she was freed, Harley and Gus wed and he broke from his family in disgust. Surprisingly, she took over his position at Spaulding and he returned to the police force. He bonded with his half-brother Alan-Michael and attempted to keep Alan from taking over the company. He abducted Alan to force him to confess to the murder before the two of them were abducted by Beth. After a series of double crosses, they each made their way back to Springfield and Gus, suffering from injuries incurred in his captivity, became a drug addict. With pressure from Harley, he managed to kick his habit and devote himself to their family. Once Frank reluctantly allowed him to come back to work under scrutiny, the couple planned for a baby until Gus learned that he had been made sterile by a chemical agent during a job for the FBI. Crushed, he abducted a baby, Sydney, which he and Harley fought to adopt. In the process, they brought Harley's daughter, Daisy, back into the fold, a move which damned the already flawed enterprise. After Sydney was taken away, Gus tried to be the intermediary between Harley and her daughter as they fought. Unfortunately this led to Daisy developing a crush on Gus and pursuing him. This caused a great deal of friction in the family and almost cost Gus his life when Daisy drugged him so that she could take advantage of him and then left a candle to burn, causing the room they were in to catch fire.\n\nGus' problems with women got more complicated soon. His former high school lover, Natalia, landed in Springfield after Daisy alerted her to his whereabouts in a bid to break he and Harley up. Although this caused tension in his marriage, it wasn't until he discovered that she had been hiding his son, Rafe, from him that things became worse. Though Gus tried to stay devoted to Harley and the boys, he couldn't stay away from Natalia and their son. After sleeping with Natalia, he and Harley broke up and he moved into the Spaulding mansion with her and Rafe. While he tried to build a relationship with them, Alan tried to snag Natalia away by sending Olivia to seduce Gus. This failed and Natalia and Gus were eventually married. Their marriage was compromised, however, by Gus' attempts to help Olivia as she suffered from heart problems. He even spent his honeymoon looking after Olivia rather than with Natalia. He and Natalia pretended to break up so that he could give Olivia some happy time before she died. Secretly, he bought Natalia a house so that they could start a new life together and he began to reconcile with his father. When Olivia vanished from the hospital, he went in search for her on a motorcycle, only to die when it skidded off the road. On his death bed he told Harley that he still loved her and Olivia, who was not made aware of Gus's death, was told there was a heart ready to transplant into her. After she woke up, she heard that the heart was Gus'."
