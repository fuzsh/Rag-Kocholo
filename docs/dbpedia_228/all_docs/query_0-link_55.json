        "text": "27.06.02\n\nTV DRAMA\n\nRehab - a powerful new drama for BBC TWO\n\nFilming has begun on Rehab, a powerful drama for BBC TWO from acclaimed director Antonia Bird (Care, Priest, Safe), which takes a hard-hitting look at one of the most pressing social issues of our times - the rehabilitation of drug users, it was announced today by Jane Tranter, BBC Controller of Drama Commissioning.\n\nCo-produced by Ruth Caleb and Antonia Bird who last worked together on the multi-award-winning Care, Rehab stars Caroline Patterson (EastEnders), Gary Lewis (Billy Elliot), Kate Hardie (Croupier), Daniel Mays (All or Nothing), Katy Cavanagh (Cops) and Andrew Tiernan (The Pianist).\n\nRehab is a moving story of people struggling to get clean. But first they must come to terms with the demons in their past and keep each other, and themselves, from giving up on the fight to get through the toughest time of their lives.\n\nJane Tranter said: \"Antonia has a history of making stylish, entertaining and accessible films about uncomfortable issues which impact on many people.\n\n\"Rehab is an ambitious drama which addresses a difficult subject with verve, humour and imagination.\"\n\nRehab was created during a series of improvisation workshops.\n\nThe cast worked with Antonia Bird and writer Rona Munro (Ladybird, Ladybird and Bumping the Odds), who spent time living in a rehabilitation centre in preparation for the project, over a five-week period to shape the final script.\n\nOther cast members include Freddie Cunliffe (War Zone), Paul Popplewell (24 Hour Party People), Marcel McCalla (101 Dalmations) and Richard Harrington (Care).\n\nProducer/Director Antonia Bird said: \"I've always been struck by the complexity of a world where drugs kill and cure. Where no-one is immune.\n\n\"Learning to face reality, refusing refuge in clich√©s and lies; fighting to find a way out: that's what Rehab is about.\n\n\"As one of the characters says, 'These are some of the strongest people you'll ever meet. This is the hardest thing they've ever done.' We can all learn from them.\"\n\nRuth Caleb's recent credits include Tomorrow La Scala!, When I Was 12, and Last Resort (also for BBC Films).\n\nCaleb and Bird worked together on Care, which recently won the Prix Italia for Best Drama (singles) as well as the BAFTA Award for Best Single Drama.\n\nAt the same awards, Caleb received the Alan Clarke Award for Creative Contribution to Television.\n\nRehab is a BBC production in association with 4Way Films. The executive producer is Laura Mackie. Written by Rona Munro, Rehab is produced by Antonia Bird and Ruth Caleb and directed by Antonia Bird.\n\nRehab is the first production from 4Way Pictures, a new company formed by Antonia Bird, Robert Carlyle, Mark Cousins and recently joined by Irvine Welsh.\n\nThey are developing an extensive slate of feature films and TV projects, including Antonia and Irvine's film Hotel California (with BBC Films) and a co-production with the legendary American indie director John Sayles, starring Robert Carlyle as Jamie Macgillivray.\n\nBACK TO THE TOP\n\nPRINTABLE VERSION"
