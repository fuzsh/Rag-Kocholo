        "text": "The following, rated on a system of 0 to 4 stars, are by Rick Groen and Liam Lacey. Full reviews appeared on the dates indicated. American Psycho **½ Based on Bret Easton Ellis's notorious tome, the film is a lot easier to watch than the book was to read. Casting a chiselled Christian Bales in the title role (Wall Street paragon by day, cold serial killer by night), director Mary Harron whisks the novel's gruesome sexual detail right out of the picture. Instead, she serves up the tale as a black and modestly entertaining comedy, keeping the focus squarely on the theme of corporate conformity and consumer greed. But since that theme is rather mundane, and the satiric targets all too easy, the film has the unintentional effect of exposing Ellis for what he is -- a guy who, when you get past his ghastly anatomy lessons, doesn't have very much to say. R (April 14) -- R.G. Black and White ** The theme of James Toback's semi-improvised, rambling film is about rich white kids in New York who are devotees of black hip-hop culture, but no real insight here, just attitude, film-school clutter and bad melodrama. R (April 5) -- L.L. East-West **½ Back in 1992, director Régis Wargnier won a foreign film Oscar for Indochine, a tale of grand passions set against the turmoil of history. Here, he's back on similar turf with the Oscar-nominated East-West, about a Russian doctor and his French wife (Sandrine Bonnaire) who move to Stalin's Russia after the Second World War, in a misguided effort to help rebuild the country. PG (March 31) -- L.L. Full Blast **½ The town is small, its only factory is shut down, and the young men are idle, drifting on an aimless tide of sex and suds and rock 'n' roll. What lends this familiar tale a measure of distinction is the New Brunswick setting, a strong ensemble cast, and director Rodrigue Jean's keen eye for local detail. So the provincial begins to resonate. Not a lot -- as titles go, Full Blast is a misnomer -- but enough to command our attention. And half a blast ain't half bad. R (April 7) -- R.G. Here on Earth * Hell's bells and heaven forfend. This glum and torturous tearjerker wastes a good young cast, which includes Chris Klein ( American Pie, Election) as a rich, preppie boy who gets involved with a small-town girl (LeeLee Sobieski), while her rural sweetheart (Josh Hartnett) looks on and glowers, until tragedy makes everything okay. PG (March 24) -- L.L. High Fidelity *** Director Stephen Frears's ( The Grifters) lightweight, funny adaptation of English writer Nick Hornby's novel about the romantic misadventures of a pop-music-besotted underachiever translates nicely to its Chicago setting. John Cusack, who helped write the screenplay, stars as a record-shop owner who is determined to figure out why none of his relationships ever works. AA (March 31) -- L.L. The Hurricane *** Denzel Washington offers an Oscar-demanding performance here, as Rubin (Hurricane) Carter -- immortalized in a Bob Dylan song -- the New Jersey boxer unjustly imprisoned for almost 30 years for a triple murder, before a group of Canadians decided to take on his cause. Norman Jewison's film is old-fashioned and inspirational. AA (Dec. 29) -- L.L. The Jaundiced Eye **½ Though it doesn't break any real new ground, this investigative documentary about a gay man and his father who were accused of child molesting is unsettling. The film makes a persuasive case that the two men were punished because of the community's antigay bias, fuelled by child-abuse hysteria. They were subsequently vindicated, but only after their lives were torn apart. NA (April 7) -- L.L. A Map of the World *** Sigourney Weaver stars as a woman wrongly accused of child abuse in what is, essentially, a contrived soap-opera plot invested with a lot of care. Weaver, as the smart, iconoclastic school nurse who can't play by the ordinary rules, creates a complex, engaging character and the rest of the cast is also rock solid, including David Straithairn, Julianne Moore and Chloe Sevigny. AA (March 3) -- L.L. Post Mortem *** This Genie Award-winning first film from Quebec's Louis Bélanger is cleverly conceived and even more smartly cast. The movie divides into three parts: The first is about a tough and sexy single mother (Sylvie Moreau) who provides for her daughter by picking up strange men, conking them on the heads and stealing their money. The second story concerns a doleful morgue attendant (Gabriel Arcand) who is charged with rape. The concluding segment takes a surprising, if facile, turn. Give Bélanger credit though: He's definitely found a new twist to an old-fashioned love story. AA (March 31) -- L.L. Price of Glory ** A former prize fighter (Jimmy Smits) lives out his failed dreams through his three scrappy sons. Fair enough, but boxing movies are rife with potential clichés, which the script must either ward off (a rare feat) or transform into heart-warming sentiment (the more common practice). Alas, Price of Glory fails on both counts. PG (April 7) -- R.G. Return to Me **½ Actress Bonnie Hunt, a one-time nurse, puts her medical training to good use here in this genially mediocre romantic comedy about an organ transplant. Minnie Driver plays a Chicago woman who needs a new heart, and then falls in love with the widower (David Duchovny) of her donor. PG (April 7) -- L.L. The Road to El Dorado **½ In this animated musical, Kevin Kline and Kenneth Branagh provide the voices of Tulio and Miguel, a couple of 16th-century dudes who stow away on Cortes's ship and, in a bold bit of revisionism, save an Amerindian civilization. PG (March 31) -- L.L. Rules of Engagement **½ The film takes a thorny contemporary issue -- the permissible use of military force in terrorist encounters -- and wraps it in the American flag. To anyone other than an ardent hawk, the fact that this hunk of rhetoric is consistently well-acted (by Tommy Lee Jones and Samuel L. Jackson) and relatively well-directed (by William Friedkin) may seem an aesthetic plus but an ethical minus -- it merely lends an air of authenticity to a bogus message. AA (April 7) -- R.G. The Skulls ** This youth-oriented thriller stars Dawson Creek's Joshua Jackson as the college kid who makes a Faustian deal with a secret campus fraternity that will stop at nothing -- including really bad acting. The almost-saving grace of the movie is that even the filmmakers seem to know the material is laughable. AA (March 31) -- L.L. 28 Days **½ With Sandra Bullock as a recovering addict, 28 Days is a rollick in a rehab centre, a clean-but-never-sober comedy that makes a visit to Betty Ford seem like a merry month at Club Med. While scoring some laughs, it's essentially a happy-pill designed to yield moderate enjoyment while under the influence and leave absolutely no lingering after-effects. Any mood-enhancement will wear off fast -- give it about 28 seconds. AA (April 14) -- R.G. The War Zone **½ Actor Tim Roth's directorial debut is an austere, stylized rendering of Alexander Stuart's 1989 novel about a superficially ordinary English family destroyed by incest. The performances -- from veterans Ray Winstone and Tilda Swinton along with newcomers Lara Belmont and Freddie Cunliffe as their children, are uniformly powerful. The drama culminates with a controversial sex scene near the end. But the problem isn't that The War Zone goes too far, but that it doesn't go far enough in giving the story wider resonance. The result is trouble in a bubble. R (April 7) -- L.L."
