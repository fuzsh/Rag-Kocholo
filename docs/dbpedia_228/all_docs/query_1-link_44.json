        "text": "\"Things seemed to go wrong too many times\"\n\nI was a very strange child. A touch precocious, an advanced reader and a comedy obsessive, I had read Freddie Hancock's memoir detailing her marriage to Tony Hancock by the time this Screen One aired when I was eleven going on twelve. At the time I thought this play was the best thing since sliced bread and watched it several times, but I've had no inclination to revisit it since my teenage years. Until now that is, when the BBC have suddenly realised,as part of something called the 'Festival of Funny', that they actually have an archive to raid that is pre 2005.\n\nWilliam Humble's screenplay focuses on the final eight years of Hancock's life, which means that it takes a significant cue from Freddie, his second wife's, book. At almost two hours long, Hancock can afford to be richly detailed, but it just isn't. It peculiarly neglects to depict Hancock's affair with Joan, the wife of his best friend John Le Mesurier and also overlooks Hancock's film career post-The Punch and Judy Man, which included acclaimed supporting roles in Those Magnificent Men In Their Flying Machines and The Wrong Box. These are strange omissions; in the case of the latter, the crux of much of Humble's piece concerns Hancock's search for film success and thus international fame, so why not showcase these opportunities? Could it be that they didn't fit the tragic aspect that the play really wants to emphasise, resulting in the final word on his ambition being his firing from Disney's The Adventures of Bullwhip Griffin when his nerves seemed to have got the better of him. For the former, Hancock's final fling would later form the basis of another BBC biopic, Hancock and Joan, starring Ken Stott and Maxine Peake.\n\nWatching it now, Hancock feels overlong and repetitive but it does unarguably capture the inherent tragedy of the man. As a comedian, Hancock was forever obsessed with breaking new ground - the only problem was he was never sure what that new ground ought to be, and subsequently he was never satisfied. He strived for universal control over his career, but ridding himself of his regular co-stars, his writers, even his props, left him isolated and dissatisfied. In the lead role, Alfred Molina manages to not only capture Hancock's stage/screen persona mannerisms but he also crafts a truly sympathetic characterisation of a deeply complicated and unhappy man. I have an aversion to Frances Barber these days anyway, thanks to her offensive alcohol fuelled tweets, but feel she makes little impact as Freddie, though admittedly it's a role that offers little but to look concerned or cry. Likewise Mel Martin is ill served as Hancock's first wife Cicely, the play detailing their fractious marriage via scenes of domestic violence that are now, somewhat strangely, played for laughs. Malcolm Sinclair is sweetly effective as John Le Mesurier and I also love Jim Carter and Clive Russell as Galton and Simpson, they really look the part, though Carter can't really hide his distinctive, deep brown northern accent."
