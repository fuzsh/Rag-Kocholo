        "text": "On 7 Mar 1977, Publishers Weekly announced that production company Weist and Associates, Inc. acquired the screen rights to the novel The Manitou by Graham Masterton from Pinnacle Books.\n\nAlthough a 16 Mar 1977 news item in DV stated that Jules Brenner had been hired as director of photography, DV reversed its earlier announcement on 22 Mar 1977 and reported that while Brenner remained director William Girdler’s first choice, he had not officially been signed. Brenner does not appear in the film’s onscreen credits. On 23 Feb 1977, DV reported that Houston Intertronics Inc. was developing the picture’s special effects, but the company is not credited. In a 1 Jul 1977 news item, DV announced that KABC radio talk show host Carole Hemingway had been cast in a cameo role as a prostitute, but her name does not appear in onscreen credits.\n\nNews items in the 16 May 1977 DV and the 13 Jun 1977 Box announced that Avco Embassy Pictures purchased worldwide distribution rights for The Manitou. On 14 Mar 1977, a full-page advertisement in Box announced the movie was in preproduction. Early reports from HR on 2 Mar 1977 and DV on 23 Feb 1977 announced that The Manitou would begin principal photography in San Francisco, CA, on 18 Apr 1977. However, according to Box on 13 Jun 1977, the production started shooting in San Francisco on 16 May 1977, then moved to Los Angeles, CA, on 23 May 1977 to film for eight weeks. News items in HR on 19 Jul 1977 and in DV on 22 Jul 1977 stated that the film completed principal photography two days ahead of schedule and Avco Embassy planned a Jan 1978 release. A 7 Mar 1977 news item in HR reported that the film had a budget of $3 million.\n\nAs reported in the 6 Jan 1978 HR and the 11 Jan 1978 Var, the Code and Ratings board voted ten to five to change the movie’s R-rating to PG following an appeal by Avco Embassy that included a statement from Girdler. The initial R-rating was based on the board’s opinion that the subject matter would be too frightening for young children.\n\nOn 12 Jul 1978, a HR news item reported that Avco Embassy sold the film’s television rights to the Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS).\n\nNumerous reviews, such as those in the 28 Apr 1978 NYT, the 1 Mar 1978 Var and the 18 May 1978 LAT described The Manitou as an updated version of The Exorcist (1973, see entry), but opinions differed over the skill with which the homage was executed. While a positive review in the 6 Mar 1978 Box described The Manitou as an “engaging horror pic” that “[succeeded] in having a sense of humor about the whole affair,” a negative assessment in the 27 May-9 Jun 1978 Cue called the film “low-level horror mumbo-jumbo.” Other reviews were less emphatic. Critiques in the 18 May 1978 LAT and in HR on 24 Feb 1978 chided the film for being unintentionally funny and noted that “once an audience starts giggling at anything, it’s tough to stop them at supposedly intense moments.”\n\nOpening credits appear alongside images of Native American art. The following epilogue precedes the end credits: “Fact: Tokyo, Japan, 1969; A fifteen-year old boy developed what doctors thought was a tumor in his chest. The larger it grew, the more uncharacteristic it appeared. Eventually, it proved to be a human fetus.”\n\nLess\n\nAt a San Francisco, California, hospital, Dr. Bob McEvoy and tumor specialist Dr. Jack Hughes discuss an inexplicable, fast-growing swelling on the neck of McEvoy’s patient, Karen Tandy. The doctors schedule surgery to remove it but agree to keep quiet about the lump until they can explain it, since the tumor seems to have the characteristics of a growing human fetus. Elsewhere, fake psychic Harry Erskine gets a call from Karen, his ex-girlfriend, who asks to see him. When they meet, Karen tells Harry about the upcoming surgery for the growth on her neck and confides her belief that it is not just a tumor. At Harry’s home, he reads her tarot cards and the Death card keeps appearing. Harry and Karen make love and later, in the middle of the night, he hears her repeating a phrase in a foreign language in her sleep. The next morning, Harry asks Karen what she was saying but she does not know. Later, in the operating room, as Hughes prepares to make his first incision, Susan’s eyes open and she chants in a foreign language. A supernatural force compels the surgeon to cut his own wrist rather than the growth on Susan’s neck. Meanwhile, Harry ushers his next client, Mrs. Herz, into his apartment. The woman suddenly has a seizure and utters the same foreign words Karen said in her sleep. In a trance, she levitates out of the apartment and throws herself down the stairs. Later that day, Harry tells Hughes about his client’s strange behavior. He is worried that Karen’s life is in danger, but Hughes insists the mysterious words have no bearing on her medical condition. The surgeon admits he could not complete the surgery because Karen’s vital signs plummeted. He then explains that the swelling on her neck resembles a human fetus more than a tumor. Harry suspects something is trying to control Susan and is transmitting signals that are causing her condition. Later, Harry visits his mentor, Amelia Crusoe, at the occult shop she co-owns with her husband, “Mac” MacArthur. When Harry describes Karen’s condition, Amelia suggests they hold a séance. At the conclusion of the ritual, during which a ghostly head appears on the table, Amelia suggests they are dealing with an evil spirit that had knowledge of black magic when it was alive. Based on the figure they saw, Harry surmises it is the spirit of a Native American medicine man. Back at the occult shop, Harry, Amelia and Mac conduct research and learn there is a belief among Indians that a powerful medicine man’s immortal spirit, or Manitou, can be reborn by impregnating itself in a human host. When the three realize that Karen is about to give birth to such a being, they drive to Sausalito, California to consult an expert in Native American mythology, professor of anthropology Dr. Ernest Snow. Although Snow confirms the existence of reincarnated Manitou legends, he discounts the tales as folklore. Harry insists the myths must be real because Karen’s life is in danger. When Harry asks the professor if he recognizes Karen’s trance-like phrase, Snow identifies it as the language of a Northern California tribe that died out 400 years ago. Snow thinks the phrase means, “my death foretells my return.” The professor suggests that Harry travel to an Indian reservation in South Dakota to recruit a medicine man. Harry takes this news to Hughes, who alerts Harry that Karen is undergoing surgery at that moment. Since the scalpel failed before, the surgical team is trying to excise the growth with an optical laser. Just then, Hughes gets an urgent phone call and rushes down to the operating room with Harry where they learn that the laser whipped around on its own as the technicians attempted to make the first incision. Hughes and Harry see the laser incinerating objects in the operating room. The laser stops when Harry shuts off the power. Harry and Hughes cautiously enter the room and approach Karen. Speaking for the spirit growing on her, Karen intones that they must not touch him; the light has hurt him and he will kill them all. She screams and writhes until the hospital staff sedates her. Hughes conjectures that the spirit of the medicine man is afraid of the laser and X-rays. Later, Harry drives to a South Dakota Indian reservation and locates a medicine man named John Singing Rock. John informs Harry that the Manitou in question is gaining the strength of a Christ-like spirit called Gitche Manitou, the most powerful figure in the Indian belief system. Humans cannot defeat the Manitou, they can only send it back to the place from which it came. To banish the spirit without killing Karen, they will need to invoke the power of other spirits, such as the mountains or the wind. John agrees to help Harry for a $100,000 donation to the Indian Educational Foundation. In Karen’s hospital room, John draws a circle on the floor around Karen’s bed and cautions Harry and Hughes not to break or smudge the circle, since it is the only barrier that might contain the Manitou. As John begins his ritual, Karen awakens and speaks in the spirit’s voice, which calls itself Misquamacus and declares that it is stronger than John’s magic. Misquamacus warns John that if he helps the white men he will die. John explains that Misquamacus, the strongest medicine man of all, wants revenge. That night, Harry and John observe Misquamacus emerge from Karen’s back, then drop to the floor. As Misquamacus tries to break the circle, John calls on other spirits. Hughes wants to call the police, but John warns that Misquamacus can control the Manitous of manmade objects; if the police come, Misquamacus will turn the guns on the police just as the spirit turned the scalpel on Hughes. Later, Misquamacus breaks the circle and summons a lizard demon that bites Hughes on the hand. Harry takes Hughes to another floor for medical attention, then returns to Karen’s room where he discovers that Misquamacus has disappeared with Karen. John suspects the Manitou is opening a portal for a greater demon to enter the human world. Misquamacus reappears and tries to kill Harry and John, but Harry throws a typewriter at the spirit. Misquamacus destroys it, but John and Harry escape. John has beseeched every Manitou for help but none have been able to stop Misquamacus. Harry tells John it is time to call on Gitche Manitou. Just then, an earthquake erupts. When it settles, John explains that Misquamacus has summoned the Great Old One, an evil spirit akin to Satan, to help defeat the humans. Looking at the computer equipment, Harry suggests that John direct the energy of the hospital’s machines’ Manitous at Misquamacus. As he and Harry return to Karen’s room, John warns that the Great Old One is a master of illusion. Karen seems to float in outer space. John calls on the Manitous of the machines to send Misquamacus away and the building’s machines whirr to life, but since they were created by white men, they don’t respond to John. However, Harry’s love for Karen causes the Manitous to focus their power through her. Karen rises from the bed and emits bolts of energy from her fingertips that blast through Misquamacus. In retaliation, the Great Old One sends fireballs toward the humans, but with the aid of the machines, Karen destroys the demon. Once the room returns to normal, Harry and Karen embrace. The next day, John reminds Harry that Misquamacus’s body is dead, but the spirit lives on.\n\nLess"
