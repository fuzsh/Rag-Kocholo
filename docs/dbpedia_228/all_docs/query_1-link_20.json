        "text": "Friday, 2 December, 2005, 3:42 am\n\nFiled under: Reviews\n\nFilm review by Shuvra Mahmud.\n\nTim Roth’s 1999 debut film ‘The War Zone’ has what one reviewer said “nothing to do with traditional battlefields”, yet an subtle over-tone of inescapable helplessness permeates throughout this story of a family of five.\n\nTo think about the cruelty of an enemy is easier, perhaps than to see the cruelty of family.\n\nRoth explores through excellently crafted characters, dialogue and cinematography a subject as horrifying as incest. Incest occurs in families of every description and from accross all socio-econoimic groupings. It is a prevailent crime whose statistics are misrepresented by the silence of the victims.\n\nTom (Freddie Cunliffe), a 15-year old boy – uncommunicative, pale and spotty- who is “brooding over his family’s relocation from London to an isolated rural hamlet” in Devon, says a short piece in Tim Roth’s website. He unwittingly discovers a unsettling truth about his striking 18-year old sister Jessie (Lara Belmont) and his father, played by Ray Winstone. The hamlet is by the cliffs with old war forts and old battlefields scattered around its edges, all desolate and barren. He sets out to investigate and thr truths he uncovers and their consequences on each member of the family form the core drama of this film.\n\nJessie is the strongest character presented. Belmont does an extraordinary job. Her actions (guilt that is akin to “sexual guilt” results in self-abuse, mistrust and hatred) and dialogue represents a desperate cry for help that can only come from a character who has seemingly experienced years of sexual abuse. From Belmont’s portrayal of Jessie’s pain during the rape scene to her heart-breaking and disconsolate cries at the kitchen table, her acting is exceptionally skilled.\n\nThe interplay between brother and sister is tense but brilliant. Tom, only starting to engage the world at 15-years is jolted into the role of protector. Though he blames both his father and sister, his presence seems to comfort Jessie. However, I suspect that it is through Tom’s courage that she finds strength.\n\nScenes are shot in long takes with a motionless camera. A scene in particular leaves no secrets between the relationship between father and daughter. Much more emotionally violent than physically, the scene in not gratuitous but unsettling and simply daunting. At a public screening during the 1999 Toronto Film Festival, a member of the audience was so upset that in the midst of a crucial scene he got up and shouted that he “couldn’t take any more”. He then proceeded towards the exit, intent on pulling the fire alarm, but not before Roth intercepted him and engaged in a 20-minute conversation to calm the gentleman down.\n\n‘The War Zone’ is one of those films which stun the audience into a thoughtful silence, so that they sit motionless minutes after the film has ended. In its frankness, withouth euphamisms, it hides nothing from the audience of the brutality of incestuous intercourse. A reviewer says “no matter how many critics trumpet [the merits of] ‘The War Zone’…viewers will not flock to see it, the subject matter is too upsetting and daunting”. This reviewer has not seen a film of this calibre or impact since Darren Aronofsky’s ‘Requiem for a Dream’ (2000). Roth has marked his directorial career with other films since, but as a directoral debut, ‘The War Zone’ stands out as an ambitious, competent success.\n\nRay Winstone and Tilda Swinton play the father and mother. Winstone, a veteran British actor, played a similar role in Gary Oldman’s ‘Nil By Mouth’. His character is a loving father, whose dark nature only comes out in the rape scene, but even then he is not what one might typically think of when considering an abuser. Swinton is brilliant, though her character is seemingly oblivious to the relationship between her husband and daughter, she effortlessly portrays a mother with a strong sense of family.\n\nSome critics have called the film “repetitive, unpleasant, sensationalistic”, yet it seems to this reviewer that no other film has dared to give such a focus to child abuse in many years prior to its release. Therefore, as a film that highlights the issues surrounding the subject matter, and indeed the subject matter itself, ‘The War Zone’ is excellent in its delivery.\n\nHowever, as an art-house movie, it fails to portray anything about the director, which fans to dearly expect from the genre. The end is shocking, though expected and thus a little disappointing. In particular, Swinton’s character is without adequate depth and fails to instigate any empathy from the audience. Indeed, Tom’s own awakening to sex is marginalised and seems only a filler to the main plot.\n\nThe film is a departure from the 1989 novel of the same name by author Alexander Stuart. In particular, Jessie’s unusually active role in the relationship between her father and herself is not adequately explained in the film, whereas in the book it derives from her desire to have her own baby and to compete against her mother’s recent birth of her baby sister, Alice.\n\nHowever, as metioned above, the focus is adequate to bring to attention the horrifying crime that occurs somewhere all around the world.\n\nDirected by: Tim Roth.\n\nWritten by: Alexander Stuart, adapted from his novel.\n\nStarring: Freddie Cunliffe, Lara Belmont, Ray Winstone, Tilda Swinton.\n\nSome useful website:\n\nBBC Support website – there are some great, useful links from this site.\n\nResearch: 2 December 2005.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nRelated\n\nLeave a Comment so far\n\nLeave a comment"
