        "text": "SPORTING several days' stubble, a forearm tattoo and camouflage fatigues, Tim Roth sits at a table in a sleek SoHo hotel looking oddly battle-ready. ''I'm prepared for anything,'' he says after a sip of bottled water. ''I'm bulletproof.''\n\nActually, he's an actor preparing for the opening, on Dec. 10, of his directorial debut, ''The War Zone.'' And he has reason to be wary. Based on the British writer Alexander Stuart's novel about a family destroyed by incest, the film is an unflinching adaptation of a disturbing story that has already provoked sharply divided reactions.\n\nWhen the novel was published, in 1989, it was variously praised by reviewers as ''savagely seductive,'' ''sharp'' and ''sensuous.'' But it had its detractors. After being awarded Britain's Whitbread Prize that year, it was stripped of the honor when one of the judges objected to the book's treatment of incest. The judge called the novel ''repellent'' and its author ''disturbed,'' Mr. Stuart says. So it was no surprise that when the film opened in Britain in September, a few critics there were similarly outraged. ''There were some people who said it should not be made,'' Mr. Roth says. ''And they're absolutely welcome to their opinion.''\n\nLike the book, the film centers on a family of four, the simply named Dad (Ray Winstone), Mum (Tilda Swinton) and their children Jessie (Lara Belmont) and Tom (Freddie Cunliffe), the last two actors newcomers. As the story begins, they have just moved from London to a bleakly beautiful seaside town in Devon, in the southwest of England. Against a blustery backdrop of crashing winter waves and craggy cliffs, the family lives a laconic life of solemn adjustment. Tom, apparently an ordinary adolescent upset about the move, is withdrawn, sulky and watchful. Returning home late one afternoon, he spies his sister in the bathroom with Dad engaged in something seemingly sexual. Jessie, confronted by Tom, at first denies it, but the ever-vigilant brother soon uncovers more evidence until he (and the audience) witnesses his father savagely sodomizing his sister in a bunker, a remnant of wartime Europe.\n\nCulminating in unresolved violence reminiscent of Greek tragedy, the film recalls the European art-house style of Andrei Tarkovsky and Ingmar Bergman with its lingering camera shots and unnerving stillness. Mr. Roth acknowledges the influence of both auteurs, as well as his early experience as a painter, in his approach to ''The War Zone.'' ''It gives the audience a chance to reflect on what they are seeing,'' he says of such deliberative techniques. ''Although I did have film references, I thought more about painting when I was doing 'The War Zone.' It's a wonderful exercise in silence.''\n\nThough eager to direct for some time, Mr. Roth says, he held off because he couldn't find the right project. ''Directing takes a good three years,'' he explains. ''I didn't want to be away from acting that long. I was worried they wouldn't want me back.'' Enter the producer Sarah Radclyffe (''My Beautiful Laundrette,'' ''Caravaggio''), who met Mr. Roth when they were working on Chris Menges's film ''A World Apart'' in 1987. Having heard that Mr. Roth was looking for something to cut his directorial teeth on, she gave him Mr. Stuart's book in 1996 and urged him to consider it. He read it and immediately decided to make the leap.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
