        "text": "Saturday November 26\n\nSherlock Holmes And The Voice Of Terror\n\n(John Rawlins, 1942)\n\n2.10pm, BBC2\n\nFirst of Universal's long-running Basil Rathbone/Nigel Bruce series as the Baker Street sleuth and his bumbling sidekick. It's far from the best: the dodgy plot shifts Holmes and Watson from their Victorian origins to match wits against Nazi agents in the second world war.\n\nKidnapped\n\n(Robert Stevenson, 1960)\n\n4.25pm, Five\n\nNot the one with Michael Caine rigged out as a highlander; this is the stodgy Disney effort that stays too earnestly true to Robert Louis Stevenson's classic. Still, Peter Finch cuts a dash as the hero helping orphan James MacArthur escape slavery. Shot handsomely on location in Scotland.\n\nRoad To Perdition\n\n(Sam Mendes, 2002)\n\n9.10pm, C4\n\nSam Mendes' second movie, after American Beauty, is a son-of-the-mob rites of passage drama in the Billy Bathgate vein. Tom Hanks, playing very effectively against type, is chief enforcer of Paul Newman's mob in depression-era Chicago; but when his own family becomes the target, he has to turn against his boss and surrogate father. Among all the power-playing, Jude Law's weaselly photographer-cum-killer stands out, but it's Conrad L Hall's richly sombre photography and Thomas Newman's grand score that give this gangster flick, culled from Max Allan Collins' graphic novel, a near-tragic gravitas.\n\nThe Big Boss\n\n(Lo Wei, 1972)\n\n11.05pm, Five\n\nBruce Lee first big feature, in which he kung fu kicks his way to international fame. He's a gentle young fellow seeking work in a Bangkok ice factory, which he discovers is merely a front for big boss Han-Yin Chieh's skulduggery (drug smuggling, prostitution, bumping off members of Lee's extended family). The trick is that Lee has promised Ma he won't fight, so spends part of the movie in a pent-up fury. And then... Like his other, all too few films, the plot is risible, but Lee's charismatic screen persona allied to a lethal balletic grace make him a mesmerising screen presence.\n\nSuperfly\n\n(Gordon Parks Jr, 1972)\n\n12.25am, BBC2\n\nThis ranks right up there with Shaft and Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song as a classic of the blaxploitation genre. Hip martial arts expert Ron O'Neal stars as Harlem drug dealer Youngblood Priest, who is planning one last big score. Chock full of sex, coke and kung fu kicks, all set to a terrific Curtis Mayfield soundtrack.\n\nSunday November 27\n\nKundun\n\n(Martin Scorsese, 1997)\n\n3.15pm, Five\n\nScorsese forsakes the mean streets, to undertake an extraordinary metaphysical journey in this story of the early life of the 14th Dalai Lama. We see Kundun (\"Ocean of Wisdom\") discovered by the priests and trained in scenes of warmth and humour, before the Chinese invasion of Tibet brings bloodshed and, finally, Kundun's exile to India. There's nothing like the narrative drive of Scorsese's American tales; this is told in images of transcendent power.\n\nJackie Chan's Who Am I?\n\n(Bennie Chan and Jackie Chan, 1998)\n\n6.50pm, Five\n\nA minor adventure from the master of martial arts comedy, but it's hard to beat for sheer Chan chutzpah. The creaky plot has Chan's crack commando Whoami pursued by killers; he doesn't know why, because he's suffering from amnesia. It doesn't matter. Scenes such as the clog stall fight and the rooftop battle - with Chan's incredible descent of the high-rise block - are staggering examples of his breathless art.\n\nEnter The Dragon\n\n(Robert Clouse, 1973)\n\n10pm, Five\n\nThe best of martial arts star Bruce Lee's brief, brilliant career. He's an agent infiltrating opium smuggler Han's island fortress by competing in an international fistfight-fest there, Han's ugly henchman (Bob Wall) having caused the death of Lee's sister. The cast mainly acts with its knuckles, and a little Jackie Chan humour wouldn't have gone amiss; the action, however, is brilliantly staged.\n\nWise Blood\n\n(John Huston, 1979)\n\n12.15am, BBC2\n\nThe haunted-child face of Brad Dourif sets an awkward, disquieting tone to Huston's tragi-comedy of religious manners, adapted from Flannery O'Connor's novel. Dourif plays a disturbed army veteran who returns to his bible- thumping Deep South hometown and becomes a preacher, although atheist. His Church Of Truth Without Jesus Christ is only his first, dispiriting protest against neon-lit fundamentalism. Ned Beatty, Harry Dean Stanton are among the excellent cast.\n\nElectra Glide In Blue\n\n(James William Guercio, 1973)\n\n2am, ITV1\n\nViolent but intelligent story of an Arizona motorcycle cop (Robert Blake) who stands not very tall but whose sharp wits show up the dim detectives. Stylishly made, with the camera lingering on the cops' macho hardware - gun, boots, Harley-Davidson; and bidding successfully for cult road movie status with its final nod to Easy Rider.\n\nMonday November 28\n\nThe First Of The Few\n\n(Leslie Howard, 1942)\n\n1.20pm, C4\n\nThe last starring role for director Leslie Howard, who had spurned Hollywood to make morale-boosting movies in wartime England: the following year his plane was shot down while he was travelling from London to Lisbon on a mysterious mission. This is a detailed and fascinating account of how designer RJ Mitchell put together the Spitfire fighter plane with which the Battle of Britain was won.\n\nDay Of The Evil Gun\n\n(Jeremy Thorpe, 1968)\n\n1.30pm, BBC2\n\nA gritty western riding in the hoofprints of The Searchers. Glenn Ford's weary gunfighter returns home after years away to find Apaches have ridden off with his wife and children. Neighbouring farmer Arthur Kennedy joins him in the search and overtakes him in the killing of Indians. Kennedy's growing relish for the slaughter, the torture, a nasty fight with renegade Confederates in a ghost town. It all adds up to a disturbing journey.\n\nLove Story\n\n(Arthur Hiller, 1970)\n\n11.35pm, BBC1\n\nThis mystifyingly successful weepie stars Ryan O'Neal as Preppy, a rich college kid whose dad Ray Milland is miffed when he falls for poor girl Ali MacGraw; true love overcomes all, and just as happiness beckons she cops Hollywood Disease - the one where you get more pale and beautiful, until you die. Frances Lai won an Oscar for the song.\n\nBeautiful People\n\n(Jasmin Dizdar, 1999)\n\n12midnight, C4\n\nThe directorial debut of the Bosnian Dizdar, who also wrote this lively account of curious connections between expat Bosnians and London locals. Cleverly interweaving various strands - a British football hooligan transported to the former Yugoslavia; a Tory MP's daughter and her affair with a war criminal - the style is exuberant, episodic, and very much in the style of Kusturica.\n\nTuesday November 29\n\nThe Pillow Book\n\n(Peter Greenaway, 1995)\n\n12.05am, C4\n\nEven by Greenaway's standards, an outlandish conceit. It's the story of Nagito (Vivian Wu), a woman who, thanks to the birthday rituals of her Japanese calligrapher father, has grown up with a fetish about body art: her lovers leave inscriptions on her body. Until Ewan McGregor's Jerome turns up, and invites her to make an illustrated man of him. Interweaving cool zen with the jealous rage of Empire Of The Senses, it is an enigmatic but seductive experience.\n\nWednesday November 30\n\nAlfie\n\n(Lewis Gilbert, 1966)\n\n11.40pm, BBC1\n\nThe nitty-gritty of Michael Caine's early career: his flash cockney lover-boy epitomised swinging London, and provided a blackly comic counterpoint to his maverick agent Harry Palmer. It's a bleak and barbed tale, adapted by Bill Naughton from his play, and given a memorable theme song. Among the unfortunate women in Alfie's life are Vivien Merchant, Shelley Winters, Julia Foster and Millicent Martin.\n\nFear And Loathing In Las Vegas\n\n(Terry Gilliam, 1998)\n\n12.10am, C4\n\nHunter S Thompson's drug-fuelled quest in a crimson convertible for the American Dream was labelled the novel that could never be filmed, but this is a defiantly faithful adaptation. Gilliam, creator of fantasies from Jabberwocky to Twelve Monkeys, conjures astounding pharmaceutical hallucinations; and although the serial trashing of hotels rooms, the awesome soundtrack and Johnny Depp's jaded voiceover at times combine to numbing effect, there are exceptional performances from Depp as the Thompson alter ego Raoul Duke, and Benicio Del Toro as his pal, Dr Gonzo.\n\nThe Man Who Knew Too Much\n\n(Alfred Hitchcock, 1956)\n\n2.25am, ITV1\n\nHitchcock's glossy Technicolor remake of his own 1934 black-and-white British thriller. James Stewart and Doris Day are doctor and wife holidaying in Morocco and having to sharpen up their act when their son is kidnapped. Many prefer the leaner, fun-filled original, but this grips too - and has Day singing Que Sera, Sera for a bonus.\n\nThursday December 1\n\nThe Paleface\n\n(Norman Z McLeod, 1948)\n\n1pm, BBC2\n\nOne of wisecracking Bob Hope's funniest films, in which he plays correspondence-school dentist \"Painless\" Potter who stumbles into heaps of trouble in the wild west. Luckily he has rootin' tootin' tough gal Jane Russell, as Calamity Jane, by his side: she's a government agent who marries Potter as cover while she tracks down a gang of gun runners. Directed by McLeod, who made his name directing Marx brothers comedies, and with a consistently funny script, it prompted an even better sequel, Son Of Paleface.\n\nThe War Zone\n\n(Tim Roth, 1998)\n\n12.25am, C4\n\nRoth's impressive directorial debut is an intelligent and moving study of incest. Adapted by Alexander Stuart from his novel, it stars Freddie Cunliffe as a teenager who suspects that his father (Ray Winstone) is abusing his sister (Lara Belmont). The performances are excellent, with Winstone exhibiting a very different - but equally damaging - anger to that in the bruising Nil By Mouth. Beautifully photographed, too, amid cold, brooding Devon landscapes, by Seamus McGarvey.\n\nFriday December 2\n\nWyatt Earp\n\n(Lawrence Kasdan, 1994)\n\n9pm, Five\n\nA stately account of the great lawman, here played to earnest effect by Kevin Costner, (who already had three hours of Dances With Wolves under his gunbelt). But there are advantages to taking time over the story: this is detailed with the rich texture of history in the making, and it makes a hell of a battle out of the gunfight at the OK Corral. Among the starry cast are Gene Hackman as big daddy Earp, and best of all, Dennis Quaid as tubercular Doc Holliday.\n\nThe River Wild\n\n(Curtis Hanson, 1994)\n\n11.35pm, BBC1\n\nA family on the point of breaking up goes whitewater rafting in the wilds and is threatened by killers - this is Kramer Versus Kramer meets Deliverance, with Meryl Streep. She's rarely looked so healthy, running the rapids and dealing with husband David Strathairn, son Joseph Mazello, and the crooks: a charming Kevin Bacon and creepy henchman John C Reilly. Handsome Montana scenery, and Hanson, director of LA Confidential, keeps the breakneck action rushing along."
