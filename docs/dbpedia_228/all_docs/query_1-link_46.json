        "text": "Reviewed by Jodie Crawford\n\nOpening Night verdict ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️\n\n101 Dalmatians – The Musical, is a new-ish musical, based on the stage adaptation of the original novel. Now, I’ve not read the book and I’m ashamed to say I haven’t seen the modern film adaptation. But, I have seen the 1961 animated film (in fact we watched it last week in preparation). While the plot is loosely similar, it’s actually adapted in a way that makes much more sense on stage!\n\nThe show begins as we meet a filthy, abandoned wild dog who is dropped off at the Puppy Love Dogs home, here he is cleaned up and welcomed to the fold. This is where we first hear the main number of the show “Take Me Home” (which we all went home singing at the end of the night) as we see some dogs matched to new owners, but not our friend, the newly named Pongo. Pongo is overlooked, but he clearly has a connection with one special worker at the dogs home, Danielle (Jessie Elland). Eventually, Danielle agrees to take him home and before long they meet another Dalmatian , Perdi (Emma Thornett) and Perdi’s owner/human Tom (Samuel Thomas). It’s love at first sight and soon the four are set up together at home, as a family.\n\nSoon Perdi falls pregnant with puppies and we meet the one name that sends shivers down the spines or any Disney fan: Cruella De Vil (Kym Marsh). Cruella wants the puppies- to- be to be hers so that she can make a fine outfit of them, designed by our very own, wannabe designer, Tom. The young couple don’t have much to their names and the offer of money temporarily tempts them, but when the fifteen puppies arrive there is no way that they want to let them go. And here the adventure begins as the game of cat and mouse commences. Who will be triumphant? Will the puppies survive or will they be on the catwalk at fashion week?\n\nThis production is great fun. I was concerned it would be a bit much for my 5 year old with all the talk of skinning Dalmatians, but she loved it. There’s something for everyone. It’s a wonderfully joyful family show, and what a great time for it to be here in Manchester during the school holidays. I expect the theatre will be full every night.\n\nThe whole production is very clever, the puppetry is just stunning. Linford Johnson as Pongo was captivating for me. He and the puppet somehow act as one and it’s mesmerising. All of the puppeteers give a stellar performance, with some of the finest vocals I’ve ever heard from an ensemble. The colour matching outfits of the ensemble, the hairstyles and small attention to detail is really captivating.\n\nIt was obvious that much of the crowd were there for Kym Marsh, as Cruella, and she didn’t disappoint. The crowd were showering her in applause before she even let out one note, and that must be terrifying, having so much expectation on you, but she delivered over and over again. And the audience just loved her, quite rightly so.\n\nThere is much to laugh at in this production, and Jasper (Danny Hendrix) and Casper (Charles Brunton) give us much of the humour. They’re slapstick, it’s not subtle, but it works and they were just brilliant.\n\nSamuel Thomas and Jessie Elland are a perfectly suited duo in their roles of Danielle and Tom. Two very sweet characters, who made us love them as much as they loved each other.\n\nWhile at times it can feel a bit Panto, (which I’m a huge fan of by the way), it works. It’s a family show, that is a bit silly, and possibly about 20 minutes longer than it needs to be, but it’s just wonderful in so many lovely ways.\n\nA well deserved standing ovation for a wonderful cast, accompanied by an incredible band (led by Leigh Stanford Thompson), and produced with a clever use of puppetry. Manchester is going to love this show this summer!\n\n101 Dalmatians is on at Manchester’s Palace Theatre until Saturday 10th August tickets available here.\n\nReviewed by Matt Forrest\n\nOpening Night verdict ⭐⭐⭐⭐\n\nBased on the 1988 cult classic by John Waters, which featured Rikki Lake and Debbie Harry, Hairspray transports us to 1960’s Baltimore focusing on the Turnblad family, who are the living embodiment of the American dream: a happy family, with both parents running and owning their own business, and a child who dreams she can be anything she wants.\n\nIn 2002 writers Mark O’Dohnell and Thomas Meehan took to adapting Hairspray for Broadway, which led to a West End run, several UK tours and even a glitzy Hollywood remake starring John Travolta and Queen Latifah.\n\nRight from the opening number, Good Morning Baltimore, we are treated to a snapshot of what life is like across America in 1962, with racial inequality sadly rife. Our guide on this journey is high school misfit Tracy Turnblad (Alexandra Emmerson-Kirby) constantly at odds with the school authorities due to her massive hairdo!\n\nTracy has dreams of being a TV star, with her only insight into this world coming in the form of popular teen magazine show, “The Corny Collins Show”, a music and dance show catering for the tennagers of Balitmore, evening boasting of “Negro Day”.\n\nSoon fate intervenes for Tracy, after befriending Seaweed (Reece Richards), a black dancer on the show, who teaches Tracy some killer dance moves which help her to land a part of her favourite show. Here she meets her crush, teen heartthrob, Link Larkin (Solomon Davy). Tracy becomes an instant hit with the audience, however not everyone is pleased about the new TV sensation with, the show’s bitchy producer, Velma Von Tussle (Gina Murray), and her dim daughter Amber Von Tussle (Allana Taylor), doing everything in their power to halt Tracy’s meteoric rise in popularity.\n\nThere is so much to admire about this production, from its messages about body positivity and its strong core themes of tackling prejudice and bigotry head on. Packed full of catchy tunes including the delightful Mama, I’m a Big Girl Now, and the huge, joyous finale You Can’t Stop the Beat.\n\nThe production is littered with great performances, with newcomer Alexandra Emmerson-Kirby giving a star making debut as Tracy. Equally impressive is Freya McMahon as Tracy’s best friend Penny Pingleton, again on debut, with both showcasing superb comic timing and great vocals.\n\nGina Murray is deliciously devious as the vile Velma Von Tussle, played with no redeeming qualities whatsoever, yet still a captivating watch. Whilst Allana Taylor, as daughter Amber, equally as hideous as her mother, who’s little comic touches are a treat to watch.\n\nReece Richards, gets to showcase some excellent dance moves throughout, spearheading Drew Mconie’s excellent choreography. The choreography throughout is bang on point, all the more impressive from the huge ensemble cast. Full of energy and vibrancy it really is the heartbeat of the show.\n\nFor me the show’s standout moment was the comedic yet beautifully touching duet between Tracy’s parents Edna (Neil Hurst) and Wilbur (Dermot Canavan) on the song, You’re Timeless to Me. The pair have great chemistry with one another, occasionally breaking into the odd unscripted aside, making it all the more special.\n\nMy only wish was that more thought was given to the staging and set. The costumes all look fabulous, but their staging and set design are somewhat lacking and don’t represent the high production values the rest of the production has.\n\nTackling weighty issues, such as equality and acceptance, whilst shining a light on the struggle of the Civil Rights Movement and the importance of plus sized role models appearing in the mainstream media, Hairspray is a constant joy from start to finish, and a great reminder that theatre can tackle and address some of the biggest challenges we face, but also have a lot of fun at the same time!\n\nHairspray is on at Manchester’s Palace Theatre till 27th July tickets are available here.\n\nReviewed by Jodie Crawford\n\nOpening Night verdict ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️\n\nThere really isn’t anything more Disney than this incredible production of Aladdin. It has all the key ingredients of a magical Disney tale, with bells on, and maybe just a little bit of glitter thrown in!\n\nThis stage adaption has a plot true to the original Disney film. With our main characters: Aladdin (Gavin Adams) The Genie (Yeukayi Ushe), Jafar (Adam Strong), Jasmine (Desmonda Cathabel) , Sultan (Jo Servi) and the hilarious Iago (Angelo Paragosa) coming together to tell us the tale of poor street urchin Aladdin being tricked by Jafar, meeting a Genie and falling in love – with a few magnificent musical numbers, many jazz hands, beautifully choreographed ensemble pieces, sword fights, magical carpets and big belly laughs (even the wicked ones).\n\nThis production is mesmerising, it’s like nothing I’ve seen before. You are taken to a whole new world (couldn’t help it – sorry) where you can forget all your worries and just be transported to the land of Agrabah and enjoy the ride – specifically the carpet ride.\n\nAct one introduces us to the lives of our characters and we are treated to some wonderful musical numbers – including favourites from the original movie like Arabian nights .\n\nThe show stopper of Act 1 is, without doubt, Yeukayi Ushe (Genie) performance of Friend Like Me I don’t want to spoil it for anyone, but this number is a feast for the soul: glamour, costumes, dancing, the set design, and more enthusiasm than I have ever seen on stage. Yeukayi Ushe, take a bow Sir – you are incredible. Hands down the star of this show for me!\n\nAct 2 treats us to more ensemble magic with Prince Ali and everyone’s favourite A Whole New World – the melody, the lyrics, the carpet. I found myself sitting with a great big, wide smile plastered on my face – there is something so comforting about hearing a song that you loved as a child brought to life on stage.\n\nThis production is colourful in every way, the set changes are phenomenal – I will never understand how they can store so many set structures backstage for this show. The use of technology was clever in the small touches on the back drops in several different scenes. Everything is so carefully constructed by the set design team, there is so much attention to detail everywhere from the props to the costumes. If there is stronger word for “vibrant” I would use it – but vibrant is what it is, from start to finish. Everything comes together so perfectly and much of that is thanks to the fabulous ensemble, and the choreography. Both are flawless.\n\nI have to say that I feel the real love story in this tale is not that of Jasmine and Aladdin, but of Aladdin and the Genie. Their friendship is a rollercoaster ride and in the end their bond is stronger than they could ever have imagined and quite frankly, it was beautiful to watch.\n\nSpecial mention has to go to the orchestra led by the talented Dave Rose – every single note spot on and seamlessly woven into the plot.\n\nI took my seven year old to see this and I will never forget the smile on her face, the squeals of delight and the awe in her eyes. As we left the auditorium she whispered to me “This has just been the most magical night, I won’t forget it, ever” and yes I did have to wipe a little tear away. So thank you cast, crew, orchestra, costume, production team, and everyone else involved – including the wonderful lady from front of house who was so very kind and sang to us all so beautifully during the interval, while selling ice creams- you all made my little girls dreams comes true. Her last words before she fell asleep to me were “It’s just like when we went to Disney- can we go again tomorrow”. Well no, we can’t – but if you’re quick, you might be able to snap up a ticket before it completely sells out – you’ll regret it if you don’t – trust me!\n\nAladdin is on at Manchester’s Palace Theatre until Sunday 7th July tickets available here.\n\nReviewed by Matt Forrest\n\nOpening Night verdict ⭐⭐⭐1/2\n\nFollowing the Wall Street crash of 1929, the USA was hit by the great depression, money was scarce, unemployment was rife. As a result of these tough times America saw an increase of violent crime and armed robbery, notorious criminals such as John Dillinger, The Ma Barker Gang and arguably the most infamous of them all Bonnie Parker and Clyde Barrow. Dillinger, Ma Barker and Bonnie and Clyde have all had Hollywood films made about them, however it’s only that later has a musical about them.\n\nDirect from the West End Bonnie & Clyde, arrive in Manchester as part of a full UK tour. With the involvement of Oscar winning lyricist Don Black and Grammy,Tony and Emmy nominated composer Frank Wildhorn, expectations for this one are obviously high.\n\nSet in and the ‘Dust Bowl’ of America, the production opens with Bonnie and Clyde, dead in their car, taken down in a hailstorm of bullets, but how did these 20-somethings end up in this situation?\n\nWe are introduced to the violent pair as Bonnie (Katie Tonkinson) dreams about being a big movie star like her idol Clara Bow, whilst Clyde (Alex James Hatton) wants to go down in history like his hero, Billy the Kid. A chance meeting between the pair, sees them become fascinated with each other, he a fugitive from the law, a career criminal, intent on making a life following his family’s eviction from their farm. She, an aspiring actress, singer and poet determined to quit her waitress job and find excitement, adventure and the American dream.\n\nClyde, and his brother Buck (Sam Ferriday) have broken out of prison, and whilst Clyde continues robbing grocery stores and continues his relationship with Bonnie, his brother Buck is persuaded to turn himself in by his wife, Blanche (Catherine Tydesley) a devout, god-fearing Christian women, determined to carve out a good, honest life for her and her husband.\n\nHowever, eventually the law catches up with Clyde, who is sent back to prison. Finding life on the inside is tough going, especially without his brother. He and Bonnie hatch a plot to spring him from jail, and so begins the pair’s infamous crime spree of bank robberies and murder.\n\nWhilst not perfect there is a great deal to admire about the show. The music is a mix of late 1920’s early 30’s illicit speak-easy tunes infused with elements of gospel rock. There are several stand out musical numbers including the narrative setting Picture Show, the powerful huge ensemble number, Made In America and the heart-breaking Bonnie/Blanche duet You Love Who You Love.\n\nThe cast are exceptional and certainly the highlight of the production. Alex James Hatton is in fine form, playing Clyde with a hefty dose of charisma and charm, aided by the fact he has a tremendous singing voice. Katie Tonkinson is in superb as Bonnie, her portrayal is one of determination and borderline fanatical belief that she is destined to be a star. The chemistry between the two leads is there for all to see, making the pair a captivating watch. Tonkinson’s powerful duet with Catherine Tydesley on the aforementioned You Love Who You Love is the highlight of the show.\n\nCatherine Tydesley displays not just her fine vocal range, as well as measured, at times comedic turn as the increasingly desperate Blanche. Whilst Sam Ferriday is sympathetic is the dim-witted yet loyal Buck, torn between doing the best by his wife and his brother. The foursome are supported by a hardworking and impressive ensemble that include Daniel Reid-Walters as the well-meaning Deputy Sheriff, Ted Hinton determined to save Bonnie from her bloody fate.\n\nAt times I do think the pace and tone of the show is somewhat hit and miss. Once the characters are established it takes a while for the plot to really start moving along. The production is desperate for you to love the central protagonists, attempting to make the pair Robin Hood like characters, at times glossing over just how evil the pair really were. Whilst some of the comedic elements to the production work at times, on other occasions it does feel out of place.\n\nOverall, this is an enjoyable night at the theatre, a tremendous hard-working cast with some great tunes and exceptional performances. Whilst the story doesn’t always hit its mark, the cast certainly go out with all gun’s blazing!\n\nBonnie and Clyde is on at Manchester’s Palace Theatre until Saturday 11th May. Tickets available here.\n\nReviewed by Nikki Cotter\n\nOpening Night verdict ⭐⭐⭐⭐\n\nThe Wizard of Oz is as classic a tale as they come, invoking warm fuzzy memories quicker than you can say ruby slippers, this bold, bright reimagining however shakes things up, bringing it bang up to date with its terrific technicolour and futuristic feel.\n\nAdapted by Andrew Lloyd Webber and Jeremy Sams this new revival directed by Nikolai Foster retains many of the much-loved classic’s elements while updating it for modern audiences. The result is a full-on, fast-paced feast of colour. The black and white of Kansas is gone, while Oz is presented as a neon dream with the Emerald City projected in vivid technicolour as an impressive backdrop which envelopes the simple staging.\n\nStepping into the ruby slippers is Aviva Tulley, with pitch perfect vocals she leads the cast as Dorothy with genuine warmth and huge charisma.

Aston Merrygold’s Tin Man is enormously endearing and takes full advantage of the opportunity to showcase his impressive dance skills, while Manchester favourite Jason Manford is hilarious as the Cowardly Lion. He has the audience in his paws from the very first roarsome growl. The trio make a perfect team bringing a whole heap of fun to the production as they join Dorothy in her quest to get home. We also mustn’t forget Toto, who is brought to brilliant life by puppeteer Abigail Matthews.\n\nThe Wizard of Oz wouldn’t be complete of course without the witches, as good witch Glinda, Emily Bull is a joy, her crisp vocals are delivered with an effortless ease as she whizzes round the stage on her perfect pink scooter. The Vivienne takes on the iconic role of Wicked Witch of The West and brings just the right amount of villainy to the piece. She pitches her wickedness perfectly ensuring a sense of menace and mischief without traumatising any children in the audience. Her impressive solo, Red Shoes Blues gives the opportunity to really show her talent and versatility as a performer.\n\nVisually this show really dazzles, Rachael Canning’s costumes are incredible while Douglas O’Connell’s video projections impress throughout. Lloyd Webber has composed some new additions to the score however it’s the originals such as We’re Off to See the Wizard and Ding-Dong! The Witch is dead that truly shine.\n\nThis revamped revival is enormous fun with heaps of heart and some serious style. The talented cast joyously prove that there’s no place like Oz.

In an inspired choice Deloris is put into witness protection at a city convent where she soon starts spicing up the lives of her fellow sisters, much to the dismay of their Mother Superior (Sue Cleaver).\n\nThis nun on the run is reborn as Sister Mary Clarence, taking us on a glorious adventure, where the black and white of convent life is gradually and often hilariously transformed into vibrant technicolour, where Delores helps the sisters to secure their future and find their own voices while offering an opportunity to discover where she fits in, in this crazy world.\n\nReturning as the iconic Deloris Van Cartier, Landi Oshinowo is superb. She more than does justice to the role. Her voice is sensational, full of power and smooth as silk she belts out the big numbers with ease, while she delivers writers Bill and Cheri Steinkellner’s script with both style and sensitivity. Deloris’ changing relationship with Mother Superior (Sue Cleaver) is a wonderful thread that weaves throughout the story, there’s huge support for Cleaver in the audience and she convincingly shows her acting chops through the transitional journey she goes on.\n\nEloise Runnette makes for a hugely impressive Sister Mary Robert, she gives an authentic and memorable performance, fully immersing herself in the role as she quietly blossoms before our eyes. Special mention must also go to Alfie Parker as Eddie who comes close to stealing the show during his crowd pleasing solo, as well as nuns Sister Mary Lazarus (Julie Stark) and Sister Mary Partick (Isabel Canning) both are fantastic.\n\nWith its heavenly score from Alan Menken, Alistair David’s upbeat choreography as well as hilarious and heartwarming moments throughout, this fan favourite musical will have you praying for more. The infusions of gospel, soul, disco and Motown blend seamlessly to create a wonderfully uplifting score. While there’s a part of you that wishes they’d suddenly burst into ‘I Will Follow Him’ the group numbers more than make up for this. The ensemble pieces really elevate this show, at times when the pace begins to slow a little you know the next cleverly choreographed scene is just around the corner.\n\nSister Act is a hugely entertaining, camp, colourful celebration of friendship and finding one’s purpose. This enormously talented cast will raise your spirits and warm your heart with this joyful production.\n\nSister Act is on at Manchester’s Palace Theatre until Saturday 30th March tickets available here.\n\nReviewed by Nikki Cotter\n\nOpening Night verdict ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️\n\nFollowing successful runs on Broadway and in London’s West End, Pretty Woman arrives in Manchester this week as part of its first ever UK tour.\n\nThe musical stays faithful to the iconic 1990 movie starring Julia Roberts and Richard Gere, much to the delight of the audience who clearly revel in the nostalgia of the familiar.\n\nFor those unfamiliar (and I can’t imagine there are many) this is a classic Cinderella story with a twist, the twist being our ‘Cinderalla’, Vivian, is a sassy sex worker on the Hollywood Boulevard and our Prince Charming, Edward, is a money motivated entrepreneur, neither are looking for love but can just about cope with a week of no strings company.\n\nTaking on the role of Vivian Ward at tonight’s performance Paige Fenlon captures the essence of the character so iconically created by Julia Roberts brilliantly. She draws the audience in, getting them on side immediately with her warmth and wit. Her confident delivery of ‘I Can’t Go Back’ is a real highlight while her characterisation guarantees we all fall completely in love with her Vivian.\n\nBen Darcy makes for a wonderful Edward, ensuring the audience soon warm to him once his walls begin to come down. His vocals really shine while he makes Edward’s journey convincing and thoroughly enjoyable. The two have great on stage chemistry ensuring we’re really rooting for their happy ever after.\n\nPrevious Strictly champion Ore Oduba is a huge asset to this production as (Happy Man/Mr Thompson). A versatile performer with heaps of charisma he is a real joy to watch. Popping up when you least expect him to, each scene he delivers with a confident ease, endearing him wonderfully to this engaged audience. His pairing with Noah Harrison as bell-boy Giulio, is inspired. The talented pair really elevate this production, each scene more brilliant than the last, I wouldn’t say no to a Mr Thompson and Giulio spin-off, they are superb!\n\nSpecial mention must also go to Natalie Paris who blows us away with her stunning vocals as Vivienne’s best friend, Kit De Luca. She really is a world class talent and adds to this production enormously.\n\nDirector and choreographer Jerry Mitchell ensures this faithful retelling gives fans of the film everything they’d hope for in musical form. The iconic lines are there as are the classic scenes we all know and love. The opera scene particularly is stunning with Lila Falce-Bass and Josh Damer-Jennings delivering pitch perfect performances.\n\nPretty Woman ticks all the boxes for a perfect night of theatre escapism. It doesn’t take itself too seriously and delivers a super fun show as a result. It will entertain, charm and uplift you, make no mistake!\n\nPretty Woman The Musical is on at Manchester’s Palace Theatre until Saturday 16th March, tickets available here.\n\nReviewed by Nikki Cotter\n\nOpening Night verdict ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️\n\nBoth revolutionary in subject matter and in its impact on the theatre world, Hamilton has fast become one of the most beloved musicals of all time. Certified Hamilfan’s know the cast recording off by heart before even setting foot inside a theatre while favourite quotes have entered popular culture as its strength of message and sheer brilliance are praised the world over.\n\nEmbarking on its first ever (and much-anticipated) UK and Ireland tour, Hamilton has arrived at Manchester’s Palace Theatre for an incredible 15 week run, ensuring theatre fans from across the region get their opportunity to be in the room where it happens.\n\nHamilton tells the fascinating story of American founding father Alexander Hamilton, with a book, music, and lyrics by Lin-Manuel Miranda. This is a history lesson like no other as hip-hop, jazz, R&B and traditional musical theatre blend together to create a stunning score, reframing the traditional and driving it forward for a new generation. Throw in direction from Thomas Kail, orchestrations by Alex Lacamoire and incredible choreography by Andy Blankenbuehler and you’ve got the recipe for the perfect piece of theatre. Add to this a cast of insane talent and the result is a complete work of art.\n\nTaking on the titular role is Shaq Taylor: Taylor’s Hamilton is a strong, commanding visionary who proves undoubtedly that the pen is far mightier than the sword. He takes us on an incredible journey starting off, “young, scrappy and hungry” and ending the show leaving us questioning our own lives and legacies, “Who lives, who dies, who tells your story?”. He delivers Lin-Manuel Miranda’s complex lyrics with a relaxed ease and an immense precision.\n\nSam Oladeinde as Aaron Burr is tremendous, arrogant and scoffing one moment, defeated and broken the next, his delivery of Wait For It perfectly highlights the brilliance of this piece, as his focus shifts from contemplative silence to roaring energy within the blink of an eye. His character development and nuanced delivery as Hamilton’s foe is second to none.\n\nBilly Nevers is a remarkable Marquis de Lafayette/Thomas Jefferson, all bounding energy and slick beats he truly shines on stage. Perfectly cast, he brings real depth and well-judged humour to both roles giving an unforgettable performance.\n\nKM Drew Boateng shows incredible versatility as Hercules Mulligan/James Madison, two polar opposites whom Boateng more than masters while DeAngelo Jones as John Laurens/Phillip Hamilton is a joy, full of fun, bravado and brilliance.\n\nMaya Britto gives a world class performance as Eliza Hamilton, her solo Burn is heartbreakingly beautiful while her soaring vocals during the finale will make your heart swell. Aisha Jawando compliments Britto entirely as loving older sister Angelica, punchy and powerful delivering riffs to die for. Making up the trio of sisters is Gabriela Benedetti as Peggy Schuyler/Maria Reynolds who gets her well-deserved moment in the spotlight during Say No to This with vocals as smooth as silk.\n\nThis cast bring out the humour in Lin-Manuel Miranda’s script like I’ve never seen before, they are a tight knit team and the trust they clearly have in each other takes their collective performance to the next level.\n\nDaniel Boys further ramps up the laughs as the stomping, spoilt King George, while special mention must also go to Charles Simmons as George Washington, a calming presence amongst the compelling force that is Alexander Hamilton.\n\nHamilton truly is an ensemble production with the company taking on multiple roles and pushing the story forward through Blankenbuehler’s immaculate & intricate choreography. Their level of skill is mind-blowing. The diversity of this cast enriches this production wholeheartedly and will leave you wishing you could retake your seat and watch it immediately all over again. Manchester waited for it and Hamilton has well and truly delivered. Rise up and get yourselves to Manchester where Hamilton will turn your world upside down, epic in scale, breathtaking in brilliance.\n\nHamilton is on at Manchester’s Palace theatre until Saturday 24th February tickets are available here.\n\nReviewed by Nikki Cotter\n\nOpening Night verdict ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️\n\nBased on the 1980’s cinematic cult classic starring Winona Ryder and Christian Slater, Heathers The Musical – written and composed by Kevin Murphy and Laurence O’Keefe, makes for a deliciously dark and daring piece.\n\nSet in the brutal and unforgiving Westerberg High School, Heathers introduces us to Veronica, a sarcastic outcast who after years of falling foul to the food hall bullies unexpectedly finds favour with the popular girls; leader of the pack Heather Chandler, Heather McNamara and Heather Duke, who fulfil Chandlers every command. Suddenly sucked into this chaotic clique this dark comedy quickly lures you in and once the brooding J.D. enters the mix, the unexpected events come thick and fast.\n\nLeading the cast as wannabe social climber Veronica, Jenna Innes is superb, she bursts with both talent and charisma resulting in a truly unforgettable performance. Her pairing with Jacob Fowler, (most recently seen in Manchester as Hope Mill Theatre’s Prince Topher), is inspired, his dark, brooding J.D. is tremendous, nuanced and unpredictable. Their on-stage chemistry ramping up the believability of a love story turned obsession as we see J.D. push Veronica to reach for her dreams no matter what the cost. Both deliver stunning vocals while their acting skills are second to none.\n\nVerity Thompson makes for a perfect Heather Chandler, calculating and cruel she’s a queen bee with a sassy sting in her tail and a voice as perfect as her permanent pout. Her intro entrance with sidekicks Heather McNamara and Heather Duke has gained iconic status amongst Heathers fans who burst into spontaneous applause the second they appear, gliding across the stage, their bright blazers begging for attention amidst a swirling cloud of dry ice. Elise Zavou plays spoilt, spiteful Heather Duke superbly while Billie Bowman’s delivery of Lifeboat is one of the most touching, emotionally charged moments in the show.\n\nKinglsey Morton gives us a dose of reality with her excellent portrayal of Martha Dunnstock while Alex Woodward and Morgan Jackson as Jocks, Kurt Kelly and Ram Sweeney are hilarious.\n\nThere are several dark themes entwined within the script, references to date rape, bulimia, suicide, and homophobia amongst them, illustrating the messy reality of teenage life at Westerberg High but all are covered with sardonic wit.\n\nThe show bursts with brilliant numbers each with their own infectious hooks making you soon realise just why this show like the film it’s based on now has its own cult following. Seeing the theatre packed out with young theatregoers some of which cosplaying as the cast was a joy, the vibe felt fun, inclusive, and so welcoming.\n\nThis dark comedy delivers entirely, with its superb cast, slick choreography, and sublime vocals, you’ll be rushing to enrol yourself at Westerberg High. Fun, fierce and totally fabulous.\n\nHeathers The Musical is on at Manchester’s Palace Theatre until Saturday 12th August tickets available here.\n\nImages Pamela Raith\n\nReviewed by Jodie Crawford\n\nOpening Night verdict ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️\n\nQuite surprisingly this jukebox musical is not the actual story of Take That, nor is it the story of “The Band” which feature as a background soundtrack to this production. But, this is a glorious, heartwarming story of friendship, loss, love, fear and how it feels to love a boy band more than any thing else in the world.\n\nNow – disclaimer- I am not a huge Take That fan. I’m more of a New Kids on the Block girl, but after tonight I realised how the sound track of this musical has in fact been the sound track of so much of my late teenage years. A bit like: I’m not a fan of Angels by Robbie, yet I know all the words! What I also categorically know is that the Manchester audience tonight were absolutely gagging to see this Bobby Dazzler of a show.\n\nPutting Greatest Days in on Manchester is a Take That fans version of a United fan watching United in a premier league title match at Old Trafford. There is no better place for this show to be. It’s a wonderful homecoming.\n\nThe plot takes us back to the 90s, where we were wearing knee high socks and pleated tartan mini skirts or adidas trackies, where we were recording our favourite hits on our ghetto blasters on a Sunday afternoon while listening to the charts, where we were making up dances with our mates so that we could dance along when the Smash Hits poll winners party was on the telly. Here, we meet five friends, as different as the spice girls to one another. Who, thanks to the beautiful, talented Debbie (played by the magnificent Mary Moore) have the chance to go and see their favourite band play in Manchester. A treat like no other; all they have to do is tell a few lies to their parents and make their way to the concert. Their aim is to finally meet the boys, face to face. The night however doesn’t go as planned and their lives are never the same again.\n\nThe events of that night breaks the bond the girls have, until the once in a lifetime chance brings them together 25 years later.\n\nI don’t mind admitting it, I did shed quite a few tears at various moments of the show. And judging by the sniffing sounds around the auditorium, I wasn’t the only one.\n\nThe entire cast were incredible. The connections between the friends as their younger selves and then older selves was electric. And the scene where the younger version comes together with the older one was so enchantingly beautiful.\n\nSpecial mention goes to the wonderful Jamie-Rose Monk for her hilarious and touching portrayal of older Claire. Never have I laughed more than at the line “I like to sleep with a man and then eat him”. Rachel Marwood is a brilliant older Heather; I am not surprised that Rachel has been awarded a “funny woman” award previously – she is a great comic actress.\n\nHolly Aston, Hannah Brown, Emilie Cunliffe, Kitty Harris and Mari McGinley, were all outstanding in their performances. They work well together on stage and deserve every moment of the standing ovation given. While Kym Marsh was dazzling: she can sing, she can dance and Manchester love her, she’s one of ours and Mancunians couldn’t be prouder.\n\nThe “boys” did exactly what their role asks of them, they gave us a sound track, they didn’t take the limelight, they let the women shine in all their glory. And they did so with so much talent and humbleness. They help to tell the story, they know it’s not all about them and they take that with grace. And they also lead a fabulous finale!\n\nIt’s also worth the ticket price to see Alan Price in his many roles, a true legend of the stage in every sense of the word.\n\nThe music is what ties everything together in this production, the goosebumps on the back of my neck when “Never Forget” started up. You could feel the electricity sweep through the audience. Most people will go and see this show because they love Take That, but it’s more than a homage to a boy band-it’s a tribute to those of us who bonded with our ill fitting friends over our love of pop music. It’s a dedication to the girls who queued for hours for tickets or at stage door at the end of the night for a glimpse of their favourite member of the band. It’s a reflection of lives lived, and those not lived fully. It’s a chance to reminisce of how we saw ourselves 25 years ago and be proud of the women we became. It is nostalgic, but it’s also insightful and moving, a perfect night out.\n\nGreatest Days is on at Manchester’s Palace Theatre until Saturday 27th May tickets available here.\n\nReviewed by Nikki Cotter\n\nOpening Night verdict ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️\n\nMy Fair Lady tells the story of Eliza Doolitte, a cockney flower seller plucked from Covent Garden by pompous linguistics professor Henry Higgins who is determined to transform this ‘guttersnipe’ into a proper lady, no matter the cost.\n\nThis multi-award-winning production of Lerner & Loewe’s classic musical comes to Manchester following a critically acclaimed West End run and from the opening scene it’s clear to see why audiences from New York to the London have been captivated by this luverly revival.\n\nMichael Yeargan’s set design immediately impresses, managing to be both elaborate and functional, it is incredible, while Catherine Zuber’s sumptuous costumes are simply stunning, paying true homage to the authentic look of the My Fair Lady we’ve come to know and love.\n\nTaking on the role of Eliza, made famous by Audrey Hepburn in the 1964 movie version, Charlotte Kennedy breezes into the flower sellers boots and swiftly makes the role her own. From Wouldn’t It Be Loverley to I Could Have Danced All Night, she captivates entirely; her vocals are sublime. Eliza’s journey from start to finish is incredible to watch, as she brings real emotion to the complexities created by the Professors experiment.\n\nMichael D. Xavier makes for a wonderful Professor Higgins, suave and seemingly sophisticated he gives the character genuine likability and fantastic comedic value. His facial expressions and physicality add layers to the dialogue as he gifts the audience with laugh after laugh due to the absolute absurdity of his firmly held opinions. Despite his misogynistic leanings the effect Eliza has on him is wonderful to see, the pair have you rooting for them wholeheartedly as the bicker and bristle throughout.\n\nAdam Woodyatt is clearly having an absolute ball playing Eliza’s father, Alfred P Doolittle, a role he delivers with ease while impressing with his vocals, Get Me To The Church is a real highlight and also allows the talented ensemble to truly shine. Another stand out ensemble moment comes during the Ascot Gavette which is visually stunning with pitch perfect vocals.\n\nThe rest of the supporting cast are equally as strong. John Middleton’s portrayal of Colonel Pickering adds another wonderful element to the piece as he brings a light playfulness to the role.\n\nTom Liggins is great fun as Freddy Eynsford-Hill, a lovesick puppy desperate for Eliza’s affections. Heather Jackson is a self-assured Mrs Higgins while Lesley Garrett as Mrs Pearce reminds us all just how vocally talented she is.\n\nIf classic, classy theatre is what you want then that’s exactly what you’ll get from this stunning production. Everything about it feels top quality, from the cast to the costumes this lavish production hits every note. Bursting with much-loved songs, oozing with style and chock-full of talent this My Fair Lady is not to be missed.\n\nMy Fair Lady is on at Manchester’s Palace Theatre until Saturday 1st April tickets available here.\n\nReviewed by Nikki Cotter\n\nOpening Night verdict ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️\n\nThe award-winning musical which has been seen by over 110 million people worldwide has returned to Manchester for an incredible 19 week run, taking up residency at the city’s Palace Theatre.\n\nBased on the 1994 Disney animated feature film, The Lion King has been wowing audiences on Broadway for 25 years while also running continually in the West End since 1999; so it feels like a real treat to have this record-breaking show visit us here in the North West.\n\nTelling the story of Simba who is tricked into thinking he is responsible for the demise of his father Mufasa , The Lion King opens with a burst of brilliance as the iconic Circle of Life plays out in all its theatrical glory, no spoilers here but this truly is one of the most spectacular openers you’ll ever see as the animals of the Kingdom burst into beautiful, vibrant life, immersing the audience fully as they take their places in the Pridelands.\n\nJulie Taymor’s stunning costume design combined with Richard Hudson’s minimalist scenic design, vibrant lighting from Donald Holder and expressive choreography from Garth Fagan unite impressively to bring the sights and the sounds of Africa’s expansive savanna to the stage. Each scene fills you with wonder, often drawing spontaneous applause from the audience as the sheer magnificence of this production plays out. Julie Taymor and Michael Curry’s puppetry combined with intricate masks are spectacular and lift this production to a whole other level.\n\nThis is a true ensemble piece with a cast of over 50 talented performers, each and every one bringing their own piece of Disney magic to the stage. The vibrancy of the group numbers is an absolute joy, visually stunning and a total feast for the eyes, you honestly don’t know where to look, there’s so much happening on stage, every corner of the Palace Theatre feels alive.\n\nStephenson Ardern-Sodje and Nokwanda Khuzwayo are perfectly cast as Simba and Nala delivering the beloved characters with real heart and depth. Jean-Luc Guizonne is superb as Mufasa, commanding and calm with a gentle ease about him. Matthew Forbes is a wonderfully witty Zazu who gets the audience on side immediately with his strong characterisation and incredible puppetry skills. Another audience favourite is Thandazile Soni who is an absolute delight as Rafiki, Alan McHale and Carl Sanderson bring the laughs as Timon and Pumbaa while Richard Hurst as the brooding villain Scar is fantastic.\n\nThe show is jam-packed with much loved musical numbers including Can You Feel the Love Tonight, Hakuna Matata, I Just Can’t Wait to Be King, Be Prepared and of course Circle of Life while stunning additions for the stage include the powerful Shadowland and the stirring, He Lives in You.\n\nThe Lion King is an astonishing piece of theatre, adults will be wowed while children will be filled with awe and wonder. Magical memories will be made every night of this run in Manchester as The Lion King roars out until Saturday 11th March.\n\nTickets for The Lion King can be booked here."
