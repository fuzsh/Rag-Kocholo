        "meta_description": "In 1999, Tim Roth released The War Zone, adapted by Alexander Stuart from his 1989 novel of the same name. Set in a remote house in the county of Devon in southern England, this grim and yet delicate film deals centres on a family recently arrived from London. In the course of the film the alienated teenager Tom (played by Freddie Cunliffe) finds a way of coming to terms with the sexual abuse perpetrated by his father (Ray Winstone, credited simply as ‘Dad’) on his teenage sister Jessie (Lara...",

        "text": "2Like his friend and colleague Gary Oldman, whose first venture into screenwriting and directing, Nil by Mouth, had appeared in 1997, Roth decided to make a film more in line with the films for British television that had launched his career, Clarke’s Made in Britain (UK, 1982) and Leigh’s Meantime (UK, 1983), rather than the US indie movies in which he had performed in the 1990s; he even received funding from the same UK TV channel (Channel Four) that had produced Leigh’s first TV film, Meantime. Although Roth’s movie would be based, unlike Oldman’s, on the adaptation of a novel and not a semi-autobiographical script, Stuart’s novel echoed Roth’s own story of sexual abuse. Like Nil by Mouth, The War Zone was well received critically after premiering at Sundance in January 1999. Like Oldman, however, Roth has yet to direct a second film, though he regularly mentions in interviews his intention to do so.\n\n3It can of course be argued that all creative figures — actors, composers, directors, musicians, painters, singers — construct themselves as artists, that is to say they invent a persona that embodies their views on their art and art in general. The specificity of the actor-director lies in the fact that the star has already established him/herself in the industry and in the audience’s mind (and more importantly even, in her/his own), and must thus adjust to the pre-existing construct. In other words, the actor-director has ‘baggage’, and the fact that the new role features in the same industry and medium actually makes the venture more daring: in a sense, the actor should know more about movies than, say, poetry, painting or sculpture. This article offers an analysis of The War Zone and its paratexts in an attempt to determine how a highly successful actor like Roth managed, with just one film, to construct himself as a specific type of director with a particular view of cinema in mind. Attention will be paid to the adaptation process, to the film’s narration, and finally to what the actor perceived as his main challenge: directing other actors.\n\nThe Adapter as Auteur\n\n8 ‘The War Zone: Tim Roth Interview’, http://www.hollywood.com/general/the-war-zone-tim-roth-intervie (...)\n\n“My hope in making the film is that I made a good piece of cinema. First of all, I’m not a counselor, I’m not a therapist. […] All I can do is offer up what hopefully is an accurrate portrayal . . . on [sic] what it feels like to be a victim . . . and also to be an abuser, probably.”\n\n6It appears clear, in retrospect, that Roth’s motivations were highly personal. If he did not claim to be a therapist, he seems to have believed in the therapeutic potential of the material and even says of the “difficult” conversations he had with audiences:\n\n9 Urban, ‘Roth, Tim: The War Zone’.\n\n“[…] in the end it was cathartic. And I think a very good thing for me to do — as painful as it was.”\n\n8The second and most important modification affected the family’s social status: upper middle class in the novel, lower middle/working class in the film. Again, Stuart notes the biographical connection, but he also emphasises how problematic it is:\n\n12 Stuart, ‘The War Zone Diary’, p. 229.\n\n“I have always wanted the family to be middle-class because the cliché of abuse is of a working-class family, whereas it happens in every class […] But it’s important to Tim, and I feel that he, more than anyone, has to be comfortable with the milieu of the film.”\n\n10A third notable change concerns the gender of the new baby: the boy in the novel becomes a girl in the film. In this case, it is Stuart who admits that the main justification for the choice of gender in the novel was biographical and that the change furthers the dramatic potential:\n\n15 Stuart, ‘The War Zone Diary’, pp. 236.\n\n“in this case, the risk of Dad continuing the abuse with a new daughter raises all kinds of new horrors, both for Jessie and the audience.”\n\n12Along with the changing depiction of Tom’s encounter with Jessie’s London friend Carol, a fourth structural alteration to the novel radically affects its ending where the brother and sister duo is concerned. In the novel, Tom attacks his father but the latter survives, and Tom reconciles himself to their likely future negotiations; reinforcing her talent for carefree survival, and her dominance over Tom, Jessie takes herself off to the Caribbean, where she summons Tom. They end the novel together there, on the verge of sexual union and with Jessie’s aspiration to have a child. In the film, Tom takes refuge in the wartime lookout bunker on the cliffs where he witnessed his father’s abuse of his sister, and where she also resorted with her boyfriend Nick. He is joined there by Jessie, who cannot confirm if their father is still alive.\n\n20 Roth, ‘Afterword’, p. 220. Here I nod to Colin MacCabe (ed.), True to the Spirit: Film Adaptation a (...)\n\n“I wanted to end up with a film that honored the book and honored the subject. The worst adaptation is a literal adaptation — somehow you must follow your instincts and be true to the sadness of it. I wanted the audience to receive the impact of the book in the same way I had.”\n\n14What is being adapted, Roth suggests, is his experience and interpretation. The adaptation process reveals the web of insecurities, both professional and personal, faced by the actor turned director, but it also reveals how the actor constructs himself as the director of a serious and personal film, and thus as a serious and personal director, an endeavour Stuart suspected to be conscious enough:\n\n21 Stuart, ‘The War Zone Diary’, p. 246.\n\n“I wonder if for Tim there’s an element of acting the director — and when the actuality takes hold.”\n\nDirecting a European Art Film\n\n19The sense of alienation, uncertainty, and expectation is reinforced by the play on gazes. In the establishing shot of the living room, Mom stares into emptiness, suggesting she is oblivious to the tension (she is asleep in the next scene); a frontal medium close-up of Tom confirms that he is the main character, as established during the opening credits when we follow him riding his bike; only Jessie glances at her mother, father, and brother, hinting at her position as the character who is ‘in the know’. That gazes are problematic is reinforced by an uncertainty concerning the origin of the point-of-view. The rear shot of Mum and Dad at the kitchen sink is introduced by Jessie’s looking over her shoulder at them; the slow zoom-in reinforces the impression that the camera is aligned with her gaze. And yet this view of Mum washing Dad’s neck is followed by a reverse shot of Tom looking, coughing, and then looking up, thereby constructing him too as the source of the gaze. Tom’s position is reinforced in the next scene [4:39-5:28], thanks to a reverse frontal medium shot of him sitting at the kitchen table looking at the family, the long shot of the living room now aligned with his gaze.\n\n20The repetition of the establishing shot of the living room, this time with Jessie sitting in the armchair, Dad negotiating on the phone in the left background, and Tom off-screen, reproduces the sense that there is something going on here. The repetition of the frontal wide-angle establishing shot of the house with its symmetrical (and thus normal) façade [2:16, 20:38, 39:53, 44:41, 76:08] functions in the same manner: the house, as a metonymy of the family, becomes a mask that conceals the horror. It becomes, as the film progresses, the double of the clifftop bunker, a realist location gone Gothic (significantly, the last two shots of the house are set at night). The boxes on the floor suggest that they have just moved in, and we later learn that Tom is upset because he preferred life in London [19:40, 40:45]. (Again, this is much more explicit in the novel where the narrator complains about the move in the opening pages.) Mum and Dad seem close, the latter saying softly:\n\n“Leave it, darling, I’ll do that.”\n\n21Mum’s waters breaking at the end of the scene may lead us to believe that the portentous atmosphere was merely a means to build up the suspense leading to this event and, more dramatically even, to the car accident as they hurry to hospital in the next scene [6:30].\n\n22Yet even after the birth, the narration continues to play on the distance and proximity between the characters’ bodies, and the direction and objects of their gazes. When Dad lets Jessie and Tom in to meet their baby sister [8:44-9:51], the scene opens with a series of shot/reverse shots, with Dad singled out; the family is then briefly united in the same medium shot, but only briefly because Dad steps out of the hospital room with Jessie, who is again depicted as the one gazing at the other characters: her brother and mother, whose backs are turned and who thus ignore her as she exits with her father. In the beach scene that follows [9:52-10:45], Jessie, Dad and Tom are framed together in a very long shot, but Jessie steps away from the two men when they hug, leading the camera to pan to the right and upsetting the balance of the composition, an empty space now occupying its centre; the effect is reinforced by the use of a telephoto lens, which diminishes the sense of space afforded by the wide-angle establishing shot that opened the scene.\n\n24There follows a conflict of gazes, the shot/reverse shots depicting Tom looking down at the floor, while Jessie looks boldly at him in spite of her nudity. (The scene where Tom confronts Jessie with the nude pictures of her he found represents an intensification of this scene, Tom now looming over his sister and raising his voice [37:35-39:06].) The fourth scene with the establishing shot of the living room inverts the positions of the third instance, with Dad rocking baby Alice in the middle of the room and Mum on the phone [46:22-48:30]. Tom is once again seated at the kitchen table watching, and the scene is edited in eyeline match. With our suspicions stronger than ever (at this stage neither Tom nor the audience have witnessed what goes on in the bunker), the apparent normalcy of the situation has become a mere smokescreen for the horrific secret hovering in the room, a curtain waiting to fall shortly after Dad exits. The same can be said of the fighting between the two siblings. It evolves from something gratuitous and playful in the early scenes [13:45-14:10] to more serious struggles caused by the revelation of the incest [30:45, 37:35].\n\n25The play on bodies and gazes culminates in the scene of sexual abuse [51:18-56:02]. The ‘war zone’ is now made literal, as the family secret is enacted in a wartime building. The shelter, which was explicitly designed for the film, has two perfectly symmetrical slit-like windows; it is personified like Edgar Poe’s House of Usher, so that Tom’s peering in through a crack is akin to peering into someone’s mind. The bleak realism has made way for a quasi-Gothic space. The centrality of the gaze is reinforced by a mise-en-abyme, as Tom is determined to record the act on his camera. Significantly, the crime occurs in the dead centre of the room in a pool of white light, with two family members in close contact and surrounded by emptiness. The silence is broken only by Dad’s whispers and Jessie’s whimpers. The play on bodies and gazes is equally central to the staging of the act, directed by the abuser. Dad gazes down at his daughter as he undresses her, while she looks away twice. Sodomy is performed with Jessie on all fours, signifying both her submission and her father’s refusal to position her like Mum and see her face, and thus to acknowledge her pain, agony and subjectivity during the act. It befalls Tom to be the one who gazes at his sister’s plight, the shot/reverse shots depicting his face framed by the aperture and Jessie’s crying face — even when Dad’s face appears in the shot, it is turned away from Tom and is mostly in shadow.\n\n26After the act, however, Dad leans against the window in the right background and turns his back on Jessie, while she remains sitting on the floor, looking down. The space between them signifies a complex of emotions, including pain, shame, and denial. The expression of unavowed emotions is, as the metaphor in the title suggests, transferred on to the environment in an instance of pathetic fallacy. The penultimate scene, where Tom stabs Dad, represents an attempt to abolish the secret and to bring it out into the open [84:12-86:39]. When Tom enters his parents’ bedroom, Dad is sitting alone on the bed in the darkness, looking down. The shot/reverse shots which follow dramatise the confrontation between the siblings and the father as a conflict in which each gaze signifies knowledge but where one character (Dad) clings to denial (unlike in the novel, where he confesses). Consequently, the chain of close-ups is broken only when Tom stabs his father, where the camera has pulled back for a wider shot involving all three characters, in which Tom occupies the space between Jessie and Dad, in other words when he bridges the space of denial, significantly at the very moment when Dad protests:\n\n“You can’t keep saying these things, dar[ling]—”.\n\nDirecting Non-professional Actors\n\n29Casting non-professional actors is a clear aesthetic choice in keeping with the realist tradition. Roth wanted teenagers whose physiques and behaviour would be a natural fit for the characters. Stuart immediately approved Roth’s casting choices when he received the early screen tests:\n\n36 Stuart, ‘The War Zone Diary’, p. 240.\n\n“Lara Belmont, as Jessie, has the perfect mix of really interesting beauty (as opposed to simply glamour), vulnerability and strength that her character needs, and Freddie Cunliffe has the nervous smile, the awkwardness, and what looks like a totally believable potential for trouble, that immediately brings Tom alive for me.”\n\n38 Larry Getlen, ‘Tim Roth’s War Zone [sic]’, https://www.moviemaker.com/tim-roth-war-zone-20080201/, (...)\n\n“If we were thinking ‘oh, they were terrific in this film, or in that episode of this’, then we would not be looking at the kids. It would take out the element that they could possibly be our children, and it would be a barrier between the audience and the film.”\n\n“That’s just a natural thing. I think the problem is once you start learning something, you know, then you start to lose that naturalness and then you need to learn how to get it back again, you know. But — they’re tremendous.”\n\n35Cunliffe’s performance, like Roth’s in Meantime and Little Odessa, is predominantly monotonous. He walks slowly with a slight slouch, his unease with his body suggesting a lack of self-confidence; he is often looking down, and his gait and posture are highlighted by his clothing, most of the time an open hoodie with a loose T-shirt underneath. His face is by and large inexpressive regardless of the situation: when he steps out of the car after the accident [7:54], meets his baby sister Alice [9:28], talks to Lucy, to whom he is attracted [17:40], finds the nude polaroids of Jessie with Dad [38:38], confronts his sister after the bunker scene [59:50], tells Mom not to trust Dad at the hospital [74:04], and tells the latter he hates him [77:35].\n\n36Aesthetically speaking, Cunliffe’s low-key acting has two effects. First, his inexpressive face invites the viewer to speculate about his thoughts and emotions. In tandem with the play on gazes studied above, his blank look goes from expressing something like an average teenager’s annoyance (with his family, with the house-move), to bewilderment and disgust, and finally to accusatory anger; his look, like the situation as a whole, becomes increasingly readable as the narrative progresses, and is thus part and parcel of the film’s heuristic strategy. Second, his restrained acting endows the slightest variation with a heightened dramatic impact, rendering more salient the two instances where his expressionless demeanour breaks down and he cries [37:46, 87:08].\n\n37Cunliffe taps into a variety of techniques in order to create these slight disruptions. On three occasions, he busies himself with his hands — fiddling with a wine glass [5:08], holding a cigarette [37:12], and clasping them [59:04] — in typical ‘Method’ fashion. Cunliffe also resorts to muted histrionics in order to express the brutal emotions that overtake Tom. Two gestures in particular are utilised: Cunliffe turns away from the incestuous acts he witnesses in the bathroom (his mouth is even slightly parted) [20:55] and in the bunker [52:47] to express shock, and crosses his arms to evoke contained anger while observing his normal family [45:08], studying Jessie after she has been abused [58:09], and confronting his father with his crimes at the end [76:47, 84:15].\n\n38Finally, spontaneity is emphasised when Cunliffe coughs in the first medium close-up of Tom, then shakes his head once [4:22], shifts in his seat when criticising Devon [19:47], does an Indian war whoop [37:28], and when his mouth twitches when Jessie asks him if he likes Lucy [29 22] and when he burns his sister’s breast [60:34]. These gestures are not eminently readable (unlike histrionics) and do not become so through iteration (unlike Method acting techniques); they do contribute, however, to the construction of Tom as a specific individual (and in the case of the war whoop reinforce the metaphor in the title) and have a jarring effect that breaks the monotonous performance — which is sometimes reinforced by the editing, cuts occurring immediately after (the cough) or before (the war whoop). Cunliffe’s performance, like Roth’s in Meantime, builds up to a climax — in the form of a parent-sibling confrontation—that leaves Cunliffe slouching, head bowed, and crying in the bunker, expressing both Tom’s introverted personality and his torment [87:08].\n\n39As in Meantime and Little Odessa, the rift between two siblings is dramatised by contrasting a minimalist actor (Roth in Meantime and Little Odessa, Cunliffe in The War Zone) and a more energetic and/or effusive actor (Phil Daniels in Meantime, Edward Furlong in Little Odessa, Belmont in The War Zone). In the first confrontation scene between Tom and Jessie, the play on gazes (Cunliffe looking down, Belmont looking right at him) is reinforced by their postures (Cunliffe is hunched on himself, looking down) and costumes (though indoors, Cunliffe is still wearing his hoodie with the hood up, like Roth’s Colin in the final scenes of Meantime), opposing Jessie’s apparent confidence to Tom’s lack of it [22:44-24:42]. The second, as we have seen, is the one where Tom fights with Jessie on her bed, with both actors’ teary-eyed [37:35-39:16].\n\n40The power dynamic between the siblings evolves, however, as Tom’s knowledge increases. Subsequent scenes of confrontation depict Jessie in tears faced with her brother’s cold attitude. Such contrasts are dramatised through the shot/reverse shot technique [58:50-61:54] or analytical editing in the final confrontation with Dad [76:26-78:00; 84:12-86:39]; the frontal two-shot of Jessie and Tom in the car on the way back from the hospital in particular allows us to see the effect Tom’s harsh words have on his sister, which he can’t see since he’s sitting in the back seat [71:22-72:13]. With Jessie’s anguish increasingly visible, the contrast between Belmont’s and Cunliffe’s performances participates in both the adaptation and the heuristic strategy, the film leaving no doubt as to the identity of the abuser.\n\n41Roth’s endeavours to establish himself as a director with The War Zone is further proof, if need be, of the cultural capital attached to film at the turn of the century and to the people credited with making them. Clearly, the value attributed to the director testifies to the impact film awards, fandom, film criticism and film scholarship has had on the perception of film. A director is potentially an artist, an auteur, the conductor of a wonderful object called film, and thus a thing to be. But with enhanced value comes a host of responsibilities and fears, evidenced in some of the contradictory injunctions Roth made to Stuart. With The War Zone, the actor-director turned to his models and sought to inscribe himself in a tradition of European art cinema and British realism.\n\n42Like Johnny Depp with The Brave, Gary Oldman with Nil by Mouth, Steve Buscemi with Trees Lounge (USA, 1996), and Sarah Polley with Away from Her and Stories We Tell (Canada/UK/USA, 2006 and Canada, 2012), he sought to assert himself as a serious director of independent acting-based art films revolving around important topics that he knew something about. Roth’s adaptation of Stuart’s novel is thus an exercise in fidelity not so much to the source text as to the source of the film, that is to the director’s experience as an actor, a reader, and an abused child. With his mentors in mind, Roth attempted to pass on a personal view of acting that taps into a mix of techniques and traditions, and to orchestrate the energies of his actors into emotional contrasts.\n\n43The film’s main achievement, I would argue, has to do with its heuristic strategy and the way it adapts Stuart’s Nabokovian narration: the naturalistic acting and play on gazes (as constructed through camerawork and editing), by instilling a sense of suspense, aim to incite the viewer to be alert to the dark secrets lurking underneath the veneer of normalcy. The film is thus an exercise in analysis and interpretation, one that calls on an active spectator, but its strategy has real-world implications: its realism is meant to encourage us to pay heed to the signs surrounding us, where gestures and events are not as coded and dramatised. For all its realism, the film nonetheless maintains distance for both audiences (through the casting of Swinton and Winstone, and more generally its allegiance to the realist genre or mode) and even for Roth (by depicting female victims). Roth may not be a therapist or a counsellor, as he said in the interview cited above, but his fiction film does have a pedagogical and a moral intent: it warns us — nay, it implores us — to keep our eyes peeled, and to prick up our ears."
