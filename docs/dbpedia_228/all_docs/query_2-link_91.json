As the film points out, via testimonies from the likes of Kenneth Branagh and James Nesbitt, it's important to remember just how much of a pioneer Ellis was; a man who brought the Ulster accent into the homes of the United Kingdom with his breakthrough role as policeman Bert Lynch in Z Cars.

        "text": "Made in 2007, this documentary afforded Northern Ireland's most fondly remembered actor the chance to look back at his life and career in the twilight of his years.\n\nAs the film points out, via testimonies from the likes of Kenneth Branagh and James Nesbitt, it's important to remember just how much of a pioneer Ellis was; a man who brought the Ulster accent into the homes of the United Kingdom with his breakthrough role as policeman Bert Lynch in Z Cars. In the 1970s, Northern Ireland was forever associated with the Troubles, yet here was an Ulsterman who didn't cast that shadow. His work paved the way for those Northern Irish actors and many others of their generation, and continues to do so to this day.\n\nEllis revisits his childhood home, his old school and even takes the ferry across the Mersey (cue the inevitable blast of Gerry and the Pacemakers), as well as performs for the camera at his Nottinghamshire home in a corner of the room he refers to as his theatre. These moments are interspersed with chat from friends and admirers and a look back at the key moments of his career; from the controversy surrounding the staging of Over the Bridge as a young man in the 50s to his TV career, the highpoints of which (Z Cars, the Billy plays, with Graham Reid and the cast reuniting to discuss those, and Boys From the Blackstuff) are showcased, though Ellis himself is keen to include One By One, admitting that he could talk for hours alone about that zoo-veterinary drama that he clearly has much affection for, as indeed do I as a viewer. The film also explores Ellis' personal life, particularly the tragic murder of his son in 1989. Heartbreaking stuff.\n\nIt's the fifth anniversary of Ellis' death this year (in fact he passed away five years last month) and, as this film proves, he's not only an actor worth remembering, he's one that is very much missed from our screens."
