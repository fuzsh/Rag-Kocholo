        "text": "The following, rated on a system of 0 to 4 stars, are by Rick Groen and Liam Lacey. Full reviews appeared on the dates indicated. American Psycho **½ Based on Bret Easton Ellis's notorious tome, the film is a lot easier to watch than the book was to read. Casting a chiselled Christian Bales in the title role (Wall Street paragon by day, cold serial killer by night), director Mary Harron whisks the novel's gruesome sexual detail right out of the picture. Instead, she serves up the tale as a black and modestly entertaining comedy, keeping the focus squarely on the theme of corporate conformity and consumer greed. But since that theme is rather mundane, and the satiric targets all too easy, the film has the unintentional effect of exposing Ellis for what he is -- a guy who, when you get past his ghastly anatomy lessons, doesn't have very much to say. R (April 14) -- R.G. The Apple ***½ Iranian teenager Samira Makhmalbaf had a little high-profile help on this remarkable, formally inventive, graceful first film -- from her famous father, Mohsen Makhmalbaf ( A Moment of Innocence), who provided the screenplay and editing. However, she added her own inventions to a drama that uncovers deep truths about the relationship between love, fear and cruelty. PG (March 31) -- L.L. East-West **½ Back in 1992, director Régis Wargnier won a foreign film Oscar for Indochine, a tale of grand passions set against the turmoil of history. Here, he's back on similar turf. Still, its strong performances throughout can't raise it as nothing more than a disjointed update of Gone With the Wind. PG (March 31) -- L.L. Full Blast **½ The town is small, its only factory is shut down, and the young men are idle, drifting on an aimless tide of sex and suds and rock 'n' roll. What lends this familiar tale a measure of distinction is the New Brunswick setting, a strong ensemble cast, and director Rodrigue Jean's keen eye for local detail. R (April 7) -- R.G. High Fidelity *** Director Stephen Frears's ( The Grifters) lightweight, funny adaptation of English writer Nick Hornby's novel about the romantic misadventures of a pop-music-besotted underachiever translates nicely to its Chicago setting. John Cusack stars. AA (March 31) -- L.L. The Jaundiced Eye **½ Though it doesn't break any real new ground, this investigative documentary about a gay man and his father who were accused of child molesting is unsettling. The film makes a persuasive case that the two men were punished because of the community's antigay bias, fuelled by child-abuse hysteria. They were subsequently vindicated, but only after their lives were torn apart. NA (April 7) -- L.L. Post Mortem *** This Genie Award-winning first film from Quebec's Louis Bélanger is cleverly conceived and even more smartly cast. Gets credit for finding a new twist to an old-fashioned love story. AA (March 31) -- L.L. Price of Glory ** A former prize fighter (Jimmy Smits) lives out his failed dreams through his three scrappy sons. Fair enough, but boxing movies are rife with potential clichés, which the script must either ward off (a rare feat) or transform into heart-warming sentiment (the more common practice). Alas, Price of Glory fails on both counts, leaving us to ponder the price of admission -- 8 bucks for this cinematic undercard of unalloyed triteness. PG (April 7) -- R.G. Return to Me **½ Actress Bonnie Hunt, a one-time nurse, puts her medical training to good use here in this genially mediocre romantic comedy about an organ transplant. Minnie Driver plays a Chicago woman who needs a new heart, and then falls in love with the widower (David Duchovny) of her donor. There's lots of ethnic cuteness (she works in an Irish-Italian restaurant), a gorilla in a zoo, and romantic songs on the soundtrack. A suggested alternative title: Heartless in Chicago. PG (April 7) -- L.L. The Road to El Dorado **½ In this animated musical, Kevin Kline and Kenneth Branagh provide the voices of Tulio and Miguel, a couple of 16th-century dudes who stow away on Cortes's ship and, in a bold bit of historical revisionism, actually save an Amerindian civilization. Like the Bob Hope/Bing Crosby road movies, it's glib, moderately amusing and politically about 60 years out of date. Rosie Perez voices the flagrantly sexual native girl, Chel, who becomes the boys' partner in crime. PG (March 31) -- L.L. Rules of Engagement **½ The film takes a thorny contemporary issue -- the permissible use of military force in terrorist encounters -- and wraps it in the American flag. To anyone other than an ardent hawk, the fact that this hunk of rhetoric is consistently well-acted (by Tommy Lee Jones and Samuel L. Jackson) and relatively well-directed (by William Friedkin) may seem an aesthetic plus but an ethical minus -- it merely lends an air of authenticity to a bogus message. Make no mistake: Rules of Engagement is pure miltary propaganda dished out as mainstream entertainment. Banners don't come more star-spangled than this. AA (April 7) -- R.G. The Skulls ** This youth-oriented thriller stars Dawson Creek's Joshua Jackson as the college kid who makes a Faustian deal with a secret campus fraternity that will stop at nothing -- including really bad acting. The almost-saving grace of the movie is that even the filmmakers seem to know the material is laughable. AA (March 31) -- L.L. 28 Days **½ With Sandra Bullock as a recovering addict, 28 Days is a rollick in a rehab centre, a clean-but-never-sober comedy that makes a visit to Betty Ford seem like a merry month at Club Med. The screenwriter, Susannah Grant, is the same good-time girl who penned Erin Brockovich, but her timing is a bit off here. That movie was a clever crowd-pleaser; this is simply a suck-up. While scoring some laughs, it's essentially a happy-pill designed to yield moderate enjoyment while under the influence and leave absolutely no lingering after-effects. Any mood-enhancement will wear off fast -- give it about 28 seconds. AA (April 14) -- R.G. The War Zone **½ Actor Tim Roth's directorial debut is an austere, stylized rendering of Alexander Stuart's 1989 novel about a superficially ordinary English family destroyed by incest. The performances -- from veterans Ray Winstone and Tilda Swinton along with newcomers Lara Belmont and Freddie Cunliffe as their teenaged children, are uniformly powerful. The drama culminates with a harsh, controversial sex scene near the end of the film. But the problem isn't that The War Zone goes too far, but that it doesn't go far enough in giving the story context or wider resonance. The result is trouble in a bubble. R (April 7) -- L.L. The Whole Nine Yards ** Comes up about seven yards short. This is another of those under-powered vehicles designed to convey a member of the Friends cast from the small screen to the large. Not that Matthew Perry seems to notice. Ostensibly playing a nerdy dentist, he just recycles his Chandler persona from the sitcom -- the same sweet-natured klutz. Bruce Willis pops up as his next-door neighbour who doubles as a prolific hit man. Apparently, the laughs are intended to mount with the corpses, but somehow the math goes wrong -- there are bodies aplenty, yet barely a yuk in sight. AA (Feb. 18) -- R.G."
