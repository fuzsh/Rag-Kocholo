Bill Condon, the director of Dreamgirls, has been nominated for Outstanding Directorial Achievement in Feature Film by the Directors Guild of America. The winner of the award will be announced on Saturday, February 3 at the Hyatt Century Plaza Hotel in Los Angeles.

Condon will compete against co-directors Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Farris (Little Miss Sunshine), Stephen Frears (The Queen), Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu (Babel), and Martin Scorcese (The Departed). The DGA nominations are considered a very reliable predictor of the Academy Award nominations, which will be announced on January 23, and 51 of the past 57 DGA winners have also won the Oscar.
