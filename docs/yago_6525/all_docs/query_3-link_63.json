        "text": "One of Hollywood's most popular stage-to-screen filmmakers is taking on another Broadway project. Oscar-winning screenwriter Bill Condon will direct a new adaptation of Guys and Dolls for TriStar Pictures, which picked up the rights in 2019.\n\nDeadline reports Nicole Brown and Shary Shirazi will oversee Guys and Dolls for TriStar along with previously announced producers John Goldwyn and Marc Toberoff. Casting and a timeline will be announced at a later date.\n\nThe musical, featuring a score by Frank Loesser and a book by Jo Swerling and Abe Burrows, follows a fly-by-night gambler who attempts to woo a Salvation Army missioner for a $1,000 bet. Meanwhile, a beleaguered showgirl tries to hook her fianc√© of 14 years, the founder of \"the oldest, established, permanent, floating crap game in New York.\" It has been revived on Broadway three times since its 1950 premiere."
