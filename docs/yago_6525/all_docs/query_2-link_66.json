        "text": "\"When you look in the mirror and you don't see yourself, it really helps you portray the character,\" Knowles, who plays Deena Jones in Dreamgirls, a character loosely based on Motown diva Diana Ross and her supergroup, The Supremes.\n\nThe movie is also based on the successful 1980s Broadway musical, Dreamgirls.\n\nKnowles's dowdy look does not remain, as the musical follows the rise of her character's group, The Dreamgirls, over several decades.\n\nAfter Deena Jones begins, in the film, at age 16, the character blossoms into a beauty.\n\n\"The fact the character had so much range, that's what attracted me,\" Knowles said during an interview at a hotel on Manhattan's upper-east side.\n\n\"I was able to be someone aged 16 that's very plain.\"\n\nThe look was new to Texas-born Knowles, one of the world's most famous women with a music career filled with Grammy Awards and album sales topping 50 million.\n\n\"I was the plainest at the beginning,\" she said.\n\n\"They had to make me look really ragged, when everyone else looked glamorous.\n\n\"Then I was like a butterfly.\n\n\"Deena goes through the greatest transformation.\n\n\"She was a flawed, insecure person.\n\n\"She let this man completely control her.\n\n\"She was completely the opposite to me. She was so weak.\n\n\"I thought this is something I can show that I can be someone different from myself.\n\n\"That's why I wanted to lose the weight, that's why I suggested the big eyebrows and all of the things to make Deena completely different to me.\"\n\nThe diet was the controversial Master Cleanse, a 10-day fast where she only consumed an elixir of fresh-squeezed lemon juice, cayenne pepper, maple syrup and water.\n\n\"It's a fast,\" Knowles said.\n\n\"It cleanses your whole body.\n\n\"But, I also dieted after that for months until I finished the movie.\n\n\"After that I ate everything I could find and now I'm back to my normal weight.\"\n\nThe performance will likely reward Knowles with an Oscar nomination when they are announced early next year.\n\nShe has already picked up a Global Globe nomination for the role, competing against some of Hollywood's best - Meryl Streep, Annette Bening, Renee Zellweger and Toni Collette - for the best actress in a musical/comedy Globe.\n\nThe ambitious Knowles, who successfully broke away from her own famous trio singing group, Destiny's Child, for a Grammy Award winning, multi-platinum solo career, has had her sights on winning an Oscar.\n\nShe did not think it would be possible so soon.\n\n\"I wasn't expecting it from this movie,\" Knowles said.\n\n\"I wasn't expecting to become a bigger star or to get an Oscar for Dreamgirls.\n\n\"I just wanted to be part of something that was relevant and was amazing and showed me in a different light.\n\n\"If people want to give me Oscar buzz, excellent, because one day I want to win an Oscar.\n\n\"But, I feel I have a couple of other movies to do and still grow.\n\n\"Hopefully, I'll get that part to show I can do even more than what I did in this film.\"\n\nKnowles's Dreamgirls character comes under the control of car salesman-turned music mogul, Curtis Taylor Jr, played by Foxx.\n\nIt is a situation Knowles says she has never faced, even in her earlier years when as a 14-year-old her group Destiny's Child signed its first record deal.\n\n\"To be honest the record label didn't have much input because they didn't think we'd do that good,\" she said.\n\n\"So, we wrote our own songs and sold a lot of records.\n\n\"We had proven we knew what to do, so they didn't get involved.\n\n\"Really, they have never really got too involved because, thank God, they didn't care enough in the beginning to tell us what to do.\"\n\nKnowles says she has also been blessed with competent, business-minded family members, including her father Matthew, and mother Tina, protecting and guiding her from an early age.\n\nHer boyfriend, rapper and music mogul Shawn \"Jay-Z\" Carter, she says also helps her.\n\n\"Honesty around you is the most important thing in the world when you're a celebrity,\" Knowles offers.\n\n\"Kelly Rowland, my cousin, was in a group with me.\n\n\"Everyone around me is family and they tell me the truth and tell me when I do wrong and when I do great.\n\n\"Most people, they surround themselves with people who they pay, so the people tell them whatever they want to hear.\n\n\"Before they know it they have completely lost themselves.\n\n\"One thing I focus on as much as my craft is maintaining myself because I don't want to wake up one day and have no idea about anything because everyone has shot a bunch of bull to me.\""
