        "text": "Near the beginning of Bill Condon’s movie adaptation of the musical “Dreamgirls,” Jimmy Early (Eddie Murphy), a soul singer loosely based on James Brown, meets his three new backup singers: Effie (Jennifer Hudson), Deena (Beyoncé Knowles), and Lorrell (Anika Noni Rose). Jimmy, eager to score with all of them, gets down on his knees in mock submission. “Exactly what would you like Jimmy to do for you?,” he asks. The youngest, Lorrell, giggling with excitement, says, “You could teach us the song.” Moving to a piano backstage, Jimmy begins “Fake Your Way to the Top,” one of the many fast-boiling numbers that the composer Henry Krieger and the lyricist Tom Eyen wrote for the original show, which was directed and choreographed by Michael Bennett and opened on Broadway twenty-five years ago this month. As Eddie Murphy begins singing, a pianist takes his seat, and Murphy walks in front of the instrument and cues each of the girls to sing the decorative backup line, “round and round”—Anika Noni Rose in her giddy high soprano, Beyoncé Knowles in a softer, tamer style, and Jennifer Hudson in a throaty, deep mezzo that leaps into an exultant riff. Murphy whirls around, and suddenly, without any transition, he’s onstage, before an audience, doing the song with the three girls singing nearby.\n\nThe sigh you will hear across the country in the next few weeks is the sound of a gratified audience: a great movie musical has been made at last. For me, and perhaps for many others, the Oscar-winning “Chicago,” with its overwrought heave and strain, its dancing bodies broken into piston-thrust fragments, wasn’t even close to the real thing. “Dreamgirls” is a singing, not a dancing, musical, so Condon, who wrote “Chicago” (and who directed “Gods and Monsters” and “Kinsey”) is never tempted to break bodies into pieces. In any case, we can tell from the easy fluency of the movie that his basic urge is to merge and join things, not to separate them. Again and again, he lets a declaration of love, an argument, a music-business event flow directly into the next moment, and then into the next, in an exhilarating organic structure with liquid joints. “Dreamgirls” is a barely disguised account of Berry Gordy and the rise of the Supremes; it features some brief, crisply written expository passages and several photo-montage sequences that detail the emergence of black artists as a major commercial force in American music of the nineteen-sixties—all seen against a background of the Detroit riots and the civil-rights movement. But, apart from these episodes, just about everything is sung, and, in this movie, the songs aren’t merely commentary on the narrative and the personal conflicts; they are the narrative and the drama—a rousing success story that is also (though we don’t realize it right away) a parallel story of failure.\n\nWhen we first see Curtis Taylor, Jr. (the Berry Gordy character, played by Jamie Foxx), he’s a hustler with pomaded hair and a roving eye who’s lounging backstage at a talent show. Quickly, he aces out an aging manager (Danny Glover) and takes command of the three girls, their songwriter, C.C. (Keith Robinson), and Jimmy, too. Curtis softens and homogenizes the girls’ sound, dresses them in elaborate wigs, white satin dresses with trumpet hems, and elbow-length gloves, and creates a sparkling landscape of light around them. He succeeds in leading them out of the wilderness of R. & B. and into the promised land of the pop charts. But one of the girls doesn’t fit—the beautiful but oversized Effie, the lead singer with a big voice and a bigger mouth. When Curtis replaces her as the lead with the demure Deena, she explodes, and the movie reaches a sustained peak with two long, interlocked numbers: “It’s All Over,” in which Effie holds out against no fewer than four characters, singly and in pairs, the group breaking apart and reforming again and again; and then the song that stopped the show on Broadway, “And I Am Telling You I’m Not Going,” performed by Effie alone. Jennifer Hudson, the young singer who was voted off “American Idol” for the same reasons that Effie gets tossed out of the group here, begins quietly and reaches a pitch of wailing defiance that goes on forever. As a piece of singing, this performance is intentionally over the top—exciting but almost scary in its intensity.\n\nEffie is gone but not forgotten: she will sing better than ever, and in her own soulful, all-out style, which is radically different from the processed technique and commercial-dance-music rhythms of the revamped Dreamgirls. At the same time, Beyoncé Knowles’s Deena, whom we had hardly noticed before, moves into the center of the movie. Deena is based, of course, on that glamorous imp Diana Ross, and the long-waisted, utterly beautiful Knowles gets photographed, as Ross did, in an infinite number of extravagant costumes and hairdos. The Dreamgirls, with their polished routines that appeal to white audiences, go through the roof, and Deena becomes a diva, an icon, an image with little sense of her own reality. Curtis had chosen her as the lead precisely because her singing was bland, and, at first, she plays along, singing well but without individuality. But when Deena decides to break away from Curtis, Knowles, without much makeup, her long hair hanging straight down, sings an anthem of liberation called “Listen” with shattering power. Knowles can do anything she wants musically; her acting is still rudimentary, but she has the presence and the talent to spark a serious revival of film musicals. Foxx, keeping his voice low, extends his range as the cruelly manipulative Curtis, but the highest acting honors go to Eddie Murphy. His Jimmy, a screamer who loves to throw himself down onstage, tries to go sweet and soft, like Johnny Mathis, but can’t do it and falls apart in public. Jimmy has a puzzled desperation that Murphy has never demonstrated before.\n\nThroughout “Dreamgirls,” Condon pursues two tracks: he celebrates the chart-topping success of groups like the Supremes, but he makes it clear that what they have achieved, however exciting, is not the same thing as artistic success. Effie, too idiosyncratic for pop, remains the artist. “Dreamgirls” fulfills the ecstatic promise inherent in all musicals—that life can be dissolved into song and dance—but it does so without relinquishing the toughest estimate of how money and power work in the real world that song and dance leave behind.\n\nIn Robert De Niro’s “The Good Shepherd”—one of the most impressive movies ever made about espionage—the hero, Edward Wilson (Matt Damon), who becomes an agent in the O.S.S. during the Second World War and then a higher-up in the C.I.A., goes through life with just a single hobby. He spends hours placing ships in tiny bottles. A precise, selfless, and stolid man who speaks as little as possible, he rides a Washington bus each morning in a standard-issue raincoat and a gray hat, apparently just another government employee heading to work. Wilson is shrewd but entirely without humor—a joke, after all, might give something away. Sex is also out of the question. Every time he makes love to a woman—indeed, any time anybody makes love in this movie—the result is a disaster, for sex is an unguarded expression of self that can reveal secrets or leave one open to blackmail. Wilson is a superb functionary of the American colossus that grew out of the war, during that serious time when East Coast Wasp aristocrats—Dean Acheson, George Kennan, John J. McCloy, and others—appointed themselves guardians of the nation. This movie, which the screenwriter, Eric Roth, struggled to get made for years, is a sharply knowing social history of the C.I.A. and also a melancholy account of the hollowing out of one of its key players. (Wilson appears to be an amalgam of James Jesus Angleton and Richard Bissell.) Moving backward and forward in time, and netted with an intricate array of hints, secrets, warnings, and echoes, the story of Edward Wilson is the narrative embodiment of paranoia.\n\nJust after the failed Bay of Pigs invasion, in April, 1961, an intentionally slurred audiotape of a couple making love, accompanied by an indistinct photograph, is deposited under Wilson’s door. The evidence—or whatever it is—may contain a clue to why Fidel Castro’s forces knew in advance where the invaders were landing. As in a John le Carré novel, Wilson is being tantalized with fragments. Someone in a foreign intelligence service is presenting him with a riddle whose solution will draw him out of his Washington fortress and expose and destroy him. As the material is enlarged, altered, and repeatedly analyzed, the filmmakers fly back through time, to 1939, when the young Wilson, after a sterling rendition of Gilbert and Sullivan’s “I’m Called Little Buttercup,” in drag, is inducted into Yale’s Skull and Bones society, a kind of mystic brotherhood that humiliates its inductees and excludes everyone else. From this group of young gents General Bill Sullivan (i.e., “Wild Bill” Donovan, the founder of the O.S.S.), played by De Niro, recruits his men. (Jews, Catholics, and Negroes need not apply.) Wilson jumps into marriage with a socially prominent young woman (Angelina Jolie), only to leave her for six years of service in London and postwar Berlin, where he works with a British agent (Billy Crudup) modelled on Kim Philby—a man of immense charm who turns espionage into an amusing dance of treachery. In Skull and Bones, and then in the agency, Wilson is imbued with the fraternal virtues of loyalty and trust. But the operational truth of espionage is the opposite—the most intricate and savage betrayal. If necessary, in this movie intelligence services will kill their own agents when they know too much.\n\n“The Good Shepherd” has a reticent beauty (the colors are subdued and blended) and a sombre exactitude that gives way, now and then, to episodes of anguished emotion. Like Al Pacino in “The Godfather II,” Matt Damon recedes further and further into himself; his Wilson is as much a victim as a hero, a man who can’t, or won’t, protect those closest to him. A good part of the time, he operates in a fog of surmise and unprovable suspicion. For spies, particularly for moles and double agents, time is meaningless, since the job of penetrating another country’s secret service may take a decade or more to pay off. Something a man says to Wilson—a bit of chatter, an inadvertence—may mean nothing when he hears it but a great deal a dozen years later; the movie sews these moments together, and when the pattern becomes clear we are both impressed and chilled. De Niro has directed only one movie in the past—“A Bronx Tale”—but long stretches of this one are masterly: swift, terse, but never rushed.\n\nIn crass operational terms, the C.I.A. shown here wins a few (overthrowing a popular leftist leader in South America) and loses a few (the Bay of Pigs). The movie firmly plants the suggestion that the agency persistently overestimated Soviet capabilities in order to justify its own existence. But “The Good Shepherd” won’t ask the ultimate question: Would the Cold War have come out any differently if hundreds of agents on both sides hadn’t been killed? Isn’t espionage just a closed, circulatory activity for debonair thugs—intellectuals with a sense of danger and an inordinate capacity for deception? They all seem to be making ships in a bottle, which is not quite the same thing as launching a fleet of seaworthy craft. ♦"
