The Dreamgirls are loosely based on The Supremes, with Beyoncé in the lead role as Deena Jones (Diana Ross), Anika Noni Rose as Lorrell Maya Robinson (Mary Wilson), and Jennifer Hudson as Effie White (Florence Ballard). Jamie Foxx plays their sleazy manager Curtis Taylor Jr, based on Motown founder Berry Gordy Jr. Diana Ross may be leader of The Supremes and Deena Jones may be leader of the Dreamgirls, but it's the Florence Ballard-inspired Effie White who makes her mark in the film, thanks to Jennifer Hudson. Hudson has only been on the scene for two years, having made her debut on American Idol in 2004, where she was sixth runner-up to winner Fantasia Barrino. Director Bill Condon auditioned nearly 800 actresses for the role of Effie, but couldn't find what he was looking for: a relative newcomer who could carry the emotional weight of a woman who loses everything and fights to gain it back. Plus, she had to be able to sing songs like \"Love You I Do,\" \"And I Am Telling You I'm Not Going,\" \"I Am Changing,\" and – Effie's comeback song – \"One Night Only.\" He nearly cast Idol winner Barrino, but found his star in runner-up Hudson. Never mind that she had never acted before. With an $80 million budget, Dreamgirls is the most expensive film with an all-African American cast ever made in the US, and it earns $154.8 million at the box office. Hudson's performance stands out among critics and she wins an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress. Eddie Murphy, who plays R&B singer Jimmy \"Thunder\" Early (a combination of stars like Marvin Gaye and James Brown), is nominated for Best Supporting Actor. Three of the film's songs are nominated for Best Original Song: \"Listen,\" \"Patience,\" and \"Love You I Do.\"\n\nCategories\n\nFilm Debuts\n\nMovies"
