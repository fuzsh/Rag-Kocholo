        "text": "Peninsula Daily News and news sources\n\nBill Condon of “Dreamgirls” fame was named Wednesday the director for the long-rumored fourth part to the “Twilight” movie saga.\n\nThe fourth movie, which will be written by Melissa Rosenberg — who also wrote the first three films — will tell the epic tale of Bella Swan and Edward Cullen’s marriage and subsequent adventures.\n\nMTV.com said that Stephenie Meyer is also named as a producer for the film, a first for the author of the best-selling four-novel series set in Forks.\n\n“I’m so thrilled that Bill wants to work with us. I think he’s going to be a great fit, and I’m excited to see what he does with the material,” Meyer said in a prepared statement.\n\nThe release date, filming locations and whether or not the story would be filmed as one movie or two were not yet announced.\n\n“Bringing Stephenie Meyer’s ‘Breaking Dawn’ to the screen requires a graceful and intelligent hand, and we believe Bill Condon is exactly the right steward, having shown equal and abundant talents of immense creativity and subtle sensitivity,” said Erik Feig, Summit Entertainment president, in a statement.\n\nRumors are also circulating that the movie could be filmed in 3-D, MTV said, adding that no comment was forthcoming from Summit on the issue.\n\n“I’m very excited to get the chance to bring the climax of this saga to life on-screen,” Condon said."
