Act One is set in the fabulous sixties – a time when we were still screaming at Elvis and listening to the Beatles, but were dancing to the new beat of countless girl and boy groups like The Supremes, The Marvelettes, The Temptations and The Shirelles. Dreamgirls is not just about the singing and the dancing and the performing. The play is also about the behind-the-scenes reality of the entertainment industry – the business part of show business that made possible this cultural phenomenon. Act Two shows the creation and the arrival of disco – though the word is never used in the script. The subject matter of this play deals with a musical contribution to America of such importance that only now – decades later – are we beginning to understand.” – Michael Bennett\n\nAct I\n\nIn 1962, at the world-famous Apollo Theatre in New York City, The Dreamettes arrive late for a talent contest that they hope will launch their R&B career. The trio, featuring the powerful lead singer Effie White backed up by willowy Deena and sassy Lorrell, is accompanied by Effie's brother C.C., who writes all their material. Smooth-talking businessman Curtis Taylor manipulates the contest, and The Dreamettes do not win the trophy. Instead, Curtis becomes the group's manager, and he negotiates a job for the girls as backup singers for gospel star Jimmy Early.\n\nJimmy and The Dreamettes begin touring, and they soon record their first song, \"Cadillac Car,\" written by C.C. But the song is also recorded and popularized by a white group in a bland pop style. The girls, C.C., Curtis, and Jimmy's agent Marty are all outraged. Curtis vows that the group will not be taken advantage of again (\"Steppin' to the Bad Side\").\n\nCurtis books Jimmy and The Dreamettes as the first black act to appear in Miami Beach, and everyone is elated. Meanwhile, Curtis begins a relationship with Effie, primarily to manipulate the fortunes of the group, and Jimmy - despite being married - begins a relationship with Lorrell.\n\nSeeking a wider audience, Curtis promotes the girls as their own act, The Dreams. But first, Curtis decides to replace lead singer Effie with Deena, whom he believes has the 'look' of success. Effie, embittered by this betrayal, resists singing backup, and C.C. and the group try unsuccessfully to comfort her (\"Family\"). Meanwhile Jimmy, enticed by Curtis' aggressive management style, leaves his agent, Marty.\n\nThe Dreams, now led by Deena, find greater success (\"Dreamgirls\"). Privately, however, relationships within the group continue to deteriorate. Effie's behavior and appearance further decline, and tempers flare (\"It's All Over\"). Curtis is forced to replace Effie with Michelle, and Effie's pain and frustration finally spill over (\"And I'm Tellin' You I'm Not Going\"). The new trio, redubbed Deena Jones and The Dreams, headlines at the Las Vegas Hilton, and their future appears bright.\n\nAct II\n\nFive years later, Deena and The Dreams are at the pinnacle of their career. Effie, on the other hand, struggles to pull herself together. With Marty now acting as her agent, Effie auditions for a job in a Chicago club (\"I Am Changing\").\n\nTensions continue to escalate with Deena and The Dreams; C.C. and Curtis have serious artistic differences over C.C.'s new song \"One Night Only,\" and Deena intends to pursue a movie career, much to Curtis' dismay (\"When I First Saw You\"). With Jimmy's career in a deep decline, Lorrell finally leaves him, bitterly noting that after seven years, Jimmy never did divorce his wife (\"Ain't No Party\").\n\nBack in Chicago, C.C. apologizes to his sister for deserting her, and they reconcile (\"I Miss You, Old Friend\"). He offers her the song \"One Night Only,\" and Effie's recording of the song moves toward the top of the charts. Curtis, incensed that Effie would challenge the Dreams' disco version of \"One Night Only,\" uses his influence to undercut Effie's version. But Marty uncovers Curtis' illegal business practices, and Deena finally leaves Curtis. After years of bitterness, Effie and Deena reunite. The Dreams present a farewell concert (\"Hard To Say Goodbye, My Love\") and just before the curtain closes, they invite Effie on stage for one final performance of their signature song, \"Dreamgirls.\""
