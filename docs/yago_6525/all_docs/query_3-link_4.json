        "text": "William \"Bill\" Condon is an American director and screenwriter, who is best known for directing critically acclaimed films, such as Sister, Sister (1987), Gods and Monsters (1998), Kinsey (2004), and Dreamgirls (2006).\n\nFor Disney, he directed the 2017 live-action remake of Beauty and the Beast. He also wrote the screenplay for the 2002 Miramax film Chicago and directed The Fifth Estate. He is currently set to write and direct the upcoming film Marley.[1]\n\nBorn in New York City, Condon was raised in an Irish Catholic family. He attended Regis High School and then Columbia College of Columbia University, graduating in 1976 with a degree in philosophy. Two films had a significant impact of Condon's early life. At the age of twelve, he found himself drawn to screenplay writing with his first viewing of Bonnie & Clyde. In college he saw Sweet Charity (1969), which led to \"a lifelong love affair with movies that are reviled and rejected in their time.\" After completing college, Condon worked as a journalist for film magazines, including American Film and Millimeter. In 1981, he won \"the world's most difficult film trivia quiz\" sponsored by The Village Voice.\n\nGallery[]\n\nReferences[]\n\n[]"
