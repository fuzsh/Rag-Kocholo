        "text": "Leigh plays an emotionally unhinged young woman who runs a small hotel in the Louisiana swamps with her overbearing elder sister (Judith Ivey). The arrival of Stoltz’s handsome political aide stirs up long-dormant family secrets in this steamy, yet largely incoherent, Southern noir.\n\nThe film was ultimately taken away from Condon before completion, and he would spend most of the next decade languishing in television purgatory.\n\n10. The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn Part 1 (2011)\n\nFollowing Harry Potter’s lead, the final volume of Stephenie Meyer’s teen vampire opus was split in two, with Condon handed directorial reins to both halves.\n\nShot back-to-back, but released a year apart, part one suffers immensely from having its climax excised.\n\nLeft to chronicle the ludicrous wedding and honeymoon of Kristen Stewart’s teen bride and Robert Pattinson’s thousand-year-old vampire, followed by a grotesquely fast pregnancy, the result is an unintentionally hilarious procession of over-lit, overdressed soap opera shenanigans.\n\nIt marked the insipid low point of a franchise struggling to be taken seriously.\n\n9. Candyman: Farewell to the Flesh (1995)\n\nCondon returned to feature-film making with this serviceable sequel to Bernard Rose’s excellent 1992 shocker, set in New Orleans during Mardi Gras.\n\nKelly Rowan (The OC) plays a young schoolteacher whose family is embroiled in the Candyman legend, while Tony Todd reprises his role as the hook-handed bogeyman who will materialise before anyone who utters his name into a mirror five times.\n\nCondon again evokes a balmy Southern Gothic atmosphere, while delving into the racially charged origins of his eponymous anti-hero.\n\n8. The Fifth Estate (2013)\n\nNot even Benedict Cumberbatch can garner much sympathy for WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange in Condon’s tepid tale of the controversial whistle-blower. Visual flourishes fail to spice up the story, which remains an emotionally inert saga of awkward introverts poring over computer screens.\n\nTheir misguided efforts to destabilise the establishment by publishing hundreds of thousands of leaked documents relating to US military operations in Afghanistan, among other legitimate atrocities, is overshadowed throughout by Assange’s narcissistic tendencies and overall loathsome personality.\n\n7. The Good Liar (2019)\n\nIan McKellen stars as a career con artist who sets his sights on Helen Mirren’s wealthy widow, in Condon’s frivolous adaptation of the Nicholas Searle novel.\n\nWhat begins as an entertaining crime caper soon spirals into absurdity, as the narrative attempts to add historical heft to the wheeler-dealings.\n\nSharing the screen for the very first time in their careers, McKellen and Mirren elevate the proceedings considerably, in both their charmingly awkward flirtations and duplicitous deceptions, but Condon can only do so much with such flawed material.\n\n6. The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn Part 2 (2012)\n\nAfter enduring the risible first half of Breaking Dawn, audiences were rewarded with a suitably bonkers finale to the Twilight franchise that even hard-core horror fans could get behind.\n\nFinally transformed into a vampire, Bella (Kristen Stewart) gets a crash course in feeding, breeding, and honing her special abilities, before news of her freakishly fast-growing offspring triggers a spectacularly violent confrontation between the Cullens and camptastic Euro overlords, the Volturi.\n\nAudiences are also treated to early glimpses of future stars Rami Malek, Mackenzie Foy, and Lee Pace.\n\n5. Beauty and the Beast (2017)\n\nBreaking Dawn proved Condon was capable of spinning a treasured property into box office gold, but he went one better with this all-out live-action remake of Disney’s animated classic.\n\nEmma Watson plays the small-town beauty who is taken prisoner in an enchanted castle by Dan Stephens’ beastly prince, to be freed only by love’s true kiss.\n\nCondon added a couple of new musical numbers, but otherwise hewed uncannily close to Disney’s 1991 Oscars Best Picture nominee, and was rewarded with a US$1.2 billion haul at the global box office.\n\n4. Mr. Holmes (2015)\n\nCondon reunites with McKellen once again, to do for Sherlock Holmes what they had previously achieved for filmmaker James Whale in Gods and Monsters.\n\nAdapted from Mitch Cullin’s novel A Slight Trick of the Mind, an ageing Holmes returns from a trip to post-war Japan, only to be haunted by his final, unsolved case from 30 years earlier.\n\nMcKellen’s fragile performance sees the veteran actor at his understated best, while Condon’s dexterous direction interweaves a triple-tiered narrative of deceptive complexity with consummate ease.\n\n3. Dreamgirls (2006)\n\nFollowing his Academy Award nomination for penning the screenplay to Chicago, Condon was tagged to write and direct this long-gestating adaptation of the hit Broadway musical.\n\nInspired by the true story of Diana Ross and the Supremes, Dreamgirls stars Beyoncé, Jamie Foxx, and a never-better Eddie Murphy, and sees the debut of American Idol contestant Jennifer Hudson.\n\nAt the time the most expensive film featuring a predominantly African-American cast, Condon’s toe-tapping, hip-swinging, whirlwind tour of sex, drugs, and Motown remains a soulful triumph.\n\n2. Gods and Monsters (1998)\n\nAfter a decade of false starts and woeful failures, Condon finally found his form with this playfully melancholic delight chronicling the final days of James Whale, director of classic Universal Studios horror films Frankenstein, The Invisible Man, and The Bride of Frankenstein.\n\nIan McKellen earned his first Academy Award nomination for his sensitive portrayal of Whale, while Condon won for his screenplay, in which the ailing filmmaker, haunted by wartime memories and a lifetime of persecution, strikes up a flirtatious kinship with his strapping new gardener (Brendan Fraser).\n\n1. Kinsey (2004)\n\nCondon’s thoughtful and gently humorous biopic of revolutionary sex researcher Alfred Kinsey is his most finely crafted and complete work.\n\nLiam Neeson is perfectly cast as the gentle giant who dedicated his life to the exploration and education of human sexual behaviour, at a time when society shied away from anything more explicit than the birds and the bees.\n\nLaura Linney earned an Academy Award nomination as Kinsey’s open-minded and big-hearted life companion, at the empathetic centre of Condon’s highly personal celebration of tolerance and understanding.\n\nThis article appeared in the South China Morning Post print edition as: Tracing a career of peaks and troughs"
