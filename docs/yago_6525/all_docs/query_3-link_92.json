        "text": "After a four year hiatus from his last movie musical, Bill Condon is set to direct Tristar’s remake of the 1955 film, Guys and Dolls, according to Deadline.\n\nCondon’s return to the genre represents a familiar pattern for him having adapted Broadway hits to the big screen before. His Academy Award nominated screenplay for 2002’s Chicago, as well as his 2006 film adaptation of Dreamgirls come to mind.\n\nThe story of the acclaimed musical Guys and Dolls follows two gambler’s exploits in betting and romance. This comes as they try to find the location and finances for their next craps game.\n\nThe Academy Award nominated original starred the likes of Frank Sinatra, Marlon Brando, Vivian Blaine and Jean Simmons. It also leading to a highly successful revival of the play on Broadway in 1992 starring Nathan Lane.\n\nWhile there is no casting news yet, the musical scouted talent such as Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Channing Tatum. However, this was before the project fell through under 20th Century Fox.\n\nTriStar acquired the rights to remake the film in 2019 and handed over producing duties to John Goldwyn and Marc Toberoff with Meyer Gottlieb acting as executive producer.\n\nFor more updates on Guys and Dolls and other remake news, check back in for more on Awards Radar."
