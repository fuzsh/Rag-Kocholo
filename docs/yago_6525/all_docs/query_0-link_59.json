        "text": "The official companion book featuring essays exploring the production of the film, Michael Bennett's legendary Broadway musical, and the historic Motown revolution that inspired both. Illustrated with more than 200 color stills, concept paintings, costume designs, album art, and archival photographs.\n\nTwenty-five years after first bringing Broadway audiences to their feet, the Tony Award-winning musical sensation Dreamgirls comes to the big screen, starring Academy Award® winner Jamie Foxx (Ray), Beyoncé Knowles (Austin Powers in Goldmember), Eddie Murphy (The Nutty Professor, Dr. Dolittle), Danny Glover (Lethal Weapon), Jennifer Hudson (American Idol), and Tony Award winner Anika Noni Rose (Broadway's Caroline or Change).\n\nSet in the turbulent 1960s to mid-70s, Dreamgirls follows the rise of a trio of women-Deena (Beyoncé Knowles), Effie (Jennifer Hudson), and Lorrell (Anika Noni Rose)-who have formed a promising singing group called The Dreamettes. At a talent competition, they are discovered by an ambitious manager named Curtis Taylor Jr. (Jamie Foxx), who offers them the opportunity of a lifetime: to become the back-up singers for headliner James \"Thunder\" Early (Eddie Murphy). Curtis gradually takes control of the girls' look and sound, eventually giving them their own shot in the spotlight as The Dreams. That spotlight, however, begins to narrow in on Deena, finally pushing the less attractive Effie out altogether. Though The Dreams become a crossover phenomenon, they soon realize that the cost of fame and fortune may be higher than they ever imagined.\n\nCapturing the extraordinary visual style and power of the movie, the book features more than 200 color stills, drawings, concept paintings, costume designs, storyboards, album art, and archival photos about the cast, music, choreography, costumes, production, set design, and historical foundation for the period when the story occurs.\n\nThe text, including extensive interviews with Bill Condon and others in the cast and crew, is written exclusively for the Newmarket book by distinguished writers Martin Gottfried (author of Broadway Musicals and All His Jazz: The Life and Death of Bob Fosse) and Cheo Hodari Coker (journalist and author of Unbelievable: The Life, Death, and Afterlife of the Notorious B.I.G.).\n\nDreamgirls is directed by Bill Condon from a screenplay he adapted from the stage musical's original book by Tom Eyen. Condon (Oscar® winner for his screenplay for Gods and Monsters, which he also directed) received another Oscar® nomination for his screenplay adaptation of Chicago. He more recently wrote and directed Kinsey.\n\nDavid James's photographs previously appeared in the moviebooks of Memoirs of a Geisha, Chicago, and Saving Private Ryan.\n\nDreamgirls is directed by Bill Condon from a screenplay he adapted from the stage musical's original book by Tom Eyen.
