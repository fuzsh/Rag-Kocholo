        "text": "To say that Dreamgirls is the best musical so far this century is to make no great claim for it. To say that it's the best film about the music business since Allison Anders's 1996 Grace of My Heart and fit to be spoken of in the same breath says more. Anders's movie was a lightly fictionalised biopic of singer and songwriter Carole King and her circle of musicians who worked in the celebrated Brill Building near Times Square from the late Fifties to the early Seventies. It dealt with a period of cultural change in which Tin Pan Alley composers gave way to rock bands who wrote their own stuff, an era which saw the rise of the concept album, girl bands and the use of psychedelic drugs.\n\nDreamgirls deals with the same period and similar issues from a black perspective, that of the musicians who started out with Berry Gordy's Tamla Motown label. Gordy established his company in 1959 and it created a new kind of black sound that appealed to a steadily widening audience, going far beyond a minority ethnic appeal. It turned Detroit, for a while at least, into one of the hottest, most influential pop centres in the world.\n\nThe movie is written and directed by Bill Condon, who scripted the last substantial Hollywood musical, Chicago, and showed his flair for locating cine-biographies in a revealing historical context with bold studies of gay movie director James Whale (Gods and Monsters) and sexologist Alfred Kinsey (Kinsey).\n\nBehind his film, however, there is the figure of the late Michael Bennett, who worked with Stephen Sondheim and Harold Prince on Company and Follies and conceived A Chorus Line. In 1981, he directed and choreographed Dreamgirls on Broadway, and although the book and lyrics are by Tom Eyen, and Henry Krieger wrote the music, this production was generally regarded as Bennett's work. Sadly, the show never came to Britain.\n\nThe New York Times theatre critic, Frank Rich, no pushover, wrote that Bennett 'keeps Dreamgirls in constant motion - in every conceivable direction - to perfect his special brand of cinematic stage effects [montage, dissolves, wipes] ... throughout the show, Mr Bennett uses shadows, klieg lights, background figures and eerie silhouettes to maintain the constant tension'.\n\nCondon has tried for a similar dynamic sweep and for a lot of the time he succeeds. He rushes us through the years as his characters start out in Detroit, where their roots remain, and proceed to flit around the country, with Los Angeles and Vegas becoming their chosen professional home. The movie is essentially the story of Diana Ross and the Supremes, presented as a portrait of Deena Jones and the Dreams, who start out as a backing trio to the volatile black rocker James 'Thunder' Early (Eddie Murphy), a character evidently inspired by James Brown, before becoming a single act. The movie is about ambition and self-fulfilment, commercial imperatives and authentic black music and selling out for money and fame as opposed to standing up for integrity and self-expression.\n\nThe chief manipulator is Curtis Taylor (Jamie Foxx), a suave, black businessman in Detroit who switches from selling cars to peddling stars and coolly steers the working-class black girls into becoming crossover performers for white audiences. There's an acute scene when Taylor gets a booking for them at a smart Miami nightspot, the first black artists to appear there, and they're introduced to a largely unappreciative white audience by a patronising, racist Jewish master of ceremonies.\n\nAlthough buxom Effie (Jennifer Hudson) is his lover, the businessman promotes the slim Deena (Beyonce Knowles) in her place and marries her. Deena, like Diana Ross, is beautiful and slim, but has a much narrower vocal range than Effie.\n\nTough, uncompromising Effie angrily retreats to her old world in the Detroit ghetto and becomes a single mother, painfully retaining her integrity as the Dreams go on to world fame. Very soon, in one of those familiar Hollywood montages, the Dreams are on the cover of Time, Life and Newsweek\n\nMeanwhile, James Early struggles to keep the faith as a politically committed soul singer. It's familiar stuff, but handled with immense panache and there are strong theatrical moments such as Effie walking angrily out of a recording studio at night only to find herself on the streets during the 1967 Detroit riots.\n\nMost of the numbers are performed on the stages of theatres, nightclubs and on TV, and the girls strutting their stuff, their three pairs of wiggling buttocks filling the wide screen, is a sight to behold. The first song not to be sung as part of an act or in a studio doesn't come until around 45 minutes into the film and, like all the dramatic numbers, it's a song of anxiety, pain, doubt and rejection. It is always easy, however, to distinguish between the determinedly commercial music that Deena's Svengali promotes and the authentic black soul music the film presents as a countervailing artistic force.\n\nEddie Murphy's James Early is the best thing he has done for more than 20 years - since 48 Hrs. and Trading Places - with a maturity and depth of feeling he's rarely shown before. Beyonce is an entrancing presence, but the movie's big discovery is Jennifer Hudson as honest, uncompromising Effie. She's marvellous, yet her name appears in small, almost illegible print on the posters."
