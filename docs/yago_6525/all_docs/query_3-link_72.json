        "text": "Universal's upcoming Bride of Frankenstein movie remake may have found its director in Bill Condon.\n\nAccording to Deadline, Condon is currently in \"early talks\" with the studio and both parties are excited about the potential collaboration.\n\nIn addition to directing Disney's live-action Beauty and the Beast, which crossed the $1 billion mark at the worldwide box office earlier this week, Condon helmed Twilight: Breaking Dawn Part 1 and Part 2.\n\nThe director has made it known previously that he's a big fan of director James Whale's original Bride of Frankenstein. In fact, Condon is believed to have included a nod to the classic 1935 monster movie in Breaking Dawn Part 1, with the inclusion of a scene where someone revives another and saves her life by turning her into a monster.\n\nBride of Frankenstein is part of the Universal Monsters shared universe, which also includes the upcoming remake of The Mummy. The Alex Kurtzman-directed film, which stars both Tom Cruise and Russell Crowe, opens in theaters on June 9."
