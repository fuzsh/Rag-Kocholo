        "text": "Dreamgirls, the film adaptation of the Tony Award–winning Broadway musical, turns 10 this Christmas. That means it has been a decade since we first witnessed Jennifer Hudson’s electric on-screen debut (fresh off American Idol), Beyoncé Knowles pre-Lemonade, and some seriously epic musical numbers—including Hudson’s showstopping rendition of “And I’m Telling You I’m Not Going.” The film went on to collect two SAGs, three Golden Globes, and two Academy Awards (despite being snubbed in the Best Picture category). Here’s a look at its stars, then and now."
