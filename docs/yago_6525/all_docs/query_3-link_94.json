        "text": "Checkout the full audio review at One Movie Punch!\n\nA brilliantly clever cat and mouse game with a powerhouse lead cast! For lovers of movies inspired by film noir style intrigue and deception, then you definitely need to see The Good Liar with Sir Ian McKellen and Helen Mirren. You will be completely wrapped up in two of the finest living actors having demonstrable fun playing off one another. I love to watch movies where it is clear that the actors are having a tremendously great time with their characters, yet staying committed to their respective characters the entire time. From the moment the film opens with the stylistic sequence of instant messages over a dating website, you are hooked in for an intellectually driven wild ride. Cat and Mouse games, Whodunits, and other intellectually driven thrillers are often some of the most difficult movies to review because so many details could easily be spoilers. There is perhaps no greater recent example of this tightrope I find ‘myself’ walking than with this clever film. Virtually everything about it from title to end credits could give way to spoiling the many surprises if not approached with the utmost care. As much as will try to avoid any spoilerific information, it is unavoidable with this film. So, if you are worried—pause—then go watch the movie. Yes, it’s a recommended watch if you are into intellectually driven cat and mouse thrillers.\n\n“The Good Liar” written by Jeffrey Hatcher and directed by Bill Condon is a sultry cat and mouse thriller starring two of Britain’s finest actors: Hellen Mirren as the widowed Betty McLeish and Sir Ian McKellen as the career con artist Roy Courtney. When Roy happens upon the online dating profile of Betty, he cannot believe his luck when he finds out that she is wealthy. Usually, Roy has no issues in swindling people, but he begins to dance a fine line between his personal feelings and the objective of his job when he begins to fall in love with Betty. As their relationship develops from platonic to something more, the complications and conflict give way to a treacherous game of wits.\n\nDon’t look to Condon’s more well-known and recent work on such films as “Beauty and the Beast, “The Greatest Showman,” or “Dreamgirls” to get a feel for his approach to this crime thriller. You need to look to his earlier work “Murder 101,” “Deadly Relations” (sounds like a Lifetime movie or Investigation Discovery series), or “The Man Who Wouldn’t Die” (which sounds an awful lot like a Hitchcock title. Looking to his more obscure films will reveal how he approached and directed “The Good Liar.” If you love a film with twists and turns at every corner, then you will undoubtedly love this movie. Early on, the audience realizes that nothing is at it seems, so that creates a fantastic atmosphere of intrigue that invites you to play along as you try to figure out what is really going on. Although on a conceptual level, you may figure out what is going on, the details will most assuredly escape you. And it’s those loose ends that will drive you crazy—in the best way possible. Until the big reveal at the end, in which is all makes sense.\n\nThe best thing about this movie is that the plot is incredibly believable. You’ll want to poke holes in plot, but you’ll have a tough time identifying a solid one. That is partly due to the magic of screenwriting: the characters will say or do something because it’s required at that specific time; however, it is played off as natural and unforced. I admire the tonal shifts from the lighthearted beginning to the rather dark material midway through and the increasingly macabre subject matter as the movie makes its way towards the climax. This movie will take you places that will completely blow your mind; however, I assure you that it works very well despite being reprehensible in nature. No plot device is ever used simply for shock value; everything has an intentional purpose and place. If for no other reason, you want to watch this movie for the two lead performances by Mirren and McKellen. Not that these performances are even in their top 10, but these actors are so much fun to watch, that you forgive the movie of its shortcomings.\n\nRotten Tomatoes lists The Good Liar at a 64; Metacritic a 55; IMDb a 6.5; One Movie Punch awards it with 6/10.

Director Bill Condon’s live-action remake of Beauty and the Beast, the first animated film nominated for Best Picture at the (1992) Academy Awards, is an extravagant display of visual effects and digital imagery necessary to animate a live-action motion picture. Essentially, he took an animated movie, made it live-action, just to make it animated again. Sure, this new version of the “song as old as rhyme” can certainly stand on its own and is demonstrably well-directed, but 2017’s Beauty and the Beast largely comes across as unnecessary. In terms of the storytelling (or diegesis), the film’s effort to nearly shot-for-shot translate the most memorable parts of the film from animation to live-action pays off nicely! It’s when the film tries to be different that it falls short in its delivery. There are sufficient moments that beautifully recreate that which caused you to fall in love with this movie more than two decades ago; although, with this version, you may find yourself exhausted and over-stimulated by the constant waves of computer-animated figures in a live-action world. Oh yeah, you’ll likely miss hearing the legendary Angela Lansbury as the iconic Mrs. Potts. The film does its very best to justify its existence, but begs the question whether or not this was the movie for which you were waiting.\n\nBelle (Emma Watson) is a young lady with a longing for adventure and a great big imagination, but she lives in a rather provincial French town. But, Belle is about to get more adventure than even she, in her wildest imagination could have dreamt. For through a series of strange circumstances, she finds herself trapped inside a dark foreboding castle, surrounded by a very odd collection of characters. It’s in this castle that she finds her father who she feared injured or dead imprisoned by a Beast (Dan Stevens). Against her father’s wishes, she reluctantly exchanges herself for her father’s release. After the Beast sets him free, Belle is to remain a permanent resident of the castle. Fearing the worst, Belle’s father seeks the help of the misogynistic village heartthrob Gaston (Luke Evans) and his band of goofs and thugs to rescue her. During this time, however, Belle begins to feel “something there that wasn’t there before” as she learns more about the Beast of the castle.\n\nCan this film stand on its own? Sure. There is no question in that. Moreover, is it enjoyable and magical? That, it is. But when most of the campaign, leading up to the highly anticipated release, was primarily built upon how similar the live-action film would be to its animated counterpart, therein a problem arises. Because most people going into the movie will have seen the animated version, Broadway show, or even the show at Disney’s Hollywood Studios (which, in full disclosure, is a show that I worked when I was a Cast Member at Walt Disney World), you are predisposed to looking for and eagerly awaiting the nostalgic references and memories. And there is nothing wrong with that. In fact, I was looking forward to reliving the experience of when I first saw the animated movie. For the most part, if you are like me, then you will be pleased with the live-action translation–truly. However, it’s when the live-action version departs from or adds in material not found or referenced in the animated classic that you may be disappointed or simply ask “why?” You may find yourself wondering why was a live-action remake even necessary?\n\nOne of the most memorable elements of Disney’s Beauty and the Beast (1991) is the music! Still to this day, millions of people love hearing the classic music and lyrics by Alan Menken and Howard Ashman. Both the Beauty and the Beast and Be Our Guest can be heard as part of other shows at Walt Disney World and of course are included in the stage show at Hollywood Studios. Fortunately, the most iconic songs from the animated version are largely untouched; however, with a couple of the songs, there are breaks for diegetic dancing, fighting, or other material that essentially interrupts the organic flow of the music from the buildup to the climax and denouement. Again, the question “why” will likely pop into your head. We are introduced to a few new songs, and in and of themselves, are beautiful! Every note and lyric has that Disney magic that many of us have come to expect and appreciate. Unfortunately, the songs just don’t fit in with the original numbers in terms of pacing, lyrics, and score. Furthermore, here’s something quite interesting and odd: the song [To Be] Human Again was written for but deleted when it originally hit theatres in 1991. It was, however, added back in for the Broadway show and in the 2010 (and Diamond Edition) re-release of the movie. Although it was seen as important enough to include in the Broadway show and add back into the animated version, it is conspicuously missing from the live-action remake.\n\nWith the exception of Emma Thompson replacing the legendary Angela Lansbury, the cast was well-selected and demonstrated excellent chemistry between one another. Although Emma Watson is not a singer by trade, she was able to capture a Belle-like essence in her delivery of the various songs throughout the film. There was something uniquely organic in her voice that is seldom captured by other Disney “princesses” (note: Belle is not a princess). I greatly appreciate the dynamic range of characters that Watson has demonstrated that she can play over the years. Dan Stevens wows audiences with his vocal prowess especially in his solo number as we transition from the second to third acts. I appreciate how he stuck a fantastic balance between his human and beast sides respectively. Luke Evans was a perfect choice for Gaston, and his vocal talent matches his muscles–big, bold, and flawless. The rest of the cast, which includes some A-list talent itself, was ideally suited for the enchanted objects in the castle and the village.\n\nOkay, now for the white elephant in the room: Josh Gad’s Lefou. Unless you have been completely disconnected from social media and the news, you’ve undoubtedly heard or read about the first ever Disney “gay moment” in this film. Suffice it to say, the whole thing has been blown way out of proportion. In fact, more attention is likely being paid to Lefou now than had the story never grown to the size of Gaston’s ego. For the most part, the subtext and subtitles of Lefou’s are largely just that–subtle–unless you are looking for them. But, in doing that, you may miss some of the more important and impressive parts of the movie. Moreover, there is nothing in Lefou’s actions that come across as offensive or obnoxious. Before audiences begin accusing Disney of pushing their ideals on those eager to attend this film, it is likely that the entertainment and media giant is simply delivering what audiences already expect or want. As a film and media professor, I can tell you that by in large, media simply delivers what audiences and investors are telling them to produce–not the other way around. Looking back at the animated film, it is pretty obvious that Lefou has a thing for Gaston anyway. Although most of the hints at his sexual orientation are more-or-less winks or nods at the audience (winks or nods that you have to be looking for), there is a moment that is a trifle more obvious at the end of the film. Diegetically, there is nothing bizarre about Lefou’s behavior and it suits his character well.\n\nPrepare to be whisked away to an enchanted castle in a remote part of France. So remote is this province in France, that most everyone speaks with a British accent. Bill Condon’s film will take you back to when you first saw this magical tale of falling in love with someone based upon what’s on the inside and not allowing a beastly outward appearance to detract from the gentle soul. Relive the music that you may still listen to in the car or eagerly look forward to when visiting the Disney Parks and Resorts. Ultimately, this film may not capture the magic of the original for you, but there is a lot to enjoy! Looking for a great date movie this weekend, then this is definitely it! Hopefully a side effect of this film may remind producers and audiences that some stories are better suited for an animated motion picture.\n\nWritten by R.L. Terry\n\nEdited by J.M.
