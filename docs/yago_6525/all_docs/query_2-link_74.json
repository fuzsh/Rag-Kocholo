        "text": "Christmas Day 2016 marks 10 years since the release of \"Dreamgirls,\" the film about a musical trio, the Dreamettes, who get the chance of a lifetime — and also learn the price of fame. From Jennifer Hudson and Jamie Foxx to Anika Noni Rose, Sharon Leal and more, Wonderwall.com is bringing you the latest on what the cast is up to now. Keep reading to find out!\n\nRELATED: Movie-musical couples\n\nJennifer Hudson won a Golden Globe Award, an Academy Award and a Screen Actors Guild Award for her performance as singer Effie White in \"Dreamgirls.\" Her powerful voice delivered \"And I Am Telling You,\" and that song has stuck with us all 10 years later. When Effie's love interest, record executive Curtis Taylor Jr., dropped her from the group, she was forced to reinvent herself and her career while raising their daughter, Magic. Effie's character was inspired by The Supremes member Florence Ballard.\n\nRELATED: Stars with an Oscar, Golden Globe and SAG Award for the same performance\n\nAfter \"Dreamgirls,\" Jennifer Hudson took on more film roles. The former \"American Idol\" contestant starred as Louise in the 2008 \"Sex and the City\" movie and played the title role in 2011's \"Winnie Mandela.\" In December 2016, she lent her voice to elephant Young Nana in \"Sing.\" She also made a name for herself on the small screen, starring as Veronica Moore on \"Smash\" and Michelle White on \"Empire.\" Most recently, J.Hud sang her heart out as Motormouth Maybelle on NBC's \"Hairspray Live.\" In 2008, the singer-actress suffered a crushing blow when her mother, brother and young nephew were murdered in her Chicago hometown; Jennifer's brother-in-law was convicted of their shooting deaths. The same year, she got engaged to Harvard Law graduate David Otunga, the father of her son, David Jr., who arrived in 2009. In 2010 and 2011, Jennifer made headlines for dropping 80 pounds as a Weight Watchers spokeswoman.\n\nRELATED: Celeb weight-loss transformations revealed\n\nBeyonce Knowles took on the part of Deena Jones in \"Dreamgirls.\" She replaced Effie White as the lead singer of the Dreamettes after Curtis Taylor Jr. decided to make her the star. The group became known as \"Deena Jones and the Dreams.\" She also went on to marry Curtis. The role of Deena was inspired by Diana Ross.\n\nSince 2006, Beyonce has accomplished a lot. She released four more albums — \"I Am… Sasha Fierce\" in 2008, \"4\" in 2011, \"Beyonce\" in 2013 and \"Lemonade\" in 2016. She leads the 2017 Grammy Awards with nine nominations. She dropped the cheating-and-forgiveness-themed \"Lemonade\" as a visual album on April 23, and it quickly became her sixth million-selling album. Her music career aside, Beyonce is also an adoring mother. She welcomed daughter Blue Ivy with husband Jay Z on Jan. 7, 2012, nearly four years after they married. Beyonce and Jay Z were also an unstoppable duo on their \"On the Run\" tour together in 2014. And in spite of intense divorce rumors, they're still going strong!\n\nJamie Foxx played Curtis Taylor Jr. in \"Dreamgirls.\" Curtis was a former car salesman who became a record executive at Rainbow Records. He dumped Effie White for Deena Jones and showed his true colors. The role of Curtis was inspired by Motown Founder Berry Gordy.\n\nJamie Foxx has starred in a number of popular films since \"Dreamgirls\" including \"The Soloist,\" \"Valentine's Day,\" \"Horrible Bosses\" and its sequel, \"Django Unchained,\" \"White House Down\" and \"The Amazing Spider-Man 2.\" He's also currently got several movies in the pipeline for 2017 and 2018 including \"Sleepless,\" \"Baby Driver\" and \"Robin Hood.\" As for his personal life, Jamie likes to keep it all a mystery. In August 2009, he welcomed a baby girl named Annalise with an ex but has kept the mother's name a secret. Rumors suggest that Jamie has been dating Katie Holmes since 2013. In December 2016, the super-private couple reportedly went to Cabo San Lucas together to celebrate Katie's birthday.\n\nEddie Murphy was Jimmy \"Thunder\" Early in \"Dreamgirls.\" Jimmy was signed to the Rainbow label and the Dreamettes performed as his backup singers. He also had an affair with Dreamette singer Lorrell Maya Robinson. But life was not all rainbows for Jimmy. When his stardom began to diminish, he relied on drugs. This role was inspired by R&B and soul singers including James Brown, Jackie Wilson and Marvin Gaye. For Eddie's riveting portrayal of Jimmy, he received a Golden Globe Award.\n\nAfter \"Dreamgirls,\" Eddie Murphy continued to voice the part of Donkey in the \"Shrek\" sequels including \"Shrek the Third,\" \"Shrek the Halls\" and \"Shrek Forever After.\" He also appeared in \"Tower Heist,\" \"A Thousand Words\" and \"Mr. Church.\" Coming up, Eddie will reprise his role as Axel Foley in \"Beverly Hills Cop 4,\" and he will also star as LeRoy Pryor in \"Richard Pryor: Is It Something I Said?\" His personal life has been dramatic too: A DNA test confirmed that Eddie was the father of Spice Girl Melanie Brown's baby girl Angel, who was born on April 3, 2007. In January 2008, Eddie married Tracey Edmonds but it turns out it was just a \"symbolic union,\" which was for the best considering they split two weeks later. Four years after that, Eddie began dating model Paige Butcher. On May 3, 2016, Paige gave birth to their daughter, Izzy, who is Eddie's ninth child.\n\nAnika Noni Rose played the third Dreamette, Lorrell Maya Robinson. She fell in love with Jimmy \"Thunder\" Early and became his mistress. The character of Lorrell was inspired by The Supremes' Mary Wilson.\n\nAfter \"Dreamgirls,\" Broadway actress Anika Noni Rose's star continued to rise. She played Yasmine in \"For Colored Girls.\" She also lent her voice to Princess Tiana for Disney's \"The Princess and the Frog\" in 2009. Anika took her acting skills to television too. She was Lavender on \"The Starter Wife,\" Grace Makutsi on \"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency,\" Corinne Bennett on \"Private Practice,\" Wendy Scott-Carr on \"The Good Wife,\" Special Agent Liz Babbitt on \"The Bates Motel,\" Kizzy in \"Roots\" and, most recently, Jukebox on \"Power.\" She returned to Broadway in 2014 as Beneatha Younger in the revival of \"A Raisin in the Sun.\" As for her private life, Anika has managed to keep things just that — private.\n\nKeith Robinson played C.C. White, Effie White's younger brother and the main songwriter for the Dreamettes. His character was inspired by Smokey Robinson.\n\nAround this time of year, you may recognize Keith Robinson as Devean Brooks from the holiday film \"This Christmas.\" Keith also took on roles in romantic films including \"24 Hour Love,\" \"Forbidden Woman\" and \"Four Seasons.\" On TV, he starred as Chester in \"Canterbury's Law.\" Most recently, he played Miles on \"Saints & Sinners.\" Although he's no stranger to playing a man in love, Keith has kept his romantic life private.\n\nSharon Leal starred as Michelle Morris in \"Dreamgirls.\" She was Curtis Taylor Jr.'s secretary who became one of the singers with Deena and the Dreams following Effie's dismissal. Michelle was also dating Effie's brother C.C. White, so things between her and Effie got pretty tense. The character was inspired by The Supremes member Cindy Birdsong.\n\nSharon Leal teamed up with Keith Robinson again in \"This Christmas\" to play the part of Kelli Whitfield. A few years later, she landed the role of Dianne in the Tyler Perry production \"Why Did I Get Married?\" And although she wasn't on \"Private Practice\" at the same time as fellow \"Dreamgirls\" star Anika Noni Rose, Sharon was also on the series as Sonya Nichols. Her most recent TV roles include parts on \"Supergirl,\" \"Grimm\" and \"Recovery Road.\" In 2016, she starred in the movie \"No Regrets.\" As for her personal life, Sharon has a son, Kai, with ex-husband Bev Land. She's been linked to choreographer/dancer Paul Becker since 2011.\n\nDanny Glover played Marty Madison in \"Dreamgirls.\" Marty was Jimmy \"Thunder\" Early's original manager before Curtis Taylor Jr. entered the picture. When Effie White needed to restart her music career, she went to Marty.\n\nDanny Glover has had a very successful acting career, and he's not slowing down. After \"Dreamgirls,\" he appeared in \"Poor Boy's Game,\" \"2012,\" \"Dear Alice\" and \"Legendary\"… just to name a few. Most recently, audiences saw Danny in the 2016 holiday film \"Almost Christmas.\" If you need a laugh, he was also in \"Dirty Grandpa\" as a character named Stinky. Danny hasn't shied away from the small screen either. He appeared on \"Brothers & Sisters\" and \"Touch.\" 2017 looks like it will be a big one for Danny, who has four more movies in production. As for his personal life, the 70-year-old is still married to a woman who is 20 years his junior. Danny met Eliane Cavalleiro in 2003, and they tied the knot in 2009. He shares daughter Mandisa, 40, with ex-wife Asake Bomani."
