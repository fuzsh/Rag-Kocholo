        "text": "Bill Condon is an accomplished American film director and screenwriter with a career spanning more than three decades. Born in New York City in 1955, Condon graduated with a degree in philosophy from Columbia University in 1976. He then pursued his passion for cinema and moved to Los Angeles, where he began his career in the film industry.\n\nCondon started off as a writer for television, writing scripts for various popular shows such as “The Twilight Zone” and “Murder, She Wrote.” He eventually moved onto film and made his directorial debut with the 1987 horror movie, “Strange Behavior.”\n\nCondon’s big break came in 1998 when he directed and wrote the screenplay for the biographical film “Gods and Monsters,” for which he won an Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay. His subsequent films, including “Chicago,” “Kinsey,” “Dreamgirls,” and “The Fifth Estate,” were also met with critical and commercial success.\n\nIn addition to his film work, Condon has also made a name for himself in the theater world. His musical adaptation of the film “Billy Elliot” premiered in London’s West End in 2005 and went on to win numerous awards, including ten Tony Awards for its Broadway production.\n\nCondon is known for his ability to tell compelling stories that highlight the complexities of human nature. He is a master of blending drama, comedy, and music to create distinct and memorable films. His precise attention to detail and skillful direction have led to numerous accolades throughout his career.\n\nToday, Condon continues to be a prominent figure in the film industry, working on various projects across different genres. His upcoming film, “The Good Liar,” starring Helen Mirren and Ian McKellen, is set to be released in 2019."
