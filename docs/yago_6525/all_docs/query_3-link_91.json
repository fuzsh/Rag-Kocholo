        "text": "Right about now, director Bill Condon knows a great deal about the desire to escape. He’s sitting in the middle of a standard-issue conference room in a Toronto hotel. The director of “Kinsey,” “Dreamgirls” and “The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn” parts 1 and 2 has got a lingering cough that makes his interviewer feel like a sadist.\n\nThis is the final sit-down of a Toronto Film Fest junket day for “The Fifth Estate,” starring Benedict Cumberbatch as WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange. The drama joins a number of fall films that suggest that the only way to escape our present-day predicaments is to plunge headlong into them in a dark theater.\n\nQ: “Escapism” isn’t the right word, but what is it you think we do when we go to a movie this engaged with our moment that nevertheless puts us in another space?\n\nA: Journalism exists in a lot of forms, and entertainment exists in a lot of forms. But entertainment seems to be the pill that we all need in order to consume other stuff. A movie like this can help you escape into reality in a way that you wouldn’t want to embrace if it were handed to you in a more traditional way.\n\nQ: The movie made me feel, “OK, let me get back into the fray. Let me read about Edward Snowden.”\n\nA: I do think movies can do that. Suddenly you’re attuned in a different way to things. That’s what has been fascinating for me: to be immersed in the movie and then look up from the Avid (editing machine) and see Edward Snowden. I felt very privileged, because it was the rare news story I could follow and feel as though I could see it in a different way.\n\nQ: Did you ever feel overwhelmed by the material?\n\nA: Yes, especially in the editing of the movie. Because taking that and making it lucid was a tough job. It was a constant reshaping and figuring out. Can you just spend two minutes in Kenya? It was constant.\n\nQ: How did you decide on the way you depicted that the action was online?\n\nA: Most people don’t want to feel like they have to renew their library card before they step into a movie theater. But at the same time, 30 years ago, we would have had a serious conversation about nobody reading, now everybody reads. It’s one of the great things about the Internet. They may not be reading the most interesting things, but they’re reading and they are writing.\n\nQ: Listen to you all hopeful.\n\nA: You don’t go to movies to read. But now because that has become part of our experience, you can get away with, in this case, a four-minute sequence where Julian is on a plane and they’re having the most heated conversation in the movie, and you’re reading it, you’re not hearing it.\n\nQ: Do you feel empathy for Assange?\n\nA: I feel tremendous empathy for him. He’s got this fully formed world view that is very austere. He really did abstract himself from the world. I think there’s a tremendous loneliness to that. As somebody who spent part of his childhood on the run and has remained as peripatetic as he is, the idea that he’s spent three years now holed up in one or two places seems unbelievably cruel.\n\nQ: It makes it Greek tragedy territory.\n\nA: It really does.\n\nLisa Kennedy: 303-954-1567, lkennedy@denverpost.com or twitter.com/bylisakennedy"
