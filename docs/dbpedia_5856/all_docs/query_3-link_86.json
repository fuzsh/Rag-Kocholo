        "text": "Transcripts\n\nTo secure a transcript, students must complete a Transcript Request Form. The quickest and most convenient way to request a transcript is to order it online via the Web. The college has authorized Credentials Inc. to accept transcript orders over the Internet. In addition, transcripts can also be requested in person at the Registrarâ€™s Office or by submitting a request by mail. For details, visit the Transcripts website at www.hostos.cuny.edu/oor/transcripts. A $7.00 fee is charged for each transcript. The fee is waived for transcripts sent to units of The City University of New York.\n\nTranscripts, whether for transfer, employment, or any other reason, are never sent automatically. Students ordering over the internet should allow two to three business days (excluding weekends and holidays) to process the transcript request. Requests for transcripts via the U.S. mail system or in person will take longer to process. Each transcript must be specifically requested as a separate request in order to safeguard the privacy of each student's official records from unauthorized review. Official transcripts bear the College seal and signature of the Registrar, and are not issued to students or alumni. For additional information relating to transcript requests kindly email: transcripts@hostos.cuny.edu"
