        "text": "CUNY EDGE\n\nCUNY EDGE, formerly known as the COPE program, is a partnership between the New York City Human Resources Administration (HRA) and the University. Matriculated CUNY undergraduate students who receive cash assistance from HRA are eligible to participate in CUNY EDGE. CUNY EDGE provides students with a range of services, benefits, and supports to help them succeed in college and in their careers.\n\nCUNY EDGE provides individualized academic, personal, and career planning support. The program encourages consistent enrollment in courses each semester and enrollment in intersession classes, as needed. CUNY EDGE also connects students to work opportunities while in school and provides career development services for job placement after graduation. Advisors and other staff members lead a personal and professional development seminar series each semester to assist students with goal-setting, career development, and self-advocacy. CUNY EDGE works with other college offices to best support student members.\n\nCUNY EDGE Fellowship Program\n\nCUNY EDGE in collaboration with the HRA additionally offers a Fellowship Program, which provides student members with a limited number of paid work opportunities. HRA determines eligibility and the number of hours each student is assigned. CUNY EDGE staff identifies available work opportunities on campus and matches students to appropriate sites, taking into consideration their majors, interests, and experience. Students, therefore, earn the opportunity to gain invaluable experience and build their resumes.\n\nThe mission of CUNY EDGE is:\n\nTo help CUNY students who are receiving public assistance achieve academic excellence, graduate on time, and secure employment.\n\nFor more information, please contact Veronica Vidal, Director, at (718) 518-4363 or Jennifer Williams, Advisor at (718) 518-4337. For general inquiries, you may also contact the CUNY EDGE Main Office at (718) 518-4363."
