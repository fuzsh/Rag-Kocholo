        "text": "Hostos Community College offers the Associate in Science (A.S.) degree in Civil Engineering as a jointly registered, dual admission program with the existing Bachelor of Engineering in Civil Engineering (B.E./C.E.) at the City College of New York. The program has been designed to meet the licensure guidelines of the Accreditation Board of Engineering and Technology (ABET).\n\nThis program is designed to provide HCC students with the same curriculum as the first two years of the licensure qualifying Civil Engineering program required at CCNY. The collegial nature of the program will facilitate the transition to the professional portion of the curriculum.\n\nHCC students will be enrolled in the existing Science and Mathematics courses at Hostos and will be given permit to enroll in the eight Engineering courses at CCNY until such time as there is sufficient enrollment to offer the course(s) at Hostos."
