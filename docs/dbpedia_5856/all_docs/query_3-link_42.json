        "text": "July 29, 2022\n\nThis philosophical book, published in 1888, results from Hostos's classes during his stay in Santo Domingo from 1880 to 1888. In this treatise on morality, Hostos exposes his original conception of ethics in the relations of human beings with society. Moral Social comprises 38 chapters divided into two sections: 1) Relationships and Duties and 2) Morals and Activities of Life. In the first, the author presents the theoretical bases on which his ideas are based. In the second, he applies those ideas to concrete cases and makes moral suggestions for him. According to his ideas, there is a moral existence very different from physical presence, which, although not different, manifests itself to us in different ways. Thus, Hostos concludes, \"Every proceeding from reason from less to more is proceeding from less conscience to more conscience, and instead of becoming more conscientious as he becomes more rational, the man of our civilization becomes eviler the more he knows evil.\" I give it four stars out of 5."
