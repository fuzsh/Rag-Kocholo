        "text": "Hostos Community College offers the Associate in Science (A.S.) degree in Electrical Engineering Science as a jointly registered, dual admission program with the existing Bachelor of Engineering in Electrical Engineering (B.E./E.E.) at the City College of New York.\n\nThe program has been designed to meet the licensure guidelines of the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET). The program will provide HCC students with the same curriculum as the first two years of the licensure qualifying electrical engineering program required at CCNY. Upon successful completion of the lower division at HCC students will have a seamless transition to the upper division of the baccalaureate program at CCNY. The collegial nature of the program will facilitate the transition to the professional portion of the curriculum. Electrical Engineering Science students will enroll in the existing science and mathematics courses at Hostos and will enroll in the two engineering courses at CCNY."
