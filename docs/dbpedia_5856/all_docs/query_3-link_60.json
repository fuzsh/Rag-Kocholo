        "text": "Recently, it has become more clear to me that there are probably two major divides in the working sector's mindsets: There are those who work to live, and those who live to work. There is another, smaller set of folks who can be a model for a good number of those at the fringes of these two. They are those who live in balance, who love what they do and who love their time away. These are the ones who get it. I supervise a group of people, most of whom work to live. If you asked them whether, if they were allowed, they would work fewer hours if they could make the same money, 99% of them would say yes. That matters, and in this day and age, we really need to be rethinking work/life balance. Some of us have fallen in love with a career, and we have driven ourselves onward in the face of adversity, exhaustion and at times diminishing returns on our investment of time. Some, like me, left the career of their passion due to frustrations that go hand-in-hand with the above negatives. However, those of us who are of this sort often tend to carry the same energy (and the concomitant willingness to sacrifice our personal lives for the possibility of attaining something great in the workplace) into any workplace we enter. Lately, I have been thinking a great deal about living in the present moment, finding joy in what is at hand, and I realize more clearly that there truly has to be a balance between one's work life and the time one has to reflect, recuperate and redirect the course one is taking. My point? If you are living to work and not finding a reward that transcends mere financial recompense; if you find yourself soul-weary at the end of your workweek, requiring a full day to restore internal balance; if you are not seeing friends and family and connecting to your history, it may be time for change. Life is finite. None of us owe anyone our everything. Each of us deserves to feel satisfaction and to be at peace. Life is much more than work, and work should enhance life rather than marginalize it. As Ken Robinson said, we should find our element. I'd add that we should find time to evaluate our element, because soon enough, we all become dust, and dust should not be anyone's element.\n\nContinued from today's earlier post. Training became the more usual circus once I joined the charter school segment of education. The school I worked for was run by businessfolk, economists, bean counters, and it quickly removed the only visionary principal we ever had, replacing him with lackeys and self-congratulating sycophants. Training became meaningless, a bloated list of boxes to be checked off by people who didn't care. In-service could have been replaced with \"indentured servitude,\" and anyone looking around during training would notice how many people were on their phones, who took so many extended bathroom breaks that the \"head of school\" had to threaten them with punishment, and who couldn't have told you the difference between ADA and IDEA without Google even immediately after special education training. I asked for funding to attend education conferences and was denied, so when Ken Robinson was headlining the ASCD conference, I paid out of pocket (on what we all know was a not great teacher's salary) to go to listen to and meet the great man. Daniel Pink and Jane McGonigal were other stars whom I was fortunate to see there. I spent my last year in education working in the private sector for a Montessori school. Faculty training was not much better, but at least they paid for continuing education and pushed teachers to obtain Montessori certifications, and I was fortunate to do several of my trainings with Montessori stars from Europe. That at least was refreshing. The gist of all of this is simple: If we expect our teachers to do great work in a field that is more important than any other, should we not be looking to inspire and invigorate them during training? Far, FAR too many administrators-even those who have been teachers-fall into the trap of \"do as I say, not as I do\" leadership, which is garbage. In-service should be vital. It should be vivid. It should set an example. It should be something teachers crave to attend and which they are loath to miss. I am writing a book on education. Stay tuned for more. To the teachers who continue doing the great work: Thank you on behalf of the universe. You are the people who build the doorway to the future in our youth, and the world owes you a massive debt of gratitude. Happy back to school!\n\nIt is the beginning of the school year for many teachers. It is a time when educators should be excited, refreshed, and looking forward to doing the greatest work on the planet. And yet for a majority, it is a time of dread, or at least of incipient boredom, two things that are anathema to great thinking. Why? Two good words, joined together with a hyphen to create the educational version of the Jabberwock: In-service Before I begin to dismantle what is wrong with this week or two of \"training\" which teachers must endure every year, I will say that, as a former faculty trainer, I have visions of this initial period of the year being something magical and inspiring, which is exactly how education itself should be. I'll get back to that at the end. Much of in-service training is built around statutory mandates, and so, no matter what, some things will have to be endured, such as special education, mandatory reporting, CPR, etc.. And yet, these things do not in and of themselves need to be mind-numbing topics to which no-one really pays attention. Another part of in-service, things like phone policies, bathroom policies, copier use, etc., are the stuff that could only excite those about to walk the Green Mile and whose interest in such could stay their execution. And then there are the gratuitous things administrators love to do, such as dumb ice breakers, long anecdotal stories, and jabbering on about their excitement and pride. Stuff that crap in a box and mail it to the district office with no return address, thank you. I started my career in education in Scottsdale under the best principal for whom I ever worked, Thea Andrade, and we were both under the best educational mentor we could ever have imagined, an assistant superintendent named John Weimer. Meetings were short, focused and tight. Training was intentional and to-the-point. The work was education, and we were out to do it justice. During those five and a half years, I met and interacted with great educational minds such as Howard Gardner, David Lazear and Eric Jensen. From there, I was fortunate to be asked to help open a magnet school of sorts for Gilbert under the guidance of Brian Rosta. An award-winning science teacher from Chicago, Brian never forgot what teaching was all about, and at that time, the district listened to its principals. District in-service training was also powerful, including sessions with luminaries such as Ray McNulty. To be continued"
