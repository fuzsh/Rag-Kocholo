        "text": "The CUNY Language Immersion Program (CLIP) offers college students the opportunity to study English intensively for up to 900 hours (approximately one year) before enrolling in college-level courses. The program also includes advisement, daily computer lab access, and college orientation workshops. Because language instruction is intensive (25 hours a week), students do not take additional college course work while they are attending the program.\n\nCLIP Highlights:\n\n路 Hostos CLIP is recommended for entering freshmen who have already been admitted to a CUNY college and have been placed into the program. CLIP is also for students who have not been successful in their college ESL courses (e.g., did not pass one semester of ESL at the community college level or failed the same ESL course two times at a senior college) with a referral from an academic advisor or professor.\n\n路 Students may choose a day or evening schedule. Classes meet Monday through Friday. Day classes meet from 9:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m. Evening classes meet from 5:00 p.m. to 10:00 p.m.\n\n路 Students can enroll in the program for up to 900 hours or for one semester (if placed in an advanced level). CLIP runs for 16 weeks in the Fall semester, 18 weeks in the Spring semester, and six weeks in the Summer semester.\n\n路 Students do not use their financial aid in CLIP. The cost of the program is $180.00 (Residents) and $450.00 (Non-Residents) in Fall or Spring, and $75.00 (Residents) and $180.00 (Non-Residents) in the Summer. Students on public assistance pay $45.00 for Fall or Spring, and $18.00 for the Summer. SEEK and College Discovery students pay $45.00 for Fall or Spring semester and $18.00 for Summer.\n\n(Please Note: Fees are subject to change.)"
