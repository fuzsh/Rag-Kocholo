        "text": "Radiologic Technology is the art and science of using ionizing radiation to provide images of the tissues, organs, bones, and vessels that comprise the human body. These images may be recorded using digital processes or displayed on a video monitor. Under the supervision of a licensed physician, the Radiologic Technologist is responsible for the production of these images and is an essential member of the health care team.\n\nHostos Community College’s Radiologic Technology Program is designed to provide students with the vital skills needed to use ionizing radiation as a means of determining the nature of disease or injury. Students participate in classroom lectures, demonstrations, activities in the department’s energized radiography laboratory and clinical practice experiences at affiliate hospitals in Manhattan and the Bronx. Additionally, learning adaptations using the college’s Black-Board learning management system provide students with interactive online modules that support student learning.\n\nStudents will be required to adhere to all regulations and policies as outlined in the Radiologic Technology Student Handbook. Clinical education commences in the Spring semester of the freshman year and continues throughout the six-semester program. The Radiologic Technology Program is accredited by The New York State Department of Health, Bureau of Environmental Radiation Protection, and The Joint Review Committee on Education in Radiologic Technology.\n\nProgram Mission Statement\n\nThe mission of the Radiologic Technology Program at Hostos Community College is to provide an educational experience that culminates in the production of a competent, entry-level professional radiologic technologist who can function effectively as a member of the health care team. The Radiologic Technology Program faculty believe that every student will be able to proficiently perform all routine radiographic procedures after completion of the program.\n\nProgram Goals and Student Outcomes:\n\nThe faculty and students of the Radiologic Technology Program consistently strive to achieve the following goals and student outcomes:\n\nGraduate students with the knowledge and skills necessary to perform radiographic procedures competently:\n\nStudents will be able to position patients properly.\n\nStudents will be able to apply the principles of radiation protection to patients, self and others.\n\nStudents will be able to formulate and compute appropriate technical exposure factors.\n\nStudents will be able to assess the patient’s needs and provide an optimal level of patient care.\n\nMaintain a high level of program effectiveness by graduating entry-level radiographers who will fulfill the needs of the health care community:\n\nGraduates will be adequately prepared to pass the ARRT examination.\n\nGraduates will find employment as radiographers within six months of program completion.\n\nGraduates will report a high level of satisfaction with program.\n\nEmployers will report a high level of satisfaction with graduates.\n\nThe program will achieve a satisfactory student retention rate.\n\nGraduate students who have the ability to demonstrate critical thinking and problem-solving skills to function effectively in the clinical setting:\n\nStudents will be able to modify routine procedures to accommodate patient conditions.\n\nStudents will be able to adapt exposure factors for various patient conditions.\n\nStudents will be able to recognize emergency conditions and initiate appropriate actions.\n\nGraduate students from a learning environment that encourages high ethical standards, professional development and growth:\n\nStudents/Graduates will demonstrate a high level of professional work ethics in the clinical setting.\n\nGraduates will exhibit professional development and growth through participation in professional organizations.\n\nGraduates will demonstrate professional development and growth by seeking advanced degrees and/or certifications.\n\nGraduate students who will be able to communicate effectively:\n\nStudents will communicate effectively with supervisors, technologist and patients\n\nStudents will communicate effectively through writing\n\nAcademic Program Planning\n\nThe following materials should be used as a guide to design your personal academic plan. Your specific program should be designed with the assistance of an academic advisor.\n\nPre-Requisite Course Sequence\n\nTo progress into the Radiologic Technology department’s pre-requisite phase of the program, students must meet the following criteria:"
