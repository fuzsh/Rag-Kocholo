        "text": "College Now\n\nCollege Now is a college transition and dual enrollment program in collaboration with the City University of New York (CUNY) and the New York City Department of Education (DOE). College Now prepares NYC public high school 11th and 12th graders for college success through over 14 CUNY three-credit pathway course offerings per semester from across all departments. The Hostos College Now program also offers a one-credit First Year Seminar course to high-achieving second-semester sophomore students.\n\nHostos College Now is partnered with over 60 South Bronx high schools and enrolls approximately 800 students each year. Hostos College Now cultivates a realistic college culture by offering the majority of courses on the Hostos Community College campus where students are taught by CUNY faculty and have access to computer labs, HALC, the library, dining, and other services. Hostos College Now aims to motivate and prepare students for the realities of higher education and beyond through college courses and career-connected opportunities. We reach this goal through skill-building workshops, internship opportunities, and our comprehensive summer programs. Students have the opportunity to earn up to 16 college credits through Hostos College Now before their high school graduation.\n\nThe Hostos College Now program also offers a number of pre-college opportunities.
