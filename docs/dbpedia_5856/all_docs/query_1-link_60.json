        "text": "Comprehensive Support and Improvement Schools (CSI): ESSA requires each State to develop a plan to identify schools for support and improvement. CSI schools must include at least the lowest-performing 5 percent of a Stateâ€™s Title I schools, as well as any high school - Title I or not - with an adjusted cohort graduation rate of 67 percent or less. CSI schools will be identified every three years, beginning fall 2018.\n\nSchools identified will begin a collaborative process - inclusive of State, Local Education Agencies (LEAs), schools, and their communities - to develop action plans and implement evidence-based programs for improvement. See attached for additional information.\n\nDownload Adobe Acrobat Reader\n\nTargeted Support and Improvement (TSI): ESSA requires each State to develop a plan to identify schools for support and improvement. TSI designations will function as an early warning system for at-risk student groups and as a signal to schools that may be at future risk for more intensive accountability cycles, such as CSI and ATSI. TSI designations apply to schools in which performance by one or more student groups falls at or below established thresholds drawn from the most recent single year of performance data. TSI schools will be identified every year beginning fall 2019.\n\nDownload Adobe Acrobat Reader"
