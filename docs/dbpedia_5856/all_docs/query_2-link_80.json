        "text": "Overview\n\nHostos Community College is centrally located at the bustling intersection of 149th Street and Grand Concourse, directly across the street from the Bronx General Post Office and a few short blocks from Lincoln Hospital. The pedestrian bridge that links the east and the west sides of our campus has become an icon for the College, as well as a major public space for students.\n\nWhen the College first opened in 1968, classes were held in a renovated tire factory at 475 Grand Concourse; by the mid-1970s, growing enrollments led to the purchase and renovation of an office building at 500 Grand Concourse. In the mid-1980s, a facilities master plan was developed, resulting in the construction of 450 Grand Concourse and the renovation and expansion of the original structure at 475 Grand Concourse.\n\nIn the 1990s, a new building at East 149th and Walton Avenue and an additional space at East 146th and Walton Avenue extended the campus westward along Walton Avenue. Pressed for space, the College has expanded further west, renting property at Bronx Terminal Market since 2012.\n\nThe majority of academic classes takes place in three buildings:\n\n· A Building (The Allied Health Building at 475 Grand Concourse) houses the library, science labs, nursing and x-ray technology labs, the President’s Offices, the Children’s Center and general classrooms.\n\n· B Building (500 Grand Concourse) is home to the college’s Dental Hygiene Clinic, the Admissions Office and Testing Center, Student Success Coaching Unit; English, Language & Cognition, Mathematics, and Behavioral & Social Sciences academic offices; the Office of Academic Affairs; Human Resources and Information Technology departments and general-purpose classrooms. The B Building is in the midst of a floor-by-floor phased renovation; a gut renovation of the 3rd Floor is fully designed and will go into construction once funding is released. A full replacement of the B Building’s windows was completed in the spring of 2020.\n\n· C Building (East Academic Complex at 450 Grand Concourse) houses the College’s two theaters (Main and Repertory), the Art Gallery, the Physical Education complex including pool, gymnasium and weight room; the cafeteria, Hostos Academic Learning Center (HALC); offices and specialized classrooms for the Humanities and Business & Accounting academic departments; Academic Advisement and Student Activities’ offices, general classrooms and computer labs.\n\n· D Building (Savoy Manor at 120 East 149th Street @ Walton Avenue) is home to student services including Registrar, Financial Aid, Career Services, and Accessibility Resource Center, Bursar and Business Offices; Student Development and Enrollment Management Offices and the Office of Institutional Advancement. The Multi-Purpose conference room is also located here.\n\n· G Building (135 East 146th Street @ Walton Avenue) houses the Office of Administration & Finance, Campus Facilities, Procurement and Accounts Payable.\n\n· Trailer Site 5 (427 Walton Avenue) is home to the Allied Health Pipeline program and the Hostos Immigration Center.\n\nHostos has rented property at the Bronx Terminal Market since 2012:\n\n· The Prow Building (560 Exterior Street) houses the administrative offices and classrooms for the college’s Continuing Education and Professional Studies programs.\n\n· The CLIP Building (590 Exterior Street) is home to the CUNY Language Immersion Program.\n\nIn 2012, a facilities master plan amendment was developed to guide the future development of our campus; it identified constant pressure for space and a need to renovate and reorganize existing facilities. The College has begun to implement the master plan amendment; one major step forward is the planning of a new Allied Health and Sciences Building Complex to be located at Walton Avenue between 144th and 146th Streets. The new building will house state-of-the-art science labs, a dental hygiene clinic providing services to the public, nursing simulation labs, x-ray technology teaching labs, and spacious classrooms.\n\nAdvisement Center 429 Grand Concourse\n\nThe college has been working with a private, non-profit developer to design and develop a new Advisement Center to be located on the 2nd floor of a 26-story affordable housing building on the site of the former PS 31. The Advisement Center will hold the ASAP and SSCU programs as well as ARC (Accessibility Resource Center). The Advisement Center will open in late Summer 2023."
