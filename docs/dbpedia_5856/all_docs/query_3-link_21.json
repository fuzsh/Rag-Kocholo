On the contrary, it sometimes seems that this power of well-worn notions and categories becomes more tyrannical as the tradition loses its living force and as the memory of its beginnings recedes.-Hannah Arendt, Between Past andFuture Our origins stem from the conquistadors and not the conquered.... We are Spaniards: give us the laws that apply in Spain. Destroy the here and there which poisons spirits and inflames sentiments.-Salvador Brau, Eeos de la batalla During the last decades of Spanish domination something new seemed to take place in Puerto Rico. Despite the subaltern condition of colonial life, an emerging group of intellectuals managed to establish a tradition of their own. Salvador Brau (1842-1912) and other hommes de lettres (among them Jose Julian Acosta, Manuel Alonso, Manuel Fernandez Juncos, and Manuel Zeno Gandia) sketched out the beginnings of a new intellectual and political life. They saw themselves as bearers ofa modem cultural identity, but they were fully aware of their marginality. Unlike Jose Marti, Eugenio Maria de Hostos, and other radical revolutionaries in exile, thesejournalists, politicians, doctors , and poets resisted identification with armed rebellion. Instead they demanded liberal, progressive reforms and seemed committed to mediate between modernization and imperialism. Brau placed himself at the center of a tradition that echoed throughout twentieth-century cultural and political discourse. In turnof -the-century Cuba and Puerto Rico a movement surfaced that ambiguously opposed metropolitan power and created new grids of identity and difference. The defenders of political autonomy hoped to resolve The Paradox of the /iutnrlOmista Tradition 105 the colonial problem from within the Spanish state. In spite of their loyalty to the metropolis and their opposition to violent rebellion, the autonomistas went further than any previous movement in favor of selfgovernment . They raised moral objections to the entire colonial project , took up the causes of reform, and established a tradition that became a center of political validation even for those who opposed it. Brau, Luis Munoz Rivera, Jose Celso Barbosa, Roman Baldorioty, and other liberals experienced both a variety of conflicts with respect to the Spanish metropolis and cultural and racial tensions in the colony. They shared with the Spaniards a profound sense of continuity, but they also had a sense of belonging to a new, distinctive, \"Puerto Rican\" people. Brau's writings reflect the ambivalence between painful awareness of colonial marginality and desire for unity with the Spanish nation. He wrestles with the advance and retreat of colonial coercion and gives voice to the anxieties of internal critics. Such contradictions and exclusions were experienced in the colony much more intensely than in the metropolis. Although not always expressed in writing, they were firmly established in the colonial consciousness. This essay examines some of Brau's texts and focuses on the meanings of autonomy that, in my judgment, emerge as an epistemology and a program deeply embedded in the social practices and colonial forms of institutionalization.l The definition of autonomista political and cultural tradition may be summarized as an affirmation of a nation without the state. The defense of a national project does not necessarily imply the creation ofan independent state; rather, it stands for stricter collaboration and common citizenship with the metropolis .2 In a parallel move, however, autonomistas systematically contested 1. I would like to thank Professor James Irby, Christopher Britt, and Dusan Djnric for their comments and suggestions on an earlier, Spanish version of this essay and for their assistance in the translation of Brau's texts quoted in it. I would also like to thank Chris Mazzara for his capable copyediting. 2. Concerning Bran and his work, as well as the Puerto Rican aulonomistas, see the following: Antonio S.
