        "text": "President's Message\n\nHello, and welcome back to Hostos Community College.\n\nOn June 29, 2015, I had the distinct pleasure of officially being named the seventh President of this wonderful institution. This new chapter in my life is not completely new, however, as I also worked at Hostos from 1974 to 1986 in various capacities.\n\nComing back to Hostos was very natural, because I have always believed in the power of community colleges. It is where I have spent 40 years of my career striving to make a difference. Hostos is a particularly special place, because it was born out of a real need in the South Bronx, and it has been serving the borough faithfully for nearly 50 years.\n\nI sincerely hope that you decide to return to Hostos, too, as there are a host of opportunities still available through our Alumni Relations Office. As an Hostos graduate, you are one of countless men and women who have left their mark on a variety of fields—the allied health sciences, technology, communications, education, business and industry, and others. Our Alumni Relations Office enables you to keep in touch with your former classmates, professors and staff. It also offers the opportunity for you to be a teacher by participating in our Alumni Speakers Bureau. There are also a host of services, including the use of the Hostos Library and Gymnasium, available to you through the Alumni ID Card, as well as career development assistance, employment placement, and other support services offered all over our growing campus.\n\nThese are exciting times at Hostos. The energy on campus, just like it was in the early days, is still vibrant and contagious. Hostos graduated its largest class to date in 2015, was named a Top 10 finalist for the prestigious Aspen Award for Community College Excellence, and even toasted two professors who earned New York State Professor of the Year awards in 2012 and 2014.\n\nBy staying connected to Hostos, you will remain part of something very special. You know because you have experienced it for yourself. Hostos was born out of the community. It will always be about the community. And that community includes you.\n\nWelcome back.\n\nDavid Gómez, Ed.D.\n\nPresident, Eugenio María de Hostos Community College"
