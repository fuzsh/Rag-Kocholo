The program costs $75 for the semester, including books and materials, and students do not use up any financial aid while in the program – leaving it for when they start college courses.\n\nStudents in the full-time program can take all needed subjects, while students in the part-time program focus on one subject (English or math). There are two opportunities within the same semester to meet CUNY college readiness standards. In addition, all students participate in a weekly college seminar and engage one-on-one with an advisor throughout the program. Students have access to Hostos resources and are well-prepared to enter the college upon completion.\n\nWho Is Eligible for CUNY Start?\n\nIncoming Hostos freshmen or transfer students who have not met CUNY proficiency standards.\n\nStudents who failed one or two semesters of remedial classes at Hostos\n\nWhen are classes?\n\nFall semester: August – January\n\nSpring semester: February – July\n\nFull-Time Program: 9-3pm Monday through Friday\n\nPart-Time Program: 2-5pm or 6-9pm Monday through Thursday\n\nHow do I apply to CUNY Start?\n\nPlease visit our website and submit an online application: www.hostos.cuny.edu/cunystart -or- visit or call:"
