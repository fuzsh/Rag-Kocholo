        "text": "March 14, 2023 / Blog Post\n\nI unequivocally accepted the challenge.\"\n\nCarlos F. Ramos-Hernandez /\n\n2022 Fellow\n\nIt was impressive, yet overwhelming, to witness up-close how theatrical and fast-paced [SCOTUS] oral arguments are.\"\n\nCarlos F. Ramos-Hernandez /\n\n2022 Fellow\n\nSCOTUS heard the argument on January 11, 2023, the same day that commemorates the birth of Puerto Rican educator, intellectual, and pro-independence leader, Eugenio María de Hostos. I kept thinking back to his teachings on defending human dignity and fostering solidarity among the opressed as I walked through the halls of the grandiose marbled stone building that sedes the United States’ highest court. It was exciting to present the culmination of months’ work and see powerhouse attorney Sarah Harris masterfully argue the case for CPI. It was impressive, yet overwhelming, to witness up-close how theatrical and fast-paced oral arguments are. While some Justices seemed interested in the stakes of the case, others were trying to dispose of it without resolving the issues.\n\nCPI has shown everyone that it will neither give up nor stop fighting for a more just and transparent Puerto Rico.\"\n\nCarlos F. Ramos-Hernandez /\n\n2022 Fellow\n\nAside from the thrill of the moment, I was also enraged by the fact that we had to be there. This undemocratic Board makes financial decisions that will adversely impact future generations and wants to keep operating in secrecy without any real accountability. There is no hiding the colonial nature of it all. Yet, as I reflect back on that day, I am proud that, no matter the forum, CPI has shown everyone that it will neither give up nor stop fighting for a more just and transparent Puerto Rico."
