        "text": "Overview\n\nThe Admissions and Recruitment Office at Hostos Community College encourages prospective students to meet with an admissions advisor regarding their higher educational goals. The advisor will help students examine their objectives and review admissions requirements, policies, and procedures.\n\nThe Application Process\n\nAll applicants must complete the appropriate City University of New York online application and provide the required documents, as specified below. Failure to file the correct application will delay admission processing and may subject students to disciplinary action by the university.\n\nThe priority application deadline for Fall is February 1, and Spring is September 15. Be sure to read the instructions carefully and submit all necessary documentation. We recommend visiting the www.cuny.edu/admissions webpage for updated freshman and transfer application process details. International students can meet with an Admissions Advisor and file their online application. However, they must mail their application fee (if they did not pay by debit/credit card), official transcripts, and translations (when applicable) directly to the University Application Processing Center (UAPC).\n\nFreshmen Admission\n\nCUNY/UAPC\n\nP.O. Box 350136\n\nBrooklyn, NY 11235-0001\n\nTransfer Admission\n\nCUNY/UAPC\n\nP.O. Box 350145\n\nBrooklyn, NY 11235-9023\n\nPlease note that all materials and documents (including original documents) submitted as part of an application for admission become the property of CUNY/UAPC and cannot be returned."
