Un’anno segnato da pietre miliari per il Campus del Friuli Centre. Ventesimo anniversario del Friuli Terrace, ed il primo lustro dall`aperture della <strong>Villa</strong> <strong>Leonardo</strong> <strong>Gambin</strong>. Tutto sommato, scontando le cose non tanto piacevoli, un`anno carico di eventi che per forza devono instillare un senso di gioia e di fierezza nel cuore di ogni Friulano membro della Famee. Anche se qualcuno vuole girarla in modi diversi, tutto quello che sorge a Friuli Court e Islington Ave. si e` sviluppato e preso forma dalle mani dal cuore, e dal contributo dei membri della Famee. We should rejoice in <strong>the</strong> fact that we are well organized and active participants in <strong>the</strong> life of <strong>the</strong> community that surrounds us and we were able to give back to that same community in many different ways. The Famee Furlane Toronto has a leadership position amongst <strong>the</strong> 200 plus Fogolars and Fameis around <strong>the</strong> world. We should not forget that, and consequently act as leaders in maintaining our culture and traditions, but also integrating and working with <strong>the</strong> community where we live and work. In <strong>the</strong> spirit of Christmas let us look forward and focus on <strong>the</strong> positive aspects of our Club. In 1999 we were awaiting with trepidation <strong>the</strong> turn of <strong>the</strong> Century, fearing that all kinds of bad things were to take place around us. Ten years later <strong>the</strong> \"Hearth\" is still turning <strong>the</strong> right way, <strong>the</strong> Famee is still here and functioning. You and I are still around. Considering all <strong>the</strong>se positives, I wish for all of you and your families “Un Buon Natale e Prospero Anno Nuovo”. Mandi Luigi <strong>Gambin</strong> President, Famee Furlane Toronto The Holiday Season...A Time of Thanks and Celebration Dear Friends, Festive Season is once again upon us and celebration and good cheer abound. On behalf of <strong>the</strong> residents, volunteers, care delivery team and <strong>Charity</strong> Board, it is a pleasure to wish you and your loved ones a Happy Holiday Season and a new year filled with an abundance of joy As <strong>2009</strong> draws to a close, we reflect on <strong>the</strong> year that has past. In October, <strong>the</strong> residence joyfully celebrated our fifth anniversary. Many thanks to <strong>the</strong> community partners that have contributed to this major milestone over <strong>the</strong> past years and thankfully continue to support <strong>Villa</strong> <strong>Leonardo</strong> <strong>Gambin</strong>’s mission of being a residence of choice within <strong>the</strong> Greater Toronto Area. To attain this lofty goal, multiple objectives need to be achieved, among <strong>the</strong>m: provide long term care that not only meets but exceeds standards; be cognizant of <strong>the</strong> needs of residents and families alike; and infuse a culture of empathy and respect between staff and those in which we have been entrusted to care, our one hundred and sixty-eight seniors and adults with special needs. The future is also bright for <strong>Villa</strong> <strong>Leonardo</strong> <strong>Gambin</strong>. The announcement of <strong>the</strong> next phase in <strong>the</strong> story of <strong>the</strong> residence occurred through <strong>the</strong> declaration of its renovation to be undertaken next spring. The renovations will be focused on <strong>the</strong> first floor common areas and will include: an expanded reception area; conversion of <strong>the</strong> existing courtyard to multi-use interior space; and <strong>the</strong> construction of a new exterior courtyard. Our community has been blessed with much. Our most precious blessings continue to be our residents - <strong>the</strong> special people who call <strong>Villa</strong> Leonard <strong>Gambin</strong> home and brighten our every day. The <strong>Charity</strong> is most thankful for <strong>the</strong> unwavering support of its many donors and volunteers who tirelessly give of <strong>the</strong>mselves to improve <strong>the</strong> quality of life of our residents. We are blessed with a care delivery team dedicated to enhancing <strong>the</strong> well being of seniors and adults with special needs. Collectively, <strong>the</strong> entire <strong>Villa</strong> <strong>Leonardo</strong> <strong>Gambin</strong> family embraces a celebration by appreciating every day, every occurrence and everyone that touches our lives.
