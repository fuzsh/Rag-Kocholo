The good news is that we have quite a bit of it. They aren’t full episodes, but they are pretty decent chunks out of both the day of and the day before. They focus on the Coopers, Gush, and Natalia and Gus — which as the show was written then this was probably most of the show. Also on the positive side we get a decent look at Jude Bauer and Zach Spaulding which we normally don’t. Sadly Jude is the only Bauer we will see at Thanksgiving this year — which again is typical of the show during this time. Also, Buzz gives a fairly nice Thanksgiving dinner speech continuing that tradition.\n\nOn the negative side this is 2007. While the cast and acting remained top notch, the writing was the worst ever for Guiding Light…until 2008 which then took the honor. Not that there wasn’t some good stuff particularly in some of the pairing up of some of the couples, but look at this mess. Gus and Harley are divorcing not only not because they want to, but because HARLEY told Gus he needed to go marry Natalia to make things up to Rafe because you certainly can’t father a boy if you aren’t married to his mother – face palm. Then they don’t know where anyone is going for Thanksgiving the day before so no one knows how many places to serve (when it takes 4-5 days to defrost a turkey) -face palm. Nobody gives anybody any warning about whether they are accepting an invitation or not and just why does Gus go to Harley’s BEFORE eating with Natalia when he specifically said twice he was going there AFTER. It’s just a mess start to finish. It kind of makes you glad that Manny was out of these writer’s clutches. And just what was Rafe’s problem with the manager at Towers. He didn’t ask Natalia to do one thing that was normally expected of a waitress and of course she was busy not many people wanted to work and more – apparently clueless – people wanted to eat out – just like in real life. I never did figure out the Alan-Rafe-Natalia dynamic. I don’t think Alan is actually thinking of romancing Natalia – although it isn’t really clear and not unheard of for Alan to go after one of the mothers of his grandchildren – I THINK he’s trying to get them in position so Rafe can be his latest golden haired (irony intended) heir.\n\nNovember 20, 2007\n\nGus asked Rafe and Natalia to have Thanksgiving with him at Towers. Alan had also asked Rafe and Natalia to come to the Spaulding Mansion. Harley asks Gus to attend Thanksgiving at her house. Gus and Harley are divorcing, but mostly to give Gus a chance to build a family with Natalia for Rafe. It was Harley’s idea, but Gus is going along with it.\n\nApparently things still haven’t been settled about Thanksgiving even though the turkeys should have been thawing for days now. After he gets an invite from Harley, Gus informs Rafe and Natalia that after their Thanksgiving dinner at Towers he’s heading over to Harley’s to see the boys. Rafe takes offense at this feeling his mother is getting the short change again – which she is, but she’s the one trying to have a romantic relationship with Gus when he clearly has no real interest in anything other than making things up to Rafe – so if she wants him she’s got to expect crap like this. Natalia gets a call in to work triple time for work so they’ll eat at supper time instead of at noon. Alan finds out via a message he’s supposed to pass on to Gus that Natalia and Rafe aren’t eating with him after all. Natalia didn’t even bother to tell Alan they weren’t coming after letting him think they probably were the day before, so again she kind of deserved this. It was hard to get a handle on Alan and Rafe’s relationship, but I think for the most part it was genuine affection on Alan’s part. The box in the drawer in the Spaulding study is the engagement ring Gus bought for Natalia even though she hasn’t accepted it yet.\n\nNovember 21, 2007\n\nA very rude man gives Natalia a tough time at Towers. Also, apparently the incredibly uniformed man doesn’t recognize Alan Spaulding who comes to Natalia’s rescue. Gus shows up at Harley’s and the boys are glad to see him. Jude is the only Bauer we’ll see celebrate this year. The one with the crew cut is Jude Bauer who as Rafe said, along with Zach Spaulding HAVE fathers who want to be involved (so Phillip’s missing right now, Rick would gladly pick up the slack). However, Harley is one of those mothers who likes to pretend the father of her children no longer exist when she gets involved with a new man. The Coopers are having a nice Thanksgiving family meal when Rafe shows up drunk and disruptive.\n\nOn the implication that she will say yes, Gus proposes again to Natalia and gets both her and Rafe’s agreement. Daisy calls Rafe and he comes to meet her. Rafe and Daisy get back together. The fuss between them is that Daisy got pregnant after they had sex and chose to have an abortion without even discussing it with Rafe. He didn’t take it well and both their parents were very upset. Coop had invited Ashlee Wolfe out to the Cooper’s Thanksgiving because they are dating. Doris – Ashlee’s mother – is still working on getting elected mayor. We miss how, but somehow the dining room table and apparently the kids table was smashed. Harley heads out to a bar where she runs into Cyrus who she had been buried alive with and has felt connected to ever since they were rescued. It ends with a lovely montage of the couples around town.\n\nRobansuefarm is the handle of one of Manny and Guiding Light‘s biggest fans following in her family’s footsteps of Guiding Light fandom since 1939.

Although there were always bright spots, there was so much wrong with Guiding Light during these years that even I couldn’t bring myself to go out of my way to watch it. Part of the problem was that continuity came unglued. Places that had long established locations floating hither and yon, now near this place now near that – more on that below. Sets in general had issues. Everybody lived in one hotel room at the Beacon. Harley and Gus’s house remains unpainted. In addition as an attempt to save money they took a Sesame Street like version of the sets creating a fake exterior street scene where the majority of scenes took place.\n\nSadly I only have a third of the episode and it sounds like the least interesting third at that. Read about the rest of the episode.\n\nThis was an Inside the Light episode which you can tell from the episode name at the front. We open with Frank announcing that there had been a gas leak that means the area of the Bauer House needs to be evacuated. He says around 1713 Coventry Road which means nothing. The Bauer House is on Skyline Drive. Next door to the Bauer House is the Spaulding Mansion if you have to evacuate one, you’d have to evacuate the other, but Alan is standing in his study perfectly fine.\n\nMost of what we have of this episode, and I haven’t found the whole thing, focuses on GusH. Gus announces the Bauer BBQ is on very excitedly and he rounds up the boys and Harley to leave. Rafe and Daisy are keeping their relationship quiet at this point. I honestly don’t remember why. Apparently they had borrowed some money from Harley’s secret stash – which the crack detective keeps in a cookie jar on her kitchen counter. I mean really, at least put in on a shelf. Gus has a “funny” exchange with Rafe about hotdogs. Who doesn’t like hotdogs? Plus disrespecting Rick’s hotdogs? On top of everything else Gus did to Rick. Really? I also don’t think it’s fair of Gus to say Alan doesn’t get along well with the Bauers. He’s currently feuding with Rick in 2007, but for the most part they don’t have any special beef.\n\nThe Coopers head to Company where they think the BBQ will be, but turns out, shocker of shockers, Company isn’t on Main Street – which is why they popped up a Company coffee cart on the Main Street set because people wouldn’t just walk over to Company except WAIT it’s now within walking distance. In another example of the Cooper’s sterling business practices there are people there, apparently customers, but they’re all just planning to leave with no sign of anyone actually working there. That sounds mean. I know back in the day the Coopers worked hard, but once the change came through in 2005-2006 you start to see more and more business practices that make perfect sense why Company and the Coopers always had money troubles. Rafe, who Harley isn’t too crazy about yet because he’s part of a rival storyline where Gus doesn’t belong with her, got seen trying to put money back in so Harley calls him on it.\n\nAs you actually DID take the money Rafe, maybe dial it back the indignant denial a little. Alan is, I think, being kind of right about Harley wanting to put Rafe in his place. Now apparently Harley’s house is also right within walking distance of Company. Harley isn’t listening to Daisy which is actually pretty common when it came to Daisy. Harley made up stories in her head about Daisy far more than she actually figured out what was going on. Alan is upset and for some reason tearing apart some flag bunting. We finally get to see a tiny bit of the rest of the party in the final fireworks watching bit at the end. Sadly the part that I don’t have looks like the better part of the episode. I’m not sure how much the audience knows at this point. Rick and Beth got married and are expecting a baby, but the baby is really Alan’s (don’t ask). Cassie had done the switch to protect the baby from Alan since she held Alan responsible for Tammy’s death which he kind of, sort of was. However, all of that made more sense that Cassie and Josh being together.\n\nRobansuefarm is the handle of one of Manny and Guiding Light‘s biggest fans following in her family’s footsteps of Guiding Light fandom since 1939.
