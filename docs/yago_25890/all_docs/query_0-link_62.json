LEMAN II, WRITER\n\nELLEN DEGENERES, WRITER\n\nEmmy night! Overall, one of the better years, because my shows won!\n\nI used to get so peeved when Erika Slezak won year after year! and\n\nthe SOD awards always favored DOOL. Did DOOL have anyone nominated\n\nthis year? Did they forget to mail the submissions? <VBEG>\n\nI had hoped to watch the show sitting at my computer, but my kids had\n\nfriends over and so I watched in the privacy of my room. So now I\n\nwill try to remember what I thought of during the show.\n\nMaura West won Best Actress! yay, especially because we got to see\n\nher husband, who is looking thinner than I remembered and was so proud\n\nof her. I thought her acceptance was sweet, mentioning her mother and\n\nGM. Of course, a CBS actress had to win, no other network had a\n\nnominee.\n\nBest Actor: Christian Le Blanc must be really good, but I was\n\nchanting RPG until the name was called.\n\nSupporting: Genie Francis had to win, because she is a legend.\n\nIt was great to see Lesli Kay again, and realize how we went from\n\ndespising Molly and LK to really appreciating her growth as an\n\nactress. I even tuned into B&B during Felicia's cancer story just to\n\nsee LK perform.\n\nI really wanted Trent Dawson to win, because he was non-contract so\n\nlong, and he is such a treasure as Henry. Rick Hearst has won enough!\n\nI know he is great, and really resent him winning on the show opposite\n\nGL!\n\nOutstanding younger actor was a tough category, and, crap, none of my\n\npicks won. Van Hansis deserved it for being good, and courageous.\n\nTom Pelfrey deserved it too (I made my family watch him one day so\n\nthat one day I will be able to tell them \"I told you so.\") (I finally\n\nsaw him onstage when GL won best drama. He has short hair.) I never\n\neven heard of the Y&R guy who one, so the Y&R fans will have to tell\n\nme that Bryton McClure deserved the Emmy.\n\nYounger actress: Yes, Jennifer Landon is quite good, but I was hoping\n\nfor Stephanie Gatschet because she began when Tammy was quite young\n\nand grew with the part, and she really made the pairing of Jonathan\n\nand Tammy work.\n\nATWT won for best directing, well I just don't know how to decide this\n\ncategory, but I'm pleased for the show. I guess it's not the\n\ndirectors' fault that the plot is tedious and boring.\n\nOutstanding Drama and Writing to GL! Yay, they deserve it. The show\n\nhas done new things in the past year, from the Wednesday special shows\n\nto Harley being the Guiding Light super heroine. They share it with\n\nY&R, so the show must have been better last year, because the RATSC\n\nfans have expressed great disappointment with the show here.\n\nI normally wouldn't make a negative comment about anyone's appearance\n\nbut I just have to get catty and say : Eva LaRue's breast implants .\n\n. . . eeeeuuuu. She had the toilet plunger look. I don't think she\n\nhad them before she got on prime time.\n\nAnd in case I haven't offended anyone yet, let me add that I can not\n\nstand The Price is Right.

I guess because I have memories of watching it at my\n\ngrandmother's house... only difference is that unlike soaps, TPIR has\n\nnever changed. No matter what year it was, for an hour you were back\n\nin the 70s.\n\n\n\nI disagree. I really liked the fan videos. I though they were a nice\n\ntouch that acknowledged the deep connection we have with the shows.\n\nIt was great to see the passion with which fans view the soaps. To me\n\nit didn't really take away from anything, it enhanced the experience.\n\nThe added value from a fan video versus one more brief clip is about\n\nthe same to me. People's speeches are also not so precious that you\n\ncan't afford to take any seconds from them -- you have people talking\n\nabout how nervous they are and thinkg like that.\n\nThis year we actually had ten whole minutes devoted to Outstanding\n\nDrama Series, which is better time management of the ceremony than\n\nusual. Also, to the extent that time management is bad, it's usually\n\nbecause people go way over time on their speeches anyway, and not\n\nbecause of any other extras that the award show does.\n\nThe additional comments about people's hobbies were also fine to me.\n\nThey didn't take time away because they were said as the winners\n\nwalked to the stage.\n\nOverall I thought the awards show this year was awesome!

Thank you, Ellen Wheeler, David Kreizman and\n\nthe rest of the writing team, P&G, CBS, the cast, and crew for\n\ndelivering such a quality program, and the judges for recognizing it!\n\nMay the show live long!!\n\nI think it was awesome of David Kreizman to mention first and foremost\n\nthe debt owed by GL to Irna Phillips. Many writers would not have done\n\nthat. His Emmy speech confirmed my faith in him as a writer. It seems\n\nthat the impartial judges agree with me that GL has a good writing\n\nteam as well.\n\nI am so happy that the two soaps I follow, ATWT and GL, did so well\n\ntonight! Means I'm watching the cream of the crop!\n\nI am ecstatic at how well GL did, and I think it was well-deserved.\n\nIO hope there will be no \"it was all a sympathy vote\" comments. If\n\nthat's the case, why didn't all the GL actors get sympathy vote wins\n\ntoo??? Last year, the conspiracy theory was that the GL actors won on\n\na sympathy vote but the production team didn't win because the judges\n\nwere savvy about not wanting to reward supposedly bad work. Now this\n\nyear we have a new conspiracy theory.

Even false\n\nbreasts can look beautiful with the proper fitting undergarments/support\n\nand some tops/dresses; however, certain necklines simply accentuate the\n\nfalseness of them.\n\nI don't remember the girl's name, but the tiny woman who came out in the\n\nwhite, very low-cut gown, arm-in-arm on both sides with two very taller\n\nmen TOTALLY accentuated the \"water balloon\" comparison.

I know plenty of people, though,\n\nsaid that this was *finally* Maura's year and I couldn't see it - at all.\n\nSo, she got it. Her acceptance speech was lovely. She looked great. It was\n\ngreat getting to see a tiny bit of Scott de Freitas, her husband, sitting\n\nbeside her. Miss him on ATWT! Maura was my 2nd pick. I don't understand the\n\nY&R nomination choices. Last year Zimmer said that if she won she wouldn't\n\nbe nominated this year. She won. She lied. She 'let' herself be nominated\n\nthis year. Learn a lesson from Charles Keating, who removed his name from\n\nnomination after he won on AW and said that it was just what was done! He\n\nwas right. She was wrong. Maybe last night was Kim Karma.\n\n> Outstanding Lead Actor\n\n> Michael Park (Jack Snyder, ATWT)\n\n> Anthony Geary (Luke Spencer, GH)\n\n> Ricky Paull Goldin (Gus Aitoro, GL)\n\n> Peter Bergman (Jack Abbott, Y&R)\n\n> ** Christian J. LeBlanc (Michael Baldwin, Y&R) **\n\nI was for Ricky Paull all the way. He is always at the top of the game & he\n\nhad the story. LeBlanc is consistently excellent. Park had a good to great\n\nyear. Geary is always excellent. Bergman is always good to excellent.\n\n> Outstanding Supporting Actress\n\n> Lesli Kay (Felicia Forrester, B&B)\n\n> ** Genie Francis (Laura Spencer, GH) **\n\n> Rebecca Herbst (Elizabeth Spencer, GH)\n\n> Gina Tognoni (Dinah Marler, GL)\n\n> Renee Elise Goldsberry (Evangeline Williamson, OLTL)\n\n> Heather Tom (ex-Kelly Buchanan, OLTL)\n\nAlready said I was delighted to see Genie win. Loved her acceptance speech &\n\nshe looked great! Cute daughter with her. Gina T and Heather T were both\n\ndeserving, but, will be again, too. And, Gina won last year, didn't she?\n\n> Outstanding Supporting Actor\n\n> Trent Dawson (Henry Coleman, ATWT)\n\n> ** Rick Hearst (Ric Lansing, GH) **\n\n> Dan Gauthier (ex-Kevin Buchanan, OLTL)\n\n> Greg Rikaart (Kevin Fisher, Y&R)\n\n> Kristoff St. John (Neil Winters, Y&R)\n\nI so totally wanted Trent Dawson to win. All in all, a great deserving group\n\nof nominees.\n\n> Outstanding Younger Actress\n\n> Leven Rambin (Lily Montgomery, AMC)\n\n> Alexandra Chando (Maddie Coleman, ATWT)\n\n> ** Jennifer Landon (Gwen Munson, ATWT) **\n\n> Julie Marie Berman (Lulu Spencer, GH)\n\n> Stephanie Gatschet (ex-Tammy Winslow Randall, GL)\n\nI was rooting hard for Stephanie to get it, but I thought Landon might - and\n\nshe did.\n\n> Outstanding Younger Actor\n\n> Van Hansis (Luke Snyder, ATWT)\n\n> Jesse Soffer (Will Munson, ATWT)\n\n> Tom Pelphrey (Jonathan Randall, GL)\n\n> James Stevenson (Jared Casey, PASSIONS)\n\n> ** Bryton McClure (Devon Hamilton, Y&R) **\n\nVan wuz robbed. He's so good & he had the story. IMO, Bryton came on bad &\n\ngot better & you don't get an Emmy just for getting better. Jesse & Tom were\n\nalso people I was rooting for, although Tom won last year, didn't he?\n\nSomeone speculated that the 2 ATWT & 1 GL nominations were split & cancelled\n\neach other out. Could be.\n\n> Outstanding Drama Series [a tie]\n\n> THE BOLD AND THE BEAUTIFUL\n\n> ** GUIDING LIGHT **\n\n> ONE LIFE TO LIVE\n\n> ** THE YOUNG AND THE RESTLESS **\n\nI was ecstatic that GL won/tied. Ellen Wheeler rocks! And, her speech\n\nknocked me over. I have thought for some time that the GL70 Year, Find the\n\nLight, of GL giving back to the community, etc. should be something people\n\neverywhere have talked about. But, nope. At least, it came up last night!\n\nMy only thought about Y&R's win/tie was to wonder what Y&R fandom would\n\nthink about Latham's team getting an Emmy. <G>\n\n> Outstanding Drama Series Writing Team\n\n> THE BOLD AND THE BEAUTIFUL\n\n> GENERAL HOSPITAL\n\n> ** GUIDING LIGHT **\n\n> THE YOUNG AND THE RESTLESS\n\nJust a little screaming here at our house over this award!
