        "text": "Quiz Answer Key and Fun Facts\n\n1. When did Gus and Harley marry?\n\nAnswer: August 2005\n\nGus and Harley were finally married for the first time August 19, 2005. Their wedding took place outside in the Company Restaurant courtyard. They had been together for about 4 years and almost got married in 2004.\n\n2. Where did Gus and Harley first get engaged?\n\nAnswer: Their house\n\nGus proposed to Harley one night in June 2003 after coming home late. He said he had to \"make a pit stop at the jeweler's\". He ended up on one knee, and of course Harley said, \"Yes.\"\n\n3. There was a place that Harley always wanted to go to. She went there with Gus for their honeymoon. Where did they go?\n\nAnswer: Greece\n\nEven though their honeymoon wasn't shown, Gus did announce at the wedding that they were going to Greece. It was said when they started saying their goodbyes to everyone. In fact, Harley's family, the Coopers, came from Greece, which was obvious at the wedding from the Greek music. Gus and Harley were away for two weeks as their portrayers, Ricky Paull Goldin and Beth Ehlers, had been on their respective vacations.\n\n4. What song played when Gus took Harley to his Greece-transformed hotel room in May 2002?\n\nAnswer: \"I Try\" by Macy Gray\n\nGus and Harley had their first love scene with \"I Try\" playing, but it was actually the second time they made love. Harley had told Gus she always wanted to go to Greece, but it wasn't the right time go. So, Gus romantically surprised her by turning his room into Greece with a bunch of decorations.\n\nThe other song choices were used for later Gus and Harley love scenes.\n\n5. In early 2005, Gus was Harley's lawyer and believed so much that Harley was innocent. Harley was found guilty and went to prison. What for?\n\nAnswer: Murdering her ex-husband Phillip\n\nHarley was accused of killing Phillip, and she had every reason to. He kidnapped her sons, demolished her house, and almost had her father's restaurant destroyed. Gus was really the only person who didn't believe she did the crime, even when evidence mounted against her. Harley went to prison, but all for nothing because Phillip turned up alive.\n\nHis father was keeping him in secret mental institution.\n\n6. In 2003 Gus and Harley were each trying to solve the 'Lori Jenson' case. They knew their main job was to find Lori, and yet they made a bet on the side to see who solved it first. They ended up working together, but who won the bet?\n\nAnswer: Harley, but they made it a tie\n\nGus and Harley worked together to solve the case, and they did, but Harley insisted she won their bet. Gus suggested they call it a tie, and so they did. Their prize was ...well... each other. But if Gus won, he would have gotten a fishing trip with his father, Alan. If Harley won, she would have gotten a day at the spa with her friends, Blake and Mel.\n\n7. What was the major shock that Gus and Harley found out in 2003?\n\nAnswer: Alan Spaulding and former maid Lucia were Gus's biological parents\n\nIn early 2003, Gus and Harley found out Gus was Spaulding from an affair Alan had with a maid. They had gotten wind that something wasn't right when reading his adopted parents' letters; something was wrong with the time-span when Gus was born. This discovery led them on a big journey to finding out who his real parents are. Harley supported Gus every step of the way.\n\n8. In 2002, Phillip developed a strong hatred of Gus. He thought Gus was a bad influence on his and Harley's son Zach. Phillip's actions led Gus and Harley to separate for a while. What did he do?\n\nAnswer: Got full custody of Zach and wouldn't let Harley have any say in his life\n\nPhillip got sole custody, kept Harley away from Zach most of the time, and would only let her have a few visits with him at the Spaulding Mansion. She wasn't allowed to pick him up from school or have him stay with her. All this because of Gus's juvenile record, which was from so long ago. Turns out Gus didn't do what his record said; he was protecting his sister, but wouldn't tell anyone.\n\n9. In 2004, Gus and Harley had a major break-up on what was meant to be their wedding day. What did Gus do that broke Harley's heart?\n\nAnswer: Chose his family over her by protecting his Aunt Alex\n\nGus didn't put Harley first when keeping his Aunt Alex from going to prison. He found out about something Alex did and didn't tell Harley. He didn't tell anyone, and Harley's brother, Frank, was framed for something he didn't do. Harley found out everything on her wedding day and dumped Gus. While mending their sad hearts, it was obvious that Gus and Harley still loved each other.\n\n10. Christmas 2004... Zach's new butterfly got loose and set off a chain of reactions. The star on the tree broke, and he wanted a new one. Harley went on a journey to find one while Gus helped search for Lizzie's missing dog. What ended up happening to Gus and Harley?\n\nAnswer: They shared a long, loving kiss\n\nGus and Harley were still apart, but fate brought them together in the form of a kiss for Christmas. They were standing on each side of the ladder next to the Coopers' tree, and they found themselves looking into each other's eyes. There was a special moment, and they captured it by kissing. It was so beautiful and perfect.\n\nSource: Author Kate235\n\nThis quiz was reviewed by FunTrivia editor ladymacb29 before going online.\n\nAny errors found in FunTrivia content are routinely corrected through our feedback system."
