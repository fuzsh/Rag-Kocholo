        "text": "The history of Harley & Mallet starts with Harley Davidson Cooper deciding yet another career move, police woman. Working at Spaulding Harley set up a password that only Alan-Michael would know. Unfortunately she was drugged by John Davis, a friend of Roger Thorpe, and she revealed the password, enabling Roger to embezzle money from Spaulding. Though Alan-Michael and Blake accused her of corporate espionage, Harley couldn’t remember anything and was soon able to prove that she’d been drugged and had Davies arrested. A few days later, Harley met friends in a bar on 5th Street and discovered corrupt cops Hutchins and Murry demanding protection money from the barkeeper and threatened her friend, Tracey, a hooker. When she was arrested for prostitution in an attempt to buy her silence she decided she’d rather be on the other side of the bars and enrolled in the Springfield Police Academy where she came upon her hard-nosed instructor, A.C. Mallet (aka Anthony Camaletti).\n\nMallet, as he came to be called had been in Springfield for a while but hadn’t discovered Harley as of yet. He came to Springfield from NYC where he was a successful Detective. Unfortunately, a romance with a mobster’s daughter, Francesca ended his reign there and sent him running with a new name and straight into the arms of Melinda Sue Lewis. Mindy and Mallet became quick friends and she was the first person he knew in Springfield. Mindy helped her friend Mallet move on after he realized he’d never be with the woman he loved again.\n\nMallet was a strict teacher. He resented being made to teach rookies and took it out on them as much as possible, especially a rookie who thought she deserved to be more, Rookie Cooper. Harley desperately wanted to be in some cases already and somehow always found herself where she wasn’t supposed to and surprisingly right next to Mallet.\n\nFinally, while chasing after Dr. Daniel St. John in the cold stretch of woods it happened: Harley was kidnapped and Mallet came to rescue. When Mallet found her she was freezing and delirious. While trying to warm up his rookie Harley made an oh-so-cute comment about her instructor’s lips. Mallet took it as delirium, but Harley meant more. She confessed her feelings to her big brother Frank, who also had become a close pal to Mall\n\nShe left Springfield unhappy with wanting Mallet but not having him want her back, so she headed for Cross Creek. But Mallet had no idea that Harley wanted him, because secretly he had fallen for her too.\n\nWhen Harley disappeared Mallet begged Frank to tell him where Harley had gone, but Frank promised Harley he wouldn’t. That is until Frank realized Mallet shared Harley’s feelings.\n\nMallet went to Dylan and finally got him to tell him that Harley was at Cross Creek. Mindy also got involved when Harley called her and she covered for Dylan so Harley wouldn’t know Mallet was on his way there.\n\nWhen Mallet showed up at the Cross Creek cabin only one thing could follow: passion. Harley and Mallet made love for the first time there in what many remember as Harley and Mallet’s best moment. When the couple returned to Springfield, Harley took her police test and passed, but their romance was still a secret since Mallet was still her instructor.\n\nBut happiness can never last for long on a soap opera. Harley and Mallet then began to work on their first case together much to the dismay of their captain, who wanted Harley as a rookie, but now she had to help. Jenna Bradshaw, international jewel thief had set her sights on the jewels of the Springfield, but Mallet knew her. Or at least recognized her as what she was, a thief; but that wasn’t enough to arrest her. Mallet had to catch her in the act.\n\nSo they set up a plan. Jenna had already become interested in Mallet and he used that against her, but he needed someone on the inside so Harley became Jenna’s assistant. But while the sting went on Harley & Mallet couldn’t be seen together so once again their romance became secret and was confined to a small hotel. After awhile Jenna found out she had been set up, but the couple already had enough to get her. Jenna was caught but in true soap fashion the beautiful temptress got away and reformed herself\n\nJust when Harley & Mallet thought the rough times were behind them, the worst moment of their romance took place. All at the hands of Harley’s former husband and now friend, Alan Michael Spaulding. A-M wanted Eleni Andros, but Eleni wanted Frank Cooper, Harley trustworthy big brother. Eleni had been shipped from Greece to marry Frank, but he wanted no part in it, because he didn’t love her. But soon the two really fell for each other but before their passion could be sealed Frank was called away to France. While there A-M set it up so a prostitute named Mussette would sneak into Frank’s bed just as Eleni, who A-M sent there to “surprise” her love would find them. When she did Frank was out like a light from a “Mickey” Mussette slipped him. Eleni was devastated and headed back for the states with A-M. But when she tried to get back into the states she was stopped and called an illegal alien.\n\nBlake Thorpe, A-M’s ex-wife, who was jealous of her ex’s lust for the Grecian beauty called the authorities on her. But her plan backfired when on the spot, A-M offered to marry Eleni to keep her in the country. Eleni only believed in marrying someone she loved, but A-M confessed his true feelings and Eleni felt she could grow to love one of her closest friends.\n\nWhen Frank found out A-M’s deception and Eleni’s marriage he was extremely hurt. Harley & Mallet were upset at A-M for marrying Eleni when he knew how she felt toward Frank. But Eleni grew to deeply love A-M, but his past was coming back to haunt him.\n\nMussette, the woman A-M had hired to deceive Eleni was back. She wanted more money for she’d done once she found out what it did for A-M. But A-M wanted no more to do with her and hired a man to stop her, Pierre. But Pierre wasn’t the best of hitmen/spies. His big plan for getting rid of Mussette, who recently showed up in Springfield and even befriended Eleni was to blow her up.\n\nPierre put a bomb in Mussette’s car. But some complications came along the way, like the fact that Eleni’s car was in the same parking garage and when A-M found this out he freaked. Mallet had also stumbled upon what was going on and went to try to stop Mussette from opening her car door and exploding herself to pieces. But something worse happened. Even though Eleni got away before the bomb went off, Mallet got there right as Mussette opened her door. The bomb went off right in front of Mussette and Mallet.\n\nMallet was rushed to the hospital … in grave condition. Mussette was dead. Harley was a wreck, and so was A-M, because all he knew was a dark-haired woman had been hurt as well, but it wasn’t his precious Eleni. A tough time was ahead: Mallet couldn’t walk and he couldn’t hear. His only communication with Harley was him seeing her lips move.\n\nHis paralysis might be permanent and if not he maybe be sterile. He was give a hearing ear dog (Xyla) to assist him in every day living.\n\nMallet was crushed and decided the best thing to do was to break it off with Harley, for her own good. Harley was crushed, she had no idea why Mallet would cut her off when he needed her the most. But soon Mallet and Harley were back together and decided to move in together. Mallet who was now confined to a wheelchair tried to be his old self but couldn’t. Soon his hearing returned.\n\nThen all of A-M secrets were unleashed. Pierre was back ready to destroy A-M and anybody in his way. In a daring shoot-out at the airport: Harley, A-M, Mallet and Nick Spaulding stop Pierre. The police arrive and ask what’s going on, Nick wants to turn A-M in for the explosion that killed Mussette and hurt Mallet, but Mallet stops him. A-M had saved Harley’s life and took a bullet for her. Mallet and Harley kept quiet.\n\nOn Xmas day Mallet’s present to Harley was the fact that he could take a few steps, and now he was on his way to walking on his own. Then Mallet did something he never thought he would: he proposed and Harley gladly accepted .\n\nBy January 1993, Mallet had almost fully recovered and since he had to give Xyla back to his owner in Washington, he and Harley traveled there and decided to visit the Vietnam Memorial to find Harley’s father’s name. To her surprise his name wasn’t there. An Army official confessed that her father had not died in Vietnam. All those years Frank and Harley believed their father Frank Buzz Cooper Sr. had died in Vietnam were lies. When Harley couldn’t find his name anywhere on the wall she had to find out from her mother Nadine. Buzz had been MIA and she didn’t want to give them any false hope so she said he died.\n\nWhen Nadine’s cousin Rex showed up in town no one thought anything of it, except Mallet. Rex was strange, but really Rex was none other than Buzz, who had been back in the States since ’77. With slight reconstructive surgery he was almost unrecognizable to Nadine, but she knew who he was.\n\nWhen Harley & Frank finally found out who Rex was they were hurt, but soon accepted Buzz into their lives. Harley & Mallet soon became second fiddle as Frank & Eleni who had once again found each other were getting married. Even as Eleni was expecting their child any day.\n\nHarley & Mallet were the maid of honor and best man and were also named god parents of Marina, Frank & Eleni’s daughter born just hours after they exchanged vows.\n\nDavid Grant, who worked at Harley’s family’s diner: Meals & Wheels was on the run for murdering a neighborhood racist. But David was only defending himself. Though Harley & Mallet believed in his innocence they had to do their job, at David’s trial it was revealed that he was innocent and he was released. Upon this good news, Buzz had some more good news. He wanted to throw his daughter a surprise wedding.\n\nSo finally after Eleni gave Harley her wedding dress, the guests assembled, and Harley wearing her big clunky police shoes, the couple married in what was the most romantic wedding ever. Some may have called it tacky, but it never lacked emotion and love. Soon afterward Harley and Mallet boarded a plane for Florida to begin their honeymoon, where they stayed and joined the police force.\n\nIn 1997, Harley returned to Springfield after discovering that Mallet had an affair with his partner. Months later, Mallet called Harley requesting a divorce.\n\nSusan Lemay was born Daisy Cooper in September of 1987 to teenage parents Harley Cooper and Dylan Lewis. Her birth, and subsequent adoption, would impact Harley for the rest of her life. Susan Lemay did not have the easiest early life, in fact her childhood could be described as somewhat “traumatic”. She had a life threatening illness, she was kidnapped (twice), the only mother she had ever known died of cancer, and then her father died in a fire.\n\n1. Brittany Slatterly : (August 1989-October 1989; March-April 1995) Daisy made her way into the world on the side of the highway when her mother Harley was involved in a car accident on the way to Cedars hospital. Harley named the baby Daisy after the flower Dylan used to bring her. A teenager, Harley was unable to take care of young Daisy and put her up for adoption. Daisy’s adoptive parents Jim and Connie Lemay would rename her Susan. In 1989 Susan’s biological father Dylan learned he had a daughter and convinced Harley to reclaim their child. Dylan and Samantha Marler worked as Susan’s nannies unbeknownst to the Lemays, which granted Harley access to her daughter. Harley’s then-husband Alan-Michael attempted to buy Susan from the Lemays but was refused. Alan-Michael retaliated by revealing the true identity of Dylan to the Lemays. As a result Harley’s only connection to her child was severed and placed a great strain on her marriage to Alan-Michael. In an attempt to hold on to Harley Alan-Michael kidnapped young Susan and made plans for them to leave the country. Harley refused and returned Susan to her adoptive parents who then moved away from Springfield. In 1994, Connie Lemay revealed to Dylan that an eight-year old Susan had contracted a rare form of diabetes. She convinced Dylan to donate part of his pancreas to Susan in a life-threatening surgery. The procedure was a success and young Susan recovered yet the Lemays barred Dylan from seeing his daughter.

Brittany Snow (December 1998 to March 2001; May 2001) In 1998 Connie Lemay died of cancer and a distraught Susan ran away from home in order to find Harley. Susan begged Harley and her then-husband Phillip Spaulding to not return her to her father. When Jim Lemay arrived to collect his daughter Harley convinced him to let Susan stay in Springfield for the holidays. Susan plotted to get Harley’s full attention and faked an illness in January 1999 in order to prolong her stay in Springfield. Susan’s real plan was to bring Harley and her father Jim together, however her matchmaking plans failed. Phillip urged his wife to let Susan and Jim live their own lives. When Harley became pregnant a hurt Susan left town. However Susan later reached out to Harley and mother and daughter continued to keep in contact without Phillip and Jim’s knowledge. In February 1999, Susan called Harley from the bus station after being accused of shoplifting. When Phillip and Jim arrived they argued about Harley’s intervention in Susan’s life. Because Harley and Susan refused to part Phillip suggested Jim love to Springfield and even offered him a position at Spaulding Enterprises. Not long after, the Nursery Rhyme Stalker, Holly Reade, kidnapped Susan along with other Springfield children. Susan and the children escaped but were caught again by Holly. They would eventually be rescued by Susan’s grandmother Reva Lewis. Susan tried to play on Harley’s jealousy by getting close to Phillip’s ex-wife, Beth Raines. Phillip overheard Susan asking questions about miscarriages and he warned a pregnant Harley that Susan could be dangerous. Jim threatened to leave town over Phillip’s accusations, but Harley and Beth persuaded Phillip to convince Jim to stay in Springfield. In the spring on 1999 Susan befriended a boy named Max Nickerson. Susan and Max sneaked into Buzz’s new restaurant to make dinner. Max dropped a cigarette on the floor, setting the diner ablaze. Though both were rescued the restaurant was destroyed. When Susan learned that Jim and Beth were going on a business trip to the Bahamas, Susan hoped that lacing Beth’s drink would cause Beth to miss her flight. However Susan drank it herself and in daze jumped into the lake. A Jim and Harley planned to send Susan to a camp for trouble teens, Susan and Max attempted to run away together. Susan and Max reconciled their friendship when they both wound up in the camp for troubled teens. Later, Jim and Susan talked their problems through, and Jim took her home. Susan apologized to Beth, but continued to disapprove of Beth’s relationship with Jim. Susan traveled to San Cristobel with Beth, Jim, Phillip, and Harley for Thanksgiving with Cassie and Prince Richard Winslow. Phillip and Beth needed to return home for business, and Jim agreed to fly them in a private jet. The jet crashed, but the three were eventually rescued. In January 2000, Susan and Max found Beth’s prenatal vitamins, and realized that Beth was pregnant. Soon after, it was revealed that Phillip, not Jim, was the baby’s father however Jim and Beth married despite Susan’s suspicions. Susan began to act out, even getting involved in Sam Spencer’s pirating CDs. Then tragedy struck for Susan once again when her father Jim Lemay died in a fire saving Lizzie and James Spaulding. Susan grew more distant from Harley and became increasingly close to Beth. Feeling out-of-place in Springfield Susan eventually went away to boarding school. Brittany Snow was great at portraying a teenage Susan Lemay. Susan Lemay had faced numerous heart breaks in her young life but there was a “realness” to the character. She was very much a teenager for she would dance and sing along to songs on the radio and her room was cluttered with Backstreet Boy posters. And Brittany Snow was fabulous at portraying those pesky teenage emotions, like Susan’s crush on Max to her jealousy over her father’s relationship with Beth as well as her overwhelming grief at losing her father. And though she had a tendency to be manipulative it was very “Harleyesque” for when Harley was a teenager she was a bit of a wild child herself. Susan and Max’s House Party. Christmas 1999. How to Live (Classic GL clips after Jim’s death).\n\n3. Bonnie Dennison (January 2007-September 2009) : In 2007, Harley and her husband Gus Aitoro were seeking to adopt an abandoned baby they had found. Needing a statement from Harley’s firstborn, they visited Susan’s school and learned that Susan, who now went by Daisy, was not the innocent girl that Harley remembered. Daisy’s boyfriend Mark Gillespie, A.K.A. “G,” burglarized Harley and Gus’ house then struck Daisy’s cousin Tammy Winslow with his car before fleeing the scene. Gus discovered Daisy passed out in the back of the car and attempted to get her to see “G” for the criminal he was. Gus locked her in a room at Towers in the hopes of sobering her up. While giving testimony at Harley and Gus’ adoption hearing Daisy broke down and confessed that she was in the car that hit Tammy. The judge denied Harley and Gus custody of Sydney, and expressed concerns that Harley’s absentee parenting had adversely affected Daisy. Harley realized that her daughter needed structure. She enrolled Daisy in public school and set her up as a candy striper at Cedars. Daisy would rebel against the structure Harley attempted to put in place while Gus stood up for the teenager and tried to mend the mother-daughter rift. Gus’ support and understanding resulted in Daisy developing a crush on her stepfather. After she was nearly raped by a boy at school she called Gus and Harley, but Harley believed Bobby over Daisy, and put Daisy in jail overnight to teach her a lesson. Harley and Daisy’s relationship reached an all-time low when Harley slapped Daisy for claiming that her mother would’ve screwed up Sydney more than she already did Daisy. Harley told Daisy that she was sending her to boot camp. Though Daisy tried to hide at Reva’s Harley was adamant that Daisy go to boot camp. Gus offered to drive her there and during a rest stop Daisy confessed her love for him. When he didn’t reciprocate her feelings Daisy drugged him and slipped into his bed. The candles caught fire, and a panicked Daisy called the paramedics when she couldn’t revive Gus to make an escape. Gus kept Daisy’s secret and claimed that the fire was his fault claiming he had taken painkillers when he woke up. A bitter Daisy found the mysterious Natalia in Chicago, and upon learning that Natalia still had feelings for Gus, Daisy hinted to Natalia that Harley and Gus were having marital problems. A traffic ticket from Chicago proved that Daisy had violated her parole by leaving Springfield. Seeing that she was out of control, her mother decided it would be best if she was sent away to juvenile detention. Once there, she befriended Ashlee Wolfe who protected her from a fight. She also began speaking to another guy she called “vent boy” since they communicated through the vents. Daisy refused to see or speak to Harley, but she allowed Gus to visit, though he expressed his anger that Daisy had lured Natalia to Springfield. Dylan took Harley to see Daisy, and he confessed that boot camp had been his idea. Daisy softened toward Harley, even hugging her. When Daisy arrived home from detention, she was shocked to see that Rafe was “vent boy.” Rafe and Daisy pretended that they’d never met, so that they could carry on their relationship under the same roof. Their secret caused Rafe and Harley to butt heads until Daisy finally revealed the truth about her relationship with Rafe. Daisy moved in with Dylan yet their parents still forbade them from seeing each other. They snuck around behind their parents’ backs but were found out when Rafe went into insulin shock during their secret date at the Spaulding lake house. Daisy tried to strike an allegiance with Natalia, in which Daisy would help Natalia win Gus in exchange for time with Rafe. Weeks later, Daisy and Rafe declared their love for each other, and made love at the Spaulding lake house. More time passed, and Daisy seemingly pulled herself together. However, around the time she won vice president of the student council, she also discovered that she was pregnant. Daisy had an abortion which angered Rafe since it went against his Catholic beliefs though Dylan and Harley supported her though this time. Things drew to a head when an angry-at-the-world Rafe got drunk, and disrupted Thanksgiving at Harley’s house. Daisy went to Rafe, and confided in him that she’d felt empty inside ever since the abortion. Daisy turned on divorcee Harley after catching her kissing Marina’s fiancé, Cyrus Foley. Disgusted by her mother’s actions, Daisy moved out of the house, and suggested to Rafe that they find a place of their own. Daisy told Harley she needed money for school but was upset when Harley didn’t have any money to spare. After Gus’s sudden death in a motorcycle crash, Rafe nixed plans to move in with Daisy to be there for Natalia. In his grief, Rafe turned cold to Daisy and on graduation day, Rafe shot Jeffrey, and went on the run. Not long after, G returned to town, despite still being wanted in connection with Tammy’s murder. Daisy hid G from the police, and when Cyrus discovered them, he shockingly revealed that G was his younger brother, Grady Foley. When Daisy learned that Grady was the mysterious man who’d been flirting with Ashlee, Daisy spitefully called the police on him. Though confused about her feelings for Grady she Unable to send him to prison, Daisy lied on the stand, testifying that Tammy’s death had been an accident. In 2009, Daisy encouraged Bill not to give up when Lizzie suspected that he was her kidnapper. When Coop died in a terrible car accident, a distraught Buzz sought revenge on Alan. Buzz urged Grady to testify that Alan had hired Grady to kill Jonathan. Grady reluctantly agreed to do it when he saw how important it was to Daisy, but he never showed up at the hearing. Daisy took a gun and went to confront Alan, convinced he had something to do with Grady’s disappearance. Daisy fired at Alan, but missed. Buzz arrived, and convinced her to let it go. Towards the end of the show Daisy grew more mature. She began dating James Spaulding (the young boy her father Jim died saving), and helped her family by babysitting for Marina and Reva. Daisy applied to Berkley and was eventually accepted. Her and Ashlee went to California together with James and Daisy exchanging “I love yous”. The most interesting aspect of Bonnie Dennison’s character on Guiding Light was that the character of Susan Lemay was completely erased in favor of this new entity named Daisy. As a young girl Susan had sought out her birth mother and they had a rather amicable relationship. Daisy was a bitter teenager who dated lowlife Grady and even lied for him to spare him prison time for killing her cousin. For a lot of viewers the Daisy character was very polarizing. I felt Dennison did a good job of playing a teenager, but I disliked Daisy for a multitude of reasons. But that tends to happen when writers ignore the character history in order to play the conflict. But the biggest problem with the Daisy character is that towards the end of the show the writing began to focus on the teen scene. As a legendary soap came to a close I wanted to see the legendary characters get their final hurrah, I didn’t want to see Daisy sucking face with that greasy Grady character. But I digress. Bonnie Dennison’s Daisy, A very polarizing character. Though I would have rather seen a little less Daisy and a lot more Susan I think the best part of Daisy was her friendship with Ashlee (even if it was more one-sided). But that’s just me. Some Daisy clips: Taking Back (Dylan tells Daisy that Harley wanted her baby back), When she was Good , Choices (The Daisy abortion storyline), March 2009-A Daring Confrontation (Daisy VS Alan…please!)\n\nThe term Character Assassination comes into play when a soap character begins to act in ways that are inconsistent to that character’s personality and history. While soap characters can change over time, these changes are usually prompted by storyline and are gradual, thus, seeming more natural. However, sometimes writers will instead change the characters to fit the story and therefore viewers are left judging characters by their onscreen actions instead of their history.\n\nWith no reason shown for the sudden change in a character’s personality or actions viewers are left grasping at straws and changing their views based on what they see instead of what they knew about the character.\n\nOver the course of Guiding Light’s long history there were several characters that were subjected to this type of character destruction, and probably many more than you could even make a list for. But for the sake of condensing I compiled this list along with other Guiding Light fans.\n\n***\n\n10. Tony Santos. This one is of course one of my pet peeves, that I have spoken about in length. The Tony Santos that viewers were introduced to in the early years was very complex and multi-layered. He was torn between wanting to be a better man and the life he had grown up in. He was impulsive, reckless, and could be cocky at times but he had a good heart. The two constants in his life were his love of Marah Lewis and his loyalty to his cousin Danny. Yes the role was recast and viewers were forced to accept another actor as Tony but that change wouldn’t have been so difficult if Tony wouldn’t have started acting completely out of character. Suddenly his love of Marah was completely forgotten. Instead of his undying loyalty to Danny he was jealous and wanted everything Danny had, including Michelle. And though he and Danny had left the mob life years before Tony was drawn back in, he actually seemed to welcome it. Tony’s character lost all the positive aspects of his character until he became a dark rather unappealing character.\n\n9. Alan-Michael Spaulding. While Alan and Phillip embraced their Spaulding instincts a key ingredient of Alan-Michael’s character was his desire to be different from his father and brother. He was Alan Spaulding’s biological son but he always felt like Alan favored Phillip over him which made his desperate for his approval. Despite his need for Alan’s approval he knew his father didn’t deserve his love, not when Alan pitted Alan-Michael and Phillip against each other, both in the family and in business. That was the background of his character: the constant need to prove himself worthy of his father’s love, his need to prove himself worthy of Spaulding, and his desire to not be like Alan and Phillip. Though Alan-Michael was never really a “good guy” his return in 2005 marked a huge deviation from his usual characterization. He had no problems using his ex-wife Harley and old flame Dinah to gain control of Spaulding, he faked being paralyzed to try to win the heart of Ava from Coop, and he exposed pictures of Olivia and Jeffery kissing on the day Olivia was set to marry Buzz Cooper (his ex-father in law). When all was said and done Alan-Michael Spaulding, the Spaulding who had always tried to be different from his father and brother, was boasting about how his family owned the whole town. Gloating that his family owned the whole town it was a vast change from the humble man who worked at the Meals and Wheels Diner after marrying Harley. The man who could so callously screw over his friends was a far cry from the man who helped Lucy get a job at Spaulding even though she initially struggled as an administrative assistant. No, Alan-Michael was never a “good guy” but he was never a bad guy either. Alan-Michael was a characters with all kinds of shades of grey. He was manipulative, calculating, and shrewd. But he was also protective, loyal, and loving. He was Spaulding but he had enough Bauer in him that the good qualities often overshadowed the bad. But when the writers decided to take Alan-Michael in a “new direction” the aspects that made him such a dynamic character were missing.\n\n8. Annie Dutton. Long before Annie Dutton became one of Guiding Light’s favorite villainess she was simply a nurse with a past. As she treated Josh Lewis for his broken leg they quickly fell for each other. But Annie had secrets, she had been married to Rick Bauer in Chicago but the marriage fell apart due to her alcoholism. Annie hid the secret from Josh and the two became engaged, but not long after, Annie told Josh her secrets. After initial resentment, Josh forgave Annie and the two married. In 1995, Reva Shayne was discovered alive meaning Josh and Reva were still legally married. Josh was determined to stay with Annie and he divorced Reva and married Annie legally. In time, Josh and Reva grew closer again, but Shayne, and especially Marah, loved Annie and wanted her as their mommy. Annie knew that Josh was still in love with Reva. This infuriated Annie, who had started drinking again and had become addicted to painkillers. She was caught stealing drugs from the hospital and forging Rick’s name on prescriptions, and Lillian Raines fired her. Josh and Rick intervened with the help of drug consultant Rachel Sullivan, and Annie went through a radical withdrawal treatment in the Bauer cabin. To Josh’s dismay, Annie then took a job as a private physical therapist to Alan Spaulding, who soon fell in love with her. She was desperate to keep Josh and went so far as to get artificially inseminated. She picked a fight with Reva at the top of the stairs at the Spaulding mansion and made it look like Reva pushed her down the stairs and thus caused her to miscarry. With Josh out of the picture Annie moved on with Alan, the two planned to marry, but Reva learned Annie was married to another man. With the return of Reva Shayne it was inevitable that Josh and Reva would find their way back to each other. However, Josh reassuring Annie that he loved her while making eyes at Reva only drove Annie closer to the edge until Annie snapped. Annie’s story would continue, complete with plastic surgery to hide her identity, and Annie would go into Guiding Light history best remembered as a villain. A very different end to a character that started off relatively nice.\n\n7. Nola Reardon. This quirky character was always a fan favorite and one half of the Quint and Nola (Quola) super couple. But in 1995 Nola returned to town with son Anthony and no Quinton. His absence was explained by news of an affair and Nola was understandably heartbroken. But she took over the running of the boarding house and became friends with Frank Cooper. One day he kissed her due to excitement and Nola took it to heart, literally. Nola began fantasizing about Buzz and leaving him cookies and flowers. Breaking into the fire house where he lived to steal a picture…which she had framed and then brought back! Buzz eventually figured out it was Nola stalking him and forgave her, then he fell down some steps and got amnesia. Nola even held over Jenna’s head that the baby Jenna is carrying wasn’t really Buzz’s. Buzz and Jenna forgave Nola she left down embarrassed and ashamed. And in true character assassination form we were never shown why Nola turned to stalker mode. Quint himself had followed in Nola’s wake to win back the heart of his beloved. Nola Reardon was quirky (and quite flakey) but she wasn’t stalkerish. Nola was feisty and determined. This was a woman who when forgotten on her wedding day RAN down the road and hitched a ride on a fire truck. Who survived countless adventures as Quinton’s sidekick. But a case of heartbreak has her descending into stalker behavior? Sorry, not buying it. This story was so bad that Nola’s portrayer Lisa Brown even refused to come back until the final episodes where we were led to believe that Nola and Quint had in fact reunited.\n\n6. Michelle Bauer Santos. Michelle had overcome blindness and survived several murder attempts by her mother-in-law but it would be an explosion in 2004 that would have fans cringing in horror at what the writers had in store for this legacy character. Completely wiped of her memory she turned to the one person she did remember, the person who rescued her, Tony. Michelle felt pressured by her family members to regain her memories and lashed out at everyone, especially her husband Danny. When Tony revealed that Danny was a mobster Michelle was intrigued. In fact, new amnesia Michelle was impulsive and carefree, and Michelle looked at Danny’s attempts at helping her as him controlling her which led to the end of Manny. While fans could have handled some of the changes in Michelle, the character took a big hit when she jumped into a relationship with Danny’s cousin Tony. Especially when her memories began returning and she knew the relationship Danny and her had could never compare to what she was trying to force with Tony. Tony was just a comfortable friend who didn’t push her to remember her old life. Tony himself got the lines blurred between security and love which is why this storyline was really tragic. It saw the character assassination of two characters and would ultimately lead to Tony’s death. Michelle and Danny had an ever rockier road to reconciliation they did find their way back to each other and made their way out of Springfield in 2005. Fans had just spend almost a year watching Michelle act like a completely different woman only for the writers to effectively shrug their shoulders and leave her this forgotten soul of a character. What was truly awful about this story was once Michelle and Danny reunited it was like Michelle had never had amnesia in the first place! Her personality transformation was erased and she just went back to her old self and both Danny, Michelle, and their kids were sent to live happily ever after offscreen. Two character assassinations, one death, and this amnesia storyline was one epic failure that lasted way past its expiration date.\n\n5. Alexandra Spaulding. When I asked my Twitter followers their personal opinions on Guiding Light character Assassinations I got quite a few responses for Alexandra Spaulding. I had to think about it for a while because I have always considered Alexandra as being rather, well,…devious. Especially when it pertained to her relationship with her brother Alan. But in 2004 Alan let investigators see the files for Spaulding Pharmaceuticals, especially regarding the drug Antmonious, which was being sold on the black market as Delirium. When stock holders began dumping their stock in Spaulding Alexandra followed suit and gave a man Brad Green full reign over Antmonious. Things would come to a head when it was discovered that Alexandra was working with Brad to ship the drug Antmonious to the mob, who would then refine it into Delirium and sell it on the streets. Alan then pleaded with Gus to spare her from being arrested (which he agreed to). But when Frank Cooper began investigating Alexandra tried to have him framed. Though Alexandra was in jail briefly the very idea that Alexandra Spaulding would become a drug dealer was ludicrous and completely out of character. A cornerstone to Alexandra’s character was proving to that she could run Spaulding just as good as Alan could. Brandon Spaulding used to pit Alexandra and Alan against each other and it molded Alexandra into the tough woman she was, in business and her personal life. Even if we were to believe that ambition made her blind to the illegal manufacturing practices going on at Spaulding many viewers found it hard to comprehend how Alexandra would ever be that, for lack of a better word, stupid.\n\n4. Matt Reardon. In 2007 Matt sought out investors for a new business venture. When large sums of money began being transferred out of Vanessa’s accounts Mallet began to investigate, which made Matt nervous. Matt’s nervousness wasn’t lost on Dinah and when she inquired about it, he confessed that he dipped into her funds to woo investors and never replaced the money or told Vanessa. Weeks later, Matt was forced to admit the truth to Vanessa when his main investor began demanding his money. Sadly, the investor was nothing more than a loan shark and Vanessa berated Matt for being stupid enough to do business with a criminal, When Vanessa asked why he couldn’t come to her, Matt confessed that throughout their marriage he always felt second-best. Matt also had another secret—he not only dipped into Vanessa’s money; he used Maureen’s trust fund as collateral. When the loan shark, Griggs, shot Dinah and put her in a coma Vanessa said their marriage was over. Matt had just had an argument with Vanessa who warned him to stay away from Dinah since she believed that he was a bad influence on her daughter. Though Matt tried to steer Dinah away from him, she confided that he was the only one she could confide it. When she offered to leave to keep him from getting in trouble with Vanessa, Matt realized that he needed her too and suddenly kissed her. He quickly pulled away and apologized but Dinah insisted that it was no big deal. Later, after Matt made a scene after seeing Vanessa and Billy together Dinah pulled Matt in for a kiss. As they kissed passionately Mallet saw and attacked Matt, which was witnessed by Vanessa as well. In the meantime, Vanessa and Mallet were both highly concerned with Dinah’s well being and irresponsible behavior. Angered that Mallet was treating her like a child, Dinah returned her wedding ring and she and Matt ended up making love. Later, Dinah came for Matt for company again but he was frustrated because he was supposed to spend time with Maureen but she was taking an entrance exam at her new boarding school. Feeling sorry for him, Dinah pulled Maureen out of school and brought her to Matt. After Vanessa and Mallet had Dinah committed to a mental hospital Matt and Vanessa made it seem as if they had reconciled. However months later, Matt confessed to Dinah, who’d since been released, that he and Vanessa were never together. It was all a lie to help Dinah get her life back together. After Dinah hugged Matt, he backed away and told her that they weren’t good for each other anymore. Dinah was always looking for trouble and he did not need that. Early in Matt and Vanessa’s relationship Dinah (then played by Wendy Moniz) had tried to seduce Matt with no success. Matt wasn’t that guy, hell Matt and Vanessa fell in love online again while hiding behind screen names. Nor was he the guy to embezzle money from his wife or daughter. And I am pretty sure after years of being married to Vanessa Chamberlain he was used to her wealth but suddenly he was threatened by it to the point of going to loan sharks. No the character of Matt was destroyed in other to reunite Vanessa and Billy for the sake of history leaving fans of the Matt character and the Vanessa and Matt pairing bewildered.\n\n3. Harley Cooper. After Harley’s marriage to Gus ended in 2007 she was understandably hurt and lost but it would be in 2008 that the character would really take a beating. After being trapped in a building with her niece’s boyfriend Cyrus. Desperate to keep Harley alive and hopeful, Cyrus kissed her gently. Shell shocked, Harley taken to Cedars. As she was released, Gus rushed in to see if she was alright and offered to take Harley home and take care of her. However Harley saw papers sticking out of his pocket and was shocked to see they were annulment papers. Distressed, she asked if Gus knew what an annulment meant, it meant that their marriage never happened. It wasn’t long before Harley was having feelings for Cyrus and she kissed him despite him dating her niece. Harley promised Marina that she’d never hurt her by going after Cyrus. Harley then went to Cyrus and admitted that she wanted to be with him. However, this time Cyrus was determined to do the right thing and stand by Marina. As Cyrus tried to fight his feelings for Harley, the pair’s closeness was not lost on Marina. Finally, Cyrus and Marina decided to move to France. However, the night they were supposed to leave, Cyrus met with Harley and confessed that she was the one he loved. Neither Cyrus nor Harley could resist the pull they had and made love. Afterwards, they decided to keep their affair a secret. Later, Cyrus finally broke down and told Marina that he loved Harley. Marina angrily lashed out just as Frank approached with Harley. While Harley tried to tell Marina that she never meant to hurt her, Marina refused to be pacified and called Harley a whore before warning her that Cyrus would hurt her as well. Later Josh shocked Harley with news that Cassie cheated on him and asked Harley to spy on Cassie in order to learn who she’d had her tryst with. Though Harley was reluctant to spy o n her best friend, when she discovered that she had maxed out her credit cards paying for Gus’ funeral, she realized that she needed to take the job. When Gus’s son Rafe shot at Jeffery O’Neill on accident. Horrified at what he’d done, Rafe ran off to the house that Gus bought for Natalia. Daisy found him and, later, brought Harley to him. Desperate to save Gus’s son, Harley decided to flee the country with Rafe. After getting some money from Buzz, Harley shared a hug with Zach and Jude before fleeing the country. Personally speaking I found it especially hard to watch Harley go after her niece’s boyfriend. That was NOT Harley. Harley had her faults but the Cooper family was very family oriented and to go behind Marina’s back was completely out of character. Added to this was the fact that Harley was married to TWO, technically THREE, Spaulding men. She had a son with Phillip Spaulding and one with Rick Bauer who was a doctor. I sure she had quite the child support and alimony coming in. Yet she was broke for the sake of plot. And then despite having two young children she fled the country with Gus’ son in order to protect him. The woman who had basically told Alan Spaulding point-blank he would not destroy her children like he had his own sons just upped and left them behind for a son that wasn’t even hers! Yes, Harley Cooper’s character was decimated in 2008 for no other reason but for plot.\n\n2. Ben Reade. Hard to talk about character assassination without mentioning Ben Reade. A legacy character, Ben Reade grew up with his best friends Bill Lewis and Michelle Bauer close at his side. Young Ben was raised by his stepfather Fletcher Reade, and for the most part he was a fairly ordinary kid. Under Fletcher’s loving care Ben grew into a confident and loving teenager. When Fletcher married Holly in 1995 Ben quickly accepted her and vice versa. He had a loving and supportive family and his two best friends Bill and Michelle. What could possibly go wrong? In 1996 Fletcher and Holly’s daughter was born with Down’s Syndrome. Young Ben suddenly felt he was in the way. Though Fletcher and Holly tried to reassure him this was not the case they finally relented and allowed him to attend boarding school. In 2001 a now adult Ben returned to Springfield a changed man. No longer the loving teenager he ignored his friends and established himself as a Lothario at Springfield University. He set about winning a bet about how quickly he could bed Marah Lewis and take her virginity, working with her roommate Catalina in keeping Marah and her ex Tony apart. In 2002 after years of living beyond his means and a trust fund that had gone belly up, Ben found himself broke and began working for Eden August’s escort service behind the back for his girlfriend Marina Cooper. Ben soon became one of the prime suspects in a series of murders involving people connected to Eden’s Escort service. When the truth of Ben’s extracurricular activities was exposed Marina broke up with him and sent Ben into a tailspin of despair. He became obsessed with Marina even stalking her. Finally in July Ben kidnapped Marina and took her to the Bauer cabin. Ben told Marina about how he went to boarding school and how he was molested by a teacher and how he felt ashamed. When Frank burst in Ben threatened to kill her but instead he turned the needle on himself. Rushed to the hospital Ben gave a deathbed confession. He had murdered a total of four people. After a last visit from his friends Bill and Michelle, ex-stepmother Holly and ex-stepsister Blake the once loving and ambitious Ben passed on into Guiding Light history a tarnished character. As previously stated, Ben Reade was a legacy character. And I can fondly remember watching Fletcher and Ben in their “bachelor pad”, they were such a loving father and son duo. Growing up the son of a reporter young Ben was fascinated by seeing the world, even wanted to follow in Fletcher’s footsteps and be a reporter. Such a drastic turn in the characterization of Ben was hard to watch, particularly when it was clear Ben Reade would not make it out of 2003. Watching this clip featuring a young Bill and Ben drives home how far the Ben Reade character was assassinated by the 2003 Weston regime.\n\n1. Holly Norris. I have to start off saying that I have always enjoyed the Holly character. She is neither a hero nor a vixen, she falls somewhere in the grey area in between. Holly Norris was simply a complex character. She was ambitious, strong, and yet slightly neurotic. Whereas characters like Reva wore their feelings openly Holly kept her feelings closely guarded, a pool of deep still waters. The scene from 1979 where her husband Roger Thorpe rapes Holly has become a memorable piece of Guiding Light history. One of those iconic timepieces that even if it was before your time (like me) you know about it and have watched the amazing acting between Maureen Garrett and Michael Zaslow. But it was the late 90s when the character of Holly really took a beating, a beating she never fully recovered from. It all began with the sudden romance between Holly and Fletcher Reade that would lead to their marriage in 1995. Months after they married Holly learned she was pregnant which left them both shocked, yet happy. They also learned that their unborn child would be born with Downs Syndrome. Though Holly thought of having an abortion she decided against it and later gave birth to daughter Meg. Later they learned that Meg was born with a hole in heart and needed surgery. Holly and Fletcher remained happily married until 1997 when Holly decided to let Roger back in her life. Roger and Holly’s closeness didn’t go unnoticed by Fletcher either, who after seeing Roger give Holly a “grandmother’s” ring, asked Holly point-blank if something was going on between them. After Fletcher caught Holly and Roger in an embrace a devastated Fletcher left town with Meg in tow. Holly fell into a deep depression and turned to alcohol for comfort. Holly’s brother Ken, who’d been in an institution for decades, noticed she had a drinking problem and didn’t want to watch his sister destroy herself. Sadly, Holly let it slip that Jeffery Morgan, not Buzz Cooper, was Rocky’s father which ultimately led to the death of Jenna Bradshaw. Though it appeared as if Holly was appearing to get her life together, several strange occurrences were happening in Springfield. Harley Cooper was given a gift basket that contained a poisoned apple and Vanessa Reardon found herself bit by a poisonous spider. When each instance came\n\nwith a nursery rhyme, it became clear that Springfield had a “Nursery Rhyme Stalker” who was targeting Springfield mothers….Soon it would be revealed that Holly was none other than the Nursery Rhyme Stalker. But this was not before she had kidnapped most of the children in Springfield including: Kevin and Jason Marler (Her grandchildren), Susan LeMay, Rocky, Marina, and Henry “Coop” Cooper, Shayne Lewis, Lizzie Spaulding, Tammy Layne and Roger Joshua Jessup and held them against their will. Thankfully when Fletcher heard Holly was the Nursery Rhyme Stalker he returned to Springfield and he convinced the judge that it was his actions that caused Holly to go off the deep end. FLASHFORWARD to 2004 and Holly learned of Rodger’s death from a man named Sebastian Hulce who claimed he was Rodger’s son. Sebastian asked Holly to take a trip to Santo Domingo to celebrate Roger’s life. They stopped in the same hotel Rodger kidnapped her years ago and even saw a waiter that resembled Rodger. But Sebastian\n\nthen held Holly captive, he was dying and needed Holly to contract Ed for the cure. After a long (and awful) storyline Sebastian freed his hostages, yet Holly stayed behind to bid farewell to Sebastian. Alone, Sebastian made a convincing plea for why he and Holly should be together but Holly reluctantly resisted.\n\nThe 90s were a bit of hit and miss for Guiding Light history. On one hand there was the addition of Buzz and Lucy Cooper (the later who would be a part of the great LAM pairing), and in the later 90s was the addition of the Santos family. But on the other hand this was also the era that brought such stories as Ghost Reva (though I liked that one for some odd reason) and the Reva Clone fiasco was nothing compared to the character destruction that occurred with Nursery Rhyme Stalker storyline. From that moment on the character of Holly Norris floated around in the background because many of the subsequent writers felt she was too “tarnished” to give any real storyline to. Viewers had watched Holly’s decent into depression so her actions were logical on the surface, most viewers just hated it. But the hate was magnified when the character was never given the chance to rebound When Reva was being stalked in 2002 the immediate suspect was of course, Holly Norris. Reva was convinced of her innocence but that didn’t stop the rest of Springfield. Like Ed said, “Holly was the victim of more than a stalker. The whole town turned against her.”\n\nHolly was a classic example of a character where still waters run deep. She was constantly conflicted by her emotions regarding Rodger, torn between love and hate. They were at their core toxic, but so very beautiful to watch. When asked if there were any storylines she didn’t like, it isn’t any wonder Maureen Garrett answers with the “Nursery Rhyme Stalker” and falling in a Stockholm syndrome type of love with her kidnapper Sebastian Hulce. They were both awful storylines. One “tarnished” Holly Norris and the other was so out of character for Holly it was hard to watch."
