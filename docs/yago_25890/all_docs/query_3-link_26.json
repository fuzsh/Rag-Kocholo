        "text": "Welcome to Right Kind Of Wrong, a fansite dedicated to the potential romance of Guiding Light's Cyrus Foley (Murray Bartlett) and Harley Cooper (Beth Ehlers).\n\nThe romance which blossomed after Harley and Cyrus were nearly buried alive, has caused many fans to purchase a ticket on the Charley Train hoping for more scenes. Charley is one of the affectionate couple names that fans have give Cyrus and Harley.\n\nThere are so many reason why Harley shouldn't fall in love with Cyrus.\n\nFor instance.\n\nShe's a detective with the Springfield Police Department. He's an Australian jewel thief.\n\nHe's currently married to Alexandra Spaulding (Marj Dusay) ... granted only to get a green card. She's getting a divorce from long time love Gus Aitoro (Ricky Paull Goldin).\n\nShe has three kids with teenage daughter Daisy (Bonnie Dennison) just coming back into her life. He has no past and a tenuous future.\n\nSounds complicated right?\n\nWell, there's even more. Cyrus is also currently involved with Harley's young niece Marina Cooper ( Mandy Bruno).\n\nSo why involve the heartache? Sometimes the pull of the heart is just too much. Sometimes you find your other half at the wrong time. Sometimes you can't help but fall for the right person at the wrong time.\n\nUPDATES AND NEWS\n\nAs I have a chance, this is where I will add news about updates on the site. You will be able to find news about screencaps, spoilers, video clips and such. Please check often.\n\nCharley's Story - A quick history of Harley and Cyrus's story so far. Included are screencaps and transcript. There will also be short fanfic stories written by myself.\n\nMurray Bartlett/ Cyrus Foley - A page all about our intriguing Australian jewel thief that is stealing everyone's heart. Brief biography and filmography are included.\n\nBeth Ehlers/ Harley Cooper - A page all about our tough cop with a heart of gold. Brief biography and filmography are included.\n\nGallery - Icons, Banners, Wallpapers, Postcards. All goodies to promote Charley. Please do not hotlink to any images as it uses up our bandwidth. Please credit Right Kind of Wrong if you use anything.\n\nMultimedia - Videos, screencaps and downloads of Charley Moments. I will update this when I have a chance. Check back often. Please credit RVD and Right Kind of Wrong for the clips. Credit Right Kind Of Wrong for the screencaps. Thank you Rose for clipping GL so all of us can watch it."
