        "text": "Alternate Universe\n\nCat Grant, a renowned ceramist, has agreed to teach a 10-week summer intensive at a Manhattan art school as a favor to a friend. Six of her seven students are absolutely what she expected to encounter. The seventh, though, is a mystery Cat does and doesn't want to solve. Besides, bigger things are on the horizon. She needs to focus.\n\nKara Danvers, a non-traditional student and watercolor artist, throws caution and half of her meager savings to the wind to take a summer intensive course with an artist she has admired for a long time. The problem? She can paint, she can sculpt, heck, she can even fly! But she cannot throw pottery. Something about it doesn't click for her, but she can't figure out what. Why did she take this class? She's just wasting Cat Grant's time. Doesn't she have enough problems trying to raise an alien teenager on her own? She needs to focus.\n\nMeanwhile, the (alternate) universe has other plans...\n\nFor the prompt: Bedsharing! Bonus points for a different take than the normal \"supergirl emergency\" plots.\n\nCat and Kara, on their way back to National City in one of the private jets after a business trip, end up stuck in Bhutan for a few days after the airplane develops mechanical issues. Cat's rusty language skills put them in the strangest of accommodations - together, of course.\n\nA year after Cat left to 'dive,' she receives several unexpectedly honest text messages from a certain someone, and the conversation she has with Alex Danvers when she calls helps her see the choices she made in a different light.\n\nMy prompt was these lyrics from \"New Romantics (Taylor's Version)\" by Taylor Swift:\n\n\"Please, take my hand and\n\nPlease, take me dancing and\n\nPlease, leave me stranded\n\nIt's so romantic (It's so romantic)\"\n\nMegan Hunt and Kate Murphy had an arrangement. A no-strings, no-complications, only-sex arrangement and it had been working just fine for the both of them, thank you.\n\nThen Kate got Marburg and absolutely, positively was going to die in 72 hours - until Megan Hunt said, \"Not on my watch!\"\n\nNeither of them realized just how much that one act would change things between them."
