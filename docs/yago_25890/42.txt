Character History[]

Harley grew up on the wrong side of Springfield's 5th Street and was raised by her older brother, Frank, ever since the death of their father and their mother's desertion. Since they had no parents, they were forced to depend on each other.

In 1987, Harley became pregnant with Dylan Lewis' child and eventually gave up the child for adoption. Harley would later marry Alan-Michael Spaulding, but the marriage would result in divorce.

In 1993, Harley was shocked to learn that her father Buzz Cooper was alive. It was initially believed that he had died in combat during the Vietnam War. Despite his return, Harley and her brother wanted nothing to do with him.

Harley would marry A. C. Mallet and they left for Florida. She divorced Mallet in 1997 and subsequently returned to Springfield.

After arriving back in Springfield, her life continued and she later learned that the daughter she gave up for adoption years ago was searching for her. Daisy (now going by Susan) wanted to find her birth mother after her adoptive mother had died.

Later, Harley would marry Phillip Spaulding and bear him a son, but again the marriage would end in divorce and Harley found comfort in the arms of Rick Bauer (with whom she had a son named Jude with him). She though did not stay with Rick and developed a relationship with Gus Aitoro, whom she would later marry in 2005.

Together, Harley and Gus made an attempt to adopt a baby named Sydney that they had been raising, but their attempts failed in adoption court and Sydney was given back to her birth parents.

Harley's relationship with Daisy was strained especially after Harley found out Daisy had feelings for Gus and tried to drug him in order to sleep with him.

In 2002, Harley started a detective agency called "Harley's Angels." She closed it down in 2004, but re-opened it in 2007 with her niece Marina Cooper and Dinah Marler. After the introduction of Gus's former love interest and his son Rafe, Harley and Gus's marriage ended in divorce in 2007.

As of 2008, Harley is living in Greece with her two sons, Zach and Jude.
