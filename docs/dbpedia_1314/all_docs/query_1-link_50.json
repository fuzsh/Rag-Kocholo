The principal eastern termini are Atchison and Kansas City, where connections are made with a dozen Trunk lines, extending through the north, east, and south. EaUIPMENT. This line is one of the best equipped routes of travel in the United States. The track of the Atchison, Topeka, and Santa Fe is laid for the most part with steel rails and securely ballasted. Elegant day coaches and luxiu'ious Pullman sleepers make up the regular passenger trains. These cars are provided with every modern device for safety and comfort. Emigrant passengers on this route enjoy a luxury in the shape of the emigrant sleeping cars, which are rim on all emigrant trains without extra charge. The general plan of their construction is similar to that of the Pullman sleepers, except that they are not uphol- stered. By providing their own blankets, and w^hatever other bedding they desire, they may make excellent beds for themselves, and sleep as comfortably as if they were at home. FEATURES OF THIS ROUTE. This route passes through the cities of Los Angeles, Tucson, Benson, Deming — where the A. T. & S. F. and Southern Pacific roads unite — Santa Fe, Albuquerque, Socorro, Las Vegas — where is located that pop- ular health and pleasure resort, the Las Vegas Hot Springs — Raton, Trinidad, Pueblo, and the best towns of Kansas. The country traversed comprises some of the finest mineral and richest agricultural and graz xiv Atchison, TopeJca S Santa Fe Railroad. ing lands in the United States, and at the same time is rich in the architectural ruins and traditions of pre-historic races. New Mexico and Ai'izona are full of interest to the traveler. ALL THE YEAR ROUND. While more northern latitudes are subject to severe storms during the winter, often causing long and vexatious delays to travel, the Santa Fe route is never blocked by snow, but ^is open for business every day and \"all the year round.\" < The eating houses on the line of the A., T. & S. F. are the best on any western road. THE NEW SANITARIUM, Passengers by the Atchison, Topeka, and Santa Fe will find the Hot Springs at Las Vegas a delightful resting place on their journey. The curative properties of these waters are not surpassed in the United States for diseases of the blood, lung diseases, rheumatism, dyspepsia, nervous disorders, etc. These Springs have all the healing properties of the Arkansas Hot Springs, without their hot, malarial climate. The atmosphere is a clear and invigorating mountain air, the elevation being 6,500 feet. There are twenty-two hot springs — with temperatures rang- ing from 110° to 140° — and one cold sulphur spring in the group^ They are located at the mouth of the Gallinas Canyon on the Gallinas River, some even appearing in the bed of the stream. The excellent hotel accommodations already provided will be increased April 1st, by the opening of a new hotel, one of the best houses in the West. It will have a capacity of nearly 300 rooms. The bath house has a capacity of five hundred baths daily, and is complete in all its appointments. The hunting and trout fishirg in the immediate neighborhood are excel- lent, and these attractions, together with the mild, equable climate, make the Las Vegas Hot Springs a pleasant resort for both invalids and pleasure seekers at all seasons of the year.

WE take pleasure in presenting to our patrons — who rep- resent, the leading, wide-awake business houses of the territory covered by this volume — a Directory which, in magnitude, has never before been attempted. Besides the compilation of names, we have taken especial care to preface every State, Territory, cit}'\", and town of importance with a careful sketch, giving a description of its geographical location, the contiguous country, business advantages, climate, etc., which will be found highly interesting to any one desiring a perfect knowledge of the country which we have visited. The sub- stantial acknowledgment of our services which has been ten- dered us by the business public, is well exemplified by the crowded condition of our advertising space, and the immense edition necessary to supply subscribers. The great number of copies of this large volume, which will be distributed in the territory canvassed, gives our adv^ertisers an immense circula- tion, bringing them prominently before hundreds of thousands of intelligent people, at a rate far below any other known method of advertising. In typographical appearance it will compare favorably with any of the great publications of the day, and in absolute correctness it will prove a work of -the utmost utility to the business public. We submit the volume to the people of these great States and Territories, and invite the criticism of all, believing that it will pass the ordeal un- scathed, and receive a generous welcome from its patrons. We send forth our work, fully realizing that perfection is unattainable; yet so carefully and thoroughly has the labor been performed, that it will certainly prove to be generally correct and satisfactory. In compiling this volume we have given our particular at- tention to what has heretofore been considered as only a sec- Preface. ondary matter. Appreciating the fact that the mere insertion of matter in a work of this nature is not enough, if the ar- rangement of it cannot be readily comprehended, we have endeavored to arrange each portion in natural and intelligent order, and so greatly facilitate reference. It is easily under- stood how essential is our alphabetical list of names, as an index, as it were, to the classified headings. An acknowledgment of our obligations is due to the vari- ous railroad, steamship and stage line officials for their many acts of kindness in lessening our labors, and promoting the interests of our book in other ways. Our sii^cere thanks are also due county officials, postmasters and other co-workers for their zeal in expediting the progress of our work. co:>NTEisrTS Page Abilene 474 Agua Caliente 266 Aofna Fria 266 Agua Fria Valley 266 Alameda 725 Alamilo 309 Alamo Station 266 Alamosa 367 Albuquerque 309 Alexandra 266 Algodones 312 Alrua 477 Alpine Ranch 729 Altamont 729 American Ranch 266 Anaheim 729 Antelope Creek Station . . . 266 Antelope Station 266 Antelope A'alley 266 Antioch 732 Anton Chico 312 Anvil Rock... 267 Apache Pass 267 Arivaca 267 Arizona, sketch of 264 Arizona, alphabetically . . . 266 Arkansas City 477 Atchison 479 Athlone 733 Aubrey 267 Aztec 312 Bakersfield. ,733 Banning. . 736 Banta 736 Bed Rock 267 Belen 312 Belle Blaine. 485 Beloit 486 Belvue 488 Benson 267 Berendo- 737 Berkeley 737 Bemal 312 Bernalillo 313 Big Bug 267 Bisbee 268 Bloomfield 313 Blue Hill 489 Borden 738 Bowie 268 Bradshaw 268 Brentwood 738 Brigham City 268 Brook ville 489 Buena Vista 313 Page] Buffalo 489|Delano Bumble Bee 268 Deming;. . . .

Although it is a narrow guage, the rails are of heavy H pattern. The road-bed, bridges, steam ferry-boats (on the San Francisco end) and all buildings are of the most permanent chafacter. Great praise is due the company for tliis enterprise. They have surmounted many difficulties, at an enormous cost, in making a route through the formidable Santa Cruz Mountains, which have seemed to defy rail- road construction heretofore. No less than seven tunnels — bored tli rough roc-k, sometimes as hard as adamant, and aggregating three and one-half miles in length — were found necessary in the last twenty miles. The indefatigable pn>- jectors are to be congxatulated on the success of their scheme, for it is, with a few- exceptions, the greatest work of the kind in America. The scenery along the route from bay to bay is a series of agreeable and picturesque surprises, ami the solidity of its construction insures safety, speed, and comfort to travelers. SANTA MARIA AND SAN LUIS OBISPO, Eleven miles in length, running from San Luis Obispo to Port Harford, thi^ coast landing connecting with steamer each way every five days. SANTA CRUZ RAILROAD. A short line of twenty miles from Pajaro to Santa Crux — a most pictun-sciue line skirting the beautiful Monterey Bay. It is now incorporated with the Northern Division of the Southern Pacific. SAN FRANCISCO. (CliASSIFIEl) ) See, also, List Received too Lats for Regular Insertion. To the classified lists of business embraced under this head we have devoted a large portion of our attention. After making a thorough canvass of this great metropolis, visiting each and all places of business, and taking notes of the prin- cipal articles dealt in and business done in each (no easy task when it i.s consid- ered that there are over 12,000 individuals and firms doing business) we have made a compilation by which may be seen at a glance all those dealing in certain lines and practicing in certain professions, in alphabetical lists. This convenient arrangement will, we hope, meet wi ll its proper apprd^ciation in the interior towns where the book is used. The growth of San Francisco, and her rapid strides in commercial importance, have excited the wonder of the civilized world. Thirty-two years ago, only, the present site of this handsomely-built city was a barren waste, a fact that would be doubted were it not knowTi by thousands who are still comparatively young. She has risen to the rank of first-class among American cities in a few short years. It will not appear strange, however, to those who are acquainted with the a«i- vantages which she has always enjoyed, that she should so advance. Slie is eligibly situated as the western outlet and entrepot of the United States, and is the U j market and depot for all the prolific States and Territories of the Pacific Coast, (Jg I which tract comprises nearly one-third of the Union. Her prospective positi<in ^ . as the second city of the United States is well supported by the argument which ^ a steady, uninterrupted flow of emigration offers. Every additional mile of rail- ^ , road track laid, either as a trunk line or a feeder to it, in the direction of the ©Pacific, will add glory to this promising young metropolis. The matter of home manufactories is just now being seriously agitated by those having the interests [!P t of the coast at heart, with important substantial result^. Factories must spring CHAS. H.

Houses more numerous than those already here must be opened to accommodate the increasing trade, and other institutions so essential to a great city must speedily follow. San Francisco possesses every convenience and comfort usually enjoyed by the greatest cities. Her streets are all brilliantly illuminated by gas and electric light, and traversed by innumerable street railroads, running in every conceivable direction, which run also with great velocity over steep hills by means of the much-prized wire cable system. Her places of amusement, schools, churches, newspapers, banks, and other institutions, are all of the first order. Among her hotels, which are unsurpassed for elegance and magnitude, as a whole, she boasts of the largest caravansary in the world, erected and equipped at a cost of $8,000,- 000. Her parks, with one exception, are small but handsome, and appropriately located. The Golden Gate Park, reclaimed from the sand-hills at an enormous expenditure, is four miles in length, and possesses a conservatory rich with exot- ics and rare plants, aa well as a system of serpentine drives that are always in perfect condition. A retrospective glance at the advance of our beautiful Bay City will reveal to us a picture of her as she may be expected to appear in the near future. ABALONE SHELL JEWELRY.
