        "text": "This is as classic as it gets on the best Easter Films list. Judy Garland and Fred Astaire dancing extravaganza takes us to New York's 5th Avenue where the pair leads a musical parade, but the story starts sometime before. Fred Astaire plays a nightclub performer who hires Judy Garland's character to be his new dance partner, with intentions of making his former one jealous. The film won an Oscar for best music - scoring of a musical picture so that alone would be a good reason to see this classic as a part of Easter Films list. If youâ€™re interested in finding out more, DVD and Blu-ray editions contain special content such as commentary from Fred Astaire's daughter Ava Astaire McKenzie and Judy Garland biographer John Fricke, and 3/22/1951 Screen Guild Theatre Broadcast.\n\nThe Velveteen Rabbit is a truly cute Easter Film for children. The film is a combination of live-action drama and animated adventure, starring great names like Jane Seymour, Tom Skerrit and Ellen Burstyn. There's a Pinocchio story in the background as the character of velveteen rabbit wishes to become a real rabbit someday. The story itself follows a lonely boy Toby who's for holidays sent to his strict grandmother. The adventure begins when he discovers a magic attic with forgotten toys, including the rabbit from the title. Through this duo's adventures, family ties are mended, redemption is on the way, and we recommend to watching it if you and your little one are interested to know: does the Velveteen Rabbit gets his chance to become a real rabbit?\n\nYogi is definitely one of the most beloved children's cartoon character, so it was only sensible to put it on the best Easter Films list. He had taken us to many adventures, and this time we're following him to the Annual Easter Jamboree at Jellystone Park. When the Easter Bunny is kidnapped, it's up to Yogi and Boo-Boo to save Easter and themselves from being shipped off to the Siberian Circus. This entertaining animation is perfect for the whole family, and if your little ones aren't acquainted with the wonderful world of Yogi the Bear then it is time for them to meet him.\n\nWho doesn't like a bit of Smurfs fun? They're having their Easter adventures so we had to put them on the best Easter Films list. All these characters are icons that we see everywhere, including a few big feature films over the years. As Easter is usually celebrated in the springtime, around April, The Smurfs: Easter is a part of The Smurfs Springtime Special. It takes us from the evil wizard Gargamel in another attempt to catch those Smurfs to April's Smurf's Day where Brainy is the mastermind behind some of the most unexpected pranks. This DVD brings you 100 minutes of pure fun and it's a great way to spend time with your little ones.\n\nHere's one of the films that truly focus on Easter and its representative all children, and adult, love - Easter Bunny. Hop stars Russell Brand as E.B., the Easter Bunny's son who'd rather become a drummer than be like his father. When he leaves for Hollywood he meet's James Marsden's Fred, an out of work human who wishes to become the next Easter Bunny. And then there's Carlos (voiced brilliantly by Hank Azaria) who wants to take over the entire organisation. Quite a premise, right? What makes this film fun to watch is live-action/animation comedy combo that brings the best of both worlds.\n\nCharlie Brown and his friends are back, this time on the best Easter Films list with Peanuts and Snoopy: It's the Easter Beagle. The first volume comes with two fun-filled adventures, It's the Easter Beagle Charlie Brown and Life is a Circus, Charlie Brown. In the first story, Linus believes no preparations for the holiday are necessary while Charlie Brown and the gang think there are things that need to be done if they want for the Easter Beagle to arrive. What do you think? In the second story, Snoopy falls in love, leaves home and in the end, becomes a big star. What a lovely way to spend some cartoon time with your youngest!\n\nEaster is a special time which is religiously focused on the resurrection of Jesus Christ, and that's why Mel Gibson's The Passion of the Christ deserves a spot on the best Easter Films list. Mel Gibson started his career as an actor, but he also directed several critically acclaimed films - The Passion of the Christ starring Jim Caviezel being one of them. The film shows a profound story of courage and sacrifice, while depicting the final twelve hours in the life of Jesus Christ.

You can rent it on DVD where it's fully restored to its original theatrical brilliance. The film was nominated for five Oscars including best cinematography, special effects, and best music score. Special bit of trivia connected to this film is that Telly Savalas shaved his head bald for his role as Pontius Pilate, and kept his head shaved for the rest of his life.\n\nYou may wonder why Night of the Lepus found its way on the best Easter Films list. The quote from the film sums it up best, as well as its genre: \"Ladies and gentlemen, attention! There is a herd of killer rabbits headed this way...\". The 1972 film stars Stuart Whitman, Janet Leigh and Rory Calhoun among others and it's directed by William F. Claxton. Additionally, it's best noted that this is not a film intended for the whole family, but if you enjoy in a horror film, then this is your perfect title to watch this Easter.\n\nIs there an Easter without chocolate bunny and is there the best Easter Films list without Chocolat? Hardly. Chocolat is a charming and witty comedy, drama and romance directed by Lasse Hallstrom - all mixed in one film. The cast is quite amazing with names such as Juliette Binoche, Johnny Deep, Judi Dench, Alfred Molina, Carrie-Anne Moss, and we could go on for a while. When Vianne comes to a tranquil French town with her daughter, and opens a chocolate shop that's where the adventure begins. The film was nominated for five Oscars, unfortunately won none, including best picture, best actress in a leading and supporting role, screenplay and music.\n\nSteel Magnolias is probably one of the best films that show the strength of a female friendship, but also a film that deserves to find its place on the best Easter Films list. Steel Magnolias follows six different women, played by a star-studded cast: Julia Robert, Sally Field, Dolly Parton, Olympia Dukakis, Shirley MacLaine and Daryl Hannah. Through the years, the film is full of emotions that will make you want to see it again. The plot concludes on Easter morning when Annelle goes into labour during an Easter egg hunt.
