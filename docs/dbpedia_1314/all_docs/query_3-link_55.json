Its length will be one hundred miles. So far, sixty-four miles have been built, from St. Guillaume, on the Sorel and Drummondville section of the South Eastern, to Bedford, one of its principal points.\n\nThis important village, the most populous but one in the fine county of which it is the chef-lieu, is situated in the large and wealthy township of Stanbridge, and is about one mile in length; or, it may be described as consisting of two separate villages that distance apart, the connecting street being well built upon throughout its entire length, giving it, unless one is unnecessarily precise and critical, the appearance of one continuous town. The one is distinguished from the other by the prefix upper or lower, as the case may be, though the lower village is commonly known as Bedford, while the other is generally spoken of as Upper Bedford, each having its own post office. The distinction, as a matter of fact, is non-existant; in reality they may be said to be one and the same place, and, speaking of them in this sense, there is probably no other town, either in the county or the Eastern Townships, which, within the past few years, has made more rapid progress in population and material resources.\n\nBedford is distant from Abbott’s Corner 13 miles, Adamsville 19, Allen’s Corner 19, Clarenceville 17, Des Rivieres Station 6, Dunham 10½.

Originally it belonged to the Sieur Foucault, to whom, it was granted in 1733 by the Marquis de Beauharnois, the then Governor, the grant being subsequently confirmed by the King of France.\n\nAs for the Seigniory of Noyan, a captain of marines, Chavoy de Noyan by name, got a grant of it in 1733 from the same Governor, said grant being afterwards ratified by the King. By the treaty of Paris, signed May 16th 1763, Canada and its adjacent territories became a possession of Great Britain, and one of the results of this transfer was that this seigniory passed into the hands of Gabriel Christie, Esq., and was known as Christie’s Manor. It was not till after Canada was a British colony that any settlements were made in either of the seigniories named. The pioneers or first comers were of many origins, the southern part of Noyan, in common with Foucault, being settled principally by families of English, Scotch, Irish and German extraction.\n\nThe seigniories are divided into two parishes: St. George de Clarenceville and St. Thomas de Foucault, the first comprising the eastern parts, and the last the western portions of both.\n\nThe land is extremely productive, yielding a full return for the labor bestowed upon it; its surface is generally level, and, with the exception of a little swampy land in the parish of St. George de Clarenceville, is all under a state of advanced cultivation.\n\nClarenceville, pleasantly situated at the junction of four roads, in this parish, is the chief centre of trade for the whole section of country comprised in Foucault and Noyan, and is partly in the one, and partly in the other.\n\nWhere the four roads meet is a square, in the centre of which stands a tall liberty poll, emblematic of the freedom which we all enjoy. To the east are the Episcopalian and Canada Methodist Churches, both handsome edifices and ornaments to the village; opposite is the Clarenceville hotel. From the remaining sides streets diverge north and south, some portions of them being, as the saying is, as pretty as a picture.\n\nClarenceville is quite near the dominions of our hugh (sic) neighbor “Uncle Sam”, the boundary line separating the possessions of the “British Lion” from those of the “American Eagle” being but four miles distant as applied to the State of Vermont, and eight to that of New York. It is a port of entry. For the year ending June 30th, 1879, the imports were $5,020, the duties collected being $974.21.\n\nClarenceville is distant from Alburgh Springs, Vt., 5 miles; Rouse’s Point, N.Y., 10 miles; from the Richelieu river, 2-½ miles, in crossing which to the Lacolle Station of the Grand Trunk Railway, ½ mile from the shore, a fine view of Fort Lennox, on Isle aux Noix, the properly of the Canadian Government, is had. To Bedford, the chef-lieu of the county, it is 16 miles; to Missisquoi Bay, 4 miles; and to the pretty and picturesque village of Philipsburg on its northern bank, 12 miles. Mails daily.

E. loyalist from the State of New York, who, after remaining in Philipsburg for sixteen years, came here in 1793, and settled on the south side of the river which now furnishes the power used for the running of the flouring mills of G. K. Nesbitt, Esq., the woollen manufactory of the Messrs. W. & A. Morison, and the Freeport mills, one half mile from Cowansville, of which Percival L. Cowan is the proprietor. Two years after his arrival the Captain built a grist mill, and a good idea of the changes which time has since brought about can be obtained from the mention of the fact that the set of stones required for this mill, which were conveyed here from Philipsburg by way of Dunham, could not be carried from the latter place until a road had been made through the forest expressly for that purpose.\n\nThe next settler was A. M. Bachelor, from the United States; and Augustus Winchester, after residing for some time previously in the adjoining village of Sweetsburg, on the grounds on which is now erected the dwelling of the Hon. Geo. B. Baker, the popular representative of the County of Missisquoi in the House of Commons, was the third. With one exception, Peter Cowan, Esq., the present sheriff for the District of Bedford, was the next. He occupied a store and dwelling on what is now known as South street, since changed into a private residence, now that of John Massie, sen., the father of the proprietor of “The Cowansville Observer”. When the third house had been erected in the new settlement, which Captain Ruiter had the honer of founding, he bestowed upon it the name of Nelsonville, in remembrance and as an appreciation of the great talents of Admiral Lord Nelson, whose axiom, “England expects every man to do his duty,” is “as familiar in our mouths as household words.”\n\nForty-three years ago, that is in 1836, the village contained but four houses, although in its near vicinity there was one, perhaps two, others, while its population, all told, was not more than forty.\n\nSkipping the intervening period, and passing on to the present time, a few additional remarks in reference to this really thriving place may not prove devoid of interest:\n\nCowansville is situated in the Township of Dunham, and, as already intimated, was originally called Nelsonville. It was found, however, that mail matter addressed to Nelsonville sometimes found its way to a place called Nelson, in the then Province of Upper Canada; it was therefore decided to change its name, and a public meeting of the inhabitants having been called, it was agreed that the designation of the post office should be changed to Cowansville, after the then postmaster, Peter Cowan, Esq.\n\nPrevious to the erection of the court house and jail in Sweetsburg, in 1861 the legal business of the Counties of Brome, Missisquoi and Shefford, comprising the District of Bedford, was done at this place, and all legal documents executed here were dated at Nelsonville.\n\nSome eight years ago a marked impetus was given to the growth of the village by the building of the South Eastern Railway, and so rapid has been the advancement since that time that to-day it must be considered as one of the most important stations on the line. The railway supplied advantages in the transportation of freight, which were improved by many of those doing business here, and notably by G. K. Nesbitt, Esq., mill owner, who at once went largely into the manufacture of flour and the grain and feed business, which he still carries on on an extensive scale. About the same period (in 1871) the Eastern Townships Bank opened a branch of their business here, under the management of W. J. Briggs, Esq., (now acting in the same position for this bank at Waterloo,) who was succeeded about three years ago by James Mackinnon, Esq. So rapidly did the banking business grow that the Board of Directors deemed it advisable to erect a suitable building for their purposes in this village, and now the bank forms one of the most attractive and prominent edifices in the place.\n\nOne thing which probably did very much in developing the interests of Cowansville was the establishing of a newspaper here. The Cowansville Observer was commenced in September, 1870, by John Massie, jr., Esq., who was assisted in its editorial management during the first two years by W. W. Lynch, Esq., the popular member of the Quebec Legislature for Brome county. The Observer started under anything but favorable prospects, the District of Bedford Times having suspended publication at Sweetsburg only about nine months previously; but its founder, being a practical printer of considerable experience in some of the cities of Canada and the United States, and being possessed of an indomitable perseverance, which is bound to succeed in nearly anything he undertakes, conceived the idea of devoting a considerable space to matters transpiring within a radius of twenty miles, a course which brought down upon him the sarcasm of many of his contemporaries for a time, but a course which\n\nhe has lived to see copied by these same contemporaries, who previously deemed nothing short of a burglary, murder or suicide of sufficient importance to occupy their space.\n\nThe severe financial depression which has hung like a darkening cloud over the land for the past five years — a cloud, however, through which the light of returning prosperity begins to glimmer — was, of course, felt here as, elsewhere, several business houses being obliged to succumb to the pressure of the times. At present, however, there are a number of shrewd and energetic men engaged in commercial enterprise in Cowansville whose views in regard to the manner in which success in business is to be\n\nobtained, being sound, business-like and fully abreast of the times in which they live, attract a large amount of trade from an unusually large section of the surrounding country.\n\nThere is a very large export business done in this place in butter and cheese, and nowhere in the Eastern Townships is the competition in these articles keener, the market at Cowansville having various shippers to the cities in the United States and Europe.\n\nManufacturing enterprises have also a fair share of attention. Besides Mr. Nesbitt’s mill, already referred to, Mr. Brewer of the Cowansville carriage factory turns out a large number of buggies, waggons, sleighs, and so forth, while Mr. Sloggett’s furniture establishment is equal to any demands that may be made upon it for the furnishing of the houses of the inhabitants of this section; then there is the firm of W. & A. Morison, woollen manufacturers, who in addition to doing a large custom business, manufacture large quantities of blankets for exportation.\n\nAbout half a mile from the village is a place called Freeport, which, like Cowansville, is situated on the south fork of the Yamaska River. Here are located the Freeport Mills the property of Percival L. Cowan, Esq.\n\nCowansville is distant from Abbott’s Corner 13 miles, Adamsville (Brome Co.) 6 miles, Bedford 16 miles, Boscobel (Shefford Co.) 33 miles, Clarenceville 33 miles, Dunham (Dunham Flats) 6 miles, Frelighsburg 12 miles, Frost Village (Shefford Co.) 19 miles, Granby (Shefford Co.) 16 miles, Knowlton (Brome Co.) 12 miles, Lawrenceville (Shefford Co.) 30 miles, Mansonville (Brome Co.) 30 miles, Noyan or St. Thomas, 36 miles, Pigeon Hill 17 miles, Philipsburg 24 miles, Roxton Falls (Shefford Co.) 34 miles, Sutton Flats (Brome Co.) 11 miles, Sweetsburg 1 mile and 6-10, Stanbridge East 12 miles, St. Johns (St. Johns Co ) 32 miles, Waterloo (Shefford Co.) 21 miles, and Farnham 15 miles, from Montreal 56, Kingston 228, Toronto 389, Hamilton 426, St. Catharines 458, Niagara Falls 470, London 504, and Detroit, Mich., 614 miles; via Montreal from Quebec 228, St. John, N.B., 636, Halifax, N.S., 712, Charlottetown, P.

M. Day’s “History of the Eastern Townships”, where it is further stated that this is said to be the first township erected in Lower Canada. The village of Dunham is situated in the parish of Ste. Croix in this township, and for a new country is quite ancient. It dates back as far as 1795, and, as the surrounding rural district became settled and its resources developed, it gradually assumed considerable importance as a business centre. Seventy-two years from the date of its foundation, or, in other words and to be very exact, on the 1st of January, 1867, it was incorporated. Andrew Ten Eyck was one of those to whom the grant was made, and we find him mentioned as one of the earliest inhabitants, if not the very first, coming as he did from New Jersey in 1793. Joseph Baker and family arrived in 1799 from Petersham, Mass., after a wearisome and hazardous journey in primitive style. The same year, or about the same time, George Shufelt, Henry Church, Jacob Ruiter, John Church, and Isaac Gleason, are added to the list of settlers. Many of these names are yet familiar among the present population. Failing, for reasons which it is not necessary to specify here, to secure close railway connections, its business has not increased of late years at the rate that it might have done had the opposite been the case. Nevertheless, nothing can deprive the village of its beautiful situation and romantic scenery. As a delightful summer retreat, Dunham can scarcely be surpassed, having in almost every direction delightful drives on excellent roads. From several points there are views of the fine mountain ranges, and from others a large portion of the valley of the St. Lawrence including, on clear days, the Montreal Mountain. A short drive takes the visitor to a delightful sheet of water, once called Selby Lake, now known as the Dunham pond, which covers about 600 acres, always smooth for boating and well supplied with fish.\n\nThe Dunham Ladies’ College, for the higher education of young ladies, adds to the interest of the village. The site has been well chosen, being elevated, surrounded by beautiful and well-wooded hills with mountains in the distance. The College buildings were specially designed for the purposes for which they are used. The rooms are large, lofty, and well-ventilated, and the building is heated throughout by hot-air. The public rooms consist of a large, with several smaller class rooms, reception-room and drawing-room, which are devoted to the uses of students and their friends and visitors, of course under proper supervision. The building is surrounded on three sides by a broad and spacious verandah. Its length is 81 feet; breadth 52 feet, and consists of a basement and three stories. The two uppermost stories, are divided off into sleeping apartments, and are sufficient to accommodate 80 boarders.\n\nThe necessity for an institution devoted to the higher education of women having long been felt by churchmen throughout the diocese, some six years ago, at a meeting of the Deanery of Bedford, a committee of four clergymen, with Archdeacon Lindsay as chairman, was appointed to enquire into the possibility of realizing the wishes of the public. After much discussion, Dunham was chosen as the site of a Ladies’ College, the people of Dunham and its vicinity giving the necessary land, and some $3,000 or\n\n$4,000 towards the institution. An Act of Incorporation was obtained, and one clergyman and one layman from each parish of the Deanery, with the Lord Bishop of Montreal as President, and Archdeacon Lindsay as Vice-President, were to compose the Corporation of the Dunham Ladies’ College. A building committee was formed, which decided to wait until $5,000 could be raised to build the College, and at least the same sum as an endowment fund Rev. Canon Henderson, of Montreal, then Rector of Dunham, upon whom fell the greater part of the work, never lost courage, though encountering many obstacles, and working under great difficulties. Finally sufficient money was collected to commence the College, and when he left Dunham, in 1877, to take his present position as Principal of the Theological College, Montreal, Canon Henderson had the satisfaction of leaving Dunham College almost completed.\n\nIn September, 1875, the corporation handed over the building to Mrs. Oakley, then Miss Brandford Griffith, who, with an able staff of teachers, immediately set to work to place the Dunham Ladies’ College in the first rank of such institutions. From the beginning the success of the undertaking was secured. Nearly sixty pupils have attended during the past year. At the meeting of the Corporation at Dunham, February 25th, 1879, the Corporation vested their powers in the Bishop, who leased the College to Mrs. Oakley, then Miss Brandford Griffith, for a term of five years.\n\nThe Dunham Graded School is another of the institutions of the place which should not be passed over in silence. It is of three grades, having a head master and two assistant teachers. It is affiliated to McGill College University, and its course of study covers the second year of a University course. There are four terms of ten weeks each, and the tuition of the intermediate and senior grades respectively is 30 and 45 cents a week. Board can be had in the village for $2.50 a week. The present head master has taught twenty-three years in different schools in England and Canada.\n\nFrom a manufacturing point of view Dunham is not of as much importance as some other localities in the country. It, however, contains one (perhaps more) concern of very long standing — Dunning’s tannery being one of the oldest establishments in this section of the country. It was established about fitly years ago by Mr. Orrin Dunning, by whom it was very successfully carried on till the period of his decease, in 1861. His son Edward then conducted the business for a few years, and in 1871 the present owner, Mr. Orrin S. Dunning, assumed the proprietorship.\n\nAbout half a mile from the village is a settlement called Chapel Corner, where N. L. Whitcomb has a sash, door and blind factory and planing mill run by water power, supplied by a stream running through this place from Stevens’ pond, about three miles east. In addition to the above, Mr. Whitcomb also manufactures furniture of all descriptions, using none but kiln-dried, thoroughly seasoned, lumber for that purpose.\n\nIn the matter of hotels Dunham holds its own with any village in the county. The Phoenix House, of which Mr. Hiram Seeley is the proprietor, cannot be too highly commended. Amongst the travelling public it is always mentioned in terms of the strongest commendation.\n\nDunham is distant from Bedford, the chef-lieu of the county, 9 miles; from Cowansville and Frelighsburg, 6 miles; from Stanbridge East, a station on the Montreal, Portland and Boston Railway, 6 miles, and from Stanbridge Station, on the Central Vermont Railway, 11 miles.

Andrew, farmer\n\nTruax Mrs. George, widow\n\nFARNHAM –\n\nIn 1850 the parish of St. Romuald de Farnham was formed out of the west part of the township of Farnham. In 1860 a part of this parish was erected into the village of West Farnham, and in 1876 this village was incorporated as a town, the name being changed to Farnham.\n\nThe progress of Farnham has been sufficiently rapid to make it somewhat exceptional to the ordinary rate of increase by which a settlement first becomes a hamlet, then a village, afterwards a town, and finally a city. Before this place attains the latter dignity, one more step on the gradually ascending ladder of importance requires to be taken. Judging from the past this consummation ought to be attained in the course of —, but it is better not to fix a date, for prophets most always come to grief.\n\nFarnham is pleasantly built on both banks of the Yamaska river, a substantial bridge spanning the useful as well as pretty stream which flows through it. It possesses unusually good water privileges, already made available to a considerable extent for woolen, saw, shingle, lath, planing and flour mills, as well as other manufacturing industries. The West Farnham Woollen Mills, of which Mrs. A. Stark is the proprietress, is one of the most important industries in the place.\n\nMr. Daniel B. Meigs, the mayor of the town, is a large employer of labor in the various industries which he carries on, which include saw and grist mills, planing, shingle and lath mills, a butter tub factory, and so forth. A bonus of $25,000 has been voted by the town towards the erection of a large cotton factory, which when completed will be one of the most extensive in the province, and furnish employment to a great number of hands. Did space permit, a full description of these as well as other existent manufacturing concerns in the town might be inserted. All requisite business particulars are, however, given in reference to them in the following alphabetical directory of the place, and that, for this occasion, must suffice. Farnham is well supplied with hotels, one of the most popular and best patronized being the American house, of which Mr. L. N. Collier has been the proprietor for the past six years. This hotel is well and favorably known throughout the Province, and enjoys a large amount of commercial and other patronage. Guests will find it kept in first-class style, and meet with every attention from the obliging proprietor. It is very conveniently situated within a few minutes walk of the depots of the several railway lines running through the town, the post office, Court house and town hall and chief mercantile establishments; attached is also a good livery.\n\nThe public buildings in Farnham area noteworthy feature of the place; a glance at them will be all that will be attempted. The convent of the Sisters of the Presentation of Mary cost $8,000; a hospital under the direction of the Sisters of Charity $8,000; the College of West Farnham, presided over by the Priests of the order of the Holy Cross, $7,000; the Catholic Church $35,000, $16,000 of this amount being for interior decorations, making it the handsomest ecclesiastical edifice in the diocese.\n\nThe English Church, though not so costly as the buildings previously mentioned, serves in common with them to adorn the town. It is built of brick. The building used as the Town Hall and Court House cost $3,500, and is a good brick structure conveniently adapted to suit the purposes for which it was erected.\n\nThe one building in Farnham which is hardly up to the standard of what one would expect to find in a town of its size, importance and almost unequalled railroad facilities is the market. No doubt at some future day the present structure will be replaced by a building more worthy of the place. There is no doubt but that Farnham is one of the most important railway centres in the Province, and the roads that make it so are the Stanstead, Shefford and Chambly branch of the Central Vermont Railway, the South\n\nEastern Railway, the Montreal, Portland and Boston Railway and the Lake Champlain and St. Lawrence Junction Railway, trains on all of these lines stopping here. Terms of the Commissioners Court and Circuit and District Magistrates Courts are held here.\n\nFifty years ago the population was 0, twenty years after there were not half a dozen houses here; to-day the population is 2,500. Distant from St. Johns 14 miles, Montreal 41, Toronto 374, and Ottawa 167 miles.\n\nAbbreviations used: — Adv. advertisement; bds, boards; do, same place or same street; h, house; C. V.
