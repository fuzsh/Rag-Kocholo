The project, estimated to cost $2 million, was announced in a 22 Apr 1966 DV item, which stated that Chuck Jones, MGM’s head of animation, would direct. Jones and co-producer Les Goldman were said to be meeting with composers and lyricists at that time.\n\nThe film marked MGM’s first feature-length animated picture, according to the 30 Aug 1967 Var. Production began on 3 Apr 1967 with the shooting of live-action sequences in San Francisco, CA, and, later, at MGM studios in Culver City, CA, as noted in the 21 Apr 1967 DV and 25 Jan 1968 LAT. Jones initially estimated that the live-action sequences, which would serve as book-ends to the animated portion, would run a total of fifteen minutes, while the animation would run ninety minutes; however, the final running time of the film was ninety minutes in total.\n\nJones predicted in the 25 Jan 1968 LAT that he would complete 4,000 drawings before sending them to animators, to work on their own versions. The 9 Feb 1968 DV reported that layouts and designs were finished, and work on an estimated 7,200 feet of animated film was scheduled to begin in mid-Mar 1968. By 2 Oct 1969, post-production had begun, as noted in that day’s DV.\n\nThe Phantom Tollbooth opened on 24 Oct 1970 in sixty Los Angeles, CA, theaters, according to the 23 Oct 1970 ...\n\nMore Less\n\nAn article in the 25 Jan 1968 LAT stated that Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Inc.

It was scheduled to be screened at Saturday and Sunday matinees for two weekends, before moving on to other cities, where it would also play for two weekends only, the 29 Nov 1970 LAT reported. The LAT review described the “limited exposure” release pattern as “strange and sad,” and praised the picture as a welcome offering in the current market, said to be devoid of children’s pictures. The review also described Jones’s animation style as “distinctly post-Disney in its acknowledgment of the likes of poster-style, hard-edge painting and pop art generally.”\n\nLess\n\nUpon returning from school one day, Milo, a bored youth in San Francisco, California, finds a huge candy-striped package in his bedroom.
