Casper was directed by my husband Brad – we were not yet married, so apologies to the crew for our canoodling. Brad was chosen by his mentor Steven Spielberg to shoot this audacious film. There had never before been a film with computer-generated animated characters in scenes with human beings. The film took a solid two years to make, and it clearly stands the test of time. I am grateful to be a small part of Casper. Long live Amelia the Angel."
