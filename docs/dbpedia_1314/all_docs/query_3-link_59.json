        "text": "Monsters and Magic Trailers- Final\n\nBy: DJ Rodriguez\n\n(Author's Notes: Hello everyone! It is good to be back doing a Disney/Toho work here, even though it will be awhile till I make another one. I will explain why in a moment.\n\nBut first, I want to give praise and glory to God. Thank you Lord for being with me, thank you for helping me out in all that I do! I hope one day Jesus to really do you proud with the gift of imagination you have given me when I was born. I thank you also Jesus for helping with my family, my friends who are scattered worldwide & also for never giving up on either them or me! Thank you God for aiding me in my stories and I hope to stand firm and convicted in you in what I say, write and do!\n\nThis here will be the final trailer here for my series. This features the mini-novel I made that completely ends the Monsters and Magic series & it is Monsters and Magic Special: Sofia's Imagination! Yes, this will feature the multiple trailers that are for my Sofia the First/Toho crossover!\n\nIn my mind, the special is more or less like a TV special. You know, how a certain series brings about a finale with an episode that is longer than normal. Well, it is the same case for my mini-novel though it would be cool if one day it would be a movie like I thought for my other three novels.\n\nAnd now, I wish to thank those that did review in my previous chapter! Ahem…\n\nTo DRAGONDAVE45: Thank you for your review and the wonderful words from both you & the characters from Monster High and Firebreather! I really do appreciate all of their words and confidence! And also, I do wish the best of luck to you and Clawdeen, Duncan! And if you do want me to make a movie trailer for you that advertises & shows your story Monster High: Primal Hearts… I will do it! And I will do my best to make sure it honors you, the characters and plot of the story as well. Will have to go back and re-read it again to get a better, clear understanding so I can be sure to write a suitable trailer. But it will be worth it!\n\nTo Guest: I will think on it. No promises though, since not much of a big fan on live-action remakes at the moment from Disney.\n\nTo Kaiju-O Danny: Thanks for the review and the info! And if you wish to reboot the Monsters and Magic series in your own way, than you have my blessings and good luck! I only hope that you follow the guidelines I laid down in one of the epilogues in my Monsters and Magic Special: Sofia's Imagination mini-novel. As for the House of Mouse reacting to the movie Godzilla, Mothra and King Ghidorah: Giant Monsters All-Out Attack… just have to wait and see! It might be awhile before I get back to the Disney/Toho movie scene special, though. And also in checking out the anime you mentioned, I will look into it.\n\nTo Kearitona Sjachraelgil: Thank you my sweetheart for reading and reviewing this trailer! And again my lady love, your passionate and honest words and actions are always a sight to behold!\n\nAnd finally to Dreams Come True 996: To my very dear and wonderful friend… thank you so much for the review! I am glad that you enjoyed it and also thank you for answering my questions! I hope to hear from the DP gang as well since this is my final trailer series here. Again, your reviews are worth waiting for & I hope to hear from you again soon!\n\nI am still hoping and looking for any kind of pictures or videos that showcase/feature/promote any of my Disney/Toho works that I have made. Sad to say… nothing coming up. And also, no word yet on my eleventh attempt to inform Disney of my novels & mini-novel by old-school mail. I believe a twelfth attempt will have to be made soon. Not giving up at all! I really believe that the companies need my stories, so will do what I can to make my dream a reality! But I need some help in making it so.\n\nI also believe that I would like for all three movies to be done in the classic, animated way that it was done back in the golden age of Disney in the 1980s and 1990s. Same with Godzilla and the others in the classic way that was done back in the Showa & Heisei-era of Toho. So any kind of help in any way to promote my Disney/Toho works would be very much appreciated.\n\nOn a final note, will be working on my Star Vs. story for the time being. Going to turn it into a trilogy series like I did with my Monsters and Magic series, so wish me luck!\n\nI do not own Godzilla, any of the characters or items that officially belong to the Toho Company. I do not own any of the Disney characters or places that officially belong to the Walt Disney Company. I also do not own any named monsters or characters that have come from other companies such as Universal Studios, etc.\n\nThe four monsters Crab Cyclopes, Earth Eater, Firebird and Energy Beast come from the 1978 animated series Godzilla that was created by Hanna-Barbera. The series was developed by Dick Robbins & Duane Poole, directed by Ray Patterson, Carl Urbano, Oscar Dufau & George Gordon. Executive producers were William Hanna & Joseph Barbera, producer Doug Wildey. Production company was Hanna-Barbera Productions, distributors were Taft Broadcasting, Worldvision Enterprises, Great American Broadcasting, Turner Program Services, Warner Bros. Television Distribution, Classic Media, Dreamworks Classics & NBCUniversal Television Distribution. Original network release was NBC in the United States, Tokyo Channel 12 in Japan. Original release was September 1978 all the way to December 1979.\n\nI do own my OC creations that are listed in the novels and specials, some belonging to other Authors whom I ask for permission to use first.\n\nI do not own the series Sofia the First. It is created by Craig Gerber, directed by Jamie Mitchell & Larry Leichliter. Executive producers are also Jamie Mitchell & Larry Leichliter, production companies Disney Television Animation, Toon Animation Studios and TeamTO. Distributor are Disney-ABC Domestic Television. Original Network is Disney Junior, original release was Nov. 2012 and went on until September 2018.\n\nAlso, NO live-action remakes of any kind are in my stories, not even in this one. I only like/love the classic, original and REAL animated Disney movies and cartoons I grew up with as a kid. These new remakes/reboots of that are up now… no way! This is my stance, and I am sticking to it with conviction!\n\nNow, on with the trailers!)\n\nTrailer #1\n\nThe entire screen is black for a moment, than coming in first is the famous Toho Company, LTD logo. It stays on screen for a minute or two, than fades out and is soon replaced with the 3D image of Disney's Cinderella Castle logo. It stays on screen for a minute or two, than fades to than show… the Monsters and Magic insignia which is a fusion of the two logos. Mickey Mouse's famous head and ears appear, and inside the head is the kanji that is always shown in the Toho Company logo\n\nAnnouncer: In the Carpathian Mountains, western boundary of the land of Enchancia, a great evil is preparing itself…\n\nThe scene shows the sorceress Cosmina, who is gathering her army of Shadow Soldiers & Rock Rooks inside the belly of the mountain itself. The villainess is dressed in her sensual best, yet having an aura of evil that would make even Maleficent proud\n\nCosmina: The time has come, my minions of evil! We shall get our revenge for what the Good Fairies have done to Maleficent! And to do that… we must raze the kingdom they are in now down to the ground!\n\nThe scene changes again to show Cosmina using her magic to show to her minions the legendary Amulet of Avalor… and how it is around the neck of Sofia the First\n\nCosmina: Hehehe… but to make doubly sure that we succeed in my quest for vengeance, I must have this amulet! And I believe I know just how to do it… hehehe…\n\nCosmina laughs as the image fills up, and it shows the princess with her family; King Roland the II, Queen Miranda, Prince James and Princess Amber\n\nAnnouncer: The Royal family of Enchancia is captured by Sorceress Cosmina, a powerful witch that is thirsting to avenge her idol, Maleficent! And Sofia is going to need all the help she can get!\n\nThe scene shows the parents and siblings held in Cosmina's magical bubbles, and a magical viewing portal that shows Cosmina. Sofia holds her amulet tightly as her family vanished before her eyes! She heads back to Royal Prep Academy to call forth the Good Fairies\n\nSofia: *With the fairies* I need your help! My family has been taken by someone named Cosmina! I need to get them back!\n\nAnnouncer: But this time around, she has help from unexpected and high places!\n\nThe amulet glows, and a magical beam of purple energy erupted from it! It expanded and filled up outside of the Academy, and coming out from the cloud of magic was… Ariel, Melody, Cinderella, Tracy, Snow White, Kathrin, Belle, Mainard, Aurora, Edgard, Dianne, Alice, Regina, Rapunzel, Tinkerbell, Vidia, Silvermist, Fawn, Rosetta, Iridessa, Zarina, Jasmine, Malak, Azad, Anna, Elsa, Mama Odie, Radelle, Aubert LaBouff, Magali Macaire and Skylar Truman\n\nSofia: Wow!

Well… all of them are the bonded of the monsters from the other universe!\n\nAnnouncer: Sofia has human allies… but she is going to need firepower in order to combat Cosmina! And Heaven is going to answer her prayers!\n\nThe scene changes again, this time in the woods at night with Sofia and her new allies surrounded by the sorceress's Shadow Soldiers! However, a light shines down from above to halt everything! Coming down from the sky is an arch-angel, a warrior from Heaven itself\n\nSofia: Who are you?\n\n?: MY NAME IS JOSIAH, ONE OF THE CAPTAINS ANGELS OF THE LORD'S ARMY! JESUS CHRIST, AND HIS FATHER THE LORD, HAVE SEEN YOUR PLIGHT AND ARE HERE TO HELP YOU! EVERYONE… COME FORTH!\n\nThe warrior angel slashes the air, and a massive portal appears! Coming out one by one is Anguirus, Biolantte, Jet Jaguar, King Caesar, Mothra, Fire Rodan… and finally, the King of the Monsters himself… Heisei-era Godzilla as he roars to the mortals that he has returned\n\nAnnouncer: The monsters from the Toho universe are back, ready to aid Sofia and their bonded to rescue the Enchancia Royal Family! Prepare yourself as a monster rumble, the likes the Disney or Toho universe, has never seen before as Good & Evil clash in an epic struggle for supremacy!\n\nThe screen soon shows Cosmina holding up the corrupted amulet, and using it with her evil magic to bring to life her own creations! Now showing is the Earth Eater, the Firebird, the Energy Beast & Crab Cyclopes monsters! The scene shifts to show Cosmina's forces ready to clash with the Army of God as angels, arch-angels, and many mortals are on the side of Good\n\nA flash of light appears, and showing in the light are five figures… and soon a close-up of a certain princess's blue eyes, all ready to fight! After that, you see Godzilla and his fellow kaiju also ready to rumble! Godzilla lets out a huge roar before the screen goes black\n\nAnnouncer: For the very first time in history, Toho and Disney Junior proudly presents…\n\nThe scene than shows a large, well-made tome that shows etchings of the Toho monsters, the Amulet of Avalor… and the insignia that has been in all of the trilogies. The book opens up, and the page shows in bold letters these…\n\nAnnouncer: Monsters and Magic: Sofia's Imagination!\n\nAnnouncer: Rated PG-13! Parental Guidance suggested!\n\nTrailer #2\n\nThe screen is entirely black for a moment or two, than the Toho logo appears in the classic Heisei-era style with the words TOHO COMPANY, LTD under it. The words stay there for a few moments before they fade out, and the logo changes with additions of two semi-circles on top. It changes to show now Mickey Mouse's head and ears, the kanji words still within the large main circle. It has changed to become the Monsters and Magic insignia that stays on screen for a minute before fading away.\n\nThe screen changes to showcase a scene, which is a long dark hallway. On the left side are large paintings, each one done with expert love & care. On the right side are large panes of triangular windows, and outside a powerful storm is raging on as rain hits the windows with lighting flashing forth, followed by powerful thunder claps\n\nAnnouncer: There have been many villains/villainesses that have risen in the Disney world…\n\nThe camera slowly goes down the hallway, looking up to see that the pictures showcase a different bad guy and girl that has ever made the scene in Disney feature films and TV shows! First to show is Queen Grimhilde, a.k.a. the Wicked Queen from Snow White and the Seven Dwarves! Moving on down were more villains/villainesses: Lady Tremaine a.k.a. Wicked Stepmother, Gaston the strongman, Jafar the treacherous royal vizer, Ursula the sea witch, Captain Hook the scourge of Neverland, Shan-Yu the Hun leader, Hans the twisted prince & finally Mother Gothel the deceiving woman.\n\nThe scene than ended to be in what appeared to be a circular room with a fireplace that was roaring with a fire in it. It looked to be a library of sort, and in front of the fireplace was a tall person that was cloaked in a dark-purple robe that hid the figure well\n\nAnnouncer: But among them, only one has ever had a willing apprentice to follow in her footsteps. And she is ready to show the world on who she is… and who she is ready to avenge.\n\nThe fire turns from red to black with the edges containing a purple color. The person in the fireplace turned around slowly, the cloak soon vanishing from the body. All could now see indeed it was a woman, with a buxom chest & curves in all the right places that would drive men wild at the mere sight! The person was wearing fine clothing that looked to be exquisite and regal like royalty. While her face was hidden, one could see that her hair was a deep emerald-green hair with skin that was pale like moonlight. On top of her head was a tiara made of solid diamond. In her hands was a staff made of pine with a royal blue sapphire on top of it.\n\nThe camera zoomed in on the face… which looked up to show to the audience a beautiful face, with lips a light pink color, completely kissable. But it was her eyes that showed that she was seriously evil; eyes black as a clouded sky that blocked out the moon and stars, lighting flashing in her orbs\n\nAnnouncer: Meet Sorceress Cosmina Liviu, self-appointed apprentice to Maleficent herself! And she is ready to take revenge for the destruction of her role-model… by decimating those who ended her. And she is not going to do it in a small way…\n\nThe camera zooms away slightly from the sorceress, zooming upward to show a picture frame over the fireplace that is considerably larger than the others! In the frame is the picture of Maleficent; a split in the middle that shows her fairy-form on the left side, her dragon form on the right. Cosmina raises her staff and the tip of it glows bright blue, the room soon vanishing and everything now pitch black except for her. From the darkness emerge four towering beings, causing the camera to zoom out and away from Cosmina as she looks small now\n\nAnnouncer: Titans of the past come back to aid Cosmina in her quest for revenge! The Crab Cyclops…\n\nThe camera shows on the far left side said giant monster, which makes an unusual roar before snapping his pincers together with his single red eye flashing with light\n\nAnnouncer: Earth Eater…\n\nThe camera moved to the right to show that beside the giant humanoid crab monster was a beast that was on all fours. It had an unusual head shaped like an ant of sort, with brown all over with antenna that seemed to pulse yellow at the tips. It gave off an echoing roar that was eerie and unique\n\nAnnouncer: Firebird…\n\nThe camera moved again to the right to show an immense bird was like a cross between pterodactyl & a dragon! Its body was blazing red, with a yellow head crest & beat on its head which was attached to a long slim neck. Its eyes were pink with black reptilian slits as he screeched loudly\n\nAnnouncer: And finally the Energy Beast!\n\nThe camera moved to the right once more to showcase a rather large brown centipede with dark cream-colored pincers, and a fierce face that was unlike any seen on an insect! It let out a screech before its entire body glowed white… and soon transformed into Maleficent's dragon form\n\nAnnouncer: Cosmina and her minions are ready to make their debut, and the sorceress ready to claim her spot beside her deceased mentor in the all-new TV movie special…\n\nThe camera showcases all of the monsters for a few moments before zooming down towards Cosmina, who still standing where she was as she was in the middle now between the Earth Eater and Firebird. Dramatic music plays as the alluring but vengeful sorceress raised her staff again, and sent a blue lightning bolt from the staff to the camera! The whole scene was now covered in a deep royal blue field, followed by the unique roars of the giant monsters.\n\nOn the field appeared the insignia of Monsters and Magic, but entirely black with the kanji symbols written in purple flames. A cold, feminine laugh comes forth when Japanese kanji words appear in purple flames underneath the symbol. They stay like that for a few moments, than a light blue bolt of lightning from the lower area of the screen strikes and washes over the symbols.\n\nThey turn into English words, translated from the Japanese language. It shows the words in bold purple letters MONSTERS AND MAGIC SPECIAL: SOFIA'S IMAGINATION\n\nAnnouncer: Monsters and Magic Special: Sofia's Imagination! Get ready for the true finale of the Monsters and Magic trilogy movie series!\n\nAnnouncer: Monsters and Magic Special: Sofia's Imagination! Rated PG-13.\n\nTrailer #3\n\nThe screen is entirely black for a moment or two, than the Toho logo appears in the classic Heisei-era style with the words TOHO COMPANY, LTD under it. The words stay there for a few moments before they fade out, and the logo changes with additions of two semi-circles on top. It changes to show now Mickey Mouse's head and ears, the kanji words still within the large main circle. It has changed to become the Monsters and Magic insignia that stays on screen for a minute before fading away\n\nAnnouncer: Disney has always showcased the strange and wonderful beings; from fairies and pixies…\n\nThe screen soon starts to show clips from various animated Disney movies & specials. First to show is the beautiful blonde Blue Fairy from Pinocchio, followed by Tinkerbell from Peter Pan and Fairy Godmother Cateline from Cinderella\n\nAnnouncer: To magical creatures and supernatural beings…\n\nThe scenes change to show more clips; the immense dragon form of Maleficent from Sleeping Beauty, the skeletons from the Skeleton Dance clip, the infamous Headless Horseman from Sleepy Hollow & finally the gigantic form of Chernabog from Night on Bald Mountain\n\nAnnouncer: To beings who practice and use magic!\n\nThe scene changes yet again to showcase more clips from the Disney archives; the wizard Merlin and sorceress Madam Mim from The Sword in the Stone, Yen Sid from The Sorcerer's Apprentice, Elsa with her ice magic from Frozen & Rapunzel with her golden hair from Tangled\n\nAnnouncer: But for the first time ever, this summer in 2019, Disney presents a special where the highest of the high beings come down to Earth to aid Princess Sofia the First!\n\nThe screen goes black for a moment after showcasing Rapunzel, than changes to show a forest area where a pillar of blue light shot down from the heavens. Dramatic music plays as the camera shows that on the ground near the portal was Sofia the First herself, who looked at the light in awe. The pillar of light soon thinned down and dispersed completely. Standing now before the small princess of Enchancia was a man in Roman solider armor… with large majestic eagle wings emerging from his back\n\nAnnouncer: Now Disney will feature the first every presentation of…\n\nSolider: Looks to Sofia MY NAME IS JOSIAH, ONE OF THE CAPTAINS OF THE ANGELS OF THE LORD!\n\nAnnouncer: This summer, the Heavenly hosts go to the aid of Sofia to save her family and land from the rage of Sorceress Cosmina! And they are bringing in all that are willing to aid and fight with the princess!\n\nThe scene changes to show Josiah with a mighty force of angels & arch-angels, all ready to fight. It soon switches to show the various people who had bonded to certain giant monsters from another universe from all three Monsters and Magic movies. From Ariel & Melody from the first movie, to Jasmine and Rapunzel from the second movie & finally Elsa and Melody & Ariel from the third final movie\n\nAnnouncer: But this time, Heaven is going to send some truly big beings to help Sofia and her family… from the King of the Monsters…\n\nThe scene switches to show a glowing blue portal that shows emerging from it were taller than average human size order Toho monsters; King Caesar, Anguirus, Mothra in Adult-form with the Twin Fairies Lora and Moll on her being, Rodan, Jet Jaguar, Biollante… followed lastly by the most potent force of kaiju… Heisei-era Godzilla himself, who roared loudly after emerging\n\nAnnouncer: To the King of Kings Himself, Jesus Christ!\n\nThe scene switches from showing Godzilla to what appeared to be a prison cell… and coming down from the ceiling was a glowing, soft white light aura that surrounded a man that looked to be in his early thirties. With fair tan-skin, brown hair with same color goatee and mustache, brown eyes, wearing a simple white robe with a blue sash over his left shoulder. He wore simple sandals as well. And on his hands and feet were piercing marks… as if nails had gone through his palms and feet, freshly made\n\nAnnouncer: Heaven and Earth are going to be rocked as the biggest battle of all time occurs for the fate of not just Enchancia… but the entire known world! Join Sofia and her family, her new friends and giant monsters as they team up with the angels to fight in the all-new Disney TV movie premiere…\n\nThe scene changes to show Sofia now, wielding a new staff without the Amulet of Avalor on her. The staff glows in a brilliant white light… and the camera zooms quickly away as the light floods the area, and it shows that she is backed up by her family! Also with the families of the ones who had bonded to the great Toho monsters who are also with them. And heavenly light comes down from above as Josiah flies in, hovering directly above Sofia as he raises his sword and the tip flashes in a brilliance of holy light.\n\nHe then slashes at the screen, a brilliant crescent-shaped white energy flying to it until it covers the entire screen. On the field of white soon emerges the Toho logo appears, a golden circle showcasing the kanji symbols that are also gold. The logo soon sports two semi-circles on the top, now transformed to look like Mickey Mouse's head and ears as the kanji symbols remained.\n\nA large double-edged sword appears and slashes underneath the symbol, the weapon vanishing as Japanese kanji appeared underneath it in deep silver coloring. The symbols stayed for a few moments before they burned in silver fire, transforming into the English translation.

Her parents Queen Miranda & King Roland II behind her, all in their new Battle-wear outfits. Sofia smiles and raises her sword in her right hand, which glows a bright white color while the shield that has Godzilla's head insignia on it started to glow bright blue. She than thrusts the shield forward, and a brilliant blue beam of fire that is exactly like Godzilla's Radiation Death Breath streaks forward and strikes the screen!\n\nThe screen now shows a deep blue background field, sword noises sounding off as flashes appear in the center of the background. The Monsters and Magic insignia is cut into the field, the circles and kanji etchings in a deep green color. Than the sound that Mothra usually makes when flying rises up as golden sprinkles shower down on the screen. Most of the golden scale dust stop underneath the symbol and turn into Japanese kanji.
