X E W 0 R L E A X S : COMPILED AND PUBLISHED BY CHARLES GARDNER, No. 5 Commercial Place, Corner of Camp. 1861. EnU;reil, uccordiug to Act of Congress, in the year 1861, by Charles Gabi>xer, in the Clerk's Office of the District Court in the Eastern District of Louisiana. I> H E F A. O E. Tlie Twelfth Volume of the New Orleans Directory, is now offered to the public ; we trust more com- plete iu all its parts, than any previous number. The principal new feature of this number, is a Directory of the Planters of Louisiana, Arkansas, Missi- sippi and Texas, as far as iuformation could be obtained. A new arrangement with regard to certain firms has also been adopted in this number. Heretofore, we have arranged lirms alphabetically, according to the name of the senior partner, notwithstanding his given name did not appear in the style of the firm. In this number, all firms in which the given name of the senior partner does not appear, are ar- ranged alphabetically according to the style of the firm. A summary of the commercial history of New Orleans, with extended statistical tables running back beyond the beginning of the current century, and closing with a full statement of the commerce and trade of the city for the commercial year just expired, continued ; forming the introductory chapter of this volume, and will be found especially valuable to business men for purposes of reference. The work embraces, besides a general Directory, a full Business Directory ; the names of the individual mem- bers of all leading firms; Street and Levee Guides ; lists of all the public institutions, courts, oflices,etc., with the names of all City, State and Federal Oflicers; the names and locations of the Benevolent and Charitable Associations, with their oflicers, etc.; a list of Churches, with their locations, pastors, etc., and a large amount of other information, valuable not only to business men but to citizens of all classes. The publisher renews his acknowledgments to the citizens generally for l,'.,e readiness and kindness with which they have supijlied the information called for by his canvassers, and for the courtesy which he personally has met at their hands in the prosecution of his work.

In the Introduction to our Directory of last year, we took occasion to refer to the remarkable prosperity and £;rowth of New Orleans, as exhibited in the statistics of a series of years, which we placed before our patrons, and at the same time gave a brief summary of the Commercial history of this City and the State of Louisiana, from the beginning of the present century to the close of the year 1859. We remarked that only about ninety years ago, the population of New Orleans wasabout 3,200 souls, of which 1,800 were free whites, and that the City contained only 468 houses, and that during the next thirty-five years the increase would apjiear to have been only about 3,000 souls. The principal articles of trade, and their annual valuation, were as follows : Indigo 1 100,000 Deer Skins 80 000 Lumber fiO.OOO Naval Stores 12,000 Rice, Peas, Tallow, &c 8,000 making a value of about a quarter of a million of dollars for the leading staples dis- posed of in our market for one year, an amount considerably less than half the aver- age daily proceeds of the last commercial year. In J802 the crops of Louisiana were stated at 20,000 bales of Cotton, (averaging 300 lbs.) 5,000 hhds. of Sugar, and 3,000 lbs. of Indigo. The exports of the same year comprised 34,000 bales of Cotton, (14,000 more than the production,) 2,000 hhds. of Tobacco, 4,000 hhds. of Su<^ar 800 casks of Molasses, 50,000 bbls. of Flour, and 3,000 bbls. Pork and Beef. '' About the middle of the eighteenth century the jiopulation of the region which now constitutes the State of Louisiana, embraced 1,160 white males and 1,1.30 blacks, the distribution of the former being 800 in New Orleans, 200 in Pointe Coupee, and 60 in Natchitoches. In 1769 the population of the province had increased to a total of 13,538 whites and blacks, of which 1,800 whites and 1,400 blacks were in New Orleans. In 1803 the population of New Orleans was stated by official reports at 8,000 souls, and in 1805, when the City was chartered, the estimates varied between 6,000 and 8,000 souls ; since then the decennial census has shown the following results ; Population ot New Orleans, 1810 17 242 1820 27;i76 1830 46310 1840 102,193 \" \" 1850 126.376 \" \" \" I860 about 178,000 The population of the State of Louisiana, at the same periods, was as follows : Whites. Slaves. Free Col'd. 1810 34,311 34,660 7.SS5 1820 73,.383 69,064 10.476 1830 89,441 109,.'i38 16.710 1840 168,4.'i7 168,452 2.'S..W2 1850 255,491 244,809 17.462 I860 estimated at about Total, 76.566 153,407 216,739 3.')2.411 617.762 760,000 The trade of New Orleans exhibited some remarkable fluctuations from 1805 to 1820, embracing the period of the embargo and the war with England. The annual exports during the sixteen years, were as follows : Years. Domestic. Foreign.

These figures show only our commerce with foreign nations. That with domestic ports would largely swell the amounts of exports and imports, the former probably to a total of 1140,000,000, and the latter to 55,000,000, for the last year. The products of the interior received at New Orleans during the last eighteen years, is exhibited by the following table, which shows an increase during that period of more than three hundred per cent., and during the last ten years,of nearly one hundred per cent..

The commerce of the City with foreign and domestic ports and with the interior is conducted by an amount of shipping, the arrivals of which show an annual average of about 2,000 sea-going vessels and over 3,000 steamboats, as exhibited by the following table : Arrivals of Sea-going Vessels and Steamboats at the Port of JVcio Orleans each year from 1847 to 1860.

The decrease referred to, how- ever, is only in number. The vessels coming to this port have been of a larger class from year to year, and the arrivals have exhibited a large increase in tonnage, as will be seen by the following table which gives the arrivals of sea-going vessels at New Orleans for each ^.sco/ year since 1850, with their total tonnage, and the average ton- nage of each vessel.

Steamers, which ply on the waters of the farthest navi- gable brancncs of the Great River, still bring to us a large proportion of the products of their trade, but it is from regions near home that the great wealth of our commerce is derived. The advancing prosperity of the city is well exemplified by the annual increase in the value of the staples arriving from the Great West and Southwest and finding a market at this port, as shown by the following table, which is made up from the records of the New Orleans Price-Current, the statistics of which are of the most reliable character : Gardner's new Orleans directory.

The Opelousas and Great Western Railroad now extends to Berwick's Bay, a distance of eighty miles from the city, and is expected to reach New Iberia, an additional stretch of forty-five niile.s, during the iJext summer. These two roads are of great importance to New Orleans, opening to our trade as they do, the richest sections of the southern and south- western interior, the Opelousas and Great Western passing through an im|)ortnnt sec- tion of our sugar region and penetrating Texas, will soon connect us with Houston and other leading points in that State, and the connections of the Jackson and Great Northern road, branching through Louisiana, Mississippi and Ti nnessee, will together draw to our market increased amounts of the rich products of those respective regions, while the ready access of a market will still further stimulate production. In our last year's Directory we had occasion to congratulate our citizens upon the healthy condition of the city, and the entire absence of epidemical disease during the year then closed. We are now able to repeat our congratulations, as ihe year now closing has been remarkably free from disease, and we do not hesitate to pronounce New Orleans one of the healthiest cities in the United States. This condition of things may be attributed in a great measure to the improvements in grading, draining and paving our streets, which have been carried forward steadily and vigorously during the past few years, and which have led to other and greater improvements over our great thoroughfares, and in the suburbs, where princely residences are multiplying.
