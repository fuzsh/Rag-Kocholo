Seeing is believing when everyone’s favorite friendly ghost stars in this charming, live-action adventure from Steven Spielberg’s Amblin Entertainment. “Ghost therapist” Dr. James Harvey (Bill Pullman) and his daughter, Kat (Christina Ricci), have been hired by Carrigan Crittenden (Cathy Moriarty) and her partner-in-slime, Dibs (Eric Idle), to get rid of the spirits at drafty, old Whipstaff Manor. Sure enough, the place is haunted by The Ghostly Trio – Stretch, Stinkie and Fatso – who don’t believe “fleshies” should come anywhere near their haunted domain. But Kat soon meets another, very different kind of spirit: Casper, a good-natured ghost who's just looking for a friend. Can they all learn to live with each other? With dazzling special effects and undeniable humor, it’s a family friendly adventure that’s ghostly fun for everyone!",

        "text": "Casper is a deeply tragic yet oddly wholesome coming-of-age tale about loneliness and grief. Though the film is essentially a meditation on death, it isn’t all doom and gloom. It still has its zany moments and mid-90s charm.\n\nOctober 25, 2023\n\nMore like a Cinderella story than a gothic horror, this really was one of the most under-rated movies of the 1990s and should keep viewers of all ages engrossed on a slow summer holiday day.\n\nJanuary 6, 2022\n\nAll these years later, Casper has managed to stick around thanks to it offering a pleasant blend of what audiences expect from a kids movie and some weightier thematic fare.\n\nMay 24, 2020"
