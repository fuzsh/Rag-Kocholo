        "text": "Quick facts for kids\n\nCasper the Friendly Ghost\n\nCover of Casper the Friendly Ghost #1 (March 1991)\n\nPublication information Publisher Famous Studios (animation)\n\nHarvey Comics (comic books) First appearance The Friendly Ghost (1939 children's book and 1945 animated cartoon) Created by Seymour Reit, Joe Oriolo and Vincent E. Valentine II In-story information Full name Casper McFadden (1995 film) Species Ghost (deceased human in some versions)\n\nCasper the Friendly Ghost is the protagonist of the Famous Studios theatrical animated cartoon series of the same name. He is a pleasant, personable and translucent ghost, but often criticized by his three wicked uncles, the Ghostly Trio.\n\nThe character was featured in 55 theatrical cartoons made between 1945 and 1959. The character has been featured in comic books published by Harvey Comics since 1952, and Harvey purchased the character outright in 1959. Casper became one of Harvey's most popular characters, headlining dozens of comic book titles.\n\nFollowing Harvey's purchase of the character, he appeared in five television series: Matty's Funday Funnies (1959–1961), The New Casper Cartoon Show (1963–1970), Casper and the Angels (1979–1980), The Spooktacular New Adventures of Casper (1996–1998) and Casper's Scare School (2009–2012). The character has also made his theatrical appearance in the live-action film adaptation released by Universal Pictures, Casper (1995), and would later appear in four direct-to-video and made-for-TV follow-up films.\n\nCreation of Casper the Friendly Ghost\n\nCasper was created in the late 1930s by Seymour Reit and Joe Oriolo, the former devising the idea for the character and the latter providing illustrations. Initially intended as the basis for a 1939 children's storybook, there was at first little interest in their idea. When Reit was away on military service during World War II before the book was released, Oriolo sold the rights to the book to Paramount Pictures' Famous Studios animation division for a total of $175. This one-time payment was all that he received, missing out on a share of the revenue earned from the films, comic books and merchandising to come.\n\nThe Friendly Ghost, the first Noveltoon to feature Casper, was released by Paramount in 1945 with a few differences from the book. In the cartoon adaptation, Casper is a cute ghost-child with a New York accent who inhabits a haunted house along with a community of adult ghosts who delight in scaring the living. Casper, however, is a nonconformist among ghosts: he would prefer to make friends with people. He packs up his belongings and goes out into the world, hoping to find friends. However, the animals that he meets (a rooster, a mole, a cat, a mouse named Herman, and a group of hens) take one horrified look at him, scream: \"A ghost!\" and run off in the other direction. Casper then meets two children named Bonnie and Johnny who become his friends. The children's mother, apparently widowed and impoverished, at first is frightened of Casper, but later welcomes him into the family after he unintentionally frightens off a greedy landlord, who, unwilling to own a \"haunted\" house, tears up the mortgage and gives her the house outright. The short ends with the mother kissing Bonnie, Johnny, and Casper as she sends them off to school, with Casper wearing clothing as if he were a living child.\n\nCasper appeared in two more subsequent cartoons, There's Good Boos To-Night and A Haunting We Will Go. There's Good Boos To-Night differs wildly from later Casper cartoons: although the theme of Casper trying to find a friend and failing in these attempts before succeeding also occurs in later cartoons, the tone of this short turns remarkably dark when a hunter and his dogs appear, chasing the little fox cub named Ferdie that Casper has befriended. Although Casper scares the hunter and dogs away, Casper discovers Ferdie dead after a harrowing chase scene. Happily, however, Ferdie returns as a ghost to join his friend Casper in the afterlife.\n\nThese were later adapted into Noveltoons before Paramount started a Casper the Friendly Ghost series in 1950, and ran the theatrical releases until summer 1959. Although having much success, the series was later criticized by animation historians and viewers, mainly due to the story of each entry of the series as being largely the same: Casper (now slightly thinner than the pudgy figure that appeared in the earlier cartoons) escapes from the afterlife of a regular ghost because he finds that scaring people can be tiresome year after year, tries to find friends but inadvertently scares almost everyone, and finally finds a (cute little) friend, whom he saves from some sort of fate, leading to his acceptance by those initially scared of him. In 1955, composer Winston Sharples composed an instrumental theme for Casper's cartoons.\n\nHarvey Comics\n\nCasper was first published in comics form in August 1949 by St. John Publications, running for five issues until September 1951. In 1952, Alfred Harvey, founder and publisher of Harvey Comics began producing Casper comic books. Casper first appeared in Harvey Comics Hits #61 (Oct 1952), and then moved to a solo book with Casper the Friendly Ghost #7 (December 1952). In 1959, Harvey purchased the rights to the character outright.\n\nCasper went on to headline a large number of comic book series, as well as appearing in back up stories and guest appearances in other titles. The Casper series inspired three popular spinoffs: Spooky the Tuff Little Ghost, Wendy the Good Little Witch, and The Ghostly Trio. Casper's titles include:\n\nIn 2009, a new Casper comic was published, called Casper and the Spectrals by Arden Entertainment. Much like The Man of Steel and Batman: Year One did with their respective characters, it revamped Casper and several other Harvey characters for a new audience. After selling 6,400 copies of the first comic, the last two issues were published in 2010.\n\nTelevision\n\nCasper has starred in five television shows:\n\nMatty's Funday Funnies (1959–1961)\n\nThe New Casper Cartoon Show (1963–1970)\n\nCasper and the Angels (1979–1980)\n\nThe Spooktacular New Adventures of Casper (1996–1998)\n\nCasper's Scare School (2009–2012)\n\nAfter Harvey bought the rights to Casper and many other Famous properties in 1959 (including Herman and Katnip, Little Audrey, and Baby Huey), they began broadcasting the post-September 1950 theatrical Famous shorts on a television show sponsored by Mattel Toys titled Matty's Funday Funnies on ABC in 1959 which introduced the Barbie doll to the public. The other Famous produced Casper cartoons had already been acquired by television distributor U.M. & M. TV Corporation in 1956. U.M. & M. retitled just \"A Haunting We Will Go\", but credited \"Featuring Casper The Friendly Ghost\" as \"Featuring Casper's Friendly Ghost\".\n\nNew cartoons were created for The New Casper Cartoon Show in 1963, also on ABC. The original Casper cartoons were syndicated under the title Harveytoons (initially repackaged as Casper and Company) in 1963 and ran continually until the mid-90s. Casper has remained popular in reruns and merchandising.\n\nHanna-Barbera Productions also gave Casper two holiday specials, Casper's First Christmas (which also starred Yogi Bear, Huckleberry Hound, Snagglepuss, Quick Draw McGraw, Augie Doggie and Doggie Daddy) and Casper's Halloween Special (aka Casper Saves Halloween), and also the Saturday morning cartoon series Casper and the Angels (an animated takeoff on two live action hit shows Charlie's Angels and \"CHiPS\") in the autumn of 1979, all on NBC. Also featured on the NBC version was a big ghost named Hairy Scary (voiced by John Stephenson). None of Casper's original co-stars appeared in the show.\n\nIn 1996, Amblin Entertainment and Universal Cartoon Studios created a new Casper series for Fox Kids called The Spooktacular New Adventures of Casper, based on the 1995 feature, that lasted two years and was never seen on television again after 1998. Two live-action direct-to-video follow-ups to the film, Casper: A Spirited Beginning and Casper Meets Wendy (which introduced Hilary Duff as fellow Harvey Comics character Wendy the Good Little Witch), were made. They were followed by Casper's Haunted Christmas (starring Spooky and Poil from the comics and animated spin-off of the first movie), and Casper's Scare School, which were done entirely in CGI with no live-action elements. These films are often referred to as being \"prequels\" to the 1995 feature despite the fact that they heartily contradict the feature and do not appear to even take place in the same universe.\n\nIn 2007, MoonScoop Group, in association with Classic Media, TF1 et DQ, produced a TV show of 52 X 12 named Casper's Scare School.\n\nIn 2020, Casper appeared in a supporting role in the \"Scare Bud\" episode of Harvey Girls Forever!, a series based on Harvey Comics characters.\n\nFilms\n\nMain articles: Casper the Friendly Ghost filmography and Casper the Friendly Ghost in film\n\nThe Famous Studios version of Casper was scheduled to appear as a cameo in the deleted scene \"Acme's Funeral\" from the 1988 film Who Framed Roger Rabbit.\n\nNumerous Casper cartoons were released on home video by Universal Studios (via MCA Inc.), which also adapted the friendly ghost into a live-action feature film titled Casper in 1995, where he and his wicked uncles, the Ghostly Trio, were rendered via computer animation, which initially created the first CGI lead character in a film. The film constructed a back-story for the character and is the only time in the series that the question of his death has been addressed. According to the film, Casper was a twelve-year-old boy living in Whipstaff Manor with his inventor father J.T. McFadden until he died from pneumonia after playing out in the cold until it was past nightfall.\n\nIn 2001, Harvey Entertainment was acquired by Classic Media which, until 2012, licensed the Harvey properties including Casper.\n\nCasper made a cameo in a MetLife commercial along with several other cartoon characters in 2012. Later that same year, Classic Media was acquired by DreamWorks Animation, which in turn would be acquired by NBCUniversal in 2016, and thus Universal Studios, the producer of the original live-action feature film, now manages the rights to the character and other related characters in addition to regaining the rights to Casper's Haunted Christmas (which Universal itself originally released in late 2000).\n\nIn 2019, Casper made an appearance in a GEICO commercial.\n\nActors who have voiced or portrayed Casper\n\nAn unknown child actor voiced Casper in The Friendly Ghost in 1945, There's Good Boos To-Night in 1948 and A Haunting We Will Go in 1949.\n\nAlan Shay and radio actress Cecil Roy voiced Casper in the majority of the Famous Studios cartoons.\n\nJune Foray provided the voice for Mattel's Talking Casper the Friendly Ghost Doll in 1961.\n\nMae Questel provided the voice in Golden Records' Casper the Friendly Ghost and Little Audrey Says in 1962.\n\nNorma MacMillan and Ginny Tyler provided the voice in The New Casper Cartoon Show.\n\nJulie McWhirter provided the voice in Casper and the Angels.\n\nJoanna Ruiz provided the voice for a British dub in 1991.\n\nChristopher Miron Allport voiced Casper in an early 1990s Target commercial.\n\nMalachi Pearson voiced the character in the 1995 movie Casper and The Spooktacular New Adventures of Casper (1996–1998).\n\nDevon Sawa is the only actor to ever have played the character in live-action, portraying him in a sequence from the 1995 film in which Casper was temporarily brought back to life.\n\nApril Winchell voiced Casper as a baby in the The Spooktacular New Adventures of Casper episode \"Three Ghosts and a Baby\".\n\nLani Minella voiced Casper in Casper: The Interactive Adventure.\n\nJeremy Foley voiced the character in Casper: A Spirited Beginning and Casper Meets Wendy.\n\nBrendon Ryan Barrett provided the voice in Casper's Haunted Christmas.\n\nDevon Werkheiser voiced Casper in Casper's Scare School.\n\nCarolyn Hennesy voiced Casper in Casper: Friends Around the World.\n\nOliver Stern voiced Casper in a GEICO commercial in 2019.\n\nBobby Moynihan voiced Casper in the fourth season of Harvey Girls Forever!\n\nThe cartoons and movies of \"Casper, the Friendly Ghost\" have also been dubbed in other languages including Spanish by other voice actors, and the name \"Casper\" has been translated as Gasparín.\n\nFriends/Supporting characters\n\nEnemies\n\nHome media\n\nIn 2011, Shout!
