It was produced by Hanna-Barbera (H-B) for ABC's Saturday morning children's programming. It ran from 1988 to 1991, airing 27 episodes that spanned four seasons. It was the eighth Scooby-Doo series after Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!\n\nThrough all the format changes, celebrity guests, and cast changes, we finally go back to just the five essential characters: Shaggy, Daphne, Freddy, Velma, and Scooby-Doo. But this time we see them as junior high students in their hometown of Coolsville, where there is plenty of sleuthing to be had. When you're in Coolsville, look up the Scooby-Doo Detective Agency.\n\nThe entire series has been released on DVD.\n\nProduction\n\nDevelopment\n\nIn 1988,[1] Ruegger was hired by ABC executives Jeannie Elias and Amy Simon to create a new Scooby-Doo series,[1][2] using it as a way of doing something fresh, which was to depict the main characters as actual kids for kids to watch, with the working title being Scooby-Doo: The Puppy Years.[2] This was not inspired by the current trend of what became known as the \"babyfication\" of popular older cartoon characters, which began with Muppet Babies, something Ruegger was not a fan of as he saw it as, well, too \"babyish.\"[1]\n\nCasting\n\nDon Messick and Casey Kasem were bought back to voice Scooby and Shaggy, respectively, but their voices were pitched slightly higher to sound more youthful.[3]\n\nMusic\n\nThe music was composed by John Debney, with Joanne Miller acting as director of music supervision for the first three seasons, then Bodie Chandler acting as director of music production for the fourth.\n\nTheme song lyrics\n\n(Scooby Dooby, Scooby Dooby Doo!\n\nScooby Dooby, Scooby Dooby Doo!)\n\nThere's a mystery in town,\n\nSo call the coolest pup around\n\nOh Scooby, A Pup Named Scooby-Doo!\n\nJoin Shaggy and the crew\n\nWith Daphne, Freddie, and Velma too,\n\nScooby, A Pup Named Scooby-Doo!\n\nWhen the ghost and ghouls attack,\n\nScooby eats a Scooby Snack.\n\nScooby Dooby Doo!\n\nJinkies!\n\n(Scooby Dooby, Scooby Dooby Doo!)\n\nCome on!\n\n(Scooby Dooby, Scooby Dooby Doo!)\n\nScooby!\n\nSo come on it's mystery time and\n\nYou can help us solve the crime!\n\nWith Scooby, A pup named Scooby,\n\nScooby, a pup named Scooby-Doo!\n\nScooby-Doo, where are you?\n\nScooby-Doo!\n\nEpisodes\n\nTitle Original air date 1x01\n\n\"A Bicycle Built for Boo!\"\n\nSeptember 10, 1988 1x02\n\n\"The Sludge Monster from the Earth's Core\"\n\nSeptember 17, 1988 1x03\n\n\"The Schnook Who Took My Comic Book\"\n\nSeptember 24, 1988 1x04\n\n\"Wanted Cheddar Alive\"\n\nOctober 1, 1988 1x05\n\n\"For Letter or Worse\"\n\nOctober 8, 1988 1x06\n\n\"The Babysitter from Beyond\"\n\nOctober 15, 1988 1x07\n\n\"Snow Place Like Home\"\n\nOctober 22, 1988 1x08\n\n\"Now Museum, Now You Don't\"\n\nOctober 29, 1988 1x09\n\n\"Scooby Dude\"\n\nNovember 5, 1988 1x10\n\n\"Ghost Who's Coming to Dinner\"\n\nNovember 12, 1988 1x11\n\n\"The Story Stick\"\n\nNovember 19, 1988 1x12\n\n\"Robopup\"\n\nNovember 26, 1988 1x13\n\n\"Lights...Camera...Monster\"\n\nDecember 3, 1988 2x01\n\n\"Curse of the Collar\"\n\nSeptember 9, 1989 2x02\n\n\"The Return of Commander Cool\"\n\nSeptember 16, 1989 2x03\n\n\"The Spirit of Rock'n Roll\"\n\nSeptember 23, 1989 2x04\n\n\"Chickenstein Lives\"\n\nSeptember 30, 1989 2x05\n\n\"Night of the Living Burger\"\n\nOctober 7, 1989 2x06\n\n\"The Computer Walks Among Us\"\n\nOctober 14, 1989 2x07\n\n\"Dog Gone Scooby\"\n\nOctober 21, 1989 2x08\n\n\"Terror, Thy Name is Zombo\"\n\nOctober 28, 1989 3x01\n\n\"Night of the Boogey Biker\"\n\n\"Dawn of the Spooky Space Shuttle\"\n\nSeptember 8, 1990 3x02\n\n\"Horror of the Haunted Hairpiece\"\n\nOctober 6, 1990 3x03\n\n\"Wrestle Maniacs\"\n\nNovember 3, 1990 4x01\n\n\"The Were-Doo of Doo Manor\"\n\nAugust 3, 1991 4x02\n\n\"Catcher on the Sly\"\n\n\"The Ghost of Mrs. Shusham\"\n\n\"The Wrath of Waitro\"\n\nAugust 10, 1991 4x03\n\n\"Mayhem of the Moving Mollusk\"\n\nAugust 17, 1991\n\nCast\n\nDon Messick as Scooby-Doo\n\nCasey Kasem as Shaggy Rogers\n\nKellie Martin as Daphne Blake\n\nCarl Steven as Freddy Jones\n\nChristina Lange as Velma Dinkley\n\nScott Menville as Red Herring\n\nLegacy\n\nThere is a flashback in the What's New, Scooby-Doo? episode \"A Terrifying Round with a Menacing Metallic Clown,\" depicting Mystery Inc. in the designs they are depicted in A Pup Named Scooby-Doo. Interestingly, besides Velma, the only other character to talk is Fred, who is voiced by Frank Welker, who was replaced by Carl Steven in the prequel.\n\nIn 2013, A Pup Named Scooby-Doo served as an inspiration for puppet designs and humor for the direct-to-video film called Scooby-Doo! Adventures: The Mystery Map.\n\nIn popular culture\n\nYoung Sheldon\n\n\"Spock, Kirk, and Testicular Hernia:\" Sheldon tricks Missy out of watching A Pup Named Scooby-Doo so he can watch Professor Proton, a parody of Bill Nye, the Science Guy, and Mr. Wizard.\n\n\"Jiu-Jitsu, Bubble Wrap, and Yoo-Hoo:\" Missy watches \"Chickenstein Lives.\""
