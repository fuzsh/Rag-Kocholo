        "text": "One of the most enjoyable Superstars 10 movies from Hanna-Barbera that I've seen thus far. But boy, does it have an insane premise! Yogi Bear and the gang go on a tour of the museum that houses Howard Hughes' Spruce Goose aircraft (something I had only heard of but had no inkling of its history) and they wind up getting trapped inside of the plane. Then, it magically takes off and carts them on a journey around the world, saving animals in distress in Antarctica and the Zelman Sea, and then running into analogs for Dick Dastardly and Muttley (The Dread Baron and Mumbly) on a tropical island. It's almost a stream-of-consciousness, fever-dream plot, but at least it kept me…\n\nThere's a difference between \"antics\" and \"adventures.\" I love Yogi Bear's antics. Some poor family goes to Jellystone with a picnic basket, they're leaving that Park hungry. Yogi's adventures are much stranger and I would argue are never quite enough to sustain a feature film. This is an especially odd one. \"Yogi Steals a Plane\" is a perfectly serviceable idea for a story, but the Spruce Goose angle makes it so oddly specific. If you're going to give it that branding, maybe do something with it. Have the fact that it's made of wood or massive in size be important. Maybe the ghost of Howard Hughes could be haunting it. Oh. Is that too much? But that's maybe exactly what's…\n\nDefinitely Good for all ages if you would like to have a blast enjoy the movie show your kids! One thing I never understand why people are not a fan of a charming movie come on think about your kids\n\nSnagglepuss gayly steals every scene, not that anyone else is a beacon of heterosexuality in this film.\n\nI didn’t know the “Spruce Goose” was a real plane, let alone Howard Hughes’ H-4 Hercules. It was apparently on display in Long Beach, which likely led to it being used as the framing device for this edutainment-adjacent film.\n\nThis was only $5 on Prime Video. It's also on Boomerang.\n\nThis movie features Yogi Bear, Boo Boo, Huckleberry Hound, Snagglepuss, Quick Draw McGraw, Augie Doggie and Doggie Daddy, The Dread Barron, Mumbly, and androgynous girl name Bernice.\n\nYogi and friends accidentally steal the Spruce Goose which flies magically. They use the magic plane to help various animals and people in various situations.\n\nThe Dread Baron and Mumbly here are fairly specifically Dick Dastardly and Muttley with different clothes as Hanna Barbera was sure if they owned DD & M.\n\nThis is a pleasant time."
