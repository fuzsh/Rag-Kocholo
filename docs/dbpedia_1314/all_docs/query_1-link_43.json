        "text": "Uptake mechanism of valproic acid in human placental choriocarcinoma cell line (BeWo).\n\nPubMed\n\nUshigome, F; Takanaga, H; Matsuo, H; Tsukimori, K; Nakano, H; Ohtani, H; Sawada, Y\n\n2001-04-13\n\nValproic acid is an anticonvulsant widely used for the treatment of epilepsy. However, valproic acid is known to show fetal toxicity, including teratogenicity. In the present study, to elucidate the mechanisms of valproic acid transport across the blood-placental barrier, we carried out transcellular transport and uptake experiments with human placental choriocarcinoma epithelial cells (BeWo cells) in culture. The permeability coefficient of [3H]valproic acid in BeWo cells for the apical-to-basolateral flux was greater than that for the opposite flux, suggesting a higher unidirectional transport in the fetal direction. The uptake of [3H]valproic acid from the apical side was temperature-dependent and enhanced under acidic pH. In the presence of 50 microM carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxylhydrazone, the uptake of [3H]valproic acid was significantly reduced. A metabolic inhibitor, 10 mM sodium azide, also significantly reduced the uptake of [3H]valproic acid. Therefore, valproic acid is actively transported in a pH-dependent manner on the brush-border membrane of BeWo cells. Kinetic analysis of valproic acid uptake revealed the involvement of a non-saturable component and a saturable component. The Michaelis constant for the saturable transport (K(t)) was smaller under acidic pH, suggesting a proton-linked active transport mechanism for valproic acid in BeWo cells. In the inhibitory experiments, some short-chain fatty acids, such as acetic acid, lactic acid, propanoic acid and butyric acid, and medium-chain fatty acids, such as hexanoic acid and octanoic acid, inhibited the uptake of [3H]valproic acid. The uptake of [3H]valproic acid was also significantly decreased in the presence of 4,4'-diisothiocyanatostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid, salicylic acid and furosemide, which are well-known inhibitors of the anion exchange system. Moreover, p-aminohippuric acid significantly reduced the uptake of [3H]valproic acid. These results suggest that an active transport\n\nDisruption of thyroid hormone sulfotransferase activity by brominated flame retardant chemicals in the human choriocarcinoma placenta cell line, BeWo.\n\nPubMed\n\nLeonetti, Christopher P; Butt, Craig M; Stapleton, Heather M\n\n2018-04-01\n\nBrominated flame retardants (BFRs) have been shown to disrupt thyroid hormone (TH) homeostasis through multiple mechanisms, including inhibition of enzymes that regulate intracellular levels of THs, such as sulfotransferases (SULTs). The placenta plays a critical role in helping to maintain TH levels during fetal development and expresses SULTs. This is concerning given that disruption of TH regulation within the placenta could potentially harm the developing fetus. In this study, we investigated the effects of two polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), two hydroxylated PBDEs, and 2,4,6-tribromophenol (2,4,6-TBP) on TH SULT activity in a choriocarcinoma placenta cell line (BeWo). BeWo cells were exposed to BFR concentrations up to 1â¯Î¼M for 1-24â¯h to investigate changes in basal SULT activity and in mRNA expression of several TH regulating genes. 2,4,6-TBP was the most potent inhibitor of basal 3,3'-T2 SULT activity at all exposure durations, decreasing activity by as much as 86% after 24â¯h of exposure. BDE-99, 3-OH BDE-47, and 6-OH BDE-47 also decreased 3,3'-T2 SULT activity by 23-42% at concentrations of 0.5â¯Î¼M and 1.0â¯Î¼M following 24â¯h exposures. BDE-47 had no effect on SULT activity, and there was no observed effect of any BFR exposure on expression of SULT1A1, or thyroid nuclear receptors alpha or beta. This research demonstrates that total TH SULT activity in placental cells are sensitive to BFR exposure; however, the mechanisms and consequences have yet to be fully elucidated.

In this study, we examined the effects of benzo(a)pyrene (B(a)P), a main CS component, on the viability and apoptosis of JEG-3 and BeWo human choriocarcinoma cancer cell lines. An MTT assay confirmed that B(a)P decreased the cell viability of JEG-3 and BeWo cells in a dose-dependent manner. Additionally, Western blot (WB) assay revealed that protein expression of cyclin D and cyclin E decreased, while protein expression of p21 and p27 was increased in response to B(a)P treatment for 48Â h. The changes in reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels in JEG-3 and BeWo cells exposed to B(a)P were also measured by a dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCF-DA) assay, which revealed that ROS levels increased in response to B(a)P treatment for 48Â h. WB assay also confirmed that each B(a)P treatment of JEG-3 and BeWo cells for 4Â h promoted the expression of phosphorylated eukaryotic initiation factor 2 alpha protein (p-eIF2Î±) and C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP), which are known to be involved in ROS-mediated endoplasmic reticulum stress (ER-stress) related apoptosis. Overall, the protein expression of Bax (a pro-apoptosis marker) increased, while the expression of Bcl-xl (an anti-apoptotic marker) decreased and the number of apoptotic cells increased in response to B(a)P treatment for 48Â h. Taken together, these results suggest that B(a)P has the potential to induce apoptosis of JEG-3 and BeWo human choriocarcinoma cancer cells by increasing the ROS level and simultaneously activating ER-stress.

However, HLA-G also possesses immune suppressing-independent functions. We found that HLA-G expressing BeWo choriocarcinoma cells increased cellâcell fusion compared to control BeWo cells under forskolin treatment. Regardless of forskolin treatment, the expressionmoreÂ Â» of fusogenic gene mRNAs, including syncytin-1, the transcription factor glial cell missing 1 (Gcm1), and beta human chorionic gonadotropin (Î²-hCG) were elevated. HLA-G up-regulates Î²-hCG production in human choriocarcinoma cells because HLA-G knockdown in JEG-3 cells induces a dramatic decrease in Î²-hCG compared with control cells. The defect in Î²-hCG production in HLA-G knocked-down cells could not be completely overcome by stimulating hCG production through increasing intracellular cAMP levels. HLA-G expressing cells have increased phosphorylation levels for extracellular signal-regulated kinase1/2 (Erk1/2) in BeWo cells. The Erk1/2 pathway is inactivated after the inhibition of HLA-G expression in JEG-3 cells. Finally, Erk1/2 inhibition was able to suppress the increased hCG production induced by HLA-G expression. Together, these data suggest novel roles for HLA-G in regulating Î²-hCG production via the modulation of the Erk1/2 pathway and by inducing trophoblast cell fusion.Â«Â less\n\nGenome-wide high-resolution aCGH analysis of gestational choriocarcinomas.\n\nPubMed\n\nPoaty, Henriette; Coullin, Philippe; Peko, Jean FÃ©lix; Dessen, Philippe; Diatta, Ange Lucien; Valent, Alexander; Leguern, Eric; PrÃ©vot, Sophie; GombÃ©-Mbalawa, Charles; Candelier, Jean-Jacques; Picard, Jean-Yves; Bernheim, Alain\n\n2012-01-01\n\nEleven samples of DNA from choriocarcinomas were studied by high resolution CGH-array 244 K.

In this study, we demonstrated that long-term treatment with forskolin enhances the tight junction (TJ) formation in human placental BeWo cells. Interestingly, AMPK activation and phosphorylation of acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), a molecule downstream from AMPK, were induced by long-term incubation (>12h) with forskolin, despite not being induced by acute stimulation with forskolin. In addition, co-incubation with an AMPK inhibitor, compound C, as well as overexpression of an AMPK dominant negative mutant inhibited forskolin-induced TJ formation. Thus, although the molecular mechanism underlying AMPK activation via the forskolin stimulation is unclear, the TJ formation induced by forskolin is likely to be mediated by the AMPK pathway. Taking into consideration that TJs are present in the normal human placenta, this mechanism may be important for forming the placental barrier system between the fetal and maternal circulations.\n\n[Cytogenomic studies of hydatiform moles and gestational choriocarcinoma].\n\nPubMed\n\nPoaty, Henriette; Coullin, Philippe; Leguern, Eric; Dessen, Philippe; Valent, Alexandre; Afoutou, JosÃ©-Marie; Peko, Jean-FÃ©lix; Candelier, Jean-Jacques; GombÃ©-Mbalawa, Charles; Picard, Jean-Yves; Bernheim, Alain\n\n2012-09-01\n\nThe complete hydatidiform mole (CHM), a gestational trophoblastic disease, is usually caused by the development of an androgenic egg whose genome is exclusively paternal. Due to parental imprinting, only trophoblasts develop in the absence of a fetus. CHM are diploid and no abnormal karyotype is observed. It is 46,XX in most cases and less frequently 46,XY. The major complication of this disease is gestational choriocarcinoma, a metastasizing tumor and a true allografted malignancy. This complication is infrequent in developed countries, but is more common in the developing countries and is then worsened by delayed care. The malignancies are often accompanied by acquired, possibly etiological genomic abnormalities. We investigated the presence of recurrent cytogenetic abnormalities in CHM and post-molar choriocarcinoma using metaphasic CGH (mCGH) and high-resolution 244K aCGH techniques. The 10Â CHM studied by mCGH showed no chromosomal gains or losses. For post-molar choriocarcinoma, 11Â tumors, whose diagnosis was verified by histopathology, were investigated by aCGH. Their androgenic nature and the absence of tumor DNA contamination by maternal DNA were verified by the analysis of microsatellite markers. Three choriocarcinoma cell lines (BeWo, JAR and JEG) were also analyzed by aCGH. The results allowed us to observe some chromosomal rearrangements in primary tumors, and more in the cell lines. Chromosomal abnormalities were confirmed by FISH and functional effect by immunohistochemical analysis of gene expression. Forty minimum critical regions (MCR) were defined on chromosomes. Candidate genes implicated in choriocarcinoma oncogenesis were selected. The presence in the MCR of many miRNA clusters whose expression is modulated by parental imprinting has been observed, for example in 14q32Â or in 19q13.4. This suggests that, in gestational choriocarcinoma, the consequences of gene abnormalities directly linked to acquired chromosomal abnormalities are\n\nEffect of Bisphenol A on invasion ability of human trophoblastic cell line BeWo.\n\nPubMed\n\nWang, Zi-Yi; Lu, Jing; Zhang, Yuan-Zhen; Zhang, Ming; Liu, Teng; Qu, Xin-Lan\n\n2015-01-01\n\nBisphenol A (BPA) is a kind of environmental endocrine disruptors (EEDs) that interfere embryo implantation. Trophoblast invasion plays a crucial role during embryo implantation. In this study, the effects of BPA on invasion ability of human trophoblastic cell line BeWo and its possible mechanism were investigated. BeWo cells were exposed to BPA and co-cultured with human endometrial cells to mimic embryo implantation in transwell model. The proliferation and invasion capability of BeWo cells were detected. The expression of E-cadherin, DNMT1, MMP-2, MMP-9, TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 were also analyzed. The results showed that the invasion capability of BeWo was reduced after daily exposure to BPA. BPA had biphasic effect on E-cadherin expression level in BeWo cells and expression level of DNMT1 was decreased when treated with BPA. Moreover, BPA treatment also changed the balance of MMPs/TIMPs in BeWo cells by down-regulating MMP-2, MMP-9 and up-regulating TIMP-1, TIMP-2 with increasing BPA concentration. Taken together, these results showed that BPA treatment could reduce the invasion ability of BeWo cells and alter the expression level of E-cadherin, DNMT1, TIMP-1, TIMP-2, MMP-2, and MMP-9. Our study would help us to understand the possible mechanism of BPA effect on invasion ability of human trophoblastic cell line BeWo.\n\nAscorbic acid transported by sodium-dependent vitamin C transporter 2 stimulates steroidogenesis in human choriocarcinoma cells.\n\nPubMed\n\nWu, Ximei; Iguchi, Takuma; Itoh, Norio; Okamoto, Kousuke; Takagi, Tatsuya; Tanaka, Keiichi; Nakanishi, Tsuyoshi\n\n2008-01-01\n\nReduced vitamin C [ascorbic acid (AA)], which is taken up into cells by sodium-dependent vitamin C transporter (SVCT) 1 and 2, is believed to be important for hormone synthesis, but its role in generating placental steroids needed to maintain pregnancy and fetal development is not clear. To determine the steroidogenic effect of AA and the role of SVCT2 in AA-induced steroidogenesis, we tested the effects of AA treatment and SVCT2 knockdown on steroidogenesis in human choriocarcinoma cell lines. AA treatment of JEG-3, BeWo, and JAR cells for 48-h dose dependently increased progesterone and estradiol levels. In JEG-3 cells, AA increased the mRNA expression of P450 cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme, 3beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1, and aromatase, key enzymes for steroidogenesis. Stable knockdown of SVCT2 in JEG-3 cells by retrovirally mediated RNA interference decreased the maximal velocity of AA uptake by approximately 50%, but apparent affinity values were not affected. SVCT2 knockdown in JEG-3 cells significantly suppressed the AA-induced mRNA expression of placental P450 cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme, 3beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1, and aromatase. This suppression of the AA-induced mRNA expression of steroidogenic enzymes subsequently decreased progesterone and estradiol production. In addition, inhibition of MAPK kinase-ERK signaling, which is a major pathway for AA-regulated gene expression, failed to affect AA-induced steroidogenesis. Our observations indicate that SVCT2-mediated AA uptake into cells is necessary for AA-induced steroidogenesis in human choriocarcinoma cell, but MAPK kinase-ERK signaling is not involved in AA-induced steroidogenesis.\n\nExpression and Functional Activities of Selected Sulfotransferase Isoforms in BeWo Cells and Primary Cytotrophoblast Cells\n\nPubMed Central\n\nMitra, Pallabi; Audus, Kenneth L.\n\n2009-01-01\n\nSeveral cytosolic sulfotransferase enzyme isoforms are functional in placenta but there is limited information available on the utility of cultured trophoblast cells for studying sulfation. The trophoblast cell layer constitutes the rate-determining barrier for trans-placental transfer. The objective of this work was to examine the mRNA expression and enzyme activities of four sulfotransferase isoforms reported to be functional in human placenta (SULT1A1, SULT1A3, SULT1E1, and SULT2A1) in primary cytotrophoblast cells and the trophoblast-like BeWo cell line. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed to determine mRNA expression. Enzyme activities were assessed using the following substrates: 4-nitrophenol for SULT1A1, dopamine for SULT1A3, 17Î²-estradiol for SULT1E1, and dehydroepiandrosterone for SULT2A1. For 4-nitrophenol and dopamine sulfation, apparent Km values, response to inhibitors (2,6-dichloro-4-nitrophenol and sodium chloride), and thermal stability profiles indicated that 4-nitrophenol and dopamine sulfation in BeWo cells were being mediated by SULT1A1 and SULT1A3, respectively. SULT1A1 and SULT1A3 were also functional in the cytotrophoblast cells. Both at the protein and at the mRNA levels, SULT1A1 was more abundant in BeWo cells in comparison to the primary cytotrophoblast cells. SULT1E1 and SULT2A1 mRNA were not detected in the cytotrophoblasts. SULT1E1 mRNA was weakly expressed in BeWo but there was negligible functional activity. Although SULT2A1 mRNA was abundantly expressed in BeWo, Western blot and enzyme activities revealed that the protein is not expressed in BeWo cells. The results suggest that the BeWo cells and the cytotrophoblast cells can be used to examine the roles of SULT1A1 and SULT1A3 in placental metabolism. PMID:19646966\n\nReduced syncytin-1 expression in chriocarcinoma BeWo cells activates the calpain1-AIF-mediated apoptosis, implication for preeclampsia\n\nPubMed Central\n\nHuang, Qiang; Chen, Haibin; Wang, Fengchao; Brost, Brian C.; Li, Jinping; Gao, Yu; Li, Zongfang; Gao, Ya; Jiang, Shi-Wen\n\n2015-01-01\n\nPlacentas associated with preeclampsia are characterized by extensive apoptosis in trophoblast lineages. Syncytin-1 (HERVWE1) mediates the fusion of cytotrophoblasts to form syncytiotrophoblasts, which assume the placental barrier, fetal-maternal exchange and endocrine functions. While decreased syncytin-1 expression has been observed in preeclamptic placentas, it is not clear if this alteration is involved in trophoblast apoptosis. In the current study we found that siRNA-mediated knockdown of syncytin-1 led to apoptosis in choriocarcinoma BeWo, a cell line of trophoblastic origin. Characterization of the apoptotic pathways indicated that this effect does not rely on the activation of caspases. Rather, decreased syncytin-1 levels activated the AIF apoptotic pathway by inducing the expression, cleavage, and nuclear translocation of AIF. Moreover, calpain1, the cysteine protease capable of cleaving AIF, was upregulated by syncytin-1 knockdown. Furthermore, treatment with calpain1 inhibitor MDL28170 effectively reversed AIF cleavage, AIF nuclear translocation, and cell apoptosis triggered by syncytin-1 downregulation, verifying the specific action of calpain1-AIF pathway in trophoblast apoptosis. We confirmed that preeclamptic placentas express lower levels of syncytin-1 than normal placentas, and observed an inverse correlation between syncytin-1 and AIF/calpain1 mRNA levels, a result consistent with the in vitro findings. Immunohistochemistry analyses indicated decreased syncytin-1, increased AIF and calpain1 protein levels in apoptotic cells of preeclamptic placentas. These findings have for the first time revealed that decreased levels of syncytin-1 can trigger the AIF-mediated apoptosis pathway in BeWo cells. This novel mechanism may contribute to the structural and functional deficiencies of syncytium frequently observed in preeclamptic placentas. PMID:24413738\n\nForskolin-induced differentiation of BeWo cells stimulates increased tumor growth in the chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) of the turkey (Meleagris gallopavo) egg.\n\nPubMed\n\nSchneider, Ralf; Borges, Marcus; Kadyrov, Mamed\n\n2011-05-01\n\nInvasiveness of BeWo cells has been assessed in a variety of assay systems including matrigel and mouse. At the same time BeWo cells are mostly used as model system for trophoblast fusion. Here we aimed to test the properties of BeWo cells in a combined approach. We forced BeWo cells to differentiate by culturing the cells in the presence of forskolin and then used these cells for invasion assays on the chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) of the turkey. The chorioallantoic membranes of turkey eggs were incubated with medium containing forskolin, BeWo cells cultured in medium alone, BeWo cells cultured in forskolin and washed, and BeWo cells cultured in forskolin and used directly for application. Suspensions were applied onto ten CAM per condition. For local tumor formation eggs were checked for tumor development every 24h macroscopically for up to 12 days and immunohistochemistry for cytokeratin 18 and Ki-67 were used for further analysis. Forskolin alone did not have any deleterious effect on the CAM. When the CAM was incubated with BeWo cells cultured in medium 40% of the eggs developed a macroscopically visible tumor. BeWo cells stimulated with forskolin and washed induced tumor growth in 50% of the eggs, while forskolin stimulated BeWo cells applied directly onto the CAM induced tumor growth in 70% of the eggs. Forced differentiation of BeWo cells by forskolin may lead to syncytial fusion in a plastic culture dish. Under the conditions used here, i.e. in direct contact to a living tissue, forskolin-induced differentiation of BeWo cells leads to an increase in tumor formation in the CAM. Thus BeWo cells may use signaling pathways to decide for both differentiation pathways similar to primary trophoblast depending on the environment. Copyright Â© 2011 Elsevier GmbH.

BeWo cells on treatment with forskolin/human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) were studied for cell fusion by desmoplakin I+II staining and/or hCG secretion by ELISA. Levels of Wnt10b/Î²-catenin/glial cell missing a (GCMa)/syncytin-1 were studied by qPCR/Western blotting in forskolin-/hCG-treated control siRNA and Wnt10b silenced BeWo cells. BeWo cells on treatment with hCG (5Â IU/mL) led to a 94-fold increase in Wnt10b transcript. Wnt10b silencing showed significant decrease in forskolin-/hCG-mediated BeWo cell fusion and/or hCG secretion. It led to down-regulation of Î²-catenin (nuclear and cytoplasmic), GCMa and syncytin-1 expression. Treatment of BeWo cells with H89, protein kinase A (PKA) signaling inhibitor, significantly reduced forskolin-/hCG-induced Wnt10b, Î²-catenin, and syncytin-1 expression, which also resulted in reduced cell fusion. Wnt10b is involved in forskolin/hCG-mediated BeWo cell fusion via Î²-catenin/GCMa/syncytin pathway, which may also involve activation of PKA. Â© 2017 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

We examined the effects of leptin and progesterone on the invasion of BeWo cells, a human trophoblastic cell line, and the effect of concurrent treatment. Cells were treated with leptin (0, 5, 50, or 500 ng/mL) or progesterone (0, 2, 20, or 200 ÂµM) and cultured in an invasion assay. Cells treated with 500 ng/mL leptin were also treated with progesterone (0, 2, 20, or 200 ÂµM) in the invasion assay for 48 h. The number of cells that invaded the lower surface was counted in five randomly chosen fields using a light microscope with a 200Ã objective. The mRNA expression levels of MMP-9, TIMP1, TIMP2, and E-cadherin were detected by semi-quantitative PCR. Invasion of BeWo cells was promoted by leptin and influenced by both leptin concentration and treatment duration. Invasion was most effective at 500 ng/mL leptin and 48 h culture. Leptin-induced invasiveness was suppressed by progesterone in a dose-dependent manner. Leptin significantly decreased the expression levels of TIMP1 and E-cadherin, whereas progesterone significantly decreased expression of MMP-9 and significantly increased levels of TIMP1, TIMP2, and E-cadherin. Leptin promotes invasion of BeWo cells, and progesterone suppresses leptin-induced invasion by regulating the expressions of MMP-9, TIMP1, TIMP2, and E-cadherin. The balance between leptin and progesterone may play an important role in human placenta formation during early pregnancy.\n\nEffect of bisphenol A on drug efflux in BeWo, a human trophoblast-like cell line.\n\nPubMed\n\nJin, H; Audus, K L\n\n2005-04-01\n\nBisphenol A (BPA) is a monomer of polycarbonate plastics that has estrogenic activities and has been shown to be a substrate for multidrug resistant efflux mechanisms, specifically, P-glycoprotein. Since the natural hormone estrogen reverses multidrug resistance in some cell types, we hypothesized that BPA might have a similar activity in trophoblasts. We have used BeWo cells as an in vitro model for human trophoblasts and calcein AM as a substrate for drug efflux mechanism to characterize BPA interactions with placental P-glycoprotein. We found that chronic exposure of BeWo cells to BPA did not alter intracellular calcein accumulation in a fashion that would be reflective of changes in P-glycoprotein expression. Immunoblots affirmed that BPA had small effects on P-glycoprotein expression. However, BeWo cells acutely exposed to BPA pretreatment were observed to have a significantly decreased calcein accumulation. Addition of cyclosporin A, a P-glycoprotein inhibitor and substrate, completely reversed BPA's effects on calcein accumulation and resulted in a net increase, relative to controls, in calcein accumulation by the BeWo cells. BPA was found not to stimulate P-gp ATPase or alter intracellular esterases mediating calcein release from calcein AM. Therefore, our results suggested that BPA stimulated drug efflux by BeWo cells probably by direct effects on P-glycoprotein.\n\nBisphenol A increases BeWo trophoblast survival in stress-induced paradigms through regulation of oxidative stress and apoptosis.\n\nPubMed\n\nPonniah, Muralitharan; Billett, E Ellen; De Girolamo, Luigi A\n\n2015-09-21\n\nBisphenol A (BPA) is ubiquitous in the environment and is reported to be present at high concentrations in placental tissue, where its presence raises concerns over its potential to disrupt placental function. This report investigates how BPA interferes with the survival of human choriocarcinoma BeWo cells (a model of placental trophoblasts) under stress-induced paradigms reminiscent of pathways activated in placental development. These include conditions that promote oxidative stress (glutathione depletion) and apoptosis (serum withdrawal) or mimic hypoxia (HIF-1Î± accumulation via dimethyloxalylglycine treatment). Treatment of BeWo cells with BPA during stress-induced paradigms led to a consistent and significant increase in cell viability, with a concomitant increase in glutathione levels and a reduction in apoptosis. Assessment of the antioxidant capacity of BPA revealed its ability to quench reactive oxygen species and reduce the levels generated during glutathione and serum depletion. BPA was also able to reduce the activation of the antioxidant response element (ARE) through mediation of its activators, nuclear factor erythroid related factor family members (Nrf's). Indeed, the expression and nuclear translocation of Nrf2 (an important ARE activator) were impaired by BPA, while Nrf1 and Nrf3 expression levels were increased. Furthermore, BPA increased the levels of the anti-apoptotic proteins (Bcl-2 and Hsp70) and decreased HIF-1Î± levels during stress-induced conditions. Together, these results indicate that BPA inhibits trophoblast cell death under conditions of cellular stress. This could have implications on placental trophoblasts during development.\n\nIsolation of basal membrane proteins from BeWo cells and their expression in placentas from fetal growth-restricted pregnancies.\n\nPubMed\n\nOh, Soo-Young; Hwang, Jae Ryoung; Lee, Yoonna; Choi, Suk-Joo; Kim, Jung-Sun; Kim, Jong-Hwa; Sadovsky, Yoel; Roh, Cheong-Rae\n\n2016-03-01\n\nThe syncytiotrophoblast, a key barrier between the mother and fetus, is a polarized epithelium composed of a microvillus and basal membrane (BM). We sought to characterize BM proteins of BeWo cells in relation to hypoxia and to investigate their expression in placentas from pregnancies complicated by fetal growth restriction (FGR). We isolated the BM fraction of BeWo cells by the cationic colloidal silica method and identified proteins enriched in this fraction by mass spectrometry. We evaluated the effect of hypoxia on the expression and intracellular localization of identified proteins and compared their expression in BM fractions of FGR placentas to those from normal pregnancies. We identified BM proteins from BeWo cells. Among BM proteins, we further characterized heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), voltage-dependent anion channel-1 (VDAC1), and ribophorin II (RPN2), based on their relevance to placental biology. Hypoxia enhanced the localization of these proteins to the BM of BeWo cells. HO-1, VDAC1, and RPN2 were selectively expressed in the human placental BM fraction. C-terminally truncated HO-1 was identified in placental BM fractions, and its BM expression was significantly reduced in FGR placentas than in normal placentas. Interestingly, a truncated HO-1 construct was predominantly localized in the BM in response to hypoxia and co-localized with VDAC1 in BeWo cells. Hypoxia increased the BM localization of HO-1, VDAC1, and RPN2 proteins. FGR significantly reduced the expression of truncated HO-1, which was surmised to co-localize with VDAC1 in hypoxic BeWo cells. Copyright Â© 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The process of syncytialization is associated with the expression of a variety of genes. However, the association between syncytialization and OCTN2 expression is not yet clear. Given that forskolin induces BeWo cells to undergo biochemical and morphological differentiation, the purpose of the present study was to investigate whether the function and expression of OCTN2 are influenced by forskolin treatment during syncytialization. The forskolin-induced differentiation of BeWo cells was validated by secretion of beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (beta-hCG) and syncytin expression. Cellular localization of OCTN2 was analyzed by confocal microscopy. Expression of OCTN2 and the modular proteins PDZK1, PDZK2, NHERF1 and NHERF2 was analyzed by Western blotting and carnitine uptake by BeWo cells was estimated and the kinetic properties of uptake measured. The results showed that forskolin treatment increased beta-hCG secretion and syncytin expression, suggesting induction of syncytialization. Confocal images of BeWo cells showed the localization of OCTN2 in the brush-border membrane. OCTN2 protein expression was upregulated in isolated brush-border membranes by long-term forskolin treatment, but the V(m) for carnitine uptake was unchanged, although the K(m) increased. PDZK1, NHERF1 and NHERF2 protein expression in the brush-border membrane was downregulated by forskolin treatment, whereas PDZK2 levels remained unchanged. In conclusion, protein expression and function of OCTN2 in BeWo cells can be regulated by forskolin treatment. While the presence of forskolin results in an increase in OCTN2 protein expression, the increase in uptake capacity may be compensated by the decreased expression of PDZK1, NHERF1 or NHERF2.\n\nSilibinin stimluates apoptosis by inducing generation of ROS and ER stress in human choriocarcinoma cells.\n\nPubMed\n\nHam, Jiyeon; Lim, Whasun; Bazer, Fuller W; Song, Gwonhwa\n\n2018-02-01\n\nSilibinin is a flavonolignan extracted from seeds of milk thistles. Traditionally, it has been used as a therapeutic agent for liver disorders, and now it is well-known for its anti-cancer effects. However, studies on anti-cancer effects of silibinin on choriocarcinoma are very limited. Therefore, we performed proliferation and apoptosis assays to determine effects of silibinin on the viability of human choriocarcinoma (JAR and JEG3) cells. Our results showed that silibinin significantly inhibited proliferation and induced apoptosis in both JAR and JEG3 cells, and significantly increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) and lipid peroxidation. Moreover, silibinin disrupted mitochondrial function by inducing permeabilization of mitochondrial membrane potential and calcium ion efflux in JAR and JEG3 cells. Furthermore, silibinin-induced apoptosis in choriocarcinoma cells via AKT, mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) and unfolded protein response (UPR) signal transduction. Collectively, our results suggest that silibinin is a novel therapeutic agent or dietary supplement for management of human placental choriocarcinomas.

In this study, we confirmed that myricetin reduced proliferation of two choriocarcinoma cell lines (JAR and JEG-3) and also promoted apoptosis and regulated cell cycle progression in a dose-dependent manner in JAR and JEG-3 cells. In addition, we found that invasive and pro-angiogenic properties of malignant JAR and JEG-3 trophoblast cells were attenuated by myricetin treatment via MAPK and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways. In addition, we found that ROS production, lipid peroxidation, glutathione depletion, and loss of mitochondrial membrane potentials were enhanced in JAR and JEG-3 cells treated with myricetin. Moreover, myricetin augmented cytosolic Ca 2+ release from the endoplasmic reticulum associated with modulation of ER stress in JAR and JEG-3 cells. Our results also revealed that myricetin had synergistic antiproliferative effects with current chemotherapeutics, etoposide and cisplatin, on choriocarcinoma cells. Collectively, results of the present study provide strong evidence for the potential of myricetin to be an effective therapeutic for the prevention of human placental choriocarcinomas.

Here we analyzed the impact of both cytokines on cytotoxicity and viability of trophoblast cells. Isolated villous first trimester human trophoblast cells and the human choriocarcinoma cell line BeWo were treated with recombinant human progranulin and TNF-Î±. Analyses were performed by LDH- and MTT-assay and measurement of caspase-8-activity. Progranulin treatment showed some cytoprotective effects on isolated trophoblast cells. However, TNF-Î±-induced apoptosis was not antagonized by addition of progranulin. Effects were similar, but more pronounced in BeWo cells. The cytoprotective activity of progranulin on trophoblast cells in vitro was only weak and of doubtful biologic relevance. It was not able to antagonize TNF-Î±. Future studies should focus on possible paracrine activities of progranulin.\n\nEnrofloxacin and Toltrazuril Are Able to Reduce Toxoplasma gondii Growth in Human BeWo Trophoblastic Cells and Villous Explants from Human Third Trimester Pregnancy\n\nPubMed Central\n\nda Silva, Rafaela J.; Gomes, Angelica O.; Franco, Priscila S.; Pereira, Ariane S.; Milian, Iliana C.

Due to teratogenic effects and bone marrow suppression caused by pyrimethamine, the establishment of new therapeutic strategies is indispensable to minimize the side effects and improve the control of infection. Previous studies demonstrated that enrofloxacin and toltrazuril reduced the incidence of Neospora caninum and Toxoplasma gondii infection. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the efficacy of enrofloxacin and toltrazuril in the control of T. gondii infection in human trophoblast cells (BeWo line) and in human villous explants from the third trimester. BeWo cells and villous were treated with several concentrations of enrofloxacin, toltrazuril, sulfadiazine, pyrimethamine, or combination of sulfadiazine+pyrimethamine, and the cellular or tissue viability was verified. Next, BeWo cells were infected by T. gondii (2F1 clone or the ME49 strain), whereas villous samples were only infected by the 2F1 clone. Then, infected cells and villous were treated with all antibiotics and the T. gondii intracellular proliferation as well as the cytokine production were analyzed. Finally, we evaluated the direct effect of enrofloxacin and toltrazuril in tachyzoites to verify possible changes in parasite structure. Enrofloxacin and toltrazuril did not decrease the viability of cells and villous in lower concentrations. Both drugs were able to significantly reduce the parasite intracellular proliferation in BeWo cells and villous explants when compared to untreated conditions. Regardless of the T. gondii strain, BeWo cells infected and treated with enrofloxacin or toltrazuril induced high levels of IL-6 and MIF. In villous explants, enrofloxacin induced high MIF production. Finally, the drugs increased the number of unviable parasites and triggered damage to tachyzoite structure.

Changes in miRNA(s) profile of BeWo cells treated with forskolin were analyzed using Affymetrix miRNA microarray platform. Down-regulated miRNA, miR-92a-1-5p, was overexpressed in BeWo cells followed by forskolin treatment to understand its relevance in the process of BeWo cell fusion by desmoplakin I+II staining and hCG secretion by ELISA. Predicted targets of miR-92a-1-5p were also confirmed by qRT-PCR/Western blotting. The miRNA profiling of BeWo cells after forskolin (25Â Î¼mol/L) treatment identified miR-92a-1-5p as the most significantly down-regulated miRNA both at 24 and 48Â hours time points. Overexpression of miR-92a-1-5p in these cells led to a significant decrease in forskolin-mediated cell fusion and hCG secretion. miRNA target prediction software, TargetScan, revealed dysferlin (DYSF) and protein kinase cAMP-activated catalytic subunit alpha (PRKACA), as target genes of miR-92a-1-5p. Overexpression of miR-92a-1-5p in BeWo cells showed reduction in forskolin-induced transcripts for DYSF and PRKACA. Further, reduction in DYSF (~2.6-fold) at protein level and PRKACA-encoded protein kinase A catalytic subunit alpha (PKAC-Î±; ~1.6-fold) were also observed. These observations suggest that miR-92a-1-5p regulates forskolin-mediated BeWo cell fusion and hCG secretion by regulating PKA signaling pathway and dysferlin expression.

The quinolinone derivative, vesnarinone, is a novel inotropic agent used for treating congestive heart failure and may also have a potential anticancer activity. It induces apoptosis and differentiation in some tumor cell lines. We examined the antitumor effect of vesnarinone in eight cell lines established from human choriocarcinoma and hydatidiform mole using MTT assay and also analyzed the nuclear fragmentation of tumor cells by DNA electrophoresis assay. Vesnarinone inhibited the proliferation of choriocarcinoma cell lines in a dose-dependent manner and induced DNA fragmentation in cells. However, the BM cell line prepared by subcultivation from hydatidiform mole showed no growth suppression or DNA fragmentation in response to vesnarinone. On the other hand, PCR-SSCP analysis and direct DNA sequencing have shown that a human choriocarcinoma cell line, SCH, has a mutant p53 gene at codon 249. When SCH cells were treated with vesnarinone cellular proliferation was significantly inhibited. Vesnarinone suppressed the proliferation of all choriocarcinoma cell lines and induced apoptosis, regardless of the existence of p53 mutation. In addition, it has been found by RT-PCR that expression of c-Myc mRNA is upregulated by treating choriocarcinoma cells with vesnarinone. The finding suggests that vesnarinone might induce expression of c-Myc gene in choriocarcinoma cells, the product of which may be associated with the inhibition of cell growth and induce apoptosis. These results suggest that vesnarinone is a useful reagent for the treatment of choriocarcinoma.\n\nEffects of phytoestrogens on the trophoblast tumour cell lines BeWo and Jeg3.\n\nPubMed\n\nPlessow, D; WaldschlÃ¤ger, J; Richter, D U; Jeschke, U; Bruer, G; Briese, V; Friese, K\n\n2003-01-01\n\nPhytoestrogens are a diverse group of nonsteroidal plant compounds that occur naturally in many plants. Because they possess a ring system similar to estrogens they are able to bind to estrogen receptors in humans. With this study we tested the effects of the phytoestrogens genistein and daidzein in cell proliferation and the production of progesterone and hCG in trophoblast tumour cells of the cell lines BeWo and Jeg3. The phytoestrogens genistein and daidzein were incubated in different concentrations with trophoblast tumour cells. Untreated cells were used as controls. At designated times, aliquots were removed and tested for progesterone and hCG. In addition we tested the effects of phytoestrogens on cell proliferation. Different concentrations of genistein and daidzein were cultivated with trophoblast tumour cells. After designated times, 1 microCi thymidin-(methyl-3H) was added. Methyl-3H thymidin incorporation was tested and compared to incorporation results of untreated cells. With this study we could show that the production of the steroid hormone progesterone and the protein hormone hCG is influenced by the phytoestrogens genistein and daidzein in trophoblast tumour cells of the cell lines BeWo and Jeg3. We found a correlation between the effects on the proliferation and the production of progesterone and hCG at high concentrations of genistein and daidzein in the cell lines tested. With low concentrations of genistein and daidzein we observed a stimulation of the production of hCG and a weak inhibition of proliferation in both cell lines BeWo and Jeg3. The results obtained with this study suggest that only high doses of phytoestrogens (> 1 mumol/ml) can reduce the proliferation of trophoblast tumour cells significantly. Low doses of phytoestrogens induced a higher hCG production in both cell lines tested. Although high hCG production did not lead to a higher proliferation rate of the tumour cells tested, hCG is able to induce neovascularisation in tumour\n\nAlpha or beta human chorionic gonadotropin knockdown decrease BeWo cell fusion by down-regulating PKA and CREB activation\n\nPubMed Central\n\nSaryu Malhotra, Sudha; Suman, Pankaj; Kumar Gupta, Satish\n\n2015-01-01\n\nThe aim of the present study is to delineate the role of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) in trophoblast fusion. In this direction, using shRNA lentiviral particles, Î±- and Î²-hCG silenced âBeWoâ cell lines were generated. Treatment of both Î±- and Î²-hCG silenced BeWo cells with either forskolin or exogenous hCG showed a significant reduction in cell fusion as compared with control shRNA treated cells. Studies by qRT-PCR, Western blotting and immunofluorescence revealed down-regulation of fusion-associated proteins such as syncytin-1 and syndecan-1 in the Î±- and Î²-hCG silenced cells. Delineation of downstream signaling pathways revealed that phosphorylation of PKA and CREB were compromised in the silenced cells whereas, no significant changes in p38MAPK and ERK1/2 phosphorylation were observed. Moreover, Î²-catenin activation was unaffected by either Î±- or Î²-hCG silencing. Further, inhibition of PKA by H89 inhibitor led to a significant decrease in BeWo cell fusion but had no effect on Î²-catenin activation suggesting the absence of non-canonical Î²-catenin stabilization via PKA. Interestingly, canonical activation of Î²-catenin was associated with the up-regulation of Wnt 10b expression. In summary, this study establishes the significance of hCG in the fusion of trophoblastic BeWo cells, but there may be additional factors involved in this process.

Microscopically, these 2 types of cells are intimately associated with each other, forming a characteristic biphasic plexiform pattern, however, the nature of these 2 types of trophoblastic cells is not well understood. In this study, we used immunohistochemistry for several trophoblastic markers to analyze the trophoblastic subpopulations in 36 gestational choriocarcinomas. Eighty-one specimens including placenta, complete mole, placental site nodule, epithelioid trophoblastic tumor, and placental site trophoblastic tumor were analyzed. The antibodies included Mel-CAM, HLA-G, MUC-4, and beta-catenin. A semiquantitative assessment of positive cells and the cellular localization of these markers were recorded. We found diffuse strong membranous and cytoplasmic staining for MUC-4 in mononucleate cells in all 36 cases (100%) and a similar pattern of localization in 28 cases (78%) for HLA-G. This distribution was similar to that in normal placentas, where MUC-4 and HLA-G are expressed in the trophoblastic cells of the trophoblastic columns and implantation site. In choriocarcinoma, mononucleate trophoblastic cells showed moderate immunoreactivity for Mel-CAM, a specific marker for implantation site intermediate trophoblast, in 78% of the cases. The MUC-4, HLA-G, and Mel-CAM-positive trophoblastic cells were larger than cytotrophoblastic cells, with more abundant cytoplasm, consistent with the morphology of intermediate trophoblast. In contrast, 31% of the choriocarcinomas contained a very small proportion (<5%) of mononucleate trophoblastic cells compatible with cytotrophoblast that was positive for nuclear beta-catenin, a cytotrophoblast-associated marker. These results suggest that choriocarcinoma is composed predominantly of a mixture of syncytiotrophoblast and intermediate trophoblast with only a small proportion of cytotrophoblast.

In this study, we showed that miR-218 expression levels were decreased while Fbxw8 expression levels were increased inmoreÂ Â» human choriocarcinoma cell lines, and identified Fbxw8 as a novel direct target of miR-218. Overexpression of miR-218 inhibited cell growth arrest at G2/M phase, suppressed the protein levels of cyclin A and up-regulated the expression levels of p27 through decreasing the levels of Fbxw8. On the other hand, forced expression of Fbxw8 partly rescued the effect of miR-218 in the cells, attenuated cell proliferation decrease the percentage of cells at G2/M phase, induced cyclin A protein expression and suppressed the protein level of p27 through up-regulating the levels of Fbxw8. Taken together, these findings will shed light the role to mechanism of miR-218 in regulating JEG-3 cells proliferation via miR-218/Fbxw8 axis, and miR-218 may serve as a novel potential therapeutic target in human choriocarcinoma in the future.Â«Â less\n\nExtended evaluation on the ES-D3 cell differentiation assay combined with the BeWo transport model, to predict relative developmental toxicity of triazole compounds.\n\nPubMed\n\nLi, Hequn; Flick, Burkhard; Rietjens, Ivonne M C M; Louisse, Jochem; Schneider, Steffen; van Ravenzwaay, Bennard\n\n2016-05-01\n\nThe mouse embryonic stem D3 (ES-D3) cell differentiation assay is based on the morphometric measurement of cardiomyocyte differentiation and is a promising tool to detect developmental toxicity of compounds. The BeWo transport model, consisting of BeWo b30 cells grown on transwell inserts and mimicking the placental barrier, is useful to determine relative placental transport velocities of compounds. We have previously demonstrated the usefulness of the ES-D3 cell differentiation assay in combination with the in vitro BeWo transport model to predict the relative in vivo developmental toxicity potencies of a set of reference azole compounds. To further evaluate this combined in vitro toxicokinetic and toxicodynamic approach, we combined ES-D3 cell differentiation data of six novel triazoles with relative transport rates obtained from the BeWo model and compared the obtained ranking to the developmental toxicity ranking as derived from in vivo data. The data show that the combined in vitro approach provided a correct prediction for in vivo developmental toxicity, whereas the ES-D3 cell differentiation assay as stand-alone did not. In conclusion, we have validated the combined in vitro approach for developmental toxicity, which we have previously developed with a set of reference azoles, for a set of six novel triazoles. We suggest that this combined model, which takes both toxicodynamic and toxicokinetic aspects into account, should be further validated for other chemical classes of developmental toxicants.\n\nIn vitro approaches to evaluate placental drug transport by using differentiating JEG-3 human choriocarcinoma cells.\n\nPubMed\n\nIkeda, Kenji; Utoguchi, Naoki; Tsutsui, Hidenobu; Yamaue, Satoko; Homemoto, Manami; Nakao, Erina; Hukunaga, Yumi; Yamasaki, Kyohei; Myotoku, Michiaki; Hirotani, Yoshihiko\n\n2011-02-01\n\nHuman choriocarcinoma cells have been used as models for studying transcellular drug transport through placental trophoblasts. However, these models allow the transport of low-molecular-weight drugs through intercellular gap junctions. This study aimed at investigating the differentiation patterns of JEG-3 choriocarcinoma cells under different culture conditions and establishing the appropriate model of in vitro syncytiotrophoblast drug transport. Paracellular permeability was estimated by measuring the transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) across JEG-3 cell layers. The mRNA expression levels of non-expressed in choriocarcinoma clone 1 (NECC1) and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), and those of E-cadherin (ECAD) and cadherin-11 (CDH11), which are adherens junction-associated proteins related to fusogenic ability of syncytiotrophoblasts differentiated from cytotrophoblasts, protein expression levels were considered as the differentiation signals. The highest TEER values were obtained in the JEG-3 cells cultured in the Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM)/Ham's F-12 (1:1) mixed medium (CS-C(Â®) ; Dainippon Sumitomo Pharma Co. Ltd., Osaka, Japan). By comparing the TEER values and the differentiation signals, the authors identified at least five JEG-3 cell-differentiation patterns. The differentiation pattern of JEG-3 cultured in CS-C resembled the syncytiotrophoblast-like differentiation signal characterizations in vivo. In conclusion, the syncytiotrophoblast-like models of differentiating JEG-3 cells cultured in CS-C might be appropriate for evaluating drug transport across the placental trophoblast.

It is known that members of the OCTN family play an important role in L-carnitine transport in the placenta. Investigation of drug-drug or drug-nutrient interaction in the placenta is important for establishment of safety drug medication during pregnancy. The aim of this study was to determine the effects of fluoroquinolones, inhibitors of OCTN2, on L-carnitine transport in the placenta which is known to have a high expression level of OCTN2. We investigated the inhibitory effect of five fluoroquinolones, ciprofloxacin (CPFX), gatifloxacin (GFLX), ofloxacin (OFLX), levofloxacin (LVFX) and grepafloxacin (GPFX), on L-carnitine transport mediated by OCTN2 in placental cell line BeWo cells. We found that all of the fluoroquinolones inhibited L-carnitine transport, GPFX being the strongest inhibitor. We also found that the inhibitory effects of LVFX and GPFX depended on their existence ratio of zwitterionic forms as, we reported previously. Furthermore, we elucidated the LVFX transport mechanism in BeWo cells. LVFX was transported actively by transporters. However, we found that LVFX transport was Na+-independent and l-carnitine had no inhibitory effect on LVFX transport, suggesting that LVFX acts as inhibitor of OCTN2, not as a substrate for OCTN2.\n\nCytotoxicity induced by nanobacteria and nanohydroxyapatites in human choriocarcinoma cells\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nZhang, Mingjun; Yang, Jinmei; Shu, Jing; Fu, Changhong; Liu, Shengnan; Xu, Ge; Zhang, Dechun\n\n2014-11-01\n\nWe explored the cytotoxic effects of nanobacteria (NB) and nanohydroxyapatites (nHAPs) against human choriocarcinoma cells (JAR) and the mechanisms of action underlying their cytotoxicity. JAR cells were co-cultured with NB and nHAPs for 48 h, and ultrastructural changes were more readily induced by NB than nHAPs. Autophagy in the plasma of JAR cells were observed in the NB group. The rate of apoptosis induced by NB was higher than that for nHAPs. The expression of Bax and FasR proteins in the NB group was stronger than that for the nHAP group. NB probably resulted in autophagic formation. Apoptosis was possibly activated via FasL binding to the FasR signaling pathway.\n\nGenetic and Dietary Regulation of Glyburide Efflux by the Human Placental Breast Cancer Resistance Protein Transporter.\n\nPubMed\n\nBircsak, Kristin M; Gupta, Vivek; Yuen, Poi Yu Sofia; Gorczyca, Ludwik; Weinberger, Barry I; Vetrano, Anna M; Aleksunes, Lauren M\n\n2016-04-01\n\nGlyburide is frequently used to treat gestational diabetes owing to its low fetal accumulation resulting from placental efflux by the breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP)/ABCG2 transporter. Here we sought to determine how exposure to the dietary phytoestrogen genistein and expression of a loss-of-function polymorphism in the ABCG2 gene (C421A) impacted the transport of glyburide by BCRP using stably transfected human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK) cells, human placental choriocarcinoma BeWo cells, and human placental explants. Genistein competitively inhibited the BCRP-mediated transport of (3)H-glyburide in both wild-type (WT) and C421A-BCRP HEK-expressing cells, with greater accumulation of (3)H-glyburide in cells expressing the C421A variant. In BeWo cells, exposure to genistein for 60 minutes increased the accumulation of (3)H-glyburide 30%-70% at concentrations relevant to dietary exposure (IC50 â¼180 nM). Continuous exposure of BeWo cells to genistein for 48 hours reduced the expression of BCRP mRNA and protein by up to 40%, which impaired BCRP transport activity. Pharmacologic antagonism of the estrogen receptor attenuated the genistein-mediated downregulation of BCRP expression, suggesting that phytoestrogens may reduce BCRP levels through this hormone receptor pathway in BeWo cells. Interestingly, genistein treatment for 48 hours did not alter BCRP protein expression in explants dissected from healthy term placentas. These data suggest that whereas genistein can act as a competitive inhibitor of BCRP-mediated transport, its ability to downregulate placental BCRP expression may only occur in choriocarcinoma cells. Overall, this research provides important mechanistic data regarding how the environment (dietary genistein) and a frequent genetic variant (ABCG2, C421A) may alter the maternal-fetal disposition of glyburide.

It has a tendency for widespread metastasis, common sites for which include the lung, vagina, brain, liver, bone, intestine, and kidney. We describe a 30-year-old female who presented with hepatitis-like features and bilateral diminution of vision, and subsequently developed hemothorax and hemoperitoneum-all rare and seemingly unrelated manifestations which were finally attributable to metastases from gestational choriocarcinoma. To further complicate the clinical scenario, the serum HCG of the patient was mildly raised (due to a phenomenon called hook effect). Subsequently, the patient developed disseminated intravascular coagulation and succumbed to her illness. In this report, we discuss the imaging findings of choriocarcinoma, its potential sites of metastases, and the hook effect.\n\nPrimary pure choriocarcinoma of the liver.\n\nPubMed\n\nFernÃ¡ndez Alonso, J; SÃ¡ez, C; PÃ©rez, P; MontaÃ±o, A; JapÃ³n, M A\n\n1992-04-01\n\nWe report a pure choriocarcinoma of the liver studied at necropsy.

It has a variety of biological properties including anti-oxidant, anti-mutagenic, anti-carcinogenic, anti-inflammatory, anti-proliferative, and anti-spasmodic effects. Based on epidemiological and case-control studies, apigenin is regarded as a novel chemotherapeutic agent against various cancer types. However, little is known about the effects of apigenin on choriocarcinoma cells. Therefore, we investigated the anti-cancer effects of apigenin on choriocarcinoma cells (JAR and JEG3) in the present study. Apigenin reduced viability and migratory properties, increased apoptosis, and suppressed mitochondrial membrane potential in both the JAR and JEG3 cells. In addition, apigenin predominantly decreased phosphorylation of AKT, P70RSK, and S6 whereas the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and P90RSK was increased by apigenin treatment of JAR and JEG3 cells in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, treatment of JAR and JEG3 cells with both apigenin and pharmacological inhibitors of PI3K/AKT (LY294002) and ERK1/2 (U0126) revealed synergistic anti-proliferative effects. Collectively, these results indicated that the apigenin is an invaluable chemopreventive agent that inhibits progression and metastasis of choriocarcinoma cells through regulation of PI3K/AKT and ERK1/2 MAPK signal transduction mechanism.

In addition, the antiâB19 antibodies induced by B19 infection are believed to have a cytopathic role in B19 transmission; however, knowledge regarding the effects of antiâB19 antibodies during pregnancy is limited. To investigate the possible roles of antiâB19 antibodies during pregnancy, the present study examined the effects of antiâB19âVP1Â unique region (VP1u), antiâB19âVP2 and antiâB19ânonstructural proteinÂ 1 (NS1) immunoglobulinÂ G (IgG) antibodies on BeWo trophoblasts. Briefly, BeWo trophoblasts were incubated with purified IgG against B19âVP1u, B19âVP2 and B19âNS1. Subsequently, the expression of surface proteins and apoptotic molecules were assessed in BeWo trophoblasts using flow cytometry, ELISA and western blotting. The expression levels of human leukocyte antigen (HLA)âG were significantly increased on BeWo trophoblasts treated with rabbit antiâB19âVP1u IgG, and were unchanged in those treated with rabbit antiâB19âNS1 and antiâB19âVP2 IgG, as compared with the control group. Furthermore, the expression levels of globoside (PÂ blood group antigen) and cluster of differentiation (CD)29 (Î²1Â integrin) were significantly increased in BeWo trophoblasts treated with rabbit antiâB19âNS1 and antiâB19âVP2 IgG, whereas only CD29 was also significantly increased in cells treated with antiâB19âVP1u IgG. In addition, the number of cells at subâG1 phase; caspaseâ3 activity; and the expression of intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic molecules, including Fasâassociated death domain protein, activated caspaseâ8, activated caspaseâ3, Bâcell lymphomaÂ 2âassociated X protein, cytochromeÂ c, apoptotic peptidase activating factorÂ 1 and activated caspaseâ9, were significantly increased in BeWo trophoblasts treated with antiâB19âVP1u and antiâB19âNS1 IgG.

Here, we examine the effect of resistin on glucose uptake in human trophoblast cells and we demonstrate that transplacental glucose transport is mediated by glucose transporter (GLUT)-1. Furthermore, we evaluate the type of signal transduction induced by resistin in GLUT-1 regulation. BeWo choriocarcinoma cells and primary cytotrophoblast cells were cultured with increasing resistin concentrations for 24 hrs. The main outcome measures include glucose transport assay using [(3)H]-2-deoxy glucose, GLUT-1 protein expression by Western blot analysis and GLUT-1 mRNA detection by quantitative real-time RT-PCR. Quantitative determination of phospho(p)-ERK1/2 in cell lysates was performed by an Enzyme Immunometric Assay and Western blot analysis. Our data demonstrate a direct effect of resistin on normal cytotrophoblastic and on BeWo cells: resistin modulates glucose uptake, GLUT-1 messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) and protein expression in placental cells. We suggest that ERK1/2 phosphorylation is involved in the GLUT-1 regulation induced by resistin. In conclusion, resistin causes activation of both the ERK1 and 2 pathway in trophoblast cells. ERK1 and 2 activation stimulated GLUT-1 synthesis and resulted in increase of placental glucose uptake. High resistin levels (50-100 ng/ml) seem able to affect glucose-uptake, presumably by decreasing the cell surface glucose transporter.\n\nHuman trophoblast-derived hydrogen sulfide stimulates placental artery endothelial cell angiogenesis.\n\nPubMed\n\nChen, Dong-Bao; Feng, Lin; Hodges, Jennifer K; Lechuga, Thomas J; Zhang, Honghai\n\n2017-09-01\n\nEndogenous hydrogen sulfide (H2S), mainly synthesized by cystathionine Î²-synthase (CBS) and cystathionine Î³-lyase (CTH), has been implicated in regulating placental angiogenesis; however, the underlying mechanisms are unknown. This study was to test a hypothesis that trophoblasts synthesize H2S to promote placental angiogenesis. Human choriocarcinoma-derived BeWo cells expressed both CBS and CTH proteins, while the first trimester villous trophoblast-originated HTR-8/SVneo cells expressed CTH protein only. The H2S producing ability of BeWo cells was significantly inhibited by either inhibitors of CBS (carboxymethyl hydroxylamine hemihydrochloride, CHH) or CTH (Î²-cyano-L-alanine, BCA) and that in HTR-8/SVneo cells was inhibited by CHH only. H2S donors stimulated cell proliferation, migration, and tube formation in ovine placental artery endothelial cells (oFPAECs) as effectively as vascular endothelial growth factor. Co-culture with BeWo and HTR-8/SVneo cells stimulated oFPAEC migration, which was inhibited by CHH or BCA in BeWo but CHH only in HTR-8/SVneo cells. Primary human villous trophoblasts (HVT) were more potent than trophoblast cell lines in stimulating oFPAEC migration that was inhibited by CHH and CHH/BCA combination in accordance with its H2S synthesizing activity linked to CBS and CTH expression patterns. H2S donors activated endothelial nitric oxide synthase (NOS3), v-AKT murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog 1 (AKT1), and extracellular signal-activated kinase 1/2 (mitogen-activated protein kinase 3/1, MAPK3/1) in oFPAECs. H2S donor-induced NOS3 activation was blocked by AKT1 but not MAPK3/1 inhibition. In keeping with our previous studies showing a crucial role of AKT1, MAPK3/1, and NOS3/NO in placental angiogenesis, these data show that trophoblast-derived endogenous H2S stimulates placental angiogenesis, involving activation of AKT1, NOS3/NO, and MAPK3/1.

Investigating the fusion process in a placenta in vivo is very challenging given the complexity of this process. Application of primary cultured cytotrophoblast cells isolated from term placentas and BeWo cells derived from human choriocarcinoma formulates a biphasic strategy to achieve the mechanism of trophoblast cell fusion, as the former can spontaneously fuse to form the multinucleated syncytium and the latter is capable of fusing under the treatment of forskolin (FSK). Live-cell imaging is a powerful tool that is widely used to investigate many physiological or pathological processes in various animal models or humans; however, to our knowledge, the mechanism of trophoblast cell fusion has not been reported using a live- cell imaging manner. In this study, a live-cell imaging system was used to delineate the fusion process of primary term cytotrophoblast cells and BeWo cells. By using live staining with Hoechst 33342 or cytoplasmic dyes or by stably transfecting enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) and DsRed2-Nuc reporter plasmids, we observed finger-like protrusions on the cell membranes of fusion partners before fusion and the exchange of cytoplasmic contents during fusion. In summary, this study provides the first video recording of the process of trophoblast syncytialization. Furthermore, the various live-cell imaging systems used in this study will help to yield molecular insights into the syncytialization process during placental development.

To our knowledge, only 14 cases have been reported in the past 10 years in the pubmed. We have an uncommon case of testicular choriocarcinoma who has metastasized to the adjacent skin and organ systems. An 18-year-old male was diagnosed with initial presentation of cutaneous mass at the left back. Followly,biopsy was performed under local anesthesia.Histopathological examination was consistent with the diagnosis of metastatic choriocarcinoma. The histopathological assessment of the biopsied tissue, in combination with elevated serum Î²-HCG levels and presentation of testicular mass, indicated primary testicular choriocarcinoma with cutaneous and systemic metastasis. Subsequently radical orchiectomy was performed. Despite the case completed one cycle of cisplatin-based regimen chemotherapy, he died of multiple organ dysfunction syndrome 2 months after surgery. In this report, cutaneous metastasis with testicular choriocarcinoma is extremely rare. It is important to recognize that this unusual variant of testicular choriocarcinoma has the potential to behave aggressively and to metastasize.\n\nEffects of Phytoestrogen Extracts Isolated from Elder Flower on Hormone Production and Receptor Expression of Trophoblast Tumor Cells JEG-3 and BeWo, as well as MCF7 Breast Cancer Cells\n\nPubMed Central\n\nSchrÃ¶der, Lennard; Richter, Dagmar Ulrike; Piechulla, Birgit; Chrobak, Mareike; Kuhn, Christina; Schulze, Sandra; Abarzua, Sybille; Jeschke, Udo; Weissenbacher, Tobias\n\n2016-01-01\n\nHerein we investigated the effect of elderflower extracts (EFE) and of enterolactone/enterodiol on hormone production and proliferation of trophoblast tumor cell lines JEG-3 and BeWo, as well as MCF7 breast cancer cells. The EFE was analyzed by mass spectrometry. Cells were incubated with various concentrations of EFE. Untreated cells served as controls. Supernatants were tested for estradiol production with an ELISA method. Furthermore, the effect of the EFE on ERÎ±/ERÎ²/PR expression was assessed by immunocytochemistry. EFE contains a substantial amount of lignans. Estradiol production was inhibited in all cells in a concentration-dependent manner. EFE upregulated ERÎ± in JEG-3 cell lines. In MCF7 cells, a significant ERÎ± downregulation and PR upregulation were observed. The control substances enterolactone and enterodiol in contrast inhibited the expression of both ER and of PR in MCF7 cells. In addition, the production of estradiol was upregulated in BeWo and MCF7 cells in a concentration dependent manner. The downregulating effect of EFE on ERÎ± expression and the upregulation of the PR expression in MFC-7 cells are promising results. Therefore, additional unknown substances might be responsible for ERÎ± downregulation and PR upregulation. These findings suggest potential use of EFE in breast cancer prevention and/or treatment and warrant further investigation.

It occurs primarily in gonads but rarely in extragonadal sites. Primary hepatic choriocarcinoma is an extremely rare tumor. Most of the reported cases are seen in infants representing metastasis from an occult placental choriocarcinoma. Till date, only 7 cases of primary hepatic choriocarcinoma in adults have been reported in literature. We present a case of a 40-yearold male presenting as haemoperitoneum due to ruptured hepatic tumor. He underwent emergency left lateral segmentectomy. He died on 10th postoperative day. The surgical specimen and autopsy findings confirmed it to be primary hepatic choriocarcinoma. This is the first case report from Indian Subcontinent. A brief case report and review of literature is presented.

It infrequently presents as spontaneous renal haemorrhage (SRH). Genital malformation and SRH secondary to choriocarcinoma has previously been only reported in females. We present what we believe to be the first case of a male patient with genital malformation (hypospadias and cryptorchidism) and SRH at presentation of choriocarcinoma. A 25-year-old man presented to the department with intense pain in the right flank region and lower back. Initial investigations showed spontaneous renal haemorrhage, for which an emergency partial nephrectomy was performed. Clinical, radiological, and pathological investigations suggested a diagnosis of testicular choriocarcinoma with metastases to the right kidney, both lungs, and brain. Initial treatment was with a chemotherapy regimen of cisplatin, etoposide and bleomycin and whole brain radiotherapy; however, 6Â months after diagnosis the patient developed liver metastasis, after which time the BEP protocol was switched to ITP with oral apatinib. Despite best efforts, the liver and lung metastasis continued to grow and a decision was made to discontinue active treatment and provide only palliative care until the patient passed away. Choriocarcinoma is a difficult cancer to diagnose pre-operatively. In male patients with early metastasis, prognosis may be much poorer than in the commoner gestational choriocarcinoma. A multidisciplinary with comprehensive post-surgical intervention is of great importance in the treatment of these patients.\n\nExposure to ethanol and nicotine induces stress responses in human placental BeWo cells.\n\nPubMed\n\nRepo, Jenni K; Pesonen, Maija; Mannelli, Chiara; VÃ¤hÃ¤kangas, Kirsi; Loikkanen, Jarkko\n\n2014-01-13\n\nHuman placental trophoblastic cancer BeWo cells can be used as a model of placental trophoblasts. We found that combined exposure to relevant exposure concentrations of ethanol (2â°) and nicotine (15 Î¼M) induces an increase in the amount of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Neither ethanol or nicotine alone, nor their combination affected cell viability. However, nicotine decreased cell proliferation, both alone and combined with ethanol. Nicotine increased the expression of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-stress related protein GRP78/BiP, but not another marker of ER-stress, IRE1Î±. We also studied the effects of nicotine and/or ethanol on phosphorylation and expression of three mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), i.e. JNK, p38 and ERK1/2. Nicotine decreased the phosphorylation of JNK and also had similar effect on total amount of this protein. Phosphorylation and expression of p38 were increased 1.7- and 1.6-fold, respectively, by nicotine alone, and 1.9- and 2.1-fold by the combined treatment. Some increase (1.8-fold) was also seen in the phosphorylation of ERK2 at 48 h, in cells exposed to both ethanol and nicotine. This study shows that ethanol and nicotine, which harm the development of fetus may induce both oxidative and ER stress responses in human placental trophoblastic cells, implicating these mechanisms in their fetotoxic effects.

The hybridoma supernates were screened against the testicular carcinoma cells used in the immunization as well as normal mononuclear white blood cells isolated from the same patient. An antibody (5F9) was selected which bound to fresh tumor cells from two patients with embryonal testicular carcinoma and failed to bind to fresh tumor cells from 24 patients (2 seminoma, 2 melanoma, 3 neck, 2 esophageal, 1 ovarian,moreÂ Â» 3 colon, 1 prostate, 2 breast, 1 liposarcoma, 3 endometrial, 1 kidney, 1 adrenal, 1 larynx and 1 bladder tumors) or cell suspensions prepared from normal liver, lung, spleen, ovary, testes, kidney, red blood cells or white blood cells. The antibody was tested for its binding to several well established cancer cell lines, and was found to bind to the BeWo human choriocarcinoma and two human embryonal carcinoma cell lines. The antibody did not react with 22 other cell lines or with hCG. The antibody was labeled with /sup 131/I and injected into nude mice bearing BeWo tumors and evaluated for tumor localization by performing whole body scans with a gamma camera 5 days later. Six mice injected with the antibody showed positive tumor localization without the need for background subtraction while six mice injected with MOPC-21, a murine myeloma immunoglobulin, demonstrated much less tumor localization. Tissue distribution studies performed after scanning showed specific tumor localization (8:1 tumor: muscle) for the monoclonal antibody and no specific localization for MOPC-21.Â«Â less\n\nBiotin supply affects rates of cell proliferation, biotinylation of carboxylases and histones, and expression of the gene encoding the sodium-dependent multivitamin transporter in JAr choriocarcinoma cells.\n\nPubMed\n\nCrisp, Sarah E R H; Griffin, Jacob B; White, Brett R; Toombs, Candice F; Camporeale, Gabriela; Said, Hamid M; Zempleni, Janos\n\n2004-02-01\n\nPlacental transfer of nutrients and secretion of hormones is essential for normal fetal development. To determine whether biotin supply affects biotin homeostasis, proliferation rates, and progesterone secretion in placenta cells. JAr choriocarcinoma cells were cultured in media containing deficient (25 pmol/L), physiological (250 pmol/L), or pharmacological concentrations (10,000 pmol/L) of biotin for three weeks; markers for biotin homeostasis, proliferation, and hormone secretion were quantified. Biotin concentrations in culture media correlated negatively with expression of the biotin transporter SMVT, as judged by cellular transport rates of biotin, abundance of SMVT protein, and transcriptional activity of SMVT reporter-gene constructs. Notwithstanding this homeostatic mechanism, biotin concentrations in media correlated positively with activities of biotin-dependent propionyl-CoA carboxylase, abundance of biotinylated carboxylases, and with biotinylation of histones. Biotin deficiency was associated with decreased rates of thymidine uptake into JAr cells [pmol thymidine/( 10(6) cells x 24 h)]: 1.6 +/- 0.1 (25 pmol/L biotin) versus 2.3 +/- 0.2 (250 pmol/L biotin) versus 3.7 +/- 0.4 (10,000 pmol/L biotin), suggesting that cell proliferation depends on biotin. Secretion of progesterone was reduced in biotin-deficient cells; this effect was caused by reduced generation of new cells in deficient media rather than by an immediate effect of biotin on progesterone secretion at the singlecell-level. This study provides evidence that choriocarcinoma cells cannot maintain normal activities of biotin-dependent metabolic pathways if biotin concentrations in culture media are low. It is uncertain whether activities of biotin-dependent pathways in placenta affect fetal development in vivo.\n\nGenomic profile in gestational and non-gestational choriocarcinomas.\n\nPubMed\n\nMello, Julia Bette Homem de; Ramos Cirilo, Priscila Daniele; Michelin, Odair Carlito; CustÃ³dio Domingues, Maria Aparecida; Cunha Rudge, Marilza Vieira; Rogatto, Silvia Regina; MaestÃ¡, Izildinha\n\n2017-02-01\n\nGestational (GC) (derived from the placenta) and non-gestational (NGC) choriocarcinomas are trophoblastic diseases originated from abnormal proliferation of trophoblastic cells. These rare tumors share similar morphology and pathological features and differ on chemotherapy response, genetic origin and prognosis. In this study, the genomic profile of choriocarcinomas was performed according to their origin (GC or NGC) aiming to better understand these poorly characterized diseases. Thirteen patients were included in this study; 10 presented previous history of hydatidiform mole and six developed metastasis. Twelve polymorphic microsatellite markers (D15S659, APOC2, D5S816, BAT25, D3S1614, D3S1311, D1S1656, APC-D5S346, D3S1601, D18S70, D8S1110 and D11S1999) were investigated to distinguish GC from NGC. All choriocarcinomas were evaluated by copy number alterations using array CGH. Eight cases were classified as GC and five as NGC. Although potentially polymorphic, NGC exhibited significant gain of 21p11. Rare copy number alterations (CNA) were detected as a frequent event in GC including gains of 1p36.33-p36.32 (3 cases), 17q25.3 (4 cases), and losses of 9q33.1 (5 cases), 17q21.3 (3 cases) and 18q22.1 (4 cases) (varying from 724 to 3,053Â Kb). Two tumor suppressor genes are candidates to be involved in GC: TRIM32 (9q33.1) and CDH19 (18q22.1). Gains of CBX2, CBX4 and CBX8 were frequently found in high risk prognostic score in GC. The in silico functional interaction analysis revealed the involvement of PTEN and PI3K-Akt signaling pathways. These data pointed out significant genomic alterations in GC, opening new avenues to better characterize the pathobiology of this disease. Copyright Â© 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Theander, Thor; R. Hansson, Stefan; Salanti, Ali\n\n2016-01-01\n\nDuring placental malaria, Plasmodium falciparum infected erythrocytes sequester in the placenta, causing health problems for both the mother and fetus. The specific adherence is mediated by the VAR2CSA protein, which binds to placental chondroitin sulfate (CS) on chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs) in the placental syncytium. However, the identity of the CSPG core protein and the cellular impact of the interaction have remain elusive. In this study we identified the specific CSPG core protein to which the CS is attached, and characterized its exact placental location. VAR2CSA pull-down experiments using placental extracts from whole placenta or syncytiotrophoblast microvillous cell membranes showed three distinct CSPGs available for VAR2CSA adherence. Further examination of these three CSPGs by immunofluorescence and proximity ligation assays showed that syndecan-1 is the main receptor for VAR2CSA mediated placental adherence. We further show that the commonly used placental choriocarcinoma cell line, BeWo, express a different set of proteoglycans than those present on placental syncytiotrophoblast and may not be the most biologically relevant model to study placental malaria. Syncytial fusion of the BeWo cells, triggered by forskolin treatment, caused an increased expression of placental CS-modified syndecan-1. In line with this, we show that rVAR2 binding to placental CS impairs syndecan-1-related Src signaling in forskolin treated BeWo cells, but not in untreated cells.

One of the biggest problems of the in vitro culture of these tumor cells using the xenotransplanted tumors had been the dense contamination of fibroblasts of host nude mouse origin. In the present study, these fibroblasts were completely removed by incubating the cells with antiserum raised against nude mouse spleen cells. The cell line established from the remaining tumor cells has been successfully propagated in vitro for as long as 4 years. These cells show the morphology of epithelioid cells containing a prominent nucleus with one or two large nucleoli. The cells grow in a monolayered sheet with the population-doubling time of 19 hr. The cells show perfect tumor takes when they are reinoculated into nude mice. Chromosomal analysis revealed that the cell is a human aneuploid one with a hypotriploid mode. These cultured cells maintained well the function of secreting large amounts of human chorionic gonadotropin, progesterone, and estrogen. The secretion of human chorionic gonadotropin and progesterone by these cells is enhanced by stimulation with tumor promoters, such as 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate and teleocidin B, or with epidermal growth factor in a dose-and time-dependent manner. Interestingly, however, the tumor promoters did not exert a marked effect on the cellular binding of epidermal growth factor, indicating that the receptors for these reagents in T3M-3 cells are not shared by epidermal growth factor.\n\nExpression of NADPH Oxidase Isoform 1 (Nox1) in Human Placenta: Involvement in Preeclampsia\n\nPubMed Central\n\nCui, X.-L.; Brockman, D.; Campos, B.; Myatt, L.\n\n2010-01-01\n\nIncreased oxidative stress in the placenta has been associated with preeclampsia (PE), a clinical syndrome involving placental pathology. The enzymatic sources of reactive oxygen species in the human placenta are as yet unidentified. We hypothesized that NADPH oxidase is a main source of reactive oxygen species in the placenta and its expression may change in PE. Employing RTPCR, we have amplified a novel NADPH oxidase isoform Nox1 from human choriocarcinoma BeWo cells. Using polyclonal anti-peptide antiserum recognizing unique Nox1 peptide sequences, we identified by immunohistochemistry and cell fractionation that Nox1 protein localizes in the BeWo cell membrane structures. Immunohistochemistry of normal placental tissues showed that Nox1 was localized in syncytiotrophoblasts, in villous vascular endothelium, and in some stromal cells. At the immunohistochemical level Nox1 expression was significantly increased in syncytiotrophoblast and endothelial cells in placentas from patients with preeclampsia as compared to gestational age-matched controls. Western blot analysis of whole placental homogenate confirmed this increase. Our data suggests that increased Nox1 expression is associated with the increased oxidative stress found in these placentas.

This metastasis was the first sign of disease that led to medical consultation. Histopathology revealed cytotrophoblasts and syncytiotrophoblasts, the later expressing human chorionic gonadotropin antigen. Whole body computed tomography showed multiple metastases of the brain, lung, liver, bone, paraaortic lymph nodes and left uvea; the primary was found in the left testicle. Despite neurosurgical intervention and chemotherapy the patient died 9 days after the biopsy of the cutaneous metastasis. Cutaneous metastases of testicular choriocarcinoma are exceptionally rare, with fewer than a dozen cases reported in the English-language literature. The present case highlights that testicular choriocarcinoma metastatic to the skin should be included in the differential of cutaneous scalp tumors. Â© 2018 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Notch2 and Notch3 expression in BeWo and JAR cells was upregulated or downregulated using lentivirus-mediated overexpression or RNA interference. The effect of Notch2 and Notch3 on cell proliferation was assessed by the CCK-8 assay. The effect of Notch2 and Notch3 on the apoptosis of BeWo and JAR cells was evaluated by flow cytometry using the Annexin V-PE Apoptosis kit. Lentivirus-based overexpression vectors were constructed by cloning the full-length coding sequences of human Notch2 and Notch3 C-terminally tagged with GFP or GFP alone (control) into a lentivirus-based expression vector. Lentivirus-based gene silencing vectors were prepared by cloning small interfering sequences targeting human Notch2 and Notch3 and scrambled control RNA sequence into a lentivirus-based gene knockdown vector. The effect of Notch2 and Notch3 on cell proliferation was assessed by the CCK-8 assay. And the effect of Notch2 and Notch3 on the apoptosis of BeWo and JAR cells was evaluated by flow cytometry using the Annexin V PE Apoptosis kit. We found that the downregulation of Notch2 and Notch3 gene expression in BeWo and JAR cells resulted in an increase in cell proliferation, while upregulation of Notch3 and Notch2 expression led to a decrease in cell proliferation. Moreover, the overexpression of Notch3 and Notch2 in BeWo and JAR cells reduced apoptosis in these trophoblast cell lines, whereas apoptosis was increased in the cells in which the expression of Notch3 and Notch2 was downregulated. Notch2 and Notch3 inhibited both cell proliferation and cell apoptosis in BeWo and JAR trophoblast cell lines.\n\nThe biosynthesis, processing, and secretion of laminin by human choriocarcinoma cells.\n\nPubMed\n\nPeters, B P; Hartle, R J; Krzesicki, R F; Kroll, T G; Perini, F; Balun, J E; Goldstein, I J; Ruddon, R W\n\n1985-11-25\n\nLaminin, a glycoprotein component of basal laminae, is synthesized and secreted in culture by a human malignant cell line (JAR) derived from gestational choriocarcinoma. Biosynthetically labeled human laminin subunits A (Mr approximately 400,000) and B (Mr = 200,000 doublet) are glycoslyated with asparagine-linked high mannose oligosaccharides that are processed to complex oligosaccharides before the laminin molecule is externalized by the cell. The rate-limiting step in the processing of the asparagine-linked glycans of laminin is at the point of action of alpha-mannosidase I since the principal laminin forms that accumulate in JAR cells contain Man9GlcNAc2 and Man8GlcNAc2 oligosaccharide units. The combination of subunits to form the disulfide-linked laminin molecule (Mr approximately 950,000) occurs rapid"
