        "text": "A good night's sleep is important for functioning throughout the day. I can always tell when I didn't sleep well, and so can the people around me.\n\nI get irritable, have trouble paying attention, react slower, feel sluggish and tired, and don't feel like talking to people. I'm sure you've noticed some of the same symptoms.\n\nOne reason you may be getting crappy sleep is because you have a crappy pillow. Yep, that pillow you can't wait to hit at night may not be the proper one.\n\nThat's heavy information, right?\n\nI had never heard of proper pillow-picking etiquette either. Then I started researching and found everything you never knew you needed to know about pillow picking. The site I chose to do the research is A.A.R.P.\n\nSleep experts suggest that you figure out the answer to these questions.\n\nDo you like a soft or a firm pillow?\n\nWhen you fall asleep, what is your starting sleep position?\n\nDo you sweat at night?\n\nDo you have allergies?\n\nWhat kind of sleeper are you?\n\nStomach - You'll want a thin or extra-soft pillow to keep your neck from arching backward too far.\n\nSide Sleeper - Choosing a thicker, medium-firm pillow style is best.\n\nBack Sleeper - Soft, flat pillow to align your back and spine.\n\nPosition switching Sleeper - A pillow that allows you to change the height and firmness by adding stuffing.\n\nYou have plenty of materials to choose from when looking for a pillow.\n\nMicrofiber - Soft\n\nFeather - Soft\n\nDown - Soft\n\nMemory Foam - Firm\n\nLatex- Firm\n\nKapok - Soft fiber that is often combined with shredded memory foam\n\nEven a large selection of special pillows may be an option.\n\nCooling Technology - Helps people fall asleep and stay asleep longer.\n\nAllergen-free - If you have allergies or asthma, you'll want to avoid down, feathers, and latex. Find a pillow that has been treated to prevent this that can trigger you.\n\nWedge - If you snore, the wedge can help reduce snoring, sleep apnea issues, and acid reflux.\n\nMusic - Some people like to listen to music or sounds. These pillows are equipped with technology that allows you to play audio from them.\n\nHere's a video that may help you understand the importance of a good pillow.\n\n5 Expert Tips to Help You Sleep Better Each Night\n\nIf you're having a hard time getting good sleep at night, here are 5 tips from experts to help you get restful sleep.\n\nGallery Credit: Billy Jenkins\n\nThe Cast of Sleepless in Seattle: Where Are They Now?\n\nWhere were you when the movie Sleepless in Seattle came out in 1993?\n\nGallery Credit: Reesha Cosby\n\nMore From My Country 95.5"
