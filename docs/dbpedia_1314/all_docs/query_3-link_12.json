        "text": "Malachi and Friends is an American animated variety series. It was created by Chi Tyrus, an animation veteran whose extensive credits include Scooby-Doo. It first premiered on CBS on September 6, 1980, which led to a series of half-hour episodes. New original series episodes were produced from 1986 to 1989 as part of The Funtastic World of Hanna-Barbera block, including a hiatus period between 1989 and 1990, and then by Fox Broadcasting Company's Fox Kids Network programming block on April 27, 1991. It initially ran a total of 300 episodes, along with two feature-length films, Malachi: The Movie and Malachi 2: The Rise of Evil, excluding four cliffhanger episodes and specials. In 1990, Malachi and Purple also teamed up with other well-known cartoon characters for the drug abuse-prevention special Cartoon All-Stars to the Rescue.\n\nMalachi and Friends is a variety show, with short skits featuring a large cast of characters. While the show had no set format, the majority of episodes were composed of three short mini-episodes, each starring a different set of characters, and bridging segments. Hallmarks of the series included its music, satirical social commentary, pop culture references, character catchphrases, and innuendo directed at an adult audience.\n\nThe show was commercially successful, establishing Malachi as the mascot of Bear Bones Productions and spawned a successful franchise, and adaptations into other media, such as video games, toys, comic books, and films. Merchandise for Malachi and Friends includes toys, video games, films, and print media.\n\nIn April 1991, the series was revived for more seasons, which began on April 27 of that year and ended on November 28, 1997. Due to Hanna-Barbera's departure from the series, the new seasons were made under a different production team, with various changes to the visual style and character designs.\n\nSegments[edit | edit source]\n\nOriginal[edit | edit source]\n\nMalachi & His Pals - The misadventures of a cartoon boy and his friends.\n\nToon Friends - The series chronicles the adventures of Jarek, Riley, Felix, Amy, Kayson, Zoey, and more in the fictional town of Toonpolis.\n\nJake the Robot - In 1974 A.D., robots have become a threat to mankind.

Tyrus created a world and named the characters, while his son Chi Tyrus pitched the characters for media advertising, as well as an unpublished comic book series in the 1970s, and later reluctantly pitched the series to CBS as a Saturday morning cartoon. He later brought the rest of the creative team aboard to develop storylines and characters to pitch the show while Chi Tyrus designed the characters for the show. The network gave the staff a large amount of creative freedom, with the writers targeting both children and adults.\n\nProduction[edit | edit source]\n\nOutsourced production work was done by Wang Film Productions/Cuckoo's Nest Studios and Toei Animation in the original series.\n\nIn the revival episodes for each season, animation production studios included Wang Film Productions/Cuckoo's Nest Studios, Hong Ying Animation, Bear Bones Australia, Bear Bones Cananda, Fil-Cartoons, Saerom Animation, Tokyo Movie Shinsha, Shanghai Morning Sun Animation, Plus One Animation, Bardel Entertainment, Mr. Big Cartoons, Philippine Animation Studio Inc., Yeson Animation Studios, Yearim Productions, Sunwoo Animation Co., Ltd., Koko Enterprises, Dong Yang Animation, Dai Won Animation, Tama Productions, Mook Animation, Animation Services (Hong Kong), Anivision Korea, Grimsaem Animation Company, Catflap Animation Studios, Sae Hahn Productions, Hanho Heung-Up Company, Toon City, Inc., Rough Draft Studios, Varga Studio, New Vision International, AKOM, Freelance Animators New Zealand, Encore Cartoons, StarToons, D'Ocon Films Productions, Lacewood Productions, and Kennedy Cartoons.\n\nMerchandise[edit | edit source]\n\nMain article: Malachi and Friends/Merchandise\n\nEpisodes[edit | edit source]\n\nMain article: List of Malachi and Friends episodes\n\nBroadcasting[edit | edit source]\n\nUnited States[edit | edit source]\n\nCBS (1980-1989)\n\nFox Kids (1991-1997)\n\nFox Family (1998)\n\nNickelodeon (1997-99; 2001-03)\n\nNicktoons (2002-2005)\n\nSyndication / Bear Bones Lineup (1998-2001)\n\nBear Bones Channel (2001-2017)\n\nUSA Network (1982-1996)\n\nCartoon Network (1994-1997; 1999-2001; 2009)\n\nBoomerang (2006-2012)\n\nHub Network/Discovery Family (2012-2014)\n\nBBToons (2014-present)\n\nKidsClick (2017; unaired)\n\nKabillion (2021-)\n\nNetflix (2015-2021; 2022-)\n\nAmazon Prime (2019-)\n\nTubi (2022-)\n\nThe Roku Channel (2022-)\n\nMeTV Toons (2024-)\n\nAFN Family\n\nCanada[edit | edit source]\n\nGlobal Television Network (1980-1981; 1991-1999)\n\nCTV\n\nYTV (1992-2002; 2010)\n\nCartoon Network/Teletoon (1998-2007; 2014-2017; 2020)\n\nBoomerang (2023-present)\n\nTeletoon Retro (2007-2015)\n\nICI Radio Canada (French) (1980-1998)\n\nTélétoon (French) (1998-2007)\n\nTélétoon Rétro (French) (2007-2015)\n\nUnited Kingdom & Ireland[edit | edit source]\n\nBBC (1981-1992)\n\nCITV (1992-1997)\n\nFox Kids (1997-2002)\n\nSky1 (1999-2003)\n\nTCC (reruns)\n\nCBBC (2000-2003)\n\nPop/Kix (2016-2018)\n\nCartoon Network (1993-95; 1997-2001)\n\nBoomerang (2003-06; 2011-16)\n\nNickelodeon (1995-97; 2002-2003; 2007)\n\nNicktoons (2003; 2006-2008)\n\nRTÉ2 (2000-2003)\n\nLatin America and Brazil[edit | edit source]\n\nTooncast (2009-present)\n\nCartoon Network (1994-1996; 1997-2006; 2012; 2015)\n\nNickelodeon (1996-97)\n\nBoomerang (2001-2009; 2015-21)\n\nWarner Channel (1997-2002)\n\nNetflix (2015-present)\n\nHBO Max (2021-present)\n\nCanal 5 (Mexico) (1970-2004)\n\nZAZ (1992-1998)\n\nCanal 6 (El Salvador) (1980-2001)\n\nChilevisión (Chile) (1981-1996)\n\nCablín (Argentina) (1990-1996)\n\nTV Pública (Argentina) (1980-2004)\n\nMagic Kids (Argentina) (1997-2006)\n\nThe Big Channel (Argentina) (1992-2001)\n\nTaTeTi (Argentina) (2010-2017)\n\nTaTeTi (Chile) (2010-2017)\n\nTacho Pistacho (Colombia) (2017-2019)\n\nRede Globo (Brazil) (1980-2005)\n\nSBT (Brazil) (1994-2018)\n\nGloob (2014-2017)\n\nAustralia & New Zealand [edit | edit source]\n\nABC (1971-1984)\n\nNine Network (1984-1989; 2003-2010)\n\nSeven Network (1992-2001)\n\nNetwork Ten (2002-2005)\n\nTVNZ 2 (1997-2015)\n\nCartoon Network (1999-2004)\n\nBoomerang (2001-2017)\n\nSouthern Asia[edit | edit source]\n\nCartoon Network (1999-2005)\n\nBoomerang (2006-2013)\n\nPhilippines [edit | edit source]\n\nABS-CBN (1974-2008)\n\nIndia [edit | edit source]\n\nCartoon Network (1995-2010)\n\nSony Entertainment Television (1995-2004)\n\nPogo (2014-2018)\n\nDisney Channel (2010-2014)\n\nHungama TV (2009-2014)\n\nSony Yay!
