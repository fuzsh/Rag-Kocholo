        "text": "Carrigan Crittenden (Cathy Moriarty) is a spoiled-rotten heiress who learns that her father only left her only one thing in his will: Whipstaff Manor, the rundown home of Casper and his three ghost uncles.\n\nCarrigan doesn't seem too concerned with the fact that she lost her father. Instead, she is enraged by her father's last will and testament. In her anger, she rips the will from the hands of her father's lawyer Mr. Rugg (Ben Stein) and chucks it into the fireplace.\n\nAt first, Carrigan is disappointed in her inheritance, but then she and her assistant Dibs (Eric Idle) stumble across something interesting in the house's paperwork: a mysterious, whimsical bit of prose suggesting that treasure is hidden within the home.\n\nDetermined to get something of great monetary value out of her father's passing, Carrigan decides that it must be true. The conniving would-be heiress also convinces Dibs that it is true without even consulting any other local history books or previous homeowners.\n\nOne day, as Casper listlessly surfs TV channels, he stumbles upon an exposition-heavy news report on Dr. James Harvey (Bill Pullman), a man who claims to be able to communicate with ghosts. Dr. Harvey's profession might have piqued Casper's interest, but it's the doctor's daughter Kat (Christina Ricci), who is described as a \"loner\" in the news segment, that really catches Casper's eye.\n\nWithin half a second of seeing her on TV, Casper is certifiably twitterpated. The boy ghost doesn't even hear the girl say a word before he is all gooey-eyed for her. He continues to watch as news reporters hound the 12-year-old girl with followup questions regarding her father's profession and she begs for them to leave her alone. Apparently, her \"loner\" status doesn't seem to deter the prepubescent ghost.\n\nAfter seeing Kat and her father Dr. Harvey on a news segment, Casper hatches a plan to get the girl of his dreams into the house he haunts. He immediately thinks of Carrigan, who is trying to get Casper and his uncles to vacate the residence.\n\nCasper ghost-magics his way into telephone cables and travels straight to Carrigan's hotel TV set. Casper flips on the news station, which doesn't immediately catch Carrigan's attention, so he continues to possess the TV and follow her around the hotel room. Casper is so desperate to get in contact with Kat, a girl he has only seen on TV, that he subtly manipulates a woman into hiring Kat's dad.\n\nCasper doesn't have much going for him before Kat and James Harvey make their way to Whipstaff Manor. His uncles, known as the Ghostly Trio, treat Casper like trash. Even once the \"air-suckers\" arrive, Stretch (Joe Nipote), Stinkie (Joe Alaskey), and Fatso (Brad Garrett) continue to treat Casper like their own personal servant. Stretch yells at Casper for making Kat and Dr. Harvey breakfast before them, turning into a gigantic, red-eyed ghoul. He then chucks Casper into a cabinet.\n\nThe worst part? Casper shakes off his uncle's mistreatment with a sarcastic, \"Yeah, yeah,\" making it feel like this sort of familial conflict happens fairly regularly.\n\nEveryone goes through grief in different ways, but Dr. James Harvey's mourning process is an especially intense case. After his wife Amelia (Amy Brenneman) unexpectedly perishes, Harvey gives up his traditional therapist job and moves into parapsychology. The widower is in such denial that he can't even call spectral beings \"ghosts,\" instead referring to them as the \"living impaired.\"\n\nThe newscaster doesn't exactly paint him in a good light for this either. As she talks about Dr. Harvey's sudden shift from traditional therapy to parapsychology, she remarks that he is also shifting from \"traditional sanity.\" No one attempts to help this man, who is clearly still suffering after losing his wife. Instead, he is made into a spectacle - pretty rough for a children's movie."
