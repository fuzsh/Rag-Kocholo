        "text": "Casper is the friendliest ghost story I’ve ever heard. The Friendly Ghost has been haunting every facet of media since 1939. Casper has appeared in children’s books, theatrical cartoons, TV shows, and his own series of Harvey Comics. Though he didn’t originate from the comics, Casper was just as popular as Richie Rich. So it only made sense for them to make a Casper movie one year after Richie Rich in 1995. Though the idea came from Steven Spielberg who produced the movie. He’s mostly responsible for all the surprise celebrity cameos from Ben Stein, Mel Gibson, Clint Eastwood, Rodney Dangerfield, the Crypt Keeper, and even Dan Aykroyd as Ghostbuster Ray Stantz. I know it’s not the best adaptation, but Casper holds a special place in my heart since it was the most successful film the day I was born.\n\nI’ve seen it many times on VHS, though it doesn’t make a lot of sense to release such a spooky flick on May 26th. Since it predates Toy Story by a few months, Casper is technically the first movie with a CGI animated main character. Casper the Friendly Ghost figuratively comes to life with his classic cartoon design and semi-translucent white body. Malachi Pearson is the friendliest voice they could’ve gotten. The CGI holds up fairly well for all the ghosts they had to work with. Like the cartoons & comics, Casper is bullied by his uncles the Ghostly Trio. The movie forever renames the characters Stretch, Stinkie, and Fatso. Stretch is the harsh leader, Stinkie has bad breath, and Fatso is the fat one. The rest of the cast is mostly original. Cathy Moriarty and Eric Idle play a pair of forgettable bumbling bad guys trying to get Casper and the trio out of the haunted Whipstaff Manor. Christina Ricci and Bill Pullman’s characters are at least named after Harvey Comics.\n\nDr. James Harvey is called to remove the ghosts along with his daughter Kat. Although she was originally set to play Wendy (more on her later), Ricci makes the most out of her first equally gothic role after Wednesday Addams. Casper just wants to make friends and Kat gradually warms up to him. Meanwhile, the Ghostly Trio promise to reunite James with his deceased wife. Although Casper has always been a ghost, the movie gets surprisingly dark and edgy. Aside from a lot of out of place swearing, Casper’s death is explored in heartbreaking detail. Casper’s unrequited love for Kat is actually hauntingly beautiful. Of course the climax is unbelievable when Casper discovers his father was an inventor who created a machine that can bring him back to life. It doesn’t go as planned, but Casper gets his wish to be a real boy played by Devon Sawa at Kat’s Halloween party. Thanks to Kat’s angel mother who is strangely dressed in red. Casper isn’t always friendly, but I’ll gladly revisit his haunted tale."
