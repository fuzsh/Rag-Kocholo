        "text": "History\n\nIn 1976, Stuart R. Ross, an American media and entertainment entrepreneur who saw the Smurfs while traveling in Belgium, entered into an agreement with Editions Dupuis and Peyo, acquiring North American and other rights to the characters, whose original name was \"les Schtroumpfs\". Subsequently, Ross launched the Smurfs in the United States in association with a California company, Wallace Berrie and Co., whose figurines, dolls and other Smurf merchandise became a hugely popular success. NBC President Fred Silverman's daughter, Melissa, had a Smurf doll of her own that he had bought for her at a toy shop while they were visiting Aspen, Colorado. Silverman thought that a series based on the Smurfs might make a good addition to his Saturday-morning lineup.[3]\n\nThe Saturday morning cartoon The Smurfs, produced by Hanna-Barbera Productions in association with SEPP International S.A. (from 1981 to 1987) and Lafig S.A. (in the years 1988 and 1989), debuted on NBC in 1981. The series became a major success for the network[4] (one of the few hits to emerge from the Fred Silverman era) and one of the most successful and longest running Saturday morning cartoons in television history, spawning seven spin-off television specials on an almost yearly basis. The characters included Papa Smurf, Smurfette, Brainy Smurf, the evil Gargamel, his cat Azrael, and Johan and his friend Peewit. The Smurfs was nominated multiple times for Daytime Emmy Awards and won Outstanding Children's Entertainment Series in 1982â1983.[5]\n\nBy 1989, the show was in its ninth season and had reached the 200-episode threshold, an extreme rarity when most cartoons were gone after two seasons and 22 episodes (it also far exceeded the typical 65-episode run of a first-run syndicated show of the era). In an effort to come up with new ideas to keep the show fresh, NBC changed the format of the show, taking some of the Smurfs out of the forest and omitting the Smurf Village. These changes were adopted to a lost-in-time format similar to The Time Tunnel. The show continued through the end of the season, airing the last original episode 2 December 1989 on NBC.\n\nHome video\n\nRegion 1\n\nWarner Home Video (via Hanna-Barbera Productions and Warner Bros. Family Entertainment) released the complete first season on DVD in a two-volume set in 2008.[9][10] Despite high sales of both sets,[11] no further seasons have been released. Warner Home Video later released a series of three single-disc releases of The Smurfs in 2009, each containing five episodes from the second season.[12][13][14] A two-disc DVD was set to be released in 2011 to tie into the theatrical film with 10 episodes culled from the entire run of the series,[15] but included episodes from the second season instead. Another DVD with both Smurfs Christmas specials was released later that year.[16] It is unknown if Warner Archive will release the rest of the show's complete seasons (under the Hanna-Barbera Classics Collection banner or not) on MOD DVD.\n\nDVD title Season(s) Episode count Release date Description Season 1 Volume 1 1 13 26 February 2008 This two-disc release contained the first 19 season one episodes, uncut and digitally remastered, and presented in their original broadcast presentation and order.

Special features include the Meet The Smurfs feature, which shows Jokey, Brainy, and Greedy, plus an Easter egg: if the viewer clicks on the telescope, it shows something that is \"rated S for Smurfy\", presented as if it was a science-fiction movie. It starts out with Dreamy asking if there is life in \"outer smurf\", and shows Hefty saying, \"There is no life in outer smurf\", ending with the announcer saying \"It Came from Outer Smurf. Coming Soon.\" Also of note is that Greedy's image is actually Cook Smurf's image, which is what the cartoon version of Greedy is based on.
