Produced by Hanna-Barbera Productions, it is based on the Belgian comic series by the same name, created by Belgian cartoonist Peyo (who also served as story supervisor of this adaptation) and aired for 256 episodes with a total of 418 stories, excluding three cliffhanger episodes and seven specials.\n\nHistory\n\nIn 1976, Stuart R. Ross, an American media and entertainment entrepreneur who saw the Smurfs while traveling in Belgium, entered into an agreement with Editions Dupuis and Peyo, acquiring North American and other rights to the characters, whose original name was \"les Schtroumpfs\". Subsequently, Ross launched the Smurfs in the United States in association with a California company, Wallace Berrie and Co., whose figurines, dolls and other Smurf merchandise became a hugely popular success. NBC President Fred Silverman's daughter, Melissa, had a Smurf doll of her own that he had bought for her at a toy shop while they were visiting Aspen, Colorado. Silverman thought that a series based on the Smurfs might make a good addition to his Saturday-morning lineup.[3]\n\nThe Smurfs secured their place in American pop culture in 1981, when the Saturday morning cartoon The Smurfs, produced by Hanna-Barbera Productions in association with SEPP International S.A. (from 1981 to 1987) and Lafig S.A. (in the years 1988 and 1989), aired on NBC. The series became a major success for the network and one of the most successful and longest running Saturday morning cartoons in television history, spawning spin-off television specials on an almost yearly basis. The characters included Papa Smurf, Smurfette, Brainy Smurf, the evil Gargamel, his cat Azrael, and Johan and his friend Peewit. The Smurfs was nominated multiple times for Daytime Emmy Awards, and won Outstanding Children's Entertainment Series in 1982â1983.[4]\n\nIn 1989, NBC changed the format of the show, removing some of the Smurfs from the forest and omitted the Smurf village and adopted a lost in time format similar to The Time Tunnel, and then ultimately cancelled it due to decreasing ratings. In addition, NBC executives prepared a Today weekend program for Saturdays as well as programmings for teenagers such as Saved by the Bell, which came later on and led to the elimination of Saturday morning animated children's shows. The show continued through December 2, 1989 on the NBC network.\n\nCharacters\n\nEpisodes\n\nVoices\n\nProduction\n\nOutsourced production work was done by Wang Film Productions/Cuckoo's Nest Studios and, only for the Season 7, by Toei Animation.\n\nUse of classical music\n\nThe Smurfs was noted for its frequent use of classical music as background music or themes for particular events.

Warner Home Video later released a series of three single disc releases of The Smurfs in 2009, each containing 5 episodes from the second season.[11][12][13] A two-disc DVD was set to be released in 2011 to tie into the theatrical film with 10 episodes culled from the entire run of the series,[14] but included episodes from the second season instead. Another DVD with both Smurfs Christmas specials was released later that year.[15] It is unknown when Warner Archive will release the rest of the show's complete seasons (as part of the Hanna-Barbera Classics Collection series).\n\nDVD Name Ep # Release date Notes Season One, Volume One 19 February 26, 2008 Re-released on July 24, 2012 as part of Cartoon Network's 20th anniversary.
