It premiered on September 10, 1983, and ran for one season on ABC as a half-hour program made up of two eleven-minute short cartoons. In 1984, the name of the show was changed to The New Scooby-Doo Mysteries, with the actual show format remaining the same. However, for season 2, Fred and Velma returned to the show after a four year absence. The New Scooby-Doo Mysteries ran for another season on ABC.\n\nThirteen half-hour episodes, composed of twenty-four separate segments were produced under the New Scooby and Scrappy-Doo title in 1983, and thirteen more episodes, composed of twenty separate segments were produced under the name The New Scooby-Doo Mysteries in 1984. At the time, Margaret Loesch, who served as supervising executive for the series, also worked for another animation production company, Marvel Productions.\n\nOverview\n\nSeason one\n\nFor this incarnation of the show, Hanna-Barbera attempted to combine elements of both the current format and the newer Scooby-Doo and Scrappy-Doo format. Daphne Blake was added back to the cast after a three-year absence. The plots of each episode feature her, Shaggy Rogers, Scooby-Doo, and Scrappy-Doo solving supernatural mysteries under the cover of being reporters for a teen magazine. Each half-hour program was made up of two 11-minute episodes, which would upon occasion be two parts of one half-hour-long episode.\n\nSeason two\n\nThe second season of this format, broadcast as The New Scooby-Doo Mysteries in 1984, continued the same format, and included six two-part episodes featuring original Scooby-Doo characters Fred Jones and Velma Dinkley, both absent from the series for five years. Fred's last name is given as \"Rogers\" initially in his return appearance to the series in the episode \"Happy Birthday, Scooby-Doo,\" although later in the same episode it is corrected as \"Jones\"; Rogers had been established as Shaggy's surname the previous season. The New Scooby-Doo Mysteries theme song is performed in the style of Thriller-era Michael Jackson. The accompanying opening credits feature shots of a row of monsters dancing like the zombies in Jackson's \"Thriller\" music video.\n\nEpisodes\n\nSeason 1 (The New Scooby and Scrappy-Doo Show) (1983)\n\nNo. in\n\nseries No. in\n\nseason Title Villain Identity Original air date 1 1 \"Scooby The Barbarian\" \"No Sharking Zone\" The Viking Ghosts The Seaweed Monster and the Great White Shark Professor Buzby Cowabunga Carlyle and a submarine September 10, 1983 ( )\n\nScooby The Barbarian: The gang tries to solve a mystery involving the disappearance of an archaeologist, and the appearance of Viking ghosts.\n\nNo Sharking Zone: A surfing competition, on the island of Scareuba, is jeopardized by a Great White Shark and a Seaweed Monster, who are said to guard a lost treasure.\n\n2 2 \"Scoobygeist\" \"The Quagmire Quake Caper\" The Ghosts The Mud Monster Real Ghosts Quanto September 10, 1983 ( )\n\nScoobygeist: The gang spends the night at a mansion invaded by a host of ghosts.
