After that, he came back to Warner Bros who later fired him after working on Gay Purr-ee with them and UPA. He then formed Sib Tower 12 with Les Goldman and took over the Tom and Jerry franchise from Gene Deitch. That studio was eventually absorbed by Metro Goldwyn Mayer and was renamed MGM Animation/Visual Arts. That particular venture was deactivated after 1970. The Cat in the Hat was in the works at the time of the shutdown, but was completed by Friz Freleng.\n\nFIFTY HAPPY YEARS\n\nSPECIAL LOGO FOR 1973:\n\nWe fade in on a nighttime still photo of the Sleeping Beauty castle at Disneyland as superimposed fireworks shoot out into the night sky [1]. In front of the castle, a five slides from the left, and a zero with Mickey Mouse ears and a smiley face, slides from the right to form the number 50. \"HAPPY\" zooms out above the number and \"YEARS\" zooms out below. Tinkerbell flies around and waves her wand, changing the screen to black. The first two bars of \"When You Wish Upon a Star\" are heard, along with a voiceover from Dick Wesson saying \"And now, a fiftieth anniversary presentation from Walt Disney!\"\n\n1973 Release Schedule:\n\nWorld's Greatest Athlete (Valentine's Day)\n\nCharley and the Angel (March 23rd)\n\nOne Little Indian (June 20th)\n\nSuperdad (November 8th)[2]\n\nHerbie Rides Again (December 14th)[2]\n\n[1] Identical to the shot of the castle and fireworks in the opening credits of The Wonderful World of Disney from the late 1960's to the mid 70's IOTL.\n\n[2] Moved up from OTL.\n\nEarlier versions of Snow Queen and Rapunzel are on the way, which will (hopefully) butterfly Frozen and Tangled respectively. Stories and voice cast are still being ironed out. Stay tuned for further updates.\n\nMARVEL COMICS FOR SALE\n\nFrontrunner for purchase rumored to be Mickey Mouse creator\n\nNEW YORK - Cadence Industries, formerly known as Perfect Film and Chemical, announced yesterday it was putting the cash strapped Marvel Comics Group up for sale. Longtime publisher Martin Goodman wants out of the comic business, and editor Stan Lee, whose real name is Stanley M. Leiber, has been the target of a nationwide PR campaign calling on him to share creator credit with Jack Kirby, Steve Ditko, Joe Sinnott and other collaborators. Among the potential buyers, R.E. \"Ted\" Turner of Atlanta; MCA/Universal of Burbank; Transamerica of San Francisco, parent company of United Artists; Taft Broadcasting of Cincinnati, parent company of the Hanna-Barbera cartoon studio and Gulf+Western of New York, parent company of Paramount Pictures. The rumored frontrunner to buy the once-proud comic book studio is none other than the incomparable Walt Disney of Burbank. Currently, Disney has licensed his classic characters and film properties to Western Publishing imprint Gold Key, but a dispute over licensing fees has gone nuclear. Should Walt Disney acquire the once-proud Marvel, he will be locked in mortal combat with Warner-owned DC Comics should he proceed to go head to head with a rumored Superman film currently in pre-development. And at the same time, Mickey Mouse, Goofy, Donald Duck, Snow White and others should be right up the alley of Smilin' Stan Lee.\n\n(The New York Times, Arts and Leisure section; April 8, 1973)\n\nSo like in four colours for a dime, marvel still ends up with disney pretty early.\n\nHope they change their own internal system So Mr banks and don Rosa got the credits and royalties they deserved otl.\n\nOh yeah, I remember Four Colors. Marvel I believe was called Mighty and Stan Lee, if I recall correctly took over Archie in that one. Plus Disney bought NBC at some point.\n\nNow, I'm trying to figure out how to plausibly mix and match the different conglomerates, maybe give Disney more competition with maybe nine or more conglomerates rather than the six that we have IOTL.\n\nBarks..i though was a mental slip but otl as always is weird\n\nAbout more rivals to disney..a more sucessful ted turner without warner and universal revives their cartoons and cbs did the same?\n\nDo you think it'll be plausible for Barks and Rosa to get the same kind of pensions Seigel and Shuster got from Warners? I want to be able to say yes, but I'm not sure if that'll be ASB.\n\nNot sure who would be up to the task of reviving Walter Lantz's characters other than maybe Filmation or Murakami Wolf Swenson. Maybe Universal could make arrangements with Nelvana. Whichever way is plausible.\n\nI'm trying to find a way to get the Harvey characters (Casper, Baby Huey, Little Audrey, Herman and Katnip) into Turner's hands. Maybe if somehow AAP got a hold of the Noveltoons along with the Popeye catalog they bought from Paramount. Could be ASB though.\n\nI want to make Taft Entertainment a bigger player ITTL, that way HB doesn't get swallowed up by Warners by millennium's end, but they're gonna need strong leadership, something in short supply in Cincinnati.\n\nThe fates of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, 20th Century Fox, Columbia Pictures and United Artists are all up in the air at this point."
