        "text": "Magnetostrictive and mechanical properties of Terfenol-D composites based on polymer\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nRodrÃ­guez, C.; Cuevas, J. M.; Orue, I.; Vilas, J. L.; BarandiarÃ¡n, J. M.; Fernandez-Gubieda, M. L.; Leon, L. M.\n\n2007-07-01\n\nSeveral composites, with outstanding magnetostrictive properties, have been synthesized combining a polyurethane base elastomer, with polycrystalline powders of Terfenol-D with a preferential orientation obtained by curing the material in a magnetic field. The morphology of the polymer matrix can be modified by changing the ratio of the hard /soft segment (F) of the polyurethane from 0.6 to 1.5. The influence of the morphology in the magnetostrictive response, for different composites, has been studied by following the storage modulus, E', in DMTA analysis. The magnetostrictive response has been studied as a function of Terfenol-D particle size and distribution (0-300, 212-300, 106-212, 0-38 Î¼m), as well as a function of the content of the magnetostrictive particles in the composite. The highest response (about 1390 ppm) was obtained for a F=1.5 polyurethane and 50% wt of Terfenol-D of 212-300 Î¼m particle size, oriented with a magnetic field of 0.5 T.\n\nMagnetostrictive properties of titanate coupling agent treated Terfenol-D composites\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nDong Xufeng, E-mail: dongxf@dlut.edu.cn [School of Materials Science and Engineering, Dalian University of Technology, 116024 Dalian (China); Qi Min [School of Materials Science and Engineering, Dalian University of Technology, 116024 Dalian (China); Guan Xinchun [School of Civil Engineering, Harbin Institute of Technology, 150090 Harbin (China); Li Jinhai [School of Civil Engineering, Dalian University of Technology, 116024 Dalian (China); Ou Jinping [School of Civil Engineering, Harbin Institute of Technology, 150090 Harbin (China); School of Civil Engineering, Dalian University of Technology, 116024 Dalian (China)\n\n2012-03-15\n\nAs a kind of composites, the bond strength between the polymer matrix and the Terfenol-D particles affects the performance of magnetostrictive composites. By observing the fracture morphologies, the bond strength of the magnetostrictive composites prepared with untreated Terfenol-D was proved weak. Titanate coupling agent was used for particles to improve the bond strength. Contact angle analysis indicates the work of adhesion of the epoxy resin to the treated Terfenol-D is larger than that to the untreated Terfenol-D. Different magnetostrictive composites with 20%, 35% and 50% particle volume fractions were prepared with treated and untreated Terfenol-D particles. Their static and dynamic magnetostriction was tested without pre-stress at room temperature. The results indicate titanate coupling agent treating increases the magnetostrictive properties of magnetostrictive composites, that is probably because the bond strength improves due to the particle treating. - Highlights: Black-Right-Pointing-Pointer Our experimental results indicate the particles and the polymer matrix have poor bonding. Black-Right-Pointing-Pointer The poor bonding prevents the effective transfer of the strain from the particles to the matrix. Black-Right-Pointing-Pointer We used titanate as the coupling agent to improve the bond strength between the particles and the matrix. Black-Right-Pointing-Pointer The results indicate the bond strength does increase as expected. Black-Right-Pointing-Pointer The promotion of the bond strength leads to the increase of magnetostrictive properties.\n\nDetermination of Terfenol-D magnetostriction characteristics for sensor application using fiber Bragg grating\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nde Morais Sousa, Kleiton; Zandonay, Ricardo; Vagner da Silva, Erlon; Martelli, Cicero; Cardozo da Silva, Jean Carlos\n\n2014-08-01\n\nElectric current sensor based on magnetostriction phenomenon has been reported in several papers. In common these previous papers used a fiber Bragg grating (FBG) to determine the strain of the magnetostrictive material. However, magnetostriction sensors present few disadvantages often neglected, such as the temperature dependence of magnetostriction. In this paper a Terfenol-D rod (a giant magnetostrictive material-GMM) is used for tests. For simultaneous measurement of temperature and strain two multiplexed FBGs are used. The first test presents unipolar characteristics of Terfenol-D magnetostriction. Other test determines the Terfenol-D response for different temperatures. The Terfenol-D sensitivity increase when the temperature increases, however the saturation of the material occurs in small field values. The characteristics presented in this paper must be taken into account in the development of magnetostrictive sensors and its limitations.\n\nStudy on classical and excess eddy currents losses of Terfenol-D\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nTalebian, Soheil; Hojjat, Yousef [Department of Mechanical Engineering, Tarbiat Modares University, Tehran (Iran, Islamic Republic of); Ghodsi, Mojtaba [Department of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering, Sultan Qaboos University, Muscat (Oman); Karafi, Mohammad Reza [Department of Mechanical Engineering, Tarbiat Modares University, Tehran (Iran, Islamic Republic of)\n\n2015-08-15\n\nIn the present paper, classical and excess eddy currents losses of Terfenol-D are studied and effects of magnetic field frequency, peak of magnetic flux density and diameter of Terfenol-D on the eddy currents losses are investigated. To provide reliable data for the purpose of the paper, an experimental laboratory is fabricated and used to obtain major and minor hysteresis loops of Terfenol-D at different frequencies. In theoretical study, initially an analytical model based on uniform distribution of magnetic flux is developed which yields to calculation of classical eddy currents losses. Then, another eddy currents model based on non-uniform distribution of magnetic flux and nonlinear diffusion of electromagnetic fields is presented. The difference between output values of the two models is identified as excess eddy currents losses. Obtained results show that the values of excess losses are generally larger than classical losses and applying just classical model leads to wrong calculation of actual value of eddy currents losses. For the results obtained from two above models, empirical models with respect to the magnetic field frequency and the peak value of magnetic flux density are achieved which can predict the eddy currents losses precisely. To validate the empirical relations, experiments are repeated at a new frequency and values of power losses calculated from analytical equations are compared with the predicted values of the empirical models. The results point towards possibility to use the obtained empirical relations in order to calculate the classical and excess eddy currents losses of Terfenol-D at the frequencies below 200 Hz and different values of magnetic flux density. - Highlights: â¢ Classical eddy currents loss of Terfenol-D is studied using Maxwell's laws. â¢ Excess eddy currents loss of Terfenol-D is studied using Mayergoyz nonlinear model. â¢ Effects of Terfenol-D geometry on the eddy currents losses are investigated. â¢ Power\n\nA combined PreisachâHyperbolic Tangent model for magnetic hysteresis of Terfenol-D\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nTalebian, Soheil [Department of Mechanical Engineering, Tarbiat Modares University, Tehran (Iran, Islamic Republic of); Hojjat, Yousef, E-mail: yhojjat@modares.ac.ir [Department of Mechanical Engineering, Tarbiat Modares University, Tehran (Iran, Islamic Republic of); Ghodsi, Mojtaba [Department of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering, Sultan Qaboos University, Muscat (Oman); Karafi, Mohammad Reza [Department of Mechanical Engineering, Tarbiat Modares University, Tehran (Iran, Islamic Republic of); Mirzamohammadi, Shahed [Department of Mechanical Engineering, Shahid Rajaee University, Tehran (Iran, Islamic Republic of)\n\n2015-12-15\n\nThis study presents a new model using the combination of Preisach and Hyperbolic Tangent models, to predict the magnetic hysteresis of Terfenol-D at different frequencies. Initially, a proper experimental setup was fabricated and used to obtain different magnetic hysteresis curves of Terfenol-D; such as major, minor and reversal loops. Then, it was shown that the Hyperbolic Tangent model is precisely capable of modeling the magnetic hysteresis of the Terfenol-D for both rate-independent and rate-dependent cases. Empirical equations were proposed with respect to magnetic field frequency which can calculate the non-dimensional coefficients needed by the model. These empirical equations were validated at new frequencies of 100 Hz and 300 Hz. Finally, the new model was developed through the combination of Preisach and Hyperbolic Tangent models. In the combined model, analytical relations of the Hyperbolic Tangent model for the first order reversal loops determined the weighting function of the Preisach model. This model reduces the required experiments and errors due to numerical differentiations generally needed for characterization of the Preisach function. In addition, it can predict the rate-dependent hysteresis as well as rate-independent hysteresis. - Highlights: â¢ Different hysteresis curves of Terfenol-D are experimentally obtained at 0â200 Hz. â¢ A new model is presented using combination of Preisach and Hyperbolic Tangent models. â¢ The model predicts both rate-independent and rate-dependent hystereses of Terfenol-D. â¢ The analytical model reduces the numerical errors and number of required experiments.\n\nThe piezo-magnetic parameters of Terfenol-D: An experimental viewpoint\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nDavino, D.; Giustiniani, A.; Visone, C.\n\n2012-01-01\n\nMagnetostrictive and all multifunctional materials have experienced in the last decades a growing technological interest. Several contributions, in the literature, propose the above-mentioned materials in innovative sensors and actuators both for bulk and MEMS devices. More recently, magnetostrictive materials have been proposed for energy harvesting applications by exploiting the so-called Villari effect. In this case, the behavior and the amplitude of the piezo-magnetic coefficients are an important element to evaluate the conversion efficiency. Aim of this paper is to study the experimental behavior of the piezo-magnetic coefficients of a commercial Terfenol-D rod under controlled conditions.\n\nMagnetoelastic properties of terfenol composites (abstract)\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nDennis, K.W.; Govindaraju, M.R.; Jiles, D.C.; Linde, M.; McCallum, R.W.\n\n1997-01-01\n\nRecent work was undertaken to identify the possibility of using composite Terfenol, consisting of Tb Dy Fe in a nonmagnetic, nonmetallic binder, for magnetoelastic sensor applications in which the material needs to be formed into complex shapes, and in which the high levels of magnetostriction obtained in Tb Dy endash Fe alone are unnecessary. Recent results reported by Sandlund et al. have indicated the possible use of such a material in high frequency applications. In this work we have studied the material for low frequency, or even dc applications, in which the material could be used to sense an applied torque. The results showed that these composite materials need magnetic fields of typically 800 kA/m to obtain the magnetostriction levels of 350 ppm reported elsewhere. Similar work by Peters needed fields of over 1 MA/m to obtain magnetostrictive strains beyond 100 ppm. Such field strengths are impractical for low power devices. From the present work, 38 Î¼m Terfenol powder in an epoxy or polymer binder gave magnetostrictive strains of 120 ppm and above for field strengths of 100 kA/m, which is much more appropriate for small low power sensors. A benchmark sensitivity of 18 Î¼ T/Nm for measurement of torque levels over the range Â± 10 Nm was set based on the response of nickel which has previously been used in magnetoelastic sensors. In the present composite material axial magnetic induction sensitivities of 32 Î¼ T/Nm and tangential field sensitivities of 12 A/Nm (=15 Î¼T/Nm) were obtained, which were 50% better than nickel. copyright 1997 American Institute of Physics\n\nThe resonance frequency shift characteristic of Terfenol-D rods for magnetostrictive actuators\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nJin, Ke; Kou, Yong; Zheng, Xiaojing\n\n2012-01-01\n\nThis paper focuses on the resonance frequency shift characteristic of Terfenol-D rods for magnetostrictive actuators. A 3D nonlinear dynamic model to describe the magneto-thermo-elastic coupling behavior of actuators is proposed based on a nonlinear constitutive model. The coupled interactions among stress- and magnetic-field-dependent variables for actuators are solved iteratively using the finite element method. The model simulations show a good correlation with the experimental data, which demonstrates that this model can capture the coupled resonance frequency shift features for magnetostrictive actuators well. Moreover, a comprehensive description for temperature, pre-stress and bias field dependences of resonance frequency is discussed in detail. These essential and important investigations will be of significant benefit to both theoretical research and the applications of magnetostrictive materials in smart or intelligent structures and systems.

Recently, an approach based on simulating 1-D magnetostriction using 2-D anisotropic Preisach-type models has been introduced. The purpose of this paper is to present a detailed formulation and quantitative assessment for the simulation of field effects on the mechanical hysteresis of Terfenol rods and magnetic shape memory materials using this recently proposed model. Details of the model formulation, identification procedure and experimental testing are given in the paper\n\nAmorphous Terfenol-D films using nanosecond pulsed laser deposition\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nMa, James; O'Brien, Daniel T.; Kovar, Desiderio\n\n2009-01-01\n\nThin films of Terfenol-D were produced by nanosecond pulsed laser deposition (PLD) at two fluences. Electron dispersive spectroscopy conducted using scanning electron and transmission electron microscopes showed that the film compositions were similar to that of the PLD target. Contrary to previous assertions that suggested that nanosecond PLD results in crystalline films, X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy analysis showed that the films produced at both fluences were amorphous. Splatters present on the film had similar compositions to the overall film and were also amorphous. Magnetic measurements showed that the films had high saturation magnetization and magnetostriction, similar to high quality films produced using other physical vapor deposition methods.\n\nMagnetization and magnetostriction in highly magnetostrictive materials\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nThoelke, Jennifer Beth [Iowa State Univ., Ames, IA (United States)\n\n1993-05-26\n\nThe majority of this research has been in developing a model to describe the magnetostrictive properties of Terfenol-D, Tbsub>1-xDyxFey (x = 0.7-0.75 and y = 1.8--2.0), a rare earth-iron alloy which displays much promise for use in device applications.

High low-frequency magnetoelectric coefficients of 0.10-0.75 V cm{sup -1} Oe{sup -1} were attained for the disk-ring heterostructures, which indicated the strong magnetoelectric coupling. Moreover, a symmetrical resonant peak was observed for dE{sub 3}/dH{sub 3} in the frequency range of 1-200 kHz, while another weak peak with asymmetrical shape also existed at a lower frequency for dE{sub 3}/dH{sub 1}, which was due to the combination of two vibration modes.

Specifically, the piezoelectric coefficients, performance of single NW-based NG and structure-dependent electromechanical properties of 1D nanostructured materials can be respectively investigated through piezoresponse force microscopy, atomic force microscopy and the in-situ scanning/transmission electron microcopy. Along with the introduction of the mechanism and piezoelectric properties of 1D semiconductor, perovskite materials and polymers, their performance improvement strategies are summarized from the view of microstructures, including size-effect, crystal structure, orientation and defects. Finally, the extension of 1D piezoelectric materials in field effect transistors and optoelectronic devices are simply introduced.\n\nMagnetoelectric properties of magnetic/ferroelectric multilayer thin films\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nHwang, Sung-Ok; Eum, You-Jeong; Koo, Chang-Young; Lee, Hee-Young [Yeungnam University, Gyeongsan (Korea, Republic of); Park, Jung-Min [Osaka University, Osaka (Japan); Ryu, Jung-Ho [Korea Institute of Materials Science, Changwon (Korea, Republic of)\n\n2014-07-15\n\nMagnetic/ferroelectric multilayer thin films using PbZr{sub 0.52}Ti{sub 0.48}O{sub 3} (PZT) and two different magnetic materials, i.e., Terfenol-D and CuFe{sub 2}O{sub 4} (CuFO) layers, were fabricated, and their magnetoelectric (ME) coupling behavior was investigated. The PZT layer was first coated onto Pt/Ti/SiO{sub 2}/Si substrate by sol-gel spin coating method. Pt layer, which served as an electrode and a diffusion barrier, was grown on the PZT layer by using the ion-beam sputtering method. The ME voltage coefficients were calculated from the ME voltage data measured utilizing a magnetoelectric test system. The Terfenol-D/Pt/PZT films were found to show a higher in-plane ME voltage coefficient than that the CuFO/Pt/PZT films due primarily to the higher magnetostriction coefficient of Terfenol-D.\n\nComputational methods for 2D materials: discovery, property characterization, and application design.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nPaul, J T; Singh, A K; Dong, Z; Zhuang, H; Revard, B C; Rijal, B; Ashton, M; Linscheid, A; Blonsky, M; Gluhovic, D; Guo, J; Hennig, R G\n\n2017-11-29\n\nThe discovery of two-dimensional (2D) materials comes at a time when computational methods are mature and can predict novel 2D materials, characterize their properties, and guide the design of 2D materials for applications. This article reviews the recent progress in computational approaches for 2D materials research. We discuss the computational techniques and provide an overview of the ongoing research in the field. We begin with an overview of known 2D materials, common computational methods, and available cyber infrastructures. We then move onto the discovery of novel 2D materials, discussing the stability criteria for 2D materials, computational methods for structure prediction, and interactions of monolayers with electrochemical and gaseous environments. Next, we describe the computational characterization of the 2D materials' electronic, optical, magnetic, and superconducting properties and the response of the properties under applied mechanical strain and electrical fields. From there, we move on to discuss the structure and properties of defects in 2D materials, and describe methods for 2D materials device simulations. We conclude by providing an outlook on the needs and challenges for future developments in the field of computational research for 2D materials.\n\nSynthesis, properties and applications of 2D non-graphene materials\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nWang, Feng; Wang, Zhenxing; Wang, Qisheng; Wang, Fengmei; Yin, Lei; Xu, Kai; Huang, Yun; He, Jun\n\n2015-01-01\n\nAs an emerging class of new materials, two-dimensional (2D) non-graphene materials, including layered and non-layered, and their heterostructures are currently attracting increasing interest due to their promising applications in electronics, optoelectronics and clean energy. In contrast to traditional semiconductors, such as Si, Ge and IIIâV group materials, 2D materials show significant merits of ultrathin thickness, very high surface-to-volume ratio, and high compatibility with flexible devices. Owing to these unique properties, while scaling down to ultrathin thickness, devices based on these materials as well as artificially synthetic heterostructures exhibit novel and surprising functions and performances. In this review, we aim to provide a summary on the state-of-the-art research activities on 2D non-graphene materials. The scope of the review will cover the preparation of layered and non-layered 2D materials, construction of 2D vertical van der Waals and lateral ultrathin heterostructures, and especially focus on the applications in electronics, optoelectronics and clean energy. Moreover, the review is concluded with some perspectives on the future developments in this field.

While IPN elasticity and toughness properties have been explored in previous studies, the factors that impact the time-dependent stress relaxation behavior of IPN materials are not well understood. Time-dependent (i.e. viscoelastic) mechanical behavior is a critical design parameter in the development of materials for a variety of applications, such as medical simulation devices, flexible substrate materials, cellular mechanobiology substrates, or regenerative medicine applications. This study reports a novel technique for 3D printing alginate-polyacrylamide IPN gels with tunable elastic and viscoelastic properties. The viscoelastic stress relaxation behavior of the 3D printed alginate-polyacrylamide IPN hydrogels was influenced most strongly by varying the concentration of the acrylamide cross-linker (MBAA), while the elastic modulus was affected most by varying the concentration of total monomer material. The material properties of our 3D printed IPN constructs were consistent with those reported in the biomechanics literature for soft tissues such as skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle, skin and subcutaneous tissue.

N.; Pierce, Thomas D.; Zunkel, Gary\n\n1997-05-01\n\nFor many current applications, hydraulic power is still the preferred method of gaining mechanical advantage. However, in many of these applications, this power comes with the penalties of high weight, size, cost, and maintenance due to the system's distributed nature and redundancy requirements. A high authority smart material Integrated Electric Actuator (IEA) is a modular, self-contained linear motion device that is capable of producing dynamic output strokes similar to those of hydraulic actuators yet at significantly reduced weight and volume. It provides system simplification and miniaturization. This actuator concept has many innovative features, including a TERFENOL-D-based pump, TERFENOL-D- based active valves, control algorithms, a displacement amplification unit and integrated, unitized packaging. The IEA needs only electrical power and a control command signal as inputs to provide high authority, high response rate actuation. This approach is directly compatible with distributed control strategies. Aircraft control, automotive brakes and fuel injection, and fluid power delivery are just some examples of the IEA's pervasive applications in aerospace, defense and commercial systems.\n\nDielectric properties of 3D-printed materials for anatomy specific 3D-printed MRI coils\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nBehzadnezhad, Bahareh; Collick, Bruce D.; Behdad, Nader; McMillan, Alan B.\n\n2018-04-01\n\nAdditive manufacturing provides a low-cost and rapid means to translate 3D designs into the construction of a prototype. For MRI, this type of manufacturing can be used to construct various components including the structure of RF coils. In this paper, we characterize the material properties (dielectric constant and loss tangent) of several common 3D-printed polymers in the MRI frequency range of 63-300 MHz (for MRI magnetic field strengths of 1.5-7 T), and utilize these material properties in full-wave electromagnetic simulations to design and construct a very low-cost subject/anatomy-specific 3D-printed receive-only RF coil that fits close to the body. We show that the anatomy-specific coil exhibits higher signal-to-noise ratio compared to a conventional flat surface coil.\n\nEnhanced magnetoelectric effects in composite of piezoelectric ceramics, rare-earth iron alloys, and shape-optimized nanocrystalline alloys.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nZhang, Jitao; Li, Ping; Wen, Yumei; He, Wei; Yang, Aichao; Lu, Caijiang\n\n2014-03-01\n\nAn enhancement for magnetoelectric (ME) effects is studied in a three-phase ME architecture consisting of two magnetostrictive Terfenol-D (Tb(0.3)Dy(0.7)Fe(1.92)) plates, a piezoelectric PZT (Pb(Zr,Ti)O3) plate, and a pair of shape-optimized FeCuNbSiB nanocrystalline alloys. By modifying the conventional shape of the magnetic flux concentrator, the shape-optimized flux concentrator has an improved effective permeability (Î¼(eff)) due to the shape-induced demagnetizing effect at its end surface. The flux concentrator concentrates and amplifies the external magnetic flux into Terfenol-D plate by means of changing its internal flux concentrating manner. Consequently, more flux lines can be uniformly concentrated into Terfenol-D plates. The effective piezomagnetic coefficients (d(33m)) of Terfenol-D plate and the ME voltage coefficients (Î±(ME)) can be further improved under a lower magnetic bias field. The dynamic magneto-elastic properties and the effective magnetic induction of Terfenol-D are taken into account to derive the enhanced effective ME voltage coefficients (Î±(ME,eff)), the consistency of experimental results and theoretical analyses verifies this enhancement. The experimental results demonstrate that the maximum d(33m) in our proposed architecture achieves 22.48ânm/A under a bias of 114 Oe. The maximum Î±(ME) in the bias magnetic range 0-900 Oe reaches 84.73 mV/Oe under the low frequency of 1 kHz, and 2.996 V/Oe under the resonance frequency of 102.3 kHz, respectively. It exhibits a 1.43 times larger piezomagnetic coefficient and a 1.87 times higher ME voltage coefficient under a smaller magnetic bias of 82 Oe than those of a conventional Terfenol-D/PZT/Terfenol-D composite. These shape-induced magnetoelectric behaviors provide the possibility of using this ME architecture in ultra-sensitive magnetic sensors.\n\n3D printing of optical materials: an investigation of the microscopic properties\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nPersano, Luana; Cardarelli, Francesco; Arinstein, Arkadii; Uttiya, Sureeporn; Zussman, Eyal; Pisignano, Dario; Camposeo, Andrea\n\n2018-02-01\n\n3D printing technologies are currently enabling the fabrication of objects with complex architectures and tailored properties. In such framework, the production of 3D optical structures, which are typically based on optical transparent matrices, optionally doped with active molecular compounds and nanoparticles, is still limited by the poor uniformity of the printed structures. Both bulk inhomogeneities and surface roughness of the printed structures can negatively affect the propagation of light in 3D printed optical components. Here we investigate photopolymerization-based printing processes by laser confocal microscopy. The experimental method we developed allows the printing process to be investigated in-situ, with microscale spatial resolution, and in real-time. The modelling of the photo-polymerization kinetics allows the different polymerization regimes to be investigated and the influence of process variables to be rationalized. In addition, the origin of the factors limiting light propagation in printed materials are rationalized, with the aim of envisaging effective experimental strategies to improve optical properties of printed materials.\n\nHigh sensitivity zero-biased magnetic field sensor based on multiphase laminate heterostructures with FeCuNbSiB nanocrystalline soft magnetic alloy\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nQiu, Jing; Wen, Yumei; Li, Ping; Chen, Hengjia\n\n2016-05-01\n\nIn this paper, a high sensitivity zero-biased magnetic field sensor based on multiphase laminate heterostructures consisting of FeCuNbSiB/Terfenol-D (Tb1-xDyxFe2)/PZT (Pb(Zr1-x,Tix)O3)/Terfenol-D/PZT/Ternol-D/FeCuNbSiB (FMPMPMF) is presented, whose ME coupling characteristics and sensing performances have been investigated. Compared to traditional Terfenol-D/PZT/Terfenol-D (MPM) and Terfenol-D/PZT/Terfenol-D/PZT/Terfenol-D (MPMPM) sensors, the zero-biased ME coupling characteristics of FMPMPMF sensor were significantly improved, owing to a build-in magnetic field in FeCuNbSiB/Terfenol-D layers. The optimum zero-biased resonant ME voltage coefficient of 3.02 V/Oe is achieved, which is 1.65 times as great as that of MPMPM and 2.51 times of MPM sensors. The mean value of low-frequency ME field coefficient of FMPMPMF reaches 122.53 mV/cm Oe, which is 2.39 times as great as that of MPMPM and 1.79 times of MPM sensors. Meanwhile, the induced zero-biased ME voltage of FMPMPMF sensor shows an excellent linear relationship to ac magnetic field both at the low frequency (1 kHz) and the resonant frequency (106.6 kHz). Remarkably, it indicates that the proposed zero-biased magnetic field sensor give the prospect of being able to applied to the field of highly sensitive ac magnetic field sensing.\n\n2D materials: Graphene and others\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nBansal, Suneev Anil, E-mail: suneev@gmail.com; Singh, Amrinder Pal [Deptt. of Mech Engg, UIET, Panjab University, Chandigarh (India); Kumar, Suresh [Deptt. of Applied Sciences, UIET, Panjab University, Chandigarh (India)\n\n2016-05-06\n\nPresent report reviews the recent advancements in new atomically thick 2D materials.

These materials consist of atomically thin sheets exhibiting covalent in-plane bonding and weak interlayer and layer-substrate bonding. Following the example of graphene, most emerging 2D materials are derived from structures that can be isolated from bulk phases of layered materials, which form a limited library for new materials discovery. Entirely synthetic 2D materials provide access to a greater range of properties through the choice of constituent elements and substrates. Of particular interest are elemental 2D materials, because they provide the most chemically tractable case for synthetic exploration. In this Review, we explore the progress made in the synthesis and chemistry of synthetic elemental 2D materials, and offer perspectives and challenges for the future of this emerging field.\n\nMagnetic properties measurement of soft magnetic composite material (SOMALOY 700) by using 3-D tester\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nAsari, Ashraf; Guo, Youguang; Zhu, Jianguo\n\n2017-08-01\n\nCore losses of rotating electrical machine can be predicted by identifying the magnetic properties of the magnetic material. The magnetic properties should be properly measured since there are some variations of vector flux density in the rotating machine. In this paper, the SOMALOY 700 material has been measured under x, y and z- axes flux density penetration by using the 3-D tester. The calibrated sensing coils are used in detecting the flux densities which have been generated by the Labview software. The measured sensing voltages are used in obtaining the magnetic properties of the sample such as magnetic flux density B, magnetic field strength H, hysteresis loop which can be used to calculate the total core loss of the sample. The results of the measurement are analyzed by using the Mathcad software before being compared to another material.\n\nWearable energy sources based on 2D materials.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nYi, Fang; Ren, Huaying; Shan, Jingyuan; Sun, Xiao; Wei, Di; Liu, Zhongfan\n\n2018-05-08\n\nWearable energy sources are in urgent demand due to the rapid development of wearable electronics.

Considering that the strains of the magnetostrictive and piezoelectric layers are not equal in actual operating due to the epoxy resin adhesive bonding condition, the magnetostrictive and piezoelectric layers were first modeled through the equation of motion separately, and then coupled together with a new interface coupling factor k c , which physically reflects the strain transfer between the phases. Furthermore, a theoretical expression containing k c for the transverse ME voltage coefficient Î± v and the optimum thickness ratio n optim to which the maximum ME voltage coefficient corresponds were derived from the modified equivalent circuit of ME laminate, where the interface coupling factor acted as an ideal transformer. To explore the influence of mechanical load on the interface coupling factor k c , two sets of weights, i.e., 100 g and 500 g, were placed on the top of the ME laminates with the same thickness ratio n in the sample fabrication. A total of 22 T-T mode disk-type ME laminate samples with different configurations were fabricated. The interface coupling factors determined from the measured Î± v and the DC bias magnetic field H bias were 0.11 for 500 g pre-mechanical load and 0.08 for 100 g pre-mechanical load. Furthermore, the measured optimum thickness ratios were 0.61 for k c = 0.11 and 0.56 for k c = 0.08. Both the theoretical ME voltage coefficient Î± v and optimum thickness ratio n optim containing k c agreed well with the measured data, verifying the reasonability and correctness for the introduction of k c in the modified equivalent circuit model.\n\nEquivalent Circuit Model of Low-Frequency Magnetoelectric Effect in Disk-Type Terfenol-D/PZT Laminate Composites Considering a New Interface Coupling Factor\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nGuofeng Lou\n\n2017-06-01\n\nFull Text Available This paper describes the modeling of magnetoelectric (ME effects for disk-type Terfenol-D (Tb0.3Dy0.7Fe1.92/PZT (Pb(Zr,TiO3 laminate composite at low frequency by combining the advantages of the static elastic model and the equivalent circuit model, aiming at providing a guidance for the design and fabrication of the sensors based on magnetoelectric laminate composite.

The information provided includes in-depth discussions of TL mechanisms, including an account of luminescence properties, and relevant information regarding dosimetric characteristics. The book is intended for those involved in TLD materials research, and for technicians and workers involved in the practical application of these materials in TL dosimetry. The advent of modern spectroscopic methods for measuring TL emission spectra (the so-called ''3-D'' presentation) seemed to the authors to be an invitation to compile such spectra for all the major TLD materials. Further consideration led to an expansion of the initial idea to include a compilation of dosimetric properties. One intention is to provide a synopsis of the TL and dosimetric properties of the most widely used TLD materials currently available and to form a link between the solid state defect properties of these materials and their actual dosimetric properties. A second intention is to provide a solid framework from which future studies of TLD materials could be launched. Too often in the past research into TLD materials has been haphazard, to say the least. By illustrating the links between solid state physics and the radiation dosimetry properties of these materials the book points to the future and to the pressing need for enhanced research on TLD materials.

After considerable research effort, a distinct âbeyond grapheneâ domain has been established, comprising the library of non-graphene 2D materials. It is significant that some 2D non-graphene materials possess solid advantages over their predecessor, such as having a direct band gap, and therefore are highly promising for a number of applications. These applications are not limited to nano- and opto-electronics, but have a strong potential in biosensing technologies, as one example. However, since most of the 2D non-graphene materials have been newly discovered, most of the research efforts are concentrated on material synthesis and the investigation of the properties of the material. Applications of 2D non-graphene materials are still at the embryonic stage, and the integration of 2D non-graphene materials into devices is scarcely reported. However, in recent years, numerous reports have blossomed about 2D material-based biosensors, evidencing the growing potential of 2D non-graphene materials for biosensing applications. This review highlights the recent progress in research on the potential of using 2D non-graphene materials and similar oxide nanostructures for different types of biosensors (optical and electrochemical. A wide range of biological targets, such as glucose, dopamine, cortisol, DNA, IgG, bisphenol, ascorbic acid, cytochrome and estradiol, has been reported to be successfully detected by biosensors with transducers made of 2D non-graphene materials.\n\nTuning Material Properties of Oxides and Nitrides by Substrate Biasing during Plasma-Enhanced Atomic Layer Deposition on Planar and 3D Substrate Topographies.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nFaraz, Tahsin; Knoops, Harm C M; Verheijen, Marcel A; van Helvoirt, Cristian A A; Karwal, Saurabh; Sharma, Akhil; Beladiya, Vivek; Szeghalmi, Adriana; Hausmann, Dennis M; Henri, Jon; Creatore, Mariadriana; Kessels, Wilhelmus M M\n\n2018-04-18\n\nOxide and nitride thin-films of Ti, Hf, and Si serve numerous applications owing to the diverse range of their material properties. It is therefore imperative to have proper control over these properties during materials processing. Ion-surface interactions during plasma processing techniques can influence the properties of a growing film. In this work, we investigated the effects of controlling ion characteristics (energy, dose) on the properties of the aforementioned materials during plasma-enhanced atomic layer deposition (PEALD) on planar and 3D substrate topographies. We used a 200 mm remote PEALD system equipped with substrate biasing to control the energy and dose of ions by varying the magnitude and duration of the applied bias, respectively, during plasma exposure. Implementing substrate biasing in these forms enhanced PEALD process capability by providing two additional parameters for tuning a wide range of material properties. Below the regimes of ion-induced degradation, enhancing ion energies with substrate biasing during PEALD increased the refractive index and mass density of TiO x and HfO x and enabled control over their crystalline properties. PEALD of these oxides with substrate biasing at 150 Â°C led to the formation of crystalline material at the low temperature, which would otherwise yield amorphous films for deposition without biasing. Enhanced ion energies drastically reduced the resistivity of conductive TiN x and HfN x films. Furthermore, biasing during PEALD enabled the residual stress of these materials to be altered from tensile to compressive. The properties of SiO x were slightly improved whereas those of SiN x were degraded as a function of substrate biasing. PEALD on 3D trench nanostructures with biasing induced differing film properties at different regions of the 3D substrate. On the basis of the results presented herein, prospects afforded by the implementation of this technique during PEALD, such as enabling new routes for\n\nVacuum compatibility of 3D-printed materials\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nPovilus, AP; Wurden, CJ; Vendeiro, Z; Baquero-Ruiz, M; Fajans, J\n\n2014-01-01\n\nThe fabrication fidelity and vacuum properties are tested for currently available 3D-printed materials including polyamide, glass, acrylic, and sterling silver.

New materials and printing technologies, which enable rapid and multimaterial printing, have given rise to new applications and utilizations. However, the main bottleneck for achieving many more applications is the lack of materials with new physical properties. Here, some of the recent reports on novel materials in this field, such as ceramics, glass, shape-memory polymers, and electronics, are reviewed. Although new materials have been reported for all three main printing approaches-fused deposition modeling, binder jetting or laser sintering/melting, and photopolymerization-based approaches, apparently, most of the novel physicochemical properties are associated with materials printed by photopolymerization approaches. Furthermore, the high resolution that can be achieved using this type of 3D printing, together with the new properties, has resulted in new implementations such as microfluidic, biomedical devices, and soft robotics. Therefore, the focus here is on photopolymerization-based additive manufacturing including the recent development of new methods, novel monomers, and photoinitiators, which result in previously inaccessible applications such as complex ceramic structures, embedded electronics, and responsive 3D objects.

While much of the hype might have gone, the research on one-dimensional (1D) nano materials has matured as one of the most active research areas within the nano science and nano technology community, flourishing with ample, exciting, and new research opportunities. Just like any other research frontier, researchers working in the 1D nano materials field are constantly striving to develop new fundamental science as well as potential applications. It remains a common belief that versatility and tunability of 1D nano materials would challenge many new rising tasks coming from our resource and energy demanding modern society. The traditional semiconductor industry has produced so many devices and systems from transistors, sensors, lasers, and LEDs to more sophisticated solar panels, which are now part of our daily lives. By down sizing the core components or parts to 1D form, one might wonder how fundamentally the dimensionality and morphology would impact the device performance, this is, as always, requiring us to fully understand the structure-property relationship in 1D nano materials. It may be equally crucial in connecting discovery-driven fundamental science to market-driven technology industry concerning potentially relevant findings derived from these novel materials. The importance of a platform that allows active researchers in this field to present their new development in a timely and efficient manner is therefore self-evident. Following the success of two early special issues devoted to 1D nano materials, this is the third one in a row organized by the same group of guest editors, attesting that such a platform has been well received by the readers\n\nCorrecting and coating thin walled X-ray Optics via a combination of controlled film deposition and magnetic smart materials\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nUlmer, Melville\n\nThe project goal is to demonstrate that thin walled (price. Since the desired surface area for the next generation X-ray telescope is >10x that of Chandra, the >10x requirement is then for >200 m^2 of surface area with a surface finish of better than 0.5 nm. Therefore, replication of some sort is called for. Because no replication technology has been shown to achieve â¤1\" angular resolution, post fabrication figure corrections are likely going to be necessary. Some have proposed to do this in orbit and others prelaunch including us. Our prelaunch approach is to apply in-plane stresses to the thin walled mirror shells via a magnetic field. The field will be held in by some magnetically hard material such as NiCo. By use of a so called magnetic smart material (MSM) such as Terfenol-D, we already shown that strong enough stresses can be generated. Preliminary work has also shown that the magnetic field can be held in well enough to apply the figure correcting stresses pre-launch. What we call \"set-it and forget-it.\" However, what is unique about our approach is that at the cost of complexity and some areal coverage, our concept will also accommodate in-orbit adjustments. Furthermore, to the best of our knowledge ours is one of two known stress modification processes that are bi-axial. Our plan is first to validate set-it and forget-it first on cantilevers and then to expand this to working on 5 cm x 5 cm pieces. We will work both with NiCo and glass or Si coated with Terfenol-D. Except for the NiCo, substrates we will also coat the samples with NiCo in order to have a film that will hold in the magnetic field. As part of the coating process, we will control the stress of the film by varying the voltage bias while coating. The bias stress control can be used to apply films with minimal stress such as Terfenol-D and X-ray reflecting coatings such as Ir. Ir is a highly desirable coating for soft X-ray astronomy mirrors that can have significant built in stress unless\n\nPANI Branches onto Donor-Acceptor Copolymers: Synthesis, Characterization and Electroluminescent Properties of New 2D-Materials\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nIgnacio A.

To investigate the effects of the perpendicular PANI branches on the properties of the main chain, the optical, electrochemical, morphological and electroluminescence properties were studied. The 2D materials tend to possess lower molecular weights and to absorb and to emit light red-shifted compared to the trunk 1D-polymers, in the yellow-red region of the visible spectrum. The 1D- and 2D-conjugated polymers present optical band gaps ranging from 2.15â2.55 eV, HOMO energy levels between â5.37 and â5.60 eV and LUMO energy levels between â3.02 and â3.29 eV. OLED devices based on these copolymers were fabricated. Although the performances were far from optimal due to the high turn-on voltages for which electroluminescence phenomena occur, a maximum luminescence of 55,100 cd/m2 together with a current density of 65 mA/cm2 at 18.5 V were recorded for a 2D-copolymer, PAFC6TBQ-PANI.\n\nTheory of Magnetoelectric Properties of 2D Systems\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nChen, S.

'Theory of Magnetoelectric Properties of 2D Systems' develops the generalized tight-binding model in order to comprehend the rich quantization phenomena in 2D materials. The unusual effects, taken into consideration simultaneously, mainly come from the multi-orbital hybridization, the spin-orbital coupling, the intralayer and interlayer atomic interactions, the layer number, the stacking configuration, the site-energy difference, the magnetic field, and the electric field. The origins of the phenomena are discussed in depth, particularly focusing on graphene, tinene, phosphorene and MoS2, with a broader model also drawn. This model could be further used to investigate electronic properties of 1D and 3D condensed-matter systems, and this book will prove to be a valuable resource to researchers and graduate students working in 2D materials science.\n\nMXeneâ2D layered electrode materials for energy storage\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nHao Tang\n\n2018-04-01\n\nFull Text Available As promising candidates of power resources, electrochemical energy storage (EES devices have drawn more and more attention due to their ease of use, environmental friendliness, and high transformation efficiency. The performances of EES devices, such as lithium-ion batteries, sodium-ion batteries, and supercapacitors, depend largely on the inherent properties of electrode materials. On account of the outstanding properties of graphene, a lot of studies have been carried out on two-dimensional (2D materials. Over the past few years, a new exfoliation method has been utilized to successfully prepare a new family of 2D transition metal carbides, nitrides, and carbonitrides, termed MXene, from layered precursors.

Here, for the first time, and in order to promote this OSC architecture, we review the progress implemented by the application of two-dimensional (2D) materials in the field of blend bulk heterojunction ternary OSCs. Power conversion efficiency (PCE) improvements of the order of 40% compared to the reference binary devices, and PCEs in excess of 8% have been reported by incorporating graphene-based or other 2D materials as a third element inside the active layer. These OSCs combine the synergetic advantages of ternary devices and the superb properties of the 2D material family. In conclusion, the incorporation of the unique properties of graphene and other 2D materials inside the active layer opens up a very promising pathway in the design and construction of high-performance, simply fabricated and low- cost photovoltaic devices.\n\nCombining 3D printed forms with textile structures - mechanical and geometrical properties of multi-material systems\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nSabantina, L; Kinzel, F; Ehrmann, A; Finsterbusch, K\n\n2015-01-01\n\nThe 3D printing belongs to the rapidly emerging technologies which have the chance to revolutionize the way products are created. In the textile industry, several designers have already presented creations of shoes, dresses or other garments which could not be produced with common techniques. 3D printing, however, is still far away from being a usual process in textile and clothing production. The main challenge results from the insufficient mechanical properties, especially the low tensile strength, of pure 3D printed products, prohibiting them from replacing common technologies such as weaving or knitting. Thus, one way to the application of 3D printed forms in garments is combining them with textile fabrics, the latter ensuring the necessary tensile strength. This article reports about different approaches to combine 3D printed polymers with different textile materials and fabrics, showing chances and limits of this technique.

In the design and optimization of such 3D flux machines, the 3D vector magnetic properties of magnetic materials should be properly determined, modeled, and applied for accurate calculation of the magnetic field distribution, parameters, and performance. This paper presents the measurement of 3D vector magnetic properties and determination of 3D reluctivity tensor of SMC. The reluctivity tensor is a key factor for accurate numerical analysis of magnetic field in a 3D flux SMC motor\n\nDesktop-Stereolithography 3D-Printing of a Poly(dimethylsiloxane)-Based Material with Sylgard-184 Properties.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nBhattacharjee, Nirveek; Parra-Cabrera, Cesar; Kim, Yong Tae; Kuo, Alexandra P; Folch, Albert\n\n2018-05-01\n\nThe advantageous physiochemical properties of poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) have made it an extremely useful material for prototyping in various technological, scientific, and clinical areas. However, PDMS molding is a manual procedure and requires tedious assembly steps, especially for 3D designs, thereby limiting its access and usability. On the other hand, automated digital manufacturing processes such as stereolithography (SL) enable true 3D design and fabrication. Here the formulation, characterization, and SL application of a 3D-printable PDMS resin (3DP-PDMS) based on commercially available PDMS-methacrylate macromers, a high-efficiency photoinitiator and a high-absorbance photosensitizer, is reported. Using a desktop SL-printer, optically transparent submillimeter structures and microfluidic channels are demonstrated. An optimized blend of PDMS-methacrylate macromers is also used to SL-print structures with mechanical properties similar to conventional thermally cured PDMS (Sylgard-184). Furthermore, it is shown that SL-printed 3DP-PDMS substrates can be rendered suitable for mammalian cell culture. The 3DP-PDMS resin enables assembly-free, automated, digital manufacturing of PDMS, which should facilitate the prototyping of devices for microfluidics, organ-on-chip platforms, soft robotics, flexible electronics, and sensors, among others.

Indeed, the ability to three-dimensionally interweave biological and functional materials could enable the creation of devices possessing unique geometries, properties, and functionalities. Yet, most high quality functional materials are two dimensional, hard and brittle, and require high crystallization temperatures for maximal performance. These properties render the corresponding devices incompatible with biology, which is three-dimensional, soft, stretchable, and temperature sensitive. We overcome these dichotomies by: 1) using 3D printing and scanning for customized, interwoven, anatomically accurate device architectures; 2) employing nanotechnology as an enabling route for overcoming mechanical discrepancies while retaining high performance; and 3) 3D printing a range of soft and nanoscale materials to enable the integration of a diverse palette of high quality functional nanomaterials with biology. 3D printing is a multi-scale platform, allowing for the incorporation of functional nanoscale inks, the printing of microscale features, and ultimately the creation of macroscale devices. This three-dimensional blending of functional materials and `living' platforms may enable next-generation 3D printed devices.\n\nDetermining the Gaussian Modulus and Edge Properties of 2D Materials: From Graphene to Lipid Bilayers\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nZelisko, Matthew; Ahmadpoor, Fatemeh; Gao, Huajian; Sharma, Pradeep\n\n2017-08-01\n\nThe dominant deformation behavior of two-dimensional materials (bending) is primarily governed by just two parameters: bending rigidity and the Gaussian modulus. These properties also set the energy scale for various important physical and biological processes such as pore formation, cell fission and generally, any event accompanied by a topological change. Unlike the bending rigidity, the Gaussian modulus is, however, notoriously difficult to evaluate via either experiments or atomistic simulations. In this Letter, recognizing that the Gaussian modulus and edge tension play a nontrivial role in the fluctuations of a 2D material edge, we derive closed-form expressions for edge fluctuations. Combined with atomistic simulations, we use the developed approach to extract the Gaussian modulus and edge tension at finite temperatures for both graphene and various types of lipid bilayers. Our results possibly provide the first reliable estimate of this elusive property at finite temperatures and appear to suggest that earlier estimates must be revised. In particular, we show that, if previously estimated properties are employed, the graphene-free edge will exhibit unstable behavior at room temperature. Remarkably, in the case of graphene, we show that the Gaussian modulus and edge tension even change sign at finite temperatures.\n\nMagnetocrystalline anisotropy in a (110) (Tb0.27Dy0.73)Fe2 thin-film\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nFuente, C de la; Arnaudas, J I; Benito, L; Ciria, M; Moral, A del; Dufour, C; Dumesnil, K\n\n2004-01-01\n\nMagnetic anisotropy measurements performed in a (110) (Tb 0.27 Dy 0.73 )Fe 2 (Terfenol-D) film epitaxially grown on a sapphire substrate are presented. The magnetic torque curves have been determined by using a vectorial vibrating sample magnetometer, which allows us to measure the angular dependence of magnetization components parallel, M parallel , and perpendicular, M perp , to the applied field up to 2 T. The fourfold symmetry associated with the cubic structure within the (110) plane is clearly observed. The analysis of the experimental torque has been carried out considering magnetocrystalline anisotropy up to sixth order and magnetoelastic energy up to second order; so, the magnetocrystalline anisotropy constants in the (110) plane of the film, K 1 and K 2 , have been obtained. This allows us to determine the direction of the magnetization easy axis for (110) Terfenol-D thin-film: it is [1bar12] at RT, passes through [3bar34] at 140 K and then changes to [1bar20] at 40 K. It was completely impossible to explain the angular dependence of the experimental magnetic torque without including shear and tetragonal magnetoelastic stress parameters, b 2 and b 1 , respectively. This confirms the paramount role of the strain in the determination of the magnetic properties in this kind of Terfenol-D thin film\n\nStructural transformation in monolayer materials: a 2D to 1D transformation.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nMomeni, Kasra; Attariani, Hamed; LeSar, Richard A\n\n2016-07-20\n\nReducing the dimensions of materials to atomic scales results in a large portion of atoms being at or near the surface, with lower bond order and thus higher energy. At such scales, reduction of the surface energy and surface stresses can be the driving force for the formation of new low-dimensional nanostructures, and may be exhibited through surface relaxation and/or surface reconstruction, which can be utilized for tailoring the properties and phase transformation of nanomaterials without applying any external load. Here we used atomistic simulations and revealed an intrinsic structural transformation in monolayer materials that lowers their dimension from 2D nanosheets to 1D nanostructures to reduce their surface and elastic energies. Experimental evidence of such transformation has also been revealed for one of the predicted nanostructures. Such transformation plays an important role in bi-/multi-layer 2D materials.\n\n3D printing of bacteria into functional complex materials.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nSchaffner, Manuel; RÃ¼hs, Patrick A; Coulter, Fergal; Kilcher, Samuel; Studart, AndrÃ© R\n\n2017-12-01\n\nDespite recent advances to control the spatial composition and dynamic functionalities of bacteria embedded in materials, bacterial localization into complex three-dimensional (3D) geometries remains a major challenge. We demonstrate a 3D printing approach to create bacteria-derived functional materials by combining the natural diverse metabolism of bacteria with the shape design freedom of additive manufacturing. To achieve this, we embedded bacteria in a biocompatible and functionalized 3D printing ink and printed two types of \"living materials\" capable of degrading pollutants and of producing medically relevant bacterial cellulose. With this versatile bacteria-printing platform, complex materials displaying spatially specific compositions, geometry, and properties not accessed by standard technologies can be assembled from bottom up for new biotechnological and biomedical applications.\n\nDirect G-code manipulation for 3D material weaving\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nKoda, S.; Tanaka, H.\n\n2017-04-01\n\nThe process of conventional 3D printing begins by first build a 3D model, then convert to the model to G-code via a slicer software, feed the G-code to the printer, and finally start the printing. The most simple and popular 3D printing technique is Fused Deposition Modeling. However, in this method, the printing path that the printer head can take is restricted by the G-code. Therefore the printed 3D models with complex pattern have structural errors like holes or gaps between the printed material lines. In addition, the structural density and the material's position of the printed model are difficult to control. We realized the G-code editing, Fabrix, for making a more precise and functional printed model with both single and multiple material. The models with different stiffness are fabricated by the controlling the printing density of the filament materials with our method. In addition, the multi-material 3D printing has a possibility to expand the physical properties by the material combination and its G-code editing. These results show the new printing method to provide more creative and functional 3D printing techniques.\n\nMagnetocaloric effect in (Tb,Dy,R)(Co,Fe).sub.2./sub.

In this work, graphene was investigated as a potential filler material to provide rheological properties necessary for direct-write three-dimensional (3D) printing and electrostatic discharge properties to the printed component. The rheological properties of epoxy/graphene mixtures were characterized, and printable epoxy/graphene inks formulated. Sheet resistance values for printed epoxy/graphene composites ranged from 0.67 Ã 102 Î©/sq to 8.2 Ã 103 Î©/sq. The flexural strength of printed epoxy/graphene composites was comparable to that of cast neat epoxy ( 80 MPa), suggesting great potential for these new materials in multifunctional 3D-printed devices.\n\nPetri Net-Based R&D Process Modeling and Optimization for Composite Materials\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nXiaomei Hu\n\n2013-01-01\n\nFull Text Available Considering the current R&D process for new composite materials involves some complex details, such as formula design, specimen/sample production, materials/sample test, assessment, materials/sample feedback from customers, and mass production, the workflow model of Petri net-based R&D process for new composite materialsâ is proposed. By analyzing the time property of the whole Petri net, the optimized model for new composite materials R&D workflow is further proposed. By analyzing the experiment data and application in some materials R&D enterprise, it is demonstrated that the workflow optimization model shortens the period of R&D on new materials for 15%, definitely improving the R&D efficiency. This indicates the feasibility and availability of the model.\n\nStructure and properties of phosphorene-like IV-VI 2D materials.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nMa, Zhinan; Wang, Bo; Ou, Liangkai; Zhang, Yan; Zhang, Xu; Zhou, Zhen\n\n2016-10-14\n\nBecause of the excellent physical and chemical properties of phosphorene, phosphorene and phosphorene-like materials have attracted extensive attention. Since phosphorus belongs to group V, some group IV-VI compounds could also form phosphorene-like configurations. In this work, GeO, SnO, GeS, and SnS monolayers were constructed to investigate the structural and electronic properties by employing first-principles computations. Phonon spectra suggest that these monolayers are dynamically stable and could be realized in experiments. These monolayers are all semiconductors with the band gaps of 2.26Â â¼Â 4.13 eV. Based on the monolayers, GeO, SnO, GeS, and SnS bilayers were also constructed. The band gaps of these bilayers are smaller than those of the corresponding monolayers. Moreover, the optical properties of these monolayers and bilayers were calculated, and the results indicate that the SnO, GeS and SnS bilayers exhibit obvious optical absorption in the visible spectrum. All the results suggest that phosphorene-like IV-VI materials are promising candidates for electronic and optical devices.\n\nProperties of nanoclay PVA composites materials\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nMohamed H. M. Ali\n\n2012-03-01\n\nFull Text Available Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA/ Na-rich Montmorillonite (MMT nanocomposites were prepared using solution method to create polymer-clay nanocomposite (PCN material. The PCN material was studied using X-ray diffraction (XRD, demonstrating polymer-clay intercalation that has a high d-spacing (lower diffraction angles in the PCN XRD pattern, compared to the pure MMT clay XRD pattern, which has a low d-spacing (high diffraction angles. The nano-scanning electron microscope (NSEM was used to study the morphological image of the PVA, MMT and PCN materials. The results showed that intercalation that took place between the PVA and MMT produced the PCN material. The mechanical properties of the pure PVA and the intercalated polymer material were studied. It was found that the small amount of MMT clay made the tensile modulus and percentage of the total elongation of the nano-composite significantly higher than the pure PVA polymer value, due to polymer-clay intercalation. The thermal stability of the intercalated polymer has been studied using thermal analytical techniques such as thermogravimetric analysis (TGA and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC. The results showed that the PCN material is more thermally stable than the pure PVA polymer.\n\nColossal magnetodielectric effect caused by magnetoelectric effect ...\n\nIndian Academy of Sciences (India)\n\nThe colossal magnetodielectric effect is reported in Pb(Zr,Ti)O3/Terfenol-D laminate composite under low magnetic field.

In this approach, a nozzle is translated omnidirectionally within a soft matrix that surrounds and supports the patterned material. To optimize print fidelity, we have investigated the effects of matrix viscoplasticity on the EMB3D printing process. Specifically, we determine how matrix composition, print path and speed, and nozzle diameter affect the yielded region within the matrix. By characterizing the velocity and strain fields and analyzing the dimensions of the yielded regions, we determine that scaling relationships based on the Oldroyd number, Od, exist between these dimensions and the rheological properties of the matrix materials and printing parameters. Finally, we use EMB3D printing to create complex architectures within an elastomeric silicone matrix. Our methods and findings will both facilitate future characterization of viscoplastic matrices and motivate the development of new materials for EMB3D printing.\n\nNonlinear Modeling and Characterization of the Villari Effect and Model-guided Development of Magnetostrictive Energy Harvesters and Dampers\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nDeng, Zhangxian\n\nThe Villari effect, through which mechanical energy is transferred to magnetic energy in magnetostrictive materials can be utilized in energy harvester and damper designs. Significant research has been conducted on two magnetostrictive materials, Terfenol-D (TbxDy1-xFe2.0, x â 0.3) and Galfenol (Fe1-xGax, 0.15 â¤ x â¤ 0.3), due to their high magnetomechanical coupling. Both materials have strengths and weaknesses. Terfenol-D exhibits low eddy current loss, but it is brittle and difficult to machine. Terfenol-D also provides higher magnetostriction while requiring a large magnetic field. On the other hand, Galfenol is mechanically robust, and thus can be machined, welded, and formed into complex geometries. However, due to its severe eddy current effect, lamination is necessary in high frequency applications. This work first characterized the Villari effect of Galfenol in terms of the piezo-magnetic constant d33* and hysteresis loss. The stress-flux density loops of oriented, polycrystalline Fe18.4Ga81.6 Galfenol were measured at quasi-static and dynamic regimes (up to 800 Hz). Advanced modeling tools are necessary for magnetostrictive device development. On the material level, this work proposed a dynamic, discrete energy-averaged (DEA) model incorporating time-dependent volume fractions into the static DEA framework. This dynamic DEA model took eddy current loss, mechanical loss, and pinning site loss into account and accurately simulated the measured Villari effect up to 600 Hz. On the system level, this work integrated a hysteresis static DEA model with a 3D finite element (FE) framework, and accurately modeled stress-flux density minor loops in a quasi-static state. Based on the assumption that the magnetostriction and magnetization are uniaxial, this work also proposed an efficient 2D FE framework describing nonlinear magnetostrictive responses via interpolation functions. This enhanced knowledge of the Villari effect facilitates magnetostrictive vibration\n\nGiant Thermal Expansion in 2D and 3D Cellular Materials.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nZhu, Hanxing; Fan, Tongxiang; Peng, Qing; Zhang, Di\n\n2018-03-25\n\nWhen temperature increases, the volume of an object changes. This property was quantified as the coefficient of thermal expansion only a few hundred years ago. Part of the reason is that the change of volume due to the variation of temperature is in general extremely small and imperceptible. Here, abnormal giant linear thermal expansions in different types of two-ingredient microstructured hierarchical and self-similar cellular materials are reported. The cellular materials can be 2D or 3D, and isotropic or anisotropic, with a positive or negative thermal expansion due to the convex or/and concave shape in their representative volume elements respectively. The magnitude of the thermal expansion coefficient can be several times larger than the highest value reported in the literature. This study suggests an innovative approach to develop temperature-sensitive functional materials and devices. Â© 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

In the case of spin symmetry the D dimensional Dirac equation reduces to the D dimensional Schrodinger equation. The D dimensional relativistic energy spectra are obtained from D dimensional relativistic energy eigen value equation by using Mat Lab software. The corresponding D dimensional radial wave functions are formulated in the form of generalized Jacobi polynomials. The thermodynamically properties of materials are generated from the non-relativistic energy eigen-values in the classical limit. In the non-relativistic limit, the relativistic energy equation reduces to the non-relativistic energy. The thermal quantities of the system, partition function and specific heat, are expressed in terms of error function and imaginary error function which are numerically calculated using Mat Lab software.\n\nMultifunctional Cellular Materials Based on 2D Nanomaterials: Prospects and Challenges.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nQiu, Ling; He, Zijun; Li, Dan\n\n2018-01-01\n\nRecent advances in emerging 2D nanomaterial-based cellular materials (2D-CMs) open up new opportunities for the development of next generation cellular solids with exceptional properties.

Specifically, the later denominated Material Extrusion Additive Manufacturing (MEAM), was first developed by S. Scott Crump around 1988 and trademarked later as Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM). Although all of these technologies have been around for a while, it was not until recently that they have been more accessible to everyone. Today, the market of 3D printers covers all ranges of price, from very specialized, heavy and expensive machines, to desktop printers of only a few cubic inches in volume. Until recently, FDM technology had remained somewhat stagnant in terms of developments; however, with the new market boom, scholars and hobbyists have opened new doors for investigation in this area. The technology is now better understood from a software, mechanical, electrical and not less important, materials point of view. The current availability of materials for MEAM is very broad: PLA (Polylactic Acid), ABS (Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene), PC (Polycarbonate), PEEK (Polyether Ether Ketone), nylon, polyurethanes, and many others. Even so, these are all materials that were used before for other technologies, adapted but not specifically developed for MEAM. The processes that take place during the production of a part are currently not very well understood, and the final properties exhibited are long ways away from reaching the potential of more traditional manufacturing techniques. Due to the nature of the process, all the material properties always display a certain level of anisotropy. The research covered in these pages aims to shed some light on understanding the different mechanics taking place during the extrusion process of additive manufacturing. The development of new materials for MEAM has been explored. Several blends and composites have been developed, and their tensile properties and fracture mechanics evaluated.

Using the light-induced polymerization 3D printing techniques, we synthesize the energy storage gel and shape it on a 3D printer at the same time. By optimizing the 3D printing conditions, including layer thickness, curing time and light source, etc., the 3D printing objects are obtained.\n\nModeling Non-Linear Material Properties in Composite Materials\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\n2016-06-28\n\nTechnical Report ARWSB-TR-16013 MODELING NON-LINEAR MATERIAL PROPERTIES IN COMPOSITE MATERIALS Michael F.

These printers are often employed in research and development fields related to engineering or architecture, especially for structural components or rapid prototyping. Recently, there is enormous progress in available materials for enhanced printing systems that allow additive manufacturing of complex functional products, like batteries or electronics. The polymer polylactic acid (PLA plays an important role in fused filament fabrication, a technique used for commercially available low-budget 3D printers. This printing technology is an economical tool for the development of functional components or cases for electronics, for example, for lab purposes. Here we investigate if the material properties of âas-printedâ PLA, which was fabricated by a commercially available 3D printer, are suitable to be used in electrical measurement setups or even as a functional material itself in electronic devices. For this reason, we conduct differential scanning calorimetry measurements and a thorough temperature and frequency-dependent analysis of its dielectric properties. These results are compared to partially crystalline and completely amorphous PLA, indicating that the dielectric properties of âas-printedâ PLA are similar to the latter. Finally, we demonstrate that the conductivity of PLA can be enhanced by mixing it with the ionic liquid âtrihexyl tetradecyl phosphonium decanoate.â This provides a route to tailor PLA for complex functional products produced by an economical fused filament fabrication.\n\nPrinting, folding and assembly methods for forming 3D mesostructures in advanced materials\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nZhang, Yihui; Zhang, Fan; Yan, Zheng; Ma, Qiang; Li, Xiuling; Huang, Yonggang; Rogers, John A.\n\n2017-03-01\n\nA rapidly expanding area of research in materials science involves the development of routes to complex 3D structures with feature sizes in the mesoscopic range (that is, between tens of nanometres and hundreds of micrometres). A goal is to establish methods for controlling the properties of materials systems and the function of devices constructed with them, not only through chemistry and morphology, but also through 3D architectures. The resulting systems, sometimes referred to as metamaterials, offer engineered behaviours with optical, thermal, acoustic, mechanical and electronic properties that do not occur in the natural world. Impressive advances in 3D printing techniques represent some of the most broadly recognized developments in this field, but recent successes with strategies based on concepts in origami, kirigami and deterministic assembly provide additional, unique options in 3D design and high-performance materials. In this Review, we highlight the latest progress and trends in methods for fabricating 3D mesostructures, beginning with the development of advanced material inks for nozzle-based approaches to 3D printing and new schemes for 3D optical patterning. In subsequent sections, we summarize more recent methods based on folding, rolling and mechanical assembly, including their application with materials such as designer hydrogels, monocrystalline inorganic semiconductors and graphene.\n\nFirst Principles Calculations of Electronic Excitations in 2D Materials\n\nDEFF Research Database (Denmark)\n\nRasmussen, Filip Anselm\n\nelectronic transport, optical and chemical properties.

The layered oxychalcogenides are composed of ionic oxide layers and covalent chalcogenide layers, which bring wide-gap and conductive properties to these materials, respectively. The electronic structures of the materials were examined by normal/inverse photoemission spectroscopy and energy band calculations. The results of the examinations suggested that these materials possess unique features more than simple wide-gap semiconductors. Namely, the layered oxychalcogenides are considered to be extremely thin quantum wells composed of the oxide and chalcogenide layers or 2D chalcogenide crystals/molecules embedded in an oxide matrix. Observation of step-like absorption edges, large band gap energy and large exciton binding energy demonstrated these features originating from 2D density of states and quantum size effects in these layered materials\n\nLow temperature radiative properties of materials used in cryogenics\n\nCzech Academy of Sciences Publication Activity Database\n\nMusilovÃ¡, VÄra; Hanzelka, Pavel; KrÃ¡lÃ­k, TomÃ¡Å¡; Srnka, AleÅ¡\n\n2005-01-01\n\nRoÄ. 45, Ä. 8 (2005), s. 529-536 ISSN 0011-2275 R&D Projects: GA AV ÄR(CZ) IBS2065109 Keywords : structural materials * radiant properties * cryostats Subject RIV: BJ - Thermodynamic"
