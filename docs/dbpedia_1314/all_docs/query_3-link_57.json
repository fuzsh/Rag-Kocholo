        "text": "Criterion Bluray On Amazon Bluray/DVD On Amazon\n\nIf anyone has any questions or wants to contribute to this page, please contact me here.\n\nThis is a personal fan site I made for the movie Its A Mad Mad Mad Mad World (Wikipedia page), one of my all-time favorite movies. I made this page with the understanding that it's covered under fair use (17 U.S.C. Â§ 107), but that's just for CYA. On the other hand if anyone at United Artists takes issue with this page, feel free to contact me. I am, first and foremost, a fan. I want more people to see and enjoy the movie, so I've included links to the Amazon pages for the blu-ray version and the Criterion blu-ray version (dual format, with all the extras). None of the Amazon links go to anything sold by me or anyone I know. The links just go the general 'ships from and sold by Amazon' pages.\n\nAs a kid I used to quiz my father about what all of those weird jobs (what the heck is a grip?, a best boy?, a gaffer?) in the credits at the end of movies, so I included references to all of the jobs mentioned in the credits below.\n\nThe main images below are all 1280x??? resolution, so you might want to make sure your viewing resolution is at least 1280 pixels wide.\n\nMad Mad Mad Mad World on TV Tropes, Wikipedia.\n\nNotes\n\nBilling was a huge problem with such a large cast of famous names. Stanley Kramer finally decided to give Spencer Tracy top billing, since he was the biggest film name in the cast. He then billed the leading comedians in alphabetical order, followed by supporting players billed the same way. The only name which didn't conform to this credit ranking besides Tracy's was Jimmy Durante's. Kramer wanted to give him special mention to compensate for the brevity of his role. 1\n\nThe one great clown Stanley Kramer didn't even approach was Charles Chaplin. The producer-director thought it would be impossible, since Chaplin was living in self-imposed exile in Switzerland and was so wealthy no amount of money could have lured him back to the screen. 1\n\nBud Abbott, Edward Brophy, Wally Brown, and George Burns were all offered roles, but declined. 1\n\nNote By John- This movie was filmed in 1962. Lou Costello died in 1959. 1\n\nWith $10 million in grosses in 1964, this was the second highest-grossing film of that year, just behind The Carpetbaggers (1964). As of 1970, it had made $60 million worldwide. 1\n\nHarold Lloyd was offered a role in the film but declined, as he was happily retired. It is believed by some that he was to have played the Santa Rosita mayor. 1\n\nThe film was originally titled \"Where, But In America?\", then later changed to \"One Damn Thing After Another\", and then finally became \"It's a Mad World\". Writer William Rose and director Stanley Kramer added additional \"Mad\"s to the title as time progressed. Kramer had considered adding a fifth \"Mad\" to the title before deciding that it would be too much, but later regretted not doing so. 1\n\nPremiered at the Cinerama Dome in Hollywood, CA, 11/7/63. It was the first film ever shown there. 1\n\nThe movie's musical beginning over the black screen causes some viewers today to think there is a defect in the video. 1\n\nThe first version of the screenplay was set in Scotland. William and Tania Rose originally envisaged it as a fairly small-scale British comedy akin to the many that Rose wrote during his years in Great Britain. Certain elements of the story are derived from Rose's famous script for \"Genevieve\". 1\n\nThe actual on-screen title of this movie is: \"It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World\", with \"It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World\" being the poster title. 1\n\nBig screen ensemble extravaganzas like this film, \"Around the World in 80 Days\" (1956) and others were an attempt to lure audiences back to the cinema. Television had become quite a competitive force in the mid century years and studios were feeling the loss of revenue. 1\n\nFor the launching of the film, the studio organized the most expensive press reception in the history of cinema at that time. Two hundred and fifty reporters from 26 countries were invited for four days of festivities, at a cost of $250,000. 1\n\nAn article about lost scenes.\n\nCriterion Bluray On Amazon Bluray/DVD On Amazon\n\nCrew\n\nAerial Supervisors\n\nI did not find a description of aerial supervision as far as filming, but I did find this page about aerial direction/coordination, which seems to be very close.\n\nThe aerial director is responsible for all functions of airplanes and helicopters as they pertain to motion pictures, television, and commercials, including determining which planes are needed, putting together a budget, and filming from a chase plane.\n\nFrank Tallman\n\nPaul Mantz\n\nNotes\n\nWhile being uncredited for animating the titles with Saul Bass, this was the first major work for Bill Melendez Productions, which would latter become more famous by animating Peanuts media by Charles M. Schulz who contacted Bill Melendez and his studio after seeing this movie. 1\n\nWilliam Rose's original story outline indicated that the five principals who visit Smiler Grogan's crash site were intended for Milton Berle, Sid Caesar, Phil Silvers, Jackie Gleason, and Red Skelton. Skelton was unable to take much time off from his television series The Red Skelton Hour (1951), and thus agreed to only make a cameo appearance in the film. However, his demands for a high salary led to Stanley Kramer turning him down. 1\n\nCriterion Bluray On Amazon Bluray/DVD On Amazon\n\nCrew\n\nAnimation Checker\n\nFrom this job posting, the Animation Checker ensures consistent and complete delivery of production material to vendor studios and controls quality to reduce post-production costs.\n\nCharacter Animator\n\nA character animator brings animated characters to life, essentially an actor with a pencil. 8\n\nInk And Paint\n\nIn ink and paint, a drawing is copied onto a sheet of clear cellulose, the outline on one side and the painted/colored figure on the other. 8\n\nStoryboards\n\nStoryboards are a series of pre-production drawings, a blueprint/roadmap of what's going to happen. 8\n\nNotes\n\nIn the opening title animation, a figure blows up the world and the actors' names scatter on the screen. For a very brief moment--only three frames, in fact--the letters form the names of the animators, including Bill Melendez, Bernard Gruver, and other animators. 1\n\nIn the animated sequence where a bicycle pump blows up the Earth there are a bunch of names flying around for a few frames, mostly people from the animation department. I found varying levels of attribution for these people. Some have a distinct, identifiable history like Jesse White (the radio operator in the air traffic control tower), and some have no attribution other than web pages listing names from this credit sequence. I've tried to keep the people below in descending certainty, from \"this is definitely that person\" to \"I have no idea who this is or if I've even got the name right.\"\n\nActor, Airport Tower Radio Operator:\n\nJesse White\n\nAnimation Checker\n\nIrene Wyman\n\nInk And Paint\n\nElenor Faith\n\nCharacter Animation\n\nBill Melendez\n\nBror Lansing\n\nProducion Manager: Animation\n\nAdrian Woolery\n\nStoryboards\n\nBernie Gruver\n\nBob Carlson\n\nEd Levitt\n\nAnimation:\n\nArt Goodman\n\nCharles Smith\n\nMary Cain\n\nMary Matthews\n\nThe animated credits show a \"DNA Smith,\" who might be Danny Smith.\n\nThe animated creds show a Hugh Childs, who I could not find definite mention of online. I found three references to the Hugh Childs Award, people who won the award, having something to do with art, but I could not find anything about the award itself.\n\nOther sites with lists of names from the credits mention an Oscar Dufau. In the animated credits I see Oscar H, R Hanssons, and To Oscar Hanssons. I wonder if this is an error on my part or the people making these other sites, or if there is a real person Oscar Dufau and a separate real person Oscar Hanssons.\n\nOther sites also mention a Peder Lester, who may or may not be the Carl Pederson and/or A O Carlperson from the animated credits.\n\nThe art director was Gordon Gurnee, who may or may not be the Mad Mad Dog Gees from the animated credits.\n\nI have not found anything about Bernard Halderson, Hellen Wells or Mary Kids.\n\nColonal Rhe\n\nThis one feels a bit iffy- does it refer to Robert Rheault? He served the US in the Korean War, joined the US Army Special Forces in 1961, later to have his career fall apart after the Green Beret Affair, a 1969 trial stemming from the killing of a suspected North Vietnamese double agent. Rheault was certainly active in 1962, but the trial was 7 years after the filming of Mad Mad Mad Mad World, so the animators couldn't have been reacting to the trial.\n\nOr RHE could just be a reference to Rolling Hills Estates, a California city incorporated in 1959.\n\nFederal Internal Revenue\n\nNow the IRS, the Internal Revenue Service. Later in the movie, Jonathan Winters' character speaks quite strongly about whoever finds the 350 G's having to pay taxes on it.\n\nMau Mau\n\nMau Mau was a phrase, now considered offensive, defined by the Merriam Webster Dictionary as \"to intimidate (someone, such as an official) through hostile confrontation or threats usually for social or political gain.\" The Mau Mau were an anti-European secret society in colonial Kenya.\n\nPorfumo\n\nPorfumo may be a reference to the Profumo Affair, a political scandal about John Profumo, British Secretary of War, having an affair with 19 year old Christine Keeler in 1961. 8\n\nYorty\n\nYorty may be a reference to Sam Yorty, mayor of Los Angeles from 1961 to 1973. Mad Mad Mad Mad World was filmed in 1962, so the timing fits this as a possibility. 8\n\nCriterion Bluray On Amazon Bluray/DVD On Amazon\n\nCrew\n\nArt Director\n\nAn art director is responsible for the visual style of animation. 6\n\nDirector Of Photography\n\nThe director of photography reads the screenplay and work closely with the director to discuss the look and feel of a film. They then research how to create the look through lighting, framing and camera movement and what they will need in terms of kit and crew to achieve this. 6\n\nProduction Design\n\nProduction designers create the way a film or TV drama looks. Films can be set in any number of places; a Victorian orphanage, a Caribbean cruise ship, or another planet, for example. They work with all the other visual departments, costume, lighting, visual and special effects, and graphic design. They help create the visual world in which the story is set. 6\n\nTechnicolor\n\nTechnicolor is a series of color motion picture processes. 8\n\nErnest Laszlo\n\nGordon Gurnee\n\nRudolph Sternad\n\nNotes\n\nBob Hope was to have a cameo in the film. During the production, Hope was arguing with the studio about the future projects that he was due in his contract, and they ultimately refused to allow him to appear. 1\n\nPossibly as a reflection of the battle over billing, after the leading players' names are listed alphabetically, hands appear to shift various names to the top. 1\n\nThe next-to-last film for production designer Rudolph Sternad. He died eight months before it was released. 1\n\nCriterion Bluray On Amazon Bluray/DVD On Amazon\n\nCrew\n\nAssisant Cameraman\n\nAssuming an assistant cameraman is same/similar to a trainee camerman... 6\n\nCamera trainees work with all members of the camera crew, but they usually work most closely with the second assistant camera (second AC) or clapper loader. They help prepare the kit at the beginning of the job and may be involved with camera and lens tests. They might mark actorsâ positions during rehearsals and keep records, camera logs and other paperwork ready for the edit.\n\nAssistant Director\n\nThe first assistant director (AD) is the directorâs right hand. First ADs plan the filming schedule, working with the director, director of photography and other heads of department to ensure an efficient shoot. 6\n\nAssistant Producer\n\nAs an assistant producer, you provide administrative and creative support to the producer of a film or TV production. Your job duties include organizing production activities, assisting with the management of the production budget, and participating in the post-production process.\n\nCamera Operator\n\nCamera operators are responsible for capturing the action. They shoot whatâs happening, whether thatâs on location for a news programme or documentary or a large multi-camera studio show or a major outside broadcast. They know which cameras to use in which conditions and consider the composition, framing and movement of a shot. 6\n\nFilm Editor\n\nThe editor puts together (cuts) the pictures (rushes) as they come in from the set (or lab, if the drama is being shot in celluloid). Films tend not to be shot in the order in which the story unfolds, so editors might be working on scenes from the end of the film before the beginning. Their job is to take scenes in non-story order and edit them bit-by-bit into a whole. 6\n\nProduction Coordinator\n\nProduction coordinators run the production office. When the line producer and production manager are on set, production coordinators are in charge of what goes on with the phones, photocopier and paperwork. 6\n\nProduction Manager\n\nA production manager is the manager of below-the-line personnel on film productions. They are responsible for day-to-day tasks such as budgeting, transportation/facilitation, and scheduling. The Directors Guild of America refers to production managers as âunit production managers.â 9\n\nSet Direction\n\nA Set Decorator is similar to an interior designer, but for a movie set. This person focuses on adding small details; things like paintings, lamps, and rugs â to convincingly set the scene.\n\nSound Editor\n\nThe sound editor is the creative genius behind a video productionâs selected sound. The final sound assortments play an artful role in calibrating the sound to the visual production. Depending on the scope of the production, some sounds are real-life captured on location. Other sounds are prerecorded and re-reenacted in the studio. Like the past, today some sounds are synthesized to create the desired sound effect. Sounds help to tie the viewerâs consciousness to whatâs happening on the screen. The job entails knowing how to integrate the sound and control the volume to get the desired results. Mastering sounds is a remarkable task thatâs recognized and awarded in the industry.\n\nSound Engineer\n\nA sound engineer is responsible for the technical side of a recording or live performance. The sound engineer designs and manages sound levels and outputs, and is responsible for maintaining the physical sound equipment, like amps and microphones. When a sound engineer is working on a recording, the responsibility doesn't end with the act of recording the performance. The sound engineer is then responsible for editing, mixing and mastering the tracks so they present the best performance consistent with the artist's vision. 7\n\nAnne Kramer\n\nBert Chervin\n\nBud Pine\n\nCharles Scott\n\nCharles Wheeler\n\nClem Beauchamp\n\nFrederic Knudtson\n\nGene Fowler\n\nGeorge Batcheller\n\nIvan Volkman\n\nJohn Kean\n\nJoseph Kish\n\nRichard Johnson\n\nRobert C Jones\n\nWalter Elliott\n\nAFL-CIO\n\nCasey Productions Inc\n\nCasey Productions Inc is a production company that appears to have done only the one movie, Mad Mad Mad Mad World. 8\n\nMPAA 8\n\nWestrex Recording System 8\n\nNotes\n\nWalter Elliott (1903-1984) won an Academy Award for this film in the Sound Effects department at the 36th Academy Awards in 1964. His acceptance speech was very short: \"From all of us in the mad, mad, mad world... Thank you very, very much\". 1\n\nCriterion Bluray On Amazon Bluray/DVD On Amazon\n\nCrew\n\nAssistant Company Grip\n\nTrainee grips start the day by helping to unload the truck with the gear that supports the cameras. Under supervision from the qualified grips, they move the equipment to the right place on location. Trainee grips are on set throughout the day. At the end of each shot, they help put equipment away thatâs no longer needed and set up the kit for the next shot. They do this until the end of filming and then they help put all the equipment away. The main role of trainee grips is to learn the trade. Gripsâ equipment, cranes, jibs and dollies (the wheeled platform that carries a camera and a camera operator), can be used in different ways. Trainee grips watch everything thatâs happening; learn how the gear is used and how to operate it. 6\n\nCasting\n\nIn the performing arts industry such as theatre, film, or television, a casting (or casting call) is a pre-production process for selecting a certain type of actor, dancer, singer, or extra for a particular role or part in a script, screenplay, or teleplay. This process is typically utilized for a motion picture,[1] television program, documentary, music video, play, or television advertisement, etc. This involvement in a dramatic production, advertisement, and or industrial video is intended for an audience, or studio audience.\n\nChief Gaffer\n\nGaffers work closely with the director of photography (DoP) to bring to life the overall look of a film by creating and controlling light. They work with the DoP to understand the desired light effects and figure out how to achieve them. They go on recces too see how the lighting will work on location and draw up a list of the kit that will be needed to achieve the artistic vision. Then they pitch for the kit. They put in a request to the line producer for the equipment they need and appoint a best boy to hire the crew and order the gear. During filming, they work out the positioning of the lights and fastest way to change the lighting setups between shots. Gaffers mediate between the DoP and the rest of the lighting crew. Theyâre also responsible for safety and need to comply with the law on electricity, driving and employment. 6\n\nCompany Grip\n\nGrips make sure that what the director and director of photography (DoP) want to achieve on a shoot is possible. While directors think of the artistry of the shots, grips work out how they are going to move the cameras to make that happen. Before filming starts, grips break down the script and work out with the DoP what equipment will be needed to support the cameras for each scene. They go on recces to check out the location. If filmingâs in an extreme place, like the Sahara desert or the top of Everest, they might need to adapt the equipment for the camera manoeuvres. They hire the equipment, recruit the crew and manage the budget. On shooting days, grips get to set early to set up the equipment. As soon as the camera starts to roll, they anticipate all the camera moves and deal with the unexpected or directors changing their minds. Working closely with the DoP, they find solutions on the hoof while thinking about the preparations required for the next camera setup. At the end of each day's shooting, grips oversee the packing up of all camera-support equipment. When filming in public spaces key grips will play a major role keeping the shoot safe. They will often liaise directly with hire companies, event managers and the police to ensure the public and the cameras arenât harmed. 6\n\nCostume Designer\n\nCostume is at the core of a film or TV drama. As well as contributing to the look, it helps actors feel emotionally connected to the character they are playing through wearing the characterâs clothes. Costume designers design, create and hire the costumes for the cast. They start by working with directors, producers, writers, the production designer and hair and makeup designer to contribute to the look and storytelling of the production. They research, sketch and draw mood boards of characters and clothes to communicate the style. They then break down the script, working out what they need to create or hire. Working within tight budgets and deadlines, they recruit a team, organise a schedule of purchases and ensure the costumes are created on time for fittings. With the help of the team they schedule fittings and take photographs. These are then discussed with the producer and director and signed off. Once shooting starts, they are always on set whenever there are new actors or new looks. 6\n\nCostume Supervisor\n\nCostume supervisors keep everything shipshape in the 'wardrobe department' and thrive on being organised. They work mainly on very big multi-camera shows that require multiple outfits, such as talent competitions and game shows. Working to the costume designerâs plans, they coordinate the work of the department, work out what clothes and accessories need to be made, hired or bought, what staff are needed and where. They also organise storage and supervise the tasks that need doing to ensure all work is done to schedule and budget. Costume supervisors work with the costume designer to ensure costumes or outfits are of the standard they require, ready and prepared in time for fittings, rehearsals, recordings or live shows. During filming, they supervise continuity of outfits, the cleaning, maintenance and any repairs or adjustments. When filming is over, they supervise any cleaning, repairing and returns. Costume supervisors are usually freelance, unless attached to large in-house art departments. 6\n\nHairdresser\n\nA hairdresser is a person whose occupation is to cut or style hair in order to change or maintain a person's image. This is achieved using a combination of hair coloring, haircutting, and hair texturing techniques. 8\n\nMake Up\n\nCosmetics (makeup) are constituted mixtures of chemical compounds derived from either natural sources, or synthetically created ones. Cosmetics have various purposes. Those designed for personal care and skin care can be used to cleanse or protect the body or skin. Cosmetics designed to enhance or alter one's appearance (makeup) can be used to conceal blemishes, enhance one's natural features (such as the eyebrows and eyelashes), add color to a person's face, or change the appearance of the face entirely to resemble a different person, creature or object. Cosmetics can also be designed to add fragrance to the body. 8\n\nMusic Editor\n\nMusic editors are responsible for all the music in a film or TV production, including the soundtrack and any music created by the composer. The extent of their role varies considerably depending on the type of production concerned. On a medium-budget film, they usually start work while the film is being edited. They work with the director to decide on the purpose of the music, find a style to suit the story and mark the points in the film where music is required (spotting). Then they develop the temp (temporary) score. Music editors then work closely with a composer, who is usually appointed by the director, and who composes the music using the temp score as a template. The temp score is also used by the film editors to achieve the right tempo with the cut. Music editors often act as a bridge between the sound and picture teams. They attend all recording sessions, helping with any revisions and design a 'click track' which is used to help the musicians achieve synchronisation with the movie. Working with a specialist music mixer, they create different mixes, lay down the tracks and fit them exactly to the picture, ready for the final mix or dub. One of the final tasks for music editors on films is preparing the cue sheet - a detailed breakdown of all the music featured on soundtracks. This is sent to the Performing Rights Society and all exhibitors so that royalties can be paid every time the film is screened. 6\n\nProperty Master\n\nA prop, or property, is any moveable item that can be seen on a film. It could be a hat, gun, cushion, wine glass, lightsaber, carpet, kitchen unit, tree or aircraft. Prop masters run the property department which makes, stores and transports the props as well as preps the props for each dayâs shoot. Prop masters usually start work a few weeks before shooting begins. They work with production designers, set decorators and art directors to work out what props are needed. They do research and then draw up properties lists, deciding which are to be hired and which are to be made. They create a âset and strikeâ schedule to share with location and construction departments Where props are to be made, prop masters recruit the carpenters, artists and prop makers and manage the schedule for production. Where they are hired, they work with the production buyers to source them. When shooting is finished, they return of all hired props and organise the sale or safe disposal of everything else. 6\n\nRe-recording\n\nRe-recording is the process by which the audio track of a film or video production is created. An Audio re-recording is often called a re-recording of music. As sound elements are mixed and combined the process necessitates \"re-recording\" all of the audio elements, such as dialogue, music, sound effects, by the sound re-recording mixer(s) to achieve the desired result, which is the final soundtrack that the audience hears when the finished film is played. 8\n\nScript Supervisor\n\nFilm and TV dramas are usually shot entirely out of sequence. Shooting is organised according to the practicalities of location and availability of cast rather than the unfolding of the story. Itâs the job of the script supervisor to check each filmed scene can be edited so it will make sense in the end. During pre-production script supervisors prepare a continuity breakdown; this is a document which analyses the script in terms of cast, actions, wardrobe and props in scenes and story days. Then they time the script, which is quite a skill in itself. Once filming starts, they closely monitor whatâs happening to check no dialogue is overlooked and the actions and eye-lines of the actors match. They keep detailed written and photographic records of dialogue, action, costumes and props. All camera and lens details are noted along with the slate and scene number information. They keep a progress report of each dayâs filming which goes to production and the visual effects (VFX) supervisor in the case of VFX shots. These records are invaluable. They mean directors and editors can find whatâs been shot and what the options are for each scene. They mean that when different takes are edited together, the film is consistent and makes sense. 6\n\nArt Cole\n\nArt Dunham\n\nBill Thomas\n\nClem Portman\n\nConnie Nichols CHS\n\nGeorge Lane SMA\n\nJoe Edesa\n\nJoe King\n\nLynn Reynolds\n\nMarshall Schlom\n\nMartin Kashuk\n\nMorris Rosen\n\nRoy Granville\n\nVinton Vernon\n\nStalmaster-Lister CO\n\nCasting company owned by Lynn Stalmaster.\n\nCriterion Bluray On Amazon Bluray/DVD On Amazon\n\nCrew\n\nPhotographic Effects And Special Effects\n\nI think, but I am not sure, that \"photographic effects\" in the context of early 1960's movie making might be what we now call \"visual effects,\" as distinct from special effects. Here are 3 articles about various types of effects:\n\nDifference Between Special Effects And Visual Effects\n\nIn-Camera Effects\n\nSpecial Effects In Film\n\nProcess Photography\n\nRear projection (background projection, process photography, etc.) is one of many in-camera effects cinematic techniques in film production for combining foreground performances with pre-filmed backgrounds. It was widely used for many years in driving scenes, or to show other forms of \"distant\" background motion. 8\n\nSound Recording\n\nSound recording and reproduction is the electrical, mechanical, electronic, or digital inscription and re-creation of sound waves, such as spoken voice, singing, instrumental music, or sound effects. The two main classes of sound recording technology are analog recording and digital recording. 8\n\nStunt Supervision\n\nThe Stunt Coordinator is the head of the stunt team for a film shoot. Many Stunt Coordinators have a dedicated team of stunt performers that they bring with them from project to project. Stunt Coordinators plan out each stunt in a film and ensure that it is done safely. They also help in securing well-fit Stunt Doubles and train Stunt Performers as well as talent if they are doing any of their own stunts. 9\n\nCarey Loftin\n\nDanny Lee\n\nFarciot Edouart ASC\n\nHal McAlpin\n\nIrmin Roberts ASC\n\nJames B Gordon ASC\n\nLinwood G Dunn ASC\n\nSaul Bass\n\nFilm Effects Of Hollywood\n\nSamuel Goldwyn Studio 8\n\nCriterion Bluray On Amazon Bluray/DVD On Amazon\n\nCrew\n\nErnest Gold\n\nMack David\n\nFour Mads are apparently just the music department as a group.\n\nShirelles\n\nCriterion Bluray On Amazon Bluray/DVD On Amazon\n\nUltra-Panavision 8\n\nNotes\n\nThe film was shot in Ultra-Panavision, which was a wide-screen process that made it possible to shoot a film in Cinerama but with only one camera. 1\n\nCriterion Bluray On Amazon Bluray/DVD On Amazon\n\nNotes\n\nAgoura\n\nKernville\n\nLong Beach\n\nMalibu\n\nOxnard\n\nPalm Desert\n\nPalm Springs\n\nPalos Verdes Estates\n\nSan Pedro\n\nSanta Ana\n\nSanta Barbara\n\nSanta Monica\n\nTwentynine Palms\n\nUniversal City\n\nYucca Valley\n\nCriterion Bluray On Amazon Bluray/DVD On Amazon\n\nCrew\n\nErnest Gold\n\nLos Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra\n\nCriterion Bluray On Amazon Bluray/DVD On Amazon\n\nCrew\n\nTania Rose\n\nWilliam Rose\n\nScreenplay\n\nCriterion Bluray On Amazon Bluray/DVD On Amazon\n\nCrew\n\nStanley Kramer as producer and director.\n\nDirector\n\nDirectors are the creative leads of the film. They hold the creative vision throughout the whole process, from pre-production through to the final edit. They are employed by the executive producer or producer, who is ultimately in charge of a production. Directors start with a script, and work with a screenwriter and sometimes a script editing team. Itâs not uncommon for the director to be the screenwriter as well. 6\n\nProducer\n\nProducers are at the financial, practical and creative heart of a film or TV drama. They are often the first to get involved, spotting the creative opportunity and commercial viability of a production. They continue as the driving force right through to distribution. 6\n\nNotes\n\nThe film's original title was \"Something a Little Less Serious,\" a reference to Stanley Kramer's reputation as a producer and director of message films. 1\n\nWhen the cast first assembled for a meeting with director Stanley Kramer, they were shown the stunts and second unit footage that had already been shot. Buddy Hackett was so impressed that he went to Kramer and asked, \"What do you need US for?\" 1\n\nIt became well known that Stanley Kramer was casting nearly every comedy performer he could think of. Some famous stars actually contacted Kramer to volunteer for the project or to inquire why they had not been contacted. 1\n\nStanley Kramer would later claim that this was the most difficult film he ever made. 1\n\nStanley Kramer, who was known for doing serious films like Inherit the Wind (1960) and Judgment at Nuremberg (1961), set out to make this the ultimate comedy film. 1\n\nStanley Kramer said that he allowed gambling on the set because it kept actors close by and thus let him use anyone on the spur of the moment. 1\n\nCriterion Bluray On Amazon Bluray/DVD On Amazon\n\nEstablishing shot, Smiler headed downhill.\n\nLocations\n\nI was going to do a whole bit about filming locations, but here's a video made by some people that put way more work into finding the locations.

When production of The Judy Garland Show (1963) ran into trouble, Garland had to turn down the part. Rooney eventually got the role of Ding \"Dingy\" Bell. Edie Adams, who was originally cast as Emeline, got the role of Monica. Ernie Kovacs--who was Adams' husband--was cast as Melville, but was killed in a car crash before shooting began. Sid Caesar replaced him. 1\n\nThe film's producers struck a deal with Chrysler to supply the bulk of the automobiles in the film. Among the vehicles supplied by Chrysler are Milton Berle's Imperial convertible, Sid Caesar's Dodge station wagon, at least two 1957 Plymouth Belvederes appearing as taxi cabs and countless, generic-looking black Dodge and Plymouth sedans, playing cop cars. 1\n\nAccording to an article in the 27 January 1962 edition of the Los Angeles Times, Carol Channing was cast in the role that eventually went to Edie Adams. 1\n\nCriterion Bluray On Amazon Bluray/DVD On Amazon\n\nActors\n\nEdie Adams as Monica Crump.\n\nEdie Adams almost didn't accept the role of Monica because her husband Ernie Kovacs had been killed in an auto accident a few months earlier. However, she did accept because Kovacs had died deeply in debt and she had vowed to pay off all of her husband's creditors--a pledge she fulfilled by accepting this and all other roles she was offered after his death. 1\n\nNotes\n\nSid Caesar got into a screaming battle with writer William Rose about re-writing his lines.

Hours later, when the cast returned from lunch, they found that he had not even been able to free his arms from the chair. In retaliation, Winters gave a three-hour lecture to Arnold Stang and Marvin Kaplan on forced potty training. 1\n\nWhen Jonathan Winters backed the truck into the water tower, it actually fell too soon, before the truck actually hit it. To compensate, special effects split the screen and slowed down the side with the water tower so that the fall would coincide with the hit. 1\n\nArnold Stang broke his left forearm just days before his scenes were shot. In all shots he wears a garage workman's gloves on both hands and his left arm is always crooked, and held in place by a cast concealed under his garage uniform. 1\n\nArnold Stang said in an interview that Stanley Kramer had offered to replace him in the cast at full pay since Stang's arm had been broken. Stang said that he told Kramer he would have taken the role even if he had lost his arm. 1\n\nThe role of Irwin the garage mechanic, played by Marvin Kaplan, was originally offered to Joe Besser. Besser was unable to participate when Sheldon Leonard and Danny Thomas could not give him time off from his co-starring role in the TV sitcom The Joey Bishop Show (1961). The role was then offered to Jackie Mason and finally to Stang's fellow voice artist Marvin Kaplan. Had Besser been able to accept the role, this film would have featured four of the six actors who played The Three Stooges. 1\n\nAllen Jenkins, Arnold Stang and Marvin Kaplan, who have minor roles in this film, had starred in the animated cartoon Top Cat (1961), which was majorly inspired by Phil Silvers's show The Phil Silvers Show (1955). 1\n\nMarvin Kaplan said that he and Arnold Stang were given the job of \"entertaining\" Jonathan Winters during the periods in between his scenes. 1\n\nCriterion Bluray On Amazon Bluray/DVD On Amazon\n\nCriterion Bluray On Amazon Bluray/DVD On Amazon\n\nCriterion Bluray On Amazon Bluray/DVD On Amazon\n\nCriterion Bluray On Amazon Bluray/DVD On Amazon\n\nCriterion Bluray On Amazon Bluray/DVD On Amazon\n\nCriterion Bluray On Amazon Bluray/DVD On Amazon\n\nNotes\n\nThe role of Ray (one of the gas station attendants) was intended for Jackie Mason.

The water tower crashed into the small building behind the station, which was rigged to collapse but was accidentally triggered before the water tower actually hit it. Special-effects technician Linwood G. Dunn was called in to optically fix the scene. Dunn took the scene and split-screened the small building, first freeze-framing it then catching the collapsing action up to the water tower strike. All this took place on the right side of the frame. 1\n\nOne scene that is in some versions but not in others occurs when Pike drives off after trashing the gas station. Some police officers, (who had been watching the entire time) go up to the wreckage and find Ray and Irwin underneath the rubble.

When his best friend and partner Oliver Hardy died in 1957, he pledged never to perform again. He kept that promise for the rest of his life. By the time this happened, a long shot of the character had already been filmed with a stand-in wearing Laurel's trademark bowler hat. This is why Benny is seen wearing a bowler hat despite never having worn one as part of his regular work. 1\n\nWhen Jack Benny shot his cameo appearance, Stanley Kramer let him hold his comic pause signature line \"Well . . . \" as long as he wanted. The entire crew was holding back laughter before he finally said the line. In the editing room, however, Kramer shortened the pause a bit. 1\n\nFeatures several pairs of actors known for working together who curiously share no scenes.

Stunt pilot Frank Tallman had to fly the aircraft directly through the center of the billboard so that the thicker frame would not shear off a wing. The billboard was located in Irvine, at what is now the intersection of Interstate 405 and Hwy 133 (Laguna Canyon) near Lion Country Safari, just east of John Wayne Airport. The stunt was practiced with the billboard made of paper. When the actual stunt was performed, the balsa wood stopped one engine and left the other sputtering. The plane barely made it back to John Wayne Airport. 1\n\nBecause Fitzgerald's Twin Beech was pretty much trashed during the making of the movie, soon after filming ended the plane was flown to nearby Ontario Airport to be displayed outside of the Planes of Fame Air Museum. Sadly, the Beech 18 would never fly again. She remained at the air museum until 1973, after which time it was transported, the few miles, up to Chaffey College's Aeronautics' Dept. There, this most unlikely of stunt planes stood proud, looking just as sleek and powerful as when she was a big star on the silver screen. 1\n\nAs tribute to this comedic touchstone, in a similar out of control scene in Fred Claus (2007), while Fred and Willie are careening around the world on Christmas Eve, delivering presents, Director David Dobkin inserted a quick cutaway shot of them flying their sleigh through a Pepsi billboard sign. 1\n\nThe plane flying through the hangar scene is paid homage to in the James Bond film Octopussy (1983). Roger Moore pilots a sleek little Bede BD-5J through a hangar, though in much more spectacular fashion. And some of that plane adorns the wall of Q's lab in the Pierce Brosnan Bond Film Die Another Day (2002). 1\n\nCriterion Bluray On Amazon Bluray/DVD On Amazon\n\nNotes\n\nFor the intermission of the premiere engagement at the Cinerama Dome in Hollywood, the filmmakers recorded messages supposedly sent over police radios describing what was happening to various characters. These messages were played not only in the auditorium during the intermission but at the concession stand and even in the bathrooms. 1\n\nDon Rickles reportedly wanted to be in the movie but was never asked. He never let Stanley Kramer live it down, either, even heckling him about it from the stage whenever Kramer came to see Rickles' show. 1\n\nThe main part of the film was shot during the summer of 1962 because many cast members were on hiatus from television series they were working on. 1\n\nIn addition to Cinerama showings, the film was also released in a 35mm version for regular movie theaters. The 35mm version was actually shorter than the 70mm Cinerama version, which included a prelude, an intermission, and special news inserts reporting the characters' progress in searching for the buried loot. 1\n\nDespite being released by Cinerama, this film was not shot in the three-strip Cinerama process. It was shot in Ultra Panavision 70, a one-strip process, and it was projected on the deeply curved original Cinerama screens (exclusive to Cinerama theaters) upon original release (the Cinerama release was followed by release to \"regular\" theaters). When projected on a huge curved screen, the Panavision 70 film somewhat mimics the Cinerama effect. The souvenir booklet for the film, sold during the picture's roadshow run, falsely boasted that the Cinerama image--which normally required the use of three strips of film on three projectors running simultaneously--had been \"miraculously blended into one\" when in fact the film was not being projected in Cinerama at all. 1\n\nHoward Morris was booked but he didn't appear in the film.

According to some exhibitors--from both the original roadshow version shown in Cinerama venues and the 35mm general release version--the biggest audience reaction occurred during the airport sequence when the camera would come down to reveal Moe Howard, Larry Fine, and Joe DeRita (aka The Three Stooges). Although they had no dialog or action, the image of the trio--dressed as firemen, complete with fire axes, waiting for the plane to land--not only resulted in laughter but often in applause from audiences. 1\n\nThe Three Stooges play firemen in this movie, this is a call back to their first screen performance ever: Soup to Nuts (1930) released in 1930 where they also played firemen. 1\n\nAs the Three Stooges make their short cameo, the first three notes of the song \"Three Blind Mice\" can be heard.

Was it rear-projected? Was the debris really in the same space as the actors? Was the debris in the same space as the plane but not the actors? It couldn't be CGI in that era. Was the debris green screened into the same space as the actors? I know this movie is 60 years old now and filmmaking has changed a great deal, but... There's no sign of charges. Some of the debris is way too small to be green screened (invented in the 1930's). The debris had to be in the same space as the plane. I followed one piece of debris that knocked over a ketchup bottle that had been handled by one of the actors, so the plane, the debris, and the actors had to all be in the same space. In the commentary on the Criterion Bluray someone said the plane is in fact in the same space as the actors, with an arrestor cable to stop the plane at the right spot.\n\nCriterion Bluray On Amazon Bluray/DVD On Amazon\n\nCriterion Bluray On Amazon Bluray/DVD On Amazon\n\nNotes\n\nThe Rancho Conejo Airport, where Dingy and Benjy land, was an actual airport in Newbury Park, CA, a part of Thousand Oaks, from 1960-65.

However, if watched closely enough for a few seconds, just as he throws his hands over his head, he laughs along with the rest of the men. 1\n\nCriterion Bluray On Amazon Bluray/DVD On Amazon\n\nCriterion Bluray On Amazon Bluray/DVD On Amazon\n\nThe final credits include special thanks--and apologies--to 15 different California communities. 1\n\nLinks\n\n90 Seconds: What Is\n\nCast List: Avelyman .com\n\nCast List: Fandom .com\n\nCast List: Liquisearch .com\n\nCast List: Three Stooges .net\n\nFilm Society Abbreviations\n\nInternet Movie Database\n\nScreen Skills\n\nShot On What\n\nStudio Binder: Film Crew Positions\n\nSync On Set: Quick Reference Guide\n\nTypes Of Visual Effects\n\nWikipedia\n\nFootnotes\n\n1: https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0057193/trivia/\n\n2: https://www.newsfromme.com/2021/12/28/ask-me-barrie-chase/\n\n3: https://lbpost.com/hi-lo/addison-long-beach-lost-roller-coaster-pike\n\n4: https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0867257/bio?ref_=nm_ov_bio_sm\n\n5: https://www.canyon-news.com/mad-cinerama-world-flying-high-9/146236\n\n6: https://www.screenskills.com/\n\n7: https://www.connollymusic.com/stringovation/what-is-a-sound-engineer-and-how-to-become-one\n\n8: https://www.wikipedia.org\n\n9: https://www.studiobinder.com/blog/film-crew-positions/"
