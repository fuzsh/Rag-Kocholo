        "text": "Peter III (marriage)\n\nOn August 21, 1745, Peter married Princess Sophia Augusta Frederica of\n\nAnhalt-Zerbst (Catherine II). Peter III was aged 17 and Catherine was only 16 years old when they tied the knot.\n\nThe marriage was a political one, and was organized by Empress Elizabeth.\n\nPeter and Catherine were completely\n\ndifferent, and had nothing in common.\n\nCatherine was a young woman of prodigious intellect, while Peter was a child interested only in military games. He has no interest in women, love, and did not find Catherine sexually attractive.\n\nCatherine, in her memoirs, described Peter as an \"idiot\", “drunkard from Holstein”, “good-for-nothing” and much more.\n\nTheir marriage was a loveless one, and Catherine did not receive any affection or romance, in fact, they failed to consummate their marriage until 1754, nearly ten years after they got married!\n\nPeter began to develop a strong mistrust in Catherine, believed to have started on the night she refused to toast to him at a large social event. He reported that her time was up and, it is believed, that he secretly made plans to lock her away.\n\nHer Lovers (Love)\n\nCatherine was famously loyal to her lovers, both during their relationship and after it ended. Always parting on good terms, she bestowed upon them titles, land, palaces and even people—gifting one former paramour with more than 1,000 serfs, or indentured servants.\n\nStanislaw Poniatowski, one of her earliest lovers and the father\n\nof one of her children, was believed to be Catherine's favourite lovers. Catherine even gave her support (both military and financial) behind Poniatowski in his effort to become king of Poland.\n\nDuring her husband's (Peter III) lifetime, she had at least three lovers. It is thought that she had affairs with Alexander Vasilchikov, Sergei Saltykov and Stanislaw August Poniatowski, among others.\n\nWho were her lovers, and did they receive any benefits?:\n\nStanislaw Poniatowski\n\nGregory Orlov: Gregory Orlov was a Russian nobleman who helped Catherine II assume power after her husband’s death. His relationship with the Empress brought him much power, she promoted him to the rank of Count and even considered marrying him\n\nGregory Potemkin: Gregory Potemkin was military man and Catherine II admired his brute strength, it was he who stole her away from Orlov. While many women in Catherine’s court found Potemkin’s crude ways repulsive Catherine was quite taken with him. While their affair did not last, their friendship did. When the sexual part of their dalliance was over Potemkin helped Catherine find new men\n\nIvan Rimsky-Korsakov: Rimsky-Korsakov was Catherine’s lover for a very short time. She enchanted by his “classic beauty”, singing skills, and reputation as a good lover. His charm with the ladies however cost him a great deal. Catherine discovered that he was also bedding her dear friend Praskovija. She immediately removed the two from their courtly positions\n\nAlexander Dmitriev-Mamonov: Count Alexander Dmitriev-Mamonov was a high ranking noble introduced to the Empress by Potemkin. She was taken in by his command of the French language, which was commonly spoken amongst the westernized Russian elite at the time, as well as his knowledge of literature. Dmitriev-Mamonov gained quite a bit rom his relationship with Catherine the Great. Her was promoted to the rank of Chamberlain and even given a suite of apartments at the WinterPalace in St. Petersburg.\n\nAlexander Lanskoy: While only 21 at the time he met the 50 year old Empress it is said the Lanskoy genuinely loved her. He did not ask for any political favors, bribes, or gifts\n\nIvan Shuvalov: Ivan Shuvalov was Russia first Minister of Education, he was also one of Catherine the Great’s many lovers. Shuvalov was 29 years younger than the Empress when they became romantically involved, much like Lanskoy he did not ask for much. Catherine the Great helped Shuvalov establish Moscow University, the first university in all of Russia.\n\nPlaton Zubov: Platon Zubov was one of the Empress’ last lovers. The 22 year old was able to convince the 60 year old Catherine to promote him not only to count but to the rank of prince. He amassed great wealth during their 7 year relationship and became one of the most powerful men in Russia during her reign"
