        "text": "[[File:|150px|center]] Stub\n\nThis article is a stub. You can help the The Great - Hulu Wiki by expanding it.\n\nTemplate:N/H\n\n“ All is bliss in the court of Catherine the Great ”\n\n—Catherine, \"And you Sir, are no Peter the Great\"\n\nCatherine (born Sophie of Anhalt-Zerbst), is the main protagonist of The Great. In \"The Great\", when her lady-in-waiting tells her that Russia does not use primogeniture to determine the line of succession to the Russian throne, herself, Marial and Count Orlo start a coup d'état in order to overthrow her husband, Peter III and establish an Enlightened Russia.\n\nAppearance[]\n\nCatherine is a fresh-faced girl in her early twenties. She frequently wears her blonde hair in an aristocratic updo. Her favorite colors to wear are pastels and florals, a contrast to the dark clothing favored in the Russian court.\n\nPersonality[]\n\nUpon arriving to Russia, she was innocent minded about love, obliviously presenting a disgusted Peter with a piece of evergreen to symbolize their eternal bond. Her bubbly and optimistic personality was quickly tested by the violence and chaos of Peter's court. After only a few days in Russia, wherein she was beaten, almost drowned, and had her dream of a school for girls crushed, she became suicidal. She tells Mariel that she'd felt \"like god had spat her on this earth for greatness\". When Mariel asks why she was born a woman, then, she answers \"for comedy, I guess.\" Mariel then tells her that if Peter dies, Catherine will become queen, and exits the room after leaving a bucket for Catherine to drain her blood to minimize the mess of her suicide. Catherine drops the knife and resolves to overthrow Peter.\n\nAs Catherine advances her coup, she hones her beauty and charisma to gather followers for her cause, insisting that she will create a more enlightened Russia. After failing to seduce--it was her first time doing so, at Mariel's insistence--palace intellectual Orlo, she eventually wins his loyalty by demonstrating their shared fondness for enlightenment era philosophers. She eventually recruits Velementov, the disillusioned leader of the Russian army, by promising that she can bring meaningful change.\n\nCatherine demonstrates that she has the same ruthlessness and cunning as the rest of the cast.\n\nAbilities[]\n\nFamily[]\n\nTemplate:Holstein-Gottorp-Romanov-Ascania Tree\n\nIn the show, Catherine is one of four daughters. Her sister Nina is married to the king of Portugal with multiple children, her sister Donna is married to the king of Spain and her sister Angela was due to marry the king of France, until she was refused because of Catherine's coup, which overthrew her husband.\n\nHistorical:\n\nChristian August of Anhalt (father)\n\nJoanna Elisabeth Holstein Gottorp (mother)\n\nWilliam Christian Frederick (brother)\n\nFrederick Augustus (brother)\n\nAuguste Christine Charlotte (sister)\n\nElisabeth Ulrike (sister)\n\nTwo miscarriages\n\nPaul Petrovich Romanov 'Paul I' (son recognized as Peter's, implied by Catherine to be Sergey Saltykov's)\n\nAnna Petrovna Romanova (daughter recognized as Peter's, implied by Catherine to be Sergey Saltykov's)\n\nAlexei Grigorievich Bobrinsky (illegitimate son by Grigory Orlov)\n\nElizabeth Grigorievna Temkina (alleged illegitimate daughter by Grigori Potemkin)\n\nWilhelmina Louisa of Hesse-Darmstadt 'Natalia Alexeievna' (daughter-in-law, Paul's first wife)\n\nStillborn son (grandson)\n\nPrincess Sophia of Württemberg 'Maria Feodorovna' (daughter-in-law, Paul's second wife)\n\nAlexander Pavlovich Romanov 'Alexander I' (grandson)\n\nLouise Maria Auguste of Baden 'Elizabeth Alexeievna' (granddaughter-in-law, Alexander's wife)\n\nKonstantin Pavlovich Romanov (grandson)\n\nJuliane Henriette Ulrike of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld 'Anna Feodorovna' (granddaughter-in-law, Konstantin's wife)\n\nAlexandra Pavlovna Romanova (granddaughter)\n\nJoseph Anton John Baptiste of Austria (grandson-in-law, Alexandra's husband)\n\nElena Pavlovna Romanova (granddaughter)\n\nFriedrich Ludwig of Mecklenburg-Schwerin (grandson-in-law, Elena's husband)\n\nMaria Pavlovna Romanova (granddaughter)\n\nKarl Friedrich of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach (grandson-in-law, Maria's husband)\n\nCatherine Pavlovna Romanova (granddaughter)\n\nPeter Friedrich Georg of Oldenburg (grandson-in-law, Catherine's first husband)\n\nFriedrich Wilhelm Karl of Württemberg 'Wilhelm I' (grandson-in-law, Catherine's second husband)\n\nOlga Pavlovna Romanova (granddaughter)\n\nAnna Pavlovna Romanova (granddaughter)\n\nWillem Frederik George Lodewijk of the Netherlands 'Willem II' (grandson-in-law, Anna's husband)\n\nNicholas Pavlovich Romanov 'Nicholas I' (grandson)\n\nFriederike Luise Charlotte Wilhelmine of Prussia 'Alexandra Feodorovna' (granddaughter-in-law, Nicholas's wife)\n\nMichael Pavlovich Romanov (grandson)\n\nFriederike Charlotte Marie of Württemberg 'Elena Pavlovna' (granddaughter-in-law, Michael's wife)\n\nTemplate:Relationships Template:Viewhistory\n\nSightings[]\n\nEpisodes[]\n\nSeries 1 Theme Tune: Absent 1. \"The Great\": Appears 6. \"Parachute\": Appears 2. \"The Beard\": Appears 7. \"A Pox on Hope\": Appears 3. \"And you Sir, are no Peter the Great\": Appears 8. \"Meatballs at the Dacha\": Appears 4. \"Moscow Mule\": Appears 9. \"Love Hurts\": Appears 5. \"War and Vomit\": Appears 10. \"The Beaver's Nose\": Appears\n\nTrivia[]\n\nGalleries\n\nReferences[]\n\nTemplate:Characters"
