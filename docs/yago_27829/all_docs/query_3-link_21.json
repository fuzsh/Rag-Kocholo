        "text": "Catherine the Great\n\nPortrait of a Woman\n\nBy Robert K. Massie\n\nRandom House\n\nCrushed to death by a horse in attempted copulation, the final act of a sexually voracious iron lady — for centuries, this has been the false legacy of Catherine the Great, a malicious rumor started and spread by her Russian adversaries upon her death, from a stroke, in 1796.\n\nIn fact, the young Catherine spent much of her young adulthood trapped in a horrific and sexless marriage to Peter III, heir to the Russian throne and quite possibly the worst royal husband this side of Henry VIII. In this thrilling new biography, Pulitzer Prize-winning historian Robert K. Massie details, with great humanity, the tortured early life of an iconic woman.\n\nShe was rejected at birth, as she would be for the first half of her life. Born Sophia Augusta Fredericka on April 21, 1729, the daughter of Prince Christian Augustus, a minor German royal, and his 16-year-old wife, Johanna, she was raised by nannies and servants, with little in the way of warmth and affection. Sophia’s mother did not kiss or cuddle or nurse her, not from the first — she demanded the baby be spirited away upon delivery — though she lavished attention and love on Sophia’s younger brother, Wilhelm, who died of scarlet fever at 12.\n\nJohanna’s interest in her daughter extended to making a good marriage — for Johanna’s sake entirely. Having been neglected and raised in isolation, Sophia turned to books for comfort, and by the time she was 10 exhibited a superior intellect and ability to control her emotions. An unrepentant social climber, Johanna began taking Sophia up and down Germany, presenting her at every party at every German court, no matter how minor. She was 10 when she met her future husband Charles Peter Ulrich, the grandson of Peter the Great. She later described her first impression of the young royal in her memoirs: “agreeable and well-bred,” she wrote, “although his liking for drink was already noticeable.”\n\nHe was 11.\n\nAn orphan, Peter was adopted by his aunt Elizabeth, Empress of Russia. He was her designated heir to the throne, but he, too, was prone to illness, and after falling so ill in the fall of 1743 that he couldn’t get out of bed for a month, she became alarmed. Elizabeth had no other children, and if Peter were to die without producing an heir of his own, the nation’s fate would be in question. So she sent for the young German princess who had been making such an impression on European courts.\n\nSophia was as excited and pleased as her mother; unloved, lonely, and intellectually unstimulated, she had dreamed, since meeting Peter, of greatness. For a woman of her time and status, this meant marrying a great man, or, at least, a man who would likely be placed into a position of greatness. Peter had his problems — he was unattractive, temperamental, childish, incurious — but he was also young, and none of these were deal-breakers. She was ambitious, and a marriage based on practical aspirations rather than passion was, for her, a willing compromise.\n\nBy the time they meet again, Sophia is 14, Peter 15. Though they both understand they are supposed to be married, Peter has no qualms in confiding to his future bride that he’s really in love with someone else but will do as his aunt, the empress, wishes.\n\n“I was astonished at his imprudence and want of judgement,” she later wrote in her memoirs. Yet she never let on how she felt, never displayed hurt or jealousy or anger — her chilly upbringing had left her with an unshakable sense of dignity and ability to keep her own counsel.\n\nIn many ways, Sofia and Peter had suffered similar childhoods, bereft of affection and bountiful in abuse — but Sofia emerged as a little adult, whereas Peter remained stuck at the emotional age of about 8. She was a 15-year-old girl who read the great philosophers — Voltaire, Cicero, Plutarch, Montesquieu. He was a 16-year-old virgin who alternately played with toy soldiers and made his servants dress up in military uniform and run drills. Remaining free time was spent drinking, smoking and wondering aloud: Why couldn’t he be king of Prussia instead? He hated Russia.\n\nThey were officially engaged, and Sofia — who had been renamed Catherine by the Empress Elizabeth, in honor of her own mother — was meant to get pregnant. There was, however, no chance of this, as Peter refused to touch his future bride, which resulted in Elizabeth unleashing her wrath on the teenage Catherine, herself a virgin who knew so little about sex she didn’t even know what the differences were between men and women.\n\nAs for Peter, to this day historians cannot agree on what was wrong with him. Massie theorizes that his utter disinterest — and, later, contempt — for Catherine was the result of two traumas: When Peter was 16, he contracted smallpox, which disfigured him so horribly that Catherine couldn’t hide her disgust. She later wrote that the sight of him caused her “terror . . . his face was practically unrecognizable.” Catherine was so disgusted that she actually ran back to her own apartment and fainted.\n\nIt’s also believed that Peter may have suffered from phimosis, a condition that can afflict uncircumcised men and which makes sex unbearably painful. Catherine, however, thought of Russia and forged ahead, and on Aug. 21, 1745, the unfortunate couple were married in a ceremony that proved to be a feat of stamina: Catherine’s ornate bridal gown, constructed in part of actual silver, was unbearably heavy, as was the crown she wore. At the reception, her headache was so painful that she begged Elizabeth to let her remove it; the empress refused.\n\nCatherine topped off her wedding night sitting in bed for hours, alone, waiting for her husband to join her. He finally popped in to say he was off to have supper, then returned hours later, thoroughly drunk and reeking of cigarette smoke. He passed out.\n\nFrom there, things only got worse. Whatever obstacles prevented Peter from having sex with his wife — and they did not have sex for the entirety of their nine-year-long-marriage — he had no problems performing with other women, who tended to be his wife’s ladies-in-waiting. He would routinely and gleefully humiliate Catherine in public, yet whine to her and seek her comfort when things didn’t go his way.\n\nNor would he afford his young wife basic human decency, tormenting her with his atonal violin playing and allowing his dogs to use the apartment as a toilet and bark away as she suffered agonizing headaches.\n\nThis, too, she wrote of in her memoirs:\n\n“In the first days of our marriage, I came to a sad conclusion about him. I said to myself, ‘If you allow yourself to love that man, you will be the unhappiest creature on this earth. With your temperament, you will expect some response whereas this man scarcely looks at you, talks of nothing but dolls and pays more attention to any other woman than yourself.’ . . . I took good care not to tell anybody that I had resolved never to love without restraint a man who would not return this love in full.”\n\nIt wasn’t long before Catherine realized that her courtiers — all of whom, along with the empress, were aware of this stubbornly sexless union — were subtly encouraging her to take lovers.\n\nIt was a practical, political calculation: Who knew if Peter was even capable of fathering a child? Should Catherine become pregnant, however, there would be no question in the public’s mind that this child would be the rightful heir to the throne.\n\nIn late 1752, seven years after her marriage, Catherine finally lost her virginity, to a young noble named Sergei Saltykov. Peter was all for it, and when Catherine gave birth to a son, Paul, he was officially recognized as Peter’s son, even though everyone within the palace walls believed Saltykov to be the father.\n\nCatherine was in love, but the handsome Saltykov was a cad. Now that he was rumored to have fathered the heir to the Russian throne, women were throwing themselves at him shamelessly, and he left. Empress Elizabeth, meanwhile, had taken the baby Paul from the moment he was delivered and refused to return him to Catherine, ever. She spiraled into a deep, clinical depression, holed up in a tiny, chilly room through the winter of 1754-55.\n\nWhen she had the energy, she immersed herself in reading, and it was during this time she became a student of the Enlightenment. With its elevation of reason above all else, it not only helped lift her from her grief, but would inform the rest of her life and her eventual rule.\n\nIn 1761, Catherine met the man who would have the most profound impact on her life, a Russian solider named Gregory Orlov. He was five years her junior and in utter thrall to her, both as a woman and as a political genius.\n\nAs ever, Peter was pleased: He had long ago fallen in love with another of Catherine’s ladies-in-waiting, Elizabeth Vorontsova, and though he usually preferred humiliating his wife, having her otherwise occupied was satisfactory, too.\n\nWhat Catherine didn’t know was that Peter was waiting, with agony and impatience, for his aunt to die. He then planned to arrest Catherine and marry Elizabeth.\n\nIt was Orlov who helped convince Catherine that she, not Peter, was meant to lead Russia. Upon the empress’ death on Christmas Day 1761, Peter assumed the throne, and Catherine took a calculated risk: She waited. She waited to see what Peter would do.\n\nHis reign, as one might expect, was an utter disaster. He unilaterally declared a peace treaty with Prussia and Austria, creating a domino effect of diplomatic crises. Since he couldn’t be king of Prussia, he decided to outfit the Russian army like the Prussian one, and soldiers were forced to swap their heavy winter coats for thin blue jackets. He became careless in commenting on his future plans to banish Catherine — held in high esteem by politicians, nobles, diplomats and soldiers — and install Elizabeth, as dumb and childish as Peter, as his consort.\n\nOrlov, who had led a whisper campaign and united the military on Catherine’s behalf, incited her to rally, and though events forced her coup d’etat sooner than she’d have liked (word had reached Peter) they executed everything according to plan. On her lover’s orders, Peter and Elizabeth were captured, and Peter, bargaining for his future with his mistress, quickly signed a document abdicating all rights and claims to the throne forever.\n\nCatherine, at her core, was a profoundly decent woman, and had Peter showed her the least kindness or even platonic affection, she quite possibly would have been happy as his consort.\n\nAs it was, however, her disastrous marriage was Russia’s great gift: Catherine modernized the country, and, beloved by her subjects, her reign is known as the nation’s Golden Age.\n\nAs for her husband, Catherine threw him in jail, and though she couldn’t help show some sympathy — allowing him his own bed from home, along with his dogs, violin and even his personal doctor — she refused his most heartfelt and repeated request: She made sure that Peter and his mistress never saw each other again."
