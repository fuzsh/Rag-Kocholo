        "text": "Catherine’s original name was Sophie Friederike Auguste von Anhalt-Zerbst. She was born on May 2, 1729, to a German prince at Stettin, Prussia (now Szczecin, Poland). When Sophie was 14 she was chosen to be the wife of a young Russian noble named Peter. He was the heir to the Russian throne.\n\nSophie was received into the Russian Orthodox church and rechristened Catherine—Ekaterina in Russian. Peter and Catherine were married in 1745. Catherine was bored and unhappy during her marriage because Peter was a rebellious and stubborn youth. Her first child, who later became Tsar Paul I, was born in 1754. In 1757 she had a daughter, Anne, who died in 1758. Another son, Alexei, was born in 1762.\n\nWhen the Russian empress Elizabeth died in December 1761, Peter became Tsar Peter III. His childish behavior and his preference for German ways made him very unpopular. Catherine, however, gained many supporters by showing her love of Russia. She also accepted Russian customs as her own. She was admired as one of the most cultured persons in Russia. Therefore, it was not difficult for Catherine to overthrow her husband and become empress. She had the support of the army, the court, and the public.\n\nOn July 9, 1762, she proclaimed herself empress. Peter III gave up the throne, and eight days later he was assassinated.\n\nCatherine dreamed of conquering the Muslim Turks of the Ottoman Empire. She wanted to take over their lands and establish a great Orthodox Christian empire centered on the city of Constantinople in what is now Turkey. During Catherine’s reign Russia fought two wars with the Ottoman Empire, from 1768 to 1774 and from 1787 to 1792. Russia won part of the northern Black Sea coast, the Crimean peninsula, and navigation rights in Turkish waters. Over the years, Russia also took over parts of other countries. By the end of Catherine’s reign Russia had expanded westward and southward over an area of more than 200,000 square miles (520,000 square kilometers).\n\nCatherine wanted to be a progressive ruler. She encouraged book publishing, journalism, architecture, and theater in Russia. She sponsored the first school for girls in Russia and also established a system of elementary schools.\n\nCatherine invested money in many other projects as well. More than a hundred new towns were built and old ones were expanded and renovated. Trade and communications developed. These achievements, combined with military glory, have won her a distinguished place in history.\n\nCatherine died on November 17, 1796. She had ruled for 34 years. Her eldest son succeeded her as Tsar Paul I."
