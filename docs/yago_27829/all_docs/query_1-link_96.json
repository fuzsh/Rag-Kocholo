This is a study of how Catherine gained her power and who helped her on her road to the throne. You will see the life of Catherine through her eyes, learn about her struggles, her challenges, her successes, and her glory. We rarely find any record of female rulers compared to men when examining the whole historical record. But it is crucial for us to know those female rulers, for what they did was worth knowing and the barriers they overcame is hard to imagine As exemplified by Catherine II, even a female feign ruler can change the social structure and boundaries of one of the largest empires in the world. In this video, you will learn about Catherine before Russia, Catherine’s marriage to Peter III, her use of friendship and love to achieve her goal, her rise to power, and her beliefs.",
