On the Empress's orders, Tarakanova is led into a trap and arrested. Because the Princess continues to insist that she is the only true heir to the throne, she quickly finds herself in great danger.\n\nAlexei saves the Czarina from conspirators and is rewarded with her love. He deserts his sweetheart Anna, but discovers that his Queen is unfaithful too.

His Cossack-Bashkir army has some success, and the people in the territory believe him to be the Czar. But the uprising is short-lived and Catherine's forces crushes his army, and he is drawn-and-quartered on the block.\n\nA toymaker in Poland specializes in building lifesize mechanical men. He builds a chess-playing \"automaton\" to hide a pretty young Polish activist who is being hunted by occupying Russian forces.\n\nMusical comedy of Cossack refugees who have been sent packing to the Ottoman empire after their fortress has been destroyed.\n\nIn 18th century Russia, the naive and idealistic lieutenant Chernov meets Empress Catherine the Great who becomes infatuated with him and appoints him Chief of the Imperial Guard.\n\nCount Orlof, one of Catherine of Russia's many overnight favourites, travels to Venice on her behalf to abduct Elizabeth Tarakanova who has been laying claim to the throne from the Crimea. Once there, he finds the local charms of the Princess hard to resist.\n\nIn 18th century Russia, Imperial officer Piotr Grinov is dispatched to a faraway isolated outpost where his loyalties are tested during the Pugachev Rebellion against the Empress Catherine II."
