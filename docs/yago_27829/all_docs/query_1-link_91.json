        "meta_description": "Catherine II (1729-1796), Empress of Russia, known as 'Catherine the Great' An exasperated letter to her former lover, Poniatowski. 1762  Autograph letter to Stanisław August Poniatowski [later King Stanisław II August of Poland], n.p., 24 November [1762]. In French. 2½ pages, 237 x 189mm, on a bifolium, autograph address panel ('Pour Le Stolnia / Cte Poniatowski'), signet seal in black wax, numbered '12' at upper right corner of p.1.  Provenance : Ira and Larry Goldberg auction, 3 December 2011, lot 63.  An exasperated letter, accusing Poniatowski of obtuseness and ingratitude, and complaining of the dangers of their clandestine correspondence.  'Well then, since we must speak quite clearly and you have resolved not to understand what I have been saying to you for the last six months, it is that if you come here you risk having both of us massacred'; she refers in exasperated tones to her strong support for him with both Kayserling [her ambassador to Poland] and Rzyzewski and to the strong influence of foreigners in Saint Petersburg, going on: 'how have I demonstrated such a horrible ingratitude, is it because I prevent you from coming here and do not at all wish it? In my opinion there is nothing to complain about, I told you that even our letters are worth nothing, nothing at all, and that if you were at all sensible you would refrain from writing them, simply giving everything concerning business to Kayserling to send me; the last courier who brought your letter to Breteuil risked his life in the hands of thieves and it would have been a fine thing if my parcel had been opened and handed in to the ministry. I have received all your letters and did not expect that after the strongest and most sincere assurances of my friendship for you and yours I would be accused of black ingratitude. You may say what you please, but I will prove to you the good will I have for your family by giving you my best support'.  From a wealthy Polish family, Stanisław Poniatowski had come to Saint Petersburg as a 22-year old diplomat in 1755, quickly becoming a lover of the future empress Catherine; their liaison continued until his departure from Russia in 1758. The present letter is most likely written in the months after the assassination of Catherine's husband, Tsar Peter III, in July 1762, which brought her to power: according to some accounts Poniatowski hoped to marry her at this period, although as can be seen here, Catherine was less than enthusiastic about his return to Saint Petersburg. Nevertheless, two years later, Catherine was to be instrumental in Poniatowski's election as King of Poland by the Polish Diet, following the death of August III.",
