        "text": "Transcript\n\nSophie Friederike Auguste von Anhalt Zerbst - this German princess's career begins in 1744. Though still a mere child, she knows what she wants to be - the Empress of Russia. She travels to a mysterious, unknown world as a potential bride of the future tsar. In a story worthy of Cinderella, the princess from humble but noble origins enters the fairytale world of the Russian imperial palaces and sets her sights on a grand future. As Catherine the Great, she would ascend the throne and become the most powerful woman in all of Europe. But her journey is a rocky one.\n\nIn her memoirs Catherine the Great would later describe her marriage with Peter von Holstein as one of constant turbulence. The alcoholic heir to the throne is said to have spent the entire day commanding toy soldiers. He is not interested in ruling, in Russia or in his wife. In the beginning she puts up with Peter's idiosyncrasies in an effort to make him her ally, a hopeless task. The young German princess decides to become her own best ally and the opponent of her husband. She converts to the Russian Orthodox faith and is christened Catherine. She becomes obsessed with learning the Russian language and applies herself to the challenge with unwavering discipline. She wants to rule, but politics and diplomacy demand patience. Catherine has to wait 20 years before she is able to conceive a plot with the Russian Imperial Guard that ultimately topples her husband Tsar Peter from the throne.\n\nCatherine ascends the Russian throne in the summer of 1762 with the help of the Russian Imperial Guard. The army and aristocracy swear allegiance to the new regent, but behind closed doors she is often referred to as an ice cold usurper. Once dethroned, Peter is taken into custody and is murdered shortly thereafter. Catherine maintained she knew nothing of the deed.\n\nThe empress had numerous lovers who supported her in ruling over the Russian empire. One of these was Prince Potyomkin, who received a castle from the empress as a gift. Catherine's rule heralded the golden age of Russia's nobility. One of the jewels of Russian imperial architecture is the Chinese Palace in Oranienbaum near St. Petersburg, Russia. Today, its halls still resonate the lifestyle of bygone tsars. Catherine was a believer in progress and education, and in her own power. She met resistance with resistance throughout her life. Catherine the Great died in 1796 in St. Petersburg at the age of 67."
