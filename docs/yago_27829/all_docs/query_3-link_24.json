        "text": "Peter III, was the main deuteragonist of The Great and the former Emperor of Russia. In \"The Great\", he marries a Princess from Prussia, who came with love for him, however, when she realises that he is a terrible ruler, Marial, Count Orlo and her start a coup d'état in order to overthrow him and establish an Enlightened Russia.\n\nPersonality[]\n\nMost of his subjects disdained him but feared what would happen to them if he died. His wife, Catherine II, hated him because of his cruelty, and his tendency to act like a brat - impulsive and spoiled. However, she later learnt to love him and was distraught at his death. He displayed psychotic tendencies and violent outbursts that were indulged by his court. This may have been in part due to the cruel treatment from his mother in childhood and the implied historic madness in royal lines.\n\nFirstly, he killed the pet bear he gave Catherine as a wedding gift for fun and continued to torture and provoke her and the court as a whole. Meanwhile he continued a war in a selfish endeavor to be better than his father with no regard for the human lives lost. However with some advice from Elizabeth he bizarrely gifts Leo as a lover to Catherine, but beats him for fulfilling this duty. When he falls for Catherine, although the feeling was unrequited, he still commits heinous acts to and for her further depicting his mad and chaotic nature.\n\nIn the final episode of the first season, Catherine attempts to begin her coup. Peter attempts to derail her, after Marial loses hope in the cause and tells him Catherine is attempting to take power and is also pregnant with his child. Peter is heart broken by this and in the resulting altercation holds a knife to her throat. In the witty confrontation Catherine states he cannot kill her or their child. Initially he states that he can get a child from anyone he is unable to bring himself to kill her and the child she is expecting, he attempts to use her lover Leo as blackmail, threatening to kill him if she tries again proving ultimately he will always underestimate Catherine's love for her country and the sacrifices she will make for her people.\n\nFamily[]\n\nTemplate:Holstein-Gottorp-Romanov-Ascania Tree\n\nTemplate:Relationships Template:Viewhistory\n\nSightings[]\n\nEpisodes[]\n\nSeries 1 Theme Tune: Absent 1. \"The Great\": Appears 6. \"Parachute\": Appears 2. \"The Beard\": Appears 7. \"A Pox on Hope\": Appears 3. \"And you Sir, are no Peter the Great\": Appears 8. \"Meatballs at the Dacha\": Appears 4. \"Moscow Mule\": Appears 9. \"Love Hurts\": Appears 5. \"War and Vomit\": Appears 10. \"The Beaver's Nose\": Appears\n\nGalleries\n\nReferences[]\n\n↑ As of 1761\n\nTemplate:Characters"
