        "text": "Day three - our final day here in St. Petersburg - and we are off to see Catherine The Great's Palace.\n\nCatherine the Great was not a Russian by birth but married into the royal family. Her husband [Peter III](Peter III of Russia) was a dimwit and she had him overthrown and ultimately killed. Peter III was a grandson of Peter the Great - founder of St. Petersburg.\n\nHere we are again. It's a bit overcast and cool this morning but it'll improve soon.\n\nTerri and Irine outside the palace waiting for our driver Yuri.\n\nNext Irine took us on a subway ride. The subways of St. Petersburg are famous for their opulence.\n\nMarble walls and columns, crystal chandeliers, tile floors.\n\nA couple shots.\n\nThe columns in the shot below are covered with carved glass.\n\nOur final stop of the day was the Peter and Paul Fortress. This is the original site of St. Petersburg. It's Peter the great's first construction site.\n\nThe fortress is in the background.\n\nTesting my new camera's zoom abilities again.\n\nThe cathedral at the fortress.\n\nAll royals since Peter the Great are buried in this cathedral. They are buried toward the front as their belief was that the closer they were to the religious icons the better place they would get in heaven. What kooks!\n\nAnd this is the burial place of the last Tzar and his family who were murdered by the bolsheviks in 1918. It is not close to the front - it is at the very back REASON: the Tzar seeing all the bad stuff that was about to happen had abdicated the throne before he and his family were taken by the bolsheviks. So, at the time of his death he was no longer royalty - hence - no room at the front for you pal.\n\nThis link will show you some of the other tombs.\n\nThat's it for day 3. Back to the ship for a few cocktails."
