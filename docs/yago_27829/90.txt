Peter III

Peter IIIÂ (1728Â â 1762) was emperorÂ of RussiaÂ for six months in 1762. It was his aunt, Empress Elizabeth, unmarried and childless, that chose him as her successor. Young Peter of Holstein-Gottorp lost his mother, Elizabeth's sister Anna, at three months old and his father at the age of eleven. Elizabeth invited her young nephew to Saint Petersburg, where he was received into the Orthodox Church and proclaimed heir in 1742. Empress Elizabeth arranged for Peter to marry his second cousin, Sophia Augusta Frederica (later Catherine the Great). The young princess formally converted to Russian Orthodoxy and took the name Ekaterina Alexeievna (Catherine). They married in 1745 but the marriage was not happy. The traditionally held view of Peter as a person of weak character and many vices is mainly drawn from the memoirs of his wife and successor. She described him in extremely negative terms and this image of Peter have dominated in historical works although some recent biographers painted a more positive picture of Peter's character and Â rule.

Peter III's temperament became quite unbearable for those who resided in the palace. He would announce trying drills in the morning to male servants, who later joined Catherine in her room to sing and dance until late hours.Â Catherine became pregnant with her second child, Anna, who only lived to four months, in 1759. Due to various rumors of Catherine's promiscuity, Peter was led to believe he was not the child's biological father but Catherine angrily dismissed his accusation. She thus spent much of this time alone in her own private boudoir to hide away from Peter's abrasive personality.

Reign

After Peter succeeded to the Russian throne, the pro-Prussian emperorÂ withdrew Russian forces from the Seven Years' War and concluded a peace treaty with Prussia - an event known as the Second Miracle of the House of Brandenburg (sometimes as simply the Miracle of the House of Brandenburg, which also refers to another surprising development during the Seven Years' War, when RussiaÂ and Austria failed to follow up their victory over Frederick the Great at the Battle of KunersdorfÂ in 1759). He gave up Russian conquests in Prussia and offered 12,000 troops to make an alliance with Frederick the Great (1762). Russia thus switched from an enemy of Prussia to an ally â Russian troops withdrew from Berlin and marched against the Austrians. This dramatically shifted the balance of power in Europe. Frederick recaptured southern Silesia and subsequently forced Austria to the negotiating table. The decision proved to be extremely unpopular in his own court Russia and greatly contributed to Peter's quick demise.Â

As Duke of Holstein-Gottorp, Peter planned war against Denmark in order to restore parts of Schleswig to his Duchy. He focused on making alliances with Sweden and with England to ensure that they would not interfere on Denmark's behalf, while Russian forces gathered at Kolberg in Russian-occupied Pomerania. Alarmed at the Russian troops concentrating near their borders, unable to find any allies to resist Russian aggression, and short of money to fund a war, the government of Denmark threatened in late June to invade the free city of Hamburg in northern Germany to force a loan from it. Peter considered this a casus belli and prepared for open warfare against Denmark but he lost his throne before starting the war.

One of Peter's most widely debated reforms was a manifesto that exempted the nobility from obligatory state and military service (established by Peter the Great) and gave them freedom to travel abroad. The manifesto obliged nobles to educate their children and ostracized the nobility considered lazy and unproductive. Although the exemption from the obligatory service was welcomed by the Russian elites, Â the overall reform did not convince them to support their emperor, who was generally considered as taking little interest in Russia and its matters. A case of Peter's religious policies serves as a demonstrative example of how the pro-Prussian emperor was perceived in Russia. His pro-Lutheran stand has been interpreted by some recent biographers as the introduction of religious freedom, while Peter's contemporaries (and many historians) saw it as an anti-Orthodox attitude proving Peter's lack of understanding of his own empire.
