        "text": "Wessley M. Baker Aguilar has two surnames and blames his Spanish mother and Greek/English father. Born in Turkey but raised in Greece, you should never ask him where he’s from, as you’ll get a different answer every time. After working across various industries, from manufacturing to entertainment, Wessley finally realized his calling, Hospitality and Luxury Travel at Sea. Taking with him many years of experience in sales and business development, Wessley is now the Senior Charter Manager for Marvel Yachts Ltd. He is passionate about creating personalized yacht charter vacations and enjoys telling new clients why they can’t start their cruise in Athens, go to Mykonos, then Bodrum, make a “quick stop” in Kefalonia and return to Athens in seven days. In early 2016 and after a good charter season, Wessley got bored and a little depressed. As a result, he decided to start an online Digital Marketing course at the University of Illinois Urbana Campaign. He completed it successfully just as his first clients, for the new season, were about to board their plane to Greece. Wessley is highly skilled in cultivating strategic partnerships as well as client acquisitions with a high degree of retention. An out-of-the-box creative thinker, with his fair share of failures, Wessley is always eager to lend a helping hand.\n\nDr. Boretou is a Strategy & Transformation Advisor with more than 20 years of professional experience in creating value for the private and public sector through DESIGN THINKING, BUSINESS MODELS, ENTREPRENEURSHIP, και TRANSFORMATION (incl.
