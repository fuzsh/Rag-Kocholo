        "text": "Currently working remotely from Patras for a Silicon Valley company in Sunnyvale, California, leading the QA effort of the 5G network slicing product. I enjoy travelling with the family, cooking and watching movies.\n\nAt the age of 14 I started reading PIXEL, a Greek computer magazine with lots of code listings for Amiga, ATARI ST and Amstrad 6128. After buying my first PC at the same age I started experimenting with modem communications so I launched one of the two BBSs in Patras. I got somehow access to a UNIX terminal server at the local university and started playing with bash since then. It was very difficult to find information in general, all you had to read were the manpages of the commands.\n\nIn 1996 I joined the Informatics Engineering department of the University of West Attica. Enjoyed a lot all the computer programming labs with different programming languages, even with Assembly for 8088 microprocessors.\n\nAfter two years I started working (in part time basis) as an IT support engineer in H.O.Tech in order to support my monthly expenses as an undergraduate student. After that I applied for an internship in the Network Operations Center of the University where I got accepted. I remember I had a nice first touch with some UNIX systems and the network services they run in order to support the campus.\n\nIn 1999 the software development as a profession journey starts when got accepted in Intracom S.A. in Patras as an AXE (Ericsson telecom centers) design engineer. Unfortunately this tech and the tools did not attract me at all so I asked to join another team. The management team was very supportive to my decision and they subcontracted me to Stockholm in Ericsson Telecom AB, where IP Telephony product was developed that period (C++, Java developer and a bit of systems engineering). The goal was to bring the know-how to Patras branch. So I did, and for almost a year I worked in Sweden and Norway for Ericsson Telecom in 2000.\n\nIn 2001 I got accepted in a Masterâ€™s postgraduate program of the Mathematics Department at the University of Patras. Unfortunately the program required from the students to attend morning classes, so I had to quit because my full time job did not provide flexible work hours.\n\nAfter 6 months of attending the MSc and working as a part time computer science instructor I joined a startup called Daedalus Networks, Ltd. which consisted of 3 co-founders and 1 employee. Working from home the first period and from their offices since 2003. This was actually the start of a long adventure for my life and the company. I completed my MSc studies, I got married and also fulfilled my military obligations.\n\nThe company got acquired by Bytemobile, Inc a Silicon Valley company. As the years passed I was working with many engineers from Silicon Valley, led and built many teams in Patras. In 2012 Bytemobile got acquired by Citrix Systems and Patras branch was continuing to grow. I had acquired so many experiences, both technical and non-technical that I felt very lucky for the decisions I took by then.\n\nAfter 14 years in that company, in 2016 I decided to move on a remote working adventure, from my home office, and started acquiring different skills. Worked for ~5years for ZuluTrade Technologies, a small fintech company in Piraeus, Greece, where engineering is very close to the customers.\n\nSince 2005 until today I have been working for side projects from time to time.\n\nFor me working life is directly connected with my real life, and I strongly believe that this journey should make you and your family happy from all aspects ðŸ˜‰"
