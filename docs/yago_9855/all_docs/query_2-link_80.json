        "text": "“Santa Clarita Diet” isn’t getting a fourth season. Less than a month after the zombie-themed sitcom’s third season launched, Netflix has canceled the show starring Drew Barrymore and Timothy Olyphant.\n\n“Like our audience, we were all-in on Sheila and Joel. Their relationship, in the face of incredible adversity, was inspiring to write and to watch. Mostly, they were funny, which in a comedy is important,” creator and executive producer Victor Fresco and executive producer Tracy Katsky said in a joint statement. “Working with Drew and Tim, along with the immensely talented Liv and Skyler, was a joy and a once in a lifetime experience.”\n\n“Netflix took a chance on this odd show and for that we will always be grateful. They were supportive, ever positive, and appreciative of our work. Until about noon today. Still, they were just one phone call away from being a perfect studio. Not bad,” they continued. “Everything ends. This was a thing. And so it ended. We’ll miss it but are proud of the work we did and will always appreciate the love and enthusiasm we felt from our audience. It if was up to them, Sheila and Joel would continue for another 10,000 years.”\n\n“Of all of the characters I’ve ever been, Sheila Hammond is one of my favorites. She and Joel were an amazing couple, who had shared goals,” said Barrymore. “And I am lucky to have worked along side Tim Olyphant. It was an honor to get to do something so delightful. Sheila lives forever in me. And I am grateful to Victor Fresco, who created a world so unique.”\n\n“I loved working on this show. I’m going to continue coming in and doing scenes. If they don’t want to film it, that’s up to them,” Olyphant said.\n\nIn its own statement, Netflix said: “The world had never known a ‘zom-com’ until ‘Santa Clarita Diet,’ and we’re indebted to creator Victor Fresco for bringing this idea to Netflix. To their endless credit, the incredible Drew Barrymore and Timothy Olyphant were totally game, with an uncanny knack for comedy that brought Sheila and Joel Hammond to vibrant life, even though one of them was undead. We’re grateful to Victor, Drew, and Timothy, along with fellow executive producers Tracy Katsky, Aaron Kaplan, Chris Miller and Ember Truesdell and the terrific cast, including Liv Hewson and Skyler Gisondo, and crew for three hilarious seasons for Netflix members to discover for years to come.”"
