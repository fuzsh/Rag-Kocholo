        "text": "When Patrick Stewart took the stage at Star Trek Las Vegas in August 2018 and told a surprised convention audience about his return as Jean-Luc Picard in a forthcoming show (which would eventually be named Star Trek Picard), he and Alex Kurtzman were very careful in establishing the boundaries. This was not going to be a show based on nostalgia. This was not going to be backwards looking. This was going to Say Important Things about today, about our current world, about Brexit and about xenophobia. This, above all, was not going to be Star Trek: The Next Generation season eight.\n\nFlash forward to the end of season three of Star Trek Picard where the final episode is mostly set on the bridge of a rebuilt Enterprise-D featuring the movie-era TNG cast playing older but familiar versions of their characters. I really wish we lived in a world without non-disclosure agreements because… what happened? How did we get from point A to point B within four years?"
