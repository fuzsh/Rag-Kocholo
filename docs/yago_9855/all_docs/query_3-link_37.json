        "text": "Showbiz Today\n\nEntertainment Industry Flourishes in Little Saigon; Broadway Revives 'The Music Man'; Travis Brings Scottish Sounds to U.S.\n\nAired April 26, 2000 - 4:30 p.m. ET\n\nTHIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.\n\nLAURIN SYDNEY, CO-HOST: Hi, everybody. I'm Laurin Sydney in New York. Jim Moret is in Hollywood.\n\nChristopher Reeve is on Capitol Hill, pleading for controversial medical research. He testified before a Senate subcommittee today, urging government support for research into stem cells from human embryos. Some people object to that on ethical grounds. But Reeve says the cells could one day cure diseases like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, and heal spinal cord injuries.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nCHRISTOPHER REEVE: They've been called the body's self-repair kit, and their extraordinary potential is a recent discovery, and much basic research needs to be done before they can be sent to the frontlines in the battle against diseases, but no obstacle should stand in the way of responsible investigation into the possibilities.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nJIM MORET, CO-HOST: The government is keeping an eye on Hollywood's hiring practices. Labor Secretary Alexis Herman took part in a discussion with the major guilds today, supporting efforts to increase diversity in front of and behind the cameras. The studios were invited to attend, but declined. The networks recently signed agreements promising to increase minority participation.\n\nThere's plenty of diversity in Southern California, including an area know as \"Little Saigon.\" A quarter century after the fall of Saigon, the L.A. version is home to a thriving Vietnamese community.\n\nGloria Hillard discovered that's it also the site of a mini entertainment empire.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\n\nGLORIA HILLARD, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): It's just an hour south of Los Angeles, a place called Little Saigon, an intersection of East meets West in strip malls with plastic signs and shops, and on every block, the sound of music. Twenty-five years after the fall of Saigon, this area has become not only home to the largest Vietnamese community in the United States, but to a flourishing entertainment industry. Asia Productions has signed more than a dozen musical artists, singers, like Le Tam and Lam Tien. Both were born in Vietnam but grew up here.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: I would love to be an actor.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: We do music videos and stuff, and we try to get a little acting going on.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nHILLARD: They call Lam Tien the Vietnamese Ricky Martin. And maybe one day they, too, will be discovered and become Hollywood stars.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Oh, of course. We'd love to.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: You know, That's our dream.\n\nHILLARD: Deejay Viet Dzung came here 25 years ago, a boat refugee. His radio program is broadcast in three cities, aimed at two generations, the older non-English-speaking Vietnamese-Americans and their children.\n\nVIET DZUNG, RADIO BOLSA: They want to join the mainstream on all the activities, including music and film.\n\nHILLARD: Actress Kieu Chinh was on one of the last flights out of Saigon. She is probably best known for her role in \"The Joy Luck Club.\" Chinh says most of the movies that have been made about Vietnam have dealt with the war, films like \"Platoon.\"\n\nKIEU CHINH, ACTRESS: Not many of them is talking on the point of view of the Vietnamese and about the people. I put all my hope on this young generation.\n\nHILLARD: Like Vietnamese filmmaker Tony Bui. His film, \"Three Seasons\" was a big winner at Sundance last year.\n\nTONY BUI, DIRECTOR, \"THREE SEASONS\": Having grown up in America, even though I was born in Vietnam, I never read or learned about Vietnam the way saw it when I ended going there when I was 19 years old for the first time.\n\nCHINH: After 25 years. the Vietnam War over, and there are still many, many stories to be told.\n\nHILLARD: The sounds of \"Little Saigon\" tell a story: the sounds of the future and the past.\n\nGloria Hillard, CNN, Westminster, California.\n\n(END VIDEOTAPE)\n\nMORET: Director Mike Figgis has movie studios looking toward the future with his new film, \"Timecode.\" He shot his project on digital tape in just nine days, the first production of its kind to get major studio backing.\n\nDennis Michael spoke with the digital director.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\n\nMIKE FIGGIS, DIRECTOR: All right, 25 seconds away.\n\nDENNIS MICHAEL, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Filmmaker Mike Figgis is challenging the basic grammar of moviemaking with \"Timecode.\"\n\nFIGGIS: I think it's important that the medium challenge itself from time to time and come up with a new language, and that's really what I'm interested in, I suppose.\n\nMICHAEL: The structure for \"Timecode\" was dictated by the tools used to make it. Four new high-definition video cameras and a team of game actors took on a brand new way to make, and watch, a movie.\n\nFIGGIS: Once the action starts, all four cameras that are going to start off about four miles apart, are going to get into various things -- cars, they're going to walk, and they're all going to end up in the same location. So by the time we get to, say, minute 85 in this continual narrative, all of the cameras are within, say, 200 yards of each other, and the actors are getting closer and closer, and the drama begins to becomes more claustrophobic in that sense, and culminates in some form of an ending just before the tape runs out.\n\nMICHAEL: And since the tape cartridge each of the four cameras holds 93 minutes, in the end, there will be four films running simultaneously, each 93 minutes long, running in real time. No editing. Kyle MacLachlan and Julian Sands were among the daring cast members.\n\nJULIAN SANDS, ACTOR: When he explained it, I think I did have to say, you know, could you say that again, Mike? You know, and he explained the four screens. He called it cubist filmmaking. Once you get the concept, then it becomes very accessible.\n\nMICHAEL: Accessible, but not easily achievable. In fact, they threw out the moviemaking rulebook entirely and made the movie start to finish 15 times, sometimes twice in a day.\n\nKYLE MACLACHLAN, ACTOR: We were able to watch each take or each -- I guess it was a take, because there was no cutting, each day, so we would film, say, in the morning, and we would look at it in the afternoon, immediately, the entire thing.\n\nMICHAEL: The director didn't have a script, but something resembling a musical score to keep the story lines synchronized. Sound requirements were astonishingly complicated, but the result is a unique film. Figgis does not say, someday all films will be made this way.\n\nFIGGIS: I urge you not to try this at home or anywhere else. You know, make up your own rules for a film and do it your own way. MICHAEL: And if there is a lesson about the future of film in \"Timecode,\" that's it.\n\nDennis Michael, CNN Entertainment News, Hollywood.\n\n(END VIDEOTAPE)\n\nSYDNEY: Coming up, celebrity friends salute Al Pacino in New York, and Craig Bierko has found trouble in Broadway's revival of \"The Music Man.\"\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nSYDNEY: Al Pacino was the toast of New York Tuesday night, when celebrity friends came out to honor the actor. Pacino, who grew up in the south Bronx, was honored by the Film Society of Lincoln Center for a movie career that has earned the actor eight Academy Award nominations. Chris O'Donnell, who co-starred with Pacino in \"Scent of a Woman,\" says it's no secret why Pacino ended up winning a best actor Oscar for his work on that film.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nCHRIS O'DONNELL, ACTOR: Naturally, he's a tremendous actor, but he works as hard if not harder than any actor I've ever worked with and I think people think, someone like Al Pacino it just comes naturally to him. The guy is constantly perfecting what he does and he sits in his dressing room all day long just working on the character. It's pretty amazing the stuff he comes up with.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nSYDNEY: Now, I guess Scott Caan can kind of call Al Pacino his uncle. I mean, after all, his father, James Caan, played Pacino's brother in \"The Godfather.\" OK, a little bit of a stretch. But the younger Caan does have a lot going for him, even if he's not related to Pacino.\n\nLori Blackman reports that Scott Caan is a SHOWBIZ TODAY star of tomorrow.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\n\nSCOTT CAAN, ACTOR: If you can do something in life and make money and enjoy what you do, you've won, you know.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP, \"VARSITY BLUES\")\n\nCAAN: Hit me baby one more time.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nCAAN: Just like be a good human being and play the game, you know. You've got to play the game.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP, \"VARSITY BLUES\") CAAN: Want to see the new Tweeter end zone dance? Check it out.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nLORI BLACKMAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (on camera): One year ago, you had your big breakthrough role in \"Varsity Blues,\" and I was told that your nude scene in that film was you just taking off your clothes.\n\nCAAN: I actually -- I called the director the night before and I was reading over the scene, and because I always wear the cowboy hat in the movie, I said, \"set it up so when I get out of the car, I will just cover myself up with the cowboy hat.\" He's like, \"OK, we'll try it.\"\n\nBLACKMAN: And you weren't self-conscious at all, were you?\n\nCAAN: No. I got a good *ss. I am naked in \"Ready to Rumble,\" too. I think being naked on-screen is really cool because there is no guards up and it drops everything and you are just kind of being in the moment.\n\nBLACKMAN: You sold a script called \"Chasing The Party: How Hugh Hefner Saved My Life\"...\n\nCAAN: Yes.\n\nBLACKMAN: ... for -- tell me if this is accurate -- for half-a- million dollars?\n\nCAAN: Yes. That whole world I think like I grew up like wanting to be a part of, and I think that like everyone can relate to wanting to get into a party at the Playboy mansion. I mean, it's like with acting and writing, it's like you can't write what is not you, you know what I mean, or what you don't know. Like in \"Boiler Room,\" you know, it's like I am the angry guy who beats people up. I am like, that is not me, but I used to be like that, or there is a part of me that wants to beat people up.\n\nBLACKMAN: So what kind of an influence was it having James Caan as a father? What kind of influence did that have on your decision to become an actor? Did it have any?\n\nCAAN: No. He like made me like the human being that I am today, but didn't really influence me in my work at all. I can't tell you whose life I'd like, but as far as a career, you know, I think Duvall. You know, I just did \"Gone in 60 Seconds\" with him and, you know, he has been doing movies for 30-something years and he is still like, this scene is going to be great, and you know, he is still excited about it, and I think if you loose that, then it's no -- you know, it's not fun anymore.\n\nBLACKMAN: Lori Blackman, CNN Entertainment News, New York.\n\n(END VIDEOTAPE)\n\nSYDNEY: Still to come, May sweeps is around the corner. Find out what the small screen has to offer. And the Scottish band Travis sets their sights on the U.S.\n\nLegendary comic Carol Burnett celebrates her 67th birthday Wednesday. A royal salute to \"The King of Queens'\" Kevin James, he's 35. And Tionne Watkins, the \"T\" in TLC is no scrub at 30 years of age.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nMORET: Well, the fight for ratings intensifies as \"Who Wants to be a Millionaire\" takes on two powerhouse contenders. ABC is putting the popular quiz show up against CBS newsmagazine \"60 Minutes\" this Sunday, as part of its May sweeps strategy. And it will air an hour- long behind-the-scenes look at \"Millionaire\" opposite NBC's season finale of \"E.R.\" in three weeks.\n\nDespite poor ratings, the ABC series \"Sports Night\" is going into overtime. The network will air a two-part season finale during the May sweeps period. The show had been sidelined, with no original episodes of \"Sports Night\" airing since the beginning of April. It's still unclear if ABC will renew \"Sports Night\" for next season.\n\nCall it \"Ally McBeal: The Musical.\" Cast members of the Fox show will be carrying tunes during a full-fledged musical version for \"Ally\"'s season finale. A notable mention: the episode will feature songs by Randy Newman, including a tune written just for the show.\n\nSYDNEY: The most successful producer in the history of Broadway has died. David Merrick was responsible for such Broadway hits as \"State Fair,\" \"42nd Street,\" \"Gypsy,\" and \"Hello, Dolly.\" Merrick died in his sleep in a London rest home early Tuesday. He was 88.\n\nVeteran stage and screen actor Jerry Orbach who appeared in Merrick's \"42nd Street\" remembers the producer.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nJERRY ORBACH, ACTOR: He was a real Type A personality, he was a very, very tough guy to work for, it was his way or the highway, you know, and a show was really his vision, you know, he didn't brook to many arguments from people.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nSYDNEY: There is trouble in River City and Craig Bierko is heading to Broadway to fix it. Actually, the actor is making his Broadway debut in the revival of \"The Music Man.\"\n\nAs Cynthia Tornquist reports, the actor had some very big shoes to fill.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\n\nCYNTHIA TORNQUIST, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Meredith Wilson's \"The Music Man\" has been a staple of community theaters and high schools since it debuted on Broadway in 1957. Robert Preston originated the role of Professor Harold Hill and repeated it in the 1962 movie. It seems every aspiring actor has played the role since. That is, everyone except Craig Bierko.\n\nCRAIG BIERKO, ACTOR: I'm the last man in America who hasn't played this role, so this is more of a legal obligation than anything else.\n\nTORNQUIST: If Bierko looks familiar, you may have seen him in the films \"The 13th Floor\" or \"The Long Kiss Goodnight.\"\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP, \"THE LONG KISS GOODNIGHT\")\n\nBIERKO: Sorry to keep you waiting.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED ACTOR: For you, Tim, always a pleasure to wait.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nTORNQUIST: Bierko landed the role, even though the producers intended to cast it with an actor with a much bigger name.\n\nMICHAEL DAVID, PRODUCER: This is a role that I think requires you to look everywhere, and we did, from Travoltas to Martins to whatever, and in the end, I think for all sorts of reasons this guy came five times from California, and each time he did it we'd all look at each other and go, God, this is the guy.\n\nTORNQUIST: Bierko's co-star, Rebecca Luker, plays Marian the librarian.\n\nREBECCA LUKER, ACTRESS: People started to think, you know, a new -- a fresh face for Harold Hill, and he, as it turns out, has a lot of magic about him I think.\n\nTORNQUIST: If you listen to Bierko, he sounds an awful lot like Robert Preston.\n\n(MUSIC)\n\nBut why bring a musical back to Broadway that has probably been performed in countless dinner theaters across the United States?\n\nDAVID: It's not been here in 43 years, so I think the easy answer is there is more than a generation of people who've never seen this before.\n\nTORNQUIST: Actually, they've added a lot that never appeared in the original production.\n\nSUSAN STROMAN, DIRECTOR/CHOREOGRAPHER: My role in it is bringing dance to \"Music Man,\" a little bit more dance than is normally seen in \"Music Man.\"\n\nBIERKO: When I was offered this role, she said there will be very sort of light dancing, don't worry about that, don't worry about that, and I've come in and that's, you know, basically all we've been doing.\n\nTORNQUIST: Not only does Bierko have to fill Robert Preston's shoes, he has to dance in them, too.\n\nCynthia Tornquist, CNN Entertainment News, New York.\n\n(END VIDEOTAPE)\n\nSYDNEY: Tomorrow on SHOWBIZ TODAY, the '70s are re-examined in a new miniseries, and Kevin Spacey and Danny DeVito reteam on the big screen in \"The Big Kahuna.\"\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nMORET: Rap star Dr. Dre is accusing Napster of stealing his music. He's the latest artist to sue the Web company, which makes software that allows people to download copyrighted music for free. Dre says Napster is engaged in large-scale piracy. The heavy metal group Metallica and the Recording Industry Association of America are also suing Napster.\n\nSYDNEY: Now, Jim, in case you wondered, you can actually search through Napster for \"The Man Who.\"\n\nMORET: The man who what -- knew too much?\n\nSYDNEY: No, just \"The Man Who.\" This stuff works better when we're together. That's the name of the hit album from the band called Travis.\n\nI see you agree with me.\n\nMORET: I do agree with you.\n\nPaul Vercammen is the man who talked with Travis about their success.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\n\nPAUL VERCAMMEN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): With a deluge of sensitive melodic tunes, Travis strummed out 1999's No. 1 selling record in Great Britain.\n\nIt may seem the quartet came from out of nowhere, but they're from Scotland. Travis' \"The Man Who\" was also voted album of the year by several British critics and has just been released in the United States, where American ears find Travis' accents as thick as the morning fog.\n\nFRAN HEALY, MUSICIAN: The other night in Portland -- was it Portland?...\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes.\n\nHEALY: ... I was talking before a song, and we had this guy going, \"Speak in American.\"\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nAnd I was like -- and I had to introduce -- and so I introduced the whole song in an American accent, and then he understood it then.\n\nVERCAMMEN: This is the band's second record. Travis formed in 1996, and bad weather drove them to thinking and playing.\n\nHEALY: It rains a lot, so you sort of -- you're in your house a lot and you've got a lot of free time. And so you can end up doing something that's not, you know, an outdoor task. You know, it's always (UNINTELLIGIBLE) sitting with a guitar on your knee.\n\nVERCAMMEN: The members of Travis are proud of their roots, but you won't hear them chant, \"If it's not Scottish, it's crud.\"\n\nNEIL PRIMROSE, MUSICIAN: Music doesn't have any geography. You know, you don't sort of hold up a banner and say, we're Scottish. You travel all around. Music is for everyone in every country.\n\nVERCAMMEN: Travis frontman Fran Healy has a voice like a songbird and a small crest atop his head like a woodpecker's. The haircut, called a fin, helped start a UK fad.\n\nHEALY: Now there's like millions of people going about with that haircut. You know, just because I'm on the tele, everybody's like, it's his haircut.\n\nVERCAMMEN: And clearly, the haircut alone didn't inspire almost 2 million Europeans to buy Travis records.\n\nPaul Vercammen, CNN Entertainment News, Hollywood.\n\n(END VIDEOTAPE)\n\nSYDNEY: And I think that Jim should try that soon. Anyway, we're out of time for now, but won't you please join us tomorrow for the very latest in entertainment news? And until tomorrow, in New York, I'm Laurin Sydney.\n\nMORET: In Hollywood, I'm Jim Moret. Thank you for watching. We'll see you next time.\n\nTO ORDER A VIDEO OF THIS TRANSCRIPT, PLEASE CALL 800-CNN-NEWS OR USE OUR SECURE ONLINE ORDER FORM LOCATED AT www.fdch.com"
