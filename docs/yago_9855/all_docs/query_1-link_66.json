        "text": "''Three Seasons'' is a wistful, rain-streaked elegy for a Vietnamese culture that is being swept away on the flood-tide of globalization. Too tender-hearted and lyrical to deliver a political indictment, this touching film, which was chosen best dramatic feature at the Sundance Film Festival in January, is a dreamy cinematic poem whose interwoven voices offer different variations of the same sad story.\n\nIn that story, the gentle, common folk of Saigon are being left behind as an emerging, hard-edged international culture symbolized by Coca-Cola signs, luxury hotels and the peddling of plastic lotus blossoms on the streets takes over the city. One of many symbols of bald commercialization is a popular hangout once frequented by American servicemen that is now vulgarly named the Apocalypse Now Bar.\n\n''Three Seasons'' is the first feature film by Tony Bui, a 26-year-old director who escaped from Vietnam with his parents when he was 2 years old and grew up in California. After returning to his native country for a visit when he was 19, he became fluent in Vietnamese and went back to make a short film, ''Yellow Lotus.'' Filmed in Saigon with a cast of Vietnamese actors, ''Three Seasons'' portrays the Vietnamese capital as a city of dissolving pastel colors, and the diffused palette reinforces the film's romanticized vision of a world melting away under warm tropical rains.\n\nAll four of the film's principal characters are viewed as innocent, struggling victims of economic forces beyond their control. The opening scenes introduce us to Kien An (Nguyen Ngoc Hiep), the latest recruit in an all-female work force hired to pick white lotus blossoms on the temple estate of a reclusive boss. After gathering their crop, the women are bused to Saigon, where they sell baskets of flowers on the streets. Business is good until one day Kien An suddenly finds herself competing with vendors of plastic, artificially scented imitations of the real thing.\n\nSummoned by her mysterious employer, who has heard her singing a work song that transports him back to his childhood, Kien An discovers an embittered poet dying of leprosy. This once handsome man whose face is decomposing is the film's most jarring symbol of a traditional culture being pushed into the shadows.\n\nAnother strand of the story follows Hai (Don Duong), a cyclo driver who falls in love with Lan (Zoe Bui), an imperious Vietnamese prostitute. Hai assiduously courts her by offering her free rides from the luxury hotels in which she plies her trade. Lan scornfully accepts his transportation until the day he reaps a windfall from winning a taxi race and purchases her professional time. Beneath her hard, high-fashion exterior, he discovers a frightened, alienated woman awash in shame and confusion.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
