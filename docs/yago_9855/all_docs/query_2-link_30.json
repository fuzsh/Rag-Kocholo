        "text": "USA won’t be returning to Graceland.\n\nThe Jeff Eastin-created crime drama has been canceled after three seasons, The Hollywood Reporter has learned.\n\nStarring Aaron Tveit and Daniel Sunjata, Graceland centered on a group of undercover FBI, DEA and ICE agents living together in a Southern California beach house. A source tells THR that while the network was happy with the series creatively, the show’s ratings didn’t financially justify a renewal. The Sept. 17 finale drew 913,000 viewers and a 0.33 rating in the adults 18-49 demo.\n\nIn an interview last month with THR, Eastin said he was “fairly hopeful” about a fourth season. “Our numbers keep creeping up; I’m very happy about that,” he said.\n\nsee where we take it,” creator Jeff Eastin tells THR.”]\n\nGraceland marked the second collaboration between USA and Eastin, who created the Matt Bomer-led White Collar, which wrapped its six-season run in December. The darker and heavily serialized Graceland was one of USA’s first attempts to move away from its more procedural, “blue skies” programming. That shift has led to newer content like the infidelity drama Satisfaction and the hacker series Mr. Robot.\n\nFrom Fox 21 Television Studios, Graceland represented one of the few outside original productions on USA’s lineup. In August, the network canceled the freshman medical drama Complications, which was also produced by Fox 21 and also hailed from a USA Network veteran — Burn Notice creator Matt Nix. The network and the studio are currently collaborating on the upcoming drug cartel thriller Queen of the South.\n\nThe lone USA original series still awaiting renewal is the sophomore comedy Playing House."
