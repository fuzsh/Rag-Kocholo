        "text": "Bui's perspective as an immigrant may be the one thing that has kept him from cloning the sensibility of so many film-school grads. I ask if he faced much prejudice growing up. \"You know, it's funny,\" he says, without laughing. \"I heard all the different comments as a kid, all the 'gook' comments. But you know what? I think this says a lot about my household or the Vietnamese mentality, that I never used that as an excuse.\n\n\"Obviously, racism used to come up all the time in this country. There was plenty of teasing on the buses when I first came over. But just as obviously, I never felt like it hindered me or held me down. I never felt I couldn't do what I wanted to. ... My mom always would say, 'If someone else can do it, you can do it too.' Because of that, I never thought that I was weighed down because I was different, and now I find the obstacles were a strength.\"\n\nMemory's Child: Zoe Bui in a languid moment of repose.\n\nVIETNAM IS ONE of the poorest countries on the globe. Its film industry supports eight or nine shot-on-film projects a year, supplemented with \"instant-noodle movies,\" made on tape and exhibited quickly either on local television or at the remaining movie theaters in Vietnam (most of which are equipped with video screens instead of projectors).\n\nBui borrowed the necessary technical equipment from a Canadian company making a film in Vietnam. As he worked, Bui had government censors watching him, putting their seal on every reel he shot. Yet he's brought back a story in which crime and poverty figure.\n\nThree Seasons exists outside the context of the war. Though the war is touched upon by Keitel's presence, he's really peripheral to the story. Visitors report that Vietnam has more pressing problems than its memories of the war; much of the rubble of that war has been turned into macabre tourist attractions. Where the conflict persists, really, is here in America, among the communities of expatriates.\n\nThough Bui has traveled to Vietnam many times, Bui's father hasn't been back to Vietnam since their trip together. \"My father was actually kind of upset, asking me why I wanted to go back to Vietnam so much,\" Bui says. \"It's very tough. I understand my father's point of view. This was the land where he fought. But I see loss on both sides. We're from the south, and we had to escape. But I understand what happened in the north as well, the ideology and the anticolonialist movement.\"\n\nThree Seasons contrasts traditional ways of life with westernized development. Since the country opened to westerners, it's changed rapidly; luxury hotels are shooting up in neighborhoods full of people who can barely afford to stand in the shadows of these skyscrapers. The film ends with a demonstration of ritual healing and purification: the prostitute is cured of a fever with a folk medicine practice in which the skin is scraped with the dull edge of a spoon, a traditional healing technique called \"cau dong,\" which supposedly draws out toxins.\n\nIt's a loaded scene--perhaps the center of the film. It suggests that Three Seasons is made as a protest against the poisonous qualities of money frenzy and development that are rolling over Vietnam. Still, while Bui criticizes the gap between the rich and the poor in Vietnam, he also romanticizes rural life. Who, living in a city (Bui is a New Yorker now), can help romanticizing the farm?\n\nHe captures the radiant colors of this verdant country, but he's drinking in the views--it's as if he is too polite as a visitor to have an attitude toward what he's seeing. When Bui leaves the city for the rural episode, the film slows fatally. The metaphorical poetry Dao writes brings out an aggravating point: \"My heart has transcended over the bondage of man.\" But what about the bondage of those girls working on his lotus plantation?\n\nIt's strange that Three Seasons is most earthy when it's away from the earth. Bui's city scenes aren't as pretty as the lotus lakes he's photographed so beautifully, but they have the most drama and strength.\n\nBui has integrity, and a real eye; either is far more than most filmmakers have at 26. If he can develop a more rigorous approach to drama, ideas and acting, he'll fulfill his considerable promise. Bui is already busy on the follow-up project, a film set in Hong Kong, which will not, he stresses, be about Vietnam. He's also producing his brother's upcoming film, about the experience of South Vietnamese émigrés in the American refugee camps.\n\nUltimately, the language and landscapes of Vietnam in Three Seasons may be enough for viewers who, like Bui, haven't forgotten their homeland. You can see that it must be an unhealable wound for them. Despite the poverty, Vietnam has, in Bui's camera, aspects of a lost paradise. Three Seasons (PG-13; 113 min.), directed by Tony Bui, written by Bui and Timothy Linh Bui, photographed by Richard Horowitz and starring Don Duong and Harvey Keitel, opens Friday at Camera One in San Jose and the Guild in Palo Alto.\n\n[ San Jose | Metroactive Central | Archives ]"
