        "text": "The author’s content and opinions have not been pre-reviewed, approved, or endorsed by Discover.\n\nA hub for cultural diversity, Southeast Asia is home to over 1,000 languages, numerous religions and traditions, and over 600 million people all converging on 11 countries. The countries in Southeast Asia include Brunei, Burma, Cambodia, Timor-Leste, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam as well as the Philippines, which my heart also thinks of as my family’s homeland.\n\nWhile Asian and Asian American stories in American media are beginning to proliferate, we need to intentionally consider representation beyond East Asian actors and stories — especially ones that do not center American politics and imperialism such as the Vietnam War, which writer, director, and producer Tony Bui talks about. As a population over a half-billion large, Southeast Asia’s immense and vast wealth of experience and nuance of showcasing people and the lands where multiplicity abounds is a good reminder that people of different beliefs, backgrounds, and cultures can and do co-exist.\n\nAt a panel titled “Southeast Asia on The Rise” hosted by The Sunrise Collective at the 2024 Sundance Film Festival, I heard from producer and writer Geena Rocero (“Caretakers” and her memoir “Horse Barbie”); Tony Bui (“Three Seasons”); and Grace Moss, vice president of diversity, equity, and inclusion at Warner Brothers Discovery.\n\nBeyond Representation – Southeast Asian Style\n\nThe panel was moderated by Pat Ratulangi, the vice president of global communications, diversity, equity, and inclusion at Nielsen, who introduced the audience to the region by sharing about the diversity of Southeast Asia. Ratulangi also warned about the impacts of global climate change causing displacement in several SEA countries, adding that “there is a lot of migration that happens not just across borders and internationally, but within the region itself. It is primarily driven a lot by healthcare workers, domestic workers, as well as construction and by political instability.”\n\nDespite political instability, Rocero explained that growing up in the Philippines meant that she, as a transgender woman, was “mainstream.” Although the Philippines is a predominantly Catholic country, trans folks are accepted socially.\n\n“When we celebrate Catholic saints and patrons, different fiestas all over the Philippines, usually that is a five-day celebration — and the main event on Sunday is a transgender beauty pageant,” she told the audience. “That’s the culture I come from: These trans pageants happen in the mountain regions [on] national television with whole families watching [after] we go to church on Sunday.”\n\nHowever, social acceptance does not translate to political recognition or rights, the memoirist noted. It’s complicated, but she felt that in terms of “identity politics, it was when I moved to America that I first felt shame.”\n\nWhile Rocero stands out as a model for her beauty, her gender is not unique in the island country. But in the United States, GLAAD Media noted that 80 percent of Americans do not know a trans person. Although there is greater representation of LGBTQ+ characters on screen, Rocero points out that they also tend to be background roles.\n\nIn addition to diverse gender representation, diversity in representation of ethnicities and cultures in film is scarce, as well.\n\n“Every single film I saw about Vietnam had to do with the Vietnam War,” said Bui about growing up and watching American cinema. In these films, most of the time the actors playing the Vietnamese characters on screen were not even Vietnamese. “They put anyone who looked Asian on the screens, and they wouldn’t be speaking in any Vietnamese or they would just be speaking gibberish.” Being the faceless enemy in the jungle or a background character who is shot is not representation, the Vietnamese American storyteller asserted.\n\nFor Bui, he embraces the ability to “control our own narratives” as one of the most powerful things storytellers can do: “The purpose of me becoming a filmmaker was born out of the need to figure out what was going on there.”\n\nCentering Asian American Experiences Also Includes Our Marginalized Stories\n\nCentering all our experiences means centering those who you don’t usually think about.\n\nFor instance, the Filipino nurse stereotype is a challenging and nuanced reality, one that Rocero documented as part of a PBS series titled “Caretakers.” During the COVID-19 pandemic, Filipino nurses in the United States put themselves on the frontlines. Although they are only 4% of the nursing workforce, they represented 25% of COVID-related deaths among nurses.\n\nRocero talked about how care work fell to Filipinos even beyond the pandemic. The docuseries features a nurse who left the Philippines, and her first job was in the Iran-Iraq War. When the nurse came to the United States afterward, she worked at Bellevue Hospital during the AIDS epidemic, and then as the lead nurse at Elmhurst Hospital in Queens, which was an epicenter of the disease.\n\n“When I started talking to her, she was just like any other tita that I know,” Rocero remarked. “She does this crazy, traumatic work, and all she wants to do is go dancing with her girlfriends inside. So when we started putting it together, I was like ‘Let me do some references of Wes Anderson,’ which is very playful, in the way the camera is shot — just to honor that life and to honor that perspective, because if stories are being told from our perspective, it’s so complex, and it’s so nuanced.”\n\nOn the opposite side of the spectrum, Grace Moss shared that having grown up in Diamond Bar, California — a predominantly Filipino American city — she didn’t have the issue of not seeing herself as prom queen. Her Filipino boyfriend literally was the captain of the rival football team.\n\n“It wasn’t until I actually started in the entertainment business where I started to feel very isolated and not see myself represented,” she reflected.\n\nIn her work, Moss conjures the Filipino notion of the “bayanihan spirit,” where a community of villagers comes together to lift the house because there are monsoons and floods. She brings this idea into how she leads and executes pipeline programs at Warner Bros. Discovery because entertainment is inherently a collaborative endeavor.\n\nWhile Moss noted the barriers and the slow pace of progress in the industry, she is optimistic about the future. Moss pointed out the Cambodian-French actress Elodie Yung, from “The Cleaning Lady,” whose character is Cambodian-Filipino, playing a role that isn’t outside of her own ethnic background.\n\nFor all Southeast Asians and Asian Americans, honoring who you are and your identity can be difficult and a privilege, but also very freeing. Rocero shared with the crowd that when she first started modeling, she was not out as trans; in fact, even her modeling agency did not know. A TED Talk and a memoir later, she is one of the leading trans activists and advocates of color.\n\nHer advice: “Be unapologetic in telling your story and sticking to your vision.”\n\nPhoto credit: Christine Chang"
