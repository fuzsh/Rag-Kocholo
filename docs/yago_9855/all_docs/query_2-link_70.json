He has planted eternity in the human heart, but even so, people cannot see the whole scope of God’s work from beginning to end.\n\nYou might not know...\n\nKing David’s son Solomon wrote the book of Ecclesiastes and the Bible says that he was the wisest man alive, no big deal.\n\nWhat does it say?\n\nLife is made up of many different seasons. And not just seasons like winter, spring, summer, and autumn. Different seasons of life for different emotions and different responsibilities.\n\nWhat does it mean?\n\nThe Lord created different seasons in our lives to shape us, help us deal, and create us into who He intended us to be. He uses seasons to show us that He is good and can “make everything beautiful for its own time” (verse 11). Seasons (good and bad) are ways for God to capture our hearts and our faith."
