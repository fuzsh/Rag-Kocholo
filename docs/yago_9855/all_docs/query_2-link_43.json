        "text": "Kaley Cuoco's The Flight Attendant won't be taking off this time around.\n\nThe acclaimed HBO series, which starred Cuoco as flight attendant Cassie Bowden, has been canceled after two seasons.\n\n\"What started out as an attention-grabbing book cover quickly evolved into an extraordinary flight of a lifetime,\" Cuoco said of the show's ending in a statement to E! News Jan. 19. \"I always envisioned TFA as a limited series and thanks to an incredible creative team, we were able to deliver two thrilling seasons.\n\nOf course, hanging up her Imperial Atlantic uniform will be bittersweet.\n\n\"Personally, playing Cassie has been a dream come true,\" she noted, \"and I am so grateful for everyone who played a part in bringing this extremely original series to life.\""
