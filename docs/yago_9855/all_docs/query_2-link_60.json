        "text": "Are you hungry for more? The Bear season 3 returns this week on Thursday, June 27. And if you were hoping to immediately binge all ten episodes of the new season and be the first one to weigh in, we’re sorry—Jeremy Allen White has already beaten you to it.\n\nThe Bear star recently told The Late Show’s Stephen Colbert that he has seen the whole season. White revealed that he typically waits a while to tune in–or doesn’t watch the show at all!—but this time he couldn’t resist. “I watched seven episodes in one sitting because it’s just like, it’s so good,” he said. “Everybody is so good.”\n\nSo what can we expect from season 3? In the latest trailer for the series (streaming above), Carmy (White) is finally out of the damn fridge! At the end of season 2, he and Sydney (Ayo Edebiri) realized their dream of opening up a fine-dining establishment, but it’s going to take serious mental fortitude to keep it running. To establish some order, Carmy comes up with a list of “non-negotiables,” including “push boundaries” and “constantly evolve through creativity.” The vagueness is not lost upon the crew, whom he continues to yell at regarding menu changes, bowl sizes, and his disastrous breakup with Claire (Molly Gordon) last season.\n\nSeason 3 will likely turn into a pressure cooker as Carmy, Sydney, and the rest of the crew find their footing. During his appearance on Colbert, White explained that The Bear’s creator and showrunner, Chris Storer, has veered away from the typical structure of television. “I feel like season 1 was so different to season 2,” White said. “And season 3 is even stranger and more kind of joyful and anxiety-ridden.” Great. More anxiety!\n\nIf that weren’t enough, Deadline reported earlier this year that seasons 3 and 4 filmed back-to-back. FX hasn’t officially confirmed that the hit culinary drama will return for a fourth season, but audiences are clearly savoring Carmy & Co. Now it appears The Bear plans to serve up at least two more courses. “Our crew is amazing—like very amazing,” Storer told Esquire last summer. “Our actors know how fast we drill and are able to make this thing feel incredibly alive and incredibly nerve-racking, which isn’t easy. I’m in awe of them every day.”\n\nThe Bear won big this year at the Emmys and the Golden Globes, taking home top acting honors for both of its main stars. Honestly, we’re not surprised. It’s impossible to resist the allure of Carmy, Sydney, and the rest of the impeccable Chicago restaurant staff. The Bear won Outstanding Comedy Series, Lead Actor (Jeremy Allen White), Supporting Actress (Ayo Edebiri), and Supporting Actor (Ebon Moss-Bachrach) at the Emmys, with White and Edebiri nabbing the top Golden Globe awards as well.\n\nHopefully they’ll be able to maintain that award-worthy buzz in season 3. Judging from the trailer and White’s comments, we have a feeling they’ll do just fine. Edebri reportedly directed one of the new episodes. “I’ve had a blast. I loved directing,” she said on The View. “I met Chris when I was about twenty or twenty-one, and he was like, ‘You’re a director.’ And I was like, ‘No, I think I’m just, like, nosy and opinionated.’ But he was like, ‘You’re a director. Whenever you have time off, come to set. Ask me questions. Whenever you’re on another set, ask the director questions. Just watch and learn and tap into your brain, because you can do this.’ ”\n\nSince starring on The Bear, Edebiri has appeared in Bottoms, Theater Camp, and Inside Out 2—all while presumably collecting directing tips along the way. I don’t know what she and Storer have cooked up for season 3, but we’re ready to dig in."
