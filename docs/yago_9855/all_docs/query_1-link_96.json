        "text": "FILMMAKER Tony Bui doesn’t have much to say in ”Three Seasons,” but thanks to cinematographer Lisa Rinzler, he says it gorgeously.\n\nThe film, the first American movie to be filmed in post-war Vietnam, is a sumptuous banquet for the eyes. The Sundance Film Festival jury and audience prize-winner showcases the ethereal lushness of the Vietnamese countryside and the dowdy, ragged beauty of Ho Chi Minh City’s bustling backstreets and boulevards.\n\nBui, 26, was raised in America, and is obviously bowled over by the exotic look of his native land, but his lyrical images can’t make up for the movie’s stodgy pacing and lack of story.\n\n”Three Seasons” is a quartet of tales about characters seeking redemption, reconciliation and a place in an emerging capitalist society. In the best of the tales, Hai (Don Duong) is a humble cyclo driver who falls in love with the hard-hearted hooker (Zoe Bui) he pedals to her dates in luxury hotels.\n\nVietnamese film star Duong’s kind, weatherbeaten face hides deep reserves of patience and compassion, which eventually acts like a balm on embittered prostitute Lan. He gives her a gift in a moment of charity and grace so surprising and moving it took my breath away.\n\nIn the second tale, a woman (Ngoc Hiep) who harvests lotus flowers becomes devoted to her employer, a diseased old recluse who dwells in a stately house in the middle of a lake.\n\nHarvey Keitel, the only actor in the cast familiar to American audiences, plays a sad-faced ex-GI, returned to look for the daughter he fathered on his tour of duty. And a street-vending urchin (Nguyen Huu Doc) spends the movie searching for a valise full of merchandise someone has stolen from him. The last two tales never go beyond empty cliche.\n\nBui is very generous to the culture he celebrates in ”Three Seasons,” which is fine, but you can’t help wondering if he was so dazzled by the smells, sounds and surfaces of Vietnam that he falls victim to naivete. There’s no inkling of the brutality imposed on the nation by communism, how it shaped these people’s aspirations, or even that communism is part of the Vietnamese experience. One possible explanation: a government censor was constantly present on the set.\n\n——\n\nTHREE SEASONS\n\nStarring Don Duong, Nguyen Ngoc Hiep, Zoe Bui, Harvey Keitel. Written and directed by Tony Bui. In Vietnamese, with English subtitles. Running time: 105 minutes. Rating: PG-13. At the Lincoln Plaza and the Angelika."
