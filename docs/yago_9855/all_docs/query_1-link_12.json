        "text": "Sundance Student to Triple Winner, Tony Bui's \"Three\n\nSeasons\"\n\nby Jeff Winograd\n\nAwarded the Grand Jury Prize, the Audience Award and Best Cinematography\n\nat this year’s Sundance film festival, Tony Bui’s debut film “Three\n\nSeasons” was clearly the big winner to come out of Park City ’99. The\n\nfirst American film shot in Vietnam since the war, “Three Seasons” was\n\nalso the first Dramatic entry to be mostly shot in a foreign tongue.\n\nProduced by Open City Films, starring Harvey Keitel, and acquired by\n\nOctober Films, the film focuses on four-intertwining stories set in the\n\nincreasingly modernized Vietnamese capital of Ho Chi Minh City.\n\nindieWIRE met up with Tony Bui at the Portland International Film\n\nFestival. The young director was happy to be in Portland though his\n\nnon-stop schedule from Sundance to Berlin to New York to Miami meant\n\nthat he had little time to enjoy his recent success. Here, Bui speaks\n\nabout the necessary boost he received from the Sundance Screenwriting\n\nand Directing Labs, getting Harvey aboard, and shooting in Vietnam.\n\nindieWIRE: You went through the Sundance Labs. What did they do for\n\nyou?\n\nTony Bui: I don’t think I’d be where I’m at in terms of making this\n\nfilm, finishing this film, if it wasn’t for the Sundance Institute.\n\nMichelle Satter has been an amazing force in my life. She has been an\n\namazing guidance, not only in terms of someone sort of bucking me out of\n\npure obscurity when she accepted my screenplay to go to the lab, but as\n\nreally supporting the project; she watched it; and brought it to certain\n\npeople’s attention to really help me get this film made. So that’s\n\npriceless. And she’s really been there to help me with everything from\n\nmy agents to my lawyers. Just sort of this person I always call to look\n\nto for advice. I always feel like it’s coming from the right place.\n\niW: How did the labs help you to prepare making your film?\n\nBui: The institute has been very important. The month I spent at the\n\nWriters Lab and at the Directors Lab at Sundance, not only helped to\n\nprepare me to make my first film, which is its intention — to help you\n\nrealize your vision — but also, through the Producers Conference and\n\nthrough just the name of Sundance, gave it enough attention so that\n\npeople started to take interest in it.\n\niW: It’s competitive just to get accepted.\n\nBui: Yeah. There’s something like 2000 scripts submitted and they just\n\naccept like 15 or something. So the early buzz that began to rise came\n\nfrom Sundance — and then as my producers got on board and I met Bingham\n\nRay at the Producers Conference. The relationships that would be forged\n\nthrough the Institute would then help the film get made.\n\niW: Is the Institute what led you to Harvey Keitel [star and executive\n\nproducer] or was that a separate process?\n\nBui: It was separate, but again, once I was on that road and Michelle\n\nknew that Bingham was interested she made a call to [him]. Everyone\n\ntrusts her opinion because she’s not a producer, she’s not an agent. She\n\nalways comes from the right place.\n\nI met Harvey through Open City Films and October Films. And when the\n\ntime came to cast the role of the sole American in my script, they asked\n\nme to make a list of people. At the top of the list was Harvey Keitel.\n\nThey went, “oh, wow, we already have a relationship with Harvey.” A\n\nmeeting was set up. It lasted maybe five minutes. I was intimidated\n\nthe whole time. All I could see was the “Bad Lieutenant” in front of\n\nme, and he said “I don’t want to get your hopes up. I’ll be quite\n\nhonest with you. I’m 99.99 percent sure I can’t do your film. I’m\n\nbooked through the entire year. But I’ll tell you what. I’ll read the\n\nscript because I base all of my decisions on the screenplay.” And I\n\nleft. I tell you it was five minutes long and at the time I thought\n\nyeah I’m sure he’s going to read it in a week; I’m sure he says that to\n\neveryone.\n\nOn the 7th day, he called me up and said he read my screenplay and was\n\nvery moved by it and that it could be an important film. And that he\n\nwanted to be a part of it.\n\niW: Did his involvement have a big impact on the film?\n\nBui: He really championed the film. A couple of times he would call to\n\nmake sure nobody was messing with the film. He would always say “I’m\n\nmaking the director’s film, I want to make sure your vision is intact,\n\nright or wrong.” I always felt like I had someone very strong on my\n\nside.\n\niW: Once you were shooting in Vietnam, how did just being there affect\n\nthe process?\n\nBui: Rediscovering my past and ultimately discovering who I am, changed\n\nme not only in terms of my heritage, but it changed me in terms of what\n\nI had become as a filmmaker. The years I was going back there coincided\n\nwith a time of discovery for me on an artistic level as well. I was in\n\nfilm school, learning about which filmmakers excited me. First the\n\nEuropean filmmakers and later the Asian filmmakers. All this was\n\nhappening at the time I’m going back [to Vietnam]. It was this moment\n\nof artistic discovery and this part of me going through a very personal\n\ndiscovery. It was then that I realized the kind of filmmaker I wanted to\n\nbe.\n\niW: Was there any real stumbling blocks with shooting in Vietnam?\n\nBui: Obviously it was very tough to shoot there. Films had been shut\n\ndown before and after ours. We were the first production ever to be\n\nbonded there. Issues like that were obviously tough. I don’t think its\n\nany tougher there than anywhere else, though. There were things that\n\nfriends of mine were facing in small towns in America that I never had\n\nto deal with. It may have felt like we were going through hell, but we\n\novercame it because we had a great crew and the obstacles were not\n\ninsurmountable.\n\niW: How were you received by the local communities you shot in?\n\nBui: I think good. We came in with a very very strong awareness and a\n\nstrong effort to leave communities as good or better than when we came\n\nin. We tried to be sensitive to that.\n\niW: Tell me about your cinematographer. Where did you find her?\n\nBui: I’m from the West coast and Lisa [Rinzler] is from the East. I\n\nwent to New York and met with almost every D.P. in New York. Lisa was\n\nthe first person I met. It was her spirit that caught me. Clearly she\n\nwasn’t the most technically knowledgeable — she’ll even tell you that.\n\nBut what she had was this amazing heart, amazing humanity, this amazing\n\nsoul I connected with. I was sure if I could bring her to Vietnam, she\n\nwould capture the people and give the film the grace that it needed to\n\nbe given because she’s coming from the right place.\n\niW: How did you go about planning shots?\n\nBui: The script was written to be very visual. The tones and textures\n\nof the different seasons were all on paper. We watched a lot of movies\n\nand talked about the tones and how we didn’t want it to look fake. She\n\nwanted it all to feel natural. For four weeks we worked on storyboards\n\nand shot lists. We never really referred to them during the shooting –\n\nwe changed shots dramatically on location – but it gave us an idea of\n\nwhat we were going for.\n\niW: So what’s next for you?\n\nBui: We’re doing two things. I say “we” because my brother and I\n\ncollaborate on everything. My brother shot all the second unit, which\n\nhelped tremendously. I’m producing my brother’s film. He wrote a film\n\nabout the refugee camps in America in 1975. These four camps across the\n\ncountry. Each had about 30,000 people. It is a very universal\n\nimmigrant story about people living in America but not really because we\n\nwere living in these boundaries. All of these camps were in those\n\ndeserts and people were trying to get over to the other side of the hill\n\nto reach the real America.\n\niW: Do you have anything of your own you’re working on?\n\nBui: I’m also writing a film right now that I hope to do afterwards\n\nwith Harvey [Keitel]. He doesn’t know what it is, but he’s pretty much\n\nsaid he wants to work with me again. It’s a film in English that has\n\nnothing to do with Vietnam. It takes on other things in my life that\n\nare personal that I want to give a voice to. I want to say something\n\nagain that means something."
