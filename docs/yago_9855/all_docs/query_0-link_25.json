        "text": "Asian Cinema #36 [Vietnam]\n\nTony Bui’s Three Seasons is a deep text on Vietnam and its people and how they deal with the aftermath of the Vietnam War. The film notably doesn’t take a stand against America, and it doesn’t necessarily thrash America or pins the Vietnam War on them but instead the Vietnam War is a fact and what the film rightly focuses on is the effects of the war, good or bad. There’s a clear representation of the Vietnam common folk through the cyclo driver, the child peddler, the lotus farmer and the prostitute. Three Season’s tapestry style of filmmaking helps to show the widespread effects of the Vietnam War, making it apparent that it isn’t just a…\n\nA quiet, gentle, reflective film (some might say a little too reflective) that would be notable for trying to reflect the growth and healing of a country (here, Vietnam specifically) through the individuals it's following in its narratives that seek to capture a slice of life and aim for individual redemption, and while the characters are a mixed bag when it comes to how memorable and well-rounded they are, as representatives of a generation, they hold up remarkably well (and are well-acted) - however, this isn't just a Vietnamese film, this is a Vietnamese-American film - partially funded with American money and the first American production allowed to film in the former Saigon since the end of the war. The…\n\nA flourish of Vietnamese culture. I really liked the film. I thought the way they showed intimacy was very cool (sexually and nonsexually). Don't think that I agreed with Hai kinda 'saving' Lan from her life as a sex worker but I think it is more passable when you consider that Lan is mostly being exploited by foreigners and tourists for her services (if you are a sex tourist reading this, especially in Southeast Asian countries, go d1e :D). Also thought it was weird why James' story was given so much emphasis alongside the other stories of local Vietnamese people. Yeah the movie is about the diaspora but like, come on bruh. Like let's consider why James has a child that he only now learns about.\n\nOverall, really enjoyed pieces of my country's culture showcased on film especially with showing how things were before things became more capitalistic."
