        "text": "Making the first American movie ever filmed entirely in Vietnam hasn't been a bed of lotus blossoms, say its producers and its young director, Tony Bui, 25.\n\nAll of them hope Mr. Bui's ''Three Seasons'' will create as much excitement when it is released in the spring as ''The Quiet American'' did nearly 40 years ago.\n\nThe Vietnamese-American auteur was 2 years old when his parents, with high-level connections to the defeated Government of South Vietnam, fled with the family to the United States. He says he hated every minute of his first visit here five years ago.\n\nBut his heart kept pulling him back to the city that used to be known as Saigon, and now he's here shooting his first full-length movie despite obstacles as disparate as a typhoon, Government censors and the constant roar of the motorbikes that are taking over the city two decades after the Communists did.\n\nThe film's major supporters include Harvey Keitel, who plays an American veteran in search of the child, now a young woman, he fathered here. But this is not another war movie about American hang-ups on Vietnam.\n\n''From my first visit here in 1992, I knew that what I had to do was to tell the stories about this place that are the least told: the stories of the Vietnamese, from a Vietnamese point of view, and in Vietnamese,'' Mr. Bui said after shooting a pedicab race scene in the hot sun just after the dry season started.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
