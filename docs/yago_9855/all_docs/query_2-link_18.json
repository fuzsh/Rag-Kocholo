        "text": "EXCLUSIVE: 30 Rock creator and star Tina Fey is returning to the small screen as a lead of The Four Seasons, based on the 1981 feature film, which she co-created with fellow 30 Rock alums Lang Fisher and Tracey Wigfield. The high-profile comedy project, which marks Fey’s first TV starring role since 30 Rock, was taken out to the marketplace just before the holidays. In a very competitive situation with multiple bidders, it landed at Netflix with an eight-episode series order.\n\nProduction is slated to begin later this year. Universal Television, where Fey is based, is the studio.\n\nThe Universal Pictures film The Four Seasons, about three couples who vacation together every season, was written and directed by Alan Alda, produced by Martin Bregman, and starred Alda and Carol Burnett.\n\nThe Four Seasons TV series is written by Fey, Fisher and Wigfield who executive produce with David Miner, Eric Gurian and Jeff Richmond. Alda and Marissa Bregman will produce. Fey’s Little Stranger, Inc. is the production company.\n\nIn addition to Alda and Burnett, The Four Seasons film starred Len Cariou, Sandy Dennis, Rita Moreno, Jack Weston and Bess Armstrong. Its title was derived from the four concerti composed by Antonio Vivaldi. Those compositions, along with others Vivaldi works, comprise the musical score.\n\nThe film spawned a short-lived 1994 CBS series produced by Alda.\n\nThis marks Fey and Universal Television’s latest series with Netflix. The streamer picked up and launched the Emmy-nominated comedy Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt, co-created and executive produced by Fey. One of Netflix’s first original comedy series, it ran for four seasons and also spawned an interactive movie. The Fey-executive produced Girls5eva, created by Meredith Scardino, moved to Netflix after two seasons on Peacock. Its third season debuts March 14.\n\nThe Four Seasons is joining a slate of high-profile upcoming Netflix comedy series which includes Mike Schur’s The Mole Agent adaptation starring Ted Danson, also from UTV; Liz Feldman’s No Good Deed, starring Ray Romano and Lisa Kudrow’ a Steve Levitan and Erin Foster half-hour starring Kristen Bell, and Mindy Kaling’s LA Lakers series.\n\nThe deal for The Four Seasons gives the NBCUniversal Studio Group what arguably have been the two highest-profile sales of 2024 so far. On the feature side, the studio pre-emptively bought the short story package Long Lost, with Steven Spielberg attached .\n\nThe collaborative history of Fey, Fisher and Wigfield goes back to the final season of NBC’s 30 Rock, which Fisher had joined in the final season and for which Fey and Wigfield shared the Emmy for writing the series finale. Fey won the 2007 Emmy for Outstanding Actress in a Comedy Series for 30 Rock, and the show won the Emmy for Outstanding Comedy Series each of its first three seasons. Alda was also a recurring guest star on the NBC comedy.\n\nFisher also co-created Never Have I Ever, which ran for four seasons on Netflix. Wigfield created the NBC series Great News, executive produced by Fey, and developed the Saved by the Bell revival, with each running for multiple seasons.\n\nFey has appeared in guest starring roles on Kimmy Schmidt, Great News and Girls5eva. The Saturday Night Live alumna, who recently starred in the Kenneth Branagh film A Haunting In Venice and has recurred on Hulu’s Only Murders In the Building, wrote, produced and co-stars in the upcoming Mean Girls movie musical. She is repped by WME, 3 Arts and Ziffren Brittenham."
