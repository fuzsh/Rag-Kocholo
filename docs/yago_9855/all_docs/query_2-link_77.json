        "text": "“NCIS: Hawai’i” has been canceled at CBS.\n\nThe “NCIS” spinoff is currently airing its third season at the broadcast network. The season finale scheduled to air on May 6 will now serve as the series finale.\n\n“NCIS: Hawai’i” was the fourth series in the “NCIS” franchise and is now the third series to end. Both “NCIS: New Orleans” and “NCIS: Los Angeles” ended in the past few years after seven and 14 seasons respectively.\n\nThat is not to say the franchise is not still going strong. The mothership series was renewed at the beginning of April. CBS is also prepping a prequel series about a young Jethro Leroy Gibbs, while Paramount+ is readying a spinoff that will see the returns of both Cote de Pablo and Michael Weatherly. Paramount+ and CBS also air “NCIS: Sydney,” which was renewed for a second season in March.\n\n“NCIS: Hawai’i” was also the last scripted series in the CBS lineup awaiting word on its cancellation or renewal. The network has renewed most of its scripted shows, though both “CSI: Vegas” and “So Help Me Todd” were also recently canceled. It was previously announced that “Young Sheldon,” “Bob Hearts Abishola,” and “Blue Bloods” would be ending.\n\n“NCIS: Hawai’i” focused on Jane Tennant (Vanessa Lachey), described as “the first female Special Agent in Charge of NCIS Pearl Harbor. She has thrived and risen through the ranks by equal parts confidence and strategy in a system that has pushed back on her every step of the way. Together with her unwavering team of specialists, they balance duty to family and country while investigating high-stakes crimes involving military personnel, national security and the mysteries of the sun-drenched island paradise itself.”\n\nThe cast also included Alex Tarrant, Noah Mills, Yasmine Al-Bustami, Jason Antoon, Tori Anderson, and Kian Talan. “NCIS: Los Angeles” star LL Cool J also made recurring guest star appearances on the show, reprising the role of Sam Hanna, beginning in Season 3.\n\nMatt Bosack, Jan Nash, and Christopher Silber created the series and served as executive producers along with Larry Teng. CBS Studios produced."
