The screening will be followed by a Q & A with Director Tony Bui. Click here to purchase tickets.\n\nWing Lee grew up in Manhattan’s Lower East Side, attending Brooklyn Technical High School where he majored in Industrial Design. After he graduated from Pratt Institute with a BFA in Communications Design , he was accepted into the Yale School of Drama where he studied under Ming Cho Lee and received an MFA in theatrical set design.\n\nSince then, his work in the motion picture industry as a Production Designer and Art Director has taken him across the United States and Asia. His credits include A GREAT WALL, the first American film shot in Beijing, and THREE SEASONS in Vietnam which won the Sundance Audience Award, Grand Jury Prize, and Cinematography Award. He also received a Best Production Design Award from the Asia-Pacific Film Festival for THE STORY OF SIAO YU directed by Sylvia Chang and an Art Directors Guild Award for an episode of Ugly Betty produced by Salma Hayek. Wing’s latest work can be seen in THE PAPER TIGERS, A FATHER’S SON, and CHRISTMAS WITH YOU on Netflix.\n\nHe is a member of United Scenic Artists Local 829 and the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.\n\n“THREE SEASONS is another production I’m proud of,” shared Lee. “It was filmed around Ho Chi Minh City formerly known as Saigon. I loved the script. It was three intertwining stories, one about an American G.I. played by Harvey Keitel, who goes back to Vietnam to look for a daughter he fathered during the war, another about a cyclo driver who falls for a local hotel call girl and a young woman harvesting lotuses in a lake of a reclusive poet who has leprosy. Each character crosses paths with one another through kindness, poetry, and flowers. The title refers to Vietnam having just three seasons, the dry, the hot and wet seasons.\n\nWhat drew me to this project aside from the script was one of the sets, the reclusive poet’s house was on a lotus lake. We would most likely need to build it as it was specifically written to be a certain way. I was excited to do a film in Vietnam and the challenge of designing a house on a lake. I was part of that generation that was deeply affected by the Vietnam war both politically and the real possibility of being drafted and sent there. I was lucky enough to get a high draft number.\n\nThe thing that struck me as soon as I got off the plane was the heat and humidity. It was 1997 and very little had changed since U.S. left. Reminders of the war were everywhere. Amputees, victims of mines were not uncommon. Aside from the occasional American Army jeep driven by government officials, there were almost no privately operated cars. Everyone got around on mopeds and bicycles. There were few signs and even fewer traffic lights. We had a production office, and I was picked up at my hotel every day by my translator who had worked for the U.S. Navy. My Art Director was a former Viet Cong Officer. Our producers stayed at one of the contemporary hotels directly across from the old U.S. Embassy, the site of the iconic photo of the last helicopter taking off during the final days. I would pass by the Presidential Palace, the site of another well-known photo of a North Vietnamese tank crashing through its gates during the takeover of Saigon. It was strange, ironic, eye opening, and turned out to be one of the most difficult films I’ve ever worked on.\n\nWe needed to find a lake we can build a house on among other sets and locations. Not as easy as it sounds. I didn’t speak Vietnamese and the process of speaking through a translator, having the translator convey what I wanted, and having the third person make their reply to the translator and having to translate the reply back to me made getting anything done became twice as long as normal. Fortunately, carpenters there were used to building on water so the only thing we had to do was get an engineer from Hanoi to sign off on the safety and engineering aspects of what we were doing. We found what I thought was a terrific lake to build on with a small island in the middle. The Director, Tony Bui felt strongly about the color of the lotuses be white. So we planted hundreds hoping they would all grow and bloom by the time filming began. The lotus is Vietnam’s national flower. There was no shortage of advice on how to grow them quickly and on time. Tons of fertilizer were dumped into the lake. It was quite nerve wracking.\n\nOne of the last scenes involved red flower petals falling from trees from foreground along a path into the distance. Another involved a stream of white lotuses floating along a river. I was heavily involved with the helping solving and implementing the FX to make all this happen.\n\nWe wrapped filming and after postproduction, the film was released in 1999 and submitted into the Sundance Film Festival that year. Then I heard THREE SEASONS won The AUDIENCE AWARD, the CINEMATOGRAPHY AWARD, and the GRAND JURY PRIZE, the first film at that point in the festival’s history to win all three awards. Needless to say everyone was thrilled! All that work was worth it!”\n\nThe New York Asian Film Foundation and Film at Lincoln Center (FLC) announced the second round of programming and award honorees for the 23rd edition of the New York Asian Film Festival (NYAFF), taking place July 12–22 at FLC, and from July 22–28 at the SVA Theatre, with special weekend screenings and one-night-only programming from July 13–15, 18–21, and 23–25 at LOOK Cinemas W57, as well as a special collaborative presentation of hit films at the Korean Cultural Center New York on July 13–27.\n\nNYAFF’s classics section includes two standout restorations of transcendent works: Vietnamese American director Tony Bui’s Three Seasons sets three transcendent stories in postwar Ho Chi Minh City, in a 4K restoration never before screened in New York; and straight from this year’s Cannes, the 40th anniversary 4K restoration of Tsui Hark’s romantic comedy Shanghai Blues follows the fated-to-be-together Shu (Sylvia Chang) and Tung (Kenny Bee) as they meet in wartime and then fail to recognize one another when their paths cross again 10 years later.\n\nAlong with the many major names already mentioned, NYAFF is delighted to welcome many creative forces from across Asia and the diaspora to meet the audience in New York, including actors Jake Choi and James Chen, who are reuniting to present their 2015 film Front Cover, Filmmaker in Focus Ray Yeung’s evocative tale of love, identity, and cultural collision.

As previously announced, producer John Chong and actor Philip Ng will be in attendance for a rousing closing to NYAFF 2024.\n\nThe New York Asian Film Festival is co-presented by the New York Asian Film Foundation and Film at Lincoln Center.\n\nNYAFF is curated by executive director Samuel Jamier, associate director Claire Marty, programmers David Wilentz, Karen Severns, Koichi Mori, Thailand expert Donsaron Kovitvanitcha and China Region Consultant Dana Fukazawa; the short film program is curated by Elliot Gong."
