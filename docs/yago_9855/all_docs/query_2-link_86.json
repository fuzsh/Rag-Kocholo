        "text": "The second season of House of the Dragon crept up on us faster than Meleys can take flight, and while we're so happy that the battles of series two are taking place on screen, we're also desperate to know if this is the last time we'll be seeing the chaotic and twisted Targaryen family. Just as curious as us? Well here's what we know so far about the future of the show and if there's going to be a season three of House of the Dragon.\n\nHas a third season of House of the Dragon been confirmed?\n\nBefore House of the Dragon season two even landed on screen, the third season of the show was officially confirmed. In a press release shared on the 14th June 2024, HBO shared that we would definitely be getting a third season of House of the Dragon, with Francesca Orsi, Executive Vice President, HBO Programming, Head of HBO Drama Series and Films sharing a statement to praise showrunner Ryan Condal and writer George R.R. Martin:\n\n\"George, Ryan, and the rest of our incredible executive producers, cast, and crew, have reached new heights with the phenomenal second season of House of the Dragon. We are in awe of the dragon-sized effort the entire team has put into the creation of a spectacular season two, with a scope and scale that is only rivaled by its heart.\n\n\"We could not be more thrilled to continue the story of House Targaryen and watch this team burn bright again for season three.\"\n\nPreviously Ryan told Entertainment Weekly that they are \"deep in writing\" the next season, while adding that he wants to leave the show on a satisfying end. \"You certainly don't want to rush to get to an end, but you also don't want to overstay your welcome. You want to find this very satisfying place to go out that ties up enough loose ends and leaves others intentionally open because, as we know, this history marches on for another 150 years to Daenerys.\"\n\nAnd main cast member Olivia Cooke (who plays Alicent) also gave a small hint about potential future series. When speaking to EW about how tired she was having filmed the entirety of season two (in comparison series one, where she was only in half of the show), she then spoke about the energy she'd need for a third season.\n\n\"Oh my God, by the end of season two, I was a f**kng shell of myself. I was a husk. I could not form a sentence. I was so tired,\" she said. \"I need to implement some way of getting through season three, if there's a season three, to really harness as much energy as possible. It is a behemoth.\"\n\nWho could be in the cast for season three of House of the Dragon?\n\nRight now we're not sure who would be joining a third season of the show. As this is a Game of Thrones spin-off, you've got to be prepared that we're going to lose quite a few main characters in some big battles during season two.\n\nBut given the show essentially revolves around the two of them, we'd likely expect (and hope) we'd see Emma D'Arcy and Olivia Cooke reprise their roles as Rhaenyra and Alicent for a third season.\n\nWhen could a third season begin filming?\n\nFollowing the release of series one, which saw the final episode released in October 2022, filming for the next season then began around six months later in April 2023, and wrapped in September 2023. It then went into post-production and was released in June 2024.\n\nGiven this pattern we'd then expect a third season to begin filming in January 2025, to be released in mid-2026, but this could all of course change."
