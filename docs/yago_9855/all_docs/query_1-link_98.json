        "text": "Movie Mania: 'Angels' leads 5-best list\n\nBy Steven Rosen\n\nDenver Post Movie Critic\n\nMay 28 - Looking for a good movie to see this weekend? Here is Movie Mania's recommendation of the five best films in first-run release:\n\n- The Dreamlife of Angels: A searing French drama, from talented newcomer Erick Zonca, about two young working-class women whose friendship is torn apart by their very different personalities.\n\nSensational award-winning performances by Elodie Bouchez and Natacha Regnier.\n\n- Election: A stinging satire about American life - especially high school life - in the 1990s, with sympathetic performances by Matthew Broderick and Reese Witherspoon that make us like their characters even when we shouldn't.\n\n- Lovers of the Arctic Circle: Reviewed today in Weekend Scene\n\n- Notting Hill: Reviewed today in Weekend Scene\n\n- - Three Seasons: Vietnamese-born American director Tony Bui returns to his homeland for his first film, which has ravishingly beautiful cinematography and a story that is a bit cold but involving nonetheless.\n\n(And don't forget David Mamet's \"The Winslow Boy.'')\n\nCall the Movie Mania hotline at 303-820-1567 or send e-mail to srosenone@aol.com"
