        "text": "FOR THREE SEASONS, Prime Video’s The Boys has served as an important foil to the Marvel Industrial Complex as both Marvel and DC experience growing pains with their film and television releases. Based on the from Garth Ennis and Darick Robertson, The Boys follows a ragtag group of the same name that covertly (and not-so-covertly) fights against superheroes who frequently abuse their powers. The Boys has successfully parodied the idea of superhero-powered content through Vought International—the corporation which runs The Seven (the main group of superheroes, based on DC's Justice League) and markets superheroes throughout media.\n\nThe show has done more than just look at the ways we idolize those in power. So far, over the course of three seasons (and a spinoff, Gen V), showrunner Eric Kripke has cast a sharp look at modern American politics, ranging from the Trumpian figure of Homelander (Antony Starr) to scheming politician Victoria Neuman (Claudia Doumit). And all that cultural commentary doesn’t take anything away from the absurd humor, cartoonish hyperviolence, and frankly pretty queer relationships that help build the heart and soul of the show out.\n\nWith Season 4 now rolling out and Kripke’s recent announcement that season 5 will be The Boys’s last, now is as good a time as any to brush up on what has previously happened on the show. So here’s a refresher of The Boys, and what you’ll need to know from Gen V, if you haven’t yet watched the collegiate superhero spin-off.\n\nSeason 1\n\nIT MAKES SENSE that everything begins (and potentially will end) with Hughie Campbell (Jack Quaid)—the everyman who ends up getting into the vigilante group known as The Boys after his girlfriend is accidentally killed by one of the Seven, A-Train (Jessie T. Usher). He’s brought into the fold by Billy Butcher (Karl Urban), a foul-mouthed loose cannon with a cockney accent and a ton of charisma—and that’s just the beginning of their fraught relationship.\n\nAs for the rest of the gang, Frenchie (Tomer Capone) has been brought on after Butcher and Hughie kidnap Translucent, an obnoxious member of The Seven with the power of invisibility, after Butcher and Frenchie went their own ways years ago. After the death of Translucent (Hughie kills him the only way possible to breach his impenetrable skin: by detonating an explosive shoved up his butt), Frenchie decides to stick around even after Butcher wants to bring on their other old associate, Mother’s Milk (Laz Alonso), whom he does not get along with. But after they track A-Train's devices together, they solve their differences. There's also Kimiko (Karen Fukuhara), perhaps the character who has evolved the most since her Season 1 introduction. She’s found in a Triad hangout, initially known just as “The Female.” When Frenchie releases her, she kills her entrappers and escapes. M.M. finds evidence that she’s a test subject. Both Frenchie and M.M. work to find out her history—learning her name is Kimiko and that she was kidnapped and tested on by the Shining Light Liberation Army, giving her powers of superstrength and Deadpool-esque regeneration.\n\nThroughout all this, one of the most important discoveries is Compound V—a drug they learn A-Train is taking while spying on him. Basically, Compound V is a drug that can turn ordinary human beings into superheroes. But for A-Train it essentially works as a steroid, and one that later causes him to have a heart attack and go into cardiac arrest later in Season 1 (he feels he's slipping in his performance, and with major races coming up doesn't want to risk losing his title as fastest man alive. Because, obviously, that just can't happen. Imagine if The Flash lost to some dude?).\n\nKeep in mind, Compound V remains incredibly important throughout the series, and Season 1 reveals that the drug was given to pregnant women to create “supes” at random since the '70s.\n\nSeason 1’s insight into the workings of The Seven comes via Annie January (Erin Moriarty) who plays Starlight, a new superhero introduced into the Vought Industries group after the retirement of Lamplighter (another piece of work we eventually meet in Season 2). Her introduction to the Vought world isn’t good—fellow supe The Deep (Chace Crawford) sexually assaults her and she tells him she’ll kill him if he tries anything with her again. She stops a rape from happening and gains support for that, but she’s struggling with having to shill the Vought agenda. She meets Hughie by happenstance, and the two emotionally connect which later leads to a romantic relationship.\n\nAnnie’s assault by The Deep eventually gets taken seriously and he’s made to publicly apologize before being shipped off to Ohio for a sabbatical where he himself then gets sexually assaulted by a fan. After that, he’s not allowed back into The Seven, and loses it. Speaking of losing it, Homelander perhaps had already lost it when we meet him in Season 1. He starts not one, but two plane crashes in the season—the second with Queen Maeve (Dominique McElligott) which he later uses as a political angle to push for militarized Supes. He also kills Madelyn Stillwell (Elisabeth Shue), one of Vought’s executives, when he's made angry that she’s kept a secret from him (this is a major moment in his sociopathy, as Homelander's entire All-American backstory sold to the public was a lie; he was created and raised in a lab, and Stillwell was the closest thing he ever had to a mother... which made their sometimes romantic (?) relationship even stranger). That secret leads to a big reveal between Homelander and Butcher, explaining much of Butcher’s constant push to destroy superheroes: Homelander raped Butcher’s wife, Becca, and then she disappeared, and is presumed dead. Her disappearance however is revealed that she was sent away because she was pregnant with Homelander’s child.\n\nSeason 2\n\nBUTCHER’S REVELATION THAT Becca has been held by Vought to raise Homelander’s child just adds fuel to the fire between The Boys and the Supes going into Season 2. After everything Annie has gone through with Vought, she now works as a double agent, feeding information to The Boys. This season, the gang is no longer the ragtag bunch they were before—they've got an organized and concerted effort in place to take Vought down. There’s an unknown assassin on the loose, who they later learn is Kimiko’s brother, but is murdered by a new member of The Seven, Stormfront (Aya Cash). More on her later. Compound V remains a big issue, with Annie leaking to the media that it’s responsible for the powers of Supes. However, when The Boys break into a psychiatric hospital, they discover trapped Compound V patients and learn that Vought is trying to stabilize the drug in adults. When it’s found out that Annie leaked information about Compound V, Hughie attempts a rescue mission that ends up with Maeve saving Annie. This information leads Congresswoman Victoria Neuman to schedule a hearing against Vought. By the end of the season, Hughie ends up working for Neuman, thinking she’s a good guy. It turns out, though, that she's been a secret assassin—with the ability to make people's heads explode—all along.\n\nMaeve is in full “bring down Homelander” mode after the plane crash, warning her ex-girlfriend about him and plots a way to bring him down. She’s not the only one trying to bring Homelander down—Butcher is trying to find Becca and her son Ryan (Cameron Crovetti) and is ready to do anything to find their whereabouts. When he does, Becca refuses to leave with him because he won’t accept Ryan as her son. Homelander, on the other hand, has been aggressively trying to become a father to Ryan, forcing himself into their lives and pushing Ryan to use his powers.\n\nWhile he’s trying to “parent” Ryan, Homelander is also desperately trying to keep his standing in The Seven, due to Stormfront’s newfound popularity. While both Maeve and Butcher are trying to bring him down, a video surfaces of Homelander killing two civilians which Stormfront helps him deal with and the two embark on a relationship. The Boys discover that Stormfront has a Nazi past and was involved in a racially-charged murder. She also tells Homelander she’s the first successful Compound V subject, and the widow of Vought's founder. The pair together get Ryan to leave his mother, and Butcher attempts to save Becca and Ryan from Stormfront. Ryan, when Stormfront attacks his mother, cripples her with his powers, but accidentally kills Becca in the process. Maeve uses the plane footage to blackmail Homelander into letting them go.\n\nAs for the rest of The Seven, The Deep joins a church to regain favor that quickly becomes a cult situation (one that recruits people using Fresca of all things) where he’s drugged and ends up in an arranged marriage. After all of that, he’s still not reinstated into The Seven. A-Train has awakened from his coma, and is taken out of the group by Homelander. He ends up joining the Deep for a minute at the church, but quickly questions their intentions. Unlike The Deep, he ends up back in The Seven.\n\nSeason 3\n\nTAKING PLACE A year after the events of Season 2, The Boys are working for Victoria Neuman’s Bureau of Superhero Affairs, which aims to capture problematic Supes. In order to polish the tarnished reputation of The Seven, Annie is now co-captain along with Homelander. Maeve is also working alongside Butcher to aid in taking Homelander down for good, telling him to investigate Soldier Boy (Jensen Ackles), a Captain America-esque superhero who mysteriously died, in order to find someone who could destroy him. She also gives him V24, a Compound V variant that allows the user to have temporary superpowers.\n\nV24 is a big part of Season 3. Both Butcher and Hughie begin taking it, being able to protect themselves in ways they previously couldn’t. Annie finds out that 3-5 doses of V24 can potentially kill users and tells Butcher who abandons Hughie (saving him from terminally dosing on the drug) rather than tell him directly. At the end of the season, it’s revealed that the V24 has left Butcher terminally ill.\n\nSpeaking of superpowers, Hughie finds out that his boss, Neuman, isn’t who she says she is: she’s actually a Supe. He investigates her further, finding out that Vought's CEO Stan Edgar (Giancarlo Esposito) is actually her adoptive father. She later goes against him, leading to him being pushed out from Vought, leaving Homelander alone at the top of the company. After getting Compound V from Homelander, she injects her daughter with it. At the end of the season, Neuman is declared to be Robert Singer’s running mate in the presidential election after Homelander has The Deep kill the politician who was previously on the ticket.\n\nThe hunt for Soldier Boy takes our guys to Russia and to Herogasm, an annual “supe orgy,” which has some of the weirdest stuff you’ll see on television. They find Soldier Boy’s widow and old friends to find out information about him—learning he died in Nicaragua on a C.I.A. mission. Mother’s Milk rejoins the group because Soldier Boy killed his family, so everyone has a reason to find the guy. They find Soldier Boy, still alive, in a Russian laboratory. He frequently releases energy bursts that cause explosions around him, inadvertently harming Kimiko and causing her to seemingly lose her powers. However, he goes on a spree finding his former teammates with Butcher and Hughie in exchange to kill Homelander. While his attempts to kill Homelander don’t end up working out, it is revealed that he’s Homelander’s father. He’s later taken into government custody after they leave with The Boys, Annie, and Maeve to kill Homelander. Homelander is with Ryan during this and when he tries to protect him, Soldier Boy attacks Ryan, causing everyone else to attack Soldier Boy. Maeve takes one for the team, keeping Soldier Boy away from the others. This in turn causes her to lose her powers, but she can finally live a non-Supe life in private with her girlfriend.\n\nUpon learning that Soldier Boy is his father, Homelander, in true Homelander fashion, goes nuts. He kills Noir (Nathan Mitchell) because he never told him who his father is, even though we learn about Noir’s own past trauma with Soldier Boy. Earlier in the season, Homelander is already on the edge—claiming his greatness at Vought, even though executives aren’t quite convinced. He pressures Starlight to pretend they are in a relationship. A-Train informs Homelander of Starlight’s planned coup, and threatens Hughie if she doesn’t comply. Annie, finally sick of Vought, livestreams leaving The Seven and condemns them. Homelander confronts her, but Annie records him confessing to his crimes and posts it online. After he escapes with Ryan at the Soldier Boy confrontation, he ends up at a Neuman rally, killing a Starlight supporter for hitting Ryan with a thrown soda bottle.\n\nAs for everyone else, Kimiko and Frenchie continue their will-they-won’t they and both grapple with their pasts (and Kimiko eventually gets her powers back). A-Train tries to rebrand himself—including a cringy energy drink commercial that brilliantly satirizes an infamous Pepsi ad—and goes back and forth on whether or not he’ll side with Homelander or Starlight. He ends up with the Supe Blue Hawk, asking him to make a public apology for his racist behavior. It ends up in a fight with A-Train’s brother becoming paralyzed (and A-Train kills Blue Hawk as revenge during Herogasm).\n\nAfter suffering another heart attack, A-Train ends up with a heart transplant—Blue Hawk’s. And the Deep finally gets his wish, landing a spot back in The Seven because of his comeback which includes a book about escaping the Fresca cult, and a new wife. However during Herogasm, he meets an octopus and after they have consensual sex, he tries to get his wife to open up their relationship, which she declines (and later writes her own tell-all book). And he continues to remain faithful to Homelander.\n\nGen V"
