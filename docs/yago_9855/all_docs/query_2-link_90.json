        "text": "The fifth and final season of London crime drama Top Boy has just dropped, bringing the story of drug empire kingpins and main characters Dushane (Ashley Walters) and Sully (Kane 'Kano' Robinson) to a conclusion.\n\nFull of emotionally-charged moments, and exploring hard-hitting themes such as gentrification, institutional racism, family bonds and betrayal — this is the fifth season overall, but only the third season to be released by Netflix.\n\nRead this next: A new Netflix documentary unearths The Legend Of Cocaine Island\n\nThe first two seasons were broadcast on Channel 4. Despite its popularity, Channel 4 cancelled the programme in 2013, leaving fans devastated — until Netflix resurrected it six years later with the aid of fan and executive producer Drake.\n\nIn September 2019 the third season was released on the streaming service. Netflix named this series Top Boy, labelling it as Season 1, while the original two seasons broadcast on Channel 4 were put on Netflix under the name Top Boy: Summerhouse.\n\nThe latest instalment of the show is titled 'Season 3', although technically it is Season 5 of the full story.\n\nRead this next: Kano highlights police brutality in performance of his single 'Teardrops'\n\nAll of the show is available on the UK version of Netflix, including the two non-Netflix produced seasons, which contain four episodes each and were originally aired by Channel 4.\n\nTop Boy season 1 (made by Netflix) begins off where Top Boy: Summerhouse season 2 (made by Channel 4) left off, with Dushane returning from exile to regain his role in the London drug market, but Netflix has changed the name of the show entirely.\n\nTo assist viewers to distinguish between the two, the previous Channel 4 program has been renamed Top Boy: Summerhouse on Netflix, after the Summerhouse estate in Hackney where the show is set.\n\nRead this next: NTS and Netflix have launched the Top Boy Academy\n\nTop Boy seasons 1, 2 and 3, which were made by Netflix, are all available to watch on Netflix - globally, as are Top Boy: Summerhouse Season 1 and 2.\n\nAt the start of 2022, Netflix removed Top Boy: Summerhouse season 1 from its global platforms, but later reinstated it.\n\nTop Boy: Summerhouse season 1 and 2 can also be purchased on Amazon to watch.\n\nRead this next: 6 of the best dance music documentaries to watch on Netflix\n\nThis is the order of the seasons and where they can be watched:\n\nTop Boy: Summerhouse (season 1) - watch on Netflix/buy on Amazon\n\nTop Boy: Summerhouse (season 2) - watch on Netflix/buy on Amazon\n\nTop Boy (season 1) - watch on Netflix\n\nTop Boy (season 2) - watch on Netflix\n\nTop Boy (season 3) - watch on Netflix\n\nAlong side Ashley Walters and Kane 'Kano' Robinson, stars of the fifth and final season include Simbiatu Ajikawo (AKA Little Simz), Jasmine Jobson, Araloyin Oshunremi, Natalie Athanasiou (AKA NoLay) and Academy Award-nominee Barry Keoghan.\n\nRead this next: Stormzy: \"If we weren't oppressed, we wouldn't be shouting\""
