        "text": "Q&A with Tony Bui\n\nThree Seasons is a film that refuses to be forgotten, and a new 4K restoration thankfully brings an alternative to its many pixelated YouTube links or glitchy pirate DVDs. A gem shot on Vietnamese soil (and the first of its kind) just as the U.S. decided to play nice, Tony Bui’s debut feature is a love letter to rain-soaked Saigon, a city caught in the whirlwind of change. The story weaves together four lives: a cyclo driver (Đơn Dương) who finds a kindred spirit in a world-weary prostitute (Zoe Bui); a street kid (Nguyễn Hữu Được) who befriends a U.S. G.I. (Harvey Keitel); and a young vendor (Ngọc Hiệp) who seeks beauty in the fleeting perfection of lotus flowers. It’s a tale that’s at once gritty and poetic, a snapshot of a place where the old and new collide in a dance of beauty and despair. Three Seasons’ long-overdue return to the festival circuit isn’t just a tech upgrade—it’s a rescue mission for a film that deserves to be seen in all its poetic glory."
