        "text": "The CW has canceled “All American: Homecoming,” which will begin airing its third (and now final) season on July 8.\n\n“We want to thank the cast, crew, producers, NK, Marqui and everybody at Berlanti Productions and Warner Bros. Television for their hard work and dedication in telling these important stories for three incredible seasons,” The CW said in a statement. “The upcoming final season is the best yet and we cannot wait to share it with fans beginning on Monday, July 8.”\n\nThe series is a spinoff of “All American,” which was recently renewed for a seventh season at The CW.\n\n“I’m devastated to learn that ‘All American: Homecoming’ will not be moving forward with more episodes and that this new season premiering in July will be our final one,” said series executive producer Nkechi Okoro Carroll. “However, I am so very grateful to have worked with this incredible cast and crew, led by Geffri Maya, to bring the authentic HBCU experience to your screens for the last three seasons. We made this show for the culture and thank our loyal audience and fans for taking this ride with us. We made this show so that our community, our kids (and their dreams), could be seen and celebrated every week and we are proud to say we accomplished that mission… Especially with this exciting final season which we can’t wait to show you all. So with a heavy but proud heart, I give one final shoutout to our favorite BRINGSTON LIONS!”\n\n“Homecoming” follows tennis player — and Jordan Baker’s (Michael Evans Behling) girlfriend — Simone Hicks, baseball prodigy Damon Sims (Peyton Alex Smith) and their friend group at Bringston University, a historically Black college in Atlanta. The cast also includes Kelly Jenrette as Amara Patterson, Cory Hardrict as Coach Marcus Turner, Sylvester Powell as JR, Camille Hyde as Thea Mays, Mitchell Edwards as Cam Watkins, Netta Walker as Keisha McCalla and Rhoyle Ivy King as Nathaniel Hardin.\n\n“All American: Homecoming” premiered in 2022 and scored a 100% on Rotten Tomatoes, with Variety‘s Daniel D’Addario calling the series “admirably big-hearted in crafting two protagonists whose struggles viewers will follow attentively, and in conjuring a campus whose squabbles and scandals feel human-scale.”\n\nWarner Bros. Television and CBS Studios produce “All American: Homecoming,” in association with Berlanti Productions, with executive producers Nkechi Okoro Carroll, Greg Berlanti, Sarah Schechter, Marqui Jackson and Robbie Rogers."
