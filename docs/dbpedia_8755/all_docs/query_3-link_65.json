        "text": "In 2016, Justin Rose and Niall Horan brought golf and music together to raise money to support life-saving research into children’s and young people’s cancers.\n\nHoran & Rose launched with a phenomenal event encompassing an evening of music and entertainment and a day of golf. The event brought together renowned VIPs and performers and resulted in an incredible £483,000 being raised for Cancer Research UK for Children & Young People.\n\nSince its launch, Horan & Rose has continued to support Cancer Research UK for Children & Young People’s vital research into cancers affecting 0-24-year-olds. £1.25m has been raised so far through two flagship events and wider fundraising activities led by Justin and Niall.\n\nThanks to research, today, more children and young people in the UK are surviving cancer than ever before. But this isn’t the full picture.\n\nCancer remains the leading cause of death by disease in 1-24-year olds. This means that every year in the UK, cancer claims the lives of around 510 children and young people. That’s nearly 10 deaths each week. On top of this, we know that survivors often experience serious long-term side effects – like infertility and hearing loss – because of their treatment.\n\nThrough medical research and with the continued support of dedicated partners like Horan & Rose, we’re determined to change this, and to bring forward the day when every child and young person survives their cancer with a good quality of life.\n\nIn 2018, the second gala event raised over £600,000 to help fund Professor Richard Gilbertson and his children’s brain tumour research team at the Cancer Research UK Cambridge Institute. More children die from brain tumours than from any other type of cancer. Professor Gilbertson has dedicated his whole career to changing this and is one of the world’s leading experts in childhood brain tumour research. His research focuses on the genetic faults that lead to the development of brain tumours, with the aim of identifying new drugs for children with the disease.\n\n“Thank you to everyone involved with Horan & Rose for their fantastic support! The amount of money raised is amazing and will go a long way to helping us identify new ways to treat some of the toughest children’s brain tumours. On behalf of myself and my entire team here in Cambridge, THANK YOU!”\n\nProfessor Richard Gilbertson, Director of the CRUK Cambridge Centre\n\nIn addition to funds raised for Cancer Research UK, Justin and Niall have also raised £250,000 split between the Kate & Justin Rose Foundation and Irish Autism Action. This brings the Horan & Rose contribution towards charitable causes to an incredible £1.5m to date.\n\nThe 2021 event, held at The Grove in London, broke all previous records with £1.1million raised on a memorable night headlined by Grammy award nominated Lewis Capaldi. A whole host of VIP’s from the world of sport, music and beyond turned out to show their support for Cancer Research UK for Children & Young People and The Black Heart Foundation, supporting educational access, learning, aspiration and achievement for underprivileged children.\n\nHoran & Rose has demonstrated the impact both the entertainment and sporty industries can have on the charity sector. Together, we are proud to be making a difference."
