        "text": "The local community and wildlife will benefit after the GAP – Get Active Pathway at Horam Recreation Ground – received grants from The Veolia Environmental Trust, Horam Parish Council, Biffa Award, Pro Eco and Lodge Group Care UK Ltd.\n\nLocal MP Nus Ghani comes along to support the start of the pathway construction\n\nLeft to Right: Brian Arnott, HVH trustee; Andy Billings, Horam Parish Councillor; MP Nusrat Ghani; Paul Rippingale, Southern Landscapes & Construction; Cornelie Usborne, Wealden District Councillor and Horam Parish Councillor Steve Fisher and HVH trustee.\n\nThe project will aim to address health issues by increasing physical activity opportunities, free of charge, all year round, for residents. The improvements will address isolation by providing a social arena in which to make friends, socialise, and improve mental well-being. It will increase community cohesion, through enabling more people from a range of backgrounds and ages, to have a reason to access the ground, and more people make the ground safer, more visible – and, we hope, fun!\n\nFor the community, having a facility which can offer so much leisure activity, such as cycling, scooting, walking, and enjoying nature, for free, while also offering a healthy activity is a very good thing. Opportunities for people from all backgrounds to see and meet each other will give a feeling of ‘community’, and a ‘safe space’. The pathway will attract many who simply could not use the space before due to mobility issues, or for cycling or buggies, and this means they can exercise and enjoy nature.\n\nHoram Village Hall and Recreation Ground charity has received grants from The Veolia Environmental Trust, Horam Parish Council and Biffa Award; a multi-million-pound fund that helps to build communities and transform lives through awarding grants to community and environmental projects across the UK, as part of the Government’s Landfill Communities Fund. They are grateful for the remainder of the project funding from Pro Eco and Lodge Group Care UK Ltd.\n\nThe idea of a pathway was first highlighted by a local resident in a survey carried out by the Trustees of Horam Village Hall to find out what local people wanted from their recreation ground. Since then, they have worked tirelessly to secure funding and design an environmentally friendly pathway and create nature areas and enhance the biodiversity.\n\nSteve Fisher, Project Leader, and Trustee of Horam Village Hall said “This is a fantastic project to make the recreation grounds accessible to all residents in our community. In carrying out the works during the summer months we are minimising disturbance to the ground and the path will be complete before the autumnal weather sets in.”\n\nLisa Stevens, Trustee and Biodiversity lead on the project said “The pathway project has given us an opportunity to rethink the recreational ground, providing more space for a bigger variety of wildlife. On the route around the pathway residents will see trees and hedgerows and we now have an area we are managing as a traditional wildflower meadow, a habitat that has declined drastically over the last 50 years. We have already seen an increase in the numbers of butterflies and other insects on the site. The local community have helped with the project planting a native hedge and raking up the meadow cuttings to promote wildflowers. We hope to plant more trees once the pathway is in place.\n\nLocal resident Christine Walker said “I think the path is fantastic, it will enable people to use the recreation ground all year round, walking and cycling and when it’s really wet and waterlogged it will be usable. I am really pleased that it’s come to fruition for everyone in the area to use, I would just like to thank everyone who was involved.”"
