        "text": "An international company had its very first beginnings in this small village. In 1946 Jack Wood and Ian Howie founded the Merrydown wine and cider company and began operating it from within Merrydown Cottage in Horam. As the business grew, they had up to 130 people working for them, and they produced around 35,000 bottles a day. Interestingly, the cider they made originated from their time in a German prison camp.\n\nDuring the Second World War, Horam was the first village in the local area to be hit by bombs and doodlebugs. On the 16th June 1944 Riverdale Nursery was hit, followed by Streeton Nursery on the 17th July.\n\nHoram features a particularly interesting site called Horam Manor Farm. It consists of a cluster of traditional barns and cartlodges and offers a wide range of different habitats across its land including open grassland, meadows, ancient woodland, streams and Tudor hammer ponds. It is beautiful to wander around on a sunny day. Due to the wide diversity of habitats, it is part of the Countryside Stewardship programme which helps with the maintenance and management of the various environments. As well as the nature trails, Horam Manor Farm offers a small museum and courtyard, riding stables, peaceful fishing spots and a lovely cafe.\n\nHoram is ideally located for a ride along the Cuckoo trail or a visit to the Hidden Springs Vineyard or the golf club. For the more adventurous visitors it also has a local campsite so you will have plenty of time to explore all the beauty and nature Horam has to offer."
