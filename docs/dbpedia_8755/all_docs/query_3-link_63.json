        "text": "Many talented musicians have joined The Voice's panel during its 24 seasons, but two-time Coach Niall Horan's red chair reign has been nothing short of incredible.\n\nThe \"Heaven\" singer has been crushing it, winning The Voice during his debut season as a Coach with his Team Niall Artist Gina Miles and scoring a second consecutive win during his red chair return in Season 24 with soul-rocker Huntley.\n\nRELATED:The Awards Niall Horan Won For His Solo Work and with One Direction\n\nHoran experienced a meteoric rise to fame as part of his own singing competition in 2011 and has since had both a prolific group and solo career. Following his 2016 solo debut, Horan has emerged as one of the most talented singer-songwriters in the industry, making his expertise invaluable as he helps Artists achieve success on The Voice.\n\nBelow, relive Horan's illustrious music stardom to witness his journey from reality competition fame to The Voice's red chair.\n\nNiall Horan's Solo Career\n\nHoran launched his solo career with his debut single \"This Town,\" which peaked at No. 20 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 2016. Horan's angelic vocals and vulnerable lyricism were instantly applauded, and his solo career picked up further momentum with the 2017 release of his fan-favorite single \"Slow Hands,\" which peaked at No. 11 on the Hot 100.\n\nBoth chart-climbers ended up on Horan's solo album debut, Flicker. The album was well-received, dominating the radio waves in the U.S. and Ireland, boasting an eclectic folksy verve that deviated from One Direction's pop sound. Horan's creative process for the album was chronicled in the short documentary On the Record: Flicker.\n\nNiall Horan released his sophomore album, Heartbreak Weather in 2020. The album produced singles like \"No Judgement,\" \"Nice to Meet Ya,\" and \"Put a Little Love on Me.\"\n\nHoran graced fans with new music in February 2023 with the release of \"Heaven,\" his lead single from what would become his third studio album, The Show. In April 2023, Horan released The Show's second single, \"Meltdown\" to hype listeners up for the release.\n\nRELATED: Niall Horan & John Legend Sing \"The Show\" in a Duet\n\nDuring a March 2023 chat with NBC Insider, Horan opened up about his creative process for constructing The Show.\n\n“I would say for the new stuff, there is some experimentation going on,\" Horan revealed. \"Yes, just stuff I've gathered over the years, you know, like ideas that I've had, things that I've learned influenced me, I'm starting to hear them all already come through my music.\"\n\n\"I haven't released music since I was 25 or 26, and to be closing in on 30, I think you just gather more information as you go,\" Horan continued. \"So I'm starting to hear all of that stuff [in] my music. And what I'm saying is a bit more grown up I guess. And I wanted the sound of that to match what I'm saying. So I think it's my favorite stuff. And the best stuff that I've made.\"\n\nThe Show was released as an album in June 2023, and Horan is taking it on the road for The Show world tour in 2024. Horan's tour kicks off in Belfast in February before making its way to the U.S. in May 2024. Tickets can be purchased on Horan's website.\n\nIn a December 2023 interview with Good Morning America, Horan teased details of the energizing tour, which will include a lineup of mystery special guests.\n\n\"I don't really know how much I want to give away because I've been putting this show together since I was about 10...\" Horan revealed. \"The stage is already being built, there are tests going on and other tricks that we're trying as we speak.\"\n\n\"The setlist will be a combination of all the albums that I've made, some hidden surprises here and there, and maybe some special guests along the way I'd imagine,\" Horan concluded. \"But apart from that, I'm not telling you anything!\"\n\nNiall Horan's Collaborations with Taylor Swift and Lewis Capaldi\n\nAs one of the biggest superstars in pop music, Horan has worked with several legends in the music industry, Taylor Swift included. Swift hit up Horan for help performing at Wembley Stadium for her 2018 Reputation tour, where they both sang \"Slow Hands.\"\n\nLater, in 2019, Horan and Lewis Capaldi became friends online and hit it off so well that they decided to collaborate on some projects, leading Horan to join Capaldi on stage for several of his performances.\n\nRELATED: All About Niall Horan's Epic Irish Road Trip With His Best Friend, Lewis Capaldi\n\nThe two then took their talents on the road for the documentary, Niall Horan's Homecoming: The Road to Mullingar with Lewis Capaldi. The film centers around Capaldi and Horan's friendship as the two young men venture off on an epic road trip throughout Ireland.\n\nNiall Horan on The Voice\n\nNiall Horan became a Coach on The Voice in Season 23, joining the panel alongside Coaches Kelly Clarkson, Chance the Rapper, and Blake Shelton.\n\n\"I’m excited to be joining this season of The Voice as a Coach,\" Horan said in a statement. \"I’m looking forward to meeting and mentoring the new crop of talent while we battle it out with the other teams!”\n\nHoran hit the ground running in his debut season, plucking whatever powerhouse singer-songwriters he witnessed during the intense Blind Auditions. As Shelton's final season in the red chair, he quickly teased Horan was replacing him, developing a wholesome father-son dynamic within the competition.\n\nRELATED: An Official Recap of Team Niall on The Voice Season 24\n\nNot many debut Coaches can seize the victory, but Horan's team was exceptional, resulting in his Season 23 win with Gina Miles."
