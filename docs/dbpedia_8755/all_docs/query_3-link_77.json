        "text": "Balfour Beatty is working in partnership with East Sussex County Council to manage the highways service across East Sussex. As part of this, we will be carrying out drainage works in High Street, Horam.\n\nThese works are being carried out to alleviate reports of flooding to the carriageway and private property.\n\nWhen do they start?\n\nWorks will begin on Monday 11 September and will continue for 5 days.\n\nHow will this impact highway users?\n\nHigh Street, Horam will remain open to through traffic, however there will be 3-way temporary traffic signals in place. The team will be on site between 9:30am and 4pm.\n\nInformation for residents and businesses\n\nParking: ‘No parking’ signs and cones will be on the site to advise where parking is restricted. Please avoid parking in these locations as it will delay our works.\n\nWeather: All of these works are subject to favourable weather conditions, for example heavy rain may affect the progress of the works.\n\nProperties close to the works area may experience a temporary disturbance as this can be a noisy process and those properties may experience flashing lights and reversing sirens. We would like to take this opportunity to apologise for any inconvenience or disruption this work may cause, however this forms part of our continuing improvement for the East Sussex highway network.\n\nPlease let us know how we did by leaving feedback. Please note you will be redirected to the East Sussex County Council consultation website."
