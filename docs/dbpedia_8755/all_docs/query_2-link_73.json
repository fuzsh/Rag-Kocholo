        "text": "How the lottery works\n\nWealden Community Lottery is an exciting weekly lottery that raises money for good causes in Wealden District. All good causes supported by the lottery will benefit Wealden District and its residents.\n\nPlay the lottery, support Wealden District - it's that simple!\n\nTickets for the lottery cost just £1 a week. Each ticket has a 1 in 50 chance to win a prize each week, with a top prize of £25,000! There's a better chance of winning the jackpot than the National Lottery or the Health Lottery.\n\nEach ticket has six numbers and each number is between 0 and 9. There will be a draw every Saturday night when a six digit winning combination will be picked. Prizes will be given to players with tickets that match the first or last 2 to 6 numbers from the winning combination. Match all six and you win the jackpot!\n\nA full list of prizes below:\n\nYour local good causes\n\nThe lottery and its prizes are our way of putting the fun in fundraising. The real winners are the good causes. From every £1 ticket sold 60p will go to good causes in Wealden District. To put this in perspective when you play the National Lottery 25% goes to good causes – we’ve more than doubled the ticket percentage that goes to good causes.\n\nEven better, you can choose which good cause gets 50p of the 60p (the remaining 10p will be distributed to other local good causes).\n\nGood luck and have fun!\n\nWe hope you'll join us in making Wealden District even better and have some fun along the way."
