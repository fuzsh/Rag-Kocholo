        "text": "Our address is Wealden Crematorium, Horam Road, Horam, East Sussex TN21 0FX however some Sat Navs have trouble locating our postcode due to our “newness”.\n\nIf you’re using a Sat Nav – the best postcode to use is TN21 0LH. This will take you to the house opposite the entrance to the crematorium. You will see our entrance clearly marked but opposite your Sat Nav end destination.\n\nWe’re well signposted from both the north and south directions along the A267.\n\nApproaching from the south:\n\nJoin the A267 at its intersection with the A22 at the Boship roundabout and proceed north for approximately four miles, you will find the crematorium entrance on the left just before you reach Horam village.\n\nApproaching from the north:\n\nJoin the A267 south of Tunbridge Wells (at Cross in Hand if approaching from Uckfield or Heathfield directions) and continue south through the village of Horam. The crematorium entrance is approximately half a mile further on the right hand side, soon after the May Garland public house.\n\nWe have plenty of parking for 160 vehicles and a waiting room and toilets for your convenience."
