        "text": "We regret to say that, due to health and safety issues, there will be no access to the Horam Manor Farm woodlands and nature trails which are usually open around Easter, until further notice.\n\nThis is because of the presence in these woods of the disease known as Ash Die Back (Chalara Fraxinea), which causes the infected trees to drop branches at any time, which is dangerous for anyone in the vicinity. We are working on a programme of removing the infected trees, but in itself this can be a difficult and sometimes dangerous task and will take some time.\n\nPlease help protect the woodlands by staying out of the walks and woods beyond the gates with closed signs on and so not spreading this disease.\n\nHoram Manor Farm is in the village of Horam, on the A267 between Tunbridge Wells and Eastbourne. You can find us easily. Driving south to Horam on the A267, turn right at the signposted entrance to “Horam Manor Farm”. Follow the access road past the caravan site until you arrive at the Fishery car park between the small nursery pond and “House Pond”. Driving from Eastbourne, take the A267 at the Boship Farm Roundabout and follow the road (about five minutes). Look for the Horam Manor Farm signpost and entrance on the left as you enter Horam Village.\n\nWe welcome dog walkers on the farm and have some fantastic paths and views for you to enjoy.\n\nHoram Manor Farm is private property anyone walking on it other than to visit one of the businesses or the Nature Trails needs to register by filling out this easy form below.\n\nIn the seventeenth century the estate was owned by the Dyke family, who moved to Lullingstone Castle when one of the sons married the daughter of Sir Percival Hart. The Hart Dyke family continued to own Horeham Manor, as it was then called, until the manor house sadly burnt down after the Second World War. The site of the manor house was used by the Merrydown Wine Company from 1946 until 2005.\n\nHoram Manor Farm was by then a separate estate. It was farmed by Lady Garbitt until the farm was taken over by the War Office in WW2, to grow much needed produce for the war effort.\n\nIn 1958 the farm was bought by Major Goulden at auction and has remained in the family ever since.\n\nIn the 16th Century Horam Manor Farm was an important site of the Tudor Iron Industry. The open mining for iron ore, the furnaces and the hammer ponds which provided energy for them have shaped the local countryside.\n\nThe old sandstone farmhouse is thought to have been originally connected to theSussex Iron Industry. Carvings on the window lintel of the original stone building suggest it was used as an office for the industry as early as 1560.\n\nThe farmhouse formed part of the Horam Manor Estate and can be seen clearly in the 18th century print below, now in the British Museum."
