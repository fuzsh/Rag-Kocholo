        "text": "A local group in Horam are running a Crowdfunder campaign to raise some funding for a pumptrack at Horam Recreation Ground.\n\nOn Sunday 2 June Davina’s Big Sussex Bike Ride left Uckfield with Horam Recreation Ground as a pit stop, this allowed the cyclists to see the newly installed all-weather path around the recreation which is phrase one of their GAP – Get Active Project. Cyclists were also able to see the plans and show support for phrase two, which will be an asphalt track approximately 100m in length. This track will welcome all abilities, challenging experienced riders and a safe area for beginners to use a BMX, scooters and skateboard pumptrack. The group are applying to large grant funders, but the trustees of Horam Recreation Ground have also decided to pursue as many funding opportunities as they can and have set up a Crowdfunder page with a target to raise £10,000 towards the cost of the Phase Two of the track.\n\nIn the photo, the British Road Race Champion Pheiffer Georgi shows her support for the fundraising campaign.\n\nIf anyone would like to donate they can visit Crowdfunder and make a contribution – however small!\n\nFeatured Business - Heathfield\n\nThorpe Gardens\n\nEstablished in 1955 by the Dutch de Bruin family, Thorpe Gardens is known locally for their high-quality local produce and wide variety of specialty plants. Drawing on the experience of three generations, the retail nursery has brought colour and life into thousands of Sussex gardens over the last 69 years. Trading as a retail nursery, rather than as a garden centre, you can expect to find more plants and trees than cake and teas, and the passion for horticulture is integral to the business. You can always find a wide selection of plants available to integrate into your garden ready for the next season, many of which are grown locally, if not on the premises. We grow an extensive catalogue of plants and trees,. Thorpe Gardens: “We Grow and Sell”."
