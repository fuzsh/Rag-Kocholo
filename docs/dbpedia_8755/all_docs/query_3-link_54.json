Once a site of the Wealdon iron industry, the Farm offers a wide range of habitats, including open grassland, meadows, ancient woodlands, streams and Tudor hammer ponds.\n\nThe Cartlodge is a 500 year old beautifully restored barn set in the rural Sussex countryside. The Cartlodge is available for hire for one off events such as weddings, parties and wakes, meetings, exhibitions and workshops as well as for regular sessions such as art classes and exercise classes. Full of atmosphere, the Cartlodge has modern facilities, ample parking and is fully accessible for wheelchair users.\n\nAs well as the Cafe, Fishery and Stables the Farmyard is home to a cluster of converted barns and stables that house small artisan businesses such as a florist, art studio, jeweller, papermaker, potter and more!"
