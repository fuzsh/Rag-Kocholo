        "text": "Rights of Way in Horam Parish (Wealden, East Sussex)\n\nThis page shows a map and table of the Public Rights of Way (Public Footpaths, Bridleways, Restricted Byways, and Byways Open to All Traffic) in the parish/area of Horam, in the district of Wealden, in the county of East Sussex. Data from the Surveying Authority (East Sussex ) is compared with the data in OpenStreetMap. (more information)\n\nOSM Map | PRoW GIS Data (GeoJSON)\n\nTable Details: To be counted in the table above, OSM ways need to be tagged with an appropriate designation=* tag (one of public_footpath, public_bridleway, restricted_byway, byway_open_to_all_traffic) and the relevant prow_ref=* tag (in the form 'Horam XX 12a', where XX is one of FP, BR, RB, BY; and 12 is the route number, and a is an optional suffix letter). The Definitive Statement data and OSM Mapping Statuses have not been imported yet for this parish. This needs to be done manually, and there is no public interface for it yet.\n\nMap Details: On the map, the Yellow (FP), Blue (BR), Magenta (RB) and Red (BY) lines are Rights of Way from official Council data from 2023‑07‑18, licensed under the Open Government Licence (v3) (full copyright details). Routes whose length lines between −5m + 95% and 15m + 105% of the official length are shown with thin lines; the rest are shown with thick lines. The Green lines are different Highways from OSM: Dark Green for unclassified Highways, Blue-Green for Public Cycleways, and Yellow-Green for Adopted Footways. Click on any of these lines for more information. The black lines are approximate modern parish boundaries, constructed by simplifying the polygons in OS Boundary Line. The underlying mapping is OSM Carto (key). Click inside another parish for a link to switch to that parish.\n\nUse of data in OSM: The Rights of Way GIS data shown on the map above is suitably licenced to be used in OpenStreetMap. If doing so, please use the source tag east_sussex_county_council_prow_gis_data. But please do not map Rights of Way just from this data; it is important that OSM reflects what is on the ground as well. Official Rights of Way are not always usable on the ground, and the paths on the ground do not always follow the Definitive Line. The PRoW GIS data (and Definitive Statements, where available and suitably licenced) should be used primarily to add appropriate PRoW tags to ways that have already been mapped from other sources such as aerial imagery (where paths and tracks can clearly been seen) or ground surveys.\n\nErrors and omissions in PRoW tags\n\nOSM ways found in or near the parish with incomplete or contradictory designation=* or prow_ref=* tags. Further details.\n\nErrors and omissions in access tags\n\nOSM ways with missing or inconsistent modal access tags are listed below. The classes of Public Rights of Way and Highways included on the map are checked, but Rights of Way with other tagging issues already listed above are excluded. Further details.\n\nNo issues found in this parish."
