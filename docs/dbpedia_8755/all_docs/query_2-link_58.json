        "text": "Great Easterfields is an historic Wealden farmhouse on Chiddingly Road in Horam, East Sussex. The building dates back to at least the 1600s, and although it was extended and altered in the 1970s, it retains a number of important historical architectural features, such as the original chimney and inglenook fireplace (with bread oven) which is a feature of the living room. There are many surviving original beams and rare wattle and daub walls, and much of the original roof structure is unchanged. Sadly, Great Easterfields is threatened with demolition (to be replaced by nine new dwellings.) It should be Listed at Grade II, but has been overlooked. We have applied to Historic England for Great Easterfields to be assessed for Listing and the result of the assessment taken into consideration by the Wealden District planners.\n\nIt is probable that the 2022 application for demolition and the building of nine houses on the site of Great Easterfields will be turned down because there would be too many for a small site with limited parking and access. However, any scaled-down application in 2023 is likely to include the demolition of Great Easterfields, which we feel should be opposed.\n\nHoram (formerly Horeham Road) grew up around the railway station in Victorian times, and very little of the original Horeham Manor House remains. There are, however, a few seventeenth century (and earlier) houses on the outskirts of the parish (towards Little London, at Maynards Green, Vines Cross and Marle Green). Great Easterfields is a rare survival in Horam.\n\nHoram is growing at an apparently exponential rate, with hundreds of new houses being built at multiple locations. We are not against building new houses, but to demolish Great Easterfields would be an act of historical and architectural vandalism."
