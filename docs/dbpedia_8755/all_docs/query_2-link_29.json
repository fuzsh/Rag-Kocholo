We specialise in experiential learning and mentoring, using the natural world as a key element in the process. We also see ourselves as environmental custodians of our beautiful 40-acre site in Horam, East Sussex.\n\nWe’re a Community Benefit Society (CBS), which means any profits we make are returned to the community organisation rather than being distributed among members or external shareholders. You can join our CBS by investing just £50 in shares. This gives you a direct say in our future and discounts on all our courses.

They are deeply immersed in all things nature connection. They have built incredible skills, knowledge and understanding of nature’s ways – fire making, plants and foraging, bird language, and so much more.\n\n“They feel so at home when they are at ESA. They are deeply inspired by their incredible mentors at Sacred Earth, who each bring such different gifts.\n\n“It is an utter delight to see my children unfolding and expanding in these ways, and I feel our whole family journey is so deeply enriched by our growing connection with nature.\n\n“Thank you from my heart for all that you give to the young people of today, who will be the ones taking our earth into the future – this gives me so much hope and inspiration.”\n\nTina.\n\nSaveSaveSaveSave\n\nSaveSaveSaveSave\n\nSaveSaveSaveSave\n\nSaveSave\n\nSave\n\nSaveSave\n\nSaveSave\n\nSaveSave\n\nSaveSave\n\nSaveSaveSaveSaveSaveSave\n\nSave\n\nSaveSave"
