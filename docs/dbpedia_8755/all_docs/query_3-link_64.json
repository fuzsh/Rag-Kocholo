He’ll be performing songs from all three of his solo albums, including The Show, which will be released by Capitol Records on June 9, 2023. the North American leg of Horan’s World Tour will kick off in May 2024 and will include a stop in Cincinnati, OH at Riverbend Music Center on Tuesday, June 25 with special guest Del Water Gap.\n\nA deeply felt meditation on everything from mental health to the infinite complexity and uncertainty of love, The Show is an endlessly spellbinding statement on following your heart to its absolute truth. The album is available for pre-order HERE. As he gears up to share his most personal material yet in a truly extraordinary career, Horan is particularly eager to return to the stage. On release day, Horan will perform in New York City as part of the Citi Summer Concert Series on TODAY. He’ll also be performing at festivals around the world this summer, including Boston Calling.\n\n“There’s nothing better than watching the crowd sing back to you with all that emotion on their faces and knowing that they’re attaching the song to something meaningful in their own lives,” says Niall Horan. “To me, that’s always the greatest thing that can ever come from songwriting.”\n\nHoran, who joined NBC’s The Voice” this season as a new coach, performed his new single “Meltdown” on the show last week. View his performance HERE.\n\nRolling Stone observed, “Unlike the optimistic pop songs that bury devastating lyrics beneath the sound of sunshine, ‘Meltdown’ keeps up an unrelenting pace that more so echos the heightened anxiety and panic Horan sings about.” Billboard noted, “’Meltdown’ finds Horan biting off a jumpy pop-rock production and swaggering through some ooo-ooo-ooo melodies; the heartbeat of the song is steady, and the singer-songwriter underlines the reliable pop presence that he was born to inhabit.”\n\nOriginally from Mullingar, Ireland, Horan has sold over 80 million records and toured the globe multiple times as part of the iconic One Direction. His full-length solo debut Flicker entered the Billboard 200 at No. 1 in October 2017 and contained the 3x RIAA Platinum single “Slow Hands” and the 2x RIAA Platinum “This Town.” The album hit the top 10 in 20 countries total. With combined global streams surpassing eight billion, Flicker has gone Platinum in five countries (including the U.S.) and Gold in additional seven countries. Heartbreak Weather followed in 2020 and topped the U.K.’s Official Albums chart and Billboard’s Top Album Sales tally."
