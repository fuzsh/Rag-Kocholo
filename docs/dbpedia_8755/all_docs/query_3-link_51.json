        "text": "Alan Rogers Review of Horam Manor Touring Park\n\nThis family run park is situated on a manor estate, perfect for touring East Sussex. The first field now offers level pitches throughout, all with 16A hook-ups and including 20 hardstandings. In total there are 100 spacious pitches, 65 with electricity. A brand new toilet block has underfloor heating, large showers, private washing cubicles and carefully designed facilities for those with reduced mobility. The park is set back from the main road and is a haven of peace and tranquillity, although in high season it becomes busy. For younger visitors there is a play area. On the manor estate, amenities include horse riding, fishing, the Lakeside Caf√© and peaceful walks through the woods.\n\nLocal buses serve all major towns in the area or you can bring your bike and explore the countryside on the Cuckoo Trail (2 minutes from the park). The village of Horam is nearby with a full range of shops and, of course, the local pub."
