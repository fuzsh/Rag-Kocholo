Improvements to the Cuckoo Trail form part of the UKSPF’s ‘Community and Place’ priority and to make sure this money is spent in the best way possible, a Cuckoo Trail masterplan has been created.\n\nThe Trail itself\n\nThe Cuckoo Trail is picturesque, mainly off-road route running for eleven miles from Polegate to Heathfield. There is a three-mile extension from Polegate to Shinewater Park, Eastbourne. The Trail follows the route of a disused railway track and is now well known nationally and forms part of the National Cycle Network (route 21) and Avenue Verte (London to Paris cycle route). Running through the heart of Wealden, it is a real asset to the district and supports active travel and sustainable options, supports communities, and provides an opportunity to encourage biodiversity along the route.\n\nSee just what the Cuckoo Trail has to offer by watching the video below:\n\nMasterplan Projects and Priorities\n\nA Cuckoo Trail masterplan was created to set out an approach to identify and deliver several projects, that could be delivered using UKSPF funding, along the eleven miles stretch of the Trail between Polegate and Heathfield. The masterplan is also closely aligned to the Cuckoo Trail strategy - adopted by Wealden District Council in July 2022. This strategy presents a vision for the Trail and sets out a number of priorities and projects that can be delivered by the Council working closely with key partners and can be viewed using the link across the page.\n\nThe masterplan consists of 3 themes which will create an approach, and several projects, that will help stitch together people, places & nature from Heathfield to Polegate and beyond.\n\nPeople\n\nPlace\n\nNature\n\nThere are several projects that have been identified along the Cuckoo Trail, many of which are being pritoritsed under the UKSPF:\n\nEastwell Bridge arts project was successfully completed in partnership with Hailsham Festival of Arts. £7,200 of Shared Prosperity funding was provided by Wealden District Council to support this project and improve the bridge which had suffered from graffiti for many years. Over 250 local artists submitted artwork to be included on the Eastwell Place Bridge, 77 pieces were selected and installed on the inner faces of the bridge. Over 150 people attended the unveiling.\n\nHoram station hub is at an ideal location along the Cuckoo Trail to have a ‘hub’ or meeting place. It is a large piece of land that offers the opportunity to meet friends and family, take a break after a long walk or cycle, and stroll around the remnants of the old Horam train station. The Council is currently working with industry experts to develop plans for the site. These may include a refreshment kiosk, landscaping improvements and enhancements to the existing historical features including the old railway platform and signs. Draft designs will be received in spring 2024. Once these are confirmed, the site improvements will commence and be completed by spring 2025.\n\nSignage and wayfinding are so important when navigating along the Trail, exploring heritage and history of the local area, and finding out about the amenities and attractions close by. A Signage and Wayfinding Strategy is currently being developed. This strategy will review the existing signage, provide design templates and principles to ensure consistency of signage along the length of the trail, improve accessibility of information and better reflect the history of the trail promoting the many fantastic amenities located nearby. Once the strategy is finalised, a timeline will be developed and the strategy delivered in 2024 and beyond, if required.\n\nHeathfield picnic area, plans are being developed to improve the accessibility and layout of the Heathfield picnic area. Improvements will include widening of both of the access paths, resurfacing sections to further improve accessibility and the installation of new furniture, including a wheelchair friendly picnic table. The works at this location aim to be complete by summer 2024.\n\nSummerhill outdoor gym will encourage people to move more and take full advantage of the many health and mental wellbeing benefits of being outdoors, the Summerhill Lane Linear Trail project looks to utilise the wide verges on the Hailsham to Polegate stretch of the trail. This stretch is ideal for many people as it is within easy walking distance of Hailsham and Polegate and provides an ideal location for an outdoor gym. The plans for this site include installing eleven pieces of outdoor gym equipment such as a balance beam, overhead ladder and sit up bench, along the 1.5km stretch between Summerhill Lane and Sayerland Lane.\n\nCuckoo Trail arts and heritage programme is being developed by the council, with several partners, with the aim of improving pride of place and a sense of ownership of the Trail. The activities will focus on engaging local residents, of all ages and abilities, along the trail. Locations to be confirmed but delivery will be focused where most need is identified. This programme will deliver a range of activities over the next twelve months and looks to include a celebratory event in March 2025 to commemorate the 145th anniversary of the formal opening of the Heathfield to Hailsham stretch of the Cuckoo line.\n\nVegetation enhancement and management opportunities to improve the biodiversity of the trail are currently being explored. Interventions to support wildlife and vegetation will mainly be delivered through the current Cuckoo Trail maintenance contract, however, where feasible, improvements to the biodiversity will be considered in the remaining SPF Cuckoo Trail projects and beyond.\n\nA green gym and series of health walks will be delivered along the Cuckoo Trail, commencing by summer 2024 and continuing until March 2025. It will be available, free of charge, for residents to take part in and will be a great way to meet new people, develop new skills and learn more about the local area. This programme aims to improve pride of place, sense of community ownership of the trail whilst helping to protect and enhance the sustainability of the trail.\n\nWe are interested in hearing your views. Whether you are a walker, runner, cyclist or horse rider that uses the Trail, we welcome your feedback on our exciting improvement plans.\n\nUse our ideas board below to tell us what you'd like to see happen, even add a photo to bring your idea to life!\n\nWealden District Council has been awarded funding from the UK Shared Prosperity Fund (UKSPF).
