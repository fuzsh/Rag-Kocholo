        "text": "On Friday 2nd July, Horam Park Golf Club hosted a golf day to raise awareness of Functional Neurological Disorder (FND), and raise funds for FND Action to support their plight in helping those who have been diagnosed.\n\nThis was instigated by Zoe Grimes because of her own personal journey with FND.\n\n“Our lives completely changed over night 22nd May 2020, when I had my first seizure and things escalated quickly.\n\nI said that I would like to help at least one person with this condition and spread more awareness. Even though I have a beautiful family I did feel isolated, embarrassed and confused when I got my diagnosis, and didn’t want anyone else to feel the same, that gave me strength.\n\nI shared my story on social media and BBC Southeast, and from that my husband’s friend Jamie wanted to help. He organised a golf day to raise money for FND Action, and so many people wanted to attend and donated a lot of prizes. I was actually really excited to join them for the raffle at the end of the golf day and to congratulate the golfers. It was a hot day but the golfers did so well and a high point was a gentleman said to me he had never heard of the condition before the golf day, and will go home and tell his wife and friends. That means the world to me.\n\nI have connected with so many people through this and its all through sharing my story. I’ve started an FND programme and managing my symptoms a lot better with some of my own techniques. I still have good and bad days, but trying to take a positive out of a negative situation. I didn’t feel that I could do that at times but I have and I know that other people can.\n\nYou are not alone.”"
