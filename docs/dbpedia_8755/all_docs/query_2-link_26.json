        "text": "Niall Horan and his girlfriend, Amelia Woolley, are still going strong.\n\nThough they were first linked in 2020, Horan and Woolley didn't make their public debut until September 2021, when they attended his Horan & Rose Gala.\n\nIn the time they've been together, the couple have kept their relationship private, but every now and then, the former One Direction singer shares a glimpse of their romance, especially when it comes to the love songs he writes.\n\nIn fact, Horan confirmed that the songs on his latest album, The Show, were written with her on his mind.\n\nApart from music, Horan and Woolley are seen out and about together, from attending concerts to taking in the F1 Grand Prix.\n\nSo who is Niall Horan's girlfriend? Here's everything to know about Amelia Woolley and her relationship with the singer.\n\nShe played hockey in high school\n\nAlthough she currently lives in London, Woolley grew up in Birmingham and attended Solihull School, a private school located in the West Midlands. Notable alumni include singer Philip Oakey of '80s pop band the Human League and journalist and Top Gear presenter Richard Hammond.\n\nAccording to Solihull School's reports and achievements from 2010 to 2011, Woolley took part in sporting activities as a student. A keen hockey player, she was a member of the Birmingham & West Midlands U15 Training Squad.\n\nWhile at Solihull, Woolley also studied English literature, business studies and psychology.\n\nShe worked in the fashion industry\n\nWoolley studied fashion business at Istituto Marangoni, according to LinkedIn. While she is now an account manager at Budweiser Brewing Group, she was previously a commercial executive for luxury shoe designer Nicholas Kirkwood.\n\nShe's also worked at several other fashion labels throughout her career. Woolley has held roles at Dior, Chloé, ASOS and startup menswear brand Prevu Studio, to name a few.\n\nShe and Horan made their public debut at a charity event\n\nThey made their first official public appearance in September 2021, at Horan's charity gala, the Horan & Rose Gala, at The Grove Hotel in Hertfordshire, England. Woolley shared a photo of the two posing side-by-side at the event on Instagram with brown heart and wilting rose emojis as the caption.\n\nThe former One Direction singer helped to raise over 800,000 euros for charity at the event alongside professional golfer Justin Rose, according to Irish outlet Sunday World.\n\nShe inspired several songs on Horan's album The Show\n\nWhile chatting with ET Canada in June 2023, Horan shared that Woolley inspired the love songs on his album The Show.\n\n\"She’s like, taken aback, I suppose,\" he said when asked how his girlfriend initially reacted to being his muse. \"Usually, the love songs are heartbreak songs, so it’s nice to be able to write better, you know, happier stuff.”\n\nShe and Horan attend events together\n\nHoran and Woolley were photographed at the French Formula One Grand Prix in July 2022. Adorning VIP lanyards and watching the action from the sidelines, the pair stood among Lewis Hamilton's Mercedes team.\n\nThe previous month, in June 2022, Horan and Woolley were spotted at Horan's former bandmate Harry Styles' concert. Styles played at Wembley Stadium in London as part of his U.K. and European Love on Tour leg, and fans were quick to spot the couple in the crowd.\n\nShe and Horan are a private couple\n\nWhile doing press for his album The Show, Horan spoke publicly for the first time about his relationship with Woolley.\n\n\"That's dead right,\" he told Bustle when asked if he would consider himself to be \"madly in love.\"\n\nThe singer went on to explain why he chooses to keep his relationship extremely private.\n\n\"If everyone knew everything, [my songwriting] wouldn’t be as candid, would it?” he said. “There’d be all these theories, and I’m not in town for that. I’m here to write what’s on my brain, and love happens to be one of those things that’s flying around me.”"
