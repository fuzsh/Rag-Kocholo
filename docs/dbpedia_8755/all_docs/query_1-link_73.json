At the same time, he draws a passenger plane to take all his friends and fly. His friends are supposed to count the lines of the airplanes that pass over their village for him, and the children's fight over dividing the lines angers Horam, and he decides to let everyone off, even Shahu, who is his close friend and assistant. Children also make fun of him and curse him."
