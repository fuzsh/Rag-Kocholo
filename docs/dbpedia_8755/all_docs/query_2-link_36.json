We particularly loved looking out on the lambs in the field in front. Plenty of the attendees mentioned that they'd like to bring their own families along. Only two things that could have improved out stay: 1. A toast rack!, and 2. Instructions on how to change the central heating temperature set-point - it was set to 21 degrees and we were very warm and couldn't find anything in the welcome information about how to unlock the heating panels.\n\nThank you very much for your lovely feedback, we're delighted you enjoyed your stay, accommodation and the views to our paddocks with young lambs! Thank you also for your two suggestions, very helpful to us and easily done, we shall action these straight away!

The house has been built and decorated to a very high standard, they have every device, utensil and price of equipment you could possibly need. The house is set in beautiful surrounding and we enjoyed a walk in their woodland. The games room was a huge hit with the children. All in all, A little piece of heaven in the sussex countryside.\n\nThank you so much for the great feedback. As our first guests it was a delight to have such a lovely family staying and enjoying the property and grounds. Property Owner\n\nReviewed by Robert5.0â˜…Jul 2022"
