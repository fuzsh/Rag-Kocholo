        "text": "Thought to date from the 16th century, with later additions, this extended and renovated Grade II listed house exudes charm and great character inside and out, occupying an excellent position on its own land, raised up and away from neighbours. The property is also supported by a range of useful ancillary buildings, including the detached one bedroom cottage and quality stabling, together with a generous land holding of gardens and grounds, ancient woodland and paddocks, giving the feel of a mini country estate.\n\nThe Furnace is thought to be the former Ironmasters house, and is the site of the original Waldron Furnace . The blast furnace began operation by 1560 and continued for some 200 years. It smelted locally sourced iron ore with charcoal sourced from the ancient woodland to make cast iron, cannon balls and later, guns. It is believed that The Furnace was owned by the prominent Pelham family until the 18th century.\n\nFeatures inside include exposed brick and natural oak stud work, together with beamed ceilings and polished oak flooring. There is also a variety of attractive fireplaces, some fitted with wood burning stoves. The bathrooms are modern and well appointed, the majority of fittings by Chadder & Co with some also benefitting from electric under floor heating, while the kitchen/dining room is an exceptional space and design, focused around a large recessed Lacanche range cooker and fitted with bespoke, painted Chalon base cupboards and a very large Maple topped island unit, all finished in a combination of timber, topped with marble worksurfaces. This room, combines with the modern garden room through a wide opening, creating an overall length of approximately 46 feet, making for an exceptional informal, family living space. Both these areas benefit from central heating under the extensive tiled limestone flooring and the garden room takes full advantage of the fine views over the grounds through oak, full height windows and triple sliding doors, which open out onto the rear terracing.\n\nOutside, the gated drive approach leads up from the lower garden and grounds to the house, past the cottage and the orchard planted with rare varieties of English Apple and Pear, up to a turning circle and large garage. Mature specimen trees here form a wonderful park-like setting and include an impressive mature oak to the turning circle, a prominent weeping pear, large Magnolia, Japanese Maple and a fine mature mulberry tree. There is also wisteria over part of the house and beyond the terrace to the rear, there is a feature boxed hedge parterre, which is shielded on the flank by an impressive row of pleached lime trees.\n\nThe six paddocks are a short distance from the impressive Oak framed stable block and have access to water and three of them have field shelters. They are also serviced by a separate road access in from the lane.\n\nThe ancient woodland leads off from the garden and paddocks, with about 15 acres, made up of Hornbeam and Ash coppice with a large number of Oak standards. The woodland makes for delightful private walking or riding, with a network of pathways and complete with a large secluded pond. There is also a wood store and another gated lane access, complete with a generous hard standing area for heavy vehicle access.\n\nAt the entrance, on the lower front, there is an extensive, picturesque pond fed by three streams, with the tennis court beyond here. This front area has a footpath running through the land as illustrated on our site plan. However, the main garden behind the house, onto the woodland and paddocks is all private.\n\nView payable Stamp Duty for this property"
