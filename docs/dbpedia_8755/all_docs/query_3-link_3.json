        "text": "American soccer player (born 1994)\n\nLindsey Michelle Horan ( hə-RAN; born May 26, 1994)[2] is an American professional soccer player who plays as a midfielder for Première Ligue club Lyon and captains the United States national team.\n\nShe previously played for the Portland Thorns FC of the National Women's Soccer League (NWSL), the highest division of women's professional soccer in the United States, and won the league's most valuable player award in 2018. Horan was a leading player for the Thorns during their 2017 championship season, scoring the winning goal in the championship game. Before that, she was a prolific scorer for Paris Saint-Germain, scoring 46 goals in 58 appearances.\n\nShe is currently the captain of the US Women's National Team. She was the leading scorer for the United States U-17 team at the 2010 CONCACAF U-17 Women's Championship.[3][4][5] She was on the team that won the 2019 FIFA Women's World Cup, won bronze at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, and captained the team to win gold at the 2024 Paris Olympics.\n\nEarly life\n\n[edit]\n\nHoran was born May 26, 1994, and grew up in Golden, Colorado, near Denver. Although she attended Golden High School, she did not play soccer for the school. Instead, she played club soccer with the Colorado Rush. She first started playing for the Colorado Edge during the U-11 tryouts. In March, when Horan was 15 years old and was one of the youngest players on the United States under-17 women's national team, she scored 12 goals in nine games (a team best) leading up to the North American/Central American/Caribbean U-17 tournament in Costa Rica. During her sophomore year at Golden, she was named to the Parade Magazine High School All-American team although she didn't play high school soccer.[6][7]\n\nIn 2012, Horan was named the top-ranked college prospect by ESPN.[8] Although she had a scholarship to play for Tar Heels of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill starting in the 2012 season, Horan bypassed her college career and signed with French club Paris Saint-Germain FC (PSG).[9]\n\nClub career\n\n[edit]\n\nColorado Rush, 2012\n\n[edit]\n\nHoran played for the Colorado Rush in the 2012 USL W-League season.[10] She played three games for the team, scoring two goals and taking 19 shots.[11] Her performance for the Rush against Seattle Sounders Women on June 1, 2012, in which Horan scored a goal against Seattle and USWNT goalkeeper Hope Solo,[12] impressed several national team players who also played for Seattle. After the match, Megan Rapinoe called Horan \"a hell of a player\".[13]\n\nParis Saint-Germain FC, 2012–2016\n\n[edit]\n\nIn July 2012, Horan signed a six-figure deal to play with the professional French club, Paris Saint-Germain FC (PSG).[14][15] On January 4, 2016, Paris Saint-Germain announced Horan's contract had been terminated to allow her to return to the United States.[16] She played her final game on December 5, 2015, a 5–0 win over FCF Juvisy. Horan scored the match's opening goal.[17] Horan scored 46 goals in 58 appearances for PSG.\n\nPortland Thorns, 2016–2022\n\n[edit]\n\nOn January 13, 2016, Horan signed with the Portland Thorns FC of the NWSL.[18]\n\nUnlike her role at PSG, Horan for Portland played in central midfield in a position similar to her national-team role.[19]\n\nHoran scored the only goal in Portland's 1–0 win over the North Carolina Courage in the 2017 NWSL Championship and was named NWSL Championship MVP.[20]\n\nHoran was named Player of the Month for July 2018, in which she scored three goals to help the Thorns to a 3–0–0 record.[21] She was named to the 2018 NWSL Best XI, and on September 21, 2018, she was named 2018 NWSL Most Valuable Player.[22]\n\nIn 2020, she was a key player in helping Thorns win the Fall Series and the associated Community Shield, and in 2021, did the same for the Thorns' winning the NWSL Challenge Cup, the Women's International Champions Cup, and the NWSL Shield.[citation needed]\n\nOn June 22, 2023, the Thorns permanently transferred Horan to Lyon[23] for a fee of €250,000 (US$274,000) with a conditional bonus of an additional €50,000 (US$54,750).[24]\n\nLyon Féminin, 2022–present\n\n[edit]\n\nOn January 27, 2022, Horan joined Olympique Lyon on loan.[25] With Lyon, she scored 8 goals in 37 appearances, won the Division 1 Féminine league twice, the Coupe de France Feminine, and the UEFA Women's Champions League. On June 22, 2023, Lyon signed Horan to a permanent contract through June 2026.[23] On October 14, 2023, Horan scored her first hat-trick for Lyon against Division 1 team AS Saint-Étienne.[26]\n\nInternational career\n\n[edit]\n\nHoran played for the United States women's national under-17 soccer team and was the leading scorer for the team at the 2010 CONCACAF Women's U-17 Championship.[3] She helped the United States women's national under-20 soccer team win the 2012 CONCACAF Women's U-20 Championship in March by scoring four goals, including a hat trick against Guatemala in the group stage. Horan was unable to play in the 2012 FIFA U-20 Women's World Cup because of a knee injury that required surgery.[15]\n\nIn February 2013, at the age of eighteen, she was named to the senior team roster for the 2013 Algarve Cup.[27] She earned her first cap for the senior team during a group stage match against China at the Algarve on March 8, 2013.[28] Horan was called up to the senior roster near the end of 2015,[29] and scored her first goal for the senior team during a 'Woman of the Match' performance against Trinidad & Tobago in December 2015. She is on the roster for the 2016 CONCACAF Women's Olympic Qualifying Championship and started the opening group stage match against Costa Rica in central midfield.\n\nWhile Horan played successfully as a striker during her time at PSG, with 46 goals in 56 appearances, she played in central midfield after her return to the national team in 2016.\n\nHoran was called up for the 2019 FIFA Women's World Cup, scoring her first World Cup goal in the opening game against Thailand on June 11. On January 31, 2020, she scored her first career hat-trick against Panama in the 2020 CONCACAF Women's Olympic Qualifying Championship in addition to assisting goals scored by Lynn Williams and Tobin Heath.[m 1]\n\nOn July 24, 2021, Horan played her 100th match for USWNT, and scored a goal in a 6–1 win over New Zealand in the 2020 Summer Olympics.[30]\n\nAt the 2023 FIFA Women's World Cup, Horan scored in the U.S.'s opening match against Vietnam.[31] This gave her goals in successive World Cups. Horan also scored in the U.S.'s match against the Netherlands, tying the game 1-1.[32]\n\nHoran was selected to the 18-player roster for the 2024 Summer Olympics in France.[33] The United States defeated Brazil 1–0 in the final on a goal from Mallory Swanson.[34]\n\nPersonal life\n\n[edit]\n\nIn June 2023, she announced her engagement to Tyler Heaps.[35]\n\nCareer statistics\n\n[edit]\n\nClub\n\n[edit]\n\nAs of January 14, 2024\n\nClub Season League Cup[a] Continental[b] Total Ref.
