Carillon Historical Park is a 65-acre park and museum in Dayton, which contains historic buildings and exhibits concerning the history of technology and the Dayton Metropolitan Area from 1796 to the present. The historical elements of the park were the brainchild of Colonel Edward Deeds, president of the National Cash Register Company. They are overseen by the University of Dayton.

Many of the park's main attractions are a part of the outdoor, or open-air, museum display, which places a number of relocated historic structures side-by-side.

An important, and nationally-significant draw to Carillon Historical Park is the Wright Brothers Aviation Center. Wright Hall of this unit of the park, houses the Wright Flyer III, which was designated a National Historic Landmark and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1990.

In 2005, Carillon Historical Park merged with the Montgomery County Historical Society to form Dayton History.
