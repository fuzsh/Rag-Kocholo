The Carillon Historical Park is named for the 151-foot-tall Deeds Carillon. Colonel Edward Deeds, in whose name the tower was built, was a Dayton industrialist and innovator who was president of the National Cash Register Company. The Art Moderne tower was built in 1942 and designed by New York architects Reinhard & Hofmeister. It was funded by Edward Deeds' wife Edith Walton Deeds and was designed to commemorate the Deeds family. When the tower was built, each of the 23 bells was inscribed with the name of a family member. Today, with 57 bells, the carillon is Ohio's largest. The National Park Service listed the Deeds Carillon on the National Register of Historic Places in 2005.
