First off the Large white Pavilion has had many things added and felt lost when going inside, A guide named Sharon and I talked about the wonderful city Dayton had been over the years and the accomplishments,inventions, and industry created here. Told her about this website and she seemed familiar with it. She asked if I would like to see a 20 min. program and told her it sounded great. Wow was I impressed. Five of our most famous citizens were in life size animation and telling telling their part in making Dayton and their friendship with one another. John Patterson, Orville and Wilbur,Deeds and sorry to say the fifth slipped my mind. It was pushing five and rooms were set up for what looked like a wondeul dinner about to get started. Can't wait to return and view the many things yet to see and also want to tour the old buildings as new ones have been added in the park. There's been a lot of expense in preserving our history and they now have hundreds of NCR cash registers in every style imaginable. It was such a wonderful few hrs. and hope many of you find the time to visit also. trolleyfan\n\n152 posts\n\nApr 24, 2015\n\n6:28 PM I think Charles Kettering is the 5th one LMD. I went there a couple years ago and was very impressed. You need to see it all, but the transportation museum was pretty cool. KennyE11\n\n306 posts\n\nApr 25, 2015\n\n12:32 AM One of the most incredible museum experiences I've had was my visit at The Heritage Center of Dayton Manufacturing & Entrepreneurship. I've mentioned this visit on other posts on this blog, but I can't stress enough that any visitors to Carillon Historical Park need to tour this facility. As LMD noted, the NCR cash register display is amazingly ornate and incredibly aesthetically pleasing. I found it interesting that the \"We Progress Through Change\" program LMD mentioned featured an elderly John Patterson, Col. Deeds and Charles Kettering, while Orville and Wilbur were much younger - I suppose this made sense considering that Wilbur died relatively young (excellent animatronics, very lifelike). As you continue through the museum, you have another animatronic encounter with a younger version of Kettering, then you proceed into the GM portion of the museum. Throughout the museum, I was amazed at all of the inventions that occurred in Dayton (that I wasn't aware of), but I eventually became somewhat depressed when I realized all of the lost jobs that were represented by all of the defunct (or relocated) businesses represented therein.\n\nThe rest of the park is amazing as well. We had to return for a second day to take it all in. It had changed a lot from the park that I had last visited 30 (or more) years earlier. The building housing the 1913 Flood display was very informative, including the weather \"broadcast\" by the local news team. There have been a lot of changes at the Wright Brothers Aviation Center, which is part of the Dayton Aviation Heritage National Historical Park. And much, much more.\n\nI encourage all of you that obviously are interested in Dayton history (or you wouldn't be reading this blog) to make time to visit the Carillon Historical Park, especially if you still live in the Dayton area. trolleyfan\n\n153 posts\n\nApr 25, 2015\n\n4:23 AM I grew up in Dayton going to Carillon Park, but in those days, there wasn't much there other than the Lock, the 0-4-0 Steam Engine and a few other things on display, then I went maybe 40 years or more without seeing it. In 2009, my Father passed away, so we came home to bury him down in Bellbrook. The next day we decided to visit Carillon Park and boy was I amazed. Obviously, Delco was a Dayton Company,(Dayton Electric Co), there was an automobile made in Dayton, although it didn't last but a few years, and you had three of the smartest Inventors and Industrialists of the time in Patterson, Deeds, And Kettering, so my perception is, and I think I'm correct in saying, Dayton came within a cat's hair of becoming the home of General Motors. The main reason I understand they went to Detroit was Detroit was on the lake and it would be easier to ship things in and out. I still know where it started and that is Good Ole Dayton, The city that most of us who come to this blog is very proud to call our Home. historybuff\n\n304 posts\n\nApr 25, 2015\n\n6:50 AM trolleyfan was partially right about Delco. Kettering and Deeds while still working at NCR for John Patterson, invented an improved ignition system and got a patent on it before Delco was incorporated. The reason they offered it to Henry Leland of Cadillac was because Cadillac Motorcar Company was the premier automobile manufacturer at that time. Leland was impressed with their ignition system and ordered 8000 sets on the spot for the next year’s Cadillac models. That presented them with a problem as all they had was the Deed’s Barn workshop. That’s when they started Delco(Dayton Engineering Laboratories Company). After the success of the improved ignition system, they then invented the self-starter for the 1912 Cadillac. Long story short, Delco became quite successful in the next few years, and GM wanted to hire Kettering to head up GM’s engineering and research efforts. Contrary to our more recent and modern-day company CEOs, Kettering would not leave Dayton or Delco. So to get Kettering, GM offered to buy Delco from Deeds and Kettering and make it a division of GM which they did. Kettering became Vice-President of GM in 1920 and stayed with GM until his retirement in 1947. I am sure that Kettering was very influential in the locating of many of the GM divisions here in Dayton. He never moved to Detroit, but maintained his home at Ridgeleigh Terrace(which is still here), and commuted to Detroit his whole career, staying in a hotel when he went to Detroit. One thing to observe when visiting Carillon Park is that the Deed’s Barn in the Heritage Center is the actual original barn that was at Deed’s home at 319 Central Avenue in Dayton. The news currently is that a movie is being made of the Wright Brothers. Maybe someday a movie will be made of Patterson, Deeds and Kettering which would be a great story of Dayton’s industrial history.

When I was growing up, all I heard about was NCR for obvious resons, and Sheffield Tool & Gage because my Dad worked there. I had no idea about all the Automotive and other business that put Dayton on the map. My understanding was that Frigidaire and Inland Box were also part of GM. historybuff\n\n305 posts\n\nApr 26, 2015\n\n5:37 AM trolleyfan, if you haven’t seen it yet, take a look on U-tube at the video, “Where the Rivers Meet”. Since you are a fan of Dayton, I think you would enjoy it, as it shows a lot of Dayton landscapes….. trolleyfan\n\n157 posts\n\nApr 26, 2015\n\n6:02 AM Will do Historybuff. And Thank You. historybuff\n\n307 posts\n\nApr 27, 2015\n\n5:10 AM Trolley, I’m sure you figured it out, but there are two titles called \"Where the Rivers Meet”. The one featuring Dayton is titled “Where the Rivers Meet; Playing for Change”. Good enjoying……... blue J\n\n158 posts\n\nApr 27, 2015\n\n12:43 PM I just watched that YouTube video mentioned above, and was pleased to see that it is actually a music video, and that hey, I know some of those people! :) trolleyfan\n\n158 posts\n\nApr 27, 2015\n\n5:50 PM That was really cool HB. I recognized some of the places from growing up in Dayton, but they sure look different. The music was great. When I was playing music in the 60's there were a lot of good musicans in the town, but now it looks like there are even more. Thanks for the tip HB. I really enjoyed that. historybuff\n\n311 posts\n\nApr 27, 2015\n\n9:56 PM I’m glad you enjoyed the video, trolley, or I guess I should have said “music video”. TNX to blue J for clarifying that. I guess as an “Old Fogie”, I’m not up on all the latest media terms :). BTW, that group has another music video, if you didn’t see it; “Where there is love”. I think you would enjoy that also. They also appear at Jay’s Restaurant in the Oregon District every first Friday of the month at 9:00. That would be this Friday, May 1st. Maybe I’ll see you there…."
