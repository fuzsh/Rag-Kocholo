        "text": "Since 1936, The Guild of Carillonneurs in North America has been a leading promoter and educator of the carillon art in both North America and the world. At our organizationâ€™s founding, our charter members met to define its original \"aims and objects.\" They wrote:\n\nTo foster carillon music in North America\n\nTo exchange between carillonneurs, who usually are handicapped by a distance one from another, useful information in developing and popularizing their art\n\nTo give carillonneurs, and the public, the advantage of hearing different styles of playing\n\nTo find out the most practical layout of the keyboard, and the most useful conventions of musical notation, and to recommend their standardization\n\nTo circulate music for the carillon, to encourage original composition, and to be available for advice on arranging\n\nTo stimulate the use of the carillon in places where instruments and sites are good, and to advise on locations so as to avoid the establishment of carillons which cannot be used, or cannot be heard enough to justify their installation\n\nTo stand as an autonomous body qualified to advise on all questions concerning the carillon\n\nTo maintain contacts for those interested in the carillon, with carillon organizations, carillonneurs, makers, and directors of carillons throughout the world\n\nOur charter members in Ottawa, 1936\n\n2021\n\nWe expanded our suite of grant programs, adding\n\nGrants to support emerging artists with educational opportunities as well as the equipment and tools necessary to obtain the experience to establish themselves professionally.\n\nGrants for regional gatherings in the fall and winter, which enable more face-to-face connections between our members than just our annual congress.\n\nGrants for student pairs to collaboratively compose and perform a new work for carillon."
