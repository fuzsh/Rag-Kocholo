        "text": "Listening to the carillon, which has been played here since 1927, is a bit like time traveling. Tracing back to the European low countries in the 16th century, the historic instrument was installed here as a gift from the class of 1892. Its 35 concert-pitch bells, which range in weight from 14 to 12,880 pounds, have become synonymous with Cleveland Tower.\n\nConsidered the largest musical instrument in the world, a carillon consists of a series of at least 23 tuned bells, played from a keyboard that allows expressiveness through variation in touch, and on which the player, or carillonneur, can play a broad range of music—from arrangements of popular and classical music to original compositions.\n\nLisa J. Lonie, University Carillonneur\n\nIn September 2012, Princeton University named its 4th University Carillonneur, Lisa J. Lonie. She is the first female to hold the position in the carillon’s +85 year history.\n\nLisa began her carillon studies as a teenager with Frank Law, carillonneur at the Washington Memorial National Carillon in Valley Forge, PA. She is a member of the Guild of Carillonneurs in North America (GCNA), former juror and chair of the Carillonneur Examinations Committee, and has served on its Board of Directors. She currently serves on the Music Heritage committee of the GCNA. Lisa is also the carillonneur at St. Thomas' Church, Whitemarsh (Pennsylvania), and at The Church of the Holy Trinity (Philadelphia) which houses the oldest carillon (1882) in North America. She’s a regional carillon instructor for the North American Carillon School, an affiliate of The Royal Carillon School “Jef Denyn” of Mechelen, Belgium.\n\nKnown for her musical wit and creative programming, Lisa has performed in internationally acclaimed carillon festivals, conferences, and several national congresses of the GCNA. She is one of the featured performers on the CD recording, “Princeton Carillon, Class of 1892” and was on the NBC television special \"Ringing in the Holidays at Longwood Gardens.\" More than 5,000 copies of her CD, The Bells of Christmas at Longwood Gardens, have been sold.\n\nLisa is a graduate of the Pennsylvania State University with dual degrees in German and Economics. Beyond her musical interests, she is Executive Assistant to the President of Salus University."
