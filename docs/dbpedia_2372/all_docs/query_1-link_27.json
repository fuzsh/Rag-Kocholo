At 6:30 a.m., with the sun rising from behind Ohio’s largest carillon, NCR organist Robert Kline entered the carillon console of the 151-foot limestone tower to herald the dawn of Easter Sunday. Amongst the swelling crowd were Carillon Historical Park founders Edward A. and Edith Walton Deeds.\n\nFor years on end, the Easter Sunrise Service has continued.
