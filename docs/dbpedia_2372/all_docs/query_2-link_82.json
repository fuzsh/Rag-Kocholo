It includes some tiny photos and a very small amount of information about the carillon.\n\nNews article on the new carillonneur\n\nPublicity article, with video (1:15) and some interesting historical photos. Unfortunately, the autoplaying video merely repeats photos with subtitles from the text, and the choice of bell music as a background is very odd.\n\nWaymarking page, with tower photo\n\nWhere the initial phase of this work lies in the sequence of output of the Meneely (Troy) bellfoundry.\n\nWhere the second phase of this work lies in the sequence of output of the vanBergen bellfoundry, in this region and in the world.\n\nWhere the third phase of this work lies in the sequence of output of the vanBergen bellfoundry, in this region and in the world.\n\nWhere the fourth phase of this work lies in the sequence of output of the Petit & Fritsen bellfoundry, in this region and in the world.\n\nWhere the final phase of this work lies in the sequence of output of the Petit & Fritsen bellfoundry, in this region and in the world.\n\nRanking among all North American traditional carillons by weight.\n\nRanking among all North American traditional carillons by size (number of bells).\n\nRanking among all North American concert class carillons by year of completion.\n\nOther concert carillons with similar keyboard ranges.\n\nWhy the first instrument in this tower was a milestone in North American non-traditional carillon history (1942).\n\nIndex to all traditional carillons in OH."
