        "text": "The Carillon neighborhood is another of Richmond’s historic districts and gained recognition when it was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2015. Positioned on the northern side of the James River, it is bordered by Byrd Park, Powhite Parkway, and the Downtown Expressway. This location ensures easy access to several popular city neighborhoods, dining destinations, retail hubs, and numerous outdoor recreational activities.\n\nMuch like many other parts of Richmond, the land that now comprises the Carillon neighborhood was originally owned by William Byrd II until his passing in 1744. Over the next approximately 150 years, the land changed ownership multiple times and was primarily utilized for agricultural purposes. However, in 1884, the city established Byrd Park and constructed a reservoir, marking a pivotal moment in the area’s history. Shortly thereafter, the introduction of streetcar lines facilitated the emergence of residential development in the neighborhood.\n\nThe Carillon neighborhood derives its name from the most prominent structure in the vicinity—the World War I Memorial Carillon situated on the western fringes of Byrd Park. This historic Georgian Revival bell tower stands tall at 240 feet and is adorned with fifty-three bronze bells. It serves as a highly visible and audible landmark that can be seen and heard from various points in the city. After several years of planning and delays, the tower was dedicated in 1932 as a memorial to honor the more than 3,500 Virginians who sacrificed their lives during World War I.\n\nWhile there are a few examples of 19th-century architecture, most of the structures in the neighborhood were constructed during the first half of the 20th century or later. The neighborhood boasts a variety of modestly sized homes representing different architectural styles, including Colonial Revival, Italianate, Ranch, Tudor Revival, and Minimal Traditional. These homes were built using materials such as brick, stone, stucco, terra cotta, and wood. Today, many of these homes have retained their original charm while also undergoing renovations that have added square footage and porches over the years.\n\nThe Carillon neighborhood enjoys a privileged location close to several attractions, providing residents with a wide array of activities and events to choose from. Byrd Park, which spans over 200 acres, is a nearby haven offering parkland, walking, running, and biking trails, as well as the opportunity for pedal boating at Fountain Lake. Additionally, the Dogwood Dell Amphitheater hosts regular concerts during the summer months.\n\nJust around the corner, Maymont offers its formal gardens, arboretum, nature center, and zoo, providing even more opportunities for outdoor exploration and enjoyment. With such proximity to these remarkable destinations, residents of the Carillon neighborhood have a wealth of recreational options at their fingertips.\n\nThings to do:\n\nArts in the Park – One of the top art shows in the country happens every May. Get it on your calendar.\n\nMaymont – Historic mansion tours, formal gardens, events, zoo, nature center and more. You could spend a whole day here and not see it all.\n\nDogwood Dell – The summer concert series (June – August) has a little something for everyone.\n\nPumphouse Park – A beautiful old Victorian Gothic pumphouse that’s worth a visit for the architecture alone but there are also trails and occasional events."
