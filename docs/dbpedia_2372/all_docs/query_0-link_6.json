Holding more patents per capita than any other city in the United States, and becoming one of the country's largest industrial centers, did not happen by accident. The inventors of the airplane, cash register, automobile self-starter, pop-top can, plus the originators of Huffy bicycles, Iams pet foods, and the refrigerant Freon, all called Dayton their home.

Beginning in 1940, Ohio's largest carillon rose from the ground while the landscape surrounding it was converted from a swampland into a sixty-five acre museum campus. Over thirty historic and recreated structures that house exhibits have now joined the original steam engines and early horse-drawn carriages.\n\nQuantity:\n\nAdd To Cart\n\n64 pages\n\n10 x 7\n\nSoftcover\n\nISBN 978-1949248-814\n\nCopyright 2024\n\nWalking the grounds of the Carillon Historical Park, it does not take long to recognize that something extraordinary happened in Dayton, Ohio.
