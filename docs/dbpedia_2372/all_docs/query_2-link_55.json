        "text": "This couple planned an amazing Carillon Park Wedding. Read on to find the vendors they used and how they planned an amazing day.\n\nPlanning a Carillon Park Wedding\n\nCarillon Park in Dayton, Ohio is a perfect spot for a big and fun wedding! The wedding venue sits on a historical park that has an incredible history of some Ohio’s most prominent engineers and inventors. The museum opened in 1950, which is what brings most people to the area. The grounds are beautiful and inside the museum there is a lot of fun in store for guests and families. Complete with much to see and learn about Dayton and Ohio’s history, and a carousel (more on that later!) it can be a great choice if you’re a couple that loves different fun activities and a bit of Ohio history.\n\nIn addition to just being an interesting place, Carillon Park weddings boasts a gorgeous reception hall – one that is unique, open and bright. It was a great spot for taking photos! Take a look below for an overview of how they planned their day and awesome photo opportunities we had while at their wedding! At the bottom of the blog is a full vendor list complete with links!\n\nTo check out another historical venue in the Dayton area, visit this blog of a gorgeous winter wedding.\n\nPre-Ceremony\n\nThe morning started off with capturing their details and getting ready photos. Molly and Trevor wanted nothing but fun and lots of color for the day! They incorporated a wide amount of colors into the day and it was great to see everything they thought of. The bridesmaids in particular had such a fun palette of colors and the florals were all citrus inspired. We got some great robe shots in the Carillon Park wedding area (the upstairs area on the second level in particular) while the groomsmen got ready on the bottom level. Check out how fun their details were!\n\nAfter we finished details and robe photos, we got Molly into her dress and did a fun bridesmaid first look!\n\nAfter Molly and Trevor were all ready it was time for their first look! Trevor was soooo funny when he saw Molly – he immediately smiled, laughed, kissed her and then asked her how day had been going. I love that. We did their first look right out on the lawn in the back of the Carillon Park wedding pavilion area. After that we took their bridal party for some fun photos! The groomsmen stayed out in the back area with my second photographer and I brought the girls out front. We had to start being mindful of the hot weather so I kept them under the cover of the roof for a bit and that worked out well!\n\nAfter we finished bridal party photos, we walked around with just Molly and Trevor. Carillon Park has a railroad that goes around it which is neat! And we found a beautiful willow tree by the railway track (don’t worry it’s perfectly safe!) We also took photos in front of the house that’s out on the back lawn and a few other fun spots. This couple was so sweet and fun together – I truly loved capturing their special moments!\n\nAfter we finished their portraits it was time for their family photos! We kept family close on the back area of the Carillon Park wedding spot. This turned out to be a perfect spot!\n\nCeremony Time!\n\nIt was time for Molly and Trevor to get married! Unfortunately thunderstorms started rolling in and the event had to be moved inside. Good news was that Carillon Park weddings was able to accommodate that and the ceremony was moved into the same place as the reception hall. The ceremony was a fun and loving event. Both Molly and Trevor looked sooooo happy as they exchanged vows!\n\nAlso check out all of their amazing details!\n\nAfter they said I-Do we went back outside for some additional celebratory photos (as the storms veered course and it only drizzled!) and then they got to go back in and enjoy cocktail hour, including a ride on the carousel!\n\nReception\n\nAnd as with most weddings, we concluded the day with an incredibly fun reception. Molly and Trevor had a choregraphed dance, they cut a small cake, and then partied the night away! Carillon Park was definitely a perfect spot for an incredibly fun wedding for this couple!"
