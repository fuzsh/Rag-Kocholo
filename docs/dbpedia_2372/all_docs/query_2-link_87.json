        "text": "I thought it would be fun to highlight some areas in our neck of the woods that are truly special and help make Dayton such a wonderful place to live. I thought I would start with the Carillon Historical Park which occupies 65 acres just south of the city, adjacent to the Great Miami River at 1000 Carillon Blvd. The park is named after the Deeds Carillon which is one of Dayton’s best known landmarks.\n\nThe Carillon Historical Park was founded by Colonel Edward and Edith Deeds and is a testament to Dayton’s heritage of creativity and invention. Not only does the park have 25 historical buildings which take you through the region’s history starting back when Dayton was founded in 1796, it also has the original Wright Flyer III, a B&O Grasshopper steam locomotive and the first automobile self-starter.\n\nThe Park also features Culp’s Cafe and Carillon Brewing Company where guests can relax, refresh and grab something to eat or drink. Carillon Park also hosts many fun events throughout the year including Victorian afternoon teas, tavern dinners, the Dayton Heritage Festival, the Miami Rail Festival and the Germanfest Picnic just to name a few.\n\nFor a full list of events and for more information about what the park has to offer, please check out their website.\n\nThe Carillon Park is open year round and has the following hours:\n\nMonday – Saturday: 9:30am-5:00pm\n\nSunday: 12:00pm-5:00pm\n\nAdmission:\n\n$8 per adult (ages 18-59)\n\n$7 per senior\n\n$5 per child (3 –17)\n\nChildren under 3 and Dayton History members FREE\n\nI hope you get a chance to check it out sometime this year!"
