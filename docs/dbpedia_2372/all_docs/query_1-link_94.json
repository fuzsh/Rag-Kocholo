        "text": "A picturesque outing on the QuÃ©bec‑Ontario border\n\nYou may think I'm pretentious, but Iâll say it anywayâIâm a landmark! Iâm the first hydropower generating station in the province to have been built under the supervision of French‑Canadian engineers. You could even say that I marked a turning point in the history of electricity in QuÃ©bec.\n\nLocated in the Laurentides region, Iâm a beautiful run‑of‑river generating station, near Long‑Sault, site of the historic battle between Iroquois and New France settlers. Iâm on the RiviÃ¨re des Outaouais (Ottawa River), which forms a natural border between QuÃ©bec and Ontario.\n\nBut thatâs all Iâll say for now. If you come see me, my guides will reveal all (almost!) of my secrets. Hereâs a tip: After your tour, be sure to hop over to see the Canal‑de‑Carillon National Historic Site. Itâs right next door! You can observe the boats using the locks and have a picnic nearby.\n\nAccessibility\n\nThe tour of the generating station is on foot and includes some stairs. It is partially accessible to people with reduced mobility.\n\nMinimum age\n\nThe tour is suitable for adults and school‑age children but is not recommended for children under the age of two, for safety reasons.\n\nPacemakers and other medical implants\n\nElectric and/or magnetic fields may disrupt operation of pacemakers, implantable automatic defibrillators and processors in cochlear implants. As a precaution, visitors with these types of medical implants may not participate in the part of the tour that takes place inside the generating station.\n\nThose with a neurostimulator must temporarily stop the device before entering the generating station. If they are unable to stop the device, they are advised not to enter.\n\nFor regular tours, there is no risk of interference for insulin pumps.\n\nWhat to wear\n\nVisitors must wear flat, closed‑toe shoes and the safety gear provided (hard hat, safety glasses and headphones) inside the generating station.\n\nPart of the tour takes place outdoors, so dress accordingly!\n\nServices\n\nPicnic tables\n\nFree parking\n\nProximity to a bike path\n\nRestrooms\n\nDirections\n\nThe starting point for the tour is the parking lot of the locks where the visitor welcome trailer is located. How to get there:\n\nTake Route 344 heading west, towards Saint‑AndrÃ©‑dâArgenteuil and Carillon.\n\nFollow the Hydro‑QuÃ©bec sign indicating where to turn left on Rue&nbspdu Barrage.\n\nFollow the signs for guided tours.\n\nPark along the locks.\n\nHow long is the guided tour?\n\nThe guided tour lasts 90 minutes: 45 minutes in the interpretation center and 45 minutes in the generating station.\n\nWhat time do the tours take place?\n\nDuring the summer, there are four tours daily, at 9:30 a.m., 11:15 a.m., 1 p.m., and 2:45 p.m. The tours are generally given in French. For an English tour, please call us in advance.\n\nSpaces are limited, so we strongly recommend booking at least 24 hours in advance.\n\nDoes the entire tour take place indoors?\n\nMost of the tour is indoors, with a portion outside.\n\nIn case of rain, make sure to dress appropriately and bring an umbrella.\n\nPlease note: The temperature inside the generating station can vary significantly from the outdoor temperature. In summer, if it is 25Â°C outside, it can reach about 35Â°C in the generating station.\n\nIs it absolutely necessary to make a reservation, even for only one or two people?\n\nBecause spaces are limited, reservations are mandatory, regardless of the number of people, and must be made at least 24 hours in advance.\n\nPlease note: To confirm your reservation, it is best to make your reservation by phone. The guides will then give you all the necessary instructions before your visit.\n\nIs the tour accessible to people with reduced mobility?\n\nThe portion of the tour that takes place in the generating station is partially accessible to people with reduced mobility.\n\nThe interpretation center and toilets are not accessible.\n\nA wheelchair is available to visit the generating station. We recommend calling 1 800 365‑5229 (toll‑free) to ensure that it has not already been booked.\n\nIs the tour suitable for young children?\n\nNo. The tour is suitable for school‑age children. For safety reasons, children under two are advised not to participate in the tour. (See next question.)\n\nWhy is the tour not recommended for children under two?\n\nThe tour is not recommended for the following reasons:\n\nVisitors must wear personal protective equipment. However, the size of this equipment is not suitable for children under two.\n\nThe generating station is an industrial property with high heat, noise and dust levels.\n\nIs there a significant amount of walking during the tour?\n\nYes. Half of the tour is on foot, and includes two flights of stairs.\n\nWhat clothing is recommended for the tour?\n\nFlat, closed‑toe shoes are required.\n\nIn case of rain, make sure to dress appropriately and bring an umbrella.\n\nPlease note: The temperature inside the generating station is significantly warmer than outside.\n\nWhy do I need to show identification to access the facilities?\n\nThis is a requirement of Hydro‑QuÃ©becâs corporate security management team to protect personnel, visitors and equipment.\n\nVisitors aged 18 and over must present identification (driverâs licence, health insurance card or passport) before they can tour the facility.\n\nAre you allowed to take photos in the generating station?\n\nNo. For safety reasons, it is prohibited to bring a camera or any other electronic device (cell phone, tablet, MP3 player, portable music player or computer).\n\nHowever, you are permitted to take photos in the interpretation center and outside the security perimeter.\n\nAre you allowed to bring a handbag or backpack into the generating station?\n\nNo. Visitors must leave their personal belongings (purses, backpacks, cell phones, bags, etc.) in a locked locker provided free of charge.\n\nAre water bottles allowed in the generating station?\n\nYes, but visitors must carry them at all times.\n\nWe recommend staying well hydrated, especially in the summer, as it can be hot in the power plant.\n\nCan people with pacemakers visit the generating station?\n\nNo. The electromagnetic fields in power plants may disrupt pacemaker operation. As a precaution, people with pacemakers may not participate in this part of the visit.\n\nAre strollers or baby carriers allowed in the generating station?\n\nNo. It is too dangerous.\n\nIs there a restaurant or cafeteria on site?\n\nNo. There are no restaurants, cafeterias, vending machines, or dining areas inside.\n\nHowever, it is possible to eat at the park next door, in the Carillon Canal National Historic Site.\n\nHow do you get to the generating station?\n\nThe starting point of the tour is the lock parking lot where the welcome trailer is located. Getting there:\n\nTake Route 344 west toward Saint‑AndrÃ© d'Argenteuil and Carillon.\n\nFollow the Hydro‑QuÃ©bec sign and turn left onto Rue du Barrage.\n\nFollow the signs for guided tours.\n\nPark along the lock."
