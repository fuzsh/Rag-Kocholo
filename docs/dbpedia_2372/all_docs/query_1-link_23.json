        "text": "At the base of the Riverwalk's Rotary Hill stands the majestic Millennium Carillon in Moser Tower, a unique, 16-story structure with a 72- bell musical instrument. This gift, given to the Naperville community to commemorate the dawn of the New Millennium, was built through community support and donations, and is maintained through a partnership between the Naperville Park District, Millennium Carillon Foundation and the City of Naperville.\n\nVisitors can climb the 253 steps to the top of the tower on the guided tour and enjoy the spectacular view, where on a clear day the Chicago Skyline can be seen. Those who are unable to climb the stairs are encouraged to use the elevator and remain on the Gallery Level Observation Deck.\n\n2024 Millennium Carillon Lighting Program\n\nThe Park District offers a special lighting program at the Millennium Carillon designed to create an opportunity to promote, celebrate or commemorate non-profit or non-commercial community activities, events, subjects or organizations that the Park Board of Commissioners determines to be consistent with the organizationâ€™s mission. Carillon light colors can be changed to align with specific, approved events and purposes. Neither the Carillon nor the lighting program constitutes a public forum for speech. The lighting program is intended to celebrate community events and holidays and to bring awareness to events or matters that are of local importance and beyond.\n\nJuly\n\nJuly 1 - 4 - In recognition of 4th of July the Millenium Carillon will be lit with the colors of red, white and blue.\n\nJuly 5 - 8 - In appreciation for Veterans, Active Military, First Responders and their Families the Millenium Carillon will be lit with the colors of red, white and blue."
