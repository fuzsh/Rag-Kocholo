We met in Dayton at the Carillon Historical Park for their engagement session, and our time together was full of laughter, genuine smiles and lots of joy. Can you believe that these two were nervous?? When you get to be yourself with the person you love, all those nerves seem to melt away. That’s what I just love about these sessions.\n\nI hadn’t been to Carillon Park in such a long time, so we had a blast exploring all of the unique buildings and architecture. I wish we could have stayed longer, but we took full advantage of our time together. I am so incredibly excited for their wedding next year. I just know that it will be full of so much joy, and I. Cannot. Wait. <3"
