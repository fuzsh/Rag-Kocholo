        "text": "By JO ALLEN\n\njallen@morningsentinel.com\n\nCENTRALIA — As the Carillon Park’s latest large developmental project nears completion, with the north side of the park. The Centralia Foundation announced yet another expansion, with the purchase of the old Mamma Antonia’s building located at 300 West Broadway.\n\nJohn Perrine, an ex-officio member of the foundation, said that the foundation has plans to demolish the old building to make way for the park’s expansion.\n\n“It has been the foundation’s long-standing intention to acquire the whole block and turn it into the park,” Perrine told the Sentinel.\n\nBesides the recently purchased building, there are two other buildings on the block that are still in use today.\n\nPerrine said that the initiative could take decades.\n\nAccording to Perrine, there are no immediate plans for the extra space that the demolition will provide, but he said that they could add turf and sidewalk until the park undergoes another large development in the future.\n\nRecently, the park underwent a transformation on the north side, where updated sidewalks, turf and foliage were installed.\n\n“The Idea is to make it much more accessible to the public,” Perrine said. “The plan is to have much more events at the park as well.”\n\nCurrently, the Centralia Foundation is finishing up the final touches of the redevelopment project. The bells in the bell tower are expected to be completed in about a month, and the fountain located on the west side of the park is expected to be back in operation in a few weeks.\n\nOne of the park’s most recent additions is a bell that had been stored in the Sentinel building for many years. Perrine said that the bell had an imperfection that prevented its use."
