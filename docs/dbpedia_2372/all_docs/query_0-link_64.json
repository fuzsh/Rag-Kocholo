        "text": "In 1942, Colonel Edward Deeds and his wife Edith dedicated Deeds Carillon. Mrs. Deeds played the first concert on Easter Sunday of 1942.\n\nIn 1988, the carillon was rededicated as it was converted from an electrically controlled carillon to a traditional, mechanical one. The rededication plaque placed at that time indicated that there were 50 bells. A smaller plaque underneath that rededication plaque gives appreciation to Larry Weinstein for giving seven additional bells and to Jerre and Mary Joystead for contributing to their installation.\n\nThe tower is constructed from Indiana limestone with a granite base."
