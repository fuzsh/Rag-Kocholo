        "text": "With 58 tuned bronze bells, the carillon ranks as one of the world’s largest and most beautiful. The bells weigh a combined total of 26 tons (ranging from 13½ pounds to 8,000 pounds) and cover a range of nearly five octaves.\n\nMany modern carillons are played electronically, but this carillon is played entirely by hand from a keyboard located in the midst of the bells. The bells do not swing, but are bolted stationary in a steel framework. Keys and pedals are connected to the bells’ clappers by a mechanical system of direct cranks, roller bars, and steel cables.\n\nThe keyboard of 58 oak batons and 24 pedals provides the carillonneur sensitive musical control of the instrument. Directly beneath the bells is the carillonneur’s studio with a piano and practice keyboard. This keyboard uses hammers to strike small metal bars rather than the bells, allowing the carillonneur to practice quietly."
