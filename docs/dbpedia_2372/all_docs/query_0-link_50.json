        "text": "Carillon Park Railroad Now Boarding!\n\nMonday – Saturday: 10am – 4pm\n\nSunday: 12pm – 4pm.\n\n$5 per ride, or $12 for an all-day pass.\n\nThis nearly mile-long, 3’ narrow gauge rail network is equipped with a replica 1851 locomotive capable of carrying 120 guests on a narrated circle tour of Carillon Historical Park’s exhibit buildings. This project features a loading station at Bowling Green station, a 100’ long triple-cell ConSpan bridge, two open-air coaches, rare views of Carillon Park, and passage through the Old Montgomery Co. Fairgrounds Horse Barn No. 17.\n\nThe Carillon Park Railroad is a major component of our campus-wide masterplan and builds upon a concept conceived by Carillon Park founder Edward Deeds to include a large-scale mid-19th-century locomotive among the exhibits. A miniature model, commissioned by Deeds in the 1940s, served as an inspiration for the project. This was a great opportunity to implement and expand upon a project that our founder was excited about achieving, while also providing transportation for guests around the Park. Please know that while this new railroad is much larger, it will not replace, but rather complement the Rail & Steam Society miniature trains operated since 1984 by dedicated volunteers on special days during the year.\n\nThe project was one of the most all-encompassing since the Park’s opening in 1950, and like everything at Carillon Park, took generous financial champions to realize these dreams."
