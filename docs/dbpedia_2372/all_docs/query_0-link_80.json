        "text": "Snuggled toward the cash register portals upon entering The Heritage Center inside the Kettering Education portion of Carillon Historical Park is the original Deeds Barn, originally located at 319 Central Avenue in Dayton, Ohio.\n\nIt has been moved to the Kettering-Moraine’s outdoor park with several other historic buildings from the area, but was carefully lifted and moved to its current, and final location. Carillon Historical Park also has a replica barn on site in the park and across from The Wright Brothers National Museum.\n\nHow I ever missed the fact that there is a set of stairs that leads Guests up to peer inside the original barn‘s second floor is a huge mystery. How I missed the ramp above me while taking photos of Charles Kettering’s animatronic figure from below is an even greater mystery.\n\nI was assisting one of the volunteers by turning on some exhibition case lights and she mentioned the upstairs viewing deck. Huh? I finished my light mission and bounded up the stairs! I don’t “bound” any more but I know I was moving rapidly.\n\nHere are some of the photos from my new discovery."
