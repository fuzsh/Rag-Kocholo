Typically held on Sundays and during Carillon Historical Park’s main events, Deeds Carillon concerts are performed by Carillonneur Alan Bowman. At 151-feet, with 57 bells, the limestone Deeds Carillon-the Park’s namesake-is Ohio’s largest carillon.

Carillon Historical Park owes its existence to the generosity of Colonel Edward Andrew Deeds (1874-1960) and Edith Walton Deeds (1869-1947). In the 1930s, while traveling in Bruges, Belgium, Edith, an accomplished musician, found inspiration in magnificent carillon music, and she dreamed of sharing this music with the people of Dayton. Edith’s dream became reality through the construction of Deeds Carillon—her most visible legacy to the community she loved.
