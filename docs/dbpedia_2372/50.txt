A perfect place to go to learn about the past!

Carillon Historical Park was founded by Colonel Edward and Edith Deeds. It is situated on 65-acres between the Great Miami River and a glacial moraine. It has 25 historical buildings and hundreds of artifacts shown throughout the park. The park is filled with Dayton’s history from 1796 through the next two centuries with outdoor exhibits of history, invention, and transportation.

You can see the original 1905 Wright Flyer III, the world’s first practical airplane and a National Historic Landmark, an 1835 B&O (Grasshopper) Steam Locomotive, and the first auto mobile self-starter. Costumed Interpreters will take you through many of Dayton’s oldest buildings, such as;

Newcom’s Tavern, erected in 1796, William Morris House, built about 1815 in Centerville, Ohio, and Locust Grove School #12, a one- room schoolhouse that held grades 1st-8th for over 30 years, built in 1896 in Springfield, Ohio- A.B. Graham, the founder of the 4H Club movement was once taught in this school.

The Park shows industries; like the Huffy Corporation, innovations; like flood control, and inventions; like the cash register. You can see the Deeds Barn, the Wright’s Cycle Shop, and a 1930′s print shop showing the Miami Valley’s printing history. Then, you can take a ride on the 1/8th scale Carillon Park Railroad ran by an all-volunteer, not for profit, Ohio corporation called Carillon Park Rail & Steam Society, Inc., very fun.

Carillon Historical Park is home to one of Dayton’s best-known landmarks, the Deeds Carillon, the largest carillon in Ohio. The 151-foot tower houses 57 bells. It was completed in 1942 and refurbished in 1988, converting it from an electronically controlled carillon to a traditional, mechanical one.
