Marine Atlantic, its predecessor CN Marine, and pre-confederation Newfoundland coastal boats have a strong and proud history serving the people of Atlantic Canada through ferry terminals, passenger vessels and rail service.

In this weekâ€™s blog posting we highlight the MV Sir Robert Bond which served the North Sydney-Port aux Basques crossing and the Labrador coastal service from 1975-1997.

Named after the first prime minister of the Dominion of Newfoundland, the vessel originally served the Port aux Basques-North Sydney crossing before moving to the Labrador service in 1977. Originally designed as a freight rail-car ferry, it underwent a significant refit to add accommodations and passenger amenities to better suit the needs of Labrador customers. The 10,500 ton ship transported significant volumes of freight and passengers destined for Labrador communities during its years of service with CN Marine and Marine Atlantic.
