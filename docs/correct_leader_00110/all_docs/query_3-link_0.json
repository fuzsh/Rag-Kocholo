        "text": "Sir Robert Bond (born Feb. 25, 1857, St. John’s, Nfd. [Canada]—died March 16, 1927, Whitbourne) was the leader of the Liberal Party in Newfoundland and prime minister of the British colony from 1900 to 1909.\n\nBond was elected to the Newfoundland House of Assembly in 1882. He became speaker in 1884 and colonial secretary in 1889 in the Liberal ministry. His attempts to settle the fishing rights allowed to France and the United States were overruled by the United Kingdom and, although France gave up the right to use Newfoundland shores in 1904, agreement was not made between the United States and the imperial government until 1910."
