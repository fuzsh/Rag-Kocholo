        "meta_description": "This article examines the meaning of Irish “home rule” as a constitutional experiment and its relationship with other proposals for constitutional change in the British Empire of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The concept of Irish home rule was seen as a major constitutional experiment and the United Kingdom had little experience of devolution or federal settlements. This article will examine the model that was finally selected for this constitutional experiment which was inspired by the constitution of the Dominion of Canada. The article will also examine the relationship between Irish home rule and other constitutional experiments. These included proposals to create a federal United Kingdom, a concept known as “home rule all round” and even a federal British Empire, a concept known as “Imperial federation”. The conclusion will assess the significance of these constitutional experiments in influencing the campaign for Irish home rule.",

        "text": "Introduction\n\nHome Rule and Dominion status\n\n23 “Mr T.P. O’Connor’s Tour in Canada”, Freeman’s Journal,26 October 1910, p. 5.\n\nCanada has full fiscal liberty, she has the right to raise a navy, she has practically complete self-government. She sends representatives to other Powers to make treaties. Under no system of Home Rule that has ever been proposed by an Irish leader have we even thought of anything approaching these powers.\n\n9In short, Canada and the other Dominions were autonomous parts of the British Empire, whereas Ireland, under a home rule settlement, would have been an autonomous part of the United Kingdom. The Dominions were given ambiguous recognition in textbooks on international law in the late 19th and early 20th centuries whereas Ireland under a home rule settlement would not have merited any recognition in such a text.\n\n“Home Rule all round”\n\n11Additional complications were created by the question of what would happen to the remainder of the United Kingdom if the island of Ireland were granted home rule.\n\nImperial Federation\n\n48 The South African figure only took into account the white population of that Dominion (TNA, CO 886/ (...)\n\nUnited Kingdom - 220\n\nCanada - 37\n\nAustralia - 25\n\nSouth Africa - 7\n\nNew Zealand - 6\n\nNewfoundland - 2\n\nConclusion\n\n28In the late 19th and early 20th centuries Irish home rule was seen as a constitutional experiment and opinions remained divided as to whether it would lead to positive or negative outcomes for the British Empire, the United Kingdom or for Ireland itself. In these circumstances, it is important to examine the results of the close relationship between Irish home rule and other constitutional projects such as Imperial federation, home rule all round and Dominion status. This demands some assessment of the relationship between Irish home rule and each of these constitutional projects.\n\n57 TNA, CAB 32/1, 9th Day, 16 April 1917.\n\nTo attempt to run by a Central Parliament and a Central Executive even the common concerns [of] a group of nations spread over the whole world, speaking different languages, belonging to different races with entirely different economic circumstances … is to my mind absolutely to court disaster.\n\n73 Ibid. at60-1.\n\nIt is quite possible, if we chose to turn our minds back, that if the country had followed Gladstone in 1886 this terrible misfortune, for it is nothing less, would have been cured, at any rate a generation ago. But is it quite possible … if Gladstone had never raised the question, if it had not become a bone of contention between parties in this country, that just as for three generations there was the same feeling in Scotland against the Union as in Ireland, so in time Ireland, like Scotland, might have been willing to accept our good and evil fortunes as a full partner. There is no use thinking of that now."
