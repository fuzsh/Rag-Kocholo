        "text": "The Tasmanian election has produced a stand-off, with Labor having 10 seats and wanting to resign from office and the Liberal Party also winning 10 seats and wanting to take office. The Greens won five seats and are currently standing on the sideline and madly waving in the hope that someone might talk to them about who should form government.\n\nTomorrow Premier Bartlett intends to advise Governor Peter Underwood that Liberal Leader Will Hodgman should be commissioned as the new Premier. It is not clear whether the Governor will accept this advice. Several well credentialled constitutionalist, such as Professor Richard Herr, have stated the Governor may ask Premier Bartlett to test his numbers in Parliament rather than accept the major parties' deal on the baton change of power.\n\nIf you thought that scenario was bad enough, what would the Governor do if it had been an absolute tie? Well, it has happened before, in Newfoundland in 1908.\n\nThe following is taken from a website on Newfoundland government and politics. Click the link for the full text.\n\nThe 1908 Newfoundland Tie Election\n\nThe election of 1908 resulted in the two parties winning the same number of seats, and produced Newfoundland and Labrador's most famous constitutional crisis. The unprecedented tie created political chaos, and allowed the governor to exercise greater influence over who formed the government than was normally the case.\n\nBetween 1900 and 1907 Newfoundland and Labrador enjoyed a period of economic prosperity that allowed the government of Robert Bond to engage in some ambitious policies. Bond revised the controversial agreement by which the government compensated the Reid Newfoundland Company for the construction and operation of a trans-island railway, and in doing so made an enemy of the powerful Reid family. Bond also attempted to prevent Americans from buying herring from Newfoundlanders on the west coast - a measure intended to support the Newfoundland fishery, but which was unpopular with fishermen who made some much-needed cash by selling bait to American vessels. The resulting international incident created little love for Bond among officials at the Colonial Office in London. While he had the support of the Liberal caucus for these policies during prosperous economic times, forces were lined up against him by 1908 when the economy entered into a slump.\n\nIn 1907 an ambitious minister in the Liberal government, Edward Morris, resigned from the cabinet on a minor pretext. Initially he sat in the Assembly as an independent, and he soon had the backing of the Conservatives and a few dissident Liberals for his new \"People's Party\", which was ready to contest the election. Bond ran confidently on his government's record. He had the friendship and support of Roman Catholic Archbishop M.F. Howley, Roman Catholics had tended to vote Liberal over the years, and his party was secure in many of the northern districts with Protestant majorities.\n\nMorris was an extremely effective campaigner, and put forward a well-designed platform that provided a vision of the future rather than relying upon past accomplishments as did the government. His platform consisted of a list of promises that appealed to most constituencies with the country, and in particular promised branch railway lines into many of the more populated bays. These branch lines were attractive to voters not only for the potential railway service, but the many construction jobs that the branches represented. Strategically, he appealed to the \"Liberal\" constituencies that had large numbers of Roman Catholics, in part because Morris was one of them. By condemning \"sectarianism\" he implied that Protestants were supporting Bond out of anti-Catholic motives. While the Church hierarchy's influence over voters might have been significant at some points in the past, Morris was a popular leader among the Roman Catholic community and that more than compensated for Howley's support for Bond. Morris' support also included the Conservative voters, many of whom were Protestants, who had long wanted to oust Bond and were willing to support Morris' People's Party to do it.\n\nThe result of the contest was a tie, each party taking 18 seats in the Assembly, with the popular vote split nearly evenly. Although Bond remained premier, it was clear that the Liberals could not put together a majority in the Assembly. Once Bond appointed a Speaker, who would have to come from his own ranks and would not have the right to vote, the Liberals would have only 17 votes to the People's Party's 18. This would make passing a supply bill impossible and would bring the government down. Meanwhile, Morris was suggesting that since Bond had not won the election he should not be allowed to spend public money until the political deadlock had been resolved.\n\nGovernor Sir William MacGregor lacked any precedents to guide him in his decisions during the ensuing constitutional wrangling, and he shared the British government's dislike for Bond. Bond asked the governor to call another election in hopes of creating a clear winner and resolving the crisis. MacGregor did not want to do so, since such an election would have to be held during the fishing season when thousands of voters were away from their homes. The governor refused Bond's request, leaving him with no choice but to resign as premier. The governor then asked Morris if he would be able to get a majority in the Assembly and pass a supply bill. Morris maintained that he could, so MacGregor appointed Morris as the premier and called the legislature into session. If Morris genuinely believed he could get enough votes in the Assembly, he did not explain how he intended to do it.\n\nDespite his assurances, Morris was unable to elect a speaker, let alone pass a supply bill, leaving MacGregor no choice but to call another election, despite having refused to do so for Bond weeks earlier. The choice MacGregor now faced was the question of who would be the premier during the campaign period. Unlike Bond, Morris had not resigned when it was proven he could not govern. Officials in the Colonial Office held conflicting views as to best course of action - should Morris remain as premier until after the election, or should Bond resume the premiership pending the outcome of the vote? Bond's stormy relationship with the British government now came into play. The Colonial Office preferred Morris over Bond, and believed he had a better chance of winning as premier.\n\nThe Liberals condemned MacGregor's actions, but that had little effect upon the voters. Since Morris was now premier, even though he had not established a majority in the Assembly, he was able to use his executive power to spend government funds. Morris made effective use of his popular appeal, his capture of the Roman Catholic vote in traditional Liberal constituencies and government spending to reward potential supporters. The People's Party gained a majority of seats in the election of 1909. The constitutional crisis had ended.\n\nA note needs to be added on Australian constitutional law in relation to the Newfoundland case. Under Australian convention, the original Premier Bond should have been recommissioned as Premier to hold an early election. The last time in Australia that a government denied an election resigned and was then re-commissioned and granted an early election was in Victoria in 1952. Changes of government mid-term occured a number of time in Victoria from the 1920s through to 1952. The last time it happened in NSW was 1921 (ignoring Lang's dismissal in 1932) and in Tasmania in the 1920s. The last time it occured at the Federal level was with the appointment of the Curtin government in 1941 when the Menzies government lost the support of key Independents mid-term.\n\nTasmania had a number of ties, including two 15-all ties in 1955 and 1956. At the time Tasmania had a special deadlock provision in its constitution where, in the case of a tie, the party with more votes formed government and the party with fewer votes appointed the Speaker. One year after the 1955 election, a Labor government Minister Carrol Bramich resigned from the Labor Party and joined the Liberal Party, giving the Opposition a majority. In that case, given the special deadlock provision, the Governor granted an early election, at which another tie was produced, Labor formed government with more votes, and Bramich was elected as a Liberal. The deadlock provision was repealed when the Parliament was expended to an odd number in 1959.\n\nSince the 1952 incident, the only mid-term change of government unrelated to a general election or vice-regal intervention was the resignation of Queensland's Goss Labor government in 1996, replaced by the Borbidge Coalition government following the result of the Mundingburra by-election.\n\nThere were two mid-term changes of government in the unworkable Assembly elected after the first ACT self-government election in 1989. However, the ACT Assembly is different in that the Chief Minister is elected by the Assembly, not appointed by the Crown.\n\nWhatever the Governor decides on Wednesday, he will be keen to avoid a revolving door of short-lived ministries, so common in 19th colonial politics pre-dating the rise of organised party politics.\n\nThe formation of the first Labor government in Queensland in 1899 came about in the week it took political opponents to hammer out a new coalition agreement. The Victorian case in 1952 involved the Governor resolving that the Assembly had become unworkable. Australia's shortest ever government, the seven hour administration of Nationalist George Fuller in NSW on 20 December 1921, was another example of the Governor determining that a Parliament could not produce a stable government before granting a dissolution. After Fuller's government fell at its first vote, Labor Premier James Dooley was re-commissioned, and having been rejected on his first request, this time Dooley's request for an election was granted.\n\nGovernor Underwood will be keen to avoid another election this year. It is one of the Governor's conventions listed in R.D.Lumb's \"The Constitutions of the Australian States\" that a request for a dissolution in the first twelve months of a Parliament would not normally be granted. You would expect that if the Governor accepts David Bartlett's advice to appoint Will Hodgman before Parliament sits, he would want some assurance about how a Labor opposition would deal with the new government.\n\nIf Premier Bartlett's resignation is accepted and Will Hodgman is appointed Premier, then if at some point in this term Premier Hodgman is defeated and requests a dissolution, the Labor Party could ask that it be given a chance to govern in minority rather than Hodgman be granted a dissolution.\n\nIf instead the Governor asks the Bartlett government to face Parliament where it is defeated, then if at some future date a Hodgman government is defeated, it would be much easier for the Governor to grant Premier Hodgman a request for a dissolution without first re-commissioning David Bartlett.\n\nThe great question is whether the processes of government in the 21st century could cope with these precendents drawn from the less complex government of a century ago. In this modern era, would a Governor have to go through past practice of even appointing a short-lived minority Green government before deciding the Parliament was unworkable.\n\nThe 1908 Newfoundland tie might not seem relevant, but you can expect to hear about it and other constitutional precedents from Parliaments around the former British Commonwealth of Nations.\n\nI think one thing we can be sure of is that the Labor and Liberal Parties will not be moving to implement their commitments of the previous Parliament to introduce fixed parliamentary terms. This has long been Green policy, but I very much doubt either major party will support such legislation in the new Parliament.\n\nComments\n\nWouldn't it just be easier for Tasmania to adopt the same structure for elections. I understand the system is used due to a lower population but the Norther Territory have frst past the post seat voting, why cant tasmania?\n\nCOMMENT: Nobody uses first past the post voting in Australia. Tasmania has used its voting system since 1909 and generally Tasmanians seem relatively happy with it.\n\n- Aaron April 06, 2010 at 09:17 PM\n\nwhat about the greens factor? While both leaders have said they will not go into a coalition with the Greens, their numbers cannot be ignored. How much or a role do you think they will play in the formation of the next Tasmanian Government?\n\nCOMMENT: Why ask me tonight when we know what the Governor's view will be tomorrow.\n\n- Marc April 06, 2010 at 10:11 PM\n\nThe same Sir William MacGregor who was Governor of Queensland I think? After whom the suburbs of Macgregor in Brisbane and Canberra are named.\n\nCOMMENT: Yes, he took up the Queensland post after Newfoundland, and served in a number of colonial posts over the years.\n\n- Darryl Rosin April 06, 2010 at 11:40 PM\n\nAntony, sorry i meant full preferential voting like the other states, it could just seem that it would be easier to get a clear election result and a party governing, as under the current system in Tasmania there could be a hung parliament and a minority government at every election.\n\nHistorically, there have been very few instances of minority governments in full preferential voting states and cannot think of one federally. Queensland in 1995, SA in 2002 and Victoria for a small period in 1999 before the by elections.\n\nIt would just seem that it would benefit Tasmania to have a result and a majority government for it to function properly and not the rabble which they now have.\n\nCOMMENT: As I said, Tasmania has used the Hare-Clark system for more than a hundred years and the state's politics is built around its operation and the voters seem to be perfectly happy with it. What you have also seen develop in Tasmania is a very significant third party in the Greens. I would think Labor might have some interest in switching to single member electorates, but on the votes recorded at the recent election. the Liberals wouldn't as it would guarantee permanent opposition for them.\n\n- aaron April 07, 2010 at 02:33 AM\n\nAntony,\n\nQuery in regard to your assertion that the NSW Fuller Government was Australia's shortest lived. I would have thought that the Fraser Government of November 11, 1975 which governed from 1:10pm until both houses of Parliament were dissolved at about 4:45 pm would have been shorter. However, I am more than happy to bow to your far more extensive knowledge of Australian politics.\n\nCOMMENT: Depends what you mean by government. Fuller handed back his commission after about 7 hours and Dooley resumed the office of Premier. Malcolm Fraser continued as Prime Minister until March 1983.\n\n- Paul April 07, 2010 at 01:18 PM\n\nBit of a quibble, but would you say that the Mundingburra by-election was unrelated to the general election of 1995?\n\nCOMMENT: True, in which case there hasn't been a mid-term change of government since 1952, but the case was exceptional enough to be worth highlighting. It is very different to the Frankston East supplementary election in 1999, which was 3 weeks after the state election and caused a change of government, compared to 7 months for Mundingbura. If the by-election had been caused by death rather than court of disputed returns case there would be no quibbling. There had been a functioning government for many months before the hand over of power to the Borbidge government. I think it fair to highlight the incident as a rare case unconnected to the result of a general election.\n\n- Martin B April 08, 2010 at 09:32 PM\n\nCould Bartlett simply refuse to take a commission to from the Governor? And what would the Governor do if Bartlett said, ...if you send me back to test support, I will fall on my sword ie one my members will abstain from voting if vote of no confidence is brought? Surely the Governor would have invite the Libs to test support.\n\nCOMMENT: On those circumstances yes, but I would point out that Bartlett neither offered advice he would fall on his sword or offered any guarantees to a Hodgman government. If he had the Governor may have acted differently.\n\nThe Governor has chosen not to appoint a new government that had potential to fall on the first day of sitting. Less embarrassing for the Crown to re-commission the existing government pending its ability to prove it has the confidence of the House. Hodgman could not tell the governor if he would last more than a day as Premier once Parliament sat, which is why he wasn't appointed Premier ahead of Parliament sitting. The Governor has essentially left the House to say yeah or nay to the existing government rather than second guess what would happen. The view of constitutional lawyers is that Bartlett should not have tendered the advice he did before the House sat unless he also promisied some co-operation to keep the new government in office for a period of time.\n\n- Paul Kearney April 09, 2010 at 10:44 AM\n\nBut if he had offered this advice to fall on his sword...in keeping with his earlier advice recommending the Libs govern...govnernor would have little choice other than to ask Libs to FIRST test their support.\n\nRelated issue is there a legal issue (or just ethical), if Bartlett provides the governor with misleading advice? Also would the governor ask Labor's deputy leader to take a commision if Bartlett himself refused?\n\nAlso given the situation, why didn't the gov, let the matter straight to parliament before 'providing' a commision?\n\nI am not sure what you mean by \"The view of constitutional lawyers is that Bartlett should not have tendered the advice he did before the House sat...\"\n\nPs I am a labor voter who is morally outraged by what Bartlett and gov have done\n\nCOMMENT: He didn't offer the advice. I don't know what the Governor would have done had he offered different advice. Bartlett didn't offer misleading advice, he offered advice the Governor was not bound to take unless Mr Bartlett had proved he had the confidence of the House. The Governor would not have approached anyone without first obtaining the consent of the Premier. The Governor was always likely to re-commission Bartlett until the Parliament's first sitting unless Bartlett had offered some undertaking or unless Mr Hodgman had indicated some other support, such as an agreement with the Greens.\n\nThe Governor had to make some decision at this stage as Mr Bartlett had to re-structure his Ministry as from next Wednesday, several of his existing Ministers were no longer MPs and therefore could no longer be Ministers. Someone had to be commissioned to form a Ministry that could be presented to the Parliament.\n\n- Paul Kearney April 09, 2010 at 12:05 PM\n\nNewfoundland was a land of dramas. in the 1930s representative government broke down completely after a financial crisis and they regressed from being a Dominion to a crown colony.\n\nwas there ever a luckier party than Tasmanian Labor in 1955?\n\n- Geoff Robinson April 19, 2010 at 11:41 AM"
