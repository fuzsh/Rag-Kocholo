        "text": "This unique item was created in 1979 when the St. John's daily newspaper, The Telegram, celebrated its 100th anniversary. It is a timeline of events covering 100 years of Newfoundland history mixed with world events. The timeline appears to be a reprint of the \"50 years Ago Today\" and \"25 years Ago Today\" columns. Printed on a single piece of paper it measures 1½ inches wide by 36½ feet long.\n\nThe original document is held in the Michael Harrington Collection, Coll-307. Harrington was the editor of The Telegram from 1959 to 1982.\n\nFor more information on this collection, click here.\n\nLocated on the northeastern tip of the Bonavista peninsula, the municipality of Bonavista is one of the oldest towns on the northeast coast of Newfoundland. On June 24th, 1497, John Cabot, an Italian explorer sailing under the British flag for King Henry VII, made landfall in the New World.\n\nMethodism was founded in Newfoundland in 1766 with the arrival of Rev. Laurence Coughlan, a newly-ordained Church of England priest who had been converted to Methodism some 13 years previously.\n\nThe first Methodist Church in Bonavista was constructed in 1814 under the ministry of Rev. William Ellis. It served the people of Bonavista for 35 years when it was enlarged to house the growing population. However, on January 8, 1870 a severe storm destroyed the church. It was rebuilt within a year under the ministry of Rev. John S. Phimmey. The building could seat 800 people; however, with time the population grew and a larger building was needed, so on March 4, 1918 the church was taken down in order to build a new one. The fourth and present church was completed in 1921 under the leadership of Rev. Charles Lench. It is 65 feet wide and 124 feet long with a seating capacity of 1200 which makes it the largest wooden church in Eastern Canada. The design is \"Classical Revival Style\" which was widely popular at this time. It has an open scissor-brace rafter system, a timber balloon frame, and a combination stone-concrete foundation. The church was designed by architect Charles H. Lench, M.Arch. (Harvard). The Master Builder of the church was Ronald Strathie, who also built other structures in Bonavista. The tower clock was purchased from the Howard Clock Company in New York and was installed by Mr. Strathie and has long been a landmark for local fishermen returning to port.\n\nA special ceremony was held for the laying of the cornerstone on October 31, 1921. The cornerstone contains a box filled with contemporary copies of newspapers, the \"Methodist Monthly Greeting,\" circulating coins, and a list of the officials attending the ceremony.\n\nThe fine stained glass window in the facade was donated by the Swyers Family in memory of those who lost their lives in war; it portrays Christ as the Good Shepherd, and incorporates symbols appropriate to The United Church of Canada.\n\nThe building was dedicated on 28th January, 1923. Two years later, upon church union, the Methodist church became part of The United Church of Canada.\n\nThe church seats 1375 people and is filled to capacity when used for occasions of a special nature, such as ecumenical services, high school graduation ceremonies, and special performances such as Handel's \"Messiah\" given by the Newfoundland Symphony Orchestra and its Philharmonic Choir, an event held first held during the Christmas Season of 1996 and again in 2008.\n\nThe church has a thriving Sunday School, active adult groups - United Church Women and Men's Fellowship Group - as well as a Junior and Senior Choir, Mime Group, and Messenger Group. Weekly Prayer Services are held and there are Sunday evening \"After Services\" following the regular evening worship.\n\nFrom Charles Lench, The Story of Methodism in Bonavista\n\nEncyclopedia of Newfoundland and Labrador\n\nhttps://www.heritage.nf.ca/society/methodist.html\n\nThis collection consists of two photograph albums showing the creation of Bowring Park during the years 1912 to 1914. The photos were taken by landscape architect, Rudolph Cochius. The albums were donated to the Archives and Special Collections by the Bowring Park Foundation in 2002. Rudolph Cochius had worked on landscape and road construction projects in Holland, Switzerland, Germany, Belgium and France before immigrating to Canada in 1911. The following year he went to St. John's to supervise the development of the new park. In a preliminary report on the project submitted to Sir Edgar Bowring, Cochius wrote \"It would hardly seem possible that a greater number of attractive natural features could be combined within such an area, almost surrounded as it is by the north and south rivers, whose well wooded banks make a very pleasing boundary for the proposed Park, while the interior of the property is for the most part open and well adapted for play-grounds and other public purposes.\"\n\nHe went on to recommend \"I think the most important play-grounds, such as tennis, bowling, etc., should be located in the vicinity of the shelter; but there should also be provided, on the level area below the bridge, a pool for bathing, etc. Suitable bathing houses should also be provided.\" Cochius spent the next two years designing the layout for Bowring Park and after it opened on July 14, 1914, he agreed to remain as park superintendent and oversee future development of the landscape.\n\nIn 1920 Cochius returned to Europe where he spent 1920 and 1921 as a town planner in Belgium. The Newfoundland Government wanted to create war memorial parks at the five main European battle sites where the Newfoundland Regiment fought and sustained major casualties. In 1922 Prime Minister Richard Squires approached Cochius to design these parks in France and Belgium. When this work was completed, in 1925, he returned to Newfoundland where he was appointed a member of the Newfoundland Highroads Commission. During this time he also designed Mount Pearl Park. In 1928 he was appointed to the first St. John's Town Planning Commission, established by St. John's City Council. In 1934, the Newfoundland Government appointed him to the governing board for the Markland Land Settlement, the first of the Commission of Government schemes to create a series of farming communities in rural Newfoundland. Rudolf Cochius married Marie Aarsen of Amsterdam on December 7, 1911. Cochius died in March 1944.\n\nFor more information on this please see the Finding Aid for the Bowring Park Photograph Albums Coll-311\n\nThis collection consists of correspondence prior to David Francis' travels to Newfoundland in 1947, a diary and annotated photo album that document his time in Newfoundland including travels to and from, and reports related to David Francis' forestry work while in Newfoundland.\n\nThe photo album was retrieved from the Exmouth Recycling Centre by Dan Fishman of Venn Ottery, Devon, England, UK in the autumn of 2007. Through the editor of Journal of Apicultural Research Fishman was able to make contact with David Francis' widow Jean (Jackie) Francis in January 2008 who added related material to this collection.\n\nIn 2016 Dan Fishman donated the material to Archives and Special Collections, Memorial University via Sally Goddard. It was received by Archives and Special Collections 10 April 2017.\n\nDavid Francis was born 17 March 1928 in Brecon, Wales to D. Stanley Francis, clerk and WWI veteran. Francis was married to Jean (Jackie) and they had three children, Diana, Alison, and David. After a short illness, Francis died on 4 June 2006 at the age of 78.\n\nFrancis was educated at the University College of North Wales (UCNW) in Bangor where he completed a BSc in Forestry and Botany. After university, he accepted a position in Canada conducting aerial and ground forest surveys. Following this position, Francis joined the British Colonial Service where he did similar work primarily in Ghana and also undertook a two-year secondment for post graduate study at Oxford University where he specialized in aerial surveying. He left the British Colonial Service in 1954 to join Huntings Aero Survey eventually becoming Managing Director. While in this position, he also worked as a consultant to the UN Food and Agriculture Organization. In 1988, David became temporary Director of the International Beekeeping Research Association (IBRA) holding that post until 1991.\n\nNewfoundland Trip 1947\n\nAs part of his educational program at UCNW, Francis was required to complete a practicum course related to the forestry industry. Francis' father, Stanley Francis, wrote Lord Rothermere seeking information regarding paper mills in Newfoundland as well advice on how to secure a practicum position in Newfoundland. Lord Rothermere provided Francis with support and introductions including the manager of the Anglo-Newfoundland Development Co. Mill in Grand Falls. Francis traveled to Newfoundland on board the SS North Devon and arrived at Wabana in Conception Bay Newfoundland on 19 August 1947. He worked as part of the Woods Division and documented his time in Newfoundland by keeping a diary and creating an annotated photograph album that covers his travels to and from Newfoundland and his work 7 August - 4 October 1947. Francis completed his work in Newfoundland and departed from Wabana on 22 September 1947 returning to his program of study in Wales.\n\nThe majority of information contained in this biography came from an obituary published in the Journal of Apicultural Research 45(3) p. 166, (2006).\n\nIn 1903, Richard Kelly sent a copy of his book, Galway as a Transatlantic Port, to Sir Robert Bond, the Prime Minister of Newfoundland. The original is housed in the Bond Collection, Coll-237, file 11.01.008. The file also contains a letter from Kelly to Bond.\n\nRichard John Kelly (1856-1931)\n\nFrom the Dictionary of Irish Biography, Cambridge University Press\n\nRichard John Kelly, a newspaper editor and lawyer, was born January 20, 1856 and educated at Blackrock College and QCG and became a reporter and editorial writer for the Tuam Herald before assuming full control.\n\nKelly was called to the bar in 1886 and built up a successful practice on the Connacht circuit, becoming a king's counsel in 1914. He published numerous legal works. Kelly took a strong interest in local matters and lobbied for the development of Galway as an Atlantic port.\n\nRichard John Kelly died 3 September 1931 in Dublin and was buried at Glasnevin cemetery. He married Edith Mackey of Southampton; they had one son, Richard Jasper and six daughters.\n\nFor more information on the Robert Bond collection, see the finding aid Coll-199\n\nSeries 11, in particular, consists of material related to Bond's interests and involvement in an all British trans-Atlantic shipping route which would include Newfoundland as a trans-shipment point.\n\nGeorge Bond (1850-1933), Methodist minister and writer, was born on 1 July 1850 in St. John's, the eldest son of John Bond and Elizabeth Roberts. He received his early education in St. John's, and in 1869 decided to enter the Methodist ministry. He was accepted as a candidate in 1871, and studied for the ministry at Mount Allison Methodist College in Sackville, New Brunswick; he graduated in 1874. He was ordained into the Methodist ministry at George Street Methodist Church in St. John's on 26 June 1876.\n\nIn 1891 Bond transferred to Nova Scotia. He served in Halifax at Grafton Methodist Church and Oxford Street Church, and at Canso. In 1895 he was appointed editor of The Wesleyan, a monthly church magazine published in Halifax.\n\nWhile he was serving in Nova Scotia, Bond spent a year, 1907-1908, in China and Japan studying the church's missionary work there. His visit took him up the Yangtze River where he saw first-hand the work of the Methodist missionaries in that part of the country . After his return to Halifax, he used what he had learned, together with photographs he had taken in China, to give public lectures on this facet of the church's work.\n\nGeorge Bond retired from the active ministry in 1923. He spent part of his retirement in Halifax, but also lived part of each year at the Grange, which he inherited after his brother's death in 1927.\n\nSeries 2.03 documents his involvement with the Methodist Church in China and includes: diaries, notebooks, lantern slides, posters, and books. One book titled The Story of The Sing Yet Family by J L Stewart, c. 1910 included \"Rag Dolls\" to use as illustrations to accompany the book.\n\nFor more information on the George Bond Collection, see finding aid Coll-236\n\nIn 1997 Janet Davis and Duke Kelloway, from Wesleyville, became the new owners of the old Job Kean premises in Brookfield, Bonavista Bay. Among the items purchased with the house were hundreds of Christmas cards dating from 1905 to 1926. The following year Ms Davis donated this wonderful collection to the Archives and Special Collections division of the Queen Elizabeth II Library.\n\nJob Kean's family moved from Flower's Island, Bonavista Bay, to Norton's Cove in 1878. The Keans were seafaring people. Job's uncle, the famous Captain Abram Kean, (who subsequently renamed Norton's Cove to Brookfield) was the most successful sealing captain in Newfoundland history. Like his uncles and brothers, Job participated in the seal fishery in the spring of the year and in the cod fishery on the Labrador coast during the summer. He served as captain of the sealing ship the S.S. Erik for 12 years and was captain of the S.S. Leopard during the Greenland disaster of 1898.\n\nCaptain Job Kean (1863-1945) married Virtue Maria Hann (1858-1929) of Cape Cove. They built a three-storey Mansard-roofed house in Norton's Cove in 1884, and around 1890 opened a shop that supplied ships' provisions - groceries, clothing, salt - in essence, everything from \"a needle to an anchor\". Job and Virtue had eleven children: five sons: Hedley Walter (d.1892, 7 mos.) Baxter Wesley (1895-1976) who was to remain a bachelor and inherit the family property: Alexander Smith (d. 1905, 10 mos.) and Charles (1901-1975) who married Lydia Parsons of cat Harbour, and six daughters: Maggie Marcilla Hann (b.1884) who married Baxter Barbour from Newtown; Sophie who moved to New York and subsequently married there; Gladys Murray (d. 1891, 7 mos.); Mary Jane (d. 1897, 5 mos.); Daisy, who married Job Wornell of Greenspond and later Joseph Bartlett; and Carrie who graduated from the Friends Hospital in Philadelphia as a nurse. The Kean shop was the centre of commerce in the Brookfield area. Located near the harbour front, Kean's ships had easy access to the shop when they arrived in port for supplies and merchandise. Kean's also supplied other local sailing vessels. According to residents, Aunt Virtue and her son Baxter would usually be found behind the counter. In addition, Virtue ran the telegraph and post office from these premises.\n\nVirtue Kean also became famous as a poet and a songwriter. According to tradition, she wrote the folk song \"Lukey's Boat\" and performed it one night at the Methodist Church Hall as a way of poking fun at local resident Luke Gaulton. As she sang verse after verse ridiculing both him and his boat, the audience roared with laughter. Gaulton later added a verse of his own, making fun of Virtue's well-known hypochondria.\n\nVirtue died in 1929 and in 1945, after Job's death, Baxter was left to carry on alone. At his death, the business passed to his nephew Job Kean, son of Charlie Kean, who eventually closed up shop in the 1970s and moved to St. John's.\n\nToday there is a new and thriving enterprise on the old Kean property. Janet Davis, after lovingly restoring the shop to its former glory, operates the Norton's Cove Studio from there in the award-winning heritage structure.\n\nFor more about Job Kean see the Archives finding aid Coll-339\n\nColl-333 Ranier Rees. This fonds consists of 42 original music compositions, written by Rainer Rees between 1988 and 1992, as well as research on Rees's life and work.\n\nRainer Rees was born in Berlin, Germany, on March 27, 1926. He was adopted by Robert Rees, a wealthy businessman. He studied piano and flute, and under the National Socialist Party, he became a member of the Hitlerjunge where he received more musical training.\n\nIn 1943, at age 17, Rees was called to active military duty and was sent to Russia. After the war, Rees returned to Germany and his musical studies. He attended the Amorbach, a musical conservatory, and studied at the Kirchenmusikschule (Church Music School), Regensburg, graduating in 1952.\n\nIn 1953, Rees accepted a job as organist and choirmaster at the Roman Catholic Cathedral of St. John the Baptist (later, Basilica) in St. John's. Aside from his Basilica work, Rees taught music theory and history, and conducted bands and choirs, at St. Patrick's and St. Bonaventure's schools, where he remained until 1987. Known as Professor Rees, between 1953 and 1990, he also taught piano privately, generally taking on 45 students each year at his home at No. 1 Rowan Street.\n\nSince his time in Germany, Rees had been interested in composing music, but did not do much during his time in St. John's until 1988. He was known for his improvisations on the organ, but these were never recorded. Between 1988 and 1992, he began to compose a large collection of music including 32 sonatas and 10 books of character pieces.\n\nFor more about Rainer Rees see the Archives finding aid Coll-333\n\nThis collection consists of three diaries handwritten by Joseph Iserhoff while he was in northern Ontario in 1902 and Labrador in 1905.\n\nJoseph C. Iserhoff was a Russian-Cree who lived and worked mostly with the Hudson Bay Company in James Bay. He was a descendant of a shipwrecked Russian sailor, John Leopold Iserhoff, who had married a Cree woman.\n\nDuring the course of his life he kept handwritten diaries. The first diary covers the period February to August 1902 while he was at Missinabie and Wawa City. It focuses on his employment and daily life, with reflections on labour and society in northern Ontario. It also contains a brief biography of Tom Swanson, who worked at the Hudson Bay Company's post and was a boat builder at Brunswick House. It is signed by Swanson and Iserhoff.\n\nThe second diary is a field diary and covers the period from June to August 1902. It overlaps with the first diary. It contains mostly detailed surveying logs for work done in northern Ontario.\n\nThe third diary is an expedition diary and covers the period from June to August 1905 when Iserhoff accompanied Mina Hubbard, George Elson, Job Chapies, and Gilbert Blake on a 576 mile trek through Labrador, from North West River to the mouth of the George River on Ungava Bay. Mina Hubbard was attempting to complete the journey that her husband, Leonidas Hubbard, began in 1903. George Elson, a Scots Cree, was the head guide on Mina Hubbard's expedition. (He had also accompanied Leonidas Hubbard's ill-fated journey). Job Chapies, a Cree from Missanabie was Elson's second in command. He was an expert whitewater canoeist. Elson, Chapies and Iserhoff had worked together at the Hudson Bay Company post in James Bay. Gilbert Blake (1886-1979), of Scottish-Inuit descent, was from a North West River settler family.\n\nIn 1906 Elson and Chapies accompanied Florence and Stephen Tasker on their expedition. The four successfully traversed the Ungava Peninsula in a single canoe.\n\nFor more about Joseph Iserhoff Diaries see the Archives finding aid Coll-498\n\nThe Barbour family of Newtown, Bonavista Bay, were very prominent in Newfoundland history. Members of the family are found in many walks of life including master mariners, sealing captains, school teachers, clergy, sailors, lawyers, politicians, and soldiers.\n\nAccording to family history, the first Barbour to come to Newfoundland from England was Captain George Barbour arrived in Greenspond, Bonavista Bay, in the early part of the 19th century. He had one son, Benjamin Barbour, (1809-1891). Around 1824 Benjamin Barbour moved to Pinchard's Island and in 1843 he settled at Cobbler's Island, a small island southwest of Cape Freels. In 1841, Benjamin Barbour married Rebecca Green of Greenspond (1820-1906) and they had eleven children: Joseph, William, Thomas, George, James, John, Benjamin, Samuel, Edward, Mary and Keziah. The first five sons were well-known sealing captains. Benjamin, Samuel and Edward were engaged in the fishery but later, Edward and Samuel went into business forming a partnership known as \"E.& S. Barbour\" in Newtown with a branch in St. John's.\n\nEdward Barbour was born August 2, 1862 at Cobbler's Island and died June 8, 1912 at the age of 50. He married Mary Jane Kean of Brookfield, Bonavista Bay, who was born July 2, 1866 at Flower's Island and died July 4, 1941 at the age of 75. Edward and Mary Jane Barbour had nine children: Clarissa, Sybil, Lester, Job Kean, Elsie, Clifton (died in infancy), Wilhelmina, Clarence (died in infancy), and Carlson.\n\nIn 1917 Lester Densmore Barbour, eldest son of the Edward and Mary Jane Barbour, enlisted with the Royal Newfoundland Regiment. He died on March 10, 1918, of wounds that were sustained during the Battle of Paschendale Ridge. While overseas, in England and in France, Lester Barbour wrote home regularly to his mother and sisters.\n\nThis collection consists of the Lester Barbour correspondence.\n\nFor further information about the Barbour family see The Exploits and Anecdotes of the Barbours of Bonavista Bay by Carl Barbour, 1973.\n\nThe ballads in this collection are typical examples of nineteenth century broadside printer's art with most sheets containing two ballads, many with a woodcut at the top and displayed title underneath it, and often with another decorative cut at the bottom of the sheet. The same woodcut is often used with different ballads. Sometimes the matching of woodcut, title and ballad are incongruous as in the ballad \"Old Folks at Home\" (Folder 4, #55). Some of the broadsides display the printers name and address, e.g. Folder 1, # 61: Joseph Ford, Printer, 70, Pinstone Street, Sheffield. In a number of cases (e.g. Folder 1, #66) the printers name and the date of printing is written in by hand: \"Joseph Tate, printer, July 1841.\" Folder 3 consists entirely of the work of London printers, particularly those operating in the Seven Dials district. All of the broadsides are in roman type; a few still display the long or descending s (?) (Folder #7, #'s 5 and 21, printer J. Pitts; and Folder 10, #11).\n\nThis diary was kept by a young woman in her mid-twenties during the year 1897. It contains a brief entry for each day; nothing spectacular, just ordinary events in the life of a young woman living in St. John's as the end of a century approached. She records the weather, what she did each day, shopping expeditions, church services, tea parties, staying at home with her mother. But the physical diary tells as much about the young woman as what she writes. Her literacy and writing ability attest to a good education. On the cover of the diary she has written her name and address. The family home was located at 31 Cookstown Road, a street which was up over the hill from downtown, running north through LeMarchant Road.\n\nThis diary should prove to be of interest to social historians, students of autobiography and women's studies, and all who are curious about the writings of a young woman in the St. John's of 1897.\n\nMargaret Jane Hill Mayo was born in St. John's in 1871 or 1872. She was the youngest of three children born to William Mayo (1829-1904) and Rebecca Butler (1833-1912). Her older sister, Mary, was born in 1861, married Eli Benson of Grate's Cove in 1885 and died in 1889 at the age of 28. Her brother, John Frederick, was born in 1869, married Rebecca Rogers, and died in 1944. William Mayo's grandfather, also William Mayo, came to Newfoundland from Great Britain with the Royal Newfoundland Company, a military force stationed in St. John's, in the 1790s. He married Frances King in St. John's in 1796 and they had four children, one of whom was James Mayo. James married Mary Dagwell of St. John's and they, too, had four children, the eldest of whom was William Mayo.\n\nVery little is known of Margaret Mayo's life. The Mayo's attended Gower Street Methodist Church, so it would seem likely that Margaret and her siblings attended the Methodist Academy, on Long's Hill. While she may have worked after finishing school, there is no indication of this in the diary that she kept during 1897. Her days in that year were filled with shopping, visiting, and attending church services and church-related events.\n\nOn August 8, 1901 Margaret married Lloyd Tocque Chancey (1865-1931) of St. John's. The ceremony took place at Gower Street Methodist Church and was conducted by Rev. William Rice, the groom's mother's brother. Lloyd Chancey was the youngest son of William George Fletcher Chancey (1820-1895) and Eliza Chancey Rice. The Chancey family had been resident in Newfoundland since the late-1700s, when Lionel Chancey (c. 1751-1822) moved to Harbour Grace from Collompton, Devon; Lionel was Lloyd Chancey's great-grandfather. Lloyd's middle name, Tocque, is probably after the Rev. Philip Tocque (1814-1899), author and clergyman of Carbonear, who married Lloyd father's sister, Eliza.\n\nMargaret Mayo and Lloyd Chancey had four children: one daughter, Pearl, and three sons, Victor, Reginald and Roy; only Roy married, to Blanche Adams. Lloyd Chancey was a barber by profession. The family lived first at Richmond Cottage on Freshwater Road, but sometime after William Mayo's death in 1904, they moved in with Margaret's mother, Rebecca, at 31 Cookstown Road. Records of their life together are scarce, but one can safely assume that Margaret spent her married life raising their children and being a homemaker. After her marriage she began attending her husband's church, the Queen's Road Congregational Church where she sang in the choir. Lloyd Chancey died on September 26, 1931. His wife survived him by ten years, dying September 19, 1941 after a lengthy illness.\n\nFor more about Margaret Chancey see the Archives finding aid MF-150\n\nThis collection consists of 135 photographs taken by Mary Schwall or her companions while on excursions to Newfoundland during 1913 and 1915. They are a pictorial record of a journey by ship from Nova Scotia to Newfoundland, a train trip from Channel to St. John's, and a trip from St. John's north around the coast to St. Anthony, across the Strait of Belle Isle to Labrador and down the west coast of the Great Northern Peninsula. There is evidence that the photographs were taken during two trips to Newfoundland, as two photographs have the date 1913 on the back with the caption, while another has the date 1915. The photographs provide visual documentation of Mary Schwall's vacations, but they also provide valuable information on Newfoundland communities during the early years of the twentieth century. Vernacular architecture historians have attested to the fact that several of the photographs show buildings only previously known through oral accounts. As well there is visual documentation of people, especially children, which can provide information on lifestyle, dress, nutrition, disease, and a host of other subjects.\n\nIn addition, there are 56 postcards with images covering much the same geographical area as the photographs, leading one to believe that they were purchased in larger communities during stopovers, or possibly in St. John's. Most of the postcards were produced for the St. John's-based companies Ayre & Sons, Ltd. and Dicks & Co.; 31 are coloured. Many of the postcards are scenics, but some are of people, especially 10 which depict Labrador natives in traditional dress or demonstrate aspects of their unique lifestyle.\n\nFor more information see the Archives finding aid Coll-206\n\nThis collection consists of one photograph album which contains 205 black and white photographs. The photographs were taken by Maxwell Cook when he served with the Royal Canadian Air Force in World War II.\n\nMaxwell Ernest Cook was born August 12, 1921, the son of Johanna (King) Cook and Tasker Cook, at St. John's. He had two brothers: Tasker and Angus, and, three sisters: Phyllis, Douglass and Rita. Little is known of his life, he was educated at Bishop Feild College and was active in the Church Lads Brigade (CLB), a Church of England organization. He married June Howse on October 1, 1946. They had two sons and three daughters.\n\nWith the outbreak of World War II and the subsequent building of the American base, Fort Pepperell, in St. John's, Cook worked with a construction company at the base. Sometime after this he worked at the Royal Canadian Airforce base in Torbay. In 1942 he joined the RCAF and moved to Lachine, Quebec, for three months training followed by training in London, Ontario. He went overseas in 1944. Following the war he worked with the fire departments in St. John's: first at the Central Fire Station in 1948 and then various stations, ending up at the Kent's Pond station until his retirement in 1972.\n\nHe was a member of the Masons, the Royal Canadian Legion, and a faithful member of St. Thomas's Anglican Church.\n\nMaxwell Cook died November 10, 1994.\n\nFor more information see the Archives finding aid Coll-415\n\nThis fonds contains 79 photographs taken by Dr. Wilfred Grenfell (1865-1940), during his initial visit to Newfoundland and Labrador in 1892 and given to Rev. Moses Harvey. They include several pictures of St. John's in the aftermath of the fire that destroyed much of the town on July 8, and many others documenting life in the many small fishing villages along the southern coast of Labrador. A further 30 photographs by St. John's photographer Simeon H. Parsons (1844-1908) depict a number of Newfoundland communities and ice bergs along the coast of the island. Three scrapbooks contain clippings of many of Harvey's newspaper columns and other items related to happenings in Newfoundland collected and saved by Harvey. A fourth scrapbook, in a similar collecting vein, was compiled by one of Harvey's sons. There is a bibliography containing a partial list of Harvey's writings in the early 1870s and copies of obituaries of Harvey, one written by Daniel W. Prowse, that appeared in the St. John's Evening Telegram on September 3 and 4, 1901.\n\nCustodial History:\n\nThe contents of the fonds, except for two items, were acquired from Frances Monroe Baird Cole, St. John's, Newfoundland, a grand-daughter of Moses Harvey, in 1983. The scrapbook labeled 2.01.001 was a gift of Rosalie Fowler, widow of former Memorial University History professor Ian MacDonald (1942-1977), who had acquired it during his research into Newfoundland history, in 1967. The scrapbook compiled by A. Stanley Harvey was transferred from the Newfoundland collection at the Newfoundland Public Library at the St. John's Arts and Culture Centre in 1994.\n\nRestrictions:\n\nThere are no restrictions on access.

He married Sarah Anne (\"Jessie\") Browne on 7 July 1852 in Cockermouth, England, and the couple had three sons, Alfred J., Charles James and A. Stanley. Harvey died in St. John's on 3 September 1901. Harvey was educated at Royal Academical Institute, Belfast, and was ordained to the Presbyterian ministry in 1844.\n\nFor more information see the Archives finding aid Coll-041\n\nThis album of photographs appears to be the work of Simeon H. Parsons (1844-1908), one of Newfoundland's earliest professional, self-taught and award-winning photographers. The photographs are very much in the style for which Parsons was noted and cover a wide geographic area, including the Burin Peninsula and coastal Labrador, in addition to more easily accessible areas such as St. John's and eastern Newfoundland communities. Internal evidence dates some of the images to around 1884-1885, and given that the recipient of the album, Joseph Laurence, died in October 1886, it would appear safe to assume that the album was compiled during those middle years of the 1880s. Some of the images may date earlier, possibly from stock photographs Parsons may have had on hand.The album contains some rare images of St. John's streets and buildings that were later destroyed in the 1892 fire that ravaged most of the downtown of the city. It also contains images of people at work in the fishery, particularly on the coast of Labrador; various communities on the Burin Peninsula and on the east coast of Newfoundland; rural scenes, including rivers, lakes and waterfalls; icebergs; groups of people, particularly several gatherings of Methodist clergy, some of whom Laurence was probably responsible for sending to Newfoundland.The album should prove beneficial to researchers interested in architectural and municipal development, the development of Methodism, the history of photography, the work of Simeon Parsons, and a variety of other subjects pertaining to Newfoundland in the latter half of the Nineteenth Century.\n\nFor more information see the Archives finding aid Coll-199\n\nSeries 8 in Coll-150 includes a handwritten nominal census for 1836 for the area from Exploits River to Cape John and Fogo Island. This census is just one part of the entire collection which has been scanned and placed on this website. The Peyton Family Collection consists of a variety of records deposited in the Archives and Special Collections division by Ernest Peyton of Gander, Newfoundland, as well as material concerning the Peyton family which was transferred from other collections in the Archives. Ernest Peyton is a direct descendant of John Peyton, Senior, the progenitor of a family which has played a prominent role in Newfoundland history: John Peyton, Senior (1747-1827), his son, John Peyton, Junior (1793-1879), and his son, Thomas Peyton, residents of Exploits Island and Twillingate. The material in this collection ranges from 1806 to 1908 and was mainly written by the Peytons mentioned above. There are a number of legal journals, wills, notary work for shipping wrecks, and writs issued for the Supreme Court. There are two voters lists for Twillingate district (1882 and 1889) which may be the only ones extant from before 1900. A valuable item is the 1836 nominal census for Twillingate and Fogo area which is probably the only one of its kind to have survived from before 1900. The register of fishing rooms (1806-1828) is a rare treasure which should be of interest to historians, demographers, geographers, and genealogists. Other material includes memorials of indentures generated through the Deputy Surveyor's Office, Twillingate, from 1851 to 1908; and, navigational aids for sailing from Newfoundland to a variety of places in Spain, Portugal, Italy, the United Kingdom, Canada, the United States of America, and the West Indies.\n\nFor more information see the Archives finding aid Coll-150\n\nPages from the Past is a collection of artefacts, manuscript and rare book leaves compiled by New York book dealer Alfred W. Stites (1922-2016) in the 1960s. Stites created 122 portfolio sets of leaves removed from rare books and manuscripts which he then sold to academic libraries. These collections are examples of \"leaf books\", a way of collecting and combining pages from damaged or incomplete books to show the progress of writing and printing over the centuries.\n\nPages from the Past: History of the Written Word (No. 10 of fifteen numbered portfolio sets) consists of 157 original leaves and artefacts, including a Babylonian clay tablet, a Babylonian cylinder seal, an Egyptian scarab seal, and several papyrus pieces. There are parchment leaves from medieval manuscripts, and pages from incunables, including a leaf each from the Nuremberg Chronicles (Koberger, 1493) and Sebastian Brant's Ship of Fools (Bergmann, 1498). The Collection also contains a wide range of pages from the hand-press period, including a leaf printed by Wynkyn De Worde (1516), a sample from Munster's Cosmographia Universalis (1559), a leaf from Martin Luther's German translation of the Bible (1584), as well as samples of fine calligraphy. There are early printed pages from Ireland, Mexico and the USA, one of the latter being a fragment of a Cotton Mather sermon printed by his sister in Boston in 1685. This leaf book concludes with fragments from some of the best late-nineteenth century and early-twentieth century printers, including William Morris and Bruce Rogers.\n\nFor more information, please contact librarian Patrick Warner at the QEII's Archives and Special Collections.\n\nSeries 3 in Coll-150 includes Legal Records from 1799-1910. The Register of rooms at Twillingate, 1806 to 1828 is just one part of the entire collection which has been scanned and placed on this website.\n\nThe Peyton Family Collection consists of a variety of records deposited in the Archives and Special Collections division by Ernest Peyton of Gander, Newfoundland, as wll as material concerning the Peyton family which was transferred from other collections in the Archives.

Col. Thomas F. Nangle, one of the Padres to the Newfoundland Regiment in France during World War I. He was the Newfoundland government's representative on the Imperial War Graves Commission, and was instrumental in acquiring title to the land from its French owners. He supervised the building of the memorial park to the fallen of the Newfoundland Regiment at Beaumont Hamel, and orchestrated the placement of the five caribou monuments at Beaumont Hamel, Gueudecourt, Monchy and Masnieres in France and at Courtrai in Belgium.\n\nNangle served as President of Newfoundland's Great War Veterans' Association during 1924, during which time he oversaw the construction of the National War Memorial in St. John's. Included in this fonds are press cuttings, Battalion, Brigade and Divisional documents, reports, and battle orders, as well as photograph albums documenting the activities of the Newfoundland Regiment and the building of the war memorials to the fallen soldiers of that regiment.\n\nMuch of the material in this collection was received as part of accessions from Joseph R. Smallwood: Two photograph albums, items 57 and 58, documenting the construction and dedication of the Newfoundland war memorial in 1924, accession number 93-067, acquired June 16, 1993. All other material (except item 55) including six albums of press cuttings, battalion, brigade and divisional documents, reports, battle orders, and two photograph albums, accession numbers 00-090 and 04-070, deposited in 2000 and 2004 respectively. This material was sent to Smallwood by Thomas Nangle on May 27, 1965 (see file 48a in Box 3 for their correspondence on this).\n\nItem 55.0, the bound volume entitled \"News Cuttings, F.M. Earl Haig's Canadian Tour, 1925,\" accession number 06-152, was acquired from Hugh Nangle, Thomas Nangle's son in 2006.\n\nFor more information please see the Archives finding aid Coll-308\n\nTrip to the Newfoundland Seal Hunt 1937 is a scrapbook compiled by P. Derrick Bowring in 1937 following a trip to the seal hunt, off the Newfoundland northeast coast, aboard the S.S. Imogene, a Bowring Brothers ship. It includes diary entries describing daily life onboard, photographs of sealers, stowaways, and seals. In addition there are original telegrams to Bowring Brothers head office from the front, and newspaper accounts of the voyage. There is also a detailed hand drawn chart of the ship's route. The Captain of the S.S. Imogene was Albert Blackwood.\n\nS.S. Imogene\n\nThe S.S Imogene was built at Southbank-on-Tees, England, by Smith's Stock Co. for Bowring Brothers of St. John's. The 715-ton ship, designed and powered to cope with Arctic ice, was the last vessel built specifically for sealing and participated in the seal hunt from 1929 to 1940. Captain Albert Blackwood was master of the Imogene from 1928 to 1936 during which time he averaged over 36,000 seals per year, a record in the industry.\n\nP. Derrick Bowring\n\nDerrick Bowring (1916-2009) was the eldest son of Cyril and Clara Bowring. Born in Liverpool, England, he came out to Newfoundland in 1935 to join Bowring Brothers Ltd. He rose through the management ranks, retiring in 1977 as Chair of the Board of Directors. He married Moira Gordon Baird, of St. John's, and they had four children: David, Paula, Vivian, and Norman.\n\nBowring Brothers\n\nIn 1811 Benjamin Bowring of Exeter, England moved to St. John's, Newfoundland and set up a watch making company. The business soon diversified into importing and selling a wide variety of goods and before long it had expanded into the cod and seal oil trade. In 1834 Bowring returned to England to establish a European end of the export trade operating out of Liverpool, leaving the St. John's branch to be managed by his son.\n\nCharles Tricks Bowring, Benjamin Bowring's eldest son, operated the business, Benjamin Bowring and Son, until 1841 when he returned to England to take over the management of the Liverpool establishment from his father and to establish C. T. Bowring and Company. Two of Benjamin Bowring's other sons, Henry Price and Edward, assumed responsibility for the St. John's firm which by then had become Bowring Brothers. In the 1850s both retired to England leaving the management to their youngest brother, John. The firm continued to be managed by Benjamin Bowring's descendants: Hon. Charles Bowring, Eric Bowring, Edgar Bowring, and Paul Derrick Bowring until 1977.\n\nBowring Brothers became a thriving business, outfitting fishermen and exporting fishery products. The firm became insurance agents and in the 1870s acquired the contract from the Newfoundland Government to provide a coastal steamer service. The firm also operated a passenger and cargo service between England and St. John's and to points along the eastern seaboard of the United States.\n\nBy 1980 Bowring Brothers was one of 160 subsidiaries controlled by C. T. Bowring and Company worldwide. In 1982 C.T. Bowring and Company, by now a public company, was taken over by March and Maclellan, and Bowring Brothers on Water Street, and the chain of shops across Canada and in the United States were sold.\n\nThe original scrapbook is located in the Michael Harrington collection, Coll-307\n\nFor more about P. Derrick Bowring see the Bowring Family collection, Coll-157\n\nWalter C. Sellars was born in St. John's, Newfoundland, on December 22, 1919, the son of Obe Sellars, a master-tailor originally from Western Bay and Ada Bowden, a native of St. John's. He received his early education at Holloway School and Prince of Wales College, graduating from the latter at age 14. Shortly after graduation, on June 30, 1934 he went to work with the St. John's mercantile firm, the Royal Stores.\n\nWith the outbreak of World War II in 1939, Sellars went to Halifax where he joined the RCAF and became part of the British Commonwealth Air Training Plan.\n\nAfter his discharge from the RCAF in 1945, Sellars attended university and obtained a Bachelor of Arts degree; Bachelor of Divinity from United College, Winnipeg, and a Master of Sacred Theology from Union Theological Seminary, New York. He served as a United Church minister until his retirement in 1979.\n\nHis collection includes sermons, as well as reminiscences of growing up in St. John's in the 1920s. In addition he donated drawings and plans for the H.M.S. Calypso.\n\nIn 1902 the Newfoundland Royal Naval Reserve (RNR) was formed through the combined efforts of Newfoundland and Great Britain. In September of that year HMS Calypso was commissioned at Devonport for service in Newfoundland as depot and drill ship for the RNR. Designed by Nathaniel Barnaby and launched at Chatham, England, in 1883, she was the last of the steam and sail class corvette. With a protective deck and steel hull cased in teak and oak, Calypso was perhaps the most successful of Victorian era cruising ship built for the Royal Navy.\n\n7.01 H.M.S.

The first and smaller diary is from April 1, 1854 to December 31, 1854. The second diary covers the period from August 24, 1875 to December 13, 1876. Both diaries are a daily record of the weather, births and deaths, along with accounts of arrivals and departures of shipping vessels at Twillingate. William Pearce Moss was born in 1838 in Twillingate, Newfoundland. We do not know any more about him then what is contained in these two diaries. The first of his diaries was written when he was 16 years old and the second, when he was 37. During these years, Twillingate was the major mercantile centre for Notre Dame Bay, and a fishing centre. It was ofter referred to as \"the capital of the north.\" Fishing and merchant vessels were entering and exiting the harbor daily and Moss records the names of some of these ships in his diaries. Provisions were brought to Twillingate on schooners, many of which were owned by the Slades, an English family running their mercantile business from Poole, England, to Newfoundland. The end of the 1800's marked an end to the boom. Sailing ships made way for steamers. The Bank Crash of 1894 and the Labrador fishing crisis saw an end to Twillingate's prosperity.\n\nFor more information on William Pearce Moss, see the Archives finding aid MF-387\n\nThis document, originally titled Vocabulary of Mary March's Language presented to Mr. John Peyton by the Revd. John Leigh, is believed to be an original list of Beothuk vocabulary created by Reverend John Leigh as told to him by Demasduit in 1819.\n\nIn March of 1819, the party of John Peyton Sr. and Jr. embarked on an expedition in the Bay of Exploits to recover stolen property they believed were taken and destroyed by Beothuk. As a result of the expedition, a Beothuk woman named Demasduit was captured. After her capture, she was taken to Twillingate and put into the care of Rev. John Leigh, an Anglican missionary for the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel (SPG). While in his care, Leigh composed two Beothuk vocabularies consisting of terms told to him by Demasduit; one written with the intent of sending it to the SPG, known as the SPG Copy, and the other written personally for John Peyton, known as the Peyton Copy.\n\nThe SPG Copy, titled A Vocabulary of the Native Red Indians' Language, Newfoundland, from Mary March, a female red Indian who was caught by Mr. John Peyton of the Exploits on the fifth March 1819, and presented to the Society for Propagating the Gospel in Foreign Parts by the Revd. John Leigh, Episcopal Missionary, Twillingate, is at The Rooms Provincial Archives.\n\nThe Peyton Copy was believed to be missing for a number of years until it arrived at the Archives & Special Collections in 2001 with the papers of Michael Harrington."
