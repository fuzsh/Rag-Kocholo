        "text": "This is a list of the premiers and Prime Ministers of Newfoundland and Labrador from the granting of responsible government in 1855 through dominion status, the colony joining Canadian confederation in 1949, and up to the modern day.\n\nFrom 1855 to 1909, the position of first minister was known as Premier. After the colony was granted dominion status in 1907, the position became known as Prime Minister (starting in 1909). Democratic government was suspended in 1934 and replaced by an appointed Commission of Government, which ended in 1949 when Newfoundland became a province of Canada. Since the reinstitution of democratic government in 1949, the position of first minister has again been known as Premier.\n\nFor governors prior to the establishment of responsible government see governors and lieutenant-governors of Newfoundland.\n\nContents\n\nColonial Prime Ministers\n\nThe Colony of Newfoundland was granted responsible government in 1855.\n\nName Party From To\n\nTemplate:Canadian politics/party colours/Liberal/row\n\nPhilip Francis Little Liberal Party May 7, 1855 1858\n\nTemplate:Canadian politics/party colours/Liberal/row\n\nJohn Kent Liberal Party 1858 1861\n\nTemplate:Canadian politics/party colours/Progressive Conservatives/row\n\nSir Hugh W.
