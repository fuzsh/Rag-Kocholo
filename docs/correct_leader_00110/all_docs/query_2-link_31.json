        "text": "The Dominion of Canada, or simply Canada, is a country in North America. Canada is the leader of what remains of the Entente and hosts the British government and Royal Family in exile ever since the British Revolution of 1925 and the collapse of the British Empire overseas. Canada stretches from the Atlantic Ocean in the east to the Pacific Ocean in the west. The country borders the United States to the south along the 49th parallel and the US territory of Alaska to the west.\n\nHistory[]\n\nGreat War[]\n\nCanada automatically entered the Weltkrieg in 1914 with Britain's declaration of war, sending volunteers to the Western Front who later became part of the Canadian Corps. The Corps played a substantial role in the Battle of Vimy Ridge and other major battles of the war. The Conscription Crisis of 1917 erupted when Conservative Prime Minister Sir Robert Borden brought in compulsory military service, over the objection of French-speaking Québécois. Proudly serving the Home Isles with men, weapons, food, and material to feed her growing war industries as a loyal Dominion, Canadians were distraught by the retreat from the continent, and greatly embittered by the military dominance of the Central Powers, which led to the collapse of the Western Front in summer 1919, the subsequent Armistice of Chantilly and the eventual signing of the Treaty of Versailles on 6 November.\n\nPostwar[]\n\nCanadian troops returned to their country throughout 1919 and 1920, when the last British troops had been withdrawn from the different theatres of war (like the Middle East following the Jerusalem Accords). Despite the German Empire's victory, the Canadians did not see themselves as losers; They had fought bravely until the end. Therefore, like in the rest of the British Empire, the Treaty of Versailles became known as \"Peace with Honor\" in Canadian media and propaganda. Canadian Prime Minister Sir Robert Laird Borden received a column of troops headed by the tenacious and well-beloved Canadian general Sir Arthur Currie, who was esteemed heavily by both the Entente and the Central Powers for his brilliant leadership of the Canadian Corps.\n\nPM Borden, dogged and tired after holding a Union Government together for the duration of the War, appeared visibly strained and prematurely aged as he proclaimed: \"I welcome you home from the fields of war, from which you knew no defeat!\" Canadian attitudes towards the war were divided. While patriots and imperialists took some comfort in the fact that the Empire had not been defeated per se, the fact that the war ended in an unfavorable \"draw\" heavily in Germany's favour kindled great resentment, especially in Quebec, where conscription riots and opposition to the war seemed to be justified in the light of the German dominance of the European continent.\n\nIn lead up to the end of the war, and the peace negotiations, the National Unity Coalition had begun to shutter. Prime Minister Robert Borden had lead for almost ten years, and most of that was a controversial, borderline-authoritarian war administration. Starting with the censorship and restrictions on political freedoms from the start of the war itself, then the tricks Borden played in the 1917 Federal Election with Woman’s Suffrage in order to get the majority needed for enabling the Draft, the actual passing of Conscription and subsequent Quebec Riots, and the formation of the 1917 National Unity ticket to guarantee he would stay in comfortable power regardless of the results of the elections (that many found a grotesquely flamboyant expression of establishment control).\n\nIt was generally agreed among the National Unity Party that the coalition would need to still be maintained for some transitional years post-war. However, since the ceasefire of the Treaty of Versailles at the end of 1919, many felt that (for Canada, at least), the war had essentially been over ever since that point. Prime Minister Borden, for his part - not only disagreed with this notion - but took the exact opposite perspective. Not only did he feel the Coalition should only see the Peace with Honour as the war’s end, and not treat it any differently than any other conclusion, all other factors irrelevant. He felt that, as the Peace (in reality) amounted to a loss for the Empire, the National Unity ticket should be maintained for a few years even longer than was planned in the case of a victory. The Coalition in itself was becoming controversial at this point, and so the idea of keeping it for what could be up to five more years sent earthquakes throughout the political world.\n\nThe shockwaves from finding out about the Prime Minister’s wishes almost brought down the National Unity Party in and of itself. In order to show the sincerity of his desires (and to help save the coalition, at this point), Robert Borden surprised observers by announcing he would step down as Prime Minister that year, and calling for new elections in 1921. The Conservative Party, as expected, smoothly transitioned to Arthur Meighan, the long appointed successor to Borden, who then became Prime Minister (and now by default was the new leader of National Unity). While the rest of the Canadian political field had an easy time lambasting the government, these drastic steps did manage to clam down their partners in the Coalition. Despite all the criticism and inherent infighting, the Coalition had control over the entire Canadian establishment, and (not unrelated to that fact) the majority of Canadians did legitimately approve of the National Unity ticket over opposition. Now that the Coalition was stable, and had withstood such a test, maybe it could last longer after all? The notion now seemed achievable - but in order to stay together, it would need to actually work together - to at least put some level of unified effort into the 1921 campaign.\n\nThe main obstacle to this came from Meighen himself. While Meighen was perfectly likeable to most voters, and even most of the Coalition (certainly more so than Borden) - campaigning for someone who’s public image was so attached to the Conservative establishment felt too close, for many, to just campaigning for the Conservatives. And looking to the future, many realized that the longer Borden managed to stay in charge - the more anger from voters - the larger that their eventual gains would be. As long he wasn’t able to do anything outside of the confines of the Unity ticket anyways, it might beneficial to have him around as long as Unity lasted.\n\nSo, the National Unity Party did manage to unify in 1921 - after Arthur Meighen stepped down as Prime Minister and leader of the Conservatives, in place for the new reappointment of Robert Borden. National Unity and Borden would go on to win a secure majority in the election, ensuring that Borden’s idea of - essentially - a “National Unity Era” could be realized. This ensured there would be a wholly establishment-lead transition for Canada from war to peacetime.\n\nOver the course of Borden’s post-war guidance, all the Union Liberals would eventually, as the years rolled on, rejoin their fellow party members in the opposition. It was clear from the start that Unity would not get a full term - but they did at least manage to fulfil Borden’s stated goal in 1920. It took to 1925 until the Government fell apart, finally losing any sort of sustainable majority. Ultimately, Canada’s political parties could agree to work within the constraints of the establishment - but inside those limits, they had always been too divided as to how to take Canada into the future to decisively lead the nation. Former Liberal Prime Minister Sir Wilfrid Laurier's optimistic prediction that the 20th century would be Canada's century seemed laughable now to most Canadians. Laurier himself had passed away during the War, seemingly taking with him to the grave the sunny prosperity that had affected Canada during his leadership in the late 19th century. Shortly after finally being made to call an Election in 1925, PM Borden lay in his room at the Chateau Laurier and passed away. His last words were of regret that he had never returned to his native Nova Scotia to rejoin the Celtic Diaspora.\n\nWith many of the heavyweights of the old Victorian and Edwardian political traditions dead, Canada weaved in and out of political obscurity and a deep sense of national malaise. All of this would be grimly impacted by the loss of the Home Islands to the 1925 British Revolution.\n\nAfter the death of Borden in 1925, Meighen became the leader of the Conservative Party (ending remaining bulk of the Unity Party, most of which had already left by 1925). But he was defeated by Mackenzie King's Liberal Party in the Federal election of 1925 (finally finishing off the last rump remnants campaigning with the Conservatives, but claiming to still be “Unity”). 1925 was a turbulent year in terms of Canada’s government. But despite their different approaches, Borden, Meighan, and King all never seriously questioned whether they would welcome the Royal Family and their fellow British Exiles into Canada. Despite this, once King was in office, it was clear he had a very different idea on how Canada would weather the storm - providing a drastically different vision of Canada’s government and society than the Exiles or their supporters might otherwise create.\n\nLeader of the Entente[]\n\nSyndicalist takeover in the Home Isles proved to be the determining factor in Canadian foreign and internal policy. As expected, hundreds of thousands of members of the British nobility, the wealthy businessmen, right-wing politicians, as well as wealthy people, frightened by the prospect of radical purges and violence like in France, fled to Canada. On top of being the closest large portion of the British Empire to the home isles, the country remained stable with the waves caused by the British Revolution having little direct political influence, unlike India, Africa and Australasia. Civilian exiles were joined by the elements of the British Army that had not mutinied, quickly resulting in Canada quickly taking the role of leader of the remnants of the Empire ahead of the West Indies Federation and the Dominion of India. Moreover, after a referendum in 1926 (rumored to be rigged by elements close to the Royal Family) the Dominion of Newfoundland was incorporated into the Elder Dominion.\n\nThe arrival of the exiles caused a great upheaval in Canadian political life. After Prime Minister Mackenzie King's refusal to let the British government in exile replace the Canadian government, the office of Governor-General was abolished, replaced by King George V himself. The Canadian and British armies were merged under mixed Anglo-Canadian leadership, although the navies remained separate. Initially, it was widely hoped that the exile would be brief, with syndicalist disadvantage ensuring most in Great Britain would welcome a royalist restoration. Instead, as the exiles have grown increasingly intrenched, Canadian politics has shifted to the right, and the still powerful Progressives were accused of syndicalist sympathies while Liberal PM King was blamed losing most of the Empire to syndicalist, nationalist or German takeover. Moreover, the king and the British exiles were quickly accused of interference in Canadian politics, directing them into a rearmament and offensive program conceived for preserving the unity of the Empire and preparing the reconquest of the Home Isles.\n\nThe liberal nationalists, who were only beginning to push for independence in the aftermath of the Great War, viewed the Exiles' influence on their politics with great discontent, stressing the declining health of King George, and would rather see their country as the peacekeeper of troubled America, a role that has been abandoned by the isolationist United States. However, all the hopes are now concentrated on George's eldest son, Edward Albert, Prince of Wales; who would be the first truly Canadian monarch... or nothing less than the British King-Emperor in exile.\n\nGreat Depression[]\n\nThe British Revolution was initially economically beneficial for Canada, with the government able to use the influx of skilled personnel and liquid wealth from Britain to further industrialize for the planed reconquest of the Home Isles. British gold ran out, however, and the Great Depression in the United States came to be felt in Canada by the late 1920s.\n\nPolitics[]\n\nCanada is a confederal parliamentary monarchy ruled by the King of the United Kingdom (as the office of Governor-General of Canada was abolished in 1926, its last occupier having been the Baron Byng of Vimy). Parliament is made up of the Crown, an elected House of Commons and an appointed Senate (many of its newer members being British exiles appointed by the King-Emperor). Each Member of Parliament in the House of Commons is elected by simple plurality in an electoral district or riding. General elections must be called by the Prime Minister within five years of the previous election or may be triggered by the government losing a confidence vote in the House. The Senate is comprised of British or Canadian hereditary or appointed members. British Exiles have had considerable influence since 1925, driven by the goal of a reconquest of the Home Isles and the rest of the Empire or, as PM King dubs it, \"The Anglo-Saxon World\". Officially this has occurred through the arrival of the King and by the appointment of many ex-British Lords in the Upper House, but the the Privy Council and Club members also wield considerable power unofficially.\n\nPrime Minister Sir Mackenzie King has attempted to consolidate Liberal power in Canada; this being a reaction to his party's concerns, shared by a significant portion of the Canadian public, that the primarily Tory exiles can exert undue power over the government. Canada's left wing, and especially Mackenzie King himself, fear the growing Authoritarianism of the Monarchy and the Exiles, doing whatever they can to subvert their undue influence on the Canadian Government. Another significant form of opposition comes from the French-speaking inhabitants of Quebec, worried by the growing influence of English speakers and the British exiles in particular, fearing even less representation of their interests in government, and the reduced influence of Roman Catholics over all.\n\nConscription Law: Volunteer Only Economic Law: Civilian Economy Trade Law: Export Focus Head of Government: Mackenzie King Foreign Minister: Lester B.

Howe Security Minister: Ernest Lapointe Intelligence Minister: None Appointed\n\nKing's Policies[]\n\nThe current leading party is the Liberal Party of Canada which, unlike the other Imperial countries, has not suffered the setback political liberalism endured after Herbert Asquith and David Lloyd George have been blamed for the loss of the Great War. Led by the prime minister Sir William Lyon MacKenzie King, not well viewed by the British Lords as the descendant of an anti-British nationalist family: having been Canadian Prime Minister when the British Revolution happened, he has contributed to redefine Canadian politics during the interwar years. Whilst still blaming the British lords and exiles for losing the Empire, he urged peaceful foreign policy based on mutually dependent, integrated economies with other the nations within “The Anglo-Saxon World”, a policy that hasn't been well received by Anglo-Canadian political and military elite aware of Canada's imperial obligations in the Pacific and the Caribbean. Even if he viewed the America First Union Party as a possible railing against American Syndicalism, he has vowed to support the traditional parties in place in the American continent, refusing to be the bearer of the \"Canadian Big Stick Policy\" promoted by some.\n\nHe has also implemented a strong anti-Syndicalist policy, taking advantage of the economic upturn and expansion of industrialization that was brought about by the infusion of British gold and technology: fearing a corresponding rise in the workers' protests, he refused to improve their rights and instead agreed with repressing the 1925 Winnipeg General Strike, with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, backed by Anglo-Canadian elites desiring to stamp out any possibility of another revolution breaking out. However the extent that many of the RCMP officers went to shocked many within the Canadian body politic (it was rumoured that the RCMP has been infiltrated by a group of men who are the sons of former members of the old Special Branch), and the Liberals under King reached out to members of the Canadian Commonwealth Federation (CCF) declaring that they were mere ‘Liberals in a hurry.’ King’s charm and reaching out to the left-wing in order to form a united opposition to the Conservatives has resulted in Canadian socialism and liberalism adopting a policy of gradual, legal reform. With this alliance, King was able to win the next federal election and regain the Premiership.\n\nKing's primary opposition is the British-backed Conservative Party led by Sir Arthur Meighen and Sir R.B. Bennett after the death of Borden, supported by British pre-Revolution political figures Stanley Baldwin, Neville Chamberlain, and Winston Churchill. Winning the 1930 general elections, the Conservatives have been able to present themselves as the party of Imperial unity. The endorsement of King George V, blatantly meddling in Canada’s political affairs, sealed the 1930 election for Bennett who nonetheless opted for a 100% Canadian cabinet. This government soon collapsed in 1931, letting the Liberals back into power. Bennett relied on the financial, political and philosophical guidance of British Exiles who exist in a ‘shadow cabinet’ of Canada’s traditional clubs for the Elite such as the Empire Club in Toronto, the Orange Order and the Chateau Clique in Montréal. Even under the Liberal governments of King, the Army and Navy staffs were packed with many of Britain’s top generals and admirals. Though a few generals such as Vanier (the top-ranking French Canadian in the army), Crerar, Stuart, and McNaughton have attained positions of influence in the army, the Navy is firmly in the hands of British admirals. The Air Force is the only Canadian institution to remain almost equally divided between Canadians and British Exiles. Proclaiming that the ultimate goal of Canada is the reclamation of Britain, Bennett recalled much of the British Fleet from the Pacific and the entire South African station, causing great resentment in the other Dominions and waged an inconclusive (though popular) war of skirmishes with the Syndicalist Navy in the Atlantic. While the Navy seems well prepared to renew the war against the Union of Britain, the Canadian army remains small and is in need of reorganization if it is to become capable of forcing a landing in Britain. Many Canadian officers look enviously at the Australasian army, which is no more advanced but is larger, better organized and better led as several of the more progressive British generals settled in Australasia.\n\nKing has met with great success in rallying the forces of Canadian liberalism by painting Meighen as a yes-man to the British lords. The Progressives, soon accused of Syndicalist tendencies, saw their influence fall quickly in Canada and by the end of the 1920s had been completely returned to the Liberal fold at the dominion level. While King’s policies are clearly constructed in view of how much the Canadian people will tolerate, his opportunism and accumulation of political alliances among the respectable members of the Left have built a powerful counterpoint to conservatives such as Arthur Meighen and R.B. Bennett. As dangerous as it seems, King is no fool. While his eccentricities are well known, he maintains an iron grip on his party’s discipline and arranges for himself to carry a safe riding in every election.\n\nRelations between the Liberal leader and the Royal Family[]\n\nRelations with the Royal family are strained. The king has no time for the Liberal leader, leading wags in the press to talk about the war between the \"Kings of Canada\". The Prince of Wales, the darling of Canada’s media, finds King to be nothing but a mere colonial and spends most of his time putting invaluable face-time for the Monarchy in Canada, especially in Quebec where he is doing his best to woo the French Canadians with his charm. His brother Albert however, possessed of a powerful sense of duty, has granted King a great deal of mutual respect, if not public endorsement, especially in regards to King’s contention that each British Dominion is a separate state with equal rights within a larger Empire, each with its separate crown for its head of state.\n\nThe other sons of King George V, the Duke of Gloucester and the Duke of Kent have kept a low profile in the Canadian public life, though the Duke of Kent’s interest in the development of airpower has led to his active engagement and elevation within the Royal Canadian Air Force. He has been instrumental in establishing an Inter-service Air Training Program in the Province of Alberta where pilots from all over the Empire, the Pacific, the Caribbean and even some from India. While some dismiss it as a costly and inefficient pet project, many are beginning to seriously consider expanding the Duke's scheme on a National, perhaps even an International, level. Henry has remained in the army and patronizes the Royal Military College in Kingston as an honorary colonel. It is suspected that he will be dispatched to one of the other Dominions as Governor-General to increase the connection between the Crown and its subjects.\n\nThe Quebec Question[]\n\nIn the French-majority province of Quebec, Maurice Duplessis, as leader of the paternal-authoritarian-like Union Nationale, stands unopposed in provincial politics. He has successfully eliminated overt support for syndicalism and ensured the survival of the Catholic identity of Quebec. His party has used the election slogan \"Survival\" in every provincial election to paint the Quebecois self-image as a religious struggle for God. Duplessis, however, has been more than willing to let Anglo companies build branch plants within Quebec and build up an impressive commercial presence so long as they did not allow unions and did not try to intervene in politics at all. He has even allowed some of them to have English-only workplaces. He maintains cheerful and amicable relations with the corrupt and patronage-driven government of Mitch Hepburn, the scandalous Liberal premier of Ontario.\n\nIn light of the fall of the Empire, Duplessis has enhanced relations with the Papal State and its dominant Catholic political culture, especially in hopes that a weak pope will be elected when the current incumbent dies. If such an election took place and the Pontiff would not interfere with Quebec, Duplessis is eager to maintain his close alliance with the Catholic Church. The Church essentially runs education and social welfare as a result of this arrangement and very few Quebecois receive higher education. Duplessis also maintains a relationship with the French Republic, not because of a kinship to the European French (whom many Quebecois accuse of abandoning them to the English), but to stamp out any possible Syndicalist infiltration by Commune agents. Assuming a strong Pope, Duplessis may be forced to reconsider his alliance as he would not want the Holy Father looking over his shoulder. King has long given up on trying to engineer a liberal government for the Province of Quebec and both Conservative and Liberal governments have refrained from interfering in Quebec politics so long as Duplessis does not stoke disloyalty or interferes with Federal politics.\n\nMilitary[]\n\nThe Battle of Vimy Ridge is one of Canada's proudest moments from the Great War. Succeeding where British and French forces had failed, Canadian troops dislodged an entrenched and skilled contingent of German troops from Vimy Ridge under the brilliant leadership of Canadian general, Sir Arthur Currie. This victory was attributed to the use of underground sapping, rolling artillery barrages and informing NCOs and rank soldiers of the battle's objectives so in event of commanding officers being killed, the mission could still go ahead. Canadian newspapers lauded the troops while the soldiers themselves wrote home enthusiastically to state that Canada had been born on the fields of Vimy, an equal to England and all her other allies. Because of this battle, Canadian soldiers are now considered some of the most elite soldiers on the face of the Earth.\n\nArmy[]\n\nAfter the Canadian army had returned from Europe there was a quick demobilization of forces to quell some of the concerns that Quebec had because of conscription. For the next four years, the Canadian military was downsized. The revolution of 1925 changed the military priorities of Canada and the military increased in size again. The Canadian army was not in a position to assist with an immediate attack on the home isles. Canadian hero Georges Vanier returned to the army in 1926 and joined the Royal Command Staff under Edmund Ironside. A reorganization of the army began in 1927 to accommodate the influx of British officers from around the empire and focused on infantry combat using the experience of Vanier who pioneered the counter to Ludendorff storm-troopers known as \"Reverse Infiltration\". The army has been brought back to a fighting strength by 1936 but it lacks modern equipment and manpower is a major issue.\n\nNavy[]\n\nThe Royal Canadian Navy had been almost completely demobilized by the time of the 1925 revolution. When the Royal Navy broke the socialist blockade and evacuated the members of the Royal Family within Britain, it was then able to escape to Canada along with them. Overnight Canada became a major naval power. In 1928 the Royal Navy, under the guidance of Admiral Keyes, began an ambitious building program to bring the Royal Navy up to a modern fighting level. All the naval services were expanded and improved with the emphasis being put on long-range ships. In 1933, Admiral Horatio Nelson Lay successfully argued for the inclusion of large fleet carriers to be added to the building program and Harry DeWolf, Canada's submarine pioneer, argued for the inclusion of modern submarines citing German successes in the last war. Keyes was unimpressed with the idea but as the submarines were easy to manufacture and could roam in secrecy to conduct reconnaissance on Union of Britain fleet movements, he was eventually overruled by the Prime Minister. By 1936 the production of the Royal Navy continued with two new carriers were laid down and a new naval base set up in Karachi.\n\nAir Force[]\n\nAfter the war in Europe, the services were demobilized and only casual flying was being done in Canada. When the Royal Air Force command staff arrived in Canada in 1925 the future looked bright for the Canadian air services but instead, the commanders were unable to decide how the service should be handled. Canadians like Billy Bishop wanted the air force to be a Canadian run service but the British commanders refused to work under Canadians. The prioritization of the Navy had significantly reduced the resources available to the service and by 1930 both the RAF and RCAF were running independent of each other and being commanded loosely by the Royal Command Staff in Ottawa. Bishop and Hugh Trenchard were consistently at odds over the design of the air force and by 1936 only a few air wings had been brought up to fighting strength.\n\nIn comparison to the problems of the RAF and RCAF, the Royal Canadian Naval Air Service was one of Canada's best military services. It was demobilized like the other services after the war but with the expansion program of the navy in 1928 the expansion of the service as being a support element for the navy begun. The introduction of the aircraft carriers to the naval program was a major boon for the RCNAS and unlike the traditional air force, there was no question this would be a Canadian run service. Admiral Lay and Billy Bishop worked together to make a flying service for the Royal Navy with the emphasis on pilot skill. The RCNAS is not the most professional service in the Canadian military but Royal Navy captains are more than willing to overlook infractions simply to keep these skilled aviators in the skies above them happy. By 1936 the RCNAS was considered the best service in the military, as well as the highest paying, but also lacked modern equipment.\n\nForeign Relations[]\n\nThe British Naval Station in India remains strong enough to be threatening, but too weak to maintain order in the Indian Ocean, and is growing old in the face of the German Naval Squadron based at Pondicherry. The Canadians maintain it to keep a link with the ageing British technocrats in the Indian Raj’s government.\n\nThe fall of the old Empire and the rebellion of several subject peoples has resulted in a great deal of racism in Canada, South Africa and Australasia against people who are visibly Non-British, and the Conservative party, back when it was still in power, urged the Australasians to deploy a sizable portion of its army to India to “keep the natives in line”. This further antagonized the rocky relationship between Canberra and Ottawa, and King astutely dropped the matter once he was in office. While they are not Anglo-Saxon, King has made a point of declaring on no less than 7 public occasions that India has “been a part of the Empire longer than most of Canada and that there exists a special place for them, side by side with their fellow citizens of the Empire…” The fact that King used the word citizens, as opposed to subjects, has caused a great deal of debate over the future of the Empire in political circles. With the advent of more sophisticated communication technology, many proponents of a global union of Imperial British states are gaining more prominence within Liberal circles, especially as it would place a prospective reclaimed Britain on an equal footing with Canada within such a political arrangement.\n\nWhile some elements within the Exile community want to also recapture Ireland, Sir Mackenzie King has embarked on a policy of reconciliation with the “Lost Dominion.” In the event of war, King has suggested sending a diplomatic offer to Michael Collins that offers a public, binding, international decree by the British crown to recognize the sovereignty of the Irish Republic and a vow to never violate that sovereignty, and in return, attain port rights and airstrips in Ireland to carry out the war against the Union of Britain.\n\nThe Dominion of Canada leads the Entente; a revanchist alliance with steel bonds forged between its members through the earlier shared struggle of the Weltkrieg. Canada has friendly relations with all Entente members as well as the United States of America.\n\nThe Dominion of Canada has extremely hostile relations with the Union of Britain, the Socialist Republic of Italy, the Commune of France and the German Empire.\n\nEconomy[]\n\nThe Canadian economy is agriculturally-based. The export of a large amount of produced grain in Saskatchewan and Manitoba fuels the Canadian economy's recovery during the Great Depression, which by the mid-1930s has become rapid. The Canadian wheat economy faces competition with the Platine wheat economy - and while the Platine wheat economy mainly exports within the Americas, the Canadian wheat economy aims at exporting to Europe, Asia and Oceania.\n\nCanada's Maritime provinces includes large amounts of fisheries, supporting a now booming industry. A sizable number of coal mines also exist in the Maritime provinces, which previously exported exclusively to Great Britain. Canada also sits on large iron and crude oil deposits, however they remain unexploited. It is completely up to the mercy of the Canadian Government whether it remains this way, or are excavated to power Canada's hungry industry.\n\nCanada primarily trades with other members of the Entente, and their main export markets are the USA and Caribbean. Trade with the German Empire and Mitteleuropa is slight, with Canadian goods competing poorly with cheaper products from Germany's east European satellites independent of the system of tariffs which incentivize trade within the German block ahead of elsewhere. Canada's economy remains indirectly linked with Germany through the USA, and a major up or downturn in the latter would likely have a modest effect on the former in the same direction.\n\nIndustry[]\n\nThe Dominion of Canada has:\n\n13 Military Factories\n\n25 Civilian Factories (11 for Consumer Goods)\n\nAfter all possible build-ups by the Canadian focus tree:\n\n+16 Civilian Factories\n\n+0 Military Factories\n\n+12 Dockyards\n\nResources (Overseas territories not included)\n\n12 Units of steel\n\n24 Units of aluminium\n\n2 Units of oil\n\nCulture[]\n\nThe Culture Groups[]\n\nThe primary cultures of Canada are English, Scottish and Anglo-Canadian.
