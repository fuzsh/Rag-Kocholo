        "text": "ARCHIVAL MOMENT\n\nAugust 17, 1979\n\nOn August 17, 1979, Royal Assent was given to legislation adopting the Ode to Newfoundland as the official provincial anthem of the province of Newfoundland.\n\nThe song the “Newfoundland” now known as the “Ode To Newfoundland” was sung for the very first time on January 21, 1902 at the Casino Theatre in St. John’s. The local St. John’s newspaper, The Daily News, reported that the new song was greeted enthusiastically.\n\nThe newspaper article reads:\n\n“Miss Frances Daisy Foster rendered with exquisite feeling a new song entitled “Newfoundland.” It proved a pleasant surprise and the general appreciation of it was marked by the audience joining spontaneously in the chorus.”\n\nThe “Ode to Newfoundland” was composed by Governor, Sir Cavendish Boyle, the original score was set to the music of E.R. Krippner, a German bandmaster living in St. John’s but Boyle desired a more dignified score. It was then set to the music of British composer Sir Hubert Parry, a personal friend of Boyle, who composed two settings.\n\nThe Daily News reporter knew that he had heard something special when he heard the ‘Newfoundland’ being sung for the first time , he wrote: “he (Boyle) has given us a poem which may be chosen as the Colony’s own anthem.”\n\nOn June 21,1902 it was “resolved by the Committee of Council that the Ode “Newfoundland”, written by His Excellency Sir Cavendish Boyle, K.C.M.G., Governor of Newfoundland, with the musical setting by Professor E.R. Krippner, be approved, and officially recognized as the Colonial Anthem.”\n\nThat should have been it, all was required was the signature of the Governor. The Governor however refused to sign. Arthur Mews, The Deputy Colonial Secretary of the day wrote:\n\n“His Excellency (Governor Boyle) from motives of delicacy, did not formally approve the same at that time.”\n\nThe “delicacy’ was that Governor Boyle was both author of the Ode and Governor, it simply did not look proper that he sign off on his own Ode.\n\nThe Premier of the day, Sir Robert Bond, determined that the Ode become the official anthem suggested that given the hesitation of Governor Boyle that approval be given by the Hon. W.H. Horwood, C.J. , Administrator of the Government. But it was not to happen.\n\nBy 1904, the ‘Newfoundland’ had become firmly established, in the minds of most people, as the “official anthem” of the Dominion of Newfoundland, there was no Government function without the ‘Newfoundland’, it was sung at most public gatherings, in parish halls and concert halls. It was so firmly established that in the 1909 General Election, Robert Bond proposed that if elected he would be certain to make it the “official” anthem of the country.\n\nBond lost the election.\n\nNothing was said of the official status of the Ode until 1972. Frank Graham in his book “We Love Thee Newfoundland” Biography of Sir Cavendish Boyle, wrote:\n\n“At an event in St. John’s it was observed that a certain military group failed to observe protocol and the proprieties by coming to attention and showing the proper respect during the playing of Newfoundland’s anthem. The commanding officer was called on the carpet to explain the unseemly conduct of his men. The officer defended himself and his group by explaining that there was noting on the statue books to confirm the fact that the Ode was Newfoundland’s Provincial anthem. It transpired that he was right.”\n\nIn 1974 their was a resurgence of interest in making the Ode official, (driven by Lieutenant Governor, Gordon A. Winter,) that resulted in the introduction of the Provincial Anthem Act for the Province of Newfoundland. On May 2, 1975 the legislation became official. It reads:\n\n“The poem commonly called the Ode to Newfoundland, composed by Sir Cavendish Boyle, Governor of Newfoundland from 1901 -1904, as it appears in the schedule is adopted as the provincial anthem of the Province of Newfoundland and shall be officially known and recognized as the Ode to Newfoundland.”\n\nThe Ode to Newfoundland\n\nWhen sun rays crown thy pine clad hills,\n\nAnd summer spreads her hand,\n\nWhen silvern voices tune thy rills,\n\nWe love thee, smiling land.\n\nRefrain\n\nWe love thee, we love thee,\n\nWe love thee, smiling land.\n\nWhen spreads thy cloak of shimmering white\n\nat winter’s stern command\n\nThrough shortened days and\n\nstarlit nights we love thee frozen land\n\nWe love thee, we love thee, we love thee frozen land.\n\nRefrain\n\nWe love thee, we love thee,\n\nWe love thee, frozen land.\n\nWhen blinding storm gusts fret thy shores\n\nand wild waves wash their strands,\n\nThrough spindrift swirls and tempest roars\n\nwe love thee windswept land,\n\nWe love thee, we love thee, we love thee\n\nwindswept land.\n\nRefrain\n\nWe love thee, we love thee,\n\nWe love thee, windswept land.\n\nAs loved our fathers, so we love,\n\nWhere once they stood, we stand;\n\nTheir prayer we raise to Heaven above,\n\nGod guard thee, Newfoundland\n\nRefrain\n\nGod guard thee, God guard thee,\n\nGod guard thee, Newfoundland\n\nRecommended Archival Collection: Take some time to look at MG 956.110 at the Rooms; this cover illustration featuring the Ode to Newfoundland depicts some of the iconic symbols and images of Newfoundland and Labrador. https://www.therooms.ca/collections-research/our-collections\n\nRecommended Book: “We Love Thee Newfoundland” Biography of Sir Cavendish Boyle, K.C.M.G.

Toronto: Tundra Books, 2003.\n\nTartan Day in Newfoundland and Labrador\n\nTartan Day in Canada, April 6th, has become a yearly event. The concept of Tartan Day began at a meeting of the Federation of Scottish Clans in Nova Scotia on 09 March 1986.\n\nTartan day was chosen to promote Scottish Heritage by the most visible means. The wearing of the Scottish attire, especially in places where the kilt is not ordinarily worn, i.e.: work, play or worship.\n\nStarting originally as ‘Tartan Day in Nova Scotia’, Jean Watson approached every provincial Legislative Assembly in Canada, as well as other Scottish-cultural societies across Canada, to help get such a date established.\n\nAfter ten years of work, Tartan Day in Canada was approved in every Provincial Assembly from sea to sea by Premier’s proclamation or Members’ Bill. The Provincial Government of Newfoundland & Labrador officially adopted the Newfoundland tartan on 6 April 1995.\n\nThe official tartan of Newfoundland and Labrador\n\nThe official tartan of Newfoundland and Labrador was designed in 1955 by Samuel B. Wilansky, a local store owner on Water Street in St. John’s. It was registered in the Court of the Lord Lyon in 1973. The white, gold, and yellow come from the province’s official anthem, “Ode to Newfoundland”:\n\nThe green represents the pine forests, the white represents snow, the brown represents the Iron Isle, and the red represents the Royal Standard. Its International Tartan Index number is 1543.\n\nThe region of Labrador also has its own design of tartan created by Michael S. Martin. The tartan of Labrador, was inspired by the influence of Donald Smith. Scots migrated to Labrador in the 19th century to work for the Hudson’s Bay Company (HBC). Sir Donald Smith, (1836 – 1914) HBC’s chief trader for Labrador in 1852 and established the company’s headquarters at North West River. Smith lived at Labrador for 21 years before becoming Lord Strathcona in 1897. Smith became engaged in many other business and political ventures, including helping to make Canada one nation through the visionary plan of a railway system connecting the entire country. As the co-founder of the Canadian Pacific Railroad, Smith spearheaded the building of the trans-Canada railroad and drove the last spike in 1885. The Labrador tartan was sent to the Scottish Register of Tartans, which assigned reference number 10004 to the tartan. See: https://www.tartanregister.gov.uk/tartanDetails?ref=10004\n\n“Some of the greatest builders of Empire in Terra Nova have been and are Scotsmen … “\n\nThe Scottish are no stranger to Newfoundland and Labrador, in fact it has been said that “Some of the greatest builders of Empire in Terra Nova have been and are Scotsmen … “ The evidence is persuasive.

There was a brief swearing-in ceremony at Government House for the new lieutenant-governor, Sir Albert Walsh, who then accepted a Canadian citizenship certificate on behalf of all Newfoundlanders. Those present at the ceremony listened to a broadcast of the ceremonies in Ottawa before attending a reception. Later in the day, Walsh swore in the first members of the interim government. Despite the fierce contest that had led to this point, the day passed very quietly, with little demonstration either for or against Confederation.\n\nThe official ceremonies at Ottawa took place on Parliament Hill. The Peace Tower carillon began by playing “Squid Jigging Ground,” a traditional Newfoundland song. Official speeches then followed, coming from Prime Minister St. Laurent and F. Gordon Bradley. The Prime Minster said:\n\n“In greeting you as fellow citizens we do not feel that you in Newfoundland have ever been strangers. In peace we have been happy to live and work beside you. In two wars we have been glad you were in our company and we in yours. We have the same traditions and the same way of life… He continued … During the centuries since the original settlement of Newfoundland, the people of your island have met the forces of nature, on sea and on land. In adversity and in prosperity they have developed qualities of heart and spirit for which they are renowned.”\n\nF. Gordon Bradley, chosen to act as the new province’s first representative in the federal government; said to those gathered:\n\n“… This is a day which will live long in North American history. It is a day of fulfilment – fulfilment of a vision of great men who planned the nation of Canada more than eighty years ago …. I fancy we see them now, bending over this scene in silent and profound approval …. Thus we begin life as one people in an atmosphere of unity. We are all Canadians now ….\n\nJoseph R. Smallwood would become the first premier.\n\nSt. Laurent then made the first few cuts into a blank escutcheon that had been reserved for Newfoundland’s coat of arms since the reconstruction of the Centre Block after the fire of 1916.\n\nAfter a speech from the Governor General, events concluded with the singing of “God Save the King,” “Ode to Newfoundland,” and “O Canada.” As events were broadcast via radio, people from Newfoundland were able to listen in.\n\nRecommended Archival Collection: At The Rooms Provincial Archives Division explore GN 154 a collection that consists of minutes of the delegations 41 meetings in St. John’s; letters to the Chairman and the Secretary of the Newfoundland Delegation to Ottawa from societies, business firms, Labour unions, etc. regarding the effect of Confederation on various organizations.\n\nRecommended Exhibit: Here, We Made a Home.
