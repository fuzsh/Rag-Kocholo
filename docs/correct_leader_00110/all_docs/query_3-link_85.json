        "text": "The Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC or the Corporation) is a wholly-owned Government corporation created in 1933 under a Delaware charter and reincorporated June 30, 1948, as a Federal corporation within the Department of Agriculture by the Commodity Credit Corporation Charter Act (PDF, 53 KB).\n\nCCC funds are used to implement specific programs established by Congress as well as to carry out activities under the broad authorities of the CCC Charter Act. At this time, the principal programs established by Congress that are funded by CCC include:\n\nDomestic farm income, price support and conservation programs under various statutes including the Agricultural Act of 2014;\n\nForeign market development and other international activities of the Department of Agriculture under several statutes including the Agricultural Trade Act of 1978;\n\nActivities of the United States Agency for International Development under Title II of the Food For Peace Act.\n\nOrganization\n\nCCC is managed by a Board of Directors (Board) subject to the general supervision and direction of the Secretary of Agriculture. Under the CCC Charter Act, the Secretary is an ex-officio director and chairperson of the Board. The Board consists of seven members, in addition to the Secretary, who are appointed by the President of the United States. Officers of CCC maintain liaison with other governmental officials such as the United State Trade Representative and private entities and organizations with interests in CCC-funded operations. CCC programs must be approved by the Board of Directors or the Secretary of Agriculture. Currently, all members of the Board and all Corporation officers are USDA officials. To learn more about the Commodity Credit Corporation bylaws, please visit the CCC bylaws (PDF, 1.6 MB).\n\nCCC does not have any employees, using the employees of federal agencies in the conduct of its operations. Domestic agricultural price and income support programs and the Conservation Reserve Program are carried out primarily through the personnel and facilities of the Farm Service Agency (FSA). International programs are carried out by the Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS) and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID). The majority of CCC conservation programs are implemented by the Natural Resources and Conservation Service (NRCS). Other USDA agencies, such as the Agricultural Marketing Service and Rural Development Mission area agencies, also carry out CCC programs or, as directed by Congress, utilize funds of the Corporation to implement specified programs. CCC is authorized to contract for the use of privately-owned facilities in carrying out its activities.\n\nCCC Board of Directors\n\nTom Vilsack, Chairperson, Secretary of Agriculture\n\nVacant, Vice Chairperson, Deputy Secretary of Agriculture\n\nRobert Bonnie, Member, Under Secretary, Farm Production and Conservation (FPAC)\n\nJenny Moffitt, Member, Under Secretary, Marketing and Regulatory Programs\n\nAlexis Taylor, Member, Under Secretary, Trade and Foreign Agricultural Affairs\n\nGary Washington, Member, USDA Chief Information Officer\n\nJohn Rapp, Member, USDA Director of Budget and Program Analysis\n\nCCC Officers per May 2022 Bylaws\n\nRobert Bonnie, Under Secretary, FPAC, President\n\nZach Ducheneaux, Administrator, Farm Service Agency, Executive Vice President\n\nRobert Ibarra, Chief Operating Officer, FPAC Business Center, Secretary to the Board\n\nVacant, Staff Specialist, Farm Service Agency (FSA), Assistant Secretary\n\nLucas Castillo, Chief Financial Officer, FPAC Business Center, Chief Financial Officer\n\nFinancing\n\nCCC has an authorized capital stock of $100 million held by the United States with the authority to have outstanding borrowing of up to $30 billion at any one time. Its capital structure is replenished each year by appropriations to restore net realized losses on support operations and to reimburse costs of other programs.\n\nBorrowing\n\nFunds are borrowed from the Treasury and may also be borrowed from private lending agencies and others. The Corporation reserves a sufficient amount of its borrowing authority to purchase at any time all notes and other obligations evidencing loans made by such agencies and others. All bonds, notes, debentures, and similar obligations issued by the Corporation are subject to approval by the Secretary of the Treasury as required by the Act of March 8, 1938 (15 U.S.C. 713a-4). Reservation of borrowing authority for these purposes has not been required for many years.\n\nInterest on borrowings from the Treasury (and on capital stock) is paid at a rate based upon the average interest rate of all outstanding marketable obligations (of comparable maturity date) of the United States as of the preceding month. Interest may also be paid on other notes and obligations at a rate prescribed by the Corporation and approved by the Secretary of the Treasury.\n\nAppropriations\n\nUnder Section 2 of Public Law 87-155, the Act of August 17, 1961 (15 U.S.C. 713a-11), annual appropriations are authorized for each fiscal year, commencing with 1961, to reimburse CCC for net realized losses. The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987 amended Public Law 87-155 to authorize that CCC be reimbursed for its net realized losses by means of a current, indefinite appropriation as provided in annual appropriations acts."
