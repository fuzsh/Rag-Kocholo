        "text": "Laying some track - William Whiteway\n\nInto all the complexities of Newfoundland politics came William Whiteway. He was born in Devon, England in 1828. His family had long been involved in Newfoundland trade and he was sent over to apprentice with a merchant in 1843. Later he became a lawyer. Throughout his political career, his reach often exceeded his grasp, but he was tactful and often tactically successful in getting what was required. Originally representing the north-eastern constituency around Twillingate and Fogo (map coming up), he first became premier as a member of the \"establishment\" Conservative Party in 1878.\n\nWhiteway thought if Newfoundland was ever to get away from the ups and downs of the fishing industry, it had to diversify its economy. The best way to do this was to develop what he assumed to be the vast mineral and forest wealth in Newfoundland's interior. Travelling from a remote constituency, he could see the benefit of pulling settlements together with a railway. Everyone else in North America was doing it.\n\nBritish colonial officials didn't want to financially support Whiteway's railway, claiming it was a local project and of no use to the British Empire. They were cool to the idea of locating the western terminus on the French shore in case it inflamed British-French relations. But they liked Whiteway's tone when he was at meetings with the French in London - he seemed more open to compromise about the French Shore than other Newfoundlanders.\n\nTurning down a Canadian contractor, Whiteway pushed a railway construction bid from a New York syndicate through the Newfoundland legislature in 1880. The railway was to be a narrow gauge line from St. John's to Hall's Bay on Notre Dame Bay.\n\nHere's the map :\n\nYou can see Whiteway's original constituency location of Twillingate and Fogo at the right.\n\nThis map also has two features I have found on no other from this era, circa 1900 :\n\nHall's Bay on Notre Dame Bay (Hall B) ;\n\nand the 1783 Treaty of Paris location of the eastern boundary of the French Shore - dotted line, top right.\n\nThe French Shore ran counter-clockwise around the north and west shores of the island from this point.\n\nIf you care: The railway branchlines to Bonne Bay and Halls Bay were perhaps projected, but never built.\n\nThe actual route to Hall's Bay was to be a direct northwest routing from St. John's - not a reversing direction branchline as shown.\n\nThe Newfoundland Railway Company (NRC) of the New York syndicate started building in 1881 - the same year as the new \"CPR Syndicate\" in Canada. Bonds for the NRC were sold to investors in England to raise the necessary capital.\n\nIn 1882, a little bit of change was suggested by the New York syndicate :\n\nMake the line standard gauge.\n\nTake the railway across the island to be part of a \"Steel of Empire\" idea which would connect with Canada via ferry - as Sandford Fleming had promoted.\n\nBuild a drydock in St. John's - a pet idea of Whiteway's\n\nSymbolic of what was about to happen, the NRC syndicate was using inadequate narrow gauge locomotives which were being discarded by the PEI Railway. Built in England, they were appropriate for cutting through fog, but snow was another matter."
