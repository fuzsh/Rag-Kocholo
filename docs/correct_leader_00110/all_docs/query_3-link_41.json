        "text": "Vision:\n\nTo create a stronger, more resilient and innovative future for Miami by orchestrating a deliberate and objective project selection process, city wide requirements and citizen input, and optimizing all available resources.\n\nImplementation Strategy:\n\nThe City of Miami is approaching the bond spending in a systematic manner across the five categories. We have developed five themes to guide the project selection process.\n\nGuiding Themes:\n\nSafety: Enhance public safety by decreasing the frequency and severity of dangerous events. Better equip the city to mitigate and/or respond to emergencies and minimize the negative impact to citizens.\n\nWellness and Quality of Life: Preserve and enhance Miami’s reputation as a desirable place to work, live, and play.\n\nEquity: Distribute investment benefits fairly across the city and income levels while maintaining cohesiveness of social fabric and diversity.\n\nEconomic Return: Use cost and benefit framework that considers effects on the economic and financial vitality of the city, local property value and insurance rates, job creation, and education investment.\n\nModernization Future City: Advance new technologies and innovation to transform Miami in a smart city of cutting edge of smart city development.\n\nThe Bond program is being executed in three phases, Immediate Impact, Gain Momentum and Long Term solutions.\n\nImmediate Impact:\n\nThe bond kick-off had an immediate impact with the launching of over 100 ready projects that will be completed in the next three years. The projects were selected based on the five guiding themes, each bond category’s goals and objectives, and with coordination with our citizens and partners. The deliberate selection process resulted in a first tranche of $58.7M to be invested in key projects spread across all bond categories and sections of the city. Tranche one is divided in two series of allocations, Series A and B. Series A projects are focused on infrastructure, and Series B projects are concentrated on Affordable Housing solutions.\n\nSeries A – Infrastructure – to include:\n\nRoadways\n\nParks and Cultural Facilities\n\nPublic Safety\n\nSea-Level Rise and Flood Prevention\n\nSeries B – Affordable Housing – to include:\n\nDevelop and invest in Affordable Housing solutions\n\nInitiate and continue Affordable Housing studies, plans and assessments\n\nGain Momentum:\n\nThis phase provides an opportunity to wisely program the first series of projects, strengthen partnerships and agreements and set a strategic course for future investment. While programming the over 100 projects valued at 58.7M, a detailed capacity assessment will be performed to ensure the three-year time completion, creating new and employing alternative methods of procurement, developing a rigorous risk management plan, and establishing compliance and stewardship guidelines.\n\nLong-Term Solutions:\n\nThis phase will deliver design and construction of the first series of projects, capture lessons learned, begin future bond tranche investments, and address resiliency through non-infrastructure measures.\n\nEstablish strict project and financial monitoring and reporting processes while working with the City Commission appointed bond civilian oversight board.\n\nRefine the project selection model for subsequent tranches using lessons learned, study results, professional staff analysis, partner participation and community engagement.\n\nAssess and update the City’s zoning, planning and building policies and standards to institute rules that will maximize the resiliency benefits from new development."
