        "text": "The Province of Newfoundland (and Labrador)\n\nIn 1946 an election was held for a National Convention to decide the future of Newfoundland. After much debate, a referendum in July 1948 decided by a vote of 52 to 48 percent for confederation with Canada. Newfoundland joined Canada on April 1, 1949. Politics would be dominated by the Liberal Party under Joseph R. Smallwood until 1972. In 1972 the Smallwood government was finally replaced by the Tory administration of Frank Moores. In 1979 Brian Peckford became Premier. During this time Newfoundland was involved in a serious battle with the federal government for control of offshore oil resources. In the end, the dispute was decided by compromise. In 1989, Clyde Wells and the Liberal Party came to power.\n\nDuring the 1990s Newfoundland faced a severe environmental and economic crisis. The cod fisheries that had provided Newfoundlanders with a livelihood for over 200 years had become depleted. The federal government helped with a billion-dollar package to rescue Newfoundland. In 1996 former federal politican Brian Tobin came to power. His main goal was to get a good deal out of the recently discovered nickel deposits in Labrador. He resigned and went back to federal politics in 2000. The Liberal Party then found itself in a difficult situation. Internal battling and dispute left the new premier, Roger Grimes, in a weakened position.\n\nNewfoundland has been recently involved in a dispute with Nova Scotia over the offshore boundary.\n\nIn 2003, the federal government declared a complete moratorium on the cod fishery, owing to severely imperilled stocks of the fish. This caused tempers to flare in all of Atlantic Canada, and in Newfoundland and Labrador, Premier Grimes called for a review of the Act of Union by which the province had become a part of Canada.\n\nOn July 2, 2003, the results of the Royal Commission on Renewing and Strengthening Our Place in Canada were released. [1] It noted the following stressors in the relationship between the province and Canada:\n\nThe huge impact of the destruction of the cod stocks.\n\nHydroelectricity resources in Labrador have primarily benefitted Quebec.\n\nChronically high unemployment.\n\nLowest per-capita income in Canada.\n\nThe highest tax rates.\n\nThe worst out-migration.\n\nThe report called for: The text of the report may be found"
