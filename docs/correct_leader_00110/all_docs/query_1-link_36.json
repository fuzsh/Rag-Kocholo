        "text": "The Newfoundland Railway and the company money of R. G. Reid\n\nBy 1885, Canada was linked by rail from Halifax to the coast of British Columbia. Meanwhile, Newfoundland was still struggling to tie its coasts together.\n\nThe years that railway builder R. G. Reid spent finishing the Newfoundland Railway were among the most economically disastrous in the province’s history. The railway bankrupted the government and nearly ruined Reid. During the worst of Newfoundland’s 1894 financial crisis, Reid had to find a way to pay his workers. So, he resorted to printing his own money, which his workers could spend at the construction site or redeem for currency at the company’s head office.\n\nThe making of King Reid\n\nR. G. Reid was 48 years old when he came to Newfoundland in 1890. He immediately entered into an agreement with the Newfoundland government to complete a stalled project to build a railway running from St. John’s to Port aux Basques. Against his engineers’ advice, Reid chose to run the railway through the middle of the island—covering about 900 kilometres of very rough terrain. He was taking a big gamble. But contracts were signed, and Reid was determined to meet his commitment. He hired 1,800 workers who did all the work by hand. Labourers worked 60 hours a week for $6. They were paid only for the work they completed, and their food, shelter and medical expenses were not covered.\n\nIn May 1893, Reid took over rail operations for the entire province, and the Newfoundland Northern and Western Railway was born. Reid controlled almost 3 million acres of land, becoming the biggest landowner in Newfoundland. And he was more than just a contractor to the government—he was the power behind the government. Increasingly, the Newfoundland government was turning to Reid for financial advice and emergency loans. It was only Reid’s personal presence that staved off certain financial disaster after Newfoundland’s 1894 bank crash when two of its three banks closed in one day.\n\nOf economic crises, failed banks and missed confederations\n\nAn economic depression that struck North America in 1892 hit Newfoundland particularly hard. By 1894 credit was hard to find, banks failed, and thousands of citizens lost their savings. Large firms went bankrupt, riots broke out, stores were looted, and the military was called in to restore order. Reid was on the verge of ruin, yet insisted on continuing railway construction. Suffering huge losses, and with no credit or cash resources, Reid issued wage notes to pay his employees. The notes came in denominations of $1, $1.50, $2 and $5. They could be used to buy goods from makeshift storage tents at the construction site. They could also be redeemed for currency at the company’s office on Water Street in St. John’s.\n\nThe bank crash of 1894 financially devastated the province. Reid travelled to Montréal with then prime minister of Newfoundland, Robert Bond, to find support from financiers and avoid default on the province’s debt payments. But Reid’s motives were not entirely selfless; he held $4 million in government bonds and they were fast becoming worthless. Reid had to keep the Newfoundland government solvent so that it could pay the debt owed to him. He managed to convince the Bank of Montreal to open a branch on the island at a time when there was no negotiable currency in circulation.\n\nIn 1895, another Newfoundland delegation, including Reid, went to Ottawa, this time to discuss terms of joining Confederation. But the government of Canada refused to accept Newfoundland’s debt, which was mainly the cost of the railway. The irony is that it had offered to finance the railway 10 years earlier, but Newfoundland had refused."
