        "text": "WRONGS OF NEWFOUNDLAND.\n\nF. A. M'Kenzio writes in the \"Daily\n\nMail\" of 19th April :\n\nIn the triumphant and congratul\n\n.atory assemblage of the Laders of\n\nthe Empire there is one unhappy\n\nfigure, Sir Robert Bond, representa\n\ntive of our oldest Colony. Sir\n\nRobert has arrived late for the open\n\ning of the Conference. An imagina\n\ntive eye might see in this delay a\n\nmark of the displeasure of his people\n\nwith the Home Go oernment. For his\n\nScorner of the Empire believes that it\n\nhas been openly humiliated,- its cuusa\n\nbetrayed, and its interests sacrificed\n\nby I owning street.\n\nNew;oundland- has long suffered\n\nfrom the misfortune of being over\n\nshadowed by the wealth and' s~len\n\ndo.s of its neighbor, the great Do\n\nmin:on. Proud of its place as the\n\nfirst of our self-governing Colonies, it\n\nrefused to merge itself in the great\n\nS)ritish-American federation. Lacking\n\nmen and money, it for some time re\n\nmained in a little -ackwater of its\n\n.own. With a population of less than\n\na quarter of a million, mostly fisher\n\nmen, and with no city containing\n\nthirty thousand people, it would have\n\nsunk out of sight save for its post\n\nt.ion as a point for international dis\n\nputes between this country and\n\nFranco and America. 'Then Sir\n\nRobert Bond made his way to the\n\nfront as a Colonial statesman, and\n\na new area- came for the island.\n\nClear purposed, bold, and somewhat\n\naggressive, he entereod on an active\n\nC ampaign for teio advancement of\n\nNewfoundland, which has borne de\n\nfn:te fruit,\n\n'The Premier is sprung from an old\n\nDevonshire family of merchants. He\n\nstudied at the Bar, but foun:l poli\n\ntics more attractive, and became a\n\nmember of the Newfoundland Assem\n\nbly when twenty-seven. Biefore he\n\nwas thirty. years old he was chosen\n\nas Speaker. Then he stepped for\n\nward as advocate of the international\n\nrights of his Colony. He was sent\n\nto London, to Canada, and to Wash\n\nin'ton to represent his people. IIe\n\nproved a: very successful advocate,\n\nand tw6 agreements between Enpgland\n\nand America bear his name, the\n\nBlond - IBlaine and the Ilond-Hay\n\ntreaties.\n\nA iDIP INTO THE FUTU'RE.\n\nHe. had visions of the coming of a\n\nnew era for Newfoundland. He saw\n\nit no longer isolated, with its fcrests\n\nuntouched, its minerals unworked,\n\nand .its people in constant poverty,\n\nbut at the main highway between\n\nEngland-and America and a centre of\n\nindustry. Wherever he went he pro\n\nclaimed . the natural riches of the\n\ncountry and the glories of the New\n\nfoundland climate, kept mild from\n\nCanadian severities by the warmth of\n\nthe Gulf Stream. Ile pictured St.\n\nJohn's as the terminal port for an\n\nad?equate Imperial Translantic mail\n\nservice, and he helped to make this\n\nvision in part a reality. Ho inaugu\n\nrated a policy of progress. 'l he\n\nstrong man of the Colony, he L tcaam\n\nPremier in 1900, when forty-thro.,,\n\nand he has been Premier over since.\n\nC(n? of the first matters he hal to\n\ndeal with was the ancient quarrel\n\nw.ith France over the fishing righ:s\n\nof the two countries. This troeable\n\ndates back.: from immediately after\n\nthe Treaty of Utrecht in 1713, . an.l\n\nfor nearly two centuries it had been\n\ntlh cause of (to use the words of a\n\nlater treaty) t' daily disl. utes.\" The\n\nestablishment of better relations \"be\n\ntween the two countries gave oppor\n\ntunity for adjusting the imatter, and\n\nafter negotiations, in which Sir\n\nRobert took his part, the contention\n\nwas en led once and for all.\n\nBut another and a much more seri\n\nous controversy was in the air.\n\nAtilbri, a has certain fishing rights on\n\nthe west shore of Newfoundland,\n\nguarant cod to her under the Treaty\n\nof 1818, and the Captains Courage\n\nous of Massachusetts find their great\n\nfishing waters in the se?s around 1\n\nNewfoundland. It is almost essential\n\nfor the success of the American fish.rs\n\nthat they should secure liberal sup\n\nplies of Iait fromt our Colony. The\n\npeople of Newfoundland were willing\n\nto treat thJ Americans well, but they\n\nwanted some reciprocity. -The Ameri\n\ncan Government' imposed a heavy\n\nduty u. on fish brought to Anier;can\n\nports by Newfoundland boats. The\n\nColony asked that this duty should\n\nbe removed.\n\nKILLED IN TIlHE SENATE.\n\nIn 1902 it seemed that terms of\n\npeace were 'to be arrived at. Sir\n\nRobert Bond went to Wash'n-\"4 n and\n\narrcnged the whole matter with Mr\n\nBay, the American Foroign Secre\n\ntary. An -agremlent was drawn up\n\nand signed by both sides. But\n\nAmterican treaties with foreign\n\nPowers must be approved by the\n\nSenate. All the vested fishing rights\n\nin Maine and Massachusetts set to\n\nuo:-k. In 1904, wh2n the agreement\n\nfinally got through, it was so cut\n\nabout and so hedged with limitations\n\nth't it was worthless.\n\nSir Robert Borld and his Govern\n\nmont hereupon determined to defend\n\ntheir own. If the Americans would\n\nnot have 'poace-wol, let it be war.\n\nIn;the\"fo'lowing year, the t(oloniul\n\nAssembly, taking as excuse - th\n\nserious loss occasioned to fishermen\n\nof this Colony last season hy the\n\ndiimcultyo' f obtaiinng a full sutupply\n\nof bait flshes,\" .enacted measures to\n\nstop the American fishermen from ob\n\ntaining their bait. Newfound'and\n\nfishermen were forbidden to work on\n\nrforeigen boats. Other points of dis\n\npute became suddenly acute. The\n\nAmerican fishermen-operating in New\n\nfoundland waters fished on Sundays,\n\nthoughl the natives were f.,rbidden to\n\ndo so; and the Am.nricans defied\n\nlocal regulations for the protection\n\nof fishling' wates, particularly in\n\nusing purso-reines, which swept the\n\nwaters with a hun lro.l times the\n\ncapacity of ordinary mets.\n\nThe action: of Newfoundilnnd ruined\n\nthe season for the herring f;mhery. oil\n\nthe west coast. In the trast, it had\n\nbeen th -.custom' for the American\n\nboats to come and buy the.herrlrg'\n\nfrom the local fishermen, taking them\n\nto America as their own, and secur\n\ning admission : withut paynrment- of\n\nduty..:' Under: this system the New\n\nfoundland men did the work, and the\n\nAmerican 'boats secured most of the\n\n;ro'lt.\n\nDOWNING STREET INTERFERENCE\n\nThe Colony tried to make such an\n\narrargement impossible. But the\n\nAmericans came in with a strong\n\nhand 'and -defied the Colonltl law.\n\nTheoy refused to pay light dues or to\n\nreport at the'Cestolrs House, nl I\n\nthey practically set these Newfound"
