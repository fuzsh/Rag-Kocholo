He was a member of the House of Assembly almost continuously from 1882 until his retirement in 1914. As colonial secretary, he was renowned for his expertise in international relations. He served as the last colonial premier from 1900 to 1907 and the first prime minister of the Dominion of Newfoundland from 1907 to 1909.\n\nRobert Bond was born on February 25, 1857 at St. John's, Newfoundland. He was the sixth of seven children born to John Bond and his wife, Elizabeth Parsons. [1]\n\nRobert Bond was educated in England at Taunton (Queen's) College and Edinburgh University.[2] He studied for the law, but never practiced. Instead, he became involved in politics at a relatively early age. He was elected to the House of Assembly in 1882,[3] and, at only 27 years of age, he was elected Speaker of that body.[4]\n\nIn 1900, Bond became Prime Minister of Newfoundland. He gained an international reputation due to his involvment in fishing rights conflicts, which caused dissent in Newfoundland, and a stern statement from Sir Winston Churchill. [5] [6]\n\nIn 1901, Robert Bond, Premier and Colonial Secretary, was enumerated in England, at the Hotel Metropole at St. Martin in the Fields, MIddlesex. All persons who \"slept or abode in this institution on the night of Sunday, March 31st, 1901\" were listed. Sir Robert was 45 years old and single.[7][8]\n\nIn 1921, sixty-five-year-old Sir Robert Bond, a life-long bachelor, was living at Whitbourne, Trinity, Newfoundland, Canada. He gave his birth date as February of 1856, and his birth place as St. John's. His occupation was \"gentleman\". He had five servants.[9]\n\nIn the 1880s, Sir Robert had purchased land in Whitbourne and built a mansion that he called The Grange. It was from the library in this home that, according to the Whitbourne Museum, the first trans-Atlantic message was sent by radio.[10] It was also where Sir Robert Bond died, of heart-related issues, at the age of 70 on March 16, 1927.[11] He was buried at St. John The Baptist Anglican Church Cemetery.[12][13]\n\nAfter his death, Bond's niece and nephew, the former Roberta Bond, now Mrs. E. W. NIchols, and Fraser Bond, placed a stained glass memorial to their uncle in a church in Whitbourne.[14]\n\nSources\n\n↑ Melvin Baker and Peter Neary, “BOND, Sir ROBERT,” in Dictionary of Canadian Biography, vol. 15, University of Toronto/Université Laval, 2003–, accessed January 27, 2024, http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/bond_robert_15E.html.\n\n↑ Evening Standard 17 Mar 1927, Thu ·Page 1, London, England\n\n↑ The Vancouver Sun 17 Mar 1927, Thu ·Page 18, Vancouver, British Columbia\n\n↑ Coventry Evening Telegraph 18 Mar 1927, Fri ·Page 4, Coventry, West Midlands, England\n\n↑ Taunton Courier, Bristol and Exeter Journal and Western Advertiser Taunton, Somerset, England · Wednesday, March 30, 1927\n\n↑ Somerset Guardian and Radstock Observer 18 May 1907, Sat ·Page 3, Radstock, Avon, England\n\n↑ 1901 Census: \"England and Wales Census, 1901\"\n\nciting St Martin In The Fields subdistrict, PRO RG 13, The National Archives, Kew, Surrey\n\nFamilySearch Record: X9D4-YL4 (Transcription accessed 27 January 2024)\n\nFindMyPast Image\n\nRobert Bond (45), single, Premier & Colonial Secretary, in St Martin in the Fields in Strand registration district in Middlesex, England.
