        "text": "A premier is the chief minister of a provincial government. Because of the shared framework of cabinet government, the office of provincial premier is similar to that held by Canada's prime minister. The policy direction and management of the provincial governments is visibly dominated by their premiers. A premier is in every sense the \"first\" minister.\n\nThe first list of leaders below is those of the Prime Ministers of the Dominion of Newfoundland. From 1934 until Newfoundland joined Confederation in 1949, there was no elected government. As a colony of the United Kingdom, the government was controlled by the House of Commons in London. When Newfoundland became a province of Canada in 1949, the position of premier was instituted."
