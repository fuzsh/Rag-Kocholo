        "text": "In much of the rest of the country, Monday is a holiday.\n\nIn some places it's known as Family Day, P.E.I. calls it Islander Day, and Nova Scotia has Heritage Day, but in Newfoundland and Labrador, it's simply known as a regular work day.\n\nThe rest of the country has acknowledged that it's a long slog to go from New Year's Day to Good Friday without a break, and thus lightened the burden with a February holiday to break up a rough time of the year.\n\nRead more articles by Peter Cowan\n\nThere's a light at the end of the dark tunnel, and it's a long weekend.\n\nIn Newfoundland and Labrador, the idea seems to have had zero traction with politicians. We just went through an election campaign and none of the three parties promised a February holiday.\n\nWhy not? It seems like a guaranteed vote-getter. After all, it's one of the reasons more and more provinces have added it to the calendar.\n\nNot everyone thinks so. The Canadian Federation of Independent Business warned several years ago that adding a holiday would hurt the provincial economy to the tune of $90 million.\n\nNo 'concerted representation' for a holiday\n\nOfficially, the line from government is that there isn't a holiday in February because you didn't ask for one.\n\n\"There has not been any concerted representation to add a paid holiday in February by provincial stakeholders,\" Hugh Donnan, a director of strategic communications in Executive Council, told me in an email.\n\nBut what Liberal staff —and the Progressive Conservatives who pre-dated them — will say quietly is is that another holiday would hurt the government's already strained bottom line.\n\nGovernment already gives most of its workers 14 paid holidays a year, a lot more than the six paid holidays that businesses are legally required to provide.\n\nDon't forget your Georgemas cards!\n\nI'm betting very few of you can list them all off. A lot of them are holidays you may have just heard in passing. Take St. George's Day, a day to mark the patron saint of England (don't worry, it's April 23, you still have plenty of time to get your Georgemas cards in the mail).\n\nNot even workers in England are given that day off. Newfoundland and Labrador did it to balance out the two Irish (and sectarian) holidays of St. Patrick's Day and Orangemen's Day.\n\nNone of these are holidays that are apparently important enough to give to all workers. Businesses don't have to close. The actual holiday is rarely even the day workers actually take off.\n\nFor instance, instead of shutting down on April 23, government moves the day to the closest Monday (this year, April 25 is the holiday) in order to give workers a long weekend.\n\nMoving the holiday can confuse people about what day you're actually supposed to wear a red rose in your lapel or put up your garland of St. George's crosses. (Be honest: you had no idea how to properly celebrate the day.)\n\nSwap out a holiday, anyone?\n\nSo if you're ticked off that your friends and family elsewhere in the country are off work, it's time to tell the government.\n\nYou can suggest we swap out a holiday few people actually get, and even fewer understand, with a break that all of us can celebrate.\n\nBesides, nothing brings a family together quite like spending the day digging out from yet another storm.\n\nIf we need a name more imaginative than Family Day, may I suggest Sir Robert Bond Day, in honour of the prime minister who was first to govern the Dominion of Newfoundland, and who was born on Feb. 25, 1857."
