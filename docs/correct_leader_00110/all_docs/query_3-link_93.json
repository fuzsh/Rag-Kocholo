        "text": "Catawba County Board of Commissioners\n\nThe five-member Board of Commissioners represents the residents of Catawba County. Commissioners are elected on an at-large basis to staggered four year terms in even-numbered years.\n\nDuties of a County Commissioner\n\nThe Board of Commissioners has many duties and authorities, including the following:\n\nDetermining the County’s strategic vision\n\nAdopting a balanced County budget by June 30 annually\n\nEstablishing the County’s property tax rate\n\nSetting County policy by adopting resolutions and local ordinances*\n\nAppointing the County Manager as chief administrator\n\nAppointing the County Clerk, County Attorney and Tax Administrator\n\nAppointing individuals to serve on various advisory boards and commissions\n\nProviding funding for the construction and maintenance of public school facilities\n\nDetermining the level of local current expense funding for public schools on an annual basis\n\nProviding for the safety and well-being of all residents\n\nDetermining land use and zoning outside municipal boundaries\n\nConducting long-range planning for County needs (Capital Investment Plan)\n\nCalling for bond referenda\n\nEntering into contracts on behalf of the County\n\nServing as liaisons to local, state and federal boards and commissions\n\n*Because the Sheriff and Register of Deeds are also elected officials, they have independent authority to adopt policies for their departments.\n\nHuman Services: In NC, counties administer social services and public health directly within county departments. These services are state supervised and county administered.\n\nSchools: Counties in NC are statutorily required to build and maintain school facilities, which are owned by independently elected school boards. Counties also contribute a percentage of their budgets to fund school classroom expenses (also known as local current expense or per pupil funding).\n\nOther Services: In NC, counties have increasingly taken on other services for the health and well-being of residents, especially in unincorporated areas. This includes services such as the provision of water and sewer, building inspections, and planning and zoning.\n\nRoads: The State of North Carolina is responsible for building, repairing and maintaining secondary roads. County government is not responsible for the building, repair or maintenance of roads.\n\nAdditional Information:\n\nLocal Government in North Carolina\n\nWhat Do North Carolina Cities and Counties Do?"
