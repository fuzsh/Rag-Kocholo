In 1941, Canada established a diplomatic mission to Newfoundland to co-ordinate the war effort. The mission in St. John’s was closed when Newfoundland joined Canada in 1949.

The Canadian High Commissioners to Newfoundland were:

The Hon. Charles Jost Burchell PC (1st time), 1941-44.

James Scott Macdonald, 1944-48.

Paul Augustus Bridle, 1948.

The Hon. Charles Jost Burchell PC (2nd time), 1948-49.

Newfoundland became a Dominion, like Canada, on September 26th, 1907. The Dominion sent troops to the Great War, sent a delegation to the Paris Peace Conference of 1919, had a High Commissioner to the UK, and was as self-governing as any other Dominion.

Unfortunately, the Great Depression hit the Newfoundland economy very hard, and, combined with a huge war debt, a huge railway debt, and a highly divided and ineffectual political process resulting in most of the country being disillusioned with the effectiveness of democracy, the pressure forced it to ask the UK for help, which was provided on the condition of direct government control by Britain. The Newfoundland legislature voted itself out of existence on February 16th, 1934, after which the country was controlled by a commission serving under the Governor; the only democratic institution left on the island being the city council of St. John’s.

Efforts to restore independence were superseded, first by World War II, then by negotiations to join Canada. Of the ten men to serve as the Prime Minister of Newfoundland, only one survived to see it join Confederation at one minute before midnight on March 31, 1949.

The Rt. Hon. Sir Robert Bond KCMG PC (1857-1927), Liberal Party; 26 Sep. 1907 – 2 March 1909.

My 100th post! Enjoy!

In 1586 Sir Humphrey Gilbert landed in St. John’s harbour and claimed Newfoundland as a colony of England, despite having no permanent English population. Between 1610 and 1660 various small settlements were attempted, at Cuper’s Cove, Bristol’s Hope, Renews, South Falkland, Ferryland, and Avalon. Each was controlled by a proprietary governor, who both owned the land and represented the government. The French founded a colony at Plaisance (Placentia) in 1665, and was more or less the only permanent settlement in Newfoundland until it was abandoned when France lost its claim to Newfoundland under the Treaty of Utrecht of 1713.

The first permanent governance of Newfoundland was the Commodore-Governor, an official of the Royal Navy who patrolled the fishing banks and the summertime fish-processing stations of Newfoundland beginning in 1729. Permanent settlement didn’t get going until the turn of the 19th century, with the Commodore-Governor replaced by a permanent civil governor in 1825, and in 1855 Newfoundland became a Crown Colony with a colonial governor.

In 1907, Newfoundland became a Dominion and the governor became the Dominion Governor, and also Commission Governor when the elected government of Newfoundland was suspended and direct government by Britain imposed in 1934, after the calamitous failure of Newfoundland’s entire financial system. Then, when Newfoundland joined Canada in 1949, the office became the Lieutenant-Governor of Newfoundland. When the province changed its name to Newfoundland and Labrador in 1999, the Lieutenant-Governor’s title changed, too.
