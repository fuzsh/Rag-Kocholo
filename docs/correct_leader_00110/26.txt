Biography

Edward P. Morris was a Newfoundland teacher, lawyer, and political figure.

Born in 1859 in St. John's, he was the fourth of the six children of Irish immigrants Edward Morris, a cooper, and his wife Catherine Fitzgerald. In 1901 he married widow Isabel le Gallais Fox; they had a son.

After spending four years teaching at a school founded by his brother, Father Michael Morris, he began his legal career. In 1885 he and another brother, Francis, opened their own law firm. His political career began at about the same time. He was a talented local politician, winning the election in the St. John's West district ten times. In 1902 he became minister of justice and was knighted in 1904. He served as prime minister of the Dominion of Newfoundland from 1909 to 1917. After his resignation, he was elevated to the House of Lords as Baron Morris of St John’s in the Dominion of Newfoundland, and of the City of Waterford. He relocated to England at that time.

He died in 1935 in London, England, and was buried at St. Mary's Roman Catholic Cemetery, Kensal Green, London.
