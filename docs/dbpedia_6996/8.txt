In 1946, Dr. Francisco T. Dalupan, Sr. in response to the Filipino Youthâ€™s clamor for college education after the end of World War II established the first piece of his grand vision of a university - the Philippine College of Commerce and Business Administration. This was followed by four colleges in 1948: Liberal Arts, Education, Dentistry and Graduate School. With the addition of the College of Law in 1950, the group of colleges became a university - the University of the East (UE), Manila. The UE campus in Caloocan opened in 1954.The university would not be complete without a college of medicine. This was facilitated by the purchase of the Instituto de Mujeres along Aurora Boulevard, Quezon City. It consisted of 10,000 square meters of ground and a four-storey concrete building which was remodelled to expand and meet the requirements of a medical college. Thus, the college of medicine was established in 1956 and it became the nucleus of the University of the East Ramon Magsaysay Memorial Medical Center, Inc.(UERMMMCI).
