Recognized as a Center of Excellence in Research by the Department of Science and Technology and has Level II Accreditation by PAASCU, Innovative Curriculum. The first and only private Medical School with a PAASCU Accredited Program, Level II.\n\nHistory\n\nIn 1956, the University of the East College of Medicine, which will later be known as the University of the East Ramon Magsaysay Memorial Medical Center was established. As a non-stock, non-profit foundation named in honor of the late President Ramon Magsaysay, UERMMC was the first philanthropic institution in the country. The Board of Trustees of the University has set its purpose: “complete dedication to the medical education, research and alleviation of human sufferings”. President Carlos P. Garcia described the founding of UERMMMC as a “great adventure, marking the advent in the Philippines of educational philanthropy”.\n\nThe College of Medicine offered more than the usual and conventional medical curriculum, giving its students a more solid foundation in the study of medicine. Creativity has always been a hallmark of the Center. It has enriched medical education through its integrated approach to the teaching of psychiatry and neuroscience; effective teaching methods to produce a more appropriate physician for the country, some of which were adopted by other medical schools; established its first Community Health Project in Limay, Bataan; introduced the Correlated Lecture Series; spearheaded the teaching of problem-oriented medical records started the teaching of Family Planning; instituted a Clinical Clerkship program in the USA; established a grant-in-aid scholarship program; integrated the teaching of Primary Health Care in the curriculum; created the course on Human Life Cycle; introduced the Problem Bases Learning strategy; developed and exported the teaching of research methods to other medical schools.\n\nThe College of Medicine periodically reviews and upgrades its curriculum by instituting general changes such as the implementation of the core curriculum, granting of the M.D. degree after the Fourth year; upgrading of selected subjects; teaching by objectives; role-based curriculum and competencies; and integration of Primary health Care in the curriculum.\n\nSpecific changes have also been installed in its search for relevance to the national and local health needs, as well as in keeping with international trends. It put more emphasis on science and art in the teaching of all courses, in order to produce graduates who shall internalize science and art and use them as the bases of medical practice. The curricular structure was made more flexible, allowing the student to participate in directing his learning and providing him adequate time for self-study and greater exposure to non-hospital settings of training. It shifted emphasis of the curricular content to topics, which were directly related to the national and local health and medical problem and issues. A uniform teaching method was utilized for all courses, which fostered the development of problem-solving skills in health and medicine. Through its continued excellence in the field of medical education, the College of Medicine was granted level II accreditation by the PAASCU for a three-year period.\n\nThrough its linkages with training hospitals in the United States of America, qualified Filipino-Americans are offered the opportunity to undertake part of their clinical clerkship training in these hospitals.\n\nAffiliated Hospitals\n\n* St. John’s Episcopal Hospital, South Shore, Far Rockaway, New York, USA\n\n* Affiliated Institute of Medical Education, Chicago, Illinois, USA\n\n* Cathay General Hospital, Taipei City, Taiwan, Republic of China\n\n* Buddhist Tzu-Chi General Hospital, Hualien, Taiwan, ROC.\n\nee also\n\n*University of the East\n\n*UERMMMC\n\nReferences\n\n*University of the East http://www.ue.edu.ph\n\n*UERMMMC College of Medicine http://www.uerm.edu.ph/?nav=uerm5&link=abt\n\nExternal links"
