        "text": "What’s up, doc? (badumm, tss).\n\nFirst of all: congratulations!!! You are now officially an incoming first year medical student of the University of the East Ramon Magsaysay Memorial Medical Center (UERMMMMMMMMMMMMC)!\n\nYou are one step closer to ‘the dream’. I still remember the day when I found out that I got into UERM. I was on my last month as a Physical Therapy intern in Jose Reyes, and I used my “check ko lang po in-patient ko” so that I can use my phone outside the rehab unit. Beforehand, I joined the pinoy.md thread for the hopeful UERM freshies because they were keen on checking if the results were already posted.\n\nAnd then I saw my name.\n\nAnd this text message.\n\nI had mixed emotions. I was still recovering from a major heartbreak since I was not able to get into my dream school (a.k.a. the school where I came from). I doubted all of my capabilities since then. I hated myself for failing to reach the 90+ mark in NMAT (this might have caused the rejection of my application). But after my interview in UERM, I felt 99% sure I was going to pass. Not being overconfident or anything, it’s just that I gave Miss Universe answers to very simple questions. UERM is my second choice, and I knew I cannot afford another heartbreak anymore. So hi Doc Z thank you for the wonderful questions, and I thank you hehehe.\n\nFast forward: grateful I already had these people to be with on our first day (hello socially awkward people like me).\n\nAnd so a higher level of stress began. June 22, 2015 marked the beginning of a new chapter in our lives- medical school. However, we were still days away from our PT boards which made things more complicated. We had to study for our Med quizzes, exams, lab manuals, case conferences, BGDs, alongside reviewing Peak 1-4, Fortinberry, O’Sullivan, Siegelman etc… IMAGINE THAT.\n\nWe took our boards August 8-9, and results were posted on August 11. Up to this day, I still cannot believe we made it. We even had exams the week before boards. I remember crying so much the day before, and pleaded for help and mercy from Saint Jude, Saint Claire and Padre Pio. SOBRANG SALAMAT PO.\n\nNow it begins.\n\nFRESHIE TIP # 1. It is okay to repeat clothes. No big deal.\n\nAs far as I remember, we were allowed to wear casual clothes for one whole month. This is so we would have ample time to have our uniforms made. I had mine made outside of school so I can choose my type of cloth and custom fit. The weather now is really unpredictable, so opt for basic shirts, jeans and closed shoes. Unless you have this insane love for fashion. And have clothes that can last for a month. And yes, do carry a jacket with you, it can get cold inside our lecture rooms.\n\nPS. Do not be surprised when some of your classmates disappear a few days or weeks after- they probably backed out from UERM because they got recalled in *the school of their dreams heehee*.\n\nFRESHIE TIP # 2. And when you are already required to be in your whites, pat yourself in the back because you are living the dream. And take lots of photos!\n\nI have spent 5 years wearing white uniform, so I have already mastered how to sit, how to avoid food stains, how to detect menstrual stains (“uy friend, Japan?” = Japanese flag = red circle on a white flag = period stain on our white skirt, gets?), how to insult your friend by the color of her undergarments, etc, etc, etc…\n\nFRESHIE TIP # 3. Be friends with your seatmates. You will be seated alphabetically, and most likely, they will be your ‘4ever grpm8s’.\n\nI AM LUCKY TO HAVE GROUPMATES THAT GET MY HUMOR. We’re the craziest bunch. Our favorite hobby? Asking each other to open our AIRDROP just so we can send each other silly photos.\n\nFRESHIE TIP # 4. And these groupmates will be your teammates. As for my group, they became family. You will go through lots of groupwork together- DPC videos, Biochem group discussions, Integrated Case Studies, Anatomy lab dissection, and more.\n\nDO NOT COMPETE WITH EACH OTHER. I repeat. Do. Not. Compete. With. Each. Other. Help pull each other’s grades up. After all, these groupworks are mostly for additional points, so do well and contribute! It’s already post-grad, for goodness sake. Now is the time to stop depending on responsible groupmates (if you grew up with that habit, please).\n\nFRESHIE TIP # 5. Integrated Case Study: you get a case, you hypothesize, you research and you conclude.\n\nYOU WILL ALL BE GRADED INDIVIDUALLY, depending on how much you contribute to the session. You will be in a room with your group and assigned proctor (may or may not be part of the faculty). My advice is that do not be afraid to speak up. Let go of your stage fright. No contribution, no grade. Most proctors insist that the discussions be informal. You can speak in Filipino if the proctor allows. Parang group study lang sa coffeeshop pero may nakabantay na doctor to guide you, ganern.\n\nFRESHIE TIP # 6. Do not take your laboratory manuals for granted.\n\nPlease allot time for them. SAYANG ANG POINTS. All of them are graded. Yes, they occupy only a small percentage of your grade. SO, if you miss a page, or an answer to a number, you can already acquire a huge deduction. From 10%, to 8%, real quick. You pass them only by the end of each shifting, which means you have plenty of time to accomplish them. (Anatomy, Physiology, DPC and Epidemiology).\n\nFRESHIE TIP # 7. FOOD. Now where do you eat on your first day? You’ll probably opt for food in the cafeteria ‘just to be sure’.\n\nThere’s the hospital canteen, and another near the gym. They sell meals for an average of 80 pesos. “Grabe, sa school ko dati, 40-50 pesos sobrang busog ko na”. There, there. It’s alright. Pwede mag baon ng pagkain sa school para tipid. But if you can’t, then go to WHITE HOUSE. Everyone’s favorite place for home-cooked meals, just at the back of the school. They sell the best lemonade. Promise.\n\nExit the front gate, turn left, walk past the maritime school, and you’ll find YUTAKA IZAKAYA (a pricey Japanese resto), a legit Chinese resto (we call it Chinese and we eat there often because free aircon and wifi!!!), FOOD HUB (just beside Chinese). Also, you can take the overpass to the hospital side and to the left you’ll see several carinderias (we usually eat at the airconditioned place hehehe kasi sobrang init pag tanghali). When you’re really really in a rush to eat, there’s MINISTOP just beside the front gate (you know, best fried chicken ala Papa John). If you have enough time, go to Mezza for the legit restaurants (Pancake House, Yellow Cab, Mann Hann, Rufo’s, Fast Foo, Ersao, etc.) If you have a really long break, walk to SM Sta. Mesa. And if you have a really really really long break, take the overpass to the hospital side, and ride the jeepney going to Robinsons Magnolia.\n\nFor snacks: 1) buy from Manong Taho and Ate Kakanin staying at the front gate every morning, 2) Ministop kariman, 3) always always visit the small stall of Ate Turon/Bananacue/Mani in front of Ministop, 4) Belgian Waffles beside Ministop, 5) George’s siomai at the back gate, and 6) pancit canton and other street food you can possible think of beside White House.\n\nFRESHIE TIP # 8. Create your own study habit (the most effective).\n\nNow, this may take time. I think this depends on how you did it in college. If you can finish studying before 12 midnight, then please teach me your ways. Lol. Personally, I already do some advanced reading of my lessons and still find myself staying up until 2 or 3 in the morning to review. I would rather stay up late with my Kopiko 78 (uy naks nag rhyme) than wake up early to review. I ALWAYS FEAR THAT MY INNER SLEEPY GRUMPY MONSTER WOULD JUST KEEP ON SWIPING THE SNOOZE BUTTON OVER AND OVER UNTIL IT’S ALREADY TIME FOR ME TO GO TO SCHOOL. Worse, not wake up to the alarm at all and completely miss the exams.\n\nWhat I do is I set a time table, with a list of all topics I want to study for that night. I use 4 colors of highlighters, and 2 colors of markers. Some use only 2 colors. I like things bright and cheerful and colorful. Studying is hard. It’s one way I can make myself feel better when I have to read aaaaaaaaalllllllllllllllll of the transes in one night.\n\nFRESHIE TIP # 9. Find people you can study with. At the same time, be quiet with.\n\nYou can always study on your own, or be with friends (to wake you up from your powernap hehe). We often study in one place, but are always seated apart. We can focus individually, yet we can still ask questions and laugh at each other’s stressed out faces during our breaks. We usually stay at the school’s library, coffeeshops, and if we’re lucky, we get to own a discussion room for a day.\n\nAlmost every night, my dormmates and I stay at the lobby. So if ever you see us in Anglo, do not hesitate to say hi!!! We don’t bite and we are probably as stressed as you are. Let’s all study together because the more, the many-er!!! Also, we’d like to say sorry in advance in case you hear our boisterous laughters in the middle of the night.\n\nFRESHIE TIP # 10. We have so much free time, so do take every subject seriously.\n\nMaybe you have heard of this, but first year medicine in UERM is kind of chill compared to the other schools. We do not have quizzes everyday, every week, every minute of our lives. So majority of our grades come from the long exams (three every semester and one finals). Our schedule? Just on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays. We have free Tuesdays and Thursdays every exam week. AND THAT’S JUST FOR FIRST YEARS SO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF IT. BASICALLY, THERE’S NO EXCUSE. Anatomy, Physiology and ahem, Biochemistry (the most dreaded subject of the entire freshie medical planet of death) take up the biggest units. HOWEVER, the ‘minors’, the other subjects usually taken for granted by students, can really pull your grades up so do try to ace them. LASTLY, AIM FOR EXEMPTIONS.\n\nWhat about notes? What are TRANSES?\n\nTranses (short for transcriptions) are handouts made by the class. We combine the lecturer’s notes with information from the book, and that’s what we use to study. It’s like an unofficial handout. It saves time and effort in studying especially if you do not want to read the other references anymore. However, majority of the transes are not checked by the lecturers. It’s still up to you to trust the people who made the trans hehehe. The class decides on how the trans system will work. AND YES, YOU MAY NEED TO BUY A PRINTER ALREADY. AND BOND PAPER RIMS. LOTS AND LOTS OF RIMS.\n\nDo I have to buy all of the books?\n\nNO. As what I have said, there are transes already. But do keep ebook copies with you, just in case you need to verify information. What I do is I just print some chapters I want to read. Although I recommend buying Netter’s Atlas for Anatomy laboratory.\n\nFRESHIE TIP # 11. Find your inspiration and motivation. Seek God’s help.\n\nBelow are my weapons. One glance at them and I find myself moving forward. THEY REMIND ME OF MY PURPOSE AND PASSION.\n\nYou were not brought here by chance. YOU ARE HERE FOR A REASON. I pray you find the answers you are looking for, and the inner passion that you have been wanting to feel.\n\nThis school year, I met new friends and new professors. We found out that one of our doctor professors, Doc JC, has this passion for sharing God’s word to people. From a small group, we then became #TeamB-live (believers from section B hehe). We have bible study sessions every week. I am proud to say that we all have different religions and yet when we recognize and praise the Lord, our differences do not come into picture at all. Bittersweet feeling that we would not be seeing Doc JC this year anymore (as he has to stay in another country), but he has definitely made a big impact in our faith. Know that 12 other souls are praying for you and your endeavours, Doc!!!\n\nLastly, FRESHIE TIP # 12. Reward yourself.\n\nWe were taught the concept of DELAYED GRATIFICATION during our PT boards review. So after all of the hardwork and late nights and caffeine overload, I make sure I do something for myself. You should too! Buy that dress you’ve been eyeing for weeks, eat at a pricey resto, do something you’ve never done before. Bonus: things get more exciting when you try out things with friends.\n\nTalk about having free time. Our friend Verch took up Mass Comm, so yep we were able to start our own Youtube show ala-Running Man (that’s somehow still medically related)! IT’S WORTH WATCHING I SWEAR.\n\nSo, yeah. UERM is tad bit like the Big Brother House. We came from different schools, different hometowns (hello Fil-Am friends!), different degrees in college (to my surprise: Mass Com, Engineering, Theology, etc)…\n\nDifferent stories…\n\nBut definitely same dreams.\n\nSo, that’s it. Final tips?\n\nKeep in touch with the most special people in your life (I failed at this aspect badly. I’ll try my best this time.)\n\nAlways pray, no matter how hopeless and painful things are.\n\nTake lots and lots and lots of photos.\n\nEspecially photos of your friends sleeping in class.\n\nI have lots of them…\n\nOur school has FREE WIFI. Social media sites during class? Pwedeng pwede (hehehe).\n\nDon’t forget to greet our security guards and audi technicians.\n\nGirls: don’t get too crazy over UERM’s McDreamy aka Doc Z.\n\nLastly, self-love is important. You see your cum laude classmates doing so well and then you decide to beastmode every night. Even if you are now living the dream, take care of yourself. Drink vitamins. HEALTH IS DEFINITELY WEALTH.\n\n[banner photo from: http://65.media.tumblr.com/5181bf5317e9c1225278036b6abcfe7b/tumblr_n8zjvufSyk1s4v72io1_r1_1280.jpg%5D"
