As a non-stock, non-profit foundation named in honor of the late President Ramon Magsaysay, UERMMC was the first philanthropic institution in the country.\n\nThe College of Medicine established its first Community Health Project in Limay, Bataan; introduced the Correlated Lecture Series, the teaching of problem-oriented medical records started the teaching of Family Planning, instituted a clinical clerkship program in the USA; established a grant-in-aid scholarship program; integrated the teaching of primary health care in the curriculum; created a course on the human life cycle; introduced the 'Problem Bases' learning strategy; developed and exported the teaching of research methods to other medical schools.\n\nThe College of Medicine periodically reviews and upgrades its curriculum by instituting general changes such as the implementation of the core curriculum, granting of the M.D. degree after the Fourth year; upgrading of selected subjects; teaching by objectives; role-based curriculum and competencies; and integration of Primary health Care in the curriculum.\n\nThrough its linkages with training hospitals in the United States of America, qualified Filipino-Americans are offered the opportunity to undertake part of their clinical clerkship training in these hospitals.\n\nAnother UERM College of Medicine graduate was included in the Top Ten examinees of the August 2009 Physician Licensure Examination held last August 2009.[3]"
