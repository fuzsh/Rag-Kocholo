        "text": "Though I was born in Queens, New York, I have lived all over the United States including Michigan, Texas, California, and now Indiana. Wanting to learn more about my culture and heritage, I studied in India and completed my MBBS from Government Medical College Amritsar. Living there and seeing different walks of life helped me grow as not only a physician, but as a person. It was an enlightening experience that strengthened my resolve to pursue medicine.\n\nOn interview day, I was excited to interview with IU Health Ball Memorial Hospital. During my interview, the faculty seemed very passionate and excited to teach. We bonded over common interests and experiences. The residents felt supported and were extremely vocal about their positive experience at the program. With my goal being to find a program which fosters personal and professional growth, I knew IU Health Ball Memorial Hospital was somewhere I wanted to be. I am looking forward to being part of the community.\n\nOutside of medicine I enjoy spending time with my wife, reading comics, sports, working out and watching Netflix. I love reading about cutting edge technology and watching the occasional romcom for fun.\n\nMy name is Ibrahim khan and I am from Orange County, CA. A desire to advance myself academically in an ongoing manner, a love for science, and a passion to serve others led me to pursue medicine and graduate from J.S.S Medical College in India.\n\nWhile in medical school I began to appreciate the integral role played by internal medicine in treating patients both in and out of the hospital, I was also drawn to the exposure of a broad range of pathology we encounter and the ability to pursue various fellowships. This led me to choose internal medicine. While researching residency programs and later interviewing at them, IU Health Ball Memorial Hospital stood out for its strong academic program, distinguished faculty and a supportive environment. Throughout my interview process, the genuineness of everyone in the program was palpable. I am truly grateful to become a part of the IU Health Ball Memorial Hospital family and look forward to calling Muncie my home.\n\nOutside of the hospital, I enjoy spending quality time with family and friends, playing basketball, exploring the outdoors and anything that gets my adrenaline pumping!\n\nHello everyone! My name is Sasmith, and I was born and raised in New York and have lived there most of my life. I decided to go to medical school in India, where I attended Narayana Medical College. From a young age, my goal was always to help people in any way I could, and I carried these values with me throughout my life. This led me to develop an interest in internal medicine as it allows me to form bonds with my patients while also giving me challenges in the form of complex cases. Becoming a doctor has always been a constant in my life, and I am excited to begin my journey.\n\nI am delighted I matched into Indiana University Health Ball Memorial Hospital’s Internal Medicine Residency program, as I believe the program will give me the tools required to be the best doctor that I can possibly be. I mainly looked for three aspects in a program. First, I wanted a rigorous training program that would prepare me to become a strong and compassionate clinician. Second, I was keen on a program that would allow me to see a wide range of cases and a focus on teaching. Lastly, I wished to be in a program where everyone was warm and supportive and would be invested in my growth as a budding physician. The program here at IU Health Ball Memorial Hospital fulfilled all that I desired, and I am very proud to be here. I am looking forward to my three years here and will make the most of my time here in Muncie.\n\nIn my free time, I love cooking, making hot sauces, traveling, investing, adventure sports, and hanging out with friends. Some of my accomplishments include becoming an Eagle Scout with a Double Sliver Palm and creating an NGO during my time in India for the underserved. I love meeting new people and making new friends from all walks of life, and I am always on the lookout for a new adventure.\n\nMy story started when I was in 1st grade! My father, who is a nephrologist, would pick me up from school and take me with him to the hospital. Some moments can define your whole life, and as such, I was in love with the clinical setting.\n\nI am originally from Sudan, a country in north east Africa but I was born and raised in Arar, Saudi Arabia. After high school I moved to Egypt as I was awarded a scholarship to study medicine at Cairo University. After graduation, I practiced medicine in Egypt and rotated for several months in different clinics in the US. Living in all these countries, I relished working with people from diverse backgrounds and thus increased my cultural sensitivity, a necessity when patients attend from all walks of life.\n\nMany experiences later, I was hired by the Mayo Clinic as a postdoctoral research fellow in the internal medicine department. This position has embraced my curious mind and helped me intensify my contribution to the advancement of medicine.\n\nIU Health Ball Memorial Hospital stood out from all my other interviews. The focus on the residents, training and friendliness I experienced during my interview was enough to rank it on the top of my list. I am extremely excited to call Muncie home for the next three years.\n\nApart from medicine, you will find me exploring new places, taking pictures, listening to music, or watching a TV series. I currently have a goal to read a book every month, learn a new skill every year and enjoy life to the fullest.\n\nI was born and raised in Karachi, Pakistan, where after O and A Levels, I went to medical school at Ziauddin University. Coming from a family that puts high value in education, I was always determined to pursue the highest standards of professional excellence. Throughout my medical school, I traveled for elective rotations in different countries including the United States and experienced how medicine is practiced around the globe. For me, Internal Medicine was the plan since day one. I moved to the United States right after graduation and started a new life in northwest Indiana in 2014. Since then, Indiana has been home.\n\nWhile studying for the USMLE, I rotated through multiple settings in internal medicine and its subspecialties. I was lucky to have been mentored by some truly exceptional physicians. I instinctively gravitated towards IU Health Ball Memorial Hospital at the time of ranking. The expertise of the internal medicine program at building academic excellence and clinical acumen in its residents is unparalleled. Everyone at Ball Memorial Hospital, from the faculty to the coordinator to the senior residents, is invested in your professional growth and treats you like family. There has been considerable camaraderie among my own class since the day we found out we matched at Ball Memorial Hospital. I am confident that Ball Memorial Hospital will help me reach my peak potential while providing me with a platform to work in an area where I’d make the most impact.\n\nOutside of work, I like to be outdoors for adventurous water sports or a simple tennis game. I love traveling and taking road trips. Hanging out with friends and family and going on shopping sprees — furniture, car, clothes, shoes, you name it — are my go-to hobbies.\n\nRealistically, my plan involves being a hospitalist but I’m also interested in cardiology. Let’s see how life unfolds.\n\nI was born in Pakistan and graduated from one of the highly prestigious medical schools in Pakistan named Sindh Medical College. I moved to the United States in 2018; since then, I have rotated with many physicians, including a rotation at Stanford University. During one of my rotations, I was captivated by internal medicine due to its integral role in an individual’s overall health. IU Health Ball Memorial Hospital's residency program stood out due to its academic excellence, friendly environment and intense clinical training. During the interview, I felt welcomed and appreciated the positive energy and approachable nature of everyone, including the program’s attendings. This sealed the deal, and I knew I wanted to train at Ball Memorial Hospital.\n\nOutside of medicine, I like to spend quality time with my family and friends, watching Netflix, team sports, lifting weights, investing and exploring the nature.\n\nI was born and raised in Hyderabad, Pakistan. I completed my MBBS from Liaquat University of Medical and Health Sciences. After graduating, I started practicing medicine which allowed me to experience a variety of cases. I belong to a family of doctors so it did not take me long to realize that I should pursue a career in one of the best healthcare systems across the globe.\n\nI am delighted to be a part of IUH Ball Memorial Hospital training program. On the interview day, I was told by the senior residents that the program is supportive towards the residents. I feel confident in saying that these 3 years will be worthwhile and will make me a better overall physician.\n\nBesides medicine, I like to watch TV and take long drives. I am interested in exploring new places and I love to play cricket.\n\nI was born and raised in Karachi, Pakistan and graduated from Dow Medical College in 2014. After a year of internship, I got married and moved to Indianapolis in 2017. Since then Indiana has been my home!\n\nWhile I was preparing for my steps, I worked under remarkable mentors who introduced me to the health care system in United States. My combined experience from the US and Pakistan gave me an adequate exposure to different demographic parameters and clinical settings.\n\nWhen I started researching residency programs, IU Health Ball Memorial stood out for its academic focus, amazing facilities and exceptional faculty. Throughout the interview day, the collegial environment and approachable team definitely gave me a sense of belonging.\n\nBeing close to the family came as the cherry on top! I am delighted to be a part of IUH Ball Memorial Internal Medicine team.\n\nOutside of work, I enjoy spending time with my husband and son and doing arts and crafts.\n\nBorn and raised in Hyderabad, India, I frequently visited the United States in my younger days to spend time with my parents who emigrated. My love for science and a desire to render care to the diseased steered me towards Medicine.\n\nAfter graduating from Chalmeda Anand Rao Institute of Medical Sciences, I did a few stints as an extern across various hospitals in the US to gain more insight into the modus operandi of the health care system in the country. That’s when I fell in love with Muncie. The interview experience at IU Health Ball Memorial sealed the deal for me. The program was very welcoming, and the residents had the vibe I could connect to. I witnessed genuine happiness and was delighted when I learned that I matched here. I’m gung-ho about serving here while I learn to become a better and able physician.\n\nIn my free time, I love to hang out with my friends and family, explore diverse foods, cultures, and play soccer, chess, volleyball, and ping pong.\n\nI was born and raised in the bay area of California. As a first generation Asian American, I grew to recognize the importance of my own culture and how it strengthened my bond to the Asian community. The deep human connections and quality communications I gained through the mutual understanding of culture compelled me to travel abroad to broaden my world view. Thus, I completed medical school at Poznan University of Medical Sciences in Poland. Throughout medical school, I had the opportunity to take on clinical training in Poland, Taiwan, and the U.S. learning various medical and social cultures while obtaining valuable life lessons from my peers. These past experiences have come to shape me as a person, strengthening my core values in life and medicine. While I have always believed strongly in the values of compassion, logical thinking, support, and empathetic acceptance, through my broader understanding of cultures, I hope to foster an even deeper connection between me and my future patients enabling the highest quality of medical care. I am determined to carry and share these values of which I believe in.\n\nWhen I visited IU Health Ball Memorial Hospital I witnessed an undeniable supportive and empathetic environment among co residents and staff.

This is why I chose IU Health Ball Memorial Hospital.\n\nI grew up in Pakistan and then immigrated to the US (New Hampshire). Passion towards medicine landed me to a full scholarship in medical school in Pakistan followed by achieving my American dream of training in the US healthcare system. I did not come from a family of doctors, being the first and only doctor in my family, the interest in internal medicine evolved after losing my beloved grandmother from Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis- a grandmother/best friend whom I admired the most as a role model, for her exceptional humanistic qualities. Internal medicine got my devotion.\n\nThis dedicated journey led me to one of my interviews at IU Health Ball Memorial Hospital. I still remember each event of the interview day, the didactics at Ball Memorial are fantastic, the morning report is at its excellence while the residents, program coordinator, program director treated me like a family and clarity on program goals with emphasis on resident academic and clinical education was what attracted me to make an easy decision on why I wanted Ball Memorial to be the foundation of my training. Moreover, tremendous opportunities which I am being offered here in the program such as research projects, teaching medical students and experiencing the best training is a bonus of all.\n\nMy plan involves pursuing a fellowship of my choice. Internal Medicine, for me, has always been a calling as well as a privilege. My late grandmother’s confidence in me will be kept as a burning desire till I become a star physician. Besides medicine, I am a very social person, I love exploring new places and meeting new people. My vision for my career is to serve, as service to humanity is a service to God.\n\nI grew up in Beaverton, Oregon. I came to love the outdoors and spending time with my family.

After graduation, I moved to the United States, where I continued pursuing my dream of becoming a physician. While I was studying for the USMLE exams, I did several observerships in different specialties and I worked in research with pediatric kidney transplant patients. During this transitionary time, I was extremely fortunate to discover great mentors willing to share their knowledge, skills and expertise with me.

My first two years of medical school were spent at IU School of Medicine at the Muncie campus. I grew to love the people and community and I knew that it would be a perfect place to practice medicine close to my family.\n\nAfter graduating from Ross University School of Medicine, I completed a Transitional Year Residency Program for intern year at Redmond Regional Medical Center in Rome, GA.

The war of 2004 caused my family to leave the country to provide myself and my siblings with better education and opportunities.

I completed my undergraduate at Wayne State University in Michigan then medical school at Lincoln Memorial University in Tennessee.\n\nI am very excited to be part of IU Health Ball family for many reasons. IU Health Ball offers many opportunities and experiences that I look for in a program.

One of my all-time favorite heroes is Indiana Jones, which I believe is quite a coincidence.\n\nBorn in a family of doctors, I found my passion in medicine in my early teenage years. My dream of being a doctor was getting closer when I entered Tongji Medical College in China. While studying in medical school, I developed a major interest in exploring the prevention of disease progression and the effectiveness of treatment. When I followed the routine pathway to be an independent practicing doctor, I met the most important person in my life, my husband. He inspired me to realize there should be no limitation to my potential and the way of practicing medicine. So, I flew the Pacific Ocean to explore my potential and unlimited possibilities in the United States.\n\nOn the journey to preparing my medical training in United States, I worked in several different roles in quite distinct health care systems.

Seeing the residents interact during afternoon report, I noticed that the environment had a friendly familial vibe. I was pleased to learn that I was given the opportunity to obtain my training here, especially since it allows me to stay in the Indiana and be able to give back to an area that I grew up in.\n\nIn the future, I hope to continue my training in infectious disease or critical care. I also hope to be involved in teaching in some aspect. In my spare time, I enjoy jogging, camping, watching movies and playing tennis."
