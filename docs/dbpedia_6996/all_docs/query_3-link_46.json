        "text": "Another medical school I applied for was:\n\nUniversity of the East Ramon Magsaysay Memorial Medical Center, Inc. College of Medicine or mas kilala as UERM.\n\nFirst, why did I choose to apply in UERM College of Medicine?\n\nUERM has been a top performing school in medical education and kilala na talaga siya in the Philippines. It is marked Center of Excellence as a medical school which says a lot about what it can offer to future medical students.\n\nThey are using the Problem-based Learning Approach and Independent Study learning style.\n\nCurriculum is remarkable and their facilities are up-to-date.\n\nThey have a fair share of board examination topnotchers especially in the recent 2018 board exams, two of their graduates got the Top 1 and 3 spots!\n\nLet‚Äôs start with the enumeration of their requirements, shall we?\n\nONLINE APPLICATION\n\nThe first step is online application in their website: www.uerm.edu.ph.\n\nYou have to complete the online form with all required details. There are a lot of fields to fill in as compared to other medical school online forms I completed because you need to indicate your parents‚Äô information, character references, honors and awards received in the past, extra-curricular activities and financial information like the combined annual income of the family.\n\nOnce done, you need to submit the online form and also, print it because you‚Äôll need to pass a copy to the admissions office. Take note of this.\n\nPAPERWORK\n\nAside from the online form, you need to submit the following requirements to admissions office:\n\nBefore you apply, you need to have your NMAT score already and should still valid for the last 2 years upon taking it.\n\nWith UERM, you need to pass a Certificate of Good Moral Character from your college PLUS 2 recommendation letters from 2 former professors. Better choose wisely!\n\nNMAT SCORE. The required NMAT Score is at least 75, but the higher NMAT, the higher chances of winning. If you have a lower score, please do your best in increasing it by retaking the NMAT test.\n\nMadali lang naman ung mga paper requirements which you can secure kaagad.\n\nAPPLICATION FEE\n\nOnce you prepared the paper requirements of UERM, you can now visit the admissions office of UERM to pass them and pay the application fee of PHP 3,000.00. Mej pricey, but carry on. UERM is one of the best medical schools out there.\n\nLOCATION: 64 Aurora Blvd. Do√±a Imelda, Quezon City, Philippines 1113\n\nI came from Taft Avenue so I rode LRT 1 to Recto station and transferred to LRT 2 to V. Mapa station. Then, I walked nalang to go to the campus.\n\nPlease don‚Äôt be confused haaaa, magkatapat kasi ang UERM Hospital and UERM College of Medicine buildings. At first kasi, napadpad ako sa hospital pero ung admissions office ay across pala.\n\nThe admissions office is in the first floor and I passed my requirements to the administrator in-charge. She screened them and gave me a checklist of requirements. She also gave me a small slip endorsing me to accounting to pay the PHP 3,000.00 application fee.\n\nAfter paying the fee, I went back to the admissions office and they scheduled me for interview. After taking note, I left the campus already.\n\nINTERVIEW\n\nI OWE YOU THIS ONE. Huhuhu.\n\nOMG. I forgot my interview schedule! My memory sucks. I will update this post once my neurons helped me retrieve them. Hahaha.\n\nUPDATE (7/29/2018): I found my schedule back then! It was February 6, 2017. Anytime from 8:00 AM to 3:00 PM.\n\nThis was set in the application profile you created in the UERM website. üôÇ\n\nAnyway, so it happened. I went back to UERM for the scheduled interview.\n\nMy attire? Long sleeves, necktie, slacks and black shoes. Power dressing is key!\n\nI went to the admissions office in the 1st floor and was welcomed by the administrator. I filled out the attendance sheet and she asked me to answer an essay in the paper she handed me. If I can recall correctly, the essay questions were ‚ÄúWhy do you choose to apply in UERM?‚Äù something like that and ‚ÄúWhat are the current events in Medicine?‚Äù so you must have done your research. üôÇ During my time, I wrote about new vaccines created for cancer and more sensitive blood tests to detect cancer faster. If the same question appears in your application, why not share something about several bacteria getting more and more resistant to antibiotics and share how scientists work on this? Say something about Dengvaxia and how the medical community worked on this issue? How about NIPA virus? Research research research. Read well.\n\nDumating na din ung other applicants sa room and they began to answer the same essay.\n\nAfterwards, we were divided into groups and was given respective professor names to look for in UERM hospital or UERM College of Medicine building.\n\nYes, the next challenge was to look for the interviewer in their respective clinics sa UERM hospital. We were given lang which floor and the name of the doctor. Some naman were asked to look for the doctor in the same building, not in the hospital.\n\nIn my group, we crossed the road towards the UERM hospital and mejo naligaw pa kami pero nakarating din. Wala pa si doktora and nakaupo lang kami sa labas ng clinic niya.\n\nOnce she arrived, guess what ako nanaman nasa unahan ng pila. So that means, I‚Äôll be the first one for interview. Ha! Never changes.\n\nI entered the room and met this beautiful doktora who happened to be another OB Gynecologist. Like in my mind, nanaman? Lahat ba ng magiinterview sakin OB as my experience in FEU ‚Äì NRMF. Baka this is a sign? NOOOOO.\n\nShe asked me if I was given any evaluation sheet and wala. So I honestly told her na walang binigay samin so baka nakalimutan nung administrator kanina.\n\nShe used her notebook and we started. Here are the list of questions I was asked:\n\nTell me something about yourself.\n\nWhat do you know about UERM?\n\nWhy did you choose to apply in UERM?\n\nWhat are your strengths and weaknesses?\n\nAside from UERM, where did you apply for Medicine?\n\nWhat is the greatest challenge or failure you had in my life?\n\nWho would finance my studies? (She reminded me that entering Medicine is really costly.)\n\nHow do you handle stress?\n\nWhat were your extra-curricular activities in college?\n\nI think that‚Äôs it? It was fast lang and yung mga hindi ko nacapture na questions sa taas were follow-up questions regarding your answers. Of course, hindi siya isang tanong, isang sagot lang. Interviewers will follow-up if something is not clear from your answers, okay? No matter how hard you memorized your answers, please prepare for additional questions para hindi ka ma-caught off guard.\n\nAt the end, I asked questions to her and inquire if I can apply in any scholarship given my financial status, she said that UERM offers a lot of scholarships and I may inquire in the admissions office.\n\nAfter that, I thanked the professor for the opportunity and wished that may God bless her. Her last line was ‚ÄúI hope to see you in the clinics.‚Äù I felt I aced it and did a great job.\n\nMy tip for you is to do your best to be confident no matter how your hands are shaking and your body trembling because it is normal, interviews fill you with nervousness and anxiety. You just need to fake it till you make it. Appear confident and conversational. I knew someone who had a high NMAT and Magna Cum Laude from a Big 4 university; however she didn‚Äôt make the cut, probably because she is too shy. Do yourself a favor this time and show them what you‚Äôve got without any arrogance.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nMy admission experience with UERM College of Medicine was really smooth. It is the same standard process. I felt that the interview is the most challenging part of the process. You just have to ace it as well.\n\nNo additional test apart from essay writing. What you wrote in the essay should be the same answer you‚Äôll say in the interview ha.\n\nResults were released online in the UERM website and I passed! Thank God for another blessing. I am truly grateful.\n\nOnce qualified, you need to pay the reservation fee of PHP 30,000.00 to reserve your slot. You are only given 2 weeks to secure it.\n\nThat‚Äôs all for me!\n\nI hope that this guide helped you in any way.\n\nPlease do not forget to share my blogs to other medical school aspirants!\n\nI would like to plug my other posts for my admission experiences in FEU ‚Äì NRMF and PLM College of Medicine using the links below:\n\nFEU ‚Äì NRMF: https://ofallthingsmed.wordpress.com/feu-nrmf-medicine-admission/\n\nPLM ‚Äì CM: https://ofallthingsmed.wordpress.com/plm-college-of-medicine-admission/\n\nAsk me questions for UERM College of Medicine Admission!"
