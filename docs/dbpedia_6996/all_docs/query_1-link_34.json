I admired the love and inner strength the family members showed to their loved ones. It was a team effort, synchronized for healing. I knew I wanted to be part of that,” she says.\n\nDr. Corrales is board certified by the American Board of Family Medicine. She is a Fellow of the American Academy of Family Medicine. She earned her M.D. at University of the East at Ramon Magsaysay Memorial Medical Center in the Philippines and completed a family practice residency at University of Illinois at Rockford–Swedish American Hospital. She is a graduate of University of the Philippines, where she majored in cell biology.\n\nDr. Corrales has deep medical experience in a variety of settings, including long-term care and working to protect the people of Atlantic City against disease through the state’s Vaccines for Children and Adults program. She has also mentored young professionals as a clinical preceptor for physicians and nurse practitioners.\n\nA true big-picture thinker, Dr. Corrales has intimate understanding of how health affects the community and how the family dynamic affects health. She finds a similar philosophy in her colleagues. “AtlantiCare is one with the community, committed to build better and healthier lives,” she says.\n\nThat commitment to a better south Jersey pushes her work beyond the clinical. She and her team teach, advocate and marshal resources for better health – like transportation, social and psychological support and other basic needs.\n\nAt every stage of life, the family is key, where we derive our strength and support. It is very satisfying to have family members involved in the care of their loved ones. I love being part of that team.\n\nStarStarStarStarStar\n\nStarStarStarStarStar\n\n4.8 of 5 stars\n\n447 Ratings, 51 Reviews44751\n\nThe Patient Satisfaction Rating is an average of all responses to the care provider related questions shown below from our survey.
