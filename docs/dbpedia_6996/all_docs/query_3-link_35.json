        "text": "Sataban was created with the aim of helping teachers to teach and travel in Thailand and other Southeast Asian countries. Since then, it has evolved into a valuable resource for expats and families searching for the right school for their children and a platform for communication between schools and agencies throughout Thailand. As former teachers and parents ourselves, we understand the importance of a reliable and accessible tool. This is why Sataban has remained 100% free since 2013, and will continue to do so. Your feedback is important to us, so please share your thoughts with us. Thank you for making Sataban a better platform."
