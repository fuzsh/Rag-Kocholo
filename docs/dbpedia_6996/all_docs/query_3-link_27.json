        "text": "I submitted my application to UERM on 2020 January 24. I was interviewed on Jan 31 and got a ‚ÄúHighly recommend‚Äù rating from the interviewer. The documents I submitted to UERM were\n\n1. Certificate of Graduation\n\n2. Original copy of Transcript of Records\n\n3. Signed Application form\n\n4. Original copy of NMAT score\n\n5. One Certificate of Good Moral Character\n\n6. Two letters of recommendation from professors in college\n\n7. Long plain folder and brown envelope\n\nApplication has to be submitted in person to UERM. Closest LRT station is Sta. Mesa and the admissions office is located on the opposite side of SM Sta. Mesa. Yung same side kasi ng SM is yung hospital.\n\nResults were released on Feb 26 and you‚Äôll be able to seem them in the application portal https://apps.uerm.edu.ph/app/admission\n\nUERM requires an NMAT percentile rank of 70. If you don‚Äôt meet this score, you‚Äôre going to have to write a letter of intent which you‚Äôll submit with the other requirements.\n\nUERM Interview\n\nIf you‚Äôre a great talker, you won‚Äôt have to prepare for the interview at all. My interview lasted for about an hour and a half. There are a lot of personal questions like things about your family, hobbies, study habits, etc. Before the beginning of the interview, they‚Äôll give you some essay questions. There‚Äôs no time limit in answering these questions. They‚Äôll give a hypothetical scenario and you‚Äôre going to write what you‚Äôll do if you were in that situation. There were also some ethics questions and you‚Äôll rank the given scenarios as to which you think is the most morally acceptable.\n\nI didn‚Äôt enroll in UERM. For the enrollment procedure And Scholarship Application, please refer to https://justarandommedstudent.wordpress.com/2020/03/05/uerm-college-of-medicine-enrollment\n\nUERM Reconsideration\n\nA kind person sent me last year‚Äôs (2019-2020) guidelines for reconsideration for UERM. UERM sent this email to waitlisted students\n\nGood Day!\n\nBased on our records, you are qualified for request for a reconsideration of your application to our college. A facilitated process of application is available.\n\nYou must make sure you are the following:\n\nI. that you have submitted the complete requirements for application for the school year 2019-2020\n\nII.

That you have good oral and written communication skills in both filipino and english\n\nV. That you are of good moral character\n\nVI.

Affix your e-signature, scan and save as PDF and send to admission@uerm.edu.ph\n\nYou must wait for the admissions office to notify you via email if your application for reconsideration is approved for processing.

Can I apply?\n\nYes. Pwedeng to be followed yung NMAT score mo\n\nDi ako natanggap. What should I do?\n\nyou can submit a letter of reconsideration. This can‚Äôt assure that you‚Äôll be able to secure a slot.\n\nBecause of the community quarantine I can‚Äôt submit my letter of reconsideration to UERM. What should I do?\n\nyou can send it to them via email.\n\nInsights\n\nThese were sent to me anonymously. Each med school has their own strengths and weaknesses. This is to serve as a guide for those who are still deciding which med school they would like to go to.\n\n‚ÄúHi! My girlfriend goes to ust med and i‚Äôm in uerm so i might be able to provide some insight on this. Regarding the different types of ‚Äúoutsiders,‚Äù i think ust is best if you‚Äôre a foreign student. The profs ask if everyone understands tagalog at the beginning of each class, and the orgs for foreign students are strong and supportive. If you‚Äôre from a non-traditional pre-med naman (mine was engineering haha imagine the jump), uerm profs are sooo good and so diligent at explaining concepts that are mostly common knowledge na for those who went to bio, medtech, etc. My girlfriend‚Äôs from polsci naman and she had no idea what biochemistry even was before she went to med. She said she legit felt frozen during biochem lectures üòÖ Plus she says na ust traditional pre-med grads daw tended to be clique-y, so being both a foreigner and a polsci student, it really freaked her out. She‚Äôs fine now, but it was a struggle for both of us back then‚Äù"
