        "text": "Most people planning to enter medical school apply to more than one or two universities. One of the reasons why I didn’t post much about tips on applications because I feel that I lack the credibility to do so due to lack of experience having only applied into two medical schools. Why? Mainly because it is more practical from the cost of the requirements for application. Well, more of the “Why’s” in the next few parts of this post.\n\nThe Roads Not Taken\n\nIt was difficult deciding which school to cross out amongst the top five I have chosen before my NMAT Result (ASMPH, PLM, UERM, FEU-NRMF, UST). Before getting into the Why I chose the school I have applied to, here’s a quick look as to why I didn’t apply to the others.\n\nPamantasan ng Lungsod ng Maynila College of Medicine\n\nPLM has a fairly low cut off NMAT percentile–45. The catch is they have an entrance exam (MCAT) which is not supposed to be a problem, it’s just that I was working at the time and I really didn’t have the time to process all the other necessary requirements. Then, I began to consider the location from home which is quite far compared to those included in my top three. Nevertheless, PLM is one of the best medical school in the country.\n\nFar Eastern University- Nicanor Reyes Medical Foundation\n\nWell, this was mainly because it’s the farthest among my top 5 medical school. I would have had to pay extra for dorm because I don’t think I’d be able to survive med school going home all the way from Fairview every day. Another reason is that most of the people from my school goes to FEU-NRMF for med. And I honestly wanted a fresh start in medical school where I don’t know anyone so that I could also build more friendships, networks, etc.\n\nUniversity of Santo Tomas Faculty of Medicine and Surgery\n\nUST is one of the best, oldest and most popular medical schools in the Philippines and it’s really tough to get in. Having only 500 accepted applicants among all those who submitted and prioritizing those either coming from UST for pre-med or those who have relatives who graduated in UST as well. I’m neither of those. Also, I do not identify with the institution’s principles, I didn’t bother trying.\n\nAlong the Way\n\nHere’s my application experience. I’m dividing it into four parts. Brief info about the school, my “why’s”, requirements and interview.\n\nUniversity of the East Ramon Magsaysay Memorial Medical Center (UERM)\n\nBrief information\n\nUERM is one of the top institutions for medical school, located along Aurora Boulevard, Quezon City. UERM has its own hospital also (UERM Memorial Hospital) beside its campus. Their 4-year curriculum uses Problem-Based Strategy instead of a traditional which is a more practical approach than theoretical. Through its years (est. 1956), it is internationally accredited and recognized having partner hospitals abroad.\n\nWhy’s\n\nThis school is actually recommended by my uncle since he recently worked there. I also read that their curriculum gears you for USMLE (US Med Licensure Exam) which I intend to take in the near future. It’s the second closest medical school in the area, closer than PLM. So, getting there is not a hassle. We’ll be arranged by sections and their curriculum are by subjects as well (ASMPH is Modular) which I won’t have a hard time adjusting to. Most of the good doctors in practice that I know personally are either from UP or UERM which increased its credibility.\n\nApplication and Requirements*\n\nI applied for UERM quite early in the year (2017) because their online applications are always open, but at the time the applications for school year 2018-2019 was not. When it opened, I kept on scheduling and rescheduling my submission of requirements because of work. My NMAT Score is within their preferred score and the rest of their requirements are pretty quick and easy to acquire compared to ASMPH. So, from the online schedule, I printed my application form, passed the rest of the requirements, and they had me schedule for an interview through the online portal.\n\nInterview\n\nBefore going to the interview itself, I was given a questionnaire to answer. A part of which is an essay question. This said questionnaire is also where the interviewer will right his/her observation during the interview. It’s a one-on-one interview with a doctor in their clinic or a room. I was pretty chill during my first ever medical school interview and I think I did quite okay. I can’t tell at first because I was honestly nervous but as the conversation went on, I treated it as if someone is just trying to get to know me. It was short, and questions are common. I was afraid that I might be too laid back with my answers that it might affect my application. Well, I have no choice but to wait for the results anyway.\n\nAteneo School of Medicine and Public Health (ASMPH)\n\nBrief information\n\nASMPH is part of the four Professional Schools of the Ateneo. This school is situated along Ortigas Avenue, Pasig City behind Medical City which is their primary partner hospital. It offers a dual degree program MD-MBA with a 5-year curriculum. It has only opened in 2007 which is quite recent compared to other schools but have already made its way to the top 10 medical schools in the country since its first batch in 2012.\n\nWhy’s\n\nBesides the fact that it’s the closest medical school to my place, tuition fee-wise it’s also worth it, having to pay for 2 degrees for a price that is almost the same as other medical schools or even less. I wouldn’t have to adjust much on population size of the batch and the size of the school itself because that’s almost the same from my premed also. The mission and vision of the school is what captured me.\n\nApplication and Requirements*\n\nThey started their applications around the second week of November which is earlier than most schools and ended early also in second week of January. Sadly, my NMAT score is at least 5 points below the requirement but I appealed for reconsideration to review of my application knowing that NMAT is not the only criteria for admission.\n\nWell, they required a certificate of class ranking, apparently CEU-Makati does not release that kind of document, so I requested for a letter which stated that the school does not provide such. They also required a three-page essay which I carefully thought of before submitting. I learned after my application that I lack one pre-requisite subject to enter the school. That is Cell and Molecular Biology. I took the long shot by taking the subject in Ateneo Loyola Schools (LS) without the results for and of the interview. That’s how badly I wanted to get in. All requirements are passed through online upload except for the recommendation letters.\n\nInterview\n\nThere’s this agony of waiting for the results of the interview list. You see, their process is composed of 2 phases before acceptance. Document review phase and the interview phase. Only when you pass the former will you be accepted for the latter. My appeal was for the document review.\n\nI was so terrified because I was not getting any e-mail from the Admissions Committee at the time when my classmates in LS were receiving them. I checked my online applications and saw my acceptance for interview two days AFTER the deadline of my schedule. I immediately called the office to reschedule good thing they were considerate. Hard copies are submitted during the interview also.\n\nThe interview was nerve-racking. It’s a panel interview unlike in UERM. I felt like I screwed up the answer to the first question. Tell me about yourself that is not in the application. At first, I thought, “I put everything I could say IN THE APPLICATION”. Most of the questions are about leadership. I honestly thought I could have done better in that interview, but I didn’t sulk about it anymore since it has been done.\n\n*Click to know application process of the school\n\nThe Pursuit of Happiness\n\nGiven my whole application experience, the results of each school were still uncertain. It took both of the schools a month or so to release the roll of accepted applicants. UERM released the results first after four days ASMPH released theirs. The way I received the results was quite unexpected. Are you ready for the results? Here they are!\n\nUERM\n\nI learned about the result through their facebook page and I only knew because a friend from internship tagged me and we weren’t even that close. I was surprised that he did. Then, I checked the online application to see this.\n\nI felt ecstatic. It was surreal. In my head I was like, “This is it. I’m going into medical school”.\n\nASMPH\n\nI had a dream about my ASMPH result and the moment I woke up I went on twitter to search if anyone had already received e-mail from the admissions. It turns out some already did. Two days have passed and there isn’t any e-mail yet, so I opted to go to ASMPH to ask and Sir Jed from Admissions just told me that if it’s not in the e-mail, it must be in the online application. I was driving while checking my online application (It was traffic, okay. Don’t judge me). I cried when I saw the result.\n\nIt turns out that the result in the online portal was posted 2 hours before I went to the school. It’s the happiest moment of my life.\n\nThe Chosen Path\n\nFollowing the UERM admission is the instruction for confirmation and so I was confronted with a dilemma, “To wait for ASMPH or to secure a slot in UERM as soon as I can?” There is a confirmation period in UERM and I decided that I will wait until the last day before I confirm a slot to give time for ASMPH Results. And so, results were released within the period.\n\nIn case you don’t already know, I chose ASMPH. Why? I learned about ASMPH since my third year in undergrad and it has been my dream school ever since. The school does not only aim to produce doctors but also leaders. I chose this path because I believe that this school will bring the most out of my potential as a doctor, as a leader and as a social catalyst altogether. ASMPH is a reminder that if you really want something you’d do whatever it takes to get it. I appealed for document review, applied for the lacking units without knowing if I passed the document review or not and I even took online courses to help me with credentials.\n\nHere I am, ASMPH! I am ready for you."
