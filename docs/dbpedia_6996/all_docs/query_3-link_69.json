        "text": "If you’re reading this blog post, you probably received a text last February 26, 2019 from UERM saying “UERM Admissions. Please access the applicant’s portal to determine the status of your application to the UERM College of Medicine for SY 2020-2021.”\n\nAnd if you opened the applicant’s portal and it said something like this: Congratulations! You’ve been accepted in the College of Medicine.\n\nThen congratulations to us! We passed and made it to the 1st list of accepted applicants at the UERM Ramon Magsaysay Memorial Medical Center, Inc. College of Medicine! Yay!\n\nMedyo nakakatakot yung kasunon ng congratulations, for sure, kasi it’s saying that we have to reserve our slots already and enroll by March 13, 2020, or else our slot may be withdrawn. But don’t worry, I’ve already enrolled so I have written this blog as a guide for you in process of enrolling for your first year of med school in UERM.\n\nHere were the things I did to reserve my slots and enroll.\n\nFirst, I went to UERM Admissions Office at the Ground Floor of the Administration Building. The administration building is the first building on your left as you enter the UERM Main Entrance (the one sa side ng Aurora Boulevard). Go straight until the end of the hall and you will find the admissions office on your right. You can go to the admissions office if you have some questions you want to ask, such as your lacking requirements, etc.\n\nFor me, I didn’t know where to go so they told me to go to the Registrar, which is located on the 2nd floor. You can proceed there by going up the stairs just in front of the admissions office and on the 2nd floor, you can find the Cashier, Accounting Office, and the Registrar.\n\nFrom there, I proceeded to go to the Registrar’s office window and told them I am reserving my slot for the College of Medicine. The person told me that once I reserve my slot, I have to enrol agad so I needed to pay for the tuition already. Don’t worry, you can pay in installment naman or you can pay in full, if you’re rich and all that lol.\n\nThe person then told me to go inside the office and gave me a bunch of papers. First, I filled up a paper that said Information and Advising Form, There I filled basic information about myself such as name, address, birthday, place of birth, etc.. I also had to fill up the Senior High School I went to (I just put my high school in since we didn’t have SHS before pa) and the school I attended for my undergrad. There was a table at the bottom half of the page, which looked like the advising form, but I didn’t have to write anything on it.\n\nAttached to that paper was a Data Privacy form chenes which I honestly didn’t read that much, but signed anyway haha. I was also given two forms, stating that I passed the College of Medicine and that I need to pay the non-refundable and non-transferrable reservation fee of 30,000 pesos. Don’t worry, they’ll subtract that naman from the total fees you need to pay for the whole semester.\n\nAfter filling up and signing the forms, I then went to the Cashier to pay for the reservation fee. You can pay in cash, cheque, or even debit and credit card. (Cheque should be payable to any of the following:\n\n– UERM\n\n– UERMMMCI\n\n– UERM Memorial Medical Center\n\n– University of the East Ramon Magsaysay Memorial Medical Center Inc.\n\nFor me, I paid credit card because despite having that money already in my bank account, I didn’t want naman na mawala agad sakin yun lol. I was given a receipt afterwards, which I gave to the person in the Registrar’s office again.\n\nI was then given a form with the steps for the enrolment procedure, which I honestly which I had before para di na ako nagpa-ikot ikot and nahirapan tumawag sa admissions office lol. Anyway, I’ve typed out the enrollment procedure and you can find it at the bottom of this blog post. I’m just detailing out the things I’ve done here para mas informative.\n\nAfter the Registrar’s Office, I proceeded to the Information Technology Office at the Nursing Building, 3rd Floor. From the Registrar’s Office, go down the same stairs you went up to then turn right to the hallway. After the couches, where you’ll usually find students sitting down, there’s this small hallway you can pass and there you’ll find the Nursing Building just on your left ng slight. You can use the elevator on your right or just take the stairs, like what I did.\n\nIf you took the stairs, turn right and there you’ll find the IT Office. Enter the office and give your Information and Advising Form to them as well as your reservation official receipt. After encoding and assessment, you’ll be signing something and proceeding again to the Cashier where you paid earlier and pay for the tuition na. Like what I said earlier, you can pay in full, or just partial if you’re doing installment.\n\nThe down payment I paid for the 1st installment was P19,732.00. It included the ID Fee na. It showed the subject code and the breakdown of fees, which I will be posting below as well. After paying, I was given another official receipt, which I then showed to the person in the IT office again.\n\nAfter that, totally unprepared, it was picture taking time for my ID. Since I was not prepared and didn’t know my picture will be taken already, I didn’t have any makeup HAHA. But since you’re lucky I was able to write this and you were able to read this before enrolling, pls mag-ayos kayo kasi 4 years niyo rin yan suot lol.\n\nFor the picture taking, I was given a blouse which I wore over my top. Tip lang, just wear a thin t-shirt and preferably something na medyo mababa so that it won’t appear on top of the blouse or you don’t have to pull it down na.\n\nAfter having my ID picture taken, the person behind the computer made me check the spelling and information to be shown on my ID. I then signed on this thing for my signature, then I was good to go.\n\nFinally, the last step for the enrollment is the Annual Physical Check-up. Go out through the main entrance and on your left, you’ll see an overpass you’ll be crossing to go to the Infirmary Section of the Hospital (OPD-P.O. Domingo Bldg.).\n\nOnce you’ve passed, you’ll enter the College of Medicine just on your right, and there you can ask the guard na lang how to go to the Infirmary Section. Note that the Infirmary Clinic is open Monday to Friday from 8:30am-11:30am and 1pm-4pm.\n\nOnce you’re in the Infirmary Clinic na, give them your Official Receipt and a 2×2 ID picture. There, they’ll be taking your usual information, vital signs, etc. You’ll then be referred to get your XRay and CBC done at the building just across the infirmary. You’ll be crossing the street for that.\n\nAnd you’re done! Congrats! You’re officially enrolled! I hope to see you as we start our first year of medical school at UERM. If you have any more questions for me, you can tweet me or send me a DM at @randommedstud on Twitter.\n\nHere are a few questions lang you may have, which I have the answers for LOL.\n\nWhat are the things I need to bring for the enrollment?\n\nYou need to bring a pen to fill out the forms, money (P30,000 for the reservation fee and P19,732 for the 1st installment, if you’re not paying it full). You’ll also need a 2×2 ID picture for the Physical Exam. Optional: Make-up for the picture taking and maybe a suklay para makapag-ayos ka before it HAHA.\n\nWhat if I have not completed my requirements yet, do I need to bring them?\n\nYes! If you only gave photocopies or you informed them na to follow yung ibang requirements, then bring the original copies. You’ll need a complete official transcript of records, certification of graduation or authenticated copy of diploma, transfer credential certification, original copy of NMAt score, and one long folder with plastic cover.\n\nWhat if I’m still waiting for the results from another medical school?\n\nYou have the option to pay for the non-refundable and non-transferrable P30,000 reservation fee, or just give up your slot. It’s up to you whether you want to risk paying for it and not pushing through with the enrollment if you’ll be attending a different medical school.\n\nHow can I apply for a scholarship?\n\nI’ve attached a picture below on the steps on how to apply for a scholarship and their deadlines. You can just refer to that picture.\n\nWhat if I didn’t make it to the 1st list of accepted applicants? What are the chances of me making it to the 2nd list?\n\nI honestly don’t know, since UERM did not disclose (as of writing this post) about how many passed the 1st list. However, I think there’s a high chance there will be another batch to be released once the 1st reservation period has ended, which will be on March 13, 2020. You may call the Admissions Office for more inquiries on that.\n\nAnyway, that’s the end of my post! I hope I was able to help you in the reservation and enrollment process.
