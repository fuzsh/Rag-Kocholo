        "text": "In 2006, after much clamour from the clinical science faculty and upon the recommendation of the Faculty Senate that was organized by the President of the University, the Board of Trustees has approved the modification of the innovative curriculum implemented from 1998 to 2006 to a curriculum that utilizes the best features of the traditional and the problem-based strategy. The first two years are correlated by systems using large classroom teaching, small group discussions and laboratory exercises. At the same time, clinical skills are acquired increasingly from exposure to clinical materials using the skills laboratory and the patients in the hospital wards through preceptorships and bedside teaching activities from the second and third year. In contrast, the fourth year is clinical clerkship."
