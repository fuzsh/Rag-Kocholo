        "text": "The Admissions Committee of UERMMMC is quite different from that of ASMPH. As I've mentioned in my Guide to ASMPH post, ASMPH showed all their applicants that they were welcome and wanted by the school regardless of what status you may be academically, financially or whatever aspect of your life you may be worried about. In my experience with UERMMMC, the committee members were explicitly non-chalant with their applicants. However, I might have this feeling just because of how impressed I was with the accommodations of ASMPH. In a more positive light, this may show that UERMMMC is merely being professional with their work. Anyway, before I further poison any wells, I considered entering UERMMMC because it is known for its Level IV PAASCU Accreditation and output of students (considering their high board exams). Additionally, I know a lot of doctors from UERMMMC who are doing quite well. One of which is Dr. Jhuliet Balderas, my pedia-cardiologist, who is known for her expertise in both consultation and surgical practice. Another is Dr. Elizabeth Javillo, my pediatrician in Lipa, who has never failed us.\n\nApplication Requirements\n\nFor our batch, the requirements were:\n\nAccomplished (Online and Printed) Application Form with 2 pieces of 2\" by 2\" photo (white background)*\n\nApplication Fee of Php. 3000.00\n\nOfficial Transcript of Records (TOR) or True Copy of Grades (TCG)*\n\nCertificate of Candidacy for Graduation*\n\nOfficial NMAT Result (must be 75 and above)\n\nBirth Certificate (all) and Marriage Certificate (only if married) authenticated by NSO\n\n2 Certificate of Good Moral Character from 2 former professors\n\nThe deadline for our submission was January 16, 2017; however, it was moved to February 10 due to the large volume of students applying for UERMMMC. Better submit early, so you can schedule your interview early, as well. Unlike ASMPH, UERMMMC requires you to schedule your interview immediately after you submit your requirements.\n\n(1) You'll have to fill up the application form online and print it. It's easy to answer, but the references may be difficult for others to answer, especially if you aren't so close to your professors. This is where being a 'teacher's pet' is an advantage. The professor will definitely remember you, and you can contact him/her to back you up for these kinds of requirements. Make sure to approach your professors before placing them as one of the three references required in the application form because you'll be releasing private information about them: cellphone number and address.\n\n(3) Again, like I've mentioned in my Guide to ASMPH post, the Transcript of Records (TOR) is usually really hard to procure especially in our school, University of the Philippines-Manila. They'll say it will take about 15-20 working days, but because of the large load of people asking for their TORs, it takes a lot longer. You'll want to constantly return to the Office of the University Registrar (OUR) for an update. I went to OUR everyday to follow up with my TOR, so I could catch up with the deadline. Even so, my TOR still didn't catch up on the given deadline. Don't worry though! This is normal. TORs are usually followed up during the application process and sometimes during your enrolment (if you pick the school), so long as you submit a True Copy of Grades (TCG) from Office of the College Secretary (OCS). TCGs can be received 3-5 days after request and payment at OCS.\n\n(4) CCG (Certificate of Candidacy for Graduation) is not given unless you've been thoroughly evaluated by the OCS for graduation, and they usually can't give this until the end of March. So, this is usually followed up during enrolment process. Don't worry about not being able to submit this. It's completely normal.\n\nInterview\n\nThe interview is scheduled on the same day you submit the requirements aforementioned, and you'll be shown a paper you'll need to print and fill-up before the day of your interview. It's just a tiny piece of paper, but it's essential for your evaluation during the interview.\n\nThis is a memorable interview, not because it was fun or because it felt amazing, but because it's my first. And, in this interview, I learned that it's wrong to say that the interviewers will be the only one getting answers, but you'll do too! You'll understand what kind of doctors they intend to produce, the curriculum you'll be involved with, the people that you'll be surrounded with, and the principles that a particular school advocates. Given that, you'll know if you'll love this school or not. Sometimes, the best way to know what med school to pick is how natural and harmonious you are with a school's interviewer.\n\nI still remember the questions asked to me on that day (February 9, 2017):\n\nWhat is your GWA?\n\nIf you passed UPCM, would you still go to UERM? And, why?\n\nWhy medicine?\n\nWhat issues are you most concerned of today?\n\nAre you against death penalty?\n\nHave you had a friend in need and what advice did you say?\n\nHow is your family?\n\nWhat do you do in your free time?\n\nThe interview, all in all, was frustrating and boring. Frustrating because the interviewer opposed to my views of being pro-choice (abortion) but against death penalty. She said that it was conflicting, and she didn't give me a chance to support my perspective. It was an awful feeling to have your opinion trashed because she was a devoted Catholic. I definitely did not want to go back to a school with views like that, or, at least, to a school with a professor who was so narrow-minded. I am pro-choice and against death penalty because these two choices prioritize and support the people who are in need of help, not persecute them. Why would you prevent a mother from choosing to abort a child that she cannot support and allow both of them to starve and die anyway? Everybody cares so much about the baby in the womb, but when they're out and facing the real challenges, no one suddenly cares. Let them die? No. Let them choose. The same goes for the wrong doers who people want sentenced to death. Let them choose their lives, but don't leave them alone. Care for the people who are in need, isn't that what God said? He who even dined with the sinners of his time wants us to support and prioritize giving people a choice, rather than deciding their faith by persecuting them to a path they do not want themselves in. We're not God, He is.\n\nResult\n\nI am ACCEPTED and the reservation fee deadline is on March 17, 2017. UERMMMC is my third choice, not that it should affect your decision in anyway, but the advantage I see in UERMMMC is their board performance and reputation. Skills are also well-honed in this school, as I've heard from doctors that I've known over my disease filled life HAHA. Other than that, I did not feel that UERMMMC is in line with the advocacies I live by, nor with the environment I wish to be in. I am still looking for a school that will help me continue my advocacy of patient empowerment while, at the same time, guide me to become excellent in both theory and practice."
