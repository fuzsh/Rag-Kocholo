        "text": "I have always been interested in neuroscience. In medical school, during my psychiatry experience, I loved spending time talking to patients and hearing stories about their lives. This experience led me to choose psychiatry for my residency. Later, during my residency, I spent two months at Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center for a required rotation, and I loved it. The notion of changing the trajectory of a child's life in a positive way by helping them through a mental health crisis is inspirational.\n\nAs a child and adolescent psychiatrist, I practice inpatient psychiatry and specialize in both psychopharmacology and psychotherapy. In treating patients, I consider all possible pharmacologic, behavioral, psychotherapeutic, family, social and academic interventions. I’m interested in quality improvement as well.\n\nIn September 2016, I was the recipient of the \"Excellence in Mental Health Care Award: Exemplary Psychiatrist – Children\" by the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) of Southwest Ohio.\n\nI believe service, teaching and leadership are important aspects of being a physician. I have held leadership positions in the Cincinnati Psychiatric Society, the Child and Adolescent Psychiatry Council of Cincinnati and Dayton, the Ohio Psychiatric Physicians Association, the Ohio State Medical Association and the American Psychiatric Association. I have served as a board examiner for the American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology. I’m currently chair of the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) Psychiatry Review Committee."
