        "text": "Every year, 16 students are elected into office by the student body to advance the interests and well-being of the College and its students through curricular and extracurricular activities. The study of medicine, in itself, is stressful and demanding, emphasizing the need for platforms to maximize the potential of every student, establish a sustainable network between different year levels, sections, collages, and medical schools, and settle the concerns that come about between the students and the administration.\n\nMore than a medical school horse blinded to books, transcriptions, cadavers, and laboratory paraphernalia, the College is never without a year jam-packed with events and projects. The year kicks off with a bustling 1st semester – the period where curricular activities dominate such as Freshtival, Rush Week, and MedWeek. The Coalition of Organizations, headed by the Internals Vice President and Secretary, also takes part in livening up the year with in and outside campus events.\n\nNeedless to say, the fun shouldn’t all be internal, right? Our college also switches to its extroverted side through events hosted by the Association of Philippine Medical Colleges (APMC), coordinated by our Externals Vice President. These events are usually grand and no matter the academic load, our College never fails to “Unleash the East.” The Regional Convention usually happens in November, MedGroove MedRhythmia in January, and Palarong Medisina in February.\n\nThe Council generally works as a unit, along with the supportive and engaging group of volunteers called the “VolCorps.” It can be clingy, outright messy and askew behind the curtains, but nevertheless works toward a common goal. At times when it can only do so much, it still tries to do what it sees best for the situation and the students. At the end of the day, it will always take value in every smile and victory.\n\nWords: Paula Pamela Tuano\n\nPhotos: UERM Medicine Student Council"
