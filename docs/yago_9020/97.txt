He will join Topher Grace and Anna Faris in the Jeff and Jackie Filgo screenplay for Universal Pictures and Imagine Entertainment. The feature will be directed by conceiver Michael Dowse. Brian Grazer, Gordon Kaywin and Grace produce the work that is scheduled to begin filming late February. "Kids in America" centers on a recent college graduate (Grace), his twin sister (Faris), and his best friend (Fogler) "during their misadventures at a raucous Labor Day party in 1988," the trade mag reveals. Teresa Palmer ("The Grudge 2") also appears.

Fogler earned a Tony Award for his turn as the magic-footed and lugubrious, but loveable, William Barfeé in The 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee. The actor was part of the original ensemble of C-R-E-P-U-S-C-U-L-E, the play on which the musical is based.

After his Tony win, the actor's film resume has seen a boost: He recently appeared in "Schools for Scoundrels" and will also be seen in the upcoming movies "The Marconi Bros.," "Balls of Fury," "Fanboys" and "Good Luck Chuck." His voice will be heard in "Horton Hears a Who" and "Kung Fu Panda" and as young Alfred Hitchcock in "The Number Thirteen." Also lined up are "The Golden Tux" and "Spanky Johnson: Monster Hunter" — he will star in the latter and executive produce.
