The film is inspired by real events.\n\nPlot\n\n[edit]\n\nInspired by real events,[1] Kids In America is a comedy about a diverse group of high school students who band together to peacefully stand for their personal rights and dignity. Holden Donovan and his love interest, Charlotte Pratt, are fed up with Principal Donna Weller, who goes to great lengths to stop the students from enjoying their right to free expression, such as suspending Monica Rose for wearing condoms on her outfit to promote safe sex during Spirit Week and suspending Lawrence Reitzer for kissing another guy in the hallway. Meanwhile, she's running for State School Superintendent, which, if elected, will afford her the power to practice her brand of administration beyond Booker High School. Holden himself is suspended and ultimately expelled for speaking out publicly against Weller, to whom he says, \"You're nothing but a politician\".\n\nThe students have an ally, Mr. Will Drucker, one of their teachers who encourages them to fight for their rights. He pays a price for his position and is fired by Principal Weller. He decides to use his dismissal to make a change of his own, using his new-found free time to produce a documentary chronicling the experiences of students who are faced with similar issues. Holden befriends a group of students, including libertarian Charlotte Pratt, voyeuristic punk-rock fan Chuck McGinn, cheerleader Katie Carmichael, Chinese-American Emily Chua, homosexual Lawrence Reitzer, African-American Walanda Jenkins, cheerleader Kelly Stepford, founder of the school's celibacy society Monica Rose, cheerleader Ashley Harris, and goth chick Dementia. Together, they engage in civil disobedience, passing out condoms and staging walk-outs, and organize the student body to take on Principal Weller and make a real change at Booker High. Due to their efforts, Weller loses the election and subsequently quits her job.\n\nCast\n\n[edit]\n\nStudents\n\n[edit]\n\nGregory Smith as Holden Donovan\n\nStephanie Sherrin as Charlotte Pratt\n\nChris Morris as Chuck McGinn\n\nCaitlin Wachs as Katie Carmichael\n\nEmy Coligado as Emily Chua\n\nAlex Anfanger as Lawrence Reitzer\n\nCrystal Celeste Grant as Walanda Jenkins\n\nNicole Richie as Kelly Stepford\n\nRosalie Ward as Monica Rose\n\nGenevieve Cortese as Ashley Harris\n\nRakefet Abergel as Goth Girl\n\nDamien Luvara as Rick Garcia\n\nMarcella Lentz-Pope as Elizabeth Goings\n\nRaymond Braun as Mo Williams\n\nFaculty and staff\n\n[edit]\n\nJulie Bowen as Principal Donna Weller\n\nMalik Yoba as Mr. Will Drucker\n\nAndrew Shaifer as Mr. Kip Stratton\n\nAdam Arkin as Mr. Ed Mumsford\n\nGeorge Wendt as Coach Thompson\n\nJeff Chase as Asst.
