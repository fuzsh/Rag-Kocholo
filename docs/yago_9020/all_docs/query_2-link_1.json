        "text": "If you're not yet familiar with the name Dan Fogler, don't worry - you soon will be. He's fast becoming one of the busiest actors around. Today we've learned that he's signed on to Kids in America, a comedy from director Michael Dowse about college graduates having one last night on the town before they go off to become proper grown-ups.\n\nFogler, a New Yorker who got his big break on stage in the musical production The 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee, joins Topher Grace and Anna Faris in the film, which is being produced by another name that keeps popping up all over the place at the moment, Brian Grazer.\n\nYou'll next see the portly Dan in School For Scoundrels, unless you watch the **Balls Of Fury **trailer first. He's also going to be a part of Kyle Newman's Star Wars road-trip dramedy Fanboys, the wedding scam comedy Good Luck Chuck, playing a goose in Kung-Fu Panda, providing a voice for Horton Hears A Who, and will slide into the shoes of Alfred Hitchcock (not literally, although we're told Fogler can move) for Number 13, where he'll play the famous director in a thriller that takes place behind the scenes of one of his own movies."
