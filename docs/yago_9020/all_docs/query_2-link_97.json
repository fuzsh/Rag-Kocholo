        "text": "8-Bit Christmas is a 2021 American Christmas comedy film directed by Michael Dowse, from a screenplay by Kevin Jakubowski based upon his novel of the same name. It stars Neil Patrick Harris, Winslow Fegley, June Diane Raphael, David Cross, and Steve Zahn. The film was released on November 24, 2021, on HBO Max, receiving generally favorable reviews from critics.\n\nStoryline[]\n\nJake Doyle recounts to his young cell phone obsessed daughter, Annie, how he, as a 10-year old in 1988, got his first Nintendo Entertainment System. The movie is told in flashbacks as Jake recalls the memory of that Christmas season, when all he wanted was the game console.\n\nTimothy Keane, the richest kid in his grade, is the only kid in town with the new Nintendo entertainment system and all the latest accessories. Every day, Jake and his friends gather with the rest of the school outside of Timmy's house, where he chooses ten kids to play in his basement. Timmy even ends up getting the NES Power Glove, only to discover that the product is a bit of a joke.\n\nTired of pandering to Timmy for access to the coveted Nintendo, Jake dreams of getting his own system for Christmas and approaches his distracted mom, Kathy, and forever DIYing dad, John, about getting one for the holidays, only to be shut down on the basis that video games are bad for your brain, and that he should play outside more.\n\nJake's quest for a Nintendo intensifies after Timmy angrily destroys his TV after losing a game, seriously injuring his family's dog. Hearing the first prize of a Scout fundraiser for selling the most Christmas wreaths will be a Nintendo, Jake and his friends compete to sell the most wreaths and win the system.\n\nJake endures the humiliation of wearing girl boots, shoveling dog poop, and family shopping trips to the mall. His sister has her own desired toy, a Cabbage Patch Kids doll, and Jake agrees to drop hints on her behalf, and even accompany John to a back alley deal to buy one of the sold out dolls, in exchange for tips on selling wreaths in the old folks' home.\n\nThe wreath sales end up being a dead end, after Timmy's father convinced the community to ban video games. The children decide to take matters into their own hands, selling baseball cards (including a rare Bill Ripken card) to pool their money, and buy a system to share. Without a ride to the mall, they concoct an elaborate plan to sneak away to the mall during a school trip to make their purchase, while their friend, Evan Olsen, creates a distraction. Jake manages to evade parents, who are protesting video games in front of the game store, to buy the Nintendo and run back to the bus, only for the game system to be crushed by the school bus. A kind adult (the Cabbage Patch dealer from earlier) whom sends Jake back to his field trip advises him to focus less on the presents, and more on the season of giving.\n\nChristmas Day comes, and Jake does not receive a Nintendo. Instead, John surprises Jake with a backyard tree fort he made himself with a trap door, ladders, and lights. Jake never got a Nintendo for Christmas, but the tree fort and his father's love for him was a better gift.\n\nAdult Jake tells his daughter he eventually bought his own Nintendo after working all summer to earn one, and shows her the tree fort, which remains standing, reminiscing about all the good memories made, and the adventures he had because of his father's gift. Despite John sadly having passed away, the family still saves an empty seat for him at the dinner table.\n\nSound Effects Used[]\n\nSound Ideas, CARTOON, WHISTLE - FLUTTER WHISTLE: LONG SPINNING WHISTLE (Heard once in reverse from a television showing a Looney Tunes short.)\n\nImage Gallery[]\n\nAudio Samples[]"
