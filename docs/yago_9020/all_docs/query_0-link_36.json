        "text": "Screen Media Films has acquired North American rights to the comedy Fubar: Balls to the Wall, which is scheduled to screen at the SXSW Film Festival in mid-March. The company plans a VOD and home video release April 19.\n\nDirected by Michael Dowse and written by Dowse, David Lawrence and Paul J. Spence, who also star, Fubar follows aging headbangers Terry and Dean as they try to find work on the pipelines and get in various misadventures. Andy Sparacino and Terra Hezelton co-star.\n\nGeorge Baptist, Shirley Vercruysse, Jennifer Wilson, Dowse, Lawrence and Spence produced the film.\n\n“We were immediately drawn to the fun nature of the film and think Dave and Paul have created indelible characters that appeal to the headbanger in all of us,” says Screen Media president Robert Baruc. “SXSW is the perfect festival for the film as it embodies everything ‘Dean’ and ‘Terry’ stand for – good times, good beer, and good friends.”\n\nThe film, a sequel to Dowse’s 2002 comedy Fubar, first screened at the Toronto Film Festival in September. Dowse directed the Relativity Media comedy Take Me Home Tonight, which will open in theaters March 4."
