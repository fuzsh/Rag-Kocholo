        "text": "My name is Bill Burns, Director of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), and I am excited to welcome you to the Spy Kids website!\n\nHere at CIA, we are on the frontlines of keeping our country safe. What exactly does that mean? It means hiring our countryâs smartest people from all walks of life. It means using technology to develop some of the coolest gadgets. It means traveling the world and building relationships to find information and uncover secrets. We bring all of that together to make sure the President of the United States and other senior leaders have the information they need to make tough decisions.\n\nItâs a difficult job, but it is one that the CIA can handle. Like you, our officers are curious about the world around them and excited by new challenges. They are also deeply committed to keeping you and our country safe.\n\nIf you want to learn more about our work, Iâd like to invite you to explore the Spy Kids website. Visit the âStoriesâ section for some inside information about CIA or, for a real treat, head over to the âSpy Dogsâ section to meet some of the CIA K9s.\n\nTo those parents and teachers out there, we havenât forgotten about you. Head to the âParents and Teachersâ section of the site to find a few handy lesson plans that can be used in the home or in the classroom.\n\nFinally, I wouldnât be a very good Director if I didnât send you on a mission, would I? Check out the âGamesâ section to put your spy skills to the test and get a taste of what itâs like to serve at CIA.\n\nAll the Best,\n\nBill Burns\n\nA lot of people think that CIA employees lurk around in trench coats, send coded messages, and use exotic equipment like hidden cameras and secret phones to do their job. (You know, all those things you see in movies or read about in spy novels.)\n\nThereâs a little of that, but thatâs only part of the story. The CIA is a US government agency that provides information (what we call âintelligenceâ) on foreign countries to the President, the National Security Council, and other US government officials to help them make good decisions about national security issues.\n\nWe were created by President Harry S. Truman and the National Security Act of 1947. He wanted to create a central hub to coordinate all of Americaâs intelligence activities. Thatâs why weâre called the Central Intelligence Agency.\n\nWe collect intelligence from all kinds of places! Once we figure out an issue of national security concern to our government, we look for ways to collect information about that problem. We have tons of different methods for collecting intelligence, but a few big ones are: recruiting people in foreign countries to provide us with information; translating foreign newspapers, magazine articles, radio shows and TV programs; studying images taken by satellites; and cracking codes and secret messages sent by other countries.\n\nAfter we collect the information, we have experts (called intelligence analysts) who try to figure out what is really happening, why itâs happening, what might happen next, and what it means for our country.\n\nItâs like solving a giant jigsaw puzzleâexcept with a bunch of missing pieces, a bunch of extra pieces, and not knowing what the final image will be before you solve it.\n\nOnce our analysts have solved enough of the puzzle and have good answers to those questions, they provide their assessments to US government officials, sometimes even the President! Itâs kind of like turning in a big research project or book report to your teacher at the end of the semester.\n\nThe government officials then use the information we provide to help them make policy toward other countries."
