She is studying hard and scored all A's and B's for her latest school work.\n\nTyler is also doing well, he is going to Job Corps which is a free education and training program that helps young people learn a career, earn a high school diploma or GED, and find and keep a good job.\n\nBarbara is not working long hours at Maid Rite, her mom has helped her to rent a new house with a view to eventually buying it, she is now saving up for household appliances as they don't have a fridge or a stove. Barbara still receives food stamps and has also been applying for several months for a better paid job at a factory but shes says that they are scarce and hard to get.\n\nShe would like to thank the viewers for recent donations, they will enable her to buy Kaylie and Tyler new clothes, shoes and school supplies and a new bed set for Kaylie's room and it will also go towards buying household appliances.\n\nDenise & Sera\n\n\"Sera is now in high school. It's a school for creative kids so she fits in pretty well. She's made some really good friends. She's really gotten into music so she's teaching herself how to play her acoustic guitar with YouTube videos. She's also going to take chorus to improve her singing voice. She's even talked about starting a band.\n\nI'm still writing and submitting stories to magazines. I've gotten stories sent up for a second read twice and responses other than that have been good. Sera and I are both still very active in the SCA.\n\nBeth has been pretty busy with Harley. She was attending college classes, but had to stop due to lack of childcare for Harley. She's working on getting that issue solved so she can go back to school. She's also learning to drive.\n\nPlease thank the viewers for their donations, teenagers always need so many things, it will help us a lot!\"\n\nJohnny & Family\n\nNews from Classie:\n\n\"Well our jobs are not so good, we had to apply for unemployment and file for unpaid wages from WIS International, so we left that job and are currently looking for something else.\n\nThe kids are ok, Johnny is in Chicago with my mom as he needs a push with his school work, he's in charter school and night school in order to get more credits and better grades. I pray for him in the big city, that's why we came up north, to bring him to my mom. Jaylan and Joshua are both in honors classes. Jaylan wants to go to the army and Johnny is still playing football and lost all feeling in his body, but thankfully he's ok. Jasmine is fine, she's just being a teenager.\n\nWe are just taking it day by day, but of course you always need things with kids; shoes, clothes and there are bills to pay.\n\nPlease thank the viewers for their donations from the bottom of our hearts because it's such a help and will go towards car insurance, lights and rent.\"\n\nBrittany's family\n\n\"Roger Graduated High School a year and a half earlier than his classmates. We are extremely proud of the way our children are growing up.\n\nWe had some sad news recently, we lost my mother in law unexpectedly. She had no life insurance, so along with my husband's sister we had to find money for her funeral costs.\n\nViewers donations will be a great help, please send our thanks.\"\n\nJune 2015\n\nSera & Family\n\nWe've had this wonderful news from Sera's mum Denise; \"Sera graduated 8th in her class and will be going on to high school next year. She's very excited because she got into the school she wanted. She plans to take Japanese and try out for the dragon boat team. It's a very creative school, so she's going to take dance if she can.\n\nI have also just become a grandmother. Bethany had a beautiful little girl Harleen Quinzel. She's named after Harley Quinn from Batman. Mommy and baby are very healthy and doing great.\n\n\"I am extremely grateful to the people who have helped us. Words could never explain how much we appreciate them; for their kind words, and thoughts and for their generosity. I hope that one day I will be able to return the favour somehow.\n\nWith their help we have been able to get a new roof on our home, which was a top priority as it was leaking whenever it rained, we were able to paint our living room, which was also needed, as there was mould and the wallpaper was falling off the walls due to the leaky ceiling.\n\nWe have been able to buy all three of the kids new clothes and shoes which were desperately needed. We also paid off old bills.\n\nRecently though, Josh had a bone infection in his hip and lost a good job, being unable to work for a few weeks, meant that we lost our vehicle. Josh is doing better now and is able to work again, but with the rain and him working outside he hasn't really had a steady income, so our bills have been piling up again, and we are still without a vehicle.\n\nWe still live pay check to pay check, it's very hard to try to save money, we always seem to manage though. We wouldn't have been able to do it without the help from all of the people who have donated.\"\n\nKaylie, Tyler and Barbara\n\n23rd July: News just in: Barbara found out this morning that she is now employed as a CNA at a retirement home. Well done Barbara!\n\nJuly 2014: Barbara has a new job as a nurse's aide; she is also going to classes to gain her CNA certificate of qualification, her long term goal is her LPN Licence. She is working hard to meet the payments on her trailer; it is still a struggle to pay all of the bills including gas, food, new school uniforms and shoes for Kaylie and Tyler who are both growing up so fast.\n\nAs soon as Barbara finishes payments on her trailer things will be much easier for them as they really need the extra money. Barbara has bought 4 chickens for their eggs, as they cost almost $4 US dollars for a dozen in the shops. Barbara's dream is to be able to buy some land to that they can keep cows and pigs, of which they would butcher and eat one a year, she would also like to have a garden and be able to grow food.\n\nNovember 2013: Barbara has moved several times since the film was shown. Viewers' generous donations have helped pay for rent, bills, furniture for the house and school supplies for the kids. Barbara is looking to start her own business and is saving up to buy a truck and spraying equipment.\n\nJanuary 2013: \"Quad City Arts' Visiting Artists Series\" invited Kaylie, her mother Barbara and her grandmother to a show by the Lula Washington Dance Company, a group from south Los Angeles. This was Kaylie's first time seeing a live performance. Afterwards Kaylie got to meet and talk to the dancers, several of them started in their teens and through hard work have excelled. They all encouraged her to follow her dreams.\n\nWhile waiting for the dancers to come out after the show, Kaylie was asked if she'd ever been on a stage. She said she hadn't but would like to so was invited on stage. The picture of the handstand is her signature move.\n\nQuad City Art's present over 160 educational outreaches during the year in several performing arts genres so students get a personal exposure to the arts and might be inspired by them.\n\nNovember 2012: Kaylie was back school and loved it. Her mother signed her up to see the school councillor to help her and she received some extra tuition in maths to help her catch up with what she had missed.\n\nBritanny & Family\n\nJuly 2014:\n\nA message from Brittany's family. \"We did not get too much lasting water damage from the from the flooding, it did however move the foundation. So we are now unable to turn our garage into a bedroom for our older son Roger. We also tried to get the house in our names, but were unable to due to the fact that we have No credit. Which is actually worse than having bad credit. So by this time next year, we are going to have to move. We tried to rent a vehicle to help get us credit, and also because we lost our truck, but my husband was unable to work for a while due to illness, and we lost the car. Now we have no vehicle. Roger, Brittany and Zakkary are doing fine. We have definitely outgrown our home, but we make do. My stress levels have been extremely high lately. I have been trying as hard as I can to stay calm by meditation, etc. When my husband is working our food stamps and my SSI are lowered drastically, he makes just enough to pay some of the bills. As of right now, he does odd jobs off and on. We struggle on daily, but somehow we always manage.\"\n\nOctober 2013: Donations helped with costs related to Zakkary's medical care. The family had to drive back and forth to Peoria for his doctor's appointments and donations also contributed towards the gas and repairs to the truck. They are now saving up to repair their house which was damaged in the floods.\n\nApril 2013: Brittany and her family suffered flooding and were only just able to survive in their house whilst floods swept across the Quad Cities.\n\nThis message was received from Brittany's family\n\nOur thoughts go out to Brittany and her family who are currently suffering massive flooding and are only just able to survive in their house while floods sweep across the Quad Cities.\n\nA message from Brittany's family: \"Thank you all for the thoughts, and being willing to help us, it means alot:) So far we are doing fine, the water isn't inside of our home yet. Praying that it doesn't though, this rain in Not helping matters. There are soo many others out here in my neighborhood who have already lost their homes due to the flooding. We could definitely use some prayers though:) Once again, thank you All soo much:) Just knowing that others care means alot to us:)\"\n\nJohnny & Family\n\nMarch 2014\n\nFantastic news!! We have just heard that Tom has a job in Florida and that the family have moved back there. It has always been their dream to return. A huge thank you to viewers who have donated to the Willis family which has definitely helped them to achieve their dream.\n\nApril 2013: One viewer gave Johnny an incredible gift a \"Legends of Iowa\" football camp scholoarship. The viewer won this as the highest bidder at a schools trivia night. The camp was held in Bettendorf on a July weekend and was coached and presented by current and former Iowa Hawkeye players, coaches and NFL players!!\n\nClassie would like to use any other donations towards their dream of moving to Florida.\n\nOctober 2013: The children and doing well in school. Johnny is playing for his high school football team and is trying hard to raise his grades. Jaylan's grades are excellent. Joshua has the same great spirit and great grades. Unfortunately Jasmine has been sickly with asthma and a lung infection which has meant the family having to take her back and forth to the doctors. Despite this, her grades are good.\n\nThe move to housing did not work out as well as hoped. The children were not allowed outside and there were fights and robberies in the complex. The family stayed for two months and left. They made the decision to move to a smaller house where they are now sharing 2 bedrooms but despite this they are much happier.\n\nTom secured a job as head of security at a factory and is keeping the family afloat. Cassie's biggest challenge now is finding the family an affordable home in a good area.\n\nSera's family\n\nJuly 2014 - Report from Denise: Sera is now 13 and has turned into a proper teenager. she has tons of friends, loves music (her favourite band is Black Veil Brides), and she did well in school this last year. She's very proud of the A+ she got on her Humanities project. It was a documentary on the Florentine Renaissance. She's been spending the summer camping with friends and playing baseball with the Junior Giants. She's really looking forward to starting 8th grade. Beth is engaged and living in Hanford. She's planning on going to college for Business. She wants to open her own costume shop. I am still looking for work. I've looked into fields other than office work, but going back to school is very difficult due to the type of housing program we are in. Money is very tight at the moment. We reuse and recycle as much as we can. It's difficult with a growing girl, but I think it's a good lesson. Our ancestors made it through the Depression, we can make it through this. We're very grateful.\n\nDecember 2013: Denise won the custody case and is delighted that Sera is allowed to stay with her. They were planning to have a great Christmas and even had a real Christmas tree named Eugene.\n\nPress contact:\n\nDiane Hebert-Farrell, (617) 300-5366, [email protected]\n\npbs.org/pressroom: Download promotional photography from the PBS Pressroom."
