        "text": "★★★★☆\n\nThe indie drama ‘Kids’ features a group of teenagers who appear to care about nothing but sex and drugs. Telly, the film’s protagonist, has one goal in life; to sleep with as many virgins as he can.\n\nDirector: Larry Clark. Starring: Leo Fitzpatrick, Justin Pierce, Chloë Sevigny, Rosario Dawson, Yakira Peguero, Harold Hunter. 18 cert, 91 min.\n\n‘Kids’ is an American coming-of-age film that divided critics when it was released in 1995. Some claimed it was exploitative and crude, but others championed it for being daring and powerful in its deliverance. After watching it, I would have to say that I sit somewhere in the middle. This indie drama features a group of teenagers who appear to care about nothing but sex and drugs. Telly, the film’s protagonist, has one goal in life; to sleep with as many virgins as he can. ‘Kids’ can be best described as a gritty portrayal of a hedonistic generation that is unromanticized to a fault. From the sleazy language that its characters use to its depressing depiction of youth culture and the reality of unprotected sex, ‘Kids’ is an unforgettable film that is perhaps as controversial now as it was back then.\n\nDrug abuse, sex, racism, and the AIDs epidemic in ‘Kids’\n\nDirected by Larry Clark and with a soundtrack featuring Daniel Johnston and Sebadoh, ‘Kids’ rejects the idealised teenage life seen in countless other coming-of-age films of its time. In fact, it couldn’t be further away from the likes of ‘Clueless,’ ‘Pretty in Pink,’ and ‘Sixteen Candles.’ With its brutal style and unflinching take on the selfish, even animalistic aspects of being young, ‘Kids’ is perhaps instead a more accessible predecessor to the disturbing 1997 film ‘Gummo.’ It is far from sensitive as it touches on subjects like the AIDs epidemic in America, racism, drug abuse, and a myriad of other controversial topics. However, this is because such issues are shown through the blinkered eyes of teenagers. Wrapped up in a world of their own where little matters, the characters in ‘Kids’ are seemingly ignorant to the consequences of their actions.\n\n‘Kids’ opens with Telly, who is played by Leo Fitzpatrick, making out with a 12-year-old girl in her bed and then proceeding to cajole her into having sex for the first time. This scene is nothing if uncomfortable to watch, and as such sets the tone for the rest of the film. We watch as Telly tells her that he loves her, that she shouldn’t be scared, and that he genuinely cares about her. He then immediately leaves her house to boast to his friend Casper, played by Justin Pierce. ‘Who am I? I’m the motha-fuckin virgin surgeon,’ Telly says proudly. Far from the archetypal cinematic portrayal of losing your virginity, ‘Kids’ shows the often grim reality for many young girls.\n\nThe debut performances of Leo Fitzpatrick, Chloë Sevigny, and Rosario Dawson\n\nTelly and Casper’s view of the world in ‘Kids’ is bleak but simple. The two boys chat up girls, take drugs, start fights, and talk about sex. They have no interest in getting a job, no perceivable hobbies, and a careless attitude that is at once disgusting and enthralling to watch. The film’s documentary style is perhaps what makes Larry Clark’s work so effective. Set in New York, it contains actors that the director discovered on the streets of the city, featuring the debut of now well-known figures like Leo Fitzpatrick, Chloë Sevigny, and Rosario Dawson. This provides a feeling of authenticity to ‘Kids’ that is, honestly, unmatched by any other film I’ve watched. Though many have called ‘Kids’ a sweeping generalisation and exploitative exaggeration of the harmful behaviours of young people, I think that was part of Larry Clark’s intent. The behaviour this film’s characters exhibit is shocking, but contains enough truth to relay its dark message.\n\nWarning: contains spoilers. Jennie, who is played by Chloë Sevigny, is a living embodiment of the consequences of Telly’s actions. Having accompanied her friend Ruby, played by Rosario Dawson, to get checked for STDs, she is shocked to discover that she has tested positive for HIV. Having only slept with one person, the irony is that Jennie was simply unlucky. She just so happened to sleep with Telly, who, knowingly or not, has been transmitting the deadly virus to quite the selection of young virgins. From here on in ‘Kids’ chronicles Telly’s mission to sleep with Darcy, the 13-year-old sister of an acquaintance. Knowing that he has HIV makes his actions, which are already disturbing, downright deplorable. Meanwhile, Jennie attempts to find Telly, perhaps to prevent him from passing the STD on further, or perhaps just to find some clarity from the boy that has ruined her life.\n\nWhy ‘Kids’ is one of the most controversial films from the 90s\n\nLarry Clark’s ‘Kids’ can be viewed as an honest warning of the dangers of unsafe sex, particularly in the 90s when it was a highly taboo topic. However, it also acts as a kind of exposé on the more perverted underbelly of teenage life. Stumbling around the streets of New York, being coerced into taking a strange pill at a grimy nightclub where lewd acts happen in public and nobody seems to care, Jennie eventually finds Telly at a party happening nearby. Unfortunately, she is too late, as she discovers him having sex with 13-year-old Darcy. As the party appears to end, the remnants of an orgy-like scene are shown on camera. With bodies strewn everywhere like the empty bottles and cigarettes that surround them, it is a haunting reminder of the damage caused by the film’s characters, some of whom appear as young as 10 or 11.\n\nThe most disturbing scene in ‘Kids’ is arguably its ending. Passing out on a sofa as the party winds down, Jennie is approached by Casper, who appears incredibly intoxicated. As if the poor girl hadn’t already gone through enough, he then proceeds to have sex with her unconscious body. This crude act of rape exposes Casper to the HIV that Jennie has, and cements Larry Clark’s work as one of the most controversial films that the 90s produced. The morning after, ‘Kids’ ends with a bleak but oddly profound monologue from its protagonist Telly:\n\n‘When you're young, not much matters. When you find something that you care about, then that's all you got. When you go to sleep at night you dream of pussy. When you wake up it's the same thing. It's there in your face. You can't escape it. Sometimes when you're young the only place to go is inside. That's just it - fucking is what I love. Take that away from me and I really got nothing.’\n\nShould you watch this before you die?\n\nOverall, ‘Kids’ is a brutal portrayal of repugnant behaviour that redeems itself by being simultaneously clever, compelling, and sincere. It contains great first-time performances from Chloë Sevigny and Leo Fitzpatrick, and a unique style of cinematography that adds to its feeling of authenticity. I can see why this film is so controversial, and as such I’d say it’s definitely not for everyone. However, ‘Kids’ is undeniably a powerful film. It subverts the coming-of-age genre in a way that is as impressive as it is disturbed."
