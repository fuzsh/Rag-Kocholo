        "text": "Hello, my name is Jenn Kepner. I have been a resident of Levittown my entire life. I have gone through Neshaminy School District, first at Albert Schweitzer, then Carl Sandburg, and finally, Neshaminy High School. I earned my bachelor's degree from Temple University, where I studied Elementary and Special Education. This is my sixteenth year teaching in Neshaminy.\n\nMy husband and I currently live in Levittown and have three beautiful children, Mason (12 years), Aiden (10 years), and Ashlinn (8 years). We enjoy spending time together playing outside, reading, and each year we look forward to our trips to Knoebels and the Outer Banks."
