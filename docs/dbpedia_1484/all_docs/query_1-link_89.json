If you would like to know wliat tJicy thlnk about Rice's Evanjjeliue In Columbus, Ohio, read this f rom the State Journal of Sept. 23d: \"The bcautiful and entertainint; Evangeline hasngain pcored a sucoess in this city. A more intcrestinj burlcsque could not be conceived, and the \"Metropolitan opera house\" has never disraissed an audieuce that more tlioroughly enjoyed a performance. No play has ever been prodiiced here costumed more elaborately or with bettèt taste.\" Ilice's Beautlful Evangeline G'o.,appears at the Grand Opera House, Ann Arbor, on Jan. 25th. Of Evangeline, little may be said. The cast is better tlian ever btl'oie. Miss Aüce Butler who takes the part of Evangeliue in the popular extruvaganza, was formerly a niember of D'Oyley Carte company, Snvoy tlieatre, Loddón, Eng., and has taken part In many of the original productions of Gilbert & Sullivan's operas, in that city. Miss Butler has a line suprano voice, and is an actress of ability. Evangeliue will only be 6een here once this seasoti, the engagement being lliuited to tlie performance ou Jan. 29th. AU those fond of pretty music, bright stage pictures, and witty dialogue should see the famous burlefque. Last October the University Dramatic Club entered 011 its third year of existence and comes nguin before lts friends in a play, not classical, not irraturalistir, but if not romantic, at least full of romance; the plot is the ever recurrlng one. A young man falls in love with a yóung lady and wants tomarry lier. But llila very comnion place want is not always satislied, in real lift-; there are many obstacles to overeóme; as difference of fortune, of rank; the presence of a rival, the dislike of parents, uot meatio:iing the dislike of the beloved object; And many are disappoiuted, unless some favorable cliauce, comes to their aid. In tliH present drama, '\"The Mystic Bell of ltoiHiuerolles,\" that help is popular superstition ; there is atradition in the country that on the lirst night that a new heir takes possesslou of the castte, liis satanic majesty in the garb or guise of heailstt'ward pays hiin a vibit; und some péople even assume they have seen the mysterious bell that summons blm. Our yoiiiig hero takes ad vantage of a peculiar meeting of circumstances to win the love of his idol, and the consent of the mother. The play is lively and amusing; the plot nterestiDg and the situation quite dramatic without beiug sensattonal."
