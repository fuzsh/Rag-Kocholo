        "text": "A. Whether Information in the Affidavit Supporting Warrant was Stale.\n\nAppellants contend that the affidavit in support of the wiretap application contained information that, although at some earlier date might have provided probable cause for electronic surveillance of the Lindenwood Drive residence, was stale. As with other types of search warrants, the probable cause needed to obtain a wiretap must exist at the time surveillance is authorized. United States v. Bascaro, 742 F.2d 1335, 1345 (11th Cir. ); United States v. Hyde, 574 F.2d 856, 864 (5th Cir. ). It does not satisfy the probable cause standard if the government can demonstrate only that the items to be seized could have been found at the specified location at some time in the past. Rather, the government must reveal facts that make it likely that the items being sought are in that place when the warrant issues. United States v. Tehfe, 722 F.2d 1114, 1119 (3d Cir. ), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 104 S.Ct. 1679, 80 L.Ed.2d 154 ( ).\n\nAlthough staleness is an issue that courts must decide by evaluating the facts of a particular case, Bascaro, 742 F.2d at 1345, we are not without guidance in making this determination. The length of time between the date on which all of the facts supporting probable cause were known and the date the warrant was issued is only one factor. Probable cause is not determined merely by counting the number of days between the facts relied upon and the warrant's issuance. United States v. Rahn, 511 F.2d 290, 292 (10th Cir.), cert. denied, 423 U.S. 825, 96 S.Ct. 41, 46 L.Ed.2d 42 ( ). Rather, the probable cause standard is a practical, nontechnical one. See Illinois v. Gates, 462 U.S. 213, 103 S.Ct. 2317, 2328, 76 L.Ed.2d 527 ( ). When criminal activity is protracted and continuous, it is more likely that the passage of time will not dissipate probable cause. Tehfe, 722 F.2d at 1119. In such circumstances, it is reasonable to assume that the activity has continued beyond the last dates mentioned in the affidavit, and may still be continuing. Time becomes less significant in the wiretap context, because the evidence sought to be seized is not a tangible object easily destroyed or removed. Hyde, 574 F.2d at 865. Therefore, when police describe telephone activity occurring over an extended period of time, the stale information issue should be construed less rigorously. Bascaro, 742 F.2d at 1346; Tehfe, 722 F.2d at 1119; United States v. Martino, 664 F.2d 860, 867 (2d Cir. ), cert. denied, 458 U.S. 1110, 102 S.Ct. 3493, 73 L.Ed.2d 1373 ( ); United States v. Weinrich, 586 F.2d 481, 491-92 (5th Cir. ); Hyde, 574 F.2d at 865; United States v. Johnson, 461 F.2d 285, 287 (10th Cir. ). 1\n\nIn the present case, a Florida Supreme Court Justice issued the wiretap order on May 31, 1983. The affidavit in support of the warrant application related that Sylvester Domme and his brother were suspected of drug trafficking between Florida and Kansas by the Topeka Police Department, as of August 12, 1982. Other information in the affidavit, which in no way has been impugned by appellants, was based upon incidents told to police by seven confidential informants. One of the informants, who admitted being involved in cocaine trafficking, stated that between 1979 and 1981, Aristides Brito was involved in a huge drug distribution scheme, and sold over three million dollars worth of cocaine. 2 Two informants identified Sylvester Domme as the person who supplied cocaine to Patricia Harrison, in 1982. Harrison, who was described in the affidavit as Sylvester's girlfriend, advised one of the informants that Sylvester Domme was distributing large quantities of cocaine in the Panama City area. Another informant described a trip he made with Thomas Domme, in July, 1982, from Topeka to Tuscaloosa, Alabama, where Sylvester Domme sold them one and one-half pounds of cocaine. The informant who told this story had been working for the Topeka Police Department for five years, and had provided them with reliable information many times. The most recent information linking the Lindenwood Drive residents with drug trafficking was provided by an informant who related in April of 1983, that until very recently, Gregory Goodson had been supplying him with cocaine. Goodson, according to the informant, was supplied by an individual in Panama City, who police believed to be Sylvester Domme.\n\nPen registers recording the phone numbers dialed from the Lindenwood Drive residence, toll records reflecting the long distance calls placed, and police surveillance of the house, corroborated the relationships and incidents described by the confidential informants. In addition, surveillance that was conducted sporadically for over two years revealed that other persons who resided at or frequented the residence had extensive records of or were suspected of drug-related activity. The phone information established that between January, 1982, and March 2, 1983, there were several hundred phone calls made from the Lindenwood Drive residence to persons suspected of drug trafficking. The phone number at the home had been changed five times in the twenty-eight months prior to the date of application. Agent Gilbert indicated that through his experience as a law enforcement officer, he had learned that this was a common practice among individuals engaged in drug dealing. At the time the warrant was sought, the phone was under the name of Donna Krawczyk, who police believed did not reside at the home."
