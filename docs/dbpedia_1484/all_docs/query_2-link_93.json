        "text": "Cass County Michigan Biographies\n\nFrom The History of Cass County by Glover\n\nPage C\n\nMALCOM A. CAMPBELL\n\nCAMPBELL, McCAPLINE\n\nMalcom A. Campbell is serving as alderman from the third ward in Dowagiac and is closely associated with industrial interests here through his conduct of a blacksmith and wagon shop. He is also engaged in the sale of buggies and wagons and has a business which is proving profitable. Moreover he deserves the success which comes to him because his life has been characterized by close application and unfaltering diligence. \"Through struggles to success\" is the usual rule of the business world and this axiom finds verification in the life of Mr. Campbell, who has worked his way upward, winning a fair measure of prosperity and at the same time making a record for business integrity that any man might be proud to possess.\n\nA native of Canada, Mr. Campbell was born in Lampton county, Ontario, on the 16th of September, 1861. His father, Duncan Campbell, is supposed to have been a native of Scotland and settled in Canada in early life. There he cleared a tract of land and followed farming until his death, which occurred when he was about fifty-seven years of age. He had married Sarah McCalpine, also a native of Scotland, who still resides upon the old homestead in Canada. By her marriage she became the mother of eight children, five daughters and three sons, all of whom reached adult age.\n\nMalcom A. Campbell, who[se] name introduces this record, was the fourth child and second son in that family, and was reared upon the old homestead farm in his native county. At the usual age he entered the country schools and therein acquired a fair English education, and when not busy with his text books he aided in the work of the fields, but, thinking that he would prefer a trade rather than to follow the plow, he began learning blacksmithing when sixteen years of age at a small town called Aughrim. He served an apprenticeship of three years, and after completing his term of indenture started out to work as a journeyman, following blacksmithing at different places in Canada and the United ing the third ward, in which connection he exercises his official prerogatives to promote measures of reform and improvement. He belongs to the Independent Order of Odd Fellows, the Order of Foresters and the National Protective Legion. There have been no exciting chapters in his life record, but he possesses those sterling traits which work for good citizenship, for activity and honor in business and for fidelity in private life.\n\nTyped by Barbara O'Reagan\n\nANDREW F. CAUL\n\nCAUL, FETZER, HOISINGTON, SWEET, STANNARD, COOK, DENIO, JONES, BRITTON\n\nAndrew F. Caul, a prominent farmer residing on section 35, Marcellus township, has from an early period in the development of Cass county resided within its borders. He was born in Chillisquaque township, Northumberland county, Pennsylvania, September 28, 1834, a son of Neal and Susannah (Fetzer) Caul, both also natives of Northumberland county. >From the Keystone state they came to Michigan, taking up their abode in Marcellus township, Cass county, where they spent the remainder of their lives, the father passing away at the age of fifty-seven years, while the mother survived until she had reached the seventy-third milestone on the journey of life. They were the parents of four children, namely: Andrew F., whose name introduces this review; Elizabeth, who became the wife of Norman Hoisington, and died in Marcellus township; Daniel, who laid down his life on the altar of his country during the Civil war, in which he served in a carpenter's corps, returning home with typhoid fever, from the effects of which he died; and Emeline, the wife of Highland Sweet, of Marcellus township.\n\nUntil eighteen years of age Andrew F. Caul remained in Chillisquaque township, Northumberland county, Pennsylvania, the place of his nativity, there receiving his education, and when not employed with the duties of the school room, worked on the canal. In 1852 he came with his parents to St. Joseph county, Michigan, where for three years he was employed on his father's farm, and in 1856 the family took up their abode within the borders of Cass county, the father here purchasing one hundred acres of wild land. Soon after coming to his new home, however, the father died, and Mr. Caul and his brother placed the farm under cultivation, and the former erected all the buildings which now adorn the place. He has also added to the original purchase until he now owns two hundred acres of fertile and well improved land on section thirty-five, Marcellus township. When this pioneer family first located on this place their nearest trading point and postoffice was Three Rivers, while at the present time their mail is delivered to them at their door from Marcellus.,p> In 1859 Mr. Caul was united in marriage to Lydia Stannard, and after her death he married Mary C. Cook. For his third wife he chose Ida Denio, and they have five children, namely: Bessie, wife of Kit Jones, of Marcellus; Harley, who conducts the home farm; Myrtle L., the wife of Charles Britton, of Ohio; Donald, who died at the age of nine years; and Lamont, a resident of the state of Washington. In his political affiliations Mr. Caul is a lifelong Democrat, and his first presidential vote was cast for James Buchanan. In 1873 he was elected to the office of supervisor of Marcellus township, in which position he served for ten terms.\n\nTyped by Barbara O'Reagan\n\nFRANKLIN CHAPMAN\n\nCHAPMAN, HAGGERTY, CLEVELAND, POUND, STALLEN, WILLIAMS, NORTON\n\nThe agricultural interests of Newberg township find a worthy representative in Franklin Chapman, who is now living on section 17, where he owns and operates one hundred and sixty acres of land, in connection with which he is successfully engaged in stock-raising, making a specialty of St. Lambert and Jersey cattle. He was born December 18, 1853, on the farm where he yet resides, in a little log cabin which was one of the typical pioneer homes of the county. He is descended from an old New England family, his paternal grandfather being Levi Chapman, who was a native of Vermont and was of Scotch lineage. The father, James M. Chapman, was born in Medina county, Ohio, February 3, 1818. He came to this state, however, at an early day, settling in Cass county in 1844, being the first resident in this part of the county, his nearest neighbor being two or three miles away. There in the midst of the forest he cleared and developed a farm, cutting away the trees before he could plow and cultivate the land. As the years passed he wrought a marked transformation in the appearance of the place, which became a well developed property, and he resided thereon until his death, which occurred when he was in the eighty-first year of his age. From the time of the organization of the Republican party he was one of its stanch supporters and took an active interest in its growth and success. His fellow townsmen frequently called him to office and he served as supervisor for a long period, perhaps about fourteen years in all. He was loyal to every trust reposed in him and his life was in entire harmony with his professions as a member of the Baptist church. He took a very helpful part in church work, contributed generously of his means to its support, assisted in the various church activities and was a deacon for many years. He wedded Miss Mary Haggerty, who lived to be seventy-four years of age. In their family were two sons, the elder being Harvey Chapman, who died at the age of two years.\n\nFranklin Chapman, the younger son and the only representative of the family now living, was reared upon the old farm homestead in Newberg township, where he yet resides. At the usual age he began attending the district schools and as his age and strength permitted he assisted more and more largely in the work of the farm during the summer months, aiding in the plowing, planting and harvesting. He was first married on the 1st of March, 1873, the lady of his choice being Miss Lovina Cleveland, who died leaving two children: Mrs. Lulu Van Stallen, who is now a widow; and Verna, who is the wife of Arthur Pound, of Newberg township. On the 20th of March, 1882, Mr. Chapman was again married, his second union being with Miss Minnie Williams, a daughter of A. H. and Julia A. (Marshall) Williams. Mrs. Chapman was born in Susquehanna county, Pennsylvania, and was brought to Michigan when about five years of age, the family taking up their abode in St. Joseph county. She was fourteen years of age when they came to Cass county. She pursued her education in Colon, Michigan, and in the Indiana Normal School at Valparaiso, Indiana, and for five years was successfully engaged in teaching in Cass county. She spent two years as a teacher in the Vandalia schools and was an able educator, imparting readily and impressively to others the knowledge that she had acquired. Unto Mr. and Mrs. Chapman have been born three children: Bion F., who is at home; Virginia, who is a graduate of the Dowagiac high school and of the Agricultural College and is now engaged in teaching; and Mildred J., the wife of Leonard R. Norton, a resident farmer of Newberg township.\n\nMr. Chapman is the owner of one hundred and sixty acres of arable land on section 17, Newberg township. His farm is divided into fields of convenient size by well kept fences and he has good improvements upon the place, including the latest improved machinery to facilitate the work of the fields. In his farm work he is practical, is systematic in his methods and is accomplishing good results through his unremitting diligence. He is now making a specialty of raising fine cattle of the St. Lambert and Jersey breeds. In his political views Mr. Chapman has always been a stanch and earnest Republican, identifying himself with the party when age conferred upon him the right of franchise. He has served as township treasurer for four years, proving a capable officer, but prefers to give his time and energies to his business affairs, in which he is meeting with signal success.\n\nTyped by Barbara O'Reagan\n\nH. SYLVESTER CHAPMAN\n\nCHAPMAN, HASTINGS\n\nH. Sylvester Chapman, owner of one hundred and thirty acres of as fine land as can be found in Cass county, resides on section 17, Penn township. He was born in Medina county, Ohio, December 5, 1839, and represents one of the old families of New England, his ancestors having been represented in this country through various generations. His great-grandfather was Benjamin Chapman, a native of Vermont. His grandfather, Levi Chapman, who was also born in the Green Mountain state, was a farmer by occupation and removed to Ohio with his family at an early date in the history of Medina county, where he took up his abode.\n\nAmory H. Chapman, his son, was born in Enosburg, Vermont, and was about five years of age at the time of his parents' removal to the Buckeye state. He was reared and educated in Medina county and was married there to Miss Lucinda Hastings, a native of New York and a daughter of Walter Hastings, who was likewise born in the Empire state. He was a lumber merchant who engaged in rafting lumber down the Susquehanna river to Baltimore. For three years after their marriage Mr. and Mrs. Amory H. Chapman lived in Ohio, and then came to Cass county, Michigan, in 1845, settling in Newberg township. Mr. Chapman took up the work of farming, tilling the soil which hitherto was uncultivated and unimproved. For many years he was an active factor in agricultural circles and his death occurred in Newberg township when he had attained the advanced age of eighty years. He was a man of good principles, who fearlessly espoused any cause in which he believed and he left to his family an untarnished name. When age gave to him the right of franchise he voted with the Whig party, which he supported until the organization of the Republican party. He was closely identified with the upbuilding of the county, settling in the midst of the forest upon his arrival here, making a clearing and in due course of time developing a good farm. He performed all the arduous labor incident to such a task, ed his energies upon agricultural pursuits. He began farming in Newberg township, where he remained until 1871, when he went to California, whence he returned by way of the water route and the Isthmus of Panama. On again reaching Cass county he purchased the farm upon which he now resides. In 1881 he went to North Dakota and improved a farm in Ransom county, spending the summer months there during four years. He still owns that property, comprising three hundred and twenty acres of land, and in his home place he has one hundred and thirty acres of very rich and productive land, no finer farm property being found in the county. In the World's Columbian Exposition in 1893 he exhibited six different varieties of his wheat grown on his farm, and was awarded a diploma and medal for the superiority of the cereal, which is an honor rare for old Cass county. He has erected a very attractive residence, which stands in the midst of a well kept lawn, and his barns and outbuildings are in keeping with ideas of modern agriculture. His fields, too, are well tilled and he is making a specialty of raising cattle, having a fine herd of thirty head of Jerseys, all being registered stock. He has never been a follower in business lines, but is a leader in the progress which results in successful accomplishment. He votes with the Democracy and is in sympathy with the platform promulgated at Kansas City.\n\nThe beautiful home of Mr. and Mrs. Chapman, known as \"Linden Lea,\" is beautifully finished in rare woods, and the entrance to the pretty home is artistically finished in sumach, showing the beautiful grains of the wood, while the library is finished in red cedar, and the work was accomplished by Mr. Chapman himself. In fact, the residence is finished in different woods.\n\nTyped by Barbara O'Reagan\n\nREV. WALTER CLARK\n\nCLARK, WEST, RICE, GOULD\n\nRev. Walter Clark is numbered among the capable agriculturists of Penn township, living on section 5 and for many years he has also devoted much of his time to the work of the ministry as a preacher of the Brethren church. His life record is indeed worthy of emulation, commanding for him the respect, confidence and good will of all. He was born in New York, September 23, 1837. His grandfather, Eli Clark, was a native of the Empire state and died in Ohio. His father, William L. Clark, was a native of New York and removed to Cass county, Michigan, about 1844, settling on section 4, Penn township, where he developed a tract of land hitherto wild and unimproved. He turned the first furrows upon various fields, planted his seed and in due course of time gathered good crops. After residing there for a number of years he removed to Bertrand township, Berrien county, Michigan, but afterward returned to Cass county and settled in Silver Creek Township. This was bout 1852, and in 1856 he removed to Penn township, where he resided until 1861. In that year he became a resident of Pipestone township, Berrien county; Michigan, where his remaining days were passed, his death occurring when he had reached the age of about seventy-eight years The wife of William L. Clark was in her maidenhood Miss Almira West, and she, too, was born in the Empire state, while her death occurred in September, 1860, when she was forty-six years of age. In their family were eight children, of whom Walter Clark is the eldest son and also the eldest now living.\n\nWhen about seven years of age, Walter Clark of this review removed with his parents to Cass county and here he has since lived with the exception of the brief intervals spent in Berrien county when a small boy. He returned to Cass county in 1856 and was married here in 1861 to Miss Maria Gould, who was born in the state of New York. They began their domestic life upon the farm where they yet reside and their marriage was blessed with one daughter, Almira, now the deceased wife of Samuel Rice. There was one daughter by this marriage, Verna Rice.\n\nRev. Clark has a farm of one hundred and fourteen acres situated on section 5, Penn township, and his land is productive, yielding good harvests annually. He has also added many modern improvements to his place and he uses good machinery in cultivating the fields and caring for the corps. He also has good grades of stock upon his farm and the property is the visible evidence of his well-directed labor and life of thrift. He cleared the land, erected a residence and barns and has fence the tract, first enclosing it with a rail fence made of rails which he himself split. Industry has been the dominant factor in his life and his Christian faith has been the keynote of his character. he has long been a member of the Brethren church, in which he has served as elder and minister and in the work of which he has taken a very active and helpful part, devoting about forty years to the work of the ministry, during which time he has exerted a wide and beneficial influence in behalf of the religious development of the community. He has also been instrumental in erecting three houses of worship in Cass county. in politics he is a stalwart Republican, casting his ballot for Abraham Lincoln in 1860 and again in 1864 and for each presidential candidate of the party since that time. He has been officially connected with the schools, and while serving as a member of the board of education has done all in his power to promote the cause of public instruction in his locality.\n\nTyped by Carol Foss\n\nJOHN R. COLLINS\n\nCOLLINS, PECK, DOKEY, JORDAN, CURTIS\n\nAmong the citizens of Mason township whose worth and fidelity to the general good are manifest in the faithful performance of public duties is numbered John R. Collins, who is now filling the office of township clerk. He resides on section 11, Mason township, and is one of the native sons of this locality, born on the 15th of July, 1853. His father, William Collins, was a native of Ohio, and came to Michigan with his father, John Collins, who took up their abode in Cass county in pioneer days, settling in Mason township in 1831. He found the district largely wild and unimproved. Much of the land was still in possession of the government, and he took up a claim of eighty acres on section 14. With characteristic energy he began the cultivation and development of a farm, and after clearing the land placed it under the plow. William Collins was a youth of twelve years at the time of the removal of the family from Ohio to Michigan, and was reared upon the old homestead on section 14, Mason township, where he early became familiar with the arduous task of developing new land. There were many hardships and trials to be borne in those days, for few roads had been laid out and many of the now thriving towns and villages had not yet sprung into existence, so that the settlers had to go long distances to market and mill. Much of the farm work was done by hand, and the machinery then in use was very crude and primitive. Having arrived at years of maturity William Collins was united in marriage in Wisconsin to Miss Marietta Peck, who was born in Connecticut, and was there reared to the age of fifteen years, a daughter of Reuben Peck. She then came to the west and at the time of their marriage Mr. and Mrs. William Collins located in Mason township, where they lived most of their lives. The father died on the 23rd of October, 1902, which was the seventy-fifth anniversary of his birth, and the mother passed away in 1867. Having lost his first wife, William Collins was again married, his second union being with Ellen Dokey. There were two sons of the former union: John R., of this review; and Fred W., who is living in Minnesota. By the second marriage there was a son and daughter, William and Sylvia. The former is now living in Minnesota but the latter died in childhood.\n\nJohn R. Collins was reared in Mason township and pursued his education in the district schools. He started out in life on his own account when fifteen years of age, working by the month as a farm hand in Mason township, being employed in that way for eight years. He was married on the 30th of July, 1873, to Miss Philoma Curtis, a daughter of Joseph A. and Deborah (Jordan) Curtis, a native of Mason township, where she has spent her entire life. Unto this marriage has been born one son, Nail J., who at the age of nineteen years is living at home, assisting in the operation of the farm.\n\nJohn R. Collins is a carpenter by trade, having learned the business when a youth. He followed that pursuit for a number of years, but now concentrates his energies upon his farming operations, and is the owner of a good tract of land of fifty-five acres, which he has brought under a high state of cultivation, so that he annually harvests good crops. In his political views he is a Democrat, and has for many years served as township clerk, elected the last time in April, 1905. He has taken an active interest in public affairs and does all in his power to promote the material, intellectual and moral progress of the community. Fraternally he is connected with the Gleaners, and religiously with the United Brethren church, in which he is one of the trustees. He takes a most active and helpful interest in its work and is an advocate of all that is right and just in man's relations with his fellowmen. In his own business career he has never taken advantage of the necessities of others in any transaction, and on the contrary has placed his dependence upon the safe and sure qualities of enterprise and unfaltering labor. Whatever prosperity he has enjoyed is due to his own persistent purpose and the course in life that he has pursued has gained for him the uniform respect and good will of his fellowmen.\n\nTyped by Linda Curry\n\nJUDGE C. E. CONE\n\nCONE, ROURK, KELLER, MERRITT, FORGUS, EVANS, DES VOIGNER, WARNER\n\nThe bench and bar have ever been a civilizing influence in the history of state and nation and Judge CONE is actively connected with a profession which has important bearing upon the progress and stable prosperity of any section or community and one which has long been considered as conserving the public welfare by furthering the ends of justice and maintaining individual rights. The present probate judge of Cass county is a gentleman whose superior educational attainments and understanding of the law have given him prominence in connection with his chosen profession and won him the position which he now fills trough appointment of Governor WARNER, who recognized his ability and merits. In his social and official relations he is well known in Cassopolis and Cass county. C. E. CONE has much to do with public interests in Cassopolis. He is director of the school board and has been a helpful factor in many movements for the general good. His business interests have been in the line of law practice and he is recognized as one of the most able attorneys of the county, possessing in large measure the qualities which contribute to success at the bar, including perseverance and an analytical mind, which is at the same time readily receptive and retentive of the fundamental principles and intricacies of the law.\n\nMr. CONE, the eldest of the family, was only about a year old at the time of his parents' removal from the Empire state to Michigan. He began his education in Elkhart and continued his studies in the schools of Goshen and of Bristol, Indiana. He engaged in teaching in village school at Bristol and for seven months in the district schools of the Hoosier state. Locating at Vandalia, he spent about fifteen months in a general store owned by W. R. MERRITT, after which he engaged in teaching for one year as assistant principal. During this year he studied and earned a first grade teacher's certificate and was elected principal the following year, which position he filled for four years. Under his guidance the schools made satisfactory progress, for he maintained a hight standard of excellence and put forth practical effort to improve the schools and worked for their permanent good. He attended the Agricultural College at Lansing, Michigan, where he studied chemistry, physics, geology and astronomy. Following this work he took the state teachers' examination and won a life certificate in 1891. He was elected county commissioner of schools in 1893 and came to Cassopolis. For eight years he occupied that position and the cause of education has ever found in him a stalwart friend, whose labors in its behalf have been effective and far reaching. In 1896 he began the study of law and was admitted to the bar in April 1899. Following the expiration of his term of office he entered at once upon the active practice of the law, opening an office in the Chapman building on the 8th of July, 1901. In his practice he is gifted with a spirit of devotion to wearisome details and is quick to comprehend the most subtle problems, while in his conclusions he is entirely logical. He is also fearless in the advocacy of nay cause he may espouse and few men have been more richly gifted for the achievement of success in the arduous and difficult profession of the law. He has twice been elected circuit court commissioner and is filling that position at the present time. On the election of Probate Judge L. B. DES VOIGNER to the circuit bench, Mr. CONE was appointed by Governor WARNER to fill the vacancy and entered upon the duties of the probate office September 7, 1906. He is also a member of the village council and has been found a co-operant factor in many movements and plans for the promotion of the best interests of Cassopolis.\n\nOn the 1st of December, 1886, Mr. CONE was united in marriage to Miss Grace FORGUS, a daughter of Wellington and Anna (EVANS) FORGUS and a native of New Jersey. Her father was a minister of the Episcopal church. Unto Mr. and Mrs. CONE have been born five children, the eldest, J. Gorton, being now eighteen years of age. The others are Grace, Muriel, Wellington and Esther. Mr. CONE is a prominent worker in Republican ranks and has been secretary of the Republican county central committee. He is secretary of Kingsbury Chapter No 78, R. A. M., and belong to a number of other fraternities.\n\nTyped by Caral MECHLING BENNETT\n\nABRAM CONKLIN\n\nCONKLIN, GILBERT, FLICKINGER, SMITH\n\nAbram Conklin, who after long and close connection with farming interests in Cass county is now living retired in Dowagiac, is one of the worthy citizens that the Empire state has furnished to southern Michigan. He was born in Otsego county, New York, August 18, 1845, and is the third son of Abram and Belinda (Gilbert) Conklin, of whom mention is made on another page of this work in connection with the sketch of Simeon Conklin. The subject of this review was but a small boy when he came to Cass county with his parents, and on the old homestead farm in Silver Creek township he was reared. He attended the Indian Lake school, thus acquiring a fair education, as he mastered the branches of learning there taught. He also spent one season as a student in Dowagiac. Through the summer months he assisted in the labors of the field and meadow and became familiar with the best methods of tilling the soil and caring for stock. He continued to give his father the benefit of his services until the time of his marriage which important event in his life occurred in 1878, the lady of his choice being Miss Nellie Flickinger, a daughter of Peter and Mary (Smith) Flickinger. Mrs. Conklin was born in Medina county, Ohio, and became a resident of this county when a young lady of about nineteen years, her parents locating on a farm in Silver Creek township. At the time of her marriage Mr. Conklin took her as a bride to a farm in the same township, and he was there afterward engaged in farming until 1900, when he put aside the work of the fields and took up his abode in Dowagiac, but still owns a good farm property, comprising one hundred and forty-eight acres of land, which is well improved, being supplied with good buildings and modern equipments. It is all under the plow with the exception of eight acres. He has improved this place and made it what it is today -- a valuable farm property -- Mr. Conklin personally clearing all of it with the exception of twenty acres.\n\nUnto our subject and his wife has been born a son, Lee A., who is attending business college at Battle Creek, Michigan, and who for two years was a student in the Conservatory of Music at Oberlin, Ohio. He also spent two years in the Musical Conservatory of Chicago, and has thus been provided with excellent privileges for the cultivation of his talent in the line of his art. Mr. Conklin has been a resident of Cass county for a half century, and his mind bears the impress of many of the historic events which have occurred here. He has always voted the Republic ticket, and is known as a man fearless in defense of his honest convictions, politically or otherwise. The family is a representative pioneer one of the county, and Mr. Conklin wears worthily the honored family name.\n\nTyped by Barbara O'Reagan\n\nE. S. CONKLIN\n\nCONKLIN, McQUEEN, CORNISH\n\nE. S. Conklin is the resident partner and manager of the Marcellus Milling Company, in which connection he is a prominent representative of industrial interests in the village of Marcellus. The qualities of a successful business man are his -- close application, unfaltering enterprise and indefatigable diligence. A native of Wisconsin, he was born in Waupaca on the 17th of May, 1863, his parents being Sidney H. and Mary I. (McQueen) Conklin, the former a native of Geauga county, Ohio, born near Akron, and the latter a native of Paisley, Scotland. The mother came to the United States when thirteen years of age with her parents, who landed near Waukegan, Illinois, and in Waupaca, Wisconsin, she gave her hand in marriage to Sidney Conklin. Both died at Neenah, Wisconsin, Mr. Conklin at the age of sixty-six years, and his wife when sixty-five years of age. He was a miller by trade and followed that pursuit throughout his entire business life. In the family were two children, the elder being Elmer, who died at the age of twenty-one years.\n\nE. S. Conklin spent the days of his boyhood and youth in his parents' home and when ten or twelve years of age accompanied them on their removal to Neenah, Wisconsin. When his education was completed he entered the milling business in connection with his father, who followed that pursuit for thirty-five years, and remained as his assistant until twenty years of age, when he removed to Green Bay, Wisconsin, where he was employed at milling by other parties. He took charge of the mill, which he managed for one and a half years, and on the expiration of that period he went to Ripon, Wisconsin, and was afterward in Berlin and Royalton, in the line of his trade, subsequent to which time he returned to Neenah, where he remained for five years. He next went to Antigo, Wisconsin, where he spent eight and a half years. He again located at Green Bay, where he took charge of the mills with which he had previously been connected when in that place before. Six years ago he purchased a half interest in the Marcellus Milling Company, the plant being owned jointly by the Colby Milling Company of Dowagiac, Michigan, and Mr. Conklin, who as resident partner and manager is in full control. He has the entire confidence of the community in which the mill is located, and to his careful management and enterprise the satisfactory business enjoyed by the company is due. He has had charge of thirteen different mills and has thus gained broad practical experience, which now enables him to give capable management to his individual interests. The equipment of the mill is unusually good for an establishment of this extent. The mill building, a substantial brick structure of three stories, with ten-foot basement and engine and boiler room, was erected in 1891, and has an Allis equipment throughout for a daily capacity of two hundred barrels of flour. The main building is forty by fifty feet in size, with an addition thirty-six by forty feet in size, for office and storage purposes. The mill has fire protection from a standpipe to the top of the mill, with hose on every floor, and connection with the village waterworks. It also is steam heated throughout. The company enjoys a steady flour trade, both locally and wholesale. Its brands are \"Alpine\" (full patent) and \"Royal\" (straight), while \"Colby Patent\" and \"Splendid\" for the larger bakeries are as well known as any flours in Michigan. Besides handling all kinds of grain, seeds, etc., the company sells annually quite an amount of hard and soft coal, with storage rooms for five hundred tons each, the sidings and warehouses occupying an advantageous location convenient for local trade and shipments.\n\nThe manager, Mr. Conklin, is very proud of his mill from every point of view. He particularly insists that the mill should be kept like a home, and he extends a welcome to callers and inspectors at any and all times. He is a practical miller in all details, and came into charge of this plant from the milling section of central and northern Wisconsin.\n\nOn the 24th of August, 1898, was celebrated the marriage of E. S. Conklin and Miss Katheryn Cornish, a native of Wisconsin. They now have two sons, Roscoe S. and Horace F. The parents are widely known in Marcellus and the hospitality of the best homes is freely accorded them. Mr. Conklin is a valued member of the Masonic fraternity, being identified with both the lodge and chapter, and in his life he is most loyal to its teachings and tenets. He has made a creditable business record as a man of ability and trustworthiness and is thoroughly conversant with his trade, and added to a complete command of the technical side of the business is an executive ability and keen insight into trade relations and possibilities.\n\nTyped by Barbara O'Reagan\n\nGILBERT CONKLIN\n\nCONKLIN, GILBERT, BEDFORD, SMITH\n\nGilbert Conklin, a prominent farmer living in Silver Creek township whose capable management of his business interests is indicated by the success that follows his efforts, was born in Otsego county, New York, March 17, 1839. He is the eldest child of Abram and Belinda (Gilbert) Conklin. The family is descended from three brothers, who came from England to America in early colonial days. The paternal grandfather, Simeon Conklin, was a native of New York, born in Otsego county. There he devoted his entire life to agricultural pursuits, spending his last days upon his farm.\n\nAbram Conklin, father of our subject, was born in Otsego county, and in 1851 came to Michigan, locating first upon a farm known as the Hess property in LaGrange township. The following year, however, he removed to Silver Creek township and took up his abode on the east shore of Indian lake, where he developed and improved a farm, giving his attention to its cultivation for many years thereafter. In fact he resided upon that property until his death, which occurred when he was in his seventy-sixth year. He married Miss Belinda Gilbert, a native of Herkimer county, New York, and a daughter of William B. Gilbert of the same county. He was of French descent. Mrs. Belinda Conklin died upon the home farm in Silver Creek township at the age of fifty-two years. There were eight children in the family, one of whom died in infancy. The others are: Gilbert, of this review; Simeon; Abram; Jane; George, who died at the age of fourteen; Charles; and Lydia.\n\nGilbert Conklin was reared in the county of his nativity and acquired his education there in the district schools. He came to Cass county, Michigan, with his parents and remained with them until his marriage, in the meantime assisting in the work of the fields and the development of a new farm. On the 13th of February, 1862, he was joined in wedlock to Miss Maria Bedford, a daughter of George and Ann (Smith) Bedford, both of whom were born in Lincolnshire, England. They spent their childhood there in that country, were married there and in 1835 crossed the Atlantic to America, locating near Syracuse, New York, where they remained for about six years. In 1841 they came to Michigan, settling in Silver Creek township, Cass county, where they spent their remaining days, both attaining an advanced age, the father passing away when he had reached the age of seventy-five years, while the mother's death occurred when she was seventy-four years of age. In their family were six daughters and two sons, of whom three died in infancy. Two of the number were born in New York, while the others were natives of Silver Creek township. There are four daughters and a son living. Mrs. Conklin, who was the third child and second daughter, was born in Silver Creek township, June 5, 1842, and has been a life-long resident of this part of the county. At the usual age she began her education in the district schools and afterward she engaged in teaching, which profession she followed successfully up to the time of her marriage. Mr. and Mrs. Conklin began their domestic life upon the farm where they now reside, living first in a small frame house which was practically nothing more than a little shanty twelve by twenty feet. As the years passed by, three children were added to the family: William G., who was born in 1863 and died in 1893 at the age of thirty years; Linda, who is an artist now living in Chicago, Illinois; and Dr. Alice I. Conklin, a practicing physician residing in Chicago.\n\nMr. Conklin has extensive and valuable landed interests in this county, his farm comprising three hundred and forty-eight acres of rich land which responds readily to the care and cultivation he bestows upon the fields, bringing forth rich and abundant harvests. He has long been recognized as an enterprising agriculturist of his community and he has a well improved farm, using good machinery to facilitate the work of the fields. He has been almost a life-long resident of the county, coming here in his boyhood days and his residence here now covers more than a half century, during which time he has witnessed the greater part of the development and improvement of this portion of the state. He has been a stanch champion of the cause of temperance and is an earnest prohibitionist, working eagerly for the success of his party. At one time he was supervisor of his township. He is a member of the Methodist Episcopal church and is district trustee. His life has been honorable, his actions manly and sincere, for at all times his conduct has been actuated by Christian principles and devotion to truth, justice and right.\n\nTyped by Barbara O'Reagan\n\nSIMEON CONKLIN\n\nCONKLIN, GILBERT, SWISHER\n\nDowagiac has among its inhabitants many men who in successful business careers have won the competence that now enables them to live retired. To this class belongs Simeon Conklin, who at one time was actively and successfully engaged in general farming in Cass county but is now living in a pleasant home in Dowagiac, surrounded by many of the comforts which go to make life worth living, having put aside further business cares. He was born in Otsego county, New York, February 15, 1841. His father, Abram Conklin, also a native of that county, was there reared and married and in an early day came westward to Michigan, where he invested in property, purchasing land in Lagrange township, where he lived for a short time. He afterward removed to Silver Creek township, where he died when seventy years of age. His wife, who bore the maiden name of Malinda Gilbert, was also born in Otsego county, New York, and lived to be about fifty years of age. In the family were eight children, three daughters and five sons, six of whom grew to manhood and womanhood. There are now living four sons and a daughter, namely: Gilbert, who is residing in Silver Creek township; Simeon, of this review; Abram, who makes his home in Dowagiac; Jane, also a resident of Silver Creek township; and Charles, living in Dowagiac.\n\nSimeon Conklin was the second of the eight children and was but a small boy when brought by his parents to Michigan, so that he was reared and educated in Silver Creek township, attending the Indian Lake school in his boyhood days. When not busy with his textbooks he remained at home, assisting in the work of the farm until he had passed his twenty-first birthday. He was married in 1869 to Miss Charlotte Swisher, a daughter of John and Melissa Swisher. Mrs. Conklin was born in Preble county, Ohio, and was but a small girl when brought to this county by her parents. Upon coming to this county they located in Pokagon township. During that time Mr. Conklin gave his attention and energies to the further cultivation of the fields which he brought under a high state of cultivation, so that he annually harvested good crops. He used the latest improved machinery and conducted his work along modern lines of agriculture until 1895, when he put aside business cares and took up his abode in Dowagiac. He still owns, however, his farm, comprising two hundred acres of good land, which he rents.\n\nUnto Mr. And Mrs. Conklin have been born four children but Myrtle and Cora are now deceased, while the other daughters, Lillie and Nora, are at home. Mr. Conklin has spent nearly his entire life in Cass county and has always voted the Republican ticket since age gave to him the right of franchise. He has a wide and favorable acquaintance and has been successful in a financial way. His friends are many and the number is constantly increasing as the circle of his acquaintance widens.\n\nTyped by Barbara O'Reagan\n\nALEXANDER COOPER\n\nCOOPER, JONES, GOTHOP, GARWOOD, BURDEN\n\nAlexander Cooper, living on section 9, Howard township, owns and operates a good farm and in his business management displays the qualities which eventually lead to success. A native of Ohio, he was born in Marion county on the 25th of December, 1829. The Cooper family was of English lineage. The grandfather, John Cooper, was a native of England and came to America with the British troops in 1776, but tradition has it that he deserted the British Army at the time of the battle of Bunker Hill. He constructed the first vessel that sailed on Lake Erie, being a ship carpenter by trade, and throughout his active business life he followed that pursuit. He went to Ohio at an early period in the development of that state, taking up his abode in Marion county, and was accompanied by his son, Benjamin Cooper, the father of our subject. They also came together to Cass county, Michigan, in 1832, and here John Cooper made the first blinds that were manufactured in the state of Michigan at Niles. They settled on a farm in Jefferson township, comprising two hundred acres of land, which was secured from the government. The father, Benjamin Cooper, was a farmer during much of his life, but in early manhood learned and followed the shoemaker's trade. He was born in the state of New York and was there reared, remaining in the east until after his marriage. He was a member of the state militia of New York and was called out during the war of 1812. When about twenty-two years of age he was joined in wedlock to Miss Clarinda Jones, also a native of the Empire state, where her girlhood days were passed. She was of Dutch descent.\n\nAs before stated, Benjamin Cooper went with his father, John Cooper, to Ohio, and together they came to Michigan in 1832. Having secured a tract of land of two hundred acres in Jefferson township, Cass county, Benjamin Cooper began to clear and cultivate this place, soon transforming the wild land into productive fields. As a pioneer settler he contributed in substantial measure to the progress and prosperity of the county, his labors being of direct and permanent good. By his first marriage he had twelve children, eight sons and four daughters, namely: John and Benjamin, both deceased; Horace; Alonzo, who has also passed away; Alexander; Daniel; Jefferson, Thomas, Cicero, Clarinda, Almira, Ann and Alvira, all deceased. The wife and mother died in Jefferson township at the age of forty-four years and for his second wife Benjamin Cooper chose Miss Nancy Gothop. There was one child by this marriage, Jeanette. In early life Benjamin Cooper gave his political allegiance to the Whig party and afterward became a stanch Democrat. He served as justice of the peace for many years and his decisions were fair and impartial, winning him \"golden opinions\" from the general public. He died at the age of ninety-three years and three months, honored and respected by all who knew him because of his activity and success in business life, his devotion to the general good and his effective labor for the benefit of his adopted county.\n\nAlexander Cooper was only about three years old when brought by his parents to Michigan and he remained under the parental roof until twenty-two years of age, aiding in the arduous task of developing and cultivating new land. After attaining his majority he removed to his present farm, which first comprised eighty acres. Of this he cultivated and cleared forty acres. He has since added twenty acres to the original tract and altogether has placed eighty acres under the plow, transforming it from the raw prairie into productive fields. His farm is now valuable, well equipped and rich harvests are annually gathered.\n\nAs a companion and helpmate for life's journey Mr. Cooper chose Miss Elizabeth Garwood, to whom he was married on the 7th of October, 1851. They are the parents of two sons, Z. S. and William A. Cooper, both born and reared on the old homestead farm in Howard township. Mrs. Cooper was born in Pokagon township May 12, 1830, and was a daughter of Joseph and Marietta Ann (Burden) Garwood. Her father was a native of Pennsylvania, where he was reared and educated, and at an early day he went to Ohio, whence he came to Cass county, Michigan, in 1829 settling on Pokagon prairie, where he secured three hundred acres of land from the government. Not a furrow had been turned nor an improvement made on the place, and with characteristic energy he began to till the virgin soil and cultivate the crops best adapted to the climate. His wife was a native of New Jersey, where she spent her girlhood. Mr. Garwood had conducted a grist mill in Ohio, but after coming to this state his entire attention was devoted to farming. In his family were nine children, five daughters and four sons, of whom seven are now deceased, Mrs. Cooper having been the eighth child and fifth daughter. Her parents were worthy and honored pioneer residents here and their names are deeply engraved on the minds of the early settlers of the county. Mr. Garwood gave his political allegiance to the Whig party until its dissolution and then became a stanch champion of Republican principles. He remained upon the old homestead farm throughout the period of his residence in Cass county and at the time of his death was the owner of six hundred acres of valuable land in addition to the home place. He passed away when about seventy-six years of age. Mrs. Cooper was educated in one of the old-time log school houses and like her husband is familiar with the history of Cass county from the period of its early development down to the present day, when all the evidences of later-day progress are seen.\n\nMr. Cooper has always voted with the Democracy and has held all the offices in the township save that of supervisor, being continuously in official service for about a quarter of a century. He is a member of the Free Baptist church at Pokagon. With one exception he is the oldest living settler in his township and he has a very wide acquaintance in the county, having lived here since early pioneer times and witnessed its entire growth and development. Like others he shared in the hardships and privations incident to the establishment of a home on the frontier, but as the years went by he was enabled to overcome all difficulties and obstacles in his path and while promoting his individuall success he also contributed to the general welfare by the active co-operation which he gave to al plans formulated for public progress. He can relate many interesting incidents of pioneer days and is indeed a worthy citizen and honored early settler of Cass county.\n\nTyped by Barbara O'Reagan\n\nHON. JOHN F. COULTER\n\nCOULTER, WILSON, DOUGLAS, WHITE, ROGERS, VARY\n\nIn this country, where no man is born to public office or to public honor or comes to either by inheritance, but where all men are equal before the law, where the race for distinction is over the road of public usefulness and is open to everyone who chooses to enter, it is a matter of just pride when honors and distinction have been won. Among the prominent and influential residents of Cass county is Hon. John F. Coulter, who has been a member of the state legislature in Michigan and has also aided in framing legislation in Kansas and Nebraska. A man of distinct and forceful individuality, he has left and is leaving the impress of his public spirit and work upon matters of general moment and his influence has been a beneficial factor on various occasions. He now resides on section 14, Howard township, his time and energies being given to general agricultural pursuits. His birth occurred in this township on the 15th of November, 1840. His father, James Coulter, was a native of Ohio, born near Cincinnati, and was reared in Clinton county, that state. He was married there in June, 1836, and the same year came with an ox team across the country to Cass county, Michigan, locating in Howard township. His father, John Coulter, was born in Ireland and had previously come to Michigan, making the journey in 1834, in which year he took up five hundred and sixty acres of land in Howard township. On his removal to Cass county, James Coulter settled upon the farm which his father had located and there continued to make his home until his death, which occurred in 1874. He first built a log house, in which all of his family, numbering eight children, were born. In 1855, however, he replaced this by a modern brick residence, which is still standing on the farm. He was active in public affairs and his efforts were always on the side of right, progress, reform and improvement. He was a stanch Republican after the organization of the party and held various township offices, being faithful and loyal in the discharge of the duties that thus devolved upon him. He married Miss Ann Wilson, a native of Clinton county, Ohio, and a daughter of the Rev. Amos Wilson, a minister of the Baptist church and a schoolmate of Henry Clay. They were Whigs together, stanchly supporting the principles of that party. Rev. Wilson was of Welsh and English lineage and displayed many of the sterling characteristics of the ancestry from which he was descended. His daughter, Mrs. Coulter, reached the advanced age of eighty-three years. In the family where eight children, of whom four reached manhood or womanhood. Mrs. Margaret White, the eldest, is now living on the old family homestead in Howard township. William H. makes his home in Cassopolis and is mentioned elsewhere in this work. Mrs. Sarah Douglas is living in Converse, Indiana.\n\nJohn F. Coulter of this review is the first living son. He was reared in Howard township and acquired his preliminary education in the district schools, after which he continued his study in the Niles high school. Subsequently he engaged in teaching through twelve winter terms in Jefferson and Howard townships, while in the summer months his time and labors were devoted to farming. He was married in April, 1864, to Miss Sarah U. Vary, a daughter of B. O. and Meriba (Rogers) Vary, who came to Cass county, Michigan, from New York in 1858. Mrs. Coulter was born in Chermung county, New York, April 23, 1842, and came to Michigan with her parents, since which time she has been a resident of this state.\n\nAt the time of their marriage the young couple located on a farm in Howard township, where Mr. Coulter and his brother William were engaged in general agricultural pursuits together. In March, 1874, however, John F. Coulter went to the west, locating in Fillmore county, Nebraska, where he remained for eight and a half years, during which time he was engaged in farming and stock raising. He afterward removed to Kansas, living in Wilson county for three and a half years, when he went to Edwards county, Kansas, and later to Logan county, that state. There he was engaged in dealing in horses and cattle and was also publisher of the Logan County Republican for over two years in connection with his other business interests. In 1898 he returned to Howard township, locating on the farm where he now resides on section 14 and, at the same time he still retains the ownership of property in Kansas. He has taken a very active and influential part in public affairs and his influence has been widely felt in behalf of the growth, development and success of the Republican party. In 1870 he was elected to the state legislature from the second district of Cass county and served during the term of 1870-71. In 1878 he was elected to the state senate for the counties of Clay and Fillmore in Nebraska and was on the building committee to build the first wing of the present capitol at Lincoln, that state. He was also elected representative from Wilson county, Kansas, in 1882, and in 1892 was chosen to represent Logan county, Kansas, in the state legislature, while in 1895 he was elected county commissioner of Logan county. He was chairman of the board, but resigned that office in order to return to Michigan. He has long been active in politics and his labors have been of a practical character that accomplishes results. At one time he was connected with the Knights of Pythias. He has been a popular factor on the political stage and his is a sturdy American character and a stalwart patriotism. He has the strongest attachment for free institutions and is ever willing to make a personal sacrifice for their preservation. He is a man of stern integrity and honesty of purpose and never uses unworthy or questionable means to secure success in any undertaking or for any purpose or to promote his own advancement in any direction whether political or otherwise.\n\nTyped by Barbara O'Reagan\n\nWILLIAM H. COULTER\n\nCOULTER, WILSON, DOUGLAS, ROGERS, VARY, SMITH\n\nWilliam H. Coulter, a grain dealer of Cassopolis, was born in Howard township, this county, on the 10th of October, 1842. He is a son of James Coulter and a grandson of John Coulter, the latter a native of Ireland, who served as a soldier in the Irish rebellion. He came to America in 1798, becoming the founder of the family in the new world, establishing his residence in Cincinatti, where he was married. At a later date he removed to Clinton county, Ohio, and in 1834 he came to Cass county, Michigan, locating over seven hundred acres of land in Howard township. The journey was made with an ox team and John Coulter cast in his lot with the pioneer residents of this part of the state. Few improvements had been made as yet, the greater part of the land being still in its primitive condition, while the forests were uncut, the streams unbridged and the sod unturned upon the prairies.\n\nJames Coulter, father of our subject, was born in Cincinatti, Ohio, and on coming to Cass county in 1835 located in Howard township. He was then a young man and he bore his full share in the work of early improvement and progress here. After two years he returned to his native state and was then married, after which he brought his bride back to Howard township, where he spent his remaining days, there developing and improving a good farm. He was an active supporter of the Republican party and held various local offices. His early political allegiance, however, was given to the Democracy, and he voted for Franklin Pierce, but in 1856 he cast his ballot for John C. Fremont, the first presidential candidate of the new Republican party. In the Methodist Episcopal church he was a very earnest and active worker and in Howard township he erected a house of worship, which is still standing. He died in his sixty-sixth year, and his loss was deeply regretted by many friends, for all with whom he had come in contact knew him to be a man of sterling integrity, of steadfast purpose and of unquestioned honor. He married Miss Ann Wilson, a native of Clinton county, Ohio, and a daughter of Amos Wilson, also of the same county. Her father was a Baptist minister and was of Welsh descent. Mrs. Coulter lived to be eighty-three years of age. In the family where seven children, all of whom were born in Howard township, Cass county, and of this number two sons and two daughters are yet living, namely: Margaret, the wife of Ephriam White, who is living upon the old Coulter homestead in Howard township: John, a prominent politician and farmer, who resides in the same township: William H. of this review: and Sarah A, the wife of James Douglas of Marion, Indiana.\n\nMr. Coulter is the sixth child and youngest son in the family. No event of special importance occurred to vary the routine of farm life for him in his youth. He was reared upon the old family homestead in Howard township and early became familiar with he best methods of tilling the soil and caring for the stock. He resided upon the farm until 1892, when he was elected sheriff of Cass county and the same year took up his abode in Cassopolis. Following the expiration of his term of service he made a trip to California, where he remained from January until April, enjoying the mild climate and the beauties of that sunny land. He then returned to his farm in Howard township, where he again lived for two years, when he once more took up his abode in Cassopolis. Here he turned his attention to the grain trade in a company with James Johnson, which partnership continued for a year, since which time Mrs. Coulter has had different partners. He is now associated with John Atkison under the firm style of Coulter & Atkison, grain shippers. He has done quite a large business and has thereby provided an excellent market for local producers. He deals in grain, produce and coal and has a large patronage, so that he makes extensive sales annually. He also owns a farm of one hundred and sixty-seven acres in Jefferson township, which is valuable and productive land and returns to him a good income.\n\nMr. Coulter was united in marriage on the 4th of January, 1866 to Miss Abigail Vary, a daughter of Benjamin and Mary (Rogers) Vary, who was born in Oneida county, New York, near Rome and came to Cass county in 1860 when she was twelve years of age. She died in 1893 during her husbands incumbency in the office of sheriff, and on the 3rd of January, 1895 Mr. Coulter was again married, his second union being with Addie Smith, a daughter of C. B. and Charlotte Smith. They have no children of their own but have adopted a daughter, Maria W. Mr. Coulter has ever manifested the interest of a public spirited citizen in all matters relating to the general welfare, and he exercises his right of franchise in support of the men and measures of the Republican party. He desires general advancement and improvement along lines of permanent good, and in his views relating to the public welfare he is practical as well as progressive. He holds membership in the Methodist Episcopal church, of which he is a trustee and in the work of which he takes and active and helpful part.\n\nTyped by Carol Foss\n\nH. A. CREGO\n\nCREGO, ARMS, STRANNAHAN, LYNCH, HINSHAW, GREEN, NEWTON\n\nH. A. Crego, known throughout Cass county as Squire Crego, has for thirty-six years been justice of the peace, and no stronger evidence could be given of capable service and impartial decisions than the fact that he has so long been retained in the office. He has lived in Cass county from an early day and now makes his home on section 29, Volinia township. Moreover he is entitled to representation in this volume as a native son of Michigan, his birth having occurred on the 2nd of August, 1840, in Lenawee county, at the junction of the Chicago and Monroe turnpikes. His parents were Rulef D. and Eliza (Arms) Crego. The father was born in the Mohawk valley of New York and there remained until about thirty years of age, when, believing that he might enjoy better business opportunities in the new but growing west, he made his way to Michigan, settling in Lenawee county. He had been married in New York. His first wife was Mary J. Strannahan and there were ten children born of that marriage. Following the death of the mother the father married again. His wife was a native of Conway, Franklin county, Massachusetts, and was there reared. She first married Ichabod Nelson, and it was subsequent to his death that she gave her hand in marriage to Rulef D. Crego. By this marriage there were born three children, of whom Squire Crego is the second. The other two, however, died in infancy, so that the subject of this review is the only surviving member of the entire family.\n\nWhen only two years old Squire Crego was brought to Cass county by his parents, the family locating in Newberg township, where he was reared in the usual manner of farm lads of that period and locality. He was educated in the district schools and shared with the family in the pioneer experiences incident to the establishment of a home on the frontier. The father died when the son was eighteen years of age and he and his mother remained in Newberg township for about four years thereafter, when Mrs. Crego also passed away. Squire Crego, however, continued to reside in the same township for some time thereafter, and was married there on the 14th of February, 1863, to Miss Mary Lunch, a daughter of George and Rebecca Lynch, who lived in Adamsville, New York, and came from the Empire state to Michigan. The birth of Mrs. Crego occurred in Adamsville, and at her death she left one son, Charles C. Crego, who is now a salesman in a department store in Washington. In 1869 Mr. Crego was married to a Miss Phebe Hinshaw, who died leaving one son, Frank R., now a resident of Volinia township. In 1897 occurred the marriage of Squire Crego and Mary Jane Newton, who was born upon the farm where she now resides January 1, 1853, her parents being George and Esther (Green) Newton, who came to this county in pioneer days, the father in 1831 and the mother in 1834. The name of Newton has since been associated with the history of progress and development here and has always stood as a synonym of good citizenship.\n\nSquire Crego has been a life-long farmer and is now following agricultural pursuits on section 29, Volinia township. He has voted with the Republican party since age gave to him the right of franchise, and has been honored with a number of local positions of public trust, having served as constable and as township clerk in Newberg township, as highway commissioner of Volinia township and as justice of the peace for about thirty-six years. His positions were strictly fair and impartial and have \"won golden opinions from all sorts of people.\" He belongs to the Methodist Protestant church and is a member of the Masonic lodge at Volinia and also the Knights of the Maccabees. He has been a resident of the county for sixty-four years and in 1905 was elected president of the Pioneers' Association.\n\nTyped by Barbara O'Reagan\n\nM. H. CRISWELL, M.D.\n\nCRISWELL, WALKER, SMITH, STOPHLET\n\nIt is contended by many that the practice of medicine is the most important work to which a man may direct his energies, and all accord the profession high rank. Not only must the successful physician possess broad and accurate knowledge concerning the great principles which underlie the medical and surgical science, but he must also possess a broad humanitarian spirit, a ready sympathy and a cheerful nature which inspires hope and courage and proves a valued supplement to his technical knowledge. In these qualities Dr. Criswell of Cassopolis is well equipped. A native of Knox county, Ohio, he was born on the 10th of August, 18963, his parents being Benjamin F. and Mary E. (Walker) Criswell, the former a native of Stark county, Ohio, and the latter of Fredericktown, Knox county. The father was a merchant tailor by trade and devoted his life to that occupation, passing away at Akron, Ohio, when seventy-one years of age. He was of Scotch lineage. His wife died when only forty-one years of age. In their family were six children, of whom one died in infancy.\n\nDr. Criswell is the youngest of the surviving members of the family and his youth was passed in Canton, Ohio, where he acquired his literary education as a public school student. He began the study of medicine under the direction of Dr. A.V. Smith at Canton and subsequently spent one term as a student in a medical college. He afterward devoted three years to the business of traveling salesman, and in 1887 he resumed his medical studies and was graduated from the Homeopathic College in Chicago with the class of 1891. He then located for practice in Edwardsburg, Michigan, where he remained for about nine years when he removed to Cassopolis in 1900. Here he has since been located and his business has reached gratifying proportions, as he has demonstrated his ability to cope with the intricate problems which continually confront the physician in his efforts to check the ravages of disease and restore health. He is a member of the Northern Indiana and Southern Michigan Medical Associations and also the American Medical Association, and through the reports of those bodies he keeps in touch with what is being done in the line of medical and surgical practice. He is quick to adopt any new method or idea which he believes will prove of practical benefit in his work and at the same time he is slow to discard the old and time-tried methods whose value has bene proven.\n\nIn 1891 occurred the marriage of Dr. Criswell and Miss Kate Stophlet, a daughter of David Stophlet. In social circles they occupy an enviable position, the hospitality of the best homes of Cassopolis and vicinity being extended them. Dr. Criswell is a member of the Masonic fraternity, the Knights of the Maccabees, of the Modern Woodmen of American and he gives his political support to those men who are pledged to support the principles of the Republican party. For fourteen years he has practiced in Michigan with constantly growing success, and in Cass county is accorded a position of prominence among the representatives of his chosen profession.\n\nTyped by Jana Mooney\n\nNELSON J.

Crosby, one of the widely known citizens of Cass county, who has figured quite prominently in political affairs and is now engaged in dealing in horses in Cassopolis and is also a well known real estate agent, was born in Lenawee county, Michigan, on the 3rd of February, 1847, and is descended from Irish ancestry. The family, however, was founded in America at an early day, the grandfather, William Crosby, having been a native of New York. The father, Asaph Crosby, was also born in that state and settled in Lenawee county in 1835, becoming one of its pioneer residents. He was a farmer by occupation, devoting his entire life to that pursuit, and on his removal to Cass county in 1856 he located upon a farm in Penn township, which he greatly improved, bringing it under a high state of cultivation and transforming it into a valuable tract. He lived a life of well-directed energy and unfaltering enterprise. In early manhood he wedded Julia Holmes, who was a native of New York and was also of Irish descent. She died in 1852 in Lenawee county and Mr. Crosby survived for twenty years, passing away in Cass county in 1872 when more than sixty-six years of age.\n\nNelson J. Crosby was the sixth in order of birth in a family of eight children, five sons and three daughters, all of whom reached manhood or womanhood. He was about nine years of age at the time of the removal of his father to Cass county, and upon the old family homestead in Penn township he spent the days of his boyhood and youth, acquiring his education in the schools of Vandalia. He has largely been dependent upon his own resources from the age of seven years. He was only five years old at the time of his mothers death, and about two years later he began working, since which time he has provided largely for his own support, doing any labor for which his age and strength permitted him upon the farms of the neighborhood. Thinking that he would find other occupation more congenial, when eighteen years of age he began learning the coopers trade, serving an apprenticeship of one year, during which time he received only his board in compensation for his services. He afterward worked for a year as a journeyman and then purchased the shop in which he had learned the trade, thus becoming a factor in the business life of Vandalia. He carried on the business there for about twelve years, meeting with good success, after which he disposed of the shop and resumed farming operations, becoming an agriculturist of Penn township, where he engaged in tilling the soil for seven years. On the expiration of that period he removed to Cassopolis and was appointed undersheriff under Sheriff MacIntosh, occupying that position for four years, at the end of which time he was elected the village marshal and served for two years. He then again became undersheriff under Sheriff W. H. Coulter and after two years was elected the sheriff in 1896, filling the office for one term. His previous experience as undersheriff had well qualified him for the position, the duties of which he discharged with promptness and fidelity. Since his retirement from office he has been engaged in dealing in horses and has also engaged in real estate operations, handling considerable valuable property.\n\nIn June, 1872, Mr. Crosby was united in marriage to Miss Mary Snyder, a daughter of Peter Snyder. He has been a stanch Republican and served as constable in Penn township for a number of years in addition to the offices previously mentioned. His fraternal relations are with the Odd Fellows and the Masons. He has taken the degrees of the lodge, chapter and commandery, in which he has filled some of the offices, and he is also a member of the Mystic Shrine, having crossed the sands of the desert with the nobles of that ancient Arabic order. Through much of his life he has resided in Cass county, being identified with its interest and giving helpful co-operation to many movements that have been of direct and permanent good to the community.\n\nTyped by Carol Foss\n\nJOSEPH Q. CURRY\n\nCURRY, GARD, HIGH\n\nJoseph Q. Curry is one of the native sons of Michigan, who has found in this state ample opportunity for the exercise of his native talents and has become fully cognizant of the fact that in Michigan earnest labor brings a sure and just reward, for through his close application and earnest efforts he has become one of the substantial residents of Cass county. He now makes his home in Marcellus and was born in Decatur township, Van Buren county, October 6, 1834, living retired after many years of active, successful and honorable connection with agricultural interests. He is a son of David Curry, who was born in Pennsylvania in December, 1807. The family removed to the vicinity of Columbus, Ohio, on leaving Pennsylvania, and about 1829 David Curry came to Michigan with the family, who were journeying to this state. He afterward returned to Ohio, however, and with his brother John again made the trip to Michigan in 1830. He worked for one year for Josephus Gard and was then married and entered upon an independent business career. It was in the year 1832 that he entered from the government his farm in Decatur township, Van Buren county. The land which came into his possession was entirely wild and unimproved and all around him stretched the native forest and uncultivated tracts of land. For fourteen years he devoted his time and energies to the subjugation of the wilderness and to the development of his farm, and was then killed by being thrown from a load of straw in the year 1846, leaving an estate of two hundred and forty acres of land. He was employed in Valencia township, Cass county, when he first came to Michigan, but the first and only home he ever earned was on section 34, Decatur township, Van Buren county. He had the finest cabin on the prairie at that time, it being eighteen by twenty feet, and it was the only one containing a sawed wood floor. There were no windows nor doors nor floor, however, when they moved into it. The Indians were frequent visitors and Joseph Q. Curry remembers well the calls that the red men paid at that pioneer home. The father was a prominent and honored pioneer resident in the epochal events which form the early history of his section of the state. He served in the Indian wars against the members of the Sac tribe and in recognition of the military aid which he rendered received a land grant. He married Miss Elizabeth Gard, who was born in Union township, Union county, Indiana, on Christmas day of 1811. She long survived her husband and passed away in Van Buren county, Michigan, in 1878. She was a daughter of Josephus and Sarah Gard. The former entered from the government a farm now owned by Mr. Curry, and he bought three quarter-sections of land. The homestead property of our subject comprises a quarter-section which was inherited by Mrs. Elizabeth Curry, who was one of the esteemed pioneer women of this section of the state. By her marriage she became the mother of nine children: Jonathan, who was born May 8, 1833, and died in the Indian Territory January 4, 1905; Joseph Q., of this review; Juliet, who was born April 5, 1836, and passed away in 1880; Marshall, who was born October 24, 1837, and has departed this life; David Q., who was born September 25, 1839, and died on the old home farm March 28, 1906; Elizabeth, who was born March 27, 1841, and is acting as housekeeper for her brother Joseph; Mary Jane, who was born February 20, 1843, and was the only one of the family that married, becoming the wife of Jacob High, of Park township, St. Joseph county, Michigan; Nancy H., who was born March 26, 1844, and died at the age of three years; and John B., who was born November 6, 1845, and passed away January 2, 1865. Of this family David served as a soldier of the Civil war from 1861 until 1865, as a member of the Fourth Michigan Cavalry. He was one of three hundred men who captured Jefferson Davis, and he retained as a souvenir of that expedition the saddle bags taken from general Regan, who was a member of Davis' cabinet. These saddle bags are now in possession of Joseph Q. Curry.\n\nJoseph Q. Curry, whose name introduces this review, remained upon the farm upon which he was born until sixty-two years of age and assisted in its development and cultivation as the years went by. He was early trained to the work of the fields and meadow and became a man of energy and industry, whose success is attributable to his own persistent efforts and capable business management. In 1896 he removed to the farm which he now owns, and has made it his home for the past decade. It comprises one hundred and sixty acres of land on section 21, Marcellus township, and was entered from the government by his grandfather, Josephus Gard, since which time it has been continuously in possession of the family. The land had been cleared and good buildings had been erected by Mr. Curry and his brother Jonathan. This is indeed a fine farm, being perhaps the best in the township, and eighty acres of the land lies within the corporation limits of Marcellus, a half mile from the center of the village. He also owns two hundred and eighty acres of land in Decatur township and eighty acres in Park township, together with fifty-six acres near Cassopolis. Throughout his entire life Mr. Curry has devoted his energies to general farming and stock-raising and has become widely known as a breeder of trotting horses. He now has a team that has a record of 2:25, both animals being raised on the home farm. This is the fastest team in the township and Mr. Curry may well be proud of these travelers. He is a representative business man, ever watchful of opportunities, and in all his business relations he has been found reliable and straightforward. He has traveled quite extensively in the middle west, as has his brother. All of the family are advocates of the Democracy and Jonathan Curry has held a number of township offices, the duties of which he has discharged with promptness and fidelity. Mr. Curry is a worthy representative of a pioneer family, one that has been associated with Michigan's history from an early period in territorial days. He lived here at the time most of the homes were log cabins and these were widely scattered. Comparatively few roads had been made through the forests, the land being still covered with the native timber. The streams were unbridged and it seemed that the work of improvement had scarcely been begun. The Curry family have always borne their full share in the development of the agricultural interests of this section of Michigan and deserve much credit for what they have accomplished.\n\nTyped by Barbara O'Reagan\n\nSOLOMON CURTIS\n\nCURTIS, THORN, WILSON\n\nSolomon Curtis, who has reached the age of four score years, is one of the pioneer settlers of Cass county. No writer has ever given adequate description of the conditions which are met on the frontier. When one faces the elements of nature in their rude and rough outlines they are removed from the comforts of an older civilization. This Mr. Curtis has done and his labors have been a valued factor in reclaiming this district for cultivation and improvement. He was born in the town of Springfield, Otsego county, New York, January 26, 1826. His father, Stephen Curtis, was a native of the Empire state and died when his son Solomon was but thirteen years of age. The mother, Mrs. Edna (Thorn) Curtis, was also a native of New York and died when the subject of this review was only two weeks old. The father was three times married and had a family of twelve children. By the first union there were nine children, by the second two and by the third marriage one child, the mother of our subject being the second wife. The daughter of that marriage died in early childhood.\n\nFollowing the death of his father Solomon Curtis came to Michigan, making his way to Cass county in 1839 in company with one of his half brothers. He located in Pokagon township, living with his brother until about eighteen years of age, when he continued his education in the schools of Niles and also attended the seminary at Albion, Michigan. He worked by the month in the summer seasons and carefully saving his earnings he was at length enabled to purchase a tract of land in Rockford township, Eaton county, Michigan. He afterward traded that property for some land in Berrien township, Berrien county, Michigan, which he eventually sold but bought another farm in the same township on the Cass county line, where he lived for twelve years. In his farm work he was determined and energetic, carrying forward to successful completion whatever he undertook. He was practical in his methods, yet progressive in all that he did and as the years passed by he converted his places into well developed and highly improved farms.\n\nMr. Curtis was married in 1851 to Miss Louisa W. Wilson, a daughter of Samuel Wilson, of Oronoke township, Berrien county. Mrs. Curtis was born in New York but was reared in Massachusetts and her death occurred in this state, November 27, 1900. There were three children of that marriage, all of whom died in early life.\n\nAfter living for twelve years upon his second farm in Berrien county Mr. Curtis sold that property and bought a farm in Silver Creek township, Cass county, whereon he lived for three years. He then again disposed of his farm and at that time bought land in Penn township, Cass county, where he lived for nineteen years. After disposing of that property to a purchaser he removed to Dowagiac in 1885 and for twenty-one years has resided in this city. He is one of the oldest settlers of Cass county and has been identified closely with its growth and development. He has seen the county emerge from the period of its infancy to that of latter day progress and civilization. That he located here at an early day is indicated by the fact that he paid only five dollars per acre for ninety acres of land, which is today worth at least fifty dollars per acre. He is well known throughout the county, having taken an active interest in public affairs and in all that pertains to the welfare and progress of his community. He voted for General John C. Fremont and for Abraham Lincoln both times, also for Garfield, and was a stalwart Republican from the organization of the party until 1884. His first presidential ballot, however, was cast for Zachary Taylor. In 1884 Mr. Curtis severed his allegiance with the Republican party, and joined the ranks of the Prohibition party. He has since cast his ballot for its presidential candidates, while at local elections he votes independently. He was a candidate for justice of the peace on the Prohibition ticket. He has been a member of the Methodist Episcopal church for sixty years and has been deeply interested in church work in its various departments. His life has ever been honorable and upright, characterized by fidelity to all that tends to elevate mankind and to promote his moral nature. He has been a champion of temperance and of Christianity and now in the evening of his life he can look back over the past without regret and forward to the future without fear. He is respected by all who know him because of his fidelity to the right and by reason of his honorable character and long residence in this county we take pleasure in presenting the record of his career to our readers.\n\nTyped by Barbara O'Reagan\n\nDEXTER CUSHING\n\nCUSHING, DEWEY, SAMMONDS, GILBERT, TROWBRIDGE\n\nDexter Cushing was numbered among the old settlers of Cass county who aided in making it what it is today. His strenuous labor and progressive spirit contributed to the result that has been accomplished in the way of general improvement and progress. He resided on section 19, Silver Creek township. He was born in Oneida county, New York, near the town of Deerfield, April 17, 1828. His father, James H. Cushing, was a native of Massachusetts, in which state he spent his boyhood and youth. His father, Mathew Cushing, is supposed to have been a native of England and at all events it is known that the family was established in America in early colonial days. The mother of our subject bore the maiden name of Amy Dewey. She was born in Massachusetts and was of Scotch-English lineage. In New York she gave her hand in marriage to James H. Cushing and they resided for some time in Oneida county or until 1851, when they came to Michigan, making their way direct to Cass county. They then settled in Silver Creek township, where Mr. Cushing purchased a farm upon which few improvements had been made. He began the further development of this place and continued to carry on agricultural pursuits here with excellent success, transforming his property into a well-developed farm, upon which he lived until called to his final rest in his seventy-fifth year. His wife was in her eighty-ninth year when she passed away. Their family numbered ten children, five sons and five daughters, all of whom reached manhood or womanhood with one exception. Three of the sons are yet living at the time of this writing, namely: George, who makes his home in Dowagiac; David, who is living in Silver Creek township; and Dexter.\n\nIn taking up the personal history of Dexter Cushing we present to our readers the life record of one who was widely and favorably known in this community. He was the third son and sixth child in his father's family and was reared in Oneida county, New York, to the age of nine years, when his parents removed to Oswego county, that state, there residing until 1852, when they came to Cass county, Michigan, and Mr. Cushing of this review took up his abode in Silver Creek township. He was then about twenty-four years of age and he remained with his father, assisting him in the work of the home farm until he married and established a home of his own.\n\nIt was on the 31st of January, 1856, that Mr. Cushing was united in marriage to Miss Jane Gilbert, a daughter of William B. and Cynthia (Sammonds) Gilbert, who came to Cass county in 1838 and were therefore among the early settlers. They located in Silver Creek township, establishing a home in the midst of the wilderness and sharing with other frontier settlers in the various hardships and trials which go to make up the life of the pioneer. Mrs. Cushing was born in Otsego county, New York, at the family home in the town of Springfield on the 23rd of September, 1835, and was therefore a little maiden of three summers when she was brought to Michigan by her parents. She was reared under the parental roof with a family that numbered three sons and three daughters and she was trained to the duties of the household, so that she was well-qualified to take charge of a home of her own at the time of marriage. Her education was obtained in the district schools. After their marriage the young couple located on a farm on section 20, Silver Creek township, their first home being a little frame house eighteen by twenty-two feet. It soon won a wide reputation for its generous, cordial and warm-hearted hospitality and there were always visitors there. They lived in this house for about twelve years and during that time Mr. Cushing cleared and developed one hundred and twenty acres of land which was all covered with heavy timber when he took possession of that place. In the forest, however, he developed the fields and the sunlight soon shone down upon the plowed land and ripened the harvests. Later Mr. Cushing removed from his original place to the present home not far from the old homestead. He lived in the county for about fifty-five years altogether and always gave his time and energies to general agricultural pursuits. He was also engaged in the stock business, buying, selling and shipping stock for about thirty years and finding this a profitable source of income. At the time of his death he owned two hundred acres of land situated on sections 19 and 20, and the farm is a valuable and productive one, indicating in its well-improved appearance the careful supervision, practical methods and unfaltering energy of the owner.\n\nUnto Mr. and Mrs. Cushing were born two children: William G., who is a merchant at Cushing Corners in this county; and Jennie, the wife of Wallace Trowbridge, a resident farmer of Silver Creek township. Mr. Cushing always voted with the Democracy after the organization of the party and believed that its principles contained the best elements of good government. He belonged to the Methodist Episcopal church of Silver Creek township, contributed generously to its support, took an active part in its work and did all in his power to advance the various church activities. He passed the seventy-eighth milestone on life's journey and his was a useful and active life that won for him the unqualified regard and confidence of his neighbors and friends. He could look back to the time when this county was largely unimproved. The uncut forests showed that the white man had scarecely penetrated into the interior, for only here and there was to be seen smoke rising from a little cabin to show that a home had been established in the midst of the wilderness. Many conditions of life were very crude as compared with those of the present day and much of the farm work was done by hand. The people depended upon what they raised for the comforts of life and much of the clothing was not only made at home but was spun and woven by hand. There has been a great transformation in the methods of farming and as the years passed by Mr. Cushing kept abreast with the progress along agricultural lines. On the occasion of his death the following lines appeared in one of the local papers:\n\n\"Dexter Cushing, a pioneer of Cass county, died at his home in Silver Creek last Saturday, September 8, and funeral services were held Monday, conducted by Peninsular Lodge F. & A. M. of Dowagiac, of which he was one of the oldest members.\n\n\"Mr. Cushing was the son of James Cushing, and was seventy-eight years of age. He was both a county and township pioneer, having spent almost his entire life as a tiller of the soil in Silver Creek.\n\n\"He is survived by a wife and two children. The latter are Will Cushing, storekeeper at Cushing Corners, and Mrs. Wallace Trowbridge of Indian Lake. One brother, George, of Dowagiac, also survives him. Another brother, Dave, died last spring.\n\n\"Mr. and Mrs. Cushing early this year celebrated the fiftieth anniversary of their wedding.\"\n\nTyped by Darwina Michael"
