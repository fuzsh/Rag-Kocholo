        "text": "What does it cost to install a typical commercial-grade, Network Enabled dual port Level 2 charging station?\n\nThe cost to install a charging station can vary considerably depending on a customer’s site layout and existing electrical infrastructure. Here is a sample cost, for demonstration purposes only, of installing a pedestal mounted, dual port Level 2 charging station (~7 kW x 2) with typically preferred site work, software and support:\n\nItemized Estimate Example*\n\nNet Project Cost Example\n\n** Rebate amounts are less than $3,000 because CMLP + MassEVIP rebates cannot exceed total eligible costs.\n\n*Estimate for demonstration purposes only; project costs vary from site to site\n\nDo I apply for the MassEVIP or CMLP rebate first?\n\nCMLP recommends that customers apply for CMLP’s rebate first, so that they can report the most accurate CMLP rebate amount to MassEVIP. Customers may apply for CMLP’s rebate and the MassEVIP grant simultaneously. All applicants risk a possible reduction of CMLP’s rebate amount upon reconciliation to ensure that the awarded sum, combined with the MassEVIP grant, does not exceed the total eligible project cost.\n\nI’m a small commercial customer who doesn’t need and can’t afford a commercial grade charging station. Can I get a rebate for installing a residential grade charging station on my commercial property?\n\nContact the Commercial EV Program Specialist Service here or by calling 833-443-8363 to discuss your project to see what incentives it may qualify for.\n\nWhy is the rebate lower for private charging stations versus public charging stations?\n\nThe rebate offered is lower for private stations because the owner can exclude the public from using the station, thereby offering less overall benefit. MassEVIP provides a 60% rebate for private stations instead of 80%, which is a 25% reduction. CMLP follows suit by reducing its public charging rebate amount by 25% (i.e. the private station rebate is 75% of the public station rate.)\n\nIf the charging station owner determines what to charge users of the charging stations, why must CMLP approve the owner’s pricing policy, usage accessibility and compliance enforcement plan?\n\nThe purpose of agreed-upon pricing and usage policies is to minimize peak demand, thus keeping costs down for charging station owners and users. The purpose of collecting data is to conduct research on collective EV charging patterns and their effect on the CMLP distribution system. By studying this information and incentivizing certain pricing policies for charging, CMLP seeks to refine the G-4 General Service - Electric Vehicle Charging demand fee and volumetric rates, avoid adverse economic impacts during New England peak period events, prevent overloading and damage to CMLP’s distribution equipment during local peaks while capturing the benefits that increasing EV charging and usage offers.\n\nIf my rebate is more than $750 and I prefer to receive a check from the Town rather than a credit on my electric bill, how do I request a check?\n\nThe Commercial EV Charging Rebate Payment Request Form provides an option to request a check. Note that commercial customers requesting a check must upload a copy of their company’s IRS W-9 form with their rebate payment request, and will get a 1099 from Town for the relevant tax year if required by tax code. If a customer’s account is not in good standing, CMLP reserves the right to provide a rebate fully or partially as a bill credit rather than as a check.\n\nHow does the G-4 General Service Electric Charging Tariff compare to what I’m paying for electricity for other uses?\n\nThe rate you pay for electricity for non-charging uses depends on whether you are a Small, Medium or Large General Service customer. The table below displays the rates for each of those categories, as well as for the General Service Electric Vehicle Charging Rate. Look for the meter charge on your electric bill if you are unsure which rate category applies to you for uses other than vehicle charging.\n\nWe are not sure what EV charging station equipment options are available that would meet our needs. Can CMLP advise us?\n\nYes, CMLP’s EV Specialist Team can help you evaluate your EV charging station equipment needs, installation and administrative challenges, understand product options, and understand the steps to procure equipment and installation services. The EV Specialist Team is funded by CMLP, is offered at no cost to you, and provides objective advice that is technology agnostic and brand neutral. You can reach our EV Specialists by requesting a consultation here or by calling 833-443-8363.\n\nWhom can I contact if I have questions about the Commercial EV Charging Station Rebate Program?\n\nContact Jan Aceti, CMLP’s Energy Efficiency & Electrification Coordinator, at jaceti@concordma.gov or 978-318-3151.\n\nThere are two incentive categories that make up CMLP’s rebate. The Charging Equipment Incentive helps pay for the hardware. The Installation Incentive helps pay for the labor needed to install the hardware. Each incentive type has a dollar limit. The sum of payments under the two incentives make up the total rebate amount.\n\nThe rebate amount differs based on who will be allowed to use the charging station(s.) Public charging stations are for use by the general public. Examples include commercial parking areas that may be used by restaurant or retail store customers. To be eligible for the public charging station rebate, stations must be accessible to the general public 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.\n\nPrivate charging stations are for use by employees, residents, customers, students, or for charging fleet vehicles. Examples include charging stations at commercially owned employee parking spaces, at parking spaces for residents of multi-dwelling unit properties, or charging stations for hotel guests or commercial fleet vehicles. These stations may or may not be publicly accessible, according to the owner’s discretion. For example, a commercial property owner may install charging primarily for use by its commercial tenants, and also may decide that on certain days or during certain hours, the station is also accessible to the public. This can help ensure the station gets increased usage while still allowing the station owner to retain control over the accessibility of the station in a way that best serves their needs.\n\nRebate Amount for Charging StationsIncentive TypePublic Charging StationsPrivate Charging StationsCharging Equipment Incentive\n\nThe charging station must be Level 2 (208 to 240 volt), dual port (or two single port), 13 amp or above per port, commercial-grade and be Network Enabled** The incentive covers the EVSE console, cable and connector, cable management, mounting (either pedestal or wall), separate payment module and shipping/freight.\n\nUp to $3,000Up to $2,250Installation Incentive\n\nIncludes electrical make ready and branch wiring; labor to bring station to code; electrical materials: conduit / fittings / wire / electrical equipment; site work; signage and painting.\n\nUp to $3,000Up to $2,250\n\n**Network Enabled means the charging station has the capability to connect to the Internet and/or private network and be able to transmit and receive information.\n\nThe CMLP awarded sum, combined with the MassEVIP grant, must not exceed the total eligible project costs. The CMLP award will equal the lesser of the following two amounts:\n\neligible charging equipment costs up to $3,000 per public station/$2,250 per private station plus eligible installation costs up to $3,000 per public station/$2,250 per private station, or\n\nthe total eligible project cost less the MassEVIP grant amount.\n\nEnergy Audits and Weatherization\n\nCMLP encourages you to to identify and implement measures that will prepare your building for a heating system upgrade, such as sealing and insulating your ductwork and/or building. A tight, well-insulated building optimizes heat pump performance, and may allow for a smaller heat pump to be installed, saving you money upfront and on your monthly utility bills. CMLP-sponsored energy audits can help you identify appropriate, cost-effective improvements.\n\nLicense Requirements\n\nEquipment must be installed by a licensed contractor, unless completed by in-house licensed tradespeople.\n\nHeat pump installations completed by in-house licensed tradespeople are eligible for rebates under the following conditions:\n\nA licensed electrician obtains an electrical permit and does the wiring. The installation must pass an electrical inspection.\n\nIf the project involves sheet metal work beyond minor repairs, a tradesperson qualified to obtain a sheet metal permit must do so. The sheet metal work must pass a building department inspection.\n\nWhen applicable, refrigerant lines must be charged, sealed, and tested by a licensed professional to adhere to EPA regulations (some self-install systems are pre-charged and pre-sealed). If an existing HVAC system is being decommissioned, existing refrigerant must be properly recaptured.\n\nThe rebate cannot exceed the cost of the project, which is documented by invoices and/or receipts. Therefore, in-house labor would not count towards the cost of the project.\n\nTown Building Department Permit and Inspection Requirements\n\nElectrical Permits and Inspections\n\nThe project electrician must apply for a Town electrical permit before work begins and schedule an electrical inspection after the work is done. CMLP will not award rebates until projects have passed an electrical inspection by Concord's Building Department.\n\nConcord has online permitting, so the electrician does not have to go into the Building Department office in person to obtain a permit. The electrician can upload their liability insurance certificate and license and can pay online.\n\nElectrical inspections are done on weekdays and can usually be completed within 5 to 7 days of the request. The building owner cannot schedule the inspection. The electrician schedules it by calling the Electrical Inspector at 978-318-3235 between 7am and 9am Monday through Friday with the permit number and the desired inspection date and time. Messages left for the Electrical Inspector after 9am will be returned the next morning.\n\nSheet Metal Permits and Inspections\n\nIf the project requires sheet metal ducting work that goes beyond minor repairs, a sheet metal permit must be obtained for the project. Examples of projects that require a sheet metal permit include installation of new ducting or replacement, significant repairs or changes to existing ducting. The Town of Concord's inspector must have inspected and approved the sheet metal work.\n\nThe process for getting sheet metal permits follows the same process as getting an electrical permit. The permit holder, typically the sheet metal contractor, must call the Building Dept. to schedule sheet metal inspections at (978) 318-3280. The Building Department's hours are here.\n\nElectrical and sheet metal inspection approval dates must be entered in the heat pump rebate application. CMLP will verify the inspection approval dates using the Town's online permitting database.\n\nEarliest Eligible Installation Date\n\nThe heat pump equipment must have been installed on or after January 1, 2023 to be eligible for a rebate. The installation date is the latter of the Concord Building Department's:\n\nelectrical inspection approval date or\n\nsheet metal inspection approval date (applicable if the project requires sheet metal ducting work that goes beyond minor repairs)\n\nHeat Load Calculation Requirement for Heat Pumps Serving a Newly Constructed Addition + Some or All of an Existing Building\n\nIf the heat pump system installed will serve some or all of an existing building plus a newly constructed addition, a heat load calculation (i.e. energy model, Manual N or Manual J report) for the entire space to be conditioned by the heat pump must be provided with the rebate application. The heating capacity of the heat pump system installed must be at least 90% of the heat load at the design temperature. Since CMLP does not provide rebates for heat pumps solely serving new construction, the heat load calculation will help CMLP verify that the heat pump system installed is sized to serve part or all of the existing building as well as the new addition.\n\nCMLP does not require a heat load calculation for heat pumps installed solely to serve an existing building. However, to help ensure proper heat pump sizing, a heat load calculation is strongly encouraged for all whole-building applications.\n\nShared Savings Arrangements\n\nAt this time, CMLP does not provide rebates for heat pumps installed by a contractor under a shared savings arrangement, in which the contractor’s compensation is based on the savings achieved.\n\nCMLP offers the R-7 “Electric Resistance & Heat Pump Heating Systems/DHW” rate for heat pump users. This special winter rate is designed to prevent an unintended spike in electricity charges for electric heating customers as a result of CMLP’s tiered rate structure. This rate may benefit you if you already use more than 657 kilowatt-hours in some winter months, or if you expect to do so once your heat pump is installed.\n\nHowever, in order to take advantage of this rate, you must request that a separate meter be installed by CMLP. This meter will record the electric usage of your heat pump. Electricity use recorded on this meter from October 1st through April 30th will be billed exclusively at the lowest (tier 1) rate of at $0.19120 per kWh. From May 1st through September 30th, the use through this meter will be billed under the regular R-1 Rate, which ranges from the tier 1 rate of $0.19120 to the tier 3 rate of $0.22719 per kWh, depending on how much electricity your household has used that month.\n\nCMLP will supply and install the separate meter at no cost to you. However, you will need to pay an electrician to install a meter socket for the new meter. An additional electrical panel is typically needed as well. Costs for a meter socket/electrical panel can range from $1,000 to $4,000. The time it will take you to recoup the cost of the new meter socket/panel through electricity cost savings depends on several factors:\n\n- the socket/panel installation cost;\n\n- the extent to which your electric usage exceeds 657 kWh per month once your heat pump is installed and\n\n- how long the tiered rate structure and the Electric Resistance & Heat Pump Heating Systems/DHW rate remain in effect. CMLP plans to upgrade all meters beginning in 2023. The CMLP Light Board intends to replace tiered rates with a time of use rate structure once these meters are installed. At that point, the Electric Resistance & Heat Pump Heating Systems / DHW rate may be discontinued. In that case, it is unlikely that you would recoup your investment in a new meter socket and electrical panel through electricity cost savings.\n\nPlease note also that customers who have a solar array usually expect that solar electricity will lower the portion of their electric bill attributable to the electricity needed to power their heat pump during the winter. However, if a heat pump is separately metered so that a customer can receive the Electric Resistance & Heat Pump Heating Systems/DHW rate for winter usage, CMLP is unable to offset the winter usage measured by the separate meter with solar electricity generated by the array. Therefore, having a solar array will not lower a customer’s winter bill for heat pump electricity usage if the Resistance & Heat Pump Heating Systems/DHW rate is in effect. However, during the summer, when the Resistance & Heat Pump Heating Systems/DHW rate does not apply, solar electricity will offset the portion of an electricity bill due to a heat pump being used for air conditioning, even if the heat pump is separately metered.\n\nIn addition, heat pump customers with solar would need to locate the second meter on the line (street) side of the existing house meter in order for the solar electricity powering the heat pump to be accounted for properly. This can require longer wire runs that increase the cost of the meter socket installation.\n\nPlease consider these factors when deciding whether to invest in a separate meter/electric panel. If you have further questions about the Electric Resistance & Heat Pump Heating Systems/DHW rate, please contact Laura Scott, Power Supply and Rates Administrator, at (978) 318-3102 or LScott@concordma.gov.\n\nApplicable Building Stock\n\nCMLP’s heat pump rebates are available for heat pumps installed in existing buildings, and/or newly constructed additions to existing buildings. They are not available for heat pumps installed before the date a Permanent Certificate of Occupancy was issued for a newly constructed home or before the date a building inspection approval was issued for a newly constructed outbuilding.\n\nEquipment must be used to supplement or replace oil, propane, or electric baseboard (resistance) heating systems or pre-existing heat pumps that functioned as the existing primary heating system. Households whose primary heating fuel is natural gas are not eligible for CMLP’s heat pump rebates, but may apply for similar rebates through Mass Save.\n\nHome Energy Assessment Requirement\n\nIf a home was built before 2008, a no-cost home energy assessment within the last three years or scheduled within six months after project completion is required. Outbuildings listed in the “Outbuildings” section of the property record in the Town of Concord’s online assessment database are exempt from the home energy assessment requirement. A completed Energy Saver Home Loan Program decarbonization plan is an acceptable substitute for a completed home energy assessment.\n\nCompleted Home Energy Assessment: If you believe you had an assessment in the last three years through CMLP, but do not know the date, contact Energy New England, CMLP’s assessment provider, at 1-888-772-4242 or hea@ene.org for assistance.\n\nScheduling a No-Cost Home Energy Assessment: Visit our Home Energy Assessments webpage for instructions on scheduling an assessment.\n\nDecarbonization Plan: Households participating in the Energy Saver Home Loan Program receive a decarbonization plan subsequent to an assessment of their home by an Energy Service Provider. The decarbonization plan can be uploaded with the heat pump rebate application to fulfill the home energy assessment requirement.\n\nCMLP strongly recommends that priority weatherization recommendations from the home energy assessment or decarbonization plan be implemented before, or in coordination with, the installation of the heat pump. A tight, well-insulated home optimizes heat pump performance, and may allow for a smaller heat pump to be installed, saving you money upfront and on your monthly utility bills. CMLP’s weatherization rebates help you increase your home’s efficiency and prepare for a new heating system.\n\nOptional Project Pre-Approval\n\nHomeowners and contractors who wish to verify rebate eligibility prior to system installation may opt into submitting an optional rebate pre-approval form. CMLP strongly suggests taking advantage of this opportunity to verify a project's rebate eligibility, preferably before a contract is signed, and especially if the customer is expecting a whole home heat pump rebate. Contractors can submit the optional pre-approval form online with details on the proposed equipment at the links below for air-source or for ground-source heat pump projects. CMLP will review the project to verify whether it qualifies for CMLP's rebates, and whether a whole home or a partial home heat pump rebate applies. Both the customer and contractor will receive an email confirmation once pre-approved. If equipment changes from pre-approval to installation, CMLP cannot guarantee rebate eligibility. The optional pre-approval does not exempt the project from the required post-installation quality assurance review described in the following paragraph.\n\nQuality Assurance Review Requirement\n\nOnce installation is complete, contractors must submit an online post-installation quality assurance form to CMLP at the links below for air-source or for ground-source heat pump projects. The form requires Concord Building Department inspection approval dates, equipment and project information for rebate eligibility review, and requests that the installer confirm that best practices were followed. CMLP will review the completed form, follow up with the contractor regarding any deficiencies and conduct an on-site inspection if necessary. The contractor and customer will receive an email confirmation once the installed heat pump project is reviewed and approved.\n\nTown Building Department Permit and Inspection Requirements\n\nThe project electrician must apply for a Town electrical permit before work begins and schedule an electrical inspection after the work is done. CMLP will not award rebates until projects have passed an electrical inspection by Concord's Building Department.\n\nIf the project requires sheet metal ducting work that goes beyond minor repairs, a sheet metal permit must be obtained for the project. Examples of projects that require a sheet metal permit include installation of new ducting or replacement, significant repairs or changes to existing ducting. The Town of Concord's inspector must have inspected and approved the sheet metal work.\n\nCMLP will verify that the project has passed the necessary inspections. Find out more details about permits and inspections in the Quality Assurance section on this page. The Building Department's contact information and hours are here.\n\nTown of Concord Board of Health Drilling Permits\n\nGround-source heat pump installers must apply for a drilling permit from the Town of Concord Board of Health before drilling begins. The permit application allows the Board of Health to verify that the wells are set back an appropriate distance from existing sewer and water lines. Permits can be requested via the Town's online permitting system. Contact information and hours for the Board of Health are here. CMLP will verify the date on which the drilling permit is issued.\n\nDo-It-Yourself Heat Pump Installations\n\nDo-it-yourself (DIY) heat pump installations are eligible for rebates under the following conditions:\n\n-- A licensed electrician obtains an electrical permit and does the wiring. The installation must pass a Concord Building Department electrical inspection.\n\n-- If the project involves sheet metal work beyond minor repairs, a tradesperson qualified to obtain a sheet metal permit must do so. The sheet metal work must pass a Concord Building Department inspection.\n\n-- When applicable, refrigerant lines must be charged, sealed, and tested by a licensed professional to adhere to EPA regulations (some self-install systems are pre-charged and pre-sealed). If an existing HVAC system is being decommissioned, existing refrigerant must be properly recaptured.\n\n-- The rebate cannot exceed the cost of the project, which is documented by invoices and/or receipts. Therefore DIY labor does not count towards the cost of the project.\n\nIn addition to the requirements for all heat pump projects:\n\n- new heat pumps sized to meet less than 90% of the total home heating load at the outdoor design temperature, per ASHRAE 2017 Design Conditions, are eligible for partial home heat pump rebates if they are supplementing or replacing oil, propane, electric resistance, ETS or existing heat pumps, or if they are replacing natural gas as a secondary source of heating.\n\n- integrated controls must be installed in homes with oil or propane backup to qualify for rebates on partial-home air-source or air-to-water heat pumps.\n\n- Integrated controls are not required if the backup heating system is heat pumps, electric resistance or ETS.\n\n- Integrated controls are not required if the heat pump meets 100% of the heating needs for a distinct zone in a home, meaning that there is no other heating equipment serving that zone with which to integrate the heat pump.\n\n- Integrated controls are not required for partial-home ground-source heat pumps.\n\n- Integrated controls are not required in condo units in residential 5+ unit complexes, including 1-4 unit buildings that are part of larger complexes, which are not eligible for whole-home rebates but are eligible for the partial-home rebate amounts, as long as the heat pumps are sized to meet 90% - 120% of the total home heating load at the outdoor design temperature, per ASHRAE 2017 Design Conditions throughout 100% of the conditioned space.\n\n- integrated controls must be set at or below these maximum switchover temperatures:\n\nPre-Existing Heating FuelMaximum Switch-Over TemperaturePropane≤ 15°FOil≤ 30°F\n\n- A heat pump sized for whole home AC, but inadequate for whole home heating is eligible for a partial-home heat pump rebate. Integrated controls are required for air-source or air-to-water heat pumps, and installers must design the system to be able to meet the home's heating needs at the defined maximum switch-over temperature above, so that the new heat pump system is heating-ready.\n\nCMLP highly recommends submission of the Optional Pre-Approval Form to confirm whole home rebate eligibility before an installation contract is signed. See the \"Eligibility Criteria for All Heat Pump Projects\" section above for links to pre-approval forms for air-source heat pump projects and for ground-source heat pumps projects.\n\nIn addition to the requirements for all heat pump projects, the following are requirements for CMLP's whole home heat pump rebate:\n\n- Heat pumps must be new and sized to be capable of being the sole source of heating in the home, defined as the living area in the Town of Concord's online property assessment database. That is, the heat pump must be sized to meet 90 - 120% of the total heating load at an 8°F outdoor design temperature, per ASHRAE 2017 Design Conditions. Each condenser must be able to heat its zone down to 8°F. A Manual J heat load calculation is required for sizing whole home heat pump systems.\n\n- CMLP reserves the right to issue rebates for heat pumps sized to meet more than 120% of the total heating load, at its discretion.\n\n- Homes may use supplemental heat from existing heat pumps, ETS, and/or electric baseboard (resistance) units if the new heat pump system is sized to meet 90% - 120% of the home's heat load.\n\n- Homes may use a pre-existing or new fossil fuel heating system for domestic hot water.\n\n- Homes may maintain emergency heating capacity from electric resistance baseboards or strip within the heat pump(s) or from existing or new wood, pellet, fossil fuel or ETS equipment. An emergency is either heat pump maintenance down-time or if the heat pump is not able to heat the home during an extreme weather event.\n\n- Project must either include the removal or disconnection of the pre-existing heating system, or the homeowner must not use the pre-existing heating system unless there is an emergency, as defined above.\n\n- A customer and their installer must sign the whole home heat pump verification form and submit it with the heat pump rebate application.\n\n- The installer must submit a Manual J heat load calculation to CMLP with the online post-installation quality assurance (QA) form for heat pump projects. Click for the air-source heat pump QA form or for theground-source heat pump QA form.\n\n- Because the heat pump system for which the rebate is being sought must be sized to be capable of being the sole source of heat in the home:\n\n- a customer installing more heat pumps to supplement existing heat pumps is eligible for a partial home heat pump rebate, not a whole home heat pump rebate, if the new heat pumps are sized to meet less than 90% of the heating load.\n\n- a heat pump sized for whole home AC but inadequate for whole home heating is eligible for a partial home heat pump rebate but not for a whole home heat pump rebate.\n\n- A customer installing a new heat pump system to replace existing heat pumps is eligible for a whole home heat pump rebate if the new heat pump system is sized to be capable of being the sole source of heating in the home, as defined above.\n\nWhole Home Rebate Eligibility for Multi-Unit Properties\n\nMulti-unit properties include:\n\nresidential condominium complexes\n\nsingle family homes with informal apartments\n\n2 or 3 family homes\n\nMultiple houses on one parcel\n\nProperties with outbuildings, where heat pump is to be installed in the outbuilding\n\nApartment buildings with 4 or more units\n\nTransient or non-transient group quarters\n\nThe way in which CMLP applies its whole home heat pump rebate policy to different types of multi-unit properties is based upon:\n\nProperty type classification codes known as “Use Codes,” that are displayed in the “Land Use” section of each property record in the Concord Assessor’s database.\n\nElectric service addresses in CMLP’s billing system.\n\nClick here to see how CMLP’s whole home heat pump rebate policies apply to each of the multi-unit property types listed above.\n\nPreliminary Step: To be eligible for a rebate, heat pump projects require a quality assurance (QA) check by CMLP. After the installation is complete, your contractor must submit the online Installation Quality Assurance (QA) Form to CMLP, found at the following links for air-source or ground-source heat pumps. The quality assurance check may include an on-site inspection, if necessary. Once the project has received its quality assurance approval, CMLP will send an email confirmation to you and your contractor.\n\nGround-Source Heat Pump Installation Quality Assurance (QA) Form\n\nNote that the QA form requires you to provide the date that the heat pump installation has passed a Town of Concord Building Department electrical inspection and, if applicable, a sheet meal inspection. For ground-source heat pump projects, the QA form also requires you to provide the Concord Board of Health drilling permit issue date.\n\nEnsure that the following steps have been taken before you fill out the QA form:\n\n- The project electrician must apply for a Town electrical permit before work begins, and schedule an electrical inspection after the work is done. The Town of Concord electrical inspector must have inspected and approved the heat pump installation.\n\n- If the project requires sheet metal ducting work that goes beyond minor repairs, a sheet metal permit must be obtained for the project. Examples of projects that require a sheet metal permit include installation of new ducting or replacement, significant repairs or changes to existing ducting. The Town of Concord's inspector must have inspected and approved the sheet metal work.\n\n- For ground-source heat pump projects, the Concord Board of Health must have issued a drilling permit.\n\nPayment of rebates is contingent upon verification by CMLP that Town records show the appropriate inspection approvals and drilling permits for the project. Find out more about permits and inspections in the Quality Assurance section on this page. The Building Department's contact information and hours are here. The Board of Health's contact information and hours are here.\n\nRebate Application Step: Access the rebate application at the button below, and complete it with assistance from your installer or CMLP staff person Jan Aceti (jaceti@concordma.gov or 978-318-3151). If you are working with a heating/cooling coach, they may be able to help you as well. Upload the following documents with the rebate application.\n\n- invoice from a heat pump installer showing:\n\n- installation address\n\n- installer company name\n\n- outdoor and indoor equipment model numbers\n\n- integrated control model numbers, if applicable.\n\n- Whole-home heat pump verification form signed by you and your installer, if the heat pump system is sized to be the sole source of heating in the residence and there are fewer than 5 living units on the property. Note that individual living units in residential 5+ unit complexes on common property, including 1-4 unit buildings that are part of larger complexes on common property, are not eligible for whole home rebates, but are eligible for partial home rebates. The whole-home heat pump verification form is not required for partial home rebate applications.\n\nCMLP's 90-day rebate application window begins on the date of the Quality Assurance (QA) approval by CMLP. Projects for which CMLP does not receive a rebate application within the 90-day window are not eligible for a rebate.\n\nIf an application received by CMLP is incomplete or has not met all of the rebate requirements (e.g. scheduled home energy assessment, approved quality assurance form), CMLP may reach out once to the installer and to the customer by both phone and email. If outstanding issues are not resolved within 30 days of the communication, the project will no longer be eligible for a rebate. If a quality assurance form needs to be completed, it must be submitted to CMLP within 25 days of the communication, to ensure that CMLP has time to review it before the 30 day deadline.\n\nThe Town of Concord assumes no liability for any equipment, installation or damages.\n\nThe Town may inspect equipment to verify the above information up to 1 year after receiving the rebate application.\n\nAll projects must go through a post-installation quality assurance process to qualify for a rebate. Once the installation is complete, your installer must submit the Quality Assurance (QA) Form to CMLP, found at the following links for air-source or ground-source heat pumps. The form requires Concord Building Department inspection approval dates, drilling permit date if needed, equipment and project information for rebate eligibility review, and requests the installer confirm that installation best practices were followed. CMLP will review the completed form, follow up with the contractor regarding any deficiencies and conduct an on-site inspection if necessary. The contractor and customer will receive an email confirmation once the installed heat pump project is reviewed and approved.\n\nTown of Concord Building Department Permits and Inspections\n\nThe project's electrician must obtain a Town electrical permit and schedule an electrical inspection. CMLP will not award rebates until projects have passed electrical inspection by Concord's Building Department. If sheet metal duct work beyond minor repairs is also part of your installation, your installer must also obtain a sheet metal permit. Contact information and hours for the Building Department are here.\n\nGetting an Electrical Permit\n\nThe permit should be obtained before work begins. Concord has online permitting, so the electrician does not have to go into the Building Department office in person to obtain a permit. The electrician can upload their liability insurance certificate and license and can pay online.\n\nGetting an Electrical Inspection\n\nElectrical inspections are done on weekdays and can usually be completed within 5 to 7 days of the request. The homeowner cannot schedule the inspection. The electrician schedules it by calling the Electrical Inspector at 978-318-3235 between 8am and 9am Monday through Friday with the permit number and the desired inspection date and time. Messages left for the Electrical Inspector after 9am will be returned the next morning. An adult (who does not need to be the electrician – a homeowner, family member, or builder is fine) needs to be there to let the inspector into the house. The inspector knows what to look for once he is in the house and can phone the electrician if there is a question about the project while he’s on site.\n\nThe electrical inspector notifies CMLP of all approved electrical inspections.\n\nSheet Metal Permits and Inspections\n\nSheet metal permits and inspections are required whenever duct work beyond minor repairs are part of a heat pump installation, such as installing new ducts or re-routing existing ducts. The process for getting permits follows the same process outlined above. The sheet metal contractor or the homeowner may call the Building Dept. to schedule sheet metal inspections at (978) 318-3280.\n\nTown of Concord Board of Health Drilling Permits\n\nGround-source heat pump installers must apply for a drilling permit from the Town of Concord Board of Health before drilling begins. The permit application allows the Board of Health to verify that the wells are set back an appropriate distance from existing sewer and water lines. Permits can be requested via the Town's online permitting system. Contact information and hours for the Board of Health are here.\n\nPreliminary Step: Ensure that the heat pump installation has passed a Town of Concord Building Department electrical inspection and, if applicable, a sheet meal inspection in the rebate application. You will need to enter the inspection approval date(s) in the rebate application. Find out more about permits and inspections in the \"Eligibility Criteria for Heat Pump Projects\" section on this page. The Building Department's contact information and hours are here.\n\nRebate Application Step: Click the \"Apply\" button below for the rebate application, and complete it with assistance from your installer or from Jan Aceti, CMLP's Energy Efficiency and Electrification Coordinator (jaceti@concordma.gov or 978-318-3151). Upload the following documents with the rebate application.\n\n- if heat pump was installed by an outside contractor, invoice from the heat pump installer showing:\n\n- installation company/contractor information\n\n- installation address\n\n- equipment model numbers (including indoor model numbers, where appropriate)\n\n- integrated control model numbers, if required.\n\n- if installed by in-house tradespeople, receipt(s) for heat pump equipment and materials used in installation, showing;\n\n- delivery address\n\n- equipment model numbers (including indoor model numbers, where appropriate)\n\n- integrated control model numbers, if required.\n\n- energy model, Manual N or Manual J heat load report, if heat pump is designed to serve some or all of an existing building plus a newly constructed addition attached to the existing building.\n\n- a copy of your W-9 form, if the rebate requested is $600 or more and in the form of a check.\n\nCMLP's 90-day rebate application window begins on the latter of the Concord Building Department's:\n\nelectrical inspection approval date or\n\nsheet metal inspection approval date (applicable if the project requires sheet metal ducting work that goes beyond minor repairs)\n\nProjects for which CMLP does not receive a rebate application within the 90-day window are not eligible for a rebate.\n\nIf an application received by CMLP is incomplete or has not met all of the rebate requirements, CMLP will reach out once to the installer and to the customer by both phone and email. If outstanding issues are not resolved within 30 days of the communication, the project will no longer be eligible for a rebate.\n\nThe Town of Concord assumes no liability for any equipment, installation or damages.\n\nThe Town may inspect equipment to verify the above information up to 1 year after receiving the rebate application.\n\nAll of the rivers and ponds in Concord are contaminated with mercury, and residents are warned not to eat the fish because of the high levels of mercury in the fish that live in the water. The source of this contamination is mercury in rainwater. The mercury in rainwater is thought to come from coal-burning power plants in the mid west (50%), local medical incinerators (25%), and local solid waste incinerators (25%). Mercury in local solid waste incinerators comes from fluorescent bulbs, mercury fever thermometers, thermostats, button batteries, and similar mercury-containing devices. The best way to prevent mercury from ending up in our lakes and streams is to keep it out of our incinerators. Residents can recycle many mercury-containing devices at locations in Concord.\n\nFluorescent bulbs: All fluorescent bulbs, straight, U, circular, and compact contain mercury may be recycled at Concord Public Works located at 133 Keyes Road, Monday-Thursday 9:00 AM to 3 PM. In addition items may be recycled at Vanderhoof Hardware.\n\nButton Batteries: Small button batteries used in watches, hearing aids, laser pointers, and more still contain small amounts of mercury and other heavy metals. These batteries may be recycled at Concord Public Works, Monday-Thursday 9:00 AM to 3 PM.\n\nIntact mercury-containing devices, such as thermostats and fever thermometers, may be recycled at Concord Public Works located at 133 Keyes Road, Monday-Thursday 9 AM to 3 PM.\n\nMercury that is not contained in a manufactured device, such as mercury from a broken fever thermometer, a jar of elemental mercury, and more should be taken to the Minuteman Regional Household Hazardous Waste Facility. Contact Concord Public Works at 978-318-3240 for more information on hazardous waste disposal.\n\nThe recycling truck for the municipal collection program has 2 compartments: 1 for mixed paper and 1 for commingled containers. Materials must be separated into these 2 categories when setting materials out for collection.\n\nMaterials that go in the mixed paper compartment include any kind of clean paper item:\n\n- Newspaper\n\n- Magazines\n\n- Catalogs\n\n- Junk mail\n\n- Envelopes\n\n- White and colored paper\n\n- Fax paper\n\n- Phone books\n\n- Paperback books\n\n- Spiral notebooks\n\n- Clasp envelopes\n\n- Manila folders\n\n- Shoe boxes\n\n- Cereal boxes\n\n- Poster board\n\n- Corrugated cardboard, and more.\n\nPlastic windows, self-stick labels, and staples are accepted. Cardboard must be flattened and smaller than 36 inches by 36 inches in order to fit in the compartment. Household product containers include 4 types of containers: glass, metal, plastic, and aseptic cartons. All these containers may be mixed together in a single bin.\n\nGlass containers include clear and colored bottles and jars with lids removed (you do not need to remove metal collars). Metal containers include deposit and non-deposit beverage cans, metal food cans, and metal jar and can lids. Plastic containers include any plastic bottle or jar except those used for motor oil or other chemicals. It also includes other plastic containers, such as plastic take out food containers (except those made from styrofoam). Aseptic cartons include paper milk and juice cartons as well as empty juice boxes that have had the straws removed. Please remember that all containers must be rinsed clean.\n\nPlease do not recycle the following items:\n\n- Plastic bags\n\n- Styrofoam (cups, trays, block, or packaging peanuts, even if marked #6)\n\n- Plastic containers for motor oil or other hazardous chemicals, or soiled paper (such as paper plates, cups, towels, napkins, tissue, or paper with paint or glue).\n\nPizza boxes can only be recycled when they have absolutely no grease or other food waste and are turned inside out so they look like a regular piece of cardboard.\n\nConcord Public Works runs the paint reuse, recycling, and disposal shed at the Composting Site (on Walden Street, just across route 2), every Saturday from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m., April through October. The shed is set up as a swap shed and is open to all Concord residents. Residents bring paint materials they no longer want, and may take away excellent quality materials for reuse at no cost. Residents are encouraged to visit the paint shed before beginning a painting project to see what materials are available for free. There are usually large quantities of primer, sealer, off-white semi-gloss (excellent for moldings and trim), off-white flat paint, wood stain, deck sealer, paint thinner, and more.\n\nLatex paint is not a hazardous product, so the only latex paint the shed will accept is latex paint in good enough condition that you can imagine using it in your own home. If there is very little paint in the can, or the paint is dried out, throw the can away with your regular rubbish. If there is more than ¼ can but it is not in good condition, or if the paint has been frozen, you must dry it out, then dispose of it with your regular trash. To dry it out, add kitty litter or a latex paint hardener typically available at Concord Lumber, Vanderhoof Hardware or other paint suppliers, then dispose of the can with your regular trash.\n\nOil and alkyd-based paints and stains are hazardous products. If the can is empty you may throw it away with your regular trash. If the can is more than ¼ full, no matter what condition, bring the can to the paint shed for reuse, recycling, or proper disposal. Other paint products, such as primer and sealer, polyurethane, shellac, wood and deck preservatives, paint remover, unused paint thinner, and unused mineral spirits, are also accepted for reuse, recycling, or proper disposal at the paint shed. These items are flammable and should never be disposed of with your regular trash unless the can is empty or the materials are dried out. Paint thinner or mineral spirits that have been used to clean brushes should be taken to the Minuteman Hazardous Waste Facility for proper disposal.\n\nThe Paint Shed does not accept any other hazardous material. Other hazardous products, such as epoxy, floor finish, and more must be taken to the Minuteman Regional Household Hazardous Waste Facility in Lexington, which is open to Concord residents 1 Saturday per month April through November. For more information on disposing of hazardous materials call Concord Public Works at 978-318-3240."
