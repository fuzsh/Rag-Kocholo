Since last August he had made his home with a niece andher husband, Mr. and Mrs. Peter Anderson of Madison. He had been in failing health for the past several years, suffering several slight strokes, and in the spring he had undergone an operation. He failed to rally properly after this. Mr. Qualley was born Nov. 5, 1874, in Vestra Slidre, Valders, Norway, and in 1891 came to the United States and Valders, Wisconsin. In February, 1902, he bought a farm west of Valders, and after his marriage on June 18, 1902, to Bertha Lyken, the couple resided there. Mrs. Qualley died in November, 1949, after a brief illness. Mr. Qualley's interst in prize grain growing won him scores of blue, white, and red ribbons at County, State and International fairs and shows, and the coveted title of \"Manitowoc County Barley King\" was one that John, as he was known to his many friends, cherished and held dear to his heart. He won this title successively for years since 1947 for prize barley seed he had grown. He was a member of the Brotherhood of the Valders Ev. Lutheran Church and was active on the Dartball team until a year or so ago when ill health made it necessary for him to give up this recreation. He was a stockbroker and director in the St. Nazianz State Bank for many years, which he continued to the time of his death. After the death of his wife he gave a beautiful electric organ to his church as a memorial gift to her, and gave several other fine gifts to the church. Survivirs(sic) are a half-brother, Austin Qualey(sic) of Hingham, Mont., a half-sister, Mrs. Sven Severson of Davenport, North Dakota, and several nieces and nephews.

The attendants for the two couples at the ceremony were Miss Lulu Jacobson, this city and Albert Berge, Miss Margaret Reinertson and Albert Hogan, Miss Alma Thompson and Thomas Reinertson, Miss Martha Hogan and Phillip Gigstad.

REINERTSON Homicide Case Focuses On Mental Competency By Andy Thompson Post-Crescent staff writer Mental competency has emerged as a major issue in the case of a former Outagamie County Health Center patient charged in the death of another patient at the facility. Outagamie County Circuit Judge Harold Froehlich ordered a mental examination Monday afternoon for Stephen C. Meidam, 52, who is charged with first-degree reckless homicide in the death of 71-year-old Donald Reinertson. The examination, which will be done at Winnebago Mental Health Institute, was recommended by both Public Defender Brian Figy and Dist. Atty. Vince Biskupic. The charge against Meidam, who was a long-term patient at the health center, carries a maximum of 40 years in prison. Authorities said Meidam became upset and \"stomped\" on Reinertson's head after he saw Reinertson lying on his bed at the health center on June 12. Meidam was staying in Room 115 and Reinertson was staying next door in Room 113. An employee at the health center told police that Reinertson may have been on Meidam's bed by accident. According to the complaint, Meidam told a nurse at the health center that he knocked Reinertson on the floor and \"stomped on his head\" several times, according to the criminal complaint. Meidam's roommate said Meidam pulled Reinertson off of the bed and stomped on his head about five times. The roommate told Grand Chute police that Reinertson sometimes came into the room to listen to the radio and watch television, and that he would sometimes lay on Meidam's bed. When ambulance personnel were summoned to the room on June 12, Reinertson was lying on the floor and a shoe imprint was visible on the left side of his head, the complaint stated. Reinertson was transported to Appleton Medical Center for treatment of the head injury. Because of the injury, his health deteriorated and he died on Aug. 3, authorities said. An autopsy conducted by Dr. Michael Chambliss indicated that Reinertson died of conditions stemming from the assault. During Meidam's initial appearance Monday afternoon before Outagamie County Court Commissioner Kathleen Lhost, Figy requested that a mental competency examination be ordered to determine whether the defendant is able to assist in his own defense. \"I have reason to doubt Mr. Meidam's competency,\" Figy said. Figy repeated that argument to Froehlich during the hearing late Monday afternoon. The defense attorney said Meidam is suffering from a \"major mental illness,\" described by Figy as schizophrenia. Figy said Meidam had been a resident at the health center for 30 years. David Rothmann, administrator at the Outagamie County Health Center, said earlier Monday that there has never before been a similar incident at the facility. Rothmann said Meidam \"has never done anything close to this in the past. It just came out of the blue.\" Meidam was transferred out of the center after the incident. Rothmann said there are no legal requirements that security measures be in place at the center because it is licensed as a nursing home. \"We're licensed as a nursing home and we have staff available to manage behavioral problems or individuals with behavioral problems,\" said Rothmann. \"lf their behaviors become really dangerous to themselves or others, then we transfer (them) out.\" Lhost ordered that bond for Meidam remain at $50,000.
