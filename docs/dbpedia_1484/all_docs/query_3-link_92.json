Your insight convinced us to take a new direction with regard to the location planning for Classrooms and Administration offices and that made a tremendous difference in the way we are able to serve both our internal and external customers.\n\nOur general contractor, furniture provider and all the other subs I enlisted were amazed at how fast you were able to turn the chosen direction into construction ready documents and assist us in getting through the permitting process. Our direction was to complete the project from concept to completion within 3 and 1/2 months, which we did!

From the very beginning of the project, Scott and his team took great care to insure a complete understanding of the project scope and desire of the owners. Through a very deliberate and defined planning process, the Barnard team helped to design one of the most functional and aesthetically pleasing structures of its type in Georgia. The delivery of their product was timely and within project budget.\n\nIt is our anticipation that this facility will continue to serve the public for many years to come.\n\n- Joseph Brown, County Administrator, Liberty County, GA\n\nLIFE, Inc\n\n40 Unit Assessable Housing Community\n\nLive Oak Public Library\n\nCarnegie Branch Master Plan\n\nCarnegie Branch Re-Roof\n\nTemporary Office Relocation\n\nMassage Envy Spa\n\nSavannah Station\n\nMelaver, Inc\n\nBarnard Architects is a fine architectural firm, which I have had the pleasure to work with for nearly 20 years.\n\nWe first worked together on 114-118 Barnard Street, an historic restoration/adaptive re-use of a former grocery store which now houses offices, retail, a restaurant, and the Telfair Square Post Office.. This project involved selective demolition and full renovation of a 10,800 square-foot building in Savannah Landmark Historic District. Scott and Bob's attention to detail throughout the project design and the construction administration was crucial to the success of the project. Due to their full understanding of building structure and mechanical needs, we were able to address thoroughly all known issues. In addition and where Barnard Architects provide additional value, their team helped us prepare for likely unknowns and problem issues. This added foresight helped ensure the project was delivered on time and as budgeted.\n\nSince the completion of the Barnard Street project, we have successfully worked with Barnard Architects on numerous other projects ranging from a 35,000 gsf interior buildout for Ashley Furniture down to a 1,500 gsf Gigi’s Cupcake shop. We have completed a variety of mostly design/build commissions including new and renovated retail shops, new residential, renovation of medical offices, and a commercial façade renovation project in downtown Savannah.\n\nBarnard Architects are always my first choice and my first suggestion to clients for architectural services when needed.\n\n- Randy Peacock, Peacock Construction (formerly Project Manager for Melaver)\n\nTelfair Square Post Office, Savannah\n\nBarnard & State Street Building\n\nWhitaker & State Street Building\n\nMeldrim Methodist Church\n\nSocial Hall Addition\n\nMemorial Health University\n\nInternal Medicine Office, 340 Eisenhower Drive\n\nGeorgia Healthcare Partnership, Market Walk\n\nMiddleton & Anderson Attorneys\n\nSavannah Home Office Expansion, Drayton Street\n\nSavannah Home Office, Drayton Street\n\nAtlanta Office, Peachtree Center\n\nMr. Wonderful BBQ\n\nMontgomery Street Improvements\n\nDepartment of the Navy\n\nNWS Earle, Colts Neck, NJ, MasterPlan & BEAP\n\nNew Covenant Church\n\nBull Street Renovation\n\nOgeechee Missionary Baptist Church\n\nRenovations and Expansion\n\nOld Savannah City Mission\n\nBull Street, Renovations\n\nOlde Landmark Properties\n\n35 Barnard Street Renovation\n\nOnPoint Digital\n\nOffice Renovation, 906 Drayton Street\n\nPapillote\n\nWest Broughton Street Retail Renovation\n\nParent & Child Development Services\n\nMontessori Children's Center Improvements\n\nPhi Gamma Delta Fraternity\n\nFraternity House Renovation, Auburn, AL\n\nProvidence Christian School\n\nClassroom Expansion\n\nCampus Master Plan\n\nRiver Street Sweets\n\nRiver Street, Savannah\n\nMall of America, Buford, GA\n\nTanger Outlet Mall, Lancaster, PA\n\nTanter Outlet Mall, North Charleston, SC\n\nBroadway at the Beach, Myrtle Beach, SC\n\nHabersham Village, Savannah\n\nKing Street, Charleston, SC\n\nDuval Street, Key West, FL\n\nNational Harbor, MD\n\nTanger Outlet Mall, Pooler, GA\n\nSt Catherine’s Island Foundation\n\nNew Dining Hall\n\nHistoric Slave Cabin Row Documentation\n\nHistoric Slave Cabin 4 Renovation\n\nCabin 8 Re-creation\n\nSt Michaels Catholic Church\n\nChurch Expansion & Renovations\n\nSt Pauls Evangelical Lutheran Church\n\nArchive Expansion\n\nADA Accessibility Improvements\n\nSt Peter the Apostle Church\n\nMaster Plan for Improvements\n\nSanctuary Accessibility Improvements\n\nSavannah Athletic Hall of Fame\n\nCivic Center\n\nThe Savannah Bank\n\nSouthside Office and Drive-in\n\nSavannah Bank & Trust Company\n\nCode Compliance Survey, Main Office, Johnson Square\n\nOgeechee Road Branch Renovation/Addition\n\nSavannah - Chatham County Public School System\n\nBartlett STEM Academy ADA Improvements\n\nBartlett STEM Security Vestibule\n\nBrock Elementary Security Vestibule\n\nCoastal Georgia Comprehensive Academy Renovations\n\nCoastal Middle School Security Vestibule\n\nCharles Ellis Security Vestibule\n\nGadsden Elementary Security Vestibule\n\nGeorgetown Elementary Repairs\n\nHenderson Formey ELC Security Vestibule\n\nHodge Elementary Security Vestibule\n\nIsle of Hope Security Vestibule\n\nMarshpoint Elementary Security Vestibule\n\nOatland Island Education Center Improvements\n\nOglethorpe Charter Security Vestibule\n\nRice Creek Security Vestibule\n\nSavannah High Exterior Repairs and Improvements\n\nSouthwest Middle School Repairs\n\nSpencer Elementary Repairs\n\nWoodville Tompkins High Security Vestibule\n\n\"I have been more than please with the design services of Barnard Architects and would gladly recommend them to others.

Their attention to detail to preserve the historic fabric of our property and the surrounding neighborhood made the permitting process much easier.\n\nWe were well satisfied with the services ofScott and Barnard Architects and would recommend them for any architectural services that might be required.”\n\n- William P. Bland, Jr., Chairman of the Building Committee\n\n\"As I take this time to collect myself to transition to retirement after working for Wesley Monumental for 9 years, I would be remiss to not reach out to you to thank you for the work you have done forWesley Monumental over these last few years. I came to Wesley in March of 2008 and was almost immediately thrown into the task of being the staff liaison for the various construction projects that the church had been putting together in their Long Range Plan - at the same time doing my “other” job as Church Administrator.\n\nIt has been a blessing to have Barnard Architects lead Wesley, and in particular me, through the myriad of design details, the creation of drawings and construction documents, leading us through the permitting and Historic Review maze as well as working to insure the end product was as good or better than what was designed. You and John have done an exemplary job of looking out for the best interest of Wesley and it is much appreciated. What we now have in our finished product is a great testament to our combined hard work of good planning and oversight. This all would not be possible without your contribution.\"\n\n- Stephen C.

My relationship with Barnard Architects spans three decades. We have worked very closely together on numerous projects including residential, commercial, and design-build projects. They have consistently produced deliverables on-time and within agreed upon budgets.\n\nOne notable project began 18 years ago, when Barnard Architects and J.T. Turner designed a long-range plan for Wesley Monumental United Methodist Church. We have been implementing that plan for the past 18 years (approximately $12 million in work) and are now in the final phases. Barnard Architects has been a true partner in the execution and successful outcomes of this project.\n\n- James T. Turner, J. T.
