        "text": "HOUSTON, Texas (KTRK) -- As fall approaches, so does Houston's November general election.\n\nHoustonians will elect a new mayor in addition to voting for city councilmembers and the city controller.\n\nHouston Mayor Sylvester Turner is term-limited after serving as mayor since 2016. So no matter who wins, Houston will elect a new mayor for the first time in eight years.\n\nHere's everything you need to know before you go to the polls.\n\nWhen is the November election?\n\nThe 2023 general election will be held on Tuesday, Nov. 7 from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. at voting sites throughout the city.\n\nThe winners of the election will begin their terms of office on Jan. 2, 2024.\n\nSample ballots will be available approximately 45 days before the election.\n\nWhen is the deadline to register to vote?\n\nThe deadline to register to vote in the November general election is Oct. 10, 2023.\n\nYou can register to vote by visiting harrisvotes.org.\n\nSEE ALSO: Crime reveals to be biggest issue in 2023 Houston mayoral race, according to new poll\n\nWhen is early voting?\n\nEarly voting will run from Oct. 23 through Nov. 3., from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. at select polling locations across the city.\n\nWhen is the deadline to vote by mail?\n\nThe last day to apply for a ballot by mail -- received, not postmarked -- is Oct. 27.\n\nMail-in ballots must be filled out and received by Nov. 7 at 7 p.m. if the carrier envelope is not postmarked.

What district am I in?\n\nYour district for voting for your city councilmember may have changed since the last election. The city council approved new district boundaries on Oct. 12, 2022 as part of the redistricting process after the 2020 federal census.\n\nHoustonians can visit the city's redistricting website to view maps and determine which council district they reside in.\n\nIf needed, when is the runoff election?\n\nA date has not yet been set, but should a runoff election be necessary, it is typically held on a Saturday in December.\n\nRELATED: Houston mayor's contest is 2-person race, new poll shows\n\nWho is running for mayor?\n\nSome familiar faces in Houston and Texas politics have announced their campaign for mayor, including State Sen.
