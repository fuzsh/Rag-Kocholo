        "text": "In the early 1970s, young aspiring Black musicians were scattered throughout Beaver County, western Pennsylvania and, of course, the entire greater Pittsburgh region.\n\nThis was an era when they targeted their passions and concentrated on becoming the area’s premier musicians. Unlike today's counterparts, yesterday’s young were not fixed on becoming top videogame rompers. Instead, good musicianship provided a viable alternative to youngsters who may have failed on the hoop court, gridiron or simply lacked athletic prowess.\n\nIn Beaver County, the probability of becoming a professional musician was a devout reality, whereas so was becoming a professional athlete — considering the acclaim of Hopewell Township’s Anthony “Hawk” Dorsett, Aliquippa’s Mike Ditka and Beaver Falls’ Joe Willie Namath. In music, Beaver Valley Musician Union Hall of Famers Henry Mancini and the Steals brothers, Melvin and Mervin, also come to mind.\n\nFoundation is laid\n\nWhen it comes to strictly rhythm and blues musicianship in Beaver County, the groundwork was laid by several soul bands from Aliquippa, Pittsburgh and the Ohio Valley.\n\nGroups — like The Notations, Sweet No, TNT Flashers, Black Love, Wantu Wazuri, The Veltones, Coffee’s Love Train, Shades of Night, Eighth Wonder, Stereos, Soul Del Vibes, The Dynamics, Hi-Fidelics, Jasmine Entertainers featuring Wendy Z, Basic Soul and El Pooks (aka the Stringfield Family) — formed the bedrock for Rare Experience, an Aliquippa-based band that enjoyed enormous success in the region.\n\nYet, it’s generally agreed upon by many, including musicians from that bygone era, that Rare Experience remains the pride of Aliquippa — the one band that garnered the most acclaim of the many that formed in the 1950s and existed throughout the new millennium.\n\nSometime around 1973, the origins of what would eventually become Rare Experience, started in a couple of Plan 11 neighborhoods. This would be the start of what would become the young phenomenal self-contained group that morphed into the county’s most prolific R&B band.\n\nGeorge “Isley” Tyson, an original member and guitarist, humbly reflected on the group’s early success.\n\n“We were a bunch of young kids, really, who were very interested in being musicians. At first, we had about 15 people in the band, but eventually, we pared it down to a more dedicated and talented smaller crew,” he said.\n\nPlan 11 musicians\n\nAlong with himself, Tyson recalled the following original members: Rodney “Duck” Abercrombie (drums); Fred Campbell (guitar); Andre Redd (trumpet); Billy “Whit” Whitaker (bass); vocalist brothers Sheridan “Sherdy” Southerland and Thomas Southerland; Vastine “Winky” Pettis (alto sax/vocals); Aaron White (trumpet); Edgar \"Buck\" Jackson (tenor sax/vocals) and cousins Reggie “Wizard” Jones (keys, multi-instruments) and Allan “Grip” Smith (keys); Napoleon “Nap” Thompson (trombone) and vocalist Sylvester “Boutique” Price.\n\nLater, Robert “Bobby” White (percussion) and brothers Michael (bass) and Maurice Otey (drums) joined the fold, while Aliquippa vocalists Stephanie Townsend, Paula Capperis (keys) and Clairton resident Thea Austin, also became valued members. Rounding out the entourage was sound/road crew members Sam Jackson and Ted B. “Rook” Lewis.\n\nAfter the band achieved significant success in Beaver County, Tyson, now 61, said the band made plans to first relocate to Greenville, S.C., and then ultimately to Atlanta, seeking greater fortunes on the recording scene. As a young father and husband, Tyson said he chose not to risk leaving Aliquippa.\n\n“I was working for Westinghouse in Vanport at the time, and had a young son,” said Tyson, who recently celebrated 40 years with the company, now called the Eaton Corp., where he is a senior lead engineer. Back then, a second-shift position kept him from making many band practices, so he decided to quit Rare Experience.\n\nSeeking a record deal\n\nBy 1982, Rare Experience's popularity reached its apex, and the group decided it was time for a change.\n\n“We were quite popular playing clubs, cabarets and events throughout the county, in Pittsburgh and other outlying areas like New Kensington, Clairton, 'Little' Washington, Uniontown and area colleges,” Edgar “Buck” Jackson recalled. “At this time, I was very eager to go South looking for the ‘big time.’”\n\nJackson, along with Wizard Jones, Grip Smith and Michael Otey, are still Atlanta residents. Jackson now uses his talents in the pulpit and in church choir stands. He’s a pastor and vocalist at an Atlanta area church.\n\nWhile their overall relocation to the South did not pan-out as the major break-through the band envisioned, the move proved to be worthwhile.\n\nIn the 1990s, Wizard Jones and Grip Smith became first-call producers and music directors for some of the hottest R&B acts in the nation, many of whom resided in Atlanta after Clive Davis, Antonio “LA” Reid and Kenneth “BabyFace” Edmonds founded LaFace Records in February 1990. In recent years, Jones was contracted as music director for pop sensation Justin Bieber. Jones also worked with Usher, New Edition, Johnny Gill and Ralph Tresvant, while Smith was the music director for such acts as SWV, TLC, Jermaine Dupree, Sleepy Brown, Keith Sweat, Goodie Mob, 112 and Escape.\n\nSmith developed much of his musical expertise under the direction of Hopewell High School band director Victor Pasquarelli. Smith was the head drummer in the Viking marching band and also played keyboards in jazz and swing bands.\n\n“Mr. Pasquarelli was cool. He gave me the freedom to learn and kept me in-check,” Smith said, adding that his older brother Percy Smith, a keyboardist, was also influential.\n\nRecruited to the prestigious Berklee College of Music in Boston, Smith instead accepted a national touring gig at age 19 due to economic constraints. He’s married with two sons, the oldest being the touring drummer for the SOS Band.\n\nBefore moving to Orlando, guitarist Fred Campbell also lived in Atlanta and saw first-hand the excellent rapport between Jones, Smith and artists like Larry Blackmon of Cameo, Ray Ransom of Brick and Abdul Ra’oof of the SOS Band.\n\n“Our Quiptown guys represented well in the ATL,” said Campbell, an award-winning session player in the city of Walt Disney enterprises. Campbell is married with two adult sons.\n\nJones and Smith both credited groups, such as Brick and SOS Band, for including them in the scene, even though they were newcomers to Atlanta.\n\n“Our connections to both of those groups are still vital to our success, even now,” Jones said. “They showed us mad love when we first moved to Decatur, Georgia.\"\n\nJackson also thanked both of his Rare Experience bandmates for staying the course.\n\n“Those two were hot commodities in Atlanta. They were being courted by heavyweights, including Earth, Wind & Fire. But they never left us. They remained committed to Rare Experience,” he said.\n\nAbercrombie agreed with Jackson, adding that “the commitment reigns mutual throughout all the players, to this day.\"\n\n\"No matter where our travels have taken us, when we reunite, it’s like a family get-together. It’s a genuine bond between all of us,” Abercrombie said.\n\nLast of the live-band generation\n\nEven before the early 1970s, Aliquippa’s live-band tradition was already developing a strong reputation.\n\nMusicians — like Charles “Sonny” Childs, George Jones, Grover McBride, Frank Abercrombie, Del Palmer, Mack Cox Sr. and Johnny Josey Sr. — were blending with other Beaver County musicians, including Beaver Valley Musicians Union Hall of Fame bassist Mike Taylor, Gill Clark, Edward “Guitar Shorty” Ferguson, Larry Smith, Lonzie Cox Jr., Gene Barr, Jim McClendon, James Moon, Skeets Mabin, Ezra Lowe and Donnie Taylor. These collaborations created a vibrant live-music vibe in Beaver County.\n\nAliquippa saxophonist Sonny Childs, who turns 90 on Jan. 3, said clubs like Midland’s Love’s Motel (aka Hole in the Wall), the New Pro Club on Junction Stretch in New Brighton (managed by James Mathews) and the Beaver Falls’ Rainbow Room were important live-music venues in the Beaver Valley.\n\nA younger generation of musicians — such as Rodney “Bogey” Burrows, Gary “Bosh” Washington, Rusty Carter, Lawrence Stringfield, Eugene Crosby, Rex Rideout, James Tignar, Kiki Brooks, Percy Smith, Quinton Newsome, Clarence Grant, Richard “Dicky” Morris, Rosco “Fox” Peak, Derek Redd, Dwight “Mouse” Sims, Rick Gilbert, George “Chico Vaughn” Owens, Bobby Short, Keith Haskins and Beaver Valley Musicians Union Hall of Fame inductees keyboardist Ronnie Cox and vocalist Janine Gilbert-Carter —also connect the proverbial dots to include Rare Experience.\n\nA talented trio of female singers, Renee “Ree” Harvey, Gloria “Glo” Savage and Debbie Hines, also are regarded as legendary Quiptown vocal talents.\n\nChilds added that Beaver County has always been a vibrant live-music hotbed.\n\n“I’ve always had gigs, up until the virus struck last March. Hopefully, it’ll all get revved up once again by next year,” said Childs, an Americus, Georgia, native who recently gigged with Coffee’s Love Train band, led by keyboardist Dwight “Coffee” Thomas of Midland.\n\nJohnny Josey Sr., 82, said he fondly recalls working his alto saxophone as a member of the 1957-58 Aliquippa High School Marching Band under the direction of Fred J. Sporny.\n\n“Even then, music was very important to us,” said Josey, who remembered patronizing the CIO Hall on Franklin Avenue when James Brown and Ray Charles performed there. Another memorable gig was the live show by 1950s vocal giant, Lloyd Price, at the Polish Hall near the Quippian Club, he added.\n\n“Lots of segregation in our town then, but music helped us get through some tough times,” said Josey, an Army veteran and martial artist also known for becoming Aliquippa’s first Black firefighter in the late 1960s. The Logstown native also worked at J&L Steel Corp. while playing sax with the Fabulous Embers of Beaver Falls.\n\n“Being married and raising a family kept me from being a full-time musician,” Josey said. “Naturally, I had my priorities.”\n\nDiverse family backgrounds\n\nSylvester “Sly” Washington, 61, is an Aliquippa native who currently keeps live music intact in Beaver County. The percussionist/bandleader sponsors regular jam sessions for blues, soul and R&B musicians.\n\n“Rare Experience was unique because they were a cross-over band, too. They had a large white following, especially in Center Township,” said Washington, a retired Times photographer. “They should never be typecast into one genre.\"\n\nNow a Baltimore resident, Robert White, 63, has enjoyed an especially extensive career as a professional musician. As the lone Beaver Falls member of Rare Experience, White is unique to the group. “Bongo Bobby,” as one of his group members dubbed him, said he joined the group mainly through affiliations with his uncle and Midland saxophonist, Del Fielder.\n\nOnce known more for his football prowess at Beaver Falls High School, White also was a member of another Aliquippa band called The Hi-Fidelics. While attending California State University of Pennsylvania, White said he naturally gravitated toward the developing sounds of the new soul band in town, Rare Experience.\n\nAs time would have it, music remains his passion and vocation. In the past 20 years, White has performed at several internationally renowned music shows, such as Montreux, Essence and Newport jazz festivals. White, a father of two adult children, said he learned his basic skills while hanging out at the Beaver Falls Elks Club and closely observing drummers Kenny “KT” Thompson, Bobby Crutcher and Cecil Washington of Pittsburgh.\n\nThough he still plays bass guitar, Billy “Whit” Whitaker, 62, mostly performs on Sundays at Missouri City Baptist Church in Houston, Texas. Since his early days, his musicianship has evolved into a lead vocal realm, a la Luther Vandross. He has passed his bass playing skills onto a son, Chuck, whom he describes as “having passed me up, skill-wise.” Chuck has performed with neo-soul singer Eryka Badu and also at Missouri City Baptist Church. Whitaker, a college graduate, is divorced, has five children and three grandchildren, and is a semi-retired executive in the senior citizen health industry.\n\nWhitaker credited Melvin Steals, then an English teacher at the high school, for providing the band with their name.\n\nAs Tyson explained, “Originally, we were Black Expedition. But Dr. Steals said we needed something more unique and marketable — and he suggested Rare Experience.”\n\nSteals and his brother, Mervin, composed the megahit song, “Could It Be I’m Falling in Love,” performed by The Spinners.\n\nSylvester “Boutique” Price, 63, is no longer the energetic frontman that typified Rare Experience, a la David Ruffin, Dennis Edwards or Marvin Gaye mode. These days Price utilizes his impact on Sunday morning church revelers as an assistant evangelist at Christian Lighthouse in downtown Aliquippa. He holds on to those precious memories of his early years with Rare Experience.\n\n“Some of the best years of my life. I have no regrets. I had a wonderful childhood, and being in the band was a major part of it,” he added.\n\nHaving grown up in the quaint West Aliquippa section of Logstown, Price was initially influenced by his father and lead singer, Roosevelt Price and The Price Boys gospel quintet, also featuring his dad’s brothers.\n\n“They were from rural Mississippi, so they had sort of a country flavor,” he said.\n\n“In junior high, I sang in school choirs and played some guitar,” Price said. The nickname “Boutique” stuck, due to his penchant for wearing the latest clothing gear.\n\n“I always had a knack for wearing sharp outfits — and shopping at boutiques, hence the nickname Boutique, which later evolved into the ‘Bo-Teek’ pronunciation,\" he explained.\n\nAs the fourth of eight children, Price also had a love for athletics. By high school, he was starting quarterback on the Aliquippa football team and a basketball star. He earned a full athletic scholarship to Tuskegee University in Alabama. But after a year, returned home and got a job at Westinghouse. Price was married by 1979, and like Tyson, both young family men opted not to move South to fulfill Rare Experience's musical dreams.\n\n“The music is still in me,” said Price. “Unlike some secular artists, the band world initially influenced my gospel world. For me, it all started playing in bands. And, now it’s instilled in me on Sunday mornings. It’s kinda flipped from lots of other Black musicians.”\n\nChurch was a common thread\n\nStill, a common thread that existed among Rare Experience members was their spiritual ties.\n\nAbercrombie noted the bond between Whitaker and himself when they formed the rhythm section for the Church in the Round's music ministry. Other area church affiliation with group members are Bethel Baptist, St. John’s, St. Titus, Christian Lighthouse, Triedstone Baptist, Tabernacle Baptist, Second Baptist, Waymen Chapel, Deliverance Temple, Ebenezer AME, Sound the Alarm Ministries, Bethel AME and Mount Olive Baptist Church.\n\nPrice said he still enjoys secular music, but from another view.\n\n“Now, I enjoy watching my son and my nephews playing and singing,” he said.\n\nHis son, Anthony Price, is a well-respected gospel keyboardist, while his nephew, Phillipe Price, plays bass with the Bill Henry Band, a top Pittsburgh soul band. Another nephew, Christian Norman, plays gospel keys, drums and bass guitar in Pittsburgh.\n\nPrice and wife Roulette Jefferson Price have been married 41 years. She sings in the Christian Lighthouse Ministries choir. The couple met when Rare Experience performed at the legendary Mason’s Hotel & Lounge in her hometown of New Kensington.\n\nFor “Duck” Abercrombie, his musical career originated as a trumpet player in school bands, but his Aliquippa High School band director, Ron Romeo, recognized his rhythmic skills and moved him into the drumline. He also played drums with organist brother, Wayne Abercrombie. The duo was often found in area churches playing spiritual music. Duck’s father, Frank Abercrombie, played piano and worked as a crane operator at J&L Steel. His mom, Ida Mae Taylor Abercrombie, was a nurse and also worked at J&L.\n\n\"I also played in my father’s band,” he said.\n\nAs a native Aliquippian, Abercrombie has a solid knowledge of all the early members of Rare Experience, in addition to a keen recollection of many other Aliquippa area musicians.\n\nHe credited older musicians like William “B.E.” Taylor, Mickey Cherico and Ray DeLisio for their welcoming attitude to help the band develop as young music businessmen.\n\nWAMO-FM radio account executive Philip Billingsea recalled B.E. Taylor as a neighbor.\n\n“We grew up in the 'Hollar' (Valley Terrace area), attended McDonald Elementary School together, on through our 1969 high school graduation. B.E. was always genuine when it came to Black people. Never a phony,” Billingslea said.\n\nTyson also credited The Granati Brothers and owners of Brighton Music Center for their support when the band was in its beginning stages.\n\nAbercrombie, 63, and his wife of 21 years, Tamyka Allison Abercrombie, live in Aliquippa and are the parents of two college-educated children. He vividly recalled his football glory days when he starred in the Aliquippa backfield with quarterback and Rare Experience bandmate Sylvester Price.\n\nA career union truck driver, Abercrombie retired from the McDanel Corp. in Beaver Falls. Abercrombie credited Sounds Unlimited, a band featuring ex-Motown bassist Eugene “Woody” Smith and bandleader Ronnie Cox, for keeping Beaver County’s soul music flame alive in the new millennium.\n\n“I subbed for their drummer, KT Thompson, on occasion. I really enjoyed their vibe,” Abercrombie said.\n\nMusic vs. sports\n\nTyson said he doesn’t criticize today’s local youth for not gravitating to bands as his generation once did.\n\n“It’s a different era,\" Tyson said. \"Today’s young people have technology and sports to pull from. When we were in school, we didn’t have the sports success.\n\n\"Today, there’s a chance they can at least get a good education through sports. They can aspire to be Ty Law, Tony Dorsett or Darrelle Revis — they see it, and they believe it can happen,” said Tyson, who lives in Center Township with his wife of 33 years, Lori Griffin Tyson. They are the parents of three adult children and one grandson.\n\nTyson also serves on the audio-visual ministries staff at Macedonia Baptist Church in Pittsburgh.\n\nAbercrombie noted, “There are so many people to thank for our development. It really was a village who supported us — our parents knew this took us off the streets and kept us out of trouble.\"\n\n'Wizard' helps the group evolve\n\nWhile he’s considered the baby of the bunch, during Rare Experience's formative years, Reginald “Wizard” Jones, now 58, was also considered the group’s most gifted member.\n\nAs the son of the talented organist George Jones, “Wizard” grew up on the road playing guitar and organ with his father’s bands. Though he’s now considered a household name in Atlanta's competitive R&B community, he credited his early onstage experiences as “many teachable moments.”\n\n“Unlike today’s artists who may record a YouTube or Instagram video, and hope for several 'likes' from their friends and relatives, we did it the hard way. Rehearse to get a gig, and prove to the club owner that you can fill his/her room, sell drinks and sell food,\" he said.\n\n“That’s the difference from how we did it years ago to now. The road was our teacher — we learned how to work the audience, and to respond to audience reaction. Today, it’s more about the computer and the technology or maybe a one-time TV appearance.”\n\nThough Rare Experience never reached major acclaim as a recording group in Atlanta, Jones has worked as music director for the nationally televised \"Soul Train Awards,\" as well as being keyboardist and music director for Outkast, TLC and Toni Braxton.\n\nTyson remembered when Jones joined the group.\n\n“We heard about this young kid who was very talented, so we inquired. At the time, he was the only one with an amplifier,” Tyson said, crediting Romeo for allowing Jones to develop his skills while arranging music charts for the marching band. “All that experience set him up to become ‘the Wizard’ that we all respect, love and appreciate.\"\n\nDrummer Maurice Otey lives in Nagoya, Japan, and still plays drums after carving out a successful music career. He’s married with children, according to members. His brother, bassist Michael Otey, still lives in Atlanta, has children and plays music on a more limited basis compared with his former bandmates.\n\n“Winky” Pettis is a music mogul in Shanghai, China. While a student at the Unniversity of Pittsburgh, his ties to Nathan Davis, chairman of Pitt’s Jazz Department, allowed him and Sewickley’s Rex Rideout opportunities to tour with jazz greats such as Roy Ayers and Grover Washington Jr. Though his skills were comparable to his contemporaries such as Kirk Whalum and Najee, Pettis took his saxophone talents to another level in Japan and China.\n\n“Over there, he’s on a par with a Quincy Jones,” Abercrombie said.\n\nPettis, a Quigley High School graduate, is also a married family man.\n\nJones noted that of all the players that originally left Aliquippa in January 1983, no one has returned.\n\n“Though we didn’t reach our ultimate goal as a group, we were able to leave home, establish careers and never have to return — only to visit families for special occasions. We call that success,” he said.\n\nPotential record deals with MCA, Polydor and SOLAR records never came to fruition, Jones said. “But, we never let that stop us.” The group enjoyed agency top-status for engagements throughout Southeast Conference university campuses, he said.\n\nWhen the band held a reunion show during Aliquippa Days in September 2011, Thea Austin and Michael Otey were the only former Rare Experience members unable to attend due to previous obligations. Vocalist Stephanie Townsend attended the event in what would be her final appearance with the band. Not long after the special performance, she died of cancer.\n\nPaulette and Thea\n\nWhen the band decided to make the trek to Atlanta in January 1983, female vocalist/keyboardist Paulette Caperris also made the trip. An audition produced a reliable replacement vocalist for Townsend — Thea Austin of Clairton, who was also studying at Pitt, as was Pettis.\n\n“I was proud to be chosen to join the band,” said Austin, now living in Hollywood, California. “The guys were highly talented and were from respectable families. I recall practicing at Reggie’s house in the basement. Mama (Betty) Jones would feed us after every rehearsal — they looked after me like another family member.\n\n\"We had a special bond — truly a ‘rare experience.’ I’m glad to have been a part of the group,” Austin said. “I’m honored.”\n\nAustin was among the Rare Experience members who relocated to Atlanta: Jones, Smith, Caperris, Jackson, White and the Otey brothers.\n\nJones said Austin’s role was primarily as a recording soloist, while Capperis was as a keyboardist/vocalist, which created a more diverse front-stage presence.\n\nWhen the band’s plans didn't pan out, Austin said she returned to Pittsburgh and joined a 1950s revue band and a jazz trio. Soon after, she moved to Los Angeles, where she joined forces with the group, SNAP, and was affiliated with mega hip-hop/pop hits, “I Got the Power” and “Rhythm is a Dancer.” She learned to play the guitar and also records and programs computer tracks and writes new music, including a Steelers Nation tribute she hopes will catch on as the team's NFL playoff hopes ascend.\n\n“My life still centers around music, and probably always will,” said Austin, who started singing in elementary school, and later sang at weddings and funerals at her hometown Morningside Baptist Church in Clairton.\n\nTed B. “Rook” Lewis was a self-described “OG” for the original band. At 73, he now lives in Oakland, California, but served multi-roles with the early group, including emcee and hype-man, roadie and sound engineer.\n\n“Whatever the need was, I stepped in,” said Lewis, a nine-time grandfather with three adult children. The 1966 Aliquippa graduate has two tweeners from a new marriage.\n\nRare Experience was more than music to Beaver County, said Anthony B. Mitchell, a professor at Penn State University Greater Allegheny. He has the distinction of growing up in Aliquippa and Beaver Falls during Rare Experience's soul music supremacy in Beaver County.\n\n“Rare Experience emerged on the Pittsburgh area music scene in the mid-1970s during the apex of the Black Power, Black arts movement,” Mitchell said. “It’s significant that during this Black conscious period, the band’s ensemble of vocalists and musicians creatively blended R&B, funk and jazz into a joyous musical experience.”\n\nMitchell attended Geneva College during that period and fondly recalled “what made Rare Experience an all-time show band.\"\n\n“As a young group of African-American males, they instilled racial pride in ‘Aliquippians’ and African Americans in Beaver County. The young ladies were also gifted,” he said. \"Collectively, their musical gifts and skills embodied their upbringing in the Black church and training in African American musical traditions.\"\n\nMitchell said Rare Experience should be elected to Beaver Valley Musicians Hall of Fame. \"They are well-deserved.” Jones was inducted as an individual into the Hall of Fame in spring 2017.\n\n\"For those of us privileged to have witnessed and grooved with this ‘soul-stirring’ legendary band,\" he said, \"their legacy remains intact.\"\n\nRodney “Duck” Abercrombie also contributed to this article.\n\nTimothy Cox is a Beaver Falls native and professional musician. He has a journalism degree from Point Park University and attended Slippery Rock University and Community College of Beaver County. He’s also a former employee of Aliquippa’s Jones & Laughlin Steel Corp. and the B.F. Jones Library. Cox can be reached at teacawks2@gmail.com."
