        "text": "The Holden Heights neighborhood has long desired youth programming to help meet the needs of our residents and families. The repurposing of Grand Avenue will provide an opportunity to relocate and expand on the youth programming to this area. The intended full-sized gymnasium is also an added investment in the Holden Heights neighborhood.\n\nThe Pottery Studio has grown in size and popularity in recent years and has nearly outgrown its space within the Downtown Recreation Complex. The new location at Grand Avenue will allow for a larger space for the studio with room for its programs and membership to grow. There will be room for larger working areas and additional storage.\n\nA key part of the city’s strategic growth plan is recognizing, preserving and celebrating our past and honoring our history. The city acquiring and repurposing Grand Avenue Elementary School further supports the city’s historic preservation efforts and the preservation of this community resource.\n\nThe Grand Avenue Elementary School building was designated as a Historic Landmark by the city on February 13, 1995. It features Mediterranean Revival architecture. As a historical landmark, any exterior work or demolition would be subject to our Historic Preservation process.\n\nThe 12-acre Grand Avenue Park surrounding the school is getting a renovation set to begin over the summer of 2020 thanks to the National Recreation and Park Association’s 10th annual Parks Build Community project.\n\nThe City of Orlando would like to thank the National Recreation and Park Association and their generous donors for supporting the 2020 Parks Build Community project at Grand Ave Park. These in-kind equipment and service donations total over $450,000.\n\nThe substantial equipment and service donations are from the following corporations:\n\nGreenfields Outdoor Fitness\n\nGameTime\n\nBCI Burke Company\n\nPlayCore\n\nMusco Lighting\n\nGared Holdings\n\nEpic Outdoor Cinema\n\nDuMor\n\nUltraSite\n\nForeverLawn\n\nShade Systems, Inc.\n\nFreenotes Harmony Park\n\nMost Dependable Fountains\n\nPorter/Poligon Corp\n\nRenovations are expected to be completed by April 2021.\n\nThe slab has been poured and the walls of the new gym and Orlando Pottery Studio are now standing. Residents nearby can expect to see the following as the City of Orlando works to turn the historic school into a state-of-the-art neighborhood center while renovating the park:\n\nInstallation of beams and joists\n\nCompletion of the roof over the new parts of the facility\n\nBeginning of the installation of utilities\n\nContinuation of renovations to historical building\n\nCompletion of park renovations"
