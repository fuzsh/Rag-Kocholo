        "text": "Last updated on August 07, 2024\n\nThe City of Orlandoâ€™s Public Works Department announces the construction of a new, state-of-the-art 15,913 square-foot, four-bay Fire Station. This project, overseen by the Public Works Department with its contractor, H.J. High Construction, marks a significant milestone in enhancing the safety and efficiency of our community's emergency response services.\n\nLocated at 3900 East Concord Street, the new Fire Station 6 will replace the current station, which has exceeded its useful life. This new facility is strategically positioned to provide more central access to key areas including East Colonial, Orlando Fashion Square Mall, Baldwin Park, Milk District, and the Orlando Executive Airport. This prime location will ensure rapid response times during emergencies, enhancing the overall safety and well-being of our residents.\n\nThe new Fire Station 6 will feature improved living spaces for our first responders and ample storage for essential equipment and vehicles. This modern facility will support our emergency personnel in their critical work, providing them with the resources they need to serve our community effectively.\n\nWhile construction is underway, emergency services will continue uninterrupted.\n\nLocation"
