He passed away in 2014 at the age of 70, just hours after his wife, Lynn, had died.\n\nGlen Kawa\n\nThe Weber High, University of Utah and Utah State University alumnus was a familiar figure at state high school wrestling tournaments for a generation. The affable educator worked 23 state wrestling tournaments and finals during a long and impressive career. A longtime educator at Kearns High, Kawa was a favorite of coaches and athletic directors. Much of that admiration was due to his obvious concern and affinity for prep athletes. He was a familiar figure on the west side of the Salt Lake Valley during his distinguished career.\n\nGerald “Gerry” Leonard\n\nTo say that Gerry Leonard loved officiating would be an understatement. He umpired baseball from 1970 to 2015 in youth leagues, high schools, American Legion, NCAA Division I and the professional Pioneer League. He also refereed prep basketball for eight years. Leonard said the highlights of his long career were the lasting relationships he established with crews, coaches, players and school administrators.

Littlewood, who graduated from BYU, is married to Dani and has five children.\n\nMiles Kim Nelson\n\nCody, Wyo., native Kim Nelson has spent a lifetime in high school sports as a teacher, coach, athletic director and official.

He was the Utah High School Activities Association male official of the year in 2000 and the Utah County Association official of the year in 2014. He and wife, Leslie, are parents of eight children.\n\nKarl Richins\n\nWhen folks say that “he wrote the book” on officiating, they could be talking about Idaho native Karl Rich. The coordinator of football officials for the Big Sky Conference wrote a book called “Penalty Enforcements Made Easy.” That was one of the Salt Lake City resident’s many officiating credentials. He has officiated games in the Big 12, Mountain West, and Big Sky. Since 2012, he has been a director of the Stars and Stripes Academy for College Football Officials. Richins, who began his career as a high school referee, has officiated in the Capitol One, Outback, Cotton and Houston Bowls as well as the 1999 Football Championship Subdivision Playoffs. Richins retired as a federal probation officer.\n\nLarry Sanich\n\nThough known primarily as a prep football and basketball official, the East Carbon High, University of Utah and BYU graduate remembers one Big Sky game in particularly. It was the Montana-Montana State football game at Missoula, where the packed stadium crowd produced deafening noise. Sanich officiated basketball for 18 years and football for 19 in addition to junior college and college officiating. The high school and math teacher began refereeing in 1980 for basketball games. He was honored to work three state championship football games, four Rotary Bowls and the 2002 Junior College National Championship Game.
