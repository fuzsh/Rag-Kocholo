        "text": "Here's a quote from a resident of Fort McMurray before the oil boom...... \"I lived in Fort McMurray from 1963-1965 before big oil moved in. There was 1200 people living in Waterways/Fort McMurray. I can tell you at that time oil was seeping into the Athabasca River, and we were told not to eat the fish from it, the Clearwater was ok. You could tell where the oil sands were located as the trees were stunted, twisted and deformed. There were plenty of tar pits that would trap animals. My sister and I laugh at the environmentalists when they say the oil companies are destroying the region, when in fact the oil companies are cleaning up natures oil spill and returning it to a pristine forest and lakes. Though I would say that none of these environmentalists were born before the oil companies started to clean it up or even their parents likely never even heard of the tar sands region, as when I lived in Fort Mac the only way you could get to there was by air or train, there was no highway. So instead of attacking the oil industry we should applaud them for cleaning up an oil spill made by nature ....... That's the trouble with these so called green people, they only hear and shout out the propaganda they have been paid for and know nothing of the past history... Can't believe there is such a following of the chicken littles.\" #oilindustry #oil #people"
