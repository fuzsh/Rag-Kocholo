With 18 years of direct hospital experience, she has become an expert in health systems management and now focuses on policy improvement and development. As over half her experience was spent in overseas environments, she developed dual interests in furthering global health through humanitarian assistance initiatives and a community-specific goal of improving adolescent suicidality in those associated with the military forces. Seeing the urgent mental health crisis emerging in the last several years and developing firsthand interventions in austere environments, she chose the latter to focus her dissertation studies on. Working with an interdisciplinary team, she employs mixed methods techniques to examine institutional, community, and familial associations driving adolescent suicidality and analyzes moderating and mediating factors influencing these relationships.\n\nIn addition to her studies, Edmonson is also the co-chair of the department’s PhD Colloquium series–a series of academic conferences and panels for the benefit of the faculty and student body, is part of a group developing the department’s first student mentorship program, and assists in sponsoring incoming students each year.\n\nEducation\n\nMaster’s, Health Administration and Policy, 2013, Uniformed Services University\n\nResearch Interests\n\nAdolescent & Veteran mental health and suicidality\n\nNouran Ghanem\n\nBio\n\nNouran Ghanem is a health policy consultant with the MITRE Corporation, which operates the nation’s Health Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC) in the public interest, serving U.S. Dept. of Health and Human Services (HHS) agencies on special research projects spanning health policy, public health, health security, and health delivery system needs. She currently serves in leadership roles leading teams on complex research deliverables with compressed timelines. Prior to joining MITRE, Nouran served in a research capacity across multiple health policy settings in the D.C. area, including with the George Mason University Health Administration and Policy (HAP) Department.\n\nShe has received numerous accolades for exemplary project outcomes and leadership with her current organization and is the recipient of the Graduate Award for Excellence in Health Policy, awarded for her performance in the Health Policy Master’s program. In college, she participated in policy debate and consistently received a number of awards for her performance at competitive tournaments.\n\nNouran is pursuing her third social science degree with GMU and is currently in the post-coursework phase of the Health Services Research PhD program.\n\nPublications\n\nGimm, G., Goldberg, D., Ghanem, N., Haghighat, S., Want, J., Hough, D., & Nichols, L.

Her prior work as an applied epidemiologist has led her to the path of bridging three disciplines – epidemiology, data science, and health policy - to continue making an impact in our understanding of population health dynamics. She has worked in the areas of emerging and chronic disease surveillance (Zika, post-Zika birth defects, COVID-19), child and maternal health, and in public health consulting (global health non-profit, molecular diagnostics). She hopes that her work helps to influence policies that promote innovation and strengthening of the U.S. public health infrastructure. Her particular area of focus is EHR-based disease surveillance systems that apply machine learning and AI techniques.\n\nElina is a founding member of a PhD student group, along with Kerry Goetz (PhD Candidate), Mary Lou Pomeroy, Ph.D. and Tammy Jones, Ph.D., who came together and organized, with the support of HAP faculty, a PhD Student Colloquium Series in Spring of 2021. She continues to be actively involved in this effort of building a community within the department and across the College of Public Health, raise awareness of ongoing research across departments and among graduate students as well as engage with HAP alumni.\n\nPublications\n\nGuralnik E.

He received his B.A. in Public Health Studies from Johns Hopkins University in 2008 (Phi Beta Kappa) and Doctor of Pharmacy (Pharm.D.) from University of California San Diego Skaggs School of Pharmacy & Pharmaceutical Sciences in 2014. He received his S.M. (Master of Science) in Epidemiology with concentration in Pharmacoepidemiology from the T.H. Chan Harvard School of Public Health in 2015.\n\nDr. Kim is currently an Associate Professor of Pharmacy Administration at the Bernard J. Dunn School of Pharmacy at Shenandoah University. Dr. Kim has a passion in merging public health discipline with pharmacy. Before he started his pharmacy school, he worked at the Baltimore County Department of Health as an H1N1 Public Health Investigator to plan and execute H1N1 mass vaccination clinics for Baltimore County residents. He also monitored influenza-like illness (ILI) and H1N1 outbreaks in K-12 Baltimore County Public Schools.\n\nDuring Dr. Kim’s pharmacy education, he gained additional public health pharmacy experience working as a Junior Commissioned Officer Student Training & Extern Program (JRCOSTEP) through the United States Public Health Service. Dr. Kim worked as a Commissioned Officer (Rank: Ensign, O-1) under the Navajo Reservation (Indian Health Service) site in Tsaile Health Center, near Four Corners area.\n\nUpon receiving his Pharm.D., Dr. Kim embarked another public health journey at the T.H. Chan School of Public Health. Dr. Kim learned pharmacoepidemiology methods from experts in secondary database management: Research methods utilizing administrative health data to conduct epidemiological studies, particularly in medication exposure, medication safety, and evidence-based pharmacy practice.\n\nDr. Kim is pursuing PhD in Health Services Research at George Mason University under research guidance from Dr. Panagiota Kitsantas. He is conducting secondary database research projects in the realm of substance abuse, pharmaceutical health services research, and maternal health outcomes using national survey. He is particularly interested in polysubstance use (concurrent use of more than one substance) of various licit and illicit substances among women in reproductive age.\n\nPublications\n\n*Corresponding author\n\nGreen AM, Brackbill M, Harralson AF and Kim SH* Coding for an anticoagulant: systematic review of pharmacogenetics-guided warfarin therapy on the therapeutic and adverse clinical events on patients with atrial fibrillation, pulmonary embolism, and deep vein thrombosis.
