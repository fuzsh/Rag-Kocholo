        "text": "A lottery was held on March 1 to select students for Highline Public Schools and Schools and Programs of Choice.\n\nThis includes CHOICE Academy, Big Picture Schools, Highline Virtual Academy, Maritime High School, Raisbeck Aviation High School (RAHS), Highline Virtual Elementary at Seahurst, the International Baccalaureate (IB) program offered at Mount Rainier High School and the Waskowitz Environmental Leadership Service program at Tyee High School.\n\nWhen there are more applicants than can be admitted, students are selected by lottery from the pool of eligible candidates. To be eligible, students submitted a completed application by January 31.\n\nThe admissions process is designed to accommodate the growing number of applications while maintaining each school's high-quality educational program.\n\nIf you are selected in the lottery, you will be invited to a commitment conversation meeting. Your assignment will not be finalized until that meeting occurs and you confirm your intent to attend. You may be instructed to complete additional steps once you confirm your intent to attend.\n\nYou must confirm your intent and schedule your meeting before April 1, 2024.\n\nYour seat will be offered to another student on the waitlist if you fail to confirm your intent and schedule your meeting by the deadline. Students will be pulled from the waitlist following spring break starting April 10, 2024.\n\nWaitlist Questions? Please contact the individual school for updated waitlist information."
