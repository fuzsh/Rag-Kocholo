        "text": "DALLAS – Congressman Colin Allred announced he earned the endorsement of the Texas Democratic Veterans. Allred has worked with both parties to deliver for Texas veterans, including leading a first-of-its-kind effort to get a vacant hospital donated to the Veterans Administration, resulting in the opening of the Garland VA Medical Center. Allred also worked with Congressman Jake Ellzey (R-TX) to pass a bill authorizing funding for VA medical facilities, including a new hospital in El Paso and a Spinal Cord Injury Center in Dallas, which a Dallas-area veteran called a“godsend.”\n\nTed Cruz has a history of playing politics with veterans’ benefits. He led an effort to delay the passage of the PACT Act and then celebrated it by fist bumping his colleague. He faced “fierce criticism for delaying [the] landmark veterans bill.” Cruz also repeatedly voted against funding the VA, including critical expansions of benefits.\n\n“Texas will soon have the most veterans of any state, and it is incredibly important our veterans can easily access the benefits they have earned,” said Allred. “Helping our veterans is a uniting force in our nation, and I will never let politics get in the way of that. In the Senate, I will work to build on our success in securing the Garland VA, passing the PACT Act and Gold Star Families Tax Relief Act, cutting red tape and investing in VA facilities across our state.”"
