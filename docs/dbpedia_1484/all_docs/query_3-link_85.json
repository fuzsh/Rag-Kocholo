        "text": "In 1891, the Olympia Tribune published a souvenir issue, consisting of 22 bound pages that were printed and bound at the State Printing Office. The issue contained information on the State of Washington, and on Olympia in particular. It included short biographies and photographs of many of Olympia’s prominent citizens, as well as descriptions and images of several of the businesses, churches, and other institutions. As a companion to this website’s “Residents” and “Where Are We?”projects, we are including transcriptions of some of the biographies contained in the Souvenir Issue, and reproductions of the photographs. These will be added to as time permits. The State Library plans to upload a viewable version of this issue in the future, and links will be provided here.\n\nThe original biographies were not in alphabetical order: we have placed them in alphabetical order here for easier access. You may also consult the “Residents” section of this website for further information about the families and people included. Thank you intern Christina Schaller for some of the transcriptions. Following the biographies are reproductions of the images included in the issue, with links, where applicable, to Where Are We? webpages.\n\nArchibald H. Adams, real estate and insurance broker, was born in New York in 1844. In 1855 he removed to Milwaukee, Wis., where he graduated from the high school and entered into the wholesale drug business in 1859. At the breaking out of the rebellion he enlisted as a private in the Twenty-fourth Wisconsin volunteer infantry and served throughout the war, returning in 1866 as captain in the Thirty-fifth Wisconsin volunteer infantry. He then again entered the drug business, and in the same firm, where he stayed until 1884, when he went to Chicago. Mr. Adams is one of the largest real estate handlers in the city, and by prompt attention and honorable dealing his business is steadily and rapidly increasing.\n\nTwo of the most enterprising young business men of this city are J.P. and B.C. Armstrong, who opened a dry goods store here March 17, 1889. They came to Olympia from Chicago, where for many years they had followed their profession, acquiring a thorough knowledge of the dry goods business. Early in 1889 they came to Washington seeking a location to open business for themselves and after visiting the principal cities on Puget Sound they settled in Olympia, attracted by its superior advantages for their line of business. Their business career has been marked with more than ordinary enterprise and their fast increasing trade has twice compelled them to enlarge their store which now ranks among the first in the city. They have always shown a liberal disposition and have given largely to all enterprises that have in any way been a benefit to the business of this city. A short time ago the firm name was changed to B.C. Armstrong, under which name the business is now conducted, and all persons who wish to do business with a straightforward and conscientious house will do well to visit the store and examine the new and elegant stock of B.C. Armstrong.\n\nOliver Baker, real estate and insurance broker, was born on Cape Cod, Massachusetts, where his early boyhood was spent. In 1861 he went to Boston to learn the carpet business with one of the leading carpet houses on Washington street. He was married in 1864, and came to Cleveland, Ohio, where he was engaged with one of the leading carpet and drapery houses of the western reserve. After being there three years he was admitted to a partnership, and three years after went into business for himself at Akron, Ohio. After good success he opened a branch store at Canton, in the same state. In 1874 he opened a large establishment in Cleveland on Euclid avenue. In 1879 the firm of Baker, Sterling & Co was organized at Toledo, Ohio, and in 1884 Mr. Baker organized the Lima Carpet Co. In 1885 he opened business at St. Paul, Minn., the house being known as late as 1889 as the Oliver Baker Carpet Co. Mr. Baker came to Olympia in the spring of 1890 to engage in the real estate brokerage business under the firm name of Oliver Baker. The venture was successful from the start, and in August of the same year Mr. A.H. Adams, of Chicago, became a partner, under the firm name of Baker & Adams. At this writing the firm is about to be dissolved, Mr. Baker resuming his own firm name. Mr. Baker is a progressive, pushing citizen, who has won his own way in the world.\n\nS.H. Barbee was born March 25, 1853, at Oskaloosa, Iowa. His parents came from Indiana with the first white settlers to Iowa. When he was but one year old they migrated to Western Iowa, settling near Council Bluffs, where his early life was spent on his father’s farm. Imbued with the spirit of his parents, and with “Westward ho!” (his mother named him Horace,) he left the farm at the age of twenty years. He came to Puget Sound and engaged in teaching school at old Fort Nisqually, and remained two years. He then returned home, but soon started for the Black Hills to engage in mining. Not making a “strike,” he shortly returned to Iowa and engaged in the live stock business, successfully conducting one of the largest and finest stock farms in the state. In 1885 he engaged in the real estate busines in Council Bluffs. In the early part of 1888 he returned with his family to Puget Sound, settling at Tacoma, and entering the loan busines. There had been a wonderful change in the sixten years of his absence. He remained there until 1889, when he came to Olympia, he realizing that this would be a large city, and that Tacoma and Seattle had already reached their best. In 1890, with six others, he purchased Puget City, and incorporated the Portland and Puget City Company of which he is secretary. This is a thriving little town, and was selected by Benjamin Holiday as the terminus of the Union Pacific Railway. The location is midway between Tacoma and Olympia. This is only one of the many fine opportunities Mr. Barbee has for his patrons. He has some of the finest additions in the city, but he surely struck the key note in the Second Capital addition. Lots here have doubled in the past six months, and the electric car line survey passes directly through it. He again proved his foresight when he purchased the entire townsite of Port Orchard, where the United States government dry dock will be located. He is selling lots here within the reach of all working men and others who want a home in a brisk, bustling city, where the noise of the hammer and sawmill will always be heard, as this is the only town that adjoins the navy yard.\n\nGeorge A. Barnes, ex-mayor of Olympia, and the present president of the Chamber of Commerce, is one of Oregon’s oldest pioneers, and was born in Brockport, Munroe County, New York, in 1821. He received a common school education, and in early life followed the occupation of a clerk in a general store. In 1848 he crossed the plains and settled in Oregon City, Oregon, where he spent the winter of ’48 and ’49. In May, ’49, he went to the mines in California, where he stayed about a year, and then returned to the east by the way of the Isthmus of Panama. In 1850 he crossed the plains a second time, and located in Portland, Oregon, where he engaged in the merchandising business until 1852, when he came to Olympia. Here he has resided ever since, and for thirty years he has lived in the house which he erected in 1860, on Fourth Street. For fifteen years Mr. Barnes was engaged in merchandising here, and he then started a bank which he conducted for 12 years, when he sold out, and has since been engaged in looking after his own property and in the real estate business. Although so well along in years, he does not have the appearance of being nearly his real age. Mr. Barnes was president of the board of trustees during the time of the town government, and was mayor the year that President Hayes visited Olympia as the guest of the town. He has been president of the Chamber of Commerce for the past two years. He has always had faith in the future of Olympia, and has done much to make the city the flourishing municipality that it is to-day.\n\nClarence M.

He has a general supervision of the company’s system in Gray’s Harbor.\n\nWilliam W. Bettman, one of Olympia’s young and enterprising business men, was born in this city on February 25, 1866. His early education was secured here, but he was afterwards sent to Portland where he entered the public schools, and at the age of 18 years entered into business at Castle Rock, where he continued for four years. Disposing of his enterprise there, he returned back to Olympia and entered the establishment of his father on Main street, where he has since continued. Mr. Bettman is prominent in the younger social circles of the city. He is the national secretaryof the Ancient Order of Foresters, and takes a deep interest in the work of that order.\n\nAmong the recent additions to Olympia’s business houses is the firm of Bilger & Going, who, though established here less than three months ago, has secured a firm hold on the buying public of this city. … Mr. W.L. Bilger is a native of Oregon, and has been for eight years connected with the well known hardware firm of Honeyman, De Hart & Company, at Portland, six years of which he has been one of that firm’s most trusted traveling salesman [sic]\n\nW.W. Binheimer, the leader [of the Capital City Band], was born in Fairfield, Iowa, August 26, 1862. In 1867 his parents removed to Keokuk, Iowa, in 1871 to Farmington, Iowa, and shortly after to Bonapart, in the same state. After getting a common school education Mr. Binheimer, at the age of fifteen years, commenced traveling in a musical organization, where he laid the foundation for the fine musical education which he now enjoys. He followed this profession for ten years, visiting and reaping the musical advantages of all the cities of prominence in the United States. In 1887 he started in the plumbing business in Egan, South Dakota, where he also led and taught the Glenwood Band for two years. He then married and removed to Olympia, where he works diligently at his trade. Under his leadership the Capital City Band has acquired a proficiency that would do credit to an eastern metropolis.

Blake [of the firm Whitham, Page and Blake] was for eleven years a successful railroad engineer, being in the employ during that time of the O.R. & N Co., the N.P.R.R., the U.P.R.R. and Hunt’s, and recently a member of the well known firm of Wold, Blake & Otness, civil engineers, Tacoma.\n\nW. A. Botkin has lately established, at 609 Fourth street, in the new opera house building, a store which he has well stocked for the wholesale handling of the highest grades of wines, liquors and cigars. Though he has been in business here only since January 19, Mr. Botkin has established himself as one of Olympia’s most reliable tradesmen and gathered around him a class of custom which is in every way desirable. He guarantees all goods to be as represented. Among his brands of whisky are the Chesterfield, the Sterling Silver, the T. W. Samuels and the Salvator Storgo, Old Tom Burke, Hazelwood and many other choice brands for which Mr. Botkin holds the exclusive agency in the Northwest. His stock of wines both American and imported, has been selected with a completeness which would tempt an epicure, and his price on all classes of goods is extremely moderate when quality is taken into consideration.\n\nColonel Thomas Henderson Boyd although a resident of Tacoma is, by virtue of his appointment as special agent of the United States census department to collect manufacturing statistics of the state, with headquarters at Olympia, entitled to a place in the TRIBUNE’s gallery of prominent citizens. He was born in Pennsylvania thirty-four years ago and has been a resident of Washington two years. His father for many years has been recognized as one of the leading financiers and railroad magnates of the Keystone state, and his family on both sides since the days of Penn have been acknowledged leaders in society and in politics in the Eastern commonwealth. Colonel Boyd is a journalist by profession and has been connected with the leading papers of the state in positions of trust and emolument. He is a Republican in politics, and probably no newspaper man in Washington is so well or so widely known. He was recommnded by United States Senators Squire and Allen and Congressman Wilson for the office of collector of the port of Tacoma, but failed to secure the appointment because of a previous political quarrel with Collector Bradshaw. He was also a prominent candidate for the offices of United States Census Supervisor for the Western district, receiving the endorsement of 98 out of the 105 members of the legislature, and for both the Registership and Receivership of the Olympia land office. Latterly his name has been mentioned for the office of United States Surveyor General. When Hon. Walter J. Thompson was seeking the senatorship, a year and a half ago, he acted as that gentleman’s political manager, and in the late senatorial struggle he was one of Senator Squire’s most ardent supporters. At the present time he is a member of both the Pierce county Republican committee and the Republican city committee of Tacoma. Since coming to Washington Colonel Boyd has amassed considerable property.\n\nJames Brewer, senior member of the firm of Brewer & Wright, was born in Lane county, Oregon, March 20, 1859. In 1860 his parents moved to the southern part of Thurston county where his father took up land and engaged in stock raising. James was brought up on a farm and received a common school education.

His firm is now doing business at 622 Fourth street, and is the largest wholesale dealer in dressed beef, mutton, pork, veal, poultry, etc., in the county. Mr. Brewer is a republican in politics and is an active member among the young men of that party. He is straight forward in business and has a bright future before him.\n\nJohn S., a brother of James Brewer, was born on a farm in Thurston county, Washington, August 30, 1860, and like his brother obtained a common school education and a thorough knowledge of stock and stock raising. In 1883 he moved into Olympia and after serving an apprenticeship in the drug business gave his time and attention to the market and grocery business, part of the time looking after the retail departments of his brother’s business, which is now No. 622 Fourth street. It is a well-known fact that the Brewer boys are well versed and competent in every branch of the wholesale and retail butcher business.\n\nBurgess W. Brintnall, superintendent of schools of this city, was born in Medina county, Ohio, on September 10, 1857. He was educated at Lenox College, in Iowa, and first commenced to teach in common schools in that state three years before he graduated from college in 1876. He took charge of graded schools in 1878, and has been employed in that work ever since, with the exception of about one year and a half. He came to this city in 1887, in answer to a telegraphic summons to come and take charge of Olympia’s schools. Under his fostering care the enrollment has increased from about 300 scholars to over 800, and the teacher from five to fourteen. The city has built $60,000 of new school buildings, the construction of which Mr. Brintnall has personally superintended. He was instrumental in organizing the state teachers’ association, and aided in securing the passage of the state school law, through the last legislature serving as chairman of the legislative committee of the above association. Superintendent Brintnall was married in 1880, and has three children. The efficient and thorough schools of this city owe no little to his untiring energy in their behalf.\n\nFrank C.

In October following his graduation he left for Thurston county, Washington, arriving in Olympia the following month. He then began the pursuit of his chosen vocation and continued to be an earnest and energetic teacher in the common schools of the county up to November, 1890, when he, as the democratic nominee, was elected to the office of county school superintendent. In the administration of the affairs of his office he has shown himself to be fully identified with every interest tending to the good of the educational cause and of advantage to Thurston county.\n\nArthur L. Callow, city clerk of Olympia, was born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, on May 10, 1869. He came to this state with his parents in 1872, settling in Mason county, and has resided here ever since. He followed ranching and logging when old enough to work, but determined to acquire a better education than the schools of his neighborhood afforded; came to Olympia in 1887 for that purpose. He returned home the following year, but came back here after a few months, and was engaged in clerking and book-keeping until he was elected to the position which he now holds, on December 20th last. His fitness and perfect understanding for the position has been amply shown since he has held it and he enjoys the distinction of being the youngest city clerk in the state, if not the country.\n\nThos. H. Cavanaugh was born in Vincennes, Knox county, Indiana, March 8, 1844; was removed to St. Louis, Missouri, in 1845, and to Jacksonville, Illinois, in 1850. His father was a printer and publisher.

Chambers] is a native son of Washington, having been born on Chambers’ prairie, Thurston county, June 25, 1851, and is the present representative of his native county in Washington legislature. Though still on the better side of the prime of life, Mr. Chambers has lived to see the present State of Washington separated from Oregon and made a territory, and by means of its wonderful increase of population transplanted into the nation’s glory of states. His parents who were born in Missouri, were the pioneers of Thurston county, settling here in 1847, and are still living at their old homestead. Mr. Chambers’ boyhood was spent on the farm, and his early education was gleaned from the common schools. At the age of 19 he embarked in business for himself at Olympia. His shrewdness and business qualifications soon drew the attention of his fellow citizens, and he was called upon to serve his city as councilman, after which he became Olympia’s mayor, an office which he held for several terms. His business interests extend to several public enterprises, and the welfare of this city is always paramount to personal advantage. Naturally a student, Mr. Chambers has placed himself upon an equal footing with many who possessed collegiate advantages, which in his youth were unattainable in Washington, and he can safely be counted upon as one of Olympia’s staunchest citizens.\n\nJ. R. Chaplin, president of this company, is a living illustration of the possibilities of becoming a rich man in a short space of time in the wonderful Puget Sound country. Two years ago he came to Olympia with absolutely no capital at all. By judicious investment of his first earnings, carefully watching the real estate market, and placing his money here and there where it soon doubled, it was not long before he came to be looked upon as one of the progressive solid men of Olympia. Mr. Chaplin formerly occupied the pulpit of the Congregational church. He is a go-ahead man in every particular, and is the financial manager of the Congregational college which is to be established below Butler’s cove on the west side, and which he was mainly instrumental in bringing here. His partner, C. Thoreson, also a young man of good judgement and a thorough real estate man, is secretary and treasurer of the land company. Both are members of the board of trade, and active in all interests that affect the welfare of the state capital. Mr. Chaplin established brick yards in the vicinity of the city which gave employment to a large number of men. The land company own Woodruff’s addition on the west side and other tracts in the vicinity. Woodruff’s addition slopes gradually down to the shores of the bay, and is in full view of the whole city. One of the most beautiful mountain views is to be seen from this part of the city. Water has already been put into the streets here, and a great part of the avenues have been graded. A large part of the street improvements have been made, and many of the best known citizens of the city have either started residences there or will build during the coming summer, contracts having already been let for some very handsome private dwellings. The route for the new motor line has been surveyed through this addition, and this line will soon be in operation. Mr. Chaplin was born in Livingston county, Mich., on April 30, 1851. In early life he was a farmer, but at the age of 24 he entered Adrian college in his native state, and graduated in 1883. He then entered the ministry, in which calling he continued until 1890. He came to this state two years ago last January. On the organization of the Thurston County Land Company he was elected president, and in all that looks to the growth of his adopted city he takes an active interest. He is married and has four children.\n\nJoseph Cheim, one of the city’s best known merchants, was born in Posen, Prussia, on August 14, 1857. He received his education in his native land, and until 1871 worked in a clothing store there. He then came to Marysville, California, and was employed for twelve years with his uncle, Joseph Lask, in the same line of business. In 1883, Mr. Cheim came to Puget Sound and settled in Olympia, where he started “The White House,” and stocked it with clothing, gents’ furnishings, trunks, etc., and his trade has been increasing steadily from that time until the present. In 1888, Mr. Cheim married Miss Rosa, daughter of J. W. Davis, of San Francisco, the well-known inventor of the patent riveted overalls, and the manager for Levi, Strauss & Co. He has one child. He was for several years treasurer of the I. O. O. F. Mr. Cheim is a pushing and enterprising merchant, who has won his own way in life by his sterling integrity and business sagacity. Mr. Cheim has built up a large trade in his several lines, though always carrying for his customers the best that the market affords. He has always been one of the city’s pushing and progressive citizens, and has always confidently asserted that the future of the city would be a glowing one.\n\nJoseph Chilberg, city treasurer of Olympia, was born in Ottumwa, Wapello county, Iowa, on February 1, 1850. His early life was spent on a farm, and at the age of 21 he came to the Territory of Washington, settling in this city, where he engaged in the teaming and trucking business which he continued until 1875, when he went to school for a year. In 1876 he started in the grocery business as a clerk, and eighteen months later he engaged in the same line of business for himself, in which he continued until 1882, when he was burned out on Main street on the spot where he now has his office. He retired from business until 1887, when he became manager of a large grocery business opened by his father-in law, in which position he continued for about a year and a half, when the business was discontinued, and Mr. Chilberg engaged in the real estate business. He is now very largely interested in real estate in this vicinity, and owns and controls some of the best in Thurston county. He was elected to the position of city treasurer last December, and brings to this position a mind well trained for the important duties which he is called upon to perform. Mr. Chilberg is married and has one child, a girl of eleven years of age.\n\nA. H. Christopher, of the firm of O. L. Branson & Co., investment bankers and real estate brokers, in the TRIBUNE building, was born at St. Croix Falls, Wisconsin, in 1866. He secured his education first in common schools; then was employed, at the age of 14, as clerk in a general store until 17 years of age, when he entered the Curtiss Business College, St. Paul. At this institution he finished his educational career, remaining there two years. When 19 he went into the mercantile business as senior member of the firm of Christopher bros., general merchandise, at St. Croix for two years, and afterwards occupying the same position with the firm at Avery, Wis., for one and one-half years. After a successful term of business Mr. Christopher moved westward with a view of doing better. He went to Idaho, passing a month in that state, the came to Washington, his object being to carefully and not too hurriedly select the best spot for a permanent home. He visited Portland and Astoria after coming to this state, then Gray’s Harbor and other points, and finally arrived at Olympia. The resources, facilities and advantages of this city, in his own language, “surpassed all other places I visited,” and it took no persuasion for him to remain here. Since his arrival Mr. Christopher has placed the “Summit” and “Evergreen Park” additions to Olympia on the market and invested in property in all parts of the city. He also owns property throughout the state. He has associated himself with an excellent firm and is on the high road to success, and is unmarried.\n\nGeorge F. Conger was born in Geneva, New York, July 4, 1860, where he graduated from Cornell college in the class of 1880. He then removed to Cleveland, Ohio, where he became a large stockholder in the A.S. Herenden Furniture company, and held the position of secretary for ten years. Having read of the resources of Washington, in February, 1890 he came to Olympia and formed a copartnership under the firm name of Scammell & Conger, doing a real estate and loan business. Mr. Conger has largely invested and is much interested in the industries of Olympia, and is one of Olympia’s most prominent young and active citizens.\n\nLawrence Cormier, the proprietor [of the Gold Bar restaurant], is a native of Bathurst, New Brunswick. He started west some eight years ago, and after staying in Wisconsin about eleven months, came directly to Olympia. He is an enterprising and energetic man and has built up more than one lucrative business. The large number of peole who are fed daily at the Gold Bar restaurant is conclusive proof that this place is popular. Mr. Cormier is a partner in the grocery and provision business at 518 Fourth street, which is carried on under the firm name of Conachy & Cormier. He is also interested in the Palace Market at 414 Fourth street. His business success has been due to his own efforts and he is to-day one of Olympia’s most respected citizens.\n\nRev. Luther Covington, A.M., principal of the Olympia Collegiate Institute, was born in Centreville, Maryland, May, 1860. His parents removed to Indiana in 1863, and to Arkansas in 1875. He has an all-absorbing thirst for knowledge, studied under difficulties and great personal sacrifices in Judson university in 1878; in Little Rock high school in 1879 and ’80; in Little Rock university from its establishment in 1882 until he graduated in the classical course in the first regular graduating class in 1886. During his college course he acquired experience in teaching during summer vacations, and after graduating took charge of a school at Ellsworth of 140 pupils, which he conducted successfully. Accepting a call to preach he entered the Boston university, the school of theology, in 1887, and received the degree of Bachelor of Sacred Theology in 1890, and in the same year his Alma Mater conferred upon him the degree of Master of Arts. Trusting that the call was from Almighty God he accepted the principalship of the Olympia Collegiate Institute in 1890. Though finding the situation critical in the extreme the prophycy of grand future possibilities inspired him and his helpful and efficient instructors until a large prosperity crowned their efforts. Between 125 and 150 students have enrolled and several students will form a most creditable first year’s graduating class. The revival in the Methodist church extended to the institute and more than fifteen students were graciously converted to God. The zealous loyalty of the patrons bespeaks an ever increasing prosperity.\n\nE. E. Crego, of the firm of McDonald & Crego, was born at Gaines, Orleans county, New York, January 20, 1862. In the fall of 1865 his parents removed with him to Albion, N. Y., where his boyhood was spent. In 1881 he was graduated from the Albion Union high school preparatory to entering college. In 1882 he removed to Rochester and entered upon the study of pharmacy, which he followed for one year with intention of ultimately becoming a physician. After years’ work he decided to abandon his idea of a medial as well as a professional life, and in 1883 accepted a position in the construction department of the U. S. light house service, in connection with the eleventh light house district on Lake Superior, from which he was transferred to the tenth district on lakes Erie, Ontario and St. Lawrence river. Returning from this work Mr. Crego taught school at his native home for two years and in April, 1889, removed to the State of Washington where he occupied himself with newspaper work. Later he was wanted as assistant in the state treasurer’s office which position he only filled for a short time as he interests in realty demanded his time and attention, and in 1890, with his present partner, established the firm of McDonald & Crego, which firm by its reliability has rendered itself prominent in a large number of Olympia’s most profitable transactions, and has given it a precedence worthy of confidence of all.\n\nA.

He has had two pastorates previous to coming to Olympia, both of which were markedly successful, one in Butte City, Montana, and the other in Plantsville, Connecticut – and prominent New England church of nearly 400 members.\n\nOne of the most familiar faces about the streets and public places of Olympia during the session of the legislature, was that of Martin Batcheldor Dunbar, a sturdy pioneer. Judge Dunbar, as he is known among his townspeople where he has been elected justice of peace, is proud in being able to boast that he is one of the original forty-niners. He was born in Maine, September 21, 1820, and shortly afterward moved to Bangor with his parents, where he lived until he was 25 years old. He first left his pleasant home here to go to Boston to attend the consecration of the Bunker Hill monument. He remembers distinctly having met the president, and heard the oration of Daniel Webster delivered on that occasion. The Judge’s father was a manufacturer of doors, sashes and blinds, and his son learned the trade, but in 1844 he went west as far as Chicago, where he worked on the great Catholic cathedral for a year. Then he went to live in Lockport, Ill., until 1848. In the same year he returned to Bangor, and engaged passage in the schooner Eudorus, captain Charles Wiggin, around Cape Horn, stopping on his way at Rio and Juan Fernandez. The schooner arrived at San Francisco in September, 1849. For eleven years he resided in California, for two years he lived in Oregon, then for six years in Idaho, seven years in Wyoming and Utah, and for another three years in British Columbia on the Arctic slope. For the last eleven years he has made his home on the Skagit river, in Skagit county, in the town of Mount Vernon, and is probably the only forty-niner living in the county. When 60 years old he married, and his wife is still living at Mount Vernon, where his home is. He spent much of his time while at Olympia, receiving old acquaintances, and entertaining friends with reminiscences from a great fund of fascinating experiences.\n\nT. V.

In the spring of 1852 his family started across the continent, accompanying a wagon train which followed the Platte trail to Green River, Wyoming, where they branched off to the Oregon trail, and after six months of weary traveling arrived at Oregon City. The remainder of Prof. Francis’ boyhood was spent on a farm near that place, and his early education was limited to the resources of a country school. While yet a mere lad he developed a wonderful love for music, which his puritanical parents strongly objected to, for which reason his early studies in the divine art were prosecuted under many difficulties; but, notwithstanding the objection of his family circle, the undaunted young musician, by means of secret practice in hay lofts and garrets, and the possession of a limited though dearly cherished musical library, so far perfected himself that at the age of twenty-three he left his home and took a position in Salem, Oregon, as an instructor in music. Here his great natural talents rapidly asserted themselves; and among other things he organized the Salem band, during which work he played at sight upon brass instruments which had heretofore been utter strangers to him. With a musical reputation thoroughly founded, in 1874 Prof. Francis removed to Portland, Oregon, where he organized what was then the finest military band in the northwest. In 1880 the professor removed to Victoria, B. C., and spent five years in instructing the queen’s subjects in musical matters, after which he returned to Portland and remained five years. In 1888 he left Portland for Southern California, stopping in Los Angeles, where he perfected himself in orchestral playing under Prof. A. W. Wilharting and Emil Seifert. In 1890 his love for the northwest returned him hither, and he selected Olympia as his abiding place, where he has rapidly established himself in the hearts of the music loving public. Prof. Francis’ career has at every point stamped him as an artist richly endowed, and besides his wonderful instrumental work, he is the author of several well known compositions, among which is “Beautiful Lena,” and the temperance anthem, “The blue-ribbon war song,” Prof. Francis is also well informed on the construction of all musical instruments, and is himself the possessor of several old and highly valued violins.\n\nRobert Frost was born at Tunbridge Wells, Kent, England, October 25, 1835.

Immediately after taking his degree he started for New York and studied the practical part of his profession at the Bellevue and Island hospitals of that city, and was while there a private student of Austin Flint, secretary, and that able surgeon, Frank H. Hamilton, medical director of the U.S. Army. The latter urged him to enter the service of the U.S. government. The Dr. passed his examination for a surgeon of the U.S. Army before a board in Bleecher street, New York, and the next morning started for the seat of war and on his arrival at Washington D.C., was placed by Surgeon General Barnes on the staff of Armory Square hispital, where he remained on duty attending to the wounded brought in from the bloody battlefields of the Wilderness, Mine Run, Cold Harbor, Spottsylvania Court House and Petersburg, and had the honor to be selected from among the surgeons in Washington to form a post military hospital outside of Fort Lincoln when Early was in the valley. However a speedy retreat of that general from the view of Nash rendered the hospital useless. The Dr. then returned to his post at Armory Square but was soon transferred for duty to the department of the east, with headquarters at Governor’s Island hospital and at the foot of Broadway in New York, where he remained until promoted to be medical inspector for the state of Maine with headquarters at Portland, and was at that post until the close of the war. He then returned to Canada to visit his aged mother, and at her earnest request commenced the practice of his profession in the city of Peterboro, where he succeeded in bulding up one of the largest and most lucrative practices in central Canada, which he held for twenty-five years, and had during the whole of that time the positions of surgeon to the county of Peterboro, surgeon to the city of Peterboro, surgeon major with the rank of colonel in the British Army, surgeon to the Midland Railway Company of Canada, and senior surgeon Nicholls hospital, and in addition to other minor offices was elected senator for the University of Queen’s College; by a unanimous vote of the city and county of Peterboro was elected to represent them in parliament. In the latter part of 1888 the Dr. finding his family growing up, and realizing the limited field for young men to rise to good positions in Canada, resolved to come to the United States. He looked long and earnestly for a location and selected Olympia, where he commenced his practice in Wahsington in 1889, and is well satisfield with his success. He at once saw the advantages of the capital city and made up his mind from the first that Olympia was destined to be a large, healthy, intellectual and progressive city. The Dr. does not hope at his age to make a great stake but he feels satisfield that he will live to see Olympia a city of 30,000 and that his three sons will rise to good positions and become legal and useful citizens of this great, free and progressive country. Dr. Kincaid was married in 1865 in Perth, Canada, to Margaret M., daughter of James Bell, then manager of the commercial bank of Canada.\n\nAllison E.

As a result of an attack of la grippe, in connection with the high altitude, he was obliged to seek a more moderate climate. Six months were spent at Spokane as pastor of Centenary Presbyterian church. His health not improving there, he decided to come to this coast. While attending synod at Tacoma in October, 1890, he was invited to preach for the church in Olympia, which resulted in his settlement as stated supply for the church in this city. Thus far Mr. Lamont has met with great encouragement in his work. A large number have already been addded to the membership. Pastor and people are cordially united in prosecuting church work. All the services are well attended and sustained. The church evinces new life and activity in all departments. Among its officers and members there is an evident determination, with God’s blessing, to make the First Presbyterian church of Olympia power for good in the community, a center of spiritual influences, and a rallying point for christian work. Mr. Lamont is delighted with the climate of Puget Sound, and, with the continuation of his present improving health, thinks Olympia is just the place for him to live in, and for all who wish to enjoy beautiful scenery and healthful surroundings.\n\nCharles Frederick Leavenworth was born in Rochester, New York, on October 2, 1845.
