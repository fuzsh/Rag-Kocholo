Here's the book to accompany the series.\n\nThe Wheeler Dealer Know How is written by Mike Brewer, cheeky chappie and TV's best-known car dealing expert. In a career spanning almost 30 years, Mike has seen and done everything when it comes to buying and selling cars, and having established a successful career as a television presenter, is eager to share his knowledge, passion and enthusiasm for cars.\n\nTelling you all you need to know about buying, preparing and selling modern classic cars, this book guides you through the minefield that is the world of car dealing, and helps you avoid the pitfalls that await the unwary. Plus, with stories and anecdotes from Mike’s time in the trade, you'll gain a fascinating insight into the world of wheeler-dealing.\n\nAbout the Author\n\nEx -Car trader Mike Brewer has spent most of his 48 years selling thousands of motor vehicles and is perhaps best known as the star of Channel 4Æs second-hand car show Deals On Wheels and the top-rated motoring program Driven.The youngest in a family of six, Mike had a South London upbringing, before the family eventually settled down in Surrey where, during school holidays, you could hear Mike shouting as he was selling fruit 'nÆ veg on a stall. Mike got into the motor trade in his late teens and quickly built a reputation for being sharp and honest. He set up and ran the biggest 4\\u00d74 center in the south of England, importing cars from around the globe. He embarked on his television career through pure luck -- he answered a telephone call from a friendÆs and soon discovered he was talking to a television producer. A long chat and a few anecdotes followed and Mike was hired for the first series of Deals On Wheels. His success in this role led him into the presenterÆs position on Driven.Mike has also presented several TV specials, including Driven at Le Mans as well as The British Rally Championships for Channel 4 Sports and now Sky Sports, HeÆs Gotta Have It, For Discovery channel, as well as the massively popular 10 part motoring series Wheeler Dealers."
