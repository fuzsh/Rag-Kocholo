        "text": "“Wheeler Dealers” is the most unlikely international hit television car show. It doesn’t pump up the drama. It doesn’t feature stunts or fights. It doesn’t struggle with artificial deadlines, or any artifice at all. The formula has remained true for 13 seasons: British dealer Mike Brewer finds and buys a classic (or soon-to-be classic) car at a good price. He then hands it over to his mechanic for a loving restoration. The mechanic shows how he repairs, upgrades and spruces up the car, with Mike lending a hand sourcing parts and working with outside specialty restorers. When the car is finished, Mike and his mechanic take a test drive that shows off the car in its best environment. Then, Mike sells the car to a new lucky owner – hopefully earning a profit in the process.\n\nThe big news for Season 14, which began airing last week on Velocity, one of Discovery Network’s cable channels, is that there’s a new Executive Producer, industry veteran Tod Mesirow, and there’s a new mechanic: Ant Anstead, replacing Edd China, who was Brewer’s broadcast partner on every previous episode of the show.\n\nMike Brewer is just like the guy you see on television, and he’s proud of that. “I’m the most normal fellow you’ve ever met,” he said at the outset of our interview in Santa Monica, California. “I’ve been on television for 20 years, and if you met me 20 years ago, you’d be talking to the same guy.”\n\nBrewer, 53, was born in London and grew up in the car business. “My dad was a car customizer, so when I was born and brought up by my amazing father, my great parents, I was born into the car world,” he said. “Through my schooling years, up until the age of about ten, during the school breaks when you had holidays, my dad would have to look after me. He’d take me down to the garage and ask me to hand him a number ten and give him it back. I’d have to clean it and put it back in the tool chest. I had no real interest in cars whatsoever, but just being around my dad all that time and going to car shows and seeing the notoriety my dad had – he had cars on the covers of magazines in England -- seeing the notoriety, I sort of had an interest to it. But I wasn’t really that tied up by it. But clearly, throughout the years, I learned a lot of skills from my dad. By the time I’d come to 17 and bought my first car, I knew exactly what I was doing. I knew what to look for, how to repair it, how to fix it. I don’t know how I knew all this stuff, but somehow I knew it.”\n\nBrewer built a reputation as an honest and skilled car trader. He built and managed car dealerships in his native United Kingdom, and now has two eponymous “Mike Brewer Motors” outlets, one in Sheffield and one in Luton, selling “high quality used and nearly-new” cars at the rate of 600 per month. After successful stints on the British television shows “Deals on Wheels” and “Driven” in the early 2000s, Brewer became the first presenter on “Wheeler Dealers.”\n\nIn the initial season (2003), Brewer and China had a budget of 1,000 pounds. That increased to 2,000 pounds for Season 2 and 3,000 pounds for Season 3. Since then, the self-imposed budget constraints have been lifted, and cars in a wide range have been bought, rehabbed and sold. The show reveals the purchase price of the vehicle, the cost of repairs and upgrades (not including Brewer’s or China’s labor), and the selling price of the vehicle. Over the course of 13 seasons, Brewer has sold over 1 million pounds worth of cars, garnering a profit of over 200,000 pounds (not including labor). The most expensive project in the history of the show was China’s final one: A 1916 Cadillac Type 53 Roadster V8, which was purchased for $96,000 (including an engine donor 1918 Type 57 that was bought $45,000). Ironically, it was the one vehicle in 13 seasons that was not running at episode’s end.\n\nWhich brings us to the sticky subject of China’s departure from the show. Brewer is visibly uncomfortable when the subject arises in our interview, but he is characteristically forthright. “I’m immensely proud of the last 13 years with Edd,” Brewer said. “We restored over 150 cars. We had 13 years of taking a TV show that was tiny – it was a tiny little TV show -- and through our hard work and determination, both me and Edd pushed every year to make that show better and better and better. I’m immensely proud of that. But unfortunately, there was always going to be an end date. It’s a bit like buying a pint of milk. There’s a sell-by date on it, and the sell-by date was fast approaching. For Edd, he wants to do other things. I don’t know what they are, because they’ve not appeared yet.”\n\nChina made his exit rather publicly, posting a YouTube video on March 21, 2017 where he stated that “in particular, the detailed and in-depth coverage of my fixes in the workshop; what I consider to be the backbone and USP of the program, are something Velocity feel should be reduced. The workshop jobs are certainly the hardest part of the show to make and reducing their substance and role in the show will save the production considerable time, effort and therefore money. However, this new direction is not something I am comfortable with as I feel the corners I was being asked to cut compromised the quality of my work and would erode my integrity as well as that of the show, so I have come to the conclusion that my only option is to let Velocity get on with it, without me.”\n\nBrewer disagrees with China’s view of events. “It’s, frankly, ridiculous, because Edd left and it’d be the first time you can put it in print, if you’d like,” he said. “He lied. He said that the Velocity channel was going to cut the mechanic in sequences of the show and his integrity was that he didn’t want the show to change. But if you watch the show, you’ll see nothing changed. There’s more mechanics than ever, and that’s not because of what Edd said. That’s because nobody ever asked to cut the mechanic’s sequences.”\n\n“I don’t know why he said that,” Brewer continued. “I don’t know why it went out on the internet. Because of that, I’ve had a years’ worth of abuse pressed upon me, my family, my daughter, my mom and dad have to read, my brothers and sisters have to read. It’s horrible. I don’t think he gets that. I don’t think he gets the amount of abuse that I’ve suffered.”\n\n“It’s a shame, because I loved the guy,” Brewer said of China. “I genuinely had a friendship, genuine love, genuine bond with the guy. But what Edd wants is something completely different. It’s not ‘Wheeler Dealers,’ unfortunately. But that’s not my fault. You can put this down as well. He never even told me that he was going. I didn’t even know he was leaving. I get told a week after he quit. But what I can tell you, and this is the one thing I need to focus on – because it has been difficult – is that I’m the one that Discovery Channel had faith in, and they had faith in the cars, and they had faith in the brand, and they’ve continued. That’s something that I can say that, that they continued to make the show.”\n\nBrewer has faced some severe backlash in the comments sections for choosing to continue with “Wheeler Dealers” after China’s departure. “This is what I do for a living,” he said. “I’m amazed that people say I should have left with him, because he’s unemployed at the moment. We’d both be unemployed, which is a bit stupid. People say, ‘You stabbed him in the back and you should have gone with him, and your integrity should have gone with him, because there’s no integrity.’”\n\n“I’m proud of myself, that I’ve managed to carry on and get through this last year. Last year’s been hell, but to get through it has been worth it, in the end,” Brewer said. “We worked so hard. I’ve worked seven days a week, and I’m not trying to be a martyr here. I’m just telling you the way it is. I’ve got seven days a week, 360 days a year. One year, I slept in my bed nine times. That was it, at home. I missed every funeral, wedding, anniversary, birthday. I’ve missed them all. My daughter’s never seen me and she’s 22. I’ve probably been to six of her birthdays, and it’s all in the pursuit of making this show and making it an entertaining program. People don’t get that. People don’t see that and realize it. It’s been tough, but I can sit here and say it was worth it. I’m so proud of it.”\n\nBrewer’s new partner on the show, 38-year old Ant Anstead (born Anthony Richard Anstead in Plymouth, England), is a life-long car enthusiast, but a relative newcomer to television. He started out on the U.K. Channel 4 show “For the Love of Cars” in 2013, and has been a sought-after small-screen personality ever since. His background as a builder of bespoke classic vehicles and his mechanical and design prowess made him an ideal choice, in Brewer’s eyes, for China’s replacement. “The first choice was always, for me, going to be Ant Anstead, and they did the screen tests of us both last year,” said Brewer. “When it went to the network and they saw it, they thought it was magic and they immediately went for him. Thank God they did, because Ant’s amazing.”\n\nSeason 14 of “Wheeler Dealers” kicked off on Velocity last Wednesday with the restoration of a 1995 Ford Escort RS Cosworth, a rally car that set British boy-racer hearts aflutter in the mid-1990s, but was barely a blip on the radar here in the U.S. In fact, only 25 examples were imported into the U.S., and of those, only 12 were licensed for operation on public roads. Brewer and the “Wheeler Dealer” team found one of the road-worthy Cosworths, and restored it in their Huntington Beach, California workshop. Anstead proved to be an able mechanic with the rare gift of being able to explain the complex operation of an engine’s internals, while keeping it simple enough for non-mechanics (and non-car people) to understand. His deconstruction and rebuild of a turbocharger made the magical bolt-on part seem completely logical, and when he said “Really, turbos are quite simple. No wires; no computers. In fact, all cars should have them,” it was hard to disagree.\n\nLater this season, Brewer and Anstead will tackle a wide variety of cars, from a 1984 Toyota Celica Supra to a 1973 Saab 96 to a 1965 Dodge A100 van to a 1965 Plymouth Barracuda and beyond. “It’s still traditional Wheeler Dealers, and we want to give people the confidence to see these cars and to be able to think that they can do this,” Brewer said. “They can tackle this kind of car themselves, from home.” That has always been the magic of “Wheeler Dealers,” and Brewer is committed to its continuation.\n\n“My dad always said to me – and this has been part of my mantra all my life,” said Brewer. “It may sound simple, but it means a lot, especially when you’re going to be a car dealer. My dad once said to me, ‘Always do the right thing. Never, ever do the wrong thing.’ That’s been a mantra that’s stayed with me forever. When you’re buying and selling cars, it’s easy to cheat the car trade. You can buy a car, patch that hole up with newspaper, a little bit of bondo over the top, a little rattle can and spray it over and nobody will know the difference. You can push it out the door. But for me, I’ve always been honest to the car and I’ve always thought that you should be as honest as you can be to the car, and honest to yourself.”\n\n“Wheeler Dealers” airs on the Velocity channel on Wednesday nights at 9 pm/8 pm Central Time."
