        "text": "For the past several years, surnames (last names) have become a frequent source for finding unique and interesting baby names. Taylor and Madison, for example, were two names that hit the charts in the last 80s and have held strong. Many surnames are used as viable gender-neutral choices for baby names.\n\nThere are predominantly four types of surnames:\n\nPatronymic – meaning referring to the father, like Johnson meaning son of John, or MacKenzie meaning son of Kenneth.\n\nOccupational – Names like Baker and Thatcher were originally assigned to a family whose head of household had a specific occupation.\n\nGeographical – Many English surnames describe where a particular family lived, such as Durham or Woods.\n\nCharacteristic – Personal characteristics were also used as identifiers that became surnames, such as Short, Young or Kennedy. Just be sure to look up the meanings – not all were complimentary!\n\nRecently, we’ve seen celebrity influences on baby names, where parents choose names that reflect their favorite musicians, athletes, or public figures, just to name a few. Examples of celebrity surnames that are becoming more popular include Beckham (David), Phoenix (River), and Lincoln (Abraham).
