        "text": "LinkedIn‚Äôs rolling out short-form videos, and y'all‚Ä¶don‚Äôt come for me but‚Ä¶..I‚Äôm here for it! In my role at Chatterkick as an Executive Personal Branding Strategist, my day-to-day involves helping C-Suite executives connect with their audience on a personal level, building trust, and communicating effectively through our Executive Social service. So, I'm GAGGED that LinkedIn is bringing this to the professional world. It‚Äôs exactly the kind of thing I‚Äôve been hoping for‚Äîa way to make sharing their expertise not just informative, but also engaging and relatable. If we‚Äôre being real here, that‚Äôs been the challenge on this platform: getting people to show their real selves and what they know in a way that doesn‚Äôt feel stiff or dull. With video, there‚Äôs a chance to turn what could be a dry, jargon-filled fluff post into something way more authentic and fresh. For someone like me, this shift opens up so many doors. It supports the message I‚Äôve been preaching for soooo long about finding that sweet spot where professional meets personal, without tipping too far either way. I think learning this new algorithm and watching everyone find the balance of keeping video content both interesting and fitting for LinkedIn is going to be‚Ä¶amusing. I‚Äôve seen this somewhat go left with ‚ÄúLinkedInfluencers‚Äù but done right‚Ä¶.this could be BIG. It could completely change how we think about networking and growing professionally. All in all, LinkedIn‚Äôs move to include short-form videos is pretty exciting and I can‚Äôt wait to play around with it. Any opportunity to help the highly valuable (but high-key sometimes boring and difficult to talk about) B2B content on LinkedIn fun and ‚Äústicky‚Äù‚Ä¶sign me right on up. Shoutout to Austin Null for sharing this first glance. üôåüèΩ\n\nLinkedIn experimenting with short video format like the reels are is an interesting thought -and quite big if true. Looking at the example below, there is one notable thing in the videos - subtitles! There are multiple reasons for subtitling content on the social media. From the simple catching attention of the viewer in the very first seconds, to making it possible to watch without speakers or headphones to the localization itself, it really pays off. And if you don't trust me, take it from the example of one of the most successful YouTube stars, MrBeast: \"Less than 10 % of the world speaks English. So 90 % of the world can't even enjoy your content.\" He also launched multiple localized channels with dubbing and even dubbing company and regularly posts updates on how is this helping him grow. It will be interesting to seee if we are going to deal with number of requests for LI subtitling in the near future, that's for sure. #prestocz #localization #subtitling\n\nüëâ The demand for short-form content continues to grow. ‚öô We are onboarding more and more new branding clients to our short-form products as businesses, brands, enterprises, professionals, CEO's, Founders, etc. across multiple verticals realize that their ability to reach their audience is through value driven short-from content. üìä If you do not have a plan for your organic brand outreach, either for your business or your personal brand, you are missing out on organic growth and authority based credibility. üîé If you're looking to get more info on how to structure, strategize, and produce short-form content. Dm me to start the conversation. #shortformcontent #shortformvideo #contentmarketing #brandstrategy\n\nThe Function Nobody Asked For I'm baffled by LinkedIn's latest updates. In mid-March, TechCrunch reported that the social network is gearing up to launch mini-games on its platform. With leaderboards among friends and the companies you work for. Whether managers will start giving bonuses because their company made it to the top 3 in a new game is not specified. And just recently, a beta test of a separate video feed within the app has been revealed. Yes, like TikTok, Reels, and Shorts. On one hand, I understand that platforms need to engage with Zoomers, who have different behaviour patterns. And surely, boosting platform time will likely earn the top brass an annual bonus. On the other hand, I don't see at all how such decisions could lead to increased productivity or finding new job opportunities. It's highly doubtful that businesses will be able to produce enough useful video content to sustain daily feed updates. But I have no doubt that animated motivational quotes will pop up there.\n\nLinkedIn is embracing the short-form video trend by launching a new TikTok-style stream dedicated to professional and career development material. Austin Null from McKinney discovered this function, which is placed under the app's \"Video\" category and allows users to simply navigate through informative and motivating movies. LinkedIn's video stream stands apart by focusing entirely on professional content, with the goal of increasing user interaction. This effort, which is currently in the early stages of testing, provides new options for creators to share their expertise with a larger audience while simultaneously meeting the platform's rising demand for short, powerful learning experiences. Will you create your own video once it is available? #linkedin #linkers"
