        "text": "If you’re like me and watch any of the numerous automotive channels available via your preferred viewing method, you should know the name Mike Brewer. Since 2003 Mike has made up half of the Wheeler Dealers team (first with Edd China, then Ant Anstead) on the Discovery Channel and its many offshoots (Velocity, Motor Trend).\n\nThe basic premise of the show has Mike on a mission to save old and repairable enthusiast vehicles, by having Edd / Ant repairing or otherwise improving an example of a particular make and model to a budget, then selling it to a new owner.\n\nWhile the show has been successful for well over 15 years, Mike came to the realization that he travels the world looking for vehicles for Wheeler Dealers, but he never really gets an opportunity to get to know the locations or people in the towns that he visits. That led Mike to want to try something new, while remaining a “car” show if you will.\n\nThe Mike Brewer Solo Show!\n\nOf course that’s not the final name of the program, unless it is and I just let a huge cat out of the bag! Let me check my contract to see what I can and cannot say…\n\nDoesn’t say a damn thing!\n\nI get a call from one of the producers at Motor Trend TV explaining the concept that Mike travels to a particular location, learns about local culture, finds local craftsmen to see what they’re up to, and otherwise enjoy the heck out of the couple days that he is in that location and to absorb as much as he can.\n\nOh, and he is going to be in Chicago the following week and they are looking for a car that is know around the world as a Chicago car.\n\nTHE BLUESMOBILE!!!\n\nI automatically said yes. There was no way in the world that I would say no to this opportunity!\n\nWithout giving to much of the story away, Mike lands in Chicago, calls his mate that lives here to let him know that he is here, only finding out that the friend is out in California or some other foreign country.\n\nMike try’s deep dish pizza for the first time, drives around downtown Chicago in The Bluesmobile, finally ending up by the Adler Planetarium with a picturesque view of the Chicago Skyline and The Bluesmobile of course!!"
