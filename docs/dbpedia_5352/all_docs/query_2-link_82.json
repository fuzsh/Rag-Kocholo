        "text": "All - I cant believe it but I have been researching the name for some years and have never come across this site!!\n\nWell I am currently writing a history of the name, and its origins.In addition I am interested in tracing Grewers/Gruars/Grewars/Gruers etc with links to Birse, Aberdeenshire, Scotland. I was brought up in the heart of Grewer country - Glen Isla / Kirriemuir, Scotland.Here is some basic info.\n\n1. The name originates from Scotland, and from MacGrudaire, which in Scots Gaelic translates as 'the son of the Brewer or distiller' - trade name for someone who brewed beer/ale, or made Whisky.\n\n2. Names such as Crowther, MacGruder, MacGruther, MacGrewer etc, all stem from the same origins, of the trade of a brewer/distiller.However, as the name is so old, it probably started to change from MacGrudaire as early as the 14th Century, these names do not share much in the way of associations or shared ancestry.\n\n3. The spelling of the name is irrelevant, as surnames in Scotland were not standardised until comparatively recently.My own spelling is Grewar, but as recently as my G grandfather, it was Gruar and Gruer.\n\n4. There are several branches or clusters of where the name is concentrated.These are primarily around Braemar, Aberdeenshire, Scotland, the area surrounding Boleskine, Invernesshire, Glenisla, Perthshire, other parts of Perthshire, and north of Glasgow.They do not seem to have any connections with each other, as it was the trade name which was assigned to individuals independently of each other.\n\n5. There is much talk of Grewers being connected with clans such as the Frasers, MacGregors and Drummonds.This is not as true as you might think.As mentioned above, Grewer and MacCrowther for example originate from MacGrudaire, but they do not share any other direct connections.As MacCrowthers may have a link with Drummonds, it has been assumed that Grewars, MacGruers, and MacGruthers, also do. This is not the case.The MacGruers, for example, are almost entirely linked to the Frasers, and were hereditary Standard bearers to the Frasers of Saltoun.The link with the MacGregors is extemely tenuous, in that their name as banned by law and they were forced to change it.Some changed it to Gruer/Grewer etc. So it is true to say Gruer has a significance to MacGregors, it is not true to necessarily say that MacGregors have a significance to Gruers.The name is not part of that clan, as such, even though clan Gregor has deemed it such - what right do they possess to claim a name as part of theirs!!.\n\n6. Other clan links are also obvious, which were not included in the 1845 lists of Septs (branches of main clans), by MacIan.The Farquharsons share a huge connection with Gruers, as do the Gordons, and the Ogilvies, and even the Colquhouns.\n\n7. There are some Grewers in England, Ireland, and Germany.I have some ancestors in Ireland, they came from Scotland, with their father in the army.Those in England, are there merely due to migration from Scotland.The name in Germany, is either a completely separate name, or again due to migration from Scotland.\n\nA tip for anyone researching Grewer in Scotland is to identify a connection with an area of Scotland, and the rest will seem obvious.There are not that many of us.\n\nIf anyone can help me with my history, I would be interested if anyone with information on the Name could contact me.Any queries about the above also welcome.Just drop me an e-mail - probably best to try [email protected].\n\nRegards\n\nMichael Grewar"
