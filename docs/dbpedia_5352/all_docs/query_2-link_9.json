        "text": "Brewer: What does the surname Brewer mean?\n\nThe last name Brewer is of Old English origin and is an occupational surname. Derived from the pre-7th-century Old English term \"breowan,\" which literally translates to \"to brew,\" this surname was traditionally given to individuals who brewed beer and other alcoholic beverages as a profession. Brewing was an important trade in medieval times and early brewers played a key role in their communities, so the Brewer surname became quite common throughout England. It's also possible that some people with this surname may be descendants of these early brewers. Over time, the surname spread to other parts of the world, commonly due to British colonization and immigration. Despite its textual connection to the occupation, not all people with the last name Brewer are professionally associated with brewing.\n\nOrder DNA origin analysis\n\nBrewer: Where does the name Brewer come from?\n\nThe surname Brewer is of Anglo-Saxon origin and is an occupational surname which derived from the old English word \"breowan\" which means to brew. It was given to someone who worked as a brewer of beers and ales.\n\nThe surname first appeared in early medieval England, and in some cases, it may have been used to denote a brew-house or brewhouse-owner. The first recorded spelling of the family name is dated as far back as 1086 during the reign of King William I and was recorded as Robertus Bruarius in the Domesday Book of Sussex.\n\nToday, it is most common in the United States, England, and Australia. According to Forebears, Brewer is the 840th most common surname in the world and itâ€™s most prevalent in the United States. The United States has the highest number of people with the Brewer surname with an estimated 94,533 Brewers. The surname Brewer is very frequently used in English-speaking countries, but it's also present in dozens of other countries across the globe.\n\nVariations of the surname Brewer\n\nThe surname Brewer is of occupational origin, originating from Old English 'breowan' which means 'to brew'. It was used to designate a person who brewed beer or ale.\n\nThere are several recorded variants and spellings for the name Brewer, such as Brewster, Brauer, Brauwer, Brewar, Brewere, Brewyere, Brewen, Lebrewer, De Brewer, and Brower. The prefixes like 'Le' and 'De' indicate the French influence, showing a broader geographical spread of the name.\n\nAlso, Brew, Brewe and Brewes can be considered as shortened versions of Brewer. Brewster specifically is an interesting variant of Brewer. Originally, it was used to refer to female brewers. Brewster comes from the Old English 'breowestre', which means 'brewster, female brewer'.\n\nMany surnames with very similar spelling and pronunciation might have originated independently, in different languages and regions, and hence may not be true variants of Brewer. For example, the German Brauer or Dutch Brauwer might have similar origins, but it's not certain that they are direct variants of Brewer. It's always possible, however, that the names influenced each other through interaction between English, German and Dutch speakers.\n\nGiven that surnames often change over time and are influenced by local language and dialect, there could be even more variants and spellings of the surname Brewer.\n\nFamous people with the name Brewer\n\nTeresa Brewer: An American pop and jazz singer.\n\nCorey Brewer: An American professional basketball player.\n\nJan Brewer: An American politician and author who served as the 22nd Governor of Arizona.\n\nTeresa Brewer: An American singer who enjoyed significant success in the late 1950s and 1960s.\n\nGay Brewer: A prominent American professional golfer who won the U.S Masters in 1967.\n\nRon Brewer: An American former professional basketball player and father to Corey Brewer.\n\nKen Brewer: A prominent American poet and Professor of English.\n\nJohn D.
