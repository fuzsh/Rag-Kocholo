All leads gratefully appreciated as I’ve been searching for nearly 20 years and have got plenty of brick walls (as well as plenty of info) to share!.\n\nMany thanks in anticipation\n\nChris Fowler\n\nWimborne\n\nDorset\n\nHello Chris,\n\nI was interested to read your message and noted that you think you have exhausted what is available about Wiltshire on Ancestry.\n\nYou may be unaware that FindMyPast has a vast amount of transcriptions from the Wiltshire parish registers and other sources?\n\nIf you are not a subscriber you may find your local library has access.\n\nRegards, Rod in Andover."
