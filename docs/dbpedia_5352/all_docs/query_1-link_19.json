        "text": "Areas of Expertise\n\nField crops entomology\n\nInvasive species ecology\n\nInsect pest management\n\nProfessional Summary\n\nMichael Brewer, Ph.D. is a professor of entomology. His research and education interests bridge across integrated pest management, invasive species ecology and field crops entomology. Brewer works on priority and emerging pest management issues relevant to fiber and grain crops and regional and national goals in insect pest management, crop protection, and agroecosystem stewardship. His mission-oriented focus is on transforming research findings undergirded by population, landscape, and invasive species ecology to IPM approaches that improves management of field crop pest and beneficial insects. Mikeâ€™s most recent research projects have been on ecology and management of sugarcane aphid on sorghum, sucking bugs of cotton and lepidopterans pests of corn. He has published 140 articles and 10 book chapters. Over the past eight years he has attracted over $2.1M dollars in support of his research program and over $5.2 million of program support across his career. Brewer is co-editor-in-chief of the Journal of Economic Entomology and Associate Editor of Frontiers in Insect Science-Invasive Species section."
