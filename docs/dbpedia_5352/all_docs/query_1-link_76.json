        "text": "As an Apostolic Team Leader, I strategically partner with Kingdom leaders, forging plans and assembling five-fold teams that break open regions, advancing the Gospel into the nations.\n\nAs Equippers, our focus is unwavering—we don’t gather followers; we train warriors and thrust them forth to fulfill their God-given mandate.\n\nAs Intercessors, we boldly stand in the gap, declaring God’s will into the earth and preparing the way for His Kingdom to manifest.\n\nOur ministry is built on five unshakable pillars: Model, Equip, Watch, Mentor, and Send Forth.\n\nAt the heart of everything we do is a commitment to Supernaturally Equipping Kingdom Families by living out these principles with authority ensuring every believer steps into their God-ordained destiny.\n\nThis deliverance manual is for you whether you are in addiction, hear voices, self-harm, or are stuck in a destructive pattern. You see, we have led a considerable number of people through deliverance and have seen their lives change. As He has set others free, it is His great desire to set you free as well. This manual will give you the tools, insights, and practical prayers you need for your total freedom.\n\nWhat does a modern-day apostle look like? How does an apostle function, and what is their role within the Body of Christ? Why do we still need the Apostolic gift today?\n\nMany believers have asked these questions and more in regard to the role and gifting of an Apostle. The gift of the Apostle is greatly needed and still exists today, but many believers have struggled to define and understand this important gift given by Jesus Christ Himself.\n\nMost people are not oblivious to the fact that living in another culture contains challenges and difficulties. Our lives have been no exception to trials. We have endured hardships most people never dream of going through, all in just a matter of a few years. From surviving the greatest natural disaster in our lifetime, to multiple miscarriages, to seeing the supernatural provision of God through the death of a child, we want you to share in the journey God has taken us on: a journey of His mighty miracles and amazing power."
