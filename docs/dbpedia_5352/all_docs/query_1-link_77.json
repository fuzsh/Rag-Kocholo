I’ve never been asked that. What car would I never do? Yeah there is. It's a great question.”\n\nREAD MORE Wheeler Dealer's advice to classic car owners with some models set to 'decay'\n\nHe quickly identified the Chrysler PT Cruiser Convertible as the car in question before explaining why he wasn’t a fan.\n\nMike commented: “Apologies to anyone out there who’s got one and likes them but I'm pretty vocal about how much I don't like them\n\n“It would be a Chrysler PT cruiser, convertible, in yellow. That would be my nemesis. That’s my kryptonite.\n\n\"I can't stand yellow cars and I can't stand the PT cruiser and I can't stand a convertible even more.\"\n\nDON'T MISS\n\nMike Brewer gives the biggest clue yet on Edd China Wheeler Dealers return [LATEST]\n\nMike Brewer lists used car picks for under £5,000 including Vauxhall and Ford [ANALYSIS]\n\nWheeler Dealers Mike Brewer on vital used car tip for 'less than a tank of fuel’ [COMMENT]\n\nInvalid email\n\nWe use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Some kid after he took an overdose of Calpol got a crayon and drew the worst design ever. He needs a punch whoever designed it. He does. Sorry if you've got one. It's hideous.”\n\nThe two-door convertible PT Cruiser hit the market in 2005 and was produced for three years before production came to an end.\n\nIt was based on the five-door hatchback Chrysler PT Cruiser model which was still being manufactured up until 2010.\n\nThe Convertible specification came with 220bhp and could reach a top speed of around 124mph.\n\nThe vehicle had the potential to reach 0-62mph in just over 10 seconds. According to AutoTrader, the leading marketplace for new and used cars in the UK, Chrysler PT Cruiser models are available to purchase second-hand.\n\nHowever, they appear very rare with just five models on sale across the entire country at the time of writing.\n\nBased on current prices, motorists interested in securing a used model should expect to pay anywhere between £2,500 and £3,000."
