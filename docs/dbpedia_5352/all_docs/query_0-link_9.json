        "text": "What does Wheeler Dealer Mike Brewer’s personal car garage look like?\n\nIf you are not sure who Mike Brewer is, Mike (born 28 August 1964) is an English car trader turned presenter of motoring television programmes. He currently presents Wheeler Dealers on the Discovery Channel with Marc “Elvis” Priestley. Known for being the frontman of TV show Wheeler Dealers since it began almost 20 years ago, Mike had already been the presenter of Driven, Deals on Wheels and numerous other shows. But what does the veteran car dealer keep in his own garage?\n\nIt was interesting to hear that Mike’s also got several other Porsche’s not featured here. Jonny Smith and his The Late Brake Show was invited to see Mike Brewer’s personal car collection and stealth garage, before sitting down to talk to him.\n\nIf you do not have the patience to watch the entire video here are the sections you can skip to, to hear about the specific cars featured:\n\nCHAPTERS\n\n0:00 Intro\n\n1:27 Ford Ranger Raptor\n\n2:14 Land Rover Defender\n\n2:45 The workshop\n\n4:05 1982 Porsche SC resto-mod\n\n7:25 Porsche 912E\n\n9:48 Porsche 928\n\n12:44 1959 MGA\n\n16:51 Mk1 Ford Transit\n\n20:05 Land Rover 110 Defender\n\n21:55 Alexa abuse\n\n22:32 1964 Mini Cooper S\n\n25:40 Porsche Taycan\n\n29:28 What else does he own?"
