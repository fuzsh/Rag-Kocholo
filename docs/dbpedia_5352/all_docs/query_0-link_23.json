That's kind of exciting for us.\n\n\"We've come back with this amazing show that we can't wait for the audience globally to see it.\n\n\"But although we've now made it and gone around the world doing it, we've gone 'oh well we could have done that a bit better, we could've spent a bit more time on this'.\"\n\nHe concluded: \"We know we can improve it next time round.\""
