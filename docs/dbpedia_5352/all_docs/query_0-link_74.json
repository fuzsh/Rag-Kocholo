        "text": "published on 2013-09-16T03:37:08Z\n\nâWheeler Dealersâ, one of the UKâs longest running and most popular motoring shows is back for its tenth series this Tuesday 17th September at 9pm on Discovery Channel. The series sees expert car salesman Mike Brewer and multi-talented mechanic Edd China hunt for treasure as they find rundown classic cars and transform them into sleek, gleaming beauties ready to sell on to a punter for a healthy profit. I sat with Mike Brewer for a chat about the new series and quizzed him about his favourite movie cars..\n\nGenre\n\nInterview"
