        "text": "Mike Brewer is the dedicated apostolic leader and visionary founder of The Well Global Alliance, an organization that licenses and ordains ministers of the Gospel across diverse spheres of society. Alongside his wife, Andrea, he is also the co-founder of Reach International and The Well of Maryville, both of which have emerged from a deep-seated commitment to empower and propel individuals into their divine destinies. With a profound impact that has led to the establishment of numerous churches worldwide, Mike remains unwaveringly devoted to witnessing the Kingdom's expansion into the most unreached corners of the globe.\n\nThis deliverance manual is for you whether you are in addiction, hear voices, self-harm, or are stuck in a destructive pattern. You see, we have led a considerable number of people through deliverance and have seen their lives change. As He has set others free, it is His great desire to set you free as well. This manual will give you the tools, insights, and practical prayers you need for your total freedom.\n\nWhat does a modern-day apostle look like? How does an apostle function, and what is their role within the Body of Christ? Why do we still need the Apostolic gift today?\n\nMany believers have asked these questions and more in regard to the role and gifting of an Apostle. The gift of the Apostle is greatly needed and still exists today, but many believers have struggled to define and understand this important gift given by Jesus Christ Himself.\n\nMost people are not oblivious to the fact that living in another culture contains challenges and difficulties. Our lives have been no exception to trials. We have endured hardships most people never dream of going through, all in just a matter of a few years. From surviving the greatest natural disaster in our lifetime, to multiple miscarriages, to seeing the supernatural provision of God through the death of a child, we want you to share in the journey God has taken us on: a journey of His mighty miracles and amazing power.\n\nREQUEST MIKE\n\nWith a unique ability to connect with audiences and leave a lasting impact, Mike's dynamic speaking style will undoubtedly uplift and inspire all who attend. Don't miss this opportunity to bring a transformative experience to your event. Book Mike now and create an unforgettable gathering for your community."
