        "text": "In this interview series, our CEO Donald Davidoff sits down with key industry leaders and disruptors to tell the stories of the people behind the performance. Today, we’re joined by Mike Brewer, the Chief Operating Officer for The RADCO Companies, which is a nationally recognized real estate industry leader and innovator. The RADCO Companies has a 27-year history of acquiring and investing in opportunistic real estate across all asset classes. The firm’s investment strategy targets underperforming assets that offer immediate mark-to-market opportunities and assets requiring capital infusion to add value. RADCO seeks out well-located assets that have limited access to institutional debt or equity capital. The RADCO Companies' mission is \"Building Better Living\".\n\nJoin us for a transparent look at the importance Mike places on putting people first, creating psychologically-safe spaces to bring your whole self to work, the tsunami of PropTech making landfall in the multifamily industry, and the role data plays in giving customers a seat at the corporate table.\n\nAbout Mike Brewer\n\nMike Brewer is passionate about people, technology, and real estate. Mike’s investment in technological advances and education improves the team member experience and elevates customer engagement. He joined RADCO Residential in 2016 and oversees all operations. Mike has received numerous industry honors, including seven “Property Management Company of the Year” awards under his leadership. He is a frequent contributor to industry-related publications, such as Units Magazine, MFE, Multifamily Insiders, PropertyManagement.com, and more. His vlog, The Multifamily Collective, reaches industry professionals across the globe who tune in daily for Mike’s reflections on everything from consumer trends to employee relations, professional growth, and beyond. An avid reader and lifelong learner, Mike has been “out to put a dent in the multifamily universe” for more than 25 years."
