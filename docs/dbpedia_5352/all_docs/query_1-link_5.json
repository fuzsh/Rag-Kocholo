        "text": "MICHAEL BREWER was born on April 14th, 1944 in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. The oldest of four children, he performed on the radio at age four. He was a singing drummer in a rock and roll band in high school, along with fellow band mate and guitarist Jesse Ed Davis. In 1960 he sold his drums and bought his first guitar ( A Martin D-18. The same guitar heard on six \"Brewer & Shipley\" albums). After graduating high school in 1962, he traveled the folk circuit performing in coffee houses from coast to coast, and began writing songs. He met Tom Shipley in 1964 at The Blind Owl coffee house in Kent, Ohio, but they wouldn't become a team for a few more years.\n\nand with friends, formed a company named Good Karma Productions. \"Brewer & Shipley\" acquired a new recording contract with Buddha/Kama Sutra Records in New York City. They recorded four albums for that label Weeds, Tarkio (containing the now classic rock anthem \"One Toke Over The Line\"), Shake Off The Demon, and Rural Space. Eventually, they moved to Capitol Records and recorded two albums ST-11261 and Welcome To Riddle Bridge.\n\nIn 1980 Michael and Tom amicably went their separate ways. Michael met Dan Fogelberg in a bar in the Rocky mountains, and Dan invited him to sing on a song on his latest album. The album was The Innocent Age and the song was \"The Reach\". Dan produced Michael's first solo LP entitled Beauty Lies, on Full Moon/Warner Bros. Records, and it was released in 1983.\n\nIn 1987 \"Brewer & Shipley\" regrouped for a special concert in Kansas City. They did a few more reunion shows, but writing new songs is what got them back together. While on tour in Alaska, they decided to form their own company \"One Toke Productions\". They have written songs for and recorded two CD's for that company, Shanghai and Heartland, and after forty plus years together \"Brewer & Shipley\" are still performing."
