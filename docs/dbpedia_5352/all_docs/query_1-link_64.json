He was a stalwart fixture in the local community, dedicating many years to working as a machine maintenance professional at Urquhart LLC, Royco and Table Talk Pie factory in Worcester, Massachusetts, before retiring in 2021. He was known for his diligent work ethic and his knack for fixing things, whether it was a piece of machinery at the factory or a childâ€™s broken toy at home. His devoted wife, Anne Brewer, whom he married on the 21st of September 2002, often fondly described him as \"the man who could mend anything.\" He enjoyed riding ATVs, woodworking, Gardening, working on old cars, the great outdoors and rides with his wife Anne.\n\nMichael is survived by his loving family; his wife Anne Brewer, his step-daughter Heidi Sugalski (Derek), his children Lisa (Magnus) Johannsson, Michael (Katherine) Brewer Jr, Jason Brewer, Crystal Brewer, Christopher Brewer, and step-son Christopher Bachelder.
