        "text": "Wheeler Dealers TV host Mike Brewer has claimed he has been “scammed” by a buyer and has possibly lost thousands.\n\nThe presenter of the popular classic car restoration programme revealed a buyer had used fake information to purchase a vehicle in a simple crime.\n\nHowever, this led to a whole host of problems with Mike possibly losing the vehicle and the profits.\n\nHe informed his fans about the problem in a message on social media site X and uploaded a video explaining more.\n\nHe said: “We think we’ve been scammed not only once but possibly twice. Once by a customer who scammed somebody with their ID to buy a car but the second time quite possibly by the car provider.”\n\nREAD MORE Wheeler Dealers star predicts ‘modern classic’ will soon be worth ‘10 grand’\n\nMike explained how his One Automotive group had advertised a white VW Golf Mk7 GTD for just over £10,000.\n\nHe stressed there was initially lots of interest in the car but things quickly went downhill.\n\nAn interested motorist rang up to enquire about the car and quickly offered to buy the vehicle.\n\nHowever, as they were not based locally, the buyer instead arranged a collection service to pick up the vehicle at Mike’s Leamington Spa base.\n\nMike admitted that before letting the vehicle go they ran various checks on the buyer's personal information to process the sale.\n\nDON'T MISS\n\nWheeler Dealers host claims common Ford will be 'future classic' within years [LATEST]\n\nWheeler Dealers’ host says top used car is ‘bulletproof’ cheap vehicle [ANALYSIS]\n\nWheeler Dealers ‘decay’ warning to all classic car owners over summer error [COMMENT]\n\nBut, the buyer's driving licence “checked out” and the bank details provided appeared to be legitimate.\n\nThe individual was quickly invoiced with the courier arriving soon later to pick up the model for collection.\n\nHowever, Mike was quickly contacted by his own bank provider who revealed the person charged for the vehicle had disputed the sale.\n\nHe explained: “They tell us this chap has opened up his statement and he’s seen he has paid for a car at One Automotive and it wasn't him.\n\nInvalid email\n\nWe use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

We did our due diligence. We checked the card, checked the names and addresses and did everything we possibly could do.\n\n“And somehow now we get a reverse charge so we’ve now lost not only the car but the money as well. We are not at fault.”"
