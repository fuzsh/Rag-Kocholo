        "text": "THE car-lover is best known by petrol-heads as the Wheeler Dealers presenter.\n\nBut who is Mike Brewer, and what’s his net worth? Here’s what we know.\n\nWho is Mike Brewer?\n\nMark Brewer is a British television presenter and car enthusiast.\n\nHe was born in Lambeth, London, on August 28, 1964.\n\nBrewer is best known as the host of Wheeler Dealers, the Discovery Channel’s car programme, which he has presented since 2003.\n\nThe premise of the show is that Brewer and the other presenters have a mission to save old vehicles, fix up old cars on a budget, and sell them to a new owner.\n\nBrewer’s co-presenter has changed over the years: Edd China was his first co-host, followed by Ant Anstead, and most recently, Marc “Elvis” Priestley.\n\nBut Brewer is not only a presenter — alongside his television work, he is still active in the motor industry, and opened Mike Brewer Motors in 2012, a dealership in Sheffield.\n\nHe also launched the annual Used Car Award for used car dealers in the UK, a black-tie event in London.\n\nWhat is Mike Brewer's net worth?\n\nBrewer has an estimated net worth between $1.5 million and $4 million (£1.2 million to £3.2 million), owing to his long presenting career, and other business ventures.\n\nSome sources also indicate that his annual salary is $250,000.\n\nDespite his motor industry fame, Brewer is famously down-to-earth.\n\nIs Mike Brewer married?\n\nBrewer is married to Michelle Brewer, whom he married in 1992.\n\nMichelle was born on June 9, 1962.\n\nThe pair are thought to live in Warwickshire and have one daughter together.\n\nIn a 2023 interview, Brewer opened up about the impact his career has had on his marriage, saying: \"I've literally dedicated my life - 26 years actually - dedicated to this craft.\n\n\"And I feel like it's given me an amazing life but it's also come at the cost of my marriage.\"\n\n\"But there comes a time when I look and I think, maybe I should spend more time with my wife? She drives me mad but I love being with her,\" he added.\n\nBrewer often posts photos of Michelle with his Twitter followers, with captions such as:\n\n“Happy Birthday to my beautiful wife .. life with Michelle is wonderful, I’m so lucky. I love you tons”.\n\nMichelle, meanwhile, posts on Twitter under the username @MrsMBrewer.\n\nIn her Twitter bio, she describes herself as “The driving force behind #WheelerDealer”, so it appears the pair work as a team, and Michelle has a lot of involvement in the car industry.\n\nWhat other shows has Mike Brewer presented?\n\nBrewer started his television career in 1997, on Channel 4’s Deals on Wheels, and ITV’s Pulling Power.\n\nIn 1999, he presented Driven on Channel 4 for one year.\n\nThen in 2003, Wheeler Dealers started, on the Discovery Channel, which Brewer has presented ever since.\n\nIn 2009, Brewer presented another show on the Discovery Channel — Auto Trader.\n\nSince 2020, Brewer has also hosted the Wheeler Dealers spin-off show on the Discovery Channel, Wheeler Dealers: Dream Car.\n\nFor the Discovery Channel, Brewer has also presented Deals on Wheels, Wrecks to Riches, and Frontline Battle Machines.\n\nIn 2020, Brewer took a turn co-hosting a show called The World’s Greatest Cars, on Quest.\n\nAlongside television presenting, Brewer launched the Wheeler Dealer Podcast in February 2023, which has so far run for two series.\n\nWhat cars has Mike Brewer owned?\n\nIt comes as no surprise that Brewer has a significant collection of classic cars.\n\nBrewer’s first car was a beige Mini 850cc, but he has driven a wide range of cars in the interim period.\n\nIn 2021, Brewer announced that despite ridiculing electric cars, he’d taken the plunge and bought himself a Porsche Taycan.\n\nThat same year, Brewer decided to auction off a selection of his own cars, many of which he’s restored and maintained himself, at the Silverstone Auctions at NEC Classic Motor Show.\n\nIn the lot were a 1972 Citroen SM 2.7 four-seat coupé, a 1967 Mini Cooper 1275 S, a 1961 Austin Seven Mini 1961, a 1966 Ford Cortina Lotus Mk1, and a 2002 Ferrari 360 Spider F1.\n\nDespite his love for his collection of cars, Brewer’s schedule didn’t allow him the time to drive and car for all of them.\n\nBrewer has previously said he believes classic cars “are there to be driven. I know that first hand because I’ve got a collection.”\n\nHe said: \"Buy something you love, buy something you’re interested in because when you love the car you’re much more likely to be willing to spend time on it, to look after it, to drive it.”\n\nBrewer also revealed that his Ford Fiesta Mk1 was stolen in June 2023, a car that had been restored by Brewer and Priestly to mark the 20th anniversary of Wheeler Dealers.\n\nDespite offering a £5000 reward for the card, as of November 2023, it has not been recovered."
