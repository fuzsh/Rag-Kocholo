        "text": "Cubbage History, Family Crest & Coats of Arms\n\nOrigins Available:\n\nEngland\n\nThe name Cubbage was spawned by the ancient Anglo-Saxon culture that ruled a majority of Britain. It comes from the Old English given name \"Cobbold\" which literally means \"famous-bold.\" 1 2 The name appears in the Domesday Book as Cuboid; a personal name. 3\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly Origins of the Cubbage family\n\nThe surname Cubbage was first found in Northamptonshire, where Aluuinus Cubold is listed in the Domesday Book of 1086 4 1 Later, Ricardus Cubaldus was found in the Pipe Rolls of 1174 in Herefordshire; John Cubald in the Assize Rolls for Lancashire in 1219; Thomas Cutebold and William Cotebold in 1292, 1332-57 in Kent; and John Cobald in the Feet of Fines for Suffolk in 1309. 1\n\nThe Cabbage variant is most interesting. Derived from the Middle English word \"caboche,\" meaning \"head of cabbage,\" this nickname was first found in the Feet of Fines for Yorkshire in 1280 with Richard Caboche. A few years later, John Cabage was listed in 1304-1305. Much later, William Cabbage was listed in Essex in 1662. 1\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly History of the Cubbage family\n\nThis web page shows only a small excerpt of our Cubbage research.

Before English spelling became standardized over the last few hundred years, spelling variations in names were a common occurrence. As the English language changed in the Middle Ages, absorbing pieces of Latin and French, as well as other languages, the spelling of people's names also changed considerably, even over a single lifetime. Many variations of the name Cubbage have been found, including Cobbold, Cobbald, Cubald, Cubold, Cubaldus, Carbould, Cobald, Cubbel, Cubaud, Corbold, Corbould, Cubill, Cobell and many more.\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly Notables of the Cubbage family\n\nNotables of the family at this time include William Cobbold, a composer of the latter part of the sixteenth, and early part of the following century, was one of the ten musicians who harmonized the tunes for 'The Whole Booke of Psalmes with their wonted Tunes as they are song in Churches, composed into foure partes,' published by Thomas Este in 1592. 5 Thomas Cobbold (1680-1752), was an English brewer born in Rattlesdon, Suffolk who established a family brewery in Ipswich.

Those families hardy enough, and lucky enough, to make the passage intact were rewarded with land and a social environment less prone to religious and political persecution. Many of these families became important contributors to the young colonies in which they settled. Early immigration and passenger lists have documented some of the first Cubbages to arrive on North American shores:\n\nCubbage Settlers in United States in the 19th Century\n\nJames Cubbage, who arrived in Allegany (Allegheny) County, Pennsylvania in 1805 7\n\nWilliam Cubbage, who landed in Allegany (Allegheny) County, Pennsylvania in 1807 7\n\nGeorge Cubbage, who arrived in Allegany (Allegheny) County, Pennsylvania in 1807 7\n\nContemporary Notables of the name Cubbage (post 1700) +\n\nMike Lee Cubbage (1950-2024), American Major League Baseball player from 1974 to 1981, coach and manager\n\nBenjamin Cook \"B.C.\" Cubbage (1895-1961), American head football coach of the Virginia Tech Hokies from 1921 to 1925\n\nRelated Stories +\n\nThe Cubbage Motto +\n\nThe motto was originally a war cry or slogan. Mottoes first began to be shown with arms in the 14th and 15th centuries, but were not in general use until the 17th century. Thus the oldest coats of arms generally do not include a motto. Mottoes seldom form part of the grant of arms: Under most heraldic authorities, a motto is an optional component of the coat of arms, and can be added to or changed at will; many families have chosen not to display a motto.\n\nMotto: Rebus angustis fortis\n\nMotto Translation: Brave in adversity.\n\nCitations +\n\nReaney, P.H and R.M.
