        "text": "(1918–98). U.S. author Allen Drury is best known for Advise and Consent, a best-selling novel of intrigue in Washington, D.C. It was awarded the Pulitzer prize in 1960.\n\nAllen Stuart Drury was born in Houston, Tex., on Sept. 2, 1918. After graduating from Stanford University in 1939, he worked as an editor for newspapers in California until serving in the United States Army in 1942–43. After his service he worked for various publications in Washington, D.C., and in 1954 he joined the Senate staff of The New York Times. In 1959 he became the Washington correspondent for Reader’s Digest, a position he held until 1963.\n\nDrury drew on his experience in Washington in writing Advise and Consent (1959). The novel, about sexual and political scandal in the capital, was well received by critics and the public and was made into a Broadway play and a 1962 film. Drury’s other novels, most of which deal with politics, include A Shade of Difference (1962), Capable of Honor (1966), The Throne of Saturn (1971), Pentagon (1986), and A Thing of State (1995). The trilogy comprising Toward What Bright Glory? (1990), Into What Far Harbor? (1993), and Public Men (1998) follows the lives of fraternity brothers of the World War II generation from college through their careers. Drury completed Public Men just weeks before his death, on Sept. 2, 1998, in San Francisco, Calif."
