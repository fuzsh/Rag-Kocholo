        "text": "Owing to the screen size of your device, you may obtain a better viewing experience by rotating your device a quarter-turn (to get the so-called “panorama” screen view).\n\n“The whole narrative is permeated with the odour of\n\njoss-sticks and honourable high-mindedness.”\n\n– The Wallet of Kai Lung,\n\nErnest Bramah\n\nNotes\n\n· This is not a complete bibliography of each of the listed authors. It is a list of the books of each that I know and like. Omission of a given book may mean I didn’t think highly enough of it to include it or may simply mean that I haven’t read that book.\n\n· Each author name below is a link to a page here about that author. That page will contain the same list of the author’s books as does this page, plus a brief discussion of the author and those books. Those discussions are introductory, not profound analyses: they are only meant to help you rank the author and the books on your personal “to-read” list. (Right now, though all the author pages are there, the discussions are missing from some; I am completing them as I can.) The “stars” after each author name indicate my rough assessment of that author’s overall literary merit.\n\n· In alphabetizing the authors’ names, I have tried to follow the general style rules and, where I know of them, the authors’ choices. So, for example, Louis De Bernièrs sorts on “De Bernièrs” because that is apparently how he prefers it; but Antoine de Saint Exupéry sorts on “Saint Exupéry” because that’s how the French do it.\n\n· All listed books are novels or collections of stories each about the same few characters unless the listing is followed by an asterisk (*), in which case they are collections of unrelated stories.\n\n· Each book title below is, in turn, a link to a page at AbeBooks (if you don’t know who they are, click the link) showing all editions of that book currently available, new or used, and from which page you can—obviously—buy a copy of any such edition.\n\n· For some books, I link and refer to what I term a “preferred edition”. An edition can be the preferred one for a given book for any of several reasons; perhaps the commonest is that it is an omnibus of several related works, making it more convenient and usually less expensive than those works bought separately. Another reason might be that a given edition has special or extra material (such as the several “Annotated” works or, for example, the Gormenghast omnibus with several extensive critical essays included. Or the book might include especially good illustrations long associated with the text. You get the idea.\n\n· For a few authors—those of high quality with many works—I have included some books that I have not myself read, purely on the strength of authorship; each such book is marked with a “hash sign” (#) in front of the title. I intend to get to those books as quickly as resources—such as time—allow, though many are unavailable or available only at extortionate prices.\n\n· This site is premised on speculative-fiction works suitable for literate adults. Nonetheless, you will find some books listed here that are nominally “young adult” or even “children’s books”. That is because I feel that those particular books are readable for enjoyment by literate adults. That is especially true of the “children’s” classics, such as those by Lewis Carroll, Frank Baum and successors (notables from Gore Vidal to Salman Rushdie have praised the Oz books), E. Nesbit, J. M. Barrie, George MacDonald, and too many more to name. In this list, I have marked out what are supposedly “young adult” books with a [YA], and have noted “children’s books”.\n\n· You might want to also look at the listings on the two pages bullet-listed below, which are of authors and books not yet read here but which appear, for various reasons—typically, many strongly positive reviews by sources I consider credible—to be plausible candidates for these lists:\n\nOther Books by Authors Already Listed Here\n\nAuthors Not Yet Listed Here (and some of their works)\n\nReturn to the page top. ↑\n\nThe Authors:\n\nAckroyd, Peter *\n\n(For more possible titles by this author, see the “Unrated Books by Rated Authors” page.)\n\nFirst Light\n\nReturn to the page top. ↑\n\nAdams, Douglas ***\n\nThe Hitchhiker “Trilogy”:\n\n(The link above is to the one-volume omnibus; the links below are to the individual books.)\n\nThe Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy\n\nThe Restaurant at the End of the Universe\n\nLife, the Universe and Everything\n\nSo Long, and Thanks for All the Fish\n\nMostly Harmless\n\nThe Dirk Gently Duo:\n\n(The link above is to the one-volume omnibus; the links below are to the individual books.)\n\nDirk Gently’s Holistic Detective Agency\n\nThe Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul\n\nReturn to the page top. ↑\n\nAdams, Richard ***\n\n(For more possible titles by this author, see the “Unrated Books by Rated Authors” page.)\n\nWatership Down\n\nShardik\n\nThe Girl in a Swing\n\nReturn to the page top. ↑\n\nAickman, Robert ****\n\n(For more possible titles by this author, see the “Unrated Books by Rated Authors” page.)\n\nCold Hand in Mine *\n\nReturn to the page top. ↑\n\nAiken, Joan *\n\n(For more possible titles by this author, see the “Unrated Books by Rated Authors” page.)\n\nA Necklace of Raindrops *\n\nThe Faithless Lollybird *\n\nUp the Chimney Down *\n\nThe Last Slice of the Rainbow *\n\nThe Moon’s Revenge\n\nSnow White and the Seven Dwarfs\n\nThe Serial Garden: The Complete Armitage Family Stories *\n\nThe Green Flash *\n\nThe Far Forests *\n\nA Touch of Chill *\n\nA Whisper in the Night *\n\nA Foot in the Grave *\n\nGive Yourself a Fright *\n\nShadows and Moonshine *\n\nThe Haunting of Lamb House\n\nA Fit of Shivers *\n\nA Goose on Your Grave *\n\nA Creepy Company *\n\nReturn to the page top. ↑\n\nAjvaz, Michal **\n\nThe Other City\n\nThe Golden Age\n\n# Empty Streets\n\nReturn to the page top. ↑\n\nAldiss, Brian W. ****\n\nThe Malacia Tapestry\n\nReport on Probability A\n\nReturn to the page top. ↑\n\nAmis, Kingsley *\n\n(For more possible titles by this author, see the “Unrated Books by Rated Authors” page.)\n\nThe Green Man\n\nReturn to the page top. ↑\n\nAmis, Martin ***\n\n(For more possible titles by this author, see the “Unrated Books by Rated Authors” page.)\n\nOther People\n\nReturn to the page top. ↑\n\nAndrews, Allen *\n\nThe Plantagenet Duo:\n\nThe Pig Plantagenet\n\nCastle Crespin\n\nReturn to the page top. ↑\n\nArnason, Eleanor **\n\n(For more possible titles by this author, see the “Unrated Books by Rated Authors” page.)\n\nTo the Resurrection Station\n\nThe Sword Smith\n\nReturn to the page top. ↑\n\nAttanasio, A.

I offer instead a few comments.\n\nMoorcock seems to me an author capable of high-quality work who has elected, for whatever reasons (but likely financial ones), to substitute quantity for that quality. He is good enough that even his potboilers are passable reading, and the situation is exacerbated by the fact that his quirkiness has caused a devoted cult of followers, who—in my opinion—mistake originality for quality, to arise. What some will pay to read, others will write.\n\nI do not criticize Mr. Moorcock’s choice: it’s his life and I can sympathize deeply with a desire to lead life with as few distractions—like making money—as possible; it’s a shame that Moorcock’s real abilities get so few chances to show themselves, but there it is. I do criticize Moorcock’s work; though it is hard to generalize about so long a list, I would say that his Dancers at the End of Time and Von Bek series are respectable literature as is, in a way, Gloriana, while his various adventure series, though above average for such books, mostly each fit the old lady’s famous dictum, “This is the kind of book you will like if you like this kind of book.” They will pass a rainy afternoon, but that’s pretty much it.\n\nHere is a link to a comprehensive Moorcock bibliography.\n\nOf interest to Moorcock aficionados and completists is the Gollancz Michael Moorcock Collection, a set of 31 physical books plus several ebook-only companion editions comprising—almost—the entirety of Moorcock’s work, at least as of 2015 or so. These are not simple reprints but rather the “ldefinitive” editions, prepared with Moorcock’s oversight and frequent, if modest, revisions and updates. A simple list of the books is available, or you can see more details on the entire project. Note: a complete set of the print editions is somewhere around $600, which is around $20 a book.\n\nReturn to the page top. ↑\n\nMorley, Christopher ***\n\nWhere the Blue Begins\n\nThunder on the Left\n\nReturn to the page top. ↑\n\nMorris, William ****\n\nThe Glittering Plain\n\nGolden Wings *\n\nThe Wood Beyond the World\n\nThe Well at the World’s End\n\nThe Sundering Flood\n\nThe Water of the Wondrous Isles\n\nReturn to the page top. ↑\n\nMujica Láinez, Manuel ***\n\nThe Wandering Unicorn\n\n# Bomarzo\n\nReturn to the page top. ↑\n\nMunro, H.
