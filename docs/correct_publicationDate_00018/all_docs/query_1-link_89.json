In the last few days I’ve been: set up as the inside man in a drug ring, knocked out with a taser, set on fire by space pirates, and gotten one third of a lap dance. Humans are dying due to this venom crap from Saturn. Someone is raising hell in our solar system and I guess I'm along for the ride.",
