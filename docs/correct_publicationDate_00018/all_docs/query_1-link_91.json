        "text": "Pages\n\ndescription Page 1\n\nTHE GOLDEN AGE: OR, The Reign of Saturn REVIEW'D.\n\nNOT to trouble our Rea∣der with the Names or Writings of those many Ancient and Excellent Philosophers, who first Treated of this most Noble Art (seeing they writ very obscurely; and those Obscurities, by Collection, are swell'd into very large Volumes.) I will descend to such of them as are accounted Mo∣dern, and particularly to those, who have made Explication, for the sake and instruction of the Ingenious: And of\n\ndescription Page 2\n\nthose, none I presume more Learned, e∣specially more Generous, than they of the English Nation, how carelesly soever, their Works are look'd upon in this our Iron age: If any Man will contend for it, he has the liberty to produce his Proofs; but before I bring you to plain matter of Sense, give me leave to touch a little upon the accidents of Chance∣medley, and the down right Nonsense of conceited Ignorance; I mean such Authors as either by chance have pick'd up some Sentences proper enough in themselves, but yet disorderly applyed, and therefore lead to confusion, or else such as are not only Improper, but also Unnatural, and therefore are grosly Ri∣diculous.\n\nOf the first sort are many of the Col∣lections in the six Volumes of Theatrum Chemicum, by Lazarus Zetznerus, Fas∣ciculus Chemicus, Cheiragogia Heliana, Zeroasters Cave, or an Intellectual E∣cho, and the like.\n\nThe second sort are they, who only gather up the glimmering Recipes and Decipes, which are here and there Scattered on purpose, by the Jocose, to catch the unwary in their own Imagi∣nations, throwing to them the Shells, but reserving the Kernels for their\n\ndescription Page 3\n\nFriends, the cautious and diligent In∣quirers. Andyet these mistaken ones, fondly supposing themselves true Adep∣tists, immediatly thereupon cry out, Sirs, Wee will shew you Diana Naked, for we have caught her in our Volumes; When alas! She is slipt from their fin∣gers, having first Metamorphosed such daring Sophisters, not as she did Act∣eon into a swift sooted Beast with large Horn's, but into another sort as oppo∣sitly dull and slow with long Ears: and yet forsooth they cease not to cry out, Here are the Menstruums of Diana, here is Circulatum Majus & Minus, here are the Secrets of the more Secret Chemy. A Catologue of Menstruums, in four Books, under four and twenty Heads, and of four and twenty Kinds, all collected form the Writings of the Adepts; These my Friends (say they) are the Menstruums of Diana, for Diana has superfluity of Menstruums, she hath Simple, Vegetable Menstru∣ums, made of Philosophical Wine on∣ly, others of the Spirit of Philoso∣phical Wine, and the hottest Vege∣tables, Herbs, Flowers, Roots, &c. being Oyly.\n\nAlso, Simple Mineral Menstruums made of the matter of Philosophical Wine\n\ndescription Page 4\n\nonly, others of that and acid Spirits, as Aqua Fortis, Spirit of Nitre &c.\n\nAlso, Mineral Menstruums Compoun∣ded of Vegetable, and Mineral Menstru∣ums mixed together; Cum multis aliis quae nunc perscribere longum est.\n\nIf Men will be seduced by such Slipp∣slop-Sawse-makers, no wonder if at last they say, All is Vanity and Vexation of Chymists: But let us look upon them, and their fond followers no otherwise than meer Foolosophers, catch'd in a Mouse-trap.\n\nThis by way of removing the Rub∣bish, next we proceed to lay a sure Foundation for the Ingenious to Build on.\n\nThis Art, I say, and doubt not to make clearly appear, consists in the true knowledge of a Metalline Sulphur and Mercury, which are to be Compoun∣ded of four Metalline Principles or Ele∣ments, viz. Metalline Fire, Air, Earth and Water; all to be reduced into a quick, running, clear, and splendid Mercury; In which Mercury is contain'd the Grand Secret of the Philosophers, viz. their Sol and Luna, for then they say, Est in Mercurio quicquid quaerunt Sapientes; All is in Mercury that the\n\ndescription Page 5\n\nWise men seek: Because this prepared Mercury may easily be digested into Silver and Gold; and then also, and not till then, is this saying verified, Est¦tamen unum, &c. That there is in the Metalick Kingdom one thing of a mira∣culous Original, in which our Sol is nearer, than in Common Sol and Luna, if you seek it in the hour of its Nativi∣ty, &c. Introit apert. pag. 51. Which will melt in our Mercury, as will Ice in warm Water; and yet it hath resem∣blance with Gold. The same thing may be found by digestion in our Mercury for the spaee of an hundred and fifty days, &c. See Secrets Reveal'd, pag. 75. For this Mercury so digested into Sol and Lu∣na, will again easily be dissolved in that Mercury from whence it was form'd: Whereas to dissolve Common Gold by prepared Mercury, is a Work of great difficulty, and ought not to be attemp∣ted by any, unless he be an experienced Master in this Art, and yet he that so operates, shall labour for the worst and not the better, unless he knows how to car∣ry on both works a part, and afterwards in a due measure to Reconjoyn them.\n\nThis I say, is the Scope and Intention of all the Philosophers, and now it re∣mains, that I clear my Position.\n\ndescription Page 6\n\nThe Composition of these four Prin∣ciples or Elements is perfected by three Works or Operations.\n\n1. The first is the joyning of the Fire and Air.\n\n2. The second by adding the Earth to the other two.\n\n3. The third by joyning thereto the Liquor, or Element of Water.\n\nWhich are also by Prince Geber Cal∣led Medicines of the first, second, and third Order\n\nThese three Conjunctions are also called,\n\n1. Conjunction Diptative.\n\n2. Conjunction Triptative.\n\n3. Conjunction Tetraptive.\n\nOf which more hereafter.\n\nThe Philosophical Maxims are,\n\nMan from Man, Beast from Beast, and Metal from Metal, &c.\n\nDastin's Dream, Theat. Chem. Britt. pag. 259.\n\nA Man of Nature Ingendreth but a Man, And every Beast Ingendreth his Semblable; And as Philosophers rehearse well can, Diana and Venus in Marriage be not able,\n\ndescription Page 7\n\nA Horse with a Swine joyns not in a Stable, For where is made unlikely Geniture, What followeth but things Abominable? Which is to say Monstrum in Nature.\n\nPearce the Black Monk upon the Elixir. Theat. Chem. Britt. pag. 271.\n\nAll Salts and Sulphers far and nere, I. interdite hem alle in Fere, Alle corosive Waters, Blood and Hayre, Pyss, Hornes, Wormes and Saudiver, Alume, Atriment, also I suspende, Rasalger and Arsnick I defende, Calx Vive, and Calx Mort hys Brother, I suspend them both, one and other, For of all things I will no moe, But Foure Elements in general I say so, Sun and Moon Earth and Water; And here y's all that Men of clatter.\n\nNothing is oftener said by the Philo∣sophers than that their Stone is made of the four Elements. And Ripley in his Epistle to King Edward the IV. Theat. Chem. Britt. pag. 111. saith thus, viz.\n\nIn the said Boke the Philosopher speak∣eth also, Therein if it Please your Highnes for to Reade,\n\ndescription Page 8\n\nOf divers Sulphurs, but especially of two; And of two Mercuryes joyned to them indeed. Whereby he doth true understanders leade, To the knowledge of the Principles which be true; Both Red most pure, and White, as I have spede, Which be nevertheless founden but of right few. &c.\n\nThis I know also hath another Expo∣sition, of which hereafter.\n\nTheat. Chem. Britt. 152. Numb. 19, Ripleys Compound, Speaks thus,\n\nAnd be thou wise in chesing of thy Water, Medyll with no Salt Sulphure nor mene Minerall, For whatsoever any water to thee do clatter; Our Sulphure and Mercury be only in Mettal, Which Oylys and Waters som men call. Fowlys, and Byrds, with other names many one, Because that Folys should never know our Stone.\n\nSandivog. pag. 5. If thou dost purpose to make a Metall out of Herbs, thou shalt labour in pain, as also thou shalt not bring\n\ndescription Page 9\n\nforth wood out of a Dog, or any other Beast.\n\nAeyr. Phil. de Metall. Metamor. pag. 46. Qui vero ex Herbis & istjusmodi rebus Mercurium educere tentant sunt Minervae crassissimae at{que} ingenij nequissimi.\n\nAeyr. Phil. in his Ripley revived pag. 160. 161. &c. Some will say of my Book that I have writ very Enviously and Mis∣teriously: he calls the matter Gold and Mercury, but that is but Allusively; but he meant Egg-shells calcined, or Vitriol, or Mans Blood, or Dew, or Rain Water, or Salt Peter, or Nitre, or Tartar, or this or that thing (&c.) Gross Sotts, thus to think, that what I without any Equivocation call Gold and Mercury, they should make to allude to such trifles.\n\nO Fools and Blind! think you to ga∣ther Grapes of Thorns, or Figgs of Thisles. If Gold and Silver be your intention to produce, in what would you find them? in Eggs, or Blood, in Salts or such things, what a madness is this? (&c.)\n\nBut enough of these Cautions, tho' much more may be said from many o∣ther Authors. And if any raise an Ob∣jection, or put the Question, why this\n\ndescription Page 10\n\ngreat Universal Medicine, is only to be prepared from Metalls, they shall find it answered in another place.\n\nSandivog. pag. 79. If thou wilt imi∣tate Nature, let me perswade thee, to abide in the Simple way of nature, and thou shalt sind all good things.\n\nSimplicitas veritatis sigillum.\n\nThe Composition of the four Ele∣ments or Principles.\n\nNow to our purpose. Aeyrenaeus Phi∣lalethes natu Anglus, Cosmopolita, A true Adeptist, and the last and best Interpre∣ter of all the Ancient Philosophers, in his little Book called, Introitus Aper∣tus, &c. Shewing that this Work tends to digest Gold to the highest Purity and subtle Fixity, to which by Nature and Art it may be brought, says, their Gold is twofold, viz. Ripe Gold and Crude Gold, Male and Female (Sulphur and Mercury) That the whole Secret con∣sists in the Mercury, without which the work of Alchimy would be in vain.\n\nAnd in Chap. 2. Concerning the Prin∣ciples of which this Mercury is Com∣pounded, he saith, Sciant itaque, aquam nostram componi ex multis, &c. Let the Operators therefore know that our Water\n\ndescription Page 11\n\nis Compounded of many things, but yet they are but one thing made of divers created Substances of one Essence, that is to say,\n\n1. There is requisite in our Water, first of all, Fire.\n\n2. Secondly the Liquor of the Vege∣table Saturnia.\n\n3. The bond of Mercury. And\n\n4. (Therefore fourthly, by conse∣quence the Liquor of Mercury, and that which is common, so it be not Adulte∣rated.)\n\nThe first (for my intent) is the Ele∣ment of Metaline Fire, the second of Air, the third of Earth, the fourth of Water.\n\nThis will better appear in the 11th. Chap. pag. 18. De Inventione perfecti Magisterij, where he tells you, That the first Inquirers into this Magistery, sought only how they might exalt im∣perfect Metals to the nature of Gold, and perceiving, that all Metallick Bodies were of a Mercurial Original, and that Mercury was both as to its Weight and Homogeneity most like unto Gold, which is the perfectest of Metals; They therefore endeavoured to digest it to the maturity of Gold, that in order to this and to purify Mercury, they sought for\n\ndescription Page 12\n\nand found an active Metalline Sulphur in the House Aries, which they gave to the Off-spring or Child of Saturn (which Child abounded with the most Purged Salt of Nature, but had before no Me∣talline Sulphur in it) that then they en∣deavoured to purge Mercury with this prepared Matter or Air, but could not effect it, because they would not mix, therefore they contemperated this Air by the Doves of Diana, and then the e∣vent was answerable to their desires; and that this Mercury in its Coagulation yeilded them pure Sol and Luna, &c.\n\nNow to make the Planets Retro∣grade, here is Mercury the last Element, united by the Doves of Diana, to the Off-spring of Saturn, who was purified by a Metalline Sulphur or Fire; all which amounts to no more than a Com∣position of the four Metalline Elements, Water, Earth, Air and Fire. With this agrees the works of Prince Geber in his Medicines of the first, second, and third Orders.\n\nAlso the Intention of Basil Valentine, and Sandivogius, of the Arcanum, or Grand Secret of Hermetical Philo∣sophy, of Norton, Ripley and many o∣thers, (not to mention the more Anci∣ent) is the same\n\ndescription Page 13\n\nVera confectio Lap. Philo. pag. 121. Scopus istius Medicinae primi ordinis, est manifestare occultum, & occultare mani∣festum, quod fit omnia intus & extra mun∣dando.\n\nThe Fire, saith my Master (for so I will make bold to call that most Lear∣ned and Ingenuous Author Aeyrenaeus Philalethes) is of a Mineral Sulphur, and yet is not properly Mineral nor Metalline, but a middle betwixt a Mi∣neral and a Metal, and neither of them, partaking of both, a Chaos or Spirit, be∣cause our Fiery Dragon (who over∣comes all things) is notwithstanding penetrated by the Odour of the Vegita∣ble Saturnia; whose Blood concretes or grows together with the juyce of Satur∣nia, into one wonderful Body, yet it is not a Body, because it is all Volatile; nor a Spirit, because in the Fire it re∣sembles a molten Metal; it is therefore in very deed a Chaos which is related to all Metals as a Mother, &c.\n\nHere with the Fire, he takes occasion to joyn the Air, which two makes his Chaos, viz. The Fiery Dragon, and the Liquor of the Vegetable Saturnia; never∣theless I know that the Fire is sometime called Earth, and sometimes Water; so also is that of the Air and Earth; but it\n\ndescription Page 14\n\nis not properly our Air till the two first are Conjoyn'd and Purged.\n\nThis Chaos is called, our Arsenick, our Air, our Luna, our Magnett, our Calybs or Steel, but yet in divers re∣spects, because our matter undergoes various States before that the Kingly Diadem be brought, or cast forth out of the Menstruum of our Harlot.\n\nNote, The first is called Fire because it is, hot and dry, it is a flying Sol, and the Fire of Nature, and hath the Ope∣ration of Fire, which digesteth the crude Air and divideth the Mine from the Metal.\n\nThis is that Fire (says one) which the wise men have taken unspeakable pains to find out, It is Donum Dei, and they have called this mistery the Philosophers Stone, the Blessed Holy Stone, for this cause that God hath placed it in an Earthly Stony and contemptable matter, it de∣videth the good from the bad, and what is not mature it matureth, and in this mistery, according to the Similitude, it is called Sol or the Sun; and the other Principle is also called the Moon, because of her Crudeness and watry Humidity, but both being joyn'd together, is called our Chaos or Air.\n\nThe Fire by Basil is called Gold, also\n\ndescription Page 15\n\nby Sandivog, it is called the same, and sometimes Chalybs, by Ripley it is cal∣led Sol, by Norton it is called Lytharge, so Aeyrenaeus calls it, in his Treatise De vera confectione Lapidis Philosophici, pag. 21. And of the two first Principles calls it the Body. Quod ad corpus attinet sufficiat hoc tempore solo Lithargyrij vel corporis nomine vocare, Corpus autem hoc, ad omnes perferendas miserias est ordi∣natum, oportet enim transire per ignem & aquam, & renasci, aliter in requiem aeternam ingredi non poterit, cujus color est brunus subrubeus, & non fulgidus, Item opus ejus est dissolvi, exaltari mori & ad altum ascendere. It is also called Leo, and Servus Rubeus, Corpus Rubeus, &c.\n\nThe second Principle he also calls Wa∣ter, Aqua, prima, ignis corrodens, ignis contra naturam, Luna, magnes, mater, ma∣teria, &c.

Norton calls it, Titanos & Magnesia. Ripley calls it Venus, and the Green Lyon.\n\nWe will consider these two, the first, under the name of the Fiery Dragon, or Chalybs, which he says is the Minera of Gold: The second, he says is Satur∣nia,\n\ndescription Page 16\n\nor Magnet, and is the true Miner a of the Chalybs.\n\nSumantur Draconis nostri ignei, &c. Let there be taken of our Fiery Dragon, which hides the magical Chalybs in his own Belly four parts, of our Magnet nine parts, mix them together with a strong Fire, in the form of a Mineral Water, upon which there will swim a Scum, which is to be cast away, re∣move the Shell and take the Kernel, Purge it the third time with Fire and Salt, which will easily be done if Saturn shall behold himself in the Looking-Glass of Mars: Thence is made the Chamae∣leon or our Chaos, in which all Arcanas lies hid virtually but not actually. This is the Hermaphroditical Infant, (&c.)\n\nIntroit. apert. pag. 6. & 7. de Chalybe & Magnete, Our Chalybs is the true Key of our Work, without which the Fire of the Lamp could not be by any art Kindled: It is the Minera of Gold, a Spirit, very pure beyond others; It is an Infernal Fire, Secret, in its kind very Volatile, the wonder of the World, a System of the Superior Vertues in the Inferiors, and therefore the Omnipo∣tent hath mark'd it with that notable Sign, whose Nativity is declared in the East: Cujus Nativitas per Orientem in\n\ndescription Page 17\n\nHorizonte Hemisphiaerij sui Philosophi∣cum annuntiatur. pag. 7. Cursum dirigat per aspectum Astri Septentrionalis, quod faciet tibi apparere magnes noster, pag. 21. Quare activum Sulphur ulterius quae∣rentes, &c.\n\nWherefore seeking further for an ac∣tive Sulphur, the Magi sought most throughly, and at length found it hid∣den in the House of Aries. This Sul∣phur is most greedily received by the Of-spring of Saturn, which Metallick matter is most pure, most tender, and most near to the first Metallick ens, void of all actual Sulphur, but yet in a power to receive a Sulphur, wherefore it doth draw this to it self like a Magnet and swallows it up, and hides it in its own Belly, and the Omnipotent, that he might highly adorn this Work, hath Imprinted his Royal Seal thereon.\n\nSendivog. pag. 36. Recipe ergo ma∣rum vivum, &c. Take therefore a Li∣ving Male and a Living Female, joyn these together, that betwixt them there may be Conceived a Sperm, for the bringing forth of Fruit after its kind.\n\nPag. 44. Propterea unum datur Me∣tallum, &c. Moreover there is granted\n\ndescription Page 18\n\nto us one Metal, which hath a Power to consume the rest, for it is almost as their Water and Mother; yet there is one thing, and that alone, the radical Moisture, viz. Of the Sun and Moon that withstands it and is bettered by it, but that I may discover it to you, it is called Chalybs.\n\nPag. 45. Est & alius Chalybs, &c. There is also another Chalybs, which is like to this, created by it self of Nature, Qui scit ex radiis solis, &c. Which knows how by a wonderful Power and Vertue, to draw forth from the Beams of the Sun, that, which so many Men have sought after, and is the beginning of our Work. Here he singly names them both Chalybs, yet sometimes both joy∣ned together are called Calybs, as before.\n\nPag. 47. Naturalis ejusmodi est, &c. The natural Dissolution is this, That the Pores of the body be open'd in our Water, whereby the Seed that is digested may be sent sorth and put into it's Matrix; but our Water is Heavenly Water, not wetting the Hands, not vulgar, but almost Rain Water. 48. The Body is Gold which yeilds Seed. It is our Luna (not common Silver)\n\ndescription Page 19\n\nwhich receives the Seed of the Gold, &c. (This also alludes to the Great Work.)\n\nPag. 55. Fa••••igitur, &c. Cause therefore that there be such an operati∣on in our Earth, that the central heat may change the Water into Air, that it may go forth into the Plains of the World, and may scatter the residue as I said thro' the pores of the Earth, and then on the contrary the Air will be turn'd into Water, far more subtil than the Water was, and this is done thus; If thou wil'st give our old Man Gold and Silver to swallow, that he may consume them, and that he at length dying may be Burnt. [Let his Ashes be scattered in∣to Water, Boyl it until it be enough and thou shalt have a Medicine to cure the Leprosy.]\n\nPa. 63. Res est vilis & pretiosissima, &c. It is a thing of little account, yet most pretious, which being divers times de∣scribed, I do now again repeat: Take X. parts of Air, of Living Gold or Living Silver I. part, put all these into thy Ves∣sel, boyl this Air first until it be Water, and then no Water. If thou art Ignorant of this, and know'st not how to Boyl Air, without all doubt thou shalt Err,\n\ndescription Page 20\n\nseeing this is the matter of the ancient Philosophers; for thou must take that which is, and is not seen, until it be the Artificers pleasure. It is the Water of our Due, out of which is Extracted the Salt-peter of the Philosophers, by which all things Grow and are Nourished, Ma∣trix ejus est centrum solis vel Lunae, The Matrix of it, is the center of the Sun or Moon, as well Celestial as Te∣restial, and that I may tell more plain∣ly, it is our Magnet, which before I said was Chalybs: The Air generates the Magnet, and the Magnet generates or causes our Air to appear; Sanctè tibi veritatem hic manifestavi, &c. This is the Sal Akali, which the Philosophers have named, Salt Armoniack and Vegetable, hid in the Belly of Magnesia. Operatio ejus talis est; The operation of it is this, That thou Dissolve the Congealed Air, in which thou shalt Dissolve the tenth part of Gold, Seale this up and work with our Fire, until the Air be turn'd into Powders and there appear, the Salt of the World being had divers colours, &c. And a little after, pag. 64. Propte∣rea satis mihi fuit, &c. It therefore suf∣ficed me to treat only of the first and second matter, which is done clearly, &c.\n\ndescription Page 21\n\nIn his Eleventh Chapter, concerning the Practice, pag. 48. he say, Take of our Earth through xi. degrees xi. grains. of our Gold and not of the vulgar i. grain, of our Luna and not of the vulgar ii. grains, but be thou well advised that thou take not common Gold and Silver for these are dead; take ours which are Living, then put them into our Fire, and let there be made of them a dry Liquor, first the Earth will be resolved into Water, which is called the Mercury of Philoso∣phers, and that Water shall resolve those Bodies of Gold and Silver, and shall con∣sume them, so that there shall remain but the tenth part with one part, and this shall be the Metallick radical moisture, &c. And pag. 65. Perpende diligenter, weigh diligently what I have said before, viz. How the four Elements distil into into the center of the Earth a radical Moisture, and how the central Sun of the Earth by its motion, bringeth it forth, and Sublimes it to the Superficies of the Earth, &c. The same Author in his Philosophical Riddle, tells you, That Neptune shew'd him two Mines, the one of Gold the other of Chalybs.\n\nPage 77. That Saturn drew the Wa∣ter, and put into it of the Tree of the Sun, wherein it resolved like Ice in\n\ndescription Page 22\n\nwarm Water, and this Water is Aqua Vitae. That, that Water is the best which is drawn by vertue of our Cha∣lybs, which is found in the Belly of Aries, &c.\n\nIn the English Book of Hermetick Secrets, called Arcanum: Or, The Grand Secret, Numb. 11. you have these words, As for that clear Water, saught for by many, found out by few, yet obvious and profitable unto all, which is the Base of the Philosophers Work. A Noble Polonian, not more Famous for his Learning than Subtilty of Wit (not named) whose name not∣withstanding a double Anagram hath betrayed; In his Novum lumen Chymi∣cum, parabola, & Aenigma; as also in his tract of Sulphur, hath spoken free∣ly and largely enough: Yea he hath exprest all things of it so plainly, that nothing can be satisfactory to him that desireth more.\n\nNumb. 19. He says that most Philo∣phers have affirm'd that their Kingly work is wholly composed of the Sun and Moon. Others have thought good to add Mercury to the Sun: Some have chosen Sulphur and Mercury, others have attributed no small part in so great a work to Salt mingled with the other\n\ndescription Page 23\n\ntwo. The very same Men have professed, That this clear Stone is made of one thing only, sometimes of two, other whiles of three, at othertimes of four and of five; and thus, tho' Writing so variously upon the same Subject, doe nevertheless aḡree in sense and meaning, &c. He also adds,\n\nNumb. 20. That he holds that this intire work is perfected by two Bodies only; to witt, the Sun and the Moon rightly prepared.\n\nNumb. 46. The Philosophers Mercury, hath divers names, sometimes it is cal∣led Earth, sometimes Water in a divers respect, because it naturally ariseth from them both, the Earth is subtle white Sulphureous, in which the Elements are fix'd and the Philosophical Gold is sown, the Water is water of Life Burning Per∣manent, most clear, called the Water of Gold and Silver, &c. Last of all, the most precious substance is Venus, the Ancients Hermaphrodite, glorious in each Sex.\n\nNumb. 47. Seperate therefore the clean from the unclean, the Substance from the Accidents, and make that which is hid Manifest, by the course of Nature, otherwise make no further progress, for this is the Foundation of the whole Work, and Nature.\n\ndescription Page 24\n\nNumb. 48. That dry and most pre∣cious Liquor, doth constitute the Radi∣cal Moisture of Metalls, wherefore of some of the Ancients it is called Glasse, for Glasse is extracted out of the Radical Moisture, closely lurken in Ashes which will not give place, unless it be to the Hottest Flame, notwithstanding our in∣most or central Mercury, discovers it self by the most gentle and kindly (though a little more tedious) Fire of Nature.\n\nBut to come to our own English Authors.\n\nRipley in the Preface to his Medulla, tells the Arch-Bishop of York that if he would\n\nOf Phoebus vertue have knowledging, Then Saturns Child must Issue bring.\n\nTheat.

And they shall thee learn to pass it to bring, Beware therefore of too many, and hold thee to one thing.\n\ndescription Page 25\n\nThis one thing is nothing else but the Lyon Greene, Which some Fools imagine to be Vitriol Romane. It is not of that thing which Philoso∣phers meane, For nothing to us any corrosive doth per∣taine, Understand therefore or else thy hand refraine. From this hard Scyence, least thou do worke amiss, For I will tell thee truly, now marke what it is.\n\nGreen of colour our Lyon is not truly, But Vernant and Green ever-more en∣during, In most bitterness of Death he is Lively: In the Fire burning he is evermore Springing, Therefore the Salamander by the Fire living, Some men do him call, and some na o∣ther name, The Mettaline Menstrual, it is ever the same.\n\nSome call it also a Substance Exuberate, Some call it Mercury of Metalline Es∣sence,\n\ndescription Page 26\n\nSome Limus deserti, from his Body Eva∣cuate, Some the Eagle flying from the North with Violence: Some call it a Toad for his great Vehe∣mence. But few or none at all do name it in its kind, It is a privy Quintesscence, keep it well in mind.\n\nThis is not in sight, but resteth invisible, Till it be forced out of Chaos darke, Where he remaineth ever Indivisible, And yet in him is the foundation of our warke, In our Lead it is, so that thou it mark. Drive it out of him, so out of all o∣ther, I can tell the no better if thou we'rt my Brother.\n\nThen Imediately after in his second Book, he begins,\n\nSaturne in all, to this Art hath most re∣spect Of whom we draw a Quintessence most Excellent, (&c.)\n\nMars that is Martial in City and Towne, Feirce in Battail full of debate and strife,\n\ndescription Page 27\n\nA Noble Warriour and famous of Renowne, With Fire and Sword defendeth his own Life, He staineth with Blood and slayeth with a Knife.

The Cyclops having offended Mars, are represented to say,\n\nLet's find the Angry God and pardon crave, Lett's give him Venus, our poor selves to save.\n\nThey sought in Heaven, Mars knew his Fact so bad, He came out there, then one began to tell, Saturne turn'd from his Throne, a place had Not far from thence, hard by this Chry∣stall Well.

Chym. and particularly in his Preface speaking of their three Mercurys, Pag. 125. says thus,\n\nBodies with the first we calime Naturally, Perfyt, but none which be unclene. Exept one whych usually, Namyd by Phylosophers the Lyon Greene, He ys the mean the Soon and Moone Betwene,\n\ndescription Page 31\n\nOf joyning Tinctures with perfytness, As Geber thereto beryth Wytness. (&c.)\n\nNow we are return'd back again to the Works of Geber, of whose writings, I say my Master Aeyrenaeus is the best Interpreter, and doth give the best ac∣count of all the Names which to each of these two first Principles may properly in any manner be applyed, and which are many, as witnesseth his Enarratio Methodica Trium Gebri Medicinarum, Yet because in his Book called Ripley Revi∣ved, (which he says he intends as a key to all his formmer writings) he hath ex∣plained these two Principles, without any room for Doubt or Exception, we will examine them, to try if they be plain and easy, and answering or rather confirming what is before recited.\n\nIn his Exposition upon Sir George Ripleys Epistle, in pag. 20. of this Book, he writes thus,\n\nTake then the most beloved Daugh∣ter of Saturne, whose Arms are a Circle Argent, on it a Sable Cross on a Black Feild, which is the Signal note of the Great World, Espouse her to the most Warlike God, who dwells in the House of Aries, and thou shalt find the Salt\n\ndescription Page 32\n\nof Nature, with this Salt Acuate thy Water, as thou best knowest, and thou shalt have the Lunary Bath, in which the Sun will be amended.\n\nAnd in the same Book in his Exposi∣tion upon the Praeface of Sir George Riply, pag. 7. He saith of the Fire,\n\nThat it inhabits, the Fiery Dragon, and it yeilds its Soul to the true Saturnia, and is Embraced by it, and both be∣come one together, bearing the Stamp of the Most High, even the Oriental Lucifer, the Son of the Morning: This Soul is Chalybs Magical Volatile, and very tender, the true Minera of Sol, out of which Sol Naturally proceeds, which I my self know to be true, and have spoken of it in my little Latin Treatise called, Introitus apertus ad oc∣clusum Regis palatium.\n\nThis is true Sulphur, which is imbil∣ed by the Mercuriallity of Saturnia, and notes it with the Royal Signet, &c.\n\nBut to put the matter clear out of doubt, and beyond any cause of Ob∣jection, let us view some of his Philoso∣phical Verses, which he calls, The Lear∣ned Sophies Feast.\n\ndescription Page 33\n\nVide. His Exposition upon the Pre∣face of Sir George Ripley, pag. 49.\n\nWhoso would lasting and Eternal Fame, Deserve, learn thou the Lyon Green to tame. (&c.)\n\nThis Horrid Beast, which we our Lyon call, Hath many other Names, that noman shall, The truth perceive, unless that God direct, And on his darkened mind a Light re∣flect, (&c.)\n\nBut its because of the transcendent force. It hath, and for the rawness of its source, Of which the like is no where to be seen, That it of them is named the Lyon Green, (&c.)\n\nThere is a Substance of a Metallin' Race If you the matter view, whoselowring Face A Sophister would at first sight so scare, (&c.)\n\nAnd yet O strange! a wonder to relate, At this same Spring naked Diana sate, (&c.)\n\nYet further for to answer your desire, I say this Subject never felt the Fire, Of Sulphur Metalline, but is more crude Than any Mineral, (&c.)\n\ndescription Page 34\n\nAnd its Components are, a Mercury, Most pure, though tender with a Sulphur dry, Incarcerate, which doth the Flux re∣strain, (&c.)\n\nAnd hinders the sweet Communion of This Virgin Lead, and her dear Sis∣ter, &c. Which would otherwise warm a Bath for Sol, (&c.)\n\nKnow then the Subject, which the sure base Of all our secrets is, and it un case, (&c,)\n\nTis, our Stone, it is Saturn's Child, Its Constitution is Cold, it must there∣fore be mixed with another Sulphur, found in the House of Aries, (&c)\n\nOur Subject it is no ways Malleable It is Metalline, and its Colour Sable, With intermixed Argent, which in Veins The Sable Feild with glittering Branch∣es stains. (&c.)\n\nThis is sufficient to shew the nature of the two first Principles, and the ne∣cessity of their Conjunction.\n\nAnd this differs not from what Basil Valentine Writes, who teaches to Dis∣solve Gold by a deep glittering Mineral,\n\ndescription Page 35\n\ngrown in the Mine of Saturne, and is of the first matter of Metals.\n\nAlso in his Treatise of Natural and Supernatural things, he says, Mars and Venus can perform nothing to attain any thing with wealth without the Lyon. And says, their Melioration lies conceal'd in their Signet Star or Magnet, out of which all Metals have themselves recei∣ved their Gifts.\n\nThen Speaking of the first matter from the Center, he says tis compared to the middle World, he further says, 'tis a true water, a Soulish water, the Mother of all Metals; is heated by the Spirits of Sulphur, which by its digesti∣on makes the Earthly Body Lively, wherein the Salt is evidently found, which preserves from Putrefaction, &c.\n\nAnd in the third Chapter of the Spi∣rit of Mercury, pag. 43. he says, All visible Tangible things are made of this Spirit: That it is a meer Air flying, a moving wind, but if it can be caught and made Carporal, it resolves into a Body, and becomes a pure clear Tran∣sparent Water, and the first Mercurial Root of the Minerals and Metals. That it is that Celestial water whereof very much hath been written, for by this Spirit of Mercury all Metals may if need\n\ndescription Page 36\n\nrequire, be broken, opened and resolved into their first matter without Corro∣sive: That this is the Master Key of his second Key, (&c.)\n\nAnd pag. 59. That this Spirit of Mer∣cury is the only true Key, and that without it, you can never make Cor∣poral Gold potable, nor the Philosophers Stone.\n\nThis also may suffice, to shew that all the Philosophers are upon one and the same Foundation, and do mean one and the same thing, and process.\n\nThe Purifying and Joyning of these two first Principles is contain'd in the gross or foul work, as appears by Norton in his Ordinal. Chap. 4. Theat. Chem. Britt. pag. 45. Where he tells us of two kinds in the grounded Matter: Their Names he says are before, viz. Magnetia & Litharge.\n\nThese two Principles he also calls two Stones.\n\nIn Chap. 3. Pag. 41. Speaking to Tonsile, he saith,\n\nMany things helpeth to apt our Stone, But two be materials, yet our Stone is one.\n\ndescription Page 37\n\nThen he says they are as Mother and Child, as Male and Femal, Sister and Brother, as in Pag. 43. And afterwards thus in Pag 41.\n\nOne of thes kindes a Stone ye shall finde, For it abideth Fire as Stones doe by kinde: But it is no Stone in touching ne in sight, But a subtill Earth, Brown, roddy, and not Bright; And when it is seperate and brought to his appearage, Then we name it our grounde Litharge. First it is Browne, Roddy, and after some deale White, And then it is called our chosen Markasite: One ounce thereof is better then fifty pounde; It is not to be Sould in all Christian Grounde; But he that would have it he shall be faine To doe it make, or take himselfe the paine: But one great grace in that labour is saine, Make it once well and never more againe, Old Fathers call'd it thing of Vile price, For it is nought worth by way of Mar∣chandise: No Man that findeth it woll beare it a∣waie, No more then thei would an ounce of Claye;\n\ndescription Page 38\n\nMen will not beleive that it is of High Price, No Man knoweth it therefore but he be wise. Here I have disclosed a greate Secret Wonder, Which never was Writ by them which been Earth under.\n\nAnother Stone Tonsile you must have withall, Or else you fawte your cheefe Material; Which is a Stone Gloriouse Faier and Bright, In bandling a Stone, and a Stone in sight; Being of Wonderfull Diaphanitie, The price of an ounce conveniently, Is Twenty Shillings or well neere thereby; Her name is Magnetia, few people her knowe, She is fownde in high places as well as in lowe; Plato knew her Property and called her by her name, And Chaucer rehearseth how Titanos is the same, In the Channons Yeomans Taile, say∣ing what is thus, But Quid ignotum per Magis ignoti∣us, (&c.)\n\ndescription Page 39\n\nNow here you may know what is Magnetia, Res aeris inqua latet scientia divinaque mira. These two Stones, Tonsile, ye must take For your Materials, Elixir if you make. Albeit the first tyme Materials be no more, Yet many things helpeth as I said before. This Secrete was never before this daye So trewly discovered, take it for your praye; I pray God that this turne not me to Charge, For I dread sore my Penn goeth too large, (&c.)\n\nHere you see how cautious he is of discovering too much, and yet he must be well read in this Art, that can by his Words know these two Principles; but he tells us he was taught by a Master, and I sup∣pose received his Secret under an Oath; for in pag. 11. he hints as much in these Words, and the Figure there representing the same.\n\nSecreta Sctoe Alkymiae secrete servabo.\n\nAccipe donum Dei sub sigillo secreto.\n\ndescription Page 40\n\nIn Pag. 47. He speaks to this effect, That the foulest Work is to clarifie our means Mineral; that Extremities may not well be wrought without many means wisely sought, and that every mean must be made Pure; that the gross Work is soul and full of Perils, and that the Clerk as well as Lay-man may fail in it. And as for Magnetia he says thus, (viz.)\n\nNemo primo fronte reperitur discretus. And once I heard a wise Man say, How in Catilonia at this day, Magnetia with Mineral means all, Be made to sale if ye for them call, Whereby the hands of a cleanly Clerke, Shall not be filed about so foule a Werke.\n\nAnd here you may observe, that as the first is purified by the second, he calls it Litharge; and as the se∣cond is purified by the first he calls it Magnesia.\n\nThe Conjunction of both is called, Rebis & resuna, Aes Philosophorum, Arsenicum, Air, Chaos, Herma∣phrodite, with many other Names, of which hereafter.\n\ndescription Page 41\n\nThis Magnetia, it seems, was to be had ready prepared in Catalonia; and truly it may be now had ready prepared in England, though the Preparors make it not for this purpose, and not always after the true Metalline way; 'tis best the Artist prepare it himself. Again, the preparing of it is something dange∣rous to the Work-man. Norton speak∣ing of the Fires to be used in this Work, pag. 104. says,\n\nFor Magnetia is Fier of Effusion, Full of Perills and full of Illusion; Not onely perill which to the Warke maie fall, But such alsoe which the Master hurte shall, Against which once received is no boote, Ordaine therefore to fetch breath from your Foote.\n\n'Tis true, the Scent in preparing it is not Pleasing, Smelling Sulphureous, and like late-made Graves newly open'd, like dead Mens Bones, as saith Basil Va∣lentine; yet not so dangerous as repre∣sented.\n\nBut to return to Chaucer, who calls it Titanos, in his Tale of the Chanons Teoman, Theat. Chim. Britt. page 254. he writes thus.\n\ndescription Page 42\n\nLo thus saith Arnolde of the new Toune, As his Rosayre maketh mencioune: He sayth right thus withouten any lye, There may no Man Mercury mortifie; But if it be with his Brothers knowledg∣ing; Lo how that he which firste sayd this thyng Of Phylosophers Father was, Hermes. He sayth how that the Dragon doutlesse Ne dyeth not, but if he be stayne With his Brother: And this is for to sayne, By the Dragon Mercurye and none other, He understood that Brimstone was his Brother. That out of Sol and Luna were ydrawe, And therefore say'd he, take heed to my Sawe. Let no Man besye him this Arte for to Seche, But he that the entention and Speche Of Phylosophers understonde can, And if he do he is a leud Man: For this Science, and this Connyng (quod he) Is of the Secre of the Secres Parde. Also there was a Disciple of Plato, That on a tyme sayd his Master to:\n\ndescription Page 43\n\nAs his Book Senior wool bere Wytnesse, And this was his demaunde in Sothfast∣nesse Tellme the name of the privy Stone? And Plato answered unto him anone, Take the Stone that Tytanos Men name, Which is that (quod he?) Magnatia is the same, Said Plato; ye Sir, and is it thus? This is ignotum per ignotius: What is Magnatia good, Sir I you pray? It is a Water that is made, I say Of Elements four (quod Plato) Tell me the Rock good Sir (quod he tho) Of that Water, if it be your will. Nay, nay (quod Plato) certayne that I nyll. The Philosophers were y Sworne e••hone, That they shulde discover it unto none, Ne in no Boke it write in no mane••e, For unto Christ it is so lefe and dere, That he wol not that it discovered be, But where it liketh to his Deite; Man to enspyre and eke for to desende, Whan that him lyketh, to this is his ende.\n\nThus you see how the ancient Philo∣phers were Sworn not to discover their Rock of clear Water, and that this Work is the highest piece of Philoso∣phy\n\ndescription Page 44\n\nin Nature. This Water is made of the four Elements said Plato; so is the joyning of the two first Principles said to be the mixing of the four Elements; the one being Hot and Dry, the other Cold and Moist. This Water is also called Aqua Divina, Aqua Benedicta, Aqua Coelestis, (&c.) with many other Names.\n\nOne Author (that shall be nameless) speaking of the Conjunction of these two Principles, saith it is a Magistery, and calleth the first the Divine Instru∣ment, and the second he calls Mercury, and saith that the Addition of the In∣strument, that is Quintessence, goeth through the Mercury, and remaineth with it; and seeing that Quintessence belongeth to Life, it changeth the Mer∣cury, so that now Mercury is nothing else but Life also; and this Operation is done very quickly, without any ele∣mental Working, for as every Work∣man adorneth his Work, and giveth it his Mark, by the which the Master∣piece is known, so also God Marketh this his Creation, and giveth it the no∣blest Sign that is in Heaven. (&c.)\n\nSo, now you have his Words, you may easily find out the Man. He also calls this Matter (being purged) Lu∣na;\n\ndescription Page 45\n\nso soon (saith he) as Mercury perceiveth the power of God Sol, it is no longer Mercury but Luna, that this Mercury is wholly changed and turn'd about; so that was inward is drawn out∣ward, but no part separated from ano∣ther, &c.\n\nBut what needeth many Words, you have the thing before so sufficiently described, that I may say, he that can∣not thereby easily name it, savoureth nothing at all of Ingenuity.\n\nThis Soul (saith my Master) as it is drawn from the Saturnia sollid and dry, is called our Air, or rather the Chamelion, which is an Airy Body (but indeed it hath a hundred other Names.)\n\nThis, says he, is true Sulphur which is imbibed by the Mercuriality of Satur∣nia, and Notes it with the Regal Sig∣net; and being united and revived into a Mineral Water, by the mediation of Dianas Doves, it is the sharp Spirit, which in the Water, moves the Body to putrefie, &c [Thus is made a Medi∣cine of the first Order by Calcina∣tion.]\n\ndescription Page 46\n\nNext we will proceed to the third Principle of Earth, after we have observed a few of the Names of these two Principles: First as they are apart, and afterwards as they are joyned; besides such as you have heard before.\n\nFirst of the Air, Female, or Water of dissolving Mercury.\n\nAeyrenaes in his Opus Tripartitum, or Vera Confectio Lapidis Philosophici, in the Division, De principali proprietate Mercurii dissolventis, pag. 21. amongst others, sets down these; Acetum, Aqua, aqua prima, aqua artis, aqua simplex, balneum, Coelum, humiditas, Ignis humi∣dus, ignis contra naturam, liquor vege∣tabilis Crudus, Luna, Mater, Materia Lunaria, mercurius crudus, mercurius dissolvens, Ministerium primum, Quinta Essentia, Spiritus crudus, Spiritus cocti Sepulchurum, Sperma Mercurii, Stoma∣chus Struthionis, vas Philosophorum, Vi∣sitatio occultorum, & argentum vivum crudum à minera simpliciter extractum.\n\nPag. 48.

After he hath shew'd how to joyn and purify the two first Principles; he says of them, Hic est Infans Hermaphroditus, &c. This is the Hermaphroditical Infant, which even from his Cradle hath been infected by the biting of the Corascene Mad Dog, whereby he is besotted and distracted with a perpetual Hydrophoby. Yea though the Water be nearer him than any natural Thing, yet he abhors it and flies it. O Fates! But yet there are in the Wood of Diana two Doves which can asswage his Madness, (&c.) The English Book (or Secrets Reveal∣ed) adds pag. 16. [if applied by the Art of the Nymph Venus, then least he should again relapse, &c.] And pag. 17. it runs thus (speaking of these Doves) supply the Feathers, and the Eagle will fly away, and leave the dead Doves of Diana; which except they shall be dead at the first receiving, they cannot be profitable, &c. The Latin Book, or Introitus Apertus, says thus, pag. 13. Fulgente Luna in suo plenilunio pennas suppedita, & avolabit Aquila re∣lictis pone se mortuis Dianoe calumbis, quoe si primâ acceptione fuerint mortuae, pro∣desse nequeunt: There is a great diffe∣rence\n\ndescription Page 51\n\nbetwixt being dead and being alive.\n\nAnd Sendivogius, pag. 110 Lat. 76 Engl. saith, If in any Science or Art it doth much help or hurt to have one word lacking, or added, than much more in this. As for Example, it is written in one place, Then mix these Waters together; another adds Not: He indeed added but a little, and not∣withstanding he made the whole Chap∣ter quite contrary, (&c.) But to re∣turn to our purpose.\n\nIntroit. Apert. pag. 21. Shewing that the Off-spring of Saturn hath no actual Sulphur in it, says, It hath en∣tred into League with a burning arseni∣cal Sulphur, and therefore appears not under a mercurial Form, (&c.) But af∣ter it hath swallowed the Sulphur of Aries, he says, the Magi tried to purge Mercury therewith, but the Event did not Answer, because there was yet mix∣ed an arsenical Malignity in the Sul∣phur so swallowed; which though now it was but little, in respect of that abun∣dance which it had in its mineral Na∣ture; yet it hindred all Ingress. Where∣fore they tried to contemperate this malignity of the Air by the Doves of\n\ndescription Page 52\n\nDiana, and the Event answered their Desires, Tum vitam vitae commiscue∣runt, (&c.)\n\nIntroitus Aper. Chap. 14. pag. 37 says, to this purpose, We have more∣over shewn that the preparation of the true philosophical Mercury is difficult: Tamque difficilis ut opus sit peculiari Dei gratia, si quis ad exactam ejus notitiam prevenire cupierit. The English Book af∣ter the word difficult adds these words, pag. 52. [The main knot lying in finding out Dianas Doves which are folded in the everlasting Arms of Ve∣nus, which no Eyes but a true Philo∣sopher ever saw. This one Skill per∣forms the Mastery of Theory, enables a Philosopher, and unfolds to the know∣er of it all our Secrets. This is the Guordian Knot which will be a Knot for ever to a Tyro in this Art, except the Finger of God direct.] Yea so dif∣ficult, &c.\n\nI know not what to say of this, and several other passages in the English Book, which was publi∣shed by W. C. directed to the Honourable the Lord Lucas, Ba∣ron of Shenfeild in Essex, Anno 1669.\n\ndescription Page 53\n\nAfter the Author's Preface, there is this Admonition.\n\nREADER,\n\nTHE true Manuscript Copy, which John Langius, in his Preface, doth so much thirst after, is here publi∣shed for thy Benefit, in which thou wilt find considerable Enlargements and Ex∣planations, wherein the Latin Transla∣tion is deficient, as Witnesseth Chap. 15. &c.\n\nBut this is plain that Aeyrenaeus re∣fers to the Latin Introitus Apertus, as appears in his Preface to Ripley Revi∣ved, Printed 1678. and there he says, that he had lately wrote the Introitus, &c. yet that by John Langius (which I have) was Printed Amsterdam 1667.\n\nI suppose this W. C. is the same that publish'd The Philosophical Epitaph of W. C. Esq 1673. Dedicated to the Honourable Robert Boyle, Esq for there in his Preface, before that part, called, A Brief of the Golden Calf, he menti∣ons the open Entrance to the shut Pa∣lace of the King.\n\ndescription Page 54\n\nNow let us see what he hath learned from it; in his Epitaph, pag. 15. he de∣clares the preparation of Mercury in these words; viz.\n\nFor Mercuries preparation is thus: viz. By a Mineral with Sable Silver∣veins, which is the Dragon born in Sa∣turns Den, devouring Cadmus with his earthly Men.\n\nFirst then this Dragon double strength to Mars, Must be yet pierc't by him being God of Wars; Then both will perish and become a Star, Where the young King is born who is So∣lar. Then wash equal Venus in's Blood, and let Them joyn till Vulcan take them in a Net; Which Mercury gently on his Wings must bear, Till he steals their Wealth, and Sols Body tare; Wherein then Sol will freely shed his Seed, And this is all whereof we stand in need, Which ordered right you cannot choose but speed, (&c.)\n\ndescription Page 55\n\nThis is very plain (if true) first a Dragon pierc't by Mars, then wash e∣qual Venus in's Blood, which Mercury must gently bear on his Wings, where∣in then Sol, &c.\n\nHere we find his third Principle in the Mercury is Venus, which, I suppose, he gathered from these words, in the open Entrance; viz. But yet there are in the Woods of Diana two Doves which can asswage his frantick Mad∣ness, if applied by the Art of the Nymph Venus, (&c.) and from these words. [The main Knot lying in finding Dianas Doves, which are folded in the everlasting Arms of Venus, (&c.)] and from these words p. 77.\n\nIf then thou work in Sol Vulgar be sure to procure the Marriage of Diana Venus in the beginning of the Espou∣sals of thy Mercury, then put them into the Nest, (&c.) The Latin thus, p. 52: Quare si cum Sole vulgi fueris operatus, cave ut Veneris connubia sollicitè compa∣res, deinde thoro suo impone, (&c.) I doubt me whether W. C.

Juvenis ala∣tus est Mercurius, Chaos seu Infans Her∣mophroditus est Regulus Stellatus.

Well then the Doves of Diana are Salts it seems. Salts, says he, What Salts? Nay, who can tell? He might as well have said nothing of them. What shall we do now then? Why, e'en go to Aeyrenaeus himself, and hear what he says of them.\n\ndescription Page 63\n\nRipley Revived, pag. 24. In this our Work our Diana is our Body, when it is mixed with the Water, for then all is called the Moon; for Laton is whiten∣ed, and the Woman bears Rule: Our Diana hath a Wood; for in the first days of the Stone, our Body, after it is whitened, grows vegetably. In this Wood are at the last found two Doves; for about the end of three weeks the Soul of the Mercury ascends with the Soul of the dissolved Gold: These are infolded in the everlasting Arms of Ve∣nus; for in this Season the Confections are all tincted with a pure green Colour: These Doves are circulated seven times, for in seven is Perfection, and they are left dead, for they then rise and move no more; our Body is then Black like to a Crows Bill, for in this Operation all is turned to Powder, blacker than the blackest. (Such passages as these, &c.)\n\nGentlemen, How do you like this, is it not very plain? I hope you are now throughly Satisfied: but stay, methinks you look soomewhat angerier than be∣fore, all is not well I doubt, let us read on then; pag. 25. Such passages as these we do oftentimes use when we speak of the preparation of our Mercury; and\n\ndescription Page 60\n\nthis we do to deceive the Simple; and and it is also for no other end that we confound our Operations, speaking of one, when we ought to speak of another, for if this Art were but plainly set down, our Operations would be Contempt∣able even to the Foolish, &c.\n\nHo, ho, my Master, you intend then to deceive us simple ones, do you? But hold we will not let you go so, because your Work is truly Natural. You therefore take the Liberty to confound the Philosophers Work, with that which is purely Natures Work, that so ye might keep the simple in Igno∣rance concerning your true Vinegar, which being unknown, our labour is wholly lost, &c. This is very fine in∣deed: To what purpose have I (and many more) taken so much pains, and laid out so much Money to buy your Books, and spent so much time in Reading them, nay moreover run the hazard of cracking my Brain with thinking upon it, and some say I have done it already; and if it be so, l'le lay the whole blame upon you, and Master Sendivogius, &c. Nay I will not excuse Prince Geber himself, that is so subtile in his Sum of Perfection.\n\ndescription Page 61\n\nAeyren.\n\nBe not so Angry young Man, nor yet so hasty—Have you con∣sidered well what the Philosophers write.; are you so fitly qualified as Sendivogius, and the others direct, and have you duely observed their Directi∣ons?\n\nHort.\n\nSir, I Humbly beg your Par∣don, I did not perceive you was so nigh at hand, I readily acknowledge, that this Art cannot be Fathom'd, much less, enjoy'd by all men: I confess my self not to be so Prepared and Qualified, as the matter requires, and am altoge∣ther unworthy of so great a Gift, and therefore I fear must now bid both it and you, a long farewel, (Good Sir) Farewel.\n\nAeyren.\n\nBut hold, stay a little, Did not you say e'en now, that I should be unto you as a Master? Are you not advised to abide in the simple way of Nature, to persist in the Text, and to wait with patience, &c? I am not willing you should thus loose your labour, as you call it, tho' what you have taken there∣in amounts not to the tenth part, which some others far more deserving than your self have done, and yet never made such large Exclamations; If J. be your\n\ndescription Page 58\n\nMaster, Let me hear you now repeat the Principles and Foundation of this Art.\n\nHert.\n\nSir, I shall do it readily, since you are pleased to require it. This Art con∣sists in the Metalline Kingdom only, in Metals from Metals, and by Metals; It is built upon four Metalline Princi∣ples or Elements, Fire, Air, Earth and Water, That the two first joynd are Radix Artis and the true Key: That enough of them hath been said already, that we are now seeking out the third Principle of Earth, the Doves of Diana, which reconciles the two first to the last; that therefore they must be of a Metalline Nature, and make the second Work, which may be called Conjun∣ction Triptative, &c.\n\nAeyren.\n\nNow see if in my Writings, I have not sufficiently touched this Principle of Earth, or the Doves of Diana.\n\nHert.\n\nSir, I thank you for your seasonable Advice; and, with your Favour, I will make a further search.

Name your Author therefore, for certainly he is one of the plainest that ever writ concerning this Principle.\n\nHor.\n\nHe is no plainer, Sir, in this than in the rest, but his Book is of small Account; and I must beg your Pardon, Sir, because in your Preface to Ripley Revived, after you have told us what light you received from Bernard Tre∣visan; you say next to him, or ra∣ther before him, in some respects, is an Author whom you will not name, &c.

Mer∣curius enim Vulgi est Aqua, sed deest ei Spiritus et vis ignea ad urendum: Supple si potes quod deest summo cum Artisicio, tum non amplius erit Mercurius Vulgi, sed similis nostro, sed si hoc facere non pos∣sis, dimitte istum Mercurium, quia nihil ab ipso praeter damnum expectare possis. Ecce jam deus est testis, rem totam nar∣ravi, quam si prudens fueris ignorare non possis, &c.\n\ndescription Page 74\n\nIntroit. Apert. pag. 19: Quare agno∣verunt tandem, &c. Wherefore the wise Men did at length know that the wa∣tery Crudities, and the earthly Faeces did hinder it from being digested, which being fixed in the Roots thereof, cannot otherwise than by Inversion of the whole Compound be rooted out; they knew, I say, that Mercury, if it could but put off those things, it would pre∣sently become fixed, &c.\n\nIn our Conjunction four Elements be ag∣gregat, In dew proportion fyrst whych asonder were separat.\n\nRipley Rev. draws a Conclusion in these words; Our Art therefore is to compound two Principles (one in which the Salt, and another in which the Sulphur of Nature doth abound) which are not yet perfect, nor to∣tally imperfect; and by consequence may therefore, by our Art, be exchan∣ged, or exalted; which that which is totally perfect cannot be; and then by common Mercury to extract not the Pondus, but the Coelestial Vertue out of the Compound; which Vertue being\n\ndescription Page 75\n\nFermental, begets in the common Mer∣cury an Off-spring more Noble than it self, which is our true Hermaphrodite, which will congeal it self, and dissolve the Bodies, &c.\n\nOf this Coelestial Vertue he also speaks thus.\n\nBut beyond the Example or Simili∣tude given of a Grain of Corn, it may be observed that the hidden and spiri∣tual Vertue of this our Body, doth purge and putrefie its Matrix of Water, in which it is sown; that is, it makes it cast forth a great quantity of filthy Earth, and a great deal of hydropical saline Moisture, &c.\n\nFor (says he) this Operation of ours, is made between Male and Female, with∣in their own kind; between which there is a Ferment, which affecteth that which no other thing in the World could do.\n\nFor fermental Vertue is the wonder of the World; and it is by it that Water becomes Herbs, &c.\n\nThen, Sir, you close all in these words; viz.\n\nWe conclude then, That all Opera∣tions for our Mercury and our Body, according to our Art, are erroneous,\n\ndescription Page 76\n\nand will never produce our Mystery, although they be otherwise Mercuries never so wonderfully made, &c.\n\nAeyren.\n\nWhat Conjunction do you call this?\n\nHort.\n\nI call this Conjunction Te∣traptive; yet I perceive that at the first Addition it rather goes under the De∣nomination of Triptative, or Conjun∣ction of three Substances, by virtue of a Medium, because the Medium re∣mains not intirely with the other, and that the Terrap••ive Conjunction is not properly consummate till perfect Dige∣stion: This therefore may be properly called the making of a Quadrangle; and that of perfect Digestion, a redu∣cing the Quadrangle to a Circle; as you have it in the Exposition upon Sir G. Ripley's fourth Gate, pag: 292. (tho') I also perceive you allude to the same Conjunctions, and other Operations in the great Work.\n\nYou also, Sir, further teach that by virtue of the Medium or Doves of Di∣ana, all these four Principles, or Ele∣ments will joyn and purge together, which then must be purified into a bright, clear Water, by several Subli∣mations or Eagles, which may be done\n\ndescription Page 77\n\nseveral ways, as your Writings suffici∣ently direct: Also that these several Sublimations are but so many Cohoba∣tions of the subliming Mercury upon the Body of the Composition; yet that there requires a due knowledge of the true Number which may also be clear∣ly learnt from your Directions; and therefore, for brevities sake, I shall not hear repeat them.\n\nThis is that hidden Moisture or Hu∣midity, wherein Gold will dissolve as Ice doth melt in warm Water, and is a Mother unto Gold, as saith Sendivog. Eng. pag. 49.\n\nI am also, in the next place, further to shew that this purified Mercury or Water, is not unlike to common Mercury; yet more splendid and clear, but not diaphanous or limped, as many have supposed: And that upon this pre∣pared Mercury alone is founded the grand Secret of the Philosophers Stone; alias Gold-making Powder; alias trans∣muting Elixir; which with your leave I will prove, as follows.\n\nFirst that it is not diaphanous or lim∣pid. Tract de Metal. Metamor. pag. 46. Quidam Diaphanum hoc n••enstruum volunt limpidumque, &c. et frustra.\n\ndescription Page 78\n\nRipley Revived, pag. 238. The main matter is our Water; which Wa¦ter, as saith Artephius, is the Vinegar of the Mountains, and it is the only Instrument for our Work.\n\nThis, I say, that it must first be Co∣hobated in a very wonderful way (for it is such a Cohobation, that hath not its like in the World) and for several times, to a determinate Number; and after it may and ought to be Distilled per se, with out addition again and again, that thou mayst have the Water clear from any exotical Mixture.\n\nPag. 34. Because some Atoms of the Body may be in it, which were insensibly left in the Preparation.\n\nPag. 241. For this, saith the Philo∣sopher, is thy first Work, to make clean thy Mercury, and then into clean Mer∣cury to put clean Bodies; for who can expect a pure Generation from that which is uncle an.\n\nThe next Property of thy VVater, is that it must be thin, even as thin as any other Mercury; for if the external Proportion be Corrupted, it is an evi∣dent Sign that the inward Nature is Confused.\n\ndescription Page 79\n\nIt must also be of a very bright Co¦lour, even like to fine burnished Silver, as saith Artephius. Hence, saith a cer∣tain Philosopher, To sight it is like to a Coelestial Body.\n\nOur VVater must not be reduced into any limpid diaphanous Liquor, as some fondly imagine, and as I my self in my time of Errors did conceit; but it must keep its Mercurial from pure and incor∣rupted. It is also very ponderous; so ponderous that it is somewhat more weighty than any other Mercury in the VVorld.\n\nBy way of Digression, give me leave to tell you, It is no small matter to be firmly grounded in your Principles. I have met with a Book published by Dr. Bolnest, 1665. who contends much for this common Mercury prepared, pag. 104, 105, &c. and thinks himself no small Master therein. But pag. 104. he thinks that mentioned by Count Trevi∣san was only a particular, and that the said Doctor drives at another Method, though to the same purpose. I have (says he) already declared (my Thoughts) that the common Mercu∣ry prepared, and afterwards dissolved into a clear, milky, crystalline, and\n\ndescription Page 80\n\nsilvery Liquor, or VVater, is the true Menstrual, or Metalline dissolving Mer∣cury of Philosophers. And pag. 116. he adds, that we may undoubtedly con∣clude, that that most famous and ne∣cessary Menstrual, or Metalline dissol∣ving Mercury of Philosophers (for, says he, I mean not their congealing Mer∣cury) is to be prepared out of the com∣mon Mercury or Quicksilver. And in pag. 122. he says, R. Lully directs to another more excellent and philosophi∣cal Menstruum, &c. without which the common or vulgar is not easily to be prepared, and made philosophick. But soon afterwards he runs into the old Error, that there are several Mercuries, (besides the universal) as Mineral Ve∣getable and Animal Mercury, sometimes both joyned in one; I mean (says he) the Mineral and Vegetable which pro∣duced that potent Dissolvent, or G. Ve∣getable of Raymund Lully, which few yet have well understood or percei∣ved, &c. But of these last Mercuries (says he) or Menstruums, I intend not at present to inlarge, they being the Gate into the greatest of Chymical Se∣crets: And at this Fountain he leaves the ingenous to draw, and refresh him∣self\n\ndescription Page 81\n\nwith the healing and physical Wa∣ters, &c. Now I should think this Doctor an envious Adeptist, but that he afterwards requests us not to interpret him to speak of the Great Elixir. And pag. 126. he would not have any to imagine him to know more than he hath delivered; and so attempt in vain (by subtilty of Discourse) a farther dis∣covery from him: And concludes thus, Let none therefore expect that from me, that I own not my self Master of; he that doth, and fails of his Expectati∣ons, let him not hereafter blame me, but himself, &c. Thus our Expectation ends in a hush, and comes to nothing; and thus we see how a Building may soon fall for want of a true Foundati∣on, and how greatly many have been deluded by that Subject of common Mercury; sometimes wholly appro∣ving, other times altogether rejecting the same, and sometimes allowing it only in part.\n\nI have seen a little Book, called Chy∣mical, Medecinal and Chyrurgical Ad∣dresses made to Samuel Hartlib, Esq 1655. And in it a Treatise, named. A Caveat for Alchymists, the Table of the Book says, it is Gabriel Platt's Caveat.\n\ndescription Page 82\n\nThis Man sets out some of the Cheats of sophistical Multipliers and Impo∣sters. And in his first Chap. tells us, that he was shortly to demonstrate be∣fore the High and Honourable Court of Parliament in England, that there is such a thing seasible as the Philosophers Stone; or to speak more properly, an Art in the Transmutation of Metals, &c. But in the Discovery of the fourth Cheat, he makes a Condition; if (says he) I may have a Laboratory, like to that in the City of Venice, where they are sure of Secrecy, and to be pro∣vided for, &c. And towards the Con∣clusion he cries out, What should I say more? Oh, if any Man either in Eng∣land, or beyond the Seas, shall trouble himself to write to me, he shall be sure to have an Answer; if he come to me, he shall be sure to lose his Labour; if he think to win me by Rewards, tho never so Great, he shall be sure to get nothing but a Jeer, &c. And professes that he had not only found out the Phi∣losophers Stone, but also a true and in∣fallible way to make England Happy by it. This Man, I say, for all his great Boasting, and some true philosophical Caveats, is mistaken in common Mer∣cury;\n\ndescription Page 83\n\nfor although he allows, that without it, this Art could never have been found: He notwithstanding adds, Not that it can be made the philoso∣phical Dissolvent by any preparation whatsoever, but without it the first Dissolvent; (for there are three) can∣not be gotten; for it only hath the Power to separate this mineral Spirit from a crude Mineral, taken from the Mine, which the Fire hath not touched; and no other thing under Heaven can do it else, no more than any Creature besides a Bee can extract Hony out of a Flower.—By this, I easily perceive, he spoke only by ghuess; and I am affraid England is not one bit the Happier for all his great Cunning.\n\nBut to return to Aeyrenaeus his Mer∣cury, of which he further tells us, that this is the only Mercury; and there is none in the whole World besides it which can do our Work: With this (says he) Hermes did moisten his Bo∣dy, and made it to rot and putrefie.\n\nBy means of this Water the Body shall be brought to have a vegetative Soul; for it will shoot forth as with Sprigs, and Leaves, and Branches, and after it will resolve into Powder like Atoms, &c.\n\ndescription Page 84\n\nAnd pag. 240. That it is the Mother of Metals, and therefore hath Power to reduce them, by dividing their Princi∣ples of Sulphur and Mercury, he further adds; but we count it a loss to imploy our Mercury to such sordid Uses, for we spoil the goodness of it thereby; Gold only is drown'd in it, &c.\n\n242. This Water is by the Philoso∣phers called their Venom, and indeed it is a very strong Poyson; to wit, to the Body of Sol, to which it is mixed: But what it is to the Body of Man, I never tried my self, nor gave it to any other, nor do I believe did any of they. But as concerning the Medicine that is made by it, and out of it, it is certain that of all Medicines in the World, it is the highest; for it is the true Arbor Vitae, which doth Answer the universal De∣sires of them who have it in this kind; for besides it's Vertue Curative, which it hath in a wonderful miraculous way, it can penetrate even to our constitutive Principles, which no other mineral Me∣dicine can do, &c. [Of which more hereafter.]\n\nI observed before, That this Water is the only Base of the Grand Arcanum of\n\ndescription Page 85\n\nthe Philosophers, because out of it, by digestion, they obtain a Sulphur or Gold, far more Excellent than any common Gold for their great Work.\n\nIn Sendivog. Engl: pag. 144. Con∣cerning Sulphur, I find these Words; viz. For the House of Gold is Mercury, and the House of Mercury is Water; but Sulphur is that which coagulates Mercury, which Sulphur indeed is most difficultly prepared, but more difficult∣ly found out: For in the Sulphur of the Philosophers this Secret consists, which also is contained in the inward Rooms of Mercury; of whose Preparation, with∣out which it is improfitable, we shall Discourse hereafter in the third Princi∣ple of Salt; seeing here we treat of the Vertue and Original, not Praxis of Sulphur, &c.\n\n☞ I know not what to Answer for this Passage; the Translator says he hath done it faithfully from the Latin into the English-Tongue; but I find nothing to this purpose in the Latin, Printed Genevae. MDC XXXVIII.\n\nHowever, in pag. 161. I find these words, Considerando quod, &c. By con∣sidering that the Mercury of the Philo∣sophers\n\ndescription Page 86\n\nhath in it self its own good Sulphur more or less depurated, and de∣cocted by Nature, thou mayst perfect all things out of Mercury; but if thou shalt know to add thy Weights to the Weights of Nature, to double Mercury and triple Sulphur, it will quickly be terminated in good, than in better, un∣til into best of all, &c.\n\n163. Common Mercury by how much the more it is decocted, the more fluxible it is; Our Argent Vive by how much more it is decocted, the more it is thickned; by these Circumstances therefore thou maist consider how the common Mercury differs from the Mercury of the Philosophers. If thou dost not yet understand, do not ex∣pect it; no mortal Man will give you clearer things than we have here spo∣ken of. But now of the Vertues of it: Our Argent Vive is of such Ver∣tue, that it is of its self sufficient for thee, and for it self, without any addi∣tion of any extraneous thing; it is dis∣solved and congealed by a natural De∣coction only; but Philosophers, for brevities sake, add to it its own Sulphur well digested and ripened, and so they work, &c.\n\ndescription Page 87\n\n☞ But not to build upon the Au∣thority of one Philosopher. In Theat. Chem. Britt. 380. I read thus:\n\nIn four Elements is comprehended things three, Animalls, Vegetabills, Mineralls must be, Of this our Principle that we make our Stone; Quality and quantity is unknown to many one, &c. Out of one Principle four Elements thou shalt draw, Thou shalt need nothing else that need∣ful is; Our Principle in quality is so perfectly mixed, By Vertue of the Son and his quality, So equally joyned, so throughly fixed, As nothing so well mixed may be.\n\nSon. Father, I pray you for Charity, Where shall I this Sulphur finde, &c.\n\nFather. In our own Water Son; keep this in minde, &c.\n\nBut to come nearer home to Aeyre∣naeus; in his Introitus, in the Chapter of the Invention of the perfect Magi∣stery,\n\ndescription Page 88\n\nhe tells us after the joyning of the Elements; That thus came out an Hermaphroditical Mercury; him there∣fore they put in the Fire, and they coa∣gulated him for no long time; and in his Coagulation they found Sol and Luna, &c.\n\nChap. 10. Pag. 16. Prae cunclis, &c. This above all things is a Wonder, that in our Mercury there is not only an actual, but also an active Sulphur; and yet notwithstanding it retains all the Proportions and Form of Mercury, &c. By reason of this Sulphur it is an Her∣maphrodite, because it doth apparently include at the same time, and by the same degree of Digestion, as well an active as a passive Principle; for if it be joyn'd with Sol, it softens, melts and dissolves him by a temperate heat, suit∣able to the necessity of the Compositi∣on; and doth by the same Fire coagu∣late himself, and gives in his Coagulati∣on Sol, and that according to the plea∣sure of the Operator.\n\nThis, perhaps, will seem incredible unto thee, but its true; to wit, That homogeneal Mercury., pure and clean, being by our artifice Impregnated with an internal Sulphur, doth by the appli∣cation\n\ndescription Page 89\n\nof a convenient heat only coa∣gulate himself, &c. but if it be joyn'd to Sol already perfect, it is not so coagu∣lated, but it dissolves the corporal Gold, &c.\n\nPag. 45. Scias, &c. Thou shalt know that our Mercury does of it self yield Gold, &c.\n\nRip. Rev. Exposit. upon Sir G. R. Pre∣face, pag. 37. And as the Artist may govern this Mercury, it will digest the passive Principles either into Sol or Lu∣na, at the Philosopher's Pleasure.\n\nThis is the Stone of which we meane, Whoso our Writings conceiveth aright, It is a Soul and Substance bright, &c.\n\nAnd verily he that hath well studied our Books, shall understand that this general one, Mercury, which we call Azoth, is indeed our Stone which wan∣teth only digestion, &c. [but this I know is also otherwise Expounded].\n\nPag. 41. Our one Image out of which springs White and Red, not bare Sol and Luna, as will spring out of our Mercury, which we prepare with our Hands; but, & c,\n\ndescription Page 90\n\n41, 42. For who could belive that Sol, in which the Vertue is but Unary, I mean only sufficient for it self, should by the addition of our Mercury (which in reference to its material Parts) is be∣low the Degree of Sol, and needs Di∣gestion, and that only to mature it to the height of Sol, &c.\n\nIntroit. Apert. Cap. 19. Pag. 54. Sul∣phur nostrum, &c. Seek then our Sul∣phur withal thy might; which, believe me, thou mayst find in our Mercury, if Fates the call, otherwise thou shalt prepare it out of Sol Vulgar, &c.\n\nThis is sufficient for our Point.\n\n☞ Next we will proceed to the Great Work of the Philosophers, which also hath its Foundation upon Sulphur and Mercury, and alludes to all the Conjun∣ctions, as afore-mentioned; wherein it will plainly appear that the whole Art is far more excellent, and easier to be obtained from this prepared Mercury and the Sulphur, or Gold proceeding from it, than from such Mercury and common Gold. And that herein lies the Grand Secret of the Philosophers.\n\ndescription Page 91\n\nOf the Great Work.\n\nSendivog. Lat. pag. 161. Engl. 117. Now we say that this Art is nothing else but the Virtues of the Elements equally mix'd, it is a natural Equality of Hot, Dry, Cold, Moist; a joyning together of Male and Female, which the same Fe∣male begot, i. e. a Conjunction of Fire and the Radical moisttue of Metals, &c.\n\n119. But Philosophers for brevities sake add to it its own Sulphur, and so they work.\n\n122. We say that Argent vive is the first matter of that Work, and truly nothing else; whatsoever is added to it ariseth from it, &c.\n\nPag. 136. Speaking of Sulphur: But do not thou despair in finding of him out, I tell the of a truth that he is in Gold and Silver most perfect, but in Argent vive most easy.\n\nAnd in pag. 140. Now we grant that unto the unworthy this Art is nothing, but to the lovers of Vertue, and the true Searchers and Sons of Wisdom, we do most highly commend it, and do affirm it not only to be true, but\n\ndescription Page 92\n\naltogether the truest; which some∣times we have really made good before men worthy of such sight, I say before Men of high and low Condition: Yet this Medicine was not made by us, but received from a Freind and yet most true, for the finding out of which we have sufficiently instructed the Sear∣chers thereof, &c.\n\nBut to return to Aeyrenaeus, (second to none in explaining this Art) Introit. Chap. 18. pag. 45. Sol proinde noster, &c. Our Gold therefore is commonly vend∣able, but not commonly to be bought, because that it may become ours, there is need of our Art.\n\nPag. 46. Thou maist find our Gold; in Gold or Silver vulgar, I my self have sought it in these, and have found it, but it is no easie Labour. The Stone it¦self may be Easier made, than than that thou mayst find the next matter in Gold commonly bought.\n\nWherefore our Gold is the next mat∣ter of our Stone, the common Gold is a near matter, the rest of the Metlas are remote, and those things which are not Metallick are most remote, or ra∣ther estrang'd to it.\n\ndescription Page 93\n\nBut if thou seek our Gold in a mid∣dle matter between the perfect and im∣perfect, seek it, and thou maist find it; but otherwise loose the Body of com∣mon Gold, which is called the first pre∣paration, by which the Inchantment off the body is loosed, without which the work of the Male cannot be perform'd: If thou goest in the former way, thou art bound to proceed with a most benign Fire; but if in the latter, then thou must implore the help of a torrid Vulcan; such a Fire ought to be Ad∣ministred as we use in Multiplicati∣on, when to perfect our Elixir, we Ferment with common Gold or Silver.\n\nThis indeed will be a Labyrinth, unless thou knowest how to get thy self out, yet in either progress, thou art in need of an equal and continu∣al Heat, whether thou workest in Common Sol or in ours. And thou shalt know, that our Sol will perfect the Work two or three Months soo∣ner than Common Gold, and it will be an Elixir in its first perfection, of a Thousand Fold, which in the o∣ther will scarce be of a Hundred Fold Vertue, &c.\n\ndescription Page 94\n\nChap. 19. pag. 51. Est tamen unum, &c. Yet there is in the Metallick Kingdom one thing, of a Wonderful Original, in which our Sol is nearer than in Common Sol and Luna if thou seek it in the hour of its Nativity, which melts in our Mercury as Ice in warm Water, and yet, after a sort, it is like Gold: Thou shalt not find this im∣mediately in common Sol, but from it with our Mercury in governing it, by 150. days thou mayst find this true, and the same matter, which is our Gold sought the furthest way about, nor yet of such vertue, as that which Nature have left to our hands, &c.\n\nNote, The ingenious Author former∣ly mentioned, however he came short of the Doves of Diana, is notwithstand∣ing most Excellent in his Exposition upon this Sentence, Est tamen unum, &c. which is well worth to be here inserted. Disceptatio de Lapide Physico. Cap. 1. pag. 9. Est tamen unum in reguo Metallico originis mirae.\n\nId est Nucleus Mercurij Metallicus albissimus & purissimus, qui propter ra∣ritatem artis, tam eum specuativè in∣veniendi,\n\ndescription Page 95\n\nquam practice educendi mira∣bilem methodum, à Philaletha Originis mirae appellatur.\n\nIn quo Sol noster propinquius est, quam in sole & Luna Vulgi.\n\nIn quo scilicet Nucleo, ut non plus ultra defaecatissimo, Sol noster, id est aurum vium Philosophorum, seu Sulfur artis, propinquius est, quam in sole & Luna Vulgi: Id est facilius per decoctionem ex illo extrahitur, quam ex auro Vulgi, tam propter puritatem, quia auro & ar∣gento purior hic nucleus, illud homogenei∣tate antecellit: Nam licet aurum quoad perfectionem Metallicum sit sat purum, & perfectè homogeneum, tamen quoad perfectionem Medicinalem non ita est; Secundum omnium sophorum authoritates, quas hic annectare supersedeo propter bre∣vitatem, citius enim per se, quam auro ad∣huc clauso junctum, in solem nostrum, id¦est Philosophorum decoquitur.\n\nSieum in hora Suae Nativitatis quaeras.\n\nSi eum, id est antedictum solem no∣strum, in hora suae Nativitatis: quando scilicet ex illo uno in regno Metallico originis mirae, id est Mercurio homogeneo,\n\ndescription Page 96\n\nper competentem ignis decoctionem natus, educitur: quaeras, id est accipies,\n\nQui in Mercurio nostro liquescit.\n\nQui, scilicet Sol noster ex Mercurio natus, in Mercurio nostro nempè unde na∣tus, iterum impositus, liquescit, id est resolvitur.\n\nSicut glacies in aqua tepida.\n\nQuem admodum glacies nil nisi mera aqua concreta est, ideò etiam in pura aqua tepida, absque rejectione ullius superflui∣tatis inseperabiliter resolvitur: pari modo & ille Sol, sicut glacies, ex Mer∣curio sophico tanquam aqua sui generis, solo igne concretus, & in hora suae Na∣tivitatis, id est coagulationis, acceptus, eodem Mercurio reimpositus, suaviter resolvitur, tanquam in aqua tepida, id¦est, leni calore ad hibito.\n\nPag. 11. Ergo illud unum, &c.\n\nSo far this Ingenious Gentleman: Now to return again to our Country∣man and Master Aeyrenaeus, concerning the several ways of Working, in Chap. 19. pag. 48. of his Introitus.\n\ndescription Page 97\n\nParato Mercurio nostro, &c. Having prepared our Mercury and Sol, shut them in our Vessel, and govern them with our Fire, and within Forty days, thou shalt see the whole matter turn'd into a Shadow or Atomes, without any visible mover or motion, or without any heat perceptable to the touch, save only that it is hot.\n\nBut if ye be yet ignorant both of our Sun and Mercury, meddle not in this work, for Expence only will be thy Lot.\n\nBut if thou does not yet fully know the Mystery of our Sun, having attain'd the knowledge of our Mercury; then take of common Sol, well purged, one part, and of our Mercury, very clear, three parts, joyn them as is said before, and set them to the Fire, giving a heat in which it may boil and sweat, and his sweat may be circulated, and this Day and Night for ninety Days and Nights, and thou shalt see this Mercu∣ry to have separated and again con∣joyn'd all the Elements of the common Sol; boil it afterwards for other fifty Days, and thou shalt see the common Sol to be converted by our Mercury in∣to our Sol, which is a Medicine of the\n\ndescription Page 98\n\nfirst Order.
