        "text": "While literary Science-Fiction related to Space continues its decline in sales performance if not in terms of quality and popularity, astronomy and cosmology are slowly spreading in mainstream fiction in this beginning of the XXI century. In fact historical recreations and fictional biographies of astronomers of the past increase in numbers, ever more astrophysicists become writers and at the same time cosmic and heavenly metaphors invade novels and short stories in a long time sought for process of assimilation of scientific culture. In this brief critical review I will illustrate this trend for the last fifteen years, especially in the anglo-american market, yet above all I will discuss the increasing relevance of storytelling in and for the scientific discourse both from the perspective of literary theory (as aptly suggested by Hallyn, 1987) and from the point of view of science communication (as recently attempted by Trench, 2015). Finally, I will propose a couple of case-studies in the field of \"celestial narrative\": the first concerns one of the most relevant themes in the last years, the Multiverse, while the second concentrates on a structure that I call the \"astronomy of affections\", that is the systematic use of science as a metaphor for feelings, emotions and relationships. In common perception fiction and science seem worlds completely apart: the former appears as the embodiment of subjectivity and ideology, the latter as the maximum effort in eradicating both elements from discourse, if mathematics is not sufficient to sterilize it. Actually the situation is more nuanced and complex: Narration and Science are both human endeavors charged of ideology and subjectivity, but Science hides this \"original sin\" since the age of Enlightenment and Positivism. On the contrary, storytelling, together with metaphors and other tropes, are a central element in Science as well as in the Humanities and many scholars are recently rediscovering such a truth bringing rethoric and the art of narrating to the attention of the scientific academic world.\n\nOver the years, Science Fiction has offered me ways of understanding literary genres, as well as ways of thinking about the world. These understandings inform the courses on language, literature and identity that I have taught here and elsewhere. The first part of the presentation is an extended analogy: it develops an account of the genre of Science Fiction through an autobiographical telling of exploring the city of Hyderabad. The second part of this presentation touches upon some of the “thought-tools” that Science Fiction makes available to us. We argue that the imagined worlds of Science Fiction not only paint for us a variety of futures, but perhaps even more importantly, help us to reflect upon, and act in, the complex times we live in.\n\nScience and its predecessor, alchemy, have been topics of fiction in the West for over five centuries but until late last century novelists, with few exceptions, condemned science and scientists on social and moral grounds. However, since the 1990s, science has acquired a more benign and humane image, associated with combatting deadly viruses, saving endangered species and communicating the urgency of dealing with climate change. Novelists, too, are increasingly intent on authenticity in presenting scientific research and the motives and moral dilemmas of scientists. Such science novels risk being overloaded with scientific facts and explanations, so the craft of the writer involves integrating the necessary scientific information without damaging the artistic integrity of the work. This paper explores, through interviews with authors and in-depth reading of texts, how the following writers accommodated the science component within the life-world of their narrative and took steps to...\n\nAlthough scholars and literary aficionados extensively debate its history and exact origins, works of science fiction have long been characterized as possessing some element of scientific fact. In fact, the easiest, albeit most simplistic, way to understand what SF is as a genre as well as how we might distinguish it from others of close proximity, would be to start with a quasi-etymological breakdown of the term. In 1834, for example, Cambridge University historian and philosopher of science, William Whewel, coined the word “scientist” as an attempt to replace expressions such as “cultivators of science.” The word “fiction,” on the other hand, had been in use since the early 15th century. Derived from Old French and Latin, the term took on various literal and figurative connotations pertaining to all things made-up, dissimulated, and fabricated either by the “hand” or “mind,” eventually finding its footing in literature as “prose” of the imagination."
