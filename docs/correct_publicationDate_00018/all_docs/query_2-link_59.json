        "text": "Poul Anderson (born November 25, 1926, Bristol, Pennsylvania, U.S.—died July 31, 2001, Orinda, California) was a prolific American writer of science fiction and fantasy, often praised for his scrupulous attention to scientific detail.\n\nAnderson published his first science-fiction story while an undergraduate at the University of Minnesota and became a freelance writer following his graduation with a degree in physics in 1948. He published his first novel, Vault of the Ages, in 1952 and thereafter produced several books per year. A number of his works concern the “future history” of what he calls the Technic Civilization, an age of human history lasting from the years 2100 to 7100. Much of the sociological, political, and economic content of these books, such as Agent of the Terran Empire (1965), derives from patterns associated with the European Age of Exploration. In Tau Zero (1970), considered by some to be his best work, Anderson turned from the broad canvas of future history to the confines of a spaceship, the speed of which is approaching the speed of light. Inside, the travelers experience time as they have always known it while witnessing through the portholes the collapse and rebirth of the universe. Other notable books include A Midsummer Tempest (1974), The Boat of a Million Years (1989), and Genesis (2000), which received the John W. Campbell Award in 2001.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nAmerican Writers Quiz\n\nJust as Anderson’s scientific training lends weight and persuasiveness to his science fiction, his interest in Scandinavian languages and literature informs many of his fantasy novels. The Merman’s Children (1979), for example, portrays the plight of a surviving species of mermen within human society, a theme found in medieval Danish balladry."
