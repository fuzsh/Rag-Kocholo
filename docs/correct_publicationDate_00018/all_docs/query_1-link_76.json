In fear of a prophecy that he would in turn be overthrown by his own son, Kronos swallowed each of his children as they were born. Rhea managed to save the youngest, Zeus, by hiding him away on the island of Krete (Crete), and fed Kronos a stone wrapped in swaddling clothes. The god grew up, forced Kronos to disgorge his swallowed offspring, and led the Olympians in a ten year war against the Titanes (Titans), driving them in defeat into the pit of Tartaros (Tartarus).\n\nMany human generations later, Zeus released Kronos and his brothers from their prison, and made the old Titan king of the Elysian Islands, home of the blessed dead.\n\nKronos was essentially the same as Khronos (Chronos), the primordial god of time in the Orphic Theogonies.\n\nFAMILY OF CRONUS\n\nPARENTS\n\n[1.1] OURANOS & GAIA (Hesiod Theogony 116, Aeschylus Prometheus 200, Simonides Frag 511, Apollodorus 1.1, Diodorus Siculus 5.65.1, Cicero De Natura Deorum 3.17)\n\n[1.2] AITHER (or OURANOS) & GAIA (Hyginus Preface)\n\nOFFSPRING\n\n[1.1] HESTIA, DEMETER, HERA, HAIDES, POSEIDON, ZEUS (by Rhea) (Homer Iliad 15.187, Hesiod Theogony 453, Apollodorus 1.4, Diodorus Siculus 5.68.1, et al)\n\n[2.1] KHEIRON (by Philyre) (Eumelus Titanomachia Frag 6, Apollodorus 1.8, Apollonius Rhodius 2.1231, Hyginus Fabulae 13, Ovid Metamorphoses 6.126 & 7.352, Virgil Georgics 3.92 & 3.549, Pliny Natural History 7.197)\n\n[2.2] APHROS (by Philyre) (Suidas s.v.

He was married to Rhea, by whom he became the father of Hestia, Demeter, Hera, Hades, Poseidon, and Zeus. Cheiron is also called a son of Cronus. (Hesiod. Theog. 137, 452, &c.; Apollod. i. 1. § 3, &c.) At the instigation of his mother, Cronus unmanned his father for having thrown the Cyclopes, who were likewise his children by Ge, into Tartarus. Out of the blood thus shed sprang up the Erinnyes. When the Cyclopes were delivered from Tartarus, the government of the world was taken from Uranus and given to Cronus, who in his turn lost it through Zeus, as was predicted to him by Ge and Uranus. [Zeus.] The Romans identified their Saturnus with the Cronus of the Greeks.\n\nSource: Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology.\n\nCLASSICAL LITERATURE QUOTES\n\nPARENTAGE OF CRONUS\n\nHesiod, Theogony 126 ff (trans.

The Titanes numbered six men and five women, being born, as certain writers of myths relate, of Ouranos (Uranus, Sky) and Ge (Earth), but according to others, of one of the Kouretes (Curetes) and Titaia, from whom as their mother they derive the name they have. The males were Kronos (Cronus), Hyperion, Koios (Coeus), Iapetos (Iapetus), Krios (Crius) and Okeanos (Oceanus) . . .

Evelyn-White) (Greek epic C8th or C7th B.C.) :\n\n\"She [Gaia (Gaea), Earth] lay with Ouranos (Uranus, Sky) and bare deep-swirling Okeanos (Oceanus), Koios (Coeus) and Krios (Crius) and Hyperion and Iapetos, Theia and Rheia, Themis and Mnemosyne and gold-crowned Phoibe (Phoebe) and lovely Tethys. After them was born Kronos (Cronus) the wily, youngest and most terrible of her children, and he hated his lusty sire. And again, she bare the Kyklopes (Cyclopes), overbearing in spirit, Brontes, and Steropes and stubborn-hearted Arges.\n\nAnd again, three other sons [the Hekatonkheires (Hecatoncheires)] were born of Gaia and Ouranos, great and doughty beyond telling, Kottos (Cottus) and Briareos (Briareus) and Gyes. From their shoulders sprang a hundred arms, not to be approached, and each had fifty heads upon his shoulders on their strong limbs, and irresistible was the stubborn strength that was in their great forms. For of all the children that were born of Gaia and Ouranos, these were the most terrible, and they were hated by their own father from the first. And he used to hide them all away in a secret place of Gaia so soon as each was born, and would not suffer them to come up into the light: and Ouranos rejoiced in his evil doing.And he [Ouranos] used to hide them all [the Hekatonkheires] away in a secret place of Gaia (Earth) so soon as each was born, and would not suffer them to come up into the light : and Ouranos (Sky) rejoiced in his evil doing. But vast Gaia (Earth) groaned within, being straitened, and she made the element of grey flint and shaped a great sickle, and told her plan to her dear sons. And she spoke, cheering them, while she was vexed in her dear heart : ‘My children, gotten of a sinful father, if you will obey me, we should punish the vile outrage of your father; for he first thought of doing shameful things.’\n\nSo she said; but fear seized them all, and none of them uttered a word. But great Kronos (Cronus) the wily took courage and answered his dear mother : ‘Mother, I will undertake to do this deed, for I reverence not our father of evil name, for he first thought of doing shameful things.’\n\nSo he said : and vast Gaia (Earth) rejoiced greatly in spirit, and set and hid him in an ambush, and put in his hands a jagged sickle, and revealed to him the whole plot.\n\nAnd Ouranos (Sky) came, bringing on night and longing for love, and he lay about Gaia (Earth) spreading himself full upon her. Then the son from his ambush stretched forth his left hand and in his right took the great long sickle with jagged teeth, and swiftly lopped off his own father's members and cast them away to fall behind him. And not vainly did they fall from his hand; for all the bloody drops that gushed forth Gaia (Earth) received, and as the seasons moved round she bare the strong Erinyes and the great Gigantes (Giants) [perhaps the Kouretes (Curetes)] with gleaming armour, holding long spears in their hands and the Nymphai (Nymphs) whom they call Meliai (Meliae) all over the boundless earth. And so soon as he had cut off the members with flint and cast them from the land into the surging sea, they were swept away over the main a long time: and a white foam spread around them from the immortal flesh, and in it there grew a maiden [Aphrodite] . . .\n\nBut these sons whom be begot himself great Ouranos (Sky) used to call Titanes (Titans, Strainers) in reproach, for he said that they strained and did presumptuously a fearful deed, and that vengeance for it would come afterwards.\"\n\nHesiod, Theogony 20 ff :\n\n\"Kronos (Cronus) the crafty counsellor.\"\n\nPlato, Euthyphro 5e (trans. Fowler) (Greek philosopher C4th B.C.) :\n\n\"Men believe that Zeus . . . put his father [Kronos (Cronus)] in bonds because he wickedly devoured his children, and he in turn had mutilated his father [Ouranos (Uranus)] for similar reasons.\"\n\nPlato, Republic 377e (trans. Shorey) :\n\n\"‘There is, first of all,’ I said, ‘the greatest lie about the things of greatest concernment, which was no pretty invention of him [Hesiod] who told how Ouranos (Uranus) did what Hesiod says he did to Kronos (Cronus), and how Kronos in turn took his revenge; and then there are the doings and sufferings of Kronos at the hands of his son [Zeus]. Even if they were true I should not think that they ought to be thus lightly told to thoughtless young persons.’\"\n\nPseudo-Apollodorus, Bibliotheca 1. 3 (trans. Aldrich) (Greek mythographer C2nd A.D.) :\n\n\"Ouranos (Uranus, Sky) was the first to rule over the entire world. He married Ge (Earth) and sired first the Hekatonkheires (Hecatoncheires), who were names Briareos (Briareus), Gyes and Kottos (Cottus). They were unsurpassed in both size and power, and each had a hundred hands and fifty heads. After these he sired the Kyklopes (Cyclopes), by name Arges, Steropes, and Brontes, each of whom had one eye in his forehead. But Ouranos (Sky) bound these and threw them into Tartaros (Tartarus) (a place in Haides' realm as dark as Erebos (Erebus), and as far away from the earth as the earth is from the sky), and fathered other sons on Ge, namely the Titanes (Titans) : Okeanos (Oceanus), Koios (Coeus), Hyperion, Kreios (Crius), Iapetos (Iapetus), and Kronos (Cronus) the youngest; also daughters called Titanides : Tethys, Rhea, Themis, Mnemosyne, Phoibe (Phoebe), Dione, Theia.\n\nNow Ge (Earth), distressed by the loss of her children into Tartaros, persuaded the Titanes to attack their father, and she gave Kronos a sickle made of adamant. So all of them except Okeanos set upon Ouranos (Sky), and Kronos cut off his genitals, tossing them into the sea. (From the drops of the flowing blood Erinyes were born, named Alekto (Alecto), Tisiphone, Megaira (Megaera).) Thus having overthrown Ouranos' (Sky's) rule the Titanes retrieved their brothers from Tartaros and gave the power to Kronos.\"\n\nApollonius Rhodius, Argonautica 4. 982 ff (trans. Rieu) (Greek epic C3rd B.C.) :\n\n\"In the Keraunian (Ceraunian) Sea, fronting the Ionian Straits, there is a rich and spacious island, under the soil of which is said to lie (bear with me, Mousai (Muses); it gives me little pleasure to recall the old tale) the sickle used by Kronos (Cronus) to castrate his father Ouranos (Uranus, Sky) . . .

This subject was handled by Zeno and was later explained more fully by Cleanthes and Chrysippus. For example, an ancient belief prevailed throughout Greece that Caelus [Ouranos (Uranus), Sky] was mutilated by his son Saturnus [Kronos (Cronus)] . . . Their meaning was that the highest element of celestial ether or fire [Ouranos], which by itself generates all things, is devoid of that bodily part which required union with another for the work of procreation.\"\n\nNonnus, Dionysiaca 7. 222 ff (trans.

Evelyn-White) (Greek epic C8th or C7th B.C.) :\n\n\"But Rhea was subject in love to Kronos (Cronus) and bare splendid children, Hestia, Demeter, and gold-shod Hera and strong Haides . . . and the loud-crashing Earth-Shaker [Poseidon], and wise Zeus . . . These great Kronos swallowed as each came forth from the womb to his mother's knees with this intent, that no other of the proud sons of Ouranos (Uranus, Heaven) should hold the kingly office amongst the deathless gods. For he learned from Gaia (Gaea, Earth) and starry Ouranos (Sky) that he was destined to be overcome by his own son, strong though he was, through the contriving of great Zeus.Therefore he kept no blind outlook, but watched and swallowed down his children : and unceasing grief seized Rhea. But when she was about to bear Zeus, the father of gods and men, then she besought her own dear parents, Gaia (Earth) and starry Ouranos (Sky), to devise some plan with her that the birth of her dear child might be concealed, and that retribution might overtake great, crafty Kronos for his own father and also for the children whom he had swallowed down. And they readily heard and obeyed their dear daughter, and told her all that was destined to happen touching Kronos the king and his stout-hearted son. So they sent her to Lyetos (Lyetus), to the rich land of Krete (Crete), when she was ready to bear great Zeus, the youngest of her children. Him did vast Gaia (Earth) receive from Rhea in wide Krete to nourish and to bring up. Thither came Gaia carrying him swiftly through the black night to Lyktos (Lyctus) first, and took him in her arms and hid him in a remote cave beneath the secret places of the holy earth on thick-wooded Mount Aigeion (Aegeion); but to [Kronos] the mightily ruling son of Ouranos (Sky), the earlier king of the gods, she gave a great stone wrapped in swaddling clothes. Then he took it in his hands and thrust it down into his belly: wretch! he knew not in his heart that in place of the stone his son was left behind, unconquered and untroubled, and that he was soon to overcome him by force and might and drive him from his honours, himself to reign over the deathless gods.\n\nAfter that, the strength and glorious limbs of the prince increased quickly, and as the years rolled on, great Kronos the wily was beguiled by the deep suggestions of Gaia (Earth), and brought up again his offspring, vanquished by the arts and might of his own son, and he vomited up first the stone which he had swallowed last. And Zeus set it fast in the wide-pathed earth at goodly Pytho under the glens of Parnassos, to be a sign thenceforth and a marvel to mortal men. And he set free from their deadly bonds the brothers of his father, sons of Ouranos [the Hekatonkheires (Hecatoncheires) and Kyklopes (Cyclopes)] whom his father in his foolishness had bound. And they remembered to be grateful to him for his kindness, and gave him thunder and the glowing thunderbolt and lightening: for before that, huge Gaia (Earth) had hidden these. In them he trusts and rules over mortals and immortals.\"\n\nHesiod, Theogony 617 ff :\n\n\"The son of Kronos (Cronus) [Zeus] and the other deathless gods whom rich-haired Rhea bare from union with Kronos.\"\n\nHomeric Hymn 5 to Aphrodite 20 ff (trans.

Because both Ge (Earth) and Ouranos (Heaven) had given him prophetic warning that his rule would be overthrown by a son of his own, he took to swallowing his children at birth. He swallowed his first-born daughter Hestia, then Demeter and Hera, and after them Plouton (Pluton) [Haides] and Poseidon. Angered by this, Rhea, when she was heavy with Zeus, went off to Krete (Crete) and gave birth to him there in a cave on Mount Dikte (Dicte) . . . the armed Kouretes (Curetes) stood guard over him in the cave, banging their spears against their shields to prevent Kronos from hearing the infant's voice.

And the cause thereof is said to have been this : Kronos (Cronus) was aware of the fact that no human being is capable of having irresponsible control of all human affairs without becoming filled with pride and injustice; so, pondering this fact, he then appointed as kings and rulers for our cities, not men, but beings of a race that was nobler and more divine, namely, Daimones (Spirits). He acted just as we now do in the case of sheep and herds of tame animals: we do not set oxen as rulers over oxen, or goats over goats, but we, who are of a nobler race, ourselves rule over them. In like manner the god, in his love for humanity, set over us at that time the nobler race of Daimones who, with much comfort to themselves and much to us, took charge of us and furnished peace and modesty and orderliness and justice without stint, and thus made the tribes of men free from feud and happy. And even today this tale has a truth to tell, namely, that wherever a State has a mortal, and no god, for ruler, there the people have no rest from ills and toils; and it deems that we ought by every means to imitate the life of the age of Kronos, as tradition paints it.\" [Cf.

And under his care there were no states, nor did men possess wives or children . . . So there were no states or families, but they had fruits in plenty from the trees and other plants, which the earth furnished them of its own accord, without help from agriculture. And they lived for the most part in the open air, without clothing or bedding; for the climate was tempered for their comfort, and the abundant grass that grew up out of the earth furnished them soft couches.

His kingdom was strongest in the western regions, where indeed he enjoyed his greatest honour; consequently, down even to comparatively recent times, among the Romans [called by them Saturnus] and the Carthaginians [elsewhere the author mentions elsewhere that the Carthaginians sacrificed children to the god], while their city still stood, and other neighbouring peoples, notable festivals and sacrifices were celebrated in honour of this god and many places bore his name. And because of the exceptional obedience to laws no injustice was committed by any one at nay time and all the subjects of the rule of Kronos lived a life of blessedness, in the unhindered enjoyment of every pleasure. To this the poet Hesiod also bears witness in the following words : ‘And they who were Kronos' day, what time he reigned in heaven, lived like gods, no care in heart, remote and free from ills and toils severe, from grievous sicknesses and cares; old age lay not upon their limbs, but they, equal in strength of leg and arm, enjoyed endless delight of feasting far from ills, and when death came, they sank in it as in a sleep. And many other things were theirs; grain-giving earth, unploughed, bore for them fruit abundantly and without stint; and glad of heart they dwelt upon their tilth throughout the earth, in midst of blessing manifold, rich in their flocks, loved by the blessed gods.’ This then, is what the myths have to say about Kronos.\"\n\nPausanias, Description of Greece 5. 7. 6 (trans.

For the Titan gods and as many as sprang from Kronos had long been fighting together in stubborn war with heart-grieving toil, the lordly Titanes from high Othrys, but the gods, givers of good, whom rich-haired Rhea bare in union with Kronos, from Olympos. So they, with bitter wrath, were fighting continually with one another at that time for ten full years, and the hard strife had no close or end for either side, and the issue of the war hung evenly balanced . . . the father of men and gods spoke amongst them : ‘Hear me, bright children of Gaia and Ouranos, that I may say what my heart within me bids.

Often my mother Themis, or Gaia (Earth) (though one form, she had many names), had foretold to me the way in which the future was fated to come to pass. That it was not by brute strength nor through violence, but by guile that those who should gain the upper hand were destined to prevail. And though I argued all this to them, they did not pay any attention to my words. With all that before me, it seemed best that, joining with my mother, I should place myself, a welcome volunteer, on the side of Zeus; and it is by reason of my counsel that the cavernous gloom (melanbathês) of Tartaros (Tartarus) now hides ancient (palaigenês) Kronos and his allies within it.

After ten years of fighting Ge (Earth) prophesied a victory for Zeus if he were to secure the prisoners down in Tartaros as his allies. He thereupon slew their jail-keeper Kampe (Campe), and freed them from their bonds.

Now in the time of Kronos there was a law concerning mankind, and it holds to this very day amongst the gods, that every man who has passed a just and holy life departs after his decease to the Isles of the Blest (Nesoi Makaron), and dwells in all happiness apart from ill; but whoever has lived unjustly and impiously goes to the dungeon of requital and penance which, you know, they call Tartaros (Tartarus). Of these men there were judges in Kronos' time, and still of late in the reign of Zeus--living men to judge the living upon the day when each was to breathe his last; and thus the cases were being decided amiss. So Plouton [Haides] and the overseers from the Isles of the Blest came before Zeus with the report that they found men passing over to either abode undeserving. Then spake Zeus : ‘Nay,’ said he, ‘I will put a stop to these proceedings . . .

Rackham) (Roman rhetorician C1st B.C.) :\n\n\"Another theory also, and that a scientific one, has been the source of a number of deities, who clad in human form have furnished the poets with legends and have filled man's life with superstitions of all sorts. This subject was handled by Zeno and was later explained more fully by Cleanthes and Chrysippus. For example, an ancient belief prevailed throughout Greece that Caelus (the Sky) [Ouranos (Uranus)] was mutilated by his son Saturnus [Kronos (Cronus)], and Saturnus himself thrown into bondage by his son Jove [Zeus]: now these immoral fables enshrined a decidedly clever scientific theory. Their meaning was that the highest element of celestial ether or fire [Ouranos the Sky], which by itself generates all things, is devoid of that bodily part which required union with another for the work of procreation. By Saturnus [Kronos] again they denoted that being who maintains the course and revolution of the seasons and periods of time, the deity so designated in Greek, for Saturnus' Greek name is Kronos (Cronus), which is the same as khronos, a space of time. The Latin designation ‘Saturnus’ on the other hand is due to the fact that he is ‘saturated’ or ‘satiated with years’ (anni); the fable is that he was in the habit of devouring his sons--meaning that Time devours the ages and gorges himself insatiably with the years that are past. Saturnus is bound by Jove [Zeus] in order that Time's courses might not be unlimited, and that Jove might fetter him by the bonds of the stars.\"\n\nNonnus, Dionysiaca 6. 178 ff (trans.

Jones) (Greek geographer C1st B.C. to C1st A.D.) :\n\n\"The city of Gades is situated on the westerly parts of the island [of Gades off the coast of southern Spain]; and next to it, at the extremity of the island and near the islet, is the temple of Kronos (Cronus); but the temple of Herakles is situated on the other side, facing towards the east.\"\n\nCRONUS MISCELLANY\n\nPlato, Cratylus 396a (trans. Fowler) (Greek philosopher C4th B.C.) :\n\n\"[Plato constructs philosophical etymologies for the names of the gods :]\n\nSokrates (Socrates) : This god [Zeus] is correctly named, through whom (di' hon) all living beings have the gift of life (zên) . . . And it might seem, at first hearing, highly irreverent to call him the son of Kronos (Cronus) and reasonable to say that Zeus is the offspring of some great intellect; and so he is, for koros signifies not child, but the purity (katharon) and unblemished nature of his mind. Kronos, according to tradition, is the son of Ouranos (Uranus, Heaven); but the upward gaze is rightly called by the name heavenly (ourania), looking at the things above (horô ta anô), and the astronomers say, Hermogenes, that from this looking people acquire a pure mind, and Ouranos is correctly named.\"\n\nPlato, Cratylus 400d & 401e :\n\n\"[Plato constructs philosophical etymologies for the names of the gods :]\n\nSokrates (Socrates) : Let us inquire what thought men had in giving them [the gods] their names . . . The first men who gave names [to the gods] were no ordinary persons, but high thinkers and great talkers . . . After Hestia it is right to consider Rhea and Kronos (Cronus). The name of Kronos, however, has already been discussed . . . I seem to have a vision of Herakleitos (Heraclitus) [philosopher C6th to 5th B.C.] saying some ancient words of wisdom as old as the reign of Kronos and Rhea, which Homer said too . . . Herakleitos says, you know, that all things move and nothing remains still, and he likens the universe to the current of a river, saying that you cannot step twice into the same stream . . . Well, don't you think he who gave to the ancestors of the other gods the names ‘Rhea’ and ‘Kronos’ had the same thought as Herakleitos? Do you think he gave both of them the names of streams merely by chance? Just so Homer, too, says--‘Okeanos (Oceanus) the origin of the gods, and their mother Tethys.’\"\n\n[N.B. Plato associates the name of Rhea with the verb \"to flow\" and Kronos with \"time\" and connects the pair with the gods of the world-river, Okeanos and Tethys.]\n\nCRONUS IDENTIFIED WITH EL OLAM (PHOENICIAN)\n\nKronos (Cronus) was identified by the Greeks with the Phoenician god of time El Olam (El of Eternal Time), spelt Oulomos in Greek. The child sacrifices offered this god underlined the connection in the Greek mind.\n\nDiodorus Siculus, Library of History 5. 66. 4 (trans. Oldfather) (Greek historian C1st B.C.) :\n\n\"His [Kronos' (Cronus')] kingdom was strongest in the western regions, where indeed he enjoyed his greatest honour; consequently, down even to comparatively recent times, among the Romans [called by them Saturnus] and the Carthaginians [elsewhere the author mentions the Carthaginians sacrifice of children to the god], while their city still stood, and other neighbouring peoples, notable festivals and sacrifices were celebrated in honour of this god and many places bore his name.\"\n\nNonnus, Dionysiaca 41. 655 ff (trans. Rouse) (Greek epic C5th A.D.) :\n\n\"Now first appeared the golden crop of men [the Golden Race of Mankind] brought forth in the image of the gods, with the roots of their stock in the earth. And these dwelt in the [Phoenician] city of Beroe, that primordial seat which Kronos (Cronus) himself builded.\"\n\nSuidas s.v. Sardanios gelos (trans. Suda On Line) (Byzantine Greek lexicon C10th A.D.) :\n\n\"Sardanios gelos. Sardonic laugh. A proverb applied to those laughing at their own death. Demon says that it was handed down because the inhabitants of Sardinia used to sacrifice to Kronos (Cronus) the finest of their captives and those over 70 years of age, who laughed to show their courage (that is, bravery). But Timaios (Timaeus) [says] that those who had lived long enough in Sardinia used to laugh when they were herded by their sons with wooden staves into the trench in which they were about to be buried . . . And Klitarkhos (Clitarchus) and others say that in Carthage, during great prayers, they place a boy in the hands of Kronos (a bronze statue is set up, with outstretched hands, and under it a baking oven) and then put fire under; the boy shrunk by the fire seems to laugh.\" [N.B. The \"Sardinians\" are probably the Carthaginian colonists of the island whose towns dotted the coast.]\n\nCRONUS IDENTIFIED WITH SATURN (ROMAN)\n\nKronos (Cronus) was identified with the Italian agricultural god Saturnus (Saturn), in whose honour the mid-winter Saturnalia festival was celebrated.\n\nDiodorus Siculus, Library of History 5. 66. 4 (trans. Oldfather) (Greek historian C1st B.C.) :\n\n\"Kronos (Cronus) [here the Italian Saturnus], since he was the eldest of the Titanes (Titans), became king and caused all men who were his subjects to change from a rude way of living to civilized life, and for this reason he received great approbation and visited many regions of the inhabited earth. Among all he met he introduced justice and sincerity of the soul, and this is why the tradition has come down to later generations that he men of Kronos' time were good-hearted, altogether guileless, and blest with felicity. His kingdom was strongest in the western regions, where indeed he enjoyed his greatest honour; consequently, down even to comparatively recent times, among the Romans [called by them Saturnus] and the Carthaginians [elsewhere the author mentions the Carthaginian sacrifice of children to the god], while their city still stood, and other neighbouring peoples, notable festivals and sacrifices were celebrated in honour of this god and many places bore his name. And because of the exceptional obedience to laws no injustice was committed by any one at nay time and all the subjects of the rule of Kronos lived a life of blessedness, in the unhindered enjoyment of every pleasure. To this the poet Hesiod also bears witness in the following words : ‘And they who were Kronos' day, what time he reigned in heaven, lived like gods, no care in heart, remote and free from ills and toils severe, from grievous sicknesses and cares; old age lay not upon their limbs, but they, equal in strength of leg and arm, enjoyed endless delight of feasting far from ills, and when death came, they sank in it as in a sleep. And many other things were theirs; grain-giving earth, unploughed, bore for them fruit abundantly and without stint; and glad of heart they dwelt upon their tilth throughout the earth, in midst of blessing manifold, rich in their flocks, loved by the blessed gods.’ This then, is what the myths have to say about Kronos.\"\n\nOvid, Metamorphoses 14. 320 ff (trans. Melville) (Roman epic C1st B.C. to C1st A.D.) :\n\n\"King Picus, son of Saturnus [Kronos (Cronus)], ruled the land of Ausonia [Latium], a king whose chief delight was chargers for battle.\"\n\nVirgil, Aeneid 7. 48 ff (trans. Day-Lewis) (Roman epic C1st B.C.) :\n\n\"Faunus was son of Picus, who called Saturnus his father--yes, Saturnus [Kronos (Cronus)] originated their line.\"\n\nCicero, De Natura Deorum 3. 17 (trans. Rackham) (Roman rhetorician C1st B.C.) :\n\n\"If these brothers [Zeus, Poseidon, Haides] are included among the gods, can we deny the divinity of their father Saturnus [Kronos (Cronus)], who is held in the highest reverence by the common people in the west [Italy]? And if he is a god, we must also admit that his father Caelus (Sky) [Ouranos (Uranus)] is a god.\"\n\nANCIENT GREEK & ROMAN ART\n\nSOURCES\n\nGREEK\n\nHomer, The Iliad - Greek Epic C8th B.C.\n\nHesiod, Theogony - Greek Epic C8th - 7th B.C.\n\nHesiod, Works and Days - Greek Epic C8th - 7th B.C.\n\nThe Homeric Hymns - Greek Epic C8th - 4th B.C.\n\nEpic Cycle, Titanomachia Fragments - Greek Epic C8th B.C.\n\nPindar, Odes - Greek Lyric C5th B.C.\n\nPindar, Fragments - Greek Lyric C5th B.C.\n\nGreek Lyric III Stesichorus, Fragments - Greek Lyric C7th - 6th B.C.\n\nGreek Lyric IV Corinna, Fragments - Greek Lyric C5th B.C.\n\nGreek Lyric V Timotheus, Fragments - Greek Lyric C5th B.C.\n\nAeschylus, Agamemnon - Greek Tragedy C5th B.C.\n\nAeschylus, Eumenides - Greek Tragedy C5th B.C.\n\nAeschylus, Prometheus Bound - Greek Tragedy C5th B.C.\n\nAeschylus, Fragments - Greek Tragedy C5th B.C.\n\nPlato, Cratylus - Greek Philosophy C4th B.C.\n\nPlato, Euthyphro - Greek Philosophy C4th B.C.\n\nPlato, Gorgias - Greek Philosophy C4th B.C.\n\nPlato, Hipparchus - Greek Philosophy C4th B.C.\n\nPlato, Laws - Greek Philosophy C4th B.C.\n\nPlato, Republic - Greek Philosophy C4th B.C.\n\nPlato, Statesman - Greek Philosophy C4th B.C.\n\nApollodorus, The Library - Greek Mythography C2nd A.D.\n\nApollonius Rhodius, The Argonautica - Greek Epic C3rd B.C.\n\nCallimachus, Hymns - Greek Poetry C3rd B.C.\n\nCallimachus, Fragments - Greek Poetry C3rd B.C.\n\nLycophron, Alexandra - Greek Poetry C3rd B.C.\n\nAratus, Phaenomena - Greek Astronomy C3rd B.C.\n\nDiodorus Siculus, The Library of History - Greek History C1st B.C.\n\nStrabo, Geography - Greek Geography C1st B.C. - C1st A.D.\n\nPausanias, Description of Greece - Greek Travelogue C2nd A.D.\n\nPlutarch, Lives - Greek Historian C1st - 2nd A.D.\n\nThe Orphic Hymns - Greek Hymns C3rd B.C. - C2nd A.D.\n\nAntoninus Liberalis, Metamorphoses - Greek Mythography C2nd A.D.\n\nOppian, Cynegetica - Greek Poetry C3rd A.D.\n\nNonnus, Dionysiaca - Greek Epic C5th A.D.\n\nROMAN\n\nHyginus, Fabulae - Latin Mythography C2nd A.D.\n\nOvid, Metamorphoses - Latin Epic C1st B.C. - C1st A.D.\n\nOvid, Fasti - Latin Poetry C1st B.C. - C1st A.D.\n\nVirgil, Aeneid - Latin Epic C1st B.C.\n\nVirgil, Georgics - Latin Bucolic C1st B.C.\n\nCicero, De Natura Deorum - Latin Rhetoric C1st B.C.\n\nPliny the Elder, Natural History - Latin Encyclopedia C1st A.D.\n\nSeneca, Hercules Oetaeus - Latin Tragedy C1st A.D.\n\nStatius, Thebaid - Latin Epic C1st A.D.\n\nBYZANTINE\n\nSuidas, The Suda - Byzantine Greek Lexicon C10th A.D.\n\nBIBLIOGRAPHY"
