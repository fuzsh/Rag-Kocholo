        "text": "“String Follow is a work of evil genius that put me in a literal trance and didn’t relinquish me until the final page. Like the irresistibly wise, dark, and unfathomable force it conjures, the voice got in my head and tainted my soul. I loved every insidious second.”\n\n—Mona Awad, author of All’s Well and Bunny\n\n”String Follow is a horrific descent into the madness that alternately connects and isolates us. Simon Jacobs creates a world where the characters’ everyday terrors are taken advantage of by a larger force, a brilliant web of evil that stretches over an entire southern Ohio town. It’s a riveting and unstoppable journey.”\n\n—Rachel Eve Moulton, author of Tinfoil Butterfly\n\n”String Follow is a deliciously dark modern gothic that deftly mines the terrors and vicissitudes of the suburban teenager. A small town in Ohio and, indeed, the reader are soon stalked by a mysterious dark force as it hunts for the perfect prey, but it is Simon Jacobs’s sly and simmering prose that is the most undeniable force, slipping under your skin to haunt you long after the last page.”\n\n—Kira Jane Buxton, author of Hollow Kingdom\n\n”The prose is intoxicating and hypnotic . . . and the characters, whether they make you cringe or break your heart or both, wind up being people you feel like you know.”\n\n—Chris Harding Thornton, author of Pickard County Atlas\n\n”A terrifying glimpse into teen anomie and rootlessness . . . Grim, violent Midwestern gothic—hard to watch, hard to turn away from.”\n\n—Kirkus\n\n”A horrific take on coming of age.”\n\n—Publishers Weekly\n\n”String Follow reads kind of like if the Ice Storm was a horror story. . . . Moody, quirky, and funny, this is the perfect possession story for the social media age.”\n\n—Molly Odintz, CrimeReads, Best Horror Fiction of 2022\n\nPress:\n\nreview in Publishers Weekly.\n\nreview in Kirkus Reviews.\n\nListed in The Best Horror Fiction of 2022 (CrimeReads).\n\nInterview with Tobias Carroll in Vol. 1 Brooklyn.\n\nFeatured in Chantal V. Johnson’s “A Year in Reading” (The Millions).\n\nInterview with Malavika Praseed on the Your Favorite Book podcast (about Kazuo Ishiguro’s The Remains of the Day).\n\nInterview with Alex Higley and Lindsay Hunter on the I’m a Writer But… podcast.\n\nChris Harding Thornton on String Follow at 5 Years of MCD.\n\nOther roundups: Chicago Review of Books; Vol. 1 Brooklyn; Alta Journal; Tor Nightfire; This Is Horror, Gizmodo; CrimeReads.\n\n\"Jacobs’s terrifying debut novel is a master class in anxiety and atmosphere.\"\n\n—Publishers Weekly (starred review)\n\n\"Palaces is robust, both current and clairvoyant, and answers the question of what happens when our deepest fantasies become reality. With a pitch-perfect portrayal of the punk scene and idiosyncratic, meaty characters, this is a wonderful novel that takes no prisoners.\"\n\n—Foreword Reviews (starred review)\n\n\"In Simon Jacobs’ tense, unwinding novel Palaces, two midwestern punks wander an anarchic, eerily unpeopled landscape . . . Even as the narrator progresses farther north and away from his old life, the indeterminate noise and violence of a musty punk house pit are never far.\"\n\n—Niina Pollari, Pitchfork\n\n\"Palaces utilizes aspects of speculative fiction and horror as its story unfolds, but its questions are thoroughly primal. . . . Whether he’s outlining a harrowing vision of a sparse tomorrow or providing a lived-in perspective on a small punk scene, Jacobs has unsettling questions on his mind, and the disorienting narrative of Palaces is the means by which he’s asking them.\"\n\n—Tobias Carroll, Tor.com\n\n\"Palaces is post-apocalyptic, but stranger than that. It’s a novel that’s gritty, moving, and punk.\"\n\n—Nate McNamara, Literary Hub\n\n\"If you’re looking for something a little more punk rock this spring, look no further... Surreal, strange, and drenched in mosh scenes, it’s a bit of a nailbiter, too.\"\n\n—Sarah Rose Etter, Philadelphia Weekly\n\n\"A fierce fever dream paused at that worst moment before we wake up. A tightening loop of the tension of untying and retying ourselves down: to people, to place, to motive and motivation. Less a meditation than a persistent jab in the ribs, repeating patterns of distrust and surrender. Addictively disorienting.\"\n\n—Jac Jemc, author of The Grip of It and My Only Wife\n\n\"In this singular debut novel that reads like a cross between Derek Jarman's Jubilee and an unsettling folk ballad, Jacobs narrates the journey of two Midwestern pilgrims, each striving for ascetic purity both in their possessions and in their emotional lives, as they silently war against the ostentation of the wealthy, the dread expectations of gender, maybe against object permanence itself. It feels like The Road, but with less faith in humanity, and this S. Jacobs is a literary talent to watch.\"\n\n—Jeanne Thornton, author of The Dream of Doctor Bantam\n\nSATURN was first published by Spork Press in 2014. Now, in 2024, it returns to print in a 10-year anniversary edition, featuring new stories.\n\n“The stories in Saturn are inventive, playful, and meditative—Simon Jacobs orbits Bowie the icon in order to write Bowie as both the person and the imagined person, and to great effect. I'm very glad this book is back in print again.”\n\n—Chelsea Hodson, author of Tonight I’m Someone Else\n\n“I will forward one to DB.”\n\n—Mark Adams, Bowienet\n\nPreorder from Long Day Press.\n\n★\n\nSelected press for previous editions:\n\nreview in PANK by Emily-Jo Hopson.\n\nreview in Entropy Magazine by Derek Sapienza.\n\nreview in NANO Fiction by Christopher Bundy.\n\nreview in The Rumpus by Benjamin Rybeck.\n\nreview in DIAGRAM by Alison McCabe.\n\nreview in Fiction Advocate by Brian Hurley.\n\non Chelsea Hodson's \"Inventory.\"\n\n\"Wearing Your Fiction on Your Sleeve,\" by Freddie Moore; an interview with Black Balloon about the Safety Pin Review and SATURN.\n\n\"An Analog Experience,\" by David Mendez in Tucson Weekly, a feature on Spork that talks about the production of SATURN.\n\n\"Spork's Six New Books,\" by Rauan Klassnik in HTMLGiant, featuring a blurb from Francis Bacon.\n\nin Luna Luna Magazine, Dena Rash Guzman includes SATURN among her AWP finds.\n\nby Momus.\n\nby J.
