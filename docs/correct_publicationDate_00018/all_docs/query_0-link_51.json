        "text": "The “All Star Anniversary Issue” of Fantasy And Science Fiction Magazine (for October 1958) featured famed editor Anthony Boucher’s regular “Recommending Reading” column – but with a twist. In celebration of the magazine’s 9th anniversary Boucher challenged himself to create a list of “Fifty Review Copies I Would Not Part With.” He failed in this herculean task – he just couldn’t pair down the list to fifty (even by restricting what would qualify in a number of ways). Instead, he ended up listing 52 Science Fiction novels or collections that he had no hand in publishing, another six that he did, and twelve Fantasy titles that were absolute must keepers as well. Of them Boucher wrote:\n\n“These are novels and collections which have, from 1949 through 1957, given intense pleasure to a man professionally, obligated to read every s.f. book published in America; and I venture the guess that any reader, novice or habitué of our field, will find stimulation and delight in a high number of these titles.”\n\nThat’s good enough for me! I have reproduced as Boucher listed them (in alphabetical order by author). But I’ve added links to extant audiobook editions:\n\nBoucher’s 52 best SF books:\n\nBrain Wave by Poul Anderson |BLACKSTONE AUDIO|\n\nI, Robot by Isaac Asimov [COLLECTION] |READ OUR REVIEW|\n\nThe Caves Of Steel by Isaac Asimov |READ OUR REVIEW|\n\nThe Naked Sun by Isaac Asimov |READ OUR REVIEW|\n\nEarth Is Room Enough by Isaac Asimov [COLLECTION]\n\nThe Demolished Man by Alfred Bester\n\nThe Stars My Destination by Alfred Bester\n\nThe Long Tomorrow by Leigh Brackett\n\nThe Martian Chronicles by Ray Bradbury [COLLECTION] |READ OUR REVIEW|\n\nWhat Mad Universe by Fredric Brown\n\nThe Lights In The Sky Are Stars by Fredric Brown\n\nAngels And Spaceships by Fredric Brown [COLLECTION]\n\nCloak Of Aesir by John W.
