        "text": "Charlie Jane Anders’s novel All the Birds in the Sky came out earlier this year, and has been very well received. This unusual tale follows the lives of a witch and a super-scientist who were best friends in middle school, and raises lots of questions about science, magic, popular culture, and coming of age. Anders is well known for her short fiction and her work on the pop-culture website IO9. Anders recently read at a bookstore event in Petaluma, California, which Marion attended, and took some time to talk about the book, her influences,\n\nRead More\n\nMarion Deeds | Charlie Jane Anders | Author Interviews, Giveaway! | 17 comments |\n\nAll the Birds in the Sky by Charlie Jane Anders\n\nAll the Birds in the Sky, by Charlie Jane Anders, is a likeable book. The writing is fluent, filled with grace notes, witty observations and jokes that poke fun, but gently, at certain subcultures and stereotypes — mostly, the ones we all enjoy mocking from time to time.\n\nFurthermore, in her Afterword, Anders says that if you don’t understand the story, she will come to your house and “act the whole thing out for you.\n\nRead More\n\nMarion Deeds and Katie Burton´s rating: 3 | Charlie Jane Anders | Nebula Award, Stand-Alone | SFF Reviews | 4 comments |\n\nRock Manning Goes for Broke by Charlie Jane Anders\n\nThe thing I loved the most about Rock Manning Goes for Broke, the 2018 novella by Charlie Jane Anders, is the narrative voce of Rock himself. Here are the opening lines:\n\nEarliest I remember, Daddy threw me off the roof of our split-level house. “Boy’s gotta learn to fall sometime,” he told my mom just before he slung my pants seat and let me go.\n\nThat’s the flavor of this brief,\n\nRead More\n\nMarion Deeds´s rating: 5 | Charlie Jane Anders | Short Fiction, Stand-Alone | SFF Reviews | 4 comments |\n\nThe City in the Middle of the Night by Charlie Jane Anders\n\nThe second novel by Charlie Jane Anders, The City in the Middle of the Night (2019), surprised me. Having read her fantastical debut novel All the Birds in the Sky, and her sociological science fiction novella Rock Manning Goes for Broke, I was not expecting a story set on an exo-planet and a society vastly distant from Earth in time and space.\n\nRead More\n\nMarion Deeds´s rating: 5 | Charlie Jane Anders | Stand-Alone | SFF Reviews | 5 comments |\n\nVictories Greater Than Death by Charlie Jane Anders\n\n2021’s Victories Greater That Death is the first book in Charlie Jane Anders’s new Young Adult space opera series, UNSTOPPABLE. The book is filled with smart, heroic young people, extraterrestrials, space adventures, horrifying villains, bad food and plenty of relationships, as six Terran humans get pulled up onto The Royal Fleet warship Indomitable. The Royal Fleet is smack-dab in the middle of a war with a faction that calls itself Compassion.\n\nRead More\n\nMarion Deeds´s rating: 4 | Charlie Jane Anders | Young Adult | SFF Reviews | 2 comments |\n\nDreams Bigger Than Heartbreak by Charlie Jane Anders\n\n“Knowledge is ugly, and that’s why we wear cute dresses and eat cake.”\n\nAs with most second books in a trilogy, things are bad, teetering on the precipice, by the end of Charlie Jane Anders’s second YA SF book Dreams Bigger Than Heartbreak (2022). Our stalwart band of earthlings are not giving up, however, even in the face of injury, doubt, and a devastating loss.\n\nIn Victories Greater Than Death,\n\nRead More\n\nMarion Deeds´s rating: 4.5 | Charlie Jane Anders | Young Adult | SFF Reviews | 3 comments |\n\nIt was a treat to reread Geoff Ryman’s “What We Found” to prepare to write this column. As I noted when I wrote about this story for my review on the issue of F&SF in which it originally appeared, Ryman has been writing in recent years of third-world cultures, in such a way that the reader becomes immersed in the culture, surrounded by sights, scents, tastes and sounds of a world so foreign to a first-worlder that it might as well be an alien civilization. This time, the setting is Makurdi in central Nigeria,\n\nRead More\n\nTerry Weyna | Brad R.
