        "text": "It struck me a few years ago when I was doing some work on Maxims I, that the monastic poets behind a significant portion of the Old English poetic corpus were the equivalent of Woodie Guthrie and Bob Dylan. Both were reworking older folk material with a new message. In the case of the American folk musicians, the older materials were traditional songs, while in the case of the Old English religious poets , the older materials were heroic poems.\n\nAround this time, inspiration took hold of me and I dashed off a Dylanesque version of the Anglo-Saxon poem Solomon and Saturn. At the time I was only starting this blog and the scope was still too narrow to include such extensions to the initial concept of explicating the Old English literary works. Since then the blog has become more eclectic and, on reviewing this piece after many years, I thought it was good fun and worth publishing. Those looking for the immediate source of inspiration from Dylan will find it inter alia in his song Highway 61 Revisited. You can read the lyrics on Mr Dylan’s site here.\n\n(Image: King Solomon receiving the Queen of Sheba)\n\nHere is my humble effort, which I hope people will enjoy.\n\nKing Solomon’s Blues\n\nLong before the Romans, when Methususelah was a kid\n\nKing Solomon was on his throne, doing whatever it was great kings did\n\nRemembering his daddy’s words, writing the Song of Songs\n\nAnd sending thousands of prisoners to the mines, bound with leather thongs.\n\nThe admiring press said he was so wise, the sharpest in his day\n\nHe answered the toughest questions, made it all seem like childs play.\n\nThe Queen of Sheba came to town, asking for his advice\n\nHe swept her off her pretty feet, showed her the way to paradise.\n\nThen one day a stranger arrived, riding on a camel’s back\n\nWith a jeweled turban on his head and his memoirs in a sack.\n\nMy name he said is Saturn, I’m a Chaldean from Babylon\n\nI’m here to see who’s the smartest, me or King Solomon.\n\nFor we Chaldeans are pretty intelligent, we sure know a thing or two\n\nAbout stars and planets, war and peace and the name of you know who.\n\nWe know all about geometry and we once built a mighty tower,\n\nBut the angels flattened it, they had overwhelming air power.\n\nSolomon said I don’t usually do this kind of thing, my wisdom is beyond dispute\n\nIt’s true I riddled for Lady Sheba, but only because she was cute.\n\nBut I can’t have you going back to your land and enhancing your authority\n\nBy falsely claiming that your ideas could threaten my moral superiority.\n\nSo they set up a great spectacle, a debate between two great teachers\n\nFolks came streaming down the highway and paid 61 bucks to sit on bleachers.\n\nSolomon got to start the contest and straightway he put the boot in\n\nTell me Saturn, where is the land that no man can set foot in.\n\nThat’d be the desert where the famous warrior whipped up a storm\n\nKicked those dragons’ butts, made ’em wish they’d never been born.\n\nIt was a Pyrrhic victory – they retreated and now its a no go area.\n\nA shattered tank stands above their graves and monsters roam the interior.\n\nHa ha, you silly fellow said Solomon and laughed himself sick\n\nYou made a great mistake in thinking my question was geopolitic\n\nI don’t want to talk about failed states, they do my wisdom no credit,\n\nMy question was just a riddle, the answer’s the sea floor, geddit?\n\nVery well said Saturn, perhaps you can enlighten me\n\nAbout an aberration whose very mention is enough to frighten me.\n\nAh, you mean Gaza Mortis, the four-headed bird which I keep locked up in Palestine\n\nIt clanks its chains and swears revenge and waits for the end of time.\n\nSaid Saturn name the creature which attacks at will, which defeats and subjugates\n\nAnd let me give you a clue here, it has nothing to do with islamic caliphates.\n\nSaid Solomon that’s easy, old age catches everything in the end,\n\nWhether animal, vegetable, mineral or political, nothing lasts for ever my friend.\n\nSaturnus:\n\nLo, I have tasted the books of all the islands,\n\nwith cunning scripts unlocked the learning of the Libyans and the Greeks\n\nand the history of the Indian realm.\n\nCommentators pointed me to tales in the great library,\n\nfrom Moses’ hands[1], such as I could never find, truly collected,\n\nin all the ancient writings. Constantly I tried to discover\n\nwhat might be the palm-branched [2] Paternoster\n\nof intellect, strength, valour, power or nobility.\n\nI will give you all I have, son of David, Lord of Israel,\n\nthirty pounds of beaten gold and my twelve sons,\n\nif you make the words of the Song, Christ’s sequence, spur me\n\nif you reconcile me with truth so I can journey on, made whole,\n\nwillingly returning on the water’s back,\n\nacross the Chebar’s flood home to Chaldea.\n\nSaloman:\n\nWretched in this world, his life pointless,\n\nbarren of wisdom, wandering like cattle,\n\nbeasts of the field devoid of wit, is he who cannot\n\nthrough the words of the Song praise Christ.\n\nHe roams, full of wind, and come doomsday,\n\ndevils, terrible dragons, will shoot him shamefully\n\nwith iron apples hurled from a black catapault\n\nand all will be washed by the crests of the scourging waves.\n\nThen will it be dearer to him\n\nthan all this gleaming new creation\n\nMoulded of gold and silver from the ground up,\n\nfilled to its four corners with valuable treasure,\n\nif he ever knew any part of the holy Instrument.\n\nFor at that time he will be merely a wicked man\n\nwandering, estranged from almighty God,\n\nalone without affinity to the angels.\n\nSaturnus:\n\nWho of all creation may open most easily in succession\n\nthe gleaming holy doors of the kingdom of heaven?\n\nSaloman:\n\nThe palm-branched [2] Paternoster\n\nopens the heavens,\n\ngladdens the saints\n\nmakes the Lord merciful,\n\noverthrows murder,\n\nquenches the devil’s fire\n\nwhile stoking the Lord’s.\n\nSo you could use the glowing prayer\n\nto heat your blood dry of the devil [3], cause its drops to rise,\n\nwhisked by the heat, by the prayer’s seven Petitions,\n\nmore fearsome than the bronze cauldron which will boil greedily\n\nfor twelve generations in hellfire’s grip.\n\nBecause the Song is the most glorious of all of Christ’s books:\n\nit teaches the scriptures, guides with its voice and,\n\nwielding weapons, holds its position for the kingdom of heaven.\n\nSaturnus:\n\nBut how should the holy Instrument be used mentally by one desirous\n\nthat his spirit should be melted against misdeeds,\n\npurified of sorrow, separated from sin?\n\nTruly the Creator gave it wondrous beauty.\n\nMy worldly curiosity constantly queries this,\n\nmoves quickly, stirs my mind.\n\nNo man, no hero under heaven, knows\n\nHow my thoughts labour, busy after books.\n\nOften a burning rises in me,\n\nmy spirit near the heart, and my bloodstream [4] boils.\n\nSaloman:\n\nGolden is the word God spoke, gemstudded,\n\nit has silver leaves, and each one individually may,\n\nthrough the gift of the spirit, declare the gospel.\n\nIt is wisdom to the heart,\n\nhoney to the soul,\n\nmilk to the mind,\n\nthe most fortunate of glories.\n\nIt may rescue the soul from perpetual night under the earth\n\nno matter how deep the fiend fastens it with fetters.\n\nThough he clamp it with fifty clasps, it will crack them\n\ndisintegrate the strength of those devices.\n\nIt destroys hunger,\n\nharrows hell,\n\noverthrows the boiling pit\n\nand builds the foundations of glory.\n\nIt is braver than all the world\n\nstronger in its position,\n\nthan the grip of any stone\n\nIt is leech to the lame,\n\nlight to those in the darkness,\n\nthe door of the deaf,\n\nthe tongue of the dumb,\n\nthe shield of the sinner.\n\nIt is the blessing of the creator,\n\nwho controls the tides,\n\nsaviour of the people,\n\nowner of the waves,\n\nthe pools of lowly fish and worms,\n\nthe woods of the wild deer,\n\nguardian in the wasteland,\n\nthe sanctuary of honour.\n\nAnd whoever is keen to sing the words of God truly\n\nand always cherish them without sin\n\nhe may set the harmful spirit, the militant enemy to flight.\n\nIf you first lead against him the anger\n\nof the prime prologue [5] whose name is\n\nP [6] This warrior has a long staff, a gilded goad\n\nwith which he ever bravely slashes the grim fiend.\n\nIn his path follows the mighty\n\nA who will beat him too.\n\nT will plague him and pierce his tongue,\n\nwring his neck and slash his cheek\n\nE will do him ill, just as he always does\n\nsteadfastly resisting every foe. Then\n\nR leader of letters attacks in a rage\n\nstraightway grabs the fiend by the hair,\n\ndashes the demon’s shank on a rock.\n\nBut the devil, ignoring the pain in his joints,\n\nfor no doctor can cure him, retreats behind clouds,\n\nseeks a safer arena under cover of darkness.\n\nBut there is woe in his heart as, dragging his leg,\n\nhe wishes for hell, the hardest of homelands.\n\nThen the twins [7] of the church overcome [8] him\n\nN and\n\nO together bring slashes from their scythes,\n\ncausing pain to the alien bodies,\n\ncaring nought for his life. Then\n\nS captain of angels, glory’s sign,\n\nseizes the raging foe by the foot\n\nmakes him fall flat on his face\n\non the hard stone, strewing his teeth\n\naround the hellish band. Each hides in the gloomy shadows.\n\nThe fiend is troubled, Satan’s servant silenced. So too\n\nQ and\n\nU the great leaders of legions humble the foe with torments.\n\nThey advance against him, they have gleaming spears, long shafts.\n\nResolutely they slash, sparing not their strokes\n\ntheir brave blows. They loathe the devil!\n\nI and L surround him in battle. The knight errant\n\nC [9] lagging behind\n\nL with his crooked rod, wields bitter terror.\n\nStraightway they force hell’s inmate into retreat. Then\n\nF and\n\nM surround and sorely press the guilty wretch\n\nwith their sharp spears. With grim showers of arrows\n\nthey set fire to the fiend’s hair\n\nthey strew bitter terror with their shafts.\n\nfiercely they shall repay the criminals with rage\n\nmaking them often break their battle boasts.\n\nRushing to be the next to trouble him is\n\nD with the strength of five, followed by the broadshouldered\n\nG whom God sends to help his friends, while further on hiding\n\nB eside [10] the street is a third warrior, standing perfectly still.\n\nH hastens, equipped by an angel, Christ’s champion,\n\nwearing the living form of a young novice.\n\nThen the brothers of life [11] from aloft mightily rage\n\nagainst the devil under the legions of stars\n\nwith the points of branches, silver scourges,\n\nuntil his bones show, his veins bleed\n\nthey pour a rage of spears on the greedy devil.\n\nGod’s word may ever put to flight the world’s enemies,\n\nissuing from man’s mouth, hard press the evil black troop\n\nregardless of what strange forms they change into.\n\nAfter they have worn the plumage of birds\n\nsometimes they will seize a sea creature,\n\nsometimes they change into the body of a serpent,\n\nstrong and scaley, to bite cattle\n\ndevastating the animals in the fields.\n\nSometimes in water a devil will bring down a steed [12]\n\nhewing it with his horns until its heart’s blood,\n\nfoamy streaming bath, falls to earth.\n\nSometimes he puts shackles on the hands of a doomed man\n\nweighs them down, when he must fight for his life\n\nin battle against a hostile force.\n\nHe carves on the man’s weapon a cluster of fatal marks\n\nlethal letters, a script against the sword and the blade’s virtue.\n\nTo prevent this no man should draw his well-wrought weapon\n\ntoo often, though its beauty please him.\n\nHe should always sing the Paternoster when drawing his sword\n\nand say a joyful prayer to the palmtree of life [13]\n\nthat it give him both life and a strong hand, when his foe comes.\n\nNOTES\n\n[1] There is a gap of 10-12 spaces in Ms. B, followed by ‘M ces heardum’. Ms. A, which is almost illegible for the first 30 lines, has ‘…ses h.nd..’ . The Ms. has bec, ‘book’, which is nearly always fem, so doesn’t fit with the preceding modifiers ðam micelan, which are masc. or neut. Most likely bec is the start of a compound word with masc. or neut. gender. The word for library is bochord, which is masc. There are cases of compound doublets with boc- and bec-, so perhaps this is bechord. I read ðam micelan bechorde of Moises handum.\n\n[2] In the Blickling Homily XIII, an angel gives Mary a ‘scinende palmtwig’, a shining palm-branch, prior to her assumption. Other sources for the same Assumption story say this is from the ‘Tree of Life’. A palm-branch is also a symbol of victory. So palmtwigode, palm-branched, means either blessed or victorious and is part of an extended metaphor of the Lord’s Prayer as the Tree of Life.\n\n[3] See my piece on this passage here\n\n[4] See my piece on this passage here\n\n[5] ‘prologa prima’ a meaningless invented term in the original\n\n[6] The letters are shown here down the left hand side. Each letter appears only the first time it is mentioned in the Lord’s Prayer. The full prayer, with the first occurences in capitals is as follows (NB: v = u)\n\nPATER NOSter, QUI es in CaeLis,\n\nsanctiFicetur noMen tuum.\n\naDveniat reGnum tuum.\n\nfiat voluntas tua,\n\nsicut in caelo, et in terra.\n\npanem nostrum cotidianum da noBis Hodie,\n\net dimitte nobis debita nostra,\n\nsicut et nos dimittimus debitoribus nostris.\n\net ne nos inducas in tentationem,\n\nsed libera nos a malo.\n\n[7] twins because N and O are the only letters which appear in alphabetical order.\n\n[8] forcinnað, which means ‘disown’ is meaningless. I read with Grein forcymað, ‘destroy’.\n\n[9] C appears out of sequence before L. It is called yrra, which means both ‘angry’ and ‘wandering’.\n\n[10] B is not shown as a letter, because it is hiding!\n\n[11] the original has lifgetwinnan, ‘life-twins’. I take this passage to refer to all the letters together. As the palm-branches are from the Tree of Life in the Assumption story, and the prayer is a palm-tree, the letters of the prayer are brothers from the tree of life, or life-brothers.\n\n[12] the imagery suggests a horse crossing a river brought down by sea-monsters.\n\n[13] As the palm-branches are from the Tree of Life in the Assumption story, and the letters wield the branches, so the entire prayer is a palm-tree\n\nThe fire and light passage in Solomon and Saturn II has not received the literary appreciation it deserves owing to a combination of defective manuscript transmission and insensitive scholarship. But with careful and imaginative reading we can recover it from oblivion, bring its beauty back into the light and savour its meaning.\n\nThe Conundrum of the Opening Lines\n\nThe lead-in to the passage is rendered difficult to understand because it is preceded by a missing page and starts at line 438 (Krapp and Dobbie numbering) in the middle of a sentence.\n\n…..\n\nhis lifes fæðme. Simle hit bið his lareowum hyrsum;\n\nfull oft hit eac ðæs deofles dugoð gehnægeð,\n\nðær weotena bið worn gesamnod.\n\nThe pronouns his and hit in lines 438 and 439 have no antecedants, owing to the missing page. Because light is mentioned at lines 443 and 438 and fire at line 455, it has been suggested that hit refers to either fire or light, both of which are neuter. But neither light nor fire have their own teachers, so in line 438 it seems that hit refers to a person – perhaps to a child, which is also neuter.\n\nBut if it was a child, how could it defeat the devil’s minions? This sounds more like a property of light or fire. Can fire be said to obey its teachers? Perhaps. A fire is lit, fed, kept under control and led around by the householder, just as a child is treated by its teachers.\n\nWhat can we make of ‘his lifes fæðme‘? fæðm means embrace, grasp, fist, lap, bosom, cubit, expanse. Fæðm in dative without a preposition occurs only in the plural. It is therefore likely that his lifes fæðme is in apposition to an earlier phrase which includes a preposition. So his lifes fæðme means something like ‘(within, during) his life’s expanse/embrace’. If the subject is fire, his lifes fæðme could mean the fireplace or a lamp. If it is a child, his lifes fæðme means ‘in the bosom of his family’.\n\nThe sense seems to imply a connection between the weotan in line 440 and the snottor man in line 441, because the snottor man is also a wita and where men are assembled they are likely to eat together. But the punctuation, a series of dots at the end of line 440, clearly indicates a break in the argument. I think that the scribe misunderstood the sequence and that the recovery of the morsel is an example of how light can defeat the devil when wise men gather. Otherwise, the phrase ‘where wise men are regularly assembled’ is a meaningless orphan. The circumstances in which ‘ðæs deofles dugoð’ are brought low are set out in the following lines (441-447).\n\nThe subject in most of the remainder of the passage is fire/light, except for lines 441-447, where light also plays a role.\n\nThe Dropped Morsel\n\nThe subject of lines 441 to 447 is the snottor man, taking advantage of light to find the food. Basically he drops a chip on the floor, sees it, picks it up, dips it in the guacamole and pops it in his mouth. If the snottor man picks up his own dropped food, one might wonder what is the point of ‘him sylf friteð‘? As explained by Holthausen in 1916, it was widely believed that dropped food nourished the devil. So presumably the man is said to ‘eat it himself’ because he stops the devils minions eating it (see below). Presumably picking up food off the floor and eating it wasn’t so frowned upon in the middle ages!\n\nðonne snottrum men snæd oððglideð,\n\nða he be leohte gesihð, luteð æfter,\n\ngesegnað and gesyfleð and him sylf friteð.\n\nSwilc bið seo an snæd æghwylcum men\n\nselre micle, gif heo gesegnod bið,\n\nto ðycgganne, gif he hit geðencan cann,\n\nðonne him sie seofon daga symbelgereordu.\n\nLight and Fire\n\nIn lines 448 and 449, the subject is light, but the use of the personal pronoun hit in line 450, in a context where fire is meant, shows that the poet thought of them as the same thing.\n\nLeoht hafað heow and had haliges gastes,\n\nCristes gecyndo; hit ðæt gecyðeð full oft.\n\nFrom line 450 to line 456, there is no doubt that the subject is fire. The description of the flames running up into the roof and burning the house is very dramatic.\n\nGif hit unwitan ænige hwile\n\nhealdað butan hæftum, hit ðurh hrof wædeð,\n\nbryceð and bærneð boldgetimbru,\n\nseomað steap and geap, stigeð on lenge,\n\nclymmeð on gecyndo, cunnað hwænne mote\n\nfyr on his frumsceaft on fæder geardas,\n\neft to his eðle, ðanon hit æror cuom.\n\nIn lines 457 to the end, the subject is clearly light.\n\nHit bið eallenga eorl to gesihðe,\n\nðam ðe gedælan can dryhtnes ðecelan,\n\nforðon nis nænegu gecynd cuiclifigende,\n\nne fugel ne fisc ne foldan stan,\n\nne wæteres wylm ne wudutelga,\n\nne munt ne mor ne ðes middangeard,\n\nðæt he forð ne sie fyrenes cynnes.\n\nRereading the Opening Lines\n\nReturning to the opening lines, it is highly likely, given what follows, that the hit/his in the first 3 lines is also fire/light. But it also seems to be an obedient child. How can this be?\n\nThe key to this is to read the whole passage as Saloman’s answer to a missing riddle from Saturnus. All we can safely read back into the missing passage is the riddle requires a comparison between fire or light and a child. Solomon’s other answers often continue with further observations after the question has been answered. But if we were looking for a question which required the whole of Saturn’s reply as an answer, it would read something like the following – ‘What is as meek as a child but can fight devils, destroy a house and lead us to wisdom?’ Answer: Fire. It sits at home in the lap of the fireplace and is under the control of adults. Its light in a lamp can help a wise man recover dropped food from the devil. If it gets free it will set fire to the house and try to climb back up to heaven. It is an aspect of the divine. Everyone with eyesight (dryhtnes ðecelan) can see by it and all creation is sprung from it.\n\nErrant Scholarship\n\nWhich brings me to the subject of today’s sermon – hot air, or to be exact in- and ex-sufflation. I recently paid a significant amount (well considerably more than I usually do) to download an article by Dr Paul F. Schaffner of the University of Michigan – “The Errant Morsel of Solomon and Saturn II: Liturgy, Lore, and Lexicon,” Mediaeval Studies 57 (1995): 223-57. It deals with our lines 441-447. I will give you a running commentary so you don’t have to do the same:\n\npp 223-4\n\nIntroducing the dropped morsel passage and telling us how tricky it is. Discussion of the punctuation issue at line 440.\n\np. 225\n\nTells us Holthausen’s 1916 explanation that dropped food was a boon to the devil. Which pretty much explains the so-called tricky passage. And I didn’t find this in my other readings, so I guess I got my money’s worth.\n\npp. 225-226\n\nOther examples of similar beliefs to Holthausen’s explanation.\n\npp. 226-227\n\nSuggestion that the snæd in line 393 and the snæd in line 396 are not the same. The poem says that the second morsel is ‘much better’ at line 8, but the question is – better than what? Schaffner wants us to believe that is better than the first recovered morsel, but it is obvious from the context that the poet means it is much better than a seven day feast. Apparently this nonsense was promoted by Wilde and Shippey, and “tentatively supported” by Menner and Vincenti. The reason for this brain explosion is apparently that the second, better morsel might actually be the host in the mass. But this idea was very effectively kiboshed by Holthausen because, good lord, who would dip the host in gravy? For ‘gesyfleð‘ means seasons, flavours. Game set and match to Holthausen! 5 pages into a 35 page article and we can stop here.\n\npp. 227-230\n\nBut wait. This is the argument that cannot die. The second morsel being the host is such a great idea that we can’t allow a measley bit of gravy to stand in its way. Maybe gesyfleð doesn’t mean seasoned but comes from Latin sufflare, to blow on. Not that there is any evidence of this – gesyflan is a well-attested word related to sufl, relish, stew. Phonological, etymological, all kinds of difficulties are duly noted and then ignored.\n\npp. 230-236\n\nDetailed, fascinating, and entirely irrelevant description of the punishments for a priest dropping the host.\n\npp. 236-247\n\nDetailed, fascinating, and entirely irrelevant description of the use of blowing (insufflation, exsufflation and sufflation) in various liturgical and extra-liturgical contexts, including exorcism. Including an amazing quote from Cyril of Jerusalem comparing exsufflation to a goldsmith’s purifying gold by blowing to heat the furnace. The Cyril quote is great stuff which is actually quite useful for interpreting the Boiling Blood sequence in Solomon and Saturn I, but quite off topic here.\n\np. 247\n\nPerhaps the mass is the Easter mass, then we can bring in even more interesting ecclesiatical comparisons. This is apparently even more probable because the seven day feast might be a Jewish version of the Christian eight-day Easter feast. Oh yeah.\n\npp. 247-257\n\nMore blowing.\n\np. 257\n\nThe end.\n\nIn conclusion, Schaffner tells us “we may safely add a new word [‘gesyfleð‘ = ‘sufflat‘] to the lexicon of Old English”! Poppycock. He also tells us the paper owes its inception to suggestions from Thomas D. Hill. Oh dear, for Hill’s sake I think we’ll pretend we didn’t hear that.\n\nNow in a generally favourable review of Daniel Anlezark’s recent edition of S&S in the Journal of English and Germanic Philology, [Vol. 111, No. 3 (July 2012), pp.403-406] Charles D. Wright chides Anlezark with failing to mention Shaffner’s contribution to the identification of the snæd. “Anlezark has overlooked the detailed explication of ll. 224–30 by Paul Schaffner” says Wright. I think Anlezark’s readers can rest easy on that account!\n\nI’ve been very harsh on this piece because it is not what it claims to be. It is an excellent article on the ancient and mediaeval clerical practices of sufflation, masquerading as a contribution to the understanding of Solomon and Saturn II. No amount of learning on sufflation is going to make this theory fly. It is as though Schaffner, who specialises in electronic text and resources management, is trying to crack the problem using a brute force password hack. Nevertheless, it is true that neither Krapp and Dobbie nor Anlezark mention in their notes Holthausen’s explanation as to why recovering the morsel is a setback for the devil. So I have Shaffner to thank for that at least.\n\nThe Meaning of the Missing Morsel\n\nMy argument, that the whole passage is Saloman’s answer to a missing riddle from Saturnus, successfully explains most of the difficulties of the passage. However it must be admitted that the dropped food example, as an example of light defeating the devil, is rather weak. Awareness of this weakness probably lies behind all those desperate efforts to misread the passage to see the morsel as the host.\n\nLet us look at this again and see if the snæd image is perhaps a placeholder for a deeper meaning. It is notable that the context of the gathering of wise men (if we ignore the unfortunate punctuation) appears superfluous to the surface narrative of light defeating the devil. Perhaps this is a clue.\n\nPerhaps we should view the dropped food image in the context of wisdom being exchanged, like food around a table. To drop a piece of food would then be a metaphor for missing the point of something wise said in the discussion. If a wise man realises through the operation of divine illumination that he has failed to understand something and returns to it, reconsiders it and understands it on the second attempt, this is indeed a victory against the devil and worth savouring. Understood intellectually, this is a plea for attention to detail in scholarship. And note how, in a delicious piece of self-reference, going back to the morsel passage for another look was what was required to understand its meaning.\n\nBon appetit!\n\nThe ‘weallende wulf’ passage is arguably the best part of Solomon and Saturn II (see my earlier post). But a scribal error right at the start has created confusion as to exactly who the warrior protagonist is. The passage starts with the following lines:\n\nSaturnus cuæð:\n\n“Se mæra was haten sæliðende\n\nweallende wulf, werðeodum cuð\n\nFilistina, freond Nebrondes.”\n\nNow because he was ‘haten‘, his name must be here somewhere. The traditional explanation is that his name was ‘Weallende Wulf’, ‘Raging Wolf’, making him sound like a character from Beowulf, or perhaps a Silvester Stallone movie. This is odd, because every single other character in the poem has a name which at least sounds biblical.\n\nTwo things about these lines are noteworthy. The first is that ‘weallende wulf’ could just be an epithet meaning that he was a fierce warrior – he did after all kill twenty-five dragons. The second it that the first line does not alliterate. True it has se in the first half and sæliðende in the second, but the definite article se is not a part of speech which can normally bear an alliterating stress. No problem for Grein and later scholars, they simply changed sæliðende to the synonymous merliðende and hey presto, alliteration! But the putative substitution doesn’t look like a normal scribal error. Even if the word was partly obliterated in an earlier ms. (leaving -liðende), what scribe worth his salt would supply sæ- instead of mer-, when it didn’t alliterate? For this reason, sæliðende is most likely to be original, leaving us with the alliteration problem.\n\nBut what if the scribal error isn’t in the second half of the line, but in the first? Se can’t bear alliteration if it is the definite article, but if it is the first syllable of a name it certainly can. Perhaps the person was not se mæra, but Semæra, or some similar biblical-sounding name. A quick check of my copy of Charles Randall Barnes’ “The People’s Bible Encyclopedia” comes up with one possible candidate. The eponymous first resident of Samaria was called Shemer, transliterated Semer in the Vulgate, σεμηρ (Seme:r) in the Septuagint and Samareus in Isidore (1 Kings 16, 24 – Hebrew script shows no vowels, hence the variation). A good fit with the ms. would be Semer, lifted directly from the Vulgate. Semere is less likely as it is hard to see why a form in -e would be used for either the latin -er or the -eus ending from Isidore. Semere in O.E. would mean ‘conciliator’ anyway, which is not a good name for a warrior. An alternative spelling Semær fits the ms. even better – it looks suspiciously germanic (-mær is a germanic name element), but then so does Nebrond for Nimrod (-brand being also a germanic name element).\n\nIn the Bible, Shemer was only the original owner of a hill on which the city of Samaria was built, but all the poet needed was authentic-sounding name, the more obscure the better. Scribal confusion between an unknown proper name at the start of a sentence and Se mæra, capitalised owing to position, is easy to imagine.\n\nSo this might turn out to be a classic case of the answer being hidden in plain sight! The start of the passage can be emended to read:\n\nSemær was haten sæliðende\n\nweallende wulf, werðeodum cuð\n\nFilistina, freond Nebrondes.\n\nNow we have a real Biblical name and alliteration too, with only a minor emendation. We already know the rest of the story.\n\nThe Poems and Their Performance\n\nThe poem known as Solomon and Saturn II is long and rather messy with substantial sections missing from the ms. In tone and metrical irregularity it resembles Maxims I from the Exeter Book, which is also a wisdom piece. As I have suggested in another post, Maxims I may be, like Solomon and Saturn II, a piece for two speakers. I imagine it being read aloud at a special occasion to demonstrate the learning of its authors. This is consistent with Ursula Schaefer’s invaluable Vokalität concept [Schaefer, Ursula. Vokalität: Altenglische Dichtung zwischen Mündlichkeit und Schriftlichkeit (ScriptOralia 39). Tübingen: Gunter Narr 1992]. There is evidence that a related set of satyrical poems, known as Solomon and Marculf, were read aloud on the continent at a reasonably early date. An entertainment at the northern French court of Guînes in 1194 included tales of a “Merchulfo” that Sabine Griese identifies with Marcolf. (Griese, Salomon und Markolf cited in Section 4 & footnote 19 http://d.lib.rochester.edu/teams/text/bradbury-solomon-and-marcolf-intro.)\n\nThe framing conceit for Solomon and Saturn II is a wisdom competition between King Solomon (Saloman) and a Chaldean prince by the name of Saturnus. In a different and effective twist on the normal Anglo-Saxon clerical media strategy of using Germanic poetry structures to preach christian doctrine, the legendary characters and backstory of this poem are drawn from the Old Testament. Although some excellent scholarship was required to track down most of the individual places and people in the poem, (i.a. Menner, O’Keeffe) the basic constellation and oppositions are already clearly comprehensible from the Bible. Solomon is the legendary wise King of Israel and Saturn is a pagan prince of the Chaldeans/Babylonians who were the principal adversaries of the Israelites.\n\nThe manuscript also contains another poem, Solomon and Saturn I and two prose passages, the Prose Solomon and Saturn and the Pater Noster Solomon and Saturn, all spoken by the same characters. A short metrical passage appears between one of the prose passages and the start of Solomon and Saturn II, but it actually seems to be an ending to that poem.\n\nThe Role and Character of Saturnus\n\nIn the prose works, Saturnus does little more than ask set-up questions for Saloman, rather like Question Time in Westminster Parliaments. In the poem Solomon and Saturn I, his character is filled out more – he is presented as a traveller and seeker after spiritual knowledge. But his dramatic role is still simply that of respectful questioner. His love of books is charmingly expressed in Solomon and Saturn I\n\n…. Mec ðæs on worolde full oft\n\nfyrwit frineð, fus gewiteð,\n\nmod gemengeð. Nænig manna wat,\n\nhæleða under hefenum, hu min hige dreogeð,\n\nbysig æfter bocum; hwilum me bryne stigeð,\n\nhige heortan neah hædre wealleð.\n\nIn Solomon and Saturn II we learn more of his background, character and travels and his statements and questions are marked by gravitas and intelligence. As Daniel Anlezark says, the tone of the debate is “learned and friendly” (note to S&SII l. 352) Nevertheless Saloman seems reluctant to engage in a battle of wits with Saturn and has issues with the Chaldeans. After a missing page where Saturnus’ challenge to a wisdom contest is presumably issued, Saloman accepts the challenge to avoid the risk that Saturnus will claim to have beaten him if he refuses:\n\n….. oððe ic swigie,\n\nnyttes hycgge, ðeah ic no sprece.\n\nWat ic ðonne, gif ðu gewitest on Wendelsæ\n\nofer Coforflod cyððe secean,\n\nðæt ðu wille gilpan ðæt ðu hæbbe gumena bearn\n\nforcumen and forcyððed.\n\nHe gets in a swipe at the attempt by the Chaldeans to build the Tower of Babel:\n\nWat ic ðæt wæron Caldeas\n\nguðe ðæs gielpne and ðæs goldwlonce,\n\nmærða ðæs modige, ðær to ðam moning gelomp\n\nsuð ymbe Sanere feld.\n\nAnd again\n\nWa bið ðonne ðissum modgum monnum, ðam ðe her nu mid mane lengest\n\nlifiað on ðisse lænan gesceafte. Ieo ðæt ðine leode gecyðdon;\n\nwunnon hie wið dryhtnes miehtum, forðon hie ðæt worc ne gedegdon.\n\nNe sceall ic ðe hwæðre, broðor, abelgan; ðu eart swiðe bittres cynnes,\n\neorre eormenstrynde. Ne beyrn ðu in ða inwitgecyndo!\n\nThe first rebuke doesn’t amount to much and would be considered complementary in epic poetry, for the sin reproved is that of pride. The second, while clearly a reproach, is softened with ne sceall ic ðe hwæðre, broðor, abelgan. Both fall within the traditional parameters of flyting. Rather than the picture of “representative of eastern error” painted by some recent commentators, it resembles the carefully worded verbal sallies of the post-detente Cold War. For the Chaldeans are the same people as the Babylonians, the enemies par excellence of the Israelites. They will later take the Israelites into captivity and be threatened with divine retribution in the form of total destruction in Jeremiah books 50 and 51.\n\nWhile they are not mentioned in any of the texts, the figures of the Magi in the Gospel of Matthew seem likely to be a model for the figure of Saturnus. Just as these wise men of the East are portrayed positively in the Gospel, so is Saturnus portrayed as knowledgeable and a genuine seeker after spiritual knowledge. The name Magi originally referred to a Zoroastrian (Persian) priestly caste, but the legendary Magi of the Gospel were said to be from different kingdoms and one of them, Balthasar, was a Babylonian.\n\nAs such Saloman stands for the positives of pre-christian civilisation. Treatment of pre-christian virtue this must have been a thorny subject for the formerly pagan Anglo-Saxons. So much is clear from conversion accounts in Bede, where pagans are presented as eager to adopt the new and superior christian religion and the emphasis on the harrowing of hell, where Christ saves virtuous prechristians, in accounts of the resurrection. More broadly, the respect for ancient pagan science in the form of natural history, geography, medicine and astronomy is a constant feature of medieval christian learning, even before the revival of interest in Aristotle.\n\nIt is instructive that the most “heroic” section of the poem, the ‘weallende wulf’ story, is spoken by Saturnus. Saloman’s rather dismissive reply can be seen as a reflection of the Church’s ambivalent attitude to such still popular material.\n\nThe Philosophy of Saturnus\n\nUnlike the stooge character in the prose dialogues, Saturnus in Solomon and Saturn II has some good lines and asks some pretty good questions. He describes a mighty warrior and his doomed battle against a invasion of dragons from hell. He asks Solomon for the truth about something which has been tormenting him for years – the monster ‘vasa mortis’, which is destined to destroy his race. He asks a couple of standard riddles which Solomon correctly answers (old age and books). His best questions seem thematically related to classical physics and are about weather, fortune and fate. He recites a gnomic formula linking them:\n\nNieht bið wedera ðiestrost, ned bið wyrda heardost,\n\nsorg bið swarost byrðen, slæp bið deaðe gelicost\n\nIn fact they are such good questions that Saloman’s answers, while often excellent, sometimes avoid the issue (more later) or fall flat. Here is a list of his best questions:\n\nWhy must we have winter? ll. 319-325 The answer is missing, perhaps an analogy of the resurrection.\n\nWhat causes a doomed man to die? ll. 353-355 A lead-in for the excellent answer – gewurdene wyrda, ðæt beoð ða feowere fæges rapas – ‘destinies come to pass’.\n\nWhy doesn’t the sun shine in deep valleys and moors? ll. 365-369 Saloman makes this an analogy for unequal fortune. His answer, referring to poor clerics and the rewards in heaven, is evasive. See discussion below.\n\nWhy does sorrow disturb our happiness? ll. 375-378 Saloman’s answer that a person who complains constantly is useless and sins against God is presumably an evocation of the virtue of patience.\n\nWhy do evil people have long lives? ll. 390-393 Answer – they will be damned in the end and that is all that matters.\n\nWhy do children of the same mother turn out so different? ll. 397-405 The answer to this surprisingly modern-sounding nature or nurture question – a mother has no control over how her children turn out – points to innate character.\n\nWhy don’t young people pursue virtue? ll. 423-426 The answer seems irrelevant, but is actually quite good. It is easy for a lucky person to choose a gentle lord, a wretch has no such choice. This again refers to innate character.\n\nWhy is water never still? ll. 432-437 Answer missing. The question seems to introduce a discussion on elements in the missing page. Solomon’s next remarks relate to light and fire.\n\nWhich is stronger, fate or foresight? ll. 464-475 Good question and a good answer. Fate is hard to turn, but may be governed with wisdom and good advice.\n\nWhy does fate cause so many problems in the world? ll. 484-491 The classic question of the origin of evil. Answer – the devil is behind it.\n\nWhy do we have to live out our full life span before facing judgement? ll. 519-524 Answer – angels and devils must contend for our soul.\n\nThe unifying theme running through these questions is determinism v free will, issues which come up in both Augustine and Boethius and which, in the form of wyrd, fascinated the Anglo-Saxons. The unanswered questions regarding winter and water reveal an interest in physics, some schools of which were deterministic.\n\nHidden Meanings and Evasions\n\nThe following sequence contains a series of cryptic and seemingly unanswered questions. Starting from line 359:\n\nSaturnus cwæð:\n\n“Ac hwa demeð ðonne dryhtne Criste\n\non domes dæge, ðonne he demeð eallum gesceaftum?”\n\nSalomon cwæð:\n\n“Hwa dear ðonne dryhtne deman, ðe us of duste geworhte,\n\nnergend of niehtes wunde? Ac sæge me hwæt nærende wæron.”\n\nSaturnus cwæð:\n\n“Ac forhwon ne mot seo sunne side gesceafte\n\nscire geondscinan? Forhwam besceadeð heo\n\nmuntas and moras and monige ec\n\nweste stowa? Hu geweorðeð ðæt?”\n\nThe answer to the fairly banale question: who will judge Christ? is: who would dare judge the one who created him? The meaning of the second line ‘saviour (who made us) from the wound of night’ is rather opaque. Kemble thought it made no sense and amended wunde to sunde, ‘ocean’, but an error of ‘w’ for ‘s’ is unlikely. Menner suggested wambe, ‘womb’, which is subject to similar objections. It is indeed so difficult to find a satisfactory alternative to the ms. reading of wunde that it may well be original.\n\nThe second half of the line ends with a riddling question – Ac sæge me hwæt nærende wæron? – which doesn’t receive an answer, or so it seems.\n\nThere is some doubt as to the meaning of the question. B-T doesn’t know what nærende means, while Clarke Hall follows Grein’s translation of ‘not being’, which would normally be næsende. Menner emends to næren ðe (for næron ðe), to obtain substantially the same meaning as Clarke Hall with a more plausible emendation. If Menner is right, then this would be a very Eleatic riddle indeed: tell me what were not, which were.\n\nO’Keeffe follows an idea of Menner while rejecting his ‘interpretative frame’ of a riddle. She surmises that the answer could be the tenebrae, shadows, from the creation story in Genesis, which ‘were’ over the face of the water. She refers to the work of Fridugisus of Tours, De nihilo et tenebris (translation here), for a contemporary argument as to the existence of shadows. This context would explain the plural, the past tense and also the mysterious earlier niehtes wunde, sustained when it was separated from light. Saturnus’ next utterance, which is a question, brilliantly conceals the answer to the previous question, because the subject of his question is – shadows! But not only that, it is itself something which is and is not – it both is and is not an answer. But while O’Keeffe is almost certainly right about the answer and its source she is wrong to completely reject Menner’s interpretive frame. This is indeed a riddle and a most delicious and complex one at that.\n\nIt is also significant that here we have two seemingly unanswered questions in a row – Saloman’s question about non-beings and Saturnus’s question about places the sun doesn’t reach. Unless we are dealing with more copying errors, it looks like there is some deliberate avoidance going on here. Perhaps the arguments about day and night, light and shade, were regarded as controversial material which could only be alluded to in a manuscript for public performance, but which would be understood by initiates. In fact, given the theologically vexed nature of the question of predestination v. free will (in e.g. Augustine), perhaps it is understandable why Saloman’s replies are sometimes evasive. If this is Question Time, the answers are bound to sometimes resemble the empty mouthings of a Minister!\n\nPostscript on Post-Structuralism\n\nI have been reading Catherine O’Brien O’Keeffe’s article ‘Source, Method, Theory, Practice: On Reading Two Old English Verse Texts’ (available here – warning, not for the faint-hearted!). This piece is a very effective defence of ‘source studies’ in Old English from attacks by Derridean deconstructionists, using their own post-modernist constructs, so the argument is necessarily turgid. But there is no doubt as to the brilliance of O’Keeffe’s scholarship and I must confess that, as a sometime computer programmer, I find her recursive data structure of arcane metanarratives to be a thing of beauty!\n\nThe passage in Solomon and Saturn I where the Paternoster is used to heat the blood has received varying interpretations. Editors either read the passage as describing the effect of the prayer on the devil’s blood (Krapp & Dobbie, Anlezark) or on the blood of a wizard (Kemble). In this piece I suggest a reading where the blood being heated is that of the person reciting the prayer.\n\nRelevant passage lines 43-48 (MS A)\n\n1. Swylce ðu miht mid ðy beorhtan gebede blod onhætan,\n\n2. ðæs deofles dry, þæt him dropan stigað,\n\n3. swate geswiðed, seofan intingum\n\n4. egesfullicran ðonne seo ærene gripu,\n\n5. ðonne heo for XII fyra tydernessum\n\n6. ofer gleda gripe gifrust wealleð.\n\nFor completeness, the variant readings in MS B are:\n\n2. ðæs deofles dream, þæt him dropan stigað,\n\n3. swate geswiðed, sefan intingan\n\n4. egesfullicra ðonne seo ærene gripu,\n\nThese variant readings have been assessed and I have resolved to ignore them. Dream makes no sense, and sefan intingan (a matter of the mind) is not sufficiently strong an image for the context. In no case do they offer a simpler reading and the B MS is much later and less reliable than MS A.\n\nBelow is a translation of the lines from MS A. As can be seen, there are three possibilities for line 2, giving 3 different objects for the heating effects of the prayer.\n\n1: So you might with the bright prayer heat the blood\n\n2:\n\n– gore( or dross) of the devil so that in him (him = devil) drops rise (requires amendment dry to dreor, or dros)\n\n(NB: can’t use dry = drige here because if the devil’s blood is dry, not just dry of something, the drops won’t rise.)\n\n– of the devil’s wizard (dry = dat.) so that in him (him = wizard) drops rise\n\n– dry (dry for drige, neut. acc.) (i.e. his own blood) of the devil (remove the devil from the blood) so that its (him = blood) drops rise. (blod drige onhætan takes genitive of separation or want)\n\n3: made more potent (i.e. rising drops) by sweat and the seven petitions (i.e. of the PN)\n\n4: more terrible (i.e. rising drops) than the brass cauldron\n\n5: when it for 12 generations of men\n\n6: above the grip of flames most greedily boils\n\nThere are 3 scenarios, according to whose blood is being heated.\n\nA. Devil’s blood:\n\n1: So you might with the bright prayer heat the blood,\n\n2: the devil’s gore, so that in him (devil) the drops (of blood) rise\n\nB. Saturn’s own blood:\n\n1: So you might with the bright prayer heat the blood (Saturn’s)\n\n2: dry (i.e. blood) of the devil so that its (blood) drops rise\n\nC. Wizard’s blood:\n\n1: So you might with the bright prayer heat the blood\n\n2: of the devil’s sorcerer (dry = dat.) so that in him (sorceror) drops (of blood) rise\n\nAlthough plausible, scenario A can be rejected on the grounds that it requires departure from the MS by substitution of a word (dreor or dros for dry).\n\nScenario C has the advantage of using the exact word and spelling in MS A. However the sudden introduction of a wizard here seems incongruous.\n\nScenario B requires only a minor spelling assumption (dry = drige). Moreover, it has the advantage of fitting with the subsequent question asked by Saturn, which refer to purification of the spirit by heat and Saturn’s burning, welling enthusiasm for learning.\n\nAc hulic is se organ ingemyndum\n\nto begonganne ðam ðe his gast wile\n\nmeltan wið morðre, mergan of sorge,\n\nasceadan of scyldum? Huru him scippend geaf\n\nwuldorlicne wlite. Mec ðæs on worolde full oft\n\nfyrwit frineð, fus gewiteð,\n\nmod gemengeð. Nænig manna wat,\n\nhæleða under hefenum, hu min hige dreogeð, (dreoseð)\n\nbysig æfter bocum; hwilum me bryne stigeð,\n\nhige heortan neah hædre* wealleð.\n\nThe parallels are indeed striking. For this reason, it is more probable that the blood being heated is Saturn’s. (* See ‘Postscript on hædre’ below)\n\nSuggested Translation:\n\nSo you might with the bright prayer boil the devil from your blood so that its drops rise, forced by sweat and by the seven petitions of the PN, bubbling more terribly than the brass cauldron which for 12 generations of men boils greedily above the grasping flames.\n\nPostscript on hædre:\n\nManuscript A has hædre, MS B has hearde. Hædre (also hadre) normally means ‘clearly’, ‘brightly’ – it comes from hador, which is German heiter. Hearde means ‘hard’ (adv).\n\nThe only other occurrence of this word is in the phrase hædre gehogode from Resignation l. 63 (Exeter Book).\n\ngeoca þonne,\n\nmihtig dryhten, minre sawle,\n\ngefreoþa hyre ond gefeorma hy, fæder moncynnes,\n\nhædre gehogode, hæl, ece god,\n\nmeotod meahtum swiþ.\n\nThe meaning of this phrase is unclear. If gehogode is p. part, then by virtue of the -e ending it cannot qualify the preceding reference to God. The ending could be f. acc. sing. and, as hælan takes a direct object, hædre gehogode must refer to sawol. Because it needs to be healed or saved (hæl), it has been felt that the context requires hædre gehogode to have a negative meaning and it has been read ‘oppressed by anxious thoughts’ (B-T). But neither hogian nor gehycgan, which have gehogod as p. part., are semantically the sort of verb to have a passive p. part., only an active p. part. (mostly used in perfective constructions with ‘have’). So gehogode must mean something like ‘having intended’, ‘having planned’, ‘minded’. In this case, hædre might mean ‘brightly or clearly’, perhaps in the sense of ‘with clear intentions’. Alternatively, it can be read as the dative of the noun hador, ‘bright sky’, perhaps ‘heaven’, and the phrase as meaning ‘resolved on heaven’. Still rather obscure, I must say.\n\nDaniel P. O’Donnell, in his excellent article “Hædre and hædre gehogode (Solomon and Saturn, Line 62B, and Resignation, Line 63A).” [N&Q 46 (1999), 312-16] makes a strong case against the meanings of ‘anxiously’, ‘oppressively’ ascribed to hædre in Resignation and Solomon and Saturn. Still he insists on prefering the Solomon and Saturn MS A reading of hædre, over MS B’s hearde because MS A is older and generally better. Up to this point I must agree with the man. The meaning of ‘brightly’ contested for by O’Donnell (“my mind wells brightly near the heart”) does not fit the meaning of hædre and does not work in the context of boiling. But is there another possible reading for hædre?\n\nI recently obtained a copy of “Prognostics An Edition and Study of Texts from London, British Library, MS Cotton Tiberius A. iii”, Liuzzi ed., 2010 Brewer. This fascinating edition of Anglo-Saxon Prognostics, texts for predicting the future from dreams, events and dates, contains a significant sample of general non-poetic late O.E. vocabulary, mostly in the (semantically reliable) form of glosses. A significant number of these texts have not been previously published and so are not found in the Bosworth-Toller or Clarke Hall dictionaries. Checking Liuzzi’s glossary, I immediately noticed an entry hadlað for adlað ‘ails’. This supports a reading by Krapp and Dobbie of hadl for adl in Maxims I l. 117, in a passage I have previously examined. Interestingly enough, this is not the only example of h-insertion in the Prognostics texts. We find:\n\nhadlað for adlað\n\nhamacgað for amagiað\n\nhærende for ærend\n\nhearmas for earmas\n\nheðhylde for eðhylde\n\nhyfele for yfel\n\nIt seems that h-insertion may have been more common in O.E. than is apparent from the standard grammars. Accordingly I would propose that hædre in Solomon and Saturn I line 67 should be read as a variant of ædre, artery, German Ader.But how then is the sentence to be construed? If hædre is the subject of wealleð, where does that leave hige? It is best read as in apposition to bryne. Reading hædre as artery gives a much better sense:\n\nNænig manna wat,\n\nhæleða under hefenum, hu min hige dreogeð,\n\nbysig æfter bocum; hwilum me bryne stigeð,\n\nhige heortan neah hædre wealleð.\n\nLoosely translated:\n\n” No man knows\n\nNo human under heaven, how my head strains\n\nBusy after books; at times a burning rises in me\n\na feeling near the heart, my bloodstream foams.”\n\nAh, now there was someone who really understood the thrill of scholarship!"
