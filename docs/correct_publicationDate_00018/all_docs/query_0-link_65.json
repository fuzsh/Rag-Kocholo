        "text": "COMPOUND MURDER\n\nCompound Murder by Bill Crider (2013)\n\nDan Rhodes has had to face a lot during his long career as sheriff of Blacklin County, Texas: emus, wild hogs, and mammoths, not to mention various local politicians, his dispatcher, his jailer, Seepy Benton and the sometimes strange people of his county, including various killers. And in his twentieth full-length outing, it just keeps coming.\n\nAs the book opens, Rhodes is in the midst of distrusting a bottle of Mr. PiBB, a most unsatisfactory substitute for his beloved Dr. Pepper, which is no longer being made with real sugar. Shortly after the unopened bottle is (once again) placed in the refrigerator, Rhodes is called out to the local beauty salon to investigate the theft of a number of wigs and extensions. There is a good black market for these items (in Texas, anyway; not so much in southern Maryland where I live); the wig theft comes on top of a rash of copper thefts from unattended buildings and pickup truck gate thefts (also popular items on the black market). Rhodes' morning goes further downhill with the report of a dead body at the local community college.\n\nThe dead body belongs to Earl Wellington, an unpopular English teacher at the college. Wellington's head had been bashed in on the corner of a parking lot dumpster early on the morning. A few minutes after Rhodes arrives, a car comes screaming out of the parking lot and speeds away. Rhodes gives chase for several miles before whoever was fleeing runs off the road and crashed into some trees. In the car is Ike Terrell, a young student who had been accused by the dead teacher of plagiarism. Also in the car are the stolen wigs.\n\nTerrill is the son of Able Terrill, a man who distrusts anything to do with the government and who has not left his isolated, fenced-in compound for years. No one is sure how many people are holed up in the compound and stories about Able and his stash of weapons have been circulating the county. Hack and Lawson, Rhodes' dispatcher and jailer, begin to draw comparisons to the John Wayne movie Rio Bravo.\n\nIke is not the only suspect in the murder. It turns out that there are suspects to spare, both from the compound and from the college itself.\n\nBefore the case is over, Rhodes is sent to a widow's home to wrestle a wild hog which isn't; Rhodes adopts another animal for his menagerie (this one with a truly noble name); copper thieves shoot at him; and Rhodes breaks (perhaps bends) his diet as usual.\n\nDan Rhodes is one of the most likable characters in mystery fiction and the Rhodes books are among the most satisfying. Bill Crider has continually been able to make Rhodes' small-town Texas an important point on the fictional crime map.\n\nEntertaining. Satisfying. Highly recommended.\n\nFORGOTTEN BOOK: BEST BLACK MAGIC STORIES\n\nBest Black Magic Stories, edited by John Keir Cross (1960)\n\nOnce upon a time British publisher Faber released a number of themed series anthologies. Mystery writer Edmund Crispin compiled their SF anthologies in Best Science Fiction (Numbers One through Seven), Crispin also did Best Detective Stories, One and Two for Faber. Brian Aldiss did Best Fantasy Stories; Dick Francis and John Welcome did a brief series of Best Racing and Chasing Stories, and -- in addition to the book being discussed today -- John Keir Cross edited Faber's\n\nBest Horror Stories One and Two.\n\nBest Black Magic Stories, per the editor's introduction, provides examples of \"the practice of those occult sciences which profess to invoke the aid of evil spirits or to make a compact with the Devil.\" Many of these thirteen examples are fairly well-known, well-anthologized stories in the horror field, but all are worth approaching for the first or the umpteenth time.\n\nThe stories:\n\n\"The Earlier Service\" by Margaret Irwin. A haunting and \"devilish\" (hehehe) tale that has been reprinted at least eleven times in major anthologies.\n\n\"The Lady on the Grey\" by John Collier. A sardonic \"Fancy,\" or perhaps, a \"Goodnight,\" wherein the Devil has the last laugh.\n\n\"A Room in Leyden\" by Richard Barham. This one first appeared in Barham's pseudonymous 1831 collection The Ingoldsby Legends, as by \"Thomas Ingoldsby, Esquire,\" where it was titled (and usually reprinted as) \"A Singular Passage in the Life of the Late Henry Harris, Doctor of Divinity.\" A typical and interesting example of the interest in the supernatural in the Nineteenth Century.\n\n\"Mothering Sunday\" by John Keir Cross. Apparently original to this volume and \"a rather oblique kind of white magic.\"\n\n\"The Snake\" by Dennis Wheatley. This may be Wheatley's most reprinted short story and the very first short story he ever wrote. Wheatley based this one on the true-life Major Weir, reputed to be a powerful wizard in East Scotland; Weir was finally executed at Gallowhill in 1670.\n\n\"The Hill\" by R. Ellis Roberts. A 1923 story that shows time and space have no bounds when it comes to black magic.\n\n\"Casting the Runes\" by M. R James. A classic. And still chilling.\n\n\"More Spinned Against...\" by John Wyndham. A light-hearted look at the subject.\n\n\"The Haunted and the Haunters\" by Lord Lytton. A classic ghost story that is bordering on being a chestnut, and (as the editor states) has been \"anthologized ad nauseum,\" often reprinted under the title \"The House and the Brain.\" Cross, however, also felt that it qualified as a black magic story. First published about 165 years ago, it has not lost it's power.\n\n\"Homecoming\" by Ray Bradbury. One of Bradbury's stories about the charming and very weird Elliott family.\n\n\"Couching at the Door\" by D. K. Broster. Another effective tale. This one has scared me ever since I read it in an old Alfred Hitchcock anthology.\n\n\"A Way of Thinking\" by Theodore Sturgeon. Sturgeon and voodoo dolls...need I say more?\n\nand, finally,\n\n\"The Black Mass\" by Joris-Karl Huysmans. A chapter extracted from Huysmans' novel La Bas.\n\nA good selection and a good read.\n\n**********\n\nToday's Forgotten Books links are being collected by Evan Lewis at Davy Crockett's Almanck of Mystery, Adventure and the Wild West. Check it out.\n\nINCOMING\n\n\"Alan Burt Akers\" (Kenneth Bulmer), Manhounds of Antares. SF, #6 in the Dray Prescott series.\n\n[anonymously edited], Prom Dates from Hell. Paranormal romance anthology with five stories, including one by Stephanie (Twilight) Meyer.\n\nSteve Alten, Meg: Primal Waters. Big shark thriller.\n\nPaul Ashdown & Edward Caudill, The Mosby Myth: A Confederate Hero in Life and Legend. Nonfiction, the life and lore of \"The Gray Ghost.\"\n\nMike Ashley, editor - Historical Whodunits. Themed mystery anthology with 23 stories. In a previous life the book was titled The Mammoth Book of Historical Whodunits.\n\nAmelia Atwater-Rhodes, The Shapeshifters: The Kiesha'ra of the Den of Shadows. Omnibus of five YA fantasies containing Hawksong, Snakecharm, Falcondance, Wolfery, and Wyvernhail.\n\nDavid Balducci, Deliver Us from Evil. Thriller.\n\nDave Barry & Ridley Pearson, Science Fair. YA thriller.\n\nJosh Bazell, Beat the Reaper. Comic crime thriller.\n\n\"M. C. Beaton\" (Marion Chesney) - Death of a Bore, Death of a Celebrity, and Death of a Poison Pen. Hamish Macbeth mysteries.\n\nPatricia Briggs, Blood Bound. A Mercy Thompson, the shapeshifting mechanic, fantasy.\n\nLee Child, editor, First Thrills. Thriller anthology with 25 stories from the International Thriller Writers, Inc.\n\nClive Cussler & Paul Kemprecos, Fire Ice. A Kurt Austin adventure. I consider Cussler an okay writer, but I just love Paul Kemprecos.\n\nRichard Deming, Women: The New Criminals. Nonfiction from a writer best known for his pulp and paperback work.\n\nMichael Dibdin, Thanksgiving. Novel.\n\nJohn Drake, Flint and Silver. Adventure, a prequel to R. L. Stevenson's Treasure Island.\n\nDiane Duane, Star Trek: Spock's World and X-Men: Empire's End. Tie-in novels.\n\nAlan Durant, editor, Vampire Stories. YA horror anthology with 18 stories and extracts.\n\nJohn Farris, You Don't Scare Me. Horror.\n\nRicky Gervais & Stephen Merchant, The Office, The Scripts: Season 2. Scripts from the six-episode second season of the British comedy.\n\nWilliam Gibson & Bruce Sterling, The Difference Engine. Steampunk.\n\nMaurice Girodias, editor, The New Olympian Reader. Anthology of 26 representative pieces published by Olympia Press in the 1960s, including extracts from Barry N. Malzberg's first two novels. Malzberg (who helped edit the book)provides an introduction and Girondias gives us a lengthy afterward. It's all pretty daring stuff for its time, I guess.\n\nNeil Gaiman, Angels & Visitations. A miscellany of stories, articles, reviews, poetry and whatnot from the fabulous Mr. G. This, his first collection, contains 23 items.\n\nPete Hamill, The Guns of Heaven. Thriller.\n\nVirginia Hamilton, Her Stories: African American Folktales, Fairy Tales, and True Tales. YA winner of both the Coretta Scott King Award and the Laura Ingalls Wilder Award. Illustrated by the Dillons.\n\nPatricia Highsmith, Nothing That Meets the Eye: The Uncollected Stories of Patricia Highsmith. Twenty-eight stories dating from 1938 through 1982 from the queen of moral ambiguity.\n\nAnaldur Indridason, Operation Napoleon. Thriller translated from the Icelandic by Victoria Cribb.\n\nStuart M. Kaminsky, Midnight Pass and Vengeance. Lew Fonesca mysteries.\n\nC. S. Lewis, Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold. Fantasy, the story of Cupid and Psyche.\n\nAdrian McKinty, Dead I Well May Be. Crime by one of the bright new lights in the field.\n\nKathleen Norris, Mystery House. Mystery, one of those cheap hardbound reprints from Triangle Books in the early 1940s, complete with a rather wistful dust jacket. This is the \"story on which the nation-wide radio program is based.\" Something I did not know.\n\nAndre Norton & Jean Rabe, editors, Renaissance Faire. Fantasy anthology with 15 stories.\n\n\"Flann O'Brien\" (Brian O Nuallain), The Third Policeman. The classic crime/fantasy/literary novel. Some people got pretty excited when this book was shown during a scene in one of the early seasons of Lost, hoping that it prefigured some of what was to come on that series.\n\nGeorge Pelecanos, editor, D. C. Noir. Crime anthology with 16 D.C.-centric tales. Will Akashic Books ever run out of locations for these themed anthologies, or will we eventually see something titled Frostbite Falls Noir?\n\n\"Ellis Peters\" (Edith Pargeter) - Rainbow's End. An Inspector Felse mystery.\n\nIan Rankin, Resurrection Men. An Inspector Rebus mystery.\n\nChris Roberson, X-Men: The Return. Comic book tie-in novel.\n\nSpider & Jeanne Robinson, Starseed. SF, sequel to Stardance.\n\nJonathan Strahan, editor, Best Short Novels 2007. Eight short novels, published by The Science Fiction Book Club, who figured they didn't need to put the words \"Science Fiction\" or \"SF\" in the title because that would just confuse everyone.\n\nMarc Sumerak & Chris Kipiniak, Marvel Adventures Spiderman: Identity Crisis. Graphic novel collecting issues 37-40 of Marvel Adventures Spiderman. Art by Ale Garza, David Nakayama, and Ryan Stegman.\n\nStith Thompson, The Folktale. Nonfiction.\n\nIrving Wallace, Amy Wallace, David Wallechinsky, & Sylvia Wallace, The Intimate Sex Lives of Famous People. Dirty little secrets and not-so-secret tales of several hundred well-known people. Some interesting anecdotes here. BTW, the Wallaces basically put their names on the book which was mostly edited and written by a large staff.\n\nJess Walter, Over Tumbled Graves. Mystery.\n\nGlenn Yeffith, editor, Seven Seasons of Buffy: Science Fiction and Fantasy Writer Discuss Their Favorite Television Show. Twenty-two essays.\n\nRECOMMENDED BOOKS, 1949-1953\n\nI mention in yesterday's post that The Eureka Years ended with a representative sample of book reviews written jointly by Anthony Boucher and Mick McComas.

In any given year there are a few standouts, but 1953 brought us more than a few -- even some of the minor novels in any other year could reasonably be considered great. Novels by Bester, Brown, Clarke, Leiber, Moore, Sturgeon, and Wyndham -- few years were better than this one.\n\nThere you have it. The best books in the genre for 1949-1953. Some may be tarnished by age, but most hold up remarkably well. A lot of good reading here for both the avid fan and the curious.\n\nFORGOTTEN BOOK: THE EUREKA YEARS\n\nThe Eureka Years: Boucher and McComas's Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction 1949-1954, edited by Annette Peltz McComas* (1982)\n\n* (Yeah, I'm pretty sure this book has already been covered as a FFB [most likely by Todd Mason, but I'm too lazy a sod to go back and check -- Update: it was Bill Crider, another man of taste and distinction]. But it's too good a book not to cover again.)\n\nIt took four years to get it off the ground and then several issues to determine if it was viable, but the Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction (as it was soon to be known) remains, nearly sixty-five years later, a vital part of the SF scene. Patented on the successful formula of Ellery Queen's Mystery Magazine, The Magazine of Fantasy and Horror (as it was first envisioned and subtitled \"a magazine of weird and fantastic stories\") was to be a literate and engaging publication reflecting the two erudite co-editors, Anthony Boucher and J. Francis \"Mick\" McComas. The word Horror was soon replaced by Terror, then to be dropped altogether by the time the first issue of The Magazine of Fantasy hit the newsstands in 1949 as a planned quarterly publication. By the time the second issue came out it was The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction and thus it remained all these many years.\n\nThe Eureka Years tells of the early times when McComas and Boucher were co-editors of the magazine, before McComas left and Boucher became the sole editor. The two were truly equals in this venture; joint editorial decisions were mandated -- both had to approve of a story if it was to be included in the magazine. Both strived heavily to make a story the best it could be -- making suggestions, requesting revisions, and guiding the author to improve his or her story. They were blunt in explaining how a submission was not working; at the same time they were encouraging and supportive of the authors, both the seasoned professionals and the amateurs who dreamed of making it into print.\n\nHere are twenty-two stories from those early year, along with samples of editorial correspondence with the authors (and others), as well as some ephemera and poems and features from the magazine. Capping the book off is thirty-seven pages of excerpts from the magazine's Recommended Reading department, where both Boucher and McComas display their unique and sometimes playful critical vision.\n\nAnd what stories!\n\nThe Hurkle Is a Happy Beast by Theodore Sturgeon\n\nThe Exiles by Ray Bradbury\n\nMinister Without Portfolio by Mildred Clingerman\n\nElephas Frumenti by L. Sprague de Camp & Fletcher Pratt\n\nCome O, Wagon by Zenna Henderson\n\nOf Time and Third Avenue by Alfred Bester\n\nDress of White Silk by Richard Matheson\n\nThe Boy Next Door by Chad Oliver\n\nNot With a Bang by Damon Knight\n\nO Ugly Bird! by Manly Wade Wellman\n\nSkiametric Morphology and Behaviorism of Ganymedeus Sapiens by Kenneth R. Deardorf\n\nLetters to the Editor by Ron Goulart\n\nThe Other Inauguration by Anthony Boucher\n\nWhen Half-Gods Go by Poul Anderson\n\nThe Little Movement by Philip K. Dick\n\nFlies by Isaac Asimov\n\nThe Devil and Simon Flagg by Arthur Porges\n\nBrave New Word by J. Francis McComas\n\nMousetrap by Ande Norton\n\nCat by R. Bretnor\n\nThe Clingerman and Henderson are \"first\" stories and are indicative of the editors' efforts to bring female writers into the field. The Goulart and Oliver are also first stories (although, due to the vagarities of publishing, the Oliver was not his first published story) and show the editors' keen eye for young blood. Here also we have the first Gavagan's Bar story from de Camp and Pratt, the first Silver John story from Wellman, as well as the first People story from Henderson.\n\nAnd the correspondence! Some samples:\n\nMcComas to Bradbury (on \"The Exiles\"): \"Bierce is completely incredible. Can you imagine 'Bitter' Bierce saying, 'What will happen to us? God save us?' Rather, he would chortle gleefully over the dilemma and enjoy with complete detachment the futilities of both the invaders and the exiles...[nd later] You are, for Ray Bradbury, amazingly inaccurate about Hawthorne.\"\n\nBradbury responds: \"Sorry about THE EXILES. You're right about Bierce and Hawthorne. Put it down to the fact that I've never been a research man in my life, preferring to manufacture my fantasies out of whole cloth.\"\n\nAnd Boucher to Barthold \"Flos\" [Fles] (on Clingerman's \"Minister Without Portfolio\"): \"...it doesn't come off well as it might. A rather slow introduction and it could be cut about in half. And the ending doesn't seem quite right -- a little too blunt for one thing...Can't make any guarantees until we see how she handles the rewrite; but I'd say the chances were pretty good that we might turn her into beautiful but published.\" [Fles had described her as a \"beautiful but unpublished girl.\"]\n\nBoucher to Wellman (on \"O Ugly Bird!\"): \"...Are silver strings practical and feasible on a guitar? If your are positive, we'll take your word; if you have any doubts, we'd like to consult Ted Sturgeon, who knows all about guitars.\"\n\nWellman replied: \"Your letter on how to do the yarn over arrived late Saturday, and I just bowed my neck and did the thing over...Answering your question about the silver strings, I went into that before ever I wrote. Silver strings were used before steel strings became good enough. Silver makes a good harmonious jangle...\"\n\nBoucher to Norton (on \"Mousetrap\"): \"...nice idea, greatly told, but one thing bothers us. How on earth (or Mars) does Sam know about the puffball action.. I don't see how it can be abstractly deduced...And just incidentally, how come it is Andre and not Andree or Andrea? It's been bothering me ever since I learned your sex.\"\n\nNorton to Boucher: \"...I can very easily put in a puff-ball discovery for Sam. Think I know just where to insert it and how...As to \"Andre\" -- just a properly ambiguous either sex name to be worn by a female who makes a living writing male adventure stories -- it can be a problem with readers unless one works behind such a smoke screen -- especially when one writes for teen age boys.\"\n\nAnd from a rejection letter to a would-be author: \"The trouble is you're trying to hard. You're too intent on showing off...\"\n\nAnd another: \"...if this magazine has a tabu -- it's one violently against stories wherein the protagonist is dead all the time and doesn't know it! We get about 5 such a week.\"\n\nAnd to an agent: \"...after reading this, A.B. coined the proverb: One man's turd is another man's turquoise. This disgusting little piece of scatology is definitely not our turquoise. McC\"\n\nAnd from the Recommended Reading department, October 1953, come this incisive review: \"Ayn Rand's ANTHEM (Caxton) is also a thesis-novel (or rather a short novelet), using the over-worked them of individual-revolt-against-future-regimented-state to advance the notion that brotherly love and social obligation are a poison and that man's only hope lies in complete selfishness. The story was published in England in 1938, and Miss Rand implies that a sinister conspiracy of purveyors of brotherhood has prevented its American hardcover publication until now. One can only regret that the conspiracy broke down.\"\n\nThe Eureka Years is a pure delight.\n\nINCOMING\n\nMichael Barson, editor, Flywheel, Shyster and Flywheel: The Lost Marx Brothers Radio Show.

J. Smith, the Vampire Twin books by Janice Harrell, and teen thrillers from M. C. Summer, Kate Daniel, Bebe Faas Rice...and movies such as Scream were on the immediate horizon. In short, the market was there and the publishers were going to fill it. Fast-moving, by-the-numbers books were what was required and the writers responded.\n\nI don't know if Ed Gorman wrote any other YA thrillers (his wife, Carol, has written several interesting ones), but The Killer, while not transcending the genre, has a number of interesting things to recommend it. The ins and outs of a small Midwest town and the lasting effects of jealousy and ambition, the silent caste system of the haves and the have-nots, sexual obsession that can start as early as the sixth grade and bloom horribly in later years, that each of us have both good and bad in us, as well as the power to save or be redeemed...all of these are fields that Gorman has mined in many of his works.\n\nKarle Fletcher is a pretty high school student who has found herself in a social limbo since she has started dating Jordan Vedder, an asocial rebel who father is pushing him to go to West Point. For weeks now, Karle has been getting disturbing and anonymous messages about Jordan. Mike Conrad, football star and jealous bully, has it out for Jordan, as does a sadistic cop named Hennessy.\n\nKarle stops by Jordan's house one evening to pick him up for a library study date only to fond his house in darkness. She hears a noise from within the house and sees a figure in black running from the house. The door, which should have been locked, was not. Inside, Karle discovers the body of Jordan's father, a knife in his chest. Behind a desk, bloodied, was Jordan; in the room was a video camera on which his father had taped a violent argument with his son earlier that day. Jordan, fearing arrest, runs. Loyal Karle follows.\n\nSuddenly the two are the objects of a massive manhunt with Hennessey dogging their trail, hoping to be the one to find them so he can find an excuse to kill Jordan. Can Karle and Jordan find the killer in time?\n\nThere are secrets, and twists and turns, and a surprise ending all tied up in a satisfying bow. Gorman excels at nuanced characters and his talents are well on display here. The Killer is not as polished as many of Ed Gorman's novels and short stories but it is a slam-bang novel designed to please its YA audience.\n\nHAPPY BIRTHDAY, JESSAMYN!\n\nBack not that many years ago, Kitty got a job offer to be a sky marshal. The very same day, we learned that she was pregnant with our first child. Baby trumps sky marshal job any day. Which brings us to Jessamyn, the most beautiful baby in the history of the world until then and the girl who has given us so much joy and a few gray hairs.\n\nJessie was a happy baby. She did -- and still does -- bring joy and light to the world. Love and pride are words not strong enough to describe our feelings for her.\n\nShe was one of the first babies(maybe the first) in our area to be born using the Lamaze method and the OB nurses were not happy with that. Almost everything about that night has been pushed to the background of my memory because of the one thing that stands shining out from that experience, the one thing I will never forget, no matter how long I live. At the moment of birth, the doctor told Kitty that it was a girl. And Kitty said, \"A girl.\" Just two words. Two simple words. It was the way she said it, the tone of her voice, something that I have been at a loss to describe over the passing years. I have never heard a human being use that voice, either before or since. Kitty's voice encapsulated pure joy and radiance, a sense of completeness, a feeling of perfectness -- for her, for me, for the baby, for the universe. I pray that each person can hear that tone, that voice, if only once in his or her life, so that each person can experience love and awe taken to its utmost human limit.\n\nI know how very fortunate we are to have Jessie and how fortunate we are to have her two beautiful daughters as our grandchildren. If the only heritage we leave behind is our children, then Kitty and I have done very well.\n\nIf possible, we love you more today than on the very first day we met you, Jessie.\n\nHave a fantastic birthday!\n\nOVERLOOKED FOOTAGE AND TV: HAPPY BIRTHDAY, ANNIE OAKLEY!\n\nHard to believe, but this little gal is 153 years old today:\n\nhttp://archive.org/details/AnnieOakley\n\n(Even harder to believe is that this footage is 120 years old!)\n\nFor people of my generation, though, Annie looks exactly like pig-tailed and fringed-clothed actress Gail Davis. The syndicated television show Annie Oakley ran for 81 episodes from 1954 to 1957. Annie and her little brother Tagg live in the small western town of Diablo, where in between platonic courtin' and sparkin' with deputy Lofty Craig she scares off all sorts of owlhoots with her shootin'.\n\nAnnie's horse is Target; her brother's horse is Pixie -- which raises serious questions about Tagg. (And who the heck names a kid Tagg, anyway? It's not like he was a Palin.) Tagg is played by Jimmy Hawkins who was George Bailey's young child Tommy in It's a Wonderful Life and had a fairly active career as a child actor. He was about twelve years old when he began hanging out around Diablo; the series ended when Hawkins had a growth spurt. Annie's boyfriend Lofty Craig has one of those truly inspired geological names like Boggy Marsh or Stony Creek. Lofty was played by Brad Johnson, who played \"Student\" in 1951's Bedtime for Bonzo and went on to appear in a swarth of television westerns in the 50s and early 60s. Stuntman Bob (not the reporter) Woodward appeared in over half the episodes, usually as Stagecoach Driver/Townsman/Lynch Mob Member/Henchman/Posse Member/somebody typically named Ed or Pete or Bill or Woody or Jim or Hank or Vic or Al or Joey or Bart. I wonder if kids watching ever got confused with this dude who seemed to have so many names? Probably not.\n\nQuite a few well-known actors appeared on the show, including Slim Pickens, X Brands, Roscoe Ates, Alan Hale, Jr., Fess Parker, Denver Pyle, L. Q. Jones, James Best, Lyle Talbot, and Lee van Cleef.\n\nGail Davis began her career when she was 22 and soon graduated to westerns starring such icons of the oater as Roy Rogers, Rocky Lane, Monte Hall, Jimmy Wakely, Charles Starrett, and Johnny Mack Brown. Her super-big break, however, came when she starred with Gene Autry in 1949's Sons of New Mexico. She and Autry became long-time lovers and he placed her in a number of his movies and television projects, including Annie Oakley, which he produced. She appeared in multiple episodes of The Range Rider, The Cisco Kid, The Lone Ranger, The Adventures of Kit Carson, Death Valley Days, and (naturally) The Gene Autry Show. In 1959 she had an uncredited appearance as Annie Oakley in the Bob Hope vehicle Alias Jesse James. She was posthumously inducted into the National Cowgirl Museum and Hall of Fame.\n\nThe clip below is episode three of the show's first season and aired on January 23, 1954. It was directed by Frank McDonald and written by Jack Townley. And, yes, Bob Woodward was credited as \"Posse Member.\"\n\nhttp://archive.org/details/AnnieOakley-Gunplay\n\nOh. By the way, the real Annie never slept with Gene Autry.\n\nFORGOTTEN BOOKS: SEARCHING FOR JACK VANCE\n\nToday is Jack Vance Day on Friday's Forgotten Books. Because I am a slacker, I'm not reviewing any of Vance's books today. What you should do is head over to In Reference to Murder, B.V. Lawson's fantastic blog, where she will be curating this week's links. (Patti Abbott will return to her grindstone next week.) Anyway, that's where you will find about a zillion links to reviews of Jack Vance books and stories -- as well as of other books that caught the eyes of your faithful FFBers.\n\nBut let's get back to Vance, who is not being reviewed by me. For those unfamiliar with the man and his work, Jack Vance (a.k.a. John Holbrook Vance, Peter Held, Alan Wade, John Van See, John Holbrook, and occasionally Ellery Queen) was, IMHO, perhaps the greatest stylist since Avram Davidson. He's won Hugo Awards and a Nebula for his science fiction, a World Fantasy Award. the Jupiter Award, an Edgar for his mystery fiction, and the admiration of readers everywhere. A Science Fiction Grand Master and a winner of the World Fantasy Life Achievement Award, Vance passed away this past May at age 96. For those unfamiliar with his work, get off the stick and start reading!\n\nAnd to help you start reading, here's some stories available free on the web:\n\nAt unz.org:\n\n\"Hard Luck Diggings\" (Startling Stories, July 1948) *\n\n\"Sonatoris Shortcut\" (Startling Stories, September 1948) *\n\n\"New Bodies for Old\" (Thrilling Wonder Stories, August 1950)\n\nThe Five Gold Bands (Startling Stories, November 1950)\n\n\"Overlords of Maxus\" (Thrilling Wonder Stories, February 1951)\n\n\"The Masquerade on Dicantropus\" (Starling Stories, September 1951)\n\n\"The Plagian Siphon\" (Thrilling Wonder Stories, October 1951)\n\n\"Abercrombie Station\" (Thrilling Wonder Stories, February 1952) **\n\n\"Sabotage on Sulfur Planet\" (Startling Stories, June 1952)\n\n\"Chowell's Chickens\" (Thrilling Wonder Stories, August 1952) **\n\nBig Planet (Startling Stories, September 1952)\n\n\"The Kokold Warriors\" (Thrilling Wonder, October 1952) *\n\n\"Three-Legged Joe\" (Startling Stories, January 1953)\n\nThe Houses of Iszm (Startling Stories, March 1954) ***\n\n* Magnus Ridolph stories\n\n** \"Abercrombie Station\" and \"Chowell's Chickens\" were combined to form the novel Monsters in Orbit (1965)\n\n*** The Ace Books edition (1964) adds about 8,000 words\n\nAt Internet Archive:\n\n\"Winner Lose All\" (Galaxy Science Fiction, December 1951)\n\n\"Ulward's Retreat\" (Galaxy Science Fiction, December 1958)\n\nAt Project Gutenberg:\n\n\"Sjambak\" (If, July 1953)\n\nAt Baen Books *:\n\n\"Liane the Wayfarer\" (Worlds Beyond, December 1950) * *\n\n* included in The World Turned Upside-Down, edited by David Drake, James Baen, and Eric Flint (Baen Books, 2006)\n\n** a Dying Earth story\n\nAnd, in audio in two parts at StarShipSofa.com (#272. #273):\n\n\"The Moon Moth\" (Galaxy Science Fiction, August 1961)\n\nAlso, Vance's Edgar-winning novel, Man in a Cage, was filmed in 1963as an episode of Boris Karloff's Thriller and is available on Youtube. The radio show Dimension X aired an adaptation of \"The Potters of Firsk\" (from Astounding Science Fiction, May 1950), available at Internet Archive. In 1953 Vance wrote two episodes of Captain video and His Video Rangers (\"Black Planet Academy\" and \"Adventure on Phobus\"); if these are available on the internet I have not been able to find them. Can anybody help?\n\nMy discussion of Vance's Bad Ronald (both the book and the 1974 television movie) was published on this blog on May 31.\n\nHere's an interview with Vance that was hosted by Mike Hodel on Hour 25 on November 12, 1976:\n\nhttp://archive.org/details/ATalkWithJackVance1976flv\n\nAnd, finally, Vance with ukulele and kazoo!\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiOt6eW0pZI\n\n96 years. A life well lived."
