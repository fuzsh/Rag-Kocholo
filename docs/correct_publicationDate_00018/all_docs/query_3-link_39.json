        "text": "Cherry Tree Books was in most respects, just another of the many 6d paperback series started in the years following Penguin’s launch in 1935. The whole paperback publishing industry was desperately trying to work out how to respond to the revolution that Penguin had unleashed, and the basic strategy was to copy them. So the first Cherry Tree Books published in 1937 were the same size as Penguin Books and the same price, had standard designed covers and a dustwrapper in the same design as the cover. At least they didn’t choose another bird as their series name / logo, but the choice of a tree was barely more imaginative.\n\nSo what was different about them? In the first place they didn’t come from a normal book publisher, but from a newspaper group, Allied Newspapers, which had its roots in the publishing business of Edward Hulton and was later renamed Kemsley Newspapers. At various times the group owned papers such as the Daily Sketch, the Manchester Evening Chronicle and the Sunday Times, and its printing works at Withy Grove in Manchester printed the northern editions of many of the national newspapers. The building has now been redeveloped as the Printworks Entertainment Centre.\n\nThe early books were shown as published by Allied Newspapers and printed by the Withy Grove Press, but soon the newspaper reference was dropped and Withy Grove Press shown as the Publisher. The first few books also carried a sort of manifesto for the series, which was perhaps consciously trying to distinguish them from Penguins and disassociate themselves from any literary pretensions.\n\nTheir books, it was claimed, were chosen by ‘a man in the street’ who ‘likes a good yarn’. ‘I might have paid a big fee to a famous star in the literary firmament to choose my titles for me’ writes the series editor in one version, ‘… but this was not our policy’. This sounds like creating a straw man to knock down, as it’s not clear that any of his rivals were doing this either, but the intent seems plain. The series was not meant to be literary or highbrow, although it’s interesting that one of the first three titles was by Arnold Bennett, about as big a star as there was in the literary firmament at that time. It also seems ironic, if not deliberate, that the word ‘firmament’ was mis-spelled.\n\nThe initial cover design, which was not very inspired and not very distinctive, lasted for only the first thirteen titles, published between June and November 1937. It exists in two colour variants, with most titles in the green and black design shown above, but at least two romantic novels in the light and dark blue combination illustrated below.\n\nFrom the beginning of 1938 a much more distinctive design is adopted, with the title in a coloured rectangle against a predominantly black background with a representation of a cherry tree in blossom. For the first few books, possibly only numbers 14 to 22, the rectangle is in green, but after that it’s red and this becomes the very recognisable design that is maintained for more or less the rest of the series, through to 1950.\n\nThe list of titles in this period is dominated by crime novels and generally by authors well-known at the time such as Edgar Wallace, P.C. Wren, Bruce Graeme and .John G. Brandon. The series though had reached only about 50 titles when war broke out in 1939, and from the beginning of 1940 (volume 61 onwards) in common with other paperback publishers, they abandoned the use of dustwrappers on paperbacks. Gradually the books became thinner, the type smaller and more cramped, as wartime economy measures began to bite.\n\nIt’s noticeable though that the series managed to maintain a substantial publishing programme throughout the war, more so than many other publishers. This may have been because as a newspaper group they had better access to rationed paper than pure book publishers. Even so, the list of around 50 books published in 1940 gradually fell to around 10 to 15 by 1943 and didn’t really come back up much from this level even after the war. The price also increased to 9d at the end of 1942 and adverts started to appear on the back cover, changes that applied to other paperback series around the same time as well.\n\nFrom 1940 onwards, the series also published war-related non-fiction titles, including notably the ‘Sunday Times’ Diary of the War series, to which Allied Newspapers had access as publisher of the ‘Sunday Times’. Each of these books covered 6 months of the war, and they continued to appear at six-monthly intervals right through to ‘The Twelfth Six Months’ published in September 1945."
