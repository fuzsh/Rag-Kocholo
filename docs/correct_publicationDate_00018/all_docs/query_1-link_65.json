        "text": "I decided to do a deep dive to see where I could find Saturn in the bible and found some interesting things.\n\nAnd they shall no more offer their sacrifices unto devils, after whom they have gone a whoring. This shall be a statute for ever unto them throughout their generations. — Leviticus 17:7.\n\nThe word devil is translated as Satyr and pronounced in a manner that even sounds like Saturn.\n\nAnd he (Jeroboam) ordained him priests for the high places, and for the devils (Satyr) , and for the calves which he had made. — 2 Chron 11:15\n\nBut ye have borne the tabernacle of your Moloch and Chiun (Rephan) your images, the star of your god, which ye made to yourselves. — Amos 5:26\n\nRephan or Chiun represent the star-god Saturn or Moloch according to Nelson’s Bible Dictionary.\n\nThe pagan worship of Saturn was the name originally given to the Babylonian Ruler (Nimrod), who was known as the god of Chaldean Mysteries. The name Saturn in Chaldee is pronounced Satur, but in Aramaic it is spelled as Stur. When you add up the numerical value of “Stur” you get 666.\n\nHere is wisdom. Let him that hath understanding count the number of the beast: for it is the number of a man; and his number is Six hundred threescore and six. — Revelation 13:18\n\nThis all adds up to a pretty direct connection between the planet Saturn and the number of the beast. The six pointed star could very well be the image of the beast. If Jupiter can be striped and pierced with a seemingly random spot and Saturn can have a hexagon on top of its pole it cannot be random, but designed.\n\nSaturday Sabbath\n\nDealing with the Saturday Sabbath will be a longer post to prove out, but I will have you consider the following verses.\n\nYe who are approaching the evil day (Day of YHVH), who are drawing near and adopting false sabbaths. Amos 6 (Brentons Septuagint Translation)\n\nTherefore now shall they depart into captivity from the dominion of princes (they shall be taken from the role of princes), and the neighing of horses shall be cut off from Ephraim. (The cry of horse men shall cut off Ephraim?)\n\nThen Elohim turned, and gave them up to the worship of the host of heaven (stars)… Yea, ye took up the tabernacle of Moloch, and the star (day) of your god Remphan, figures which ye made to worship them: and I will carry you away beyond Babylon. — Acts 7:43\n\nBring no more vain oblations; incense is an abomination unto me; the new moons and sabbaths, the calling of assemblies, I cannot away with; it is iniquity, even the solemn meeting. — Isaiah 1:13\n\nFinally He saith to them; Your new moons and your Sabbaths I cannot\n\naway with. Ye see what is His meaning ; it is not your present\n\nSabbaths that are acceptable [unto Me], but the Sabbath which I have\n\nmade, in the which, when I have set all things at rest, I will make\n\nthe beginning of the eighth day which is the beginning of another\n\nworld. — Barnabas 15:8\n\nThe Fall of Babylon\n\nAs I was studying Saturn I came across the following verse from Daniel regarding the Fall of Babylon.\n\nIn the same hour came forth fingers of a man’s hand, and wrote over against the candlestick upon the plaister of the wall of the king’s palace: and the king saw the part of the hand that wrote.\n\nWe know the the 7 churches had 7 stars and 7 candlesticks and that these are related.\n\nThus says YeHoVaH: “Heaven is My throne, And earth is My footstool”. — Isaiah 66:1\n\nYHVH’s palace or throne is the heavens or space. So we could imagine a parallel where writing on the wall against the stars.\n\nThen the fingers of the hand were sent from Him, and this writing was written.“And this is the inscription that was written:\n\nMENE, MENE, TEKEL, UPHARSIN.\n\nThis is the interpretation of the message:\n\nMENE: God has numbered the days of your kingdom and put an end to it;\n\nBabylon has a finite time and it is coming to an end.\n\nTEKEL: You have been weighed in the balances, and found wanting;\n\nThis is the black horse with the scales.\n\nPERES: Your kingdom has been divided, and given to the Medes and Persians.\n\nAnd the great city was divided into three parts, and the cities of the nations fell. — Revelation 16:19\n\nThen commanded Belshazzar, and they clothed Daniel with scarlet, and put a chain of gold about his neck, and made a proclamation concerning him, that he should be the third ruler in the kingdom.\n\nBabylon the Great is divided into 3 parts, while Babylon was divided into the Medes and Persians… but Daniel was made the 3rd ruler thus 3 parts.\n\nIn that night was Belshazzar the king of the Chaldeans slain.” — Daniel 5:25–30\n\nThe very night the writing was on the wall is when Babylon fell. This is something we should consider for those who think that the sign in the stars might only a warning and not the date of the event.\n\nFour “Literal” The Horseman\n\nI was studying the four horsemen and I noticed that there are literally 4 horsemen in the sign compared to just symbolic “scales” or “twins”.\n\nAnd I beheld, and lo a black horse; and he that sat on him had a pair of balances in his hand. — Revelation 6:5\n\nThe horse-man is the constellation Centaurus and on top of him is the scales of Libra.\n\norse number 2, the red horse mars, is in fact represented by one member of two twins who were known as two famous horsemen and there is indeed a unicorn horse under them in the stars. And the white horseman with the bow needs no explanation.\n\nOnce again, if you haven’t seen my video about the Wonders in Heaven on October 9th, 2024 then you need to check out this video. It will go into much more of the significance and other parts of the sign not covered in this post."
