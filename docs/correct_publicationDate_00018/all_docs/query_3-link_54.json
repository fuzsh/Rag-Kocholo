        "text": "To AI or not to AI...\n\nAI is here, and it's not going away. There's a tremendous amount of anxiety in the community of creatives, from artists to writers and musicians who are afraid it will harm their industry and craft. With 35 years background in computers and 15 years as a professional columnist for the same industry, as well as ten years in the self-publishing business, I have a different take on AI. It's probably controversial, but the reality is that AI is here, and it's not going away, so now what?\n\nMy Line Editing Journey with ChatGPT\n\nMany people have controversial thoughts when it comes to using generative AI for creative writing. And it really depends on your use-case. If you’re asked to write an essay on oranges for a school assignment and instructed to not use AI/online tools, then using ChatGPT to write the whole thing for you is violation of the homework policy.\n\nIf someone asks ChatGPT to write a book for them. Well… the tool is not quite there yet to write a quality fiction book for you. And if someone publishes that book without a TREMENDOUS amount of editing, then I don’t think it’d become a best seller anytime soon.\n\nHowever, it can be used as an editing companion, and it doesn’t always magically spit out the best version of a sentence/paragraph you want in the first go. And here’s a glimpse at my conversation with ChatGPT to come up with just the right words for 1 of the paragraphs I was editing this week.\n\nAnything Can Happen\n\nOne of the things I like about reading science fiction and fantasy is that you never know how things might turn out. What’s different about F&SF, as opposed to what we might call mainstream or mundane stories, is that at the end the world can be radically different from what it was at the beginning.\n\nWhen it's time to revisit book #1 in your series\n\nBook #1 in your series is the most important for hooking new readers. But when you wrote it, it was your first book, and it wasn't as good then as it would be now – and it's not as well-written as the later books in the series. Now what? How to you market book #1 as the introduction to the series when it's not your best book? The answer: it's time to think about a second edition.\n\nAll the Write Reasons\n\nBefore the Gutenberg Press, if some Geoffrey Chaucer or Sappho wrote a book, he or she had to be otherwise employed… or independently wealthy. The telling of stories to their immediate circle of peers wouldn’t have been their bread and butter, but just an amusement. And I suppose we are all–writers and non-writers alike–still trying to do this, even today.\n\nWhat is Passive Voice? And is it Always Bad?\n\nI’ve been a user of Critique Circle long enough to see certain pieces of advice crop up again and again. Long-time critiquers cite them as rules across multiple submissions. New users pick them up and begin to spread the same advice to others. But sometimes rules are cited as absolutes without regard for subtleties. Sometimes we find ourselves following the letter of the law but neglecting its spirit.\n\nWriting & Depression\n\nI waited up until midnight on the first night and I ended up knocking out 2,271 words. For a first day that is fantastic. I should be incredibly proud of myself, but I'm not. I'm not angry at myself nor am I frustrated with my lack progress, I'm just meh. You read that right. I'm just meh about my writing (I asked several of my online writing buddies for a legitimate word for the feeling \"meh\" and they came up with \"lethargic\" and \"indifferent\"). It's a very odd feeling to have about a hobby that you love dearly.\n\nWhy YA Authors Should Spend Less Time in Bookstores\n\nI have a confession: I don't read much YA fiction off the shelf.\n\nMy writing colleagues are surprised when I tell them that. They're convinced I've broken a cardinal rule of the business. I have to read the all new stuff every year, they say, or I won't know what agents are buying.\n\nIn most categories that's true ? but YA is a very different animal, and the usual rules have less relevance.\n\nThis blog post was originally published on Critique Circle in the year 2012\n\nWords - The Writer's Building Blocks\n\nThe most basic element of writing construction is word choice. For the writer to convey his meaning to the reader he must choose his words carefully and use them accurately.\n\nThis blog post was originally published on Critique Circle in the year 2016\n\nHow Full-Time House Sitting Has Impacted My Writing\n\nIn the past few years, house-sitting has become a popular way to have a low-cost vacation, which could easily be reconfigured into a writer’s retreat of sorts. If you are lucky enough to have the flexibility to house-sit it full-time, it can offer an affordable lifestyle that gives one more control of their time. Obvious perks such as devoting more of the day to writing, and the inspiration that travel provides, are only the beginning. You might also learn a lot about yourself as a writer.\n\nAre You a Good Hooker?\n\nA writer's learning curve is like the earth's horizon, it never ends, and that's a good thing. Finding ways to improve a novel's opening line, its 'hook', is something every author continuously works on.\n\nGreat authors make it look easy, but writers know better. Who knew, back when I was a virgin reader, that my favorite authors spent minutes, sometimes hours, thinking about the words and flow of a single sentence? Writing well requires a lot of 'moving parts'. No matter where you are on the journey.\n\nThis blog post was originally published on Critique Circle in the year 2012\n\nA Conflict of Critiques\n\nOne critter says Yea, another says Nay. Now what are you supposed to do with that kind of advice?\n\n*Disclaimer: While I give paraphrased and reframed examples of comments I’ve gotten on my stories, none of my critters are at risk of being singled out—I always delete my work after it's been through the queues.\n\nThe Inhuman Protagonist\n\nThe key to writing fascinating, engaging animal characters lies in learning everything you can about the species you?re writing for. Any story focused on an animal is already asking a lot of the reader?s willing suspension of disbelief, so don?t stretch that further by getting things wrong that you could just as easily get right. Know their biology, social behavior, natural habitats, etc. Become an expert on the animal, so that when you write you can slip into its point of view like a separate skin.\n\nThe Past Progressive Pit of Doom (republished)\n\nIt was snowing outside, but with nowhere to go I was staying indoors. I was writing. Poorly, it turns out because while I was looking for joy, I was finding only despair. I was using too many past progressives.\n\nThis blog post was originally published on Critique Circle in the year 2020\n\nWriting for your mental health\n\nWe all got into writing for different reasons. This was written for those of us who got into it for your mental health. Whether it be to escape, to vent, or maybe just a way to express how you really feel inside. For some of us with depression, it can help you cope. But you are not defined by your depression. I repeat, YOU ARE NOT DEFINED BY YOUR DEPRESSION.\n\nHow to Make $50,000 a Year as a Novelist\n\nI can hear you all falling about, reading that title. “$50,000 a year? You must be joking! Yet amazingly, I’ve just spent the last two months in the (virtual) company of several novelists who are doing just that. How they’ve done it is a revelation, and I think it’s a revelation every would-be author needs to have.\n\nWrite With Your Gut\n\nIf I may be so arrogant as to paraphrase a line from one of my own stories: My guts are not smarter than my brains, but they are wiser (and my heart is a moron who long ago lost its right to an equal vote in the committee).\n\nWhy A Modern Fiction Writer Should Read Philosophical Dialogues\n\nIt's not likely that many of us spend much time reading Plato. But if you are serious about writing quality fiction, you should take the time to learn from great writers of philosophical dialogue. Here are three ways reading philosophical dialogue can improve your writing.\n\nSelf publishing\n\nThe market for self-published books is booming. Of the fifty top-selling Amazon eBooks as of February 22, 2022 at 9:00pm (and yes, the list is updated hourly,) 19 are self-published. Another 11 are published by Amazon in-house imprints Montlake, Lake Union, and Thomas & Mercer. Just 20 are from traditional publishers like Penguin or Harper Collins. KDPRocket reports that the best-selling of the indie books (The Rake, by L.J. Shen) has $418,471 in monthly ebook sales, and the last of the indie books (The Plains of Laramie by C.J. Petit) has $42,093 in monthly ebook sales. Each book is also available in softcover formats, as well, so the total is actually higher.\n\nPlots from Image: Incognito Visitor\n\nAn image can evoke an array of responses based on the viewer's personal life experiences. While a snowy scene of wolves chasing a young buffalo may trigger discomfort for some, others may find striking beauty in the cycle of life. Writers, however, apply imagination to before and after events until a story results.\n\nThe Darkest Reflections\n\nThe best sort of hero/villain throw downs are those in which the villain, using his power, abilities, origin, personality, or some combination of the four, provides a direct contrast to the hero. He is the hero gone wrong, the hero who is sent off the deep end.\n\nA Milestone year\n\n2021 was quite a ride. In November, with the launch of Perilous Gambit, the Mike Stoneman Thriller series is officially a series. I know, you can be a series at three books, and four is a nice number, but getting to five (5) books makes it a legitimate series. Plus, there’s a story arc that threads through these five books and reaches a conclusion (or at least a milestone) with this story. There is a sense of completion.\n\nShow-Don't Tell, Must We?\n\nI had always thought writers were individualists, and I'm sure most of them still are. This makes it all the harder for me to understand how a doctrine that is deeply prohibitive in nature could have assumed the status of a religious doctrine in a relatively short time.\n\nWriting Magic in Fantasy books\n\nFantasy worlds are defined by different races, history, conflicts and events, characters that move our stories forward, but also, magic. Magic is one of the things that separates your world from a regular medieval setting. It defines and shapes what you've created, and it also allows your characters, your mages, wizards, warriors, regular citizens, to interact with the surroundings in a unique and interesting way.\n\nBacking Up Isn’t Sexy…But Neither Is Losing Your Work\n\nI know the subject of backing up is terrible. It isn’t actually about making your writing better. It’s a technical voodoo most writers tend to ignore. Those who mention backing up find others saying something like, “I should do this more often. I haven’t backed up in a month.”\n\nI was taught to back up when I started writing by an IT professional named Chrys Thorsen. How good is she? Chrys is a network administrator and network security expert for the White House in Washington D.C. I’m about to pass what she taught on to you. I’ll start with my own back up story.\n\nNew story system\n\nWe are in the process of replacing the story system, which is the living heart of CC, so it's a bit nerve wrecking. You might have seen a preview of this in the last hook weekend but now we are about to roll it out site-wide.\n\nI need some brave volunteers to help me test this. Let me know in the comments if you want to help.\n\nYou Are Not Your Story\n\nThere are a lot of stories out there that never make it past the first draft. Not because they’re no good – but because the author is having an identity crisis. If you’re afraid of submitting for critique, this article will suggest one of the reasons why you might be having that hesitation, and encourage you to see the situation from a different viewpoint.\n\nFear\n\nWhat are you afraid of?\n\nThis question came up in regards to writing during a recent chat between a handful of authors. The group was diverse, yet the discussion brought out a bevy of similarities. Some perceived themselves as frauds, fearing public exposure of their inability to write. Another worried making a mistake in their personal writing process—skipping a step in plotting for example—will lead to a complete failure. I considered these, but didn’t feel that pull in my gut. Then someone voiced my biggest fear.\n\nEffective Storytelling\n\nAnyone who has finished a novel knows there’s a lot more to creative writing than snappy dialogue, evocative scenes, and rip-roaring action. Even if your characters could walk right off the pages into real life, your novel goes nowhere without a compelling story. I believe the number one job of any author is to tell a good story."
