An up-and-coming rock musician when they first met, Simon has been clinging to dreams of fame even as the possibility of it has grown dimmer, and now that his band might finally be on the brink again, he wants to go on the road, leaving Stella behind. But when she falls into a coma on the eve of his departure, he has to make a choice between stardom and his wife—and when she wakes a different person, with an incredible artistic talent of her own, the two of them must examine what it is that they really want.\n\nUnapologetically honest and intimately written, With or Without You is a contemporary story of what happens to relationships as the people in them change, whether slowly or in one cataclysmic swoop.\n\n​\n\n\"What I like best about Caroline Leavitt's books is her fearlessness with plots...something she can pull off before breakfast.\"\n\nNPR Here and Now, The Weekly Reader\n\n​\n\n\"In the hands of another writer, like Amy Sohn or Emma Straub, these bougie New York types might have been subject to a touch of satire. But Leavitt is not an ironist. She takes her characters and their troubles very seriously, more like Celeste Ng or Joshua Henkin. But there’s also a splash of near-magical realism, when Stella returns from her coma with a gift of creativity and insight that verges on the superhuman. A little touch of Alice Hoffman or Elizabeth Berg, you could say what I like best about Leavitt — her signature, perhaps — is her fearlessness with plot. I’ll take a good coma story with a miracle recovery anytime.\"\n\nMarion Winik Minneapolis Star Tribune\n\n​\n\n\"Heavy, beautiful, hopeful.\" ABC Good Morning PA, Amy Impellizzeri\n\n​\n\n\"At this particular time, when the earth is constantly shifting under one's feet, there is a thrill in picking up a book that distracts from the anxieties of day-to-day life; that thrill becomes meaningful when the book also deals with sudden change and how individuals can be transformed by catastrophe into something better. Ms Leavitt's talent for recognizing the beauty in the mundane--as well as her ability to craft characters with tenderness and empathy--means that the paths Stella, Simon and Libby take feel true to their stories, even when those paths lead to surprising places.\" Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, Wendeline O. Wright\n\n​\n\n\"Think Sleeping Beauty, but with a coma and a middle-age sort-of love triangle. In Leavitt’s propulsive novel, a highly responsible nurse, Stella, falls into a coma while her longtime partner Simon, a rock ’n’ roll has-been, and Libby, her best friend and one of her doctors, develop an intense bond. When Stella recovers, the equilibrium and dynamics of these relationships are recalibrated, and avoiding easy endings, Leavitt generously finds paths for this trio of characters, each bearing childhood wounds, and imagines a world in which each finds a different sort of fulfillment — and not necessarily the one they were seeking. \"-\n\nFIVE HOT BOOKS, The National Book Review, Elizabeth Taylor\n\n​\n\nWith or Without You” is ultimately about how we turn catastrophe and regret into something transformative, and we can’t help rooting for these characters to finally find the fulfillment that so eludes them.\" The San Francisco Chronicle\n\n\"Leavitt has a happy knack for making an unusual circumstance believable and her characters flawed, which is to say, they quickly become people we care about.\" Washington Independent Review of Books\n\n\\\\\n\n\"With or Without You” is one of this fall’s most compelling page-turners and possesses an intricate and involving plot that lives up to its fresh premise.\" Karin Gillespie, By the Book, Augusta Chronicle\n\n\"Leavitt has crafted an irresistible portrait of midlife ennui and the magic of breaking free.\" People Magazine, The Best New Books\n\n​​\n\n\"Old secrets, healed wounds and surprising futures.

It's a moving story with characters you can't help but care for, especially Stella, who must builds a new life after her brush with death.\" AARP\n\n​\n\n\"A redemption tale anchored in a medical chronicle, threaded with the finest filaments of magical realism. Starting from a point of stasis, Leavitt pushes her characters toward profound personal change. In the chaos of 2020, the story of a coma patient and her bereft life partner has an unexpected lightness. Its release is perfectly timed for backyard reading during a global pandemic.\" Jennifer Levin, the Santa Fe New Mexican Pasatiempo\n\n​\n\n\"A captivating and beautiful novel. Engaging, emotional and even joyous.\" Ellen Meister, Long Island Woman\n\n​\n\n\"...a poignant, instantly compelling novel about love, change and the power of timing....

With or Without You asks the great question of what happens to a long-loving couple if one of them changes utterly. This novel gives us high drama while keeping the fairest possible view of the messy lives of these characters. Another triumph for Caroline Leavitt.”\n\nJoan Silber, National Book Critic Circle award winner, Improvement\n\n​\n\n\"A wonderful novel about life as mess and disappointment, life as catastrophe and regret, but also life as transformation and resilience. Leavitt’s characters are great company, and watching them find a way forward in their suddenly altered worlds is a joy. Deeply engaging, tense but hopeful, and completely recommended – Karen Joy Fowler, New York Times Bestselling author of We Are All Completely Beside Ourselves, Shortlisted for the 2014 Man Booker Prize, Winner of the 2014 PEN/Faulkner Award\n\n​\n\n\"In With or Without You, Caroline Leavitt once again explores disaster's aftermath and its affect on the lives of ordinary people tethered by love and shared history. What makes this novel so poignant, and also makes it feel so true, is that there is no going back. There is only now, the newness of their altered realities and the courage to continue.”\n\nHelen Schulman, internationally bestselling author of This Beautiful Life and Come With Me\n\n“After all of their lives are irrevocably altered by a single tragic incident, Stella, Simon, and Libby--the major characters in Caroline Leavitt’s compelling, deeply moving new novel--are forced to make complex choices between freedom and responsibility, love and loyalty. Leavitt depicts her characters without judgment, and by doing so compels readers to ask themselves what they might do in such difficult moments.” Ron Rash, Pen Faulkner finalist, New York Times Bestselling author of The Risen\n\n​​\n\n“With or Without You is a compulsively readable novel of artistic ambition and the various betrayals lovers and friends both endure and inflict on each other. It also asks fascinating questions about the stability of the self and our capacity – perhaps even our secret desire? – to reinvent ourselves. Caroline Leavitt is a born storyteller, and this is one knockout of a story.” --- Christopher Castellani, author of Leading Men\n\n“When I started reading Caroline Leavitt's gorgeously written page-turner, With or Without You, I felt like I were falling in love: flushed, fascinated, filled with hope, fear and joy. Leavitt's exploration of the many ways in which we change over the course of a lifetime—and how we keep or lose those we love throughout these mutations—is compassionate, profound and moving. Beyond being utterly captivated, I felt like I had grown wiser and more humane after reading this beautiful novel.”\n\nJean Kwok, New York Times bestselling author of Girl in Translation and Searching for Sylvie Lee\n\n​\n\nNot only does Caroline Leavitt write like an angel, in WITH OR WITHOUT YOU, she has come up with a plot that is both wildly original and which rings ancient bells about the the way life’s most awful surprises sometimes coming bearing the greatest of gifts. Stella, a nurse, wakes from a coma with extraordinary abilities that threaten her lover, Simon, a musician down on his luck. Pushed toward choices she never knew she had, Stella discovers that her most remarkable power may be the will to discover herself — and reading the newest from one of America’s great storytellers, you may discover the same thing.\n\nJacquelyn Mitchard author, The Deep End of the Ocean\n\n“Caroline Leavitt's new novel With or Without You seduced me instantly and held my heart from the first page to the last. Like Elena Ferrante's raw and intimate explorations into human relationships this novel will make you laugh, cry, yell, and possibly more. At the heart of the story is the art of a woman's life, pulsing with beauty, desire, loss, never-ending change, and the grit it takes to keep going.” Lidia Yuknavitch, The Book of Joan\n\n​​\n\n\"This fresh, engaging, intimate tale of love and identity subverts the reader’s expectations again and again. Caroline Leavitt refuses to take one cliche’d turn. A complete original, an absolute delight.\"—Janet Fitch, The Revolution of Marina M., Chimes of a Lost Cathedral.\n\n​​\n\n“Caroline Leavitt has accomplished in With or Without the hardest but most profound task of the novelist: she makes us not only understand but care about characters as flawed as ourselves. Stella, Simon, and Libby straddle the ravine between hip urbanity and soulful vulnerability – each achieving a redemption that gives us hope that we might too.”\n\n--Lisa Gornick, Author of The Peacock Feast and Louisa Meets Bear\n\n​​"
