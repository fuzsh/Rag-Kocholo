Who inhabits this vast new garden of Eden? What strange beasts and natural formations can be found? Thus was the birth of Manifest Destiny and the resulting bloody battles with Indigenous tribes encountered by white explorers. Also in this volatile mix are the grizzled fur trappers and mountain men, waging war against the Native American tribes whose lands they traverse. This is the setting of Throne of Grace, and the guide to this epic narrative is arguably America's greatest yet most unsung pathfinder, Jedediah Smith. His explorations into the forested frontiers on both sides of the Rocky Mountains and all the way to the West Coast would become the stuff of legend. Thanks to painstaking research and riveting writing, the story of the making of modern America is told through the eyes of both the ordinary and memorable men and women, settlers and Indigenous, who witnessed it. But it's Smith who drives the narrative with his trailblazing path through the unexplored terrain of the American West.\n\nThrone of Grace is a gripping yarn that drops the reader into the center of an underreported era and introduces one of the great explorers in American history.\n\nReview Quotes\n\nPraise for Throne of Grace and Bob Drury and Tom Clavin:\n\n\"Jedediah Smith might be one of the most important, and one of the most overlooked, 19th century explorers in our nation's history.

Drury and Clavin pack the narrative with biographical details about the Rangers and skillfully toggle between battle scenes and big-picture analysis. WWII buffs will savor this deep dive.\" --Publishers Weekly on The Last Hill \"Bob Drury and Tom Clavin, challenge conventional wisdom about an American origin story and, in the process, weave a tale fit for the big screen.\" --Washington Free Beacon on Blood and Treasure \"Bob Drury and Tom Clavin together have given us a half-dozen elegantly written narratives of exhilarating episodes in American history. [Blood and Treasure] may be the authors' finest work to date. Redolent of time and place, a raw and rugged tale.\" --Wall Street Journal\n\nAbout the Author\n\nBOB DRURY and TOM CLAVIN are the #1 New York Times bestselling authors of The Last Hill, as well as Blood and Treasure; The Heart of Everything That Is; Lucky 666; Halsey's Typhoon; Last Men Out; Valley Forge; and The Last Stand of Fox Company, which won the Marine Corps Heritage Foundation's General Wallace M.
