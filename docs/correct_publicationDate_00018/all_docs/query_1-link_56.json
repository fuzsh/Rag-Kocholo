        "text": "Hyperion\n\nBy John Keats\n\n(excerpt)\n\nBOOK I\n\nDeep in the shady sadness of a vale\n\nFar sunken from the healthy breath of morn,\n\nFar from the fiery noon, and eve's one star,\n\nSat gray-hair'd Saturn, quiet as a stone,\n\nStill as the silence round about his lair;\n\nForest on forest hung about his head\n\nLike cloud on cloud. No stir of air was there,\n\nNot so much life as on a summer's day\n\nRobs not one light seed from the feather'd grass,\n\nBut where the dead leaf fell, there did it rest.\n\nA stream went voiceless by, still deadened more\n\nBy reason of his fallen divinity\n\nSpreading a shade: the Naiad 'mid her reeds\n\nPress'd her cold finger closer to her lips.\n\nAlong the margin-sand large foot-marks went,\n\nNo further than to where his feet had stray'd,\n\nAnd slept there since. Upon the sodden ground\n\nHis old right hand lay nerveless, listless, dead,\n\nUnsceptred; and his realmless eyes were closed;\n\nWhile his bow'd head seem'd list'ning to the Earth,\n\nHis ancient mother, for some comfort yet.\n\nIt seem'd no force could wake him from his place;\n\nBut there came one, who with a kindred hand\n\nTouch'd his wide shoulders, after bending low\n\nWith reverence, though to one who knew it not.\n\nShe was a Goddess of the infant world;\n\nBy her in stature the tall Amazon\n\nHad stood a pigmy's height; she would have ta'en\n\nAchilles by the hair and bent his neck;\n\nOr with a finger stay'd Ixion's wheel.\n\nHer face was large as that of Memphian sphinx,\n\nPedestal'd haply in a palace court,\n\nWhen sages look'd to Egypt for their lore.\n\nBut oh! how unlike marble was that face:\n\nHow beautiful, if sorrow had not made\n\nSorrow more beautiful than Beauty's self.\n\nThere was a listening fear in her regard,\n\nAs if calamity had but begun;\n\nAs if the vanward clouds of evil days\n\nHad spent their malice, and the sullen rear\n\nWas with its stored thunder labouring up.\n\nOne hand she press'd upon that aching spot\n\nWhere beats the human heart, as if just there,\n\nThough an immortal, she felt cruel pain:\n\nThe other upon Saturn's bended neck\n\nShe laid, and to the level of his ear\n\nLeaning with parted lips, some words she spake\n\nIn solemn tenour and deep organ tone:\n\nSome mourning words, which in our feeble tongue\n\nWould come in these like accents; O how frail\n\nTo that large utterance of the early Gods!\n\n\"Saturn, look up!—though wherefore, poor old King?\n\nI have no comfort for thee, no not one:\n\nI cannot say, \"O wherefore sleepest thou?\"\n\nFor heaven is parted from thee, and the earth\n\nKnows thee not, thus afflicted, for a God;\n\nAnd ocean too, with all its solemn noise,\n\nHas from thy sceptre pass'd; and all the air\n\nIs emptied of thine hoary majesty.\n\nThy thunder, conscious of the new command,\n\nRumbles reluctant o'er our fallen house;\n\nAnd thy sharp lightning in unpractis'd hands\n\nScorches and burns our once serene domain.\n\nO aching time! O moments big as years!\n\nAll as ye pass swell out the monstrous truth,\n\nAnd press it so upon our weary griefs\n\nThat unbelief has not a space to breathe.\n\nSaturn, sleep on:—O thoughtless, why did I\n\nThus violate thy slumbrous solitude?\n\nWhy should I ope thy melancholy eyes?\n\nSaturn, sleep on! while at thy feet I weep.\"\n\nAs when, upon a tranced summer-night,\n\nThose green-rob'd senators of mighty woods,\n\nTall oaks, branch-charmed by the earnest stars,\n\nDream, and so dream all night without a stir,\n\nSave from one gradual solitary gust\n\nWhich comes upon the silence, and dies off,\n\nAs if the ebbing air had but one wave;\n\nSo came these words and went; the while in tears\n\nShe touch'd her fair large forehead to the ground,\n\nJust where her falling hair might be outspread\n\nA soft and silken mat for Saturn's feet.\n\nOne moon, with alteration slow, had shed\n\nHer silver seasons four upon the night,\n\nAnd still these two were postured motionless,\n\nLike natural sculpture in cathedral cavern;\n\nThe frozen God still couchant on the earth,\n\nAnd the sad Goddess weeping at his feet:\n\nUntil at length old Saturn lifted up\n\nHis faded eyes, and saw his kingdom gone,\n\nAnd all the gloom and sorrow of the place,\n\nAnd that fair kneeling Goddess; and then spake,\n\nAs with a palsied tongue, and while his beard\n\nShook horrid with such aspen-malady:\n\n\"O tender spouse of gold Hyperion,\n\nThea, I feel thee ere I see thy face;\n\nLook up, and let me see our doom in it;\n\nLook up, and tell me if this feeble shape\n\nIs Saturn's; tell me, if thou hear'st the voice\n\nOf Saturn; tell me, if this wrinkling brow,\n\nNaked and bare of its great diadem,\n\nPeers like the front of Saturn. Who had power\n\nTo make me desolate? whence came the strength?\n\nHow was it nurtur'd to such bursting forth,\n\nWhile Fate seem'd strangled in my nervous grasp?\n\nBut it is so, and I am smother'd up,\n\nAnd buried from all godlike exercise\n\nOf influence benign on planets pale,\n\nOf admonitions to the winds and seas,\n\nOf peaceful sway above man's harvesting,\n\nAnd all those acts which Deity supreme\n\nDoth ease its heart of love in.—I am gone\n\nAway from my own bosom: I have left\n\nMy strong identity, my real self,\n\nSomewhere between the throne, and where I sit\n\nHere on this spot of earth. Search, Thea, search!\n\nOpen thine eyes eterne, and sphere them round\n\nUpon all space: space starr'd, and lorn of light;\n\nSpace region'd with life-air; and barren void;\n\nSpaces of fire, and all the yawn of hell.—\n\nSearch, Thea, search! and tell me, if thou seest\n\nA certain shape or shadow, making way\n\nWith wings or chariot fierce to repossess\n\nA heaven he lost erewhile: it must—it must\n\nBe of ripe progress—Saturn must be King.\n\nYes, there must be a golden victory;\n\nThere must be Gods thrown down, and trumpets blown\n\nOf triumph calm, and hymns of festival\n\nUpon the gold clouds metropolitan,\n\nVoices of soft proclaim, and silver stir\n\nOf strings in hollow shells; and there shall be\n\nBeautiful things made new, for the surprise\n\nOf the sky-children; I will give command:\n\nThea! Thea! Thea! where is Saturn?\"\n\nThis passion lifted him upon his feet,\n\nAnd made his hands to struggle in the air,\n\nHis Druid locks to shake and ooze with sweat,\n\nHis eyes to fever out, his voice to cease.\n\nHe stood, and heard not Thea's sobbing deep;\n\nA little time, and then again he snatch'd\n\nUtterance thus.—\"But cannot I create?\n\nCannot I form? Cannot I fashion forth\n\nAnother world, another universe,\n\nTo overbear and crumble this to nought?\n\nWhere is another chaos? Where?\"—That word\n\nFound way unto Olympus, and made quake\n\nThe rebel three.—Thea was startled up,\n\nAnd in her bearing was a sort of hope,\n\nAs thus she quick-voic'd spake, yet full of awe.\n\n\"This cheers our fallen house: come to our friends,\n\nO Saturn! come away, and give them heart;\n\nI know the covert, from thence came I hither.\"\n\nThus brief; then with beseeching eyes she went\n\nWith backward footing through the shade a space:\n\nHe follow'd, and she turn'd to lead the way\n\nThrough aged boughs, that yielded like the mist\n\nWhich eagles cleave upmounting from their nest.\n\nMeanwhile in other realms big tears were shed,\n\nMore sorrow like to this, and such like woe,\n\nToo huge for mortal tongue or pen of scribe:\n\nThe Titans fierce, self-hid, or prison-bound,\n\nGroan'd for the old allegiance once more,\n\nAnd listen'd in sharp pain for Saturn's voice.\n\nBut one of the whole mammoth-brood still kept\n\nHis sov'reignty, and rule, and majesty;—\n\nBlazing Hyperion on his orbed fire\n\nStill sat, still snuff'd the incense, teeming up\n\nFrom man to the sun's God; yet unsecure:\n\nFor as among us mortals omens drear\n\nFright and perplex, so also shuddered he—\n\nNot at dog's howl, or gloom-bird's hated screech,\n\nOr the familiar visiting of one\n\nUpon the first toll of his passing bell,\n\nOr prophesyings of the midnight lamp;\n\nBut horrors, portion'd to a giant nerve,\n\nOft made Hyperion ache. His palace bright\n\nBastion'd with pyramids of glowing gold,\n\nAnd touch'd with shade of bronzed obelisks,\n\nGlar'd a blood-red through all its thousand courts,\n\nArches, and domes, and fiery galleries;\n\nAnd all its curtains of Aurorian clouds\n\nFlush'd angerly: while sometimes eagle's wings,\n\nUnseen before by Gods or wondering men,\n\nDarken'd the place; and neighing steeds were heard,\n\nNot heard before by Gods or wondering men.\n\nAlso, when he would taste the spicy wreaths\n\nOf incense, breath'd aloft from sacred hills,\n\nInstead of sweets, his ample palate took\n\nSavour of poisonous brass and metal sick:\n\nAnd so, when harbour'd in the sleepy west,\n\nAfter the full completion of fair day,—\n\nFor rest divine upon exalted couch\n\nAnd slumber in the arms of melody,\n\nHe pac'd away the pleasant hours of ease\n\nWith stride colossal, on from hall to hall;\n\nWhile far within each aisle and deep recess,\n\nHis winged minions in close clusters stood,\n\nAmaz'd and full of fear; like anxious men\n\nWho on wide plains gather in panting troops,\n\nWhen earthquakes jar their battlements and towers.\n\nEven now, while Saturn, rous'd from icy trance,\n\nWent step for step with Thea through the woods,\n\nHyperion, leaving twilight in the rear,\n\nCame slope upon the threshold of the west;\n\nThen, as was wont, his palace-door flew ope\n\nIn smoothest silence, save what solemn tubes,\n\nBlown by the serious Zephyrs, gave of sweet\n\nAnd wandering sounds, slow-breathed melodies;\n\nAnd like a rose in vermeil tint and shape,\n\nIn fragrance soft, and coolness to the eye,\n\nThat inlet to severe magnificence\n\nStood full blown, for the God to enter in.\n\nHe enter'd, but he enter'd full of wrath;\n\nHis flaming robes stream'd out beyond his heels,\n\nAnd gave a roar, as if of earthly fire,\n\nThat scar'd away the meek ethereal Hours\n\nAnd made their dove-wings tremble. On he flared,\n\nFrom stately nave to nave, from vault to vault,\n\nThrough bowers of fragrant and enwreathed light,\n\nAnd diamond-paved lustrous long arcades,\n\nUntil he reach'd the great main cupola;\n\nThere standing fierce beneath, he stampt his foot,\n\nAnd from the basements deep to the high towers\n\nJarr'd his own golden region; and before\n\nThe quavering thunder thereupon had ceas'd,\n\nHis voice leapt out, despite of godlike curb,\n\nTo this result: \"O dreams of day and night!\n\nO monstrous forms! O effigies of pain!\n\nO spectres busy in a cold, cold gloom!\n\nO lank-ear'd Phantoms of black-weeded pools!\n\nWhy do I know ye? why have I seen ye? why\n\nIs my eternal essence thus distraught\n\nTo see and to behold these horrors new?\n\nSaturn is fallen, am I too to fall?\n\nAm I to leave this haven of my rest,\n\nThis cradle of my glory, this soft clime,\n\nThis calm luxuriance of blissful light,\n\nThese crystalline pavilions, and pure fanes,\n\nOf all my lucent empire? It is left\n\nDeserted, void, nor any haunt of mine.\n\nThe blaze, the splendour, and the symmetry,\n\nI cannot see—but darkness, death and darkness.\n\nEven here, into my centre of repose,\n\nThe shady visions come to domineer,\n\nInsult, and blind, and stifle up my pomp.—\n\nFall!—No, by Tellus and her briny robes!\n\nOver the fiery frontier of my realms\n\nI will advance a terrible right arm\n\nShall scare that infant thunderer, rebel Jove,\n\nAnd bid old Saturn take his throne again.\"—\n\nHe spake, and ceas'd, the while a heavier threat\n\nHeld struggle with his throat but came not forth;\n\nFor as in the theatres of crowded men\n\nHubbub increases more they call out \"Hush!\"\n\nSo at Hyperion's words the Phantoms pale\n\nBestirr'd themselves, thrice horrible and cold;\n\nAnd from the mirror'd level where he stood\n\nA mist arose, as from a scummy marsh.\n\nAt this, through all his bulk an agony\n\nCrept gradual, from the feet unto the crown,\n\nLike a lithe serpent vast and muscular\n\nMaking slow way, with head and neck convuls'd\n\nFrom over-strained might. Releas'd, he fled\n\nTo the eastern gates, and full six dewy hours\n\nBefore the dawn in season due should blush,\n\nHe breath'd fierce breath against the sleepy portals,\n\nClear'd them of heavy vapours, burst them wide\n\nSuddenly on the ocean's chilly streams.\n\nThe planet orb of fire, whereon he rode\n\nEach day from east to west the heavens through,\n\nSpun round in sable curtaining of clouds;\n\nNor therefore veiled quite, blindfold, and hid,\n\nBut ever and anon the glancing spheres,\n\nCircles, and arcs, and broad-belting colure,\n\nGlow'd through, and wrought upon the muffling dark\n\nSweet-shaped lightnings from the nadir deep\n\nUp to the zenith,—hieroglyphics old\n\nWhich sages and keen-ey'd astrologers\n\nThen living on the earth, with labouring thought\n\nWon from the gaze of many centuries:\n\nNow lost, save what we find on remnants huge\n\nOf stone, or marble swart; their import gone,\n\nTheir wisdom long since fled.—Two wings this orb\n\nPossess'd for glory, two fair argent wings,\n\nEver exalted at the God's approach:\n\nAnd now, from forth the gloom their plumes immense\n\nRose, one by one, till all outspreaded were;\n\nWhile still the dazzling globe maintain'd eclipse,\n\nAwaiting for Hyperion's command.\n\nFain would he have commanded, fain took throne\n\nAnd bid the day begin, if but for change.\n\nHe might not:—No, though a primeval God:\n\nThe sacred seasons might not be disturb'd.\n\nTherefore the operations of the dawn\n\nStay'd in their birth, even as here 'tis told.\n\nThose silver wings expanded sisterly,\n\nEager to sail their orb; the porches wide\n\nOpen'd upon the dusk demesnes of night;\n\nAnd the bright Titan, phrenzied with new woes,\n\nUnus'd to bend, by hard compulsion bent\n\nHis spirit to the sorrow of the time;\n\nAnd all along a dismal rack of clouds,\n\nUpon the boundaries of day and night,\n\nHe stretch'd himself in grief and radiance faint.\n\nThere as he lay, the Heaven with its stars\n\nLook'd down on him with pity, and the voice\n\nOf Coelus, from the universal space,\n\nThus whisper'd low and solemn in his ear.\n\n\"O brightest of my children dear, earth-born\n\nAnd sky-engendered, Son of Mysteries\n\nAll unrevealed even to the powers\n\nWhich met at thy creating; at whose joys\n\nAnd palpitations sweet, and pleasures soft,\n\nI, C{oe}lus, wonder, how they came and whence;\n\nAnd at the fruits thereof what shapes they be,\n\nDistinct, and visible; symbols divine,\n\nManifestations of that beauteous life\n\nDiffus'd unseen throughout eternal space:\n\nOf these new-form'd art thou, oh brightest child!\n\nOf these, thy brethren and the Goddesses!\n\nThere is sad feud among ye, and rebellion\n\nOf son against his sire. I saw him fall,\n\nI saw my first-born tumbled from his throne!\n\nTo me his arms were spread, to me his voice\n\nFound way from forth the thunders round his head!\n\nPale wox I, and in vapours hid my face\n\nArt thou, too, near such doom? vague fear there is:\n\nFor I have seen my sons most unlike Gods.\n\nDivine ye were created, and divine\n\nIn sad demeanour, solemn, undisturb'd,\n\nUnruffled, like high Gods, ye liv'd and ruled:\n\nNow I behold in you fear, hope, and wrath;\n\nActions of rage and passion; even as\n\nI see them, on the mortal world beneath,\n\nIn men who die.—This is the grief, O Son!\n\nSad sign of ruin, sudden dismay, and fall!\n\nYet do thou strive; as thou art capable,\n\nAs thou canst move about, an evident God;\n\nAnd canst oppose to each malignant hour\n\nEthereal presence:—I am but a voice;\n\nMy life is but the life of winds and tides,\n\nNo more than winds and tides can I avail:—\n\nBut thou canst.—Be thou therefore in the van\n\nOf circumstance; yea, seize the arrow's barb\n\nBefore the tense string murmur.—To the earth!\n\nFor there thou wilt find Saturn and his woes.\n\nMeanwhile I will keep watch on thy bright sun,\n\nAnd of thy seasons be a careful nurse.\"—\n\nEre half this region-whisper had come down,\n\nHyperion arose, and on the stars\n\nLifted his curved lids, and kept them wide\n\nUntil it ceas'd; and still he kept them wide:\n\nAnd still they were the same bright, patient stars.\n\nThen with a slow incline of his broad breast,\n\nLike to a diver in the pearly seas,\n\nForward he stoop'd over the airy shore,\n\nAnd plung'd all noiseless into the deep night."
