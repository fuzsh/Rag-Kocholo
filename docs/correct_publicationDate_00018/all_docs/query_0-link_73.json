Y.\n\nThanks for bawling me out about my mathematical non-weird scoreboard. Happy I am to see a revival of \"The Eyrie.\" Especially in the case of your editorial comments and notes from the authors.\n\nNow for the gripe department; Day Keene's story in March was a good story, but a good story that did not belong in WEIRD TALES. Yes, I know-variety's the spice and all that. How about more stories from the old-timers?\n\nThe Throne of Saturn. S. Fowler Wright, Arkham House, $3.\n\nS. Fowler Wright is widely acknowledged as one of the masters of the modern science-fiction story. This collection of his tales contains \"The Rat,\" \"Automata,\" \"Barin\" and \"Original Sin\" as well as other stories which appear as a collection in this country for the first time. His great science fiction novels, such as \"Deluge\" and \"The World Below\" are enjoying a new vogue in England, and this new collection from Arkham House ought to appeal to WEIRD TALES readers who always can be counted on to like stories in this genre—the inimitable \"The Rat\" appeared in our pages in 1929.\n\nPebble in the Sky. Isaac Asimov. Doubleday, $2.50.\n\nHere is a full-length science-fiction novel which has not appeared serially before book publication, though Dr. Asimov's name has meant a good deal to magazine readers. The story began when Joseph Schwartz was walking down a street in Chicago, past the Institute for Nuclear Research. Having raised one foot in the 20th century, he lowered it in Galactic Era 827. Any WEIRD TALES readers can take it on from there; it's a good one."
