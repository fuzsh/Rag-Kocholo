        "text": "Template:Refimprove\n\nArkham House is a publishing house specializing in fantasy and weird fiction.\n\nHistory[]\n\n20th century[]\n\nArkham House was founded in Sauk City, Wisconsin in 1939 by August Derleth and Donald Wandrei to preserve in hardcover the best fiction of H.P. Lovecraft. The company's name is derived from Lovecraft's fictional New England city, Arkham. Arkham House editions are noted for the quality of their printing and binding. The colophon for Arkham House was designed by Frank Utpatel.\n\nIn addition to volumes of H. P. Lovecraft's fiction, Arkham House has published a five volume edition of Lovecraft's Selected Letters which gives an overview of Lovecraft's correspondence to peers, friends and family. Among his correspondents were Arkham House founders, Derleth and Wandrei. (Arkham House's volumes of Lovecraft's letters are highly abridged; unabridged volumes of Lovecraft's letters to individual correspondents are progressively being issued by Hippocampus Press).\n\nArkham House also published fiction by many of Lovecraft's contemporaries, including Ray Bradbury, Robert E. Howard, Frank Belknap Long, Clark Ashton Smith, Robert Bloch, and Derleth himself; classic genre fiction by authors such as William Hope Hodgson, Algernon Blackwood, H. Russell Wakefield, Seabury Quinn, and Sheridan Le Fanu; and later writers in the Lovecraft school, such as Ramsey Campbell and Brian Lumley to whom Derleth gave their earliest publication in hardcover.\n\nAfter World War II, Wandrei resigned his interest in the firm.\n\nDespite the wealth of talented writers who appeared under the Arkham House imprint, it was not a financial success. Derleth wrote in 1970, \"[T]he fact is that in no single year since its founding have the earnings of Arkham House met the expenses, so that it has been necessary for my personal earnings to shore up Arkham House finances.\"\n\nAfter Derleth's death in 1971, Donald Wandrei briefly acted as editorial director but declined to resume his interest in the firm permanently.\n\nHe was succeeded by James Turner, who expanded the company's range of authors to include such prominent science fiction and fantasy writers as Michael Bishop, Lucius Shepard, Bruce Sterling, James Tiptree, Jr., Michael Shea and J. G. Ballard, often publishing hardcover collections of shorter works. Turner's acquisitions took the publisher away from its roots in weird and horror fiction, and he was eventually dismissed by August Derleth's daughter April.\n\n21st century[]\n\nApril (Rose) Derleth became president of Arkham House in 2002, having appointed Peter Ruber as her consulting editor and the successor to James Turner. The house’s mission was to return to classic weird fiction, which Ruber sought to do. Ruber drew criticismTemplate:Where? for the hostile opinions of various authors he expressed in his story introductions within Arkham's Masters of Horror (2000). Rumours of his ill-health circulated for some time and it appears his editorial duties at Arkham House laterTemplate:Vague lapsed due to this.\n\nAugust Derleth's children April and Walden (Wally) Derleth co-owned the publisher. April ran the business while Wally has currently no direct involvement in its day-to-day operations. April earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in English from the University of Wisconsin-Madison in 1977. She became majority stockholder, President, and CEO of Arkham House in 1994. She remained in that capacity until her death. She was known in the community as a naturalist and humanitarian. April Derleth died March 21, 2011. [1][2][3][4][5] The publisher's website announced in April 2011 that April Derleth's children will take over the running of the publisher - Danielle Jacobs has been named President, and her brother Damon Derleth as Vice President.\n\nThe house's publishing schedule slowed considerably between 2000-2006, with only nine books issued—In the Stone House by Barry N. Malzberg (2000); Book of the Dead by E. Hoffmann Price (a collection of memoirs of writers known by Price, 2001); Arkham House's Masters of Horror (ed. Peter Ruber, 2000); The Far Side of Nowhere by Nelson Bond (2002); The Cleansing by John D. Harvey (a horror novel, 2002); Selected Letters of Clark Ashton Smith (ed. Scott Connors, 2003); Cave of a Thousand Tales by Milt Thomas (a biography of pulp writer Hugh B. Cave, 2004); Other Worlds Than Ours, another collection by Nelson Bond (2005); and Evermore (a collection of tales in tribute to Edgar Allan Poe, ed. James Robert Smith & Stephen Mark Rainey, 2006).\n\nNo books have been issued under Arkham House's sole imprint since 2006. Books were previously published in almost every year since the publisher's founding in 1939 (except for 1940 and 1955/56), so the four-year gap 2006-10 could be seen to mark the lowest point thus far in Arkham House's publishing fortunes.\n\nIn early 2009 it was announced that George Vanderburgh of Battered Silicon Dispatch Box, and Robert Weinberg, would jointly take over the editorial duties at Arkham House. Battered Silicon Dispatch Box has issued in 2009 four new volumes of stories by August Derleth under a joint imprint with Arkham House which constitute Arkham House's only output since 2006.\n\nPublishing activity seems to have begun to ramp up anew, however, with a reissue (2010) of The Arkham Sampler (1948-49), a limited ed (250 sets) two-volume facsimile reprint of the now-rare magazine issued by Arkham House that ran four issues a year 1948-1949. This work is being issued by Arkham House co-published with the August Derleth Society. Additionally a novel, Jon Lellenberg's Baker Street Irregular, has been announced for publication in Nov 2011.\n\nGeorge Vanderburgh's blog at Battered Silicon Dispatch Box has made the further announcements of a forward publishing schedule as follows:\n\n2011\n\nDeadly Dimensions and Other Blasphemies A Novel and Short Weird Fiction by Lois H. Gresh A hardcover edition limited to 1000. ISBN 978-1-55246-923-1 … $39.95\n\nThe Gargoyle and Others: A Quarto of Horror by Greye La Spina. Four short horror novels from the early pages of Weird Tales magazine. Includes the classic werewolf novel “Invaders from the Dark,” along with “The Gargoyle,” “Fettered,” and “The Portal to Power.” An edition size has not been set. ISBN 978-1-55246-910-1 … $39.95\n\nThe Arkham House H.P. Lovecraft The digital edition in 13 volumes\n\nMultiple pirated copies of this definitive text as well as corrupted text are available elsewhere. In addition this text is essentially in the public domain in other parts of the world since the author died in 1937. However this is the first authorized edition. These volumes are suitable for all forms of e-book readers. The entire set of volumes will be available individually for downloading, or all on one CD. Price not yet set.\n\n2014 –\n\nSeventy-Five Years of Arkham House ISBN 978-1-55246-924-8 … Price not yet set.\n\nOther imprints[]\n\nArkham House published under two additional imprints throughout its history.\n\nIn 1945], the Mycroft & Moran imprint was launched for the publication of weird detective and mystery stories, including Derleth's Solar Pons series. The title of the imprint was inspired by characters from the Sherlock Holmes stories: Sherlock's brother Mycroft Holmes, and the villain Colonel Moran. Some Mycroft and Moran titles since 1993 have also been issued by Battered Silicon Dispatch Box.\n\nArkham also introduced Stanton & Lee Publishers in 1945 with the intention of publishing cartoons by Clare Victor Dwiggins. Stanton & Lee Publishers went on to publish poetry and the regional writings of August Derleth.\n\nAdditionally, August Derleth sub-contracted certain books which were nominally published by Arkham House to other publishers including Villiers Publications of England, and Pelligrini and Cudahy of New York.\n\nRecognition[]\n\nIn 2005, Arkham House was awarded the World Fantasy Award for Small Press Achievements—the trophy was a bust of H.P. Lovecraft.\n\nWorks published by Arkham House[]\n\n2010s[]\n\nTemplate:List\n\nThe Arkham Sampler (1948-1949), edited by George Vanderburgh and Robert Weinberg (2010)\n\nBaker Street Irregular, by Jon Lellenberg (2010)\n\n2000s[]\n\nThe Macabre Quarto, by August Derleth\n\nvol. 1: Who Shall I Say Is Calling & Other Stories edited by Stephen Dziemianowicz and Robert Weinberg (2009)\n\nvol. 2: The Sleepers and other Wakeful Things introduced by Ramsey Campbell (2009)\n\nvol. 3: That Is Not Dead introduced by David Drake (2009)\n\nvol. 4: August Derleth's Eerie Creatures introduced by Brian Lumley (2009)\n\nThe Shunned House Facsimile, by H.
