        "text": "Throughout his career, which saw fifty one-man shows, Richard Schmid promoted art education through his books, articles, workshops, seminars, and television presentations, and he traveled widely for his subjects. Richard held a Doctorate in Fine Art and was a recipient of The John Singer Sargent Medal for Lifetime Achievement.\n\nSince the publication of his landmark book on landscape painting in 2009, Richard has been involved in major projects. The first, in 2011, was a very large painting of Abbotsford House, the manor home of Sir Walter Scott in Melrose, Scotland, which won a viewing and praise from HRH Queen Elizabeth during the grand re-opening ceremonies of the house and visitors center.\n\nAnother project, begun in 2011, was the new expanded edition of ALLA PRIMA entitled ALLA PRIMA II, completed in 2013, and now in its fourth printing. Additionally, exhibitions of Richardâ€™s art were mounted at the National Academy of Science on Cape Cod, and Wellesley College in Boston."
