        "text": "Where did a large-scale Roman slave-owner obtain new slaves? Varro in effect tells us: Ephesus. And the answer would probably have been the same for many generations after his time. But can we work out more systematically and more thoroughly the relative importance of different kinds of sources? The sources which most require consideration are: (1) children born to slave-mothers within the Empire; (2) persons enslaved in provincial or frontier wars; (3) persons imported across the frontiers; (4) the ‘self-enslaved’; and (5) infants abandoned at places within the Empire.\n\nSeveral years ago, I argued on a number of grounds that the last of these sources, child-exposure, was more important than had previously been recognized. Subsequent reconsideration of the problem has led me to suspect that the source-material under-represents the amount of slave-importation across the frontiers, but not to doubt that child-exposure was very widespread or that it made an important contribution to the slave supply. Of the many subsequent discussions, the most original is that of Ramin and Veyne, who, in an article of 1981 too little attended to in the Anglo-Saxon world, made it appear very likely that those who voluntarily sold themselves into slavery were a larger category than scholars usually imagine. More recently, Scheidel has attempted to revive the case, previously propounded by Shtaerman among others, in favour of the self-reproductivity of the slave population.\n\n18 In De propriorum animi cuiuslibet affectuum dignotione 9.13 (p. 33 Boer, De (CMG 5,4,1,1) = 5 p. 49Google Scholar Kühn), Galen lets it drop that the number of slaves was the same as the number of male citizens and as the number of women (citizens), namely 40,000. (See Mitchell, S., Anatolia (1993), II, 244Google Scholar, for the view that these numbers referred to the city itself without its chora.) The absolute value of this figure is slight (cf. Scheidel, W., ‘Finances, figures and fiction’, CQ 46 (1996), 222–38CrossRefGoogle Scholar, on the Graeco-Roman passion for the numbers 400, 40,000, 400,000), but the proportions may be roughly right. If the free population was 3.5 times that of the male citizens (Duncan-Jones, R. P., The Economy of the Roman Empire: Quantitative Studies (1974), 264 n. 4Google Scholar), that would mean that slaves made up 22.2 per cent of the total, but it seems unlikely that Galen intended to include very young slave children (since he is discussing the financial assets of the three groups); hence the proportion was probably higher than 22.2 per cent. Parkin, op. cit. (n. 16), 175 n. 187, prefers a multiplier of 4, not 3.5, but Caesar, , BG 1.29Google Scholar does not support this: the men who could bear arms (among the Helvetii) must have been a smaller set than the adult males. Those who believe in low estimates for the slave population regularly belittle Galen's information.\n\n31 With respect to pre-Severan times, this rests on an argument from silence and probability. Then there is the comment of Ulpian, in Dig. 5.3.27Google Scholar.pr.: ‘quia non temere ancillae eius rei causa comparantur ut pariant …’, ‘since slave-women are not commonly acquired so that they may produce children’; for the sense of non temere cf. Suet., , De gramm. 4.5Google Scholar, Gell. 20.5.4, and OLD sense 3. It used to be debated, not unreasonably, whether non temere was interpolated: De Martino, F., Storia economica di Roma antica (1980), 265–6Google Scholar. (T. Kinsey in A. Watson (ed.), The Digest of Justinian (1985), erroneously translates ‘slave girls are not acquired solely as breeding stock’.) There is no contradiction between Ulpian's words and Dig. 21.1.14.1 (Ulpian again) or 19.1.21.pr. (Paulus), texts which confirm the obvious fact that when women slaves were purchased the purchasers were sometimes (as they must normally have been) interested in their ability to bear children.\n\n62 If we descended to the era of Justinian, or even of Diocletian, the story might be different (see the end of this article); the point is not to deny that the natural sex-ratio ever reasserted itself, but that it did so quickly. The Aezani text of Diocletian's Price Edict shows that female slaves received the same valuation as males in only one age-group, from eight to sixteen; prospective fertility is likely to be one of the causes (cf. Scheidel, W., ‘Reflections on the differential valuation of slaves in Diocletian's Price Edict and in the United States’, Münstersche Beiträge zur antiken Handelsgeschichte 15, 1 (1996), 67–79Google Scholar).\n\n68 Coale and Demeny, op. cit. (n. 12), 57, 82, 399, 449. The applicability of Model West (or South) to the Ancient World needs to be re-examined in the light of the history of causes of mortality (none of the 130 tables underlying Model West goes back earlier than 1870 (Coale and Demeny 12), a date later than, among other things, Lister's discovery of antisepsis; five of the twenty-two tables underlying Model South are from Italy, 1876–1910, all the others are from 1900 or later (ibid.)), but the problem cannot be pursued here. It is unlikely, for example, that many if any of the countries whose statistics went to make up Model West had nearly as high a level of infant mortality from child-abandonment. Level 3, incidentally, means that the table concerns a population in which eo = 25.\n\n94 Scheidel, op. cit. (n. 4), 165 n. 37, attempts to dispose of the small proportion of the comparative evidence which he takes notice of, but it is not clear what reason or reasons he advances for doing so. Not a demographic one certainly. His point seems to be that high levels of abandonment were brought about by the existence of foundling hospitals, which were of course unknown in antiquity. But very high levels of abandonment are known from, indeed commonplace in, other worlds without foundling hospitals (Dickeman, M., ‘Demographic consequences of infanticide in man’, Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics 6 (1975), 130CrossRefGoogle Scholar); and the basic premise is faulty, for we must assume that abandoning parents had at least a rough idea that foundling hospitals were dangerous — and being cauldrons of disease, it is quite possible that traditional foundling hospitals led to a higher mortality rate than Graeco-Romana exposure did."
