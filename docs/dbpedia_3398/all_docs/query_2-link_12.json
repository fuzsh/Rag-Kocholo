        "text": "Frederick Augustus II (born May 18, 1797, Dresden, Saxony—died Aug. 9, 1854, the Tirol, Austria) was a reform-minded king of Saxony and nephew of Frederick Augustus I, who favoured German unification but was frightened into a reactionary policy by the revolutions of 1848–49.\n\nFrederick Augustus shared the regency with his uncle, King Anton, from 1830 to 1836, when he succeeded to the throne. The constitution of 1831, granting a measure of representative government, was partly his work. He continued to advocate reform after his accession but, lacking resolution, accomplished very little. Frederick Augustus sympathized with the plan for German unity espoused by the Frankfurt National Assembly in 1848, though he refused to accept that body’s liberal draft constitution. This refusal led to the Dresden revolt in May 1849, which was crushed only with the aid of Prussian troops. Thereafter, F.F. von Beust, a reactionary enemy of Prussia and friend of Austria, brought Saxony wholly into the Austrian camp. After the abortive revolution, Frederick Augustus became less and less active in the government of his state. Always an enthusiastic amateur botanist, who had travelled extensively in Europe pursuing this hobby, he died as the result of an accident on one of his expeditions to the Tirol."
