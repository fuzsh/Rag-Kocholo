        "text": "George Noteware was a “Hessian” soldier in the American Revolution before being captured at the Battle of Saratoga. In 1778, after a year as a prisoner, he enlisted in the 1st NY Regiment of the Continental Line and served as a private soldier at Fort Stanwix/Schuyler and the Siege of Yorktown until the end of the war. Although he began the war as an \"enemy\" of the Continental Army, George Noteware became a private soldier in the young American Army, and eventually became a citizen of the new United States. He and his descendants are representative of the hundreds of \"Hessian\" soldiers who stayed in North America after the war to make new lives for themselves.\n\nGeorge Noteware (Yarre Notwehr) was born on December 16, 1752, in Lower Saxony (Niedersachsen), Germany. At some point in his life, George joined one of the many military regiments in the area of Brunswick.\n\nOn January 9, 1776, Great Britain and Charles I, Duke of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel came to an agreement whereby his soldiers would be placed under the command of the British military. And by summer of that year, Noteware became one of nearly 4,300 Brunswick soldiers shipped over the ocean to fight in a conflict on behalf of British King George III. These men were now at the dispense of a foreign ruler and fighting in a foreign land.\n\nAfter arriving in Quebec, Canada, his regiment would become part of General John Burgoyne’s larger army, marching south with the intent of dividing New York, and therefore the rest of the colonies, by way of its waterways. He became an American prisoner after the Battle of Saratoga, in October 1777. According to the “Convention of Saratoga” surrender agreement between Burgoyne and General Horatio Gates, the troops had to leave their weapons on the field of surrender. From there they were to march to the Harbor of Boston, Massachusetts, to be put aboard ships and never return to fight again. 2,139 British, 830 Canadians, and 2,022 Germans spent the next month on the march, over poorly built roads and through cold weather, as a captive army.\n\nOnce they reached the Winter Hill Camp in Cambridge, they were placed in hastily made, flimsy, and cold barracks that were used by the Americans during the Siege of Boston the year prior. The soldiers themselves were still under the command of their officers and kept together within their regimental units. They received no extra clothing and firewood was scarce and expensive. The Brunswick and Hessen Hanau Regiments were kept in there for a whole year. Many suffered the illnesses of a winter in confinement. Eventually, boredom set in, and many found themselves regularly in trouble with the American guards. Some of them went out to work by special permits. Others deserted or joined the American forces.\n\nIn the end, the American Congress did not ratify the Saratoga Convention agreement, and consequently, British ships to pick up the prisoners according to the original agreement, were refused entry into the harbor. In late 1778, many of them were marched south to Charlottesville, VA. This is likely when Noteware joined the 1st NY Regiment of the Continental Line in Captain John Wendell’s Company. The 1st NY was known to be ranging into Massachusetts at the time in search of new recruits and by his own account he enlisted as a private as winter 1778 began.\n\nNoteware would’ve been marched to the border and stationed at Fort Schuyler (Stanwix) with the rest of the regiment. He was a participant in Goose Van Schaick's raid against the Onondaga; the first blow of the larger Sullivan-Clinton Campaign. When the regiment was reassigned and merged with the 3rd NY, he continued his enlistment, eventually ending up with them at the Siege of Yorktown. In spring of 1783, he was discharged from service at New Windsor Cantonment in New York.\n\nAfter moving to the area of Salisbury, CT, George found himself in the middle of a community full of those of German descent. He became employed as a laborer by a Mr. Spire. In early winter of 1786, at the house of a Mr. Vosburgh he met a woman named Huldah Kline (said to have lived with her father at the time). On April 17, 1786, after borrowing a horse from Mr. Spire to get to the ceremony, the two were married by Mr. Camp, Esquire also of Salisbury. They spent five days in the Spire household and then moved together to Sheffield, MA. On January 11, 1796, he purchased them a dwelling house and one acre and two rods of land on the western edge of Great Barrington, MA, which they soon occupied. He later purchased an adjoining one acre of land.\n\nThe couple had eight children:\n\nJohn Noteware. Born June 5, 1787. John had passed before Huldah applied for her pension as she lists seven living children, not including him.\n\nDaniel Noteware. Born October 11, 1788.\n\nJacob Noteware. Born October 6, 1791.\n\nRebecca Noteware. Born January 1, 1793.\n\nDiadama Noteware. Born October 17, 1794. Diadama was likely the namesake of Diadama Spire. Spire’s husband employed George as a laborer the year he married Huldah. The newlyweds borrowed a horse from the Spires' to get to their ceremony and stayed at their house for five days before moving in together afterwards.\n\nNorton Noteware. Born June 4, 1797.\n\nEliza Noteware. Born July 16, 1799.\n\nLorinda (Laura) Noteware. Born February 9, 1802.\n\nOn March 18, 1818, the U.S. Congress passed \"An act to provide for certain persons engaged in the land and naval service of the United States in the revolutionary war.\" Shortly after, Noteware applied for a pension in Massachusetts at the age of 65. A friend stated that he had been “in reduced circumstances, and stands in need of the assistance of his country for support.”\n\nAlthough he had no physical records of his service, Noteware provided the following deposition:\n\n“And I do solemnly swear, that I was a resident Citizen of the United States, on the 18th day of March, 1818, and that I have not since that time, by gift, sale or in any manner disposed of my property, or any part thereof with intent, thereby so to diminish it, as to bring myself within the provisions of an Act of Congress entitled \"An Act to provide for certain persons, engaged in the land and naval service of the United States, in the Revolutionary war,\" passed on the 18th day of March, 1818, and that I have not, nor has any person in trust for me any property or securities, contracts or debts, due to me, nor have I any income, other than what is contained in the schedule, hereto annexed, and by me subscribed -- schedule of property, necessary clothing and bedding exempted -- to wit: Real Estate - one House - Zero acres + two rods of Land Personal Estate\n\n-one cow - $15.00 one large wheel - $1.00\"\n\nhog - 4.00 one small wheel - 1.00\n\nfour sheep - 3.00 1 three Iron kettles - 1.50\n\none ax - 1.00 1 tea pot - .12\n\nhoe - .25 two bowls - .12\n\ntable - 1.00 two plates - .12\n\nfive chairs - .50 set knives + forks - .50\n\n~~~~~~~ 25.25\n\nThat I am by occupation A Laborer that the number of my family residing with me is one that their names and ages are as follow: Huldah Notewire - aged fifty nine years.\"\n\nThe entirety of his reported property at the time totaled about $84.11. On April 27, 1818 Noteware was granted a pension of about $8 per month; a yearly amount of that total must've been life changing for the Noteware Family. His pension was certificate #5,122.\n\nOn occasion in his later years, witnesses stated that “on the 4th of July, and on other public occasions [he] was accustomed to shout the orders of military drill, and ‘hurrah for George Washington.’” In about 1824, Noteware, Huldah, and several of their children moved from Massachusetts to Broome County, NY, and then to Newark, Tioga County, NY. His property was said to be one of the finest in the area. Sadly, George Noteware passed within another year on August 21, 1825.\n\nOn August 13, 1838, Huldah applied in Tioga County for a widow’s pension. After providing her own deposition, a copy of her husband’s previous one, and several affidavits from long-time friends to prove her identity and relationship to Noteware, she was awarded a half pay widow’s pension pay $80 per year.\n\nAs the generations progressed many of Noteware’s descendants became soldiers. Several grandsons served in Union Army during the American Civil War. One was William J. Millen, who died at the Battle of Spotsylvania Courthouse. Another, David Millen (likely William’s brother), died at the Battle of Petersburg only about six weeks later.\n\nSome estimate that nearly 25% (if not more!) of the “Hessian” soldiers who were shipped to fight in America remained there after the war to start a new life. Today, there are about 50 million modern-day German Americans who trace their roots to Hessian soldiers who stayed in America. Included President Dwight D. Eisenhower, Babe Ruth, actors Sandra Bullock and Rob Lowe, and astronaut Neil Armstrong, and many, many others.\n\nSources"
