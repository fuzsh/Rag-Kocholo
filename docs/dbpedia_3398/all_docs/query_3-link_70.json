        "text": "Dr. Rosanna Weksberg is a Professor of Paediatrics and Medical Genetics at The Hospital for Sick Children (SickKids) and University of Toronto. Dr. Weksberg’s current research focuses on the epigenetic basis of normal human development and the identification of epigenetic alterations associated with human disease, especially for growth and neurodevelopmental disorders. Dr. Weksberg is an Associate Editor for the American Journal of Medical Genetics and Frontiers in Genetics.\n\nResearch\n\nDr. Weksberg’s research is focused on elucidating the role of epigenetics in human disease. In particular the lab is interested in exploring the impact of genetic and environmental factors on epigenetic marks and their role in human growth and neurodevelopment. Recent work highlights the study of genome–wide epigenetic variation in different normal human tissues as well as in neurodevelopmental syndromes and growth disorders. Considerable effort has also, in recent years, been directed at defining the optimal experimental systems to use for the identification of epigenetic alterations associated with human disease. Specifically these have included evaluations of various cell types, genome-wide microarray platforms, validation techniques, and bioinformatics tools. Over 200 peer-reviewed papers have been published.\n\nEducation and experience\n\n1976: PhD, Medical Biophysics, University of Toronto\n\n1978: MD, University of Toronto\n\n1981–Present: Active Staff, Division of Clinical and Metabolic Genetics, Department of Paediatrics, The Hospital for Sick Children\n\n1998–Present: Senior Associate Scientist, Genetics and Genome Biology Program, Research Institute, The Hospital for Sick Children\n\n2000–Present: Professor, Departments of Paediatrics, Molecular Genetics, Institute of Medical Sciences, University of Toronto\n\nAchievements"
