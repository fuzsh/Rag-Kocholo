In the field of real analysis, he is mostly known for the first rigorous formulation of the integral, the Riemann integral, and his work on Fourier series. His contributions to complex analysis include most notably the introduction of Riemann surfaces, breaking new ground in a natural, geometric treatment of complex analysis. His 1859 paper on the prime-counting function, containing the original statement of the Riemann hypothesis, is regarded as a foundational paper of analytic number theory. Through his pioneering contributions to differential geometry, Riemann laid the foundations of the mathematics of general relativity. He is considered by many to be one of the greatest mathematicians of all time.\n\nEmmy Noether\n\nBorn in\n\nGermany\n\nYears\n\n1882-1935 (aged 53)\n\nOccupations\n\nuniversity teacherphysicistmathematician\n\nBiography\n\nAmalie Emmy Noether was a German mathematician who made many important contributions to abstract algebra.

She was described by Pavel Alexandrov, Albert Einstein, Jean Dieudonné, Hermann Weyl and Norbert Wiener as the most important woman in the history of mathematics. As one of the leading mathematicians of her time, she developed theories of rings, fields, and algebras. In physics, Noether's theorem explains the connection between symmetry and conservation laws.\n\nPaul Ehrlich\n\nAwards\n\nNobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1908\n\nBorn in\n\nPoland\n\nYears\n\n1854-1915 (aged 61)\n\nOccupations\n\nuniversity teacherpharmacologistbiologistchemistphysician\n\nBiography\n\nPaul Ehrlich was a Nobel Prize-winning German physician and scientist who worked in the fields of hematology, immunology, and antimicrobial chemotherapy.

She disagreed with Freud about inherent differences in the psychology of men and women, and like Adler, she traced such differences to society and culture rather than biology.\n\nSofia Kovalevskaya\n\nBorn in\n\nRussia\n\nYears\n\n1850-1891 (aged 41)\n\nEnrolled in the University of Gottingen\n\nIn 1874 graduated with Doctor of Philosophy\n\nOccupations\n\nuniversity teachercommunardwriterphysicistmathematician\n\nBiography\n\nSofya Vasilyevna Kovalevskaya, born Korvin-Krukovskaya (15 January [O.S. 3 January] 1850 – 10 February 1891), was a Russian mathematician who made noteworthy contributions to analysis, partial differential equations and mechanics.

According to historian of science Ann Hibner Koblitz, Kovalevskaya was \"the greatest known woman scientist before the twentieth century\".\n\nSophie Germain\n\nBorn in\n\nFrance\n\nYears\n\n1776-1831 (aged 55)\n\nOccupations\n\nphysicistphilosophermathematician\n\nBiography\n\nMarie-Sophie Germain was a French mathematician, physicist, and philosopher. Despite initial opposition from her parents and difficulties presented by society, she gained education from books in her father's library, including ones by Euler, and from correspondence with famous mathematicians such as Lagrange, Legendre, and Gauss (under the pseudonym of Monsieur LeBlanc). One of the pioneers of elasticity theory, she won the grand prize from the Paris Academy of Sciences for her essay on the subject. Her work on Fermat's Last Theorem provided a foundation for mathematicians exploring the subject for hundreds of years after. Because of prejudice against her sex, she was unable to make a career out of mathematics, but she worked independently throughout her life.
