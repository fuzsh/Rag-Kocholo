Our strategy results in a cross-verified database of 2.29 million individuals (an elite of 1/43,000 of human being having ever lived), including a third who are not present in the English edition of Wikipedia. Data collection is driven by specific social science questions on gender, economic growth, urban and cultural development.

        "text": "Universe described\n\nSocial scientists are interested in significant people insofar as they have influenced the trajectory of the society in their times or later on. Let us call \\({\\mathfrak{S}}\\) the universe of these significant individuals, without any further discussion of what influence means - it is actually entirely specific to the question social scientists would ask, e.g. the dynamics of the arts, or science, or demography, etc. Let us call \\({\\mathfrak{D}}\\) the universe of already detected individuals, for instance all those individuals above a certain visibility threshold at their time, that would be invariant over time, e.g. the so called ‘elite’, the top famous individuals. Some of them will be part of our data collection process, from Wikipedia and Wikidata (let us call this set \\({\\mathfrak{W}}\\)), while others are in known sources but unexploited yet, or not yet in the Wiki universe (let us denote it \\({\\mathfrak{U}}\\)). Some individuals may have been significant and even remembered for a while, but are currently forgotten. We can call this set \\({\\mathfrak{F}}\\). To sum up, the theoretical universe of significant individuals is decomposed as:\n\n$${\\mathfrak{S}}={\\mathfrak{F}}\\cup {\\mathfrak{D}}={\\mathfrak{F}}\\cup {\\mathfrak{W}}\\cup {\\mathfrak{U}}$$\n\nWe try to reach \\({\\mathfrak{S}}\\) by \\({\\mathfrak{w}}\\) with automatic routines. In the future, unexploited archives in \\({\\mathfrak{U}}\\) will gradually converge to the Wiki universe \\({\\mathfrak{W}}\\), while forgotten individuals in \\({\\mathfrak{F}}\\) will - albeit slowly - be gradually rediscovered by historians, or scholars in the arts or science disciplines. Therefore, further editions of this database will cover more individuals as more information will become available in Wikipedia and Wikidata in the future.\n\nA social science background\n\nSocial scientists develop models to illustrate causal mechanisms. As a result, we need to collect data in a way that fits the typology of these models. To encompass a wide range of human activities and domains of influence, we follow the seminal work on the so-called Baumol’s cost disease9. This refers to a situation in which a sector without productivity gains (such as performing arts until the beginning of the XXth century) faces higher wages due to productivity gains in other sectors. We assume that the amount of global wealth produced by humans in a given year is of two types, \\({Y}^{M},{Y}^{I}\\), where \\({Y}^{M}\\) is the amount of materialistic goods and services generated by the commonly-called productive sector, and \\({Y}^{I}\\) is the amount of non-materialistic goods and services created in other sectors of the economy such as arts, leisure, health, sports, etc. The evolution of \\({Y}^{M}\\), unlike \\({Y}^{I}\\) mostly made of labor-intensive activities, will benefit from science innovations and technological progress: the famous Magic flute by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart still requires the same amount of resources (time, performers, space, etc.) nowadays as in 1791, when it was first performed. Absent any change in preferences, the Baumol effect states that the size of the second sector should constantly decrease over time. However, the first sector produces essential goods where the second sector produces luxury goods, implying that the relative demand for the arts would actually increase and this prevents the arts sector from continuously declining and eventually disappear.\n\nAdditional notations can help visualize this. Materialistic goods and services are produced by combining a set of inputs \\({\\mathscr{B}}\\) featuring the economy and business, which, for simplicity, include labor and capital. The level of total factor productivity \\({\\mathscr{A}}\\) combines the various outputs of science, education, technology and discoveries of all kinds denoted by \\({\\mathscr{B}}\\):\n\n$${Y}^{M}={\\mathscr{A}}f({\\mathscr{B}}).$$\n\n(1)\n\nwhile the second component \\({Y}^{I}\\) mostly depends on the number of famous individuals in creative activities. Last, the consumption vector \\(\\overrightarrow{{\\mathscr{C}}}=({C}^{M},\\,{C}^{I}{)}^{{\\rm{{\\prime} }}}\\) is only a fraction \\((1-\\tau )\\) of the amount of global wealth as follows:\n\n$$\\overrightarrow{{\\mathscr{C}}}=\\overrightarrow{{\\mathscr{C}}}[(1-\\tau )({Y}^{M}+{Y}^{I})],$$\n\n(2)\n\nwhere \\((1-\\tau )\\) is typically determined by the way a society is governed by politicians, military, religious authorities, noble people, and τ is an administration tax, featuring more or less efficient societies and resources diversion10. The demand function \\(\\overrightarrow{{\\mathscr{C}}}\\) is such that the first dimension (M) is a necessity good and the second dimension (I) gets a higher demand as income and wealth grow. This framework will help us understand long-run trends in the relative importance of different fields among notable individuals: each broad occupation defined later in the data will be associated with one of the theoretical concepts from the paragraphs above.\n\nPreview of the data\n\nThe database is organized as follows: each row corresponds to one individual, with a name and the unique identifier (section Extracting raw data from Wikidata and Wikipedia), the birth date and gender (section Demographics: birth, death and gender), an imputation if missing, a range if known from a decade or century, up to two fields called domains of influence and an estimated weight for each domain (section Domains of influence and occupations), birthplace and death place, longitude and latitude (section Data records), a proxy for citizenship (section Citizenship) and a notability index calculated from 5 variables (section Measuring notability). The sample choice is described in section Extracting biographic information from a restricted sample.\n\nExtracting raw data from Wikidata and Wikipedia\n\nTo build the most comprehensive, reliable database about notable individuals, and organize it in a way that can be later used by social scientists, we consider two main sources of information: information from Wikidata and information contained in 7 language editions of Wikipedia. We extract key information on humans present either in one or both sources, and then merge this information to avoid 1) dealing with duplicate individuals and 2) cross-verify the information contained in both universes.\n\nWikipedia\n\nThis paper uses a bottom-up procedure based on Wikipedia categories. Categories are commonly used in Wikipedia to link articles under a common topic and are found at the bottom of the page. All existing categories about individuals were systematically analyzed and retrieved by scraping. Using the relevant urls corresponding to human biographies, we scraped the 7 following Wikipedia language editions: English, French, German, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese and Swedish that we call hereafter the European editions. Within the sample of individuals with at least one biography in the 7 language editions, 52.8% have 1 biography, 18.1% have 2 biographies (cumulative 70.9%), 8.7% have 3 biographies (cumulative 79.6%), 5% have 4 biographies (cumulative 87.8%) and 12.2% have 5 biographies or more. See Appendix A for a detailed description of the method.\n\nWikidata\n\nIn the Wikidata universe, we use the “instance of humans” Q5 category to define our sample of individuals. Information such as first name, family name, gender, country of citizenship, date of birth, date of death (if applicable), domain of influence, as well as the Q code (identifier) of the individual are retrieved. In addition to this first set of variables, we also extract the exhaustive list of Wikipedia urls contained in each Wikidata entry, to deal with multiple biographies as explained below. We also collect the sources behind the Wikidata page, used in Figure S7 in Appendix.\n\nMerging Wikidata and Wikipedia\n\nWikidata and Wikipedia contradict each other on key information about notable individuals. Considering 7 different Wikipedia editions, instead of one, naturally increases that heterogeneity. In this paper, we use this feature to improve the reliability of each information extracted from both repositories. To do so, we develop and use in what follows a series of algorithms to i) come up with a relevant sample of humans, ii) eliminate duplicate biographies, iii) detect systematic errors contained either in Wikipedia or Wikidata and correct them.\n\nHumans and non-humans\n\nA large number of entries are wrongly identified as humans in Wikidata because they contain the Q5 code which stands for ‘instance of humans’ but some may not be humans. The same issue arises in Wikipedia: there are non-humans despite being identified as humans. These entries are either biblical, mythological, fictional characters, animals, music bands, events, murder cases, etc. We use a list of expressions such as “murder of”, “list of”, “duos”, “bands”, “attack of”, etc. to detect such cases. Let us illustrate the difficulty with a few examples. https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q656193 is an example of a page of a real human in the Czech edition of Wikipedia linked to fictional characters, yet as of the time of data extraction, wrongly classified as a human. A slightly more ambiguous case is that of https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1278485, a possibly fictional character subject of a story in Ancient Rome - and in any event the pages describe the person as a fictional character, while she is classified as human in Wikidata. In total, we identify 20,000 entries corresponding to 16,000 questionable “pseudo-individuals” that we eliminate from our database.\n\nDealing with multiple biographies\n\nBy construction, a given individual has a maximum of eight observations in the database once merged: 7 Wikipedia biographies plus one Wikidata entry. There are several cases to consider to eliminate duplicate observations from this universe of around 6.3 million biographies/entries. The most common situation is one individual present in Wikidata and in at least one of the 7 language editions of Wikipedia with one unique identifier present in both universes. In such situations, we eliminate duplicates by checking whether i) the links present in the Wikipedia section of each Wikidata biography correspond to each other and ii) the Wikidata links retrieved from the “Tools” section of each Wikipedia biography correspond to each other; there are indeed sometimes inconsistencies between these sources. We wrote a batch file to manually modify about 2000 Wikidata identifiers out of 4.7 millions not available at the time of scraping.\n\nTreating duplicates\n\nIn addition, a given individual may have more than one biography either a) within the same Wikipedia edition or b) across different editions without any explicit link between these duplicate biographies or c) in Wikidata and/or Wikipedia under different Q codes (identifiers), due to the large number of contributors. Some of them may fail to detect or ignore the work of others. As an example, Sarendy Vong has two separate biographies in the English edition: https://en.Wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarendy_Vong and https://en.Wikipedia.org/wiki/Vong_Sarendy. Appendix A.2 provides further details about this methodology. We eventually removed 0.7% of individuals (34,562/4,678,040). Although we cannot claim we eliminated all duplicates, we adopted a conservative approach in multiplying the number of tests we have run and rather eliminated false duplicates than keeping true duplicates.\n\nExhaustive sample: descriptive statistics\n\nWikipedia: comparing language editions\n\nThe 5 most popular language editions in Wikipedia in number of biographies are, in decreasing order, 1) English, 2) German, 3) Japanese, 4) French and 5) Russian. Considering the German edition after English adds 340,913 individuals (of which 259,013 individuals have a unique biography in German). It is worth noting here that these 340,913 individuals would have been ignored without considering the German edition. In the exhaustive sample, the Japanese edition brings 179,466 new individuals, the French edition adds 155,391 individuals, the Russian edition adds 156,728 individuals. The full list of incremental additions is available in Table S2 in Appendix A.5 and provides a better sense of the relative importance of each language edition.\n\nMain sample characteristics\n\nOverall, we gather information about 4,678,040 distinct and unique notable individuals out of their 6,291,767 multiple biographies extracted from 7 different Wikipedia language editions and Wikidata. There are 2,291,817 individuals (49%) with at least one biography in Wikipedia along with a Wikidata entry. In addition, there are 2,386,223 notable individuals (51%) with a Wikidata entry but no existence in the 7 European Wikipedia language editions.\n\nTable 1 collapses these famous individuals in 6 groups to help us figure out the respective contribution of both Wikidata and Wikipedia. In subsequent columns, we display similar statistics for different individual profiles according to their popularity in Wikipedia, in particular those with at least one biography among the 7 European language editions (described above) and at least 14 language editions (Pantheon 2.0). Each row corresponds to a specific language group, not based on a linguistic classification but mostly on geography to capture the socioeconomic groups formed around empires and trade areas: English (individuals with at least one biography in the English edition), Western (individuals with one biography in a language part of the Western world but not English), Eastern (individuals with an edition that is part of the eastern world but not English/Western), Eurasia-Arabia (individuals with an edition that is part of the Eurasia-Arabia world but not English/Western/Eastern), Southern and natives (individuals with an edition that is part of the Southern/natives world but not English/Western/Eastern/Eurasia-Arabia), and Wikidata only (individuals with one Wikidata entry but no existence in the Wikipedia universe). Table S2 in Appendix shows the diversity of languages and the number of new individuals brought by language editions. However, we will only consider those individuals from pages we could analyze, e.g. wih a biography in one at least of the 7 language editions analyzed.\n\nThe exhaustive sample (Table 1, column 1) contains 1,578,917 individuals in the first group (English), 1,327,543 in the second group (Western non-English). The third, fourth and fifth groups correspond to 342,783; 223,213 and 4,249 notables from the Eastern, Eurasia-Arabia and Southern/natives worlds respectively. The last group which is made of individuals with one Wikidata entry only represents around 1/4th of all individuals.\n\nThe information present in existing databases are based on the English edition of Wikipedia only1,2. This project, by considering other language editions and Wikidata, almost triples the universe of notable individuals as follows: Western languages (+27.0%), Eastern languages (+7.3%), Eurasian-Asian languages (+4.8%) and Southern & native languages (0.1%), Wikidata (+25.7%). Considering 6 additional language editions results in 3,099,123 newly detected in the exhaustive sample.\n\nMeasuring notability\n\nMany individuals have low visibility and sparse information. To disentangle the most visible from the less visible, we build a synthetic notability index using five dimensions to figure out a ranking for this broader set of individuals. These dimensions are:\n\n1.\n\nthe number of Wikipedia editions of each individual;\n\n2.\n\nthe length, i.e total number of words found in all available biographies. It is equal to zero for individuals with just one Wikidata entry and no biography in Wikipedia;\n\n3.\n\nthe average number of biography views (hits) for each individual between 2015 and 2018 in all available language editions, using an API available in https://wikitech.wikimedia.org/wiki/Analytics/AQS/Pageviews or zero in the absence of a Wikipedia biography;\n\n4.\n\nthe number of non-missing items retrieved from Wikipedia or Wikidata for birth date, gender and domain of influence. The intuition here is that the more notable the individual, the more documented his/her biographies will be;\n\n5.\n\nthe total number of external links (sources, references, etc.) from Wikidata.\n\nWe then determine the quantile values from each dimension and add them all to define our notability measure that is used to compare/rank individuals over time and across space. Arguably, it is harder to compare individuals born in different centuries and we will not present any of these comparisons, since it tends to favor individuals born recently2. Alternative choices for the weights of the sub-components can be made depending on the question that is tackled. We also reiterate that even within centuries or within domains of influence, pairwise comparisons make little sense and the notability index is more of a weight to statistically assess the influence or identify large groups of influence (e.g. by quintile of notability index). This being said, Table 2 shows the 10 most renowned individuals per period and gender. Examples of the most famous individuals present in the English edition are Barack Obama, Cristiano Ronaldo or Albert Einstein. Figure S5 in Appendix displays a cloud of the top 3000 individuals and suggests biases in gender (very few women), fields (large representation of culture and notability against for instance business) and historical periods (contemporaneity bias) that we address next. Other language groups naturally include lesser-known individuals like French film director Olivier Nakache (Western), Japanese actor Ryō Iwamatsu (Eastern), scientist Qayum Nasıyri (Eurasia-Arabia), former writer Boerneef (Southern & natives) and art historian Martin Hardie present in Wikidata only. Table S3 in Appendix shows the 5 most famous individuals in each recursive language group. These individuals have achieved a lower level of international recognition but may have had a significant impact at the local level, in their own country, region or city. In the rest of the paper, we explore how these “newly added” individuals differ from those present in the English edition on a few dimensions such as year of birth/death, gender, occupation or citizenship. In particular, the Section Historical trends will systematically show the contribution of different samples (e.g. Fig. 3 or the right part of Fig. 4 and subsequent Figures).\n\nExtracting biographic information from a restricted sample\n\nAs reported in Appendix Section B.3, information about lesser-known individuals is quite often sparse and does not allow to apply our cross-verification technique in a satisfactory way to detect systematic errors contained either in Wikipedia or in Wikidata and correct them. This is the reason why we decided to focus on a sub-sample of individuals with at least one biography among the 7 European language editions of Wikipedia we selected.\n\nWe use this sample to highlight the difference between the English edition (used in existing projects) and the other editions and document a potential Anglo-Saxon bias. As displayed in column 2 of Table 1, this sample contains information about 2,291,817 notable individuals with at least one biography among the universe of Wikipedia editions we considered (7 European language editions enumerated above) plus a Wikidata entry.\n\nDemographics: birth, death and gender\n\nWe consider all personal (he/she) and possessive (his/her) pronouns present in the first part of each available Wikipedia biography to figure out a gender for each individual. In case both masculine and feminine pronouns are detected, we use the one that appears first in the biography to determine the individual’s gender. We then compared it to the one extracted from Wikidata, when reported. A fraction of 0.03% of the restricted database has an “Other” gender (609 individuals), corresponding mostly to transgender persons (e.g. https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q57585712) or non-binary persons (e.g. https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q55237966).\n\nWe keep the gender information present in Wikidata when both sources contradict each other. In case the information is missing in one universe, we use the gender found in the other source when available.\n\nWhen the birth and death information is present in both sources, we first determine the most recurring year among the different available (up to 7) language editions of Wikipedia, and compare it with the year extracted from Wikidata when reported. When there is a conflict between different sources, we give priority to Wikidata. See Appendix A6 for details. There are a few cases of super centenarians, allegedly known as having lived more than 120 years. The only case where we deleted the birth date is Trailanga (1607–1887).\n\nWe next calculate the number of living individuals in a given year in the database. This is represented in Appendix Figure S3. There is an exponential evolution of the sample size over time. The ratio of the number of notable individuals in the restricted sample over the world population (from two different estimates11,12) is not constant: as illustrated in Appendix Figure S2, the ratio of the number of famous people alive at a given point in time to the world population increased from 500BC to 1950. The ratio was around 1 over 250,000 in the Antiquity and is 1 over 3,000 in 1950. Under the assumption that the fraction of “famous individuals” is constant throughout history, one can calculate the rate at which these were forgotten. Details of the calculation can be found in Appendix A.4. Under the assumption that people are forgotten at rate b, the fraction of famous people forgotten relative to total population is \\(1-{(1-b)}^{T}\\) where T is distance to present. The value of b is estimated in Appendix and corresponds to 15.2% each century, or 56.1% after 500 years, or 80.8 % after 1000 years. Therefore, it is likely that a large number of individuals who should have been remembered given their achievement are currently not listed in the database, again under the assumption that the detection threshold of the recent period should have been applied since the start of our sample. In Appendix Figures S3 and S4, we show the time evolution of the sample size and its distribution across the English, Western, Eastern, Eurasia-Arabia, Southern & natives language groups from the exhaustive dataset.\n\nDomains of influence and occupations\n\nWe proceed the same way as for dates, and systematically compare the information collected from Wikipedia and Wikidata to figure out the domain of influence, the sector of activity or the field where notable individuals are meant to have had an impact. The list of occupations is reported below. The choice of the categories is based on the theory representation developed in the above Section “A social science framework”, differentiating producers of material/commercial goods and services, the producers of ideas or art, and the producers of administration services, security and rules. The choices turn out to be largely consistent with other typologies for most occupations2 and culture13. The “Other” section regroups individuals whose notability originates from i) a direct link with notable individuals e.g, the children of a ruler who themselves did not rule) ii) an occupation that is not classified in culture (e.g. librarian) or iii) only for their negative notorious acts (e.g. criminal, serial killer). When multiple occupations can be extracted from a maximum of 7 sources, we adopt a frequentist approach, using the mode and the frequencies of competing occupations to select a main one and sometimes a secondary one, as discussed in Appendix B.1.\n\nDiscovery/Science (contributes mostly to total factor productivity \\({\\mathscr{A}}\\)):\n\nAcademia (Research, Historian, Physician, Scientist, Academic, etc.)\n\nExplorer (Engineer, Explorer, Inventor, Sailor, Pioneer, etc.)\n\nCulture (contributes mostly to immaterial goods and services \\({Y}^{I}\\))\n\nCore (Actor, Writer, Painter, Singer, Music, etc.)\n\nPeriphery (Journalist, Architect, Model, Designer, Presenter, etc.) (may also contribute to business/econ inputs \\({\\mathscr{B}}\\))\n\nLeadership (contributes mostly to the organization of society and reduce the administration cost τ) or raise it through rent-seeking activities\n\nPolitics (Politician, Activist, Revolutionary, Trade unionist, Minister, etc.)\n\nMilitary (Military, Officer, Commander, Soldier, Army, etc.)\n\nLaw (Lawyer, Diplomat, Judge, Jurist, Civil service)\n\nNobility (Aristocrat, Noble, King, Sovereign, Monarch, etc.)\n\nReligious (Priest, Prelate, Rabbi, Missionary, Bishop, etc.)\n\nCorporate Leadership (Business, Entrepreneur, Bank, Merchant, Manager, etc.) (may also contribute to \\({\\mathscr{B}}\\))\n\nSports/Games (Football, Player, Sport, Baseball, Basket, etc.) (contributes mostly to \\({Y}^{I}\\) but also to \\({\\mathscr{B}}\\))\n\nOther\n\nWorker (Farmer, Librarian, Musher, Bookseller, Printer, etc.) (contribute mostly to \\({\\mathscr{B}}\\))\n\nFamily (Son, Daughter, Child, Wife of, Father, etc.)\n\nMisc. (Esperantist, Criminal, Convict, Killer, Philanthropist, etc.)\n\nFigure 1 describes the relative importance of domains of influence in the restricted sample described above. Interestingly, the four most popular domains are, in decreasing order: Culture (30.6%), Sports/Games (27.7%), Leadership (27.0%), Discovery/Science (11.9%) and Other (2.1%). People that are most remembered in Wikipedia have specialized in sectors producing non-materialistic goods and services and thus contribute to \\({Y}^{I}\\) and to a much lower extent to \\({Y}^{M}\\). In the Culture category, the vast majority of individuals with a biography had or still have a career in one of the many core cultural industries (26.4%) and more sporadically in the peripheral cultural industries (4.2%). The Leadership category is dominated by Politicians (14.2%), Military (3.2%), Lawyers (3.2%), Religious faces (3.1%), Corporate leaders (2%) and Nobles (1.7%). The academic sector (11.1%) dominates the Discovery/Science category. Explorers correspond to a minor part of this category (1.1%).\n\nFigure 2 shows the time evolution of the share of these different domains. We clearly see on this graph the prominent role played by religious figures and the military until the beginning of the 15th century, a slow rise in Academia, Politics and Culture afterwards, and the rapid rise of a new entertainment category, Sport and Game over the 20th century that even become dominant after 1950. This trend corresponds to another trend, the secular rise in leisure and the decline in hours worked over the last two centuries14 due to a combination of technical progress sustaining living standards and leisure and many other immaterial goods being luxury goods.\n\nCitizenship\n\nFor citizenships, we collect and then compare the information available from both Wikipedia and Wikidata. From Wikipedia, we retrieve up to two citizenships per language edition, based on the current name of the country therefore summing to a maximum of 14 possible citizenships. We keep the two most frequent citizenships of this pool and compare them to Wikidata. The comparison group from Wikidata retains a list of up to 10 citizenships. We group these citizenships into meaningful entities that are not necessarily time-invariant: e.g. entities such as “Allemagne”, “Berlin”, etc. are clubbed under Germany, “Ting Dynasty”, “Ming Dynasty”, “Song Dynasty”, etc. are clubbed under Old regimes in China, “Russian Empire”, “Tsardom of Russia”, “Grand Duchy of Moscow”, etc. are clubbed under Old Russia, “First French Republic”, “Second French Republic”, “Third French Republic”, etc. are clubbed under France. For individuals living in the modern state, we retain the name of the modern entity, for e.g. for a person who lives or have lived under today’s People’s Republic of China, the reported citizenship is simply China. We also keep three empires, Holy Roman Empire, Roman Empire and Soviet Union in these aggregate groups. We skipped extremely unfrequent citizenships such as Chenla Kingdom, Sultanate of Hobyo, Lordship of Carpi etc. that were not aggregated with our main citizenship (0.004% of those with a citizenship only).\n\nIn 95% of cases, Wikidata and Wikipedia gave the same citizenship. When they instead contradict each other, we adopt a decision rule detailed in Appendix B.2 giving higher priority to information present in the Infoboxes from Wikipedia and Wikidata. To classify individuals under the old regimes v.s. the current state, we exploit the information on acquisition of sovereignty of modern state. We use information available on the collapse of empires such as the Holy Roman Empire or the Soviet Union to correctly classify individuals into these supranational entities. Finally, a fraction of individuals may have several citizenships and we report two of them if relevant.\n\nHistorical trends\n\nAdditional editions we analyzed beyond English provide a broader and finer coverage of some key periods in human history and social trends. We review here only a small number of examples of interest for the sake of conciseness. With a few emblematic historical events in mind, we ask whether the database could quantitatively illustrate these periods.\n\nFrom Dark Ages to the Modern age: the rise of notable women\n\nFigure 3 reports the time evolution of the share of female individuals. It exhibits a U-shape pattern with a local minimum at around 5–10% of female individuals around 1750. At the end of the observation period, the share of female individuals ranges between 20% (Africa) and 30% (Asia and Oceania). The main reason for this rising share in the database is the growing influence of two categories, Sports and Culture, that are much more balanced across genders than categories such as Governance/Executive and Academics. If the share of women is higher in the English edition over the entire sample period (see statistics in Table S4), the Western non-English edition further mitigates the bias after 1950, with a sample average close to 27% of women, as opposed to a 22.5% in the English edition.\n\nPolitics and the emergence of modern democracy\n\nFigure 4 documents the number of individuals associated with politics. This illustrates the rise of American politics in the second half of the 18th century at the time with the birth of the independent nation of the USA, as shown in the left panel of Fig. 4. The same holds true for France: at that time, the share of French and US politicians in our database is rising in a significant way around and after the end of the 18th century. While the emergence of modern democracy in those countries is noticeable on this graph, the main feature here is the dark blue part in the 16th century in British Islands, which saw the gradual integration of the four kingdoms of England, Wales, Scotland and Ireland. Many historians consider that central elements of modernity, of capitalism, industry, and science, originated in early modern Britain (circa 1500–1750)15,16. In the right panel, we display the relative importance of different language editions other than English - see e.g. the importance of red bars featuring individuals not present in the English edition of Wikipedia. This is particularly large for French individuals (80% individuals), and true for other citizenships including Italians (+70%), Germans (+85%), Portuguese (+70%) and Spanish (+65%) individuals. For this specific occupation (politics), restricting the sample to English pages would drastically change the relative importance of citizenships, for instance almost entirely removing French politicians and considerably expanding English and US ones.\n\nThe age of exploration and discoveries\n\nFigure 5 (left panel) shows the share of individuals in the Explorer Inventor Developer category by citizenship. It illustrates the end of the chinese exploration period which lasted until the 15th century followed by the European age of discovery and explorations conducted by Portugal and Spain in the 15th and 16th centuries.\n\nThese two European waves of exploration are imperfectly covered by the English edition. In the right panel, the fraction of these individuals (red bar) not included in the reference edition ranges between 10% and 15% for Portugal and Spain, respectively. The Chinese exploration benefits from a better coverage in the English edition. The contribution of the present project is even more striking when one considers the share of individuals not present in existing projects (pink and red bars). At the margin, we add almost 75% and 80% of the Portuguese and Spanish individuals of the category here. The dark green peak on the graph corresponds to the French Renaissance period (between the 15th and early 17th centuries). This important period of human history is not covered in a satisfactory way in the English edition again and therefore in existing projects. The share of individuals retrieved with the French citizenship in editions other than English is at around 25% (red bar). If we add to this the fraction of individuals ignored so far in existing databases (65%) we can conclude that we improve coverage by almost 90%. A similar pattern is observed for Italians earlier during the Italian renaissance period which spans from the end of the 14th century (Trecento) to the early 16th century (Cinquecento). Indeed, in the figure, a thick band of light green is visible over the entire period. It becomes thinner thereafter. The emergence of the US is also noticeable over the 20th century, when many inventors and creative people of all kinds were attracted thanks to a favorable immigration system aligned with a dynamic academic sector. We indeed observe this increasing share (light blue) of the US during that period in the category. These individuals all have a biography in English, but were missed by more selective databases: around 90% or more of these individuals were present in less than 14 Wikipedia editions.\n\nConjecture: the role of science and politics in escaping the Malthusian trap\n\nTheories of long run economic growth17,18 explain that the main reasons for escaping the Malthusian trap (where improvement due to technical progress allows population increases but no change in income per capita) are due to the accumulation of latent factors such as human capital and the evolution of political regimes around 1750AD in Western countries. A first insight could be derived from Fig. 2 where, in the two centuries before that year, one observes a rise of Academia and Politics, and a decline in Religion and Nobility. In Fig. 6, we take a closer look at the UK, the country leading the Industrial Revolution. The figure shows two distinct regimes of GDP per capita growth after the initial Malthusian stagnation: a first economic expansion in the late 17th and 18th century, that follows a century of a latent relative expansion of “Politics” with Nobility declining instead; a second regime of the Industrial Revolution of the early 19th century, which is preceded by the latent relative expansion of science and the arts. An overlook at other countries (unreported) suggests that similar patterns emerge with a particularly strong role of the composition of the leadership category which contains Nobility, Religion, Military and Politics. Previous economic history work19 offers a detailed review of the arguments in favor of the emergence of new technologies and the respective role of Enlightment vs. trade and profitability argument to explain the economic take-offs.\n\nGeolocalisation\n\nUsing longitudes and latitudes of birth and death places, one can track the evolution of the global geographical centers of the database. Fig. 7 represents the ellipse of the variance-covariance matrix of longitudes and latitudes of birthplaces at different periods of time (40% of the sample population lies within each ellipse). Fig. 8 represents the birth to death flows and generalizes early pioneering works1,2. The higher granularity of our database allows us to cover less explored destinations or smaller geographical divisions. Going from the 150,000 individuals in earlier studies to 2.3 million individuals in our case allows us to cover migration outflows of, e.g. artists who left Italy to emigrate in numbers to South America, or scientists who left the UK to live in North America. We can also represent intra-Asian migration flows which is mostly within countries contrary to inter-country European flows.\n\nOutreach"
