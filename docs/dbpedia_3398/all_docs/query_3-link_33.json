I had always been interested in a small town practice and left to start a practice in Shakopee that included a lot of hospital work. After doing that for about 15 years, I joined the hospitalist group at North Memorial Hospital in Minneapolis for 8 years which included taking care of many very complicated and critical patients. I have worked extensively in multiple ERs throughout Minnesota early in my career and love the unpredictability and intensity of those patients in addition to taking care of patients who are in the intensive care unit (ICU). I am excited to join the Department of Medicine again to work with the residents as after practicing internal medicine in a large variety of settings, I think I have had a broad swath of experience and knowledge to pass on to residents and students in the dawn of their careers.\n\nTeaching Summary\n\nCritical thinking and analysis of the diagnostic approach to complicated patients\n\nAnne Bantle\n\n, MD\n\nAssistant Professor of Medicine, Division of Diabetes, Endocrinology and Metabolism\n\nView full bio\n\nThis is a dialog window which overlays the main content of the page.

Dr. Begnaud has an interest in the diagnosis and treatment of lung cancer. An inaugural diplomat of the American Association of Bronchology and Interventional Pulmonology, she is trained in advanced diagnostic and therapeutic procedures, as well as general pulmonary and critical care medicine. She collaborated to launch the University of Minnesota Health Lung Cancer Screening Program and continues to oversee all its activities.Research interests include implementation and dissemination of lung cancer screening and use of lung cancer screening to reduce health disparities in lung cancer. She is studying how incidental findings of lung cancer screening impact the overall benefit of this health service.\n\nResearch Summary\n\nDr. Abbie Begnaud hails from Louisiana and arrived at the University of Minnesota in 2013.

He joined the Division of Hematology, Oncology and Transplantation in 1996. Dr. Belcher's research has been integral to a series of important discoveries demonstrating heme is central to the pathobiology of sickle cell anemia. Dr. Belcher's laboratory work is committed to the successful translation of laboratory discoveries to clinical care.\n\nResearch Summary\n\nDr. Belcher's research is focused on hemoglobin, heme, and iron toxicity to the endothelium, as well as related cytoprotective responses. Currently, he is investigating heme-mediated inflammation, vaso-occlusion, and pain in sickle cell anemia through toll-like receptor-4 signaling and complement activation. His research is also exploring the cytoprotective effects of hemopexin, BACH1 inhibitors, heme oxygenase-1 inducers, oral carbon monoxide, and complement inhibitors as therapies to prevent vascular occlusions and pain in sickle cell disease.

We are using a combination of tools to understand the basic mechanisms by which the lung repairs itself. A goal of these studies is to predict outcomes in lung diseases and develop therapeutic interventions to modify mortality. Since its initial description in 1967, Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) has remained a frequent cause of respiratory failure requiring supportive care in the intensive care unit. Our laboratory is using state-of-the-art tools to perform the large-scale study of proteins in cases with ARDS, to identify the biological processes and pathways that are selectively activated in cases that survive. We expect that these studies will result in novel therapy in ARDS by identifying the biological process that participate in lung repair. We are also pursuing studies in Idiopathic Pneumonia Syndrome, a non-infectious form of lung injury that occurs in blood and marrow transplant recipients. We are also collecting biological specimens from patients with Sarcoidosis. Our goal is to characterize comprehensively the protein profile in these patients and begin to understand why Sarcoidosis has such varied clinical presentation, response to treatment and unpredictable course. These studies are designed to develop biomarkers that will inform us about diagnosis and prognosis in Sarcoidosis. In collaboration with investigators at the Center for Magnetic Resonance Research, we have applied the novel SWIFT-MRI algorithm in imaging of lung tissue. These studies performed in an experimental model of ARDS show promising findings that we expect to translate in human subjects with acute and chronic lung disease.\n\nClinical Summary\n\nPulmonary Sarcoidosis; Interstitial Lung Diseases; Medical Critical Care; Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS)\n\nArchana Bhaskaran\n\n, MBBS\n\nAssistant Professor of Medicine, Division of Infectious Diseases and International Medicine\n\nView full bio\n\nThis is a dialog window which overlays the main content of the page.
