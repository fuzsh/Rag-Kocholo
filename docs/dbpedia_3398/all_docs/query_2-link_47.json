        "text": "Drive the motorways of Northern Europe and you could often be forgiven for thinking it’s a bland sort of place with little to interest the sightseer or indeed anyone who likes to delve into scenery, culture and the past. But take the exit roads and motor for a few miles and you can easily come across hidden gems which will take your breath away.\n\nThe region of Lower Saxony in northern Germany is a case in point. Its autobahns are many and they are bland - but take one of those ausfahrt signs and you can soon be wandering through the medieval streets of some of the most outstanding towns in Europe - many of which will have direct connections to kings, queens and others who have change the annals of history\n\nVisiting Celle\n\nAs I ambled through the narrow cobblestone streets of Celle one Sunday morning recently that certainly rang true. The town seemed to whisper its many secrets in my ear, serenading the soul with tales of days gone by. This picturesque gem, nestled snugly in the heart of Lower Saxony, seemed to have an aura of magic about it - or, to put it another way, it could have been a Grimm’s a fairytale sprung to life.\n\nCelle has amazing ancient timber-framed houses like Manhattan has skyscrapers. They stand tall and proud - their facades adorned with intricate carvings and vibrant flowers. Old beams are painted a veritable tapestry of reds, blues, and yellows, and the overall effect suggests some dreamed up version of an older more pleasant Europe.\n\nCelle’s Connection with the British Royal Family\n\nThe castle’s connection to the British royals began in 1676 when Prince George William of Brunswick-Lüneburg, the son of the Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg, married Princess Anne of Great Britain, the daughter of King James II of England. As part of her dowry, Anne brought with her a significant collection of artwork and furnishings, which were used to decorate the castle.\n\nThe Hanoverians were descendants of the Stuart dynasty, which ruled England, Scotland, and Ireland from 1603 to 1714. When Queen Anne, the last of the Stuarts, died without an heir, the crown passed to her closest Protestant relative, who was the Elector of Hanover, George Louis. He became King George I of Great Britain and Ireland in 1714 and established the House of Hanover as the ruling dynasty of Britain. Many members of the Hanoverian family were born or raised at Celle Castle, including George II, who was born there in 1683.\n\nIt was an important residence for the Hanoverian monarchs, and was often used as a hunting lodge and a summer retreat. The castle's stunning architecture and beautifully landscaped gardens provided the perfect setting for the family's leisure activities.\n\nToday, Celle Castle is open to the public as a museum and cultural centre where visitors can learn about the history of the Hanoverians and their links to Britain's royal family. The castle's Hall of Ancestors contains a collection of portraits of the Hanoverian monarchs, including George I, George II, and Queen Victoria.\n\nAs you can see in the two photos above - on our British Guild of Travel Writers visit, our colleague Rupert Parker was made king for the day in the castle - King Rupert the Last is what we call him now…\n\nVisitors can also explore the castle's expansive gardens, which are beautifully landscaped and offer breathtaking views of the surrounding countryside.\n\nThe Town of Celle\n\nBack in town the Castle Theatre - Europe's oldest Baroque theatre - is still in use, bearing testament to the town's rich cultural history."
