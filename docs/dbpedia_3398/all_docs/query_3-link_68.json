        "text": "Sandra has worked for the Kaiser Permanente School of Anesthesia for the last 18 years as an Administrative Specialist III. Sandra attended Ashford University where she completed her baccalaureate in Business Information Systems in 2014 and her MBA in 2015. Sandra provides clerical support to the faculty and students and assists with new student onboarding and the transition of our KP SRNAs into the workforce.\n\nKaiser Permanente South Bay Medical Center\n\nChief Medical Advisor, Kaiser Permanente School of Anesthesia\n\nClinical Faculty, California State University, Fullerton\n\nAlexander is a second-generation anesthesiologist. His path to anesthesiology began in high school, when he would attend grand rounds at UC San Francisco with his father. He always knew he wanted to be a physician and started as a hospital volunteer in high school. Later, he worked summers and evenings during the school year at Kaiser Permanente as an anesthesia technician. He finished his undergraduate studies in three years from Stanford University and took another year to pursue a master’s degree in biological sciences.\n\nAlexander attended medical school and completed his anesthesia residency at UC San Francisco. He was President of AMSA during his time at UCSF and participated in lobbying for health issues in Washington, DC. While at UCSF, he was also involved in research on thermo-regulation during anesthesia. Alexander received a grant from Chinese Hospital of SF and presented his research on obstetrical outcomes in the San Francisco Chinese population.\n\nKaiser Permanente Orange County (Anaheim / Irvine)\n\nAssociate Medical Advisor, Kaiser Permanente School of Anesthesia\n\nClinical Faculty, California State University, Fullerton\n\nHello! I began my role as Chief of Anesthesiology in Orange County (Anaheim and Irvine) in December 2019. Previously, I was Physician-In-Charge (PIC) of the OC-Irvine Main OR’s and before that PIC of Sand Canyon SurgiCenter. I have been with Kaiser Permanente since 2006 right after finishing my Pediatric Anesthesiology fellowship at Children’s Hospital L.A. I trained at UCI for Anesthesia residency before that and UCI College of Medicine for Medical School. Most importantly, I attended USC for undergrad, majoring in Biological Sciences and Minoring in Spanish. Fight On! I immigrated from Iran with my parents when I was eight years old. We lived in Florida and eventually moved to California when I was 12 years old. My wife Sharon is Korean-American and we have a young son named Cyrus. We have two white Siberian Huskies who I mush with. I enjoy practicing Zen Buddhism, reading, traveling, playing golf, and photography."
