        "text": "Atlantic pre-empts new book by multi-million-bestselling author Rolf Dobelli\n\nAtlantic Books has pre-empted The Not To Do List: 52 Laws for Avoiding Life’s Biggest Mistakes by Rolf Dobelli, author of the 3-million-copy bestseller The Art of Thinking Clearly.\n\nDrummond Moir, Managing Director, acquired UK & Commonwealth rights for Atlantic’s Allen & Unwin UK imprint from Elisabeth Wiedemann at Piper. The book will be published in February 2025.\n\nTranslation rights were also sold to Het Spectrum in the Netherlands and Business Weekly in Taiwan. The German edition will be published in October 2024 in time for the Frankfurt Book Fair.\n\nRolf Dobelli said:\n\n‘The Art of Thinking Clearly revealed the cognitive biases to avoid for better decision-making; in my new book I’ll reveal the habits to avoid for better living – from pitfalls to avoid in your career, to the biggest mistakes we make when it comes to maintaining relationships and creating a meaningful life. This is an inversion of life advice, because happiness and success are easier than you think – just don’t do these 52 things!’\n\nDrummond Moir said:\n\n‘We’re thrilled that Rolf has chosen to come to Atlantic at a time of great momentum for our Allen & Unwin UK imprint. We’ve seen sales of The Courage to Be Disliked increase by 1000% year on year, and have signed up several other exciting books for the imprint including Finnish philosopher Frank Martela’s Stop Chasing Happiness: Counterintuitive Life Advice from the World’s Happiest Country and Bryanna Kappadakunnel’s Parent Yourself First: Becoming the Parent You Wish You’d Had. The Not To Do List will be a key focus for our 2025 publishing, and we can’t wait to bring Rolf’s brilliant new book to readers around the world’."
