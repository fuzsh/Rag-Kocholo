        "text": "EARLIEST MUSICAL MEMORY:My parents are musicians so I grew up hearing music every day at home. I began studying percussion at age six. My dad took me to the opera house and sat me in the pit between the two timpanists. I fell in love with the timpani — and Stravinsky’s The Rite of Spring.\n\nWHEN DID YOU KNOW THAT YOU WANTED TO BE A PROFESSIONAL MUSICIAN?When I was 13: I got into a youth orchestra and played Holst’s The Planets. I was finally among people who thought and felt the same way I did.\n\nWHO WAS YOUR MOST IMPORTANT MUSICAL INFLUENCE?My timpani teacher, David Punto, at the College of Arts, Berlin\n\nWHAT DO YOU LIKE TO DO OUTSIDE OF WORK?I like diving in remote islands with incredible biodiversity. I’ve dived off Micronesia, Thailand, and Borneo. I also ride my motorcycle: once in a while, I like to escape the craziness of the city.\n\nMOST INSPIRING COMPOSERS:The Russians — Shostakovich, Stravinsky, Prokofiev — and Richard Strauss and Béla Bartók, who both wrote amazing parts for the timpani\n\nIF YOU COULD PLAY ANOTHER INSTRUMENT, WHAT WOULD IT BE?I used to play the cello, from ages 11 to 14. I still love the piano.\n\nWHAT HAVE YOU BEEN LISTENING TO LATELY?The Miles Davis stations on Pandora and Spotify. My dad’s a trumpet player, and I love the instrument.\n\nTELL US ABOUT YOUR FAMILY:My dad retired as principal trumpet with the North German Radio Orchestra, Hanover. My mom is a professional pianist. My sister is a teacher in Singapore.\n\nMOST MEMORABLE MOMENTS WITH THE ORCHESTRA:Our 2008 concert in Pyong yang was very moving. By the time we played the folk song Arirang, there were tears in the audience members’ eyes. It was also special playing Magnus Lindberg’s Kraft at the Volkswagen Transparent Factory in Dresden last season. And I felt proud to be part of Ligeti’s Le Grand Macabre in 2010; it was a huge undertaking but a big success.\n\nAs of September 2013"
