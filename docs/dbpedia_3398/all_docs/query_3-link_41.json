        "text": "German TV legend Wolfgang Menge began his career at Axel Springer, reporting as a correspondent from places like Tokyo and Hong Kong. We honor him on what would have been his 100th birthday.\n\nDiplomacy is, per definition, the art of negotiation. Respect, tactfulness, and a willingness to compromise are important elements of political negotiations, for example. And diplomatic conduct is sometimes necessary when communicating with your employer, as Wolfgang Menge found out when he was a young journalist.\n\nOn May 28, 1955, the then 31-year-old began working as the Tokyo correspondent for daily newspaper the WELT and its Sunday edition WELT AM SONNTAG. A dream job for him at the time. The first few weeks didn’t exactly run smoothly. Although Menge submitted texts regularly, these didn’t always make it into print. The ambitious reporter sent a list of the stories he had submitted to the head of publishing on June 24, writing the following in his best diplomatic style: “We knew beforehand that my initial phase would be made more difficult by two factors: 1) This is the first time I have worked for you, and 2) I am brand new to Asia.” These two obstacles, Menge continued, “could be overcome with some gentle support from the editorial office and a little faith in my work.”\n\n© Photo: Unternehmensarchiv der Axel Springer SE\n\nPeople today are not always aware that Wolfgang Menge worked for the Axel Springer publishing house at the outset of his journalistic career, and that he knew the publisher well. Before joining WELT, Menge had been head of the “reporting series” section of the B.Z. in West Berlin. And prior to that he had been a local reporter for the evening newspaper “Hamburger Abendblatt”, which also belonged to Axel Springer at the time. He is still well-known, even famous, to the present day as a TV celebrity, with his unmistakable bald head, sonorous voice and the pipe he was never without. He was also known, of course, for the many cult television series he wrote. “Ein Herz und eine Seele”, for example, Germany’s answer to Archie Bunker, with its German counterpart “Ekel Alfred”, the small but tyrannical head of the Tetzlaff family and an embittered member of the lower middle class. Wolfgang Menge would have turned 100 years of age on April 10, 2024, and people have been remembering his time at Springer over the past few days.\n\nLearning journalism from the British\n\nAxel Springer’s company archives contain a slim personnel file from his time as a correspondent. It contains his fixed-rate contract, correspondence with the WELT management and with the editor-in-chief Hans Zehrer. And his articles are still stored in our company’s text archives.\n\nWolfgang Menge was born in Berlin in 1924, the son of a salesman and a Romanian mother of Jewish origin. Shortly afterwards, the family moved to Hamburg. Under the Nazis’ racial doctrine, Menge was categorized as a “half-caste of the first degree”, and yet despite that he was conscripted into the army and spent the last months of the Second World War on the Eastern Front. While German troops were withdrawing, Menge — 21 at the time—deserted in the vicinity of Vienna, returning secretly to Hamburg, where he waited in hiding for the situation to calm down. However, restarting his life in peacetime turned out to be anything but easy. As his father was unable to get back on his feet jobwise after the war, Wolfgang traded on the black market, but he was caught and sent to prison. While he was in jail, it became apparent that he had read an unusually large number of books, and so he was allowed to run the prison library.\n\n© Photo: Privat\n\n© Photo: Unternehmensarchiv der Axel Springer SE\n\nAfter being released on parole, Wolfgang Menge decided to become a journalist. He was given a trainee position at the German News Service, a news agency set up by the British which later became the dpa. Shortly after that, he received a grant that allowed him to travel to Britain for further training. At the end of almost two years, he returned to Hamburg in the fall of 1948 as a British-trained journalist, we learn from a new biography of his life to be released in the coming weeks.\n\n“Tokio-Schulze” became his mentor\n\nIn the Hanseatic city, Axel Springer had just established the evening newspaper, “Hamburger Abendblatt”. Menge applied for a vacant position as a local reporter and was taken on. The fact that the newspaper was independent and nonpartisan, came across as “British” in style, and focused on reporting was exactly to Menge’s taste. What is more, the editorial offices ware dominated by veterans of the liberal Ullstein publishing house from the pre-1933 period, among them editor-in-chief Wilhelm Schulze, a pioneer of foreign reporting who began in 1924 — the year Menge was born and with stations in New York and elsewhere.\n\nSchulze had spent the Nazi period working as a correspondent in Japan, earning him the nickname “Tokyo Schulze”. He became Menge’s mentor. When Schulze transferred to West Berlin in 1952 and became editor-in-chief of the B.Z. at Ullstein, Menge followed him. However, although he certainly enjoyed living and working in the frontline city, West Berlin soon became a little too confined for him and, as his biography explains, a little too complicated as well — due to more than one affair. He wanted to get away, a feeling that was reinforced by the fact that, even then, Menge found it difficult working as part of a team.\n\n“Emigrated to Japan”\n\nOnce again, his good contacts helped him out. Axel Springer had purchased the well-respected liberal newspaper DIE WELT from the British in 1953. The paper agreed to give Menge a fixed-rate contract as its correspondent to East Asia. As Menge later said, “May 28, 1955, became the day on which Japan had the pleasure of making my acquaintance.” He must have left in a hurry, as his personnel file contains a letter sent by the West Berlin Post Office giro service to WELT. They understood, it said in the letter, that Mr. Menge was now residing in Tokyo and working for the paper, and they wanted to know whether this was to be a temporary or long-term situation. The giros sent to Mr. Menge, they explained, were constantly being returned with “emigrated to Japan” on them.\n\nInitially, the brand-new correspondent resided in the luxurious Imperial Hotel. Menge learned two lessons very fast. The first one was that Asia was much more expensive than expected. He received a fixed fee of DM 400 from WELT, which was quickly increased to DM 500, which was twice the amount he had been paid by the B.Z., but: the rent for his apartment, which a Legation Councilor in the Foreign Office and former “Abendblatt” editor had found for him, was 1,000 DM. Luckily, his WELT contract from March 29, 1955 permitted him to work on the side for the radio, for illustrated magazines (subject to agreement) and even for German-language daily newspapers, as long as their editorial offices were located “south of the River Main”.\n\nMenge had to watch every penny. He informed the publishing management with a dose of sarcasm on January 2, 1956, that the salary of his colleague in Frankfurt had been tripled six weeks before, “which she certainly deserves more than I do”. He added that he himself did everything in his power “to make sure nobody realizes how broke I am”. Not that he wanted to complain, he assured. Nevertheless, “There are many stories I can’t chase up here in Japan or even worse, because I simply don’t have to money”. Menge spoke nostalgically about the good old times at Ullstein older colleagues had raved about, apparently referring to “Tokyo Schulze”. “Back then journalists are supposed to have travel around the world with a checkbook in their hand issued from a bank account with no limit. They obviously trusted the journalists not to waste money.”\n\nhttps://www.welt.de/geschichte/article250947098/100-Geburtstag-von-Wolfgang-Menge-Es-gab-ein-Leben-vor-Ekel-Alfred.html\n\nThe second lesson was: “Japan is stranger and more hostile than anything my colleagues described after their short trips there”, Menge wrote to the head of publishing at WELT. His idea of Asia had been damaged somewhat. He was shocked at the everyday discrimination against foreigners, which was also encouraged by the Japanese government. A German exchange student had been beaten by his fellow Japanese students for supposedly not working hard enough. “Whites” were barred from restaurants and bars. Menge noticed to his great surprise that both German and international journalists kept silent on this issue. His article about this in WELT drew a great deal of attention — not only in Germany. One US news agency printed it, as did other newspapers worldwide.\n\n© Photo: Unternehmensarchiv der Axel Springer SE\n\n© Photo: Unternehmensarchiv der Axel Springer SE\n\nTo try and get a different impression of Asia, Menge traveled to South Korea, Burma and Thailand. Although his reports of these trips were published regularly.\n\nIt’s not as if you’re not giving me the money because of my blue eyes.\n\nWolfgang Menge\n\ncommunications with his editorial team remained difficult. “Maybe I’m a little impatient. On the other hand, I don’t know any more whether I should write about a shopping trip to a department store or a commentary on Japan exporting uranium,” he wrote to his bosses in Hamburg. He said he couldn’t get a feeling for what stories to write, “when I haven’t got a clue how the editorial office is going to react.” Menge referred to what they were paying him, saying, “It’s not as if you’re not giving me the money because of my blue eyes.”\n\nThe newcomer simply wasn’t yet experienced enough to know that the different views held by people at home was part of the correspondent-editorial relationship, and had nothing to do with what things were like for the colleagues working on the ground. Menge accused his editors of not accepting his decisions about what stories to report on. For example, when he didn’t write about an uprising in China, “that doesn’t automatically mean I don’t think the uprising is important.” Revealing how thin-skinned he was, he added that he could of course be mistaken.\n\nMenge unable to cope with certain customs\n\nMenge reacted badly when reports about Japan appeared in WELT that were not written by him. On August 30, 1955, he complained to editor-in-chief Zehrer about one text, written by someone with the initials “C.H.”, which he said read as if had been compiled in Hamburg using misunderstood agency reports.\n\nMenge sensed that he might be over-reacting when Axel Springer had a package sent to him at Christmas, “with a note stating that any customs charges incurred would be reimbursed by the expenses department of WELT.” Menge confessed to one female friend that, if anyone doubted his success, then it was he and he alone. In the meantime, he also told her, he had made a name for himself and was inundated with job offers.\n\n© Photo: Privat\n\nAt the beginning of 1956, Wolfgang Menge moved from Tokyo, which he was still not on very friendly terms with, to the British Crown Colony of Hong Kong. Menge’s son Jakob, who himself worked for WELT for several years, described the way his father felt about Hong Kong a few days ago in the B.Z. podcast “Blick zurück” (Look back). He said his father’s reaction upon arrival was: “First impression: Paradise!” Hong Kong gave Menge the urbanity he had missed in Tokyo, his biographer Gundolf S. Freyermuth explains, and the journalist found it so exciting, he was unable to sleep the first night he got there.\n\nhttps://blick-zurueck.podigee.io/29-new-episode\n\nThis ultimately allowed him to approach his work with new elan. During a visit to Germany, he negotiated two additional fixed-rate contracts with the Axel Springer publishing house—one for the Hamburger Abendblatt, and one for BILD newspaper. Nevertheless, his differences with WELT editor-in-chief Hans Zehrer continued unabated at his new location. Menge was in full agreement with Zehrer and the publisher Axel Springer in his opposition to communist dictatorships, whether in China, the Soviet Union, or the GDR. And all three men considered German reunification to be a top political goal. Zehrer, however, rejected Federal Chancellor Adenauer’s strict orientation towards the West. He did not want to communications with the East to be cut off—in the interest of East Germans, who he believed the West should continue to exert its influence on.\n\nI hope you are not angry with me.\n\nWolfgang Menge to Axel Springer\n\nMenge, on the other hand, thought Zehrer was far too soft on Moscow and Beijing. And some of the articles that appeared in WELT reminded Menge in tone and content of Chinese propaganda, his biographer Freyermuth writes. Menge cabled the following to Germany, “there are not many nice things to be said about China. And that’s not my fault, but a reflection of reality”.\n\nThe unavoidable break from Springer\n\nIn the end, Wolfgang Menge practically provoked his own dismissal. It was not his intention to prompt the publisher to intervene, he said in a letter written directly to Axel Springer on December 3, 1956. All he wanted was to inform the publisher about the disagreements between himself and the editorial office. Which Menge did—in great detail, and in a very undiplomatic way. He accused the “Abendblatt” of rejecting his texts without reason, and of not keeping to agreements. Not only that, he added, but the WELT’s line on East Asia policy had changed completely and abruptly.\n\nMenge was fully aware of the consequences such a letter would bring him, as his contract obliged him to follow the newspaper’s line. “Mr. Zehrer does not seem to be the type of man who tolerates such insolence,” Menge believed, continuing with, “but neither am I, unfortunately. Otherwise, life would be simpler.” Menge ultimately regretted having “practically inviting WELT to fire me.” He also wrote that he hoped Axel Springer was not angry with him because of it. And yet, there was no dismissal.\n\nIn the course of 1957, Menge returned to Hamburg as the first Western journalist to travel with the Trans-Siberian Railway from Beijing to Moscow. And then he threw in the towel himself. His career that followed is the stuff of legend, and his screenplays for television and his role as one of Germany’s very first talk-show presenters making TV history. He stayed in contact with people at Axel Springer, and Friede Springer appreciated his humor. The former correspondent for East Asia passed away on October 17, 2012, at 88 years of age."
