        "text": "Introduction\n\n(1806–61). English poet Elizabeth Barrett Browning was prominent during the Victorian Age. In many of her poems, she brought attention to social injustices, such as slavery in the United States and child labor in England. However, Barrett Browning is best remembered for Sonnets from the Portuguese (1850), which is a collection of love poems for her husband, poet Robert Browning.\n\nEarly Life\n\nElizabeth Barrett Moulton Barrett was born on March 6, 1806, near Durham, Durham county, England. She was the eldest of 12 children of Edward Barrett Moulton Barrett, a wealthy landowner with sugar plantations in Jamaica. (The last name Barrett was legally added to Edward Barrett Moulton’s name when he inherited the family estates in Jamaica. Elizabeth used Elizabeth Barrett Moulton Barrett in legal situations but often shortened her name to Elizabeth Barrett Barrett, Elizabeth B. Barrett, or EBB.) Although her father loved his children, he was very controlling.\n\nEncouraged by her family, Barrett began writing poetry at a young age. By the time she was 10 years old, she had read plays by William Shakespeare and parts of John Milton’s epic poem Paradise Lost. At age 12 she wrote an epic poem of rhyming couplets—titled The Battle of Marathon—that her father had printed. As was typical of daughters during the 1800s, Barrett had little formal education. However, when she was a teenager she taught herself Greek, Latin, and other languages so that she could read the original works of major authors. During that time Barrett’s Christian faith deepened, as did her passion for human rights.\n\nBarrett was a lively child until she was 15, when she suddenly fell seriously ill, probably as the result of a spinal injury. Her health was permanently affected. In 1826 Barrett anonymously published An Essay on Mind, with Other Poems. The volume contained some 15 poems, the main one of which was an overview of the history of science and poetry from classical Greece to the Victorian era.\n\nIn 1828 Barrett’s mother died. Four years later her father suffered financial losses after the mismanagement of the Jamaica estates. He therefore sold their country home and moved the family to the coastal town of Sidmouth in Devon, England. In 1833 Barrett anonymously published a translation of Prometheus Bound by Greek dramatist Aeschylus. She also included some of her own poems in the edition. By the mid-1830s she was submitting ballads to English journals. Other female writers, including Mary Russell Mitford, encouraged her literary efforts. Barrett’s family soon moved to London, England, which opened up new opportunities for her. There Barrett met some of the leading literary figures of the day, including William Wordsworth and Alfred, Lord Tennyson.\n\nRecognition as a Poet\n\nIn London Barrett contributed poems to several periodicals. Her first collection, The Seraphim and Other Poems, appeared in 1838. It was the first book that was presented to the public under her own name. The entire volume expresses Barrett’s Christian faith. For example, the title poem, The Seraphim, tells of two angels viewing and talking about the Crucifixion of Jesus. As the book began to earn Barrett literary attention, she suffered a setback in her health. She spent the next three years in Torquay, Devon, in the hope that the warmer weather would be beneficial. While there her brother Edward, with whom she was extremely close, drowned, leaving Barrett distraught. Upon her return to London she became an invalid and a recluse, rarely seeing anyone outside her family.\n\nAlthough Barrett hardly left her room, she continued to write. She contributed poems and articles on various poets to both English and American journals. In 1844 she published her second book of poetry, Poems, by Elizabeth Barrett Barrett. Both the public and literary reviewers enthusiastically received the two-volume collection. Some of the poems, such as “The Cry of the Children,” point out social injustice. The ballad “Lady Geraldine’s Courtship: A Romance of the Age” explores love between a noblewoman and a poet. The sonnets “To George Sand: A Desire” and “To George Sand: A Recognition” celebrate the contemporary female French novelist George Sand, who protested social conventions.\n\nMarriage and Sonnets\n\nFor several years Barrett and poet Robert Browning had admired each other’s work but had never contacted each other. In January 1845 he sent her a letter proclaiming, “I love your verses with all my heart. . . . and I love you too.” The two corresponded extensively through letters and then met in early summer. Their courtship was kept a close secret from Barrett’s despotic father, who had forbidden all his children from marrying. The couple’s wedding took place on September 12, 1846. Her father knew nothing of it.\n\nBarrett Browning and Browning left for Italy after their marriage and eventually settled in Florence. Their only child, Robert Wiedemann Barrett Browning, was born there in 1849. Barrett Browning remained estranged from her father, and he had not forgiven her before his death in 1857. However, she had previously inherited money from another relative, and the couple was able to live comfortably while pursuing their literary careers.\n\nIn 1849 Barrett Browning showed Browning a copy of Sonnets from the Portuguese. The 44 sonnets record the early days of the couple’s courtship. In them Barrett expresses her reluctance to marry since she is older than Browning and an invalid. Eventually, however, she yields to his love despite her father’s objections, and the two find happiness together. The 43rd sonnet contains the famous line “How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.” Browning convinced her to include Sonnets from the Portuguese in a revised edition of Poems, published in two volumes in 1850. People were immediately drawn to the romantic sonnets, which gained popularity quickly. Barrett Browning also included a new translation of Prometheus Bound in the collection.\n\nLater Works\n\nMany of Barrett Browning’s later works deal with politics, a subject that Victorian audiences thought unsuitable for women. “The Runaway Slave at Pilgrim’s Point” (published in Boston, Massachusetts, in 1848 and in London in 1849) is a protest against slavery in the United States. Barrett Browning turned to politics in Italy for the long poem Casa Guidi Windows (1851). In the first part she explores the hopefulness that the inhabitants of Florence feel at the prospect of the unification of Italy’s states and independence from Austria. In the second part, written a few years later, she reflects on the people’s disillusionment following setbacks in Italy’s fight for freedom.\n\nBarrett Browning also discussed Italian independence and England’s failure to intervene in the situation in the book Poems Before Congress (1860). The collection included the poem “A Curse for a Nation,” which many people at the time thought was a denunciation of England. However, the poem was actually aimed at U.S. slavery and had been published previously in an abolitionist paper in the United States. English audiences and critics disliked the political tone of these later works and largely ignored them.\n\nBarrett Browning’s other major work from this period was the blank-verse poem Aurora Leigh (1857), which addresses social injustice. Comprising some 11,000 lines, the story explores the heroine’s childhood in Italy and England, her self-education in her father’s hidden library, and her successful pursuit of a literary career. At first Aurora refuses a marriage proposal, but she later surrenders her independence and weds. The poem has several themes, including the importance of poetry, the individual’s responsibility to society, and the victimization of women. This work did not impress most critics at the time, though it was a huge popular success. Barrett Browning died in Florence on June 29, 1861."
