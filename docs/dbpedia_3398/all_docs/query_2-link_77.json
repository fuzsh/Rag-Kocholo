        "text": "Three decades since the Berlin Wall fell, Germans remain deeply divided over the question of what it means to be German.\n\nIn an article marking the 30th anniversary of Germany’s unification, Katrin Bennhold, The Times’s Berlin bureau chief, examines the renewed debate over German identity. The most vocal participants have been members of Germany’s far-right, anti-immigrant party, who draw a sharp line between “bio-Germans,” with German blood, and “passport Germans.”\n\nW e asked Germans and immigrants to Germany how they think about their identity — and how they navigate the simmering tensions in their country.\n\nNearly 500 people responded, including many whose lives straddle two national identities: Germans married to immigrants, and vice versa, and the children of intermarried couples.\n\nThey told us about the subtle and overt racism that they or their family members have experienced, their struggles to integrate fully and their fears for the future.\n\nHere is a selection of their responses, which have been condensed and edited.\n\n‘There’s the constant assumption that you do not belong’"
