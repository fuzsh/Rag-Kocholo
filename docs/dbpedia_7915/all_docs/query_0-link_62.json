        "text": "Aelita: Queen of Mars\n\nJoin us for the legendary science-fiction film Aelita: Queen of Mars with a live score from The Flushing Remonstrance.\n\nSaid to be the first full-length science fiction movie ever made, Aelita is a fantastic adventure about Los, an engineer living in Moscow, who dreams of Aelita, the Queen of Mars, and builds a spaceship to take him to her. They fall in love, but Los soon finds himself embroiled in a proletarian uprising to establish socialism on the red planet.\n\nInfluenced by the Russian avant-garde constructivist movement, the bold artistry of Aelita’s Martian costumes and sets contributed enormously to the science fiction look as we know it. The Flushing Remonstrance celebrate the centennial of this major work of early futuristic cinema by bringing it to life with their all-new live score.\n\nONE NIGHT ONLY!
