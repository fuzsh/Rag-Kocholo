        "text": "Looking for Wilde Salome\n\n1After Looking for Richard (USA, 1996) and Chinese Coffee (USA, 2000), Wilde Salome (2006-11) was the third film directed by Al Pacino, the star famous for his roles as Michael Corleone in Coppola’s Godfather trilogy (USA, 1972,1974, 1990) and Tony Montana in De Palma’s Scarface (USA, 1983). At around the time Pacino was embarking on this lengthy project, other stars were also becoming directors, like Emilio Estevez with Bobby (USA, 2006) and Anthony Hopkins with Slipstream (USA, 2007). But unlike his peers, Pacino has never directed mainstream feature films. Instead, he has involved himself in low-budget experimental projects – often partly self-funded – and always related to the theatre work which has accompanied his career in film. Where acting is concerned, at this point Pacino had just finished working on Avnet’s 88 Minutes (USA/Germ/Can, 2007), his previous film being Caruso’s Two for the Money (USA, 2005). During the shooting of Wilde Salome, Pacino flew to Las Vegas for a few days to play in Soderbergh’s Ocean’s Thirteen (USA, 2007).\n\n2While Chinese Coffee was adapted from a play by Ira Lewis, Looking for Richard, adapted from Shakespeare’s Richard III, combines fiction and documentary in a more original way. This blending of genres is what Pacino chose once more for Wilde Salome. Although centuries apart in time, in the imagination of Pacino the worlds of Shakespeare and of Wilde share certain similarities. Herod, interpreted by Pacino, somehow resembles Shylock, at the same time a seducer and a buffoon, brow-beating and pathetic. And Wilde’s story can also be read through the fate of Shylock – whom Pacino had played in Michael Radford’s 2004 film version – with the dramatic legal turnaround he experienced: after suing his lover’s father for libel, he loses the case on appeal and is condemned. In addition to the oaths and contracts that bind an individual to his doom, Richard III and Salome have many motifs in common, such as a king coveting and then marrying his brother’s wife, and the promise to forsake one’s kingdom for a horse or for a dance. It is also the case that King Lear was mentioned several times as Pacino’s next possible project during the preparatory work for Salome.\n\n3The basis for the story is to be found in the New Testament (Mark 6:17–29 and Matthew 14:3–11). Salome (played by Jessica Chastain), the step-daughter of King Herod (Pacino), falls in love with the prophet John the Baptist (played by Kevin Anderson), whom the King has imprisoned because of his ever more critical sermons (against Herod’s Kingdom, his politics and his decadent mores), and because of his growing popular renown. Herod’s wife Herodias, Salome’s mother (played by Roxanne Hart), would like to see the preacher executed because she considers him a dangerous activist, but the superstitious Herod refuses. Salome’s beauty is extraordinary and each and every man, from the ordinary soldier to the King himself, cannot stop staring at her; the captain of the guards even commits suicide out of jealousy. After a banquet, Herod begs his stepdaughter to dance, to which she eventually agrees once the King promises to give her in return everything she may ask for. After a highly sensuous ‘dance of the seven veils’, Salome requests the head of John the Baptist in order to wreak her revenge on the prophet who, totally dedicated to his spiritual and political mission, is the only man still impervious to her charms. Dismayed, Herod keeps his promise and orders the beheading of the prophet. When the head is delivered to her, Salome goes into a delirium of passion - before Herod, horrified, demands that she too be executed.\n\n4Prior to Wilde’s play, the story of Salome had been a source of inspiration for many artists, painters (like Gustave Moreau) and writers (Gustave Flaubert with Hérodias in 1877 and Stéphane Mallarmé with Hérodiade in 1887). Wilde’s play, however, was banned when it was first published, and was presented only in private performances in the first years of the 20th Century before being performed publicly from the 1930s onwards (culminating in Steven Berkoff’s famous production in 1988, which Pacino mentions in the film). Wilde’s text also inspired Richard Strauss’s 1904 opera Salome, later performances of which range from Peter Hall’s memorable 1992 production at London’s Royal Opera House with Maria Ewing to Olivier Py’s 2017 production at Strasbourg’s Opéra National du Rhin - both of which involved full-frontal nudity.\n\n5Cinema was also quick to take up the subject and there are many more or less faithful adaptations entitled Salome, from the Hollywood versions directed by Charles Bryant, starring Alla Nazimova (1923) and by William Dieterle, with Rita Hayworth (1953), to Carmelo Bene’s baroque interpretation starring Donyale Luna (Italy, 1972); in Spain in 2002, Carlos Saura even offered a flamenco version starring Aida Gómez. Other films quote in passing the famous scene of Salome’s dance, as when it constitutes a spectacle within the film that is watched by the characters at the beginning of Tod Browning’s The Show (USA, 1927). Salome even pervades a recent film like Stéphanie Di Giusto’s La Danseuse (Fr/Belg/Czech, 2016), in which Loïe Fuller (played by Soko) – a pioneer of modern dance (and also theatrical lighting) – appears as an admirer of Wilde’s Salome, a text that she has been repeatedly reading and enacting since her childhood; at one point in the film, the character is even framed in front of a painting of Salome holding the Baptist’s head.\n\n9Chastain conveys the insanity of her character with an intensity that recalls Stanislavsky’s method acting and led Pacino to believe that she would be nominated for an Academy Award. In particular she supported the idea that her dance should end up in total nudity so as to both shock and arouse the viewer. Whereas the vapid Anderson may appear the weak point of the casting, lacking the necessary charisma to embody the man who leads Salome to damn herself, Chastain shines on screen. Through her inspired acting and her nude dancing, she brings an undeniable psychological and erotic intensity to the film; she endows her character with sensuality and animality, showing the young virgin as physically attracted to the Baptist, his voice, his body, the whiteness of his skin, the blackness of his hair, the redness of his mouth (which she will finally be able to kiss only after his beheading), and eventually losing her mind because of his disdain for her, as he rebuffs this “daughter of Babylon, daughter of Sodom”.\n\nThe Actor as Auteur\n\n12During the rehearsals for the stage reading of Salome, Pacino can even be seen contradicting the instructions of the stage director Estelle Parsons, although he is supposed to intervene only as an actor. As a compulsive creator (he shot dozens of hours of rushes over several years, only to keep a few minutes of them), he jealously maintains control of the entire artistic process. This even extended to financial matters insofar as he blocked the distribution of the film for nearly five years – even longer than for Looking for Richard, started in 1993 and released in 1996 – before finalising a commercial version of 90 minutes’ duration. He did this because he did not feel ready, and then thought it was not a good time (Pacino playing in one third-rate movie after the other and collecting bad reviews which could be detrimental to the film) until financial pressures finally forced him to release a version that, for him, still remains incomplete. All in all, the film went through dozens of provisional versions, some of which ran longer than three hours. From 2006 to 2011, Pacino continuously modified the edit to find the right balance between the extracts from the filmed play and the documentary sequences.\n\n7 Pacino in Grobel, I Want you in My Movie!, pp. 253, 76.\n\n“We are just going to keep making this movie, expanding it. And that’s what it’s about. It’s about an obsession; it’s about striving to get somewhere. It’s never about the final product. It’s about the search. You can never quit.” As he also explains: “I made a mistake showing it to you. Someone said to me that I should never show a work in this state to anyone. And he’s right. I showed you something half complete. […] It’s very delicate stuff. Artists are very frightened people. They’re not robust. As an actor, I am, but not as an artist. It was too soon to show it. It’s not ready to be seen, not even by me. It’s like reading marginal notes to a poem.”\n\n14If Pacino equates the film-maker with the poet or the painter, it should come as no surprise that painting is given prominence in Wilde Salome. Pacino visits art galleries (for instance the National Gallery of Ireland, since Pacino believes that Wilde drew inspiration from paintings such as Guercino’s Saint John the Baptist Visited in Prison by Salome (1625), in front of which Pacino poses), and his cinematographer, Benoît Delhomme, shows him pictures to help define the visual world and art direction of the film (in particular Gustave Moreau’s The Apparition/L’Apparition, that appears in the film and was painted in 1876, the same year as his Salome /Salome dansant devant Hérode). Pacino does not hesitate to compare himself to Picasso, to Dali (whom he was to embody in an Andrew Niccol film that he finally gave up since, in his opinion, his character in Wilde Salome was “already Dali”), and to Pollock:\n\n8 Pacino in Grobel, I Want you in My Movie!, pp. 121 and 111.\n\n“I don’t know what my vision is yet. It reminds me of the way Jackson Pollock painted – trying to put different images together hoping that they connect in some way and give off a feeling. Film is the paint on my canvas.”\n\nSelf-Portrait: The Story of an Obsession\n\n16“This is the story of an obsession”, reads the epigraph that opens Wilde Salome (with the word “obsession” highlighted in red lettering). Obsession is indeed the central subject of the film: the obsession of the male characters with Salome’s body, of Salome with John the Baptist, of John the Baptist with his divine calling. But also the obsession of Pacino with Oscar Wilde, the true prime mover of the project as Pacino seeks to understand through this film why he feels so close to the Irish writer, as if in a fused relationship, “like half of each other”. Pacino expresses great admiration for the author and his words. He also discovers and is fascinated by some of Wilde’s other works, like The Ballad of Reading Gaol, the long poem about a convict sentenced to death that Wilde composed following his own release from jail – after his homosexuality saw him sentenced to a term of two years’ hard labour (1895-7) during which he wrote De profundis, excerpts from which are read by Pacino in the film. His preoccupation with Wilde also involves visits to the places associated with the writer (Dublin, where he was born; New York and London, where he resided; Paris where he died).\n\n17Pacino interviews various Wilde experts and people who have been significantly influenced by the author – such as his descendants, gallery directors, scholars, and celebrities as disparate as Gore Vidal and Bono. For the film is also about the throes of creation: “It’s a movie about inspiration”, Pacino declares to his producer. Pacino seems to be possessed when he directs the actors (whispering the lines along with them whilst behind the monitor), when he places his camera, gives directions and sometimes orders to his crew - in turn elated, annoyed and dispirited. As an actors’ director, he is seen to direct with passion (notably for the scene of the young captain of the guard’s suicide). At once a documentary about Wilde, about the staging of a play and the shooting of a film, Wilde Salome is also a documentary about the actor and film-maker Pacino himself. Being in complete control of his project, Pacino is fully aware of this dimension, as when he films himself looking at rushes on a monitor; these shots foreground Pacino the film-maker observing the work of Pacino the actor, in a compelling narcissistic mise-en-abîme of his dual star persona.\n\n18Wilde Salome proves even more radical than Looking for Richard, which had already elaborated on Pacino’s status as a tragedian (and was also a reminder of how much Scarface owes to Shakespeare’s Richard III). With Wilde Salome, Pacino proposes a self-reflexive examination of his acting career, a critical assessment of his star persona, and a reflection on fame. If Wilde Salome pays tribute to Wilde’s genius, it also shows that, even in Britain, the Hollywood star is much more famous than the author of The Importance of Being Earnest: in front of Wilde’s house in London Pacino signs an autograph, the former inhabitant of the building remaining clearly unknown to the fan, whilst in Ireland a student mimics shooting a machine gun in clear reference to the final scene in Scarface. His aim is also to acknowledge economic considerations that were missing from Looking for Richard.\n\n19Filming behind the scenes of the singular creation such as a film – all the more so in that in this case it blends cinema and theatre – Wilde Salome also raises fundamental ontological questions to do with the similarities and differences between directing for the stage and for the screen, and concerning the broader relationships between art and industry. “Everything is money!” complains Pacino in one of his Brechtian asides – which are sometimes spiteful, sometimes mischievous. The actor exposes the conflictual relationships he has with his two producers – Robert Fox, the producer of the play, and Barry Navidi, the producer of the film – who oblige him to reduce the shooting schedule from five days to four: “The producers, fuck’em! How can they be so filmically ignorant?,” rants the star, who seems to liken the role of actors to that of prostitutes when he warns “You got me, my face, you didn’t get my soul”. He also believes that the ticket prices for the stage reading are too high and that the show’s promotion has cashed in on his name, trading on a claimed comeback by the star (“Pacino is back”), even though the actor has never stopped working either in cinema or on the stage.\n\n20The film also offers an intimate portrait of the actor: he is filmed in Los Angeles with his children (the twins Anton and Olivia, who arrive with their father at the theatre for the rehearsals) and during an awards reception at Trinity College Dublin. As with Truffaut in La Chambre verte (Fr, 1978), in which the director, playing the lead character, pays tribute to his late friends and mentors by setting up a shrine, Wilde Salome gives Pacino the opportunity to gather together personalities (in this case all alive and kicking) who have played a significant part in his personal and professional world: his friend and biographer Larry Grobel, who was to play a leading role in the documentary part of the film but footage of whom was largely cut; Estelle Parsons, a distinguished member of the Actors Studio, who directed the stage reading and had already appeared in Looking for Richard; Barry Navidi, the producer of the film, who had already produced The Merchant of Venice (USA/It/Lux/UK, 2004), in which Pacino had been directed by Michael Radford; the French cinematographer Benoît Delhomme, who had also worked on The Merchant of Venice (and with whom Pacino was to work again on Dito Montiel’s The Son of No One (USA, 2011)). There is also a brief interview with the playwright Tony Kushner, whose play Angels in America was adapted into a TV mini-series by Mike Nichols in 2003, with Pacino in a leading role.\n\n21As for the links that he establishes between Wilde and the play, Pacino blurs the frontiers between what happens on the set and behind the scenes. His character’s (Herod’s) rage when he hears Salome’s outrageous request is cross-edited with the fury of his other ‘character’ (Pacino the film- maker) while ranting at the producers. More generally, Pacino imposes his stamp through the idiosyncratic play-acting that can be seen in all his films, both major (Serpico) and minor (88 Minutes). The film thus displays a body language that is the actor’s hallmark: a propensity to ham it up, with his arms spread out; a tendency to hide his eyes with his right hand to punctuate the dramatic climaxes; to press his index on his brow and then on his lips to convey some intense reflection; and to raise his hands to his temples in moments of rage, with only half of his face lit so as to convey the dramatic quality of the sequence (or with his eyes shut, to signify introspection).\n\n22Once again Pacino personifies a demiurge when he is filmed checking the image on the monitor, just like the other characters he played in front of such devices: from the undercover cop in Michael Mann’s Heat (USA, 1995), to the TV producer in Mann’s The Insider (USA, 1999), the producer-creator in Andrew Niccol’s S1mOne (USA, 2002), and the spy in Roger Donaldson’s The Recruit (USA, 2003). Salome furnishes Pacino with another regal role, with the actor adopting a majestic pose sitting on a throne, as in Scarface or the Godfather saga. He is also shown slumped in an armchair when he embodies Wilde after he has just learned that he will be sentenced to jail (which in turn recalls the fallen and slouching Pacino in Scarface and Mike Newell’s Donnie Brasco (USA, 1997)). Just before feeling faint, Herod even teeters like Michael Corleone in The Godfather, Part III. Other characteristic motifs recur throughout the film, like the mobile phone to which Pacino is hooked up (as in 88 Minutes), or the dialogues he has with his producer, filmed in over-the-shoulder shots while they are in the front seats of a parked car, which recalls the type of framing and editing of which the actor seems to be particularly fond (for example, the conversations with Russell Crowe in The Insider, and with Ryan O’Neal in Daniel Algrant’s People I Know (USA/Germ, 2003), systematically adopt this type of mise-en-scène).\n\n23The film also tackles somewhat transgressive themes, like the bold sexuality of Salome (conveyed through the metaphor of the moon, whose paleness and fickleness characterise Salome, and which, to Herod, appears nude and sensual), or homosexuality, illegal in Wilde’s day. For Pacino, Wilde put a part of himself into every character in Salome: either through the transformation of an individual, with Salome discovering her sexuality just as Wilde asserted a lifestyle (homosexuality, progressive political ideas) deemed too scandalous for the polite society of the day or, in the case of John the Baptist, through the grim anticipation of the experience of imprisonment. Likewise, Herod’s bisexuality evokes Wilde’s own sexual ambivalence - Wilde was married but had several male lovers - and so do some of the characters interpreted by Pacino, including Sonny in Dog Day Afternoon to the cop in Friedkin’s Cruising (USA, 1980) and Roy Cohn in Angels in America who falls in love with a younger man (like Wilde with Bosie); not to mention the perhaps queer dimension of Scarface, namely the ambiguous emotional bond between Tony and Manny.\n\n24In this respect, Pacino’s eccentric interpretation of Herod did not go unnoticed by critics:\n\n10 Glenn Kenny, ‘Review: Al Pacino’s Journey With Wilde’s ‘Salome’, New York Times, 29 March 2018, htt (...)\n\n“Herod as a character is a figure balanced on the knife edge of Camp. […] Mr. Pacino interprets the character in an entirely uncharacteristic fashion. […] he does give Herod a fey, pansexually flirtatious side that one doesn’t normally associate with Mr. Pacino, who, in most performances, whether quiet or manic, is almost always masculine in a conventionally unambiguous way.”\n\n25As in Looking for Richard, in Wilde Salome Pacino draws a self-portrait as much as depicting the great Oscar Wilde; the amalgamation of the two culminates with Pacino playing the part of Wilde in a short scene in which the playwright learns about his indictment for sodomy and gross indecency and decides to confront a bigoted society rather than to live a life on the run.\n\nPacino’s Look\n\n27Salome’s final speech of deranged passion, addressed to the severed head of John the Baptist, is itself preoccupied with the business of looking:\n\n14 Wilde, Salomé, pp. 160-2.\n\n“But wherefore dost thou not look at me, Iokanaan? Thine eyes that were so terrible, so full of rage and scorn, are shut now. Wherefore are they shut? Open tine eyes! Lift up thine eyelids, Iokanaan! Wherefore dost thou not look at me? Art thou afraid of me, Iokanaan, that thou wilt not look at me? […] Thou didst put upon thine eyes the covering of him who would see his God. Well, thou hast seen thy God, Iokanaan, but me, me, thou didst never see. If thou hadst seen me thou hadst loved me. I saw thee, and I loved thee.”\n\n28Salome thus contains all aspects of the desirous gaze, from the injunction to look to its interdiction. This motif was already part of the history of the play’s adaptation into cinema with the close-up vignette of Alla Nazimova’s enthralling gaze in Bryant’s Salome. It thus seems only appropriate that Pacino’s eyes should be the focus of the poster outside the Wadsworth Theatre in Los Angeles, in turn recalling the famous hand-drawn poster of Dog Day Afternoon, which shows only the upper part of the actor’s face.\n\n29Wilde Salome is then a film about the scopic drive, about the obsession of looking and the desire it provokes. This theme relates not only to the actor’s career in cinema but also, and more broadly, to the history of the cinema itself, since the new medium built on the fascination with bodies in motion - and most specifically on dancing bodies (for example, the enthralling serpentine dances of Loïe Fuller, whom Edison filmed as early as 1894). Pacino stages a remarkable mirror effect when he films himself looking at Chastain through the monitor: the film-maker’s gaze, captivated by the actress’s performance, mirrors Herod’s fascination with Salome’s body. As Parsons recalls in voice- over early on, one must not forget that Pacino is quite familiar with the part of Herod. He had already played Salome twice on Broadway under the direction of Estelle Parsons (1992 and 2003). And it is no accident that the two Salome-like stories in Pacino’s film career (Pacino’s characters playing spectators who desire a woman’s nude body) are told just before (Garry Marshall’s Frankie and Johnny, USA, 1991) and just after (De Palma’s Carlito’s Way, USA, 1993) he played Herod at the Circle in the Square Theatre in New York (March to July 1992). In Frankie and Johnny, Johnny (Pacino), like Herod, begs Frankie (Michelle Pfeiffer) to allow him to look at her naked body, which he describes with analytical, quasi-naturalistic, precision: “Her eyes, her breast, her stomach …”, and which is hardly concealed by a diaphanous, veil-like dressing gown.\n\n30In Carlito’s Way, Penelope Ann Miller plays a dancer falling prey to men’s lustful gazes, and recreates Salome’s famous scene when practising on the barre, wiggling on the dance floor of a nightclub, or in a strip club. When Carlito (Pacino) looks at the dancer he is thus reminiscent of the young Captain whose suicide Herod regrets thus:\n\n15 Wilde, Salomé, p. 98.\n\n“I am sorry he has slain himself. I am very sorry. For he was fair to look upon. He was even very fair. He had very languorous eyes. I remember that I saw that he looked languorously at Salome. Truly, I thought he looked too much at her.”\n\n31The page of Herodias had indeed repeatedly warned the young Syrian against the dangers of the look:\n\n16 Wilde, Salomé, pp. 46, 50, 60.\n\n“You are always looking at her. You look at her too much. It is dangerous to look at people in such fashion. Something terrible may happen.”; “You must not look at her. You look too much at her.”; “Do not look at her. I pray you not to look at her.”\n\n33The metaphor of the mirror, and the tragic fate awaiting those who have looked too much, are themes expounded upon by Herod at the end of the play:\n\n18 Wilde, Salomé, pp. 48-150.\n\n“It’s true, I have looked at thee and ceased not this night. Thy beauty has troubled me. Thy beauty has grievously troubled me, and I have looked at thee overmuch. Nay, but I will look at thee no more. One should not look at anything. Neither at things, nor at people should one look. Only in mirrors is it well to look, for mirrors do but show us masks.”\n\n34It seems that Pacino remained in a creative frenzy whatever his activity, and that the character of Herod was a persistent influence on his other roles in theatre and film. It is no accident either that the film for which the actor received an Academy Award (Martin Brest’s Scent of a Woman, USA, 1992) is a film almost entirely about the gaze. It may deal with the look of a blind man, but Pacino plays him with his eyes wide open. It is not only in Wilde Salome that Pacino will use the motif of a character staring from a distance at the object of his desire to epitomise that which remains inaccessible: in Chinese Coffee, for example, Pacino’s character, standing in the street, looks up dolefully at the window of the apartment of the woman who has left him.\n\nMethod or Madness?\n\n37In fact the star carried out this “insane” project on the basis of performance techniques inspired by the Method school of acting, based on improvisation and introspection. The film makes profuse reference to the famous studio in which Pacino was trained by Lee Strasberg at the end of the 1960s and to which he has remained faithful (he is one of the studio’s co-presidents). As though to remind us of the importance of this institution, Wilde Salome opened on the premises of the Actors Studio, in Manhattan, with a conversation between Pacino and Estelle Parsons, the director of the stage play; a former Artistic Director of the Studio, as well as a director and actress, she received an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her role in Penn’s Bonnie and Clyde (USA, 1967)."
