        "text": "Salomé is a 1923 silent film directed by Charles Bryant and starring Alfa Nazimova. It is an adaptation of the 1891 Oscar Wilde play of the same name. The play itself is a loose retelling of the biblical story of King Herod and his execution of John the Baptist (here, as in Wilde's play, called Jokanaan) at the request of Herod's stepdaughter, Salome whom he lusts after.\n\nSalomé is often called one of the first art films to be made in the United States. The highly stylized costumes, exaggerated acting, minimal sets, and absence of all but the most necessary props make for a screen image much more focused on atmosphere and on conveying a sense of the characters' individual heightened desires than on conventional plot development.\n\nDoors & Bar open 11am. Movie starts at 12 noon\n\n$15 and kids 16 and under free. No need to book. Get your tickets at the door."
