It was adapted from the Oscar Wilde play of the same name, which is based on the biblical story of King Herod and his execution of John the Baptist at the request of Herod's stepdaughter, Salome, whom he lusts after. This film is often referred to as one of the first art films to be made in America, owing to its minimal sets, stylised costumes and attention to creating the story's atmosphere and characters.\n\nFrom the Ira Resnick collection."
