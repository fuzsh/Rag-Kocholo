        "text": "A large number of movies, books, songs, and paintings from 1923 entered the public domain on Tuesday January 1, 2019. For more information as to why plus a list of resources listen to our recent podcast episode about the public domain, or look out for our other blog post by Copyright Law Librarian Stephen Wolfson later this month.\n\nTo celebrate, the law library has a rotating display of digital slides titled “23 from ’23” featuring lists of visual, musical and written works from 1923 that are now in the public domain. In addition the law library’s group study tables have silent films from 1923 showing throughout the month on the two screens in that area. Stop by anytime this month to watch!\n\n1923 was a rich and interesting time in both American and international culture. Overarching themes of all works released in that year are industry, technological innovation, and cross-cultural influence. American films featured international faces and plots (The Silent Command, Salomé, Frozen Hearts, A Room With A View). Written works discussed the recent world war (A Son at the Front, Thomas the Imposter, The World Crisis, Antic Hay), and films, visual works of art and written works all depict advancements in transportation and communication (The Lost Lady, The Prospects of Industrial Civilization, The Titanic, Pacific 231, The Wizardry of Wireless). In music and art compositions from this year there is a wide range of styles mixing and emerging with several works decidedly returning to classic structure and subject matter (The Art Spirit, Mansford Roof, Octet for Wind Instruments) while others intentionally look to the future for themes, inspiration and techniques, even inventing new genres (Dance Suite, I Just Want a Daddy I Can Call My Own, The Discovered Statue, Jacob’s Room, Return to Reason).\n\nWhether you are a creator yourself looking to pull source materials from the items entering the public domain, or you simply want to read a free copy of a novel published that year, check out our following list of “23 from ’23”::"
