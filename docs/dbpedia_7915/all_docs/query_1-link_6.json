This classic film is a visual feast; furnished by lavish designs inspired by artist Aubrey Beardsley, and an unforgettable title role performance by the flamboyant Hollywood silent film star, Alla Nazimova.\n\nInspired by traditional Arabic ensembles, Charlie Barber’s new score is equally dramatic. Performed by musicians playing from two towers flanking each side of the giant silver screen, this is a riveting blend of music and spectacle unlike anything else.\n\nPresented by Turner Sims in association with Southampton Film Week\n\nis run by film charity Charity Number 1089882\n\nWe are delighted, with support of our partners, to present a number of events for free but if you are able to make a donation when purchasing your ticket or attending an event we will be incredibly grateful - and able to sustain City Eye and Southampton Film Week for years to come! Thank you."
