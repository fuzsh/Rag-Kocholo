        "text": "published on 2018-12-24T12:30:17Z\n\nDuring the last decade of April 2018, I had the honour to try out something different, which was scoring a soundtrack to a silent movie. Due to the lack of time, my preparations didn't start until the last moment and were really quick. Surprisingly the result exceeded my expectations and when the movie ended the audience rewarded me with loud applause. Somewhere during the movie, I would myself trip away to the match of music and picture and forget my role in this process. Big thank you goes to Natalia WÃ³jcik (@fremenen) and Markus Tiitus for inviting me to take part in this project! More information: https://www.facebook.com/SilenceSilentCinema/ To relive the moment, try to start move and music simultaneously. Link to the film: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYbJmDzRH68\n\nGenre\n\nSoundtrack"
