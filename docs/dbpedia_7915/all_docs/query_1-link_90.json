        "text": "The biblical account of Salome has been marked throughout history by two main themes: on the one hand, the princess’s dance in front of the main rulers of Galilee, and on the other hand, the request for the head of John the Baptist to King Herod, instigated by his mother Herodias. The reading of this passage has been strongly marked by the different patriarchal exegetical approaches, which have modulated the reception of both female characters being traceable through the visual and literary arts, to the point of taking on the concept of femme fatale. Really, in both moments Salome is the executor of the actions, not as a result of her capacity for agency, but due to her influenceable character. Through a critical–historical analysis of the biblical passage, Herodias and Salome emerge with characteristics quite different from what 19th-century Art History inherited. The methodology of feminist rhetorical criticism allows for an approach to the visual re-imaginings of this biblical passage that have shaped the iconography of these two figures. The field of visual arts, particularly the production of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, will be the great receptacle for the genesis of the fatality and assimilation of these female biblical figures.\n\nthe tale of Salome endures because it trades in timeless issues of duality and deception--some of which were foremost at the onset of modernity, but that still persist to this day: the seductress and the innocent, the high and the low, the personal and performative roles of women and race. The fact that the figure of Salome (as a tangible symbol of this issue) is still a subject in various artistic media is a testament to society’s continued need to make sense of this female archetype and to place her appropriately in ever-evolving contexts.\n\nFrom sorceresses to vampires, harpies to mermaids, the figure of the killer, predatory woman has always been a subject of fascination for the often male-dominated fields of arts and literature, and has been romanticized in the form of blood thirsty creatures that distorted the purity of women. A young lady of the high society using the power of her body to submit a King into executing a holy man, Salome could not be left out by writers and artists for too long. [...]\n\nThis thesis won the 2011 Best Thesis Award from the Bowling Green State University College of Musical Arts. Richard Strauss’s Salome constitutes an operatic adaptation of Oscar Wilde’s 1891 play. The popularity of this biblical account spans several hundred years with portrayals in mediums including folk tales, poetry and musical adaptations. The identities of the characters evolved over time, with emphasis on different personalities and relationships with each variation. Beginning with Gustave Flaubert’s short story Hérodias (1877), retellings dramatized the exoticism of the characters by virtue of their ethnicities and geographical location. By the end of the nineteenth century, Salome had developed into the Oriental femme fatale of Wilde’s and Strauss’s renderings. Early twentieth-century audiences became familiar with Salome’s story through a multitude of interpretations including Strauss’s opera. In this thesis, I examine the identities of the main characters of the tale. The characteristics of previous realizations betray the origins and meanings of these identities. Although the characters differed in each interpretation, audiences always saw them as part of a faraway time and place. The Orientalist underpinnings of early twentieth-century interpretations demanded that the characters be constructed to conform to exotic stereotypes. Chapter 1 reveals the development of the story, with an emphasis on Salome’s identity and her relationships with John the Baptist and Herod. Chapter 2 compares the Salomes of modern dancer Maud Allan and composer Richard Strauss. Chapter 3 demonstrates that the characters in Salome were understood mainly through contrasts of identity.\n\nWithout even a name in the biblical accounts, the daughter of Herodias has been described as ‘the symbolic incarnation of undying Lust, the Goddess of immortal Hysteria, the accursed Beauty exalted above all other beauties … the monstrous Beast, indifferent, irresponsible, insensible, poisoning’. As part of an analysis not of the biblical text but rather of Gustave Moreau’s first Salome painting (1876), these comments reflect a popular understanding of the biblical woman seen as responsible for the death of John the Baptist. Salome has become for many the quintessential femme fatale, whose ‘dance of many veils’ leads to one man’s infatuation and another man’s decapitation. This reading of Salome, however, has less to do with the brief note on the dance that one finds in the Bible and more to do with the Salome’s artistic afterlives. By looking afresh at depictions of Salome that do not represent her within an erotic context, readers of the Bible can be challenged into re-assessing their own understanding of the story of the Baptist’s death and the role that the girl plays in it."
