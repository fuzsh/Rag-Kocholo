        "text": "Narratively, Salomé is sometimes suspenseful, but it’s also often pretty off-putting. Its titular character is a truly horrendous brat whose indulgence by the world is a disaster every step of the way, and even at 75 minutes, the film is far too long. But, realistically, no one is watching it today for the story, if they ever did so. Instead, we're watching it for how it looks, and in that regard it's spectacular.\n\nExplicitly set-bound, apart from one shot of a man falling over a cliff, the fact that the film was essentially shot in black box is perhaps its greatest asset. Given free rein to create Salomé's world from scratch, producer, co-director and star Alla Nazimova and (her lover…\n\nWhile Salomé might be the character known for her sexual allure, there is no more intense, smoldering sexual chemistry in this film than that of the guard who survives his implicit lover's death. His desire and love scream at you from the look on his face; sometimes I feel like screen performances have never been as great as they were in the silent era. So much has been written about the style of this film, the sets and costumes like something out of a drag ball on Mars, and the rumors of an all-gay cast that I can't add much to it. This is a film of lust and power, where Salomé reduces kings to beggars and only armies can defeat her.\n\nSilent Summer\n\nSalomé exists as an early art film. It is relatively inactive, as in it has very little plot. However it is incredibly stylised. It is completely minimalist, with so much empty space, yet what is designed is extravagant. This is a camp film, of crazy hair styles and skintight costumes. Salomé is all about its atmosphere, and the story itself is dark. Coming from 1922, it represents the era of the Egyptology craze and fascination with the ancient world. Salomé pushes film beyond telling stories, into something a little avant-garde. It may not be an example of great storytelling, but it has a hell of a lot of style.\n\nMy Top Films of the 1920s\n\nMy Top Silent Films\n\nNot world-class filmmaking here, nothing that could remotely compare to your Langs and your Sjostroms... but a project like this one, conceived in theatrical terms, didn't require those particular virtues. It's stage-bound, as a conscious choice; you could almost read it as a dance film and not distort overmuch your understanding of it.\n\nAnd it is sooooooo queeeeeeeeer. I can't think of anything else remotely as nonconforming as this at least until Blood Of A Poet.\n\nOh, let's talk about problematizing the male gaze. If lens and framing are understood to work as an expression of desire, that mechanism works in this film in every direction -- Herod's desire for Salome, Salome's desire for Jokannan, the desire of unnamed male characters for each other... in retrospect, I don't recall any shots that invoked f/f desire, that was an unfortunate lapse. Maybe you can theorize Nazimova's authorship into there as something that serves that purpose."
