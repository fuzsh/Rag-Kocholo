DENVER — In seemingly an instant — though it was actually hours — two Nuggets point guards became one point guard became no point guards.

When Nate Robinson ran off the court midway through the first quarter, he waited until he was safely out of the earshot of the Pepsi Center crowd to shout the expletive that let you know something was really wrong. An initial diagnosis of a left knee sprain confirmed that, and an MRI today will alert the Nuggets medical staff to anything more.

And when Robinson ran off the court, the way the Nuggets had won games all month ran off with him. Pushing the ball was out. Half court was in. An emphasis on getting paint points from big men became vital. Defense went form a luxury to a necessity.

Yet despite an inspired effort — and a near career night out of Randy Foye — there was just too much Al Jefferson for the Nuggets to handle. His 35 points and 11 rebounds led Charlotte to a 101-98 win over the Nuggets Wednesday night at the Pepsi Center.

The Nuggets made them sweat to get it. But the Bobcats got it.

With 1:08 remaining in the game, Foye hit a long two-point shot to tie the game at 95.

But when Jefferson made a push shot with 23.1 seconds to go, the Nuggets found themselves down by three, 98-95.

On the next play, Foye stepped out of bounds on the three-point attempt with 22.2 seconds to go, giving the ball back to the Bobcats.They fouled. Ramon Sessions made the free throws for Charlotte, but the suspense wasn’t done.

Darrell Arthur made a 3-point shot with 10 seconds to go, bringing the Nuggets within one. And they fouled. Gerald Henderson made one of two free throws with nine seconds left to give Charlotte a 100-98 lead.

The ensuing play, Evan Fournier drove the lane and missed a layup. Timofey Mozgov got the rebound, but his putback was blocked. Charlotte came away with the ball with 1.7 seconds left and Jefferson was fouled.
