Derrick Favors made three big foul shots in the final 41.5 seconds to lift the Utah Jazz over the Denver Nuggets, 105-103.

Favors ended with 19 points, seven rebounds and two blocks for the Jazz, who improved to 6-0 at home this season. Al Jefferson added 28 points.

Kenneth Faried had 21 points and nine boards to pace the Nuggets, who had a four-game winning streak snapped. Ty Lawson donated 16 points and nine assists.

"I mean I can't really say much, it's basketball," Faried said. "A team at home, of course the crowd got behind them, and we didn't have the composure that we should have as a team."

Jefferson went 1-of-2 from the line with 4:28 remaining to give Utah a 98-96 lead.

Danilo Gallinari missed a 3-pointer at the other end, but Favors was called for a loose ball foul. Jazz coach Tyrone Corbin was then issued a technical foul. However, Gallinari missed the technical free throw and Kosta Koufos missed a pair of foul shots.

Jefferson made a short jumper to give the Jazz a 100-96 margin with 3:39 to go.

Denver tied the game when Faried and Lawson made layups around Gordon Hayward's missed 3-pointer.

After Jefferson made two free throws, Andre Miller and Gallinari combined to miss three shots on the Nuggets' next possession.

Miller redeemed himself by making a 12-foot jumper to tie the game at 102. Favors grabbed an offensive rebound at the opposite end and was fouled. He made two free throws to give Utah the lead with 41.5 seconds remaining.

Faried made 1-of-2 from the line on Denver's ensuing trip down the court. The Nuggets had a chance to go in front after Jamaal Tinsley turned the ball over. However, Miller missed a shot from beyond the arc.

Favors went 1-of-2 from the charity stripe to give the Jazz a 105-103 edge with 4.3 ticks left on the clock. Utah played great defense at the other end and prevented the Nuggets from getting a shot off.

"I think everybody stepped up," Tinsley said. "I think we all came out in the second half and competed and played hard for the full 24 minutes and we came out with a victory."

Denver shot 72.7 percent from the field in the first quarter to take a 35-24 lead.

The Nuggets led by as many as 16 in the second stanza and took a 65-54 margin into the locker room.

Utah used a 14-0 run midway through the third frame to take the lead. Randy Foye tallied five points during the burst, including a pair of technical free throws to make it 79-77 with 3:24 to go.

Favors recorded a three-point play with 32.5 seconds left to make it an 84-84 contest after three quarters.
