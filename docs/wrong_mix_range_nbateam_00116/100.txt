The Denver Nuggets were founded in 1967 as the Denver Rockets and played in the old ABA until the merger with the NBA in 1976, when they entered the league as the Nuggets. Since then, the team has had various eras of success, qualifying to the playoffs in nine consecutive seasons in the 80s.

While the Nuggets have never won an NBA championship, they do have 9 NBA division titles, their last one coming in 2020. The Nuggets are the last member of the old ABA to never play in an NBA Finals, nonetheless the club has had some memorable players don their jersey. Let’s take a look at the greatest 25 Denver Nuggets of all time!

The mesmerizing but troubled David Thompson was so much fun to watch. A player that could have been much higher on this list if not for his drug abuse.
