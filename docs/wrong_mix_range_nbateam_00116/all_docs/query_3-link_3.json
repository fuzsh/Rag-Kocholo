        "text": "Returns to action Sunday\n\nMurray sat out Friday's exhibition versus France due to rest purposes and will operate off Canada's bench Sunday. The Nuggets' point guard will be one of several NBA players suiting up for Canada during the 2024 Paris Olympics.\n\nShines in SL finale\n\nAlexander flirted with a double-double Saturday and shot 80 percent from the field. The undrafted rookie out of Creighton is on a two-way contract for the 2024-25 campaign but could be playing his way into a rotation spot after averaging 17.2 points, 5.8 rebounds and 1.2 steals per game in Las Vegas.\n\nBattling groin pain\n\nThe issue flared up during Thursday's game, and the Nuggets will cautiously keep Pickett out of its Summer League finale. The second-year guard should be healthy in time for training camp."
