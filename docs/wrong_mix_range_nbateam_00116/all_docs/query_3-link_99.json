        "text": "Michael Porter Jr. has been an integral piece for the Denver Nuggets through the years. In fact, there’s no denying that the 26-year-old played a pivotal role in Denver’s 2023 title run.\n\nThis is exactly why it might come as a surprise for some fans that the Nuggets actually considered trading away the 6-foot-10 small forward this summer.\n\nDenver Nuggets News: Michael Porter Jr. on Trade Block?\n\nThe Nuggets, however, were not willing to let Porter go just for anyone. Apparently, Denver had its eye on Paul George before he decided to take his talents to the Los Angeles Clippers.\n\nAccording to league insider Jake Fischer of Yahoo Sports, the Nuggets toyed with the idea of sending Porter to the Los Angeles Clippers in a potential blockbuster trade deal for George.\n\n“While Porter helped the Nuggets clinch the 2023 championship, Denver already was flirting with the concept of including Porter in a trade to land Paul George this summer, sources said,” Fischer reported.\n\nFischer added a major caveat in his report, though, by stating that Porter’s contract “would have been too daunting for the CBA-conscious Clippers to have truly considered if George had opted in to be traded.”\n\nPorter is under contract through 2027, and he is expected to pocket no less than $115 million over the next three years.\n\nThe Nuggets obviously missed out on George, but this report says a lot about Porter’s status with the team. He’s an undeniably important player, but apparently, he’s not untouchable.\n\nFor More NBA Content:"
