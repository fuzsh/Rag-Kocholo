        "text": "The Denver Nuggets looked to bounce back from a tough opening game in Summer League that not only saw them lose the game, but also their first round pick for the entire season. They faced the Toronto Raptors for their second contest and got through the game in good health but still wound up with the same end result. Julian Strawther and Trey Alexander had big nights but Denver’s starting unit played big minutes and looked gassed down the stretch. That left their late comeback efforts a bit short and they end up losing 84-81.\n\nP.J. Hall and Strawther hit threes to get the Nuggets an early lead while Toronto struggled mightily to get a shot to fall. Another Strawther three put Denver up eight but the Raptors took a timeout and and quickly rattled off a 10-0 run. The Nuggets continued to make good on their three point attempts and that got them back in front. Alexander had some nice plays, including a tough finish through three Raptors, and the Nuggets finished the first quarter leading 24-20.\n\nThe Nuggets started the second quarter with a lineup of guys who aren’t going to make the roster and predictably they struggled to score. Strawther checked back in and knocked down his first three attempt. Outside of him though there wasn’t a ton of offense. Jalen Pickett was struggling mightily, Hunter Tyson also couldn’t buy a basket. Toronto worked their way back into what was a tough game to watch with Denver missing shot after shot. Alexander, Strawther and Hall were pretty much the entirety of Denver’s scoring which proved to be enough with Gradey Dick (and the rest of Toronto) struggling on the other end. Strawther blocked Dick’s three point attempt right before the buzzer and Denver went to half up 43-37.\n\nStrawther picked right back up in the second half of the game. He got to the basket and the free throw line to score Denver’s first six points, then picked up two assists on their next two buckets and then he buried another three. He kept the Nuggets ahead for the majority for the quarter before the second unit once again struggled to score. The Raptors went on a run and took the lead right near the end of the fourth quarter. At the end of the third the Nuggets trailed 65-63."
