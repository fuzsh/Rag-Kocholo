        "text": "The Nuggets’ next trick: Taking their performance in a big win as the home team in London back to their permanent home in Denver.\n\n“Just stay with it, keep playing for each other,” guard Emmanuel Mudiay said Sunday. “We can’t be playing selfish basketball.”\n\nThe Nuggets’ 140-112 win over Indiana was anything but selfish.\n\n– The 140 points was the most any Nuggets team has scored in regulation since they put 168 on Seattle on March 16, 2008.\n\n– Their 52 field goals made were the most for a Nuggets team in nearly three years.\n\n– Their 57.1 percent shooting was the highest in a game in four years.\n\n– The season-high 37 assists were the most the Nuggets have had in a game since dishing out 40 as a team in a game against Houston in 2013.\n\n“I’m just happy that we had a game like that because we needed it after losing five games,” Nuggets coach Michael Malone said. “Now the challenge is shake it out and don’t use jet lag and fatigue as an excuse. We have a game (on Monday) at 3 o’clock and we have to be ready to play.”\n\nTo shake out some of the drop in energy that can come from a nine-hour flight home from London, the Nuggets had an optional practice on Saturday, which was well-attended Malone said. They followed that up with a spirited practice on Sunday in advance of the Martin Luther King Day game against the Magic.\n\nThe rest prior to the London game was a huge help, Malone said. The Nuggets limped into that trip on a five-game losing streak. The Nuggets left for London last Sunday and had three days off before the game.\n\n“We had three, four days there. We had a couple of dinners with the guys,” center Nikola Jokic said. “It really helped us. It was really good to help us to bond a little bit more.”\n\nMalone likened it to the atmosphere coming out of Nuggets’ training camp.\n\n“It’s kind of like when we were in Omaha,” Malone said. “When you’re together as much as you are – and granted most people had guests – there was a lot of interaction with the guys, making sure you’re enjoying the trip and having fun while also getting your work done. I think it was terrific in that regard. Guys were able to spend time together and grow and bond as a team, which always helps. And then to go out and play like we played, which was kind of the icing on the cake.”\n\nORLANDO AT DENVER, 3 p.m. Monday, ALT, 950 AM\n\nSpotlight on Aaron Gordon: Additional playing time has meant more production for the very athletic Gordon, the third-year forward out of Arizona, who nearly won last year’s Slam Dunk Contest. His scoring average (11.6) is up for the third year in a row and he has improved his shooting from the 3-point line for a third consecutive year as well. His 21 points against Utah on Saturday was the sixth time this season he’s topped the 20-point mark.\n\nNuggets: The illness that has spread throughout the locker room has thus far only caused one player to miss a game — Nikola Jokic on Jan. 7 against Oklahoma City. Both Kenneth Faried and Wilson Chandler were dealing with it last week but played in the Nuggets’ win over Indiana in London. Darrell Arthur missed the game in London due to soreness in his left leg and Danilo Gallinari played through ankle soreness.\n\nMagic: Evan Fournier missed the Magic’s last game, at Utah, with a sore right foot. His availability for Monday’s game is to be determined before game time. This is the fifth in a six-game road trip, all through Western Conference cities. The Magic lost Saturday night at Utah. Orlando has lost seven of its last nine games and has lost 11 of its last 13 games against the Nuggets in Denver."
