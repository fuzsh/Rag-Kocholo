        "text": "The NBA postseason is rapidly approaching, with the Play-In Tournament tipping off Tuesday night. The play-in action will be of particular interest to the defending-champion Denver Nuggets, who look primed to finish as a top-two seed in the Western Conference for the second year in a row.\n\nIf Denver winds up as the No. 1 seed, it will play the winner of Friday's final play-in game, which pits the loser of the No. 7 vs. No. 8 matchup against the winner of the No. 9 vs. No. 10 matchup. If the Nuggets slip to No. 2, however, they’ll play the winner of the No. 7 vs. No. 8 game in Round 1.\n\nAhead of Friday night’s NBA games, Denver (56-24) holds a one-game lead over both the Minnesota Timberwolves (55-25) and Oklahoma City Thunder (55-25) for the top seed. That said, the Nuggets would earn the No. 3 seed if all three teams wind up with the same record at the end of the regular season.\n\nAs it stands, three teams — the Los Angeles Lakers, Golden State Warriors and Sacramento Kings — are already locked into the Play-In Tournament, and one of either the Phoenix Suns or New Orleans Pelicans will join them.\n\nSo, which of these teams could give the Nuggets the most trouble in their quest for a repeat? Let’s take a look at the top contenders.\n\nPhoenix Suns\n\nThe Suns are fighting desperately to earn a top-six seed and avoid the play-in, but if they fall into the bottom four seeds, they could prove a formidable foe for Denver in the first round.\n\nPhoenix arguably has two of the top-10 players in the world right now in Devin Booker and Kevin Durant, who are both averaging 27.2 points per game this season. The Suns also took two of three games against Denver during the regular season, including a 104-97 road victory on March 27.\n\nDenver fared slightly better as a team offensively against Phoenix in the regular season than it did against Sacramento, boasting an average offensive rating of 111.5. However, Nikola Jokic only averaged 22.7 points per game while shooting 50% from the field and making just 5-of-15 attempted 3-pointers. For the season, the two-time MVP has averaged 26.6 points per game while shooting 58.1% from the field and 35.8% from deep.\n\nPhoenix center Jusuf Nurkic didn’t play in the last meeting between the two teams, but he presents a solid enough threat to challenge Jokic on both ends of the floor. In the first game between the two teams this season — a 119-111 Denver win — Nurkic finished with a game-high 31 points and was the Suns’ only starter with a positive plus-minus. Nurkic's 108.5 individual defensive rating ranks fifth-best in the NBA.\n\nThese two teams met in last year’s Western Conference semifinals, with the Nuggets advancing in six games. In those games, Jokic averaged a ridiculous 34.5 points, 13.2 rebounds and 10.3 assists, while Jamal Murray contributed 24.8 points and 6.5 assists. For Phoenix, Durant and Booker combined to average 60.3 points per game in the losing effort.\n\nIt would likely take a similar monumental effort from Booker and Durant to take down the defending champs this postseason. But if you’re going to bet on anyone, why not on two of the best scorers of the past decade?\n\nSacramento Kings\n\nIt stands to reason that the team with arguably the best shot to upset the Nuggets would be the one with the best record against them during the regular season. That honor belongs to the Sacramento Kings, who won three of the four meetings between the two sides in 2023-24.\n\nDenver got the better of Sacramento, 117-96, in their most recent matchup on Feb. 28, but that was their only win against the Kings this season. In their four games against the Kings, the Nuggets have an offensive rating of 108.2, well short of the 117.1 they've averaged throughout the season.\n\nSacramento is led by the duo of De’Aaron Fox and Domantas Sabonis, who have proved a formidable foil to Murray and Jokic in their matchups this season. Like Jokic, Sabonis ranks in the top-10 players this season in rebounds (13.7) and assists (8.2) per game. Fox, meanwhile, ranks eighth in the league in points per game (26.7) and is the reigning Clutch Player of the Year.\n\nWhat’s working against the Kings right now is their overall health. Kevin Huerter, who averaged 10.0 points per game against Denver this season, is out for the year with a left shoulder injury. Fellow guard Malik Monk, who averaged 17.3 points per game this year against the Nuggets, is also expected to be out through at least the first round of the playoffs.\n\nDespite the injuries, Sacramento has other role players like Keegan Murray and Harrison Barnes who are capable of picking things up on the offensive end. If they can put together some solid performances and Fox and Sabonis play like their usual selves, the Kings can score enough points to take down anyone — even Denver.\n\nNew Orleans Pelicans\n\nThe only other possible play-in team with a win over Denver during the regular season is the New Orleans Pelicans, who won one of their three meetings with the Nuggets by a score of 115-110 on Nov. 17.\n\nThe Pelicans are among the hottest teams in the Western Conference right now, winning three games in a row ahead of Friday's road matchup with the Warriors. New Orleans has played most of the last month without Brandon Ingram, which has allowed Zion Williamson to take over as the top offensive option for the team.\n\nSince Ingram went down, Williamson has averaged 24.9 points, 5.6 rebounds and 5.2 assists per game while shooting 54.8% from the field. That includes a 31-point performance in a big win over Sacramento on Thursday night.\n\nAlso stepping up of late for New Orleans has been guard Trey Murphy III, who has averaged 16.9 points, 7.3 rebounds and 3.0 assists per game in the 10 games since Ingram went down.\n\nIngram is expected to return for the playoffs, and in 63 games so far this year, he is averaging 20.9 points, 5.1 rebounds and 5.8 assists per game. That said, in his last meeting with Denver, he was held to nine points in 34 minutes on 4-of-11 shooting.\n\nWhere the Pelicans are most formidable is on the defensive end. New Orleans currently ranks sixth in the league in defensive rating (111.8), fourth in points allowed in the paint per game (46.3) and third in steals per game (8.3). In the backcourt, Herb Jones is one of the league’s top on-ball defenders and would be tasked with checking Murray for the majority of the series.\n\nJonas Valanciunas ranks in the top-10 in the league in individual defensive rating (109.8), though Jokic didn’t have many problems dealing with him this year. In their three meetings, Jokic averaged 29.3 points, 13.3 rebounds and 14.7 assists while shooting over 50% in each game.\n\nWhile upsetting the defending champs would be a tall task for New Orleans, the star power of Williamson makes anything possible. If he can channel his inner Jimmy Butler, perhaps Zion can carry his team past Jokic and Co."
