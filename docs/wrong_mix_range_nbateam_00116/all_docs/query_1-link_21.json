Love’s a great offensive rebounder. He’s hard to keep off the boards.”\n\nJefferson was traded to Utah in July for backup center Kosta Koufos and two future first-round picks. The move freed Wolves coach Kurt Rambis from the dilemma of playing Love and Jefferson together. Rambis never felt comfortable having the power forwards on the floor at the same time for extended minutes.\n\nRambis goes high tech: Before Tuesday’s game, Rambis had iPads distributed to the players with videos and illustrations of the team’s plays.\n\nRambis said less than half of his offensive plays and defensive system has been given to the team. When Karl was asked if he had plans of giving his players an iPad, a growing trend among NBA coaches to replace playbooks, Karl replied: “I don’t think I want to have that many plays.”\n\nFlynn continues rehab: Wolves point guard Jonny Flynn, recovering from hip surgery, did not accompany the team to Indianapolis on Tuesday night for tonight’s game against the Pacers. Flynn will continue to go through light workouts today and undergo treatment. He is expected to join the team Thursday in Syracuse, N.Y., for Friday’s game against Detroit at the Carrier Dome.\n\nFriday’s game will be a homecoming for Flynn and rookie Wes Johnson. Both starred at Syracuse but did not play together.\n\n“I wish I could get on the floor for just 30 seconds in that one,” Flynn said.\n\nFlynn has not been cleared for extensive activity. He will be evaluated on his next visit to the Steadman Clinic in Vail, Colo., where he had the surgery in July. Flynn said he has a tentative visit scheduled for next week.\n\nEarly trash talking? After Michael Beasley missed a free throw in the second quarter, a fan sitting near the top of the lower level yelled: “Hey, Beasley, you’re not in Miami anymore!”\n\nBeasley, acquired from Miami in a trade in July, received a warm welcome from fans during pregame introductions. He ended up making 7 of 10 free throws and led the Wolves with 21 points.\n\nBriefly: Wayne Ellington, used as a backup point guard during the Wolves’ two-game trip to Europe, spent most of Tuesday’s game playing his natural position, shooting guard. He finished with 10 points and three assists in 17 minutes off the bench.\n\nLuke Ridnour, the Wolves’ oldest player at 29, earned the team’s first technical foul in the preseason. Ridnour was hit with a technical with 1.1 seconds left in the first half for protesting a foul called on him while defending Denver guard J.R. Smith. The technical will cost him $2,000.\n\nNBA referees have been given the freedom this season to call more technicals to cut down on player complaints.\n\nOriginally Published: October 12, 2010 at 11:01 p.m."
