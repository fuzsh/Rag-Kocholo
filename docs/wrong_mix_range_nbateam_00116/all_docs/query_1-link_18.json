        "text": "NBA Regular Season 2012-2013, Game 15:\n\nDenver Nuggets (8-6) @ Utah Jazz (7-7)\n\n#DENatUTA Game Stream -- Denver Stiffs (SB Nation Blog) -- Nuggets vs Jazz coverage\n\nPlayer Focus: Al Jefferson\n\nx\n\nUhhh. I just did all this reason on writing about Paul Millsap, then I looked at the boxscore for previous Jazz at Nuggets game. Oh my.\n\nIn the last Nuggets game Big Al went 1/9 (11.1 fg%), scored 4 points, and grabbed 11 rebounds. No assists. No Steals. No Blocks. He managed a +/- of -20. He played about half the game. So did Kosta Koufos (the guy who started against him), and The Koof had 15 points, 10 rebounds, 3 blocks, 2 steals, and 1 block. Al Jefferson had his couch effed up by Koufos. Al Jefferson was TRADED for Koufos. This is like a big problem here.\n\nAl needs to play big, and he has at times this season, when Mo Williams is out. So we should focus on him. The Jazz as a team need to come back and defend their honor after the Nuggets kicked out butts. Big Al also has to do this, as he got his butt kicked by freaking Kosta Koufos. Al was on the floor in the last game for the Nuggets' 6-1 run, 6-0 run, 17-2 run, 14-8 run, and was out of the game and did not return.\n\nBig Al needs to do it. He can do it. He has done it before. Please Big Al, deliver us a solid win tonight."
