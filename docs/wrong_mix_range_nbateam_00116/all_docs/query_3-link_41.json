        "text": "Rocky, the Mountain Lion, is a beloved mascot for the Denver Nuggets, entertaining fans with his comedic antics. With a height of 5′10″ and a weight of 154 lbs, Rocky exudes playful energy, making him a famous mascot in the NBA. His impressive 3-foot-long tail further enhances his distinctive charm.\n\nThe first person who started portraying Rocky during Nuggets games was Ken Solomon, a renowned actor, and performer whose notable appearances include “The Shining” (1997). Hailing from Las Vegas, Nevada, Ken debuted as Rocky the Mountain Lion on December 15, 1990, in Denver, Colorado. Ken’s portrayal of Rocky has earned him numerous accolades throughout his career, including induction into the Mascot Hall of Fame in 2008.\n\nKen’s achievements extend beyond traditional mascot duties, as he was recognized with Cartoon Network’s Hall of Game award for “Most Awesome Mascot” in 2013 and crowned NBA Mascot of the Year in 2019. Known for his thrilling stunts, engaging improvisations with the crowd, and remarkable ability to entertain fans of all ages, Ken has left an indelible mark on the NBA.\n\nLike father like son\n\nKen’s legacy is further cemented by his oldest son, who became the mascot for the Cleveland Cavaliers in 2017, making them the first father-son duo to assume mascot duties in professional sports history.\n\nRecently, the beloved mascot, Rocky, underwent a subtle change when his original handler, Kenn Solomon, retired and passed the reins to his son, Drake. This is a heartwarming development for any organization, showcasing a father passing down his legacy to his offspring. Drake has previously worked as a trampoline dunk halftime performer for the Nuggets. Understandably, the story has since gone viral and brought positive attention to the Nuggets."
