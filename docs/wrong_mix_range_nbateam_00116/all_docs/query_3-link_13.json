        "text": "Murray (rest) will play in Sunday's exhibition game against Puerto Rico, Blake Murphy of Sportsnet.ca reports.\n\nMurray sat out Friday's exhibition versus France due to rest purposes and will operate off Canada's bench Sunday. The Nuggets' point guard will be one of several NBA players suiting up for Canada during the 2024 Paris Olympics.\n\nAlexander generated 19 points (8-10 FG, 3-3 3Pt, 6-6 FT), seven rebounds, three assists, a steal and a block across 29 minutes of Saturday's 91-82 win over the Pelicans in Summer League.\n\nAlexander flirted with a double-double Saturday and shot 80 percent from the field. The undrafted rookie out of Creighton is on a two-way contract for the 2024-25 campaign but could be playing his way into a rotation spot after averaging 17.2 points, 5.8 rebounds and 1.2 steals per game in Las Vegas.\n\nPickett won't play in Saturday's Summer League game against the Pelicans due to left groin soreness, Vinny Benedetto of The Denver Gazette reports.\n\nThe issue flared up during Thursday's game, and the Nuggets will cautiously keep Pickett out of its Summer League finale. The second-year guard should be healthy in time for training camp.\n\nMurray won't play in Friday's exhibition game against France due to rest purposes.\n\nIt doesn't appear that Murray has suffered any injury, as his absence from Friday's exhibition is described as a precaution. His next chance to suit up for the Canadian national team is against Puerto Rico on Sunday for another exhibition match.\n\nThe Nuggets announced Tuesday that Strawther will not play for the remainder of the Summer League, Harrison Wind of TheDNVR.com reports.\n\nStrawther hasn't suffered any injury but will sit out the remainder of the Summer League after impressing in his first two outings, averaging 28.5 points. The second-year forward will now allow younger and more inexperienced players to receive increased playing time while he focuses on working toward a more consistent role in Denver's rotation in 2024-25.\n\nHolmes announced via social media that he's scheduled to undergo surgery Monday to repair his torn right Achilles' tendon.\n\nThe first-round draft pick out of Dayton suffered the injury in his first appearance for the Nuggets on Friday in the Las Vegas Summer League. He'll face a lengthy and arduous recovery process from surgery and is expected to miss the entire 2024-25 season, and his availability for Summer League in 2025 could also be affected. The Nuggets had been hopeful that Holmes would slot in as their top backup to Nikola Jokic during the upcoming season, but Dario Saric, Peyton Watson, DeAndre Jordan and Zeke Nnaji now look to be the top contenders to fill frontcourt minutes on the second unit.\n\nStrawther went for 32 points (10-21 FG, 6-12 3Pt, 6-10 FT), five assists, three rebounds, one steal and a block in 34 minutes during Sunday's 84-81 loss to the Raptors at Summer League.\n\nStrawther has been impressive offensively in two Summer League appearances, averaging 28.5 points per game. The Gonzaga product seems to be dealing with a minor ankle injury, so it wouldn't be surprising if he is shut down for the remainder of Summer League considering his performance to this point. Strawther could play his way into the rotation this year if he continues to produce offensively, especially with Kentavious Caldwell-Pope departing for Orlando.\n\nHolmes suffered a torn Achilles in Denver's Summer League loss Friday to the LA Clippers, Ohm Youngmisuk of ESPN reports.\n\nThe Suns selected Holmes with the No. 22 pick in the 2024 NBA Draft and traded him to Denver. He was expected to compete for a role in the Nuggets' frontcourt and was perhaps in line to serve as Nikola Jokic's backup at center. Holmes will face a lengthy rehab process and is expected to miss the entirety of the 2024-25 campaign."
