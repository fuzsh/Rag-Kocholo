        "text": "Does altitude provide the Denver Nuggets with a stronger home court advantage than the average NBA team?\n\nThe evidence points to a fairly definitive “Yes.”\n\nDenver takes pride in its “Mile High City” moniker, and the Nuggets have long made no bones about enjoying the benefits of playing at a high elevation.\n\nFour years ago, the team rolled out a new court design at the Pepsi Center with the numbers “5280” and “300” inscribed by the sideline. The 300 is friendly enough, celebrating the number of sunny days said to occur in the state each year, but the 5280 – the number of feet in Denver’s mile-high altitude – seems to serve as an unnerving reminder to opponents that upon tipoff, they will quickly become fatigued, gasping for breaths of the city’s thin air.\n\nMore important than the court itself, of course, is the basketball played there, and in that regard the Nuggets have historically taken advantage of Denver’s lofty elevation by playing a fast-paced, run-and-gun style which keeps opposing teams on their heels during game play, and bent over grabbing their shorts when the action pauses.\n\nThe Nuggets over time have aggressively exploited their high altitude, having been top ten in pace in 32 of the last 40 seasons, and top five in 25, including being first for 10 of 11 seasons from 1980 to 1991, a time primarily defined by the nearly ten-year Doug Moe era, and top five for 12 consecutive seasons from 2003 to 2015, eight and a half years of which were under the coaching of George Karl (who would eventually bring Moe back on as an assistant).\n\nAnd although the Nuggets’ pace has drifted closer to league average in the recently-launched Nikola Jokic era, where a premium is placed on execution in the half court with the offense flowing through Denver’s star center, their home court advantage over the last three seasons has nevertheless proven to be more potent than league average.\n\nUsing home/road record data from ESPN.com, I calculated that in the three latest seasons starting with 2015-16, the average home record of all teams in the NBA was .584, with an average road record of .416, meaning that teams performed 16.7% better at home than on the road. In the same time frame, the Nuggets went .577 at home and .390 on the road, resulting in a home record that was 18.7% better. And while this difference between 16.7% and 18.7% may seem minor, it translates to 1.6 wins over the course of a full 82-game season, meaning that Denver’s home advantage could be netting them one or two wins more per season than that of the average NBA team – which, as Nuggets fans are painfully aware, could among other things mean the difference between making or missing the playoffs.\n\nAnother possibility, of course, would be that the Nuggets are simply a worse-than-average road team, which would likewise increase the discrepancy between their home and away records. There is an abundance of evidence, however, to support the edge they get from their high altitude being very real.\n\nResearch Confirms the Altitude Advantage\n\nA recent study on randomness in North American sports using betting market odds data (read the full manuscript here and a blog post with a partial summary here) which was conducted by Michael J. Lopez of Skidmore College and Director of Data and Analytics for the NFL, along with Gregory J. Matthews of Loyola University Chicago and Benjamin S. Baumer of Smith College, found that the two NBA teams with the strongest home court advantages – and significantly so – were indeed those at the league’s two highest elevations: the Denver Nuggets, followed by the Utah Jazz.\n\nTheir research showed that the home advantage of these two teams roughly amounted to a full 2.5 wins per season more than the team with the weakest home court advantage, the Brooklyn Nets. Considering that the Nuggets missed the playoffs by a single game and, despite being ninth in the Western Conference, were only three games back behind the third seed Portland Trail Blazers, a two or three game difference could have major implications in a hotly contested playoff seeding race.\n\nFinding that high altitude teams have stronger home court advantages is not necessarily new. Research, for example, of over 25,000 regular season NBA games conducted in 2013 by Jimmy Boyd for his site BoydBets.com found Utah and Denver to have the strongest home advantages, although the coastal Seattle SuperSonics and Golden State Warriors were third and fourth. A similar study by Neil Paine for ESPN also found Utah and Denver to be significant statistical outliers in having the best and second-best home court advantages. Paine presented altitude as a “major factor” in this, with travel distances to their relatively remote locations also possibly playing a part.\n\nIn the newer study by Lopez, Matthews and Baumer, however, what is more striking and perhaps more novel in the case for altitude potentially being the single most influential factor in the home court edges Denver and Utah hold is the comparison of home advantages across the four largest major North American Sports leagues. They found not only that the Nuggets enjoy the strongest home court advantage in the NBA, but additionally that the Denver Broncos and Colorado Rockies are first in home field advantage in the NFL and MLB, respectively. Only the Colorado Avalanche fall short of topping their sport at seventh in the NHL, although that is still relatively strong, and, as Barry Patchesky of Deadspin points out, the Calgary Flames, who play at the league’s second-highest altitude of 3,400 feet, come in first.\n\nBut even with the evidence that indicates Denver’s altitude advantage is real, in the case of the Nuggets in particularthere may be several other dynamics in play which could serve to temper the mile high impact.\n\nPotentially Mitigating Factors: Poor Attendance, Bad Calls, and NBA Scheduling Countermeasures\n\nMuch of determining which teams have the strongest home court advantage depends on how the data is sliced, and which of the multitude of potentially influencing factors are incorporated into the research methodology.\n\nAs one example, in a study conducted by Adam Fromal for Bleacher Report which incorporated home crowd attendance as one contributing factor, the Nuggets did not even make the top ten of teams with the strongest home court advantage.\n\nAnd there is indeed evidence to support the possibility that less crowd support can weaken a team’s home court advantage. A study by Ting Lei published on the site Industrial Engineering ERA, for example found a general correlation between higher crowd attendance and stronger home advantages, though it was noted that particularly popular teams and those with smaller arenas tended to buck the trend.\n\nIf home crowd turnout does play a significant role, it has likely weakened Denver’s home edge of late, with the Nuggets bottoming out among the three teams with the worst attendance records for three consecutive years until climbing to 20th last season, according to data from ESPN.com.\n\nAnd there may be other factors which mitigate Denver’s altitude advantage as well.\n\nIt is not uncommon for NBA fans to express consternation at their favorite team not getting the same heaping helpings of “home cooking” (read favorable officiating in home games) as their opponents seem to get when they face them on the road.\n\nAnd in the case of the Denver Nuggets, there just might actually be something to this beyond an unfounded homeristic sense of injustice.\n\nLast March, FiveThirtyEight’s Chris Herring and the aforementioned Neil Paine reported on the NBA’s “Last Two Minute Reports” using research conducted by The Pudding’s Russell Goldenberg which broke down the results of all of the league’s official reviews of referee performance during the last two minutes of close games up to that point in the 2017-18 season. The results showed that the Nuggets had gotten the third worst treatment in the league overall (including bad calls and bad non-calls) when it came to being wronged by the officials late in games, and fared the worst when looking only at bad calls.\n\nIt is important to emphasize that data for a single year is insufficient to support this being a perpetual, ongoing situation for the Nuggets over seasons-long stretches of time. But at the very least it demonstrates that there is a more complex blend of factors boosting or undermining any team’s home court advantage than elevation alone.\n\nAnd perhaps the most significant of these factors for the Nuggets has been the NBA’s direct actions designed to intentionally counter their altitude advantage going back at least as far as three years ago, as reported in the Denver Post by Christopher Dempsey. Acting on complaints from opposing teams who raised aggrieved cries of unfairness in league meetings, the NBA schedule-makers have bent over backwards to make alterations such as scheduling Denver as the first stop for teams venturing out west, so that the Nuggets receive opponents when they are fresh on their first games of road trips, while their lower-altitude conference rivals get the benefit of playing teams after they have gotten more fatigued and travel-weary. The league has also deliberately scheduled more rest days for teams specifically before they play road games in Denver.\n\nWhether bad officiating, low attendance, deliberately tougher scheduling by the NBA or other factors fully counterbalance or even overcompensate for the boost altitude gives the Nuggets in their home court advantage at Pepsi Center is a complex and open question which seems to require more comprehensive studies covering a wider range of variables to fully clarify.\n\nBut taken in its own right, the research confirming that Denver’s 5280-foot elevation indeed gives the Nuggets a bigger lift than most other NBA teams seems as clear as one of Colorado’s renowned 300 sunny days."
