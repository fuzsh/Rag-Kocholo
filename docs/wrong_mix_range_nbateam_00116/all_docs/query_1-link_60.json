        "text": "Nikola Jokic recorded another triple-double on Thursday night. It was the Denver Nuggets center's first-ever triple-double in a game against the Washington Wizards, and he did it early in the second half at Ball Arena.\n\nJokic, who has played on the Nuggets throughout his entire career, has now recorded a triple-double against all of the Nuggets' NBA opponents.\n\n\"It's a milestone,\" Jokic told Altitude reporter Vic Lombardi in his postgame on-court interview after the Nuggets' 130-110 win over the Wizards. But he didn't really seem all that excited about his final stat line (21 points on 100% field goal shooting, 19 rebounds, 15 assists). The Serbian big man isn't really in the league for the personal accomplishments. He just wants to win another championship.\n\nThe 29-year-old superstar joins a very short list of NBA players to ever reach the feat of recording a triple-double against every opponent they have faced: Jokic, LeBron James and Russell Westbrook.\n\nAccording to StatMuse, Jokic's night was historic for another reason. It's the first time in over 40 seasons that a player has had 20 or more points, 15 or more assists and 15 or more rebounds paired with 100% field goal shooting."
