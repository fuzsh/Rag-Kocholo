        "text": "Derrick Favors made three big foul shots in the final 41.5 seconds to lift the Utah Jazz over the Denver Nuggets, 105-103.\n\nFavors ended with 19 points, seven rebounds and two blocks for the Jazz, who improved to 6-0 at home this season. Al Jefferson added 28 points.\n\nKenneth Faried had 21 points and nine boards to pace the Nuggets, who had a four-game winning streak snapped. Ty Lawson donated 16 points and nine assists.\n\n\"I mean I can't really say much, it's basketball,\" Faried said. \"A team at home, of course the crowd got behind them, and we didn't have the composure that we should have as a team.\"\n\nJefferson went 1-of-2 from the line with 4:28 remaining to give Utah a 98-96 lead.\n\nDanilo Gallinari missed a 3-pointer at the other end, but Favors was called for a loose ball foul. Jazz coach Tyrone Corbin was then issued a technical foul. However, Gallinari missed the technical free throw and Kosta Koufos missed a pair of foul shots.\n\nJefferson made a short jumper to give the Jazz a 100-96 margin with 3:39 to go.\n\nDenver tied the game when Faried and Lawson made layups around Gordon Hayward's missed 3-pointer.\n\nAfter Jefferson made two free throws, Andre Miller and Gallinari combined to miss three shots on the Nuggets' next possession.\n\nMiller redeemed himself by making a 12-foot jumper to tie the game at 102. Favors grabbed an offensive rebound at the opposite end and was fouled. He made two free throws to give Utah the lead with 41.5 seconds remaining.\n\nFaried made 1-of-2 from the line on Denver's ensuing trip down the court. The Nuggets had a chance to go in front after Jamaal Tinsley turned the ball over. However, Miller missed a shot from beyond the arc.\n\nFavors went 1-of-2 from the charity stripe to give the Jazz a 105-103 edge with 4.3 ticks left on the clock. Utah played great defense at the other end and prevented the Nuggets from getting a shot off.\n\n\"I think everybody stepped up,\" Tinsley said. \"I think we all came out in the second half and competed and played hard for the full 24 minutes and we came out with a victory.\"\n\nDenver shot 72.7 percent from the field in the first quarter to take a 35-24 lead.\n\nThe Nuggets led by as many as 16 in the second stanza and took a 65-54 margin into the locker room.\n\nUtah used a 14-0 run midway through the third frame to take the lead. Randy Foye tallied five points during the burst, including a pair of technical free throws to make it 79-77 with 3:24 to go.\n\nFavors recorded a three-point play with 32.5 seconds left to make it an 84-84 contest after three quarters.\n\nGame Notes\n\nDenver's Andre Iguodala was ejected with 3:24 left in the third quarter. He had 10 points ... Tinsley ended with 15 points and six assists ... Jazz guard Mo Williams missed his second straight game with a sprained right foot ... Gallinari tallied 12 points ... The Jazz went 25-of-34 from the foul line."
