        "text": "The Denver Nuggets were founded in 1967 as the Denver Rockets and played in the old ABA until the merger with the NBA in 1976, when they entered the league as the Nuggets. Since then, the team has had various eras of success, qualifying to the playoffs in nine consecutive seasons in the 80s.\n\nWhile the Nuggets have never won an NBA championship, they do have 9 NBA division titles, their last one coming in 2020. The Nuggets are the last member of the old ABA to never play in an NBA Finals, nonetheless the club has had some memorable players don their jersey. Let’s take a look at the greatest 25 Denver Nuggets of all time!\n\nHonorable mentions: Spencer Haywood, Nick Van Exel, George McGinnis\n\n25. Allen Iverson - PG\n\nStats: Points: 24,368, Rebounds: 3,394, Assists: 5,624\n\nAccolades: NBA Most Valuable Player (2001), 11× NBA All-Star (2000–2010), 2× NBA All-Star Game MVP (2001, 2005), 3× All-NBA First Team (1999, 2001, 2005), NBA Rookie of the Year (1997), NBA Rookie Game MVP (1997), 4× NBA scoring champion (1999, 2001, 2002, 2005), 3× NBA steals leader (2001–2003)\n\nChampionships: 0\n\nOne of the greatest players to never win an NBA title, Allen Iverson was a phenomenal basketball player. Iverson’s time with the Nuggets produced some memorable moments as well, he was a 2-time All-Star, and averaged 26 points per game. During the 2007/2008 season Iverson was instrumental in helping the team win 50 games for the first time since 1997/98. His time was short but very memorable, just don’t EVER talk to him about practice.\n\n24. Antonio McDyess - C\n\nStats: Games Played: 1,015 Points Per Game: 12\n\nAccolades: 2001 NBA All-Star, Olympic Gold Medal 2000\n\nChampionships: 0\n\nAntonio McDyess played his best basketball in his two stints, 6 seasons, with the Nuggets. McDyess had incredible leading ability and was a powerful dunker, he averaged 17.8 points and 8.8 rebounds in his first six seasons in the NBA, 5 of them with the Nuggets.\n\n23. Ty Lawson - PG\n\nStats: With the Nuggets: Games Played: 416, Points Per Game: 14.2\n\nAccolades: NCAA champion (2009)\n\nChampionships: 0\n\nTy Lawson was the player the Nuggets pinned their hopes on when Carmelo Anthony left the team. It was an uphill battle for Lawson, but he did his best to play the role of star player. He averaged up to 16/17 points per season near his final run with the team. The Nuggets did qualify for the playoffs in 4 postseasons with Lawson leading the attack.\n\n22. Kenyon Martin - PF\n\nStats: Points: 9,325, Rebounds: 5,159, Assists:1,439\n\nAccolades: NBA All-Star (2004), NBA All-Rookie First Team (2001)\n\nChampionships: 0\n\nIn a small market team, the key is at least having something to root for and when Kenyon Martin was in a Nuggets jersey the team made the playoffs in all of his seven seasons. Martin averaged 12.3 points per game and had 7 rebounds on average. He was the third man on a team that had Carmelo Anthony and Andre Miller among others.\n\n21. J.R. Smith - SG\n\nStats: With the Nuggets: Games Played: 372, Points per Game: 13.7, Rebounds: 3.1\n\nAccolades: NBA Sixth Man of the Year (2013)\n\nChampionships: 2\n\nJ.R. Smith went on to greater things, but his time in Denver cannot be swept under the rug, a fan favorite, free styling three-point shooter and dunker, Smith was all hustle as the sixth man in Denver. He would drive George Karl crazy, but Smith got better year after year.\n\n20. Nenê - C\n\nStats: With the Nuggets: Games Played: 555, Rebounds: 7, Points Per Game: 12.4\n\nAccolades: NBA All-Rookie First Team (2003)\n\nChampionships: 0\n\nNenê was a rebound beast for the Nuggets and was one of the best defenders during his decade stint with the team. One of the leaders in games played for the team the big Brazilian will not be forgotten.\n\n19. T.R. Dunn - SG\n\nStats: Points: 5,033, Rebounds: 4,371, Steals: 1,316\n\nAccolades: 3x NBA All-Defensive Second Team\n\nChampionships: 0\n\nT.R. Dunn played 734 games for the Nuggets and was one of the best defenders in the team's history. A steals expert and a perimeter blocker he took on the best of the best during the 80s. One of the team's most durable players, he missed only four games in eight-years.\n\n18. Wayne Cooper - C\n\nStats: Points: 7,777, Rebounds:6,095, Assists: 1,535\n\nAccolades: Sun Belt Player of the Year 1978\n\nChampionships: 0\n\nWayne Cooper was a rim protector, a hard nose defender who in the 1985/86 season blocked 227 shots! In his 5 seasons with the Nuggets the shot stopping Cooper averaged 9.5 points, 7.4 rebounds and 2.4 blocks.\n\n17. Reggie Williams - SF\n\nStats: Points: 7,508, Rebounds:2,393, Assists: 1,402\n\nAccolades: NCAA champion (1984)\n\nChampionships: 0\n\nReggie Williams played the best years of his career as a Nugget, an experienced journeyman player who shared his wisdom on a young team Williams took his chance with Denver and ran with it. In his six seasons with the team, Williams had over 5,000 points and 632 steals. He averaged 14.2 points per game and was at his best in the 1994 playoffs when he had 30 points against the Sonics in Game 3 of the first-round series. A team player that was Reggie Williams.\n\n16. LaPhonso Ellis - PF\n\nStats: Points: 7,410, Rebounds:4,032, Assists: 981\n\nAccolades: NBA All-Rookie First Team (1993)\n\nChampionships: 0\n\nLaPhonso Ellis was one of the Nuggets best players in the mid 90’s, going for an average of 15.2 points per game and 7.9 rebounds in six years. Ellis knew how to find spaces especially when opposition were watching a certain guy by the name of Dikembe Mutombo. Ellis was a good attacking option on those 1990s Nuggets teams.\n\n15. Nikola Jokić - C\n\nStats: Games Played: 381, Points Per Game: 17\n\nAccolades: 2× NBA All-Star (2019, 2020)\n\nChampionships: 0\n\nNikola Jokić can be considered one of, if not, the face of the modern-day Nuggets. A two-time NBA All-Star, Jokić has been one of the team's most consistent performers, going for 17 points per game in his five seasons with the team. In the playoffs he has raised his game as he averages 24.7 in the postseason. The big Serbian will lead the Nuggets in the 2020/2021 season.\n\n14. Jamal Murray - PG\n\nStats: Games Played: 297, Points Per Game: 15.6\n\nAccolades: NBA All-Rookie Second Team (2017)\n\nChampionships: 0\n\nJamal Murray is another one of those young players Nuggets fans are banking on. In his four seasons in Denver, last year was his best season to date as the 23-year-old is entering the prime of his career. Both Murray and Jokić are high on this list because they are the faces the team is building around for the future.\n\n13. Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf - PG\n\nStats: Points: 8,553, Rebounds: 1,087, Assists: 2,079\n\nAccolades: NBA Most Improved Player (1993)\n\nChampionships: 0\n\nMahmoud Abdul-Rauf was a bench player when he arrived in Denver but quickly became the league's most improved player in 1993. Abdul-Rauf was an effective free throw shooter at 91.6 percent, and had 7,029 points in six seasons.\n\n12. Byron Beck - F\n\nStats: Points: 8,603, Rebounds: 5,261, Assists: 978\n\nAccolades: No. 40 retired by Denver Nuggets\n\nChampionships: 0\n\nWe go back to the ABA days with Byron Beck, he played most of his career in the ABA and only one in the NBA. Beck had… 5,261 rebounds! The master of an impressive hook shot Beck has 8,603 points total for the Nuggets. Beck was a part of four divisional championship sides.\n\n11. Ralph Simpson - SG\n\nStats: Points: 11,785, Rebounds: 2,616, Assists: 2,357\n\nAccolades: 5× ABA All-Star (1972–1976)\n\nChampionships: 0\n\nRalph Simpson was another one of those ABA pioneers, in six seasons with the team he set multiple records, with 10,130 points, seventh-best 1,950 assists and ninth-best 519 games. While he only played 1 NBA season with the Nuggets, you can’t forget your roots and Simpson was an attraction during the ABA days.\n\n10. Bobby Jones - PF\n\nStats: Points: 11,391, Rebounds: 5,739, Assists: 2,522\n\nAccolades: 4× NBA All-Star (1977, 1978, 1981, 1982), 8× NBA All-Defensive First Team (1977–1984), NBA All-Defensive Second Team (1985), NBA Sixth Man of the Year (1983)\n\nChampionships: 1\n\nBobby Jones is one of the best Power Forwards in Nuggets history, he was also a pretty good defender. A four-time All-Star, Jones shined in his time in Denver and eventually went on to win a title with the 76ers.\n\n9. Marcus Camby - C\n\nStats: Points: 9,262, Rebounds: 9,513, Blocks:2,331\n\nAccolades: NBA Defensive Player of the Year (2007), 2× NBA All-Defensive First Team (2007, 2008), 2× NBA All-Defensive Second Team (2005, 2006), 4× NBA blocks leader (1998, 2006–2008)\n\nChampionships: 0\n\nMarcus Camby was a beast in defense for the Nuggets, being one of the best defensive players in the league year in and year out. A master protecting the perimeter and the rim he was as tough as they came, and the Nuggets knew that with Camby at the back they were almost impenetrable. Camby would move on to greater things but fans will always remember him.\n\n8. Dikembe Mutombo - C\n\nStats: Points: 11,729, Rebounds: 12,359, Blocks: 3,289\n\nAccolades: 8× NBA All-Star (1992, 1995–1998, 2000–2002), 4× NBA Defensive Player of the Year (1995, 1997, 1998, 2001), 3× NBA All-Defensive First Team (1997, 1998, 2001), 2× NBA rebounding leader (2000, 2001), 3× NBA blocks leader (1994–1996), No. 55 retired by Denver Nuggets\n\nChampionships: 0\n\nDikembe Mutombo had his number retired by two teams, let that sink in. The finger wag, the best defender in team history and arguably the entire NBA. All you need to do is look at his accolades, his five seasons were defensive clinics for the opposition.\n\n7. Kiki Vandeweghe - F\n\nStats: Points: 15,980, Rebounds: 2,785, Assists: 1,668\n\nAccolades: 2X NBA All-Star\n\nChampionships: 0\n\nKiki Vandeweghe was a fan favorite during his playing days, a strong power forward averaged around 20 points per game for 5 seasons, his best season coming in his last with 29.4 points per game. Vandeweghe would become the GM of the Nuggets and while it was not the best tenure, no one can forget what he did as a player.\n\n6. David Thompson - SG\n\nStats: Points: 13,422, Rebounds: 2,446, Assists: 1,939\n\nAccolades: 4× NBA All-Star (1977–1979, 1983), NBA All-Star Game MVP (1979), 2× All-NBA First Team (1977, 1978), No. 33 retired by Denver Nuggets\n\nChampionships: 0\n\nThe mesmerizing but troubled David Thompson was so much fun to watch. A player that could have been much higher on this list if not for his drug abuse. Thompson had a 70+ points game once and was skillful and athletic.
