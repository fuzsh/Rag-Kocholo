GINNANE\n\nProducer, distributor and commentator, Melbourne / Los Angeles. President of FG Film Productions (Australia) Pty Ltd / IFM World Releasing Inc.; currently producing Patrick and Blowback in Australia.\n\nTop 10 (Eligibility: 2012 theatrical, festival or premiere DVD first release in the USA, Canada, Australia or New Zealand – listed alphabetically by title)\n\nJodaelye Nader az Simin(A Separation, Asghar Farhadi, 2011)\n\nExtraordinarily stylish thriller – elegantly balancing passion and pain in an alien landscape.\n\nThe Grey (Joe Carnahan, 2012)\n\nMan against the elements. Man against animals. A taut Cornel Wilde piece that grows progressively bleaker and nihilistic.\n\nAmour (Michael Haneke, 2012)\n\nSurprisingly gentle, emotional and heartfelt tale of death and grief told with the clinical, but never cynical Haneke eye.\n\nKiller Joe (William Friedkin, 2012)\n\nFriedkin’s obsession with pathological excess reaches new heights in this cocktail of decadence and perversity blended with a macabre sense of humour.\n\nPolisse (Maïwenn, 2011)\n\nMelville meets Giovanni with a feminist Hawksian edge. Cops under pressure in a tough job.\n\nArgo (Ben Affleck, 2012)\n\nAffleck is well on his way to assuming Eastwood’s mantle as the last classicist. A blend of ‘70s political thriller, procedural and Hollywood inside joke.\n\nEnd of Watch (David Ayer, 2012)\n\nModernist Richard Fleischer / Richard Brooks update filtered through a cinema-verite style.\n\nSerbuan maut (The Raid: Redemption, GarethEdwards, 2011)\n\nA reverse of John Carpenter’s Assault on Precinct 13(1976)and Howard Hawks’ Rio Bravo (1959) (with the heroes on the outside). Pitch perfect low budget action thriller.\n\nTrouble with the Curve (Robert Lorenz, 2012)\n\nEastwood’s shadow looms long over this work by his acolyte Lorenz. Ruminations on old age, father-daughter relationships and the Eisenhower American past consume this simple yet moving tale.\n\nHaywire (Steven Soderberg, 2012)\n\nKinetic pop art sparking off a balletic performance by Gina Carano and Soderberg’s weary post Contagion (2011) worldview.\n\nOther titles that have excited or inspired me during the year include:\n\nSherlock Holmes – A Game of Shadows (Guy Ritchie, 2011)\n\nHodejegeme (Headhunters, Morten Tyldum, 2011)\n\nUnderworld Awakening (Mans Marlind, Bjorn Stein, 2012)\n\nSavages (Oliver Stone, 2012)\n\nLooper (Rian Johnson, 2012)\n\nMargin Call (J.C Chandor, 2012)\n\nVous n’avez pas rien vu (You Ain’t Seen Nothing Yet, Alain Resnais, 2012)\n\nMoonrise Kingdom (Wes Anderson, 2012)\n\nPrometheus (Ridley Scott, 2012)\n\nLawless (John Hillcoat, 2012)\n\nMan with the Iron Fists(RZA, 2012)\n\nSkyfall (Sam Mendes, 2012)\n\nMagic Mike (Steve Soderberg, 2012)\n\nKilling Them Softly (Andrew Dominik, 2012)\n\nThe Dark Knight Rises(Christopher Nolen, 2012)\n\nBeasts of the Southern Wild (Benh Zeitlin, 2012)\n\nIn Darkness (Agnieszka Holland, 2012)\n\nArbitrage (Nicolas Jarecki, 2012)\n\nSeven Psychopaths (Michael McDonagh, 2011)\n\nAbraham Lincoln – Vampire Hunter (Timur Beckmambetov, 2012)\n\nCHIRANJIT GOSWAMI\n\nResides in Winnipeg, Canada, where a number of notable 2012 movies have yet to arrive, so he regrets not being able to attend TIFF this past fall.\n\nBest Films of 2012\n\nMoonrise Kingdom (Wes Anderson, 2012)\n\nArgo (Ben Affleck, 2012)\n\nLincoln (Steven Spielberg, 2012)\n\nThe Master (Paul Thomas Anderson, 2012)\n\nKiller Joe (William Friedkin, 2011)\n\nLooper (Johnson, 2012)\n\nHaywire (Steven Soderbergh, 2012)\n\nSilver Linings Playbook (David O.

Amour (Michael Haneke, 2012)\n\nAt this moment, this is my favourite Haneke film of those I’ve seen, mainly because he is not afraid to show feelings, which undoubtedly affect the audience. A sensation that makes you empathise with the main characters, and not just regard them with shock at their actions (as in earlier Haneke films). The two leads easily bestow the best acting of the year and the finest examples of ‘senior’ acting, surpassing any young people with expectations, while trying to overcome their own limits. Beautiful and tear-worthy, this is the best film of the year in its script, direction, acting and framing, and easily the best movie of the decade that just began.\n\n2. The Dark Knight Rises (Christopher Nolan, 2012)\n\nOne of the biggest movies that came out this year, it also happened to be one of the best that I saw. Maybe it is the weakest link of the three films, but it’s like saying that one of the stars in the sky shines less than the others… in the end it’s still a star. Having a thematic consistency has been a great thing for Christopher Nolan and his films, and the theme of rising and resurrection of the characters in the film is one that is followed visually, musically and in the script, giving it a powerful message and keeping the audience on the edge of their seats through the entire runtime. The last hour is so suspenseful that one better check one’s body before seeing it, for they may have a hard time sitting down after being so tense about how the situations will play out. Batman is indisputably now out of our lives and I’m ready for something completely different.\n\n3. Indie Game: The Movie (Lisanne Pajot, James Swirsky, 2012)\n\nHow can a documentary so specific in its world- and subject-matter be so inspiring and great? How have two first-time directors managed to create one of the best edited, best shot and most beautiful documentaries of recent years? Here is a commentary on modern art and, more broadly, on the way creativity works, indifferent to the actual subject matter: video games. It looks good, it sounds good, it has a narrative, it makes you care and love the people that are in it, you are immersed in their problems and you celebrate their triumphs. It’s been a while since a debut film has blown me out of the water so profoundly and greatly. Truly, this is a masterpiece and one of the films that may start the debate on the subject of “why are we debating whether video games are art when they so obviously are?”\n\n4. Holy Motors (Leos Carax, 2012)\n\nMagic was the only word that I could come up with when the film finished playing and the applause was heard from the audience. What is the reasoning behind all that is happening? Who cares, really? There is this character played to perfection by Denis Lavant transiting and playing different roles in a world that seems to be ours but at the same time isn’t, as doubles and doppelgängers roam the city in white limousines conducted by ghostly figures who seem to be connected to God, while their talking cars are as holy as their motors. Does it make sense to you? No? Well, it is an experience to be felt in your mind and body and for your own pleasure. A great love letter to cinema, as much as Leos Carax doesn’t want it to be.\n\n5. Safety Not Guaranteed (Colin Trevorrow, 2012)\n\nSometimes a film just blindsides you, and that is the case with this indie comedy with elements of science fiction. The plot and the characters initially seem simple, but then the film begins to narrate something much more profound, something relating to the relationship between ourselves as human beings. We are taught to understand people’s emotions and reasons, no matter how crazy they are, if you have a passion you must follow it all the way to the other side of the world if you need to. This is a film that surprises with its ending, its superb acting and more than anything, its feelings.\n\n6. Gyakuten saiban (Ace Attorney, Takashi Miike, 2012)\n\nVideo game adaptations aren’t at the top of the list in anyone’s mind, but here comes Takashi Miike to shut us up, because here we have a great and emotional adaptation of a video game, that feels like one and looks like one. It is funny and suspenseful, following the beats and tropes of Japanese gaming culture as well as the world that was created for the Ace Attorney series of games. One marvels at the images, the colours, the special effects and the style in every frame.\n\n7. Moonrise Kingdom (Wes Anderson, 2012)\n\nAs Wes Anderson moves closer to the world of children, he moves closer to my heart. It is true that Fantastic Mr. Fox was his first film that I actually liked, and with this one he comes across as a wonderful filmmaker who knows his audience and his tropes. On this occasion however he utilises them within an emotional storyline about true love and emotional connection at an innocent age. There are some unforgettable moments in this one. Great, great, great.\n\n8. Where the Eagles Fly (Carlos Klein, 2012)\n\nIt is a strange and awkward sensation when you find a “making-of” (sorta) of another film to be better than the film itself, well, that is the case in this film directed by the Chilean director Carlos Klein, who followed Victor Kossakovsky through the shooting of his latest film Vivan las Antipodas! (2011), and in some way makes up for the failings of that latest film, by splitting time between narrative and character-based moments and the beautiful imagery of the world. Here we find out that Kossakovsky is one odd fellow, a character one could watch on a reality show and never be bored of (now, that is something I never thought I’d say).\n\n9. The Avengers (Joss Whedon, 2012)\n\nThe biggest, loudest, most incredible film of the summer deserves those adjectives, mainly because it’s a dream come true. It’s better than all the other Marvel movies because the direction manages to give each character substantial screen time. Also, the personal narratives are present in a story that tries to encapsulate everything that they represent as a team trying to defend the world at every moment. A movie for the fans and for people who like movies as spectacle.\n\n10. Las cosas como son (Things as They Are, Fernando Lavanderos, 2012)\n\nChilean cinema has come into its own this year, in terms of films appearing in festivals and winning prizes internationally, and this is one of the best narrative Chilean films in a year more dominated by documentaries. Directed in a personal and economical way, this film tells the simple story of a young house owner, who rents his rooms to foreign students who have come to Chile for short-term stays. Summer comes and he is left alone with a Norwegian woman who is taking summer classes. Their relationship and how it builds is a thing of discovery of acting and great moments. Truly, one of the best moments at the cinema this year.\n\n11. La chica del sur (The Girl from the South, José Luis García, 2012)\n\nA documentary from Argentina that twists around and finds trouble in South Korea regarding one of the most famous people in the country: the girl of unification, who is still alive today.\n\n12. Ruby Sparks (Jonathan Dayton & Valerie Faris, 2012)\n\nA fantasy that works, feels and looks like a fairytale that comes from the most beautiful and at the same time the darkest place of our minds. Greatly acted.\n\n13. Gyo (Gyo: Tokyo Fish Attack, Takayuki Hirao, 2012)\n\nMainstream Japanese anime has never been this gross and unsettling. A film that manages to make you feel sick, as the smell of dead fish gets into your nose.\n\n14. [REC]³ Génesis (Paco Plaza, 2012)\n\nA complete diversion from the first two films in the best way possible. This is good handling of the franchise, entertaining, gory and intelligent in its script and characters.\n\n15. Pieta (Kim Ki-duk, 2012)\n\nStrong Korean drama from one of the country’s master directors. Acted and framed amazingly, a tour de force from all the characters, and a marvellous choice for a main character.\n\n16. Argo (Ben Affleck, 2012)\n\nThis film won me over when it inserted me in the process of the production of a fake film and how it related to the issues of Iran. The last half hour is superb and a lesson in editing.\n\n17. Las mujeres del pasajero (The Women of the Passerby, Patricia Correa & Valentina MacPherson, 2012)\n\nAn impressive short documentary about the women who work at a motel in Santiago de Chile: their stories, their loves, their experiences with the clients in this place.\n\n18. Skyfall (Sam Mendes, 2012)\n\nOne must be blind to notposit this as one of the best examples of cinematography today. The colours and the action alone make it worth watching.\n\n19. De jueves a domingo (From Thursday to Sunday, Dominga Sotomayor Castillo, 2012)\n\nWinner of the Rotterdam Film Festival’s Tiger competition, this film is in this list because it reminds me of my life and my travels with my parents. Nostalgic.\n\n20. Dareun naraeseo (In Another Country, Hong Sang-soo, 2012)\n\nHong Sang-ZOOM!\n\nLEE HILL\n\nWriter based in London, England. Author of A Grand Guy: The Art and Life of Terry Southern and a BFI book on Easy Rider.\n\nShame (Steve McQueen, 2011)\n\nDamsels in Distress (Whit Stillman, 2011)\n\nThe Kid With A Bike (Le Gamin au vélo, Jean-Pierre & Luc Dardenne, 2011)\n\nAqui y alla (Here and There, Antonio Mendez Esparza, 2012)\n\nNo (Pablo Larraín, 2012)\n\nV tumane (In The Fog, Sergei Loznitsa, 2012)\n\nMuseum Hours (Jem Cohen, 2012)\n\nBig Star: Nothing Can Hurt Me (Drew DeNicola, 2012)\n\nBarbara (Christian Petzold, 2012)\n\nFor No Good Reason (Charlie Paul, 2012)\n\nThe Master (Paul Thomas Anderson, 2012)\n\nAmour (Michael Haneke, 2012)\n\nReissues\n\nF For Fake (Orson Welles, 1975), End of the Road (Aram Avakian, 1970), Lawrence of Arabia (David Lean, 1962), Heaven’s Gate (Michael Cimino, 1980), In the Year of The Pig (Emile Antonio, 1968), Bonjour Tristesse (Otto Preminger, 1958)\n\nOverrated\n\nSkyfall (Sam Mendes), the career of Christopher Nolan (who was given, God help us, a retrospective at the BFI Southbank this year…a programming low in an otherwise strong year. The Dark Knight Rises will ultimately be remembered for showing Anne Hathaway can kick ass with the best catwomen) and the notion of “serious” blockbusters in general.\n\nNotes\n\nA distinct dropping off in terms of quality and variety from the previous year. With the New York Film Festival celebrating its 50th Anniversary and Sight & Sound publishing its once in a decade Critics/Directors poll, it seemed the greatest pleasures I had were in watching non-2012 films. Whether it was Marnie on DVD or F For Fake at an arthouse in Bloomsbury, pouring over the results of the S&S poll or marvelling at the eclectism of the NYC programmers, the best of 2012 was more likely to be found in another part of the time/space continuum that is Cinema History.

So here are the new films that had the biggest impact on me in the last 12 months, in the order in which I saw them.\n\nAkunin (Villain, Lee Sang-il, 2010)\n\nAn amour fou with power and sympathy.\n\nJodaeiye Nader az Simin (A Separation, Asghar Farhadi, 2011)\n\nIts acclaim is well deserved.\n\nHugo (Martin Scorsese, 2011)\n\nI could wallow in this wonderful film over and over and over.\n\nTyrannosaur (Paddy Considine, 2011)\n\nNot a joyous viewing experience, but powerful.\n\nBir zamanlar Anadolu’da (Once Upon a Time in Anatolia, Nuri Bilge Ceylan, 2011)\n\nA procedural can be so much more than just a whodunit.\n\nLike Someone in Love (Abbas Kiarostami, 2012)\n\nThe tribute to Ozu that rings true not in style but in humanity.\n\nTabu (Miguel Gomes, 2012)\n\nA fascinatingly rich and complex exploration of different ways of telling a story.\n\nPatience (After Sebald) (Grant Gee, 2011)\n\nIn description it sounds like a set of study notes for a book, but it transcends that to be a rich experience in its own right.\n\nCesare deve morire (Caesar Must Die, Paulo and Vittorio Taviani, 2012)\n\nA performance explores Shakespeare with depth and incredible contemporary relevance.\n\nThe Master (Paul Thomas Anderson, 2012)\n\nThis masterpiece will get richer with each viewing, I am sure.\n\nI should also note Werner Herzog’s humane achievement with both Into the Abyss (2011) and the related four-part documentary series On Death Row (2012).\n\nCERISE HOWARD\n\nFreelance writer, peregrine film critic, and Artistic Director of the Czech and Slovak Film Festival, debuting in Melbourne in 2013.\n\nScreen cultural highlights for the year that was 2012\n\nBest seen in, or shortly to be in, general release in Melbourne:\n\nZero Dark Thirty (Kathryn Bigelow, 2012)\n\nExhausting, with barely a misstep. For a film with the hunt for Osama Bin Laden as its principal narrative concern, it’s a powerful, unexpected rejoinder to all those who carped about Bigelow’s becoming the first woman to win a Best Director Oscar, for the very boysy The Hurt Locker (2008), as being only a qualified triumph for feminism.\n\nLes Misérables (Tom Hooper, 2012)\n\nIt peaks far too early, but what a peak! Anne Hathaway’s performance of “I Dreamed a Dream” is a wrenching revelation.\n\nHighly honourable mentions:\n\nChronicle (Josh Trank, 2012), The Artist (Michel Hazanavicius, 2011); La source des femmes (The Source, Radu Mihăileanu, 2011), Hearat Shulayim (Footnote, Joseph Cedar, 2011), Lore (Cate Shortland, 2012), Polisse (Maïwenn, 2011), Hail (Amiel Courtin-Wilson, 2011), I Am Eleven (Genevieve Bailey, 2011), Argo (Ben Affleck, 2012), All The Way Through Evening (Rohan Spong, 2011), Shame (Steve McQueen, 2011), The Cabin in the Woods (Drew Goddard, 2011)\n\nBest (first) seen at the Melbourne International Film Festival:\n\nHoly Motors (Leos Carax, 2012)\n\nAs magnificently surreal a piece of hand-wringing fence-sitting over the whole analogue-digital cusp period clusterfuck we are all of us surprised to find has so suddenly caught up with us, as one could possibly ever hanker for. Absolutely, singularly brilliant.\n\nHighly honourable mentions:\n\nKiseki (I Wish, Hirokazu Koreeda, 2011), Tabu (Miguel Gomes, 2012), Poulet aux prunes (Chicken with Plums, Marjane Satrapi and Vincent Paronnaud, 2011), Alois Nebel (Tomáš Luňák, 2011), Like Someone in Love (Abbas Kiarostami, 2012), Beasts of the Southern Wild (Benh Zeitlin, 2012), Love Story (Florian Habicht, 2011), Call Me Kuchu (Katherine Fairfax Wright and Malika Zouhali-Worrall, 2012)\n\nBest animated works:\n\nRomance (Georges Schwizgebel, 2011)\n\nBobby Yeah (Robert Morgan, 2011)\n\nTram (Michaela Pavlátová, 2012)\n\nTatsumi (Eric Khoo, 2011)\n\nBest seen elsewhere, in the wider world:\n\nHistórias Que Só Existem Quando Lembradas (Found Memories, Júlia Murat, 2011)\n\nCountdown (Huh Jong-ho, 2011)\n\nXiao Shi Da Kan (Honey PuPu, Chen Hung-I, 2011)\n\nSerbuan maut (The Raid: Redemption, Gareth Evans, 2011)\n\nMiss Bala (Gerardo Naranjo, 2011)\n\nKeep the Lights On (Ira Sachs, 2012)\n\nIn Search of Avery Willard (Cary Kehayan, 2012)\n\nNot least for the anthropological work performed in the fictionalised-yet-actual documentary film-within-the-film.\n\nLaurence Anyways (Xavier Dolan, 2012)\n\nHors les murs (Beyond the Walls, David Lambert, 2012)\n\nBest retrospectives:\n\nNocturnal Transmissions: The Cinema of Guy Maddin at ACMI\n\nAlready a glorious, unexpected feast for a Maddin devotee such as myself, Maddin’s co-curation of the event led to some truly inspired, delirious double bills, like his Keyhole (2011) running back-to-back with, if anything, the even more gleefully demented Hausu (House, Nobuhiko Ôbayashi, 1977).\n\nHighly honourable mentions:\n\nJean Epstein: Bonjour Cinema at MIFF and, all courtesy of The Melbourne Cinémathèque: Immortal Stories: The Living Cinema of Raúl Ruiz; Elia Kazan: The Outsider; The Power of Desire: The Decadent Visions of Josef von Sternberg; Borderlines: Selected Works by Claire Denis.\n\nEverything is cinema, more or less: Greatest extra-cinematic happenings of 2012:\n\nJan Švankmajer: Dimensions of Dialogue – Between Film and Fine Art in the House at the Stone Bell in Prague’s Old Town Square (26 October 2012 – 3 February 2013)\n\nRoom after Rudolphinian room a-glut with Švankmajeriana. Magical, obsessive, capital-S Surrealist objects abound, all riffing on relationships, direct or indirect, with Švankmajer’s 48-year-long filmic output. Featured one film, whether long or short form, looping in its entirety in each room, and with the exhibition’s great plenty of uncanny objects organised correspondingly. Magnificent!\n\nYet, an even bigger, albeit far more fleeting, personal Švankmajer highlight for 2012 was finding myself locking eyes with the man himself as he disembarked from a tram immediately before me early one chilly November morning in Prague, ahead of promptly scuttling into the Malostranská metro station, thence, one can only presume, to undergo some sort of Archimboldo-esque transformation, to transmutate into an oversize marionette, or somesuch…\n\nSlovanská epopej (The Slav Epic, Alfons Mucha, 1912-1928), now hanging permanently, if not without controversy, at Veletržní Palace, a campus of the National Gallery in Prague\n\nI was struck, over the necessary three hours of my first viewing and attempted digestion of the Art Nouveau titan’s 20-colossal-canvas-strong magnum opus, how much “The Slav Epic” has, in fact, in common with the particular art form to have been the most nouveau of all in its time.\n\nThe years of its production largely correspond with that in which cinema’s vocabulary was being established. Is it any coincidence, then, that Mucha’s masterwork, spanning 20 big screens and several hundred years of historical narrative, is full of visual devices recognisable from the cinema, from extreme close-ups and expressionistic lighting effects, through to direct addresses “to camera” and vignetted elements superimposing phantastical elements upon scenes rooted in reality (if a reality with which Mucha is acknowledged to have taken a few liberties)?\n\nOK – it might be a stretch to press a claim for “The Slav Epic” as cinema, per se, but, nonetheless, Mucha’s breathtaking masterpiece is my big screen event of the year.\n\nWilliam Kentridge: Five Themes at ACMI\n\nFive Themes was, for me, ACMI’s best exhibition since Eyes, Lies & Illusions back in 2006-07, with which it had quite a bit more in common than I had anticipated. Kentridge’s three model theatres prepared for his 2005 production of the Mozart opera The Magic Flute, replete with film projections, automata and interrogations of the worst excesses of colonialism, were especially magnificent.\n\nGeorges Schwizgebel exhibition in theCantonal and University Library, Fribourg, Switzerland\n\nA fascinating, treasured look behind-the-scenes at the methodology employed by the Swiss supremo in producing his gorgeous, painterly, Escherian animations.\n\nGoblin during Melbourne Music Week\n\nGoblin, best known for their prog rock soundtracks to several of Dario Argento’s best films, graced Melbourne with two shows, one an out-and-out greatest hits rock package at the Melbourne Town Hall using, if not as heavily as the hype might have suggested, the Grand Organ, and the other a live score to Suspiria (Dario Argento, 1977). I had never imagined I’d ever witness either.\n\nWith Suspiria, the liveness of the music, the sheer improbable, unprecedented actuality of its being Goblin performing that extraordinary score beneath the big screen of ACMI Cinema 2, more than countered the diminution of the experience brought about by a projection of a quality which sadly didn’t do the extraordinary visual beauty of the film justice. Still: Goblin! In Melbourne!\n\nGenesis Breyer P-Orridge – Q&A with Stuart Grant of the Primitive Calculators at ACMI, courtesy of Speakeasy Cinema\n\nA fascinating, consciousness-raising discussion and promotion of pandrogyny, featuring a perfect match of interviewee and interlocutor in the wake of a screening of Marie Losier’s marvellous documentary, The Ballad of Genesis and Lady Jaye (2011).\n\n2012’s greatest triumph for film culture in Melbourne:\n\nThe social media-led campaign ensuring that Melbourne’s sole remaining single-screen picture palace of yesteryear, St Kilda’s grand Art Deco Astor Theatre, is still with us and, indeed, even flourishing!

There are two reasons: one is that inevitably films that fall into the NEW/NEW category will include a disproportionately higher number of films that have not yet gotten (or, mostly likely, never will get) a theatrical run in the US. This is either because they are festival features too risqué for whatever reason, or they are shorts in some form or another – usually “avant-garde” or “experimental” shorts, which essentially have no official popular release outlet in theatres in the States and can therefore never make “official” critics’ polls for the year at more conservative and unadventurous venues than this one. The second reason, and an easy and simple one, is that 2012 was a banner year for repertory viewing in New York, where I’m based. These included Anthology’s silent and sound Epstein program, IFC Center’s John Carpenter program (to get a large 35mm Carpenter retro in NYC now it has to be shown in a “Midnight” series!), Film Forum’s William A. Wellman series, the collaborative project on Jean Rouch between French Institute Alliance Française and Anthology, David Phelp’s short but essential program putting together a small salvo of filmmakers neglected in the city (Rousseau, Moullet), the as-luck-would-have-it appearance of Soviet films not directed by Eisenstein and Tarkovsky (MoMA’s limited but still new to me Mezhrabpom program; Film Society of Lincoln Center’s nearly unattended but nevertheless complete Aleksei German retrospective); and MoMA’s ever more vital To Save and Project series, which is essentially (and should be marketed as such, like Bologna and Pordenone) a festival of retrospective restorations and preserved prints. This local repertory scene was combined with my festival travels: a good sign of a good film festival is that it features a healthy retrospective element; the sign of a really good one is when the retrospective program is so strong that it actively competes with the new films for everyone’s attention. The Oberhausen, New York and Vienna film festivals all revealed new, wonderful things to me that were “old”. As film viewing shifts more and more to downloads, on demands, and streams, the majority of popular moviewatching and access to movies will be (and certainly already is via hard software like DVDs and Blurays) “retrospective,” and so while I do want to apologise for the length of this list and particularly of titles that seem to have no relevance, perhaps, to you in 2012, I think it is indicative of a shift of the zeitgeist towards individuals accessing cinema of the past more and more often. Except, because I am very lucky, I got to see these almost exclusively projected on film – an experience more and more regarded as something passed. Yet when engaged on filmitself, that past is always present, both “live” and “alive”. So woe-be any reader who finds a list of the films I first saw and discovered on home video or digitally at home this year!\n\nCHRISTOPHER KEARNEY\n\nIndependent screenwriter and teacher of TV Production and English at George M. Steinbrenner High School, Lutz, Florida.\n\nMoonrise Kingdom (Wes Anderson, 2012)\n\nHearat Shulayim (Footnote, Joseph Cedar, 2011)\n\nThe Perks of Being a Wallflower (Stephen Chbosky, 2012)\n\nArgo (Ben Affleck, 2012)\n\nKari-gurashi no Arietti Kari-gurashi no Arietti (Arrietty, Hiromasa Yonebayashi, 2010)\n\nLincoln (Steven Spielberg, 2012)\n\nPolisse (Maïwenn, 2011)\n\nLe Gamin au vélo (The Kid with a Bike, Jean-Pierre Dardenne & Luc Dardenne, 2011)\n\nThe Deep Blue Sea (Terence Davies, 2011)\n\nSerbuan maut Serbuan maut(The Raid: Redemption, Gareth Evans, 2011)\n\nSIMON KILLEN\n\nMelbourne-based distributor.\n\nTen films that rocked my world in 2012:\n\n1.Holy Motors (Leos Carax, 2012)\n\nMorning premiere at Cannes this year, I stopped in to see what Kylie Minogue was doing in there, and had my hair blown backwards by the sheer audaciousness of this epic piece of WTF??\n\n2. Wish You Were Here (Kieran Darcy-Smith, 2012)\n\nWe Australians have a very odd relationship with Asia, and this film tugs at that oddness brilliantly. Everything looks bright and shiny whether in Sydney or Cambodia, but what lurks beneath is consistently disturbing. Smart cinema this, a firecracker.\n\n3. Margaret (Kenneth Lonergan, 2011)\n\nTook forever to be released, looks snapping fresh. Smart and in love with Manhattan, fills the space that Woody Allen used to inhabit, while being nothing like a Woody Allen film.\n\n4. Bernie (Richard Linklater, 2011)\n\nEffortlessly fascinating, sympathetic and plain funny at times. Jack Black in an underneath-the-radar performance that I dug.\n\n5. The Avengers (Joss Whedon, 2012)\n\nI think the screen I saw this one was four inches wide, but it’s so well constructed that I never felt it. The best distillation of the spirit of Marvel Comics yet. Iron Man to Thor: “Does thou mother knoweth thou wear her drapes?”!!!\n\n6. Hugo (Martin Scorsese, 2011)\n\nTook the kids to see this at The Astor Cinema in Melbourne, the best decorative, vintage cinema in Australia. Marty would have liked that. Great love letter to cinema and childhood by Scorsese.\n\n7. Side By Side (Christopher Kenneally, 2012)\n\nHosted by Keanu Reeves (no, come back…), this documentary on the transition from celluloid to digital just floored me with what I DIDN’T know about the medium in which I work. It’s a consistently entertaining feast of details about cinema that no-one can afford to miss.\n\n8. Amour (Michael Haneke, 2012)\n\nI’ve never really had a whole lot to say after watching a Haneke film. They just percolate over the weeks, months and years. This one feels better and better in my mind, I can’t wait to go see it again. Unforgettable acting too, if you like that kind of thing – Emmanuelle Riva and Jean-Louis Trintignant in the house. Literally.\n\n9. Killing Them Softly (Andrew Dominik, 2012)\n\nThis and The Master tussled for the “man, that’s a dense film that’s clearly a work of genius, but does it connect in the end?” section of my year’s 10. And this one made it, cause the characters absolutely did convey the themes that Dominik was shooting for. Well, I reckon they did, and this is my list.\n\n10. Journal de France (Raymond Depardon & Claudine Nougaret, 2012)\n\nAdmission: I bought this film at Cannes, but I’ve seen it four times now, and am no less thrilled each time I see it. Depardon and his producer/wife Claudine Nougaret give us a widescreen view of France, past and present, and a great working model of an effective creative relationship.\n\nAnd a word on films I caught this year, which would have made last year’s list if I had been a little quicker:\n\nL’exercice de l’État(The Minister, Pierre Schöller, 2011)\n\nRango (Gore Verbinski, 2011)\n\nand one more note before going back into my cave:\n\nDrew Goddard’s The Cabin in the Woods is an absolute blast, and my # 11.\n\nRAINER KNEPPERGES\n\nFilmmaker, Cologne, Germany.\n\nMy 50 favourite films seen in 2012 for the first time or again after years, in cinemas in Bologna, Cologne, Düsseldorf, Hamburg, Istanbul or simply at home.\n\nIn chronological order, my momentary mini-history of film\n\nBarcelonne (Segundo de Chomón, 1912)\n\nDet Hemmelighedsfulde X (The Mysterious X, Benjamin Christensen, 1914)\n\nMale and Female (Cecil B.

Holy Motors (Leos Carax, 2012)\n\n2012’s whirling dervish of movie love and cinematic excavation, ringmastered by a fearless squad of Denis Lavants.\n\n2. Moonrise Kingdom (Wes Anderson, 2012)\n\nWes Anderson marries the literally handcrafted dollhouse aesthetic of his last film, Fantastic Mr. Fox, with the facility for young actors on display in Rushmore and The Royal Tenenbaums in his most comically poignant evocation of childhood yet.\n\n3. Cosmopolis (David Cronenberg, 2012)\n\nThe other great limousine film of 2012 finds a perfectly-cast Robert Pattinson as a vacant master of capital surveying the rebellious world his kind created, sleek and digitised but absent of value.\n\n4. Tabu (Miguel Gomes, 2012)\n\nAn enchanting, bifurcated tale of cold post-colonial modernity and wistful erotic passion right under imperialism’s nose, in both glorious black-and-white and veritable silence.\n\n5. ParaNorman (Chris Butler and Sam Fell, 2012)\n\nThis stop-motion wonder is gorgeously fluid in style and refreshingly morbid in its outlook, reveling in its protagonist’s outsider status.\n\n6. Tchoupitoulas (Bill Ross IV and Turner Ross, 2012)\n\nThree young brothers missing their ferry home from New Orleans is the mere pretext for an affectionate nighttime odyssey of the post-Katrina French Quarter.\n\n7. Looper (Rian Johnson, 2012)\n\nA fleet genre mash-up with emotion to spare, pitting established newcomer Joseph Gordon-Levitt against Bruce Willis, he of the action firmament.\n\n8. Barbara (Christian Petzold, 2012)\n\nAs sure and suspenseful as Petzold’s previous movies, with Nina Hoss’s brave visage bringing home the true cost of putting the political ahead of the personal.\n\n9. The Master (Paul Thomas Anderson, 2012)\n\nOne of the most divisive films of the year, I found it a mysterious and captivating vehicle for two wildly divergent powerhouse performances and PTA’s unerring eye.\n\n10. Dareun naraeseo (In Another Country, Hong Sang-soo, 2012)\n\nThe vagaries of international releasing means that the US received an abundance of Hong riches this year, with In Another Country as the one true “new release” premiere. It embraces its breezy slightness with some new wrinkles in the usual setup, most notably Isabelle Huppert as a cultural outsider and a riotously funny turn by regular Yoo Jun-sang as a horny lifeguard.\n\nA few 2012 US premiere favourites\n\nThe following made their non-festival premieres within the US in 2012 (and I didn’t include them in last year’s Senses of Cinema poll):\n\nBook chon bang yang (The Day He Arrives, Hong Sang-soo, 2011)\n\nDamsels in Distress (Whit Stillman, 2011)\n\nThe Deep Blue Sea (Terence Davies, 2011)\n\nIn film nist (This is Not a Film, Jafar Panahi, 2011)\n\nOslo, 31. august (Oslo, August 31st, Joachim Trier, 2011)\n\nMARC LAURIA\n\nMarc Lauria wrote the screenplay for Dartworth (Andre Seager, 2011), and can say that cinema is not dead!\n\nOne-of-a-kind:\n\nKeyhole (Guy Maddin, 2011)\n\nTabu (Miguel Gomes, 2012)\n\nBeware of false prophets:\n\nBeyond the Hills (Cristian Mungiu, 2012)\n\nMartha Marcy May Marlene (Sean Durkin, 2011)\n\nThe Master (Paul Thomas Anderson, 2012)\n\nChild is father to the man:\n\nBeasts of the Southern Wild (Benh Zeitlin, 2012)\n\nHearat Shulayim(Footnote, Joseph Cedar, 2011)\n\nMargaret (Kenneth Lonergan, 2011)\n\nMoonrise Kingdom (Wes Anderson, 2012)\n\nNo (Pablo Larraín, 2012)\n\nHappy families:\n\nAmour (Michael Haneke, 2012)\n\nJodaeiye Nader az Simin (A Separation, Asghar Farhadi, 2011)\n\nMAXIMILIAN LE CAIN\n\nExperimental filmmaker, Cork, Ireland.\n\n2012 was, quite simply, the year of Carax’s ineffably refreshing, profoundly moving and unpredictably necessary Holy Motors. I was also blown away byA Torinói ló (The Turin Horse, Béla Tarr, 2011) and Dignity (James Fotopoulos, 2012).\n\nBeyond that, I’d like to propose a local list, a postcard from my far-flung corner of cinema.

So this a partial, limited list of films that I considered remarkable in some regard, but which I definitely enjoyed.\n\nAnd there is no better way to start than by mentioning the first screening in Havana of a definite cinematic gem, Rainer Werner Fassbinder’s Satan’s Brew (merely another of his films, each of them a masterpiece), a film that delves into the theme of representations in life, art, and beyond. From here I move to the ubiquitous Hollywood share with peaks such as Ridley Scott’s Prometheus and Gary Ross‘s Hunger Games; the first a serious look at humanity’s journey on earth, the second a vision of a dehumanised future society not very far from our own, but both succumbing to the unavoidable action-spectacle pace. Also in Hollywood but within an independent streak: Patricia Riggen’s Girl in Progress and Jason Reitman’s Young Adult reveal respectively the socially and psychologically less favoured corners of the American dream.\n\nSteve McQueen’s Shame, an all-British film that takes place in New York, shows a pair of characters contending with lust, loneliness and themselves. Another British film, Lynne Ramsay’s We Need to Talk About Kevin, takes place in the severe environment of the middle class, where nothing but evil grows up lavishly. The French surprised with a variation of The Sleeping Beauty – or The Snow Queen? – that turns out to be director Catherine Breillat’s retelling of the Belle endormie fairytale. With French dialogue, and a setting in bleak northern France, Finnish director Aki Kaurismäki’s Le Havre tells a quintessential story of human love and solidarity.\n\nFar to the East, Polish films proved to maintain their greatness with Wojciech Smarzowski’s Rose, naturalist and lyrical at the same time, as it passed through the cultural and political turmoil of the aftermath of World Word II. Suicide Room by fellow Pole Jan Komasa turns to new media in an attempt to express the angst of young people in the world today.\n\nThe Cuban cinema, in spite of its small number of productions, keeps offering prodigious films – for instance, Juan Carlos Cremata’s Chamaco, a gritty, exemplary fable. Veteran Enrique Pineda Barnet’s Verde verde, a vital immersion of two male characters in the abyss of homophobia, proved his mastery of storytelling. Surprisingly within the subgenre of zombie flicks, Alejandro Brugués’s Juan of the Dead managed to become the most significant and internationally acclaimed Cuban film of recent years. 7 Days in Havana, by a clutch of international directors, promises to become a cult favourite, in spite of its uneven stories.\n\nIn the thriving excellence of contemporary Latin American cinema, Brazilians are still able to excel through films of unique artistry, think of this year Cláudio Assis’s Rat Fever or Marcelo Gomes’s Once Upon a Time Was I, Verônica. Argentine cinema showed new aesthetic horizons with the quasi-ethnographic but ultimately poetic look of Alejandro Fadel’s The Wild Ones, 2012. Just before I finished these lines the Havana Festival awarded Pablo Larraín`s No (2012) and Andrés Wood’s Violeta se fue a los cielos(Violeta Went to Heaven, 2011) (which would surely be sure included here if I had managed to see them).\n\nSatansbraten (Satan’s Brew, Rainer Werner Fassbinder, 1976)\n\nPrometheus (Ridley Scott, 2012)\n\nHunger Games (Gary Ross, 2012)\n\nGirl in Progress (Patricia Riggen, 2012)\n\nYoung Adult (Jason Reitman, 2011)\n\nShame (Steve McQueen, 2011)\n\nWe Need to Talk About Kevin (Lynne Ramsay, 2011)\n\nLa Belle Endormie (The Sleeping Beauty, Catherine Breillat, 2010)\n\nLe Havre (Aki Kaurismäki, 2012)\n\nRóza (Rose, Wojciech Smarzowski, 2011)\n\nSala samobójców (Suicide Room, Jan Komasa, 2011)\n\nChamaco (Juan Carlos Cremata, 2010)\n\nVerde verde (Enrique Pineda Barnet, 2012)\n\nJuan de los Muertos (Juan of the Dead, Alejandro Brugués, 2011)\n\n7 días en La Habana (7 Days in Havana, Laurent Cantet, Benicio Del Toro, Julio Medem, Elia Suleiman, Juan Carlos Tabío, Pablo, 2012)\n\nA Febre do Rato (Rat Fever, Cláudio Assis, 2012)\n\nEra uma vez Eu, Verônica (Once Upon a Time Was I, Verônica, Marcelo Gomes, 2012)\n\nLos salvajes (The Wild Ones, Alejandro Fadel, 2012)\n\nMIGUEL MARÍAS\n\nEconomist; former Director of the Spanish Film Archive (1986-88); wrote for most Spanish film magazines, now for foreign online ones.

Following that, this list is barely reflective of 2012 as a year in cinema since the finest tend to trickle down for months after the year ends. And though currently screening, I have yet to see The Master.\n\nHoly Motors (Leos Carax, 2012)\n\nMoonrise Kingdom (Wes Anderson, 2012)\n\nAi to makoto (For Love’s Sake, Takashi Miike, 2012)\n\nResident Evil: Retribution (Paul W.S.

So, 2012 for me was made of these films that I saw between January 1 and December 10.\n\nIt’s necessarily a different, and more inclusive, list from my ten best released in Portugal in 2012, a ranked list restricted to commercial releases between Jan 1 and Dec 31 (for the record, #1 was Joachim Trier’s Oslo August 31, #2 Béla Tarr’s Turin Horse, both of which I saw in 2011).\n\nThe 30 titles below, shorts and features alike, are films I saw, enjoyed, admired, appreciated; films that engaged, questioned, intrigued, challenged, disturbed, delighted me; films that for one or another reason stuck like glue.\n\nRanked in alphabetical order\n\nAmour (Michael Haneke, 2012)\n\nL’Anabase de May et Fusako Shigenobu, Masao Adachi et 27 années sans images (The Anabasis of May and Fusako Shigenobu, Masao Adachi and 27 Years without Images, Éric Baudelaire, 2011)\n\nAnna Karenina (Joe Wright, 2012)\n\nL’Apollonide – Souvenirs de la maison close (House of Tolerance, Bertrand Bonello, 2010)\n\nBellamy (Inspector Bellamy, Claude Chabrol, 2008)\n\nBin zamanlar Anadolu’da (Once Upon a Time in Anatolia, Nuri Bilge Ceylan, 2011)\n\nBonsái (Bonsai, Cristián Jiménez, 2011)\n\nThe Cabin in the Woods (Joss Whedon, 2012)\n\nCesare deve morire (Caesar Must Die, Paolo & Vittorio Taviani, 2011)\n\nCloud Atlas (Lana Wachowski, Tom Tykwer & Andy Wachowski, 2012)\n\nDespués de Lucía (After Lucía, Michel Franco, 2012)\n\nDeus e o Diabo na Terra do Sol (Black God, White Devil, Glauber Rocha, 1964)\n\nElena (Andrei Zvyagintsev, 2011)\n\nFlamingo Pride (Tomer Eshed, 2011)\n\nHaywire (Steven Soderbergh, 2012)\n\nInto the Abyss (Werner Herzog, 2011)\n\nLooper (Rian Johnson, 2012)\n\nO Que Arde Cura (As the Flames Rose, João Rui Guerra da Mata, 2012)\n\nPythagasaurus (Peter Peake, 2011)\n\nThe Radiant (The Otolith Group, 2012)\n\nShame (Steve McQueen, 2012)\n\nO som ao redor (Neighbouring Sounds, Kleber Mendonça Filho, 2012)\n\nStilleben (Still Life, Sebastian Meise, 2011)\n\nT"
