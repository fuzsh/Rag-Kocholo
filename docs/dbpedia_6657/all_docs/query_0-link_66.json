        "text": "Iâ€™ve just read my 2022 Writing Year in Review post, (you can read it here) and can assure you, I didnâ€™t manage to stick to my carefully thought out first half of the year. Indeed, the only aspect I seem to have stuck is taking it a bit easier in December. Iâ€™ve not left myself with a huge looming deadline, although I havenâ€™t accomplished all I might like to have done. But then, I often have unrealistic expectations of myself.\n\nSo, what have I been writing/editing in 2023? Itâ€™s time to turn to my trusty diary to find out.\n\nIn January, I submitted The Royal Women Who Made England: The Tenth Century in Saxon England a few days late â€“ I didnâ€™t correctly calculate how long the editing process would take. I was also working on book 2 of the Brunanburh series â€“ this was a massive rewrite, adding 50% more content to the original version, and I was reediting A Conspiracy of Kings, ready for its book birthday in February. On a side note â€“ it also seems that I undertook some much needed TLC on my iMac, which Iâ€™ve written down as â€˜taking all afternoon.â€™ I think it might have slightly annoyed me, but the beast has been working much better ever since. But yes, I didnâ€™t understand what I was doing in replacing the SSD hard drive but Iâ€™m glad I did. I also took a trip to Gloucester and I know I spent the entire train journey there, and back, editing Kings of War! (The things you remember). I have decided that if I ever struggle with a deadline, Iâ€™m just going to hop on a long train journey. Itâ€™s the ultimate means of isolating yourself.\n\nIn February, I was writing Protector of Mercia â€“ which wasnâ€™t my working title, and so has confused me as I put this together, and also editing Eagle of Mercia, not once but twice (copyedit and proofread), while King of Kings was released on 10th February.\n\nFor March, I set myself four pretty huge tasks â€“ Iâ€™ve written them down on 1st March. But how did I get on? I finished the proofread for Eagle of Mercia. I worked on the structural edit for Kings of War, AND I was reediting Warrior King ready to have it made into an audio book, narrated by the trusty and fabulous Matt Coles.\n\nWhile working on Clash of Kings, I discovered, much to my annoyance that Limerick in Ireland was not at all where I â€˜thoughtâ€™ it was, and so had to do a large rewrite. My geography is woeful. I should have taken the time to check before I started writing the scene. I was also editing Protector of Mercia, which I sent to my editor on 31st March. I also went to work for a week in the school AND we moved house. Jeez. What a month. It seems that my fourth project didnâ€™t even get a look in (Iâ€™m not surprised). Letâ€™s see what happened in April.\n\nApril began with a scramble for my internet connection, having moved house. I was due to present for The History Quill on 4th April. Luckily, the internet worked after a few stupid mistakes on my part. I finally made it back to my missed project 4 in March, which was The Kingâ€™s Brother, which I edited and continued to write. I also wrote a short story. And, I was working on some form of edits for Protector of Mercia and Kings of War. All the frantic activity of the last few months paved the way for my Summer holiday in Orkney â€“ the temperature peaked on the last day in the middle of May at 13 degrees, and I came home with a burned bright red face. The light is just different in Orkney. It was a glorious two weeks away, very much in isolation on one of the more northerly islands. We fell foul of the ferry running aground, but we managed to book an alternative route home.\n\nMay 3rd saw the release of Eagle of Mercia, and I came back to two weeks of very long hours during the summer exam period at my local school. I spent my weekends working on structural edits for Protector of Mercia, and even managed to sneak in a trip to London for the Boldwood Books summer party. I spent the last week in May frantically editing The Kingâ€™s Brother, which I should have done months before. I didnâ€™t get much writing done in these two months, and I knew I wouldnâ€™t, thatâ€™s why March had been such a mad month.\n\nJune was another busy month, but not in terms of writing. I participated in Ã†thelfest at Tamworth and by the end of the month I had (and Iâ€™ve not written this down) worked on some edits for Clash of Kings. It also saw the release of The Kingâ€™s Brother. It had been very hard to return to the world of the Earls of Mercia, but with the help of Lady Godgifu, a character I developed substantially for the book, I felt it worked really well.\n\nJuly 12th saw the release of Kings of War and I was once more embroiled in editing, both Protector of Mercia and my non-fiction title, as well as the structural edit from hell for Clash of Kings because of a problem when Iâ€™d converted it in Vellum, managing to muddle all the chapters. August saw me beginning work on Icel book 6, now Enemies of Mercia, and I really tried to concentrate on the title as I felt Iâ€™d done little â€˜newâ€™ writing for quite some time.\n\nSeptember saw the release of Protector of Mercia, and I held my first Zoom with readers to celebrate the release. It went really well. I was copyediting Clash of Kings, and also working on the first proof for The Royal Women of the Tenth Century, and producing the index for it. When that was done, I got back to Enemies of Mercia which was nearly finished, but not quite. The index stretched to 13 pages. It was a huge task. Next time I write a non-fiction title, I might miss out everyoneâ€™s names.\n\nOctober saw Enemies of Mercia sent to my editor, and some more work which took me away from my desk. But, never fear readers, November was just around the corner, and that meant it was time for National Novel Writing Month, and a very, very welcome return to the world of Coelwulf from The Last King, but not before the final proofread for Clash of Kings.\n\nIn November I wrote, wrote, wrote. Not as much as in the past, but I was determined to get back to a good daily habit, and so I didnâ€™t push myself until I had time to write 5k a day, which wasnâ€™t until later in the month, as I had a structural edit for Enemies of Mercia to work on. And the second proof for The Royal Women also arrived in my inbox.\n\nFor December, remember above I said I had to be kinder to myself, Iâ€™ve given myself the time to finish writing The Last Viking, the new Coelwulf book, as well as writing a short story on my way home from London, and Iâ€™ve also got a final proof for The Royal Women Who Made England to look at. On the whole, a much quieter December to that of 2022, and far more enjoyable. Itâ€™s hoped this will recharge my batteries for what I hope will be a busy 2024, with another Coelwulf, Icel, Earls of Mercia and something new in the pipeline.\n\nIn terms of words written this year, a very rough tally sets it at about 340k, which is one of my lowest since 2017 â€“ see my little chart below. (I canâ€™t correctly determine all of the words written â€“ I sometimes wish Word tracked how many words I deleted as well as how many I added). This might also be because some of my record keeping has been poor. My most prolific day was March 28th when I wrote 7000 words.\n\nFor 2024, Iâ€™m determined to work on my planning â€“ not always easy with structural, copyedits and proofreads coming at me from all angles, but I am going to try and ensure I have more periods of time when I can write in a sustained way. I only managed this for three months in 2023. My style of writing means that I have to write quickly, or, quite frankly, I lose the thread of the story. I am, after all, a pantser, not a planner, and my characters very much lead the story. Sometimes, I need to give them a bit of time to decide what it is they intend to do.\n\nForthcoming releases with be Clash of Kings, The Royal Women Who Made England, The Last Viking and Enemies of Mercia. There will also be the fourth part of The Brunanburh Series later in the year. I had thought 2024 would be a quieter year, but clearly not.\n\nIf you want to follow my writing journey, join my newsletter. I update readers each month, and you can also join my Facebook group.\n\nI will be sharing my reading year in review soon â€“ thereâ€™s a lot of historical mystery in there:)\n\n2022 has been a busy writing year. Routine has been important, as has setting firm deadlines and also having some well-deserved time off. Iâ€™ve also distracted myself from my constant need to write by taking a few weeks away from the keyboard to work my very part-time job. People think Iâ€™m nuts, but the only way to dampen down my mind is to fill it with something else! It helps that I can trust myself to get things done and knuckle down when I need to. Iâ€™m adopting the same approach to 2023. Iâ€™ve already got the first six months mapped out writing-wise.\n\nSo, what have I been writing/editing in 2022?\n\nIn January, I re-edited Pagan Warrior and finished writing Wolf of Mercia.\n\nIn February, I edited Cragside and started work simultaneously on Warrior of Mercia and The Last Seven while also editing Pagan King. I worked myself hard because I knew what was coming later in the year.\n\nI continued to work on Warrior of Mercia and The Last Seven throughout March, and finished my first draft of Warrior of Mercia in April. This allowed me to start work on my first non-fiction book, due out sometime in 2024 with Pen and Sword books.\n\nDuring May and June, I had a bit of a hiatus as I was on a wonderful holiday in Orkney and also working my part-time job. But I did complete an edit on Warrior of Mercia during the late May half-term, so I did a bit of writing:)\n\nWhen I finally got back to my writing in July, I was back to working on The Last Seven, having completed my copyedits for Warrior of Mercia.\n\nThroughout August, I worked on what is now King of Kings, and also devoted the month to my non-fiction project.\n\nDuring September, I wrote a lot more for King of Kings, having decided to play around with the original book, and began work on Icel 4, which I finished the first draft of in October. I also worked on a short story that precedes the events in King of Kings.\n\nAnd then, I spent November working on the next book in the Earls of Mercia series, The Kingâ€™s Brother, while during December, I returned to my non-fiction project, did some editing on Icel 4, now entitled Eagle of Mercia, and worked on my non-fiction book. I also completed an edit on The Lady of Merciaâ€™s Daughter to go with the fabulous new cover.\n\nFor all my careful planning, December was a very full-on month, and I worked right up until 6pm on 23rd December because I needed to get some editing done. Next year, I need to be a bit more wary of just how short December can feel.\n\nIn terms of words written this year, I donâ€™t keep a strict record, but I would place it at about 500,000. I donâ€™t think itâ€™s my biggest tally to date, but itâ€™s still been very busy. For anyone curious about my writing routine, Iâ€™ll be presenting on it for The History Quill masterclass in April 2023. You can find the details on the link. I think a good daily routine is so important for writers, and so Iâ€™m going to be talking about how I do what I do:)\n\nI also took the time to attend several conventions, virtually (The History Quill Convention, The HNSNA one-day convention, and the IMC in Leeds â€“ which feeds my non-fiction needs) as well as in-person (The HNS Conference in Durham, and one on the Bamburgh Bones). I tried my hand at Saxon-era embroidery and of course, spent more time making mugs at the local pottery. I might have shared photos of my slightly wonky attempts.\n\nI canâ€™t see that I did a post on my writing throughout 2021, but I have found my 2020 post about my writing during Lockdown.\n\nIf you want to see what I was reading during 2022, then check it out here.\n\nWow! I think 2022 has been the year that I read (and listened) to the most books EVER! As I write this, Iâ€™m up to 99 titles. I have some â€˜holidayâ€™ reading Iâ€™m keen to do as well â€“ fingers crossed I make it to the magic 100 for the year (I am including audiobooks in this, and also my own books as I have to read them A LOT, and Iâ€™ve also been refreshing a few throughout the year as well.) Even so, Iâ€™ve read many, many books, across a number of different genres, but the predominant one has certainly been historical mysteries/cozy crime. Iâ€™ve found that this is my â€˜happyâ€™ place when trying not to think about my own books. And luckily, Boldwood Books (who publish the Eagle of Mercia Chronicles) have a huge collection of mystery writers, and theyâ€™ve autoapproved me on Netgalley, so Iâ€™ll never struggle to find something to read in my favourite genre.\n\nAs has been pointed out to me by a fellow author, I donâ€™t often award a five star review to books. Indeed, while I do rate and review on Amazon and Goodreads, on the blog, I donâ€™t tend to give a rating â€“ Iâ€™m just quirky like that. Those books that I have given a five star to, Iâ€™ve given a shout out in the Aspects of History Books of 2022. You can find the link here â€“ (of course, these are all historical fiction books) and The Capsarius, Valentia, Twelve Nights and The Maids of Biddenden made it onto that list (and yes, these are all books I was lucky enough to be asked to review on the blog â€“ but I never automatically give a 5 star review just because of that). I also want to add Domitian by SJA Turney as well. I couldnâ€™t include two of his books on Aspecs of History but Domitian is wonderful, just my sort of Roman story with plenty of politics, intrigue, and some fabulous characters.\n\nThree of these books are indie-published, and I can assure you all, that thereâ€™s a huge amount of amazing indie stuff out there. Donâ€™t believe me, try one of these titles:)\n\nIâ€™ve also treated myself to a bit of comedy this year. Iâ€™ve been listening to the Terry Pratchett Discworld audio books (the new and the original recordings â€“ but not the abridged versions) and itâ€™s reminded me of how much I love a funny book, and so, here are my favourite comedies of the year. Simon Whaleyâ€™s Foraging for Murder, Dead in Tune by Stephanie Dagg and Crazy for You by Domhnall Oâ€™Donoghue and Unseen Academicals by Terry Pratchett, which Iâ€™ve listened to twice!\n\nIn terms of cozy crime, Iâ€™ve found a few new series of which Iâ€™m certainly going to read more. Catherine Coles new 1940s historical mystery series, TA Williamsâ€˜ Armstrong and Oscar cosy series, Debbie Youngâ€™s St Brides Series, and Helen Goldenâ€™s Right Royal Cozy Investigations.\n\nIn terms of books set in â€˜myâ€™ time period, Iâ€™ve been reading Matthew Harffy, SJA Turney or maybe itâ€™s a Simon Turney one (itâ€™s the same author, in case you were confused), Peter Gibbons, Christopher Cervasco, Donovan Cook, Eric Schumacher, Paula De Fougerolles, Richard Cullen, and still historical but a little before and after, Robert M Kidd, Elizabeth R Andersen, Mark Knowles, Dan Jones and Kate Shanahan.\n\nIâ€™ve also dipped my toe into a few dual-timeline novels. As you might expect, my interest is always much more in the historical aspect of the story and not the modern settings, but they were a bit of fun when I was on holiday. The Witches Tree and The Storm Girl.\n\nIâ€™ve only read one fantasy book in 2022, which surprises me (aside from Discworld), but Mark Lawrence is one of my all-time favourite authors, and I will always read his books. The sneaky toad has a theme running through them all and I love it.\n\nIâ€™ve also read surprisingly few non-fiction books, in their entirety. Iâ€™ve been working on my non-fiction book and thatâ€™s meant a lot of dipping in and out of books Iâ€™ve already read. But, the non-fiction books Iâ€™ve read have been excellent, Michael Woodâ€™s 40th anniversary of In Search of The Dark Ages, reviews for Aspects of History, Winter in the World by Eleanor Parker, also reviewed for Aspects of History and I also read my first ever writing guide.\n\nAnd an entirely new genre for me, but one I was strangely drawn to for the location, which is close to where I grew up â€“ a bit of Gangland.\n\nI hope youâ€™ve enjoyed reading my reviews on the blog. And Iâ€™d like to that the publishers that let me read advanced copies, and also, all the writers Iâ€™ve mentioned whoâ€™ve taken the time to craft these novels so that I can devour them. Now, I need to get back to my reading to make sure I hit that magic 100!\n\nToday, Iâ€™m delighted to welcome Meredith Allard to the blog with a post about the historical research she undertook to write her book Down Salem Way.\n\nIâ€™ve been reading, editing, and writing historical fiction for many years. As a matter of fact, Iâ€™ve even written a book about how to write historical fiction called Painting the Past: A Guide for Writing Historical Fiction. Thank you to M.J. for allowing me space on the blog today to share my thoughts on one of my favorite subjects.\n\nThe way I research historical fiction has changed a lot over the years. When I first started writing historical fiction, I would check as many books as I could carry out of the library, take meticulous notes, color code my notes with highlighters (blue for food, pink for fashion, etc.), return those books and check out another pile, and so on until I felt I had enough knowledge to begin drafting my story. Sometimes it was months worth of research before I started writing anything. Once I started writing I knew exactly where to look in my notebook for what I needed. If I was writing a dinner scene, I could find my notes about food. Notes I referred to often, such as important dates or events that I kept mentioning, were written on index cards, also color-coded, for easier access.\n\nI no longer complete my research before I start writing. As a fellow writer friend said to me, feeling like you have to do all of your research before you start writing slows down your process to the point where your story doesnâ€™t get written. These days I do some preliminary research by reading generally around my topic, perhaps taking a few notes, just enough to keep things clear in my head, and then I begin the prewriting process. Usually, through the process of brainstorming, prewriting, and drafting my story, I recognize what specific bits of historical information Iâ€™ll need and then Iâ€™ll search for those bits. Thatâ€™s when my note taking begins in earnest. I create digital folders to organize my notes, citations, and annotations, and I still keep categories of information together (food, clothing, political climate, and so on).\n\nOne trick I learned from a history class I took years ago is to think about the historical world Iâ€™m creating through the acronym GRAPES.\n\nGeographyâ€”How does the climate and landscape affect the people who live there?\n\nReligionâ€”How does the societyâ€™s belief system and traditions affect the people who live there?\n\nAchievementsâ€”What are the achievements of this societyâ€”good and bad?\n\nPoliticsâ€”What is the power structure in this society?\n\nEconomicsâ€”How are goods and resources used in this society?\n\nSocial Structureâ€”How does this society organize people into classes? Who ends up in which class and why?\n\nI love to travel to the place Iâ€™m writing about as well. I always get a lot of good ideas for my story from my travels. As I work to weave the information I learned into my story, one thing I keep in mind is that I want to carry my readers into my world by touching their senses. What do readers see, hear, taste, touch, and smell? Often itâ€™s the smaller details, what people wore, what they ate, the houses they lived in, that brings historical fiction alive since these are details we can relate to, even if what we eat and drink and where we live is different today.\n\nSome dependable online research sources Iâ€™ve used over the years are Project Gutenberg, the Library of Congress, the Victorian Web, V&A, and JSTOR. The History Quill has a list of 50+ research sites for writers of historical fiction. I also love to go to the library to see what books I can find, and Iâ€™ve found that librarians are more than happy to help if I canâ€™t find what Iâ€™m looking for.\n\nI love learning about history, so researching historical fiction is actually fun for me.\n\nThank you so much for sharing your post with us. Research can indeed be a rabbit hole from which you canâ€™t return:)\n\nHereâ€™s the blurb;\n\nHow would you deal with the madness of the Salem witch hunts?\n\nIn 1690, James Wentworth arrives in Salem in the Massachusetts Bay Colony with his father, John, hoping to continue the success of Johnâ€™s mercantile business. While in Salem, James falls in love with Elizabeth Jones, a farmerâ€™s daughter. Though they are virtually strangers when they marry, the love between James and Elizabeth grows quickly into a passion that will transcend time.\n\nBut something evil lurks down Salem way. Soon many in Salem, town and village, are accused of practicing witchcraft and sending their shapes to harm others. Despite the madness surrounding them, James and Elizabeth are determined to continue the peaceful, loving life they have created together. Will their love for one another carry them through the most difficult challenge of all?\n\nBuy Links:\n\nDown Salem Way:\n\nHer Dear and Loving Husband:\n\nHer Loving Husbandâ€™s Curse:\n\nHer Loving Husbandâ€™s Return:\n\nAmazon UK: Amazon US: Amazon CA: Amazon AU:\n\nBarnes and Noble: Kobo: iBooks:\n\nMeet the Author\n\nMeredith Allard is the author of the bestselling paranormal historical Loving Husband Trilogy.
