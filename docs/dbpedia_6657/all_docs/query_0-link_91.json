        "text": "Far too little-known are the Spanish corsarios of the Caribbean â the Spanish privateers and pirates who attacked the English, French, and Dutch in the service of Spain and of their own material interests! â yet the exploits of some deserve a book, an honest film documentary, or even a Hollywood film. Iâve already described the exploits of Italian corsario-in-Spanish-service Mateo GuarÃ­n, but those of the Corsican brothers Juan and Blas Miguel [It. Giovanni and Biagio Michele] are equally epic, and the final fatal exploit of Blas Miguel was in the service of a blood vendetta.\n\nThe tale begins with Juan Miguel. He arrived in Havana in late 1681 or early 1682 with a patente de corso â a privateering commission â dated 15 October 1681, from Juan de Arechaga, the governor of Yucatan, Mexico, to cruise along the coasts of Yucatan, Cozumel, and Tabasco for smugglers and pirates. Cuban waters were clearly beyond his commissionâs authority, but Juan Miguel had a purpose in mind: to cruise new waters for greater plunder.\n\nItâs entirely possible that Miguel had turned to el Corso in reprisal or revenge for attacks by pirates and consequent lost cargoes, just as some English merchant captains had turned to buccaneering after attacks by Spanish corsarios: he may be the Juan Miguel who, along with Captain Francisco de Ojeda, was plundered by English buccaneers in 1679 while sailing from Veracruz to Portobello. However, Juan Miguel was a common name, therefore this is speculation.\n\nAs a corsario Juan Miguel commanded an armed piragua, which often was nothing more than a very large dugout canoe, the largest of which could carry 125 men, with one or two masts and a short bowsprit, and armed with no more than two, or perhaps a few, wrought iron swivel guns known as patereroes (Sp. pedreros) on the gunwales. He was in the company of as many as two other corsario captains. One of them, Antonio GÃ³mez, would soon command a small frigate captured in the bay of Santa LucÃ­a, Cuba, and in 1683 would die in action against a smuggling sloop manned entirely or mostly so by buccaneers on hiatus from buccaneering, at Santiago de Trinidad, Cuba, a common location for smuggling and for fights between buccaneering smugglers and Spanish corsarios. The other captain was Juan CaÃ±edo, although he may have associated with Miguel in Cuba instead.\n\nJuan Miguel, with a new commission from Cuban authorities, soon put to sea again and captured smuggling canoes along the coasts of Honduras and Cuba. Along the latter coast he also captured an English bark smuggling logwood, and burned two other captured vessels because he lacked enough men for prize crews. Soon afterward, companion captain Juan CaÃ±edo captured the English buccaneer John Spring (probably Captain Springer who gave his name to Springerâs Key and fought in the South Sea alongside Captain Bartholomew Sharp and others), among whose crimes was the decapitation of a priest in Guaurabo (Guayabon, modern Guayabo?), Cuba. Miguelâs next prize was a smuggling sloop, probably English, with 58 slaves and 46 boxes of sugar aboard.\n\nUnfortunately, we know nothing more of Juan Miguel after this except that he died âin battle against the French from Petit Goave.â In other words, he was killed in action at the hands of French flibustiers. This has led some scholars to suggest that he was killed at the hands of Laurens de Graff, and from there they have leapt to the conclusion that he (as Miguel Curro) was captain of one of the several vessels of the Armada de VizcaÃ­nos and was killed during a battle between the fleet and de Graff.\n\nThis Armada of Biscay, or informally, Basque Armada, referred to as La Armada de Nuestra SeÃ±ora del Rosario by its admiral who would die of wounds received while attacking an English ship in an attempt to make off with its French prize, was a private pirate-hunting flotilla (three fragatas of thirty, thirteen, and twelve guns respectively, and one âbarco de remosâ or oared vessel) dispatched, largely unsuccessfully it turned out, to make up for perceived deficiencies in the Armada de Barlovento (Windward Fleet) of the Spanish navy. Given the privae armadaâs apparent preference for trade over pirate hunting (pirate hunting has seldom been profitable), its failures are unsurprising.\n\nHowever, neither Juanâs name nor his brotherâs is listed among the those of the Armada captains, and it is highly unlikely that a local Mexican corsario commanded one of the ships of an armada financed and outfitted by the CompaÃ±Ã­a Guipuzcoana in Guipuzcoa (Gipuzkoa), Spain. Other scholars, looking more carefully at the evidence, consider it likely that Juan Miguel was killed during the sack of Campeche, Mexico in 1685 by buccaneers under the command of Laurens de Graff and Michel, sieur de Grammont, having returned to Yucatan after his cruises in Cuban waters.\n\nIn any case, Juanâs death triggered a vendetta: his brother Blas would avenge him by striking not at the homes and plantations of the buccaneer leaders, as Mateo GuarÃ­n had done, but at Petit Goave, the flibustier home port on French Hispaniola that had replaced Tortuga more than a decade prior. He would strike at the very heart of la flibuste and avenge not only his brother but all those who had died at the hands of the bloody French buccaneers.\n\nBlas Miguel sought and was presented with a patente de corso âcontralos enemigos piratasâ¦y aquellos contrabentoresâ (against enemy pirates and any smugglers) dated February 26, 1687 by acting governor Don Andres de Munibe, âcastellano del castillo del morro y Governador delas Armas,â in Havana. A copy of the commission still exists. Miguel also claimed to have had a commission from the âViceroy.â However, no such commission exists in the archives, and there were only two Viceroys: New Spain and Peru. He probably meant that his commission from Munibe was issued under the aegis of the Viceroy.\n\nMiguelâs privateering commission, its authority based on the Ordenza de Corso of 1674, which authorized Spanish privateering in the Americas, and on the Real CÃ©dula of 1680 which authorized Cuban governors to take additional action to protect Cuban shores, also names Miguelâs vessel: a piragua called El Cachimbo, a Native American word meaning tobacco pipe. It may be the same Cachimbo commanded by Capitan Juan Nicolao who in late 1686 captured an English turtling sloop owned by Arthur Burham of Jamaica. In early 1689 Nicolao captured three more English turtling sloops. If the two vessels are the same, we assume that Miguel hired it, or it was purchased by his various investors.\n\nGiven that French records describe the vessel both as a pirogue and as a demi-galÃ¨re (half-galley), it is likely that was in fact the latter, known in Spanish as both a galera and a bergantin (a term that could mean two different vessels, here it is not to be confused with the French brigantin or English brig or brigantine). Although the piragua/pirogue/periager was specifically a large dugout canoe with oars and sails, the terms were also often used generally to indicate any large undecked (but for very small decks at the bow and stern) vessels that had both oars and sails, including half-galleys and barcos luengos (not to be confused with barques-longues â yes, the names of vessel types varied according to region, nationality, the passage of time, and confusion by lubbers who often used inaccurate terms). For more details on the half-galley, see the illustrations below and also the post on Mateo GuerÃ­n.\n\nAt what point Miguel chose Petit Goave as his target is unknown. Over several months he recruited eighty-three men (one source claims eighty-four), including himself, and added a second vessel as a consort, which would serve as a backup in case he lost the Cachimbo, as well as to ferry some of the corsarios and, hopefully, some of the plunder on the return voyage. Spanish records describe it as a balandra, which was a small coastal vessel, often a sloop (a single-masted, fore-and-aft-rigged vessel) but not necessarily one. French records describe it both as a bateau (boat) and as a brigantin, a small two-masted vessel square-rigged on the foremast and fore-and-aft-rigged on the main. Given that it was described as both, it was probably a very small brigantin. Mateo GuerÃ­n, that famous Italian corsario in Cuban service, loaned Blas Miguel the money for the brigantin.\n\nWe know the names of eleven of his officers and crew. Blas Miguel (in French records, variously Bras Miguel, Brasse Miqael, Blas Michel, Blas Michelet), about forty years old, a native of Corsica, commanded the expedition, and said he came to âpillage, steal, and burn the Quarter [of Petit Goave].â Santos de Acosta was his second-in-command. Lieutenant Diego Ruiz and Soriano Pardo, the latter from Santiago, were also officers of unspecified duties. Teniente de Guerra â âLieutenant of War,â probably a militia officer â Juan Quijano was also aboard, likewise of unspecified duty.\n\nPasqual Juan (in French records Pasqual Ouan â phonetic French for Juan â therefore possibly Juan Pasqual; also Pasqual Onan, Pascoualles Onan [likely transcription errors], Pascoualle Ouan, Pascual Ouan),* a Native American from Campeche, Mexico, about twenty years old, said he came to âdestroy and pillage [Petit Goave] entirely, to kill and massacre all the whites [pour tuer et massacrer tous les blancs], and take away the women.â He was considered by the French to be one of the chiefs (Chefs) and principal authors of the expedition, although this was probably untrue. More on this later.\n\nLouis MartÃ­n, twenty years old, a native of Santiago de Cuba, said he came to âsearch for life [chercher la vie â to make a living?] and had heard the Oidor [a judge of the Audiencia] and others say to give no quarter to anyone and to plunder the Quarter entirely.â Juan de Piqueras (âPiquerayâ in French records), a mulatto from Cartagena de Indias, thirty-six years old, came for the same reason as his companions.\n\nJuan Antonio Sanete, a mulatto, thirty-four years old, likewise a native of Cartagena de Indias, said he came ir corsario (âpour fair la course,â to go privateering). Juan Eusebe Servan, twenty-nine years old, a native of Havana who lived at Trinidad de Cuba, likewise came for privateering. Juan Miguel, (no known relation to Blas Miguel), a pardo (typically taken to mean a person in Spanish America of mixed white, black, and Native American ancestry), was also a member of the crew.\n\nAccording to French records, the crew was multi-national, in equal parts âwhites, mulattoes, Native Americans, and Blacks.â The Native Americans among the crew â âIndesâ in French records â were likely both Native Americans and mestizos. Spanish corsario crews in the Americas are typically described as broadly of mixed race and ethnicity in accounts of the period.\n\nAdditionally, it was common to have a few Italians, Corsicans, and Sardinians among the crew, along with a few âLevanters,â also known as âGreeks,â as well. Levanters hailed from the Eastern Mediterranean, the Greek Islands in particular. Blas Miguel is described in his commission not only as Corsican, but also as a pardo, perhaps due to mixed Italian and North African ancestry. English accounts of the era typically note this various multi-ethic composition of Spanish privateer, pirate, and guarda-costa crews (often such crews were all three), in blatantly racist language.\n\nIn June 1687 Blas Miguel set sail from Casildo, two leagues east of Trinidad de Cuba. At the RÃ­o Zaza they came across two registro ships, one from Cartagena de Indias and one from Puerto Bello, and may have recruited some seamen from them, including Piqueras and Sanete. At Santiago de Cuba the expedition remained for twenty days recruiting, bringing the number to a final eighty-three. Here part of the crew had a change of heart and deserted ashore, including Luis MartÃ­n. But the local judge ordered them all to return aboard, or face arrest and two hundred âstrokes of the cane.â The corsarios put to sea, sailed to Baracoa, and remained there a month, making final preparations.\n\nIn early August the punitive and plundering expedition set sail. En route near Petit Goave they captured two canoes with four persons aboard each, one of which held a Frenchman named Saint-Anthoine from nearby LÃ©ogÃ¢ne whom they forced to serve as a guide. No flibustier vessels were in port as the Spanish corsarios came near Petit Goave on August 10, 1687. Blas Miguel may have had advance intelligence, or knew the general patterns of the buccaneers of Petit Goave, or sent a canoe ahead in advance, or was advised of this by Saint Anthoine. Or even by all of these methods.\n\nLeaving the brigantin to stand off from shore, Blas Miguel, with sixty men divided into four companies to go ashore, and a small sailing crew to remain aboard, approached Petit Goave at dawn. He had originally intended to land at midnight, but Saint-Anthoine cleverly dissuaded him, by telling Miguel they could capture the Quarter âwithout the loss of a hairâ at dawn, but at midnight would be in danger of killing each other in the dark. Blas Miguel agreed.\n\nAt the fortalice that served more as a corps du garde than as a harbor defense at Petit Goave, only three or four men were on duty. Their officer, a veteran former buccaneer captain named Vigneron who had commanded the four-gun barque Louise and had sailed with Laurens de Graff, Jean Rose, La Garde, and other famous flibustiers. As the Cachimbo began putting men ashore, Vigneron challenged it. âDâou estoit le canot? [âWhence the canoe?â aka âWhere do you come from?]â he shouted.\n\nSaint-Anthoine replied, âSaint Anthoine qui vient de LÃ©ogane. [Saint Anthony who comes from LÃ©ogane.â Again Vigneron demanded, âDâou estoit le canot?â This time Saint Anthoine responded aggressively and repeatedly: âSaint-Anthoine aux armes! [Saint Anthony, to arms!]â We imagine the prisoner-guide was immediately killed by his captors for warning the French.\n\nVigneron, and probably his men too, fled the fort, for they were too few to hold it, and ran through the town shouting, âAux armes!â The four corsario companies surged ashore. Two of them, including Blas Miguel, occupied the fort while the other two, soon guided by former Spanish slaves and mulattas captured from Spanish territory, headed east toward the several rich Maisons. The attackers knew that any French armed assistance could come only from Acul across the bay; LÃ©ogane was two days away.\n\nThe exact armament of the corsarios is unknown. Only two weapons are mentioned incidentally in French records: the machete and bayonet. However, the primary weapon would have been a long firearm. The standard military weapons of Spanish infantry, militia included, at the time, were the mosquete and arcabus, both matchlocks, which were not the ideal firearms for raids. Even so, it is likely that some raiders were armed with the arcabus, which was smaller in caliber than the mosquete and did not require a rest.\n\nOther raiders were probably armed with the escopeta, a light flintlock (usually a Miquelet lock) musket commonly used for hunting and a much better long arm for raiding. (Note: the escopeta was not a âshotgun,â and therefore, by flawed reasoning, a blunderbuss, pirate reenactors and Hollywood script writers unreasonably enamored with the blunderbuss notwithstanding. The definition of the escopeta as a shotgun came later, as cartridge arms with rifling were introduced, and smoothbore muzzleloaders began to be used as shotguns, a purpose to which they were well-suited.) Some corsarios were likely armed with carabinas (carbines): short-barreled flintlock muskets used by cavalry and dragoons, including those of Spanish regulars and militia in the Americas.\n\nSome corsarios may have also been armed with pistols; the 1674 Ordenza de Corso permitted this, although likely some would have been armed with them without the legal authorization. All or nearly all would have been armed with a machete or cutlass (alfanje in Spanish, also often sable). The term machete is noted twice in French records, and may have meant machete, a common tool and weapon, or more generally to indicate a short cutting sword, whether cutlass or machete.\n\nCorsarios who considered themselves hidalgos (gentlemen), likely many of them, may have been armed with cup-hilt rapiers and parrying daggers instead of cutlasses, as in the illustration at the head of this post. At least one bayonet is noted, probably fixed in a musket barrel. It may have been a hunting bayonet rather than the military bayonet now becoming quite common, and may have been carried by many corsarios. Most attackers were probably armed with some form of knife: a bayonet, dagger, or other fixed blade, or a large folding knife of a form common to Spaniards.\n\nThe French defenders were of two sorts: flibustiers and former flibustiers who would have been armed with the famous long-barreled fusil boucanier, a pistol or two, and a cutlass (Fr. coutelas, sabre), and habitans in the militia who were by this time typically armed with the fusil boucanier and a bayonet or cutlass, or with both edged weapons. Some, officers particularly, may have been armed with pistols as well.\n\nAs the corsarios attacked, one company assaulted the home of Procureur GÃ©nÃ©ral du Conseil SupÃ©rieur [PrÃ©sident in some accounts] et Capitaine de Milice du Quartier du Petit Goave, Jean Drageon-Dupuy (also Dupuis), to the east. The militia captain, just awakened, attempted to fire on four or five attackers, we imagine with a fusil boucanier â loaded with a ball and seven or eight swan shot, as buccaneers often did, it was a superior close quarters firearm (far superior, for example, to the blunderbuss). But his weapon missed fire, and one of his attackers cut off his head with a machete.\n\nWhen the attackers came upon his pregnant wife, she pleaded for her husbandâs life, then, seeing him dead, she pleaded for good quarter for herself. And for a short time, quarter was granted to her while the corsarios pillaged. In the house they murdered a young boy with twenty-eight cutlass blows, then returned and bayoneted Drageon-Dupuyâs wife, killing her and her unborn child in spite of the grant of quarter.\n\nMeanwhile, an officer of the sieur Novays arrived on scene, and with his men killed three corsarios of a dozen or so who had ranged through the streets and had killed a resident. The officer and his men also soon put to flight all those who had attacked the house; the corsarios fled with only their arms.\n\nCommanded by Blas Miguelâs lieutenant â probably Santos de Acosta â the two companies headed toward two or three other rich Maisons, plundering them of valuables, arms, and powder, and breaking their furniture and furnishings. But within an hour to an hour and a half, depending on the witnessâs account, a French militia force of two dozen or so, both cavalry and infantry, arrived and counter-attacked, killing Miguelâs lieutenant and two other corsarios, and forced the rest to retreat under fire to the fort.\n\nEach side fired furiously at the other; three French militiamen were killed, and four more, including an officer, were wounded. The French militia also fired on the half-galley and brigantin, forcing them to stand off from near the shore. Meanwhile, five corsarios, with what plunder they might have carried in their pockets and nine or ten Spanish mulatta women, who may have been free or slaves when originally captured by the French, slipped into the corsario boat and escaped to the half-galley.\n\nDuring the firefight, the French wounded many corsarios and killed seventeen. (The number is probably the total killed during entire day. If this number is correct, there were sixty-four corsarios ashore, suggesting companies of fifteen plus one officer each.)\n\nA former flibustier named Brasse slipped into the water during the battle and with only a machete or cutlass captured the half-galleyâs canoe and the prisoner in it (or took its coxswain prisoner; the account is not entirely clear). Soon, the corsarios realized they had no way out. Blas Miguel sent a âfemme de mauvaise vieâ â a âfallen woman,â a prostitute â with a letter stating that the corsarios would give back their plunder if the French permitted them to depart.\n\nInstead, the French redoubled their fire and soon Blas Miguel and his men surrendered. The official record states that forty-seven surrendered and were imprisoned in âcachotsâ â dungeons â but the term is probably figurative, indicating warehouses and other buildings quickly converted for use as jails.\n\nThe following day a Conseil de Guerre (a Council of War) composed of fourteen militia officers was convened. The council interrogated six of the corsario prisoners, using a militia cornet of horse, the sieur Jean Duquesnot, to translate. Blas Miguel claimed to have had two commissions but had left them in his piragua. We know he had one patente de corso. It was common practice to carry a copy ashore, but he had not. Having no commission at hand, he was considered to be a pirate.\n\nJustice was swift. Forty-two corsarios, or âforbansâ â pirates â as the French referred to them, were sentenced to be âhanged and strangled until deathâ the following day for âplundering, burning houses, and raping and massacring even women.â\n\nBlas Miguel and Pasqual Juan were sentenced to be broken on the wheel the day after, for their being the chiefs and principal authors of the raid. Two, a young boy and a Black slave, were spared because they had been forced aboard the punitive plundering expedition. This makes forty-six, not forty-seven; we may assume one corsario had died of his wounds in the interim.\n\nThe sentencing leaves us with an obvious question, at least once the evidence is examined closely. Why was Pasqual Juan sentenced to be broken on the wheel? French records state that this was because he was one of the âchiefsâ and âprincipal authorsâ of the raid. But was he? Spanish records do not record his name among those of the officers. He was a very young man, a Native American, and a native of Campeche, Mexico, a city that had been brutally sacked by French buccaneers two years before.\n\nAnd he was also an angry young man who said he came, among other reasons, to kill and massacre all the whites in Petit Goave. He was the only interrogated prisoner to claim this. Very likely he was neither an officer nor an author of the raid. Instead, he was almost certainly broken on the wheel for his testimony that he came to kill white people. To the colonial mind, any form of rebellion against the European hierarchy must be violently, horribly suppressed.\n\nSuch racial animosity toward white foreigners is unsurprising. As buccaneers they had not only raided, plundered, tortured, raped, and burned Spanish towns, but also often captured free men, women, and children of color and sold them as slaves. And alongside this lay the enormity of the commercial enslavement of Africans, and often of Native Americans as well, throughout the Americas.\n\nSlavery touched everything. But no faction or people in the Americas had entirely clean hands, although it is surely accurate to say that European hands were the dirtiest. Even so, it can sometimes be difficult to draw a distinct line between European nations in the Americas and the Native American and African cultures they had begun to blend with. Even during the Colonial Era the Americas would never be a mirror-image of Europe.\n\nThe seeds of the early nineteenth century Caribbean and Latin American Wars of Independence were already sown, although Spain would manage to hold onto Cuba until the Spanish American War with the United States.\n\nOn August 11, 1687, forty-two corsarios were hanged. Maps of Petit Goave show only a single small gallows at the shore. If it alone were used the hangings would have taken all day. Perhaps other gallows were erected, or perhaps Governor Hender Molesworth was correct when he wrote that âAbout a hundred Spaniards landed lately at Petit Guavos in the night, and, the place being thinly inhabited, made themselves masters of the castle, but were all put to the sword by the French, except some who were reserved to be hanged, and the captain, whom they racked to death for having no commission.â Perhaps the sentence of death by hanging was figurative and the French simply put some to death by firearm and sword and hanged the rest.\n\nOn the following day, August 12, 1687, Blas Miguel and Pasqual Juan were broken alive on the wheel. Father Jean-Baptiste Labat, that eyewitness chronicler of all things Caribbean in the late 17th and early 18th centuries, left us with a description of the horrible punishment, often known as rouer in French. It is truly a death by torture: the executioner used a hammer, heavy wooden staff, or perhaps even an âepÃ©e dans un bÃ¢tonâ or âstick-swordâ (see Louis de Gaya, 1678) to break the bones of the condemned who was bound with his arms and legs outstretched, often to a wheel although this was not mandatory. In the West Indies a cross was sometimes used, for example. In either case the wheel or cross was typically mounted on a platform for better view and ease of execution of sentence.\n\nLabat described the condemned mounting the scaffold, kneeling, praying, then undressing and stretching out upon a cross. With a hammer the executioner then broke each of the long bones in the condemnedâs arms and legs several times. If the condemned was fortunate, a priest might cover his face with a handkerchief during the excruciating process. The executioner ended the agony â if the condemned were not already dead from the trauma â by strangling him with a rope, first permitting a priest to ask the condemned for, and perhaps receive, a last act of contrition. We imagine that strangling was not always used, and a final blow was made instead.\n\nThus ended the vendetta of Blas Miguel to avenge his brotherâs death at the hands of the French at Petit Goave. At least Laurens de Graff was not present to laugh in Blas Miguelâs face as he went to die.\n\nBut soon enough the Spanish would take a double measure of revenge, as would the soul of Blas Miguel, a few years later during King Williamâs War. In 1690 a force of 2,600 Spaniards attacked Saint-Domingue. At the plain of Limonade they faced the French under Governor Jean-Paul Tarin de Cussy. At first, the powerful Spanish force withered under accurate fire of French buccaneers who had demanded to fight on the plain, but a sudden charge by lanceros â typically men of color afoot, armed with lances â who had lain hidden nearby broke the French line. De Cussy and his lieutenant, Franquenay, stood their ground and died upon it. The invading Spanish force plundered the French capital Cap FranÃ§ois, murdered all the men they found, raped women, and carried away women, children, and slaves, in part in retribution for decades of bloody, brutal buccaneer raids.\n\nIn 1695, during a during a joint English-Spanish raid, a double measure of revenge against Laurens de Graff was had: the former buccaneer was roundly criticized and shamed, whether deservedly or not, for his lackluster defense against and retreat from the Spanish attack, so much so that he was called to France to face charges. Worse, at least we hope it was to him, his wife Anne and his children were captured. But once more Petit Goave was not attacked, and de Graff was no fool and so ignored the royal command.\n\nA measure of revenge against Petit Goave did come in 1697 at the hands of the English Navy. Arriving after chasing and losing the quasi-naval privateering fleet of the baron de Pointis which had just sacked Cartagena de Indias, Rear Admiral Mees was tasked by Admiral Nevill to destroy Petit Goave, now a nest of lawful flibustier privateers, many of whom had just returned from Cartagena de Indias. He organized a detachment of 897 men, placing almost two thirds of them in boats. Launching some 16 or 17 leagues from Petit Goave, Mees led four hundred men ashore at 3:30 AM one mile east of the town.\n\nThey quickly captured the fort, which had only one cannon mounted, and six of the guard, the rest escaping. Quickly the English captured the remaining small nearby batteries of cannon while most of the inhabitants fled. Those who did not flee were captured and placed in the fort under guard. Soon, though, English sailors started to do what they were well-known to do ashore: get drunk and start plundering, for many houses were rich with plunder and shops rich with goods. After an hour or two, Mees was forced to set fire to the town, fearing his men in their drunken state might not stand against a counter-attack.\n\nAs the town burned, and houses exploded due to the powder stored within them, the French were able to make only small counter-attacks from hedges and trenches, many armed with swivel guns. The English captured two French colors, killed an Ensign and another officer, wounded an officer on horseback, and killed and wounded an unknown number more while taking casualties of thirty killed and thirty more wounded of their own. One English volunteer officer with eight men forced thirty French to retreat from a trench, and killed their officer. In the end, the attack amounted to little more than a mere punitive raid.\n\nAfterward, the spirit of Blas Miguel must surely have wondered what its former incarnation might have done with four hundred veteran professional fighting men instead of a mere eighty-three various volunteers.\n\nThe description of the raid has been drawn largely from the following:\n\nEl Corso en Cuba Siglo XVII by CÃ©sar GarcÃ­a del Pino (Havana: Editorial de Ciencias Sociales, 2001);\n\nLa Defensa de la Isla de Cuba en la Segunda Mitad del Siglo XVII by Francisco Castillo MelÃ©ndez (Seville: DiputaciÃ³n Provincial, Sevilla, 1986);\n\nâAudition des Espanols qui sont mis a terre au Petit Goave prisonniers au fort de dit lieu,â ANOM, C9/1/1;\n\nâLettre et mÃ©moire de Cussy au marquis de Seignelay, Port-Paix, 27 August 1687,â ANOM/C9A/1;\n\nâJugement du Conseil de Guerre, Petit-Goave, 11 August 1687,â reprinted in Loix et constitutions des colonies franÃ§oises de lâAmÃ©rique sous le Vent by Louis-Ãlie Moreau de Saint-MÃ©ry;\n\nâLieutenant Governor Molesworth to William Blathwayt,â August 8, 1685 (Old Style), Calendar of State Papers, Colonial, America and West Indies, 1685-1688.\n\nThe description of the English raid on Petit Goave has been drawn from âAn account of the Burning of Petit Guavas the 28th June 1694â¦,â published in The Sergison Papers, 1950.\n\n* Curiously, the French translator, or the transcriptionist/clerk, wrote âJeanâ for âJuanâ in most cases, did not do so in the case of Pasqual Juan, but wrote âOuanâ instead.

If so, I have been unable to trace it.\n\nCopyright Benerson Little 2023-2024. First posted on June 14, 2023. Last updated March 25, 2024.\n\nModern histories of so-called Golden Age pirates â those circa 1655 to 1730 â are often filled with images of pirate ships, many of which are implied to be accurate representations. In fact, there are few eyewitness images of actual buccaneer and pirate ships of this era â perhaps no more than five!\n\nMost period images of buccaneer and pirate ships, not mention of pirate prey and pirate hunters, were drawn not by eyewitnesses in the Caribbean or in other places pirates roved but in England and Europe by the professional illustrators of various editions of books on buccaneers and pirates. These artists never saw the vessels they drew, probably had little if any input from eyewitnesses who had seen them, and were often clearly inept when it came to accurate representation (Hollywood also has always often had this problem and still does).\n\nEven when the illustrator had a good description, the result often hit far from the mark, as weâll see below. There were no professional artists such as the Willem van de Velde father and son, or Pierre Puget, or any of a number of maritime painters of the era to paint the Caribbean and its people, landscapes, and vessels. This is historyâs loss.\n\nModern scholarly reconstructions in the form of illustration or model â Whydah, Queen Anneâs Revenge, &c â are based on limited eyewitness accounts and scarce records of the actual ships, with reference to hopefully similar ships found in period maritime paintings, drawings, and construction records. At best they are intelligently conjectural. But conjectural they are, even if they are the best we might ever do.\n\nNonetheless, there exist eyewitness illustrations of at least five Golden Age sea roving vessels we can for the most part put names, captains, and adventures to. In other words, they are illustrations of real buccaneer or pirate vessels made by illustrators and painters who actually saw them or were provided a high degree of detail by eyewitnesses. Additionally, there is an illustration of two others that is almost certainly based on eyewitness descriptions taken firsthand by the illustrator.\n\nThe first two are Spanish-built pirate/privateer half-galleys, one for certain, the other almost certain. The third and fourth are of a captured Spanish merchantman soon to be converted by flibustiers to piracy, and its captor. The fifth is a pirate which had recently plundered on the Guinea coast. The sixth and seventh are pirates, one English, one French, one of whom was destroyed by a pair of English men-of-war.\n\nFurther, we have illustrations of the two most famous Spanish pirate hunting ships â even if unsuccessful more often than successful â along with an excellent, highly detailed, quite accurate drawing of the HMS Drake, a sixth rate used for pirate hunting in the 1680s Caribbean, and the HMS Bonetta, which was dispatched against a pirate but did not engage it â plus a reasonable image each of the pirate hunters HMS Drake and HMS Falcon. At another time weâll look at a painting of what may be the most famous of all pirate prey of the era; Iâve more research to do before I commit my argument to print.\n\nWeâll take a look at all nine, with accompanying swashbuckling history in depth. As with the eyewitness images of buccaneers and boucaniers I found in the French National Library, I found several, but not all, of these eyewitness images of vessels likewise largely unnoted and unnoticed.\n\nA Spanish Half-Galley (Galeota) Commanded by Cuban-Italian Corsario Mateo GuarÃ­n, 1685\n\nCommissioned by the governor of Cuba, FernÃ¡ndez de CÃ³rdoba, in 1683 to make reprisals against English and French pirates and smugglers. In January 1684, GuarÃ­n led a raid on Siguatey (Cigateo, aka Eleuthera) and New Providence in the Bahamas.\n\nMateo GuarÃ­n (sometimes MarÃ­n) was an Italian privateer â a corsario â from Venetia (the surrounding region of Venice, Italy) in Spanish service. In Italian his name was Matteo Guarino. It was not unusual to find Italian adventurers in Spanish service in the Caribbean; another will be discussed in another post soon.\n\nAn English account of the raid: âAt the beginning of January about two hundred of their choicest men were fitted out from Havana, well armed, in two barco-luengos, the one of forty, the other of thirty oars. They went to a-small uninhabited island called St. Andrews, where they took an English sloop which was there for cutting timber. They made the three men in her their pilots, and came to the back of Providence on 18th January and waited through the night. At daybreak they landed 120 of their men at the town, while fifty assailed the shippingâsix vesselsâin the harbour. The people in the town being surprised fled from it to the woods, those in the ships also deserted them and fled on board a New England vessel of ten guns. This and one more ship stood out to sea; the rest were all pillaged and three men murdered.\n\nâThe Spaniards killed no one in the town, but kept it till four oâclock in the afternoon, in which time they took away all the wrought and unwrought plate that they could find, a quantity of English dry-goods, and such provisions as they wanted, and loaded their booty, valued by the English at 14.000l., in a pink that they took in the harbour. While the Spaniards were in possession of the town, fourteen Englishmen got together and drove all the Spaniards before them. They would have driven them from the town and retaken the plunder if they had had powder and ball enough, and if the inhabitants had known of a rallying point, and had found but fifty firearms they might have saved all. All might also have been saved by the ship of ten guns if she had but stayed. But three men were killed, but many were carried off prisoners by the Spaniards, as suspected of being pirates.â There was a much more brutal raid against New Providence later in 1684; it is unknown if GuarÃ­n participated.\n\nIn 1684 GuarÃ­n was surprised by that famous Dutch flibustier-in-French-service, Laurens de Graff, at the large Isle of Pines (Isla de Pinos, today Isla de Juventud) off the southern coast of Cuba, but escaped the more heavily-armed and -manned buccaneer.\n\nDe Graff was the greatest of buccaneers in the 1680s. In fact, certain aspects of Rafael Sabatiniâs famous character Captain Blood are based on him. Caribbean Spaniards had great enmity toward the Dutch buccaneer not only because he was so successful, but because he had deserted Spanish service as a gunner of the Armada de Barlovento and later co-led the brutal sacks of Veracruz and Campeche. De Graff had long ranged and raided along the Cuban coast, and gathered intelligence there as well, in particular from a source named [Juan?] Montiel who provided detailed information on ship movements from Havana, doubtless in return for trade goods or money.\n\nThis desperate desire for vengeance against buccaneers and against de Graff in particular ranged across the Spanish Main, but would usually turn out poorly for all the Spanish pirate hunters sent against de Graff, including CapitÃ¡n GuarÃ­n who made the bold personal decision to become de Graffâs principal nemesis.\n\nIn October 1684 GuarÃ­n attacked the HMS Bonneta (Bonito in colonial records; see the section on Bannister below for an image and more information) of no more than four guns along the south coast of Cuba as it was sailing to Santiago de Trinidad, Cuba to demand the return of captured English seamen from a sloop belonging to Derick Cornelison. The small English man-of-war (see also Bannister below) had sent a boat ashore for water, per treaty. GuarÃ­n captured the boat and its eight-man crew, stole the English jack it had flown for protection, and hoisted it aboard a pirate-hunting piragua.\n\nIn Captain Stanleyâs words: âI at once got up sail, but had no sooner done so than I saw the galley and a periago coming under sail and oars, the galley flying the Spanish flag with a red ensign and the periago the Kingâs jack, which he had taken in my boat. I fired at the galley when she came within range, and she at me, and we were engaged from nine to eleven, when they got into the creek where there was not water for me to follow them.â The English captain slipped away before more galleys and piraguas might arrive: there were two of the former and seven of the latter in Santiago de Trinidad. Afterward he provided protection to nearby English turtling sloops nearby, and soon afterward rescued four English turtling sloops from the French flibustier Captain BrÃ©ha who was robbing them of provisions.\n\nIn early 1685, commanding a half-galley, known in Spanish as a galeota, GuarÃ­n raided Nipe on the island of Hispaniola, not far from the flibustier haven of Petit Goave. The corsario and his crew flew the white flag of France for deception, but also apparently fought under it â a violation of the laws of war, in addition to any charges of piracy. GuarÃ­n and his crew carried away forty slaves, soon declared in Baracoa and Puerto Principe, Cuba, as good plunder worth approximately 8,800 pesos de ocho reals (pieces-of-eight). The corsarios probably carried away little other plunder, given the small agricultural nature of the settlement.\n\nAn official French account notes that two demi-galÃ¨res (half-galleys, galeotas) attacked Nipe for a second time later that year, but that their original intended target was the plantation belonging to Governor de PouanÃ§ay via an extortion attempt at ransom. The attackers changed their minds when their threat was rebuffed. The second attack on Nipe failed due to the town becoming alarmed before the raid began. It is unknown whether this second attack was led by GuarÃ­n.\n\nBy good fortune, French engineer Pierre de Cornuau had been sent to French Hispaniola to survey and draw charts of French ports. His chart of Nipe, drawn the same year as GuarÃ­nâs raid, shows the Spanish half-galley (see the image above). It is quite typical of the form (more on this below), and Cornuau, who probably did not see the half-galley himself, certainly had it described to him by eyewitnesses.\n\nAs will be seen in the next section, Cornuauâs simple drawing is a very accurate rendering of these vessels as used by the Spanish in the Caribbean. It has a single carriage gun (cannon) mounted at the bow, a pair of gallows for sweeps (oars) amidships, two masts and two furled lateen sails, and a flagstaff at the stern for the ensign. Missing in the drawing, but probably mounted on the actual vessel, are a handful of swivel guns (small cannon mounted on yokes), probably of the chamber-loaded sort known as patereroes in English. âThe galleys are what are called half-galleys in the straits, and carry eighty to a hundred and twenty men; the periagos carry from fifty to seventy,â wrote Lieutenant-Governor Hender Molesworth. One account of GuarÃ­nâs half-galley arms it with âsixty-five men, one âCushee-pieceâ and six patararoes,â another with eight patararoes (breech-loading swivel cannon mounted on the rails).\n\nSoon afterward, in company with corsario Alexandro ThomÃ¡s de LÃ©on, GuarÃ­n captured the small flibustier frigate Coronet, commanded by Jean Baptiste. Interrogated at Trinidad, Cuba, the French captain gave up exceptional detail regarding the plantation of Laurens de Graff on Saint-Domingue, and also on that of Michel, sieur de Grammont, another of the greatest buccaneers of the 1680s. He also learned that at his plantation de Graff had a mulatta wife or mistress he had âseizedâ from Veracruz, named Olaya de Escurre, with whom he had a son. (De Graff had only two lawfully married wives as far as we know: he divorced Petronilla de Guzman of the Canary Islands to marry the wealthy widow Anne Dieu-le-Veut on Saint-Domingue after he became a French officer.) It is possible that de Escurre was his mistress from his years when he lived in Veracruz in the service of the Armada de Barlovento as a gunner, or that he in fact enslaved her, or otherwise carried her away as human plunder, during the sack of Veracruz.\n\nGuarÃ­n, commanding two piraguas, or quite probably galeotas (piragua and pirogue are often used mistakenly for half-galley/galeota), built for the purpose in Havana, possibly including the one shown above, captured the guardhouse then sacked the plantation, taking numerous slaves as plunder and liberating a number of formerly free mulatta women who had been carried away as slaves from Veracruz. Among the prisoners was the young son of de Graff and de Escurre, whose capture the governor of Cuba hoped might force de Graff into negotiations and thereby reduce raids on Spanish ships and towns. De Graff was not present when his plantation was raided.\n\nIn February 1686, commanding two piraguas (according to Spanish records) or two âgalleysâ (according to English records, thus we will assume one was the half-galley shown above), GuarÃ­n attacked two English smugglers: the Swallow pink (a flute) of 22 guns commanded by Edward Goffe, and the Ann sloop of 6 guns commanded by [William?] Peartree, off the Tayabacoa River, Cuba, near Trinidad. (Spanish records Hispanicize the names as âGafi y Peltre.â) The English captains claimed to be seeking to wood and water, as was permitted by treaty, a common, usually false, claim made by smugglers. Rebuffed at Trinidad, they sailed SE ten leagues to the small cays off the Tayabacoa.\n\nThe Spaniards soon arrived and attacked; the battle was brutal and bloody. According to Goffe, âthe Governor of Trinidad sent two galleys out, one of forty and one of eighty-five men, the latter of which, as the master confesses, was present at the sack of New Providence. Both galleys came up to my shipâs side, and without hailing poured in a volley, which killed two men and wounded five or six, and then making fast to my shipâs side tried to board her. Having the sloopâs crew on board we defended ourselves, and after about half an hourâs engagement, there were about sixty Spanish pirates killed and thirty-eight wounded. The smaller galley managed to clear herself, but the larger we captured and brought into Jamaica.â\n\nGuarÃ­nâs account is similar, but with ugly accusations of murder. He states that he lost 24 men killed in the battle, with 50 more abused and murdered after the battle, including his lieutenant hanged by the English victors, and 30 more of his men put ashore. He himself was severely wounded, and, along with his surgeon, carpenter (a Maltese), and a mulatto from Havana named Juan CristiÃ¡n, was carried into Jamaica.\n\nGuarÃ­n and his comrades were tried for piracy; he and Juan CristiÃ¡n were sentenced to hang. Although GuarÃ­nâs commission was sufficient to protect him from prosecution for piracy for his attack on the Swallow and the Ann, it could not protect him from prosecution for his attack on New Providence and for seizing the boat and eight crewmen of the HMS Bonetta. Even so, by good fortune both men were reprieved when the Spanish Assiento (slave trade) representative in Jamaica, Don Santiago del Castillo, contacted the Spanish ambassador in London, Don Pedro de Ronquillo, who petitioned King James II to release the convicted pirates.\n\nIn fact, Lieutenant-Governor Molesworth had already reprieved him pending the recommendation of King James II: âThe Spanish captain referred to in my last has been found guilty of piracy, for robbing a sloop from Nevis and stealing Capt. Stanleyâs boat. For reasons relating to our Spanish trade, and understanding that he had treated those under his power well and had apologised to Captain Stanley, soon after committing the fact, for not knowing his to be a Kingâs ship, I have granted his reprieve. I am since glad that I did so, for I find that the Spanish Governors will be very much concerned for him, and particularly those who have obliged me most by granting restitution of prisoners. Lately I have received a letter from the Governor of Santiago, in Cuba, demanding him in the same manner as I have demanded prisoners, and making such excuses for him that I conceive, if he had been executed, it would have passed current among Spanish Governors that he had suffered only for carrying out the Spanish Kingâs Commission. This would have raised a great clamour against us and would have endangered all our traders who are or may in future fall into their power. I have therefore reprieved him till the Kingâs pleasure be known.â\n\nBy October, 1686, GuarÃ­n and his comrades were free men again but his adventures afterward were tame by comparison. With a new vessel provided by investors, possibly another half-galley, he transported the governor of Florida to St. Augustine, patrolled the Cuban coast, and, on July 4, 1688 was dispatched unsuccessfully aboard his piragua or half-galley along with an urca (a Spanish fluyt) to seek a pirate frigate, brigantine, and canoe at Santa LucÃ­a, Cuba, believed at the time to have been commanded by the notorious Dutch flibustier-in-French-service Jan Willems aka Captain Yanky (also Yankey).\n\nGuarÃ­n soon found himself imprisoned again, but this time not by his English or French enemies, but by his compatriot cubanos in Havana. His vessel was seized after he was accused by some local hidalgos of having sold slaves captured at the Bahamas and Saint-Domingue that actually had belonged to them before being plundered by English and French buccaneers. One scholar suggests this was a false accusation to protect the governor against accusations of engaging in contraband.\n\nAccording to Spanish law, as a CapitÃ¡n de Mar y de Guerra, a title accorded him by his privateering commission (patente de corso), he should have been immune to such accusations. Even so, GuarÃ­n spent a year and a half in jail, and the last we hear of him is that his case was pending at the Council of the Indies. There is no record of this bold corsario taking to sea again.\n\nFor more information on this and other Cuban corsarios, see El Corso en Cuba Siglo XVII by CÃ©sar GarcÃ­a del Pino (Havana: Editorial de Ciencias Sociales, 2001), and La Defensa de la Isla de Cuba en la Segunda Mitad del Siglo XVII by Francisco Castillo MelÃ©ndez (Seville: DiputaciÃ³n Provincial, Sevilla, 1986). The English eyewitness account and associated correspondence can be found in the Calendar of State Papers Colonial, America and West Indies, 1685-1688.\n\nA Captured Spanish Half-Galley Commanded by NicolÃ¡s Brigaut in 1686\n\nBy the mid-1680s most major Spanish ports had at least one galeota used for intercepting smugglers, pirate hunting, and raids of reprisal, and also as an advice (dispatch) vessel. Of shallow draft, with the ability to maneuver under both sail and oar, the vessels were ideal for their purpose. They could attack from and escape over shallow waters, attack in calms at the bow or stern of smugglers and pirates and thereby avoid their broadsides, and could travel close inshore and up-river for raids on French and English settlements.\n\nMost had two masts with a single lateen sail on each, approximately thirty oars or sweeps, a long thrusting prow or beakhead, one or two carriage guns in the bow, and often four or more patereroes (swivel cannon) on the rails at the bow and stern. Sweeps were stowed on gallows amidships when not in use. Recognizing their utility, both the French and English began using them, either constructing them themselves or using captured Spanish ones. In English the vessel was typically referred to as a half-galley, in French as a demi-galÃ¨re or sometimes, confusingly, a pirogue, and in Spanish as a galeota or occasionally, again confusingly, a piragua.\n\nMichel, sieur de Grammont, the âgeneralâ of the buccaneers at the sack of Campeche (Laurens de Graff was the buccaneer âadmiralâ), brought away a half-galley with him after the town and surrounding region were attacked at length and then abandoned in 1685. In April of the following year Grammontâ set about to attack St. Augustine, Florida via the southern passage at Matanzas.\n\nWith Grammontâs flotilla was the half-galley captured at Campeche, armed with two carriage guns (remember, at sea a cannon is called a gun, back then and even today) at the bow and now commanded by Capitaine NicolÃ¡s Brigaut. His job was to collect intelligence, secure provisions, capture Native American interpreters, and prevent a warning from getting to St. Augustine while doing so. He easily captured a few soldiers from the watchtowerâthey rowed out to find out who he was and thereby discovered to their dismay who he was. The buccaneers tortured at least two of them for information regarding the defenses of St. Augustine.\n\nIt wasnât long before word got to St. Augustine in spite of Brigautâs precautions, and a small force commanded by JosÃ© Begambre was sent against Brigaut and his marooned flibustiers. According to one account, the pirate captain sent two boatloads of men ashore, and according to another they fought from the half-galley. In any case, after a four hour battle the small Spanish force withdrew with casualties.\n\nFirst point to Brigaut and his men! But plans seldom work as well in reality as in theory. Fortune turned against the pirates in the form of accident or ignorance of the local waters, and the half-galley wrecked on Matanzas Bar.\n\nWorse, two more forces under the commands of CapitÃ¡n Antonio de ArgÃ¼elles, who had successfully ambushed attacking pirates in 1683, and Sargento Mayor (in other words, âMajorâ) Pedro de Aranda y Avellaneda, the former with nine soldiers and the latter with forty, arrived the following morning. The pirates had come ashore and, according to one account, made simple trenches from which to defend against a counterattack. After a second firefight, the Spanish again withdrew with casualties. The pirates had lost the element of surprise and feared more reinforcements. Brigaut sent several men in a shipâs boat to warn Grammont with instructions to pick the stranded pirates up at Mosquito Bar, the location today of New Smyrna Beach. The pirates headed south during the night.\n\nFive leagues shy of their destination the gallant Brigaut and his gallant crew â or so we suppose they were gallant, at least in battle â were set upon by fifty or sixty Native Americans intent upon freeing the piratesâ prisoners. Again Brigautâs flibusters put their attackers to flight. Unfortunately, one of Brigautâs prisoners, Juan LÃ³pez, escaped and brought word to St. Augustine. Almost immediately gallant CapitÃ¡n Francisco de Fuentes and fifty gallant men â again, we suppose they were gallant â headed south in two pirogues to attack Brigaut and his men at Mosquito Bar. Meanwhile, news spread fast in St. Augustine that as many as seven pirate ships had been seen, and that Grammont and his sloop were preparing to make a landing to the north now that the southern approach had been thwarted. Clearly the attack was not yet defeated.\n\nAnd at Mosquito Bar the substance was of life and death, of raw survival, and, unfortunately for the buccaneers, luck was on the side of the Spanish by means of the timely accident that Brigautâs men were separated into two parties. Luck, or Fortune if you will, often has poor timing, almost as if on purpose. The Spaniards slaughtered the nineteen pirates in the smaller group, then attacked the larger and massacred all but three, their desperate courage notwithstanding. Those they spared were not, by the way, any of the four remaining Spanish prisoners held by the pirates, which strongly suggests either that nearly everyone was slaughtered in an orgy of violent fear and rage that refused to distinguish between friend and foe, or that the Spanish believed the prisoners had deserted to the pirates, which Spaniards sometimes did, and so they put them to the sword as well.\n\nOnly here, in this description of slaughter, does our Hollywood image of Hollywood actors acting in Hollywood style â our cultural interpretation, in other words â begin to fail us as we â rather, if we â imagine soldiers and pirates sweating profusely in the combination of heat, humidity, rage, and fear, their hands and faces blackened with spent gunpowder, their burning eyes squinting from salt and the sea glare; as we imagine the sand sticking to the blood of those killing and of those dying or dead, most of whom probably called upon God both to kill and to save; as we imagine the flies swarming over and upon the dark purple that now stained, however briefly, the windswept battlefield dotted with the living and the dead among the coastal scrub.\n\nWe donât know for sure if the Spaniards simply refused to grant quarter and slaughtered the pirates and prisoners in battle, or massacred them immediately after they surrendered, and itâs even possible that the pirates killed their prisoners themselves. Pirates liked to hold hostages, and French pirates sometimes decapitated their terror-stricken hostages â well, most were probably terror-stricken, but there may have been a few stubbornly courageous hold-outs who were merely afraid but not terror-stricken â when their demands werenât met. Of course, hostage- and head-taking is something we find deplorable today, at least in âthe real world,â but we generally condone in film and on television, at least if the hostage takers are the good guys and they donât decapitate except in a fair fight. Terrorists and drug cartels behead the innocent â but surely our beloved swashbucklers donât.\n\nEven so, the pirates probably shouted something on the order of âMatamos los rehenes!â in Spanish at their attackers, which means âWe are going to kill the hostages!â although the Spanish is actually in the present indicative tense, not the future simple, which is a more common usage in Spanish than in English when threatening future action. Just so you know.\n\nA fair number of pirates could speak Spanish as a second language because it was useful for interrogating and torturing and tactical pretending and such. And some pirates were Spanish, siding with the English buccaneers and French flibustiers and against their own for profit, and probably a few for revenge â conversos and âcrypto-Jews,â for example, although the Spanish interrogations of Spanish-born pirates Iâve seen are silent on the issue. Still, itâs likely some were.\n\nAt any rate, âMatadlos, no nos importa!â the Spaniards probably shouted back at the pirates, which means, more or less, âGo ahead and kill them, we donât care!â although the phrase was more likely something on the order of âGo ahead and kill them you murdering French dogs, you pirates, thieves, and cutthroats, you sons of whores and cuckolds, you mostly Lutheran [which is what Spaniards called all Protestants] therefore un-Christian except in name French cowards who torture the innocent and rape virgins and bugger each other, and bugger your ugly French-poxâd mothers too!â Or likely something along these lines. Such language is common among soldiers and sailors of all eras.\n\nAs for the battle itself, likely the truth lies betwixt, as often it does: most of the pirates probably died in battle, and the rest, given that there was some quarter given, were summarily put to the sword in a violent assault right after they surrendered, which seems a reasonable if uncivilized thing to do to the pirates who had sacked Veracruz and Campeche, raping and murdering and torturing as they did. There is speculation that the Spaniards may have given no quarter due to the mistaken belief, carried by escaped prisoner Juan LÃ³pez to St. Augustine, that the Spanish renegade Alonso de Avesilla, who had guided the pirates during the 1683 attack on the city, was in command of the half-galley.\n\nHowever, Avesilla (possibly the same Spanish corsario known as Augustino Alvares who commanded a barco luengo in 1683) reportedly had died at the flibustier home port Petit Goave two years before; his name may have been given out by the pirates as a joke. The three spared pirates were the white French captain Brigaut and a black pirate named Diego, a ânativeâ of St. Christopherâs (therefore his real name might have been James or Jacques), until they could be interrogated, and a boy on account of his age. Diego, by the way, given that he was spared with Brigaut, may even have been Brigautâs quartermaster, that is, his second-in-command, making him the highest ranking black â of full African origin, in other words â pirate officer of the so-called âgolden ageâ discovered to date.\n\nBrigaut confessed and was put to death â âConfess and be hanged!â has a long history in literature as well as in murderous hypocrisy of both the religious and political sort â at St. Augustine alongside Diego the Black Pirate who probably thought that piracy was a far better way of life than slavery (assuming he had been a slave), or at least until it came time to be hanged or garroted. Long before this Grammont had abandoned his attack on St. Augustine.\n\nThe official French account of the incident at Matanzas, sent from Governor de Cussy of Tortuga and Saint-Domingue to his superior in France, the Marquis de Seigneley, only barely resembled reality. Brigaut wasnât a pirate, he was merely seeking provisions. The law permitted this seeking of provisions, water, and shelter in extremis. In fact, Brigaut wasnât even mentioned by name, although his commander, the sieur de Grammont, briefly was.\n\nMost of the few lines describing the incident were devoted to the sad story of a young Parisian of good family, the sieur de Chauvelin, who was reportedly given quarter, taken before the governor of St. Augustine, then put to death in spite of his quality as a gentleman. Further, during the battle itself it was twenty, or maybe seventy, pirates â or rather, twenty or seventy innocent French privateers attacked while innocently seeking provisions per international agreement â standing valiantly against three hundred Spaniards, who prevailed only after reinforcements arrived.\n\nGovernor de Cussy heard this story from a flibustier captain named du Marc, who had recently escaped from Spanish imprisonment and who probably had the story second hand, or even third or fourth hand. In any event, according to the French version, the beastly Spaniards werenât hanging pirates who had come to sack St. Augustine, to plunder, murder, and rape. Rather, they were murdering young Parisian gentlemen who were only seeking provisions. Or murdering at least one young Parisian gentleman, and if one, then probably others, naturally. All we really know from du Marcâs version of this story is that a young man named Chauvelin, of adventurous spirit, joined a band of flibustiers and probably died on or near a pretty Florida beach.\n\nSo, was the half-galley depicted above the one commanded by Brigaut? Probably, or more than probably, for my research strongly suggests that there were only two half-galleys at French Hispaniola in the late 1680s: NicolÃ¡s Brigautâs, captured at Campeche in 1685 by the sieur de Grammont, then home-ported at Petit Goave, and lost in 1686 at Matanzas, Florida; and one built by the French and apparently home-ported at Cap FranÃ§ois, the French capital of Saint-Domingue. The latter was sent in 1686 to look for remnants the pirate Banisterâs crew at Samana after a pair of English men-of-war destroyed his ship, the Golden Fleece. A third, Spanish, which I originally believed to have been captured in 1687 at Petit Goave, in fact escaped to Cuba.\n\nBrigautâs half-galley would have been home-ported at Petit Goave, and the illustration is part of a 1688 chart of Petit Goave. Paul Cornuau, who drew the chart, had been at Hispaniola since at least 1684 and would have been familiar with the vessel. In fact, it is entirely possible that the two flibustiers standing in the foreground might be members of its crew, perhaps even Brigaut and Diego, but unfortunately weâll never know.\n\nIâve used numerous sources for this account, more than Iâm inclined to list here. However, interested readers can start with âGrammontâs Landing at Little Matanzaâs Inlet, 1686,â by Luis R. Arana and Eugenia B. Arana in El Escribano: The St. Augustine Journal of History, 9, no. 3 (1972); âThe Testimony of ThomÃ¡s de la Torre, a Spanish Slaveâ by Alejandra Dubcovsky in The William and Mary Quarterly, Vol. 70, No. 3 (July 2013); and The Struggle for the Georgia Coast by John E. Worth (Tuscaloosa: University of Alabama Press, 2007).\n\nThe 14-gun Saint-Roze & a 6-gun Bark Commanded by Laurens de Graff & Jean Charpin\n\nIt is no accident that Laurens de Graff looms large in these histories of eyewitness images of piratical vessels: he was the greatest of buccaneers in the 1680s, a period also in which French engineers were drafting charts of French Caribbean ports and illustrating them with local ships and buccaneers.\n\nIn the year 1687 de Graff was still cruising as a buccaneer in French service, but had been offered and accepted a commission as a regular military officer in the service of the French king. However, before he could take up said commission, he must first receive his pardon for the death of Captain Nicolas Van Horn in a duel at Campeche in 1685, his letters of naturalization as a French citizen, and his commission as an officer.\n\nSo while he waiting he did what he knew best: he cruised for Spanish plunder. Late in the previous year he lost his famous Neptune, with which he had fought the two greatest ships of the Armada de Barlovento, forcing them to withdraw. While chasing a Spanish bark near Cartagena de Indias, he ran aground on an unknown rock or reef. The crew of the Spanish bark ran their vessel aground and set it afire, but Laurens quickly set out in a canoe, boarded it, put the fire out, and put his crew aboard\n\nThis small six-gun bark, which may be seen on the right side of the image above, replaced his grounded and foundered Neptune. In March 1687 Laurens and his one hundred fifty men â imagine them all crammed into the small bark! â raided the coast of Costa Rica and ascended the Matina Valley. In August thirty of his crew abandoned the cruise and returned to Petit Goave, and in October Laurens and the rest of his crew returned, having first captured the Santa Rosa of seventy-six tons (probably toneladas de mercante, roughly equal to ninety de guerra, close to English tonnage) and fourteen guns near Cartagena. The small Assiento ship was en route to Curacao to buy slaves, and therefore had approximately 75,000 pieces-of-eight aboard â and each manâs share would come to roughly 500 pieces-of-eight, quite a profitable cruise in the end!\n\nThe Santiago, a frigate of the private pirate-hunting Armada de VizcaÃ­nos (the Armada of Biscay, or informally, Basque Armada, referred to as La Armada de Nuestra SeÃ±ora del Rosario by its former admiral), commanded by FermÃ­n de SalabarrÃ­a who had once served as general of the galleons of the Philippines, set out in pursuit but ran aground; the ship was lost on June 26, 1688. The armada had some minor successes, but largely failed at its purpose, apparently preferring trade and smuggling to less profitable pirate hunting.\n\nAt Petit Goave Laurens received his pardon, naturalization, and commission as an officer, and also orders from Governor de Cussy to occupy Ãle-Ã -Vache. Everyone knew war was coming, and preparations had begun in earnest. Unfortunately, in spite of his now official status as a French major responsible for helping defend Saint-Domingue, de Graff had almost immediately set sail again as a buccaneer, with the Saint-Roze as his flagship and the small Spanish bark, the latter almost certainly commanded by his lieutenant Jean Charpin.\n\nReceiving word of this, Governor de Cussy set sail in the French man-of-war Le Marin and intercepted de Graff and Charpin and ordered them to abandon their plans to cruise against the Spanish, and return to Petit Goave. The incident, illustrated by Parthenay, is shown below.\n\nTo pacify the restive buccaneers, de Cussy granted land at Cul de Sac to one hundred fifty of them. The remainder sailed with de Graff and Charpin sailed to Ãle-Ã -Vache to follow de Cussyâs orders and occupy the often disputed island.\n\nWell, sort of.\n\nWhether instigated by de Graff who would profit from the voyage, or by French buccaneers who had no intention of sitting on their butts occupying an island when they could be cruising against the Spanish, seventy or eighty of them signed articles, with Jean Charpin as their captain and Mathurin Desmarestz as their quartermaster, and set sail aboard the Saint-Roze with de Graffâs blessing â after all, as owner of the ship, he would profit handsomely from a successful cruise.\n\nThe articles are notable because they are one of the few original sets that exist; most sets of known articles are described accurately in other sources, for example, in Alexandre Exquemelinâs works. However, although their articles are described in such sources, they are not recorded as written in individual sets of articles. For this reason Iâve included those of the Saint-Roze here, in their original French and in translation. The translation is mine, and any errors in it are therefore mine. Iâve annotated the English translation. (Additional extensive details on buccaneer articles can be found in The Buccaneerâs Realm.)\n\nCopie de la charte-partie faite entre\n\nM.

[Captains were typically given extra shares as âownersâ of their vessels; this is how they could get rich. Charpinâs ten shares would include two for his service as captain, as compared to the common buccaneerâs single share. This leaves eight shares for the vessel; such determination was based on the size and state of the vessel, and its armament, as judged by the crew. Such determination often worked out to roughly one share per ten tons or per gun (a general rule of thumb is one gun per ten tons for determining a vesselsâs armament), although it was just as often less than this, as it is here.]\n\nAll vessels taken at sea or at anchor carrying topsails which will not give themselves a voyage [i.e. be kept as prizes]; the vessels will be burned and the rigging will be [used] for the man-of-war [the Saint-Roze].\n\nItem. All vessels taken, the captain will have a choice; and those he does not choose will remain with the crew without the captain being able to claim anything from it. [Typically this means that the captain could swap his ship for another, if better.]\n\nItem. The captain reserves his cauldrons and his war canoe [canoes and pirogues were often used in the Caribbean instead of common shipâs boats]; and the cauldrons that will be taken will be for the crew. [Cauldrons, whether for cooking or for boiling cane juice were valuable and were common plunder. Here, the captain is probably claiming ownership over the shipâs cookroom cauldrons and the shipâs main boat or canoe.]\n\nItem. Any vessels taken out of cannon range with war canoes [armed canoes or boats] will be plundered. All bales [already] started [opened] between two decks or in the hold, pillage. [There was a distinction between plunder and pillage; the former was shared among the entire crew, owners, and government, the latter was usually shared only among the crew. The article indicates that bales found already open âtween decks or in the hold are pillage, not plunder. Of course, it would be hard to prove how many were already âstartedââ¦]\n\nItem. Gold, silver, pearl, diamond, musk, amber, civet and all kinds of precious stones, pillage. [This is a significant article, indicating that much valuable plunder will remain in the crewâs hands, not the ownerâs or governmentâs. However, coin/specie is almost certainly excluded by custom from the definitions of gold and silver.]\n\nItem. Whoever has the [first] sighting of the [captured] vessels will have 100 pieces-of-8 if the catch is valuable or double plunder [double share, if it is not valuable].\n\nItem. Any man crippled [maimed] in the service of the vessel [cruise] will have 600 pieces-of-8 or 6 blacks [slaves] according to his choice. [See also the article on surgeon payment below.]\n\nItem. Any man convicted of cowardice will lose his voyage [his shares and other profit will be confiscated and divided among the rest of the crew].\n\nItem. Any man falsely sworn and convicted of theft will lose his voyage [see article above] and be degraded [stripped of the name and quality of a flibustier and marooned without food or clothes, according to a 1697 source] on the first key [the first island encountered].\n\nItem. Any war canoe that goes out cruising that takes [captures] over 500 pieces [-of-eight] [it] will be for [divided among] the crew of said boat.\n\nItem. All blacks and other slaves [Native Americans, mulattos, and mestizos were often taken as slaves] who will be taken by the canoe will return to the foot of the mast [i.e. will be considered as pillage; pillage was typically divided at the foot of the mainmast, as were other division of spoils].\n\nItem. For the Spaniards [wounded Spanish prisoners] who will not [cannot] be cured, having arrived in place [to put them ashore?], the crew undertakes to give a piece of 8 for the said patients for the surgeon per day for the space of 3 months having arrived on land. [This appears to be payment to the shipâs surgeon for having treated wounded Spaniards. It probably also applies to any wounded, as an eyewitness description suggests: a piece-of-eight a day per patient to the surgeon for up to forty days, and the same to each wounded flibuster.]\n\nItem. M. de La Borderie and M. Jocom are obliged to supply the crew with everything they will need during the voyage; and the crew undertakes to give them 180 pieces of 8 for their chest; and those of the [Spanish] surgeons who will be captured with the instruments which will not be lined with silver will be for the [shipâs] surgeon. [This article applies to the two surgeons: they must supply all instruments and medicines for the voyage, for which they are to be paid 180 pieces-of-eight for their surgeonâs chests. Any captured surgeonâs chests belong to the shipâs surgeons unless the instruments &c are of silver, in which case they are pillage.]\n\nSaid charter cannot be broken or canceled until we have cruised together.\n\nDone at Ile Ã  Vache, at anchor and in harbor, 18 February 1688.\n\nThus signed: Jean Charpin and Mathurin Desmarestz, quartermaster of the crew.\n\nCaptain Jean Charpin, known among Caribbean Spaniards as Juanillo, was of mixed race, probably white and Native American. A native of SanlÃºcar de Barrameda in Spain, his father French, his mother Spanish, he was, like his former captain Laurens de Graff, a renegade who had deserted Spanish service. He had served at de Graffâs side since at least 1683. As a side note, Spanish records indicate that one of the crew of the Saint-Roze was a Genoese married to a Cuban woman at Guanauacoa.\n\nThe Saint-Roze set a course for the isle of Roatan in the Gulf of Honduras and careened there. The island was a well-known rendezvous of buccaneers, and soon the crew of the Saint-Roze was increased by the addition of a group of buccaneers â or more correctly, pirates â who according to French and Spanish records had returned overland from the South Sea (here, the Pacific coast of the Spanish Main) via the Coco River on the borders of Nicaragua and Honduras. Without doubt they were part of Pierre Picardâs expedition (as was buccaneer-author Raveneau de Lussan). Some scholars suggest instead that they many have recently left service under Jan Willems aka Yankey after he attacked the bodegas on the Rio Dulce and the Honduras urca at Puerto Caballos.\n\nIn any case, the new arrivals were commanded by a Huguenot named Jean Fantin who had previously served under the mutineer captain Pierre Pain aboard the French man-of-war La Trompeuse as quartermaster, and then under the Dutch flibustier-in-French-service (there were a lot of them) Captain Yankey aboard the Hardy. Having careened, the buccaneers set sail and plundered Trujillo and Olancho in Honduras, gaining only small plunder, six thousand pieces-of-eight of which were acquired via the ransom of local officials. From Honduras the buccaneers sailed to Cuba, cruised off Havana to no profit, went ashore to shoot pigs and cattle for provisions, and slipped away from an armadilla sent after them.\n\nFrom Cuba the buccaneers sailed to New Castle in Pennsylvania (modern Delaware), capturing en route a Dutch merchantman of 120 tons and fourteen guns. They also captured an English sloop trading from Barbados to the Bermudas. After plundering the sloop and taking it as a prize the buccaneers gave the merchant crew the Saint-Roze which was becoming unseaworthy, and was certainly unfit for a voyage to the far side of the world. The merchant seamen sailed the Saint-Roze to Barbados where it was eventually sold for scrap, having been determined to be unfit for sea anymore and unrepairable â buccaneers had a deserved reputation as lazy seamen, often failing to do necessary maintenance and repairs. Charpinâs rovers soon released the merchant captain too, and returned his sloop to him as well.\n\nThe buccaneers sold the cargo of the Dutch prize, now named the Dauphin, in New Castle, âPennsylvaniaâ (the region, including New England, was always a haven for pirates) for provisions. The buccaneers sailed to Boa Vista in the Cape Verdes, originally intending to plunder the Guinea Coast. Here they debated their next course: Guinea, the Red Sea, or the South Sea. Conflict set in: Jean Fantin was elected captain and claimed the Dutch prize as his own, contrary to the articles of the Saint-Roze. While there, a flotilla under the command of Jean du Casse arrived, en route to raid Surinam. Charpin appealed to du Casse regarding the Dutch prize, but was rebuffed. Du Casse also turned a blind eye to the buccaneersâ capture of a richly-laden sixteen-gun Spanish merchantman, commanded by Francisco Dias de Padilla, from Havana, other than to attach it as a fireship to his squadron, and persuade, by threat of force, the buccaneers to join his expedition.\n\nAfter du Casseâs desultory and generally unprofitable raid on Surinam, Charpin returned to Petit Goave in command of the Dauphin and, at least until 1695 and probably until King Williamâs War ended in 1697, served as a French flibustier corsaire (a buccaneer-privateer), operating largely in the Caribbean although at one point, in concert with Captain Picard and other flibustiers, he cruised far north to raid Rhode Island.\n\nHis quartermaster Mathurin Desmarestz (a nomme de guerre, his real name was Isaac Veyret) upon his return took a commission as captain of a French privateer flute, the Machine, of three hundred tons and eight guns out of Martinique. In 1690, in consort with a barque commanded by the sieur de Montauban, he captured a rich Spanish galleon, the JesÃºs Nazarena y Nuestra SeÃ±ora del Carmen, nicknamed the Ballestera and commanded by Pedro Fernandez de Valenzuela. Desmarestz and the Ballestera cruised the Caribbean for another year, then, having armed the ship with thirty-two guns and manned it with three hundred men, set sail for the Red Sea, to include encounters with Henry Everyâ¦ But thatâs another story!\n\nBut as or more interesting perhaps is the tale of the Spanish prize captured at the Cape Verdes, now commanded by Jean Fantin. The Huguenot captain and his crew returned to Martinique where they were commissioned as corsaires. Joining du Casseâs flotilla again, they sailed to St. Christopher where approximately one hundred ten of the crew assisted du Casse in mounting a six-gun battery ashore to dislodge the English defenders. As they did so, the remaining eight English aboard mutinied, âovercameâ the dozen remaining French buccaneers, and set sail for Antigua where they were commissioned as an English privateer and recruited another seventy to eighty buccaneers for their crew.\n\nWhy does this matter? Because among these eight mutineer Englishmen were William Kidd and Robert Culliford (also Colliver), both of whom would meet again on the far side of the world, one as a failed pirate hunter, the other as a Red Sea pirate. In fact, both may have been with Fantin in the South Sea under Picard or with Yankey when he raided Honduras, or even were with Charpin aboard the Saint-Roze at Ãle-Ã -Vache. Kidd was made captain of the former French privateer, now named the Blessed William â and his crew would soon run away with the ship while Kidd was ashore, and turn pirate. The rest is history.\n\nAnd to add a curious footnote: the Santa Rosa is almost certainly the same Spanish Assiento slave ship owned by the company of Don Juan Coymans that in January 1686 was intended to carry 600 slaves to Portobello from Jamaica. In December 1684 it had sailed from Jamaica to Portobello with 304 slaves aboard. In March 1686 Lieutenant-Governor Hender Molesworth of Jamaica, having lost the service of the HMS Ruby, ordered the ship impressed and fitted out to hunt the pirate Bannister (see below), in company with the HMS Bonneta. However, the expedition does not appear to have actually sailed; the arrival of the HMS Falcon and HMS Drake precluded any need to impress the Spanish ship.\n\nFor more details on Charpin, Fantin, and Veyret, see the Dictionnaire des Flibustiers des CaraÃ¯bes by Jacques Gasser (Les Sables dâOlonne, France: Editions Beaupre, 2017). Details on the Coymans Assiento can be found in numerous scholarly studies.\n\nA Pirate Ship Captured at Baradaires, Saint-Domingue in 1687 by Flibustier Jean de Bernanos\n\nIn October 1687, upon hearing word that a pirate â described in French as a forbin, that is, a true pirate, not a flibustier â was on the coast, after having plundered the Guinea Coast of Africa and probably attempting to sell a cargo of slaves illicitly â Governor de Cussy dispatched the sieur de Franquesney aboard the man-of-war Le Marin to seize the pirate. No fool when it came to dealing with pirates, Franquesney recruited veteran buccaneer Jean de Bernanos, who recruited fifteen flibustiers to augment the naval seamen in case push came to shove.\n\nAt Baradieres the French man-of-war trapped the pirate who, hoping to ingratiate its crew with the warshipâs captain and crew, fired a twelve-gun salute, but to no avail. Bernanos and his men boarded and seized the small frigate and its cargo. For his service, Bernanos was awarded the ship, although almost certainly not its cargo which would have been seized by the local government as piratical goods. To date, I have found no records indicating who the captain and crew of the pirate ship were, nor even their nationality.\n\nLittle is known of Jean de Bernanos, aka Captain La Sound or Lessone, prior to his becoming a flibustier except that he had formerly been a captain of cavalry, in France as far as we know. One author reports his birth place and year as Metz, France, 1645, while others suggest his birth date and place are unknown. He is found first in written records as having crossed the Isthmus of Panama in 1679 with eighty-five buccaneers under his command and two hundred Native American allies. Forewarned of his coming by the leader of rival tribe, Spanish forces from Panama intercepted Bernanos at Cheapo and forced the buccaneers to retreat.\n\nIn 1680 Bernanos and his flibustiers aboard their ninety-ton, six-gun frigate joined John Coxon and company in the sack of Portobello, but declined to join the English buccaneers on their journey across the Isthmus of Darien and into the South Sea, a voyage made famous by the adventures of escapades primarily under the command of the famous rogue Bartholomew Sharp. Bernanos and his buccaneers turned back after the attack on the Spanish gold mines.\n\nBernanos next appears in command of a five-vessel flotilla: his SchitiÃ© of eight guns and eighty men; Grognietâs Saint-Joseph of six guns and seventy men; Blotâs Guagone (or Quagone) of eight guns and ninety men; Vigneronâs barque Louise of four guns and thirty men; and Petitâs âbateauâ RusÃ© of four guns and forty men. In May 1684 Bernanosâs buccaneers and their Native American allies ascended the Orinoco River and attacked Santo Tome de Guyana, capturing the local fort after a six-hour battle. Little plunder was found. Bernanos and his buccaneers burned the small town and carried away several important prisoners whom they ransomed at Port of Spain, Trinidad, for ten thousand pieces-of-eight and various goods and supplies. One scholar suggests the expedition up the Orinoco was in search of fabled treasure that did not exist.\n\nBernanos appears to have afterward retired to his plantation on Tortuga until brought back into service against the pirate at Baradieres. King Williamâs War broke out effectively in 1688, and in 1689 we find Bernanos in command of a twenty-gun, one-hundred fifty-man privateer, quite possibly the captured pirate vessel in the image above.\n\nIn May 1690 he attacked a flotilla of English turtle fishing vessels, but all escaped except for one bark, the Calapatch (a calapatch is the top shell of a turtle), who valiantly attacked the privateer, permitting the escape of its companions.\n\nSoon afterward Bernanos captured a considerable Spanish prize but the prize crew mutinied, sold the cargo at the pirate haven of St. Thomas â a Danish colony â where they recruited more men and turned pirate âagainst all flagsâ but reportedly perished in the end.\n\nIn 1692 Bernanos was commissioned as a major in the French army and was given command of the fortification at Port-de-Paix, Saint-Domingue. Described as a âbrave manâ¦, captain of cavalry, who had been a privateerâ¦,â he died defending Port-de-Paix against a combined English and Spanish attack in 1695.\n\nFor more information on Bernanos, see the Dictionnaire des Flibustiers des CaraÃ¯bes by Jacques Gasser (Les Sables dâOlonne, France: Editions Beaupre, 2017).\n\nThe Golden Fleece of Joseph Banister and the Saint-Nicolas aka Le Favori aka La Chavale of Michel Andresson and soon FranÃ§ois Rolle, 1686\n\nThe image above shows two ships, the Golden Fleece, a pirate, commanded by Joseph Bannister, and La Chavale, a flibustier but soon to be pirate, commanded by Michel Andresson. Drawn by shipâs clerk John Taylor, it was one of many that illustrated his manuscript of his life at Port Royal, Jamaica in 1687. However, although Taylor did sail aboard the HMS Falcon for a few months, he was not present during the attack on Bannisterâs ship, described below, in 1686, although he pretends he was; the details were described to him by officers and crew of the HMS Falcon.\n\nIf youâve read Captain Blood: His Odyssey by Rafael Sabatini, youâre familiar with the escape of Peter Blood and the Arabella from Port Royal, Jamaica, a scene Sabatini may have been influenced to write by the escape from Port Royal in early 1685 under the guns of Charles Fort by Captain Joseph Bannister (or Banister), commanding the 30-, 36-, or 40-gun, 400 ton merchantman Golden Fleece. The ship had been trading from London to Port Royal under his command at least as early as 1680, when she sank in nine fathoms while at anchor in the harbor. The Golden Fleece discharged her entire lading but, due to a lack of local goods, had loaded little in its place. The ship was top-heavy and when her crew went to one side to scrape the hull, the Golden Fleece overset, drowning several of her crew. With the help of several divers the ship was refloated and refitted, but at a loss of Â£1,000 to her owners, one of whom was surely Bannister.\n\nIn early May 1684, Bannister, heavily in debt probably due to losses from the 1680 accident, put to sea from Port Royal, claiming to be bound to New England for trade but intending piracy instead. He recruited one hundred men from local sloops and probably the French buccaneer haven at Petit Goave, and petitioned the French for a privateering commission, which was denied, although he apparently received some backing from the famous buccaneer Michel, sieur de Grammont. In July Bannister, his ship, and crew were captured by the English pirate hunting guardships HMS Ruby, HMS Bonetta, and a half-galley while he was catching and salting turtle for provisions in the Cayman Islands. Wisely, the pirates did not put up a fight. Bannister had â115 men on board, most the veriest rogues in these Indies,â according to Sir Thomas Lynch.\n\nBannister and his crew were held for piracy, having captured a Spanish canoe with two men aboard and kept the men as prisoners. But Bannister was able to communicate with allies in Jamaica, who provided him with money to pay the Spaniards for their canoe and cargo, and even to pay them wages while they had been in his custody. The Spaniards would not testify against Bannister, and so the grand jury, with a vote of nine opposed and four in favor, refused to find a true bill. Bannister, not believed likely to run due to security (a bond) provided by friends, was ordered held for a second attempt at trial for piracy. Meanwhile, he dispatched the Golden Fleece to London and back under another captain, but the voyage failed to bring him any profit. He therefore made his plans and preparations to once more attempt piracy.\n\nAs Lieutenant-Governor Hender Molesworth (1638 â 1689) of Jamaica described it, âAbout ten days since Captain Bannister one dark night sailed in a desperate manner passed the fort. He had, it is said, fifty men ready in the hold with plugs to stop shot-holes. But the sentries being careless, the night dark, and the wind fresh, he was abreast of the fort before Major Beckford, the commander, was warned, and had passed fourteen of the guns. Beckford did all that he could, but could only place three shot in him. He at once sent me word of the occurrence, which was a great surprise to me, for I thought that Bannisterâs want of credit would prevent him from ever getting the ship to sea again.â Bannister had slipped his cables; John Taylor claimed he had 160 men aboard.\n\nThe sloop HMS Bonetta (or Boneta, 4 guns, 57 tons; Bonito in colonial records), commanded by Edward Stanley, sailed after Bannister and ordered him to return but the renegade declined, giving assurances he had no intention of turning pirate, which he soon did. For the next year Bannister mixed first with French buccaneers then set out on his own, capturing Spanish vessels. A demand by the HMS Ruby that de Grammont, in whose flotilla he consorted for a while, turn him over for sailing under a foreign commission was rebuffed, ostensibly because the French claimed Bannister had no commission from them. The English captain did not insist, given the size and number of the French ships, which included those of de Grammont, Laurens de Graff, and Jan Willems aka Yankey â the three most powerful and famous of the 1680s. Bannister is believed to have remained with the French buccaneers, and was probably with them at the sack of Campeche soon afterward. But if so, it was to little profit.\n\nMeanwhile, in late 1685 two hired sloops manned with English naval seamen searched for two months but failed to find him. In January he was reported at the French buccaneer haven at Petit Goave, and in March Lieutenant-Governor Hender Molesworth ordered the impressment of the Spanish Assiento slave ship Sancta Rosa (see above!) to be used in the search for Bannister, given that the HMS Ruby was undergoing repairs. However, the arrival of two new men-of-war precluded this. In May 1686 Bannister was reported careening at Samana Bay on Hispaniola. Immediately the newly arrived HMS Falcon and HMS Drake were dispatched. The two men-of-war spent nearly all their powder pummeling the Golden Fleece as it lay on its side careened. Bannisterâs men had built gun emplacements and returned fire (a detail that would inspire part of the plot of The Black Swan by Sabatini), killing and wounding some of the English naval seamen. The Golden Fleece was damaged so badly that the pirates burned it in the end. Taylorâs drawing, a rather crude one, shows a large ship with raised forecastle and quarterdeck, but no poop deck (or a very short one).\n\nOccasionally a rabid pirate fan (typically on Wikipedia, often the encyclopedia of misinformation) will argue that this cannonading of a careened pirate ship was a pirate victory against the English navy, but itâs hard to claim victory when you lost your forty-gun pirate man-of-war while your enemies are still afloat and need only re-arm, and now you must cruise in a small sloop, and will end up as shortly to be described. For the English men-of-war, the fight was half-victory, half failure but â not defeat. The pirate ship was destroyed but the pirates remained at large.\n\nNearby, but not attacked, was a small captured urqueta (a flibot or small fluyt) manned by French buccaneers who took the marooned pirates aboard. The English buccaneers soon departed in a small Spanish bark or sloop captured by the French. Bannister, now sailing under a false name, and his men cruised the Mosquito Coast until captured by the HMS Drake after gaining intelligence of him from some of his former crewmen, all of whom had abandoned Bannister and six others, and ran away with the bark, abandoning him among the Mosquito Indians.\n\nBannister was captured âin disguise a-roasting a plantain, in a pore Indian wigwam.â One of his men fired a musket at the English seamen, for which he was killed in return. The other three of Bannisterâs crew were captured as well. The pirate captain and the three of his crew were hanged in January 1687 aboard the pirate hunter as it sailed within view of Port Royal. It was âa spectacle of great satisfaction to all good people and of terror to the favourers of pirates, the manner of his punishment being that which will most discourage others,â according to the Governor of Jamaica. After the Drake anchored with the hanged pirates as an example, the bodies were cut down and tossed into the sea near Gun Key. Two boys who had sailed with him were pardoned and turned loose in Port Royal, but both were hoisted aloft by âtheir armholes, at the mizonpeekâ while the four pirates were hanged. One of the boys, according to Charles Johnson, grew up to be the possibly fictional pirate captain William Lewis.\n\nThe French flibustiers at anchor near Bannister careening at Samana Bay were commanded at the time by Michel Andresson, often known as Captain Michel. Another of the famous French buccaneers of the 1680s, he succeeded to command of Laurens de Graffâs Le Tigre in 1682, and in 1683 commanded the company of buccaneers that stormed the southern bastion at Vera Cruz. In 1684 he was with de Graff and others off Cartagena when they were attacked by three Spanish slave ships converted to men-of-war; the buccaneers captured or destroyed the ships sent after them. De Graff took command of the thirty-four gun San Francisco Javier y San Lucas Evangelista and renamed it Le Neptune, and Andresson took command of La Paz (probably a nickname for the San Joseph) and renamed it La Mutine.\n\nIn company with Captain Brouage, Andresson captured two Dutch ships trading at Cuba, and carried the plunder to Boston for sale â New England Puritans were well-known for their hypocritical avarice (see link noted above). After some minor unprofitable adventures, most of Andressonâs crew deserted him in 1685 to cross the Isthmus of Darien into the South Sea (see buccaneer-author Raveneau de Lussan for details!). He soon joined an old comrade-in-arms, FranÃ§ois LeSage and was given command of his Dutch prize, the Saint-Nicolas, renamed Le Favori, a 100-ton, fourteen-gun flute originally intended to trade illicitly along the Spanish Main. Its crew of flibustiers were described as some of the most seditious and mutinous in the Caribbean.\n\nThe small ship, called La Chavale by John Taylor, who would have had it described to him by English naval officers and crew who had destroyed Bannisterâs ship, is clearly a small flute, known as an urqueta by the Spanish, a pink by the English, and a flibot by the French, as is described in other sources. If Taylor is correct about the name, it reflects a name-change under Andressonâs command.\n\nAfter a failed attempt to sail into the South Sea via the Strait of Magellan, Andresson, now separated from Le Sage, headed to the Caribbean to repair, careen, and provision for a second attempt into the South Sea. At Samana he met Joseph Bannister; the English attack had been focused only the English pirate, and the French escaped harm. After the departure of the English pirates whom they rescued, the French sailed to the Guinea Coast, first being nearly destroyed by an English merchantman, the Baudan, where they deposed Andresson and elected their quartermaster, FranÃ§ois Rolle, a Dutchman (real name Frantz Rools) as captain. The buccaneers sailed into the South Sea, where they remained until 1693.\n\nThe voyage is noteworthy because a complete manuscript written by one of the crew exists, and also because during their attack on Acaponeta, Mexico in 1688, the buccaneers carried a red flag of no quarter â the pavillon sans quartier â with a skull and crossed bones beneath. It is the only known instance of buccaneers flying the skull and bones, although likely it was flown at other times. As for Captain Rolle, he went ashore at Cayenne at the end of his voyage in 1693. He married a Dutchwoman there, purchased a large plantation, and remained there until his death in 1722 at the approximate age of eighty.\n\nThe Bannister text above was taken largely from a draft appendix for the forthcoming Annotated Edition of Captain Blood: His Odyssey, ed. Benerson Little. Details on both Bannister and the Andresson/Rolle voyage can be found in the authorâs book, The Golden Age of Piracy. The Calendar of State Papers, America and West Indies, 1685 â 1688 has numerous details regarding Bannister (search both Banister and Bannister).
