        "text": "Katherine Kath nee Lily Faess (Rose Marie Nelly Faess) was born in Berck Plage, Picardy, France in 1920 and was the fifth child to parents Adrien Faess and Alix Caserbo. Katherine, then known as Lily was very ambitious as a child and worked very hard with the support from her family to become the top ballet dancer in her class and achieved stage recognition very quickly.\n\nLily trained seven hours a day for ten years to become a Prima Ballerina at the Theatre du Chatelet in Paris, but due to an ankle injury and with medical advice was forced to give up the ballet to avoid permanent damage, much to Lily's disappointment.\n\nAs a result of the injury Katherine (Kath) moved into acting in the theatre and created a short sketch role of ‘Irma La Douce’ at the Caberet ‘’Chez Gilles’’ in Paris, a production by Grenier and Husneau (later brought to the screen by Billy Wilder starring Shirley MacLaine and Jack Lemmon in 1963).\n\nKatherine Kath had great success in the late 1940/50’s with a string of plays written by the highly acclaimed French writer Jean Anouilh (1910-1987), titles included ‘Antigone’, ‘Invitasion au Chateau’ (Ring Round The Moon), ‘Le Diner De Famille’. These theatre productions were a roaring success in Paris at the time, at the Theatre Marigny and established Katherine Kath as an actress and played to sold out houses every night. Other plays included ‘La Soif’ (1949) by Henry Bernstein (1876-1953) starring Jean Gabin (1904-1976), Claude Dauphin (1904-1976).
