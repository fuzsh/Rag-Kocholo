        "text": "Sex: M\n\nBirth: 26 May 1913 in Kenley, Surrey, England\n\nDeath: 11 Aug 1994 in Canterbury, Kent, England\n\nAs far back as Peter Cushing can remember, he always wanted to get into the theater and although his father was a Quantity Surveyor, Peter Cushing came from a family which had many connections with the theater. His grandfather had been with Sir Henry Irving and had accompanied him on his tours of Canada and the United States. His aunt had acted with Gertie Millerand his step-uncle, Wilton Herriot, was a well-known actor in his day, and had been one of the principals in \"Charley's Aunt\". All this was before he was born, however, and when he wanted to go on the stage, he had to do so through his own efforts.\n\nCushing was brought up in Kenley, a small Surrey village, and was educated at Shoreham Grammar School and the Purley County Secondary School, where he most enjoyed painting lessons, rugger, and amateur theatricals. His first professional encounter with the stage was when he was eleven years old. He and his brother ran a puppet show for the family and friends. An uncle had advised him not to charge an admission for fear of losing his audience, so Peter allowed his customers to watch for nothing. At the end of the show, however, his cagey brother stood at the door with an upturned hat and charged three pence per head to leave the room. Cushing found his first job with the Purley Urban District Council and a title of Surveyor's Assistant, which he says was little more then a glorified office boy.\n\nAt twenty-one, he answered an ad in \"The Stage\" for a position with the Worthing Repertory Company, but his application was not even answered. Neither were the next fifteen letters which he sent to the manager over the succeeding months. One morning, however, he did receive, at last, a reply and an invitation to go see the manager, Bill Fraser. Cushing immediately quit his job and left for Worthing with high hopes. When he met Mr. Fraser, he was merely told to stop being such a nuisance with all his letter writing.\n\n\"But I can't go back now. I've given up my job,\" explained the would-be actor tearfully. This must have stirred the manager's sympathy, for Peter went on stage that very night as a debtor in Priestley's play \"Cornelius.\"\n\nCushing worked at the Worthing for several months as the Assistant Stage Manager which he regales as the best possible training he could have had for a dramatic career. He was only paid la shilling a week, (about $210) but he did not live too badly. He was allowed to eat all the food which well-known grocery companies gave to the theater for \"eating scenes\" in return for a credit in the program. For this reason he grew especially fond of Coward and Lonsdale plays, for in nearly all of them, there was \"a pork pie at least\".\n\nHe then moved to Southampton where he played small parts and later worked with various companies all over England gradually working his way up to playing juvenile leads.\n\nLike many an actor before him Cushing had a strong desire to go to \"the Coast\", so after nearly four years in English repertory, he left for America with 60 pounds ($140) he had managed to save up until then. On January 18, 1939, Cushing left England for New York on the S.S. Champlain, with a one-way ticket paid for by his father. He spent his first week trying to make contacts in New York, and then went straight to Hollywood, where he got the attention of Edward Small Productions and found work after only two weeks.\n\nThis was in James Whale's film, \"The Man in the Iron Mask\", in which Louis Hayward played both parts of the good and the bad brother. A split screen technique was used to enable both brothers to appear at the same time, and Cushing was employed as the \"dummy\" during the making of such scenes. Cushing did not, there for, appear in the finished product, but the experience was very valuable to him. He was able to study at first hand the performances of several leading film stars and see himself on the screen in the rushes for the first time, which, he says, nearly made him faint. But the best part was that he received $75 a week, and four months steady employment, which amounted to what looked like a small fortune to him at the time. In the end, he also got a bit part on the film-a part for which he had very little difficulty in learning his lines, or rather line, for all he had to do was to gallop up on a horse and call: \"The Captain wishes to see you, Sir!\"\n\nHis next job was in George Stephen's film, \"Vigil in the Night\", as second leading man with Carole Lombard. Cushing says he was chosen be cause of his ability as a dialectician. No sooner was this film finished than war was declared between England and Germany. The British film colony in Hollywood, which included David Niven and Richard Green, went for their army medicals. Peter Cushing was graded 4c, our equivalent is 4f, all and was declared unfit for military service.\n\nCushing stayed in America for several more years, eventually getting more respectable roles in other movies, including one with Laurel and Hardy. As 1941 rolled around, and with Cushing getting severely homesick, he turned down a promise of stardom from MGM. However, as World War II was raging, he was unable to find transport home, and instead headed for Canada, working a variety of odd jobs along the way north. Finding a day job in a Montreal movie theater, and a night job at the local YMCA, Cushing did little entertainment work during his stay in Canada. His only film job was to paint a set of Nazi and Imperial Japanese flags for \"The Forty-Ninth Parallel\", but another employee at the YMCA misinterpreted this and he was arrested as a spy. Eventually clearing his name, he replaced a deserter on a ship headed for England and was on his way back home.\n\nEventually, he secured a place on a ship leaving Halifax for Liverpool. He took the place of a deserter on the S.S. Tilapa, which had been a banana boat before the war. He later learned that the 30 ship convoy with which she sailed was the first to use the peace time Atlantic route because the commodore decided it was \"too obvious for the Germans\" to mine. The gamble was successful, and the convoy reached England unharmed in March,1942, after only ten days at sea.\n\nUnfortunately, Helen Beck Cushing died in 1971 from emphysema. Her devoted husband seriously entertained the idea of suicide and began to withdraw from social life and acting, until he found a letter she had left him assuring that they would be re-united in some other incarnation. With that, he went back to work, appearing in numerous mid-to-late 70's films, including the role of Grand Moff Tarkin in \"Star Wars\". The quality and quantity of roles began to decline however, and Cushing worked only on sporadic occasions during the 1980's. Although he will be forever identified with horror, a quick look at his screen credits will show that although he made numerous horror films, an even larger chunk of his work was in Shakespeare, drama and comedy(!). He loved his horror roles, but ironically, did not enjoy horror films very much at all.\n\nDuring his declining years, Cushing was not an idle man, heavens no. In the years before his death he wrote \"Peter Cushing - An Autobiography\" and \"The Bois Saga\", an alphonetic history of his homeland, which was forty years in the making. He also indulged in his hobbies of painting, bird watching and answering fan mail. A skilled craftsman, he also worked on many personal projects. The \"gentle man of horror\", as he was dubbed, died after a long bout with prostate cancer on August 11, 1994, in Cantebury, Kent, England. He had had the disease since the early 1980's, and had made an almost complete recovery when it struck back with a vengeance. His last project was \"Flesh and Blood - The Hammer Heritage of Horror\", a documentary he had completed with Christopher Lee just a few weeks before his death.\n\nFilmography /TV guest appearances\n\n1.
