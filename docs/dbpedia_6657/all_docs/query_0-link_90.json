So when I had a chance to see the movie First Knight, I was in a doubt whether to watch this movie with a low rating of 5.6/10, even with great actors like Sean Connery and Richard Gere, or to skip to some other movie. Luckily I decided to give it a shot, and oh what a movie it was. I really love the medieval age and other historic movies, and this is a gem added to the list. As reading some other reviews revealed earlier, that this is an adaptation of Arthurian legend, and not a true story, so I didn't bothered about the facts in the movie. It scores really high in terms of acting, fight sequences, chemistry between actors, and especially keeps you engrossed throughout the movie. As a \"movie\", the story works well and has all the elements balanced. If you are a fan of historic movies, please don't trust the IMDb ratings for this movie. Just sit and watch this movie on a nice evening, and you won't repent it.,\n\nFirst Man\n\n7.3\n\n198K\n\n1.4K\n\n496\n\nMark Armstrong and Rick Armstrong said that this film contained the most accurate portrayal of their father Neil Armstrong and their mother Janet Armstrong.,Neil Armstrong never trained in the spin test device, known as MASTIF (multi-axis spin test inertia facility). The device was used for the original Mercury program astronauts but was deemed unrealistic and abandoned. It is considered an irony in space program history that Armstrong never trained in this device and yet is one of only two astronaut to actually experience the condition the device simulated.,Neil Armstrong: I don't know what space exploration will uncover, but I don't think it'll be exploration just for the sake of exploration. I think it'll be more the fact that it allows us to see things. That maybe we should have seen a long time ago. But just haven't been able to until now.,Near the end of the closing credits, the music is replaced by radio chatter from the mission.,Featured in Jimmy Kimmel Live!: Game Night: Ryan Gosling (2018),I See the Moon Written by Meredith Willson,I saw this movie at a sneak preview, and I had high expectations given the hype, but sadly, this was no \"The Right Stuff.\" The problem may lie in the main character on which the movie is based, Neil Armstrong. He is portrayed as a colorless technocrat, who is somewhat cold to his family. The movie focuses mainly on his family relationships, and the landing on the moon is somewhat secondary, therefore the movie lacks a lot of drama. This is unfortunate since Armstrong led a very charmed life as a fighter pilot, test pilot, and astronaut. The movie covers three of his serious incidents while flying, and he had at least three more, that could have been covered in a miniseries. A miniseries would have allowed for more in-depth probing of how Armstrong became the man he was. The main characters all suffer from superficial once overs. The astronauts were all household names but you wouldn't know it from this movie. The movie also had a hard time capturing just how terrifying some of the events were. Apollo 13 did a far better job of recounting the terror of that flight. Claire Foy as the wife was ok but she also had a degree of coldness about her. The movie also glosses over the misplaced disdain military pilots had for their civilian counterparts. The complaint was that civilian pilots by virtue of their engineering training were too mechanical and not true flyers. This was not true of Armstrong who got his pilots license at the age of 17. The movie should have started there. He was considered a brilliant engineer by his peers, and he was rightfully selected to be the commander of Apollo 11. That brilliance is not captured on screen. By the end of his career he had flown over 200 different aircraft. He was a giant. I think the movie should have brought that out.,\n\nFirst Man into Space\n\n5.4\n\n1.7K\n\n40\n\n31\n\nThe pilot in the stock footage sequences is Chuck Yeager.,When Commander Prescott exits a building, he passes a sign that reads, \"Flight Operations - Authorised Personnel Only\".

I went to the theater with my \"older\" friends, they were like 11-12. The movie scared the wits out of me; I hid my view behind the person sitting in front of me, my friends never let up on making fun of me. This was the first time I had gone to the movies with non-adults...big mistake! The monster was scary and creepy. It haunted me for years. In fact, I probably had some persistent subliminal turmoil over the movie. Fast forward to 2008 and I found the DVD to rent. I watched again, and guess what? The movie is still scary! It's pretty high-camp and was made on a limited budget, but the creepiness is still there. I suppose the fact that the back line story is believable makes it even more scary. Watching it with my wife probably exorcised some demons. Funny how movies can move us, positively or negatively. All my 60 years I can still rehash this event when I was eight. Still the scariest movie I ever saw. I dig it.,\n\nFirst of May\n\n6.8\n\n454\n\n13\n\n3\n\nCharles Nelson Reilly survived the worst circus disaster in history: the Ringling Bros.

I've got news for you: that's not possible. Was I surprised how much they packed in, when it comes to political references and hints and messages (not even really hidden ones) to the current state? You better believe that I was. I did think that it might hurt the movie because people do try to escape when watching a movie not really wanting to see something they see on their news channel all day anyway. But since it was action packed, maybe it could have worked. Seems like it didn't. Some will like it, some will hate it. But it won't convince either side to communicate more with each other. Which just to be clear is not the movies fault! Don't put that on the movie. It still has the premise we \"loved\" in the movie series which will obviously carry over to the TV show. And it works, if you let it and can see past the \"agenda\" or are with it anyway ... The criticism is there and to be honest, it doesn't seem that far fetched or stretched ... especially with some quotes almost being exact to those in real life ...,\n\nFirst Reformed\n\n7.1\n\n61K\n\n414\n\n279\n\nAmanda Seyfried was pregnant during the production.,The physician describes cancer treatment options referring to them as \"diagnostic tools\".,Reverend Ernst Toller: Courage is the solution to despair, reason provides no answers.

Hoffman Performed by Julia Murney, Ronald Peet, Elanna White, Jake Alden-Falconer, Eric Lockley, Krystina Alabado,Paul Schrader's new drama \"First Reformed\" is a drama about a grieving reverend who is counseling a couple--the husband of which is a radical environmentalist. This is a talky, dialogue- driven, and unsettling thriller that makes you both empathize with its characters as well as send a chill down your spine at times. The film's deeply intellectual and serious commentary on matters of religion and environmentalism is profound and thoughtful. This movie will likely not be suited for mainstream audiences desiring cheap entertainment, but serious viewers looking to be challenged in their thought processes will have much material to ponder during--and after--they view the movie. The acting is very strong, as Schrader commands his cast into giving low-key but quietly powerful and resonant performances. The standouts in the cast are Ethan Hawke's lead role as well as Amanda Seyfried and Cedric the Entertainer in the supporting cast. A gripping, dark (almost relentlessly so at times) tone keeps the viewer engrossed in the film. While this isn't a horror film (despite containing disturbing content and moments,) the film's simple score is incredibly chilling and gets under one's skin more than almost any other film's score I have witnessed in a long time. My only complaints about this film are found in the third act. A dreamlike, surrealistic scene inspired by impressionism that involves the protagonist and Seyfried's character feels out of place given the grim tone deeply rooted in realism. Additionally, a quick and highly abrupt cut in the film's finale feels disappointing and almost like the equivalent of a 'cop-out' in film editing. It did not positively impact how I viewed the film's ending. But other than these concerns, this is a very well-made and serious drama designed to quietly shock audiences into a state of reflection on the world today as we know it. 8/10,Beau Is Afraid, The Green Knight, and more striking images from A24 studio's films.,\n\nFirst Spaceship on Venus\n\nnull\n\nnull\n\nnull\n\nnull\n\nnull\n\nFirst Sunday\n\n4.6\n\n11K\n\n48\n\n66\n\nTracy Morgan shot the whole movie with an ankle bracelet on his ankle, where if he didn't leave the set to go straight home, he was going to jail.,When the Baltimore Police are chasing Durell and LeeJohn's van, we can see a large billboard for DJ BIG BOY, a DJ for Los Angeles radio station Power 106, in the background.,Rickey: What kinda name is LeeJohn anyway?

I personally think that Ice Cube can do better, and he can achieve something more great the \"Friday\" series.His acting is getting better and better, but he should try to change the plot of his movies or maybe a drastic change in his character.At all, this movie production is not something amazing,but this is not its main mission. It's just a good comedy, that can waste your time, without wasting its limit. By the way its worth nothing the fact that there are some really funny characters that are really moving the thing in this production. Like the chore director for example, or the priest.Actually this is the main element that makes me rate the movie at a more high score. It seems that almost everything was half-baked- the plot is good, but could have been better, and the actors a re funny,but could be funnier.,\n\nFirst They Killed My Father\n\nnull\n\nnull\n\nnull\n\nnull\n\nnull\n\nThe First Time\n\n6.8\n\n73K\n\n93\n\n22\n\nThe two main cast, Dylan O'Brien and Britt Robertson dated off-set.,When Aubrey and Dave are driving after he picked her up at her house, Aubrey's hair is curly.

I don't feel the need to summarize what the movie is about, as the other reviews and the summary does that job, but I really enjoyed this movie. The writing for this movie really stood out to me, as the conversations felt so real between characters because of subtle little things that happen in most conversations in real life. That's a credit to the actors as well, but when you see the movie, especially the first time the main characters meet, you will understand what I mean. It's a shame this film didn't get a bigger release in theaters because Dylan O'Brien and Britt Robertson are both terrific. They make the two characters blend so well together it's hard not to root for them to wind up together. The supporting cast does a great job as well, but this movie is all about Dave and Aubrey so there wasn't a large chunk of material for any of them. The only thing I can suggest for this movie is don't go into it expecting to make you laugh hysterically. Don't get me wrong, it's a very funny movie, but it's more of the type that makes you smile, grin, or giggle. Can't go without mentioning the soundtrack either, its phenomenal and every song goes with its moment. Overall, I highly recommend this movie.

However, I must admit that I enjoyed it a lot more than I thought I would. The premise is rather simple and focuses on 3 old college friends who end up re-united due to the death of their old college friend Cynthia (Stockard Channing). The 3 college friends are Elise Elliot (Goldie Hawn), Brenda Cushman (Bette Midler) and Annie Paradis (Diane Keaton). Whilst, the circumstances surrounding their reunion are unfortunate, the 3 women use this opportunity to catch up. Whilst, it is clear that they have lived rather different lives since they left college, they find that they all have one thing in common; their husband's have left them for/cheated on them with young women. With the 3 protagonists feeling disgruntled about the way they've been treated, they decide to set up the First Wives Club and take revenge on their cheating husbands; Whilst, the film is rather slow to get moving, I did find that this to be an enjoyable film. This film was a lot of fun with plenty of laughs. The 3 protagonists characters were all well developed and some of the schemes they come up with to get their own back on their respective partners were rather clever. I felt that Goldie Hawn gave the stand out performance, but that's not to discredit Midler and Keaton who were also fantastic. What really impressed me about the First Wives Club was the ending (which I won't give away), but let's just say that there was slightly more to it than meets the eye. All in all, this was a fun ride with plenty of laughs. The plot summary will suggest that it is geared more towards women and if I'm honest I think that more women will enjoy this than men. Having said that I'm a man and I still enjoyed it.

Weller collared Haim, throwing him up against a wall to warn him not to speak to him after a take, and it took three assistants to separate them. Haim later admitted that he was terrified by the experience, but Weller apparently was method acting, unaware by anybody else.,Sam: Hey come back here you little shit-head! Wendy: Hey! Don't talk to Jake like that! Sam: He acts like a shit-head! And you let him act like one! Wendy: Well you don't have to act like one too!,Featured in At the Movies: Give My Regards to Broad Street/Thief of Hearts/The Little Drummer Girl/Firstborn (1984),No Guarantees by Alex Blanc (as A. Blanc) and Safeway Goya (as S. Goya) Performed by The Nobodys,First Born is good psychological exploration in the various signs of breakdown of kids dealing with tough family situations. Here, Christopher Collet (Prayer of the Rollerboys) is Jake Livingston, a fifteen year old kid who lives with his mom (Terri Garr) and younger brother, Brian (Corey Haim). And, things are fine for a while for Jake, despite his dad going to Montreal to marry his girlfriend, leaving Jake a tad sympathetic of his still single mother. But things quickly fall apart when his mom's new boyfriend, Sam (Peter Weller), enters the picture, and eventually moves in. While his mom has dated in the past, there is something about Sam that neither Jake nor Brian can tolerate. They can't figure out what their mother sees in this guy. Sam is kind of a flake. He never gives too much information about his past. The longer that Sam stays, the worse things become. He starts getting violent towards the boy, he starts bringing drugs into the house, and Jake's mother eventually starts falling into the same dangerous patterns as Sam while neglecting her own boys who plead with her to realize what Sam is really all about. For the first born, Jake, this is not something he can ignore, and has the responsibility of finding a way to protect himself, his brother, and most of all, his mother. This movie presents the kind of psychological breakdown kids may go through when faced with serious family issues. Before Sam arrived, Jake was a funny, easy going kid. He was a good student and spent a lot of time with his friends (one of whom was played by Robert Downey, Jr.) and girlfriend (Sarah Jessica Parker). Afterwards, both his and Brian's attitudes change for the worse. Jake becomes considerably thinner, irritable, and starts slacking academically. Likewise, Brian starts getting into a lot of fights in the schoolyard, beating up the kids he know he can win fights against. Plus, he hates coming home, and when he does, he spend much of the time locked in his room. It is a good film, too, to teach of the warning signs to parents, teachers, counselors, and so forth (Jake's dad couldn't be suspicious of anything was going on because he wasn't there to witness the changes in his sons). I wish Christopher Collet had been in more movies. He appears again with Haim about six years later or so in the sci-fi movie, Prayer of the Rollerboys.,\n\nA Fish in the Bathtub\n\n5.9\n\n509\n\n3\n\n5\n\nFinal film of Tresa Hughes.,This movie will not appeal to young people who think their grandparents are dinosaurs and their lives don't matter a bit. But, for all those beyond puberty you will enjoy this sweet, sensitive movie about getting old and being married. It moves at a slower pace than a younger audience can handle. The music is from the 40's and sets the tone of the piece as a bevy of excellent older character actors go through the emotions of a long time couple looking back at their lives and wondering if they are happily married after all these years. I think this movie should be required watching for anyone getting married. The children from the family also look at their own lives as they watch what their parents are going through and wonder, should they also be re considering their own situation. I watched this to see some real old pros at work again together and I was not disappointed. I haven't seen Jerry Stiller and Anne Meara (Ben Stiller's parents for those that don't remember them) together in many years. Add in the wonderful Doris Roberts and the then young upcoming actor Mark Ruffalo and you have a nice round cast. If you decide to watch it without high expectations you will have a nice surprise.,\n\nFish and Elephant\n\n5.2\n\n209\n\n5\n\n4\n\nThe literal translation of the title of this movie is: This Summer.

There are lots of great setpiece sequences, like Michael Palin running over Kevin Kline in slow motion. It's the energy that Kline gives to his Oscar-winning role, the way Jamie Lee Curtis double crosses everyone, Michael Palin's stammer, Tom Georgeson's malign mastermind, the clockwork jewel robbery..... but mostly its the mean-spirited selfishness that suffuses every moment of it. It's pretty much unique for British comedy, which always seems to have a soft spot some place for the little fellow. Even the Boultings, at their most vicious, have that normative core , a sense of right and wrong, to grimace dourly at the actions of their petty tyrants. This movie, however, makes no such claim. In fact, Cleese's monologue about the stifling, lifeless way in which the British are terrified of saying the wrong thing the terror of asking about the spouse and being told she left that morning... it's not a comedy of embarrassment. It's a comedy of shamelessness, and pretty much unique. And anyone who talks about 'poor taste' doesn't get it.

Mia: [tenderly] I hate you, too.,Featured in The Rotten Tomatoes Show: Daybreakers/Leap Year/Youth in Revolt (2010),Me & U Performed by Cassie Ventura (as Cassie) featuring Sean 'Diddy' Combs (as Diddy) & Yung Joc Written by Ryan Leslie Published by Aspen Songs Administered by Kobalt Music Publishing Ltd Licensed courtesy of Warner Music UK Ltd,The poet Rumi said, \"A rose's rarest essence lives in the thorn.\" The thorn is in full evidence in Andrea Arnold's compellingly honest second feature Fish Tank, the story of a fifteen year-old girl's struggle for self respect after having \"grown up absurd\" in the London projects. Fish Tank, a film that is overflowing with life, works on many levels – as a look into squalid economic and social conditions in small town Britain, as a warning to those who act impulsively and without self-control, and as a coming-of-age story that allows us to experience a genuine sense of character growth. Winner of the Jury Prize at the 2009 Cannes Film Festival, the film features an astounding performance from first-time actress Katie Jarvis, a 17-year-old who was discovered by the director while having an argument with her boyfriend on an Essex train station platform. Set in a bleak housing project in a working class London suburb, fifteen-year-old Mia is an angry, isolated but vulnerable teen who lives with her boozy mom (Koerston Wareing) and little sister Tyler (an adorable Rebecca Griffiths). Mia has no friends and is dogged by a mean-spirited mother who makes Mo'Nique in Precious look like Mother Teresa. Filled with barely controlled rage, Mia seems uncertain as to whether she is looking for a fight or for sex. She goes from head-butting a rival on the playground to struggling to free a half-starved horse tied up in a junkyard while cozying up to the horse's owner Billy (Harry Treadway), a gentle 19-year-old who seems genuinely interested. Dreaming of becoming a dancer, Mia breaks into an abandoned apartment and practices her hip-hop dance routines alone to borrowed CDs of pop music including California Dreaming, the only time when she can feel good about herself. Mia's first taste of something resembling kindness happens when her mother brings home a sexy, shirtless Irish lover named Connor (Michael Fassbender) who works as a security guard Fassbender's performance oscillates between the charming and the shady and we do not know who is real and who is pretend and where it will lead. Mia has more than a passing interest in him, revealed by her deep glances and facial expressions. When Connor lends Mia his camera to film her dancing in preparation for an audition, she uses it to spy on Connor and her mom making love. One of the loveliest scenes is when Connor carries a drunken Mia from the living room and puts her to bed, gently taking off her clothes while Mia, pretending to be asleep, sneaks an occasional peak and is obviously enjoying the moment. Although Connor's interest in Mia appears innocent, from the time Mia cuts her foot on a family fishing trip and Connor gives her a piggy back ride to the car, tension gradually builds until it explodes in a seduction that is not only inappropriate but has serious consequences. Fish Tank is a strong and unpredictable film because Mia is a strong (though flawed) character who refuses to allow her miserable circumstances to control her life. Arnold uses the fierce slang of the streets, overt sexual encounters, and gritty hand-held camera-work to tell an authentic story of adolescence that in lesser hands might have recycled genre clichés, provided a falsely uplifting message, or offered a sentimentalized view of poverty. That the film opens the door long enough to provide a breath of fresh air once again tells us that life can be governed by what is possible rather than what is reasonable and Fish Tank, instead of becoming another sordid study of pathology, becomes an exhilarating dance of liberation.,\n\nThe Fisher King\n\n7.5\n\n89K\n\n229\n\n102\n\nFor the \"waltzing commuter\" scene in Grand Central station, the main hall of the terminal was shut down for the shoot from 8pm until the first commuter trains arrived at 5:30 am the next morning. Lighting effects outside of the large terminal windows made it seem to be 5:00 in the evening the entire night, and over 400 extras waltzed around the mirror-ball topped Information Booth again and again throughout the night. Now, on New Year's, an orchestra plays there and people waltz for real.,(at around 1 min) When Jack is talking to Parry in the basement, Pinocchio's head (on left) changes position three times each time the scene cuts back to Jack.,Parry: Did you ever hear the story of the Fisher King? Jack Lucas: No. Parry: It begins with the King as a boy, having to spend the night alone in the forest to prove his courage so he can become King. Now while he's spending the night alone he's visited by a sacred vision. Out of the fire appears the Holy Grail, symbol of God's divine grace. And a voice said to the boy, \"You shall be keeper of the Grail so that it may heal the hearts of men.\" But the boy was blinded by greater visions of a life filled with power and glory and beauty. And in this state of radical amazement he felt for a brief moment not like a boy, but invincible, like God, so he reached into the fire to take the Grail, and the Grail vanished, leaving him with his hand in the fire to be terribly wounded. Now as this boy grew older, his wound grew deeper. Until one day, life for him lost its reason. He had no faith in any man, not even himself. He couldn't love or feel loved. He was sick with experience. He began to die. One day a fool wandered into the castle and found the King alone. And being a fool, he was simple minded, he didn't see a King. He only saw a man alone and in pain. And he asked the King, \"What ails you friend?\" The King replied, \"I'm thirsty. I need some water to cool my throat\". So the fool took a cup from beside his bed, filled it with water and handed it to the King. As the King began to drink, he realized his wound was healed. He looked in his hands and there was the Holy Grail, that which he sought all of his life. And he turned to the fool and said with amazement, \"How can you find that which my brightest and bravest could not?\" And the fool replied, \"I don't know. I only knew that you were thirsty.\",Featured in Siskel & Ebert: Dogfight/Late for Dinner/Rambling Rose/Blood & Concrete (1991),How About You? Written by Ralph Freed & Burton Lane Produced by Ray Cooper and George Fenton Whistled & Sung by Harry Nilsson,Terry Gilliam has made a lot of good films and a couple of great ones(namely Twelve Monkeys and Brazil)this, though could well be his best. Why ? For starters there is the cast.Jeff Bridges,officially the most underrated actor of his generation, giving a performance that veers from one end of the spectrum to the other almost imperceptibly.From comedy to tragedy and back again. Robin Williams- a great comedian and a better actor than he is given credit for.Fair enough he does tend to go through spells of making films primarily for his kids (Mrs.Doubtfire, Hook, Jack) but when he does decide to buckle down and do a serious role he rarely disappoints (Good Will Hunting, Insomnia, Dead Poets Society).It is with this role though that Williams gives what is the best of his career to date,as Parry. He is undoubtedly insane, but it is not yet too late for him, he justs needs someone to take the effort to save him, and if it had not been for Bridges colossal mistake and subsequent search for redemption, no-one would have done it, and he would never have survived, merely another casualty of another one of Gilliams nightmarish cityscapes. Mercedes Ruehl is perfect as Bridges suffering girlfriend.She thinks of herself as hard-bitten a survivor, and yet she continues to stay with Bridges, trying to prove to herself that she has the strength to change him, to redeem him. She wants to be his saviour, and yet he comes in the shape of a homeless madman, prone to dancing naked in Central Park and seeing floating fairies whilst defecating.The Fisher King is a movie about hope, despair and redemption, and all of the human conditions that fit in between.It contains one of the most inspired,beautiful scenes in recent memory,as Grand Central station transforms from a dingy,noisy concrete hole into a luscious, gorgeous ballroom, simply because of Lydia, Parrys love, the one thing that keeps him grounded in any semblance of reality.The chinese restaurant double- date in which Parry connects with her for the first time is both funny and touching, and makes what comes after even more tragic. It is at times tragic,brutal even but it's heart cannot be doubted,and it remains a wonderful success.,\n\nFishing Without Nets\n\n6.5\n\n268\n\n4\n\n13\n\nFeatured in History Buffs: Captain Phillips (2018),This is a difficult film. Difficult because it exposes the ugliness of humans. The poverty and depravity of life in Somalia driving ordinary people to piracy. There are no winners in this desperate story. Unlike Captain Phillips, this movie gets under the skin of the pirates and their motivations. It is not pretty. There is no heroism. Just the sad rotten underbelly of \"humanity\". A tough watch and in the end I am not convinced that there is a worthwhile message. Greed is bad? Don't be a pirate? Don't sail anywhere near pirates. A long and tough watch but certainly very real. Entertainment? I would not say so. If you want to be depressed and get an insight into Somali piracy, then give it a go.,\n\nFist Fight\n\n5.6\n\n45K\n\n175\n\n124\n\nAccording to Ice Cube, the actual fight sequence took 8 days to shoot.,After revealing the \"drawing\" on the left side of the chalkboard, the board then shows writing in purple, then back to the drawing later in the day.

In 1978 the film was withdrawn by BBFC director James Ferman (together with Enter the Dragon (1973)) and all nunchaku footage removed together with the previously mentioned throat kick, and these cuts, (totalling 2 mins 51 secs) would persist in all of the film's UK video releases. The cuts were fully restored for the 2001 Hong Kong Legends release.,Edited into Game of Death (1978),Atmospheres Written by György Ligeti Performed by Das Orchester des Südwestfunks Baden-Baden Courtesy of MGM Records Brief excerpt, played twice, during dramatic death scenes,I first saw this in the late 80s on a vhs. Then again in the early 2k on a dvd which I own. Revisited it recently. This one has terrific fight sequences n much better ones than The Big Boss n Way of the Dragon. This one starts off slow but the last half an hour has all the best fights back to back. The fight in the Japanese garden stayed with me since i was a kid. The juxtaposition of the serene n soothing garden n the violent kicks n punches between Lee n the Russian fighter is amazingly shot. The plot - Chen Zhen (Lee) returns to his village in the hope of marrying his sweetheart but is devastated upon knowing that his teacher has passed away. Chen Zhen controls himself in-spite of encountering various insults towards his teacher by the Japanese students inside his Alma mater but later he winds up fighting the Japanese students, defeating all of them, including their sensei, single-handedly inside the Japanese dojo. Later other Japanese students retaliate by attacking Chen Zhen's Alma mater on their boss' (Suzuki) orders. Chen Zhen tries to lay low but gets very furious after discovering that his teacher was poisoned by Suzuki, the boss of the Japanese dojo. We have Ying-Chieh Han (the guy who played the main villain/big boss in The Big Boss). He is in a very small role of that of a steward known as Feng. When the Japanese mob/police shoots in the end at Bruce Lee's character while he leaps forward, won't the bullets hit few people who are behind Lee's character?,\n\nFist of Legend\n\n7.5\n\n25K\n\n131\n\n63\n\nJet Li plays Chen Zhen in this movie, a student of master Huo Yuanjia.

Really great. Jet Li plays Chen Zhen, a character played by Bruce Lee in \"Chinese Connection\", and he does it perfect. Bruce Lee's Chen is a character filled with anger, hate and wish for revenge. Jet Li's Chen is much different. He is cold blooded, there is no anger in him. The difference between Jet Li and Bruce Lee is the same as the difference between \"Fist of Legend\" and \"Chinese Connection\". Bruce Lee's character hates Japan and everything Japanese. Jet Li's Chen wishes his revenge but he respects Japanese culture and there isn't hate. If \"Chinese Connection\" is a movie of the hate and the anger, \"Fist of Legend\" is a movie of the peace and the respect.,\n\nFist of the North Star\n\n3.9\n\n3.5K\n\n74\n\n32\n\nGary Daniels enjoyed his role so much in this film that he named one of his sons Kenshiro.,In the final battle between Kenshiro and Shin towards the ending you can see a hole in Kenshiro's pants between the legs presumably due to the high kicks.,Jackal: Welcome to the future.,Featured in The Cine-Masochist: STEEL DAWN (2013),A Thousand Lies Written by Robb Flynn, Logan Mader, Adam Duce & Chris Kontos Performed by Machine Head Courtesy of Roadrunner Records, Inc.,Satisfying only in an uncut video version, this outlandish martial arts costume piece relies strictly on lots of spraying blood, loud screaming and tensed muscles to makes it's inevitable point.

Additionally, alternate takes for the underwear-shooting-off scene, spitting sequence and removing the bullet entry wound gag are all used.,Featured in The Hour: Episode #7.34 (2010),Edgar Wright's directorial debut is a no-budget western comedy that's crafted purely out of passion by the then-new filmmaker and makes for a decent parody of spaghetti westerns. A Fistful of Fingers is goofy, dorky & untidy, and is too amateurish an effort to be considered a proper debut feature. Also written by Wright, this 78 mins story with zero production values & irreverent humour is devoid of all the charm, wit or energy that are now best associated with his works and lacks even an attempt from him to carve out his original style & trademarks. Instead, the film feels more like a hobby pursued in spare time. While there are amusing bits & clever comedic touches every now n then, much of it is a tad too silly & campy to be enjoyed wholeheartedly. Wright spoofs the genre with nothing held back but has no idea when n where to pull the brakes & gets carried away too often, thus leading to several good scenes getting undone by being overdone. Overall, A Fistful of Fingers has all the qualities of a student film shot on a shoestring budget and absolutely none of the stylistic flourishes that now defines an Edgar Wright presentation. It is funny in small doses and its over-the-top ridiculousness also works but it lacks restraint. Fans of the filmmaker may find it enjoyable to an extent but one isn't missing out much if they skip it.,\n\nFists in the Pocket\n\n7.6\n\n4.7K\n\n17\n\n50\n\nThe house, the film's main location, is the house director Marco Bellocchio spent his childhood days in.,When the whole family is having dinner, Augusto is seated at one corner of the table and the mother is sitting on a side at the other corner.

Once he removes the cat, the next camera angle again shows Augusto and the mother at opposite ends.,Alessandro: I'm a volcano of ideas.,Edited into Sorelle (2006),The family in Marco Bellocchio's startling debut \"Fists in the Pocket\" make the Femms of \"The Old Dark House\" seem normal. These indolent Italians laze around all day taunting each other at every opportunity while son Allessandro, (a truly terrific Lou Castel), contemplates the best ways to rid himself of the others, including his blind mother, for the sake of the one brother he cares about. This darkly funny satire wasn't like other Italian films of the time, taking an almost putrid look at the family values Italians hold most dear; a comedy about matricide, fratricide and possible incest that actually manages to be quite touching at times. It's also a movie that takes its time. For a director making only his first feature, Bellocchio bravely put narraitve on the back-burner opting instead for an atmosphere as lazy as his characters and killing off a number of sacred cows in the process. The Establishment hated it while young critics loved it though not enough to make it anything other than a cult movie and it's seldom revived. Perhaps its reputation outweighs its numerous qualities but however you look at it, it's a one-off and well worth seeing.,\n\nFists of Fury\n\n4.3\n\n31\n\n1\n\n4\n\nBy the ancient tradition of Full Moon, action-host Cynthia Rothrock presents you a ton of eei!

Those films were earlier in her career. In this film she plays Nie Bing, a successful TV host in China. She is not lucky in love and after a night of drinking on her 29th birthday, an angel comes to her (no wings, its a kind of scruffy guy), who tells her she will meet 12 guys over the next year. The film goes through her time with the men, with various things happening, various disappointments etc. Karena Lam is so irresistibly pretty in this. Her smile just makes her so attractive, and that is probably why she was chosen. While the film is not great, I found it worth watching and my attention didn't wander. If you like romantic comedies you'll like this. This is the kind of film Jennifer Anniston could have done 10 years ago, but I doubt she'd carry the film like Ms. Lam. \"Koma\" and \"July Rhapsody\" were better, but they are not comedies. Again, if you like romantic comedies, you can certainly do worse.,\n\nFitoor\n\n5.7\n\n215\n\nnull\n\nnull\n\nnull\n\nThe Fits\n\n5.1\n\n1.2K\n\n12\n\n2\n\nNot to be mistaken for A Cinderella Story If The Shoe Fits with Sofia Carson.,Referenced in S.I.D.A., síndrome de muerte (1993),Roch Salvitore Written by José Souc,This movie, although obviously low in budget and made for T.V, is sweet and entertaining.

Rob Lowe also is a plus to this film, and even though Jennifer Grey had already lost her Dirty Dancing teenage gawkiness, you still like her and hate the \"ugly sisters\". It has a happy ending and an enjoyable plot line, although intensely impossible in many parts, like the rapid changing scenes.

Indigenous Amahuaca launched a hit-and-run raid on the film camp. One man survived an arrow through his throat. His wife was hit in the stomach, necessitating eight hours of emergency surgery on a kitchen table. According to Werner Herzog, \"I assisted by illuminating her abdominal cavity with a torchlight, and with my other hand sprayed with repellent the clouds of mosquitoes that swarmed around the blood.\" Herzog decided against a revenge attack, believing it would be bad for relations.,During one of boat drifting scene, crew members are visible at the top of the boat, including a man in jeans who tries to avoid the camera.,Brian Sweeney Fitzgerald - 'Fitzcarraldo': How can anyone learn patriotism from a school book?

He first tried building a Trans-Andean Railroad, but went bankrupt. When we meet him, he's trying to make a living by selling ice to Amazonia natives, although we first see him on a small boat with his sometimes significant other, Molly (Claudia Cardinale). They've traveled 1200 miles down the Amazon to an opera house to hear Enrico Caruso sing, because Fitzcarraldo is an opera fanatic who especially loves Caruso. He loves opera so much that he dreams of building an opera house in the relatively remote outpost of Iquitos, Peru, where he's been living. Understandably unable to find backers for such a venture among Iquitos' wealthy rubber industry leaders, Fitzcarraldo hits upon a scheme for making a bundle of money, and which would eventually enable him to fund the opera house himself. Unfortunately, not all goes as planned. Fitzcarraldo was a notoriously difficult film to make. Documentarian Les Blank even made his own film detailing some of the difficulties and apparent ironies, The Burden of Dreams (1982). Director Werner Herzog hauled his cast and crew to Amazonia for the shoot, where they ended up trapped in the rain forest for months. At one point the filmmakers' camp was set fire by Indians who objected to the production, there was an air crash in which some of the crew died, and a couple outrageous \"stunts\" in the film--including the main plot device of the climax--actually were outrageous, dangerous tasks rather than safe effects/model shots, as we'd expect them to be. Just the idea of pulling off the main stunt caused the Brazilian engineer initially associated with the project to abandon involvement. A number of cast members also backed out, including Mick Jagger and Jason Robards, who were both signed on at different points to play Kinski's role. Knowledge of these kinds of issues makes Fitzcarraldo even more fun to watch, and makes the fact that it was completed at all, not to mention that it is such an elegant masterpiece, more remarkable. The tone of Fitzcarraldo overall closely matches Kinski's depiction of titular character. It is quirky and surreal, but very subtly yet satisfyingly so, with both an almost garish bizarreness (Kinski is quite odd looking in a way) balanced with a sublime beauty. Herzog imbues the film with a lot of gorgeous cinematography, enhanced by his unique sense of pacing. For example, he'll set the mood of a dawn/dusk scene with a lingering shot of a colorful sky, which then functions as symbolic of a night's events without directly showing them. Herzog matches this same technique in his action--he has an ability to say as much with what he doesn't show his actors doing (or saying) as with more conspicuous content. Herzog also shows himself to be a master of selecting music to enhance mood and tell a story, as he balances an atmospheric Brian Eno-ish score from Popol Vuh, native jungle music, and vintage turn or the century recordings of Caruso singing Bellini, Verdi, Puccini and such. Of course opera is an important plot device that enters the film at various critical points. Even if you don't like opera, however, Herzog and Kinski make it (and the motivation for it) attractive in context, and you may just find this film beginning to turn around your feelings for that music. It's interesting to note that even with Herzog's unusual pacing, the flow of the film always seems \"natural\". Fitzcarraldo also has an unusual plot structure, as it almost stream-of-consciously moves from opera in a formal European-seeming setting to a historical dramatic depiction of eccentrics in a native-filled Peruvian town, and then to an exciting adventure tale that is the heart of the film before it finally reaches an irony-filled, beautifully surreal dénouement. The constant throughout all of this is Fitzcarraldo, of course, who can't help being eccentric but charming, both to the film's audience and to other characters. Fitzcarraldo is often interpreted as being somewhat critical of western encroachment on other cultures, such as Amazonia. Under this view, Herzog is usually seen as ironically \"guilty\" of the same actions that he's indicting. However, the film does not read as criticism to me. It's much more in line with what is usually considered to be a romantic tendency in Herzog. Fitzcarraldo is not at all a villain in the film, and neither are the European rubber barons. Instead, Fitzcarraldo is lovable and admirable if a bit crazy. The introduction of western culture doesn't end up being a negative. The natives in the film still retain their unique identities, and efforts are made to interact with them in their manner, not to adapt them to Eurocentrism. Cultural change may be inevitable with interaction, but the message of Fitzcarraldo is more that the interaction can produce unique, worthwhile cultures that are amalgamations of their precursors. Another interesting subtext is that of Fitzcarraldo as Orpheus. Just as Orpheus enchanted wild beasts, trees and rocks on Mount Olympus with his lyre, causing them to \"move from their places\", Fitzcarraldo uses opera to enchant the natural world in which he is ensconced, eventually \"moving mountains\".,\n\nFitzwilly\n\n6.6\n\n1.9K\n\n35\n\n18\n\nThe copy machine Juliet wants to return is a Xerox 813, the world's first \"desktop\" plain paper copier.

Fitzwilliam: Old family, new first name.,Make Me Rainbows Lyrics by Marilyn Bergman and Alan Bergman Music by John Williams (as Johnny Williams) [Played in the prelude to Fitzwilly and Juliet's date; reprise played over the end card and credits],First, let me just point out to one reviewer (bop pop, or something like that) that Fitzwilly is NOT a Disney film, so if you find it immoral, well, don't blame them. Secondly, it IS just a movie, and considering some of the horrible junk that has been brought out by Hollywood over the years- some of which was intended for children, some not- it's hard to even think of this charming, little film as immoral, disgusting or anything else. I initially sought out this movie- and bought it before seeing it- simply because I'm a huge \"Get Smart\" fan, and therefore, adore Barbara Feldon. I've read a few of the male reviewers saying they had big crushes on her. I didn't get to witness this miracle comedy until my late teens during the early 90s when Nick @ Nite began showing it, but as a young woman, Barbara Feldon became an iconic role model to me- and to many others I know. After viewing this movie, I was thankfully not disappointed, which sometimes can happen when you watch or buy a film simply because someone you like from another show is in it. Dick Van Dyke and Barbara Feldon had wonderful chemistry. There were also quite a few supporting roles played by sometimes veteran character actors and some just starting out (including a very young Sam Waterston- before his incredible \"Law & Order\" days). The humor was witty and sweet, and the premise was (and I think most people should know this) not to be taken seriously. I think we all know it's wrong to steal or to lie or to break the law, but there are quite a few films that create heroes out of anti-heroes and most people aren't complaining about them. (For instances here are a few I pulled off the top of my head- \"Chicago\", where the main characters are murderers, dishonest lawyers and bribe taking wardens; \"Thelma & Louise\", where two women start out on a fun trip, but through unfortunate circumstances, become outlaws on the run; and even \"Pirates of the Caribbean\", where the audience is rooting for Jack Sparrow, a fun-loving guy with a good heart, but who is, after all, still a pirate.) Some have said this is a children's movie. I certainly think it's safe for a child to watch it, but sometimes the subtle humor might go over their heads. I think it's just a fun, lovely movie, with wonderful actors, having a good laugh, and creating an enjoyable couple of hours.,\n\nFive Came Back\n\n8.2\n\n5.1K\n\n20\n\n15\n\nThe 'Five' refers to John Huston, John Ford, Frank Capra, William Wyler and George Stevens.,Edited into Syndrome K (2021),During World War 2 several movie directors joined the US armed forces, making documentary films of the war. These included five of the greatest directors, not just of that era, but of all time: Frank Capra, John Ford, John Huston, William Wyler and George Stevens. They had a great impact on the war, and the war had an impact on them, not only during the conflict but in their subsequent cinematic careers. Superb documentary series. The five directors covered in the series are legends of cinema. By the ends of their careers they would, between them, win 14 Oscars and be nominated 50 times (Capra 2 wins, 6 nominations, Ford 4/6, Huston 2/15, Wyler 3/14, Stevens 3/9). Between then they would ultimately direct six Best Picture Oscar winners (It Happened One Night, You Can't Take It With You, How Green Was My Valley, Mrs. Miniver, The Best Years Of Our Lives, Ben Hur). However, from 1942 to 1945 most of their time was spent helping the war effort, directing some brilliant, relevant and inspiring documentaries. These were not shot from behind a desk but out in the thick of it - Ford was wounded at the Battle of Midway, a cameraman of Wyler's was killed in aerial combat while filming The Memphis Belle and Wyler himself lost his hearing while filming the film Thunderbolt. This documentary series shows well how the five of them contributed, often having to fight and manipulate their own War Department to have their films released, or, at least, not tampered with. The personal sacrifices, mentioned previously are also well documented. Most emotionally, the effects of the war on the five of them are examined. They all came back changed men, including in their movie-making styles and careers. The interviews with five present-day directors - Francis Ford Coppola, Steven Spielberg, Paul Greengrass, Guillermo Del Toro and Laurence Kasdan - help frame the contributions of the five and translate their work for us to understand. Good narration by Meryl Streep, adding the right amount of gravitas to proceedings. Great documentary on five extraordinary film-makers. Makes for emotional watching for any lover of the silver screen.,\n\nFive Corners\n\n6.1\n\n3.8K\n\n38\n\n21\n\nProducer Tony Bill got involved with this project after some actors he was auditioning for another film began using scenes from the plays of John Patrick Shanley.

In a troubled Bronx neighborhood in the 1960s, Jodie Foster is a young woman hounded by just-released convict John Turturro, while Tim Robbins is a former classmate reevaluating his priorities based on turbulent world events. Foster has little to work with in a weakly-written role (she's not going to meet this nutcase in the park at night!), but Robbins' quiet sincerity is lovely, and his handsome face and expressive manner keeps the film grounded in reality. Overall, it's much too flighty, with a melodramatic final 30 minutes which doesn't do anything good for anybody--least of all the viewer. However, there is some dryly eccentric humor in Shanley's screenplay, and when director Bill's touch is light the film generally works. **1/2 from ****,\n\nThe Five Days\n\n5.9\n\n677\n\n6\n\n9\n\nThe façade of Milan Cathedral is shown with today's appearance, but it was not finished in 1848.,Featured in The Power of Perception (2017),It's admirable to see Dario Argento direct something this unexpected at this early stage in his career, as this is a historical dramedy, and though it can be violent, it's far from a traditional horror movie. I was on board with it for the first few scenes, kind of liking the odd tone and the unique way it was handling a story within a recounting of events that, to some extent, actually happened... ...But it gets less engaging as it goes along, and its two-hour runtime felt a good deal longer to me. It makes it probably for the best that Argento returned to the horror genre and kept at it, developing his signature style further and then arguably peaking in the late 1970s/early 1980s. This is a strange and somewhat interesting detour within his filmography, but I wish it had been either a bit less repetitive or a good deal shorter, because it's very one-note for something that runs as long as it does. And not that two hours is always long for a movie, of course - it's just here, you feel that two hours more than in many other films of a comparable length.,\n\nFive Deadly Venoms\n\n7\n\n7.7K\n\n71\n\n62\n\nRanked #11 in Entertainment Weekly's \"Top 50 Cult Films of All-Time.\",Near the end of the film when the Lizard, the Scorpion, the Snake, the Centipede and the Teacher's sixth and final pupil confront each other at the Snake's mansion, the Lizard calls the Centipede \"Number 5\". The Centipede was actually \"Number 1\" and was referred to as such throughout the rest of the film and the Toad was actually \"Number 5\" and was also referred to as such throughout the rest of the film. This is undoubtedly an error in the English dubbing, not in the original Mandarin dialogue.,Yang Tieh: Poison Clan rocks the world!,Featured in Chop Socky: Cinema Hong Kong (2003),There's no romance or other side plot to this movie, it's action and intrigue all the way, making it a real man's kung-fu movie. An aging master dispatches his last disciple Yan Tieh to stop his five former pupils who's styles represents five venomous animals centipede,snake, scorpion, lizard and the toad. Despite the word \"Venom\" in the title, none of these pupil uses venoms to kill their opponents. Yan Tieh told by his teacher that he's no match for the five former pupil, must find one he can form an alliance with to defeat the other four. How Yan Tieh and the others find each other is the intrigue to the story, with good kung-fu action spread out throughout the story. Recognized as a cult classic, this movie has already established itself in the annals of kung- fu action movies. It's known well enough that other movies make reference to the five styles depicted in this story. It's no artistic masterpiece, with the usual bad dubbing, and corny acting, but the movie is one of the best of its kind, because its so focused on the all the ingredients of kung-fu action movie of its time, and gives an extra concentrated dose of them. One movie you must watch if you are a kung-fu movie fan.,\n\nFive Easy Pieces\n\n7.4\n\n40K\n\n256\n\n111\n\n\"Five Easy Pieces\" refers to a book of piano lessons for beginners.,When Bobby plays the piano for Catherine about three quarters through the movie, the music in front of him is clearly not what he is playing (Chopin's \"Prelude in E Minor\").

He reveals that the song was memorized when he later says \"I picked the easiest piece I could think of\".,Bobby: I'd like a plain omelette, no potatoes, tomatoes instead, a cup of coffee and wheat toast.

Waitress: Well, I'll come back when you make up your mind,Featured in America at the Movies (1976),Stand by Your Man Written by Billy Sherrill (as B. Sherril) & Tammy Wynette (as T. Wynette) Performed by Tammy Wynette [Played over the opening titles],This film is a classic because it operates and works on every level imaginable, a truly evocative film. Other posters have elucidated upon and discussed the musicology of it, and the significance of Chopin. I'll take their word for it, and not go there. That's out of my league. And, as others have noted, the film is an exploration and study of character, which it certainly is. All that and more. I see the film as being in its own way a period piece unto itself, the period being films made in the late 60s and early 70s. It is quintessentially representative of what was an important movie circa 1970. Of course the storyline of an alienated young man (Jack Nicholson as Robert Dupea), walking away from all that is expected of him, and indeed walking away --if not running away-- from his prodigious gifts, and doing it all with a cocky attitude, no longer resonates quite the way it did in 1970. But, if you weren't around in 1970, trust me, it resonated well then. It was a theme that seemed important and meaningful at the time, even though the character's motivations for his actions are never really explained and remain something of a blank slate for the viewer to fill in. In 1970, when the concept of an \"identity crises\" was big, it worked to just suggest and imply that Dupea felt the need to Quixotically search out and determine for himself what was important for him. That dovetailed with another important component in many movies of that era --you never explain yourself, because if you explain things, you trivialize it all and ruin it. Or, as Jenny, Ali McGraw's character in Love Story (also a 1970 film) put it, \"Love means never having to say you're sorry.\" Meanwhile, unfolding alongside the Dupea character, was Karen Black's tour de force performance as the big-haired clingy-dependent waitress girlfriend, Rayette, and doing it to a medley of apropos Tammy Wynette tunes. Karen Black's performance perfectly captured and spot-on nailed an almost ubiquitous sort of woman prevalent in that era, when the social changes wrought by the women's movement had not yet taken fruit. As for the notorious diner scene, this one scene essentially dominates the whole movie. It is something that people who have seen the movie will bring up and talk about, even decades later. Yet the scene is in no way pivotal or important to the story. At most it once and for all permanently affixes in the viewers' minds that Dupea was an impulsively flippant and angry person, not one to meekly abide any of life's minor frustrations. But we were already getting that picture of him before this scene happens. And, courtesy of Dupea, the scene provides a snippet of gratuitous social commentary about inflexibility and the stupidity of mindless adherence to meaningless rules. Something for the viewers to cheer and say, \"I can relate to that!\" Those things aside, to me the real value of the scene was that it provided an entertaining contrast in a bleak drama, a needed change of pace. But regardless of whether it was a statement about Dupea's attitude, or a social comment about stupid rules, or a needed amusing interlude, no matter which of those it is, its lasting impression renders its importance out of proportion to the movie as a whole. Surely, as he made this film, director Bob Rafelson's never intended that 35 years later this particular scene be the main thing viewers took away and remembered about the film. In this sense, as entertaining as it is, the scene therefore must be viewed as being a bit of a story-telling flaw. In retrospect, it should have been toned down just a skosh. But, then, on the other hand, were it not for this scene, perhaps the film would hardly be remembered at all. It is already a largely overlooked masterpiece. This movie pops up on the movie channels on a semi-regular basis, and when it does I always stop and am riveted. The cinematography is superb. The acting is superb. Nicholson turning in one of the performances from that era that made him the unhinged star in the first place, long before he became a parody of himself. But be warned, it is not a \"happy\" film. It is the product of an era that did not as a rule produce happy films. But it is nevertheless a film that must be seen.,\n\nFive Elements Ninjas\n\n7.2\n\n3.1K\n\n36\n\n20\n\nThe broadcast version of the film edits the scene where the heroes rip the lead villain in half, making it look as if he is still in one piece, as well as an extra scene involving Tien-Hao and Shi Sheng speaking after the master's plan is discussed is deleted.,Featured in Films of Fury: The Kung Fu Movie Movie (2011),Vision of Fear (uncredited) Written by Edward Michael Published by De Wolfe Music Ltd.,Cheh had a long and colorful career as one of the top directors at the Shaw studio but by 1982 his stock had fallen as trends moved away from the period costume kung fu action films he was so fond of. While fellow kung fu film director, Liu Chia Liang was still able to pull off hits, Cheh was perhaps getting too quirky and obvious with his favorite themes of heroic men in revealing outfits, gruesome fights and few if no women in the story. A few films followed in this year with one released the next, but none rival Five Element Ninjas. Cheh was out of the Shaw studio by 1983 and working in low budget Taiwanese cinema he never was able to achieve anything remotely near his past successes. This is his swan song at the Shaw studios, The plot is absolutely silly and full of absurdities even for your average Chinese made Ninja film. It's as if Cheh saw the competition and said, \"Oh yeah? Well watch this!\". Except for Venom star Lo Meng, the cast is composed of Shaw second stringers but that doesn't mean the action is anything less then excellent. This film has the best fight scenes in a Cheh film since \"The Crippled Avengers\" of 1979. Everyone is fighting with weapons in mass fight scenes that are incredibly choreographed. Unfortunately, many production credits are not translated and I don't know who was the genius behind the fight scenes. Lo Meng is the only one doing open hand fighting and he fights a samurai in the first extended fight scene! Granted the samurai sword skills on display are from outer space but it goes with the absurd nature of the entire movie. So much of this film is wacky that it's a waste of your time to recount it. It's as if everything you'd expect from a late Cheh film (good and bad) was turned up to \"11\" including the pace. Bloody and nuts. Just the way a good Cheh film should be.

Many artist in those days were subjected to unfair treatment by the mainstream record labels in those days. Here are a few examples: 1. Frankie Lyman and The Teenagers were a group that was comprised of numerous ethnicities. One member of the group who Chris Montes (who was latino), was cut from the group by the label's producer because he was too ethnic. Chris Montes did later go on to record a few hits of his own such \"Do You Want To Dance\". 2. American Bandstand which first in 1952 played mostly Rock and Roll which, was pioneered and played by mostly black artist. However, it wasn't until 1957 that Johnny Nash, Jackie Wilson, and other African American singers performed on the show. 3. The Temptations, The Four Tops, The Dells, and many other such groups were restricted to playing all black venues during the 50's and early 60's in the south. This gave rise to would later become know as \"The Chitterling Circuit\", as the venues were mostly nightclubs, and juke-joints. These artist received harrassment from local law enforcement agencies, and townspeople on a regular basis whenever they came to the highly segregated south. As far the scene where the record company brings a white group called The Four Horsemen, that's not really a stretch. Most of the time what would happen is that a black group would write or even release a song to the black audience, while the record company would have that same song \"covered\" by a white group to be released to the \"mainstream\" audience. The covered version of these songs were the ones that normally got air play from disc jockeys. The best example I can give of that is the 1955 hit by The Platters \"Only You (And You Alone)\". This song was released on Mercury Records, while one of their subsidiary labels Dot Records released a covered version of the same song by a group called The Hilltopper's who hailed from Western Kentucky College (all white school...segregation you know.) The Hilltopper's version of Only You hit number eight on the pop charts six weeks after the release of the Platters version. The Platters version however reached number on the R&B charts, and crossed over to the pop charts were it number five. A few months later in 1956 The Platters hit #1 on the pop charts with The Great Pretender, which was covered by Stan Freberg in the same year without the same success. All of that is to say that the movie has its facts straight about what black artist went through in those days, but it's about much more than that. It's about the rise, fall, and resurrection of a talented group, and the proof that love and friendship can withstand all of life's ups and downs.,Looking for something different to add to your Watchlist?

The Italian Cop and Gangster Films That Ruled the '70s (2012),Spaghetti/War film about a misfit team led by Gianni Garco who carry out a suicide mission behind enemy lines . A group of two-fisted soldiers formed by five experts are drafted to go on a near-suicide mission and attempt to take plans from a Nazi staff . ¨ Five for the Hell¨ is an entertaining film with Gianni Garco as tough officer along with the ordinary team of renegade soldiers of World War II whose mission is to steal the Nazi's secret attack plans -the Plan K on the Gustav Line- from a villa . Garco training a group of rebel and eclectic soldiers for a dangerous assault on a palace-château. In the hands of hardboiled director Gianfranco Parolini , alias Frank Kramer and a tough-as-leather cast , that's all the plot that's needed to make one rip-roaring wartime flick. Garco's mission is two-fold and in violent and cynical style : first turn his G.I.s into a valiant fighting unit and then turn them loose on a German villa located in Italia where they run into a brutal Nazi commander (Klaus Kinski) and being helped by a double agent (Margaret Lee). The diverse characters include a fun-loving Nick Jordan as acrobat , Sanson Burke as hunk man , Salvatore Borghese as safe-cracker , and Luciano Rossi as a lame-brained soldier specialist in explosives . The first half of the film allows the colorful cast of character actors to have their fun as they get their tails whipped into shape and develop shaky relationship with their leader . The final part is all action, as the brave commando wreak havoc and then run for their lives. Despite the fact that few of the \"heroes\" survive the bloodbath, the message here isn't that war is hell. Rather, it seems to be: war can be a hell of a good time... if you've got nothing to lose . The relentless assignment is set against strong training, risked adventures and hazardous feats . The dangerous mission includes a selected group formed by a motley and varied squadron played by usual of Italian B-series .This is a rugged WWII actioner concerning about an experienced officer , he's assigned by Military staff to train a dropout group of valiant G.I.s who get a chance to redeem themselves . They are a squadron of dispensable characters with no past and no future . Garco reprieves a bunch of soldiers , forges them into a two-fisted fighting unit and leads them on a deadly assignment into Nazi territory . The Privates are oddballs , rag-tag and undisciplined gang , under command a stiff Lieutenant and the team is hardly trained . In this film Garco and his motley band , are suppose to steal a plans located in a fortress where resides various Nazi officers . At the end they must participate in the suicidal mission behind the enemy lines , to wipe the German group by means of a violent assault over a strongly protected position . Gianni Garco as Lt. Hoffman assumes the character of commando leader in this ordinary wartime movie regularly directed by Gianfranco Parolini. This moving film packs frantic thrills, perilous adventures , comedy , relentless feats , and buck-loads of explosive action and violence. The noisy action is uniformly well-made, especially deserving of mention the rip-roaring final scenes on the fortress , including some spectacular shootouts and bombing . Apart from the values of team spirit , cudgeled by Garco into his rebel group , the film is full of feats , suspense , and thrills . Rough Gianni Garco or Gary Hudson is good as leader of the motley pack together thwart the Nazi schemes, as well as the largely secondary cast with special mention to Salvatore Borghese , a habitual comic secondary in multiple Italian films . Atmospheric and functional musical score by Mancuso and mediocre cinematography in Eastmancolor filmed by Sandro Mancori . This is a wartime typical vehicle and into the ¨warlike commando genre¨ , in USA style which also belong the American classics as : ¨Dirty Dozen (Robert Aldrich) ¨ Where eagles dare(Brian G. Hutton) and Kelly's heroes(Hutton ), Tobruk (Arthur Hiller), Devil's Brigade (Andrew V McLagen) and many others . The film is middling directed by Gianfranco Parolini or Frank Kramer. He began directing muscle-men epics as ¨Rocha¨, ¨The Macabeos¨ with Brad Harris and ¨The ten gladiators¨ with Dan Davis and Gianni Rizzo , Parolini's usual actor. After that he continued with ¨commissioner X¨ series with Tony Kendall , fantastic with ¨three supermen¨ and warlike movie as ¨5 per l'Inferno¨ with Gianni Garco (Sartana) and Nick Jordan. His first Western was ¨Johnny West¨ and later on , he directed the ¨Sabata trilogy¨ . It's followed by ¨ Return of Sabata¨ with similar artistic as Lee Van Cleff and Nick Jordan and customary technician team and finally ¨Indio Black ¨ with Yul Brynner .

But the pace is good, sometimes it's funny and the action was good. But it has all been done before and in better films. So it's not rubbish, but it's not good either. I recommend you wait until it's released on DVD and hope that Knight and day will be better.,\n\nFive Miles to Midnight\n\n7.7\n\n257\n\n3\n\n2\n\nIn one of the scenes with Brett, Daniel mentions \"that's in Donald O'Connor's movies\".

In some scenes it has a border and in others it doesn't.,Alistair Little: [talking to TV camera] For me to talk about the man I have become, you need to know about the man I was. I was 14 when I joined the Tartan gangs and I was 15 when I joined the UVF. At that time, don't forget, there were riots on the streets every week; petrol bombs everyday, and that was just in our town. When you got home and switched on the TV, you could see what was happening in every other town as well, and it was like we were under siege. Fathers and brothers and friends were being killed in the streets, and the feeling was, we all have to do somethin'. We're all in this together and we all have to do somethin'. Alistair Little: The thing you have to remember, what you have to understand, is the mindset. Once you have signed up to terror, and joined the organization - the group - your mind closes right down. It becomes only *our* story that matters, not their story - the Catholics. It's only *my* people that are being killed, and here suffering and that need looking after. Catholics being killed? Doesn't enter your head. And so when I went up to Sammy, our local commander, and told him I wanted to kill a Catholic man, it wasn't a wrong thing for me to do. In my head, it was the proper, the just, the fair, the good thing to do. And so, it was easy.,Featured in WatchMojo: Top 10 Liam Neeson Performances (2012),A Glass of Champagne Written by Georg Kajanus Performed by Sailor Courtesy of Sony BMG Records Under license by Sashay Music & Warner Chappell Music Publishing,Five Minutes of Heaven (2009) I have a confession--when the movie started I thought, okay, another pro-IRA movie with a heart. And it's not--it's a beautifully balanced movie about the personal horrors of the Northern Ireland bloodshed and the longterm aftermath as participants struggle to keep going. The two main actors are both from Northern Ireland. Liam Neeson plays a Protestant who as a teenage killed a Catholic worker as part of the tit-for-tat violence of the time. James Nesbitt, a Roman Catholic, plays the brother of the man who was killed, and as a witness to the crime he holds a deep grudge about the murder. And in a key act of political insight, the actors were born on the opposite sides--Neeson was raised Catholic and Nesbitt raised Protestant. The theme of the film is reconciliation in the mold of South African leader Nelson Mandela. The core of the movie is shot in a fancy Irish mansion where television crews are going to watch as the two men, mortal enemies decades before, make an effort to somehow move on, in public, on t.v. How it goes is for you to see. The murder in the 1970s is fact, easy enough to believe, and the meeting of the men is fiction. Nesbitt is utterly terrific. You might think he's overacting (he is, of course, overacting) but it's appropriate, and gives this non-action film some intensity. Neeson is strong in his restraint and in the one main scene where he gives a well-written speech about how to understand these horrors he is also terrific. The filming is extremely simple and in fact the whole scenario is relatively linear, even with all the flashbacks. There are some turns to the events by the last half hour, and in a way this is both the dramatic high and the disappointing low of the film (it resorts to somewhat corny and not quite smartly filmed sequences I won't elaborate). But overall the point is so strong and well meant it's hard to worry too much about whether it's a masterpiece. It's not. It's sometimes slow, it says stuff we probably have absorbed pretty well by now, and it isn't very complex. But what it does do it does with compassion and conviction.,\n\nFive Minutes to Tomorrow\n\n5.7\n\n154\n\n3\n\n2\n\nI was drawn to the movie by the flashy names of the director, the cast and the intriguing story line. However the film failed miserably to convey the intricacies between the characters. The plots randomly plucked out of the original novels are disjointed and disconcerting. It lacks a natural flow.
