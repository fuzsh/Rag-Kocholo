        "text": ".\n\nDirector: Roger Corman\n\nScreenwriters: Lou Rusoff / Lou Rusoff, Charles B. Griffith (uncredited)\n\nBy Roderick Heath\n\nIn memoriam: Roger Corman 1926-2024\n\nI started writing this to give more appreciation to Corman before it was too late; then, mid-writing, it was too late. In any event, this is the first of a two-part look at some of my favourite Corman films of his pre-1960 phase.\n\nThe first five years of Roger Corman’s directing career saw him direct twenty-five feature films, a frenzy of creative zeal mixed with mercenary cool practically without comparison for productivity or richness in the history of cinema. In 1960 Corman released two movies that garnered him a sudden upswing in attention and respect, if not exactly respectability: The Little Shop of Horrors, a movie that was, like most of the films he had made up until then, incredibly cheap and filmed quickly in black-and-white, and House of Usher, a lush colour horror movie made on a comparatively munificent budget. The Little Shop of Horrors played at the Cannes Film Festival, and House of Usher kicked off a series of films adapted from Edgar Allan Poe and H.P. Lovecraft that remain, today, his best-known and most-loved works. It’s comparatively easy to celebrate Corman as a director for his later work – other entries in the Poe-Lovecraft series, also including Pit and the Pendulum (1961), The Haunted Palace (1963), and The Masque of the Red Death (1964), his variably mythic and surreal counterculture exploitation excursions like The Wild Angels (1966), The Trip (1967), and Gas, or, How It Was Necessary to Destroy the World in Order to Save It (1970), and his thematically and directorially ambitious historical films, The St. Valentine’s Day Massacre (1967), Bloody Mama (1970), and Von Richthofen and Brown (1971).\n\nBy contrast, the fruits of those first five years have long attracted two entwined but also sharply distinct kinds of appreciation: viewers and critics genuinely fascinated by the particular kind of ingenuity and eccentric verve Corman and his team of regular collaborators exhibited, and those seeking immersion in the pantomime delights of Corman’s tacky monsters, makeshift sets, and other threadbare wonders. Here is where truly advanced Corman studies await. Those films range from strange masterpieces to a couple that are indeed pretty bad, but are all interesting – an array of stark, smart, ideogram-like variations on the essential stuff of genre cinemagoing, often delivered to meet whatever genre vogue there was going on, but shot through with perverse speculative interest, radicalism in theme and humour, and theatre-of-the-mind invention. Corman didn’t just prove you could make a movie about the end of the world on a budget that would hardly cover the catering on a big movie, but, perhaps, could and should only be done that way, with scope and scene reduced to a handful of players clinging on to the edge of the world – subject matter and setting mimicking Corman’s place in the Hollywood scheme of things. In that he proved, at long last, the ablest survivor. Corman successfully defined a version of commercial cinema that could subsist beneath the superstructure of expensive spectacle, a version that would split and veer off into many streams.\n\nCorman’s factory-line approach to turning out movies could well be traced back to the place of his birth, Detroit, and his initial choice to train as an engineer, in trying to follow his father, after the family moved to California. Corman served in the US Navy through the end of World War II before finishing a degree in industrial engineering at Stanford. After a brief attempt to work in a car manufacturing plant, Corman realised this was not his metier. His older brother Gene was already working as an agent in the film world, and Corman decided to follow him. His first display of his defining independent streak and dislike for the big Hollywood studios would emerge when he quit working for Twentieth Century Fox after not getting any credit for coming up with the idea behind Henry King’s The Gunfighter (1950), and became a student again, using the GI Bill to study English at Oxford before returning to Los Angeles and working for a literary agent whilst thrashing out scripts. One he wrote became Highway Dragnet (1954), a movie he also signed on to serve as an associate producer for no pay, purely to get experience. Corman immediately ploughed the money he got for the script and more he borrowed from contacts, adding up to about $12,000, into his first foray as full producer, Monster from the Ocean Floor (1954).\n\nThis gambit proved sufficiently successful for Corman to quickly produce another, The Fast and the Furious (1955), which Corman wrote as well and was directed by its star, John Ireland, alongside Edward Sampson. Despite receiving interested offers from well-established players, Corman sold the movie to American Releasing Company, a recently founded by the two entrepreneurial impresarios, James H. Nicholson and Samuel Z. Arkoff, as they offered Corman the chance to immediately make more movies. Corman kicked off his official directing career with his next project, Five Guns West (1955), a modest, mostly conventional, solidly-handled Western: Corman was still not yet thirty years old. Corman’s loyalties as a movie aficionado were perhaps most clearly signalled in his early work by the relatively straight-laced approach he usually took with the Westerns and gangster movies he made, but he began introducing twists, like the warring female antagonists of Gunslinger (1956), and the fascination with criminal psychology as a house of cards introduced in Day The World Ended and developed in Machine-Gun Kelly (1958) through to Bloody Mama. Corman later described The Intruder (1962) as his one stab at a message movie and his only flop, but Corman’s edge of social critique and humanist concern was percolating from the start, like the confrontation with racism often elided in Westerns in Apache Woman (1955). Gunslinger also proved fateful for Corman as it was his first time working with screenwriter Charles B. Griffiths, who would write many of Corman’s films in the next few years.\n\nSome were crime sagas, some teen flicks, others monster movies, a neat cross-section of the era’s popular fare. Still, Corman sometimes found himself starting trends rather than chasing them. The Undead (1957), a truly original and odd melange of horror, science fiction, and fantasy, emerged right at the cusp of a resurgence for horror cinema, whilst the trilogy of burlesques A Bucket of Blood (1959), The Little Shop of Horrors, and The Creature From The Haunted Sea (1961), helped birth the 1960s style of hip, pop art-inflected satirical comedy – particularly the latter, which came well before the likes of Dr. Strangelove, or, How I Learned To Stop Worrying and Love The Bomb (1964) and A Hard Day’s Night (1964) in transposing the aesthetics of stand-up comedy and MAD Magazine to the movie screen. Corman would later become most celebrated for the sheer number of future major Hollywood figures to gain major early career boosts from working with him. More immediately, Corman assembled a cadre of collaborators behind the camera and in front, employed across many movies. Some major if aging stars like Vincent Price, Boris Karloff, Peter Lorre, and Ray Milland would pass through his orbit, and stars on the rise, particularly Jack Nicholson and Charles Bronson, but also including Peter Graves, Lee Van Cleef, Mike ‘Touch’ Connors, and Robert Vaughan. But it was Corman’s corps of regular players whose faces become like old pals, among them Jonathan Haze, Dick Miller, Susan Cabot, Beverly Garland, Allison Hayes, Abby Dalton, Mel Welles, Dorothy Neumann, Barboura Morris, Richard Devon, Richard Garland, Bruno Ve Sota, and Mike Forrest.\n\nOne of the peculiar truths Corman stumbled upon, one he’d later explain to one of the young, blow-in talents looking to him for backing, a lad named Martin Scorsese, was that if you hit the right beats for pleasing the market being aimed for in his hemisphere of the filmmaking business, you could basically make any movie you wanted in between. Corman had already proved this often, and some of his best, most peculiar work exists in arguably his least-appreciated, most ephemeral movies-as-product, the ones he made to get in on the rock ‘n’ roll craze: movies like Rock All Night (1957) and Carnival Rock (1957) toss in a couple of numbers by some hit parade acts in scripts that otherwise dabble in postmodern farce and operatic tragedy, explorations of the absurd underside of show business and its players, and its connection with the vast American demimonde, the appetites serviced and personal fantasies given realisation, but built not down from the airy clouds of most Hollywood product, but from the stanchions of the street up. From almost the beginning, too, Corman had experimented with blending genre modes in a way that annexed the postmodern. It’s tempting to call Day The World Ended, Corman’s fourth film as a director, the wellspring of his oeuvre as his first movie in a fantastical genre and the one that really got things moving when it proved extremely profitable, making upwards of $1,000,000 from a budget of $96,000 and a shoot that lasted ten days.\n\nIn another sense, however, Day The World Ended stems directly from Five Guns West in focusing on a small, motley band adrift in a hostile landscape. From the Old West to the new: a high mountain abode at the fringes of what was civilisation, suddenly the only recourse for a small group of survivors of nuclear apocalypse. The script was written, as several of his early films would be, by Arkoff’s brother-in-law Lou Rusoff. Nepotism helps keep costs down, but Rusoff was also a sober, canny screenwriter, and he proved the first to invest Corman’s oeuvre with the trait that helped it to stand out, good writing and acting even in the most straitened circumstances. “Our story begins with….THE END!” announces the opening title card; its partner right at the end of the movie is, of course, “THE BEGINNING.” Corman would return to that idea with a more radical angle on Teenage Caveman (1958). “THE END!” is a mushroom cloud boiling up into the atmosphere. Atomic war has broken out, the world’s cities have been pummelled, and radioactive death is spreading across the world. Faux-Biblical scripture booms out over churning clouds. A narrator intones over shots of ruined buildings, “This is TD Day – Total Destruction by Nuclear Weapons…Man has done his best to destroy himself.” A gnarled and filthy figure gropes his way out of surging smoke and steam and stumbles down a slope before collapsing, revealing the stigmata of radiation poisoning blooming on his face. This is the edge of Corman’s little world, the pocket of normality left by the apocalypse, floating on an island of reality, the B-movie rough draft for Solaris (1972).\n\nCorman signals John Huston as a particular touchstone in Day The World Ended, borrowing the coot prospector from The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (1948) and from Key Largo (1948) the surly gangster with might-makes-right attitude and his brassy, mistreated moll at his side, as well as the theme of siege and of nerves being ridden like a merry-go-round. Day The World Ended is however more a sci-fi redraft of Frank Capra’s Lost Horizon (1937) – a fantasy of seclusion unfolding in a mountain retreat protected by walls of stone, left delicately untouched by the churning storms without, with a mystic pool of purity at its heart where the maidens swim, and where the disruption in the tenuously balanced Eden comes from those who cannot let go of the world that was. Corman’s fondness for that source was signalled decades later when he acted in a short film directed by his daughter built around its mystique. Day The World Ended is also inflected with a brand of meta-textual play that would recur throughout Corman’s career, in the characters-in-search-of-an-author eccentricity of Rock All Night, The Little Shop of Horrors, and Creature From The Haunted Sea, and hit an apotheosis with Gas, or, How It Was Necessary To Destroy The World In Order To Save It, which would also provide the ultimate self-deconstruction of Day The World Ended’s titular thesis, tales where Corman confronts characters and dramatic modes usually kept apart.\n\nDay The World Ended is still circumspect in that regard but the borrowings and tropes are fed into a supercollider, as Corman gropes towards discovering his compulsive themes and essential business model. The trash auteur who’d studied English at Oxford gives the game away by prominently featuring the Tragedy and Comedy masks on the wall of home that constitutes the bulk of the film’s setting, and even makes their presence the butt of a ruthless visual joke, as he zeroes in on a heroine trying to cheer everyone only to move as she dissolves in tears, the Comedy mask kept sarcastically in the frame. The bedraggled and irradiated survivor is Radek (Paul Dubov); shortly after geologist Rick (Richard Denning) arrives by the same path and finds Radek collapsed and seemingly dying. A little further along the ridge, gangster Tony (Connors) and his burlesque dancer girlfriend Ruby (Adele Jergens) also arrive at the fringe of the poisoned clouds in a car, and look down the slope into the mountain valley where a single, modernist-style house stands. The house belongs to Jim Maddison (Paul Birch), a retired US Navy Commander who chose the locale to live in precisely because he anticipated nuclear war and sought out a local where there was a chance of remaining safe from clouds of radioactive fallout: as well as high and remote, the mountains around the valley are filled with lead, and the house is well-stocked with provisions and fuel.\n\nMaddison lives with daughter Louise (Lori Nelson), who had called her fiancé to retreat to the house with them when it became clear war was going to break out, but he never showed up. At first Maddison wants to fight off the new arrivals because their presence would swiftly exhaust their stockpiles, a stance that seems all the more justified when Tony uses a pistol to shoot off the lock on the front door, but Louise demands her father open the house to them. Rick arrives shortly after, carrying Radek, and Maddison checks Radek with a Geiger counter, finding he’s badly irradiated. Tony’s initial intention to seize control of the situation by brandishing his gun is foiled by Rick, who surprises him with a powerful punch and disarms him. A final survivor arrives, this one descending from the mountains above: Pete (Raymond Hatton), aged gold prospector with a mule he calls Diablo. Pete claims to have just found the gold seam he’s searched for; Pete has big deals going down in his intended destination, the now non-existent San Francisco. Corman’s debriefing of the different eras and ideals of American life, pack mule to car to atom bomb to mutant, but the search for gold goes on. Despite his misgivings, Maddison quickly advises his guests to wash off with bottled water and sets about arranging the house for them. As in a fairy-tale, the clean water is the prize above all.\n\nScience fiction films of the 1950s often dealt in veiled or slightly metaphorical ways with the new reality of the atomic age. Arch Oboler’s Five (1951), a likely immediate influence on Corman and Rusoff, proposed a similar tale of a handful of survivors holed up in a large, modern house after such a war and arguing through what world they would build after, but avoided dealing directly with the realities of nuclear war. Other films had dealt with what-if scenarios about sudden cataclysms disrupting and even ending human civilisation, like Deluge (1933), Le Fin du Monde (1933), and When Worlds Collide (1952). And still more had envisioned the shock of the new and threat of the next through monstrous figurations, as mutant atomic monsters started stalking across movie screens, from Them! (1954) to Godzilla (1954). But Day The World Ended synthesised all those influences and more, and created a new subgenre: the post-apocalyptic drama, and children run as wayward as Planet of the Apes (1968), The Omega Man (1971), Mad Max (1979), and The Matrix (1999), all dealing in different ways with the same basic proposition of a post-nuclear landscape becoming as strange, teeming, brutal, transformation-riddled, and dreamlike as Greek mythology. Its DNA could also be said to inflect the entire realm of American independent film, an idea that barely existed when Corman began, but his template of making virtues out of scarcity and constructing elemental situations became its backbone: Corman, for instance, gifted the basic template to Monte Hellman for his debut The Beast From Haunted Cave (1959), and Hellman passed on the influence through his own cinema. Wim Wenders, whose Paris, Texas (1984) describes an American landscape as alien, arid, and depopulated as Corman’s, paid it puckish tribute in his The State of Things (1983), a film about a wayward attempt to remake Corman’s film.\n\nThe tiny cadre of survivors settle down to try and outlast the fallout before they exhaust their supplies. The situation is complicated as Radek, who everyone expects to die, instead clings on to life, but seems to need no food or water. Instead, he goes out of the house at night and devours wildlife that should be inedible, contaminated as all the animals are. One night, about to consume a snared rabbit, Radek sees a strange, gnarled figure looming out of the darkness and shrubbery at the valley fringe, and flees in fear. Meanwhile Tony stews with increasing frustration as he fixates on Louise, spurning Ruby and looking for a chance of gaining the upper hand over everyone. Maddison is worried that seasonal rains might dump radioactive water on the valley, spelling their doom, but for the time being a spring-fed pond provides fresh water and a place to swim. Having a dip there one day with Ruby, Louise experiences the peculiar feeling not just of being watched but of something trying to communicate with her on some inchoate level. Eventually Radek steals away Diablo the donkey and eats him, only for the lurking being to attack and kill him: the being is a mutant, a swiftly evolved response to the new radiation-soaked Earth beyond the valley, but one that still seeks what it can only find there. The distraught Pete, after finding Diablo dead, tries to climb back into the mountains but drops dead from radiation poisoning. Maddison, trying to chase him down, also receives a dangerous dose and barely makes it back to the house. Finally the mutant dares to try and snatch Louise away, whilst Tony takes advantage of Maddison’s prostration to steal his gun and plan Rick’s murder.\n\nThe valley and the house are Corman’s Forest of Arden, his Prospero’s Island, realised in a fashion that sustains a tradition to back when Shakespeare’s players only needed to hang up a sign announcing the scene was a forest. The immune Eden encompasses the possibilities of what the world looks like boiled down to a basic dichotomy: communal selflessness versus will to power. That dichotomy, as reports transmit from the mystic mutant zone from beyond the protecting ridge suggests, is solved in favour of raw strength – Corman’s regressing version of the apes-around-the-waterhole scenes of 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968). The basic object of all effort is Louise, the young, unsullied mother of the future – paging another Corman acolyte, James Cameron, and his The Terminator (1984) – and who will be her mate. The three immediately vying candidates are Rick, Tony, and the mutant; Ruby, despite being only a little bit older than Louise, is nonetheless discounted, hated by Tony as the emblem of what he was forced, in his way of thinking and seeing, to settle for. Maddison is the canny prototype of a survivalist, and also an emblem of paternal authority: the island of refuge is his discovery, his construction, and despite his own misgivings and sense he tolerates his gate-crashers. Maddison is also keeper of forbidden lore: as a Navy captain he witnessed the results of atomic bomb tests, animals deliberately exposed to the fallout. Most died, but a handful mutated rapidly to weather the new climate, gaining new, tough, crusty skin and horns on the head – and in the case of a monkey, a third eye and wicked claws.\n\nThis finds its alarming rhyme when another badly irradiated and disfigured man (Jonathan Haze) tumbles into the valley. Rick and Maddison recognise his gnarled skin and changed features as resembling the test animals, and Rick realises that Radek and this man are both stages in a continuum of mutation, of which the ultimate and perfect example is the mutant stalking the valley. The man quickly dies from starvation after reporting the formation of a community of mutants, who are stronger than him and so claim all the food. When Rick tracks Radek and asks up him what he sees when he goes back over the ridge, Radek reports, “There’s wonderful things happening,” but also mentions that he has “an enemy.” As if already tuned into the wavelength of where imagination would drift in the post-World War II era, Corman conceives of the chimera produced by the atomic age as a neo-hobgoblin with the third eye of Buddhist lore and psychic powers. These transmit on levels only Louise can pick up and that only registering on the level of sensation rather than thought, flesh and sex threatening to break and reform in strange, grotesque patterns – anticipating the proto-Cronenbergian warpings of The Haunted Palace, Corman’s great blueprint for modern body horror, in particular. In a cheeky touch, Corman includes himself as Louise’s fiancé in the framed photo she keeps and discards at film’s end, whilst it’s very faintly suggested the mutant might in fact be Louise’s fiancé, radically transformed. Playing the mutant is Paul Blaisdell, a specialist in creating masks, models, and suits, who found himself the go-to man for Corman and other makes of low-budget creature features like Edward L. Cahn throughout the late 1950s.\n\nOne of Corman’s recurring, even obsessive themes in his early movies was a fascination with defining the difference between the genuinely tough, brave, hardy, streetwise, what have you, and the merely posturing, the macho, and the maniacal. It’s a question he likely figured a vast number in his audience would respond to: many of Corman’s heroes are literal and figurative little guys who prove braver and more resilient than the hulks and he-men. He’d revisit this in terms comedic (Rock All Night), revisionist of classical myth (The Saga of the Viking Women and Their Voyage to the Waters of the Great Sea Serpent, 1957), and socially conscientious (The Intruder, when the Rick-Tony figuration is inverted and recast as the racist rabblerouser and righteous plebeian hero). The variation is straightforward in Day The World Ended, with the intelligent but still potent Rick contends with Tony, or, as they’re called at different points in the movie, “Mr All-American Hero” and “Mr Heel.” Tony is the embodiment of primeval virtue, for whom civilisation is a perpetual stymie: even in the refuge he’s only held at by Maddison who carries a gun and the key to the storeroom. Rick is at once an ideal hero but also the fallen version of something worthier, pressganged stand-in for Louise’s fiancé whilst mourning his brother, who was “studying for the ministry,” but the world needs a saviour of the flesh, not the spirit. He is, nonetheless, still two-fisted, besting Tony in their two stand-up fights. The seething, acquisitive, self-congratulatory hard-knock student Tony, declares that when he repopulates the Earth with his progeny, “They’ll be tough!” The end of the world and the reduction of the human race to a handful only winnows Tony’s feelings of frustrated strength and need down to the perfect version.\n\nMaddison, realising that survival might just be possible, lobbies for Louise to marry Rick and have children, appointing himself as the equivalent of a ship’s captain with emergency clerical powers. This all seems amusingly prim given the situation portrayed, as too is Louise and Ruby swimming together in swimsuits that wouldn’t get a deacon bothered, but the censor doth sleep no less than the atomic mutant. The dichotomy of the two female archetypes is very different to the men, signalling another quality that would distinguish Corman at the time: his female characters were a cut far above where the vast bulk of Hollywood cinema was, and sometimes still feel radical. Here basic presumptions are still in play: Louise is the “nice” girl, so prudishly dressed it borders on the satiric (like the entirely swathing nightgown she wears in the climax) versus Ruby the sexy dame. And yet Ruby is Corman’s truest figure of empathy, victim of a particular kind of misogyny not ended with the old world but perhaps only, again, rendered to pure form, as she finds herself the inferior candidate for mating and propagation. She gets along best with Pete, who she sneaks pilfered sugar to make moonshine with, watches Louise’s back, and tries to maintain Tony’s last tethers to human decency. Ruby kicks up her heels and amuses her companions by recreating her old burlesque act: “They’d give me the blue spot and then I’d give them the clincher!” she recalls with the glee of someone who’s held the eyes and groins of an audience enthralled, enacting the role of sexual a form of power and exaltation that played to a world vanished but could, in a genuinely revivified world, be powerful and beneficent. Ruby is however doomed by alternations of love and hate for her ratbag boyfriend, enacted in quick and deadly manner when she saves Louise from being raped by Tony and makes a last, desperate appeal to Tony: “What are we fighting for? We’re like a couple of kids!”, only to turn homicidally enraged when Tony spurns her: trying to stab him, Ruby instead ends up with Tony shoving the knife in her own gut, and in a startling vision of misogynist disdain, he drops her corpse over the edge of a cliff with a wiseguy kiss-off that could come right out of Raymond Chandler: “Happy landings, sweetheart.”\n\nCorman’s concise, waste-free technique contends expertly with the limited settings, as when he uses the prostrate Maddison on the couch that bisects his living room as a compositional element to complicate the space and staging, and his steady editing rhythm invisibly breaking up what is in effect a dialogue-driven chamber piece. Later Corman would know that his audience at least partly showed up to see the cheap monsters, but for the moment he makes the mutant’s first appearance a cleverly elusive, even hallucinatory moment, the creature hovering slightly out of focus in the distance, Radek looking on from the foreground. The “wonderful things” hover in the stygian mist all around, at least until the Biblically cleansing rain starts to fall. The mutant’s attempt to abduct Louise is foiled when it proves terrified of the water of the spring, and Louise manages to wriggle free and take refuge in the pool. The rain that starts falling proves to not be irradiated but instead start washes the fallout away. Representing as it does a sudden evolutionary leap to contend with a poisoned world, clean water is ironically toxic to the pathetic mutant, which dies, its corpse smoking in the downpour: Rick and Louise deduce the reason for its death and know this means other mutants won’t survive the rain either. Meanwhile Tony manages to snatch up the pistol Maddison keeps close and immediately plans to gun Rick down when he and Louise return, but he doesn’t know Rick gave Maddison another pistol for extra security, and when he realises there’s no other choice Maddison kills Tony. Maddison finally dies and Louise and Rick finally leave the valley together, with a closing note that might be just a tad excessively optimistic, but certainly fulfils the film’s parable-like form.\n\nBy the standards of Corman’s first phase, Day The World Ended is a leisurely affair at 80 minutes long – if he’d made it couple of years later it would likely have been ten to fifteen minutes shorter. It also follows suit with a lot of ‘50s sci-fi cinema in invoking religious overtones, at a time when to sell to a large audience many dabbling in the genre assumed there had to be some kind of parochial moral to what was being portrayed. This was something Corman would quickly dispense with when he realised his young audience, watching from their cars in the drive-ins between make-out sessions, didn’t really want or like. By contrast, when the moral of the story is summarised at the end of Corman’s follow-up monster movie, It Conquered The World, it’s couched entirely in terms of human qualities and potentials, distinguishing their emotional reflexes from the cold, calculating alien whose lack of feeling indicates a species without any feel for, or interest in, communal care. Rusoff wrote the script for It Conquered The World again, although Corman had Griffith give it an uncredited polish, and indeed the writing has the feel of Griffith’s involvement in the headier dialogue and quirkier humour. Again, Corman is doing the utmost with next to nothing, although now the settings stretch to a couple of different houses and interior sets, a world where famous scientists subsist in California bungalows and army bases are safely represented by some wire fencing.\n\nIt Conquered The World was the first film released under American Releasing Corporation’s new, more ambitious name of American International Pictures. This time Blaisdell was given few hundred dollars to build the monster that was to be the movie’s main attraction. Corman later, wryly commented that it taught him that movie monster shouldn’t be shorter than the leading lady, and that lady herself, Beverly Garland, reportedly snorted on seeing the creature, “That conquered the world?” The Venusian is indeed pretty blatant in its stiff articulation and rubbery stature, but is also amongst the most memorably designed and iconic of movie monsters, vaguely resembling an ambulating upturned radish with a skirting fringe of scuttling claws, two waving, pincer-capped arms, glow-in-the-dark eyes, and face twisted into a permanent evil leer. It Conquered The World gets in on the run of mid-1950s movies about alien possession and suborning with its theme of an alien invader who starts using creepy little bat-like creatures to fly around and implant control devices in chosen recipients, turning them into slaves.\n\nAnother of Corman’s recurring preoccupations emerges here, in the figure of the intelligent and inquisitive being whose private moral schemes lead them in a radically different direction to the society about them, which they consider themselves above or fatefully at odds with. Corman would later take that figure to a conceptual limit in The Masque of the Red Death’s Prince Prospero, who devoted to evil as an ethic, and Bloody Mama’s titular matriarch. Here the equivalent is Lee Van Cleef’s Dr Tom Anderson, a brilliant physicist who has nonetheless alienated himself from authorities with his impassioned antiwar activism and bizarre predictions, including theories about life on other planets being provoked by human emergence into space. Tom is first glimpsed lobbying US Defense Secretary Platt (Marshal Bradford) and General Carpenter (David McMahon) in a desperate effort to get an army-run project trying to launch satellites into space cancelled: “We’re all in a state of high hilarity,” Tom comments sardonically when the honchoes denies he’s been worrying them, “And we’ll all end up in a state of high mortality if you don’t call off this satellite project.”\n\nMeanwhile Anderson’s close friend and former colleague Dr Paul Nelson (Peter Graves) is running the project with his own, more orthodox genius and sense of duty to the fore. His team of scientists and technicians includes Dr Ellen Peters (Karyne Kadler) and Dr Pete Shelton (Griffith), and they’re trying to finally get a satellite into orbit after several failures. “I hear that satellite cost us nine million bucks,” one of the team notes, to another’s quip: “It’d be just great if she sideswiped an airliner.” Tom and Paul and their wives Claire Anderson (Garland) and Joan Nelson (Sally Fraser) have dinner together at the Andersons’ house, where Paul gets the feeling Tom is peculiarly smug about his latest satellite launch. Tom responds by showing Paul a shortwave radio setup in his living room, and lets Paul listen to a peculiar throbbing noise coming in over it, a noise that Tom says is actually the voice of an alien being he’s made contact with, one of a circle of nine, immensely advanced beings living on Venus. What Tom doesn’t tell his friend yet is that he’s been paving the way for the alien to come to Earth: Tom has given the alien information about the personnel of the project base and who exactly it needs to take control of amidst the local population in order to seize all the levers of authority. Tom’s reasons for helping the creature emerge quickly: Tom believes the alien will benignly apply its greater intelligence and will on the human race, finally cure it of warlike impulses and set the species on the path to noble betterment, a world where a man like Tom will finally be hailed as a noble visionary rather than a brilliant crank. The alien’s spacecraft crash-lands after encountering the satellite Paul’s team launched, but the alien survives and takes up residence in a cave system near the project base. The alien sends out a number of small, bat-like flying creatures to track down those selected to be controlled, including Paul and his fellow scientists on the project as well as its military overseer, General Pattick (Russ Bender), and the Sheriff of the nearby town, Shallert (Taggart Casey), as well as Joan and other wives, as Tom has told the alien they must also be controlled. The alien also uses its powers to shut down every machine in the surrounding countryside, save those belonging to Tom and the subjugated: in a miniature remake of The Day The Earth Stood Still (1951), trains, cars, and industrial machines crawl to a halt.\n\nAt first glance It Conquered The World seems fairly conventional in its mid-1950s social presumptions, with its pair of dutiful housewife-partners framing the core clash of rebel antihero, a study in warning about and professional intellectual dissenters crossing the line into outright disloyalty through utter conviction they’re doing right, versus the firmly with-the-program hero. Add to this to the way the alien mimics a particular kind of propagandist ideal of what a Communist was supposed to act like – lacking familiar moral standards, acting according to emotionless expedience and absorbing other consciousnesses into its own, blank, gestalt identity. As the film unfolds, however, Corman has great fun revising and toying with those precepts. The alien proves instead a caricature of arch individualism, as Paul realises, acting without any understanding of human empathy as above all the underpinning of a social animal. Paul has to become the anarchic and ruthless guerrilla warrior within his own little backwater. The wives are soon split between the conformity-pushing, in the shape of the controlled Joan, thrusting one of the bat-creatures at her husband with a smile of pleasure straight out of a TV commercial evangelising a miracle cleaning product, and Claire, the seething defender of both home and species, who becomes increasingly determined and irate in provoking her husband’s conscience before marching off with rifle in hand to confront the alien invader. The military hierarchy, in the form of Pattick, is easily controlled, and his watchwords of paranoia readily tweaked to serve the alien’s quarantining needs precisely.\n\nAll that’s left of army power capable of intervening is a unit of bewildered GIs tramping about the landscape as if trapped in their own private Beckett play. Here we get the essential Corman double act, of Dick Miller as the stern, rugged, but confused sergeant Neil, and Haze as Ortiz, ethnic comic relief, an obscurely accented, clumsy, but attentive private who notes the “funny-looking bird” that keeps flitting overhead. Cruel satire on the spectacle of repression of civil rights protestors comes when Paul happens upon the controlled sheriff casually gunning down elderly newspaper editor Haskell (Thomas E. Jackson) for his refusal to obey orders. Paul’s sense of logic dictates that anyone possessed by the alien is “my enemy,” and takes this to the still rather shocking limit of shooting Joan after she attempts to plug him into the alien’s soothing mainstream of mindless obedience. Corman’s jocular cynicism extends to the dead-eyed violence that dots the film, from Tom setting Shallert on fire with his blowtorch after he changes sides, to one of the suborned scientists at the rocket range calmly reciting instructions over the radio whilst his colleague throttles Ellen to death, after she is horrified to find the bat-creatures that delivered their control devices in a putrefying stack stashed in a locker: the cool, post-gender landscape of scientific research suddenly becomes the scene of proto-slasher movie stuff. Corman’s images become increasingly charged with evocations of extreme threat but all couched in everyday and domestic settings – Claire beholding her husband dutifully oiling up his rifle to get ready to kill his friend and lurking behind decorative bars that became a cage cutting her off from her husband, and Paul pulling out his pistol to gun down his wife and then clutching her body whilst sobbing.\n\nWhilst dotted with such episodes of surprisingly hard-edged violence and weirdness, It Conquered The World is like Day The World Ended finally propelled by character interaction, with the two scientists duelling with a kind of violence manifest in thought and attitude, violence that never becomes physical between them as Tom in particular tries to maintain the indulgent reasonableness of a man confident he’s about to be proven right. The rest of the action can be seen as mere illustration of the clash of their differing philosophies. Science fiction epic spills over into domestic drama, the two different marriages proving battlegrounds the alien war is fought on. Joan’s possession and Paul’s slaying of her sparks Tom’s appalled bewilderment: “She was still your wife – still Joan! You would have been one with her…”, to Paul’s hard, disgusted retort that she had become his enemy in a war that Tom has foisted on them all. Hard as it to see the roguish Van Cleef with his vulture-like, lunging physique as anyone’s idea of a famous scientist, he does a great job regardless of selling his character’s mix of fanatical fervour and friendly indulgence, as when he assures Paul over the phone that since he’s destroyed his control unit and can’t be possessed for at least a week he might as well come over a drink. But the scotch-sipping palsiness of Tom and Paul doesn’t disguise the sharp angles of their duels of language. “Makes me look back into history for comparison,” Tom comments when Paul notes the alien’s ruthless methods. “Comparison or rationalisation?” Paul retorts. Finally the alien, tired of Paul marauding and upsetting their plans, decides it can’t wait to muzzle him and commands Tom to kill his friend. And Tom seems to shoulder this responsibility in the name of the greater good.\n\nMeanwhile Claire, marvellous played by Garland, personally embodies a paradigm in her moment of his history, trying to live according to the ideal of wifely duty, a duty that demands she incessantly harass her husband over his increasingly dubious life choices, the old job talk transmogrified into a running debate on the ethics of intergalactic treason. As treason unfolds, Claire finds herself made militant and obliged to go out and face the being that is both organ of and puppet master for Tom’s galactic-sized ego. In the process she evolves into a rough draft for Ellen Ripley in her furious, alien-slayer resolve. “Look, I don’t know if you can hear me or not,” she barks over the radio at the alien she now sees as her personal nemesis, “But if you can you listen good – I hate your living guts for what you’ve done to my husband and to my world! I know you for the coward you are and I’m gonna kill you!” The steals the rifle Tom intends to use on Paul and ventures into the caves. There she’s confronted by the creature: “You think you’re gonna make a slave of the world? I’ll see you in hell first!” she snarls as she plugs the sneering creature. But the alien proves invulnerable to both bullets and invective, and Claire dies nastily in its pincers. A sorry end for a character who today would be onto her fourth franchise instalment. Tom and Paul overhear her death through the radio, finally shocking Tom out of all his illusions about the alien’s nature.\n\nOrtiz hears Claire’s screams whilst he’s foraging, as he fetches his comrades. Too late to save Claire, they battle the monster within and outside the cave. Meanwhile Paul visits the rocket range and guns down the possessed there, whilst Tom improvises a weapon with the blowtorch and kills the sheriff to get hold of his working car. Arriving at the cave, Tom is in time to see the soldiers being slaughtered by the alien on the rampage, but he manages to approach the alien which thinks it still his stooge, only for Tom to declare with savage reckoning, “I made you welcome to this Earth – you made it a charnel house!” He plunges the blowtorch into one of the Venusian’s eyes: the alien swipes him in agonised retaliation, and monster and scientist both topple over dead, Tom lying in the alien’s cold embrace. Corman’s laconic direction sharpens here and there with flashes of the inspired, like the sight of the alien’s gleaming eyes in deep shadow as it advances on Claire, and suddenly at the very end he goes for a concluding note of threadbare cinematic poetry, cutting between the various littered corpses left behind by the drama, as Paul makes account of the meaning of it all: “There can’t be any gift of perfection from outside ourselves,” Paul notes by way of eulogy when he arrives too late: “It has to come from inside – from Man himself.” A fascinating sign-off to a movie from the era, contrasting the usual moral along the lines of “there are some things man is not meant to know,” with Corman’s own, distinct variation: humanity must know itself before it can know anything. And in this idea, Corman had found the key to his career’s preoccupations. That, and making much out of practically nothing.\n\n.\n\nDirector: George Miller\n\nScreenwriters: Nick Lathouris, George Miller\n\nBy Roderick Heath\n\nHere there be spoilers…\n\nIt’s impossible to believe nine years have elapsed since George Miller released Mad Max: Fury Road, his revival of his canonical action series. My own muted, even irritated response to that film contrasted its hyperbolic reception by so many – although the film was only a modest hit, the way it dominated cineaste conversation for a few months back when made it seem like the only film in the universe. In retrospect it’s plain what the film did and didn’t accomplish. It hardly unleashed a wave of gritty, back-to-filmmaking-basics action flicks – the degree to which it represented that itself was absurdly overhyped – but it did inform the narrative strategies and archetypes in many movies, particularly a revival of action feminism as a pop culture grail. People were impressed enough that Miller in his 70s was making a movie that muscular, which makes the release of his follow-up Furiosa – A Mad Max Saga at the sprightly age of 79 even more of a feat. Furiosa – A Mad Max Saga is, actually, a prequel, depicting Fury Road’s heroine in her life before the run for freeom that film depicted. Prequels are always fraught propositions. They constantly dice with substituting alluring mystique for the painfully literal, for spelling out the intriguingly enigmatic as the blindingly obvious, and, moreover, simply trying to wring more money out of franchises where the makers don’t dare do something new.\n\nIt’s plain, however, that Furiosa, played by Charlize Theron in Fury Road, compels Miller as a character – the resurgent, vengeful embodiment of the abused feminine so unceremoniously run over back in his debut, his first Mad Max film, all the way back in 1979, thrust with heightened contrast, but also perfectly evolved fitness, into the ultra-macho world Miller fused out of all the spare parts harvested from Australian car culture, spaghetti westerns, samurai movies, and post-apocalyptic science fiction. The Mad Max mythos has since slipped the scene of its birth – jagged punk humour, an air of reportage from a schismatic post-colonial culture in rapid change, and hard verisimilitude in staging were all hallmarks of the original Mad Max trilogy’s approach, but now this property is ensconced in the age of blockbuster ambition, if, at least, still thoroughly implanted in Australian filmmaking culture. Miller even begins the film with a shot of the Australian continent from the perspective of space before diving down through the atmosphere to a location in the continent’s centre, really the first time the series has ever squarely accepted Australia as the series’ setting rather than being merely the blank canvas of its futurism. Despite retaining aspects of continuity from movie to movie in the old trilogy, those movies already seemed to be essentially offering Max as a timeless archetype – the action movie equivalent of Charlie Chaplin’s Tramp – and the timeframes of the two most recent movies seem to be urging even more in that direction. Furiosa – A Mad Max Saga hits many of the expected beats of a narrative about Furiosa, depicting how she was taken from the childhood refuge of the Green Place, how she finished up working for and allied to the despicable warlord Immortan Joe, and even how she lost her left arm.\n\nFuriosa – A Mad Max Saga is however also an extension not just of the Mad Max franchise but of Miller’s career-long preoccupations with storytelling as an endlessly sprawling and interlocking phenomenon, connecting across frontiers of culture and individuals. The film’s quasi-mythic approach to expostulating Furiosa’s life story, framed by the narration of a character in the film, the History Man (George Shevtsov), makes plain that Furiosa – A Mad Max Saga is less in-universe journalism than a string of retellings mediated by time and perspective. This points to the way the film itself is a succession of revisions of Miller’s previous work and motifs. More prosaically, but also more pleasingly, Furiosa – A Mad Max Saga steps back from Miller’s hyped-up strategy on Fury Road: that film’s opening scenes, with their frenetic, music-video-like cutting, is immediately contrasted with Miller’s return to a more elegant, spacious, grandiose style, at least when framing his extended, ferocious action scenes, an approach that contrasts but also helps amplify the other quality Miller brings to bear, of spare, cool essentialism. This is immediately apt for an opening that depicts a child Furiosa (Alyla Browne) and friend Valkyrie (Dylan Adonis) picking pears from a tree in the Green Place, a refuge of forest and water in the otherwise decimated Wasteland zone, where the girls’ families and community are subsisting in apparent happiness and industry.\n\nBut the scene is immediately despoiled by a gang of marauders, bikers who have stumbled upon the Green Place, the existence of which has been reported but never nailed down. Furiosa, knowing the bikers shouldn’t be allowed to get away, sneaks down to their parked metal steeds to cut their fuel lines, but is caught and bundled up by the men, who see her existence, as an unblemished and entirely healthy girl contrasting most of the apocalypse survivors beset with “half-life,” as necessary proof of the Green Place’s existence. They flee on their bikes, but Valkyrie alerts Furiosa’s mother Mary Jabassa (Charlee Fraser), who gives chase and turns her formidable skills as a sniper on them, steadily whittling down their number until only two are left. Furiosa’s own ingenuity also frustrates them as she bits through a fuel line and tries to escape, but the last rider, Toe Jam (David Field), manages to get Furiosa to the fringe of the large encampment of a biker horde, just before Furiosa’s conniving gets her captor’s throat torn open. The girl is nonetheless presented to the leader of the horde, the swaggering Dr Dementus (Chris Hemsworth), who tries and fails to extract the Green Place’s location from the expiring Toe Jam. When a sandstorm blows in and smothers the encampment, Mary sneaks down, slays men guarding Furiosa in Dementus’s tent, and steals her away. But on the road back, knowing she can’t outrun the pursuing bikers, Mary tells Furiosa to ride by herself back home whilst she mounts a delaying action. But Furiosa can’t leave her mother, and so becomes the distraught witness to her capture and slow, terrible torture to death in punishment by Dementus and his goon squad.\n\nThis long opening portion might well be the best thing Miller has ever done, immediately plunging the viewer into a situation at once specific to the known forms of his established universe and so perfectly elemental it doesn’t require more than the slightest exposition and pretext. We could be on a primal plain, a rival tribe having snatched a child, but for the decaying technology of a collapsed world – the essential proposal of Miller’s Mad Max films encapsulated in a perfect ideogram. The sense of rhythmic propulsion – aided by Tom Holkenborg’s scoring and contoured by Margaret Sixel and Eliot Knapman’s nerveless editing – is matched to precision of detail deployment. We swiftly accrue insight into how a culture has evolved for survival in the Wasteland, and appreciate the canniness of the Green Place breed who, far from having gone soft in their relative life of ease, are capable and infinitely nimble. Mary is able to appropriate discarded vehicles and parts and universal adapting devices (would that actual vehicle repair was so sensible), and relentlessly running down and slaying the kidnappers. The opening also, purposefully echoes the later scenes of the original Mad Max, depicting a parent chasing down bikers who, rather than seeking to exact retribution on a mother and child, have instead split them apart and reap the consequences; the jokey image of the old woman wielding a shotgun in the original has been swapped out for the eagle-eyed young mother taking aim across swathes of arid and alien land to strike down her foes.\n\nIt’s too good a start for even the greatest filmmaker to sustain, but Miller tries his damndest. Furiosa – A Mad Max Saga essentially consists of four main set-pieces, each the axle for a phase in Furiosa’s maturation, with mediating episodes to cement the nominal story and flesh out the particular corner of the world noted only in the shallowest terms in Fury Road. Dementus imprisons Furiosa whilst coming to regard her as something like an adopted daughter and drags her along with his travelling caravan of miscreants. He entrusts her care and education to the History Man, an old and wizened figure who has scrawled some of the vital lore he retains not just on his priest-like robes but in tattoos upon his skin. Furiosa, whilst refusing to speak at all whilst in Dementus’s retinue and affecting disdain, takes a leaf from the History Man’s example and tattoos the direction back to the Green Place as marked by stars on her arm. After a period of wandering, the biker horde sees a flare exploding over the wasteland and track it to its source – a member of the berserker cult called War Boys (Sean Millis) with an arrow lodged in his brow, who hopes he’s gone to Valhalla when he sees the horde, and tells them of the existence of the Citadel run by Immortan Joe (Lachy Hulme). Dementus immediately tries to lay siege to the Citadel, but finds the War Boys’ maniacal devotion to their boss and the defences of the place too formidable, and quickly flees.\n\nDementus remains determined to cut himself in on Joe’s action, and concocts a stratagem to seize one of Joe’s other two fortresses, the oil pumping and refining station known as Gastown. With the city in his control, Dementus confronts Joe to seeking a deal to keep him and his horde fed in exchange for ensuring Gastown’s product keeps flowing. Joe accepts on the proviso of claiming Dementus’s pet physican, the Organic Mechanic (Angus Sampson), and Furiosa herself, who finally speaks to disclaim any relation to Dementus. Joe takes her in as an alluring prospect for a future wife and adds her to his harem, all kept in an abode behind a vault door. Already seeing her physical attributes are tantalising and troublesome, Furiosa concocts a trick: she cuts off her longish red hair and makes it into an improvised wig: when Joe’s large, dumb, pervert son Rictus (Nathan Jones) plucks her out of the vault to get his mesmerised jollies, she’s able to give him the slip and takes refuge amidst the city’s lesser denizens. A few years later, having grown up to look remarkably like Anya Taylor-Joy, Furiosa has disguised herself as a boy and emerges from anonymity when she displays guts and an edge of ruthless smarts when she saves a wrecked vehicle being hoisted into the citadel to scavenge, and lets a luckless worker drop to his death. This gets Furiosa promoted to work as a mechanic. She helps build the War Rig, an armoured petrol tanker designed to run food out to Gastown and bring back fuel. Planning to flee en route with half-baked ideas of revenge on Dementus and running back to the Green Place, Furiosa finds herself forced to aid the truck’s crew, and its valiant driver Praetorian Jack (Tom Burke), in battling off renegades split from Dementus, who try with all their might and suicidal bravura to capture the truck.\n\nMiller’s preoccupation with mythical story structures and chains of storytelling defined the original Mad Max films increasingly, and also bled over into his swerves into children’s entertainment like Happy Feet (2006). The one film he made in between Fury Road and Furiosa – A Mad Max Saga, his adaptation of A.S. Byatt’s Three Thousand Years of Longing (2022), was an uneven and cumulatively exasperating but certainly interesting effort to engage with the urge and act of storytelling itself, as a form of conjuring, connecting past to present and self to group, both disguising and revealing truth. Miller plays mythopoeic bingo throughout Furiosa – A Mad Max Saga, with nods to many a legendary hero’s life beginning with a fateful exile and orphaning, to the likes of Mulan in donning mannish disguise to weather the travails of being young and female in a dangerous, masculine world, and to Arthur as a once and future knight disguised in dogsbody clothes, and, of course, to the Trojan cycle: Dementus’s method for grabbing control of Gastown is a variation on the Trojan Horse, and later, more subtly, a character is executed in a riff on Hector being dragged behind Achilles’ chariot. Miller and coscreenwriter Nick Lathouris also tip their hats to other films. John Milius’s Conan The Barbarian (1982) is Miller’s overall model for depicting a hero’s growth from stolen and mistreated child to full-grown, omnicompetent warrior and incarnation of Nietzschean will through an episodic epic. Miller confirms this debt with a couple of direct salutes, in repeated images of characters crucified on trees, in the History Man’s skin-riddling script, and when Immortan Joe displays his power by getting one of his warboys to fearlessly sacrifice himself from on high, just as Thulsa Doom did. The way the raiders who take Furiosa have cattle skulls affixed to their handlebars provides unexpected homage to Touki-Bouki (1973).\n\nAnother homage pulls off the admirable two-birds-one-stone hit in referencing Akira Kurosawa’s Yojimbo (1961) and through it Sergio Leone’s A Fistful of Dollars (1964), as at one point a dog is spotted carrying a human body part in its mouth – not a hand as in Yojimbo but a foot this time. Miller’s own, special imagination is apparent in the touch of the armoured truck having been refashioned into a communal work of art, reminiscent of Achilles’ shield in The Iliad with the story of civilisation etched on its face, here in the flanks of the tanker having been imprinted with bas-relief artworks encompassing the mythos of the Citadel and the War Boys. Where in Fury Road the social structure of the Citadel and its symbolic nature were shallow and elided, Miller is fastidious almost to a fault in describing the interrelationship of the Citadel, Gastown, and the third necessary producing fortress city of the Wasteland, the Bullet Farm, and the crude but effective economy that’s arisen in the interrelationship of the Citadel’s use of water to produce hydroponic foodstuff and organic protein with insect farms and the material churned out by the other fortresses to build Joe’s military power. Miller nods back to both Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome (1985) and Happy Feet in his acerbic portrait of social leaders: the People Eater (John Howard), an ally of Joe’s with a fake nose and tattered business suit, is a satire on the idea of a politician as a malignant front for the actual power of Joe and his cult.\n\nThe two major factions become then surveys of different kinds of social control and order. Dementus tries to use a blend of charisma and showmanship to command his tribe, blended with bloodcurdling spectacle of punishment for those who get in his way. Joe, hulking but damaged and deformed, is a self-constructed nightmare figure, a steampunk Darth Vader with an army of warriors more effectively and efficiently enthralled by the promise of paradise for dying in battle. Dementus has both real cunning but also a self-defeating aspect, unable to control his people in the same way although he has such quaint rituals as the fate that befell Furiosa’s mother and, later, a forced battle between some failed rebels in the ranks to earn a place on the motorbikes that will be used to quarter their leader. Dementus is a great leader when commanding a roving band but flails in his attempt to seize the reins from Joe in a step-by-step plot, because Joe has already figured out how to best persuade and enthral people: religion. Dementus and his horde seem rather to have built themselves a kind of cargo cult around their motorcycles, understandable, but not as effective. Furiosa herself threads through a path between these camps, refusing to become a tended orchid in Joe’s hothouse – she knows, having seen one of Joe’s wives give birth to stillborn conjoined twins and being hence relegated to a cow to be milked, that such a nominal boon isn’t permanent, even if she was up for being sexually used by malformed creeps. She’s already had a taste of such treatment, in one of Miller’s gleefully grotesque yet peculiarly sensible asides, as the Organic Mechanic sometimes tapped her blood to make blood sausage for Dementus – a relatively subtle but bleakly funny variation on Miller’s recurring motif of people made into livestock in the last realm of Darwinian capitalism. Furiosa has one keepsake of the Green Place she keeps with her always, a peach seed she keeps hidden within her hair, or, at the times she cuts that off, in her mouth.\n\nIndeed, although fairly restrained in terms of visible bloodletting, Furiosa – A Mad Max Saga is Miller’s most gleefully violent and nasty film since The Road Warrior, restoring some of the feral savagery and baroque grotesquery that initially defined the series, from the dying Toe Jam being hung upside down to drain the blood from his throat so he can cough up the Green Place’s location, to Mary being crucified and having terrible things done to her thankfully just out of camera’s direct view, and sundry other acts. The capping image of fiendish poetic justice is also pure nightmare fuel, something the appended montage of footage from the more plainly upbeat Fury Road can’t dispel. The driving notion that this is a world where cruelty is a currency also however leads into Miller’s interesting attempt to weigh up an interesting question. The upshot of the film has a surprising overlap in thematic concern and preoccupation with some other recent movies, including Nick Cassavetes’ God Is A Bullet (2023), in focusing on an abused young woman seeking revenge against a charismatic, cult leader-like man but faced with the impossibility of dealing out any kind of revenge that can properly exact payment for just exactly what it is that’s been taken from her. Hemsworth himself has already established a talent for playing the sort of character he does here, and indeed has arguably done it better, in his pseudo-Charles Manson in Drew Goddard’s Bad Times At El Royale (2018) and, most wittily, as a smarmy new-age techie guru in Joseph Kosinski’s Spiderhead (2022).\n\nThe idea is that Dementus sees himself as a kind of ironic father figure to Furiosa, having through his brutality and example essentially reforged her as a higher being, again is a variation on the relationship of Conan and Thulsa in Conan The Barbarian, but with the motif given a screwy, Sadean sitcom-at-world’s-end makeover. Dementus is intended as a villain who is capable of truly awful brutality and ruthlessness and has a clever tactical mind, but also has a loopy, neurotic, even comedic energy that has to flow somewhere because he’s sealed and cauterised off vital parts of his nature: he repeatedly mentions having lost his family during the collapse of civilisation, and the price he’s paid for not only surviving but becoming a wasteland king is the throttling of his civilised self and, with it, an extra dimension of astuteness as well as feeling. Some remnant of it persists: in what seems to be a funny flourish of incidental detail but proves crucial, he has a teddy bear dangling off his back by chains. He gives this to Furiosa, who casts its aside but takes it up again, only for Dementus to snatch it back again in a huff when she tells the truth about him to Joe and accepts Joe’s shelter. Trouble is, something here, both in the writing and in Hemsworth’s performance, doesn’t quite grant access to any sense of the broken man buried far within Dementus’s shell, the one who might have a little tragic gravitas to deepen his villainy. The idea that he might cast Furiosa in the role of progeny even if he doesn’t really feel it is also skirted and skidded over without effect: Dementus doesn’t even learn who the adult Furiosa is until their final confrontation.\n\nThe film’s central and most spectacular sequence depicts Praetorian Jack’s effort to drive the War Rig to Gastown, with Furiosa and the rest of the crew fighting tooth and nail against the renegades’ piratical assault. Here Miller deliberately restages the climax of Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior (1981) as a self-conscious indulgence of the reboot ethic, and also keeping in mind in how much classical mythology borrowed and remixed idea and motifs. The likeness here is not so much Homer’s The Iliad to The Odyssey but The Iliad to Virgil’s The Aeneid, the quasi-remake that inflates and augments, reshuffles and enlarges. More to the point, Miller has a high old time throwing every nutty new idea at the old concept, with the renegades parasailing behind their pursuing vehicles and a nasty new weapon fixed to the War Rig to see off boarding parties: a pivoting fixture on the back that when switched on swivels with dangling maces to churn anything in range to junk and red foam. During the battle Furiosa has to crawl up the underside of the tanker trailer, handed a vital part to fix the engine by an engineer before he gets crushed under the wheels. Finally, after everyone else has been killed, Furiosa is left alone with Praetorian Jack, and she makes a play to take over the War Rig, holding him at gunpoint. But Jack simply dumps her out of the vehicle and seems to leave her behind, only to return on foot to her, pointing out the flaws in her plan and offering to take her on as his driving partner.\n\nIt’s both great and disconcerting to see Burke, the simmering romancer and wastrel of The Souvenir (2019) and other serious-minded recent movies, playing the film’s rather blatant Max Rockatansky stand-in – Jack is costumed just like Max in The Road Warrior as well as basically taking his place, and moreover, I was left with the feeling he did a much better job as replacement Max than Tom Hardy in Fury Road (Miller spares a brief cutaway cameo reproducing the first sighting of Max in Fury Road, with a figure plainly supposed to be Max standing by his Interceptor and looking down from a bluff upon the Citadel – hopefully we’re not meant to presume that he spent the ten or so years standing up there or however long it’s supposed to be between this film and Fury Road). The crucial moment when Jack reappears on the road after Furiosa thinks he’s left her behind sees him advancing with a leisurely stride and an attitude of confidence not laden with arrogance or neurosis – he has an aura of a kind that’s almost a foreign language in current pop culture. Burke’s not as traditionally good-looking an actor as Hemsworth, but he has that actor’s gift of seeming to transform his whole form in a role. You can understand why Furiosa falls for him, although Miller proves a little shy of coming to grips with their affair. Back in Mad Max he wasn’t shy of exploring the easy chemistry of Max and his wife and even spared time for Goose enjoying the performance of a leggy chanteuse. In today’s blockbusters with all their clashing impulses and niceties it’s far harder to portray a proper adult passion than torture, to show bodies being smashed in every conceivable way except for actually, like, smashing.\n\nStill, Furiosa – A Mad Max Saga is a film supercharged with emotional intensity, albeit coded into its imagery. Again, this is perhaps best realised in the opening chase, with the maternal determination and punitive intent of Mary imprinted on her concerted brow and constant, efficient forward movement, and expressed with her lethally accurate bullets, motifs returned to later as Furiosa herself wields a rifle with the same protective and vengeful urge, and sets out to close the circle with her own relentlessly focused chase. The risk is that when everything is dedicated to putting over the awesome, not much stays awesome, but Miller manages some striking antistrophes, as when he notes one of the Gastown elders methodically reproducing John William Waterhouse’s “Hylas and the Nymphs” on the walls of a chamber, the image with its evocation of erotic allure, the mutual mystery of male and female filtered through the divine and mortal, an echo out of the past with a sense of the fragility of both art and humans, so starkly contrasting the world outside. Later the painting is noted scuffed and seedy as it suffers from Dementus’s oblivious keeping: Miller packs must suggestion into these twinned glimpses, his meditation on the state of our art and the carelessness with which its keepers keep it, particularly when it gets in the way of an agenda. Miller is taking his original impulse behind the Mad Max films to a limit here – something close to a silent film in the way the images take the weight of the emotion, and the films express themselves in motion as emotion.\n\nThat’s not to say I think Miller is completely successful in that regard: getting back to Jack and Furiosa, and Miller’s self-invited comparison to Conan The Barbarian, it’s notable how well Milius’s montage of Conan and Valeria in the throes of passion that becomes something deeper, infused with that Basil Poledouris score, makes coherent what follows for them, where Miller settles for just having his couple press brows together in a CGI-decorated pullback shot. A niggle, perhaps. Miller’s cinema is arresting throughout, both on a nuts-and-bolts level, the lensing used to give physical forms and actions a looming, thrusting, adamantine presence, and in gestures that blend technique and expression, especially a marvellous time-lapse effect that conveys the passage of days, months, years in Furiosa’s life. This shot offers the sight of her discarded wig, a bowl with her discarded hair glued to it, perched in a branch jutting from the rocky side of the Citadel, the branch managing to grow and reach out for the ever-passing sun in this desolate place, keeping the discarded remnant of Furiosa’s youth with it. Miller recreates stylistic aspects of his early films, most specifically the motif of mayhem being watched from a remote vantage, the action at a tantalising, cinematic distance and the sound muted. Sixel and Knapman’s cutting is much, much cleaner than the frenetic, garbling editing of Fury Road, the staging finding an ideal meeting point for Miller’s fluid lines of motion and the requirements of contemporary cinema with its chain lightning pacing. In this regard in particular Furiosa – A Mad Max Saga feels like a return to form for Miller.\n\nMoreover, Fury Road missed with me was that it seemed to want to ply concepts and messages without having really thought them through: the fleeing females were in search of a promised Eden and yet the film never tried to grapple with their ways of thinking and seeing as they must have been shaped by the world they’re in. Furiosa – A Mad Max Saga on the other hand tries very hard to make its characters and their choices and their little world more coherent, the aesthetic ideal of perpetual motion and expression through sign and deed segmented as a result. Fans of Fury Road’s devil-may-care approach might well find this frustrating to a degree, particularly as Miller quite conspicuously slows down between the big sequences. Personally there were points where I wished he’d done so even more: to quote Mystery Science Theater 3000, I started to lose track of all the crappy vehicles swerving about on dusty roads. Also, in Fury Road I had assumed Furiosa was some kind of nom-de-guerre or honorific doled out by Immortan Joe, but no, it’s just her name, for some reason. I was tickled by the presence of some familiar Aussie faces dotted through the cast, like comedian David Collins, former footballer Ian Roberts, and musician Tim Rogers, as well as Mrs Hemsworth Elsa Pataky under some disfiguring makeup as one of Dementus’s lieutenants – a cadre who have all taken their names from makes of motorcycle.\n\nBut Taylor-Joy is the star here, even if the film necessarily keeps her off-screen until the second half, and then her chief job is mostly to be the human emblem and linchpin for bedlam. Taylor-Joy is an elegant contradiction in the current, rising movie star stakes: so far she seems infinitely flexible as a performer, her sinuous physique the pure stuff of magazine spreads but her anime-character eyes imbue a quirky specificity. It’s not a part that asks as much of her as she might give, that said. Part of me wished that Miller would let Furiosa get more feral, more furious, rather than the sternly adamant thing she’s already been defined as. That’s another problem with prequels: they’re doomed to be locked into predefined patterns rather than follow the shifting energies of new moments and choices. Also, the film, so fastidious elsewhere, is silent as to just why Furiosa grows up with Taylor-Joy recreating Theron’s American brogue (amusing given Theron herself is South African) when she’s grown up in places where everyone else speaks fluent Strayan. All that said, however, whilst she doesn’t look all that much like Theron, Taylor-Joy immediately stakes claim to Furiosa as personal property: with long hair dyed red, and later shaved off entirely, and forehead swathed in black, cabalistic makeup in her Praetorian guise that draws out the vulpine, witchy intensity of her one-of-a-kind eyes, Taylor-Joy has a potent allure and gamine physicality ideal for the part, and her gaze has an intensity that bespeaks of a soul melted down to red hot fluid and never again congealed, blazing out of every glance.\n\nDementus’s schemes to seize control of the whole domain drives him to first capture the Bullet Farm. Jack and Furiosa, having determined to abandon the Citadel and ride off in search of the Green Place after completing a last run to the Bullet Farm, and find the place has been seized by Dementus’s horde, who try their best trap and overwhelm the War Rig: Furiosa brings her own, honed sniping skills to bear and tries to kill Dementus whilst Jack wrathfully barrels the War Rig through the horde and uses the Rig as a battering ram to destroy the old industrial buildings at the Farm’s heart. Here Miller manages to completely articulate the meshed emotions played out in the ferocious action: Furiosa’s care for Jack and singleminded hate of Dementus are both behind her shots, and Jack’s wrath at being underestimated results in factory chimneys swaying and tumbling. He’s forced to abandon the rig and take off with Furiosa in a car they’ve prepared for their flight, but they’re chased down by Dementus. Furiosa is tied up by her damaged arm and forced to watch as Jack isdragged behind a bike for hours on end, steadily tearing him to pieces. When Dementus calls time and the dust settles, he finds Furiosa has gnawn through her arm, leaving hand and wrist in the shackle whilst the rest of her stumbles back to the Citadel.\n\nMiller’s choice of framing his miniature myth of Furiosa takes a peculiar turn here, right when it seems to be gearing up for a grandiose climax. Joe and his squadrons heed Furiosa’s advice about Dementus’s deceptive intentions when he seems to be burning Gastown, and instead head to draw him into battle on the plains between. The History Man’s narration notes sardonically all the wars of human history leading up to this one, which he dubs the “Forty Day Wasteland War,” not quite a fulfilment of Einstein’s dictum about the last war being fought with the weapons of the first, but getting there. This proves the sardonically defined terminus of the Mad Max series’ running theme of the inextricability of violent conflict from human affairs and history, and also an adjunct to the holy mission of revenge Furiosa is committed to. She fashions herself a mechanical arm to utilise and rides out after Joe’s forces have put Dementus to flight. Furiosa even works the arrogance of Rictus and brother Scrotus (Josh Helman) to her own ends as she lets them do the work of appropriating fuel and vehicle parts to repair one of their own cars only to then blithely ride off in it, on the way to tracking down Dementus and the last of his band. Finally she brings Dementus down and confronts him in what might be intended to be Miller’s homage to and variation on the “point of dying” climax of Once Upon A Time In The West (1968).\n\nBut Miller tries to avoid merely recreating that kind of scene. What he offers instead proves both gripping and awkward. Miller had three choices here. He could gain some pathos from the presence of some kind of actual familial feeling between Dementus and Furiosa, persisting alongside their very real mutual hatred. Or, he could have that feeling persist in one character but not the other, and gain some moment of conclusive shock and emotion at the realisation. Or, simply have the bad guy get taken down by the heroine. The version Miller tries pits Furiosa’s haughty vengefulness and determination to find a way of extracting satisfaction from a man who blindly extols his own indifference, revenger and villain glancing off each-other, in a manner that reminded me of the crucial mutiny scene in Mutiny on the Bounty (1962) where Marlon Brando’s Fletcher Christian simply cannot quite erase the smug sureness of authority from Trevor Howard’s Captain Bligh even as he’s poking him with a sword and casting him adrift. One can see the sense of what Miller is aiming for here, but just as apparent is the truth he doesn’t quite pull it off. It feels like a product of a mismatch of attitudes Miller wants to put over: having been so heartily acclaimed for the female emancipation story in Fury Road, he wants to cling to the image of Furiosa as the blankly righteous avenger, but his deeper dramatic instincts want to wring the moment for something else, an exhaustion with the revenge motif in general and questioning what lies beyond it. The idea that Furiosa kills a part of herself to get what she’s after, just as Dementus once did, is certainly in play, but also remains at arm’s length.\n\nThe film ends, then, on a bold and challenging note. The History Man recounts what Furiosa told him about Dementus’s fate – that she staked him out in the Citadel garden and planted the Green Place seed under him, the tree growing literally up through his crotch and holding him like some kind of nature deity – a Green Man in exchange for a Green Place, his carcass otherwise kept from death by constant tending. It’s not made clear if and when he died, but the ending suggests he was still persisting when Furiosa leads the wives in escape as depicted in Fury Road. It’s a remarkable image to resolve on, appalling and sick and powerfully poetic – Miller engaging with the strangest motifs of mythology, coming right up to the edge of violating the boundary between the real and surreal that’s been persisting in his fictional universe since the start and bleeding over into something even strange and more primal. It is, at once, a touch that threatens to break Furiosa – A Mad Max Saga, but ultimately, in musing upon it, I realised actually makes it, and kicks it into a new stratum of achievement for Miller. It certainly won’t be his last film, and yet it would make an ideal emblem of his career, perched somewhere in the space between literal and symbolic, horrific and alluring, savage and intimate. It also confirms that for all the sturm-und-drang, Furiosa – A Mad Max Saga is, ironically, like Three Thousand Years of Longing a classic late movie from a director, cutting edge in style but an expression of an old soul longing for green shoots out of sullied, haggard flesh at the end of a long, exhausting, thrilling ride, an idea he implants in this movie in the strangest, most haunting way he can imagine.\n\n.\n\nDirector: Denis Villeneuve\n\nScreenwriters: Jon Spaihts, Denis Villeneuve\n\nBy Roderick Heath\n\nTwo and a half years since the first part of Denis Villeneuve’s bifurcated adaptation of Frank Herbert’s classic was released, the second comes charging out of the deep desert of current cinema-going, that vast and dread wasteland left to us by Hollywood. The first part came out amidst the throes of the COVID pandemic, managing to make a decent box office showing despite all that whilst gaining most of its viewers on streaming. Hardly the natural habitat for a pricey, spectacular science fiction epic, but it still made an impression on a mainstream audience plainly starved for big, ambitious genre filmmaking that doesn’t treat us all like eight-year-olds: if any property caught the first ripples of changing zeitgeist of that moment, more apparent now as the superhero movie craze rapidly wanes, it seems to have been Dune. An ironic fate for a movie adapted from a 1965 tome long described as unfilmable, with the previous example of David Lynch’s 1984 version usually offered as horrid warning for the unwary. Props to Villeneuve: for all my lack of passion for his vision in general and the way he applied it to Herbert’s story, he certainly seems to have pulled off a truly impressive feat in selling such an odd, byzantine story to a multiplex audience. This was particularly clear when I settled down to watch the second instalment, this time in the proper temple of a movie theatre, surrounded by a crowd of all ages. Doubly impressive given that the choice of splitting the book in half left the viewer at an important but unsatisfying dramatic juncture, but with the hook planted deep.\n\nThe upside of that choice was that much of what distinguishes Dune as a piece of fiction comes to fruition in its later portions. Those were portions that, for all its very real qualities, Lynch’s film couldn’t help but garble when trying squeeze it all into a workable whole – at least, once the Di Laurentiis editing was applied. The novel’s basic narrative structure of a young protagonist’s fall and rise, with the kind of messianic meaning behind his rise that’s long since become a mainstay of modern quasi-mythic storytelling, gave a solid narrative backbone to a tale that snakes and coils with weird and alien purpose in both key concepts and marginalia. So the second part of Dune was always going to be an intriguing proposition: having promised the audience the prospect of seeing Paul Atreides make common cause with the Fremen to avenge themselves upon the evil Harkonnens and win back control of the planet Arrakis, now they can be asked to wrap their heads around the novel’s most bizarre conceits running the gamut from high science fiction to far-out mysticism, from sentient unborn children to space-navigating mutants. Except that…well, I’ll get to that.\n\nDune: Part Two opens with confidence, at least: Paul (Timothée Chalamet) and mother Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) are being escorted to a Fremen underground city or ‘sietch,’ dodging and slaughtering Harkonnen soldiers sent out to hunt them down. At first they find themselves objects of suspicion and hatred as outsiders, especially as Paul has killed the Fremen Jamis (Babs Olusanmokun) in the duel that capped the previous movie. But both Atreides soon find their place amongst the Arrakeens in their different capacities. Jessica is asked to replace the sietch’s dying Reverend Mother, one of the Bene Gesserit sisterhood Jessica was trained by and who inculcates the populace with religious doctrines and prophecies whilst actually purveying social control and selective breeding. Paul for his part determines to school himself thoroughly in Fremen ways and prove a valuable fighter. Sietch elder Stilgar (Javier Bardem) is already thoroughly convinced he is the prophesised leader who will lead the Fremen to Holy War, whilst young warrior Chani (Zendaya), daughter of the murdered Imperial biologist Liet Kynes and a Fremen, maintains a sceptical attitude and wants more practical approaches to ridding their planet of the Harkonnen yolk despite her strong attraction to the young stranger.\n\nTheir disparate viewpoints of the same goal at least temporarily intersect in the form of Paul, as he proves not just a good fighter but a wily tactician and an object of increasingly fierce veneration by his fellow ‘Fedaykin’ or elite Fremen warriors, offering the promise of unifying all the Fremen tribes and unleashing them in a grand spree upon the universe: the Fremen look to him as the “Mahdi” and the “lisan al-glaib,” deliverer figures distinct from the concept of the “Kwisatz Haderach” that the Bene Gesserit have been breeding, although the distinction is never elucidated. As a Reverend Mother, Jessica helps further the cause by proselytising to deepen the apparent fulfilment of the prophecy, but the act of drinking “the Water of Life,” a by-product of the infant sandworms that infest Arrakis that works like intensely purified spice, to become a Reverend Mother has the unintended result not just of opening Jessica’s mind to being filled with the memories of other Bene Gesserits, but also her embryonic daughter. Meanwhile, the Emperor of the human universe (Christopher Walken) nurses his unease after having arranged for the Harkonnens to wipe out the Atreides; his daughter Irulan (Florence Pugh), also a pupil of the Bene Gesserit leader Mohiam (Charlotte Rampling), starts to tease out the truth of this discomforting plot. Mohiam in turn encourages Baron Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgård), increasingly irate over his kinsman Rabban’s (Dave Bautista) failure to bring the Fremen to heel, to instead place his vigorous but insane nephew Feyd-Rautha (Austin Butler) in charge of the suppression.\n\nFor about its first third, Dune: Part Two rolls on with a force and purpose that suggests it really knows what to do in picking up midway through a narrative, and, moreover, seems to have liberated something in Villeneuve stymied by his earlier Hollywood ventures. There’s a strong early action sequence as Harkonnen soldiers, hunting Paul, Jessica, and Stilgar’s warband, have the tables turned on them despite their attempts to take refuge on a high mesa: Paul takes out a soldier but leaves his back vulnerable to another, only for Jessica to fall on the enemy and beat them to death. The mixture of emotionally volatile frenzy and suspicion of the Fremen towards the two is deftly depicted, setting the scene for the difficult journey that lies ahead. Similarly potent in staging, if a tad illogical, is an action sequence where Rabban, losing his cool, leads his soldiers into an ambush in a sandstorm and finishes up fleeing before Paul back to his ornithopters, barely avoiding being slain by a Fremen assassin during the wild escape. Why Rabban and his people don’t have infrared scopes, or future version of such, for such actions is left vague, but the staging of the scene is certainly effective, with the punchline being Rabban’s expressions of shock and profound disquiet as he comprehends just how fanatical the force he’s opposing is.\n\nThe strong early portion of the movie culminates in the vital mythopoeic moment when Paul first dares to ride one of the colossal sandworms, a feat he needs to complete as part of his initiation as a Fremen, but which proves another building block in his growing mystique, when he uses a worm-attracting ‘thumper’ and draws in a truly colossal worm that he manages to steer. This sets the scene for a marvel of special effects entwined with dynamic camerawork and staging to intensify the desired immersive effect, describing vividly the fantastical notion of snaring hold of and being dragged along on the back of an enormous, primeval beast as it cleaves through the desert sand. This in turn sets up the most impressive of the movie’s visuals, the moment when any fan of the material will be anticipating, when the Fremen warriors ride into battle on the backs of the worms, crashing through hordes of Harkonnen and Imperial soldiers in an awesome vision of primal power and animal will overwhelming even the most fantastically advanced human protection.\n\nRather than carefully slice up and feed portions to the audience promising the evil still lying in wait for the Atreides and the Fremen, however, the narrative shifts focus to the Harkonnens for a long chunk of the movie, stalling the pace in a manner the entry never really recovers from. Villeneuve wants to make a real impression of the menace of Feyd-Rautha, as opposed to the glimpses of Sting looking bug-eyed in leather shorts in Lynch’s take, even if this version ultimately, similarly emphasises the character as villain beefcake. So we get an introduction of Feyd-Rautha with his latex-clad concubines, casually slicing throats of luckless underlings, in scenes that look like they were designed for a particularly fetishistic mid-1990s fashion mag spread. Despite the (relatively) cooler tone of Villeneuve’s filming and the acting by Skarsgård and Butler, they’re actually even more cartoonish than the takes on the Harkonnens than in Lynch’s film, sapped of all their intellectual as well as physical pith and ruthlessness, leering, growling, raping, and butchering at whim. Villeneuve and Spaihts make Feyd-Rautha a sort of melding of wicked Roman Emperor traits – crazy and capricious like Caligula, fond of gladiatorial combat like Commodus, a matricide like Nero. But the aspect that Lynch emphasised, in a motif he would go onto reiterate much more intricately in Mulholland Drive (2000), that Feyd-Rautha is Paul’s dark double, the projection of his id made flesh, and the alternative casting in the matinee idol of political theatre stakes, is utterly beyond Villeneuve’s literalist sensibility.\n\nSimilarly, the Baron’s peccadilloes have been given a slight updating and upgrading in grotesquery – where in the books he had a penchant for sadistically raping and killing young men, here he’s glimpsed with a stack of mangled pubescent girls in his chambers. Villeneuve returns to the images of Skarsgård swathed in fake fat and swimming in glistening oil-like fluid after enjoying rapine and murder, to make sure we know these are not nice people. The “black sun” of the Harkonnen’s home planet Giedi Prime is exploited as an excuse to desaturate the exterior sequences to a virtual black-and-white palette, increasing the fashion spread-gone-evil aesthetic, and Feyd-Rautha goes into gladiatorial combat with some luckless Atreides captives with his guard of genetically engineered mutant men as backup. To be fair, some of this is striking and effectively nasty, reminding the viewer that a universe ruled by the Harkonnens would be a nightmarish hellscape, and indeed one where they’re tolerated is already too close to that status as it is, in this future that’s regressed politically into feudalism. Not that Villeneuve has anything to say about that: it’s just a vaguely techno-Ruritanian backdrop for the plot, a convention Herbert took from classic space opera, converted into an actual idea and conceptual frame, gave birth in turn to a generic convention via the material’s children like Star Wars (1977), and now isn’t going to be converted back into an idea.\n\nPerhaps the most prominent victim of the adaptation’s choices and priorities is Herbert’s most bizarre and memorable creation of the early books, Paul’s sister Alia, who in the book is born as a fully sentient and cognisant Bene Gesserit. Regarded as an “abomination” by Mohiam for that reason and created contrary to all Bene Gesserit precepts, Alia plays a vital role in how the climax of family revenge plays out, presented as a mere vulnerable child to the Emperor and Harkonnen but able to kill Harkonnen with poison. The grown-up Alia is even more fundamental to the two follow-up novels, where she becomes the lover of the resurrected Duncan Idaho but is later possessed by the transmitted consciousness of her grandfather the Baron. Villeneuve keeps Alia to mere glimpses of her in a foetal state within her mother, having psychic conversations with her, and a brief appearance, in one of Paul’s prescient vision, of Anya Taylor-Joy playing the adult Alia – which is, admittedly, very apt casting. It’s not that surprising that Villeneuve would avoid the awkwardness of trying to realise the young Alia as a fully sentient and deadly toddler (although the very young Alicia Witt managed to play her in Lynch’s version to some effect), as well as trying to pare back the extra clutter of characters. But the fact that she’s absent but the narrative shoehorns in Lady Margot Fenring (Lea Seydoux), a scheming Bene Gesserit acolyte who seduces Feyd-Rautha to get pregnant by him, makes that excuse feel a bit flimsy. I felt like Alia’s absence was more intended to remove some of the eccentricity and the complexity from the work: she’s too definite a presentation of Herbertian strangeness and provocation to sit easily with Villeneuve’s efforts to demystify Paul and render the story into a more standard parable for the dangers of fanaticism and power politics, as well as something likely to make the current mass audience uncomfortable.\n\nVilleneuve’s cachet as a filmmaker to date – at least since he left behind French-Canadian art cinema for the heady climes of Hollywood – has been applying a formidable but facetious layer of stylisation to movies that proceed with highly programmatic and even banal dramatic beats. As made plain enough in previous films like Prisoners (2013) and Blade Runner 2049 (2017), Villeneuve has a love for diffused lightning, heavy filter work, and other atmospheric visual textures that recall the grand old days of Hollywood high style cinema from the 1980s but with a more contemporary spin. And, yes, compared to the sleek, almost painfully coherent and featureless style of CGI delivered to us by superhero movies in the past few years, Dune: Part Two does suggest new paths for contemporary visual effects to take. Villeneuve wields such texturing here, enabled again by cinematographer Greig Fraser, with intent to enrich the narrative with some sense of connection in the imagery – the way, for instance, he pays attention to the flicker of erupting fireworks penetrating the cavernous interiors of the Harkonnen citadel where Feyd-Rautha walks rhymes with a later moment when Paul and Chani spy the strobing light from artillery unleashed upon a Fremen sietch, marking the coming of Feyd-Rautha’s wrath to Arrakis.\n\nVilleneuve meanwhile swathes Ferguson so often in cosmic chadors, hoods, and jewellery, and painted over with cabalistic lettering, that I started to wonder if he was indulging some sort of atavistic fetish, but decided that’s too interesting for him. This, even as Jessica’s role is minimised, with some of her dramatic function handed over to Chani. Villeneuve and his special effects team are sparing throughout Dune: Part Two, an episode where the source material was always going to offer up manna to the visually-oriented filmmaker. The desert filming is more effective in this movie than its precursor, with Fraser allowing more colour and texture to certain shots, the sands of Arrakis sometimes bleached and cheerless, other times permeated with lush ochres and governed by skies as blue as the eyes of the spice-gorged Fremen. And yet there’s something fascinatingly inert about the bulk of Villeneuve’s imagery, for all its polish and conceptual grandeur. There’s nothing expressive about it. Except for flashes here and there I gained no real feeling of entrance into a grand fantastical universe, but like that universe was being conveyed in the language of the kind of crisp digital gritty-pretty gloss of video games and AI-generated artworks. Only the repeated image of the titanic worm charging through the sand, one Villeneuve knows is dynamite and repeats at the very end, wields a truly arresting sense of might and transcendent power. A feeling of detachment permeates the film as a whole, and it stems from a more fundamental problem of attitude than simply to Villeneuve’s hyper-fussy aesthetics.\n\nAs an adaptation of a book, Dune: Part Two proves a crushing disappointment. Instead of Harkonnen’s comeuppance coming from an unexpected, mildly shocking and memorable place, it’s accomplished in the film in the most desultory terms. For any fans of the novel and its follow-ups hoping for more of the essential detail to make the cut this time, there is still no mention of the Butlerian Jihad or the Spacing Guild, or so much of the book’s imaginitive infrastructure. Just exactly why the spice is so important to this fictional world is left so fuzzy and poorly described that I’m not really sure anyone watching either part of Villeneuve’s diptych and who hasn’t read the books will have any real idea of it, beyond being a quasi-magical MacGuffin. The process of extracting the Water of Life from a young sandworm is shown in well-filmed detail, but the actual connection between the worms and the spice isn’t elucidated, and so the way it’s deeply wound in with Paul’s apotheosis is utterly garbled. The revelation that Jessica is actually Harkonnen’s daughter is dropped with all the grace of a soap opera. It’s always a delight to see Walken in a film and yet he’s oddly ineffectual as the Emperor: Villeneuve seems to have wanted him to embody the haunting, exhausting nature of vast power, rather than mere malice, but the necessary sense of a Machiavellian nature operating almost in spite of itself never comes across, partly because, well, Walken is getting a bit old. The crucial exchange between Paul and the Emperor in the climactic confrontation, when the Emperor coolly informs Paul that his father Duke Leto’s humane streak was exactly his weakness, fails to land as sharply as it should because Villeneuve doesn’t seem to have any clear emotion he wants Walken to express beyond the quality of being Walken.\n\nMore conspicuously, Dune: Part Two might well be the apotheosis of an increasingly depressing trend in modern genre storytelling where it’s assumed that underlying subtext or real-world blueprint of the generic metaphors are in some fashion the “true” meaning of what’s going on, and therefore anything that breaks down the distance in terms of interpretation is only dispensing with a nicety. In this paradigm genre storytelling only exists to sell ideas and messages to the great unwashed. Whereas the great power of genre metaphor is precisely the way it generalises, transforming aspects of reality into functional abstractions that can change and develop other meanings over time. In specific terms of Dune: Part Two, this means that Villeneuve has done his absolute best to ensure that we all know that Herbert’s story is a metaphor for oil dependency and the Fremen are not a future race eight millennia and millions of light years removed from us with retained aspects of the cultures that fed into their identity, but slightly coded representatives of Middle Eastern and other hard-done-by populaces. Leaving aside the faintly racist absurdity behind the assumption that a horde of Arabic people were just itching to up sticks and shift holus bolus to a whole planet of desert to hang out on, Villeneuve and Spaihts ram home the similarity to contemporary problems by inventing a new aspect to Herbert’s Fremen society by referring to certain sectors of the Fremen as “fundamentalists,” a word not used in the book and with no equivalent either. The Fremen in the book had their own, peculiar culture and interpretations of the religious ideas common to the Empire as disseminated by the Bene Gesserit, but they weren’t bumpkins. Villeneuve on the other hand subdivides them, between those who are bumpkins and those who, as represented by Chani, are more cosmopolitan (the film elides the fact that Chani herself is the product of personal and cultural mating, too). The film portrays Stilgar as a zealot and gullible stooge for the messianic project, rather than the serious and stalwart warrior in the book, now the kind of true believer who sees even Paul’s casual denials of being the Mahdi as proof he is – moments that, at least, give the film some of its few moments of ironic levity.\n\nChalamet, to his credit, grows nicely into the role of Paul in his second outing: if he didn’t wield a newly voluble and mature intensity as Paul takes command when confronting the Fremen elders after drinking the Water of Life, the film would fail entirely, but he delivers, even if he’s still not exactly the second coming of Kirk Douglas when whipping up the Fremen for battle. The completeness of the character’s transformation from the gangly manor-born whelp of the first film to the coldly victorious warlord by the end of the second is most coherently conveyed by his presence. The script however lets him down in too many ways. Whilst Paul isn’t displaced in narrative function, exactly, the film disengages from his experience when it really needs to be weaving its way deeply into his viewpoint to put across his blend of increasing desperation and hardening purpos"
