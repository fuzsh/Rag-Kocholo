        "text": "By Jeremy Miles\n\nI receved a message from my friend the Folkestone Mermaid today. I say ‘my friend’ but if truth be told we’ve never actually met. She just feels like a friend and as a stalwart champion of my old home town, seems to support all the right concerns for its future.\n\nGeorgina Baker, a Folkestone mum of two, was the model chosen by Cornelia Parker to fulfil a commission for the town’s second Arts Triennial back in 2011.\n\nCast in lifesize bronze but in Mermaid form she has now sat at the end of The Stade on a granite boulder beside the fishermen’s harbour wall keeping a watchful eye on the ever-changing seascape and out towards the horizon for the past 13 years.\n\nOriginally conceived as a reinterpretation of Copenhagen’s ‘Little Mermaid’ and inspired by HG Wells’ story of The Sea Lady and Hans Christian Anderson’s famous fairy tale, Parker decided that rather than a literal copy of the Copenhagen Mermaid she wanted to base the work on a real person.\n\nShe invited local residents to apply and Baker was chosen from a shortlist of six. It was a good choice. Not only has the Folkestone Mermaid become a noted feature of the town loved by residents and visitors alike, but Georgina Baker has taken her duties extremely seriously. She now sees herself as a kind of custodian of the history, heritage and traditions of Folkestone and particularly the harbour area. Hence her message earlier today which regards the controversial development plans for massive blocks of residential flats extending along the seafront to the Harbour Arm.\n\nIn a Block the Blocks message she urges us to protest further over the size, design and location of the monstrous plan and encourages people to add more signatures to the petition that she started last year.\n\nMany of us have already lodged complaints over the hideously inappropriate size, design and location of the project and Georgina’s message alerted us to a new planning application seeking imminent approval of existing details. I did not take much persuading.\n\nThese flats which have already been described as looking like something out of the Flintstones are simply wrong. To build them on the harbour site would visually destroy the character of the area and swamp it with a wholly over-intensive influx of residents. It would drive business away from the town centre and clog the seafront with traffic. It would look horrible and be a disaster.\n\nAs someone who was born and brought up in Folkestone and into a well-known family with local links dating back more than 200 years, this is important to me. Even though I haven’t lived there for nearly four decades, I worked in the town, got married there and had ancestors in the fishing community who helped man the local lifeboat and others who were customs officers and even possible smugglers. I have continued to visit Folkestone regularly. I care deeply for it and think that most of the developments that have seen it evolve into one of the most popular seaside locations on the south coast have been wonderful but these flats are a step too far and risk undoing all the good that has been achieved so far.\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nWalking through Barbara Hepworth’s strange and wonderful sub-tropical garden in St Ives it’s hard to imagine that it was once little more than a working space where the sculptor created some of the most radical works of the 20th century.\n\nThe lush exotic plants and swaying palms that provide such a magical setting for her powerful and instantly recognisable sculptures seem to have been there for ever. They delight the tens of thousands of visitors who each year seek out Trewyn Studio, her old home, long preserved as The Hepworth Museum and Sculpture Garden.\n\nIt’s easy to assume that it was this garden as much as the discreet facility offered by the studio’s town-centre location that drew Hepworth here in 1949. After all she’s inextricably linked with the place. She lived, worked and eventually died at Trewyn. Her death at the age of 72 was caused by a fire believed to have been started by a dropped cigarette. It sealed her association with this house. To this day her studio remains frozen in time exactly as she left it. The date of her death – May 20th, 1975 – is still on the wall calendar.\n\nIn fact her initial interest in Trewyn was purely in finding a suitable space to work. She had just separated from her second husband the painter Ben Nicholson and had been invited to produce two major commissions for the forthcoming Festival of Britain. Trewyn was the perfect answer.\n\nHepworth had enjoyed a growing reputation among the artistic elite in London but the birth of triplets – Simon, Rachel and Sarah – and the outbreak of World War II had temporarily derailed a glittering career.\n\nAs German bombs threatened to rain down on the capital she and Nicholson decided to move their family to the relative safety of Cornwall.\n\nLiving in Carbis Bay they soon became central to what would become St Ives’ golden era as an artist’s colony. It wasn’t always easy. Nicholson could be autocratic and controlling and Hepworth, not the easiest person herself, was forced to put domestic chores before art.\n\nThe breakdown of the marriage and the move to Trewyn gave her the freedom to fight her way back into the public eye. With international success came the opportunity to re-model her working environment and in the mid-1950s Hepworth set about transforming the blank canvas that was the Trewyn garden. Over the next few years it slowly turned into what author Miranda Phillips, an authority on the garden, describes as “almost a showroom for potential buyers and people who might commission her.”\n\nTo achieve this Hepworth took advice from her good friend the modernist composer Priaulx Ranier and also Will Arnold-Forster who had established a marvellous garden at Eagles Nest, the house high above Zennor that would later become the home of the artist Patrick Heron. Arnold-Forster was a well-travelled retired Colonel who had written the influential 1948 book Shrubs for Milder Counties. Ranier meanwhile possessed an encyclopaedic knowledge of plants both from her native South Africa and across the New World. Hepworth could count on extraordinarily informed advice to help plant a garden that would perfectly combine the beauty of natural forms with the strange power of her stone and bronze sculptures.\n\nA wonderful mixture of the traditional and exotic gradually took form as the garden was landscaped and planted with fan palms, bamboo, honeysuckle magnolia, eucalyptus, Japanese anemones and roses. Rockeries were built, paths laid and an old pond rescued and given new life. The result combined with Hepworth’s sculptures was a mesmerising display of colour and form that continues to evolve to this day.\n\nMiranda Phillips worked with the Tate and Hepworth Museum for many years. She is the author of Barbara Hepworth Sculpture Garden (Tate Publishing). Written with former Tate curator Chris Stephenson, the book was developed from a popular guide she had put together after being constantly quizzed about the plants in the garden by visitors to the museum.\n\nIt follows the plants at Trewyn through the seasons, examining their relationship with Hepworth’s sculptures. “People are constantly fascinated by the garden,” she told me. “Hepworth certainly used it to impress potential buyers but the sculptures she sited here were very much her own favourites. Phillips believes that Hepworth used the garden – “with its spiky primeval forms and the ancient nature of some of her sculptures” – as a source of inspiration. “Placing her works in this setting with the interplay of light,shadow and movement allowed her to see how different sorts of light and even dry and wet conditions would work on the sculptures. I’m sure it influenced her art.”\n\nOn a bigger scale the rugged and ancient Cornish landscape was her inspiration too. Hepworth had originally fallen in love with large sweeping vistas as a child in Yorkshire. In Cornwall she was able to rediscover the feel for weathered rock, lichen and windswept heathland that had been hardwired into her infant soul. Trees twisted by the wind and storm lashed beaches provided a wealth of material.\n\nDespite her great achievements – internationally feted as an artist and made a Dame of the British Empire in 1965 – Hepworth did not have an easy life. Her work was physically tough and she also endured two divorces, the death of an adult child ( her eldest son Paul died in an air crash in Singapore in 1954) and terrible health problems. By the end of her life she had received treatment for throat cancer, was almost crippled by a fractured hip and her hands were full of arthritis. She was also heavily dependent on pain killers and drinking heavily.\n\n“I think she ran on nervous energy, drove herself terribly hard and wasn’t particularly interested in physical comfort,” says Phillips. “Beyond her work she didn’t have much time left for living.”\n\nThe general assumption is that the fire that caused her death was an inferno, the final ghastly chapter in an increasingly miserable existence. Phillips sees it slightly differently. “There was actually very little fire. It caught some plastic.” She believes Hepworth was probably already asleep and succumbed to fumes. “To be honest life wasn’t getting any more pleasant. She was already in great pain and she wasn’t going to get better. In those circumstances, to die in the place that you love surrounded by the things that you love is no bad thing.”\n\n*Visit the Barbara Hepworth Museum & Sculpture Garden at Barnoon Hill, St Ives, Cornwall TR26 1AD www.tate.org.uk/stives The book Barbara Hepworth Sculpture Garden by Miranda Phillips & Chris Stephens was first published in 2002 and reprinted last year.\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nBy Jeremy Miles\n\nA rare combination of prodigious talent, intuitive understanding and carefully honed skill made equestrian artist Lucy Kemp-Welch one of the finest painters of her generation.\n\nSadly, although her star did indeed shine brightly for many years, history was not on her side. Born into a well-to-do Bournemouth family in 1869, she lived through an era marked by war and burgeoning modernity. It was a world dominated by men. Making an impact as a female artist was far from easy. Socially and politically the cards were stacked against her.\n\nShe found fame while still in her 20s and exhibited her first painting, Gypsy Horse Drovers, at the prestigious Royal Academy in London when she was just 26 years old. But it was two years later when her huge painting Colt Hunting in the New Forest was exhibited at the RA’s 1897 Summer Exhibition that the name Lucy Kemp-Welch really started to get noticed by the art establishment,. Stunned by its size, power and detail, critics predicted great things for this extraordinary young woman.\n\nKemp-Welch would hang many more notable paintings at the RA over the coming decades and also enjoyed a certain level of celebrity as the illustrator of the 1915 edition of Anna Sewell’s best-selling novel Black Beauty.\n\nHowever, suggestions that she was on course to become the first woman since the mid-18th century to be officially admitted as a Royal Academician never came to fruition and by the time of her death in the late 1950s the name of Lucy Kemp-Welch was being sidelined.\n\nThankfully much has been done in recent years to restore her reputation as one of the towering if largely forgotten artistic talents of the 20th century and now a major retrospective is being staged at the Russell-Cotes Art Gallery and Museum in Bournemouth.\n\nIt could not be a more appropriate location because it not only brings the work of Kemp-Welch back to the town of her birth but also the one-time home of art collector and philanthropist Merton Russell-Cotes who was one of her early supporters.\n\nThis wide-ranging and impressive exhibition, In Her Own Voice: The Art of Lucy Kemp-Welch (1869–1958) will be in Bournemouth until mid-October and then moves to the National Horse Racing Museum in Newmarket until January 2024. It is curated by art historian, David Boyd Haycock and focuses on key works and moments in Kemp-Welch’s long and illustrious career.\n\nIt explores the early influence of her life on the south coast and childhood trips to the New Forest, her unstinting commitment to her art and the teaching of the eccentric but brilliant German-born Hubert von Herkomer whose art school she attended in Bushey, Hertfordshire. She admired the school so much that when Herkomer retired in 1906 she took it over becoming the first woman to run a British art school for both male and female students.\n\nHerkomer had believed that for Kemp-Welch to capture the real essence of the horses she painted she should spend weeks studying the animals close-up in the woods and fields of the English countryside. She responded with great enthusiasm establishing the lifelong work practices that would produce some truly stunning paintings. Among them was location painting where she would capture scenes of timber hauling or hunting using massive mobile canvases in weather-proof boxes.\n\nAs the name of this exhibition suggests, it is the paintings that really do the talking. The sheer power and majesty of works like Burnt Out Fires, showing three working horses returning home across stubble-burnt fields or the struggle and urgency captured in The Call with horses straining to drag a lifeboat into a furious foaming sea are breathtaking.\n\nThroughout the show, Kemp-Welch’s mastery of colour, light and energy and her deep understanding of everything equine from sinew and muscle to the behavioural quirks of the horses she paunted is displayed again and again.\n\nThere were many intriguing twists and turns in her life and career. For several years she would spend each summer following the famous Sanger’s circus around the country and painting their horses. Solidly respectable and widely admired she was nonetheless distinctly unconventional.\n\nThough she was, as David Boyd Haycock has noted, neither a suffragette nor a feminist, Kemp-Welch was clearly not prepared to be restricted by her gender. During the First World War she volunteered to go to the front as an official war artist but had to be satisfied with painting the British Army’s training exercises on Salisbury Plain instead.\n\nThe war work, including some recruitment posters, is a minor diversion and of scant importance besides the quality of her major paintings. Viewed from a contemporary perspective, it seems rather distasteful, drumming up cannon fodder for the carnage of the First World War although at the time Kemp-Welch would have simply seen it as doing her bit for King and country. It also helps put her life and career into some kind of historical context that goes at least some way to explaining why she faded from the public eye.\n\nBritain in the 20th century was oppressively patriarchal. Battered by two world wars and a major recession, it was an age driven by the need to rebuild. Engineering and industry were prime and even the working beasts of Kemp-Welch’s world were being rapidly replaced by a variety of horseless carriages.\n\nBy the time she reached her final years, her work was simply out of step with the times. Perhaps that point is driven home by the fact that the landmark event on the London art scene in the year that she died was a big Jackson Pollock show. Thankfully we now have an art world where the modernist and traditional can be studied, admired and enjoyed with equal intellectual rigour.\n\nThere is much to think about at this Lucy Kemp-Welch exhibition. I guess you will leave the show not only impressed by her astounding paintings but also newly aware of what an extraordinary individual she was.\n\n*In Her Own Voice: The Art of Lucy Kemp-Welch (1869–1958) ran at the Russell-Cotes Art Gallery and Museum in Bournemouth earlier this year and is currently at the National Horse Racing Museum in Newmarket until 25th February 2024\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nBy Jeremy Miles\n\nAnyone of a certain age who grew up in the countryside, particular in a beautiful county like Dorset will have memories of playing among fields and trees surrounded by the wonder of plants and wildlife.\n\nWhen the Oxford Junior Dictionary decided to drop a series of ‘nature words’ from its pages arguing that they were no longer relevant to childhood there was not surprisingly an outcry.\n\nIn a bid to get the dictionary to reconsider its position, a campaign was launched by writers including such literary giants as Margaret Atwood and Andrew Motion.\n\nConsigned to the lexicographical dustbin were words like acorn, adder, bluebell, dandelion, and catkin. There were many others. In came broadband, blog, chat-room, celebrity and voicemail. It seemed like an attack on the very tradition of healthy outdoor play. Some felt it was actively encouraging solitary indoor childhoods.\n\nNo one was more appalled than the writer, poet and academic Robert Macfarlane. A life-long nature lover and activist, he teamed up with artist and illustrator Jackie Morris to produce The Lost Words, a celebration of the names of plants, birds and animals that were deemed no longer worthy of inclusion in the Junior Dictionary.\n\nWhen it was first published in 2017 the book became a near-instant bestseller and has now been translated into several languages, and adapted for film, drama, dance, radio, classical music and folk song.\n\nIt even inspired a grassroots movement to put a copy in every primary school in England, Wales and Scotland with Dorset campaigners at the forefront of local funding and distribution.\n\nA touring Lost Words exhibition organised by Compton Verney, with Hamish Hamilton and Penguin Books visited venues nationwide including the Russell-Cotes Art Gallery and Museum here in Bournemouth.\n\nSuitable for all ages, it featured 20 acrostic “spell-poems” alongside the 50 watercolour and gold-leaf paintings that were used to create the original book. It combined Robert Macfarlane’s poetic words and Jackie Morris’s artwork in a show that harnessed the power of nature and love of language. It celebrated the magic of the natural world and reclaimed those words that, at the stroke of an editor’s pen, were ditched as irrelevancies.\n\nI took the opportunity to talk to the authors about their passionate campaign to save these vital connections to the natural world. This is what I wrote. It originally appeared in an article published in Dorset magazine last year.\n\nIt seems the protests to the Oxford Junior Dictionary fell on deaf ears. “I’m afraid the dictionary’s response was ‘It’s none of your business. It’s our editorial decision,’ says Jackie. “We thought we can make a book that will reverse this.”\n\nThey hadn’t realised that no sooner had the book been published than the project would begin to take on a life of its own. “Not in my wildest dreams could I have foreseen what the book would become, admits Robert. “It’s as though Jackie and I just planted an acorn and up rushed a wild-wood. It has become a movement that has been taken on by other people and institutions. It’s not really ours anymore. It’s been used in schools all over the British Isles and even featured in a prom concert at the Albert Hall. None of it could have been foreseen.”\n\nHe stresses that he doesn’t regard the loss of so many evocative words as the fault of the dictionary. “It is culture or society’s fault. This separation of our lives and our imaginations from everyday nature has become very pronounced.”\n\nIt is, he believes, a symptom of the “ecological chaos and precarity” we are living through. “If we are going to get out of this we need to begin at the beginning. We have to grow our way out of it by learning the names of the creatures and plants we share our everyday lives with and then teach them to the children.”\n\nRobert and Jackie both speak with delight about the effect their stories, images, spells and poems, can have on young hearts and minds.\n\n“Kids hunger for the utterly beautiful stuff that is right on the doorstep,” says Jackie. “They love getting muddy and watching insects and birds. We are giving them a tool with which they can re-wild their parents.”\n\nShe argues that children are naturally visually literate and understand the words and pictures in The Lost Words in an intuitive way.\n\n“Adults can take five, six or seven readings to realise what is going on. Kids get it right away. They understand the value of natural beauty before they learn about money but then everything goes belly up.”\n\nJackie describes herself as “an anarchist and anti-capitalist”. I venture that it must be a little awkward when the cheques roll in. Jackie laughs: “You know what? It’s lovely being able to give it away. It’s a question of knowing when you’ve got enough and when to share rather than hoard.”\n\nShe’s 61 and feels lucky to have found success relatively late in life. She says that 40 years of working as a freelance artist and illustrator has given her valuable life experience.\n\n“It has equipped me with the nous to stand my ground and not be pigeon-holed by anyone. I raised two kids as a single mother using only my brush and pen. I always had to worry about how to pay the bills until The Lost Words. Now it looks after me, bless it.”\n\nRobert comes from a rather different background. He is a 47-year-old multi-award-winning writer, a Fellow of Emmanuel Colledge, Cambridge, and widely known for his books on nature and landscape.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal has described him as “the great nature writer and nature poet of this generation” and in 2018 he co-edited, with Chris Packham and Patrick Barkham, A People’s Manifesto For Wildlife, arguing for urgent and large-scale change in Britain’s relationship with nature. Ten thousand people marched on Whitehall to deliver it to the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs.\n\n“Access to nature is a political issue. It’s an economic issue and that is why the book has become associated in many cases with activism and protest,” he says.\n\n“We want to bring childhood and the natural world back together again. Children are naturals with nature. They are wondernauts. They make up their own names and make up their own stories. Every day we receive photographs and videos of children working with the book in their schools or home education settings and it is lovely to see the creativity that has been drummed out of much of schooling by successive governments sneaking back in.”\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nSiamese Boatman: Photograph from 1865/66 negative by John Thomson.Wellcome Collection, London.\n\nBy Jeremy Miles\n\nIt is wonderful to see the remarkable work of pioneering Victorian photojournalist and travel photographer John Thomson back on the walls at Bournemouth’s Russell-Cotes Art Gallery and Museum.\n\nA new exhibition Siam: Through the Lens of John Thomson (1865-1866) openedat the clifftop museum last week and will run until April next year. It features a powerful and insightful collection of images captured in Siam and Cambodia nearly 160 years ago.\n\nIn a series of extraordinary photographs curated from the renowned archive of glass negatives at the Wellcome Collection in London, the exhibition offers a unique glimpse of life in 19th-century Southeast Asia. The images are of particular interest partly because they reveal a glimpse of living history but also because of their sheer quality produced at a time when such achievements must have seemed close to impossible.\n\nGallery-goers first saw Thomson’s groundbreaking work at the Russell-Cotes five years ago when the museum staged an exhibition of photographs he had taken in China during his mid 19th century travels.\n\nBoth shows are the result of this resourceful and talented Scotsman’s grasp of the possibilities offered by the practice of photography at a time when it was still in its infancy. Thomson had quickly become a master of the art and with finely honed technical, creative and social skills he managed to gain entry to what to the British public at the time was an unseen world.\n\nAngkor Wat: Photograph by John Thomson from 1865/66 negative.Wellcome Collection, London\n\nHis eagle-eyed attention to detail produced exquisite studies of the people, their costumes, architecture, customs, rituals and traditions. He even received special permission to visit Cambodia’s Angkor Wat (then under Siam’s control), becoming the first person to photograph its famous ruins. Ironically his Siamese hosts are said to have considered him quite mad to want to photograph a bunch of broken old temples.\n\nHis photographs reveal never before recorded details of far-off societies captured in images of extraordinary detail and breathtaking definition. They contain a wealth of anthropological and historical information.\n\nTo get his pictures Thomson had to make long, arduous journeys involving weeks of planning and negotiations and the transportation of heavy and cumbersome cameras, tanks of toxic chemicals and a huge portable darkroom.\n\nLooking at the prints on show at the Russell-Cotes it is clear that his charismatic and engaging personality helped open the door to some very special areas of Siamese society, even the Royal Household of the legendary monarch Rama V – King Mongkut. Yup that was him immortalised in the musical The King and I, though it’s probably best you don’t mention this in polite Thai society.\n\nThe country’s authorities took great exception to what they felt was a less than respectful portrayal of their ruler by the actor Yul Brynner in the 1956 film and it was promptly banned in Thailand, remaining officially blacklisted to this day.\n\nOf course, present-day Thailand ( it changed its name from Siam in the 1930s) is a long-time favourite destination on the British tourist trail and as such the subject of literally millions of point-and-shoot smartphone shots.\n\nScrolling through your Instagram feed, it is worth remembering that to achieve so much more, Thomson travelled more than 5,000 miles loaded up with his massive camera and bulky glass-plates that then had to be coated with wet collodion emulsion before an exposure – often of several seconds or more – could be made. It was a far from simple process.\n\nKing Mongkut. Photograph by John Thomson from 1865/66 negative.Wellcome Collection, London.\n\nPerhaps the most astonishing thing about these photographs though is the simple fact that they survived. In old age and suffering from frail health, Thomson was desperate to find a home for his archive. He contacted the pharmaceutical tycoon Sir Henry Wellcome and offered to sell him his collection of 700 or so plates. Negotiations were still underway when in 1921 at the age of 84 Thomson died of a heart attack. Fortunately the Wellcome Library still took possession of the collection which was contained in three crates and, probably more by luck than judgement, stored them in conditions that just happened to suit the fragile negatives.\n\nIn 1980 the crates were re-opened and test prints were made. After 60 years they were a little battered and scratched but essentially in surprisingly good condition. When finally digitised and printed as large, high-quality images for exhibition many of the scratches, marks and scuffs were left untouched. The effect is both atmospheric and strangely enhancing giving Thomson’s photographs a unique sense of time and place and an undeniable stamp of authenticity.\n\n*Siam: Through the Lens of John Thomson (1865-1866) is at Russell-Cotes Art Gallery and Museum in Bournemouth until April 2024.

She hung out with the ‘mole people’, the homeless activists who lived in the disused subway tunnels and sewers beneath the city. Of course, that didn’t faze Andy Warhol. Crazy creatives were good for business. The more the merrier.\n\nWhat happened next however changed the course of art history and is still having repercussions nearly 60 years later. Podber, dressed to the nines and accompanied by her dog, Carmen Miranda, spotted a stack of recently completed Marilyn Monroe paintings of varying colours leaning against the studio wall.\n\nIndicating her camera, she politely asked Warhol if she could shoot them. He agreed and, carefully putting on a pair of gloves, she reached into her bag, pulled out a small revolver and fired straight into the stack hitting Marilyn bang between the eyes.\n\nA horrified Warhol watched as she walked out of studio and inspected the damage. He quickly let it be known that Podber woud not be welcome at The Factory again. Four of his five Marilyns had been in that pile. One red, one orange and two blue. They would become known as The Shot Marilyns and, with their bizarre provenance, gradually spiralled in price.\n\nSo it was that earlier this month Shot Sage Blue Marilyn was auctioned by Christie’s in New York and sold for $195 million, the highest price ever paid at auction for a work by an American artist. The purchaser was international art dealer Larry Gagosian, thought to have been buying on behalf of an as yet unnamed purchaser.\n\nAt the time of Podber’s impromptu attack, which she later claimed was a Happening, a work of performance art, Warhol’s star was beginning to the rise – his Campbells Soup cans had already brought him major publicity – but his Marilyn Monroe paintings had yet to acquire their iconic status. He had decided to produce them after the shock of Monroe’s apparent suicide in 1962 provided him with a one-stop cocktail of his favourite subjects – scandal, death and glamour. He based the image on a publicity shot of the actress used for the 1953 film Niagara.\n\nHad he sold them at the time they would have fetched no more than a few hundred dollars. He may even have given them away. Three years later, in 1967, prices were rising and the soon to become famous and very rich art collector Peter Brandt paid $5,000 dollars for the other Shot Blue Marilyn. He was just 20-years-old at the time and it was the start of a multi-million dollar collection of art.\n\nWarhol’s reputation was on the up and prices were rising at astonishing speed. Although he was undoubtedly a shrewd operator, quite how much Andy Warhol managed to manipulate his own artistic destiny is unclear. There has been inevitable speculation that he knew that Podber was going to shoot the paintings and perhaps even paid her to do so. I think not. No one could have predicted the eventual outcome and if Warhol had merely wanted to generate publicity, a bullet through just one painting would have done the trick.\n\nI think the biggest mistake people make when hearing that a painting has sold for nearly $200 million is to imagine that it really must be of unsurpassed quality. ‘A Mona Lisa for the 21st Century’ screamed one headline.\n\nSadly at this level, art sales have more to do with the prestige of a small circle of obscenely wealthy dealers and collectors who almost certainly care more about the saleability of work than its actual quality.\n\nAt times of stock market volatility, the top-end of the art world provides a lucrative refuge for a certain type of investor by keeping the prices ludicrously high. It’s got little to do with art though.\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nTwo huge Harris Hawks outside sculptor Geoffrey Dashwood’s Hampshire home\n\nHere’s another one I did earlier. Well several years back actually. Probably around 2012. It was written for the now long-gone Compass Magazine and offered an intriguing insight into the curious world of New Forest sculptor Geoffrey Dashwood. Thought it was worth revisiting.\n\n*********\n\nBy Jeremy Miles\n\nInternationally renowned wildlife sculptor Geoffrey Dashwood is an anomaly in an art world full of pretensions and psycho-babble. His works – stunning sculptures of birds – sell across the world, often for tens of thousands of pounds, yet he would rather have teeth pulled than have to play the gallery game. He prefers to work remotely at his home deep in the Hampshire countryside outside Ringwood. Perched on the edge of an escarpment with views for 30 miles across Hampshire and Dorset, it’s an otherworldly place.\n\nSurrounded by monumental bronze sculptures – a one-and-half ton,12 foot tall Peregrine falcon dominates the entrance – the Dashwood home is a marvel to behold. As you walk across the lawn there are are two huge Harris hawks, a barn owl, a tern, a great crested grebe and a frog. A massive Mandarin drake sits on a plinth in the middle of a pond: “We built the pond for the sculpture rather than the other way around,” says the 66-year-old artist matter-of-factly.\n\nNestling amidst ancient forest, the natural setting of this house is astonishing too. He points to a huge gnarled old oak which is believed to be 700 years old. “Incredible to think that that was an acorn in about 1300,” he says.\n\nThe site is even believed to have been used for beacons warning of the approach of the Spanish Armada. Dashwood has lived there with his wife Val and three sons Leo, Max and James for 17 years. He says he really can’t imagine being anywhere else.\n\nDespite his international reputation and prices that range from £2,000 to £250,000, he eschews most private views and even tries to avoid discussing works with potential buyers. “I’m a rebellious old sod,”he told me as we looked around the huge studio and home gallery that he has built in a barn just yards from his front door. Sucking on a liquorice paper roll-up and swearing like a proverbial trooper, he warmed to his theme. “I don’t do commissions because to be honest I am too awkward and bloody-minded. They all too often end in tears because the person commissioning the piece and the artist have a different idea about the end result. So it’s very, very simple. I just do exactly what I want to do and then offer the work for sale.”\n\nChippy and uncompromising he may be but Geoffrey Dashwood’s prickly exterior clearly masks a sensitive soul who deeply cares that his work is an honest response to the natural world that he loves. Hampshire born and bred, he has a rare affinity with the New Forest and in his youth worked there as a keeper. Although he won a scholarship to art school in Southampton when he was just 15-years-old, he dropped out within weeks. “I hated it,” he says. The Forestry Commission provided the only job he could hang onto. “Basically I‘m absolutely unemployable,” he explains.\n\nDoing artwork for forestry brochures provided some personal satisfaction. He seized the moment and left to go freelance. Amazingly Dashwood didn’t turn to sculpture until he was in his mid 30s. He modelled a tiny English partridge and loved the whole process. With a £5,000 loan from the kind of bank manager that doesn’t exist anymore he made a series of bronze castings and touted his work around upmarket outlets in London – Harrods, Aspreys, Garrards and the galleries of Cork Street.\n\nThinking about it now he says he’s amazed that he had the nerve to walk into such elitist emporiums and demand to see the bronze buyer. Somehow it paid off. He was on his way. Initially he concentrated on miniatures but then moved on to life-size and monumental sculptures. The one-man shows and international reputation soon followed.\n\nHe has successfully experimented with abstracting the fine detail of the birds down to studies of pure sculptural form. He has also explored the effects that can be achieved with multi-coloured patinas. He recalls eyebrows being raised when he asked at the foundry that he used what would happen if he splattered a mixture of all three commonly used chemicals – liver sulphate, ferric nitrate and cupric nitrate – on his bronzes.\n\n“They were horrified. They said ‘You can’t do that’ and I just said ‘Oh yeah, and where’s the book that says I can’t?’ We went ahead and it was brilliant. It’s incredible that no one had ever done that before, but that’s the conservatism of the art world for you.”\n\nHe knows he’s been lucky, gaining a rare reputation and enjoying success despite a stubborn refusal to bend to the whims of either clients or art professionals.\n\n“I’ve had a very self-indulgent life,” says Dashwood. “The extraordinary thing is that logically choosing to do this kind of sculpture should have involved a compromise between what I want to do and what the market price demands. I discovered that the more self-indulgent I became the more the market would rise to it.”\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nBy Jeremy Miles\n\nTHE gang’s all there. Mad Tracey Emin from Margate with her trashed bed, dodgy Damien Hirst from Leeds with his dismembered animals … Then there’s Marcus Harvey’s portrait of Moors Murderer Myra Hindley constructed from the handprints of children and Marc Quinn’s sculptural self-portrait made out of several litres of his own frozen blood. It’s hard to imagine how much of a furore these not-so-young British artists have managed to cause with these and other radical works over recent years. Their art has been attacked, vandalised and the subject of acres of vitriolic newsprint.\n\nIn the case of Quinn’s blood-head it was even allegedly melted. Not by an act of vandalism but by a hapless workman who turned the refrigeration off while working on Nigella Lawson’s kitchen. Then there was that cleaner who binned a pile of old cigarette ends, half-empty wine glasses and other assorted “rubbish” only to learn that it was very expensive work of conceptual art by Damien Hirst. My how the tabloids lapped that one up. They hadn’t had such a good laugh since dear old Carl Andre flogged his pile of bricks to the Tate just over the river.\n\nNow of course the YBAs are part of the London tourist trail and these works are among the star exhibits in Charles Saatchi’s remarkable new gallery housed in the old committee rooms, corridors, offices and library at County Hall. And how great they look set against the sober and rather stuffy backdrop of this fine Edwardian building with its parquet flooring and ambience of faded grandeur.\n\nPutting aside the astonishing turn of fate that means that Saatchi – Margaret Thatcher’s ad man -– has now taken control of a big lump of the former GLC citadel of her arch enemy “Red ” Ken Livingston, what has been created is a great gallery. There’s something a bit unreal about it too. The original offices remain seemingly untouched, their original mantel-pieces, fireplaces and clocks, (all set at different times, I noted), looking just as though the pen-pushers have left for the weekend and the furniture has been moved out for someone to slap a new coat of emulsion on the wall. What if one of their ghosts returned, wandering along from Waterloo Station to discovered that their office, where budgets were once adjusted and memos written in triplicate, was now home to Chris Ofili’s portrait of the Virgin Mary complete with elephant dung, or a Damien Hirst pharmacy poster offering pie and chips in 100 milligramme capsules? It’s a wonderful thought and one that gives an intriguing insight into the curious nature of changing times, places and values.\n\nThe works on show at County Hall are not of course the fevered creations of unhinged lunatics that certain elements in the popular Press would have us believe. They are, like it or not, the product of some of the most creative minds in Britain today and a vital and important part of the on-going debate that says that art should question and challenge rather than just sit in a frame and look pretty.Certainly this gallery with its prime position on the banks of the River Thames right next to the London Eye is attracting tens of thousands of visitors.\n\nIt is also one of the three stop-off points for the new Tate to Tate Ferry. This service, a godsend for art lovers, is a flash 220-seat river bus decorated with Damien Hirst spots, which shuttles passengers between Tate Britain at Millbank and Tate Modern at Bankside calling in at County Hall on the way. The journey which lasts just 18 minutes takes in one of the best cityscapes in the world and is also a great way of travelling between the Westminster/Millbank area and The City. A £4.50 ticket allows you up to three return journeys.\n\nAt the moment the Tate Britain is of particular interest those au fait with the local art scene as it is host to the first full-scale international art museum show by Bournemouth trained photographer and 1999 Turner Prize winner Wolfgang Tillmans. German-born Tillmans, who studied at the Bournemouth and Poole College of Art and Design and returned there last year to receive an honorary degree is an extraordinary artist, obsessively exploring everything from the magnificent to the mundane.\n\nThis massive show, taking up seven rooms at the Tate Modern, is called If One Thing Matters, Everything Matters. It’s a point that is rammed home as room after room displays images that range from socks rolled up on a sofa to pieces of orange skin, a bunch of keys, clubbers, sexual encounters, Concorde, the Halle Bop comet and some intriguing experimentations with photographic dyes. Some are just prints stuck to the gallery wall with pieces of tape, others hang from bulldog clips. In a world where we are bombarded by millions of visual images, it’s intriguing to encounter someone who finally understands their mind-numbing normalcy. And to put a show like this in the Tate Britain is every bit as radical as the display offered by Saatchi’s not-so-bad boys and girls across the water.\n\n* Wolfgang Tillmans’ If One Thing Matters, Everything Matters is at Tate Britain until September 14.
