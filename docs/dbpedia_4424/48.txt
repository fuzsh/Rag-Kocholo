Beta Phi Boulé History

Beta Phi Boulé received its charter on October 28, 1983, at Richmond’s John Marshall Hotel, site of the second biennial Southeast Regional Boulé. Alpha Beta and Beta Lambda of Richmond and the Greater Hampton area of Virginia, respectively, were the host boulés and sponsors for the proposed Beta Phi Boulé of Roanoke-Lynchburg. Past Grand Sire Archon Oliver W. Hill and Archon James Sheffield served as mentors and sponsors. There were thirteen charter members of Beta Phi Boulé ; Maynard H. Law was the first Sire Archon. Archon Clarence M. Gillis, who was elected Regional Grapter at this time, went on to publish Sigma Pi Phi’s second newsletter and later became the tenth Sire Archon of the Southeast Region. In addition to serving as tutors and mentors to young people in the community, Beta Phi’s Archons have established a scholarship program, which awards three high school graduates annually with a scholarship honoring the memory of Sire Archon Maynard H. Law.
