        "text": "African-American fraternity\n\nSigma Pi Phi (ΣΠΦ), also known as The Boulé, founded in 1904, is the oldest fraternity for African Americans. The fraternity does not have collegiate chapters and is designed for professionals at mid-career or older. Sigma Pi Phi was founded in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.\n\nThe fraternity quickly established chapters (referred to as \"member boulés\"[A]) in Chicago, Illinois and then Baltimore, Maryland.[1] The founders included two doctors, a dentist and a pharmacist.[2] When Sigma Pi Phi was founded, black professionals were not offered participation in the professional and cultural associations organized by the white community.[3] Sigma Pi Phi has over 5,000 members and 139 chapters throughout the United States, the United Kingdom, The Bahamas, Colombia and Brazil.[4]\n\nFounders\n\n[edit]\n\nHenry McKee Minton, PhG (December 25, 1870 - December 29, 1946) -\n\nPharmacist and doctor who was Superintendent of the Mercy Hospital of Philadelphia for 24 years [5]\n\nEugene T. Hinson, MD -\n\nCofounder of Black founded and operated Mercy Hospital in Philadelphia, which opened in 1907.[5]\n\nRobert J. Abele, MD (1875–1929)\n\nRobert J. Abele graduated at the top of his 1895 class at Hahnemann University Medical School (and was its first Black graduate) who earned the highest score ever awarded at that point on the state’s medical certification test, the Pennsylvania State Qualifying Examination for Physicians, in 1897 (where he scored 97.3% out of 100%).[6][5]\n\nAlgernon B. Jackson, MD (1878–1942)\n\nA prominent African American physician, surgeon, writer, and columnist who contributed profoundly to the National Negro Health Movement, an organization which sought to uplift African Americans by educating them on preventative medicine and public health.[5]\n\nEdwin C.J.T. Howard, MD (Oct 21, 1846 - May 10, 1912)\n\nHarvard Medical School Class of 1869 who practiced medicine in Charleston South Carolina and then Philadelphia, Pennsylvania where he founded Frederick Douglass Hospital in 1895 and Mercy Hospital in 1907[5][7]\n\nRichard J. Warrick Jr., DDS (1880–1957)\n\nPenn Dental School (Class of 1899), where he was 2nd Black person to graduate and oldest historically black university, Cheney University[8][9]\n\nMembership\n\n[edit]\n\nMembership in Sigma Pi Phi is highly exclusive, numbering only about 5,000.[10] The organization is known as \"the Boulé,\" which means, in Ancient Greek \"the Council\".[11] Founded as an organization for professionals, Sigma Pi Phi never established collegiate chapters, and eliminated undergraduate membership during its infant stages.[12] However, Sigma Pi Phi has historically had a congenial relationship with intercollegiate Black Greek-letter organizations, as many members of Sigma Pi Phi are members of both. Sigma Pi Phi founder Henry McKee Minton and Martin Luther King Jr. were both members of Alpha Phi Alpha, while Arthur Ashe was a member of Kappa Alpha Psi. Vernon Jordan and L. Douglas Wilder are members of Omega Psi Phi. James Weldon Johnson was a member of Phi Beta Sigma, as was civil rights leader and member of Congress John Lewis (D-GA). University of Massachusetts-Boston Chancellor, Dr. J. Keith Motley, and Hibernia Southcoast Capital CEO (Retired), Joseph Williams are members of Iota Phi Theta. Members of Sigma Pi Phi have provided leadership and service during the Great Depression, World War I, World War II, the Great Recession, and addressed social issues such as urban housing, and other economic, cultural, and political issues affecting people of African descent.\n\nNotable members\n\n[edit]\n\nMembers of Sigma Pi Phi include:[13] W. E. B. Du Bois, civil rights leader and one of the founders of the NAACP; Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., civil rights leader; Robert J. Abele, Sigma Pi Phi founder and brother of Julian Abele, who served as the lead architect of Duke University; former NAACP President Kweisi Mfume; Ralph Bunche, a United Nations Ambassador and first African-American winner of the Nobel Peace Prize; Andrew Young, civil rights leader and a mayor of Atlanta; Maynard Jackson, a mayor of Atlanta; Douglas Wilder, a Governor of Virginia; Kenneth Chenault, a CEO of American Express; Bobby Scott; C. O. Simpkins Sr.; Ken Blackwell; Eric Holder, a United States Attorney General;[14] Ron Brown; Vernon Jordan; Arthur Ashe; Mel Watt;[15] John Baxter Taylor Jr., the first African-American to win an Olympic Gold Medal; and Calvin Ball, first African-American County Executive.[16] Numerous other American leaders are among the men who have adopted the fraternity’s purpose of \"creating a forum wherein they could pursue social and intellectual activities in the company of peers.\"[3] Sigma Pi Phi is open to members of all races, as can be demonstrated by its well-known Jewish member Jack Greenberg, who succeeded Thurgood Marshall as the leader of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, Inc.[17]\n\nIn media\n\n[edit]\n\nLawrence Otis Graham reports on the organization and his membership in it in the 1999 book Our Kind of People: Inside America's Black Upper Class.[18]\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nAmerican Black Upper Class\n\nNotes\n\n[edit]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
