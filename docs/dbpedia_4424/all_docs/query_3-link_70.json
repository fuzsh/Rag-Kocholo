        "text": "ORLANDO, Feb. 22, 2024 - Taylor A. Gerring, a 2005 UCF graduate who is a blockchain pioneer and expert and co-founder of Ethereum Foundation, has pledged $5.5 million to UCF Athletics. This is the largest single cash pledge commitment ever by an individual for UCF Athletics. In addition, Gerring has pledged $1 million to The Kingdom, UCF Athletics’ official NIL collective.\n\nAs part of Mission XII, the Knights’ strategic athletics fundraising campaign to ensure a successful transition into the Big 12 Conference, this commitment will help fund construction of a new football administration and coaches building as part of the Hagle Football Gateway project. In recognition of this extraordinary leadership gift, the UCF Board of Trustees voted today to honor Gerring by approving the naming of the Taylor A. Gerring Football Center.\n\nGerring, of Stuart, Fla., credits his UCF education for giving him a strong foundation for the success he has achieved in business. He graduated with a bachelor’s degree in Business Administration.\n\nGerring is an avid Knights fan whose enthusiasm grew while he was in school with his business fraternity Delta Sigma Pi and through his involvement after graduation with the Chicago UCF alumni community. His worlds collided in 2014 at the Bitcoin St. Petersburg Bowl. “I was living in Europe and traveled back, very excited to see the culmination of this whole Bitcoin/Ethereum world come together with my UCF Knights in St. Petersburg, and it’s literally the Bitcoin Bowl…I was like, ‘is this event made for me?’”\n\n“I have met many Shareholders Society donors over the last couple of years and have enjoyed becoming part of this community of like-minded friends who care deeply about the success of the Knights,” Gerring said. “I am proud to make this investment in UCF Football. Our competitive success on the field is very important to the comprehensive growth and progress of the university. This is my way to do what I can in this moment of time as we enter the Big 12 Conference. There’s a lot of momentum and excitement behind that, and I hope to inspire other donors to jump in and help us reach the end goals we’re looking for.”\n\nUCF is creating a one-of-a-kind football campus to help the football team succeed at the highest levels of competition and enhance the fan experience. These initiatives are part of the larger Mission XII program to expand and enhance game and practice facilities for all of the Knights’ teams throughout the Kenneth G. Dixon Athletics Village.\n\nIn addition to the Taylor A. Gerring Football Center, the Hagle Football Gateway will feature Nicholson Plaza; McNamara Cove, which will offer student-athletes a recovery river and hydrotherapy; a renovated Wayne Densch Sports Center, which will include an expanded football team locker room, the Thow Family Locker Room; enhancements to UCF’s football practice complex; a new VIP parking lot; and a pedestrian promenade. Phased construction is scheduled to start in the spring of 2024.\n\nGerring’s $5.5 million gift to UCF Athletics includes $5 million in support of the construction of the football center and $500,000 that will be invested in the Taylor A. Gerring Athletics Facilities Endowment Fund.\n\n“UCF aspires to be the best metropolitan research university in the country, and that includes building a collegiate athletics program that competes at the highest level,” said UCF President Alexander N. Cartwright. “We are grateful for passionate alumni like Taylor who are reinvesting in their alma mater. Taylor’s significant investment in UCF Football will be a game-changer in delivering unmatched facilities for competition, training and recovery.”\n\n“We appreciate Taylor’s belief in our capital vision as part of Mission XII to build new unique first-class facilities for our student-athletes, coaches, staff and fans,” said UCF vice president and director of athletics Terry Mohajir. “Taylor’s gift commitment will provide huge momentum for our fundraising efforts. His generosity will help us ‘reach for the stars’ as we continue to emerge as a national program.”\n\n“We’re so grateful for Taylor and how he continues to be one of the biggest supporters of our program,” said UCF football head coach Gus Malzahn. “This gift is huge for our program, both now and in the future, and we’re extremely thankful for his investment in UCF Football.”\n\nFor more information about making a gift in support of Mission XII, please visit www.missionxii.com."
