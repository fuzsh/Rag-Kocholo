        "text": "Tripod\n\nPhi Sigma Pi is built on a Tripod of three ideals: Scholarship, Leadership and Fellowship which support the ultimate goal of social service. This Tripod provides direction in our organization, our programming and in our actions as Members. Combined, the Tripod guides our Members to be successful contributing citizens while at campus and into their professional careers.\n\nScholarship: As an honor organization, we expect our Members to maintain good academic standing. Academic standing, however, is just a small part of the scholarship ideal. Scholarship in our organization expands outside the classroom and is a part of a larger “always learning” philosophy. Our Chapters coordinate scholarship events such as painting nights, TED Talks and mental health awareness panels.\n\nLeadership: Phi Sigma Pi provides the opportunity for students to gain core leadership skills to strengthen themselves; but then, just as importantly, how they apply that skill to pay it forward. Our nationally award-winning Leadership in Action is a personal/professional leadership training and certification program that provides Members with the skills to inspire a positive change. This certification program goes beyond the traditional organization leadership roles by exploring communication skills for emerging leaders and team management.\n\nLeadership in Phi Sigma Pi also extends through service in our communities. Our Chapters support our National Philanthropy and also plan philanthropic events with their local organizations that have a meaningful impact to the local community.\n\nFellowship: Phi Sigma Pi develops a culture of fellowship within the organization. In addition to a culture that develops friendships, it also fosters a sense of teamwork and camaraderie that allows for the local Chapter to plan successful events and activities. In Phi Sigma Pi, you’re a Member for life. Fellowship provides the passion and stability to fully remain involved with Phi Sigma Pi.\n\nMission\n\nPhi Sigma Pi National Honor Fraternity is an inclusive organization dedicated to: promoting lifelong learning, inspiring Members to lead, and cultivating lasting fraternal bonds, while always conducting our lives with honor. We commit ourselves to a life of social service with the goal of improving humanity through our principles: Scholarship, Leadership, and Fellowship.\n\nDiversity, Equity and Inclusion\n\nDiversity, Equity and Inclusion Statement\n\nPhi Sigma Pi is committed to being a diverse, inclusive and equitable organization as we improve humanity with honor.\n\nAvailable Programming\n\nOur Fraternity offers programming to increase your knowledge of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI), how to have conversations about DEI, and how to be an effective ally.\n\nCurrent programming includes the following webinars:"
