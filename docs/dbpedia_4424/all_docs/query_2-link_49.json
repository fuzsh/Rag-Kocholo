        "text": "The Iota Pi chapter had built its membership to nearly 100 SDSU students (photo taken prior to the pandemic).\n\nThe Delta Sigma Pi professional business fraternity at San Diego State University (Iota Pi chapter) was recently named the provincial winner for the Most Improved Collegiate Chapter for the western region.\n\nFounded in 1907, Delta Sigma Pi trains members in professional skills, leadership, ethics and service. The Iota Pi chapter at SDSU is one of 303 worldwide collegiate chapters and one of 34 in California.\n\nSDSU's chapter of Delta Sigma Pi (Iota Pi) was named Most Improved Collegiate Chapter for the Pacific Coast Region.\n\nThe Iota Pi chapter, led by president Harena Habte (senior management major) vice president Kaitlin Lebow (senior international business major) and SDSU undergraduate advisor Jason Tan, set out to improve the chapter by meeting and exceeding the goals and expectations set forth by the national organization.\n\nAccording to Habte, the chapter has made significant improvements to their recruiting events and they have taken a more active role in seeking professional opportunities for potential job placements. She said they have also actively sought out new ways to broaden their community service roles and bond with the community.\n\n“One of our biggest improvements we always strive to build on is to connect with our amazing brotherhood,” she said. “From Zoom movie nights to Kahoot games and other fun virtual events, our goal has always been to connect with brothers outside of Delta Sigma Pi, which is how we’ve been able to make lifelong friendships. It is amazing what driven individuals can accomplish together as a team and that is why we are so proud of the impacts we can make on our personal and professional endeavors, and why we are so honored to have received this recognition.”"
