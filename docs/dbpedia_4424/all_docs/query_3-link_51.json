        "text": "March 18 marks the return of the Zeta chapter of the Sigma Pi fraternity at Ohio Northern University. Their recolonization ceremony was held at The Inn where 43 ONU men became re-founding fathers within the historical fraternity. With the proactive cooperation from various ONU organizations, including student involvement and Greek life, Sigma Pi is able and ready to continue its quest for excellence.\n\nThe quest for returning to ONU began when Lanse Macke visited and resided at ONU several weeks ago. As a growth specialist, Macke’s objective is to recruit, colonize and assist Sigma Pi chapters.\n\nThe mission for Sigma Pi is to advance in one’s quest for excellence, and to prepare members for success. Established in 1897 and branching out to various organizations, the men of Sigma Pi have continuously practiced their many values. Whether it’s advocating chivalry or diversity amongst the organization, Sigma Pi has a variety of characteristics.\n\n“It doesn’t matter the background and culture. Developing a man’s character has no limit,” Macke said.\n\nThere are a variety of students within the Sigma Pi brotherhood: accountants, pharmacists, musical theatre majors, but also, student athletes. While recruiting men on campus, the brothers and Macke are determined to show students and departments at ONU that athletics and Greek life can co-exist, staying driven and ambitious in both organizations.\n\nAlong with values and the quest for excellence, Sigma Pi has brought together and raised many men. Among the past brothers there is Henry Lehr, founder of Ohio Northern University, and James Dicke of the Dicke College of Business Administration. Within ONU, Sigma Pi runs deep within the university and Greek community for over one-hundred years.\n\n“We knew the chapter would return, and we would have another hundred years at ONU, and you are the men who will make this possible,” said Karl May, the alumni advisor for Sigma Pi, when addressing the brothers at their ceremony.\n\nFor many of the men in the fraternity, becoming part of the Greek community was always an option, but for junior accounting major Jack Ellerhorst, there were many reasons and newly found benefits for joining. While his older brother was a Sig Pi from Miami University, Ellerhorst knew that he also wanted to be a part of Greek life, but never imagined becoming a new Founding Father for one.\n\n“The idea of being a Founding Father for an organization is an once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. When I was contacted by Lanse Macke about joining, I felt like it was fate. After meeting with Lanse a couple of times, I knew this is where I wanted to be.”\n\nEllerhorst will be serving as the president of Sigma Pi for the upcoming semesters at ONU. With the brothers working together, they hope to expand the chapter in size, along with engage within the campus community. The brothers established a team for Relay for Life [held in March], and participated in ONU’s Greek Week in April. Within the six weeks of recruiting, the brothers strive for their quest of excellence, recognizing those among ONU who have helped them come this far.\n\n“Everyone has been very open, very enthusiastic about our return. I’ve never seen a community this healthy in Greek life. Thank you to the office of student involvement, the IFC and Panhellenic Council, and the Greek community as a whole,” said Macke."
