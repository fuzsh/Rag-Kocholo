        "text": "Stories You May Like\n\nDoggone it! Recalling a furrier era, when free-roaming, four-legged friends were a ubiquitous part of campus life\n\nBy Joe Wilensky\n\nFor much of the 20th century, the Ithaca campus had truly “gone to the dogs”: canines were allowed to not only romp and roam on the grassy quads, but to visit their human friends in lecture halls, libraries, and dining halls.\n\nAnd while the University attempted for decades—albeit halfheartedly, ineffectively, or both—to enact a variety of bans, the seemingly constant presence of four-legged friends on the Hill lasted well into the 1970s.\n\n“My classmates were dumbfounded as to how he memorized my schedule,” Immerman recalls. “He would visit my classes and walk through the rows of chairs, one by one, until he found me.”\n\nOne of Little’s favorite Cornell “shaggy dog” stories involves legendary professor Walter LaFeber. When Little was TA-ing LaFeber’s U.S. foreign relations class in Ives Hall one day in the late 1970s, two dogs wandered in.\n\n“Not a problem; Walt liked dogs,” Little recalls. “And then the dogs started to become … amorous. So I got up and shooed them outside and closed the door. Walt quipped, ‘That’s the “open-door policy” in action’—and brought down the house.”\n\nAn early anecdote that typifies the omnipresence of dogs on campus appears in As I Remember, a memoir by former law professor Allan Treman 1921, JD 1924, who recalls a 1921 concert featuring a world-famous pianist—and an uninvited guest.\n\n“Sergei Rachmaninoff was playing in the middle of the Bailey Hall stage on a grand piano,” Treman wrote. “One of the larger campus dogs made his way into the building, walked onto the stage in the middle of a long number, and gently sniffed at Rachmaninoff’s left hand.”\n\nThe pianist, Treman recalled, was unfazed. “Aside from a couple of dirty looks at the dog, he kept playing as if nothing amiss was going on,” he observed, noting: “The applause at the end of the number was twice as loud as usual.”\n\nDogs were indeed tolerated—and, by many, welcomed—on the Hill for years, some becoming unofficial mascots. The most famous may have been a three-legged husky named Chinook (nicknamed “Tripod”), a house dog of Kappa Delta Rho fraternity and a frequent campus visitor during the 1950s.\n\nAfter being involved in a mini-scandal in which he (directly or indirectly) caused the death of a cat and was banished from campus, Tripod moved to Alaska with his human companion, Roger Burggraf ’55, BS ’56—though he made a lasting impression by getting his senior portrait in the 1959 yearbook.\n\nStories You May Like\n\nWhile the campus was reportedly dog-friendly from its founding, attempts to ban dogs go back at least a century; a 1924 New York Times article described the University’s efforts to enact a decree that had never been strictly enforced.\n\n“The result was that the dogs brought their friends, their friends’ friends, their relatives, and their progeny,” the Times reported, “increasing the collection of campus canines to such an extent that their noise, their frolics, and their presence aroused the displeasure of the Faculty, which has refused to tolerate the disturbance longer.”\n\nThe dogs brought their friends, their friends’ friends, their relatives, and their progeny.\n\nThe New York Times, 1924\n\nThe crackdown either didn’t last or was ineffective, because a similar effort was made a generation later. In Cornell: A History, 1940–2015, Glenn Altschuler, PhD ’76, and Isaac Kramnick note that in 1948, President Edmund Ezra Day banned canines from the Willard Straight cafeteria.\n\n“A year later, the Daily Sun began a campaign to keep them out of libraries, and in 1953 President Malott excluded them from graduation ceremonies,” they write. “By 1959 dogs were persona non grata in all university buildings, with the explanation that ‘dogs in the library are destroying books and disturbing study conditions; dog fights in classrooms have occurred; and students and staff alike have been bitten.’”\n\nDespite this, dogs again seemed to be everywhere by the late ’60s and early ’70s—joining Commencement processions, accompanying students at protests and sit-ins, frolicking with each other, and (especially) lounging, both outdoors and in.\n\nThis dogged acceptance may have been fueled by an oft-repeated but apocryphal legend: that a wealthy alum had bequeathed a great sum to Cornell, with the proviso that canines be allowed to roam free.\n\nYears later, the myth was given additional legs (so to speak) when Matt Ruff ’87 repeated it in his fantastical novel Fool on the Hill, which was set on campus—and where, he wrote, a donor had “created a codicil that granted free run of the campus to any and all dogs, ‘be they stray or otherwise, for as long as this University shall endure.’”\n\nWhile Ruff’s novel may have cemented the perception of Cornell as dog friendly, Frank Costigliola, PhD ’73, attributes it to the overall mood at the time he was on the Hill—an era when intellectual rigor coexisted with a strong sense of the counterculture.\n\n“Ralph greeted everyone on the Arts Quad, where he spent hours every day making friends, catching and chasing Frisbees and tennis balls,” Cornell recalls. “He reduced the stress of students, staff, and faculty—and made even non-dog people comfortable, with his wagging tail and big brown eyes.”\n\nAll images courtesy of Rare and Manuscript Collections.\n\nPublished May 16, 2023\n\nDo you have any dogg-ed memories of the Hill?"
