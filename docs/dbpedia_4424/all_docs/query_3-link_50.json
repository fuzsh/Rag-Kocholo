        "text": "A brief history behind these organized powerhouses and their contributions to American culture\n\nWhy Were They Created\n\nIn the early 19th century, social Greek organizations, known as sororities and fraternities, began forming on college campuses across the United States to provide a sense of community and unique opportunities for students. These organizations were often highly exclusive and barred membership to students of certain genders or races, specifically Black students.\n\nThe Divine Nine\n\nAt the start of the 20th century, a small number of Black students came together from mainly Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) to form their own sororities and fraternities. These organizations are known collectively as the National Pan-Hellenic Council or the “Divine Nine”. Each of these organizations were established with unique core values but shared a common goal: to educate and uplift the Black community from racial inequities.\n\nAlpha Phi Alpha Fraternity, Founded 1906, Cornell University\n\nAlpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Founded 1908, Howard University\n\nKappa Alpha Psi Fraternity, Founded 1911, Indiana University\n\nOmega Psi Phi Fraternity, Founded 1911, Howard University\n\nDelta Sigma Theta Sorority, Founded 1913, Howard University\n\nPhi Beta Sigma Fraternity, Founded 1914, Howard University\n\nZeta Phi Beta Sorority, Founded 1920, Howard University\n\nSigma Gamma Rho Sorority, Founded 1922, Butler University\n\nIota Phi Theta Fraternity, Founded 1963, Morgan State University\n\nContributions to American History\n\nMembers of these sororities and fraternities were also heavily involved in several social justice movements such as the Women’s Suffrage, Civil Rights Movement and Black Lives Matter. These organizations have made significant strides to help unite Black communities across the US and continue to collectively organize to serve various social causes.\n\nProminent Members\n\nAlpha Phi Alpha\n\nBarry Jenkins – Won the Best Picture Oscar for directing Moonlight.\n\nRafael Warnock – First African American to represent Georgia in the U.S. Senate.\n\nAlpha Kappa Alpha\n\nKamala Harris – First African American elected to the U.S. Vice Presidency.\n\nPhylicia Rashad – Emmy-nominated and Tony-award winning actress.\n\nKappa Alpha Psi\n\nMarquise Goodwin - American football wide receiver and Track and Field Olympian.\n\nBernard A. Harris Jr. - First African American to walk in space.\n\nOmega Psi Phi\n\nCharles Bolden Jr. - Former 12th Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).\n\nMichael Jordan – American businessman and six-time NBA Championship winner.\n\nDelta Sigma Theta\n\nShirley Chisholm – First Black woman elected to the United States Congress; First Black candidate for a major party’s nomination for President of the United States.\n\nMarcia Fudge – Former chair of the Congressional Black Caucus and nominee for US Secretary of Housing and Urban Development.\n\nPhi Beta Sigma\n\nKwame Nkrumah – First Prime Minister and President of Ghana.\n\nRichard Sherman – Five-time Pro Bowl NFL cornerback and philanthropist.\n\nZeta Phi Beta\n\nZora Neale Hurston – Acclaimed author, anthropologist, and filmmaker frequently cited as one of the pre-eminent writers of 20th century African American literature.\n\nDionne Warwick – Six-time Grammy Award-winning singer and actress.

These organizations deserve to be honored this Black History Month for their legacy of excellence.\n\n2021 Black History Month campaign\n\nMake sure to check out our other entries in YES Prep's 2021 Black History Month campaign, by clicking here."
