        "text": "How Can Your Son Benefit From Fraternity Membership?\n\nFor your son, making the transition from high school to a four-year university may seem like an imposing challenge. One or more of the following questions may be on his mind:\n\nWill I fit in and make new friends?\n\nWill I be able to succeed academically?\n\nWill I be able to get involved in campus organizations and better my leadership skills?\n\nWill I find other people interested in the same things that I am?\n\nHow can I prepare for my career?\n\nWill I feel like a part of the campus community or just another number?\n\nA fraternity can help personalize your son’s college experience by offering an immediate social and scholastic support system; hands-on experience in leadership, exposure to potential careers through educational programs and discussions with alumni; the chance to give back to the community through service projects; and close friends who will cheer him on when he is successful and support him when times are tough.\n\nWith all these opportunities available to them, it is no wonder that fraternity members tend to graduate from college at a higher rate than those men not involved in fraternities.\n\nIn addition to having an excellent support system from their brothers, members also enjoy the following benefits by living in the Sigma Pi house:\n\nFresh cooked meals twice daily Monday through Friday by our personal chef\n\nGrab and go breakfast daily\n\nState of the art housing that includes study rooms\n\n24 large bedrooms with moveable furniture\n\nWasher and dryers on site and free of charge\n\nWeight room\n\nSecure housing with free parking\n\nOpportunities for leadership\n\nAlumni connections\n\n8 hours of required study time a week\n\nA minimum of a 2.75 GPA or higher required by all brothers\n\nStrong sense of brotherhood\n\nFriendships that last a lifetime\n\nWe’re Here to Answer Your Questions\n\nAs you look into the Greek Community with your son consider the following information compiled by national studies:\n\nFraternity affiliation can positively influence retention through graduation. Fraternity affiliation directly impacts campus involvement and overall student satisfaction with college. Fraternity affiliation can positively influence involvement in civic organizations after college.\n\nSome statistics compiled by the North-American Interfraternity Conference include:\n\n48% of all US Presidents have been Greek\n\n42% of US Senators are Greek\n\n30% of US Congressmen are Greek\n\n40% of all US Supreme Court Justices have been Greek\n\n30% of Fortune 500 Executives are Greek\n\nAnd Greeks only make up 3% of the US population.\n\nNational Greek Websites:\n\nNorth-American Interfraternity Conference: www.nicindy.org\n\nFor more information, please contact our alumni:"
