Your Chapters can increase visibility on campus by tabling around Recruitment and throughout the term. Below are a few things to keep in mind as you plan your tabling events.\n\nBuild a Recruitment Committee. These Members may help plan some of the events and help with logistical arrangements for recruitment.\n\nReserve a high-traveled space. This could be a campus-wide organization fair or a solo event with just the Chapter. Consider the weather in your area if it is outdoors.\n\nCommunicate with Chapter Members about what days and times work well. Full Chapter participation is highly encouraged!\n\nCreate a visual aid. This can be a trifold poster, several shirts, awards your Chapter won, etc. Also, encourage Members to wear Phi Sigma Pi letters."
