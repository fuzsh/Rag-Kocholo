        "text": "About\n\nThe Tau Chapter of Sigma Pi Fraternity has recently returned to the University of Wisconsin-Madison after being absent for almost 70 years. Since our re-chartering on campus, Sigma Pi has made a tremendous impact on the Madison community with events such as the ACE project, a special event designed to give back to University. As of Today, the Tau chapter of Sigma Pi is growing, with new gentlemen and scholars entering our ranks each passing semester. The ideals of Sigma Pi, which constitute the underlying reason for the Fraternity’s rise, development, and continued existence, are plainly set forth in our teachings, and are in essence as follows: to establish a brotherhood, to establish and maintain an aristocracy of learning, to raise the standards of morality and develop character, to diffuse culture and encourage chivalry, to promote the spirit of civic righteousness and quicken the national conscience.\n\nNicknames\n\nSig Pi, SP\n\nMotto\n\nProgress, man’s distinctive mark alone, Not God’s, and not the beasts’\n\nGod is, they are. Man partly is and wholly hopes to be."
