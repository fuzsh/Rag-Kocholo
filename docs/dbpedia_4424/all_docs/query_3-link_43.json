        "text": "The College of Idaho is a small, private liberal arts institution with a long-standing history of academic excellence and a fraternal history spanning over 85 years. College of Idaho Greek Life consists of three national fraternities, three national sororities, and one local sorority. Membership in a national fraternity or sorority provides opportunities for students to broaden their educational experiences during their time at the College. The role of fraternities and sororities is to promote academics, enrich personal lives, and serve the community. The College of Idaho recognizes this role and encourages Greek contributions and presence.\n\nNational Fraternities\n\nSigma Chi\n\nEstablished at the College in 1988 as Sigma Chi Alpha, the group received its charter as the Kappa Lambda Chapter of Sigma Chi International on January 29, 1994. With over 40 members, the Kappa Lambda Chapter stays involved through philanthropy events like Miss C of I and Derby Days. Holding a strong focus on leadership, brothers of the fraternity can be seen around campus in student government, International Student Organization, on the football team, and more. With a strong emphasis on a high GPA and community service, Sigma Chi is an active organization at C of I, committed to making the campus and the surrounding area a better place.\n\nNational Sororities\n\nKappa Alpha Theta\n\nKappa Alpha Theta of The Eta Eta Chapter creates a strong sense of sisterhood, fostering dear friendships that last a lifetime. On-campus — even as the academic world becomes more complex and impersonal—Theta creates an atmosphere of family and community. The Fraternity offers college women the opportunity to work cooperatively with others, to serve in a leadership capacity, to expand interests, and to examine with an open mind the ideas of others. Our signature philanthropy event, Mr. CASAnova, raises money every single year for both local and national CASA along with the friendship fund and is well enjoyed by the college community. We are a very diverse group of young women who are involved in numerous clubs and organizations all over campus from Res Life to Senate to Sports Teams. To learn more about the national sorority, please visit https://www.kappaalphatheta.org/\n\nKappa Kappa Gamma\n\nZeta Pi Chapter of Kappa Kappa Gamma is an organization of college women, dedicated to living out the ideals of philanthropy, leadership, scholarship, and sisterhood. The women of KKG make an impact on the College community through high levels of campus involvement—with leaders and members in organizations like Pre-Health Club, Judicial Board, Residence Life, Swim Team, Psy Chi, Student Philanthropy Council, Pre-Law Club, ENACTUS, and Student Senate, among others. At C of I, KKG women seek to make a difference in the Caldwell community by visiting local elementary schools to read and donate books. These funds are purchased by our annual philanthropy event Kappa Casino. We also have individuals from KKG who facilitate a Salvation Army Giving Tree, volunteer at the Canyon County Festival of Trees, tutor at Lincoln Elementary School, and coordinate Red Cross blood drives for the campus.\n\nIf you have questions about Kappa Kappa Gamma at The College of Idaho or want to learn more, please visit our Facebook page at https://www.facebook.com/kkgzetapi or email [email protected]. To learn more about the national sorority, please visit kappakappagamma.org.\n\nLocal Sorority\n\nSigma Epsilon\n\nSigma Epsilon was organized on January 5, 1923. Not only are they the oldest local sorority on the College's campus, but Kathryn Albertson, the wife of the Albertson's chain of grocery stores and notable philanthropist JA Albertson, was a Sigma Epsilon sister during the time that she attended the College. Sigma Epsilon is informally known as the SE's. The motto of the Sigma Epsilon Sorority is \"What we are to be, we are becoming now.\" This phrase signifies that being a Sigma Epsilon sister means that you have chosen, the highest of quality, values, and ideals that will determine the rest of your life. Above all, the purpose of Sigma Epsilon is to promote friendship and sisterhood, the strength of character, academic excellence, and sportsmanship in all college activities, social activates, and health, both moral and physical.\n\nGreek Organizations\n\nGreek Council\n\nThis council consists of representatives from each sorority and fraternity. Its purpose is to promote good relations among the Greek organizations on campus, to promote the development of Greek life, and to help advance the relationship between members of the Greek system and the rest of the campus.\n\nPanhellenic Association\n\nThe Panhellenic Association develops and maintains women's fraternity life relations at a high level of accomplishment."
