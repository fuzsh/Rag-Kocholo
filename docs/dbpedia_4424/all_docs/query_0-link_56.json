        "text": "Dispatches from The Legion of Honor\n\nChapter & Alumni News for the Fall 2023 Quarterly\n\nAlabama\n\nOn August 30, the brothers of Theta Chapter partnered with the Beta Mu Chapter of Alpha Phi and LIFESOUTH Community Blood Centers to host their annual blood drive. The drive was a great success, with 125 people donating blood. The donation is enough to save 339 lives.\n\nAlabama in Huntsville\n\nOn September 15, brothers from Mu Beta Chapter volunteered with Honoring Veteran Legacies for their second annual Shotgun Salute. The sporting clay shooting competition was followed by a BBQ dinner and dancing. The event coincided with National POW/MIA Recognition Day, and funds raised from the event help to preserve the legacies of our veterans still with us today.\n\nArizona\n\nOver the weekend leading into September 11, Epsilon Alpha Chapter participated in an annual 9/11 Memorial 5K. The race is hosted to honor and commemorate those who lost their lives during the attack twenty-two years ago.\n\nArizona State\n\nAt the 70th Grand Chapter in Fort Lauderdale, Zeta Upsilon Chapter was recognized by the North American Interfraternity Conference as one of the top fraternity chapters in the country with the NIC Chapter of Distinction Award. The award sets the chapter apart from not only other Sigma Nu chapters but all fraternity chapters, regardless of national affiliation. In addition to the chapter recognition, Zeta Upsilon also took home two awards for members of the chapter. Alumnus Dominic Frattura was recognized as an NIC Undergraduate of Distinction, and alumnus Scott Rutledge was recognized as an NIC Advisor of Distinction.\n\nIn the vibrant year of 1967, three young men, Barry Shepard (pictured right), Tom Harland, and Will Rodgers (pictured left), crossed paths at the Zeta Upsilon Chapter house. They immediately connected over their shared passion for creativity and innovation. Little did they know that this chance encounter would mark the beginning of a remarkable journey that would leave a lasting impact on the world of branding. Read this fascinating alumni profile from Zeta Upsilon alumnus Dominic Frattura HERE.\n\nArkansas-Fort Smith\n\nNu Alpha Chapter showed a commitment to extending the helping hand, even in the off-season. Brothers from the chapter volunteered with the Community Services Clearinghouse of Fort Smith, Ark., over the summer, unloading trucks for the organization. The Community Services Clearinghouse works to provide for the needs of families and individuals in the area who are facing emergency situations.\n\nAuburn\n\nOn Saturday evening, July 1, at the 70th Grand Chapter Closing Banquet, Beta Theta Chapter’s Maury D. Gaston was installed as Sigma Nu's 68th Regent.\n\nA video of Regent Gaston’s swearing-in and remarks can be seen and heard here.\n\nRegent Gaston had this to say, “I can’t express the honor of following Beta Theta Past Regents John M. Ward, who was Regent when my father was initiated in 1947, Robert Durham, and Lee Perrett who have been tremendous mentors to me. I have so many Sigma Nu heroes from our chapter and others, and I hope you will hear or read the remarks where those heroes are mentioned.\n\nI aspire for every Sigma Nu chapter to provide the best collegiate and alumni fraternity experience in America. I believe we do this at Auburn, and while that experience differs greatly from campus to campus, each of our chapters can do that for their members and alumni in their own unique way consistent with our values of Love, Honor, and Truth.\n\nThis all began with Dick Mullins asking me to serve on our House Corporation when I returned home 26 years ago. I simply said, “Yes,” and aspired to do good work for him and for the chapter. There is more about that in my remarks to the Grand Chapter, where I encouraged our Brothers across the country, especially collegians and young alumni, to “Show up and do good work.”\n\nI'm deeply grateful for this opportunity, and the support and encouragement from my fellow chapter members down through the years has been gratifying and encouraging.\"\n\nBall State\n\nTheta Nu Chapter kicked off its fall recruitment period by participating in Ball State University’s IFC Cook-Off. In addition to the time spent with prospective new members, the chapter took home the top prize as the 2023 Grand Winner thanks to member Evan Martin’s burgers.\n\nBowling Green State\n\nAt this year's Camp-In, Epsilon Chi Chapter alumni gathered at the home of alumnus Dick Schultz and his wife Dorie for their annual reunion. Present were 24 alumni golfers, with 33 gathering at the Whitey's Booze & Burgers restaurant on Friday. Most everyone stayed overnight at the Schultz’ home and then attended a meeting hosted by Chapter Advisor Bob Gingras, Alumni Advisory Board Member Mike Icenogle, and the current collegiate chapter Eminent Commander Riley Blankenship. Dinner was served to about 42 brothers and family on Saturday evening. 19 stayed for Sunday breakfast before helping clean up the house before departing.\n\nCamp-OUT/Camp-IN are long-running traditions for Epsilon Chi Chapter alumni. The Camp-OUT started in 1974 at Delaware State Park and continued until about 1987. The only Camp-IN back then was in the Epsilon Chi Chapter house in 1989. After Dick Schultz and his wife Dorie built their new home in Richfield in 2000, the Schultz began hosting the Camp-IN and have continued each year except for one during the pandemic.\n\nButler\n\nSuicide prevention is a cause the brothers of Epsilon Mu Chapter have become passionate advocates for. On September 9, as a part of National Suicide Prevention Month programming, the chapter participated in an Out of the Darkness walk hosted by the Indiana Chapter of the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention (AFSP). The Out of the Darkness walks help to introduce communities to the AFSP and raise awareness, funds, and resources to assist those affected by suicide.\n\nCentral Oklahoma\n\nBrothers from Mu Tau Chapter assisted with campus move-in to get new University of Central Oklahoma students moved into their dorms and ready for the start of the academic year.\n\nColumbus State\n\nMu Xi Chapter had a great time at their Alumni Cookout in mid-August. Over 15 alumni were present for the event. The brothers enjoyed burgers and hotdogs from the grill and conversation over cornhole. The chapter hopes the cookout is just the beginning as it grows its alumni engagement efforts in the future.\n\nDrury\n\nThe brothers from Epsilon Beta Chapter had a wonderful time participating virtually in the walk/run for St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital on September 16.

Ten members of the chapter participated in the event, and the group raised approximately $500 for the charity.\n\nEastern Illinois\n\nBrothers from Lambda Gamma Chapter volunteered at the 2023 Special Olympics Family Festival in Mattoon, Ill., on September 16.

This year’s event marked the 40th anniversary of the Special Olympics Family Festival.\n\nEastern Kentucky\n\nThroughout the month of August, brothers from Theta Theta Chapter partnered with Habitat for Humanity of Madison and Clark Counties to help build homes for community members in need. The brothers participated in a variety of tasks, including cleaning up brush, trimming trees, and building fences for residences in Richmond, Ky.\n\nAlso in August, Theta Theta’s LEAD Chairman Brandon Dearing introduced the chapter’s sophomore class to LEAD Phase II, the second phase of the Fraternity’s award-winning leadership development program. Brother Dearing facilitated a session on developing into ethical leaders and making a positive impact.\n\nFurman\n\nKappa Chi Chapter alumnus and past General Fraternity staff member Michael Burant was inducted into the Rockbridge County High School Athletics Hall of Fame. While at RCHS, Michael was a standout athlete who lettered in 11 of the 12 eligible sports available at his time in school. Michael was a four-year letter winner as an offensive tackle, defensive end, and long snapper during his football career. He was voted Most Valuable Lineman and earned All-District Honors in Fall 1998 and 1999. Michael was also recognized as an All-Region performer in 1999. In winter seasons, Michael played JV basketball his 9th-grade year and was a Varsity letter winner his 10th-grade year. In Michael's 11th and 12th grade years, he moved to the wrestling team and was a two-year letter winner in the heavyweight division. Michael was also an accomplished pitcher and catcher on the diamond for RCHS and was a four-year letter-winner in baseball. After his time at RCHS, Michael accepted an athletic scholarship to play football for Furman University in Greenville, S.C. Michael was on the NCAA national runner-up team in 2001 and was a two-time Southern Conference winner in 2001 and 2004. Michael was a three-year starter at nose guard and was selected as First Team All-Southern Conference in 2003. He was voted Most Valuable Defensive Player vs. Clemson University in 2003 and team Most Valuable Defensive Lineman in 2003. In 2004, Michael was picked 2nd Team Preseason All-American before his career ended with a knee injury in the second game of his senior campaign. Michael joined the Kappa Chi Chapter at Furman and worked for Sigma Nu Fraternity after graduation from 2005-2006.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAs a part of the 48th Annual Summer Study Abroad in Innsbruck, Austria, hosted by The University of New Orleans, 13 Mu Chapter brothers studied in Europe during the six-week program. The brothers lived in student dorms with new friends from Virginia, Alabama, Auburn, New Orleans, and even some fellow Sigma Nu's from Phi Chapter at LSU. Throughout the summer, the brothers attempted to surf the famous Munich River, saw the Red Hot Chili Peppers in Vienna, took boat tours of Prague, Budapest, and Amsterdam, and enjoyed wine tours in Italy. Among many valuable life lessons learned between cuisine, culture, and international travel, some of the most important lessons learned by the Mu men include: you can indeed bring a sword through TSA, we are lucky not to have to pay for water every meal at home, and hiking steep mountains in flip flops is actually not a good idea.\n\nGeorgia Southern\n\nTheta Kappa Chapter hosted the second annual White Rose Week in late September, raising money for the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention. During the week, the chapter was able to raise $19,108 for the cause.\n\nHouston\n\numpires have a special bond. In this case, the bond included a surprise brotherhood. At the 2023 Little League World Series Regional Tournament, two of the umpires, Todd Marr (Maryland) (right) and Mike Baker (Houston) (left), discovered they were Sigma Nu brothers. Special thanks to Brother Mike Baker, an alumnus of Zeta Chi Chapter for submitting this photo.\n\nHuntingdon\n\nNu Beta Chapter alumnus Gabriel Pittman was awarded an NCAA postgraduate scholarship earlier this year. The NCAA awards up to 126 postgraduate scholarships annually. The scholarships are awarded to student-athletes who excel academically and athletically and who are at least in their final year of intercollegiate athletics competition.\n\nBrother Pittman, a recent graduate of Huntingdon College and an alumnus of the school’s wrestling program, plans to use the scholarship to attend Auburn University to study veterinary medicine.\n\nHuntingdon Wrestling Head Coach Matt Oliver had this to say about Gabriel. “He has encompassed everything you want in a student-athlete, and this scholarship tops off an already stellar career for him both athletically and academically. I am extremely proud to call Gabe Pittman an alumnus of the Huntingdon College Wrestling Program.\"\n\nIdaho\n\nIn late July, alumni from Delta Omicron Chapter hosted the Jon Denny Memorial Golf Tournament at the University of Idaho Golf Course. Several alumni and families came together for golf and festivities in memory of Brother Jon Denny, who entered Chapter Eternal in 1999. The memorial golf tournament has been hosted for over two decades. The event serves as an opportunity for brothers and their families to play golf, share stories, and reunite with old friends. After the tournament, the brothers head to the chapter house for a celebratory barbeque.\n\nIllinois\n\nOver the summer, collegiate chapter officers from Gamma Mu Chapter attended the Gamma Mu Alumni Chapter’s Annual Alumni Dinner at the Union League Club of Chicago. The event, hosted on July 13, 2023, continues to serve as an opportunity for members from the collegiate chapter to interact and network with chapter alumni.\n\nIllinois State\n\nEarlier this summer, Theta Rho Chapter alumnus Bob Carse and collegiate chapter Alumni Relations Chairman Luke Loss organized an alumni golf outing. The event was a great success, with 20 alumni attending for fellowship on the greens.\n\nIndiana\n\nBeta Eta Chapter alumnus Don Densborn is among six Densborn Blachly LLP lawyers included in the 2024 Edition of The Best Lawyers in America, an annual publication highlighting the top five percent of practicing lawyers in the U.S., organized by state, city, and practice area. Brother Densborn, a founding partner of his firm, was also recognized as a 2024 Lawyer of the Year in the category of Business Organizations (including LLCs and Partnerships) in Indianapolis. This prestigious recognition is not new to Densborn; he previously received the honor in 2017, 2018, and 2020. This year marks Densborn’s 15th year of inclusion on the Best Lawyers list. Brother Densborn is also a Past Regent for the Fraternity and was inducted into the Fraternity’s Hall of Honor in 2014.\n\nJacksonville State\n\nOn September 5, brothers from Iota Lambda Chapter at Jacksonville State University extended the Helping Hand to their community in Jacksonville, Al. The men helped portion and bag food for Saint Luke’s Episcopal Church. The brothers' volunteer service will contribute to the church's larger efforts to feed the community. Each month, Saint Luke’s packages rice and beans to give out to those in need.\n\nJefferson\n\nMu Pi Chapter has started off the 2023 fall semester making an impact on their local community. Brothers from the chapter have participated in numerous service activities, including lending aid to the Ronald McDonald House and Monastery Stables, and participating in their first highway cleanup of the school year, covering a two-mile stretch of Henry Avenue.\n\nKentucky\n\nOn September 2, the house mother of Gamma Iota Chapter, Chasity Conley, lost her home after a car ran into the building and caught fire. The fire spread from the car to the house, resulting in irreparable damage to the structure and her belongings inside.\n\nThe chapter was swift in response to the tragedy, providing lodging and setting up a GoFundMe to help raise over $5,000 for Chasity in her time of need.\n\n“Chasity means the world to us and has been the cornerstone of our chapter here at Sigma Nu for her duration of working here. Chasity would come to our help in a tragedy like this, and we wholeheartedly will be behind her throughout this whole process.”\n\nKettering\n\nEta Mu Chapter hosted a drive-in style movie night in mid-August at their chapter house.
