        "text": "Alumni Win Football 14-13!\n\nThe Actives got off to an early 13-0 lead, but a missed extra point would prove costly. Jon Frost & Bryan Goers pulled double duty at QB for the Alumni and Tony DiFatta took the snaps for the Actives. In the closing minutes of the game, the Alumni powered down the field (thanks in part to multiple penalties from a jumpy O-Lineman on the Active team) down 13-7. With less than 2 minutes on the clock, Jason Rottler made a game winning diving catch in the end zone smacking his head on the ground causing a concussion (although he didnt realize it at the time). The actives had 1 last drive, and they got close to winning, but an already concussed Rottler made the game ending interception.\n\nThe Century Club\n\nThe Century Club is a life-time commitment to donate $100 a year to a savings account managed by Delta-Zeta's Housing Corporation.
