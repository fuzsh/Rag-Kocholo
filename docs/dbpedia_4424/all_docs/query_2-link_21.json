        "text": "By Mark Reed\n\nFormal Fraternity Rush at the University of Georgia has always been one of the most important aspects of fraternal life and the furtherance of a top fraternity. You pretty much knew who the top fraternities were by whom they pledged in formal rush. There were always certain rushees that were recognized as the cream of the crop and every fraternity on campus tried to pledge them. There were a handful of fraternities with old tradition on campus who, because of their long time on campus and their strong alumni base, whose alumni sent their sons to UGA with the expectation that they would pledge no other fraternity than that of a grandfather, father, brother, uncle or cousin. They were called legacies.\n\nMy fraternity, Sigma Pi, while being founded in 1897 in Vincennes, Indiana, had only been at UGA since being originally chartered in 1948, so in essence, we were considered new guys on the block. Because of hard work, good rushes concentrating on good men with potential, with an emphasis on jocks and brains, as well as all around sharp guys, Sigma Pi had worked itself into that Top tier of fraternities out of nearly thirty national fraternities operating on campus. That is always an arguable point between fraternities. I’ve always felt that one of the true tests of how good a fraternity is, is reflected by the girls they date and from what sorority they are in. I must say that there were many beautiful girls from top sororities dating brothers at the Sigma Pi house in the mid-60’s when I was there.\n\nWhile that aforementioned handful of fraternities had their pledges that would join no matter what, most of the others of us had to work hard for what we got. I think that made us less complacent and therefore better as a result. We found ourselves competing with another handful of top tier fraternities, even going so far as to steal some of those guys expected to pledge as a legacy somewhere else.\n\nOne of the things we at Sigma Pi had going for us was an outstanding fraternity house located at 285 S. Milledge Avenue right on fraternity and sorority row. We were directly across the street from Phi Mu and Chi Omega Sororities, with ADPi just down the street near the Varsity and Kappa Alpha Theta just down the other way towards Baxter Street. We were in a prime location in a stately old antebellum looking house with huge white columns across the front portico. I still think it is one of the best examples of a fraternity house in the University world, not just UGA. We lost that house in the 70’s, but that is another story for another time.\n\nWhen I came to UGA as a freshman in September of 1964, I planned to go through formal rush in Winter Quarter, January of 1965. To be able to go through that formal rush, the potential rushee had to make his grades Fall Quarter, i.e., not be on academic probation. I was one of the thousands of Freshmen in the Fall of 1964 who took English 101 (I had always made good grades in English all through Elementary and High School). Due to a crazy decision by the University System of Georgia, regardless of what your grade point average was in English 101 for the Quarter, your final grade was contingent upon passing a single “standard grammar” test as a pass-fail requirement. Yep, you probably guessed that I, along with much of the freshman class that year, failed that test. It was ridiculous, really. The test focused on things that none of us students had studied since early in Elementary School or maybe early in our first two years of High School. Innocuous things such as sentence diagraming and the like. The test was a farce. I had a B+ average in the course and ended up with an F because of failing the test. Of course the University System realized what a mistake it was after that Quarter, but it was too late for us who failed English 101 our first Quarter in college. Subsequently, I was unable to go through the Winter Quarter Formal Rush.\n\nA couple of my close friends, Richard and Ronald Morgan, had gone through the Fall Quarter Formal Rush. They pledged Sigma Pi, and subsequently, since there was a Smyrna connection in the fraternity already, I was being informally rushed by my friends, called Wildcat Rush. I was invited to parties and functions, and they were hoping that when I made my grades in the Fall I would go through the Winter Quarter Formal Rush and pledge Sigma Pi. Alas, it did not happen. No Formal Rush for moi.\n\nDuring my freshman year, I was able to meet a lot of different people in classes, dated a lot of different girls, and was introduced to other fraternities as options as well. I actually developed a close friendship with a senior in another fraternity who was rushing me hard. I had been introduced to him by his sister, a really sharp Tri-Delt I had a class with. In the final analysis, I decided that while he was a great guy and reason enough to pledge his fraternity, and of course they were considered one of the top tier fraternities, he would be graduating that year, so pledging there did not make sense. The bottom line was that finally, through Wildcat Rush, I agreed to accept a bid, outside of and after Formal Rush and pledged Sigma Pi.\n\nAs a side note here, just to put in perspective who Sigma Pi was at UGA, the President of the IFC was a brother, as were the Captains of the Football and Baseball teams. Oh, and one of my fellow Freshmen who also pledged Sigma Pi was a simple country boy from middle Georgia named Lewis Grizzard. Need I say more?\n\nI was initiated as a brother in January of 1966 as a sophomore. I was elected Social Chairman in my junior year of 1966-1967, and was responsible for arranging socials with sororities and booking bands for our parties. We had a one hundred man chapter, which was pretty big, so we had plenty of money for parties. We were famous on campus for having outstanding big name bands and performers at our parties, from Doug Clark and the Hot Nuts, Maurice Williams and the Zodiacs, Ben E. King, the Original Drifters, Rufus Thomas, to the Swinging Medallions in their heyday of Double Shot of My Baby’s Love.\n\nIn my first Senior year (that’s another story, too) of 1967-1968, I was elected Vice President, which was officially the Rush Chairman position. Rush was the life-blood of the fraternity, remember. Our Sage/President, Fred Blackmon, dropped out of school after Fall Quarter 1967, and I became Sage/President. My plate was full.\n\nI personally believe that the Winter Rush of 1968 was a high point for Sigma Pi. That says a lot considering the outstanding members we had pledged over the last four or five years. We were pretty damn good, if I do say so myself. At least we thought so. And so did the sororities, evidenced by the beautiful girls from top sororities dating brothers and pledges. The parking lot at the house was filled with magnificent automobiles, including my gold 1965 GTO Convertible.\n\nA couple of years before, there was a young man coming through rush by the name of Happy Dicks (Many reading this will recognize him because of the distinctive nature of his name, the fact that he was a starting varsity football player, and ended up as a prominent neurosurgeon in Georgia). Happy had pledged Sigma Chi Fraternity, one of the top tier fraternities at the time. When Happy pledged Sigma Chi, signs popped up on campus saying, “Sigma Chi is the only fraternity on campus with Happy Dicks.” I kid you not. Pretty damn witty, if you ask me, and it helped them immensely in rush. Another side note was that my fraternity brother, Lewis Grizzard, made Happy additionally famous by way of a headline of a sports column Lewis authored as a sports writer for the local Athens newspaper. If you don’t know the headline or the story, it is your loss.\n\nIn 1968, there was a young freshman by the name of Jim Klass from Atlanta who was recognized by most every fraternity on campus as one of the top guys going through rush. Every fraternity was after him. Yes, he pledged Sigma Pi. I’ll never forget the roar that went out from the crowd of Greeks gathered in front of Memorial Hall where the new pledges exited and were announced to the Greek world at UGA naming which fraternity they had pledged. We had a 30+ man pledge class that rush, one of the biggest and arguably the best rush of any fraternity."
