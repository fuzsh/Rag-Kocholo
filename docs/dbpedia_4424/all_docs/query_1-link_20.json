If you’ve been nominated, you simply need to enter your nomination code presented in your invitation and begin the registration process. If you have not been nominated but would like to be, you can apply online to become a member of Sigma Alpha Pi (NSLS).\n\nOnce you have paid the registration fee, you are considered a member (also known as a pre-inducted member) with access to certain benefits. To become an inducted member and have full access to the program’s benefits, you must complete these steps:\n\nOrientation\n\nLeadership Training Day\n\nThree Speaker Broadcast Events\n\nThree Success Networking Team Meetings\n\nAfter completing these steps, you will be invited to an induction ceremony where you will receive your certification. Typically, it takes students 12 hours across one semester to meet the induction criteria.\n\nSigma Alpha Pi has over 700 chapters and over 1.4 million members nationwide. If your school doesn’t have a chapter, you can start one yourself through our internship program or become a member of our online chapter.\n\nApply For Membership\n\nEnter Nomination Code"
