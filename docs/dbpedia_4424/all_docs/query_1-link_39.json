        "text": "In 1904, Henry Mckee Minton and a small group of professional black men of achievement in Philadelphia created the Sigma Pi Phi Fraternity. The goal of the society was to foster a fraternal union in which men of distinction could thrive in society as individuals, and together as an organization to fill a cultural void caused by a pattern of exclusion of people of color from the mainstream of American life.\n\nThe Fraternity is the oldest Greek letter organization among Black Americans. The objective of the founders was to provide \"men of like qualities\" the opportunity for social interaction in an atmosphere of mutual respect. The emphasis has always been on inviting to membership, men of recognized achievement in their fields, who are of unquestionable character, and whose personality is of a type that blends in harmoniously with others.\n\nThe Fraternity as a whole is referred to as \"The Boulé\", a concept derived from and patterned on the ancient Greek Government. Members are given the title of Archons, which in the Greek tradition was one of the chief magistrates, and their wives are referred to as Archousai. Local Boulés are known as member Boulés, and the national organization is called the Grand Boulé. In the early 1960's, during the height of the civil rights movement, Sigma Pi Phi Fraternity begin the transition to be more involved in effecting positive change in civil rights, politics and economics. There are presently 131 Boulés with over 5,000 Archons throughout the United States, England and the Caribbean.\n\nThe Fraternity, also known as the Boulé, became the first African American founded Greek-letter Fraternity. However, unlike other Greek organizations, Boulé members have received college and professional degrees at the time of their induction.\n\nGamma Xi Boulé was chartered in 1995 by four transferees from other Boulés and twelve charter members. The four founding members included Archon Matthew Carter who served as a national officer of the Fraternity and editor of our national publication \"The Boulé Journal\". The first Sire Archon or president was James C. Brown, who provided the leadership needed to launch the Boulé in Sarasota. The Gamma Xi Boulé has grown and matured under the leadership of subsequent Sire Archons.\n\nSince it was chartered in 1995, Gamma XI Boulé has awarded over $40,000 to 1st generation college students in the Sarasota area. Gamma Xi’s first mentoring program 'Youth Leadership', included 125 African American male students from 5 local schools. The program’s objective was to encourage and help students remain and succeed in school.\n\nGamma Xi partners with other organizations to respond to the needs of youth and young people of color in our community. Our current program, 'Journey to Success', partners with local high schools and others to focus on youth ages 14-19. Gamma Xi Archons volunteer to assist students in making prudent life and career choices.\n\nCurrently, Gamma Xi has 50 members. The infusion of new members is extremely important to the growth of the Fraternity and helps to shape the strategic direction of Gamma Xi Boulé. New Archons are strongly encouraged to become active in the Fraternity by joining one or more committees to embrace the spirit of Sigma Pi Phi."
