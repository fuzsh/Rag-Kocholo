        "text": "Ignorance is not always bliss. Sometimes, it's just plain old ignorance--as was blatantly demonstrated by the brothers of the Auburn University chapters of the Sigma Pi and Phi Sigma Kappa fraternities last weekend.\n\nOn Saturday, the Tigers played Alabama State University in one of those football mismatches where one team gets to essentially work out early kinks while the opponent hopes no one gets hurt and goes home with a fat check.\n\nIt was the first meeting ever between the two institutions just 60 miles apart--and after ASU survived a 63-9 defeat to the No. 7 team in the nation at Jordan-Hare Stadium, $500,000 was likely already deposited into the Hornets' coffers.\n\nInside and around the stadium, festivities were said to all-but-resemble a black-college cookout. Players, coaches, and fans of both teams, by all accounts, showed respect and sportsmanship on a beautiful fall afternoon.\n\nNot so much at Sigma Pi and Phi Sigma Kappa.\n\nEach on-campus house, most of us know by now, displayed a large bed-sheet banner that went beyond the typical taunting and trash-talking, conveying messages that embodied audacity, arrogance, privilege, and, yes, ignorance.\n\nDraped above the entrance to Sigma Pi, one read: \"ASU GRAD RATE 27% CHANCE OF WINNING 0%\"\n\nAt Phi Sigma Kappa the message was even more damning: \"GED > A.S.U. DEGREE\"\n\nThe not-subtle-at-all inferences embedded in each: We're not only better than you, we're smarter than you--and your degree is worthless.\n\nPhotos of the banners caught fire across social media, sparking emotions among ASU--and HBCU-- faithful from indifference to resigned disappointment to anger at yet another tiring rendition of [Fill in the blank] While Black.\n\nAuburn and ASU both reacted to the banners, though each essentially said what we've come to expect when these racial dog-whistles annoyingly arise.\n\n\"Auburn University is committed to upholding a nurturing community supportive of fundamental dignities and promoting integrity, responsibility, and mutual respect,\" university officials said, adding it would investigate if the banners violated the student conduct code.\n\nLate Monday night, an Auburn spokesperson shared via email: \"Although the banners do not violate the student conduct code, they do not represent the character or values of Auburn University.\"\n\nASU officials took the stratospheric high road: \"The Alabama State University family had a wonderful experience on the plains of Auburn. Hornet Nation wishes to thank Auburn's administration for the warm and generous hospitality, as well as the unifying experience ...\"\n\nOn Tuesday, Phi Sigma Kappa Executive Director/CEO Nick Zuniga sent a statement via email. It read, in part: \"These types of banners are unacceptable and go against the mission , beliefs and values of Phi Sigma Kappa and Auburn University. We apologize to the alumni of the Alabama State University and Auburn University who were offended by these insensitive actions....[We] will be working with our undergraduate members to make this situation right...Behavior like this will not be tolerated.\"\n\nSigma Pi national executive director and CEO Jonathan Frost, in an email, at least acknowledged the banner:\n\n\"We apologize for any offense caused by the banner created by a few Auburn students in support of the Auburn football team in their recent game against Alabama State. [W]e recognize [the banner was] observed to be insensitive and in poor taste... We have spoken with the students to ... discuss how they can better support their school in a more positive way.\"\n\nHere's a good start, brothers of both frats: do some research--a concept I'll presume with which you're at least somewhat familiar.\n\nResearch the beginnings of historically black colleges, created in an era when blacks throughout the South--long denied as slaves from learning to read--were forbidden from attending existing colleges.\n\nResearch how today HBCUs like Alabama State offer higher-education opportunities to students who might not otherwise be able to go attend college--not because they're not smart enough, but for myriad other reasons.\n\nMaybe they come from families where no one has previously gone to college and don't possess what some call the \"invisible knapsack\" you likely own, containing all you need (encouragement, guidance and, especially, funds from parents or relatives who've been there) to attend college. (A national study revealed while 85 percent of high-school students whose parents attended college do so themselves, just 65 percent of students whose parents did not attend college do so.)\n\nMaybe they attended a K-12 school system that did the best it could with limited-to-no resources, but either still could not achieve college-level grades or be adequately equipped for the rigors of college. (This summer 94 students who did not meet ASU's admission requirements attended its Bridge program, taking nine credits in six weeks; 80% of them achieved a 3.0 or better and all surpassed the required 2.0 needed to enroll as freshmen.)\n\nMaybe they simply don't have enough money to, say, pay their utility bill. Or the car they drive, grandma's car, broke down and they can't afford to fix it. Or they suffer an injury or illness and don't have health insurance, so they can't afford treatment. Or they find themselves, for whatever reason, having to care for their own parents.\n\nResearch this: the median family income of ASU students, according to The New York Times, is $30,300; at Auburn, that figure is $143,000--almost five times higher.\n\nResearch, too, ASU's \"contingency fund\", which helps students meet emergency needs. Last summer, SGA president Jaylon Pickett approached university president Quinton Ross, who's been on the job less than a year, with the idea that each student contributes $5 to the fund.\n\nInspired by that offer, Ross donated $50,000 from the unprecedented $1.1 million raised at his inauguration earlier this month to the fund.\n\nYes, the ASU graduation rate childishly scrawled on one banner is somewhat correct--it's actually 28%, according to 2017 data, exactly the same, by the way, as Auburn University at Montgomery's graduation rate. Yet some who dropped out of ASU, say university officials, did so due to the aforementioned reasons--and others.\n\nIndeed, fewer that one in three of ASU students who do not graduate do so because of academics, the university says.\n\nOn Monday afternoon, I spoke with a few Alabama State's senior administrators: interim associate provost Dr. Carl Pettis; Dr. Rolundus Rice, assistant vice president of student affairs; Carolyn Stevens, director of academic advisement; and Dr. Rhonda Westry, director of the academic center for educational services.\n\n\"When students cannot access what they need from the people close to them, it falls upon the institution to fill the gap,\" Dr. Rice said.\n\nStevens, a product of a single-parent home, spoke of the one-on-one meetings with incoming freshman, many of whom have not been stretched to see far into their own future. \"We give them guidance and make sure they're acclimated,\" she said. \"We know how well they did in their first year is an indication of how well they'll do in years two, three and four.\"\n\nSixty-three percent of ASU freshmen return for their sophomore year--below the national average (72%) but on par with colleges and universities in Alabama (62%), according to College Factual.\n\nTackling that retention rate is part of the academic center's mission, said Dr. Westry, a first-generation college student. \"We have very strict guidelines and resources for students struggling after the first semester, which is not unique to ASU or even HBCUs,\" she said. \"Most students are trying to transition, and we offer retention specialists to help them get back on track academically.\"\n\n\"We can cultivate students who come in with or without,\" said Dr. Pettis.\n\nPerhaps, brothers of Sigma Pi and Phi Sigma Kappa, you may add this to your research, too:\n\nDr. Rice dropped out of an Atlanta high school before coming to ASU and earning both Bachelors and Masters degrees; Dr. Pettis obtained both his Bachelors and Masters degrees (in math) at ASU.\n\nBoth then earned their PhD--at Auburn.\n\nAfter all that research, perhaps next season--when Auburn, in a show of greater hospitality to its in-state neighbors, perhaps bumps its check to $1 million--at least one fraternity banner will read:\n\nA.S.U. DEGREE = AU DEGREE\n\nArticle was updated at 2:53 with statement from Phi Sigma Kappa Executive Director/CEO Nick Zuniga\n\nRoy S.
