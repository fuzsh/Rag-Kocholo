        "text": "A Fraternity is Born\n\nOn January 26, 1897, Miss Charlotte N. Malotte, the professor of Latin and French, spoke to a student group at the chapel hour. She spoke on the subject of âCollege Fraternitiesâ which sparked the interest of several students. Then, on the afternoon of February 26, a new fraternity had its first meeting. When, after a long session, the meeting adjourned, a literary society had been born, though it was yet unnamed. The founders of the Fraternity, all cadets at Vincennes University, were William Raper Kennedy, James Thompson Kingsbury, George Martin Patterson, and Rolin Rosco James. The first three were seniors; James was a freshman.\n\nSamuel and Maurice Bayard were the first initiates. They were made members of the Fraternity before a name was selected or a constitution adopted. Many of the first meetings of the Fraternity were held at the old Bayard home. At the Bayard house, the constitution was written and the first ritual was developed and used in the loft of the familyâs carriage house.\n\nOur Motto\n\nAccording to history, the mother of the first two initiates, Mrs. Bayard, took a deep interest in the organization and used her influence to steer Tau Phi Delta in the right direction. On one occasion she entered the library of her home to find a meeting of the Fraternity in progress. The business of the hour was the adoption of an appropriate motto. No satisfactory agreement on the subject had been reached. Taking a volume of Elizabeth Barrett Browningâs poems from a shelf, she turned to A Death In The Desert, and read:\n\nProgress, manâs distinctive mark alone,\n\nNot Godâs, and not the beastsâ;\n\nGod is, they are.\n\nMan partly is and wholly hopes to be.\n\nâThat,â Mrs. Bayard said, âwould make an excellent motto for your organization.â With this remark she left the room, and her suggestion had accomplished its purpose. A motto had been found."
