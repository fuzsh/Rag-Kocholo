        "text": "Preamble\n\nFraternities and sororities have been an integral part of Duke University since 1872 (then known as Trinity College). Fraternity and sorority organizations at Duke University are comprised of groups of individuals with various interests. They are bonded together by common goals, values, and aspirations. These bonds are strengthened by honor, friendship, truth, knowledge, and character. Greek membership carries with it many benefits including leadership opportunities, academic support, an emphasis on service and philanthropy, and a bond of brotherhood and/or sisterhood. Duke University recognizes that fraternities and sororities are a valued part of the campus community and can have a positive impact on members and non-members. The privilege of fraternities and sororities to exist as part of the university brings with it a high level of responsibility. To achieve mutual success for the University and its fraternity and sorority organizations, there must be trust and shared responsibility. This success relies on the following commitments from the University, individual chapters, Governing Councils, (inter)national fraternity organizations, and student/alumni members.\n\nCommitments of Individual Chapters\n\nFraternities/Sororities will comply with all University policies as outlined in Duke Community Standard, in addition to, all policies of their respective Governing Councils, their (inter)national organizations, and all local, state, and federal laws.\n\nFraternities/Sororities will follow the basic guidelines set forth in Fraternity & Sorority Life’s Duke Greek Community

National PanHellenic Council (NPHC), and Multicultural Greek Council (MGC)) will oversee fraternities/sororities as outlined in their respective constitutions and by-laws as approved by Student Involvement & Leadership.\n\nThe Governing Councils will create guidelines for fraternities/sororities in the areas of recruitment/intake, extensions/expansions, academic standards, conduct, and administer these guidelines in accordance with their respective national umbrella organizations (National Interfraternity Council, National Pan-Hellenic Council).\n\nThe Governing Councils will coordinate their efforts with Student Involvement & Leadership to oversee member fraternities and sororities to ensure active involvement in programs and activities.\n\nThe Governing Councils will promote fraternity/sorority collaboration on campus.\n\nThe Governing Councils will continually promote the ideals of leadership, civic responsibility, diversity, wellness, and critical thinking.\n\nThe Governing Councils will work together and with other campus organizations to coordinate joint programs and events.\n\nCommitments of the (Inter)National Fraternity & Sorority Organizations\n\nThe (inter)national organizations will monitor their respective chapter’s adherence to the (inter)national Constitution and Bylaws.\n\nThe (inter)national organizations will assist

communicate with Student Involvement & Leadership in a reciprocal partnership for the betterment of their chapter.\n\nThe (inter)national organizations will schedule regular on-site visits to their respective chapter by a professional staff member or volunteer and inform Student Involvement & Leadership of said visits.\n\nThe (inter)national organizations will work with their chapters to ensure they are conducting their affairs in accordance with the mission and purpose of Duke University and Duke Greek Community Standards.\n\nCommitments of Individual Student Members of Fraternities/Sororities\n\nStudent members recognize that, by virtue of enrollment, they are at Duke University primarily for an academic education.\n\nStudent members recognize that Fraternity/Sorority membership is a privilege, and by voluntarily associating with a Greek organization, agree to conduct themselves responsibly at all times in accordance with the policies and

on-campus programs and events.\n\nThe University will provide fraternities and sororities assistance in communicating with alumni/graduate members from fraternity and sorority organizations.\n\nThe University will work with fraternities and sororities to compile grade statistics and assist organizations with providing academic assistance to members as needed.\n\nThe University will support and encourage faculty, staff, administrators, and alumni/graduate members to be advisors of the fraternity and sorority organizations.\n\nConclusion\n\nThis statement was proposed by the fraternity and sorority organizations to formalize their relationship with Duke University. It was approved by the Provost, Dean of Undergraduate Education, Vice-President for Student Affairs, Student Involvement & Leadership, Interfraternity Council, National Pan-Hellenic Council, Multicultural Greek Council, and (Inter)National Fraternity/Sorority Organizations with a presence on the Duke campus.
