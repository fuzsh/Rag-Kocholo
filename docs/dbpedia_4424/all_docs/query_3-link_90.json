        "text": "Date:\n\nPhotos and story by Joi Williams / Contributing Writer\n\nMembers of MTSU’s sororities and fraternities traveled back to the ’90s Friday night as they battled it out for the first place title at the annual Fight Song competition.\n\nSix teams competed in song and dance battles in the Murphy Center. Team one included representatives from Alpha Delta Pi, Phi Mu Alpha, Lamda Theta Alpha and Omega Psi Phi. Team two included Kappa Delta, Alpha Sigma Phi, Delta Sigma Theta and Phi Kappa Tau. Team three included Alpha Chi Omega, Sigma Pi, Lamda Chi Alpha and Alpha Phi Alpha. Team four included Zeta Tau Alpha, Alpha Tau Omega, Sigma Gamma Rho and Zeta Phi Beta. Team five included Chi Omega, Kappa Sigma, Alpha Gamma Rho and Kappa Alpha Psi. Team six included Alpha Omicron Pi, Phi Delta Theta and Phi Beta Sigma.\n\nEach team performed MTSU’s fight song with their own ’90s flare in hopes of being victorious. In the end, the judges awarded team five with third place, team two with second place and team six with first place.\n\nTo contact News Editor Andrew Wigdor, email newseditor@mtsusidelines.com.\n\nFor more news, follow us at www.mtsusidelines.com, on Facebook at MTSU Sidelines and on Twitter at @Sidelines_News\n\nRelated articles\n\nBonnaroo\n\nBonnaroo 2024: See the sounds of The Farm\n\nAll photos by Skyler Wendell Sidelines staff photographer Skyler Wendell got closer to the music at Bonnaroo Music &...\n\nCampus\n\nKey takeaways from McPhee’s 2024 State of the University Address\n\nFeatured photo by MTSU Story by Aiden O'Neill To start the new school year, President Sidney A.
