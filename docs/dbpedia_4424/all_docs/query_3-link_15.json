        "text": "Brotherhood\n\nBrotherhood combines the concept of individualism and teamwork. As a brother of Sigma Pi, you will form friendships unlike any found in other organizations. Brotherhood is not conformity, as no fraternity is made up of members who are exactly alike. By choosing to become a member of this fraternity, you will meet a diverse group of brothers who will grow to become your closest friends.\n\nLeadership\n\nMembership in Sigma Pi offers brothers many opportunities to develop their leadership potential. Everyone in the fraternity is a leader, whether they are an officer, committee chairmen, or committee member. The fraternity is essentially a self-governed community. Members learn how to manage a budget, run effective meetings, speak in public, plan events, and motivate others to do the same.\n\nAcademics\n\nIt has been proven that men who join fraternities are more likely to graduate than average students. Sigma Pi has GPA requirements that encourage members to maintain good scholarship during their time in the fraternity. We have also implemented an academic and time management plan that helps brothers develop good study habits.\n\nPhilanthropy\n\nCommunity service and philanthropic activities are integral components of being a Sigma Pi. Our fraternity sponsors a multitude of activities each year to earn money and donate time to individual philanthropies. The spirit of reaching out to help others in the community unites us and helps build moral character.\n\nAltruism\n\nOur unique A.C.E. Project is centered around giving back to our campus and community. Every year we create opportunities for our members and members of the community to do their part.\n\nSocial\n\nBeing a part of Sigma Pi gives you a chance to meet a ton of new people. Many of our social events are with other Greek organizations as well as other student groups. We also host a large number of parties including date parties, formals, and theme parties."
