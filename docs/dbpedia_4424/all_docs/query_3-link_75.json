        "text": "Council Overview\n\nEach governing council hosts or oversees their own specific processes for joining or affiliating with a fraternity or sorority. Read more below on the process:\n\nThe process of joining a fraternity or sorority affiliated with the Athenian Council (AC) varies chapter to chapter. Organizations include a gender-inclusive literary society, a leadership focused co-ed organization, and two organizations that are affiliated with the National Association of Latino Fraternal Organizations. Each organization within this council will host their own recruitment events, information sessions, and membership intake processes. For more information about the Athenian Council, please visit the link here.\n\nThe Interfraternity Council (for male-identified students) provides opportunities for prospective members to interact with members in a variety of informal settings. These experiences are designed to help prospective members gain insight into the brotherhood within the organization. Member organizations in the Interfraternity Council host a series of recruitment events typically at the beginning of each semester, and potential members should complete a free online recruitment registration form. Individual organizations will extend their own invitations for membership, known as a bid, on their own schedules but only during the regular academic year. For more information about joining an IFC affiliated fraternity please visit the link here. To learn more about the IFC fraternity experience, check out MyFraternityLife.org!\n\nThe process of joining a fraternity or sorority affiliated with the National Pan-Hellenic Council (NPHC) varies chapter to chapter, and it is recommended that an individual interested in joining the organization meet the following criteria: have a minimum of 12 credit hours; demonstrate active engagement in community service, maintain a minimum GPA of 2.5, and support local chapter programs and events. Chapters affiliated with the National Pan-Hellenic Council typically only hold membership intake activities once per year at the discretion of their respective local and regional officers. For more information about the National Pan-Hellenic Council please visit the link here.\n\nThe Panhellenic Association (for female-identified students) holds its primary recruitment process at the beginning of the Fall semester. Interested students must register to sign up to participate in the primary recruitment process, and there is a fee to participate of $15. Those who register are expected to be available to participate throughout the duration of Primary Recruitment which usually occurs the weekend following Labor Day each year. In some cases, organizations will host Continuous Open Bidding events after primary recruitment finishes or during the Spring semester. For more information about the Panhellenic Association please visit the link here. To learn more about the PA sorority experience, check out TheSororityLife.com!\n\nOrganizations at ISU\n\nThere are 13 fraternities (male-identified), 13 sororities (female-identified), and 2 gender inclusive organizations at Indiana State University in four governing councils: Athenian Council (AC), Interfraternity Council (IFC), National Pan-Hellenic Council (NPHC), and Panhellenic Association (PA).\n\nBy clicking on the name of each chapter, you can explore their inter/national websites to learn more about each organization.\n\nPLEASE NOTE: Organizations that are listed under the inactive/unrecognized organizations heading are no longer active at the University. Students are STRONGLY DISCOURAGED from joining any organization that is listed underneath an inactive/unrecognized heading.\n\nAC IFC NPHC PA Alpha Delta Phi Society Alpha Sigma Phi Alpha Kappa Alpha Alpha Chi Omega Gamma Phi Omega Delta Sigma Phi Alpha Phi Alpha Alpha Omicron Pi Phi Sigma Pi Lambda Chi Alpha Delta Sigma Theta Alpha Phi Phi Kappa Psi Kappa Alpha Psi Alpha Sigma Alpha Pi Kappa Alpha Omega Psi Phi Chi Omega Pi Kappa Phi Sigma Gamma Rho Delta Gamma Sigma Alpha Epsilon Gamma Phi Beta Sigma Phi Epsilon Sigma Kappa Tau Kappa Epsilon Zeta Tau Alpha Theta Chi"
