        "text": "Delta Sigma Pi is an international fraternity for business students. It was founded in 1907 at New York University by four business students who felt that the majority of students on campus were ignored by the existing organization. They formed a club that would be open to all business students. In the following year, they decided to create a fraternity that would cater to the needs of business students, and Delta Sigma Pi was established. The Fraternity's colors are purple and gold, and its official publication is called The DELTASIG. Delta Sigma Pi began accepting women as members in 1975. Prior to this time, the fraternity was open only to men. The decision to allow women to join the organization was made in response to changes in society and the workforce, as more women were entering the business world and seeking networking and professional development opportunities. Today, Delta Sigma Pi is committed to promoting diversity and inclusivity within the organization and continues to welcome members of all genders.\n\nAs of September 2021, Delta Sigma Pi has over 300 collegiate and alumni chapters in the United States, with over 250,000 initiated members. The fraternity continues to grow and expand its network, providing opportunities for professional development, community service, and networking for members across a wide range of industries and locations. Additionally, Delta Sigma Pi offers various scholarships, awards, and programs to support its members throughout their academic and professional careers."
