        "text": "Recent grad Julia McAleavey shares guidance through this advice column for incoming students. A student with well-rounded experience, Julia earned a bachelor’s in advertising this spring. She transferred to Rowan her sophomore year, after another school wasn’t a great fit. While at Rowan she started as an exploratory studies major, unsure of what to major in. She’s lived both on campus and off campus, held student worker jobs and internships, and participated in clubs and sports.\n\nNew beginnings – you are starting at Rowan University. This is one of the biggest changes you will have in your life, either as a new freshman or a transfer student. You may think you are ready to be free and get away from home, and maybe you are. However, even if you are ready, you will probably still struggle with adjusting to your new life at Rowan. No matter what that struggle may be, Rowan wants you to succeed and be happy. That being said, there are several resources on campus to help with whatever you may be struggling.\n\nTutors: You may have been in the top ranks of your class in high school, but college is a whole different ball game. School might become more challenging for you. There is nothing wrong with that. Rowan offers free tutoring services to help you get out of that slump and be the best you can be. To sign up for a tutor, you can go to the Rowan website under Student Success Programs. You will matched with a tutor to help you in whatever class you need.\n\nFinancial Aid: You may be paying for college on your own. Even if you aren’t you still may need some help. Have no fear, financial aid is here! They want to help make paying for college as stress-free as possible. Visit them in Savitz Hall so they can help set up a payment plan for you.\n\nThe SHOP: Located in the Rowan Boulevard apartments near the Rowan Boulevard end of campus, The SHOP is a small food pantry that people make donations to. The donations consist of food and other necessities for students in need to take. It helps students with financial struggles to get things they need without them having to worry about paying for it. You just have to show your student ID to get inside.\n\nThe Wellness Center: Whether you are physically ill or are having some mental health struggles, the Wellness Center is here to help you. I have gone for both of these, and they were super helpful. It is a great resource and being seen by someone is free, so I highly recommend it. Plus, everything you tell your counselor is confidential, so you won’t have to worry about being exposed. There are plenty of nurses and mental health counselors available that want to help you get better. You can make an appointment online or call them.\n\nAll in all, there are tons of resources on campus to help students live a healthy life. Take advantage of them. You’ll be glad you did in the long run. Just remember that there is nothing to be embarrassed about! It may be hard to take the step to get help, but you should be proud. Most likely, you are not the only one who needs it, and you will be a role model for those who are nervous about it. Everyone at Rowan wants you to be happy, and getting help from these resources will help with that.\n\nLike what you see?\n\nLEARN MORE\n\nStory by:\n\nJulia McAleavey, advertising graduate\n\nToday we feature rising Senior Psychology Major Callie DeMaria. Callie is an off-campus resident from Little Egg Harbor, NJ (Ocean County). Callie is a first-generation college student.\n\n​On your busiest day, what academic, non-academic, and social responsibilities are you juggling?\n\nOn my busiest day, I usually have two classes I have to attend, then I usually spend the bulk of my day in Savitz Hall in the Admissions Office either doing office work or giving tours at the Welcome Center, then I will usually attend an event my sorority would be hosting or compete in an intramural game, and finally, I usually get dinner with my friends. To end the day, I will go to the library for an hour or two to finish up on some homework.\n\nDid you ever have a moment of uncertainty within your major? How did you get through the challenge?\n\nI never had a moment of uncertainty within my major. I was very stressed about what I would do with my Psychology degree. Until last year, I had no idea. Then one of my professors introduced me to Applied Behavior Analysis. After hearing about it, I knew that is exactly what I wanted to do. Now, I am applying to graduate school to receive my Masters in Applied Behavior Analysis.\n\nTell us about one moment that made you feel like Rowan was the right fit for you.\n\nI knew Rowan was the right fit for me when I took a tour of the campus. My tour guide was very knowledgeable and was able to answer all my questions. I was very interested in a lot of the clubs my tour guide mentioned as well. As soon as I got to campus, I got heavily involved and through my involvement, Rowan became my second home.\n\nTell us about your transition into college and how you pushed through any challenges.\n\nCollege was not an easy transition for me. I was a homebody in high school, so leaving my family was very hard. I won’t lie, the first few weeks were hard. But once I got involved, and started to meet new friends, I didn’t want to leave campus. Since I forced myself to go outside my comfort zone, it helped me to feel more at home and more comfortable at Rowan.\n\nWhat advice would you give your high school self about choosing a college?\n\nThe advice I would give my high school self would be to choose the college that feels like home once you step on campus, that has a ton of internships and opportunities for me, and the college that has a lot of extracurricular clubs and organizations I would love to join.\n\nLike what you see?\n\nLEARN MORE\n\nStory by:\n\nRachel Rumsby, rising sophomore communication studies and public relations double major\n\nLooking for a safe space or ways to connect with others on campus?

My name is Bianca Torres. I’m a senior Music Industry major with a minor in Marketing from Morris County, NJ who has lived on campus all four years. Going to college has helped me get out of my comfort zone and has helped me become a much more well-rounded individual! I know that adjusting to college can be tough – especially when it comes to meeting new people.\n\nGoing to Rowan was an easy decision for me. My sister had gone here before me so I already knew a lot about the school. It’s about two hours away from where I live so it was the perfect distance for me, and Rowan has a really great Music Industry program. So I was pretty confident in my decision to go there.\n\nThe one thing that I was a little nervous about: meeting new people. I was excited about being independent and on my own for the first time in college. However, it was hard for me at first to find people who I really enjoyed being with. I quickly realized that I was going to have to put myself out there more. Here’s what I did to make some new friends.\n\nReached Out to People I Already Knew.\n\nMy first friend in college is actually someone I went to high school with! Although we never talked in high school, I figured it would be a good start to talk to someone I related with at least a little bit! I came up to him one day in the Holly Pointe dining hall and we started eating together almost every day! We instantly became friends. Then he introduced me to Racquetball Club.\n\nJoined Clubs and Sports Teams.\n\nThrough Racquetball Club, I’ve found a sport that I’ve never tried but ended up really liking and found some of my best friends! Being a part of a team is a great way to meet people with the same interests and makes you feel like you are a part of something. Without Racquetball, I would have never found my friends.\n\nTalked to My Classmates.\n\nOne of my best friends is someone who was sitting right next to me in class. The first day of classes is nerve wracking enough for a lot of us and finding the right seat is crucial. When I first walked in, I found a seat that I thought would be a good spot in the classroom. I never thought I would have ended up sitting next to my now best friend and roommate! We started doing class projects together, and I realized that we liked the same things and had the same sense of humor. Finally, I decided to ask if she wanted to get lunch with me one day. The rest is history.\n\nGot To Know My Co-Workers.\n\nI made some great friends through my on-campus job for the Rowan Blog! The great thing about on-campus jobs is that your co-workers are also usually students too. From going on shoots together, talking in the office, and getting lunch in between, it’s almost hard to not know a lot about the people I work with! I’m so grateful for the Rowan Blog and for all the great friends that I’ve made from the blog too.\n\nThere are so many ways to get involved on campus and to put yourself out there. It’s difficult adjusting to an entirely new environment and situation but one of the best things about going to a university is meeting all kinds of different and exciting people! Luckily, I found my people at Rowan!\n\nLike what you see?\n\nLEARN MORE\n\nStory and Photos by:\n\nBianca Torres senior music industry major\n\nMeet future freshman Radio/ TV/Film major Allison Bruce.

I was in percussion ensemble in high school and I would love to continue that!\n\nHow or why did you choose your major?\n\nI was honestly not sure what I was going to major in until last summer when my sister got me an internship with her friend at Bridgeport Speedway. I was assisting him in filming the races there, and it was so much fun so I decided to be a Radio/TV/Film major!\n\nHow did you get to know campus?\n\nI attended an open house to get to know campus, I have friends that have taken me to a few places around campus. I am excited to keep learning about Rowan.\n\nWhat music do you like?\n\nI really like music and I listen to just about everything. The only genre that I don’t like as much would be heavy metal.\n\nNight owl or morning person?\n\nI am such a night owl. I stay up way too late way too often!\n\nWhy Rowan?\n\nI chose Rowan because I have a few friends here already, but the program and atmosphere seemed really helpful and accommodating.

She’s lived both on campus and off campus, held student worker jobs and internships, and participated in clubs and sports.\n\nRowan offers plenty of dining options for first-year students and beyond. Between all of the stations at the Holly Pointe Cafe, the eight or so restaurants in the Marketplace, and everywhere you can use your Rowan Bucks and Dining Dollars at, the options seem endless.\n\nSoon, however, you will become tired of eating the same five things in the cafe, and you probably used all of your Rowan Bucks three weeks in. With all of the studying and activities you’re involved in, eating may even seem impossible. As a freshman, you unfortunately do not have your own kitchen, but as a new transfer you might. In either case, you have this magical device called a microwave that you can cook plenty of substantial foods in (I know, I couldn’t believe it either).\n\nHere are some of my favorite foods that I made in my microwave freshman year.\n\nKraft Easy Mac n Cheese: If you don’t make this in your microwave during college, did you even go? Kraft Mac n Cheese cups are the best microwavable dish. The best part about them is that they’re so easy to make, a toddler can do it. The directions are right on the cup and your food is ready in minutes! They are also inexpensive, come in bulk, and are easy to store in your room. (Editor note: remember to put water in your Easy Mac – not doing so is one of the leading causes of fire alarms in the dorms. Yes, really.)\n\nChicken Nuggets: Since you have the mini fridge right under your microwave, you can absolutely keep some chicken nuggets in there. They are quick, easy, and a classic that never gets old. Just make sure to read how long to cook them for so you don’t undercook them.\n\nPizza rolls/Bagel Bites: Another classic, childhood favorite item. They can easily be stored in the mini fridge and are ready to eat in minutes. Pizza rolls and Bagel Bites make the perfect snack or light lunch when you need something fast.\n\nDuncan Hines Cake in a Mug: Perfect for when you need a little comfort food. It is like baking a fresh cake at home, but you have the convenience of making it in your microwave (just don’t forget to pack a mug!) They come in so many different flavors, it makes it almost impossible to choose! My favorite is the banana bread, just to make it a little easier for you.\n\nIn all honesty, I highly suggest utilizing the cuisine Rowan provides for you most of the time. There are times though, where you are busy studying or need to rush around from work to class, and that just isn’t possible. These microwavable foods are great options and are super easy to make. Enjoy them!\n\nLike what you see?\n\nLEARN MORE\n\nStory by:\n\nJulia McAleavey, advertising graduate\n\nRecent grad Julia McAleavey shares guidance through this advice column for incoming students.

While at Rowan she started as an exploratory studies major, unsure of what to major in. She’s lived both on campus and off campus, held student worker jobs and internships, and participated in clubs and sports.\n\nCollege is an extremely busy time for all of us. Whether you are rushing from class to a job or up all night studying, you barely have time to breathe, let alone thinking about what to eat. Having a few quick, healthy snacks in your room and your backpack, is the best way to get you fueled up and going strong. Here are some of my favorite snacks to keep around that will keep your mind and your body healthy, and keep you energized throughout the day.\n\nVeggies and dip: You will probably have a mini-fridge in your room at Rowan, so keeping these is definitely possible. Carrot sticks with a low fat dip are the perfect homework snack when you’re sitting at your desk.\n\nApples: You can even buy them in slices, but they’re a little bit pricier. You can never go wrong with an apple a day! They also pair nicely with some peanut butter, if you want to add something a little more filling.\n\nString Cheese: Snack on these in your room or on your way out the door to class. They are a great source of protein and will hold you over for a whole class.\n\nProtein bars: A classic snack and super easy to store and carry around. Protein bars are a substantial snack to keep in your backpack for anytime you might need it. Just make sure you read the labels in the store to see the actual number of grams of protein. Find the best fit one for you.\n\nTrail mix: My personal favorite snack ever! Keep a big container of trail mix with zip lock bags in your room and make a bag for on the go.\n\nDon’t stress about food in college. Make time to eat and stay healthy to avoid the freshman fifteen. Hopefully, these energizing, filling, and best of all, guilt-free snacks will treat you well throughout your college career!\n\nLike what you see?\n\nLEARN MORE\n\nStory by:\n\nJulia McAleavey, advertising graduate\n\nMeet Musical Theatre major Lexie Miller from Hampton, NJ (Hunterdon County).

I’ve played soccer since I was seven up until my sophomore year of high school and I’d like to pick it back up for fun!\n\nHow or why did you choose your major?\n\nI chose my major, Musical Theatre, because I can’t imagine myself doing anything else. I love performing and telling stories, which is why I also want to minor in Creative Writing. When I researched Rowan’s theatre program and auditioned in January, it automatically felt like home and the place I’d want to spend the next four years.\n\nHow did you get to know campus?\n\nWhen I came to campus in January to audition for the Theatre program, it was the first time I saw anything about the campus. I was taken by surprise how much like home the campus felt just by riding through in my car. After I got accepted to the school and program, I took a tour and fell even more in love with the school and all it has to offer!\n\nWhat music do you like?\n\nI have a wide range of music I like, from Queen to Billie Eilish to Bruno Mars. I’m pretty much down to listen to any music!\n\nNight owl or morning person?\n\nI’m definitely a night owl, I can stay up late and feel fine, but if I have to wake up early It’s a struggle!\n\nWhy Rowan?\n\nRowan is and was my first choice because as soon as I stepped foot on campus I got a feeling that this was the place I wanted to be.

Hilda is an Athletic Training major all the way from Farmington, New Hampshire! She tells us more about how Rowan became her home away from home and how she adjusted to living on campus in South Jersey.\n\nTell us a about the change from New Hampshire to South Jersey:\n\nSouth Jersey was a huge change for me because not only was it far from home but also New Jersey is wildly different than New Hampshire.\n\nRowan is roughly a 7-hour drive from my house, so making Rowan a home away from home was really important to me. I made sure to print out a bunch of pictures of my friends and family and of course my pets. I hung all them on a set of string lights so that I’d be able to see them every time I went back to my dorm. I also made sure to bring an air freshener version of my favorite candle and some other little decorations from home.\n\nLiving in the dorm wasn’t a new experience for me because I had gone to prep school for part of high school, but New Jersey was a bigger change than I realized. Even the trees and flowers were different than the ones I had at home. I had to get used to the lack of wild animals, like deer and the occasional bear. Rowan mainly has geese. I also have an off-campus job so I needed to get gas. Getting gas for the first time was a weird experience because my whole life I grew up pumping my own gas, and then suddenly I was in a state where people did it for you.\n\nHow have you made Rowan your home away from home?\n\nRowan really has become a home away from home to me and I’ve met some of the most amazing people here and made friends that I don’t know what I would do without. This community is a place where I can be myself, meet new people everyday, and support my friends from other teams. I didn’t realize I could fall in love with a place that’s an hour away from the beach, but South Jersey and Rowan really has my heart.\n\nLike what you see?\n\nLEARN MORE\n\nStory by:\n\nBianca Torres, senior music industry major\n\nPhoto provided by:\n\nHilda Barrioz, sophomore athletic training major\n\nHeader photo courtesy of:\n\nUnsplash\n\nToday, we speak to rising sophomore Sydney Basis. She is from Marlboro, NJ (Monmouth County) and is an on-campus resident. Sydney is a former Exploratory Studies major who then made the decision to become a Psychology major. She’s going to tell us a little more about her experience as an Exploratory Studies major and how she eventually chose the right fit for her!\n\nHow and why did you find Rowan?\n\nWhen the time came to start applying for colleges, I had not heard of Rowan yet. Some of my friends were talking about applying to Rowan because they had heard great things about it, so I decided to look into it. After looking around Rowan’s website, I decided to book a campus tour and immediately loved the campus environment. Before my freshman year started, I was still concerned that I could have made the wrong choice but after going to Rowan, I knew that it was the perfect choice for me and I couldn’t have picked a better school.\n\nWhy did you originally choose Exploratory Studies?\n\nI chose Exploratory Studies because going into my freshman year, I had no idea what I wanted to do. I was really excited to try out all different areas of study because I knew I would eventually find the perfect major for me, which I did. This program was so amazing because it really gave me the freedom to try out everything I was interested in and I was not stuck to just one subject matter.\n\nWhat has been your favorite experience as an Exploratory Studies major?\n\nMy favorite experience as an Exploratory Studies major has definitely been meeting people throughout all of the different classes I have taken. Since you are taking so many different classes to find your interests, you meet people from all different majors and all different career paths. I also enjoyed the Exploratory Studies seminars that Rowan held to give students an idea of what each major at Rowan was like and it gave us the opportunity to speak with the advisors in charge of the majors. This was very helpful to me.\n\nWhat major are you going into?\n\nI decided to become a Psychology major because I realized that I would like to become an occupational therapist in the future. Although Rowan does not have an OT program, their Psychology program and other classes outside of this program will prepare me for graduate school, which is something I am very excited about.\n\nHow did you figure out what major was “the one”?\n\nI was always very interested in psychology, but never really knew what could be done with this degree. I looked at the program guide on Rowan’s website and I loved the classes that it offered. I then looked further and researched the different career opportunities in the field. I found occupational therapy through my research and knew that’s what I wanted to do in the future. Searching around Rowan’s website helped a lot through this whole process.\n\nAny advice to Exploratory Studies majors? Or general advice to Rowan students?\n\nFor any Exploratory Studies students, I would definitely tell you that this program is not just about finding what programs you do like, it is also about finding ones that you do not like. It may be disappointing when you do not enjoy a class that you thought you would be interested in, but it is ultimately bringing you closer to a decision because you were able to rule out that field. This will break down your choices and find the perfect major and career for you which is the main goal.\n\nAlso, if there are any fields of study that you do enjoy already, I would look into what careers you can do with that kind of degree. This is what helped me find my major and dream job. The Rowan website is very helpful, so you should check it out!\n\nLike what you see?\n\nLEARN MORE\n\nStory by:\n\nBianca Torres, senior music industry major\n\nPhoto provided by:\n\nSydney Basis, sophomore psychology major\n\nHeader photo courtesy of:\n\nUnsplash\n\nToday we feature Theatre major Julia Rivenburg from Waldorf, Maryland (Charles County). Julia also has a concentration in Pre-Teaching and is currently pursing her Master of Science in Teaching (M.S.T.) in Theatre Education while commuting to campus.\n\nCould you share your favorite moment with a faculty member or a favorite experience in one of your classes?\n\nSome of my favorite faculty moments include being in the Theatre and Dance office with Caitlin Reed and Dr. Elisabeth Hostetter the past three years. I always have wonderful conversations with them about the professional world and they always seem to be able to guide me in the right direction when I need them. Being an out-of-state student, you truly want someplace to feel at home, and with Caitlin and Dr. Liz I never feel homesick.\n\nWhat is the most amazing or interesting ​thing you’ve learned in your major this year?\n\nThis year, the most interesting thing I learned was probably everything that goes into being a director. I waited very patiently to be able to take Directing with Lane Savadove and was so excited to be able to learn about how to apply viewpoints to your directing and being able to execute a point of view.\n\nWhat pre-professional experiences are helping to support your growth?\n\nAs far as pre-professional opportunities, I am very fortunate have been a stage manager for multiple Lab Theatre and Mainstage Productions at Rowan, an executive board member for USITT (co-president 2019-2020, senator 2017-2019) and Rowan Lab Theatre (box office coordinator and co-publicity manager), and to currently be the resident house manager over in Bunce Hall’s Tohill Theatre, as well one of the student event coordinators for the Mid-Atlantic Regional College Auditions. Each of these opportunities has furthered my growth in the theatre management field and are titles that I wear proudly.\n\nOn top of all of the opportunities I have had the last three years, I am also pleased to announce that next year I will be assistant directing both the musical theatre Cabaret and Heathers alongside Dr. Christopher Marlowe Roche as well as directing The Love Song of J. Robert Oppenheimer in the Lab Theatre.\n\nLike what you see?\n\nLEARN MORE\n\nHeader photo courtesy of:\n\nRowan Theatre Department Flickr\n\nRecent grad Julia McAleavey shares guidance through this advice column for incoming students.

While at Rowan she started as an exploratory studies major, unsure of what to major in. She’s lived both on campus and off campus, held student worker jobs and internships, and participated in clubs and sports.\n\nThe day you’ve been waiting for since you committed to Rowan is almost here: move-in day! In short, this day is filled with a mix of emotions.\n\nYou’re excited to start college to move away for the first time. You might also be overwhelmed because of all of the stuff you have to move and the hustle and bustle happening around you. Of course, you also might be a little sad to be leaving your family, even if you don’t want to admit it.\n\nYou cannot necessarily prevent these emotions, but here are some ways to prevent stress and anxiety on move-in day.\n\nTake your time setting up your room: You do not have to organize every single thing before your family leaves you. Have them help you bring stuff up and set up the things that you definitely will need help with. You can do the rest on your own. You are moving in a few days early, so you will still have time to adjust your room to the way you like it before classes start.\n\nEveryone else is in the same boat as you: This goes for your roommate, their family, everyone on your floor, the building, and every freshmen on campus. This is a brand-new experience for everyone! You are all probably overwhelmed with setting up your space. You will all miss your families and they will all miss you.\n\nBreathe! This is an exciting an overwhelming time for you. You might be emotionally overwhelmed, and that is okay! You will be okay! Don’t forget to pause, take a breath and remember that everything is going to be okay.\n\nLike I said, move-in day is a crazy time for everyone involved. There are so many mixed feelings about leaving home for the first time. Your journey as a Prof is about to begin! It’s a lot to take in, but keeping these things in mind will help you get through move-in day.\n\nLike what you see?\n\nLEARN MORE\n\nStory by:\n\nJulia McAleavey, advertising graduate\n\nMove-in day is approaching quickly, and you are home making your pack list. Packing for college is an exciting time! You’re probably thinking about how you are going to decorate your room, and what color schemes you’ll want to use. It is likely though, however, that you will pack way more than you need. Remember, your living space is smaller and you may be sharing space. Here are some things that are absolutely worth packing, and some things you can probably do without.\n\nWhat to pack\n\nYour favorite plate/bowl: For when you want to use the microwave, these are really all you’ll need. You do not have a kitchen though, so don’t bring more than one or two.\n\nOne set of silverware: To go with the bowl and plate.\n\nMug: For coffee or that late night hot chocolate.\n\nDish soap and sponge: To clean all your things!\n\nFirst aid kit: Anything can happen in college, you never know when you might need a Band Aid.\n\nExtra set of sheets: News flash, you have to clean those. Do yourself a favor and bring an extra set so you can swap them out.\n\nSmall tool kit: Just in case something breaks or a screw needs to be tightened.\n\nDesk Lamp: Not all dorm rooms have overhead lighting. While window light is great, you’ll definitely need one of these.\n\nCommand strips: To hang decor, as well as to use as hangers for clothes, towels, etc.\n\nBike: Use a bike, skateboard, or roller blades to get in some outdoor time. They make it super easy to get to class easy too.\n\nWhat to leave home\n\nMost of your t-shirts: You’ll get free ones at campus events. Plus, you’ll find yourself wearing the same ones over and over again.\n\nCurtains, tapestries and candles: These go against the Rowan fire code. Resident assistants will make you take them down, so leave them home.\n\nWinter clothes: You won’t need those for a few more months. Bring your favorite jacket and a couple extra layers. If you’re close to home, you can always run back and swap winter/summer clothes.\n\nKitchen appliances (like a blender): Your living space is too small for these types of things. If you want a smoothie, there are places on campus you can go and use your meal plan at. Save the kitchen stuff for next year when you have a kitchen.\n\nExcessive decorations: They’re a pain to put up and take down. You aren’t living their forever. Just pick two or three of your favorite.\n\nAll in all, make the most of your space your first year of college. There really is no room for clutter, especially when sharing a room. Pack was it absolutely necessary, and you won’t have anything to worry about.\n\nLike what you see, come visit us!\n\nLEARN MORE\n\nStory by:\n\nJulia McAleavey, advertising graduate\n\nToday we feature rising sophomore Monica A. Torres. Monica is a Computer Science major with a concentration in Software Engineering from Jersey City, NJ (Hudson County). Monica is an on-campus resident. She lived in Evergreen Hall during her freshman year, and now will be living in the Edgewood Park Apartments for her sophomore year. Monica is a first-generation college student.\n\nWhat did you most enjoy during your freshman year at Rowan?\n\nThe thing I enjoyed the most was getting a feel for everything. There are a lot of activities set up for freshmen not only for them to have fun, but for them to get a feel for the campus. One, for example, is Welcome Week, where many students from all grades come together to enjoy each other’s company and welcome the freshman and new transfer students to campus. I enjoyed meeting new people and seeing that Rowan is very diverse.\n\nCould you share a happy moment you had with friends, professors, or other members of the Rowan community that made you realize Rowan felt like home?\n\nOne of my favorite memories was getting to know my roommate. We were familiar with each other through PCI (Pre-College Institute), aka EOF (Educational Opportunity Fund), over the summer, but we didn’t really talk. However, once I got to know her, we had a lot in common, and exploring campus with her was fun. I’m from Jersey City, so to have someone who is from South Jersey as a close friend is great, because we get to compare North Jersey and South Jersey.\n\nWhat advice do you have for future freshmen looking at colleges right now?\n\nMy advice to future freshmen is that it isn’t about getting a good grade, it’s about understanding the material for your major. In addition, it’s okay to not know what you wanna study right off the bat because that is what advisors are for. They are there to help you explore and find a major that suits you.\n\nWhat are you most looking forward to next year at Rowan?\n\nI can’t wait for some of my friends from home to come to Rowan. I can show them around and help them get around. Plus, it means the friend group on campus gets bigger. It will be nice to have a few familiar faces from home on campus, to be honest, because I won’t be as homesick.\n\nLike what you see?\n\nLEARN MORE\n\nStory by:\n\nRachel Rumsby, rising sophomore communication studies and public relations double major\n\nToday’s story is from Melanie Sbaraglio, a recent Public Relations and Advertising graduate from Nutley, NJ (Essex County). Melanie joined the Rowan Blog team to wrap up her remaining internship hours, after her internship with Ace Screen Printing in Glassboro was cut short due to COVID-19 affecting business.\n\nSince I’ve lived with roommates for all four years of college, I feel like I experienced a lot. There are going to be times when you feel like it’s the greatest thing in the world and then other times when you want to pull your hair out. However, I am lucky enough that I am best friends with my roommates, so even when conflict arises it is usually something we eventually laugh about.\n\nOne of my first tips is to be prepared for a lot of sharing. Especially if you’re the roommate who has the best clothes. In my case I am that roommate. I didn’t think I would be the one that everyone wants to borrow from but my closet gets raided by at least two roommates whenever we are getting ready to go out. The important thing to remember here is to have patience and to keep track of who takes what.\n\nNext, make sure that everyone does their part when it comes to cleaning up after themselves. My roommates and I developed a weekly chore list and everyone gets a task for the week. For example, taking out the trash, cleaning the floors or cleaning the bathrooms. Although we still argue at times when the kitchen is left a mess or the drain gets clogged this where more patience comes in because with six people in one house messes are for sure going to pile up.\n\nAnother pro tip is to have house meetings. With six girls living together who are all very vocal with their opinions it is important to get everything out in the open at one time. No one likes having conflict in their house especially when it’s the place you come home to after a long day of classes or other activities.\n\nMy last tip is something that I have realized over the years. Don’t sweat the small stuff because this is a time of life where you’re supposed to be having fun and enjoying your time with the people around you. Sometimes my roommates will walk downstairs with my clothes on and say, “Oh by the way I’m gonna borrow this.” Other times we argue over things like who left all the lights on or who let their garbage pile up without taking it outside. In reality these things are small issues that can be easily talked out.\n\nI have become the type of person who lets a lot of things slide without saying anything because I think about whether it’s really something that bothers me in the long run and usually the answer is no. I think this can be good to an extent but if something is really getting on your nerves don’t let it keep happening; otherwise, you’re going to let it all build up and just explode one day. Talk things out, keep yourself grounded and remember the important thing is to enjoy your time living with your best friends while you can.\n\nLike what you see?\n\nLEARN MORE\n\nStory by:\n\nMelanie Sbaraglio, senior public relations and advertising graduate\n\nToday we feature third-year Psychology major and Urban Studies minor Jeremiah Garcia. Jeremiah is a first-generation college student from Camden, NJ (Camden County). Jeremiah is also a Residence Assistant (RA) in Evergreen Hall.\n\nHow does being involved on campus impact your college experience?\n\nI am an RA and I am involved in the Minority Association of Premedical Students (MAPS), and the Residence Hall Association (RHA). I was able to step outside of my comfort zone, learn leadership and confidence, and feel like I have my voice heard. As an RA I help incoming freshmen with things I had a hard time with. This has made me a better person and made me not afraid to use my voice.\n\nHow were you able to make friends on campus?\n\nI made friends by going to the Rec Center. I was able to get my mind right at the Rec Center when things got hard and I met people there. I also met people at events, Rowan After Hours (RAH) and classes. Freshman year was competitive, but you have to be a leader in class and make study groups or say that you should get lunch together. It depends on the class, though. Some are more group-oriented than others.\n\nHow were you able to adjust to campus life?\n\nI was able to adjust by getting help and using Rowan’s resources. Putting myself out there was the best way to adjust. It gave me confidence and a push to succeed.\n\nWhat does inclusivity mean to you?\n\nSome people are different, and it is important to have inclusivity so that people can make new friends and have the same opportunities as everyone else regardless of race, gender and appearance.\n\nDo you think that Rowan is inclusive?\n\nYes. Everyone has the opportunity to be in leadership positions, they just need to do well academically and have the confidence to earn the positions. Rowan is inclusive.\n\nWhat are you looking forward to next year?\n\nBeing on campus. I miss campus. I am also excited to get into new opportunities. I would like to try out for the baseball team and to get into an honors society. It will be my second year as an RA and I am looking forward to the experience. I am also looking forward to taking new classes, doing well in my major and getting better grades.\n\nLike what you see?\n\nLEARN MORE\n\nStory by:\n\nRachel Rumsby, rising sophomore communication studies and public relations double major\n\nRecent grad Julia McAleavey shares guidance through this advice column for incoming students.

While at Rowan she started as an exploratory studies major, unsure of what to major in. She’s lived both on campus and off campus, held student worker jobs and internships, and participated in clubs and sports.\n\nIt’s no secret that you become responsible for a lot of things when you move away to college. You’re living on your own. Mom and Dad aren’t there to help you with every little thing. One thing that many college freshmen have to learn to do when they move away is, you guessed it, laundry. It sounds scary and easy to mess up, but it is actually a very simple process. Here are some easy steps to successfully do your laundry.\n\nSeparate your clothes: By this, I mean by whites, colors, and delicates. You do not want your white clothes being stained by that one neon pink shirt you have, and you do not want your silk blouse to be ruined because it wasn’t on the delicate cycle. Separating your clothes makes a stress-free laundry process, and the machine settings are very simple to use, making the process even easier.\n\nUse one or two pods per load: I highly recommend starting with laundry pods over liquid detergent. All you do is throw it in with your clothes and it does all the work. You don’t need more than one or two, depending on the load size, so they last a few months. I switched to liquid detergent once I got the hang of it since it is usually cheaper. You can do the same, but for the first few times, the pods are perfect.\n\nOne or two dryer sheets per load: This is similar to the pods. You do not need more than one or two dryer sheets, but be sure to use them. If you don’t throw one in, your clothes will not feel the same when you take them out of the dryer, and will be very uncomfortable to wear.\n\nSet a timer for when your laundry will be done: I beg you, please DO NOT be that person the forgets (or is too lazy), that their laundry is in the machine. There have been times where I couldn’t use a machine for hours or had to go to another floor because people left their laundry sitting in there. Set a timer so you do not forget about it, and try not to leave the building until your laundry is finished.\n\nDoing your own laundry might sound scary at first if you’ve never done it before. I remember being so scared of destroying all of my clothes, but don’t be scared. It really is not a hard process at all. It’ll be like clockwork once you get used to it. Just follow these steps and you’ll be a pro in no time.\n\nLike what you see?\n\nLEARN MORE\n\nToday we feature Peterson Dossous, a recent Rowan graduate who studied Sociology from Jersey City, NJ (Hudson County). Peterson reflects on his experience as a Prof and how he made the most out of his college experience.\n\nDid you have an on-campus job?\n\nI worked for the Office of Career Advancement, which consisted of filing documents, answering phones, managing meetings, preparing career fairs, engaging and interacting with students. It was a great opportunity to acquire well-rounded skills to apply in an office setting post-grad. It enhanced my customer service, Excel sheet and interpersonal communication skills.\n\nDo you have any mentors at Rowan?\n\nMr. Richard Jones, [Vice President of Student Engagement], has been a mentor of mine. I was part of a new program he was starting up to best interact with students and increase student participation on campus, which helped to broaden my horizon.\n\nWhat is your favorite academic or professional accomplishment?\n\nThat I graduated and am in the position I’m in. Not everyone gets the opportunity or finds the motivation to go to college where I’m from.\n\nWhat got you interested in your intended field?\n\nI was always interested in finding the reasons why people do the things they do. Originally, I was a psych major but changed due to the amount of school you need to go through and knowing how much money people pay psychologists to receive help. I want to figure out the common problem a group of people have and create a space for them to relate and resolve the problem.\n\nSociology keeps the mind running and I love it. I will never stop thinking and learning in my field. I get to live and learn through everybody else. I will use their testimonies for future experiences.\n\nEventually, I’d love to help traumatized soldiers transition into society. Every group of people is institutionalized in their own way. Students in school, inmates in prison, soldiers in combat. Soldiers don’t have an accessible outlet. Most people can call a friend, parent, or mentor to mellow you out; but as a soldier, not many people can relate to the suffering or they have difficulty opening up. Talking to a counselor engages everyone in the discussion. It teaches them the tools to reclaim a “normal” lifestyle and how to handle and cope with certain environments.\n\nWhat knowledge or skills have you developed through your time at Rowan that you will take into you for future endeavors?\n\nThe most important lesson I’ve learned at Rowan is exercising social skills — articulating a conversation, guiding important discussions, interacting in the corporate world … being punctual, organized and accountable.\n\nLike what you see?\n\nLEARN MORE\n\nStory by:\n\nAlyssa Bauer, public relations graduate\n\nPhotos courtesy of:\n\nPeterson Dossous\n\nToday, we speak to Jay Petersen, a sophomore Mechanical Engineering major from Edison, NJ (Middlesex County). Jay is an on-campus resident and a fourth-generation college student! Jay tells us more about himself, his major and when he’s not in the classroom, his passion for flying.\n\nHow did you find Rowan?\n\nMy parents had me work with college counselors my Junior year of high school and they really encouraged me to focus on a school that matches my personality and interests. I had the chance to attend Purdue but being born and raised in NJ, I’m very rooted here. Rowan also felt more like home. The campus wasn’t overwhelming, the staff was incredibly nice and welcoming. It was an experience that made me feel very comfortable. I didn’t experience that same attention and sincereness from the other big schools. At Rowan I’m not just a number but I’m a member of a community — especially with the honors program I’m in!\n\nWhy did you choose your major?\n\nEver since I was young I knew I wanted to be an engineer like my dad. It’s all I’ve been around my whole life and his work motivated me to explore this option further. I contemplated a focus in medicine but in the end, engineering just aligned more to my interests.\n\nHow did you come to find your interest in flying? Did anyone push you in the right direction?\n\nIt all really started with a test flight that my parents gifted me for my 17th birthday but aeronautics has always fascinated me. Whether it’s figuring out how they put a plane together or actually getting it in the air, the whole process is intriguing. Who knows, I may end up using my degree to get into that field long term, but flying just seemed like a natural skill to obtain. Something about knowing you’re in control of this machine and figuring out how to get yourself off the ground is amazing.\n\nDo you fly over campus often?\n\nYes, I try to fly by about once a month. I also try to do as many cross-country flights as possible. That’s when you fly from one airport to another that is at least 75 miles away. This gives me practice in my communications with air traffic control for neighboring commercial airports. The further you can fly in one trip, the more confident you feel.\n\nWhat’s the best part about becoming a pilot?\n\nIt’s a sense of accomplishment and the freedom to go wherever I want without the Jersey traffic! Knowing I can achieve this and pass a six-hour FAA exam makes me feel like I can do much more in life. Sky’s the limit! (pun intended).\n\nAny advice to students or those looking into getting a private pilot license or learning to fly?\n\nFind the right school. Having an instructor that is committed to you and your goal is very important. Also make sure you are going to be able to invest the time and money. I was very fortunate to have my parents support me financially and mentally so that really did help me get through it. It’s not easy to balance this goal with school so try to do it in your summer months.\n\nLike what you see?\n\nLEARN MORE\n\nStory by:\n\nBianca Torres, senior music industry major\n\nPhotos provided by:\n\nJay Petersen, sophomore mechanical engineering major\n\nMeet incoming freshman Accounting major Lily Fuchs. Lily will commute to Rowan from Mullica Hill, NJ (Gloucester County). Today, she tells us a little more about herself and why she chose Rowan University.\n\nWhat is something you’re looking forward to next year at Rowan?\n\nWhen I get to campus, I am looking forward to making new friends and building connections within the Rowan community, as well as getting involved in clubs and activities!\n\nWhat is one activity, club, sport or hobby that you did in high school that you’d like to continue with at Rowan? (Or, something new you’d like to try?)\n\nIn high school, I was part of my school’s tennis team, and I would really like to continue playing tennis when I come to Rowan!\n\nHow or why did you choose your major?​\n\nI chose accounting as my major because I have always loved working with numbers and I feel like it would be a good fit for my personality as someone who is very organized and detail-oriented.\n\nHow did you get to know campus?\n\nI live close to campus, so I have already been somewhat familiar with it, but to get to know it better, I attended a tour, an admitted students’ day and virtual sessions.\n\nWhat kind of music do you like?\n\nI listen to all different types of music, but mostly pop.\n\nNight owl or morning person?\n\nI am definitely more of a morning person, as I am excited to start each day!\n\nWhy Rowan?\n\nI chose Rowan because I have seen it change over the years and I am very impressed with how it has grown. It’s in the perfect location and is the right size for me. I cannot wait to start in the fall!\n\nLike what you see?\n\nLEARN MORE\n\nStory by:\n\nBianca Torres, senior music industry major\n\nMeet Loredonna Fiore, junior Public Relations and Advertising double major with a minor in Communication Studies from Elk Township, NJ (Gloucester County). Loredonna was a Resident Assistant (RA) for Chestnut Hall this past year until COVID-19 shut down campus. She looks forward to being the Assistant Resident Director (ARD) of Mimosa Hall in the fall and shares how RA’s help students comfortably transition into college life.\n\nNew room, new roommate, new classes, new life! These are the paramount changes that people living on Rowan’s campus undergo when transitioning through college.\n\nTo help with life in a residence hall, your resident assistant can be a major resource for you.\n\nTo begin, resident assistants are required to host at least 5 events that residents can attend on various campus locations. The first event type is a community builder. Community building programs happen within the residence hall and are meant to unify the members of a floor/residence hall as a whole. Whether it is a gaming tournament, a self-care night, or a DIY craft party, community builders are designed to be social and fun for members of the hall.\n\nThe other event type is the Campus Community Connection programs. These programs are made in an effort to unify the students with the greater Rowan community by exposing them to Rowan-run activities or resources around campus. These include meditation classes, career fairs or even a 10,000 bingo night.\n\nAlong with programming, resident assistants are available for the students they serve on a deeper level. Once a semester, resident assistants conduct a one-on-one meeting with students. During these meetings, students will be able to discuss academics, involvement, the environment in the residence halls, overall emotional/mental health, and any other concerns the student may have. Resident assistants have a list of resources available to help direct students not only during one-on-one meetings, but at any point throughout the semester as well.\n\nCommunity meetings will also be hosted throughout the year to stimulate an ongoing conversation among residents to ensure their health, happiness, and safety. During these meetings, there will be discussions about residence hall policy, fun happenings around Rowan (programs, athletic events, live shows), and different suggestions about how students can live in harmony in a residence hall.\n\nYour resident assistant is basically a built-in support system and friend that Rowan gives each student. They are trained for weeks in the summer to effectively handle all different situations and to advocate for the needs of all residents. During move-in week, stop by to see your RA and begin to develop a relationship with them. As an RA, I can promise they will be delighted to meet you and get to know you throughout the school year.\n\nLike what you see?\n\nLEARN MORE\n\nStory by:\n\nLoredonna Fiore, junior public relations and advertising double major\n\nToday’s feature is from Bianca Torres, a senior Music Industry major with a minor in Marketing from Morris County, NJ. She most recently lived on campus in Whitney Center. She writes: “Going to a college farther away from home has helped me get out of my comfort zone and has helped me become a much more well-rounded individual! I know that adjusting to living at school can be a big change.”\n\nWhether you live 30 minutes or five hours away, when you make the decision to live on campus, its important to think about what you’re going to be packing when you go to school. Here’s some advice on what you should pack and how you should pack!\n\nDon’t bring too much or bring too little.\n\nFinding the right balance of stuff to bring is important because you never want to end up having too little or too much. Make sure you’re bringing the essentials and enough to get you through weeks or months of living at school.\n\nBe organized.\n\nStaying organized when it comes to packing away for school makes the grueling process of moving in a lot easier and quicker. It can also help you stay organized in your new space once you have everything laid out.\n\nCommunicate with your roommate(s) about what they’re bringing and what you are sharing.\n\nIf you are living with other students, make sure you’re all on the same page of what to bring and what you are sharing with each other. That way you can split up the items and costs amongst each other.\n\nMake a list of things you think you’ll need to bring.\n\nMaking a list is always helpful to keep yourself organized and to help you remember what you need to bring with you and what you think you may need to get later.\n\nMake sure you have the essentials!\n\nAt the end of the day, make sure you’re bring the really important things. If you live far away, it’ll be harder to get those essentials that you need!\n\nDon’t forget to bring something to decorate!\n\nDon’t forget the fun stuff! Always bring something to decorate your space to really make it your own! Living away from home can be hard and personalizing your room could help make it more comfortable for you. Your living space will be your home away from home so might as well make it something you love!\n\nLike what you see?\n\nLEARN MORE\n\nStory by:\n\nBianca Torres, senior music industry major\n\nRecent grad Julia McAleavey shares guidance through this advice column for incoming students.

While at Rowan she started as an exploratory studies major, unsure of what to major in.

In the wise words of Forest Gump, they’re like a box of chocolates: you never know what you’re going to get. They are probably the first person you will ever live with that isn’t a family member. Not to mention the fact that a lot of you have probably never shared a room before, and your freshman year living space is rather tight. Here are some tips on living with a roommate and how to handle certain situations.\n\nDo not stress too much about choosing your first-year roommate. Chances are, you will be placed in a Facebook group created by Rowan so you can meet your fellow future Profs. A lot of the time, people use this opportunity to choose a roommate. I did this, and my roommate and I were great friends. However, a lot of other students go into this thinking their roommate will be their best friend since they chose each other, and it ends up being the complete opposite. You can end up spending too much time together and not branching out, among other things, which will ultimately cause you to get annoyed with each other. At the end of the day, whether you choose them or not, they’re still a stranger and you won’t know what they’re really like until you live with them. Going in random may sound skeptical, but that’s how it was always done before technology! I’ve heard some great stories about random roommates, so I would keep that option in mind.\n\nRespect each ether’s space: Okay, this sounds a little challenging because you do not have much space to begin with. It’s easy to feel claustrophobic and get in each other’s way every so often. However, once you move all of your stuff in, divide the room evenly so that you each have your own areas for homework, sleeping, etc. One person leaving their stuff on the other person’s side of the room can get frustrating after a while, so stick to your side.\n\nBorrowing items is okay, but always ask! There may be times that you and your roommate need to borrow things from each other. You might need to borrow a calculator for a test because yours broke, or your roommate might have run out of water bottles and needs to take one of yours to work. Even borrowing outfits for an interview or a party from each other is a common thing. Think about this though: if you were all of a sudden missing a calculator, or came home and saw your roommate in your shirt without any warning, how would you feel? Probably pretty frustrated. To avoid an argument, always ask permission to borrow items. Your future roommate will likely say yes 99% of the time.\n\nRespect each other’s sleep and study schedules! This is probably the one that causes the most conflict between roommates. Picture this: It is after midnight, you have an eight A.M. class in the morning, and your roommate comes in with people. It could be just one friend, but it could also be multiple. Either way, it is disrespectful to you and your schedule. To avoid situations like this, go over each other’s schedules before the semester begins. That way, your roommate can hang out in one of their friends’ rooms or the student center (it’s open till one A.M!) on those nights. This also goes for when you have to study for a big exam or have a project to finish and need your space. Ask them to hang out somewhere else, or go to the library, which is also open pretty late with tons of study space.\n\nOverall, living in a dorm with a complete stranger is an adjustment. If you’ve never shared a room before, this is the first time you do not truly have your own space. Your first year roommate doesn’t have to be your best friend at Rowan, but following these suggestions will at least help you to get along in your living space. If you have issues that won’t get better, or your roommate is doing things in your room that make you feel unsafe or uncomfortable, don’t be afraid to talk to your resident assistant. They are there to help you work things out. Right now, try not to worry so much about it. Go into your new living space with an open mind and positive attitude. With that mindset, you and your new roommate will be off to a great start.\n\nLike what you see?\n\nLEARN MORE"
