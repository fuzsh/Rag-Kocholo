Let me give you a visual-- by \"I don't care for football,\" I mean last Sunday I spent the day reading Allure magazine while my boyfriend watched football... for six hours. But I know I'm in the minority, so this Famous Greeks post will highlight the fraternities of your favorite football players.\n\nBroncos' player Wes Welker is a member of Phi Delta Theta.\n\nNew Orleans Saints quarterback, Drew Brees, is a member of Sigma Chi.\n\nFormer NFL player, Wes Chandler, is a member of Alpha Phi Alpha.\n\nOllie Matson was a member of Alpha Delta Gamma.\n\nNew England Patriots Coach, Bill Belichick, is a member of Chi Psi.\n\nJohn Elway, former quarterback of the Broncos, is a brother of Delta Tau Delta.\n\nFormer runningback for the Dallas Cowboys, Emmit Smith, is a member of Phi Beta Sigma.\n\nJerry Rice, receiver for the San Francisco 49ers, is also a member of Phi Beta Sigma.\n\nTony Romo, quarterback for the Dallas Cowboys, is a member of Sigma Pi.\n\nFormer Giants quarterback, Phil Simms is a member of Tau Kappa Epsilon.\n\nI hope you enjoyed this Famous Greeks installment! Maybe Famous Greeks XII will be all famous sorority women. Let me know if you have ideas for an all women category!\n\n-Michelle Giuseffi"
