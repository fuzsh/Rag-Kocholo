        "text": "The Sigma Pi Creed\n\n“I Believe in Sigma Pi, a Fellowship of kindred minds,\n\nunited in Brotherhood to advance Truth and Justice,\n\nto promote Scholarship, to encourage Chivalry,\n\nto diffuse Culture, and to develop Character,\n\nin the Service of God and Man; and I will strive\n\nto make real the Fraternity's ideals in my own daily life.”\n\n“...a Fellowship of kindred minds...”\n\nChapter History\n\nChartered as K-State's first new IFC Fraternity in nearly 30 years\n\nReceived the KSU Greek Community's Unity Award in our first year\n\nInitiated our first group of New Members (Alpha Class)\n\nWon Homecoming 2009, Wildcat Frontier\n\nFraternity History\n\nFounded at Vincennes University as Tau Phi Delta\n\nAssumed the name Sigma Pi and began expanding throughout the U.S.\n\nBecame an international fraternity\n\nThere are over 130 Chapters and Colonies with over 90,000 Brothers\n\n“...in the Service of God and Man...”\n\nACE Project\n\nThe ACE Project is designed for Sigma Pi Chapters to give directly back to their universities. Sigma Pi is the only Greek organization with a service project of this kind.\n\nPast ACE Projects include manning the K-State PROUD booth in its first year, helping to raise over $60,000 for need-based student scholarships, and cleaning K-State's Challenge Course after a winter ice storm. In 2008 and 2009, we cleaned Aggieville following the Homecoming Parade.\n\nDonate Life Challenge\n\nIn May of 2009, one our brothers -- Cameron Chana of Eastern Illinois University, was tragically killed in a bus accident. Though Cameron's life ended, his story continues through the awesome gift of organ, eye and tissue donation. Today, six people are alive because of his decision to give life and hope to others. In honor of Cameron, Sigma Pi has partnered with Donate Life America to encourage all Sigma Pi members to REGISTER or REAFFIRM their decision to save lives through organ and tissue donation and to encourage all people they come in contact with to do the same. You can make a tremendous difference in the life of all of the men, women and children awaiting organ transplants and the hundreds of thousands more in need of tissue and cornea transplants.\n\nFor more information, visit the Donate Life Challenge's website.\n\nSean Vernon Amazing Day Foundation\n\nIt is our mission to not only serve as a memorial, but also a communal service that educates and prevents the loss of life to such a tragic cause. Suicide is a problem that our society fails to recognize as a legitimate risk, but it is a cause that deserves more attention than society is willing to give it. With your help, we can make a difference! We are a newly founded (2009) established non-profit that will serve to fund the research, create awareness and prevention of suicide amongst young adults. Dedicated to reducing suicide among our college students. Every year 1,100 students die at their own hands, we want to make it zero!\n\nFor more information, visit the Sean Vernon Amazing Day Foundation's website.\n\n“...to develop Character...”\n\nSigma Pi has consistently been in the top 10 of all K-State fraternities in intramurals, placing 8th in total points each of the last two years.\n\nSince our chartering in 2007, Sigma Pi teams have made the playoffs in all major sports (basketball, flag football, soccer, softball, volleyball) every year. Only the top half of teams advances to the playoffs in each sport."
