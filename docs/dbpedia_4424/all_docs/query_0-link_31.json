        "text": "We are excited to spotlight Brian Lowery from Bright Fellowship’s 3rd cohort! Brian of central Ohio has a breadth of knowledge and experience in teaching, career development and guidance, as well as leadership as an athletic director, which have all influenced his decision to pursue a career in K-12 administration. Through Bright, Brian is eager to continue honing his leadership skills and learning ways to empower youth to become leaders in their own communities. Read on to hear about Brian’s own journey into leadership and some of the challenges he has faced. Q. Discuss a mentor or influential teacher who has had a significant impact on your educational and leadership journey. How have they influenced your growth and development as a potential educational leader? A. Doug Jones a former AD in CCS and current AD in SWCS. He showed me organization and purpose to the things I did, and still do to this day. I will be forever indebted to him for the knowledge he gives me. When I was a teenager, Roy Garris became a father figure to me and helped me grow as a young man. He taught me personal responsibility and how to become a leader at a young age. He also put me in positions of responsibility and how to be a selfless human being in this world. Q. Reflect on your growth and evolution as a student from your early academic years to now. How has your perception of leadership and education changed, and how does this influence your aspirations in the field of education? A. My growth was a realization of what was done for me as a youth. People that gave attention to the little details about me showed me that success was possible. I see and believe that more now. I loved the push and reassurances I received. I didn’t have much and struggled as a teenager, but those people who helped me made me realize that I was destined to help youth who had issues mentally and academically and just don’t know how to create a path for a better life. That has become my purpose. Q: Reflect on a challenging interaction or conflict you encountered during your K-12 principal internship. How did you manage it, and what strategies did you employ to maintain a positive and productive environment? A. Not necessarily a challenging interaction, but a situation. The other assistant principal was out for an extended period of time, so I had to learn and manage situations quicker in my building. I made sure to get help if I needed it and communicate openly and effectively. I also made sure that if I was struggling, to open my mouth and get the help I needed to be an effective leader. I am working at a place where the door is always open for dialogue and they are EXTREMELY supportive to my needs as a budding administrator.

However, enrollment at top MBA programs, which are gateways to access mid- and senior-level opportunities, has stagnated over the past decade. In 2021, Bloomberg reported that Black students made up less than 10% of annual enrollment on average nationally. Admissions experts attribute this to the lack of formal corporate mentorship, the high monetary and opportunity costs to enter an MBA program, and the lack of leadership diversity in the college experience. Because of these obstacles, the availability of MBA resources and programs to recruit and develop Black prospective students becomes even more important. Several notable pre- and post-MBA programs have proven to offset the aforementioned trend in statistics and will provide a great launching pad for your professional career. 🔸Management Leadership for Tomorrow Management Leadership for Tomorrow (MLT) fosters a community to increase the representation of Black and other minority students in corporate America after their undergraduate and MBA studies. 🔸The Consortium for Graduate Study in Management The Consortium is an organization that provides African Americans, Hispanic Americans, and Native Americans the opportunity to apply to top MBA programs in its business school affiliate network, which now consists of 23 MBA programs following the recent additions of the Stanford Graduate School of Business in 2022 and Northwestern’s Kellogg School of Management in 2023. 🔸Toigo Foundation The Robert Toigo Foundation awards its prestigious fellowship to a select number of minority MBA students pursuing in a career in the financial services, private equity, and investment management sectors. Those who are interested must apply to the program in the spring before matriculating to business school. 🔸National Black MBA Association The National Black MBA Association (NBMBAA) provides an extensive network that allows Black MBA students and alumni to build symbiotic personal and professional relationships. 🔸JumpStart Advisory Group The JumpStart Advisory Group hosts pre-matriculation career prep forums for minority candidates. The events target students interested in management consulting, finance, and brand management careers. Attendees can participate in professional development workshops, case studies, networking events with employers, and resume development sessions.

I shared some hard-earned advice from my journey, focusing on 3 key points for thriving as an international student: 1. Kick Out Limitations: \"Everything is possible!\" Don’t let anyone tell you otherwise. While not always easy, it's definitely achievable. Ignoring the naysayers truly paid off, proving that you can excel far beyond expectations. Drawing from my own journey, I discussed how I navigated challenges and excelled in all areas – you can too. 2. Be Memorable: You don't have to be the loudest in the room to make an impact. Kindness, helpfulness, and support are powerful ways to leave a lasting impression. Stepping out from the shadows, shedding any timidity or imposter syndrome, is vital. Don't just exist – live your experience and share your awesomeness! 3. Get Out of Yourself: Networking is key. Believe it or not, I'm an introvert! But that doesn't stop me from connecting with classmates, professors, and anyone who can offer value or support. My secret for networking? Focus on the other person. Show genuine interest and concern – it opens doors you never knew existed. (Stay tuned for future posts where I'll share specific networking tips!) Reflecting on this recurring opportunity (as I have always been invited to speak to new students every semester) to engage with each new class, I'm filled with gratitude. My goal has always been to ignite a spark in at least one international student and show them that possibilities are endless! As one of the panelists, Jonas Obiajunwa, shared, how my past visit to his class and journey inspired him to \"be and do more\" – that's what it's all about! Finally, Creating your own path and telling your unique story is important in a world full of preconceived notions and shared experiences. Remember, you are not an extension of others—you are your own unique creation. Create your journey and ENJOY IT! P.S. A big thank you to Prof. Tracey Kadish for the invitation, and for letting me know this leadership course is based on the pilot program I worked on. Shoutout to the other panelists Jonas Obiajunwa, Bhanu Shree, Gabriela Sanchez and Mary D'Souza. Here's to a memorable experience for all the new students embarking on their educational journeys in a new country! #PreciousAigbe #InternationalStudents #MohawkCollege #NewImmigrant\n\nOnly 100 days left until my graduation!! or, as some would call it, the commencement ceremony! As an international student, I've learned the virtues of patience and the importance of enjoying the journey, not just the outcome. As I approach this milestone, I find myself reflecting on the invaluable lessons, challenges overcome, and milestones achieved during my time in school. One of the highlights was a group project for Procter & Gamble, where we tackled real-world problems with innovative solutions. This experience, especially the advice from the founder of Waze, Uri Levine during the Babson Acceleration Club Pitch competition, taught me the value of loving the problem, not the solution. With the commencement ceremony on the horizon, my 100-day plan is more than a countdown; it's a roadmap for skill enrichment, network expansion, and career goal refinement. I've had the privilege of meeting an array of inspiring individuals, from scientists to entrepreneurs, across Boston's diverse collegiate landscape. If you're in the Boston area or a fellow student I haven't met yet, let's connect over coffee. I'm eager to learn from you! As I lay the groundwork for my professional journey post-graduation, I'm committed to making the most of these next 100 days. Your insights and advice would be invaluable. How did you navigate your final days before graduation, or what are your plans before graduation? Let's connect and share our experiences! #commencement #graduation #graduation2024 #babsoncollege #networking #waze #urilevin #boston\n\nI was invited to Wilbur O. and Ann Powers College of Business at Clemson University this week to speak in a series of panels. I was with five other alumni Jonathan Ridgway Kevin Lamberson Alice Crowder Danny Ortiz Bill Durrell of various business tracks and leadership levels. The students in BUS1010, which introduces freshmen to college, orientates them with the Business School and prepares them to pick their majors, had to prepare questions for us for their final exam. They inquired about our careers, entrepreneurship, resume building, internships, career progressions, salary negotiation, our time in college, and what we wished we had done differently. Here are the nuggets of wisdom shared collectively by the panel that seemed to crop up in every class: Constantly build your network. Be curious. Culture is super important. Take risks. It’s OK to pivot. Initiative & preparation will take you far. Be purposefully dynamic. Communication is key. Verbal AND written. Read. Know about the world today. Special “kudos” go out to the students who stood up to ask the questions and who took the initiative to speak to the panelists one-on-one. It takes guts and shows leadership because it is hard - especially amongst your peers. I capped the evening at a Graduation/Networking Event for the Clemson University Leadership Signature Program. LSP provides a live learning environment for students, via a fully functional corporation run by students complete with projects, committees, budgets, and an organizational hierarchy with promotions. Special thank you to Bill Tumblin for inviting us into your classrooms and Keith Balts for hosting us at the LSP event. Based on what I saw, the future for Business - whatever path these students take - is bright. The students are also super fun and full of life (photo evidence below). #business #clemsonuniversity #curiosity #preparation #leadership\n\nI was just catching up with my friend Sarah the other day, and we were talking about colleges. Now, Sarah's one of those super ambitious people (you know, the kind who gets excited about planning the future!). She's passionate about sports and wants to maybe even start her own business someday, but she also wants to experience different cultures through exchange programs and corporate exposure. The conversation got us thinking - are there colleges that offer this kind of crazy mix? I found a hidden gem that might be the perfect fit for Sarah (and maybe even you!): Lovely Professional University (LPU). Here's why LPU sounds like it could be the ultimate dream school for someone like Sarah: Why LPU is Your Gamechanger: ● No More Textbook Snoozefest: Forget dusty books! LPU's curriculum is fresh, exciting, and designed with real-world businesses in mind. You'll learn what industry leaders do, not some outdated theory. ● Professors who are real Business Rockstars: Teachers aren't just professors, they're war veterans of the business world! They'll share their insights, epic stories, and the secrets to conquering any industry. But LPU is more than just classes. It's about ACTION! ● Get Your Hands Dirty (in a Good Way): Dive into internships, and projects with real companies, and even have CEOs guest lecture! And here's the coolest part: LPU is your one-stop shop for success. ● A Buffet of Programs: They have a ton of amazing programs, from cutting-edge specializations to classic business basics. Find the perfect fit for your ambitions, no matter how big they are. ● Level Up Your Skills: Sharpen your knowledge in awesome classrooms, then let you loose in our high-tech labs and mock boardrooms to truly become a business ninja. ● The Networking Force: Connect with industry leaders, future business titans, and successful alumni who will be your biggest cheerleaders. LPU isn't just a university, it's a vibrant community. Imagine a place with everything you need to thrive - top-notch facilities, a diverse group of friends, and all the resources to help you become unstoppable. #LPU #university #networking #mba #skills #community\n\nI can’t believe it’s been nearly a year since I first walked into London Business School, proudly collecting my badge and name tag, and glowing with excitement as I video-called home to share the moment. It’s been a roller coaster of a year since then, and I’m thrilled to share that I recently graduated from London Business School with a Master’s in Management. Reflecting on this incredible journey, I am amazed at how far I have come. From confidently approaching someone and pitching my story to discussing a wide range of topics based on practical, real-life knowledge gained from case studies, #LBS has changed me significantly for the better. Walking down the stage to shake hands with the dean, with my family and friends cheering me on, I felt profoundly grateful to LBS for the learnings and opportunities it has given me. These experiences have broadened my mind and fueled my #ambition for \"Success squared.\" A big thank you to my family, friends, classmates, professors, coaches, mentors, and alums. It would be too long a list to name here, and I wouldn't want them getting disturbed by the LinkedIn notifications, so I will refrain from that. But a heartfelt thank you to all—know that I couldn't have made it without your support and help throughout this journey. I want to share my raw and authentic #experiences at LBS, as I had promised in my 30-day post series last year. From late nights spent wrapping up assignments to rushing from company presentations to class, it’s truly been a wild ride. In a series of posts, I’ll be focusing on aspects that caught me and my classmates off guard when we first arrived, from the importance of cover letters to how to leverage #networking. I’m also open to requests, so please let me know if there’s anything specific you’d like to hear about—whether it’s the study-abroad experience, life at LBS, or anything else. Looking forward to sharing my experiences and some exciting #updates, and hearing your thoughts! #mastersinmanagement #BusinessSchool #journey #graduation\n\nMore tips on how to build relationships with professors and standout from other students 💡💡 5. Express Gratitude Gratitude gives room for more in life. A simple \"thank you\" can go a long way. After class, take a moment to express your appreciation for the knowledge shared. lecturers are more willing putting the extra effort and time to make sure you understand the material as a result of gratitude, gratitude signals to your professors that you value their efforts. 6. Acknowledge Their Humanity: Remember that professors are human too. Inquire about their well-being, ask how their weekends were, or engage in casual conversations about shared experiences like the weather. This personal touch helps you stand out and makes the learning environment more enjoyable for everyone. Fikayo Aderoju CSM, CSPO taught me this for networking events , It applicable to professors as well. 7. Ask Questions During and after Class!! Asking questions consistently singles you out; it makes it easier for the professor to recall your name. It also shows the professor your dedication, and willingness to learn and excel in the course. It could be intimidating to ask questions in class. I used to be very shy starting university. Here is how I overcame being shy about asking questions in class: First I realized I'm literally paying the lecturer to teach me, regardless of whether I ask a question or not. I don't pay more for asking questions. I figured I might as well use my tuition well, and ask questions,overtime I got confident and comfortable asking questions, as my lecturers are being paid to answer questions, Dr. Oghenowede Eyawo taught me this during a Black Student Mentorship Program(BSMP) session at York University Secondly, I changed my seating position. Over time, I realised that sitting at the very front of the class,makes it easier to ask a question, you get to only see the lecturer in front of you , This is less intimidating, as you focus more on the lecturer than the other students. Tip 6 plays an important role here , overtime if you consistently build a relationship with your lecturer, it becomes easier to ask questions going forward in class. Also, I ask simple questions after class just to confirm what I learned. For example, if I learned 1 + 1 = 2, I'd go to the professor and ask, 'If 1 + 1 = 2, how and why?' Confirming this shows your dedication to understanding the material to the professor, and it reinforces your understanding, you might be wondering why ask something you already know , trust me it singles you out, this way you get to wait in line to ask the professors question and connect with your peers as well , you kill two birds with one stone. I’ll be providing valuable tips on how to build relationships with your fellow students in the next Back-to-School series post😉 Thank you for reading,stay tuned 😊💡 Your very own Trailblazer ⭐️ God is good"
