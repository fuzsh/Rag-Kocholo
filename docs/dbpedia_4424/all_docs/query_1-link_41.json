As the nation’s first co-ed business fraternity, it has grown to almost 350 collegiate chapters with more than 275,000 initiated members.\n\n“My favorite part of being a Brother of Delta Sigma Pi is the community. Delta Sigma Pi has given me memories and friendships that will last a lifetime, as well as a network that can take me anywhere,” says Hobbs.\n\nGetting to Know Delta Sigma Pi\n\nWhat is the vision of Delta Sigma Pi?\n\nDelta Sigma Pi is a Professional Fraternity organized to foster the study of business in universities.
