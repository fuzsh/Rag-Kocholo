        "text": "The short of it is that Phi Sigma Pi is a national coed honors fraternity. Our tripod is Scholarship, Leadership (through service), and Fellowship. We have weekly meetings and many events for you to participate in, and we currently have about 40 active brothers.\n\nThe long of it, well, that's not easy to explain. We are Brothers (yes, even the women are called Brothers) and that means we are friends. We enjoy traveling to the humane society to lend a helping hand, and we enjoy getting together help the elderly play their weekly bingo. We have great times watching movies, playing Euchre, skydiving, camping, taking spring break trips to the Smokey Mountains, and traveling to Mardis Gras to meet up with other chapters. But that's not all. We promote scholarship. We plan publicity stunts and various fundraising activities. We are guaranteed to make new friends every semester as we bring in new initiates. About all I can really say is that regardless of what you've done in the past, you will find exciting new opportunities, as well as a diverse group of friends, in Phi Sigma Pi."
