        "text": "By Elleyna Rudman\n\nOn March 24, 1923, Royal Bauer, a professor at the University of Missouri, established the Alpha Beta Chapter of Delta Sigma Pi. This chapter of the coeducational professional business fraternity began with about a dozen students. A century later, the Alpha Beta Chapter of Delta Sigma Pi continues to thrive with 141 current members.\n\nWith a focus on professional development, Delta Sigma Pi ensures students are set up for success with opportunities to attend networking events and resume-writing sessions and to gain valuable career insight from professional speakers. Additionally, the chapter actively participates in various community service events, including litter clean-up and food and clothing drives, and supports charitable organizations such as Tiger Pantry and Ronald McDonald House. The fraternity’s commitment to student success and community engagement helps equip its members with the skills needed to succeed in their careers and prepares them to be compassionate and empathetic citizens.\n\nJoe Jamiolkowski, the chapter’s president, has firsthand experience of how impactful Delta Sigma Pi can be. \"Delta Sigma Pi has been the best choice I have ever made,” he said. “It has shaped my leadership skills and has helped me grow professionally. On top of that, I have made lifelong friendships.\"\n\nIn celebration of the chapter’s 100th anniversary last year, alumni were invited to Cornell Hall, the home of the Trulaske College of Business, to view a display case dedicated to Delta Sigma Pi. Chapter members then gathered at Logboat Brewing Company in Columbia to toast the special occasion. The festivities ended with a tailgate before the Tigers took on Kansas State at Faurot Field.\n\nAs the chapter concludes a century of service, it continues to build on its story. On Oct. 29, 2023, the fraternity initiated 39 new members. Chapter members plan to engage in more community service activities and can be found at Memorial Stadium during home football games, fundraising to support the greater Columbia community. Furthermore, the chapter sent six members to the LEAD School in Denver in early November 2023. This academy holds workshops in networking and leadership development to provide students with the vital skills they will need to fill executive positions at Delta Sigma Pi.\n\nAlpha Beta Chapter’s anniversary is a testament to its dedicated students and alumni who look forward to a bright future ahead.\n\nFun Facts"
