The visionary founders, known as the “Jewels” of the fraternity, are Henry Arthur Callis, Charles Henry Chapman, Eugene Kinckle Jones, George Biddle Kelley, Nathaniel Allison Murray, Robert Harold Ogle, and Vertner Woodson Tandy.\n\nThe Fraternity initially served as a study and support group for minority students who faced racial prejudice, both educationally and socially, at Cornell. The Jewel founders and early leaders of the Fraternity succeeded in laying a firm foundation for Alpha Phi Alpha's principles of scholarship, fellowship, good character, and the uplifting of humanity.\n\nAlpha Phi Alpha chapters were established at other colleges and universities, many of them historically black institutions, soon after the founding at Cornell. While continuing to stress academic excellence among its members, Alpha also recognized the need to help correct the educational, economic, political, and social injustices faced by African Americans. Alpha Phi Alpha has long stood at the forefront of the African-American community's fight for civil rights through leaders such as W.E.B. DuBois, Adam Clayton Powell, Jr., Edward Brooke, Martin Luther King, Jr., Thurgood Marshall, Andrew Young, William Gray, Paul Robeson, and many others. At Fisk--DuBois has a statue on the campus, and the library is named after John Hope Franklin.\n\nSince its founding on December 4, 1906, Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity, Inc. has supplied voice and vision to the struggle of African-Americans and people of color around the world.\n\nContacts\n\nKappa Alpha Psi Fraternity, Inc.\n\nMotto: Achievement in every field of human endeavor\n\nNational Founding Date: January 5, 1911\n\nNational Website: kappaalphapsi1911.com\n\nChapter Name: Alpha Delta\n\nChapter Founding Date: December 3, 1927\n\nAdvisor: Greg Manogin\n\nWatch FA 17 Probate Recap\n\nAbout\n\nKappa Alpha Psi, a college Fraternity, now comprised of functioning Undergraduate and Alumni Chapters on major campuses and in cities throughout the country, is the crystallization of a dream. It is the beautiful realization of a vision shared commonly by the late Revered Founders Elder Watson Diggs; John Milton Lee; Byron K. Armstrong; Guy Levis Grant; Ezra D. Alexander; Henry T. Asher; Marcus P. Blakemore; Paul W. Caine; Edward G. Irvin and George W. Edmonds.\n\nIt was the vision of these astute men that enabled them in the school year 1910 - 11, more specifically the night of January 5, 1911, on the campus of Indiana University at Bloomington, Indiana, to sow the seed of a fraternal tree whose fruit is available to, and now enjoyed by, college men everywhere, regardless of their color, religion or national origin. It is a fact of which KAPPA ALPHA PSI is justly proud that the Constitution has never contained any clause which either excluded or suggested the exclusion of a man from membership merely because of his color, creed, or national origin. The Constitution of KAPPA ALPHA PSI is predicated upon, and dedicated to, the principles of achievement through a truly democratic Fraternity.\n\nChartered and incorporated originally under the laws of the State of Indiana as Kappa Alpha Nu on May 15, 1911, the name was changed to KAPPA ALPHA PSI on a resolution offered and adopted at the Grand Chapter in December 1914. This change became effective April 15, 1915, on a proclamation by the then Grand Polemarch, Elder Watson Diggs. Thus, the name acquired a distinctive Greek letter symbol and KAPPA ALPHA PSI thereby became a Greek letter Fraternity in every sense of the designation.\n\nNotable Members\n\nColin Kaepernick (NFL), Cedric The Entertainer, Wilt Chamberlain (NBA), Congressman Alcee Hastings (Initiate of The Alpha Delta Chapter), Bill Russell (NBA), Arthur Ashe (Tennis), Earl Thomas (NFL), DeMarco Morgan (CBS News Anchor), Marvin Sapp (Gospel Artist), Robert L. Johnson (Founder of BET, First Black Billionaire)\n\nPhi Beta Sigma Fraternity, Inc.\n\nFounding Date: October 10, 1927\n\nNational Website: pbs1914.org\n\nChapter Name: Alpha Gamma\n\nAdvisors: Mr. Allen Thurman, Dr. Emmanuel Rowe\n\nABOUT:\n\nPhi Beta Sigma Fraternity was founded at Howard University in Washington, D.C., January 9, 1914, by three young African-American male students. The Founders, Honorable A. Langston Taylor, Honorable Leonard F. Morse, and Honorable Charles I. Brown, wanted to organize a Greek letter fraternity that would truly exemplify the ideals of brotherhood, scholarship, and service.\n\nThe Founders deeply wished to create an organization that viewed itself as “a part of” the general community rather than “apart from” the general community. They believed that each potential member should be judged by his own merits, rather than his family background or affluence…without regard to race, nationality, skin tone, or texture of hair. They desired for their fraternity to exist as part of an even greater brotherhood which would be devoted to the “inclusive we” rather than the “exclusive we”.\n\nMISSION Statement:\n\n“Culture For Service and Service For Humanity”\n\nZeta Phi Beta Sorority, Inc.\n\nFounding Date: January 16, 1920\n\nNational Website: zphib1920.org\n\nChapter Name: Kappa Gamma\n\nChapter Founded: November 1966\n\nAdvisor: Mrs. Earnestine Wilson\n\nView a Chapter Step Show\n\n\"The 6 Melodic ForceZ in the Key of Z\"\n\nAbout\n\nZeta Phi Beta Sorority Incorporated was founded January 16th, 1920 on the campus of Howard University. The five founders, Arizona Cleaver Stemons, Pearl Anna Neal, Myrtle Tyler Faithful, Viola Tyler Goings and Fannie Pettie Watts, were encouraged by the brothers of Phi Beta Sigma Fraternity Incorporated. to form the organization as sister sorority to the fraternity. Zeta Phi Beta and Phi Beta Sigma are the first and only constitutionally bound organizations.\n\nZeta Phi Beta was founded on the principles of Sisterly Love, Scholarship, Service and Finer Womanhood. The Sorority prides itself on being a community conscious, action oriented organizations and has many programs devoted to service and many partnerships with organizations committed to service. Zeta Phi Beta was not the first historically black sorority, but it is the Sorority of many firsts. These first include, the first to charter a chapter in Africa, the first to establish a national headquarters and the first to create auxiliaries.\n\nThe Mighty Kaptivating Kappa Gamma Chapter was chartered in November of 1966. Since then, we have been committed to service on campus and in the Nashville community and we have provided the students at Fisk University with impacting and informative events. Zeta Phi Beta Sorority will continue to thrive at Fisk University through the Kappa Gamma Chapter for many years to come."
