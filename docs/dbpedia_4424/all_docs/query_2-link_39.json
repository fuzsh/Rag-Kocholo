        "text": "After holding the volunteer role of Chapter Director for 7 years, Brother Rob Pankau III handed over that position in November 2023 to Brother Tyler Reynolds.\n\nJoining the Zeta Pi Chapter as part of the Beta Omicron pledge class in 2017, Tyler studied human resources development at OU, and had held 3 E-Board terms during his Active years with the Chapter.\n\n“Sigma Pi has, and always will mean a lot to me,” he said. “I was at the house after the first day of classes at Oakland and immediately saw something I wanted to be a part of. And the rest is history.”\n\nTyler becomes the 12th person to serve in that position since our Chapter’s founding in 1986.\n\nRecently, the undergraduate chapter also voted to change the name of the role from Chapter Director to Chapter Advisor.\n\nIn thinking about taking over and continuing the work that Brother Pankau had given during his time as Chapter Advisor, Tyler quotes the Sigma Pi Fireside Song: “The circle changes with each year, brothers come and disappear.”\n\n“I’m fully confident in the Active Chapter, and I, along with everyone else who is behind them, will do what we can to ensure their success. I’m looking forward to helping grow on the foundation Zeta Pi has stood on for nearly 38 years, setting us up for many, many more to come.”\n\nNavigating a pandemic, changing times for Greeks\n\nRob had become Chapter Director in July 2017, following Bob Van Acker’s four-years in that role.\n\nHe reflected on his time, particularly as it required negotiation a challenging relationship with the OU administration and then as the COVID-19 pandemic changed everything.\n\nHe notes that the Chapter was divided at the time he started, uncertain about the path forward.\n\n“I am particularly proud of how the chapter functioned and survived through the pandemic. Honestly, I could not have asked for a better outcome with operations essentially shut down for a year plus,” he shared. “The pandemic proved fruitful in a way that I couldn’t have imagined, with a refocusing on academics and the values of the organization as the social aspect was significantly diminished during this time. This has set the tone in the last few years of recruitment.”\n\nRob says the Chapter is in a place now that needs a different type of mentorship and guidance, someone who is more plugged into the current needs of students as well as how the every day life operates for a student.\n\nAdding to that, Rob notes that the U.S. university system and its relationship with Greek organizations has changed dramatically in the past 10 years. That’s made his role, and the Chapter’s place at OU, more challenging to navigate.\n\n“Greeks are often not welcome or are scrutinized in a manner that is inconsistent compared to other student organizations,” he said. “Oakland University has done away with a specific Greek Advisor at this point in time, which has led to an interesting dichotomy between the Chapter and the university. We are at the point that there is limited oversight by the university, but also limited and challenging to acquire support as well.”\n\nNow, Tyler is the 12th to serve in that position since our Chapter’s founding in 1986:\n\nVince Chrisman (Founding Chapter Director in March 15, 1986)\n\nJohn Pearson\n\nBryan Mahlmiester\n\nJohn Zielke (until Feb 95)\n\nJeff Fox (Feb 95-June 96)\n\nChuck Surinck (June 96-Jan 09)\n\nPete Knoll (early 09)\n\nBrett Westen (Early 09-Fall 09)\n\nRob Pankau III (Fall 09 – Nov 10)\n\nMike Long (Nov 10 – April 13)\n\nBob Van Acker (April 13 – July 17)\n\nRob Pankau III (July 17 – Nov 23 )\n\nWith the reestablishment of the ZPAA in 2023, now-former Chapter Director Pankau says that our Zeta Pi Chapter has more of a chance to succeed than ever before.\n\n“The creation and sustaining of the Alumni Association will be a key to long term success for our Chapter,” he said. “With the Alumni Association, this gives the chapter another level of stability from a team of individuals, as long as we as Alumni remember that the undergraduates need us as mentors more than ever. Temper expectations and teach, while reminding ourselves of that the current challenges are different, we were all 19 and trying to figure it out at one point in time.”\n\nScrolling through some Facebook memories recently, Brother Mike Hoskins came across this post from 2009 following the wedding of Mario Macandog and Anna Marie Barnes. Here it is, as written by Brother Hoskins and posted online so many years ago.\n\nThe essence of purity. It’s something we measure by a child’s innocence. That natural beauty of a state’s inland lakes or magical Fall colors. Or even the pure fun of friends reuniting for a September wedding.\n\nSo was the case on Sept. 19. Pure Michigan magic transcended time and formed again on the campus of Oakland University. When two people — Mario and Anna Marie — joined together in the company of close friends and family to celebrate their everything.\n\nTogether, the couple lit up the church and campus just as they’ve always done: rich in flavor and fun, unique in ritual and tradition. They made it their own, simply making it as natural as Games on the Grass. We all hung up our regular lives, locked up, and headed off to do something we truly love. A sign that we’re spending time with those who mean so much and truly deserve it, stepping into the playground of pure happiness.\n\nThere was dancing. The movement to the music and changing states of soberness mirrored the dancing trees in a brisk Fall wind, just as the changing hues of the evolving seasons evolve on the dancefloor of Michigan’s landscape. That nature of trees reminds us that there are bigger things in life than just us, but our roots run deep and we can grow together in a Land of Golden Grizzlies and Pioneers.\n\nLike the golden sunrises appearing over Lake St. Clair each morning, a rainbow of colors could be found in the spray paint provided by a man once known as Meat. A band of Brothers journeyed to a familiar spot where Pup + Friends painted the sacred rock once more.\n\nJust like the old days of Sigma Pi, when young and old were just that — young, and not so old. We avoided the controversial coastline of Beer Lake, leaving those memories in the past so only to bring a headshake and chuckle rather than a new emergency room visit.\n\nWe laughed and loved in a place upstairs, not far from where we all first met and learned who we were. And who we might become. A campus hub, an Oakland Center that centered our lives.\n\nNow redone, there’s no more office or ping pong tables or Knights of the L downstairs. So much of what we knew back then has moved on, even though 100 years has not passed in our heart and minds.\n\nStill, the OC continues to capture our attention and once again it gave way to a memorable evening where we could find a new center for a new age. All in the spirit of celebrating Mario and Anna Marie.\n\nBut nothing gold can stay, and just as the Fall season fades too quickly and the leaves fall from the trees, the night came to an abrupt end as the Bar of Mysterious Mixtures was replaced with a water jug. And oh, the potential of water.\n\nWe found ourselves and made due, capitalizing on the energy from a state staying afloat in turbulent economic waters. We wished for Fridays and managed to find refuge there, even when the rest of the night and week had come to a close. We continued on and shared in a night of Macondog Magic, in the company of friends. Of family. Of Brothers.\n\nCollectively, we all showed our Progress, and its distinctive mark in each of our lives. We Believed once more. And we always will. That is the power of Pure Michigan, Macandog-style. It’s the power of Sigma Pi Brotherhood.\n\nYour trip begins here. And ours continues.\n\n#PureSigmaPi\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic presented a situation none of us in modern times had experienced before, including everyone connected to the college fraternity experience. Our Zeta Pi Chapter of Sigma Pi at Oakland University was no exception.\n\nWhile quarantines and health mandates presented unforeseen challenges and changed the very nature of the fraternity experience for over a year, the pandemic period also gave Sigma Pi chapter an opportunity to shine, strengthen brotherly bonds and find new ways to navigate these pandemic speed bumps.\n\nOne notable moment in history for our Chapter is that, despite the pandemic woes, we moved into a new fraternity house in June 2021. That new location is on Franklin Boulevard in Pontiac.\n\n“A big takeaway for me is that even in the worst of circumstances, there is always better coming your way,” said Brother Tyler Reynolds, who served as Sage from April 2021 to April 2022. “The biggest lesson I personally learned during the pandemic was that no matter what, we’ve always got that connection as brothers.”\n\nAlthough Brotherhood and relationships declined during the beginning of COVID-19 with restrictions, they were able to shift to reopening and growing stronger in late 2020 and 2021 as everything began returning to some type of normalcy.\n\n“Brotherhood and the relationships had declined in the beginning,” Brother Reynolds said. “However, as things opened up more the thing we all wanted to focus on as a chapter was bringing the brotherhood back strong as ever. It really showed in our commitments to the weekly brotherhoods we hosted as soon as we could and moving towards planning a ‘normal’ academic year.”\n\nSince the Summer months are typically off-times for those attending OU, our Chapter doesn’t really have a summer rush; instead, any potential brothers who are met and recruited during that time are funneled into the upcoming Fall rush cycle. Due to COVID-19’s beginnings in March 2020, that late spring initiation was pospoted until everything began opening up that summer.\n\nThat led to losing half of the pledge class because of the wait, some due to pledges transferring to other schools prior to being initiated, according to Brother Reynolds.\n\n“This was disheartening but was certainly the least of our worries given the pandemic,” he said.\n\nWhen the Fall 2020 academic year began, it was a surreal moment as most colleges were still in a virtual learning mode due to the pandemic. Some schools eventually started later with hybrid models and pandemic restrictions in place.\n\nAs a result, the Zeta Pi Chapter found it more difficult to recruit a typically larger Fall pledge class. While our Chapter always strives toward “quality over quantity,” that was even more true during that semester.\n\n“It proved challenging as we moved back to truly in-person rushing, which led to the chapter having a recruitment workshop,” Brother Reynolds said, noting that Brother Christian Younger led that workshop and has served as the chapter’s Recruitment Director for the past 2.5 years leading into and during COVID-19.\n\nVirtual chapter meetings made it much harder to get things done, Reynolds said: from lack of cameras being turned on, to people just flat out not paying attention. He also said when everything closed and Michigan’s stay-at-home order was in place, the Brother’s phones were the only way to stay in contact with each other safely.\n\n“It was difficult to keep the brothers informed and planning things,” he said. “I was able to personally overcome this through the Discord channel we created and just repeating information over and over again there.”\n\nWhen in-person events became more possible, our Chapter held meetups and events at parks, beaches, and outdoor areas where it was in line with CDC guidelines at the time. Most of the time during the pandemic, OU had strict policies regarding chapter meetings and meetups, so hosting those events inside is what Brother Reynolds says proved the hardest for the brothers to plan for everyone.\n\nEven looking at our Zeta Pi Chapter’s signature Pig Roast event in the first week of the Fall semester each year, you can see the work and grit that the Active members put into putting on a successful event. The Sept. 2020 event took place at the fraternity house at the time in Rochester, with a smaller intimate setting outside; while the Sept. 2021 event was held in its traditional location on campus, in between the Oakland Center and Bear (aka Beer) Lake. Even with pandemic restrictions and limitations in play, the Chapter welcomed people to the event — a small slice of “normalcy” in uncertain and surreal times.\n\nThroughout it all, Brother Reynolds said enduring these pandemic challenges made our local Chapter stronger.\n\nWhen the pandemic began, our Chapter had a floating number of nearly three dozen members. They feared it might drop if Brothers left OU and they hadn’t recruited and initiated new Brothers because of the pandemic. But that didn’t happen. As it turned out, the Chapter’s membership in Spring 2022 sat at 35 Active plus 4 pledges soon to be initiated as part of the Beta Omega pledge class — nearly unchanged from the start of COVID-19.\n\n“I took over and had campus reopening, in person events coming and only half of a chapter that had been to an on campus event, so leading them into this year was a challenge but we had a very successful year,” Brother Reynolds said. “We survived a pandemic. Our numbers hardly dropped. That is something not a lot of fraternities, Greek organizations, businesses and even universities can say. We stayed together and persevered through the tough times and are finally seeing it pay off with improved relations with other Greek organizations, a new house, and growth in the Chapter, and that is something we all can be proud of.”\n\nWith a half dozen men graduating in Spring 2022 and many of them having E-board and leadership roles, Brother Reynolds noted that our Chapter remains strong in numbers and quality.\n\n“Our chapter will be very young, with roughly half the chapter being first or second-year members, something I have not seen in my time in the chapter,” he said. “Today, we are as tight as ever but still focusing on bringing involvement back up to our high standard. That is something that should be the focus of the chapter going into the next school year and beyond.”\n\nBy Michael W. Hoskins\n\nIn a historic milestone moment for Zeta-Pi at Oakland University, we’ve initiated the first intra-chapter, father-son legacies into our local Sigma Pi bonds of brotherhood.\n\nThe first legacy pair came in November 2019, while the second legacy set followed in late 2021. These men are brothers simultaneously at a moment when our chapter has about 400 men initiated locally, since our Chapter’s founding over three decades ago.\n\nBrothers Waite\n\nOn Nov. 23, 2019, Zeta-Pi welcomed into its ranks the 11-member Beta Tau pledge class, the largest group in several years that brought our Undergraduate roster to more than three dozen men.\n\nOne of those new initiates was Brother Drew Waite, who happens to be the son of Brother Jeff Waite from the Lambda pledge class in Fall 1991 The elder Waite served as Pledge Educator and 2nd Counselor during his undergraduate years and has remained a respected leader and mentor in his years as an alumnus – both for our Chapter, and at the Executive Office level in serving on the Ritual Committee during the last biennium.\n\n“Very surreal,” Jeff said about seeing his son initiated as a brother. “We have shared so many different unique bonds in our life, but this latest one is the deepest and most emotional for me.”\n\nDrew says that brotherly bond that he observed within Sigma Pi was the main reason he joined, despite not convinced for a long time that a fraternity was going to be a fit for him. But after his dad started introducing him to both Alum and Active members, his perspective started changing.\n\n“The connection you grow with your brothers doesn’t stop after you graduate, it really is a life-long bond,” Drew said. “My dad has been talking about Sigma Pi and the benefits of being a brother, ever since I can remember. But seeing first-hand the number of people who have had the same experience as he did, and all the good things they had to say about it, was awesome.”\n\nBoth Waites point to the special father-son relationship they’ve had through the years, including growing up in the same communities and attending the same schools a generation apart. Now, they say Sigma Pi has offered another bond to share.\n\n“Now that I have joined Sigma Pi, that connection has grown even tighter and I’m proud to call him (and everyone else) my brother,” Drew says.\n\nBrothers Tosolt\n\nA second set of legacy men entered our Chapter’s history in early December 2021. Ethan Tosolt joined the Chapter that his father Jeffrey had joined back in 1987, as part of the early Beta pledge class.\n\nThe younger Tosolt joined as part of the 14-member Beta Psi pledge class.\n\nOther Brotherly Bloodlines\n\nWhile these were our first father-son legacies within Zeta-Pi, there have been other bloodlines shared within that fraternal brotherhood before now. Two notable examples stand out:\n\nHakim Men: Past Grand Sage George Hakim (Gamma-Alpha, Detroit-Mercy ’78) welcomed his son Douglas into Zeta-Pi Chapter back in 2009. Doug’s had many different fraternity leadership roles through the years and joined Grand Council in 1994, and he was the sitting Grand Sage at the time of his son’s initiation as part of the Alpha Omega pledge class. He even assisted in the ritual aspect of the ceremony.\n\nFarrug Bros: at the Chapter’s beginnings, Michael was a Charter pledge class member in ’86, while his actual brother Joe transferred from Central Michigan University in the Beta Pledge Class and became the sole brother initiated without a Founding Father originated line.\n\nHudas Men: Brent Hudas joined the Zeta Pi Chapter with the Beta Kappa class in 2014, initiating into the same fraternity that his dad Greg did in 1984 at Wayne State University.\n\nAlam Bros: Most recently, Josh came in with the Beta Omicron pledge class in 2017 before Jacob joined with the Beta Tau pledge class in November 2019.\n\nWe’ve also seen instances where our own Brothers have seen their children find Sigma Pi chapters at other schools, whether those fraternal experiences materialized into life-changing moments and positive experiences or not. It goes to the bigger point: even with a father-and-son story, it’s not always a happy end result when it comes to legacies.\n\nBrother Michael Grant (Tau) emphasizes there are no guarantees. Because chapters can go from a Sage’s Cup to losing their charter very quickly, it becomes even more significant when a can stand the test of time and also welcome descendants from their own Brotherhood lines. He also points out that some fraternity chapters choose to not recruit or initiate legacies as a matter of principle, or that some sons may not have positive experiences like their fathers once had within the fraternity.\n\n“It’s a big deal, and it really is an incredible thing for all the stars to align,” Brother Grant says. “This is a very memorable story – not just tugging on the heart strings of a father and a son, which is very moving, but about our Chapter. Together this shows Zeta-Pi has massive staying power.”\n\nImportantly, it’s always about a Chapter initiating a new member for the right reason. That’s why Brother Drew Waite – while historically significant for us locally – is part of a bigger story. One that includes this Beta Tau pledge class of 11 new brothers: Jacob Alam, Zachary Fennell, Tristan Hoff, Yousif Kiryakoza, Justin Knox, Rob Martin, Tyler Mutz, Marco Pacifico, Adam Reich, Steven Turchi, and Drew Waite.\n\nYou might describe this as an ever-evolving story about the continuation of Zeta-Pi.\n\nChapter Director Rob Pankau III (Alpha Iota, Past Grand Herald) made this observation when snapping a photo of the new brothers following their recent initiation ceremony. While capturing the new initiates posing on an upper balcony with the Sigma Pi banner, he also noted that Brother Frankie Valenti (Beta Nu) is only one in that picture not a part of the newly initiated group of guys.\n\n“I find it very serendipitous that he was the lone active in this photo as he is our single senior that is graduating this semester,” Brother Pankau observed. “This photo is the epitome of the perpetuation of our brotherhood.”\n\nWe are thrilled to have every new Sigma Pi complete their initial journey into the Brotherhood, regardless of where they hail from. We believe, and as always look forward to continuing to embrace the fellowship of kindred minds no matter where our road leads us into the future.\n\nAs a founding father of the Sigma Pi chapter at Oakland University, Brother Jim Lambouris helped pave the way for all the men who would follow.\n\nHe played a pivotal part in shaping our Zeta-Pi Chapter’s foundation in the 1980s, with his commitment to friends, family, community and brotherhood shining through to all who knew him and carrying on throughout his life.\n\nSadly, we said goodbye to Brother Lambouris on Nov. 25, 2020, as he began his journey to the Adytum On High at age 57. He lives on through his daughters and grandchildren, as well as countless other family members, friends, brothers, and online gamers he’s influenced in so many ways.\n\n“Commitment is the word that comes to mind, because when Jim was in, he was all in,” said Brother Rob Waters, a charter pledge class member and close friend of Jim’s starting in those early days of college fraternity life. “It was true for the fraternity, for his daughters, for his family, and for everything in his life.”\n\nFounding a fraternity chapter\n\nOne of 19 original founding fathers of what was initially known as Omega Nu Pi (aka “Oakland’s New Pioneers”), and among the first 28 recognized members of this Sigma Pi colony, Jim became a founding e-board member at the time of the chapter’s chartering on March 15, 1986.\n\nIt all began with a group of guys gathering in 5 Van Waggoner, the original dorm where several founding members lived at the time in 1985. Jim ended up connecting with that group, and it was through those initial connections that he’d bring Brother Waters into that same orbit.\n\nBoth grew up in Waterford and had gone to high school together, though they weren’t friends during those years as Jim was two grade levels ahead. It wasn’t until OU and Sigma Pi, as they became chartering brothers and close friends.\n\n“He was the reason I joined,” Rob said. “And he was the best man at my wedding in 1989. I didn’t know a damn thing about Jim before Sigma Pi, and that’s somewhat remarkable in that we had gone to high school together. Here’s someone who invites me to a fraternity event, and now he’s my only friend that I know in the room. And as it turns out, he’s the person I got to know the best.”\n\nThe two spent a lot of time together during the college years, often engaged in late-night conversations, canoe and ski trips, partying, and car trips to EKU, Eastern Michigan and MSU events.\n\nOther brothers also recall how Jim was well-liked and approachable, and always a center of the social scene. He’s also remembered for how reliable he was for those who mattered in his life, no matter the cost.\n\nBrothers also point out Jim never had a bad word to say, and he’d usually have a grin or smirk on his face — even if he didn’t like something, but would barely let that unhappiness be known.\n\n“Jim was always there when you needed him,” Founding Brother Bryan Mahlmeister said. “Whenever you needed him somewhere or to do something… you could count on him. For those of us starting the fraternity, there was such a drive to make this happen. Everyone worked together and supported each other, and Jim played right into that. We all valued his energy.”\n\nJim attended OU from 1984 to 1988, remaining active with the fraternity during his undergraduate years.\n\nBrother Ross Parpart, who joined in 1988 as part of the Delta pledge class, had a message about Jim’s influence on the chapter — not only on his joining Sigma Pi, but shaping the lives of so many other men.\n\n“Thank you for guiding young men as they embarked on their way to adulthood,” Ross wrote in a Facebook message. “I was one of those young men many years ago. There is no way you could have know how many you helped, guided, and transformed.”\n\nThough some of the guys drifted apart after college, as many brothers do, several note they eventually reconnected as friends and kept in touch — whether it be online fantasy football, casual brotherhood meetups, friends catching up at the Tel-Twelve Mall foodcourt during the workdays, or at Rob’s signature Tiki Nights each July 3 on Wolverine Lake.\n\nPioneer in the online gaming community\n\nLooking back, Rob recalls it wasn’t until years later he’d realize that Jim was actually a “closet introvert.” He was just as happy being in front of a computer as being out in person with a group. That would carry on throughout his life, especially as Jim was an avid gamer and became an influential part of the virtual gaming universe.\n\nBeginning in the early 90s, Jim immersed himself in playing Multi-Users in Middle Earth (MUME), a popular multi-player text-based game based on J.R.R. Tolkien’s ‘Middle Earth’ that has been going since 1991. Out of more than than 700k characters ever created in MUME, Jim’s accolades include the “Ugurz” character that is only 1 of 12 to ever reach the maximum, most-difficult level.\n\nMUME plans to honor Jim by retiring his characters and commemorating him within the game.\n\nA devoted soccer dad\n\nOf course, anyone who knew Jim can attest to the most important part of his life after college: his daughters Jordan, Taylor, and Erin. As a single father, they were his world and many have fond memories watching Jim’s love for them displayed everywhere.\n\n“He was devoted to his daughters,” Brother Waters says, noting that Jordan and Taylor were incredibly involved in soccer through their young lives and Jim was heavily invested as a beloved soccer dad.\n\n“He spent a king’s ransom on traveling soccer for his girls, easily a six figure dollar amount over a six or seven year period. They ran like the wind and both are smart and extremely talented,” Rob said.\n\nThrough everything in life, Rob recalls conversations the two shared demonstrating how deeply Jim was in protecting and caring for his daughters and making sure they had the best lives possible.\n\nTaylor shared this with our Zeta-Pi Chapter, to include in this tribute to her father:\n\n“You were the most invested, loving, and selfless father,” she wrote. “You put so much time and effort into Jordan, Erin, and I. Not only were you a great father, but just a great person, too. You were so kind, patient, and giving to others. You always went out of your way to help people, and never expected anything in return.”\n\nTaylor continued, “You tried your best to be at every dance recital, soccer game, track meet, and was always my #1 supporter. You gave me the best advice about life: to try my best and to go out of my comfort zone. I am so happy that I will be able to cherish those memories forever.”\n\nTrees of brotherhood, family, life\n\nReflecting more on the tree analogy, it’s tough to not sit in awe of Jim’s life: That separate trees can come together at different times and the roots can grow close together and intertwine, no matter how disparate or broken the branches may seem to be growing at different times.\n\nJim had moved to Arizona in recent years, to reconnect with his mom whom he’d had limited contact with since high school. Growing up Greek Orthodox, family was always a big, influential part of his life. Although he had lost touch with his mom when he was younger, he eventually reconciled with her and left Michigan to be near her and his new step-father there.\n\n“That was a full circle for him, on a personal standpoint,” Brother Waters said. “It really demonstrates how true, how committed to family he was. It had a big impact on him.”\n\nRob uses that analogy when reflecting on his relationship with Jim, given their beginnings in high school and how that evolved over many years.\n\n“You plant 2 trees next to each other, and even if they were compatible trees to begin with, it’s pretty rare that they’d grow in the same way and direction,” Rob said. “We aren’t the people now that we started out as, or who we’ll end up as. It’s almost a crapshoot people can evolve in the same direction.\n\n“What I’ve always always found remarkable about the fraternity experience, is it throws you into a crucible with people you may not have that much in common with,” he added. “It is remarkable, because there is so much shared experience, so much shared commonality. Trees that don’t make much sense being in the same place end up growing together, changing the direction they’d grow if not for the other.”\n\nWe are sad to say goodbye to Brother Lambouris as a founding father and longtime member of our Zeta-Pi Chapter. We send our continued condolences and wishes to Jim’s family, but know he lives on in brotherhood.\n\nInstead of flowers or donations (per the family’s request), our Sigma Pi chapter at Oakland University has planted a tree in Jim’s memory through an American Forests memorial partnership.\n\nThe online description says: “When you choose to have a memorial tree planted for James, you are doing more than simply putting a plant in the ground. You are making a long-term commitment to the environment and rooting the memories of James in our planet for countless years to come. A memorial tree is a unique tribute which provides global benefits like no other memorial gift could.”\n\nYou can read the online obituary for James Edward Lambouris as well as an online tribute and fundraiser posted by his family.\n\nRIP, Brother."
