        "text": "Yes, absolutely! This chapter of Delta Sigma Pi is committed to providing a welcoming and inclusive space for all brothers and potential new members. We welcome members who meet our professional standards regardless of race, ethnicity, creed, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity, marital status, national origin, age, disability, or veteran status. As brothers, we celebrate our differences and legacy of diversity, which makes us better business leaders and more compassionate members of society. With recruitment approaching, we are looking forward to expanding our diverse group of professional individuals, and we can’t wait to meet all of you!\n\nThere are many benefits to joining Delta Sigma Pi! After joining, you have access to events, conferences, and other resources that allow you to build your professional skills, leadership abilities, and character. Not only do you get to have these experiences, but you also are able to build long-lasting friendships within our brotherhood. Unlike other college business groups, your affiliation with Delta Sigma Pi does not end after graduation. Members are supported throughout their lives within their jobs, communities, and relationships as they strive to make a difference.\n\nOur chapter holds a recruitment cycle during the beginning of the Spring and Fall semesters. Recruitment consists of a series of events designed for potential new members to meet active brothers and better understand who we are as a chapter and as a fraternity. If you attend our recruitment events, you will be invited to submit an application and partake in our interview process. After applying and interviewing, you may or may not receive a bid to pledge for our chapter. Please refer to the “Recruitment” tab at the top of our website for more information.\n\nAll freshman, sophomore, and juniors majoring in Business or Economics who have at least a 2.5 GPA are welcome to apply to Delta Sigma Pi. We look for candidates who share our values of brotherhood, professionalism, community service, and scholarship, as well as those who are academically and professionally motivated. Brothers have joined Delta Sigma Pi for many reasons: to get involved on campus, meet new people, better themselves professionally, and to join an organization with like-minded individuals.\n\nAfter recruitment concludes, you may receive a bid from our chapter inviting you to partake in the pledge process of our fraternity. Pledging is an opportunity to learn and grow alongside your peers throughout a 5 week long process. The process is designed to help you grow personally and professionally, shaping you into a young business professional of the highest caliber. The pledging process is equivalent to a 3 credit class or an internship and allows for pledges to learn about the history of the fraternity.\n\nPledges are taught about our Fraternity’s history and operational requirements, while honing their soft skills through leadership development and team-building events put on by your Pledge Education class.\n\nPledges are each paired with a Big Brother, who will act as their mentor during and after their pledging process.\n\nAt the end of the pledging process, pledges are considered for formal initiation into the chapter."
