By design, Financial Management Association (FMA) and Investment Club (IC) are intended to work closely together. FMA will hold weekly meetings that revolve around a presentation, discussion, and questions. Biweekly, Investment Club will host a meeting directly following FMA. Because the club's holdings are not intended to be short-term or cash cows, the change in the market should not warrant weekly reviews of the portfolio or proposals. IC members are expected to attend the FMA meeting that precedes the IC meeting to stay current on financial trends in the market or broad concepts that could be beneficial. The attendance of IC members will be treated as guests by FMA.\n\nBy keeping FMA and IC fundamentally and structurally separate, we keep the scope for potential members broad without preventing from membership those who may want to be involved in one, not the other, for any reason. As the two respective clubs gain momentum, there is potential for a need to combine the two groups, which is an option. However, at ground zero, the current student officer group has determined it necessary to gain more feedback from students, as current impressions of the student body are that FMA and IC are not the same and do not hold the same appeal to everyone, respectively.\n\nMarriage%20and%20Family%20Therapy%20Student%20Organization\n\nMinority%20Association%20of%20Pre-Medical%20Students%20%28MAPS%29\n\nInstagram: @usm_maps\n\nThe purpose of this organization is to provide resources and a network to better prepare students for their desired health career.\n\nMississippi Professional Educators Student Chapter (MPEFREEUSM%29\n\nThis organization' chapter, Mississippi Professional Educators, at USM is allowing any college student who is seeking a degree in Education to interact and create learning environments that showcases the future of better education for the young students in Mississippi.\n\nNational Organization of Minority Architect Students (NOMAS)\n\nInstagram: @usm_nomas\n\nNational%20Society%20of%20Black%20Engineers\n\nInstagram: @usm_nsbe\n\nThe National Society of Black Engineers (NSBE) is dedicated to increasing the representation of culturally responsible Black engineers who excel academically, succeed professionally, and positively impact their communities.
