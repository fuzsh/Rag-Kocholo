        "text": "Since its founding at Long Beach State in 1955, the Sigma Pi Fraternity has been instrumental in building `Beach Pride' that continuously permeates the entire campus, especially its student-athletes. This pride has been taken to an entirely new level as the Greek organization and its alums have declared and awarded a gift of $100,000 to the Department of Athletics and the Beach Athletic Club to be used to re-brand the Long Beach State presence in the athletic facilities, recruiting areas, and administrative offices.\n\nThe vision and group gift was led by alums Mike Ryan ('63), Nelson Farris ('69) and Pete Boothroyd ('64). After a tour of the Walter Pyramid by 40 Sigma Pi brothers last December, the trio pushed the idea of creating a lasting financial legacy that would help the school as well as promote the active chapter. By joining forces with Athletics, Sigma Pi is playing a major role in re-branding the school's athletics history and success through display of imagery and accolades throughout areas of the athletics complex.\n\n\"Athletics are the most visible and publicized activity for any University, much often bringing stronger name recognition to the campus,\" said Ryan and Boothroyd.\n\n\"Our gift was a way to recognize Sigma Pi and to give something back to our root University through the most visible method.\"\n\nThe group presented the $100,000 check to the the Department on behalf of Sigma Pi during an on court ceremony at halftime of the annual Homecoming basketball game at the Walter Pyramid on November 15, 2014. It was also the first men's basketball game with the school's new 60-foot video screen, which is the largest on-campus wall-mounted screen in the nation.\n\n\"Sport is a powerful model of what you can do when you get any type of a team together with good espirit de corps, good communication between all segments of the team and every one to work together towards the same objectives,\" said Farris. Some Brothers of Sigma Pi came together, like a sport team, to raise funds to help Athletics and Long Beach State. We did something most people thought was impossible and produced winning results.\"\n\nSome of the key projects that have already been completed or are in the process of fulfillment due to the Sigma Pi gift are:\n\nFull Renovation of the Ukleja Athletics Suite in the Walter Pyramid\n\nGraphics additions to the men's and women's basketball office and recruiting areas\n\nCreation of a new secondary hospitality space\n\nGraphics and tradition additions to the Walter Pyramid public areas\n\nGraphics additions to the administrative offices in the Walter Pyramid\n\nLogos/Graphics additions to the Ken Lindgren Aquatics Center\n\nGraphics additions to historic Blair Field\n\nGraphics and tradition additions to George Allen Field and the Softball Complex\n\nGraphics additions to the Athletics Performance Complex\n\nTo date, more than 50 Sigma Pi alumni have contributed to the $100,000 campaign, which began in May, including some former student-athletes. \"Long Beach State has turned out Olympians, politicians, actors, doctors, lawyers, and the list of success stories goes on and on,\" said Sigma Pi alum and former basketball student-athlete John Hatten (`85-`89). \"As a former student-athlete or student how can you not give back a small piece of your success to the place where it all started?\"\n\nThe Athletics Department refreshed its logos in mid-July 2014 as well as creating some guidelines to direct the positioning of what has become one of the nation's most recognizable brands - the Beach. Hatten later added, \"I have been very blessed as an adult and I feel I owe a great deal of my success to Long Beach State, the athletic department and Sigma Pi.\""
