        "text": "Post by multiyapples on\n\nMy name is Tristan and I interviewed Aric on the Yellow team on Endurance: High Sierras. Many thanks Aric for answering the questions. It was amazing to interview you.\n\nTristan: Who do you still keep in contact with from Endurance? Is there anyone you wish you still kept in touch with?\n\nAric: Not very many. I have most of them on social media but I don't get the chance to talk to them very often. As far as keeping touch with, not really. I don't mean that in a bad way. It's just that it's been a long time since we've filmed the show and it's hard to always stay in touch with people.\n\nTristan: What are you doing and where are you living now?\n\nAric: I'm a music teacher and still in South Dakota\n\nTristan: If you could do Endurance again, would you? Is there anything you would change if you did it again?\n\nAric: Sure. I would definitely have done the Superboats mission.\n\nTristan: How so?\n\nAric: What they didn't show was that Lilly and I were going to do that mission but we were convinced that Blue could do it. I think we would have definitely won that mission and the next (the one that Green one) So it would have dramatically changed the outlook of the season.\n\nTristan: That actually leads to my next question. How did you feel about the way you were portrayed on the show? Was it accurate or not?\n\nAric: It was accurate, to an extent. I was polite and got along with everyone but I think they definitely stereotyped me as the \"humble midwest kid\". I was far more competitive strategic than they ever showed. and strategic\n\nTristan: How did you find out about Endurance?\n\nAric: Just saw it on TV one Saturday morning. I actually remember seeing the show that was the prequel to Endurance, called \"Moolah Beach\".\n\nTristan: What was you favorite part about being on the show?\n\nAric: Actually getting on. It was so surreal to actually be standing in front of JD and take part in that show. When we got there, they told us that over 10,000 kids from all over the country applied to get on. It really put things into perspective and helped us appreciate the experience more. I was a fan for years and had tried to get on the year prior but actually making the cut (in my final year to do so, too) was really awesome.\n\nTristan: That is so cool. Also impressive that you got on.\n\nAric: Yeah. Only person from my state to get on.\n\nTristan: Are there any non-invasive ways fans from the show can get in touch with you?\n\nAric: fb would be their best bet. As long as they're respectful and don't spam or ask for unusual requests, I will befriend them.\n\nOnce again thanks Aric for taking the time to answer my questions. I am very grateful that answered the questions. Please remember to be polite, respectful, and understanding that he has a life outside of Endurance!"
