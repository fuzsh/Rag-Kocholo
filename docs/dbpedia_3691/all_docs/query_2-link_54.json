The crowd-favorite Slam Dunk Contest, sponsored by Piedmont Airlines, will take place Dec. 29.\n\nJust before Friday’s contests, recipients of the Butch Waller Scholarship will be recognized on the court. The scholarship honors Delmarva basketball legend Butch Waller, who has impacted the lives of athletes and families for over 50 years.\n\nDaily admission is $15, and tournament passes (valid for all days of the tournament) are $50. Daily admission for kids ages 3-11 is $8, and tournament passes for kids are $25. Kids ages 2 and under are admitted free.
