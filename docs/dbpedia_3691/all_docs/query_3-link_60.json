        "text": "Contrary to popular belief, money does not move the world , financials do. If you dont believe me, ask any company that keeps disorganized financial records how many loans they receive and how many investors invest in them. How long do they last? Get the point. Unfortunately, it is not much different with individuals. Mismanage your checking account, dont keep track of your credit cards and soon youll have someone tell you, can you spell bankruptcy. Therefore the value and use of :\n\nare essential to your financial well being.\n\nUse the following websites to assist you in making your financial dreams a reality:\n\nhttp://extension.unl.edu/welfare/check.htm University of Nebraska website that shows the steps to balance a checkbook.\n\nhttp://ianr.unl.edu/pubs/homemgt/nf4.htm Another site from the University of Nebraska that shows step by step how to balance a checkbook.\n\nhttp://ianr.unl.edu/pubs/homemgt/Control management resource center site that shows you how to manage money, insurance as well as giving tips on other financial topics.\n\nhttp://cccsintl.org/ Consumer Credit and Counseling Service provides budget counseling, educational programs and debt management assistance.\n\nMoney Central - http://moneycentral.msn.com/home.asp\n\nhttp://library.thinkquest.org/3478/ Financial Planning Page that contains numerous links to financial websites.\n\nhttp://office.microsoft.com/assistance/offhelp/off2000/excel/ This is the Microsoft Excel online help. You can use this site for help on creating graphs and different options with the charts.\n\nhttp://personalbudgeting.com/ Personal Budgeting Site that contains many tips on how to save and track your personal expenses.\n\nhttp://tuliptreepress.com/ Budget Central provides you with information on why we should budget, how to get motivated, when to start and advice regarding budgeting.\n\nNote: This is a broad unit, you may go more in-depth in your presentation of this unit depending on your students. Use anecdotes, personal experiences when teaching the unit. This unit serves only as a starting with which you should take your students as far as you can. You may wish to spend time more time discussing budgeting as well as other types of investments. The exam should be given before the Spending Wisely lesson, it gives you a good idea if your students are grasping the concepts. Questions from the exam are pulled verbatim from the actual websites used and I told my students this. (I didn't tell them which questions though.) It took my classes(8th graders) 30 to 40 minutes to finish the exam. I will try to provide more suggestions in the lessons.\n\nClick on the dollar sign to go the Mott Hall Index\n\nFor any questions or comments, please email asalcedo@motthall.echalk.com\n\nLast modified 12/1/02 by Anthony Salcedo"
