The teams will attempt to win ‘idols’ each containing clues to the whereabouts of the cash-prize.\n\nSaban International's president, Stan Golden said of the series, {With the phenomenal ratings of reality-based series targeting adults in prime-time, Saban and Fox Family are anticipating Moolah Beach to achieve outstanding ratings with ‘tween’ audiences worldwide.{\n\nAlong with News Corporation, Saban Entertainment recently sold its stake in Fox Family Worldwide and to Disney."
