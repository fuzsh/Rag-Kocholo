        "text": "More than 100 Division I recruits and multiple nationally ranked players will showcase their skills during the 41st annual Governors Challenge.\n\nThe tournament will take place Tuesday, Dec. 26 through Saturday, Dec. 30, at the Wicomico Civic Center and surrounding locations.\n\nThis year’s format will include five divisions: the Elite Showcase, Boys Brackets, Moolah Girls Bracket, Boys Shore Showcase and Moolah Girls Shore Showcase. A total of 114 teams will travel from 11 states and Canada, including nationally ranked programs with hundreds of college and professional prospects.\n\n“This is the best high school basketball experience in the country,” said Tournament Director James Simmons. “We strive to exceed player and spectator expectations year after year.”\n\nThe event will feature more than just games.\n\nStudent-athletes will compete in the Aetna All-Star Experience, which begins at 8:30 p.m., Wednesday, Dec. 27 and Friday, Dec. 29.\n\nBoth nights include the Skills Challenge and Three Point Contests. The crowd-favorite Slam Dunk Contest will take place Dec. 29.\n\nJust before Friday’s contests, recipients of the Butch Waller Scholarship will be recognized on the court. The scholarship honors Delmarva basketball legend Butch Waller, who has impacted the lives of athletes and families for more than 50 years.\n\nDaily admission is $15, and tournament passes (valid for all days) are $50. Daily admission for kids ages 3-11 is $8, and tournament passes for kids are $25. Kids ages 2 and under are admitted free. A limited number of weeklong courtside passes ($100) and daily VIP passes ($75) are available for the Wicomico Civic Center location.\n\nStudents can participate in Student Sections and compete in a variety of halftime competitions for prizes."
