At the conclusion of the second cycle, a half-hour Moolah Beach: The Reunion special was aired, in which the contestants discussed what they had been doing since the series ended, as well as fielding questions from audience members. At the end of the program, Roth stated that a new season of Moolah Beach would be airing in the summer of 2002, but that never materialized. The format of the show was later reworked into the Discovery Kids series Endurance.
