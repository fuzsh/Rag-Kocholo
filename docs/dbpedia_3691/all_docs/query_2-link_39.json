        "text": "Endurance\n\nYTV, 7 p.m. If you haven't already had it up to here with Survivor knock-offs and other versions of the reality TV formula, YTV is running a sneak preview of Endurance this week. In this youthful variation, 10 boys and 10 girls from across the U.S. are stranded together on a desert island, where they compete for a grand prize. It starts with a mystery cruise on an 82-foot yacht, where, cut off from family, friends and cell phones, they have no idea where they're headed. They land on an island off the California coast, pair up and compete in all sorts of physical and mental competitions, the ultimate prize being a dream vacation. It's all been done before, from MTV's Road Rules, which preceded Survivor, to Fox's Moolah Beach, the Saturday-morning Survivor for kids. Endurance runs Monday to Thursday, and culminates in a double episode on Aug. 28. The series repeats on Discovery Kids in September, followed by a second season."
