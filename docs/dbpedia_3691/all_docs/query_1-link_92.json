Iâm your host, Andy, and I created reality blurred 24 years ago as a blog to collect interesting links I found about reality TV.\n\nToday, itâs home to a wide range of writing about entertainment rooted in real life, from competition reality shows to true-crime documentaries, and a vibrant community of pop culture fans.\n\nAs a writer who obsessively and critically covers reality TV, focusing on how itâs made and what it means, I review and recommend reality TV shows; analyze news and report from behind the scenes; and interview people who create and star in reality TV shows.\n\nI believe pop culture can both entertain and affect us, and so reality blurredâs goal is to amplify the best and hold the worst accountable. In other words, letâs call out the worst, celebrate the best, and talk about it all."
