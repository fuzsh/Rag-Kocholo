        "text": "It is a well-known fact that slot games are a widespread form of gambling and online and land based casinos offer a great variety of themes and exclusive features that keep players entertained for quite some time.\n\nContrary to a popular belief, winning a decent sum from a slot machine does not require pushing the spin button only and waiting to hit the big jackpot. Actually, the right slot strategy, the amount of your bet, the proper maintenance of your bankroll, and the RTP are some of the important factors you need to take into account when choosing where to place your bet.\n\nAlthough some players prefer to engage in playing slots with fixed jackpots as they are believed to grant smaller but frequent winnings, you can hardly feel the excitement of changing your living standard in a few minutes, unless you try a progressive slot.\n\nNo matter if you prefer penny slots or you are a huge fan of the high roller slots that enable the chance to win big money, you must be familiar with the slots that have granted the biggest jackpots over the last year and which feature the largest progressive jackpots now.\n\nLargest Progessive Jackpot Wins\n\nGolden Sevens\n\nThere is something fascinating about slots featuring sevens and it is even better when these slots provide players with other fun symbols, and most of all, incredible jackpots. A player passionate about playing Golden Sevens increased their bank account with an overwhelming sum of €4,065,508.\n\nBest Online Slots Bonuses\n\nMega Moolah\n\nMicrogaming–powered Mega Moolah is one of the most popular slot games, featuring an incredible jackpot and a number of other special symbols that help you increase your winnings. The high demand for exciting and most of all, profitable slot games, made Microgaming developers enhance the game. And apart from the original Mega Moolah slot, released in 2006, you can also take advantage of the Isis, Summertime and 5 reel Drive versions of Mega Moolah.\n\nAlong with The Dark Knight, they are attached to the progressive jackpot pool. Every time a player places a bet on one of the five games, a percentage of the wager is set aside for the progressive jackpot. The amazing popularity of the game makes the jackpot pool grow really fast.\n\nBeach Life\n\nAlthough Playtech is associated mainly with the Marvel slots and the great features they offer, the Beach Life slot is also worthy of mentioning. It has been among the slots that have the biggest progressive jackpots. Beach Life has some incredible features including wilds, scatters, bonuses, and free spins features. The biggest jackpot ever won by a player was estimated at $8,211,488.\n\nHall of Gods\n\nNetEnt is regarded as the slot provider that plays an important role in the development of the contemporary slot industry and every player knows about the incredible animations, graphics, and fun themes their slots feature. The best NetEnt games offer plenty of opportunities for winning a progressive jackpot and Hall of Gods is not an exception. The slot is available in the best casinos run on the NetEnt gaming platform and features 5 reels, 20 paylines, and special symbols that increase your chances of winning.\n\nMega Fortune"
