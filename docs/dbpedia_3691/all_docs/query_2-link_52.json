        "text": "No matter what you think - you don’t own the BuyBox, Amazon does. Here are 2 main reasons why Amazon kicks a private label brand out of the Buy Box? Here's the inside baseball: 1) Competitive Pricing Threshold: your prices are higher than on other channels. What you might not realize: ⚾ Amazon often messes this up, forcing sellers into endless support ticket battles. ⚾ When you adjust prices on other channels to reclaim your Buy Box, Amazon’s response may lag, plus updates on other channels aren't exactly swift. ⚾ Not every ASIN is monitored for price competitiveness, and some ASINs that shouldn't be monitored are under scrutiny. ⚾ Sometimes, the Amazon price thresholds are set so high they're practically irrelevant. 2) Amazon's Price Ceiling: They cap how high your prices can go. Push your prices too high and here’s what unfolds: ⚾ You'll temporarily lose the Buy Box but you can regain it once Amazon adjusts to the new price level—assuming you make sales at this higher price. ⚾ Set a price too high without sales to back it, and the Buy Box is gone for good, unless you lower your prices. ⚾ If sales do happen at higher prices, it usually takes a few days to win back the Amazon Buy Box. This presents an interesting dilemma for private label sellers and pricing strategies: 🏷 Losing the Buy Box means immediate sales and rank loss, but it opens a window to test higher price points, which could lead to higher operating profit in the long-run. 🏷 But it is a careful balance between profit maximization and making sure you maintain your Best Seller Rank (BSR). 🏷But armed with the right strategies, you can turn these challenges into opportunities. We call it — Profasee. I’ll see you on the winning side. Rooting for you.\n\nRaise your prices = scare away customers. Reduce your prices = profits sink, drastically. Sounds familiar? As an Amazon seller, you’ve probably suffered this headache-inducing dilemma. Price too high, and customers run to cheaper competitors. Price too low, and you’ll be flushing profits down the drain. Headaches. Headaches. Headaches. So what’s the solution? Well, there’s a sweet spot — a way to constantly flick and twitch your pricing… So your bottom line remains profitable….and you lose neither customers… nor profit. But, you can’t do it manually. Yup. Why? You’ll need to compute millions of data. You’ll waste time. And you’ll squander resources. How do I know? I’m an Amazon seller myself. I’ve seen the highs and lows. I’ve suffered from Chinese competitors. And I’ve suffered the profit headache. So what did I do? Just look at this image of garlic press listings, with pricing all over the place. NONE of them have any idea why they are priced the way they are. Well… here: You see, I and a team of brilliant engineers thought long and hard, brainstormed, worked our 🍑🍑🍑 off… And put together a software — A software with AI-enhanced abilities to accurately & consistently compile these millions of data, analyze them, and offer you the most optimal price to sell your product. So you make the most money at your bottomline… enjoy the profits… with zero negative impact on your BSR. We have a chunk of Amazon sellers already profiting from this software. But, I wanna help a few more. Cause I’ve been in your shoes. And know how it bites. So.. for a short time… I’m granting 5 Amazon brands (in the US) exclusive access to Profasee. We’ll show you how it works… and let you take it for a spin at 50% Off. If you’d like at least a 10% increase in profits for your HERO ASINs… reply HERO in the comments & we’ll set you up instantly. Listen … From one seller to another… if you’re focused on profiting on Amazon… I see no reason why you shouldn’t grab this offer asap! Cheers to more profitability… Chad\n\nI’ve built and sold Skubana for 8-figures. No Yale degree. No Ivy League connections. Got my first finance job from cold outreach. Fired from Wall Street. Worked out of my parents' vacuum store. Taught myself e-commerce and SAAS by doing it wrong first. Had no mentors to guide me. I met my business partners online. Faced more rejections than I can count. Yet, life’s good. And I travel the world with my family. You can succeed without a prestigious degree, a huge network, or wealthy parents. It’s the new world we live in today. There’s no right path. No formula. All you need… is to be stubborn. Cause in this new world, stubborn people win. PS: finishing a 6-week adventure through Italy, Switzerland, and now Barcelona. 🥂 to the journey and stubbornness that makes it all possible!\n\nAgencies are losing Amazon brands a lot of dough 🍕 Well, not all the agencies – just the bad eggs. Here’s what I mean. Every week I talk to brand owners and they all complain about the same thing; 🍕An Agency they hired sold them a half-baked service. 🍕No results. No ROI. Just hollow, unfulfilled promises – and wasted dough. 🍕And as you’d imagine – these brands aren’t happy about this. Now let me be clear. There are some outstanding agencies out there - the rare gems that deliver value, empower brands, and transform trajectories. But there's a growing cancer of mediocrity that's threatening to overshadow their good work. So the question is; how do we curtail this growing epidemic? Brands invest a ton in agencies. Yet, they bleed for it. And the real tragedy here is the lasting impact on the industry. Unimpressive agencies aren't just damaging their own reputations. They're creating a ripple effect of mistrust, making every new pitch for the good ones an Everest to climb. So. Again, the question is – how do we remedy this? 🌈 What are your thoughts? PS: Finishing my last week in Italy, perfecting my pizza while making a lot of dough for brands on Amazon!\n\nUnpopular Amazon take: Ad spend & PPC do not move the profit needle as much as pricing. Yes. Our data at Profasee has shown this. You see, Amazon brands invest heavily in campaigns… and in PPC strategies like it’s the be-all end-all. But there’s a lever smart brands are pulling. A lever with maximum impact. The price lever. Don’t get me wrong. I love PPC. It’s vital if you wanna stay relevant. But, though you may not have noticed… the impact pricing has on your bottom line far outweighs that of PPC. The two have to work hand in hand. Yes. But pricing needs to be shown more love, too. A change in price today, can open the doors of dollars tomorrow. You need a pricing strategy. And you need it today. Don’t rely on guesswork. Don’t tweak price once and move on. Adjust it strategically. Continuously. And watch your profits soar. Speaking from experience. Chad."
