        "text": "In March 2018, WWE announced a WrestleMania match that would begin a new annual tradition – the Fabulous Moolah Battle Royal.\n\nWith an in-ring career that spanned six decades, the Fabulous Moolah – real name Mary Lillian Ellison – was the biggest name in American women’s wrestling for 30 years.\n\nAccording to wrestling lore she reigned as women’s champ for 28 years.\n\nMoolah – who passed away in 2007 – wasn’t just a wrestler.\n\nShe was a trainer and booker too, controlling many of the top female wrestlers working in the US.\n\nShe held a tight stranglehold over women’s wrestling and took a sizable cut of her girls’ earnings.\n\nWrestling historians Pat Laprade and Dan Murphy described Moolah’s influence in their book Sisterhood of the Squared Circle.\n\nThey wrote: “Respected by her allies and feared by her enemies, Ellison was a master politician and a shrewd, calculating businesswoman.”\n\nMoolah was no stranger to controversy.\n\nIn 1985, she conspired with Vince McMahon in ‘the original screwjob’.\n\nThey screwed Wendi Richter out of the women’s title – 12 years before McMahon did it to Bret Hart.\n\nFor Attitude Era fans, Moolah is best remembered for her double-act with Mae Young – two batty old women who took guitar shots, crashed through tables, and wrestled evening gown matches.\n\nMoolah even had one last run with the women’s championship in 1999, aged 76.\n\nBut in the years since her death, accusations have mounted against Moolah’s legacy – from taking financial advantage of her trainees to horrific sex abuse.\n\nMany others have come to her defence.\n\nBut – in the wake of allegations and the Me Too movement – WWE announcing the Fabulous Moolah Battle Royal was a typically tone deaf move.\n\nA backlash from fans and – perhaps more importantly – WrestleMania sponsor Snickers, WWE swiftly dropped Moolah’s name from the match.\n\nHer legacy remains tarnished.\n\nBorn on July 22, 1923, Mary Lillian Ellison was a wrestling fan from childhood.\n\nShe was inspired by top female wrestler Mildred Burke and got her start under Burke’s husband and promoter Billy Wolfe. Ellison wrestled her first match in July 1948.\n\nWhile other women were expected to sleep with Wolfe and other promoters, Ellison refused.\n\nConsequently, he never booked her as a top name.\n\nGoing to work for promoter Jack Pfefer, Ellison became ‘Slave Girl Moolah’ – a leopard print-clad valet to Buddy Rogers (the first ever WWE Champion) and later Elephant Boy.\n\nThe name Moolah came from her love of cash.\n\nWhen Jack Pfefer asked her why she wanted to wrestle, she replied: “For the money! I want to wrestle for the moolah!”\n\nMoolah first worked for Vincent J. McMahon (father of WWE owner Vince McMahon) in 1955 and won a newly-created championship on September 18, 1956. McMahon Sr renamed her ‘The Fabulous Moolah’.\n\nMoolah became a trainer and booker with her husband Buddy Lee.\n\nPat Laprade and Dan Murphy wrote: “In many ways, Moolah was women’s wrestling’s version of Don Corleone… and her tactics could be just as ruthless and cutthroat as those of ‘the Godfather.’”\n\nMoolah trained women at a 40-acre compound in Columbia, South Carolina.\n\nHer trainees lived there, paying up to $300 rent per month on top of a percentage of their bookings.\n\nSome reports say Moolah took 20-30 percent – others say 50 percent.\n\nNotable ‘Moolah Girls’ include Rita Cortez, Ann Casey, Judy Grable, Vivian Vachon, Bette Boucher, Susan Green, Princess Victoria, Wendi Richter, and Leilani Kai.\n\nSpeaking on Dark Side of the Ring, Jim Cornette said: “For the better part of 25 years, every top girl wrestler was trained by Moolah, booked out by Moolah, and was controlled by Moolah’s group.”\n\nAnother of her trainees was \"Sweet Georgia Brown\" – real name Susie Mae McCoy – remembered as South Carolina’s first black female wrestler.\n\nIn 2006, a story was published in the Columbia Free Press, detailing hardships and abuse McCoy suffered on the road.\n\nAccording to the story, based on accounts from McCoy’s children, McCoy was forbidden from having her own bank account and she barely saw her children while she was on the road.\n\nSmall amounts of money would be sent back – coming directly from Moolah and Buddy Lee.\n\nIn one incident, McCoy returned home to her children but was dragged back into a car by a white couple, as if held against her will.\n\nMcCoy later told her daughter that the couple were in fact Moolah and Buddy.\n\nThe story claimed that on the road McCoy was ‘raped, given drugs and made an addict’. Her family believed it was an effort to control her.\n\nThe story said: “On the road, Susie Mae received odd knocks on the door at strange hours.\n\n\"Then, she told Barbara, she would begin taking off her dress. When she didn’t comply, she was beaten, often brutally.”\n\nMcCoy would return from the road pregnant. In Dark Side of the Ring, McCoy's son Michael questions whether his biological father is Buddy Lee.\n\nSome critics have also accused Moolah of holding back the business and development of women’s wrestling in the US.\n\nMoolah was certainly no technical wizard. She was best known for her hair-pulling and cat-fighting style.\n\nThough the real training grunt work was left to her more established girls at the compound, Moolah's style was handed down.\n\nBefore Moolah – in the days of Mildred Burke and June Byers – women’s wrestling was a headline draw. Under Moolah, it became secondary to the men by a significant margin.\n\nWrestling journalist and historian Dave Meltzer said: “During the period Moolah controlled wrestling, the popularity and product didn’t evolve… Women’s wrestling under her tutelage, and I don’t know if it’s her fault, went way down.”\n\nMoolah was a pioneer though. She helped overturn the New York Athletic Commission’s ban on women’s wrestling. In 1972, she wrestled the first women’s match at Madison Square Garden against Vicki Williams.\n\nIt wasn't a hit with fans. A New York Times reviewer said: “The crowd did not take to the women and it remained subdued compared with the frenzied state of crowds at men's wrestling shows.”\n\nWhen Vince McMahon Jr purchased WWE in the early Eighties, Moolah sold him the championship and worked exclusively for the rapidly-growing promotion.\n\nThe story that she'd been the champ for 28 years straight became official WWE history. In truth, she'd dropped the belt for brief spells to a number of her girls.\n\nMoolah became part of ‘The Rock ‘n’ Wrestling Connection’ – a partnership between WWE, MTV, and celebrities which transformed the New York-based WWE into a national – and eventually – global phenomenon.\n\nMoolah – by now in her 60s – played the heel opposite Wendi Richter, a student from Moolah’s school who was now positioned as the female equivalent to Hulk Hogan.\n\nWith Cyndi Lauper in her corner, Richter beat Moolah for the title at The Brawl to End It All on July 23, 1984. But Moolah still manipulated the division.\n\nSpeaking on The Dark Side of the Ring, Richter claimed Moolah was jealous of her and that during one of their many matches Moolah tried to break her back with a Boston crab.\n\nWhen McMahon decided to ditch Richter, he devised ‘the original screw jon’ with Moolah.\n\nOn November 25, 1985, Richter faced the masked Spider Lady. Richter had no idea that it was actually Moolah under the mask.\n\nMoolah caught Richter in a small package and the referee counted three – even though Richter’s shoulders were up. Moolah had stolen the win and title for real.\n\nIn another oft-told story, Moolah sabotaged former trainees Lelani Kai and Judy Martin – who were wrestling as the Glamour Girls – and screwed them out of a big tag title match at WrestleMania IV.\n\nRichter accused Moolah of setting back the growing women’s division.\n\nRichter said: “I was angry for what she just did to women’s wrestling. For so long she held it back… finally it started to bloom and she killed it.”\n\nIt's true that the women were soon fazed out. It wasn’t until the mid 2010s that the division became an equal to the men’s.\n\nIn 1995, Moolah was the first woman entered into the WWE Hall of Fame. She returned in 1999 as part of her Attitude Era partnership with Mae Young.\n\nMoolah continued to make appearances and even wrestled on her 80th birthday. After the match Randy Orton – in his ‘Legend Killer’ phase – hit Moolah with the RKO.\n\nIn 2002, the late Luna Vachon – an on-off star in Nineties WWE – made accusations against Moolah. She claimed that Moolah had sent her – when Luna was aged just 16 – to have pictures taken by an older man.\n\nLuna also claimed her aunt Vivian Vachon – who also trained there – had seen Moolah drinking heavily and having sex with her trainees.\n\nFormer wrestler Peggy Lee Leather refuted the claim. She said there was indeed a man who liked to take photos of female wrestlers. Moolah would ask the girls if they wanted to pose but they weren't forced and there was nothing sexual – and Luna was in her 20s at the time, not 16.\n\nIn 2014, former wrestler Jeannine Mjoseth AKA ‘Mad Maxine’ made more accusations of abuse. In an interview with Slam Wrestling, Mjoseth described Moolah as ‘an evil person’.\n\nAccording to the interview, the fees for rent and training at Moolah’s compound cost up to $1,500.\n\nMjoseth said: “The girls went into debt to her and she controlled their lives. I made sure I had a job so I could have a phone and a car. The others were kind of marooned. It was an environment ripe for abuse.”\n\nShe also made claims that Moolah was a pimp.\n\nMjoseth said: “Moolah did send girls out to this guy in Arizona and pimped them out. I actually spoke to him on the phone and asked him what he was looking for. He said, ‘If I’m spending all this money, you know what I want.’ That was part of Moolah’s way of making money. She was just a bad person. Moolah didn’t have a good bone in her body.”\n\nPrincess Victoria – real name Vickie Otis – was another of Moolah’s trainees and co-held the WWE women’s tag titles in 1984. She suffered a broken neck, which ended her career.\n\nSpeaking on The Dark Side of the Ring, Victoria described that Moolah forced her to take repeated bumps with the injury.\n\nMoolah also sent Victoria to Amsterdam to meet a man. Moolah told her: “The nicer you are to him, the bigger your pay day will be. And you could really use a pay day.”\n\nVictoria refused the man’s sexual advances. But she owed Moolah rent – so Moolah took back expensive wrestling costumes she’d given to Victoria as gifts. Victoria left the compound with just $20.\n\nBut Princess Victoria has also spoken in defence of Moolah. In 2018, she was one of several former Moolah girls on a Cauliflower Alley Club panel about Moolah’s legacy. Victoria said: “Did Moolah pimp us out? No.”\n\nThe history of Moolah's control over women's wrestling is certainly murky and cut throat.\n\nBut many others have denied the more serious allegations. Also present at the panel were Judy Martin and Joyce Grable, who defended Moolah. Wrestling insider and broadcaster Nigel Sherrod set up a campaign to clear Moolah's name.\n\nLeilani Kai – a former WWE women’s champ herself – has spoken up for Moolah, despite past personal and financial issues between them.\n\nSpeaking on Madusa’s Full Throttle podcast, Kai said she worked under Moolah for 20 years and never witnessed any of the alleged abuses.\n\nKai said: “In the long run, these things are down right lies that I've heard so far. Some of them were really bad lies. She had never once drugged any of us, I've heard that. She never pimped any of us out that I know of, I've never experienced anything like that. She was the champion, she was the booker, and she was a great legend. She deserves to be honored for eternity.”\n\nSpeaking on the Cauliflower Alley Club panel, Princess Victoria and the others criticised WWE's decision to remove her name from the battle royale.\n\nVictoria said: “What they have done to her legacy is crap. You can’t erase history. You cannot take Moolah out of the women’s wrestling history and explain how it got from A to B. She was a fantastic worker. She was a b***h at times. But she never pimped us out. But she did do some things that were highly questionable.”"
