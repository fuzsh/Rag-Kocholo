Since then, he’s competed in the Iceman, Arcadia Grit & Gravel and Fat Chance races and is training for an increased race schedule. You can find him dodging trees on trails throughout Northwest Michigan and the Upper Peninsula on everything from a single-speed to a fat bike.\n\nJeremy Hudson\n\nJeremy Hudson is a Registered Dietitian Nutritionist who was unfamiliar with triathlon while living in Chicago in 2009 when a friend invited him to complete the Super Super Sprint race. When Jeremy, naive to endurance sports, crossed his first triathlon finish line, he hadn’t yet realized the crush he’d develop with a new sport — or three! Nine years later, after a nauseating amount of hours training and a financial investment in equipment and race fees he’d rather not think about, Jeremy has used his nutritional expertise to complete a plethora of endurance races of varying distances and disciplines. His racing highlights include racing three Ironman races and representing the United States at the ITU Long Course World Championships in Motala, Sweden in 2015. Jeremy attacks each day with the motto of late Navy SEAL Charlie Keating IV: “Anything worth doing is worth overdoing. Moderation is for cowards.”\n\nRalf Mielke\n\nRalf Mielke is a German-born fella living in the United States for the last 16 years.

He enjoys competing in bike races, triathlons, and has completed a full Ironman in NYC in 2012 and swam the Straits of Mackinac during the Might Mac Swim in 2019 together with his wife.\n\nAbigail O’ Farrell\n\nRunning has taken Abigail O’Farrell many places and she can confidently claim she would not be where she is today without it. Abigail balances being a wife, mother of five children, dairy farmer, and runner. Her running tenure began in high school with all-star performances that culminated in two State Champion titles. It continued at North Carolina State University, where she ran Cross Country and Distance events in Track and Field both indoor and outdoor. Before she met her husband and had children, she competed in four marathons with a marathon personal record of 2:56.14. Children slowed down her running career, but she continued with a double stroller until 2016, when her running career halted. Now, after the birth of her fifth child, she is battling back from major health issues, including depression, and stepping back on to the treadmill to get in shape. She has her eyes on running the Bay Shore Marathon in the spring of 2019 and 5K’s and 10k’s locally, perhaps with her older children. She has been refueling with chocolate milk since she started running!\n\nJoe Packard\n\nJoe Packard lives in Manchester, MI with his wife Katelyn. He loves representing and promoting chocolate milk—the most nutritionally-rich recovery beverage out there! Joe graduated from Michigan State University with a Bachelor of Science degree in Animal Science. He works for a dairy cooperative as a field representative and milking system specialist, servicing about 60 farms across six counties in southeast Michigan. His wife manages their family’s dairy farm with her dad and grandpa. They milk about 400 cows, and farm 800 acres to feed them. Joe helps out on the farm on the weekends, but in his free time he enjoys running, hunting and relaxing on the lake just across the street from our farm. His favorite dairy product is chocolate milk and his favorite flavor of ice cream is Ben and Jerry’s Phish Food.\n\nJennifer Schrader\n\nJennifer Schrader is a web developer by day, mother and dairy farmer by night. She has been running regularly for several years. Her goal is to participate in one 5K a month, every month (even the awful wintery ones).

She and her husband own a dairy farm in St. Johns, MI, and pride themselves on raising the next generation of dairy farmers. They have three children, a son Jonathan and twin daughters, Michaela and Lillian.\n\nSandy Sellers\n\nSandy is a Youth Wellness and Sports Nutrition Manager and Registered Dietitian with Milk Means More who holds a bachelor’s degree in Dietetics from Michigan State University and a graduate certificate in Nutrition and Wellness from Bradley University.

Outside of work, Sandy enjoys spending time with her husband and two young daughters as well as running and practicing yoga.\n\nJaimie Strickland\n\nJaimie Strickland recently completed her veterinary residency and is now a Ph.D. candidate studying nutrition and immunology in dairy cows at Michigan State University. She enjoys teaching veterinary students, conducting research projects and working as a nutritional consultant for everything from Labrador retrievers to black rhinos. Jaimie runs not only to stay healthy, but also to relieve stress and to get lost (both metaphorically and sometimes literally) out on the trails. She recently completed a 50-mile ultra-marathon and hopes to one day complete a 100-mile race. She loves hanging out with her family and friends, exploring northern Michigan and playing with her two dogs, Bear and Thelma.\n\nMike Teske\n\nMike Teske is a force to be reckoned with. After being diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis in 2000, he decided he didn’t want it to dictate his life. So in 2009, Mike started to learn how to swim. Shortly after, in 2010, he finished his first sprint triathlon. In 2016 he completed IRONMAN Wisconsin while unknowingly having a football-sized cancerous tumor in his chest. It’s no wonder this IRONMAN was his proudest accomplishment! After being diagnosed with cancer, Mike still completed the Chicago Marathon, then went into a successful surgery in December of 2017. He followed this up with swimming the Straits of Mackinac in 2019, from Mackinac City to St, Ignace, and in 2021 swam the Mackinac Island Swim which is an 8.2 mile swim around Mackinac Island.\n\nDavid Queen\n\nSince David Queen started running in 2000, he’s run 15 marathons and two ultra marathons. The Ann Arbor-based athlete juggles running and his career as a quality manager at Nissan Technical Center North America. David, who’s a father of four, also coaches youth soccer. In the last year, he achieved a personal record on his 5k, and ran three marathons.\n\nJennifer Queen\n\nJennifer Queen is an Ann Arbor-based marketing communications consultant.

So passionate that in 1999 they moved to dairy-friendly Michigan from the Netherlands. When not working on the farm, Gertie loves to quilt, cook, eat and read. She started running a few years ago after having some heart problems. “When I started, I could not run from the back door to the mailbox,” Gertie says. “Now I try to run three times a week for three to five miles and a few races each year.
