        "text": "If you finally want to stick to a REALISTIC health routine you need to start with how YOU want to feel and then be clear on who you need to become. It’s the only way to make lasting change. (DON’T jump straight to the actions.. this is the biggest mistake people make!) For example, I want to feel energetic, healthy and confident. Cool! Who do I need to become to feel that way? Likely someone who prioritizes my physical and mental health. Someone who does “the work” to change my mindset and the F’S I give.. but I can’t become this person overnight!!!! Once you are clear with how you want to feel then you can ID small physical and mental shifts that you can build from. The first step is getting clear on what you can do, then building from there with realistic expectations and tools to work through the inevitable resistance to change. This is exactly what I help you do. But I also have a free tool to help you get started. If you would like my free tool comment “tool” below and I will send it to you! You’ve got this! It doesn’t have to be so hard! Get clear. Start small. Then build! Stop throwing too much on the pile too early. It’s a recipe for failure #commitment #motivation #healthylifestyle #selflove #selfgrowth #healthyconfidentyou #confidence #lifecoach #healthcoach #ottawalifecoach #womanpower #vibrant #weightlosstips #weightlosshacks #habitchange #habitshifts #habithack #healthyhabits #healthtips #inspiration #makeyourselfproud #healthtips #momlife #momlifebelike #habitchange #routine #dedication #ottawahealthcoach #fitnessmotivation\n\n𝑬𝒎𝒐𝒕𝒊𝒐𝒏𝒂𝒍 𝒊𝒏𝒗𝒆𝒔𝒕𝒎𝒆𝒏𝒕 𝒑𝒂𝒏𝒊 𝒎𝒆 𝒈𝒚𝒂, 𝒎𝒆𝒏𝒕𝒂𝒍 𝒉𝒆𝒂𝒍𝒕𝒉 𝑪𝑯𝑨𝑷𝑷𝑨𝑲𝑲𝑲 🐟 The idea that all emotional investments lead to disruptive #Mentalhealth isn't quite accurate. In fact, healthy emotional investments are essential for our #well-being. 𝐇𝐨𝐰𝐞𝐯𝐞𝐫, 𝐭𝐡𝐞𝐫𝐞 𝐚𝐫𝐞 𝐬𝐢𝐭𝐮𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧𝐬 𝐰𝐡𝐞𝐫𝐞 𝐞𝐦𝐨𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧𝐚𝐥 𝐢𝐧𝐯𝐞𝐬𝐭𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭 𝐜𝐚𝐧 𝐛𝐞𝐜𝐨𝐦𝐞 𝐮𝐧𝐡𝐞𝐚𝐥𝐭𝐡𝐲 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐜𝐨𝐧𝐭𝐫𝐢𝐛𝐮𝐭𝐞 𝐭𝐨 𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐚𝐥 𝐡𝐞𝐚𝐥𝐭𝐡 𝐬𝐭𝐫𝐮𝐠𝐠𝐥𝐞𝐬. 𝐇𝐞𝐫𝐞'𝐬 𝐰𝐡𝐲: 😶 ❌ 𝐔𝐧𝐫𝐞𝐚𝐥𝐢𝐬𝐭𝐢𝐜 𝐄𝐱𝐩𝐞𝐜𝐭𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧𝐬: When we invest heavily in someone, we might have high expectations of their #behaviour and the relationship. If these expectations aren't met, it can lead to disappointment, resentment, and emotional distress. ❌ 𝐋𝐨𝐬𝐬 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐑𝐞𝐣𝐞𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧: Life is full of change, and sometimes #relationships end. This can be incredibly painful, especially if we've been emotionally invested. The loss of a loved one, romantic partner, or even a close friend can trigger feelings of grief, loneliness, and #anxiety. ❌ 𝐂𝐨𝐝𝐞𝐩𝐞𝐧𝐝𝐞𝐧𝐜𝐲: In some cases, emotional #investment can morph into co-dependency, where our sense of self-worth becomes tied to the other person's approval. This unhealthy dynamic can lead to anxiety, low self-esteem, and difficulty functioning independently. 𝐇𝐞𝐫𝐞'𝐬 𝐡𝐨𝐰 𝐭𝐨 𝐜𝐮𝐥𝐭𝐢𝐯𝐚𝐭𝐞 𝐡𝐞𝐚𝐥𝐭𝐡𝐲 𝐞𝐦𝐨𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧𝐚𝐥 𝐢𝐧𝐯𝐞𝐬𝐭𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐬: 😊 ✅ 𝐒𝐞𝐭 𝐁𝐨𝐮𝐧𝐝𝐚𝐫𝐢𝐞𝐬: Having healthy boundaries allows you to maintain a sense of self and protects you from emotional manipulation. ✅ 𝐌𝐚𝐢𝐧𝐭𝐚𝐢𝐧 𝐈𝐧𝐝𝐞𝐩𝐞𝐧𝐝𝐞𝐧𝐜𝐞: Pursue your own interests and hobbies outside of your relationships. ✅ 𝐂𝐨𝐦𝐦𝐮𝐧𝐢𝐜𝐚𝐭𝐞 𝐄𝐟𝐟𝐞𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐯𝐞𝐥𝐲: Open and honest communication is essential for healthy relationships. ✅ 𝐀𝐜𝐜𝐞𝐩𝐭 𝐈𝐦𝐩𝐞𝐫𝐟𝐞𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧𝐬: No one is perfect, and neither are relationships. Learn to accept and appreciate people for who they are. ✅ 𝐏𝐫𝐚𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐜𝐞 𝐒𝐞𝐥𝐟-𝐂𝐚𝐫𝐞: Make time for activities that nourish your mind, body, and spirit. #mentalheath #peacefulmind #collegelearnings #lifelessons #peace #calm #growth #awareness #health\n\n🧠 𝙊𝙪𝙧 𝙢𝙞𝙣𝙙 𝙞𝙨 𝙤𝙪𝙧 𝙗𝙚𝙨𝙩𝙛𝙧𝙞𝙚𝙣𝙙… 𝙗𝙪𝙩 𝙞𝙩 𝙘𝙖𝙣 𝙗𝙚 𝙤𝙪𝙧 𝙬𝙤𝙧𝙨𝙩 𝙚𝙣𝙚𝙢𝙮….

As founders and business owners, our work is our passion. But without self-care, we can burn out. Here are some ways to preserve your mental health along the way: - Carve out dedicated non-negotiable time for activities and people that recharge you. - Set work boundaries and stick to them - learn to unplug at the end of the day. - Build a support network of fellow entrepreneurs who understand the ups and downs. - Practice mindfulness to manage stress in the moment when things get hectic. - Focus on the progress made rather than get bogged down in setbacks. - Get outdoors, exercise, eat well, and prioritize rest to boost resilience to stress. - If needed, seek professional help - there's no shame in therapy. Our businesses need us at our best. With intention, we can sustain our drive, passion, and mental wellbeing over the entrepreneurial marathon. #EntrepreneurStress #StartUpStress #FounderLife #FounderProblems #MentalHealthMatters #SelfCare #Resilience #StressManagement #Burnout #WorkLifeBalance #Mindfulness #Meditation #SupportSystem #AskForHelp #Therapy #ExecutiveCoaching #Leadership #EmotionalIntelligence #Wellness #PositivePsychology #CognitiveBehavioralTherapy #Anxiety #Depression #Loneliness #ImposterSyndrome #FailureMindset #Perfectionism #GoalSetting #TimeManagement #SelfCompassion #Exercise #Nutrition #SleepHygiene #CreativeOutlets #Journaling #Meditation #BreathingExercises #VCBetterTogether #StartupGrind #FoundersPledge #EntrepreneursOrganization #YPO #YEC #AmericanPsychologicalAssociation #ASA #ISMA #AFSP #NAMIC #ADAA #IAHPC\n\n\"Progress is progress, no matter how small\"✨ When you’re staring down a big task, it’s easy to feel paralyzed by the enormity of it all. The key to overcoming this overwhelm is to break the task into smaller, more manageable steps. By focusing on just the first step, you reduce the mental burden and build momentum. This method not only makes the task seem less intimidating but also taps into the power of small wins, boosting your confidence and productivity along the way. ------- Follow Dr Pooja Patel for holistic growth tips and guidance.
