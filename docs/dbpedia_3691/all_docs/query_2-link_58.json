        "text": "CEO of Moolah Kicks Natalie White visited South Brunswick, North Brunswick, and Hoggard to hand-deliver the new swag\n\nWILMINGTON, N.C. (WWAY) – Three of our local high school girl’s basketball teams got new gear before the season begins officially on Friday.\n\n“The movement Moolah Kicks started is so important of course it’s about the shoes performing and elevating your game on the court as a female baller in shoes that are fit for your feet,” said Moolah Kicks CEO Natalie White. “We have a brand whose sole mission and purpose is to elevate and hype woman’s basketball at every level.”\n\nMoolah Kicks started in 2020. And has taken the sports apparel world by storm. It is branded as basketball shoes, by women, for women. On their website, they highlight the specific sneaker creation process, and how a slimmer built, lifted arch, and other unique features make the shoe different than its counterparts.\n\nThe girls from South Brunswick, North Brunswick, and Hoggard – sponsored by local businesses – will be rocking the brand-new apparel this upcoming season. As happy as the ballplayers are for the free swag, they say it was pretty cool to meet a woman trailblazing in an industry that is often represented by men.\n\n“It inspires because she shows that you can rise above easily,” said Mariyah Bell of North Brunswick. “You just have to find a problem then find a solution.”\n\n“I think her confidence was amazing to see because a lot of women in this sports field made for men, I think it was really good to see her so confident,” said Rachel Wehlage of South Brunswick. “Because I know a lot of women in this sports realm don’t get their voices heard.:\n\n“This was very special sports are very big at Hoggard,” said Sarah Elgart of Hoggard. “We felt it was important there was something made just for us we are a really good team and sometimes I don’t think it’s recognized.”\n\nWhite says the girls having those kinds of realizations, and being able to have conversations with them about it, are what made Monday so special.\n\n“That’s what it’s about … Seeing girls and female athletes learn for the first time not only is there a shoe fit for them, but a brand dedicated to elevating their game… It’s game changing for the sport, and for them. To invite everyone to be a part of it means the world. Coming here having the girls’ basketball teams rocking moolah kicks this season is a local piece of this national movement that we’ve started. We are no longer comparing ourselves to men’s basketball as female athletes rather we are carving out our own lane and showing everyone the hype the talent that we know is here in women’s basketball.”"
