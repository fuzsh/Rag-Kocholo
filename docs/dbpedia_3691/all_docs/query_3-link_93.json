        "text": "A splendorous October afternoon blessed the “delightful high rolling country,” the Red Hills of Florida. For days, opposing sides hyped the game to a feverish pitch. Players drank hyper-caffeinated beverages to maintain a buzz. Spectators lined the bloodied field, screaming for divine intervention. Upon the game’s conclusion, contestants and spectators sang lustily and performed a “mad dance.” An observer recorded, “All ended in perfect harmony.”\n\nIt was October 1823. The location was “the new Tallahassee village,” a settlement of the Seminoles led by Chief Neamathla. The players were young Native American men and women participating in an ancient ritual described that day by Dr. W.H. Simmons and John Lee Williams, a St. Augustine physician and Pensacola lawyer who had been appointed to a commission to select the seat of government for the new Florida Territory. Simmons and Williams were neither the first nor last to be bewitched by the spectacle of a ballgame.\n\nFlorida’s Apalachee loved games of passion and rivalry. In 1676, Friar Juan de Paiva served at San Luis de Talimali, a Spanish mission located in the heavily populated Apalachee country overlooking present-day Tallahassee. The Franciscan friars left extensive accounts of “el juego de la pelota,” the native game of ball, including a drawing of a goalpost, a pole resembling a Christmas tree topped by an eagle’s nest. Apalachee contestants attempted to kick the buckskin-covered pelota (ball) against the goalpost and score 1 point. A player who kicked the ball into the eagle’s nest received 2 points. The first team to score 11 points was victorious. Not everyone approved. A Spanish bishop characterized the game as “barbaric and bestial,” pleading for its abolition. “And they fall upon one another at full tilt,” he lamented, adding, “when the pile is broken up, four or five are lifeless, others have their eyes gouged out, and many arms and legs are broken.”\n\nTallahassee remains the site of games, political and athletic, played full of sound and fury, signifying everything.\n\nFootball has long aroused primal needs in Floridians, fostering a passion and intensity unequaled in any enterprise short of love, war and religious revivals. The game traces its roots to prestigious Northern universities in the late 19th century. One of the earliest descriptions of football in Florida dates back to 1898, as U.S. troops camped in Tampa preparing for an invasion of Cuba. The Rough Riders, a cavalry unit organized by Theodore Roosevelt, included volunteers who had played collegiate football. In one game, a cowboy insisted on playing with his spurs on!\n\nThe popularity of football swept the Sunshine State. The game fostered regional and local pride while accepting Yankee coaches. It appealed to the rural masses while filling city bleachers.\n\nIn October 1906, the University of Florida played its first game as a club sport, facing the Rollins Tars from Winter Park. The game spread quickly across the Mason-Dixon Line. A Manatee County legislator, alarmed at the game’s violence, introduced a bill in 1903 to outlaw the “playing of the game known as football.” Legislators hissed, scowled and rejected the idea.\n\nFootball appealed to values Floridians cherished: a reverence for tradition and spectacle with a jolt of competition and violence. Winning coaches became icons. Southerners may have been woefully poor, but the gridiron allowed citizens to escape reality, at least on Friday nights and Saturday afternoons.\n\nThe Gators may have captured the hearts of Floridians but won few games for the first half century of play. The team achieved only one winning season in the 1940s; in 1946, the squad finished 0-9. The deplorable state of UF football flared as an issue in the 1944 and 1948 gubernatorial campaigns. Winning candidates Millard Fillmore Caldwell (who played guard at the University of Mississippi) and Fuller Warren (who was elected at the age of 21 to the Florida Legislature as a UF undergraduate) both promised championship teams, if elected. In 1950, the University of Florida’s coach, Bob Woodruff, was paid $12,000, making him the state’s highest-paid employee.\n\nFlorida State University emerged from the cocoon of Florida State College for Women in 1947, organizing a fledgling football squad. The University of Florida, citing state law and an even higher authority, opposed the formation of a team in Tallahassee. FSU won the fight and adopted a new nickname: the Seminoles. Other suggestions included Rebels, Tarpons and Crackers. The Seminole Tribe and FSU have a symbiotic relationship over name and imagery rights. The tradition of Chief Osceola charging across the field on his Appaloosa horse named Renegade began in the 1970s.\n\nFSU’s trajectory was as unpredictable as it was stunning. The Seminoles’ 1949 team earned an invitation to Tampa’s Cigar Bowl, where its team defeated Wofford College. FSU’s coach, Don Veller, earned a salary of $7,500.\n\nIn 1950, the University of Miami was the state’s best football team, finishing 9-0-1 and earning a trip across town to the Orange Bowl. When UM first started playing football in 1926, its first opponent was the University of Havana! On Sept. 25, 1926, construction crews began work on an 8,000-seat stadium. Alas, a hurricane wrecked the city two days later, pricking the real estate boom but inspiring the team with a perfect nickname: the Hurricanes.\n\nIn 1954, the UF athletic director informed his counterpart that the Gators would never schedule the Seminoles in football. But state legislators — and remember this was the era of the Porkchop Gang, who favored rural North Florida over fast-growing South Florida — realized the significance of the fight. Ultimately, the State Board of Control, not the Legislature, ordered UF to play FSU. The first match took place Nov. 22, 1958, and the unbridled rivalry has only intensified.\n\nFriday Night Lights\n\nFootball captivated Floridians. From the Perdido River to the Saint Marys River, from Key Biscayne to Key West, Floridians cheered the Apopka Blue Darters, the Chattahoochee Mighty Yellow Jackets, the Key West Conchs, the Lake Wales Highlanders, the Lakeland Dreadnaughts, the Largo Packers, the Lemon Bay Mantas, the Pompano Beach Bean Pickers, the Seabreeze Fighting Sandcrabs and the Tarpon Springs Spongers. In Dade County, Jackson, Miami and Edison high schools played their home games at the Orange Bowl. A 1965 game between the Miami High Stingarees and Coral Gables Cavaliers drew 48,631 fans. Football intensified rivalries between towns and within cities.\n\nJ. Earle Bowden grew up in Altha, writing about the meaning of football in small Panhandle towns: “Giggly girls giggle. Mammas hold back tearful joy. Papa stands strong and proud. It’s Friday night. Hear the big drum roll; tom-toms beat for a noisy crowd bathed in hot lights on chilly Florida nights.”\n\nNowhere in Florida has sports transformed lives more than the communities lining the southern shores of Lake Okeechobee, where the cultivation of Big Sugar and winter vegetables attracted large numbers of desperate African American and Caribbean workers. Tradition holds that young boys from Muck Cities learned to run fast and hard because of a local ritual. Before the ripe sugarcane is harvested, workers ignite fields to burn away leaves and debris. Fires also ignite waves of marsh rabbits fleeing, only to be run down and clubbed by young boys. “It’s not that they chase rabbits,” explained an observer. “It’s that they find it necessary to chase rabbits.”\n\nIn 2001, seven Glades High graduates played in the National Football League, more than any other high school in America. The numbers rose to 31 in 2013. Unlike football powerhouses such as St. Thomas Aquinas in Fort Lauderdale, Belle Glade Central has no booster club or luxurious locker room. Each fall when the Belle Glades Raiders meet the Pahokee Blue Devils, 10,000 fans cheer wildly.\n\nIn a society where neighborhood-owned stores have been eclipsed by Amazon and Walmart, the ultimate high school may be IMG Academy (International Management Group), a private for-profit prep boarding school in Bradenton. IMG has been astoundingly successful as an athletic prep school, a springboard to college and professional careers in football, basketball and tennis. A Swedish private equity firm recently purchased IMG for $1.25 billion. Tuition and room for 2023-24 top $89,000, the same price tag as Harvard.\n\nFew professions offer more pressure and fame than high school football coaches. J. Crockett Farnell coached football at Hillsborough High in Tampa, winning four state championships in the 1940s. Farnell leaped from the gridiron to the superintendent’s office.\n\nThe history of Florida football includes some extraordinary role models and heroes. Born in Live Oak, Arthur E. Woodward played for a Florida A&M team that won the Black national championship in 1949. He coached at DeFuniak Springs’ Tivoli High football teams to five undefeated seasons. Letters arrived addressed simply, “The Colored Football Coach.”\n\nAnother icon, Earl Kitchings, coached the 1958 Matthew Gilbert High School Panthers. His Jacksonville team featured Bob Hayes, who became the only person to win an Olympic gold medal and an NFL championship ring. “We did not have any field at all at Gilbert High,” recalled Kitchings. He became Jacksonville Raines High School’s first coach in 1965, mentoring future greats Harrold Carmichael and Ken Burrough. The stadium bears his name today.\n\nRace\n\nRacial segregation united, divided and defined Floridians and Florida football. For decades, Florida colleges scheduled only Southern opponents, refusing to play Northern teams with Black players. In the 1940s, the University of Miami canceled games against Penn State and a UCLA team that included Jackie Robinson. Not until 1962 did UF admit Black students.\n\nIn the 1962 Gator Bowl in Jacksonville, the all-white Gators played Penn State’s integrated squad. When asked about the importance of the game, Florida Coach Red Graves emphasized, “We sort of feel we’re upholding the honor of Southern football.” Ninety minutes before game time, bands blared “Dixie.” Gators helmets were emblazoned with Confederate flag decals.\n\nUnder legal segregation, no white Florida college team came close to winning a national championship. Yet few whites were even aware that a football powerhouse existed in Florida. Alonzo “Jake” Gaither, who coached at the historically Black Florida A&M University, turned racism to his advantage. Football recruits received a letter, simple in its eloquence: “You are invited to attend Florida A&M University.” When Bob Hayes, who graduated from his Jacksonville high school and went to FAMU, was on trial for cocaine possession in 1979, Gaither sat in the courtroom. After the coach’s death, a tearful Hayes said, “That man was my father, my friend and my mentor.”\n\nPigskin’s golden age\n\nFor all the hoopla, the state of college football in Florida from 1950 to 1980 ranged from bad to mediocre, only occasionally rising to high caliber. In 1980, UM’s football fortunes had plunged so low that its trustees considered pulling the plug on the program. UF had never won an SEC championship, and FSU faced an uphill battle against “the Boys from Old Florida.”\n\nWhen Howard Schnellenberger took over UM’s foundering program in 1979, he brashly proclaimed that Dade, Broward and Palm Beach counties were now officially “The State of Miami.” During the next four decades, dynamic new coaches across the state attracted extraordinary homegrown talent. The arrival of Schnellenberger, Bobby Bowden (FSU), Jimmy Johnson (UM), Butch Davis (UM), Steve Spurrier (UF), Urban Meyer (UF) and Jimbo Fisher (FSU) elevated Florida football into the stratosphere of national conversation and championships.\n\nWinning 11 different national championships by three different teams, Bowden, Spurrier, Meyer and Fisher became coaching icons. The ascendancy of Florida football paralleled the rise of the Sunbelt. In 1940, Florida was the smallest state in the South. But between 1970 and 2010, its population exploded from 6.8 million to 19 million, while the Rust Belt struggled. Florida, Texas and California became a hotbed of high school football talent.\n\nNowhere was the scene more electric than the University of Miami, soon known simply as “The U.” The Hurricanes came of age in the ‘80s, winning a national championship against Nebraska in 1983. In a 10-year span, 1985-1994, “The U” won two national championships, twice compiling perfect seasons. The 2001 squad produced a record 38 NFL draft picks.\n\nFootball dynasties rise and fall. There may never be another athlete-coach like Spurrier. A journalist acknowledged his charisma: “Blindfolded, with his back to the wall, with his hands tied behind him, Steve Spurrier would still be a two-point favorite at his own execution.” A Heisman-winning quarterback at UF, Spurrier returned to his alma mater as head coach in 1990. The Gators won the SEC championship in 1991, followed by four consecutive titles beginning in 1993, culminating with the school’s first national championship in 1996.\n\nEven sweeter, the Gators defeated the Seminoles in that championship game. “Coach” became the punch line in a joke: “The definition of an atheist is someone who doesn’t believe in Steve Spurrier.” His replacement, the focused, driven Urban Meyer, whose mother named him after a pope, was a master recruiter, bringing to Gainesville the charismatic Tim Tebow.\n\nFSU struggled in its first four decades of collegiate football. The breakout occurred in 1976 with the hiring of an obscure coach, Bobby Bowden. His greatest success occurred when FSU was admitted into the Atlantic Coast Conference in 1992. The Seminoles proceeded to win the 1993 and 1999 national championships. Spurrier never defeated Bowden in Tallahassee. Remarkably, every single game between Bowden and Spurrier featured two teams ranked in the Top 10.\n\nMoney matters\n\nPigskin hoopla and moolah left accountants as well as fans in a rarefied firmament. In 1994, television executive Don Ohlmeyer Jr. said famously, “In sports, money is the answer to all your questions.” The coffers of college football bulge with cash. In 2022, the UF athletic budget had swollen to $164 million and brought in $190 million in revenue. The Gators dedicated the Heavener Football Training Center, an $85 million football complex. In 2009, the SEC signed a $3 billion television deal. To place these numbers in perspective, consider that in 1963, CBS paid $10.2 million for the right to broadcast NCAA football games.\n\nIn 1945, UF’s football coach earned $6,000. In 2021, the school’s new head coach signed a seven-year salary averaging $7.4 million a year. Paralleling the spiraling salaries are the escalating amounts athletic directors spend on support staffs. Coach Billy Napier’s three Gators football coordinators each earn a million dollars annually. The strength and conditioning coach makes $750,000. Administrators understand the risks just as the gambler Tea Cake did in Zora Neale Hurston’s “Their Eyes Were Watching God,” when he observed, “This ain’t no game fuh pennies. Po’ man ain’t got no business at de show.”\n\nA new development threatens to topple the existing order. Universities may now pay athletes for their NIL — name, image and likeness. Other troubling clouds hang over football. The sport cannot escape the now obvious health risks, most seriously traumatic brain injuries.\n\nStill, for legions of Floridians, few sounds and scenes offer more comfort and hope than the thump of a football being kicked off amid the chants of cheerleaders and screams of fans."
