        "text": "By Jan J Binney\n\nThe members of Exchange Club of Indian River are hard at work planning the 36th Annual Blue Water Open Dolphin Mania Charity Fishing Tournament. The Treasure Coast-wide dolphin-only tournament, sponsored by Exchange Club of Indian River Foundation, will be held the weekend of May 19 out of the Fort Pierce City Marina. First prize for the largest dolphin weighed in is $5,000, second prize is $2,000, and third prize is $1,000. Five \"Bounty Booty Winners\" will receive $400 each.\n\nThe mandatory Captains' Meeting will be held Friday, May 18, from 6 p.m. to 7:30 p.m. at the marina's bleachers. The tournament starts at 6:30 am the next morning; all entered fish must be weighed in no later than 4:30 p.m. The weather date is Sunday, May 20.\n\nThe entry fee for this year's Dolphin Mania is $250 ($200 before May 10); to enter the optional Mahi Moolah is an additional $100. For convenience, anglers register and pay to enter the tournament at http://www.bluewateropen.org; they may also enter by mail or on the night of the captains' meeting. If fewer than 60 boats enter, the prize money will be prorated.\n\nAll the proceeds -? 100 percent -- of this popular tournament benefit local projects for the prevention of child abuse in the local community, according to John Binkley, tournament chair. The needs of many children are overwhelming, especially at this time of economic stress. Although child abuse is a significant and increasing problem on the Treasure Coast, it can be prevented. Please join the Foundation in the fight against child abuse and neglect.\n\nIt's not too late to consider becoming a sponsor of the Blue Water Open. Cash donations in any amount and gifts of door prizes, raffle items, coupons, and gift certificates are.\n\nEarly sponsors include Charles Perry Partners, Inc. (CPPI), Jeff Smith for Clerk of Court (political advertisement paid for and approved by Jeffrey R. Smith, Republican for Clerk of the Circuit Court and Comptroller), Wal-Mart Distribution Center #7038, Bernard Egan Foundation, Donadio & Associates, and Warren Lewis and Scott Wallace of Wells Fargo Advisors. Additional sponsors include Ace Diesel Marine, Armfield-Wagner, Inc., Central Window, C. Pickel Studio, Inc., DeBrooks Fishing Corner, Edlund-Dritenbas-Binkley Architects, Gold Coast Landscape Lighting, Marllyn Justice CPA, New Perspectives, Riverfront Groves, Robert and Jenny Poore, Rossway Moore Taylor and Swan, Sunshine Furniture, Structure-Con, The Corrie Family, The Ostrom Group, and Kmetz, Nuttall, Elwell, Graham, PLLC (KNEG).\n\nThe Press Journal is the tournament's media sponsor. Other major in-kind sponsors include Fort Pierce City Marina, Clear Channel Radio, and Idea Garden Advertising & Production House."
