        "text": "RESERVE YOUR SPOT\n\nWhat Is It Like To Attend The Sellers Summit?\n\nRESERVE YOUR SPOT\n\nDiscover What Actually Works For Your Business\n\nMost people leave a typical business conference with a bunch of marketing strategies and theories. But when they try to implement these theories on their own later on, they fail. Why?\n\nIt's because most marketing gurus teach the theory and not the facts. The truth is that marketing \"theory\" doesn't always translate to sales and every business is going to react differently depending on the strategy\n\nBecause the Sellers Summit is a \"workshop\" based event, you will have the opportunity to test all of the strategies you learn and ask questions DURING the conference itself\n\nThis is possible because we purposely keeping the event small and intimate to facilitate a small group learning environment and the speakers are here to help you out.\n\nPicture yourself working on your business in real time with an expert sitting at the same table as you.\n\nIt's the best way to learn.\n\nRESERVE YOUR SPOT\n\nWho This Event Is For\n\nIn order to accommodate all types of sellers, the event will be divided into 2 main tracks that cover both Amazon and running your own branded store.\n\nIn today's competitive ecommerce landscape, it is crucial to establish your own brand and sell on Amazon as well as on a platform that you control.\n\nIf you are looking to grow your Amazon business...\n\nYou will leave the Sellers Summit with a clear cut strategy to increase your sales. You will also come away with strategies to boost your Amazon rankings, increase your conversion rates and drive external traffic to your products.\n\nYou'll also come away with exclusive strategies the pros are using to grow their brands.\n\nIf you are looking to grow your own branded ecommerce website...\n\nYou will learn techniques to take your business to the next level whether it be through creating sales funnels, SEO, social media, PPC advertising, conversion optimization, email marketing or copywriting.\n\nYou will have the chance to see how other experienced sellers are executing their sales campaigns and improve upon your own.\n\nAnd most importantly, you will have the opportunity to hang out with me and my colleagues and let us teach you everything we know about ecommerce\n\nIn addition, we're also offering a special private mastermind for experienced sellers making at least $250,000 or $1,000,000 in revenues.\n\nRESERVE YOUR SPOT\n\nIf You Make Over $250K Or Over $1M Selling Online\n\nThe first day of the Sellers Summit is reserved for a special mastermind meeting composed of sellers making at least $100,000 in profit or $250,000 in revenues and have been selling for at least one year.\n\nOn this special day, you will focus on breaking through current limitations or struggles in your \"own business\", while forging relationships with other highly successful ecommerce entrepreneurs who have walked or are currently walking in your shoes.\n\nPlease Note: There are 2 tiers of mastermind groups, one for sellers making over $250k and the other for sellers making over $1M. Please choose the appropriate group upon signup. Income will be verified.\n\nThis will be a hands-on event with only twelve attendees in each Mastermind group. Each participant will come away with brand new insights about their business from another entrepreneur's perspective.\n\nIn short, this first day could be the most valuable day of the conference...\n\nIf you like the idea of spending a full day with other enthusiastic, growth-oriented entrepreneurs and working \"on\" your business rather than \"in\" your business...\n\nIf you appreciate the benefits of stepping away and bonding with other ecommerce entrepreneurs in a highly productive environment\n\nIf you see the value of getting another pair of eyes on your business to find new ways to grow and expand\n\nHow The Ecommerce Mastermind Will Be Structured\n\nThe mastermind day will be divided into two sections.\n\nFirst, each participant will be given 5 minutes to share the specific details behind something that is working really well in their business.\n\nEven though we are all successful, there are always strategies that are being employed that you may have no idea about.\n\nFor example, I took part in recent mastermind that influenced me to redesign my entire ecommerce store. As a result, my conversion rates have increased over 46%.\n\nSecond, each participant will participate in a \"hot seat\" where the other members of the group will give specific feedback and suggestions for how you can break through your current challenge.\n\nYou will come away with new insights, clarity, and lifelong relationships with the other speakers at the event - all of whom are going through, or have gone through, the challenges you are experiencing.\n\nYou will have a new group of friends on your speed dial who you can depend on to help you as you continue to grow your ecommerce business.\n\nRESERVE YOUR SPOT\n\nTired Of Being Owned By Amazon? Join Our Content Mastermind\n\nAre you looking to leverage content marketing to grow your business? Does email marketing, video, SEO, and social media give you anxiety? Are you looking to create a brand outside of Amazon?\n\nJoin our Content Mastermind for one day of brainstorming, hands-on activities, and strategic tactics to help improve your content strategies.\n\nYou'll be masterminding with other creators and brand experts to learn how to rise above your competitors with unique content, SEO strategies that work, and alternative income strategies to help diversify your revenue and create a lasting brand with a loyal following.\n\nThis will be a small hands-on event with limited ticket sales. Each participant will come away with brand new insights about how to build an audience to break free of Amazon and generate FREE traffic for your own website with content.\n\nThe Content Mastermind could be the most valuable day of the conference...\n\nIf you want to break free of Amazon's grasp and stop depending Jeff Bezos for your paycheck.\n\nIf you want to learn how to generate FREE traffic through SEO, social media and video.\n\nIf you see the value of building a lasting brand with an audience of loyal customers.\n\nRESERVE YOUR SPOT\n\nWork During The Day. Play Hard At Night!\n\nWhile the Sellers Summit is definitely about working hard and learning, it’s also about networking and having fun.\n\nThis year's hotel has a beautiful view of the water and there are plenty of restaurants/bars within walking distance. The weather is always great this time of year and you can take a break to relax anytime.\n\nWe'll have parties every night starting the day before the summit, and you will not want to miss any of them. Just imagine your favorite ecommerce entrepreneurs hanging out all in one place. It’s an opportunity unlike any other, and it’s your chance to mingle and start making things happen.\n\nBecause let's face it. When it comes to business, it’s not just what you know, it's also who you know. And the best way to meet other successful entrepreneurs is in a casual, fun environment where you can strike up a conversation with an ecommerce millionaire, a conversion expert, an Amazon guru or an A-level copywriter.\n\nWho knows? You might even meet your next business partner. For me personally, I've met every single one of my business partners at various conferences I've attended in the past.\n\nYou'll make connections you never thought were possible, and you'll get both by the end of day 1.\n\nRESERVE YOUR SPOT"
