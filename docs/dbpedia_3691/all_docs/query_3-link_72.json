        "text": "It was the best of times, it was the worst of times. You wore low slung jeans, 'shipped Britney Spears and Justin Timberlake as a couple, and watched way too much television. So no wonder there are so many early '00s shows you've already forgotten about — you no longer have the same amount of spare time to fill with programs from Disney Channel, Nickelodeon, and Cartoon Network. No, now you devote your whole life to Netflix instead.\n\nBut prior to the Golden Age of Television, there was something much more fun and much less worthy. Of course, that would be the programming options of the '00s. Schedules were packed with reality TV shows, un-ironic cartoons, and the Olsen twins. Sure, sometimes television was tasteless and kitschy, but it was never boring.\n\nSo if you've got a spare weekend, get ready to do a deep-dive back into the decade that nobody seems to be as nostalgic for as the '90s. A decade when pop stars ruled our reality TV programming, teenagers on TV were never just teenagers (instead, they were robots or aliens or aspiring actors/singers), and an average town could be haunted by a thing called \"The Weirdness.\" Enjoy the trip down memory lane."
