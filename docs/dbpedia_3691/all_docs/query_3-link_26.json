        "text": "Fox Family Channel -- which will conclude the run of its teen reality game\n\nshow, Moolah Beach, on Saturdays -- is poised to launch a pair of new\n\nanimated daytime series on that day starting next month.\n\nTotally Spies and Da Mob are slated to bow Nov. 3 at 9:30 a.m. and\n\n12:30 p.m., respectively.\n\nFeaturing the voice of Jamie Kennedy (Scream, Boiler Room),\n\nDa Mob follows Cornelius 'Rooster' Byron as the leader of an ill-fated\n\nband whose attempts to find hip-hop stardom go awry. The series melds\n\ntraditional cell animation with realistic, three-dimensional models as\n\nbackgrounds, Fox Family said.\n\nTotally Spies tracks the exploits of Clover, Alex and Sam, three teens\n\nfrom Beverly Hills who love to shop, talk about boys and save the world as\n\nsecret agents employed by WOOHP (World Organization of Human Protection).\n\nMeanwhile, Moolah Beach -- the reality game show that has played well\n\nwith teens and tweens -- will end its six-episode original run Oct. 13 at\n\nnoon.\n\nThe one-hour program -- a half-hour version of which appears on Fox Kids\n\nNetwork -- began its run Sept. 8 with a half-dozen co-ed teams that were culled\n\nfrom an open contestant call. The squads competed in various stunts and missions\n\nagainst a Hawaiian backdrop.\n\nOn Oct. 13, the final two-person teams will vie for a $25,000 prize housed\n\nwithin a Hawaiian idol.\n\nMoolah Beach has performed well for Fox Family in its time slot. The Oct.\n\n6 show scored a 2.4 rating among teens 12 through 17, a 4.4 with girls 12\n\nthrough 17, a 2.6 among tweens nine through 14 and a 3.8 among girls of that\n\nyounger set within Fox Family's universe, according to Nielsen Media\n\nResearch."
