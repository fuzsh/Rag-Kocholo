        "text": "LOS ANGELES (thefutoncritic.com) -- In recent years the summer months have evolved from being a dumping ground for dead projects and unaired episodes (don't worry there's still plenty of that to go around), as with the success of everything from \"Survivor\" to \"The O.C.\" during the period, the networks have begun to take the June to August stretch much more seriously.\n\nSo in an effort to help navigate the increasingly complicated summer waters, we've compiled a list of everything you can expect to see during the period: from comedies to dramas to reality series to original movies and mini-series.\n\nWith that in mind, here's a breakdown of all the unscripted projects set to launch this summer (all descriptions are taken from each network's respective press materials where available):\n\nJUNE 2004\n\nQUEER EYE FOR THE STRAIGHT GUY: SEASON TWO (Bravo)\n\nPremieres: Tuesday, June 1 (10:00 - 11:00 PM ET/PT)\n\nThey call themselves the Fab Five. They are: An interior designer, a fashion stylist, a chef, a beauty guru and someone we like to call the �concierge of cool� - who is responsible for all things hip, including music and pop culture. All five are talented, they�re gay and they�re determined to clue in the cluttered, clumsy straight men of the world. With help from family and friends, the Fab Five treat each new guy as a head-to-toe project. Soon, the straight man is educated on everything from hair products to Prada and Feng Shui to foreign films. At the end of every fashion-packed, fun-filled lifestyle makeover, a freshly scrubbed, newly enlightened guy emerges - complete with that �new man� smell!\n\nTHE ULTIMATE LOVE TEST (ABC)\n\nPremieres: Wednesday, June 2 (10:00 - 11:00 PM ET/PT)\n\nThis compelling new reality series follows four couples on the most dramatic, emotional journey of their lives. After years of dating, each couple has found themselves at a crossroads in their relationship. They're fully committed, but a hint of doubt still lingers�is this the right person? Are they ready for marriage? Is love enough? The Ultimate Love Test gives each couple the opportunity to test their love and find answers to these difficult questions. After agreeing to take \"the test,\" the couples are separated. One of them stays home while the other is sent to a spectacular resort in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico where they are met by a person (or people) who represents everything they feel is lacking in their current partner. When faced with this option, will they choose to return to the one they love, or to pursue another dream? It is the ultimate test of real vs. ideal, and the results are life-changing.\n\nTHE FIRST 48 (A&E)\n\nPremieres: Thursday, June 3 (10:00 - 11:00 PM ET/PT)\n\nMore like TV drama than a reality show, THE FIRST 48 follows real-life homicide investigators as they race against time to solve their cases. The hour-long program follows detectives of Philadelphia's homicide team as they track a breaking case -- each with a running 48-hour clock. A fast-paced, gritty program that will keep audiences guessing to the end. Nancy Dubuc is Executive Producer and Laura Fleury is Supervising Producer for A&E Network. THE FIRST 48 is produced for A&E Network by Granada Television.\n\nFOR LOVE OR MONEY: SEASON THREE (NBC)\n\nPremieres: Monday, June 7 (9:00 - 11:00 PM ET/PT)\n\nRegularly Airs: Mondays (9:00 - 10:00 PM ET/PT)\n\nThis series - last summer's hottest unscripted drama -- returns for a third edition and again centers on 15 beautiful women who will compete for the affections of one lucky man. Jordan Murphy (\"Boston Public\") hosts the 12-episode series, guiding the contestants through numerous twists and turns as they try to win the heart of a handsome and charming entrepreneur. The upcoming season of \"For Love or Money\" breaks new ground by introducing an all-new game and a whole new twist. And this time, the price of love is even greater. But no matter how different the game may be, we're back to that very same question - Who is in it for Love...and who is in it for Money? \"For Love or Money\" is a production of Nash Entertainment & 3 Ball Productions. Bruce Nash (NBC's \"Meet My Folks,\" \"Mr. Personality\") is the executive producer, along with J.D. Roth (\"Endurance,\" \"Moolah Beach\"), Todd Nelson (\"Endurance,\" \"Moolah Beach\") and John Foy (\"The Martin Short Show\").\n\nROAD RULES: SEASON 13 (MTV)\n\nPremieres: Monday, June 7 (10:00 - 10:30 PM ET/PT)\n\nThe veteran reality series returns for its 13th edition, this time subtitled \"Xtreme.\"\n\nBLOW OUT (Bravo)\n\nPremieres: Tuesday, June 8 (9:00 - 10:00 PM ET/PT)\n\nFrom the creators of NBC's series \"The Restaurant\" comes \"Blow Out,\" an unscripted series that follows renowned hairstylist Jonathan Antin on his quest to establish a new salon in chic Beverly Hills and become a prominent player in an already incredibly competitive marketplace. As a teenager, Antin was inspired to become a stylist by Warren Beatty's role as the sexy, lady-loving George Roundy in the hit film \"Shampoo.\" He dropped out of Beverly Hills High to enroll in the Fairfax Beauty Academy, where he quickly landed a job at a trendy Melrose salon. Like Beatty's character, Antin's smoldering good looks and charisma, combined with his unique fashion sense proved irresistible. Within a few years, he claimed the Melrose salon as his own -- garnering a list of celebrity clientele rivaling the best in the business. \"Blow Out\" will follow Antin as he embarks on his lifelong dream of unveiling Jonathan Salon in Beverly Hills and establishing a new business catering to the upper echelons of an international beauty clientele. Financed with his savings, the move could make or break Antin, and viewers will share in his thrills and disappointments as he endures to make his vision a reality. Also featured in the series is Antin's assistant/prot�g� and handpicked team of talented stylists, colorists and make up artists -- all young, trendy, and hungry to make their impact on the beauty world. Each is a reflection of Antin and his business. Crucial to the success of the salon will be how they work together as well as the business they bring in -- and the stakes couldn't be higher. Given the pressures and personalities, Antin's longstanding policy that the only attitude allowed in the salon is his own, as it's his name on the door, will be put to the test. Combined with Antin's celebrity and well-heeled clients, \"Blow Out\" will offer a never before seen look at the demands of operating a Beverly Hills beauty salon. For the series, producers have once again partnered to create gripping television financed by exclusive advertising sponsorship packages modeled after those created and used in \"The Restaurant.\" The sponsors for \"Blow Out\" are American Express, Revlon, and LensCrafters. \"Blow Out\" is produced for Bravo by Reveille LLC, Magna Global Entertainment, and Shapiro/Grodner Productions.\n\nLAST COMIC STANDING: SEASON TWO (NBC)\n\nCasting Specials: Tuesday, June 8 (8:00 - 10:00 PM ET/PT); Wednesday, June 9 (8:00 - 10:00 PM ET/PT)\n\nPremieres: Tuesday, June 15 (9:00 - 10:00 PM ET/PT)\n\n\"Last Comic Standing\" is hosted and executive produced by actor/comedian Jay Mohr (\"Jerry Maguire\"). In its second season, the series will again provide a new spin on reality television as it features the nationwide talent search for professional and non-professional comedians (both male and female). Once the selection process is narrowed to 10, after the final rounds of the national search held in New York and Las Vegas, the program will then follow the comedians as they live together in a house and compete for the ultimate prize-an exclusive talent contract with NBC. Last summer, 8.3 million viewers tuned-in weekly to watch the summer series \"Last Comic Standing\" as thousands of aspiring and professional comedians attempted to earn the title \"Last Comic Standing.\" In the end, Dat Phan was voted by America to be the \"Last Comic Standing.\" Since he won, Phan has become the headlining act at comedy clubs nationwide and recently made his acting debut. This year, veteran producers Dan Cutforth and Jane Lipsitz of Magical Elves have joined the show as executive producers. Cutforth and Lipsitz's credits include the second season of \"Project Greenlight\" and Bravo's upcoming series \"Project Runway.\" \"Last Comic Standing\" is a Peter Engel Productions in association with Giraffe Productions and NBC Studios. Peter Engel, Barry Katz, Jay Mohr, Dan Cutforth and Jane Lipsitz serve as executive producers.\n\nCRIME & PUNISHMENT: SEASON THREE\n\nPremieres: Saturday, June 12 (10:00 - 11:00 PM ET/PT)\n\nFrom Dick Wolf, creator and executive producer of NBC�s powerhouse �Law & Order� franchise, and Bill Guttentag, 2003 Oscar winner for the documentary �Twin Towers,� (an honor he shares with the producing team at Wolf Films) comes �Crime & Punishment,� an hour-long unscripted drama series that offers viewers a look at prosecutors in the San Diego County District Attorney�s office as they prepare for and try cases.\n\nSCREAM PLAY (E!)\n\nPremieres: Sunday, June 13 (8:00 - 9:00 PM ET/PT)\n\nA one-hour competition series in which teams recreate memorable stunts and scenes from the movies and TV.\n\nTHE CASINO (FOX)\n\nPremieres: Monday, June 14 (9:00 - 10:00 PM ET/PT)\n\nA new unscripted series created and executive-produced by reality titan MARK BURNETT (\"The Apprentice,\" \"Survivor\"), THE CASINO will provide an extraordinary 24/7, behind the-scenes look at the real-life dramas unfolding at the Golden Nugget Las Vegas Hotel and Casino as its new owners, TIM POSTER and TOM BREITLING, attempt to bring back the glory of the hotel's \"Rat Pack\" heyday.

Each week, the climax of the episode will be a film screen-test, involving a breath-taking stunt action sequence competition -- and each week one pair of contestants will be eliminated -- until the final two are named the Next Action Stars -- earning the chance to star in the Silver Pictures movie, �Hit Me,� which is the series� finale on August 11 (9-11 p.m. ET). �Next Action Star� is a presentation of Silver Pictures Television, GRB Entertainment and NBC Studios.\n\nWEDDINGS GONE WACKY, WONDERFUL AND WILD: ANYTHING FOR LOVE (ABC)\n\nPremieres: Monday, June 14 (10:00 - 11:00 PM ET/PT)\n\nDiane Sawyer takes a funny and sometimes poignant look at some very different couples and their unusual paths to wedded bliss in \"Weddings Gone Wild: Anything for Love,\" a new, five-part series from ABC News. Each hour focuses on the stories of several grooms and brides-to-be as they face various challenges in their wedding planning efforts. Whether they're trying to pull off an elaborate extravaganza or overcome personal adversity that puts their wedding in jeopardy, all of the couples demonstrate incredible determination to make their dream day a reality. \"Weddings Gone Wild: Anything for Love\" airs on five consecutive Monday nights, beginning MONDAY, JUNE 14 (10:00-11:00 p.m., ET), on the ABC Television Network. The weddings chronicled in the series range from over-the-top blow-outs -- like a quarter-of-a-million-dollar Arabian Nights-themed celebration, complete with an elephant and belly-dancing bridesmaids -- to quick ceremonies at a Las Vegas wedding chapel. One couple is able to get their celebration entirely paid for by companies serving as the wedding's official sponsors - all they have to do is advertise a little. There is the wedding where everything goes wrong - from killer bees to broken-down cars. And what wedding saga would be complete without the presence of a \"momzilla,\" a mother so determined to put her stamp on her daughter's big day that she may just drive the lovebirds to elope. Some of the nuptials are more poignant: An African-American couple holds their wedding at a North Carolina plantation where the groom's ancestors once toiled as slaves, and a man plans a second wedding for his wife, who has lost all memory of her wedding day as the result of a car accident. Just as diverse as the weddings are some of the unlikely couples, including a weekend belly dancer who finds love with the drummer in her band and a man who tells his long-waiting girlfriend that he'll propose if his favorite hockey team wins the Stanley Cup. Then there's a duo at odds-she wants a beach wedding, he wants a Christmas-themed bash-who reach a very creative compromise. Diane Sawyer anchors \"Weddings Gone Wild: Anything for Love.\" Ann Reynolds is the senior producer. Shelley Ross is the executive producer.\n\nTHE JOE SCHMO SHOW: SEASON TWO (Spike TV)\n\nPremieres: Tuesday, June 15 (10:00 - 11:00 PM ET/PT)\n\nSpike TV's hit series returns in hilarious form with \"Joe Schmo 2,\" premiering Tuesday, June 15 @ 10 p.m. (ET/PT).

With an emphasis on romance, the series follows the courtship of �Dad� and the female contestants over six episodes. Adding to the fun will be a secret mole (the kids� aunt pretending to be one of the contestants), �Dad� going undercover in the first episode to secretly meet the women without them knowing it�s him and a high-stakes adventure where the women�s ex-boyfriends show up as jockeys on horseback at Santa Anita racetrack.

Over the course of eight episodes, the women will be put to the test, to see which one of them has the stamina to make it in the Outback and win the affection of their handsome hero.\n\nN.Y.P.D. 24/7 (ABC)\n\nPremieres: Tuesday, June 22 (10:00 - 11:00 PM ET/PT)\n\nTheir exploits have been the stuff of countless movies and television shows, but nothing can compare to the real thing. In \"NYPD 24/7,\" a new, true-life documentary series from the award-winning producers of \"Hopkins 24/7\" and \"Boston 24/7,\" ABC News cameras are given unprecedented access to the New York Police Department. Never before have cameras been allowed to roam so widely for so long among the closed ranks of the NYPD. For sixteen months, compelling characters from elite units share their hopes, their frustrations and their special brand of dark humor, as cameras follow them into situations that are unpredictable and often dangerous. \"NYPD 24/7,\" narrated by \"NYPD Blue's\" Dennis Franz, airs on seven consecutive Tuesday nights, beginning JUNE 22 (10:00-11:00 p.m., ET), on the ABC Television Network. \"NYPD 24/7\" shadows the real-life sleuths of the Homicide, Special Victims and Crime Scene units as they use their skills to solve baffling crimes-from the bizarre case of a man found boiled to death in a manhole to the capture of a serial rapist who thought he'd never be caught. The series also chronicles the daring work of skilled rescue units, including one engaged in a high-wire act to save a man's life. ABC News cameras then go from the street to the executive suite, following both a Bronx beat cop-a mother on patrol in one of the city's most violent neighborhoods-and her ultimate boss, Police Commissioner Ray Kelly, who tries to calm a jittery city on high alert for a terrorist attack. Along the way, the fault lines of a city are revealed-great extremes of wealth and poverty divide a demanding public that treats its cops with both admiration and contempt. In one Brooklyn neighborhood, racial tensions boil when residents say police didn't act soon enough to find a missing African-American woman. \"Join the fire department if you want to be a hero,\" says one cop. \"NYPD 24/7\" also provides a telling look at the culture inside the department, where officers are well-schooled in the race and gender-blind etiquette of the modern cop, yet where old myths persist and women cops have to go the extra mile to prove themselves. In the end the officers say that, despite the physical and emotional toll it can take, this life they call \"the job\" means everything to the 37,000 men and women who wear the blue. Terence Wrong is producer and executive producer of \"NYPD 24/7.\" Roxanna Sherwood is the co-producer. Bryan Taylor is the editorial producer. Rudy Bednar is the senior executive producer and Phyllis McGrady is the executive-in-charge.\n\nWHOSE LINE IS IT ANYWAY?
