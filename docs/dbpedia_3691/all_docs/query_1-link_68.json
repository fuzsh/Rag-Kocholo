        "text": "OMG², Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen are like the luckiest girls ever! They get to travel the world, hang out with famous grown-ups and make their own movies. Because they have so many great adventures to choose from, we’ve done the hard work for you and picked out our ten favorites.\n\nThe Challenge (2003) Sometimes twins who hate each other have to put aside their differences to win big prizes on a reality show. That’s the dilemma that the girls face when they’re both cast on a show that’s more Moolah Beach and less Survivor. In the end, they decide that the college scholarships are more important than arguing. You go, girls!\n\nGetting There (2002) You know that the Olympics just wouldn’t have been the same had the Olsens not been there. Thankfully, they head there on a road trip after doing one of the most important things ever: getting their drivers’ licenses! With their friends Sam, Lyndi and Toast they embark on a journey towards Salt Lake City and earning their parents’ trust.\n\nThe Adventures of Mary-Kate & Ashley: The Case of the Volcano Mystery (1997) Little girls everywhere loved watching the Olsens don their trench coats and promise that they’d “solve any crime by dinner time.” It’s hard to pick a favorite, but the volcano mystery really is one of the greats. When miners call in to claim they’re being terrorized by a monster, the twins swoop in and save the day. We always knew we could count on them!\n\nSwitching Goals (1999) Once again, the twins are playing opposites: Ashley dreams about fashion and boys, while Mary-Kate cares mostly about sports trophies. When Ashley is drafted for her dad’s winning soccer team and Mary-Kate is put on the worst team, they swap places to make everyone happy. In the end, everyone’s a winner... isn’t that sweet?\n\nWhen in Rome (2002) What could be better than interning in Italia? At their jobs, the girls deal with mindless tasks and a catty intern’s attempt at sabotage, but ultimately they spend more time gaping at dreamy Italian men than accomplishing any real work. Makes us seriously want a fabulous Mediterranean vacation.\n\nWinning London (2001) Ashley’s a total nerd, who does Model UN (ew), in this one. Thankfully, Mary-Kate has her priorities in check and only tags along on the team’s trip to the UK to follow a crush. Once they get there, though, everything falls apart in the competition, so boys, including some British royalty, are all they have left.\n\nPassport to Paris (1999) Ooh la la! Nothing beats riding on Mopeds with French boys, and we’re so jealous that the Olsens had the chance to explore the City of Light. From shopping at couture stores to sightseeing, the girls and their hotties always manage to evade their chaperone and have a great time.\n\nOur Lips Are Sealed (2000) So apparently if you see a crime happen, you become a part of this crazy thing called the Witness Protection Program, where you get a new name and move to a new place. That’s what happens when the twins see a diamond heist, but luckily they get sent to Australia, where they meet new friends who make everything better.\n\nBillboard Dad (1998) One’s a surfer, one’s a diver, but they share a common goal: setting their widowed dad up with the perfect girlfriend. In the process, wacky shenanigans ensue, including painting an advertisement on a Sunset Boulevard billboard. The twins are hilarious and successful in their matchmaking quest."
