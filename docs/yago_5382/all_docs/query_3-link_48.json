        "text": "Elisabeth Elliot, widow of missionary martyr Jim Elliot, passed away last week at the age of 88. Memorials and tributes have been pouring in, reminding us of God’s remarkable work in and through her life.\n\nI am so thankful for her bold, wise, courageous discipleship, and how she went public with her passion for the glory of Christ. Along with thousands of college students, I heard her speak in a characteristically frank manner at Urbana ’79. If Elisabeth Elliot was anything, she was direct—no nonsense: if Jesus is your Lord, stop playing games: the only path open to you is wholehearted devotion to him!\n\nMy copy of her book, Shadow of the Almighty (written in 1958, two years after her husband’s death), is held together by a rubber-band. It’s “the life and testament of Jim Elliot,” and the way she tells his story reveals a great deal about both husband and wife:\n\nJim “and the other men with whom he died were hailed as heroes, ‘marytrs.’ I do not approve. Nor would they have approved. Is the distinction between living for Christ and dying for Him, after all, so great? Is not the second the logical conclusion of the first?” (p. 11).\n\nAs a sophomore at Wheaton College, Jim wrote in his journal, “My grades came through this week, and were, as expected, lower than last semester. However, I make no apologies, and admit I’ve let them drag a bit for study of the Bible, in which I seek the degree A.U.G., ‘approved unto God’” (p. 43).\n\nJim vented, “Our young men are going into professional fields because they don’t ‘feel called’ to the mission field. We don’t need a call; we need a kick in the pants” (p. 54). And he prayed, “Father, make of me a crisis man. Bring those I contact to decision. Let me not be a milepost on a single road; make me a fork, that men must turn one way or another on facing Christ in me” (p. 59). “I only hope that He will let me preach to those who have never heard the name of Jesus. What else is worthwhile in this life? I have heard of nothing better. ‘Lord, send me!’” (p. 60). In fact, both Jim and Elisabeth set their hearts on missionary service—they were drawn, even compelled, to shine the light of Jesus in the darkest places.\n\nJim and Elisabeth met at Wheaton, and they wrestled with the idea of marriage. Jim articulated their shared resolve: “Singleness, simplicity, is required of me. One treasure, a single eye, and a sole Master” (p. 71). And yet, their friendship grew deep, and sweet. At age 23, from Ecuador Jim wrote to Elisabeth, expressing their mutual disregard for surface attractions (he had woken up with a disfigured face due to an eye infection): “You’d have trouble loving me if you went by looks today…. Oh Betty, we owe praise to God for teaching us the worth of inner adornment” (p. 157).\n\nRunning into a dry spell in his devotions, Jim determined, “I may no longer depend on pleasant impulses to bring me before the Lord. I must rather respond to principles I know to be right, whether I feel them to be enjoyable or not” (p. 119). And yet, time and again, Jim and Elisabeth would share how God did meet them and refresh them as they sought his Spirit’s presence through his Word.\n\nOne time, after praying for some token of God’s guidance, Jim said, “Got none…. God is going to give me a specific leading—not when I ask for it, but when I need it, and not until then” (p. 127). And yet, with time, a clear direction did emerge: “Felt assured again that the Lord is sending me to Ecuador, having no more place in the States since so many possess so much truth here” (p. 145).\n\nThe story of their eventual decision to marry is recounted by Jim in a letter from Ecuador to his parents the week of his 26th birth­day: “Nobody can accuse us of rushing things just because we decided to get married in less than three weeks—we have been in love for over five years and I think considered the will of God in marriage as carefully as anyone could,… Few have really tried to understand our long waiting for engagement and my going to the jungle single…. It has been a long lesson learning to live only before God, and letting Him teach the conscience and to fear nothing save missing His will. But we are learning, and I would live no other way” (p. 212).\n\nIn the epilogue, Elisabeth concludes, “Jim left for me, in memory, and for us all, in these letters and diaries, the testimony of a man who sought nothing but the will of God, who prayed that his life would be ‘an exhibit to the value of knowing God’” (p. 246). And, of course, the very same thing can be said of Elisabeth’s life of relentless disciple­ship, faithful ministry, and joyful praise to Christ!"
