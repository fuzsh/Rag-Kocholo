Her first husband, Jim Elliot, was killed in 1956 while attempting to make missionary contact with the Aucas (now known as Huaorani; also rendered as Waorani or Waodani) of eastern Ecuador. She later spent two years as a missionary to the tribe members who killed her husband. Returning to the United States after many years in South America, she became widely known as the author of over twenty books and as a speaker in constant demand. Elliot toured the country, sharing her knowledge and experience, well into her seventies.\n\nElisabeth believed in asking this foundational question: Is this God's will for me, right now, in this place? … Unapologetically, Elisabeth espoused such truths as: give to get, lose to find, and die to live. Setting her sights “on things above” (Colossians 3:1), Elisabeth ministered among three indigenous groups in Ecuador before helping listeners and readers find joy in the ordinary affairs of life—like cooking meals and cleaning toilets—on her globally syndicated radio program. She called it living sacramentally.\"\n\nElizabeth (Betty) Howard's parents were Philip Eugene Howard Jr. and Katharine Gillingham. She graduated from Wheaton College in 1948. She married first Philip James (Jim) Elliot about 1953. Children: Valerie who married Rev. Walter D Shepard Jr. They have eight children. She married second Dr. Addison Hardie Leitch in 1969 as his second wife. After his death in 1973 she married Lars L Gren on 21 Dec 1977. Elizabeth died on 15 Jun 2015 in Magnolia, Massachusetts after suffering for several years with Alzheimer's.\n\nSources\n\n↑ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elisabeth_Elliot\n\nElisabeth Elliot Foundation News and writings.\n\nMissionary Pioneer Elisabeth Elliot Passes Through Gates of Splendor\n\nNew York Times\n\nCBN News\n\nhttp://www.jameslau88.com/life_of_elisabeth_elliot.htm\n\nUS Federal Census 1930, 1940\n\nFlorida Passenger Lists\n\nUS Cemetery and Funeral Home Collection\n\nUS Consular Reports of Births\n\nUS Departing Passenger and Crew Lists\n\nUS Presbyterian Church Records\n\nUS Public Records Index\n\nUS Obituary Collection\n\nNew York State Passenger and Crew Lists\n\nReport of Deaths of American Citizens Abroad"
