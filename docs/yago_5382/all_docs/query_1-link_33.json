        "text": "One of the most well-known Christian authors of modern times is Elisabeth Elliot, and her books have made an impact on many lives.\n\nFor this month’s Sunday Reading post, instead of sharing one book, I will share a list of all the books that Elisabeth Ellito wrote.\n\nElisabeth Elliot was born in 1926 and grew up in a Christian home. She became a missionary and married Jim Elliot, whom she met at Wheaten College.\n\nAfter less than three years of marriage, Jim Elliot was killed by the Waodani Tribe, also known as the Auca Indians in Ecuador.\n\nElisabeth Elliot went on to serve as a missionary among the tribe that killed her husband.\n\nElisabeth and her daughter Valerie eventually moved back to the United States. Elisabeth remarried, was widowed again, and remarried for a third time.\n\nOver the years, Elisabeth Elliot became a well-known Christian author and speaker.\n\nBiographies About Elisabeth Elliot\n\nI recently read Being Elisabeth Elliot and Becoming Elisabeth by Ellen Vaugh. I enjoyed these biographies about Elisabeth Elliot and will share a full review soon.\n\nI am reading the Elisabeth Elliot biography by Lucy S. R. Austen, which I will also review when I finish reading it.\n\nReading so much about Elisabeth Elliot has me thinking a lot about her and her writings. After reading the Ellen Vaugn books, I realized there were quite a few books by Elisabeth Elliot that I had not read.\n\nI started to do some research and made a list of her books. As I made my list, I realized that there were quite a few of her books I had not read, and many were no longer published.\n\nI knew there would be others who were unaware of how many books she wrote. So, I wanted to share the list of books by Elisabeth Elliot with you.\n\nHow many books did Elisabeth Elliot write?\n\nThat is a bit of a tricky question to answer. It is somewhere between forty and fifty, depending on the list.\n\nShe wrote way more books than I realized, and I am guessing that she wrote more than most people know.\n\nI thought I had read most of the books Elisabeth Elliot authored, but when I put together this list, I realized that I have only read around half of her books.\n\nIt was hard for me to figure out exactly how many books Elisabeth Elliot wrote. The lists that I saw put it somewhere between forty and forty-eight.\n\nI think the discrepancies are because several of her books were republished over the years. Some were republished with the same name and a new cover. Others were republished with new titles and new covers. Some books have been even published under multiple titles.\n\nShe also wrote some booklets and writings in pamphlet forms that are hard to number. I listed the ones that I could find. I think there are probably more pamphlet type books that are not listed anywhere because they have not been published in years.\n\nThis list of Books by Elisabeth Elliot is what I think, or what I could find, is the complete list of books authored by Elisabeth Elliot.\n\nI tried hard for this list free of errors, but there may be some. Please let me know if you find an error on a publishing date, a book missing from the list, or other information that I should add.\n\nBooks By Elisabeth Elliot\n\nThe majority of our lists are of books that we have read. This list is slightly different because I am sharing a complete list of books by an author I have enjoyed. My goal is to eventually read all the books on this list.\n\nI do not agree with everything Elisabeth Elliot wrote, but her story is inspirational. There is much to be learned about the Christian life and serving God joyfully during trials by reading Elisabeth Elliot’s writings.\n\nThe books are listed in order of when they were published.\n\n1. Through Gates of Splendor\n\nThrough Gates of Splendor was published in 1957. It is available in paperback and on Kindle.\n\nThrough Gates of Splendor by Elisabeth Elliot has been published with several different covers over the years.\n\nThis is the first book Elisabeth Elliot wrote. It is the story of the five missionaries, including her husband Jim, who were killed by the Auca Indians in Ecuador.\n\nThe book’s subtitle is, the event that shocked the world, changed a people, and inspired a nation. That describes the book well.\n\nThe death of the five missionaries changed how people viewed mission work at the time, and it inspired many young men and women to sacrifice their lives for Christ.\n\n2. Shadow of the Almighty: The Life and Testament of Jim Elliot\n\nShadow of the Almighty was published in 1958. From what I can tell this is still available in paperback and hardback. You can also find it on audio and used. It is not available on Kindle.\n\nThis is the story of Jim Elliot. His life as a child, a college student, and a missionary.\n\nI read this when I was in high school. It was one of the first Christian biographies that I read. I loved it. For many years, it was my favorite biography. It has been years since I read it, so I probably need to go back and reread it.\n\nYou may not agree with everything Jim Elliot believed, but his life and story are inspiring. His story gave others the desire to strive harder to live for Christ.\n\n3. The Savage My Kinsman\n\nThe Savage My Kinsman was published in 1960. It is only available used.\n\nThis is one of the books by Elisabeth Elliot that is no longer published. A couple of years ago, there was quite a considerable debate about the title of this book and how Elisabeth Elliot portrayed the Auca Indians.\n\nThe Savage My Kinsman is Elisabeth’s story of venturing into Auca Indian territory and serving and living with the same people who killed her husband. That is a pretty amazing story.\n\nIt took courage, bravery, and, above all, strength from God for Elisabeth Elliot to live among the people who killed her husband. I am not sure I could do the same.\n\nI read this book at least thirty years ago and enjoyed it. I can see why people don’t like the title of this book, but I think they could change the title, do some minor editing, and republish it.\n\nIn my opinion, it is a worthy read even if you do not agree with everything in it. It was published in 1960, a very different time from today. Books often need to be read and understood from when they were lived and written, not from the lens of today.\n\n4. Let Me Be A Woman\n\nLet Me Be a Woman was published in 1966. I read this for the first time back in high school. I think it is the first book by Elisabeth Elliot that I read. I reread it in my twenties and again in my thirties.\n\nFor years, many Christian women considered this a must-read. Many now would consider it outdated, but I think it is still an excellent book.\n\nYou might not agree with everything in it, but there is much to be gleaned from this book about being a Christian woman.\n\n5. No Graven Image\n\nNo Graven Image was published in 1966. It is only available used and on Kindle.\n\nNo Graven Image is a novel. Elisabeth Elliot enjoyed writing this book about a twenty-five-year-old missionary to the Andes Mountains of Ecuador.\n\nThis is not about Elisabeth Elliot’s missionary life, but in many ways, it is about her missionary life. She weaved her experiences into this novel.\n\nThis book was published with mixed reviews. Many Christians disapproved of how she portrayed missionaries and their work. Elisabeth thought it told an accurate picture of what missionary life was often like.\n\nAfter reading an Elisabeth Elliot biography recently and learning more about this book, I decided to read it. I bought it on Kindle and plan to read it soon.\n\n6. The Liberty of Obedience\n\nThe Liberty of Obedience was published in 1968. It is only available used. This is a shorter book. I can’t find out much about this book, but it is about our freedom when we obey God.\n\nI have not read this one, but I may buy it if I can find a used copy for a reasonable price.\n\n7. Who Shall Ascend\n\nWho Shall Ascend was published in 1968. It is available used but is very expensive.\n\nThis is a biography that she wrote on the life of R. Kenneth Strachan, whose parents founded LAM (Latin America Mission). He was a missionary for years and became director of LAM.\n\nThis sounds like an excellent biography, but it is a little too expensive for me. If I found it cheap, I would buy it.\n\n8. Furnace of the Lord.\n\nFurnace of the Lord was published in 1969. It is available used but is very expensive. I think this book has been out of print for years.\n\nNot much information is available about it, but it is about Elisabeth’s time spent in Israel.\n\nThe used copies that I found online were crazy expensive.\n\n9. God’s Guidance: A Slow and Certain Light\n\nGod’s Guidance was published 1973. It has been published with several different covers and taglines. It is still available in paperback.\n\nI read this book years ago and enjoyed it. If my to-be-read stack were not huge already, I would probably reread it.\n\n10. These Strange Ashes\n\nIt is hard for me to tell when exactly These Strange Ashes was published. I have seen this book listed as initially published in 1975, 1976, and 1979.\n\nI read this book years ago, but my current copy is newer, so I am not sure of the exact publicist date other than it was in the late 1970s.\n\nThis book is about Elisabeth’s first year as a missionary after her husband, Jim, died. This book is more of a personal reflection and testimony than sharing a story like Savage My Kinsman is.\n\n11. Twelve Baskets of Crumbs\n\nTwelve Baskets of Crumbs was published in 1976. It is only available used.\n\nIt is a collection of her writings, essays, etc. that were published elsewhere. I think this is another one that has been out of print for quite a while.\n\nI have not read this one, but I would like to pick up a used copy of it someday.\n\n12. The Journals of Jim Elliot\n\nThe Journals of Jim Elliot was published in1978. it is still available.\n\nElisabeth Elliot combined her husband’s Jim’s journals into a book. This book reveals much about Jim Elliot and his thoughts and beliefs. It gives you a personal look into his life and struggles.\n\nI read this book years ago and enjoyed it.\n\n13. Love Has a Price Tag\n\nLove Has A Price Tag was published in 1979. It is only available used. It is a series of essays on living for Christ during the trials of life.\n\n14. The Mark of a Man\n\nThe Mark of a Man was published in 1981. It is still available. Like Let Me Be A Woman became a must-read for many Christian women, The Mark of a Man became a must-read for many Christian men.\n\nThe book is written for men about what Godly men and masculinity look like. Years ago, I read and enjoyed it before I was married. It gave me a good guideline for the type of man I wanted to date and marry.\n\nYou might not agree with everything in this book, but like Let Me Be A Woman, much can be gleaned from it.\n\n15. Made For the Journey\n\nMade For the Journey was published in 1979. it is still available. I saw several different publication dates for this book. From what I can tell, it is also a reprint of her earlier book about her work as a missionary after Jim died, called These Strange Ashes.\n\n16. All That Was Ever Ours\n\nAll That Was Ever Ours was published in 1982. It is only available used. This is a book of writings about grief and struggles in life. I own this book but have not read it yet.\n\n17. Discipline The Glad Surrender\n\nDiscipline The Glad Surrender was published in 1982. It is still available. This book has also been published under the title Joyful Surrender.\n\nThis book is about the importance of discipline in the Christian life and the joy it brings.\n\n18. Passion and Purity\n\nPassion and Purity was published in 1984. It is still available. This book shares Elisabeth and Jim Elliot’s love story and thoughts on Christian dating. It is an honest look at the temptations and struggles you face when dating.\n\nThis book has become a classic on Christian dating. Like her books Let Me Be A Woman and Mark of A Man, you might not agree with everything in this book, but it contains some great thoughts on Christian dating will make for great conversations.\n\nI read this book years ago.\n\n19. Marriage is a Gift\n\nMarriage is a Gift was published in 1982. It is no longer available, and I could not find out much about it. I think it was more of a booklet than a book, though.\n\n20. Notes On Prayer.\n\nNote On Prayer was published in 1982. You might be able to find this used, but it is no longer in print. It appears to be another one that is more of a booklet than a book.\n\n21. As We Forgive Those\n\nAs We Forgive Those was published in 1983. This is no longer published, but you might be able to find it used. From what I can tell, this is also another one that is a booklet and not a regular book.\n\n22. A Lamp Unto My Feet\n\nA Lamp Unto My Feet was published in1985. It is still available. In this book, Elisabeth Elliot shares the importance of the Bible and making it our guiding light for life.\n\nI read this book quite a few years ago and enjoyed it. It might be time for a reread.\n\n23. A Chance to Die\n\nA Chance To Die was published in 1987. It is still available in paperback and Kindle. A Chance to Die is the biography of Amy Carmichael. Amy Carmichael was a missionary who spent over fifty years serving in India.\n\nHer ministry was mainly to women and children and she made a huge difference in their lives.\n\nAmy Carmichael had some odd beliefs, especially compared to modern times, but she lived a life for Christ, from which we can learn a lot. Not many Christians would be willing to live and serve like Amy Carmichael did.\n\nI read this as a teenager and again a few years ago. I enjoyed it both times that I read it.\n\n24. Loneliness\n\nLoneliness was published in 1988. This version is only available used, but the reprint is available and is book twenty nine on the list.\n\nElisabeth Elliot was a missionary. She also lost two husbands, both of whom she loved deeply. Elisabeth Elliot knew loneliness. She knew the struggles and the pains.\n\nI recently read the Elisabeth Elliot biography by Ellen Vaugn, and I thought about this book and how deeply she suffered from the loneliness of not having a husband.\n\nIn her book on Loneliness, Elisabeth looks at a struggle that should ultimately force us to turn to Christ.\n\nThis is another one that I have read twice over the years and enjoyed.\n\n25. On Asking God Why\n\nOn Asking God Why was published in 1989. It is still available in paperback. I think it was also published under the title Trusting God In A Twisted World.\n\nI read this book years ago when I was going through a very difficult time and was struggling to understand why God was putting my family and me through the difficulty.\n\nThe book brought me comfort and peace. Elisabeth does a great job writing about pain and suffering in the Christian life.\n\n26. A Path Through Suffering\n\nA Path Through Suffering was published in 1990. This book is still available in paperback, audio, and Kindle.\n\nI think her writings on pain and suffering are Elisabeth Elliot’s best writing. She knew pain and suffering. She also knew God’s grace. She knew that we live in a fallen world with a sovereign God.\n\nA Path Through Suffering is one of those books that I think Christians could benefit from reading over and over.\n\n27. Forget-Me-Not.\n\nForget Me Not was published in 1990. It is available used, but is very expensive. It is a book about loving those who can no longer care for themselves.\n\nThis is one of Elisabeth Elliot’s books that I knew nothing about. I had never heard of it. It is no longer in print, but I wish it were. It sounds like a good book for those caring for others in life.\n\n28. How to Overcome Loneliness\n\nHow To Overcome Loneliness was published in1991. From what I can tell, this was a reprint of her precious book on loneliness.\n\n29. The Path of Loneliness\n\nThe Path of Loneliness was published in 1991. This was another reprint of her previous book on loneliness and is still available. I am not sure why this one was retitled and republished so many times.\n\n30. The Shaping of a Christian Family\n\nThe Shaping of a Christian Family was published in 1992. It is available in paperback, audio, and Kindle. In The Shaping of a Christian Family, Elisabeth Elliot shares her story of her childhood and growing up in a Christian home.\n\nThis book reminds us of the importance of prayer, Bible reading, scripture reading, and living as Christians in our homes.\n\nI have had this book for years. I own two copies of it, but I don’t think I have ever read it.\n\n31. Love Knows No Limit\n\nLove Knows No Limit was published in 1992. It is no longer published, but you can find some used copies. I could not find much information on this one.\n\n32. God’s Guidance\n\nGod’s Guidance was published in 1992. It was previously published as A Slow and Certain Life and God’s Guidance.\n\n33. Keep A Quiet Heart\n\nKeep A Quiet Heart was published in 1995. It is still available in paperback, audio, and Kindle. This is more of a devotional book about learning to trust and walk with God.\n\nI read this book years ago and enjoyed it.\n\n34. Quest For Love\n\nQuest For Love was published in 1996. It is still available in paperback and Kindle. In Quest For Love, Elisabeth shares stories and wisdom about Christian singleness and dating.\n\n35. Gateway To Joy\n\nGateway To Joy was published in 1998. It is no longer published. Limited copies are available used. I could not find a lot of information on this one, but I think it was published in coordination with her Gateway To Joy radio broadcast.\n\n36. Taking Flight\n\nTaking Flight was published in 1999. It is no longer published. It is available used. It was written for those who are graduating.\n\nI think I used to own a copy of this book, but I must have given it away because I no longer have it.\n\n37. The Music of His Promises\n\nThe Music of His Promises was published in 2000. It is only available used. I read this years ago. I think I bought and read it shortly after it was released. It is another one of her books about trials and sufferings in life.\n\n38. Secure In the Everlasting Arms\n\nSecure In the Everlasting Arms was published in 2002. It is available in paperback, Kindle, and audio. This book shares some of Elisabeth’s story of trusting God and clinging to Him during trials in life.\n\nI own this book but have not read it.\n\n39. Be Still My Soul\n\nBe Still My Soul was published in 2003. It is available in paperback and Kindle. This is another one that I own, but I have not read.\n\nThis is a book of reflections on the Christian Life titled after one of Elisabeth’s favorite hymns.\n\n40. Faith That Does Not Falter\n\nFaith That Does Not Falter was published in 2003. Previously published as Taking Flight. No longer published. Some availability is used.\n\n41. Guided By God’s Promises\n\nGuided By God’s Promises was published in 2018. It is available in paperback and on Kindle. Previously published as Music of His Promises.\n\n42. Suffering Is Never For Nothing\n\nSuffering Is Never For Nothing was published in 2019. It is still available.\n\nThis book is not a book written by Elisabeth Elliot. It is a book written from some of her last messages, which were on suffering. I have read this book and also listened to it on audio. It is an excellent book on suffering and the Christian life.\n\n43. The Heart of God\n\nThe Heart of God was published in 2022. It is still available. This devotional was published after Elisabeth died, sharing never-before-published writing. I do not own this one, but it looks like a great one."
