        "text": "Part One\n\n\n\nBedrock\n\nChapter 1\n\nCertainty\n\nThe Christian realizes that his true identity is a mystery known only to God, . . . and that any attempt at this stage on the road of discipleship to define himself is bound to be blasphemous and destructive of that mysterious work of God forming Christ in him by the power of the Holy Spirit.\n\n—Elisabeth Elliot\n\nI feel perfectly certain that I shall never marry again,\" Elisabeth Elliot declared early in 1956.\n\nIt had been nine days since her muscular young husband and his four fellow missionaries had been speared to death by members of a remote tribal people in the Amazon jungle.\n\nNo doubt all new widows make that statement, Elisabeth continued. But I feel sure in my heart.⁠¹\n\nBut perfect certainties, even among the most disciplined and celebrated of God’s saints, sometimes shift in the face of His surprises.\n\nAfter Jim and his colleagues died, Elisabeth remained in Ecuador for seven more years. Improbably, she trekked deep into the jungle with her tiny daughter and a colleague and lived among the Waodani\"⁠² people who had killed her husband and friends. Many of the Waodani embraced a new way of living. News reports called her a missionary hero, a brave widow carrying the gospel to those who had never heard it.\n\nBut this brave widow struggled. A lot. Painful personality conflicts with her fellow missionary compelled her to leave the Waodani. She worked among the Quichua people for a time, living in the house that her late husband had built in a mission station called Shandia. Her days advanced like a series of photos on a screen.\n\nBut in mid-1963, the setting of those images changed. The green eastern jungle of Ecuador became the White Mountains of New Hampshire. Little Valerie Elliot no longer frolicked naked in the river with her Waodani friends; now she wore plaid jumpers and rode a yellow school bus to elementary school each day. The grass hut in the jungle, and the mildewing wooden home that Jim built in Shandia, gave way to the house that Elisabeth designed, a streamlined structure with an enormous picture window overlooking Mount Lafayette. The days of translating the New Testament into Quichua or lounging in a woven hammock with Waodani women—puzzling over their indecipherable language and swatting flies—became a life of hunching over a typewriter, swatting interruptions and struggling to get English words on a page for a publisher’s deadline. The missionary who had written a few books now purposed to be a serious writer who used to be a missionary. It was hard work.\n\nThere was no more chicha drunk by the campfire from a common, hollowed gourd among the tribal people. Now Elisabeth’s tribe was the laconic New England laborer who cleared her field and dug her well, the wool-clad neighbor who taught her to ski, and the erudite crowd at New York cocktail parties, sipping gimlets. The small jungle campfire, with its background chatter of equatorial birds, became a crackling blaze in her own stone fireplace, the acres of woods beyond her window cloaked in a silent shroud of snow. Rather than running through the jungle at night, the lay midwife called to attend crisis births, now Elisabeth flew on Boeing jets toward speaking engagements at conventions and seminars, a sought-after public figure.\n\nEventually, the loneliness of a passionate woman who dreamed in the jungle of her lost lover Jim became the surprise of a new love that swept her right off her feet. Her earlier certainty about remarriage melted. A middle-aged Elisabeth Elliot, the financially independent writer and speaker, now shivered to the touch of Addison Leitch, the university professor, theologian, and writer with whom she had fallen desperately in love. They married on the first day of January 1969.\n\nBut the story, like Elisabeth’s married life with Jim Elliot, would not end on that happy note.\n\nThe death of a loved one can come fast or slow. The sudden loss is devastating, a free fall through space where the mind cannot catch up with the physical reality of the death. With the gradual loss, perhaps the mind has time to get used to the idea of the loved one’s departure before it occurs. The problem is, we never become accustomed to death’s cruel theft of the one we love, whether it is a sudden robbery, so to speak, or a long, slow, embezzlement.\n\nOnce stunned by the joy of new love, now she was widowed again. Another death. But her widowhood would not define her, particularly since she would marry a third time in 1979. Her life rolled on, decade by decade, until her own death in 2015.\n\nHer earlier years, related in Becoming Elisabeth Elliot, traced the transition of a young woman who dealt in certainties to the older woman who dealt, far too often, in the realm of uncertainties and the unknown. Now, being Elisabeth Elliot increasingly meant understanding how much she did not understand. She was certain of very few things—the good and holy character of God, His redeeming love, and merciful faithfulness. She sought her reference point beyond her own experiences, always pondering what she called the impenetrable mystery of the interplay between God’s will and human choices.\n\nIt is that strange mystery which shaped the next portion of her startling life story.\n\nChapter 2\n\nAn Irregular Stone\n\nHere, then, is as much of the truth as one biographer could discover about a [person]. Let the reader find as much of its meaning as he [or she] can.\n\n—Elisabeth Elliot, in her biography of missionary Kenneth Strachan, 1968\n\nI first met Elisabeth Elliot’s cheerful daughter, Valerie, when Val and her husband, Walt, drove a pickup truck several hundred miles from their home to mine. The flatbed overflowed with boxes, cartons, photo albums, and crates of an ancient invention called cassette tapes. We hauled it all into my home office.\n\nWe laughed, talked, and ate pork tenderloin, asparagus, and roasted red potatoes. Then Val and Walt had to hit the road, bound for the home of one of their eight children. I left the dishes for my kind husband and crept into my office, pulling open the boxes as if it was Christmas morning.\n\nHere were Elisabeth Elliot’s journals, stacks of them filled with her firm, flowing handwriting, recounting her days from her childhood through the next six decades. Her baby book, reams of personal correspondence written with faded blue ink and a flourishing script, carbon copies of typewritten letters, dozens of notebooks filled with monthly expenses. There were lists of Christmas gifts given and received each year, books read, and shopping lists. There were notes for speeches, notes for seminary classes she taught, personal devotionals, scrapbooks with flaking, yellowed pages, and loose photographs, the glue that had once held them to the page long gone. And here was Jim Elliot’s Bible, and his hand-drawn maps of the great eastern jungle of Ecuador. Here were the famous black-and-white photographs taken after Jim and his fellow missionaries were killed. I had seen them all before, of course, in books and magazines. But these were the originals. I laid it all out, wearing gloves like an archeologist, on six-foot Costco tables I’d set up in my office. Heaps of buried treasure.\n\nAs I picked through these treasures over the weeks and months that followed, Elisabeth’s strong voice spoke from the past. She often made me laugh. She sometimes surprised me, and as I later questioned her family and friends about some of those surprises, I heard stories I had not expected. There were hidden realities that would mar the shiny surface of a tidy story, ripples of ruptured relationships, difficult dysfunctions: in short, the disorderly challenges that face real people in the real world. It’s just that I hadn’t expected they would be part of the life of Elisabeth Elliot, a woman renowned for her sense of order and decorum.\n\nHer life was full of paradoxes. A spiritual rebel when she returned to the United States from her time in Ecuador, she later became a conservative evangelical standard-bearer, though she was no prude. She regarded both heterosexual and homosexual attraction full of compassion. This might surprise those who might assume she would shriek and judge any temptation or behavior aside from a life of unsullied purity. A fiercely independent woman, in her third marriage she yoked herself to a definition of marital submission that many of us would question. In her older years, this woman known for her diffidence and monosyllabic personal interactions with strangers at speaking events and book signings, became a beloved mother figure to thousands who had never met her. Her advice heeded by tens of thousands of radio show listeners, she made some surprisingly sad personal mistakes.\n\nDid any of this disqualify my interest in Elisabeth Elliot? Far from it. I loved her as a fellow pilgrim on the trail. Her story echoed parts of my own, and I found it all to be redemptive.\n\nSo, as an earnest but doomed biographer, I had a choice. I could write a victorious, inspirational white-washed story, always a popular option in many Christian circles. Or I could tell it straight. I thought about the Bible. Surely its authors would have produced a far less puzzling book if they had omitted certain stories, the ones that we just don’t tend to read to our children. Some Old Testament protagonists were masters of duplicity. Sarah, Rachel, and Tamar: clever and deceptive. Noah singlehandedly saved humanity from the global flood, and then got drunk and naked on his own new grapes. Some kids—well, forty-two of them—made fun of the prophet Elisha’s bald head as he walked down a path, and he basically called forth judgment upon them. Two female bears obligingly emerged from the forest and mauled them all.\n\nThere are also forthright accounts of agonizing human frailty and brokenness. Eve and Adam disobeyed God and lost Paradise. Just as we would. Jesus’s friend Peter, who had lived with Christ for three years, denied that he even knew Him just before the crucifixion.\n\nIf Scripture had been made up to support a humanly engineered religion, it would have been far glossier and more palatable to human readers. Its very scandals—most notably, the scandal of the Cross—offer evidence of its authenticity. It is a real book about a supernatural God mysteriously invading the stories of real people. Outside of radical revision, the Bible would not make it as a cheerful Hallmark movie.\n\nAs Elisabeth wrote in 1968, Possibly there is no better model for biography than the Bible. There it is perfectly plain that a true understanding of the world is not to be gained by pretending that things are other than what they are. If there is good, let it not be exaggerated. If there are evils, let us see what they are, and, if we will, let us bring to bear upon them the light of a Biblical faith, but let us not operate as though they simply did not exist and therefore needed no redemption.⁠¹\n\nThere is great virtue in truth, told with love. Flawed and relatable protagonists showcase the supernatural power of God. We all resonate with them, as opposed to the dull and caricatured folk of fake religiosity.\n\nThis is just a biography. It’s not the Bible. I saw pieces of Elisabeth’s story that had not made it into her public speaking, nor her books about families, men and women, and faith. I wish she had included them; the story would have been all the richer, brimming with God’s grace. She was a human being, after all, not some flawless, gleaming captain in the army of God. I puzzled over some of the broken relationships, the falsehoods that had been perpetrated, not deliberately, but by assumptions that had rolled onward for years with an energy all their own. The story was made more difficult to tell, too, because some of her meticulously numbered journals and key pieces of correspondence were missing. I did not know why.\n\nI began to realize that I should warn my readers: If you want the expected version of Elisabeth Elliot’s story, don’t read this book. Find another, more predictable version.\n\nI do not want to create a melodrama, with one-dimensional saints and villains. I do not want to titillate with a tell-all. I do not want to offend, or smear, or gush, or get it wrong. I do not want to write this book, partially because I know I will need to insert more of my own voice in the account.\n\nElisabeth’s early years, the subject matter of Volume 1 of this two-part biography, lent themselves to a discernable narrative arc. That story had a beginning, middle, and end, and Elisabeth’s years in Ecuador brimmed with color and drama.\n\nHer later years were no less dramatic, but they were more psychologically complex. In the 1960s Elisabeth articulated views that would likely shock some of her followers of the 1980s and ’90s, while they might relieve some of her critics.\n\nAs with a film, it’s all a matter of the editing and what one leaves on the cutting room floor, so to speak. I could choose scenes and writings from Elisabeth’s life that would present her one way. Or I could choose other selections and spin it the other way. We could all say, ah, yes, Elisabeth Elliot, she was this. Or that. Choose your tag line; post your tweet.\n\nMiserable with the responsibility of it all, I was strangely comforted by Elisabeth’s one novel, published in 1966. It was not particularly popular. No Graven Image evoked the idols we so easily establish in our lives, particularly the religious constructs that codify God and resist any complexity and mystery. We presume to speak for God, the god we assume shares not only our political and social views, but our taste. The god of the bumper sticker, the hashtag, the slogan. The one who is on our side. Never mind if we are on God’s side.\n\nIt’s nothing new that we tend to do this with the Almighty. The concurrent problem, of course, is that we do it with each other. It is so easy to divide the world into Us and Them, and to demonize the other side. As long as there is an enemy, we can raise money and gain adherents for our cause. As long as we see people as one or two-dimensional, we can typecast them. Ah. He was a great hero . . . but then the statue—the graven image—topples, and he was just a villain. We look up to someone as a spokesperson for our movement . . . but then the secret sin emerges, and we don’t know where to look. We admire someone, and it turns out she hated golden retrievers, and it’s all over. We long for heroes without complexity, heroes without aspects that we just don’t like and can’t admire. We want images, the noble, gleaming statue without the pigeon poop.\n\nBut among human heroes, these just do not exist.\n\nThere is a movement today that seems to suggest that perfect virtue is possible, and that any human being with any flaws must be dragged down. Given those standards, the movement itself cannot stand; utopian views about human nature always prove untenable in the end.\n\nThere is only one Hero who does not disappoint. As for the rest of us, we must be strangely content to see people as they are, courageous and terrified, noble and petty, discerning and blind. In it all, among the best of our lot, there is plenty to admire and plenty to strive for; the rest is simply cause, as always, to look to God and praise Him for His amazing grace that He would save wretches like us as the old hymn says. Our legacies as individuals are not so much about the trophies we win in our short lives, because that so easily leads to pride. Rather, the legacy of our brokenness and need for Christ highlights His eternal, golden mercies.\n\nMartin Luther is one of those complex figures who changed the course of human history. We all know he was famously flawed. Brilliant, stubborn, in love with God and His Scriptures, fond of ale, subject to depression, anger, and the source of scurrilous, horrifying hate speech against certain people groups. What do we do? Cancel him?\n\nLuther thoughtfully provided the key for the rest of us: his dying words. We are all beggars. Elisabeth Elliot would shout out an amen to that, brother, if she was the sort of person who shouted amens, which she was not. But we are all poor, restless, needy people, right down to the end of this perplexing life. We have no merit on our own, no wealth of good deeds in our pockets that God counts up and, mollified, lets us in. No, we’re all beggars. Vagrants. Bums. Yet what awaits us is the great Feast of grace God offers on the other side, where Martin Luther and Elisabeth Elliot and a host of other imperfect heroes sit today, passing the platters and praising the Lord.\n\nEarly in my research process, I visited the North Shore of Boston. Elisabeth had lived for many years in Magnolia, Massachusetts, in a cozy home overlooking the cold, gray sea. At the time her third husband, Lars Gren, still lived there. I had various visits, both puzzling and friendly, with him, as well as rich conversations with Elisabeth’s younger brother, Tom, various close friends, and other relatives in the area. I had much to sort out.\n\nOne afternoon I drove to the church where Elisabeth had worshipped during her older years, the First Congregational Church of Hamilton. It had been established in 1713, sixty-three years before the signing of the Declaration of Independence, a little parish church in the tiny hamlet that eventually became Hamilton, Massachusetts.\n\nI parked and walked across the road to the church’s graveyard. It was a glorious, sky-blue day. Sunshine filtered through the soaring, old trees above me; small American flags fluttered in the breeze. The grave markers were all different sizes and shapes. Some marked the lives of those who had fought in the Revolutionary War; other stones commemorated men and women, boys and girls, who had lived their lives and died in the centuries since.\n\nI had looked up the location of Elisabeth Elliot’s grave and walked toward the rear of the long cemetery. No one else was around.\n\nThe gravestone was a big, irregularly shaped, smooth boulder with Elisabeth’s name and one of her favorite verses engraved upon it. When thou passest through the waters I will be with thee. She is buried with Addison Leitch, whose inscription reads, loved husband and best friend of Elisabeth. This is interesting, given the fact that she was married to Addison for less than five years and to Lars for more than three decades. I decided to think about that later.\n\nI sat down, my back against the sun-warmed stone. I thought of the flawed saints who have gone before us, all those biblical characters and men and women of faith down through the ages. I leaned on that boulder and thought of the irregular shapes of all our stories, how God redeems us all, and that somewhere in heaven, so close and yet so far, all is calm, and all is well. My mind drifted in the breeze, up toward the dappled light. So, then, God, I prayed, how do You want me to tell Elisabeth’s story?\n\nHe did not audibly answer. Neither did Elisabeth Elliot, her bones underneath the green sod and the big stone on which I leaned. Presumably, they both had better things to do.\n\nI breathed deep, stretched, and got to my feet. My eyes fell on the gravestone behind Elisabeth’s. I don’t know why I was drawn to it, as its back side was facing me. But I walked a few paces, knelt, and pulled away the long grass that was obscuring the inscription near its base. I read the deep-carved words.\n\nThe truth, in love.\n\nThat was all.\n\nI took it as a message, a guiding principle, as I began the journey of writing these biographies about the life and death of Elisabeth Elliot. Tell the truth, in love.\n\nSo that is what I have endeavored to do.\n\nPart Two\n\n\n\nBeing\n\nChapter 3\n\nElisabeth Elliot and the Psychedelic ’60s\n\nModern man is hung up on his identity. The Christian realizes that his true identity is a mystery known only to God, and that any attempt at this stage on the road of discipleship to define himself is bound to be blasphemous and destructive of that mysterious work of God forming Christ in him by the power of the Holy Spirit. Certainly the Christian does not define his identity by his actions: that is the very ultimate in anti-Christ, for it is in effect saying that I am my own creator.\n\n—Michael Marshall, quoted by Elisabeth Elliot⁠¹\n\nI deplore those above the knee skirts. No one is flattered by bare knees.\n\n—Elisabeth Elliot\n\nWhen Elisabeth Elliot first sailed to Ecuador in the spring of 1952, she was an idealistic, dedicated, single missionary in her mid-twenties. When she returned to the United States for good in the summer of 1963, she was a widow with a seven-year-old daughter, earnestly committed to Christ, but idealistic no more.\n\nDuring Elisabeth’s dozen years in Ecuador, life had of course gone on in the world beyond the missionary station and the Amazon jungle. But social changes in America had not had a huge effect on Elisabeth’s daily life in the distant, isolated jungle.\n\nWhen she and Val moved to Franconia, New Hampshire, in the summer of 1963, Elisabeth’s new life in small-town America continued to be fairly insulated.\n\nThese years of radical transitions in American life and thought fomented philosophical forces still reaping profound changes in the world we inhabit today. And even if Elisabeth Elliot did not march in the front lines of ’60s civil rights protests, or burn her bra in the nascent women’s movement, or demonstrate against U.S. involvement in the conflict in Vietnam, these social convulsions—and many more—made up the increasingly turbulent times in which she and Valerie transitioned into their new lives in North America.\n\nIn 1963, President John F. Kennedy and his glamorous wife, Jackie, dwelt in the White House. A month before Kennedy’s inauguration in early ’61, a communist and insurgent coalition called the Vietcong threatened the existing regime in faraway South Vietnam. Concerned about a domino effect in Southeast Asia, with countries tumbling to communist rule one by one, the Kennedy White House quietly increased the U.S. presence in Vietnam . . . which would mushroom over the years.\n\nIn 1962, the Soviet Union’s Nikita Khrushchev put the charismatic young President Kennedy to the test. On October 14, 1962, an American spy plane photographed a Soviet medium-range ballistic missile being assembled for installation on the island of Cuba, just ninety miles from the coast of Florida. A nuclear missile launched from Cuba against the United States could mean the death of eighty million Americans within ten minutes.\n\nThe Cuban Missile Crisis brought America to the brink of nuclear war with the Soviet Union. There seemed no way out until, thirteen days later, the USSR agreed to remove its missiles if America agreed not to attack Cuba.\n\nIt was a reprieve, but no one knew for how long. There was little cause to feel confident about lasting peace in the tense, Cold War world.\n\nThe United States also had deep problems at home. Though the Supreme Court had ruled against racial segregation in public schools in 1954, segregation was still legal in 1963. Alabama’s new governor, George Wallace, had famously proclaimed in his inauguration speech, segregation now, segregation tomorrow, and segregation forever! In the spring of ’63, the Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. was arrested in Birmingham during a civil rights protest for parading without a permit. King then wrote his masterful Letters from a Birmingham Jail. In August, the civil rights leader made his I Have a Dream speech before 250,000 people at the Lincoln Memorial. In September, Ku Klux Klan members bombed a predominantly black Baptist church in Birmingham, Alabama, killing four young Sunday school girls. Segregation would not officially end until the Civil Rights Act of 1964; its awful legacy continues today.\n\nIn 1963, the population of New Hampshire was roughly 660,000 people. Ninety-three percent of them were white. The most popular show on the clunky TV set that Elisabeth Elliot did not own was The Beverly Hillbillies, about a backwoods family that strikes it rich and moves to Hollywood, shocking the locals with their homespun ways. Cleopatra, an epic starring Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton, was the number one film at the box office. The first James Bond film was released. A movie ticket cost 85 cents.\n\nThe average cost of a new house was about $12,650. The standard wage was about $4,400 a year—roughly 84 bucks a week. A loaf of bread cost 22 cents, a gallon of gas, 30 cents. Cars were large and shiny, with big fins, happily guzzling all that cheap gas. A failing car company called Studebaker was the first to offer new devices called seat belts as standard vehicle equipment. The U.S. Postal Service introduced its own new idea: zip codes.\n\nBeatlemania had not yet hit America. Billboard’s top song for ’63 was a cheery balled called Dominique, recorded by a habitual musician known as The Singing Nun. A new vaccine for polio was introduced; since it was delivered via a sugar cube, schoolchildren had no problem ingesting it. Coca-Cola introduced its first-ever diet drink, a foul concoction called TaB. It was sweetened with cyclamate, which was later banned for causing cancer in calorie-conscious rats.\n\nThere were other drugs at work as well. The decade that began with the black-and-white conformity of the 1950s, now blossomed into a bodacious bounty of flower-power pop art, neon peace signs, skies full of diamonds, and visions through kaleidoscope eyes—enhanced, of course, by marijuana, hashish, and the sixties’ favorite trip advisor, LSD.\n\nAlong with the drugs—and aided by the drugs—the biggest upheaval of the psychedelic decade would be the sexual revolution. Rejecting the double standards or cloistered sexuality of the 1950s, the young people of the ’60s happily rode a tide of free love and sexual experimentation, immeasurably helped by the introduction of the birth control pill in 1961.⁠²\n\nThere would be a musical revolution as well, led by the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, the Doors, the Who, Jimi Hendrix, Pink Floyd, the Kinks, Creedence Clearwater Revival, the Beach Boys, the Byrds, the Grateful Dead, Bob Dylan . . . the list, like the beat, goes on. And on.\n\nMuch of the music mirrored what was happening in popular culture, even as it led the way. I want to hold your hand became Why don’t we do it in the road? Love, love me, do became I’d love to turn you on. If George Harrison was into Eastern religion and the Maharishi and sitars, next thing you knew, everyone was singing about Vishnu and checking out transcendental meditation. When John Lennon said in 1966 that the Beatles were more popular than Jesus—with a wide backlash from angry pastors with crew cuts—most people under thirty just shrugged and agreed with John.\n\nThe bumper-sticker philosophy pasted on flower-festooned Volkswagen buses said it all. Harvard professor Timothy Leary, an LSD enthusiast, famously urged young people to tune in, turn on, and drop out. They did. Make love, not war. They did. Don’t trust anyone over thirty. They did not . . . until a year after their twenty-ninth birthday. And then there was the zeitgeist of the day: Question authority. They did.\n\nFor her part, Elisabeth Elliot did not exactly consider Dr. Timothy Leary an authority by whose injunction she would question authority. She was in her mid-thirties by now. She did not use hallucinogens, groove to rock and roll, embrace free love, join a commune, or march in the streets. But in one respect, Elisabeth Elliot was a 1960s rebel. For if her often-painful faith journey in Ecuador had taught her anything, it was indeed to question authority. Not divine authority. She took God at His Word. But she questioned the human authority of those who so often purported to speak for Him.\n\nChapter 4\n\nNew Construction\n\nThey were cosy and comfortable in their little house made of logs, with the snow drafted around it and the wind crying because it could not get in by the fire.\n\n—Laura Ingalls Wilder, Little House in the Big Woods\n\nWhile she was still in Ecuador, the enterprising Elisabeth had purchased a plot of land in Franconia, New Hampshire, overlooking the White Mountains. There were thick, pine-scented woods, a natural, unforested knoll on which to build a house with rolling, open views of the mountains in the distance, and a valley below dotted with farms, ski resorts, a village, and a public school for Valerie.\n\nElisabeth contracted with a home-building franchise called Techbuilt, first introduced in the United States in 1953 by a Harvard architect who taught at MIT. Characterized by simple lines, pitched roofs, overhanging eaves, cedar siding, and the extensive use of glass, these homes were created from factory-made modules for the walls, floor, and roof panels and delivered by truck. The idea was that a construction crew could put it up in a few days. The result would be a sleek, modern home that could be erected for much less cost than a conventional stick-built house.\n\nElisabeth wrote to her family that she loved the lovely, simple lines, semi-rustic appearance, and good quality materials. Regarding décor, she wanted nothing distinctive, identifiable, individual, original, or whimsical . . . I wanted the very best quality materials, and had to sacrifice style and individuality in order to suit my budget.⁠¹ The house, presumably, would be a backdrop for life, not the focal point. She would name her new home \"Indinyawi, a Quechua word drawn from Inca traditions. It meant Eye of the Sun.\" The home was no Machu Picchu, but its southeastern exposure meant that sunlight would flood its front windows most of the day."
