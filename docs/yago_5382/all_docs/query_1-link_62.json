Elisabeth Elliot was a linguist and spent several years living among the Waorani tribe in Ecuador, learning their language and translating the Bible into their native tongue.\n\n2. She was married three times, with her first husband, Jim Elliot, being a missionary who was famously killed by the Waorani people in 1956.\n\n3. Elisabeth Elliot authored over 20 books, including her most well-known work, \"Through Gates of Splendor,\" which chronicled the story of her husband's death and the forgiveness she extended to his killers.\n\n4. Despite being known for her conservative Christian beliefs, Elisabeth Elliot was a strong advocate for gender equality and women's rights, often speaking out against societal expectations placed on women."
