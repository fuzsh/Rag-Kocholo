        "text": "Elisabeth Elliot (1926-2015) was a missionary and a critically acclaimed author and speaker. For over half a century, her life of obedience, timeless teachings, and best-selling books have influenced both believers and seekers of the Christian faith. Elisabeth life work was to share these deep things: the trustworthiness of God, the blessings of obedience, the hope of joy in the midst of sorrow, the call to love one’s enemy, the priceless treasure of purity, and the true meaning of Biblical womanhood and manhood. Having written over twenty books, some of her most distinguished writings include, Passion and Purity, Let Me Be a Woman, Shadow of the Almighty, Through Gates of Splendor, and The Savage My Kinsman. The latter three chronicle Elliot’s missionary work and the life and martyrdom of her husband Jim Elliot. She is survived by her husband Lars Gren, her daughter Valerie Elliot Shepard, and eight grandchildren. Today, her legacy lives on through the work of the Elisabeth Elliot Foundation.
