I almost went through the sidewalk because I didn’t know Jim had any feelings for me.\n\nMy Mama had told me when I was thirteen years old, “Never chase boys! And keep them at arm’s length!” So I had done my level best to make sure that nobody had any idea that I was interested in Jim Elliot!\n\nSo it made me a little bit irritated to think that Jim Elliot was saying, “I think we better get squared away how we feel about each other!” I thought, Well, what gives this guy any idea that I have some feelings for him!?\n\nListen to Valerie Elliot Shepard retell her parents’ love story on Revive Our Hearts:\n\nDevotedly series\n\nListen to Elisabeth Elliot tell parts of her love story with Jim Elliot on FamilyLife Today®:\n\nDating Activities–Are They Wrong?\n\nAre Three Hearts Better Than Two?\n\nOne week before I graduated, a junior from Oregon named Jim Elliot, who had been sitting beside me in Greek classes and studying Thucydides with me in the hall outside the library, got around to admitting that he was in love with me. Marriage, however, was not a possibility, it seemed. He was convinced that God wanted him to be single like the apostle Paul, at least until he had been in jungle missionary work for long enough to determine whether a wife would be a liability or an asset. It was five and a half years before we got a green light from God to be married, five and a half years of learning to trust Him with what matters most, of walking by faith and not by sight, of believing the promise of Psalm 84: “No good thing will he withhold from them that walk uprightly” (v. 11).\n\n-Elisabeth Elliot in Love Has a Price Tag\n\nRead more of Elisabeth & Jim’s love story:\n\nThey Laid Love on the Altar from Valerie Elliot Shepard at Desiring God\n\nLife of Elisabeth Elliot compiled by James Lau\n\nMore Love Stories"
