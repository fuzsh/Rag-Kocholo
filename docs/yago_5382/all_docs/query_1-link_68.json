        "text": "Elisabeth Elliot was a Christian author and speaker. Her first husband, Jim Elliot, was killed in 1956 while attempting to make missionary contact with the Auca (now known as Huaorani; also rendered as Waorani or Waodani) of eastern Ecuador. She later spent two years as a missionary to the tribe members who killed her husband.\n\nâ\n\nReturning to the United States after many years in South America, she became widely known as the author of over twenty books and as a speaker. Elliot toured the country, sharing her knowledge and experience, well into her seventies. [1]\n\nEarly Life\n\nElisabeth Elliot was born Elisabeth Howard in Brussels, Belgium on December 21, 1926, [2] and her family included her missionary parents, four brothers, and one sister. Elisabeth's brothers, Thomas Howard and David Howard, are also authors.\n\nâ\n\nHer family moved to the Germantown neighborhood of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in the U.S. when she was a few months old. [3] In addition to Philadelphia, she lived in Franconia, New Hampshire and Moorestown, New Jersey. She studied Classical Greek at Wheaton College, believing that it was the best tool to help her with the calling of ultimately translating the New Testament of the Bible into an unknown language. It was at Wheaton where she met Jim Elliot. Before their marriage, Elisabeth took a post-graduate year of specialized studies at Prairie Bible Institute in Alberta, Canada, where a campus prayer chapel was later named in her honor.\n\nLife in Ecuador\n\nJim Elliot and Elisabeth Howard went individually to Ecuador to work with the Quichua (or Quechua) Indians; the two married in 1953 in the city of Quito, Ecuador. In January 1956, her husband Jim was speared to death along with four of his missionary friends while attempting to contact the Waorani tribe. Their daughter, Valerie (born February 27, 1955), was 10 months old when her father was killed. Elisabeth continued her work with the Quechua for two more years.\n\nâ\n\nTwo Huaorani women living among the Quichua, including one named Dayuma, taught the Huao language to Mrs. Elliot and fellow missionary Rachel Saint. When Dayuma returned to the Huaorani, she created an opening for contact by the missionaries. In October 1958, Mrs. Elliot went to live with the Huaorani with her three-year-old daughter Valerie and with Rachel Saint.\n\nâ\n\nThe Auca/Huaorani gave Elisabeth the tribal name Gikari, Huao for \"Woodpecker.\" She later returned to the Quichua and worked with them until 1963, when she and Valerie returned to the US.\n\nLife Back in The US\n\nIn 1969, Elisabeth married Addison Leitch, professor of theology at Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary in South Hamilton, Massachusetts. Leitch died in 1973. In the fall of 1974, she became an adjunct professor on the faculty of Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary and for several years taught a popular course entitled \"Christian Expression.\" In 1977, she married Lars Gren, a hospital chaplain. The Grens later worked and traveled together.\n\nâ\n\nFrom 1988 to 2001, Elisabeth could be heard on a daily radio program, Gateway to Joy, [5] produced by the Good News Broadcasting Association of Lincoln, Nebraska. She almost always opened the program with the phrase, \"'You are loved with an everlasting love,' â that's what the Bible says â 'and underneath are the everlasting arms.' This is your friend, Elisabeth Elliot...\" [6] Today reruns of the program may be heard over the Bible Broadcasting Network.\n\nHow Elisabeth Elliot Died\n\nElisabeth Elliot died in Magnolia, Massachusetts on June 15, 2015, at the age of 88.[2] Shortly after her death, Steve Saint, the son of one of the other missionaries who were killed alongside Elliot's first husband, Jim, posted on Facebook about her final victory over \"the loss of her mind to dementia\" and \"her ten year battle with the disease which robbed her of her greatest gift.\" [7][8]\n\nâ\n\nShe was survived by her third husband, Lars Gren, a daughter, Valerie Elliot Shepard and husband Walter, and eight grandchildren.\n\nâ\n\nElisabeth Elliot's Family\n\nSpouses:\n\nJim Elliot\n\nAddison Leitch\n\nLars Gren\n\nChildren:\n\nValerie Elliot\n\nRecommended Resources on Elisabeth Elliot\n\nThrough Gates of Splendor by Elisabeth Elliot (1981 - Book)\n\nShadow of the Almighty: The Life and Testament of Jim Elliot (2009)\n\nEnd of the Spear (2007 - Book)\n\nElisabeth Elliot Movies\n\nEnd of the Spear (2006 - DVD)\n\nThrough Gates of Splendor (2004 - DVD)\n\nTorchlighters: The Jim Elliot Story (2005 - Kids DVD)\n\nSteve Saint: The Jungle Missionary (2007)\n\nWorks of Elisabeth Elliot\n\nBe Still My Soul: Reflections on Living the Christian Life (2017)\n\nLet Me Be a Woman (2013)\n\nQuest for Love: True Stories of Passion and Purity (2013)\n\nPassion and Purity: Learning to Bring Your Love Life Under Christ's Control (2013)\n\nFacing the Death of Someone You Love (2012)\n\nShadow of the Almighty: The Life and Testament of Jim Elliot by Elisabeth Elliot (2009)\n\nThe Mark of a Man: Following Christ's Example of Masculinity (2007)\n\nEnd of the Spear (2007 - Book)\n\nThe Path of Loneliness: Finding Your Way Through the Wilderness to God (2007)\n\nOn Asking God Why: And Other Reflections on Trusting God in a Twisted World (2006)\n\nThe Shaping of a Christian Family: How My Parents Nurtured My Faith (2005)\n\nA Lamp Unto My Feet: The Bible's Light For Your Daily Walk (2004)\n\nThese Strange Ashes: Is God Still in Charge?

He will not allow quietness.\n\nGod has promised to supply all our needs. What we donât have now, we donât need now.\n\nThere is nothing worth living for, unless it is worth dying for.\n\nThe will of God is never exactly what you expect it to be. It may seem to be much worse, but in the end itâs going to be a lot better and a lot bigger.\n\nThe secret is Christ in me, not me in a different set of circumstances.\n\nLeave it all in the Hands that were wounded for you.\n\nThe world cries for men who are strong, strong in conviction, strong to lead, to stand, to suffer.\n\nThe fact that Iâm a woman doesnât make me a different kind of Christian, but the fact that Iâm a Christian does make me a different kind of woman.\n\nReferences\n\nShellnutt, Kate. \"Missionary Pioneer Elisabeth Elliot Passes Through Gates of Splendor\".
