        "text": "Passion and Purity\n\nBefore reading Jim and Elisabeth's touching love story, let's get to know them a little bit first.\n\nWho are Jim and Elisabeth Elliot? Jim and Elisabeth Elliot are two of the most influential people in the history of missions. Both were missionaries to the Auca Indians in Ecuador. Jim was martyred alongside four other missionaries during Operation Auca on January 8, 1956. Their lives reflect total devotion to Christ and to the message of the gospel. Their stories of perseverance, suffering, and even death have inspired many to go reach unreached peoples.\n\nAfter Jim Elliot’s death, Elisabeth decided to continue working among the Quechua for two more years.Two Auca women lived among them, including a woman named Dayuma, who had run away from her tribe when her family was killed. She taught the Huao language to Mrs. Elliot and Nate Saint’s sister, Rachel. During the next two years, Elisabeth prepared to go to the people that had killed her husband and share the gospel with them.\n\nIn October 1958, Elisabeth Elliot, her three-year-old daughter Valerie, and Rachel Saint went to go live with the tribe that killed their husband, father, and brother. Dayuma was able to create an opening for them to be welcomed into the tribe. Elisabeth was with the Auca’s for two years, while Rachel stayed until she passed away on November 11, 1994.\n\nAfter moving to the village, Elisabeth began to teach the Auca Indians from the Bible. Her forgiveness and acceptance of the tribe are what led them to accept Jesus Christ. She taught them to forgive fearlessly and love tremendously, which forever transformed their way of life. One of the first men to receive Jesus as his Lord and Savior, was Mincaye, the man who speared Nate Saint and Ed McCully.\n\nAfter receiving Christ, the tribe renamed itself ‘Waorani’, turning from their Auca roots–which meant ‘savage’–to display a powerful message of transformation.\n\nThere are four things worth pondering:\n\n1. The missionaries had guns in their hands. But even at the last moment of their lives, they did not pull the trigger. Because they were convinced that they were ready to meet the Lord, but none of the Auca people who have never heard of the Gospel have yet.\n\n2. A reporter asked Elizabeth when she became a widow \"Was your husband's life wasted?\"\n\nElizabeth answered: \"Wasted? He always wanted to accomplish such a thing since he was a child, he just fulfilled his dream now.\"\n\n3. Elizabeth returned to the Ecuadorian jungle with her little girl after her husband was killed, and continued her husband's unfinished task. The Auca people asked with confusion: \"Why do you come back?\" Elizabeth said: \"We want to tell you that there is a Son of God who was killed and He did not revenge.\" Evantually, the entire Auca tribe was won by Christ.\n\n4. The stories of the five missionaries have inspired countless young people to devote themselves to mission work. This story inspires generations of believers to this day.\n\nToday, Jim and Elisabeth Elliot’s legacy still lives on in our hearts. During his life, Jim Elliot longed for more people to become missionaries. In his death, however, he probably inspired more people to go to other countries to share the love of Jesus than he ever could have in his life.\n\nJim and Elisabeth’s Beginnings\n\nJim Elliot met Elisabeth Howard during his third year at Wheaton College in 1948.\n\nJim Elliot was roommates with Elisabeth’s brother, and her brother always spoke highly about Jim. While Jim definitely had an interest in girls, he did not think that he needed to be concerned with worldly things so that he could completely devote himself to God. Elisabeth was also dedicated to God and could not see herself in a relationship just yet, although she liked Jim. Jim often sat next to her in their class for studying Greek, making her heart jump, and would ask:\n\n“Well, where are we today?”\n\nElisabeth said that she always admired how he loved God. She also thought that he was quite handsome and his passion for the salvation of souls is what drew her to him.\n\nBoth were involved in evangelism in downtown Chicago and would ride on the train together with other students. Elisabeth did not think that Jim liked her. As they came to know each other, they acknowledged that they were attracted to each other. However, Jim still felt that he was to remain single as a missionary for at least five years. Elisabeth was disappointed but trusted that God would bring them together if that was His will. After seeking God’s will for their lives for five years, they were married in 1953.\n\nYears later, Jim and Elisabeth Elliot’s daughter Valarie wrote:\n\n“My mother gave me my father’s letters many years before I got to read them. I was most amazed by his writing ability and poetic imagery, my mother’s brilliant logic and clarity, and the delightful sense of humor they both had. I also didn’t know how they struggled with not being sure of whether God wanted them to marry, and why and how long it took for my father to know when he had “the green light”!”\n\nJim Elliot’s own writing of personal reflections on faith, work, and love can be found in The Journals of Jim Elliot. Elisabeth Elliot chronicled his life and testament in Shadow of the Almighty, and immortalized the stories of the five missionaries martyred in Through Gates of Splendor. Most recently, the story of the couple in their own words can be found in Devotedly: the Personal Letters and Love Story of Jim and Elisabeth Elliot, which was published by their daughter.\n\nJim and Elisabeth's love story was shared in the book - Passion and Purity, by Elisabeth Elliot.\n\n\"In the providence of God, I have had three chances to reflect on and try to practice the principals I write about here. I have been married three times: to Jim Elliot, killed by Indians in the Ecuadorian jungle; to Addison Leitch, killed by cancer; and to Lars Gren, who is feeling fine on the day I'm writing this. Lars has lasted nearly six years, which is longer than either Jim or Add, so he says he is the\"front runner. May he outrun me!\"\n\n\"I will not tell the stories of all three. The Jim Elliot segment should suffice as a framework for what I want to say. Here is a chronology of that segment:\n\n1947--both of us students at Wheaton College, Illinois. He visits our home in New Jersey at Christmas.\n\n1948--Jim confesses his love for me just before I graduate.\n\nSummer, I in Oklahoma, he traveling with a gospel team. No correspondence between us.\n\nFall, his decision to begin to write to me when I go to Canada to Bible school.\n\n1949--Jim graduates, goes home to Portland, Oregon. I work in Alberta, then visit his home.\n\n1950--Jim at home, working, studying, preparing for missionary work. I in Florida. We spend two days in Wheaton when my brother Dave Howard is married.\n\n1951-We meet again when Jim comes east to speak in missionary meetings in New York and New Jersey.\n\n1952--February, Jim sails for Ecuador. April, I sail for Ecuador. Spend several months in Quito, living with Ecuadorian families to learn Spanish by\"immersion\n\nAugust, Jim moves to Shandia in the eastern jungle to work with Quichua Indians.\n\nSeptember, I move to San Miguel in the western jungle to work with Colorado Indians.\n\n1953-January, we meet in Quito, Jim asks me to marry him. Engagement announced.\n\nJune, I move to Dos Rios, eastern jungle, to start study of Quichua, fulfilling the condition of his proposal, \"I won't marry you till you learn it.”\n\nOctober 8, married in Quito.\n\n1955--daughter, Valerie, born.\n\n1956--January 8, Jim dies by Auca spears.\n\n(For complete story, see Through Gates of Splendor, Shadow of the Almighty, and\n\nThe Journals of Jim Elliot.)\"\n\nUnruly Affections\n\n“There was a student on campus whom I had been noticing more and more since that day in March of my junior year when I had met and talked with him. My brother Dave had been urging me to get acquainted with him ever since then, without much success. He and Dave were on the wrestling squad, so I went to a match, ostensibly to watch Dave. I found myself laughing with the crowd at Jim Elliot, the \"India-rubber man,\" who could be tied in knots but could not be pinned. I noticed Jim in the Foreign Missions Fellowship—earnest, committed to missionary service, outspoken (especially to those who were not particularly concerned about missions). I noticed him standing in dining-hall lines with little white cards in his hand, memorizing Greek verbs or Scripture verses. I heard his name read out semester after semester in the honors convocation. Finally Dave invited Jim to come home to New Jersey with us for Christmas. We had some long, long talks after the family had gone to bed. The more Jim talked, the more I saw that he fitted the picture of what I hoped for in a husband. He loved to sing hymns, and he knew dozens by heart. He loved to read poetry, loved to read it aloud. He was a real man, strong, broadchested, unaffected, friendly, and I thought, very handsome. He loved God. That was the supreme dynamic of his life. Nothing else mattered much by comparison.\"\n\n\"He was a Greek major, and so was I. After Christmas I began to hope that he would sit by me in class once in a while. He did. He sat by me often, even when at times he had to trip over other people to get the seat. Was it possible . . . ? Could he be interested . . . ? My hopes rose, but very timidly.\"\n\n\"Sunday morning in the dining hall. Because many students went off campus for weekends and many of those who stayed did not get up for breakfast on Sundays, everyone ate in one dining hall instead of three. This was my one chance of the week to see Jim at a meal, since he ate in \"Lower Williston,\" where prices were lower and, we used to say with tongue in cheek, the people humbler. I was sitting with a group of girls in \"Upper,\" just finishing my pancakes, when I glanced toward the door. Jim was coming in. He caught my eye and broke into a wide smile. I floated for the rest of the day. Jim Elliot had smiled at me.\n\nA gospel team trip to Indiana. Jim organized it and chose three men and two women to go along. I was one of them, and we were driving home long after midnight. Jim said he would need somebody to sit beside him who was not sleepy and could talk to keep him awake.\n\n\"How 'bout you, Bett?\" he said, and my heart turned over. Me, sleepy?”\n\nWe talked about the day's events, about kids who had responded to our talks on missions, and I suppose other things. I've forgotten. Then Jim recited from memory twenty-one stanzas of Rutherford's hymn, \"The Sands of Time Are Sinking.\" There was \"my\" verse, the one copied into the Omer of Manna:\n\n\"O Christ, He is the fountain, the deep, sweet well of love. ...\"\n\nOne night the buzzer sounded on my floor. This meant a phone call downstairs for somebody, but it was hardly ever for me.\n\n\"Howard!\" somebody shouted. (We often called each other by surnames in those days.)\n\nI raced down to the lounge and picked up the phone.\n\n\"Bett? Jim. How 'bout a Coke date over at the Stupe? Like to talk to you.\"\n\n\"Sure. Now?\"\n\n\"Be right over.”\n\nWe sat in a booth in the Stupe, nickname for the student recreation center. Jim gave the order, then opened his Bible. I've forgotten the reference, but I remember the talk. It was about my reticence. Jim rebuked me as a \"sister in Christ,\" urged me to be more open, more friendly. Christ could make me freer, if I'd let Him.\n\nI was hurt a little. But I was glad to see Jim's forth-rightness, glad I mattered to him, mattered enough for him to speak the truth to me faithfully. Another item on my \"checklist\"—this was the kind of man I was looking for.\n\nAsking the Lord to give me some form of specific Christian service, I learned that a group of students went regularly to Chicago on Sundays to talk about Christ to people in railroad stations. What could be more daunting?”\n\n\"Remembering Jim's admonitions in the Stupe, I determined not to be daunted. Do the thing you fear, I told myself. When I arrived at the Wheaton station to take the train to Chicago the following Sunday afternoon, who should be pacing up and down the platform in the raw wind but Jim Elliot, overcoat flying open, fedora hat at a rakish angle on the back of his head, fat Bible under his arm. Alas. I had no idea he was one of the group. He would surely think I was after him, but I could hardly back down now.\n\nNone of us took seats together on the train. We hoped for conversation with strangers en route. The fellowship we had as a group was in weekly prayer meetings on campus. One Sunday, the cars being nearly empty on the return trip, Jim threw his Bible onto the seat beside me while he took off his coat and hat. Warmth and chills ran up my spine.\"\n\n\"How did it go, Bett?\" he asked. We talked all the way back to Wheaton, and he walked to the dorm with me. Nothing we said has stayed with me except a general impression of encouragement. Maybe he saw that I had chosen what was hardest. He left with a breezy, \"See you in Greek class.\"\n\nEach encounter strengthened the suspicion that I might be falling in love with this man. A delicious feeling, but not very sensible for a woman trying to steer a straight course for the mission field, which, I thought, was supposed to be Africa or the South Seas.\n\nPrecisely how did one pour at God's feet the \"treasure store\" of one's love? Well, I promised myself, I'll find out when I really do fall in love. There's no such involvement yet.”\n\nThe First Date\n\n\"The first date Jim asked me for was to a missionary meeting at Moody Church in Chicago, late in April.\"\n\n“Not surprising that he would choose an event like this rather than a concert or dinner out. The speaker was one of the daughters of the famous missionary to Africa C. T. Studd. She told of her father's last hours. He lay on his cot, gazing around the little hut and at his few possessions. \"I wish I had something to leave to each of you/' he said to the handful of people present, \"but I gave it all to Jesus long ago.\"\n\n\"May 1,1948 — Today has been one of a strong testing.A letter came in the intercollege mail which brought me to my knees. How graciously the Lord gave 1 John 1:7, \"... if we walk in the light as he himself is in the light, then we share together a common life, and we are being cleansed from every sin by the blood of Jesus his Son.\" Hold me steadily in Thy way, for I am Thy servant.\n\nMay 2 — Spent all morning with God. Raining too hard to walk to church. It is hard to know how to deal with this new thing. I am willing to do God's will but I cannot tell if my desires are wrong and should be \"plucked out.\"\n\nMay 3— Today there was a complete committal to God.\n\nThe letter, of course, was from Jim. He confessed to having been in some way out of line on the evening of our date. It was a bit obscure to me, but I felt I might have been at fault. \"This new thing\" was the strong feeling suddenly awakened just when I had thought I was learning how to be \"asleep\" in the will of God. I was very much awake.\n\nThe Lord told King David to set up an altar on the threshing floor that belonged to Araunah the Jebusite. When the king asked Araunah if he might buy it, Araunah begged him to take it, as a gift, along with his oxen for an offering and the threshing sledges for fuel. \"No,\" said the king, \". . .I will not offer to the Lord my God whole-offerings that have cost me nothing. ...\"\n\nLord, I said, here's my heart.\n\nMay 4— More testing today. God is asking me insistently, \"Lovest thou Me?\" and I find myself evading the question. Then comes the answer, Yes, Lord. I'm conscious of the warring of the flesh and spirit — the spirit willing, the flesh weak. Evidently I need the test.\n\nHold Thou Thy cross between us, blessed Lord. Let us love Thee. To us Thy power afford To remain prostrate at Thy pierced feet — There is no other place where we may meet.\n\nSet Thou our faces as a flint of stone To do Thy will. Our goal be this alone. 0 God, our hearts are fixed. Let us not turn. Consume all our affections, let Thy love burn.\n\nMay 5— Jim and I studied together as we usually do on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays.\n\nMay 6 — Who would have guessed what a few days would bring forth? How can God work His will in me if I am clogged with wishes of my own? Thy will be done.\n\nI was certainly in a state! \"Clogged with wishes.\" I was wishing that my wishes were what God wished, and if my wishes were not what God wished, I wished that I could wish that my wishes would go away, but the wishes were still there.\n\nMay 9 — From the best bliss that earth imparts We turn unfilled to Thee again. \"Jesus, Thou Joy of Loving Hearts\" May 12 — Jim Elliot was elected president of Foreign Missions Fellowship for next year.”\n\nThe Revelation\n\n\"A settled commitment to the Lord Christ and a longed-for commitment to Jim Elliot seemed to be in conflict. Disci-pleship usually brings us into the necessity of choice between duty and desire. They are not always mutually exclusive, however. When our hearts are set on obedience, we can be sure of the needed wisdom to tell the difference between a conflict and a harmony. It may be a slow and painful process.\"\n\n\"On Memorial Day the missions fellowship had a picnic breakfast at a place called the Lagoon. When it was over, I was one of those helping to clean up. Jim was another, and of course I kept him somewhere in the corner of my eye. When everything was finished, I looked up to see him sitting on a picnic table, with two friends. Bill and Van were talking; Jim was swinging his legs and gazing at me. Everybody else had gone. He jumped off the table and ran over to where I was dumping the last load into a trash barrel.\n\n\"Walk you home?\"\n\n\"Okay. Bill and Van coming?”\n\n“They're deep into something. Let's leave 'em alone.\"\n\nWe walked half a block in silence. Then, suddenly, \"We've got to get squared away on how we feel about each other,\" Jim said. I was dumbfounded. No preliminaries, nothing. Just like that. Bang. The revelation I'd been hoping for—he had some feelings. And he was assuming that I had some. I was a little piqued at this assumption. It seemed presumption, since I thought I had done quite well at concealing my interest. The last thing I wanted was to hint in any way that I had thought twice about him—until, that is, he hinted that he was interested in me. Now what was I to say?\n\n\"Feel about each other? You mean—\"\n\n\"Come on, Bett. Don't tell me you didn't know I was in love with you?\"\n\n\"I had no idea.”\n\n“Really? But you must have! If you didn't—then all I can say is you must have thought I was a pretty nice guy. I've been knocking myself out to be near you, be nice to you, show you how I felt without actually saying anything. You mean you didn't notice?\"\n\n\"I noticed. I was afraid to believe my eyes. I told myself you couldn't possibly be interested, let alone—\"\n\n\"In love. That's what I'm telling you. Hey, we're not going to campus now. Let's go back to the Lagoon and talk this thing out.\"\n\nSeven hours later, sunburned, floating in a rainbow haze, we said good-bye on the front steps of my dormitory. I went up to my room, glad for that little \"closet\" to think in.\n\nRainbows are made of sunlight and rain. The sunlight, which turned my world into a radiance of color, was the knowledge of Jim Elliot's love. The rain was the other fact he explained to me as we sat on the grass by the Lagoon— that God was calling him to remain single. Perhaps for life, perhaps only until he had had firsthand experience in the place where he was to work as a jungle missionary. Older missionaries had told him that single men were needed to do jobs married ones could never do. There were some areas where women could not go. Jim took their word for it and committed himself to bachelorhood for as long as the will of God required.\"\n\nJune 3 — \"Whom have I in heaven but thee? and there is none upon earth that I desire beside thee.\"\n\nPsalm 73:25\n\n\"Arise ye, and depart; for this is not your rest. ...\"\n\nMicah2:10\n\n\"And the Lord spake unto Aaron, Thou shalt have no inheritance in their land.. .lam thy part and thine inheritance ...\"\n\nNumbers 18:20\n\n\"... She went after her lovers, and format me, saith the Lord.\"\n\nHosea2:13\n\n\"I will even betroth thee unto me in faithfulness: and thou shalt know the Lord.\"\n\nHosea 2:20\n\n\"I have set the Lord always before me ... \"\n\nPsalm 16:8\n\n\"Thou wilt shew me the path of life ...\"\n\nPsalm 16:11\n\n“Hold up my going in thy paths, that my footsteps slip not. \"\n\nPsalm 17:5\n\n\"I was very cautious about what I put in the journals. I don't think it was because I feared someone else would discover my secrets. I think I was afraid to articulate, even for myself, feelings I might have to get rid of. Better to stick with what God was saying to me than what my heart was saying. It seemed the safer course. I do not repudiate it now. The only way to build a house on the rock is to hear the Word (I couldn't have heard it if all I listened to was my feelings) and then to try to do it. The collection of verses in the above journal entry represents warnings and aspirations that shaped my thinking. Admittedly they are not in context, but I believe God gave them to me to show certain aspects of the truth at the time. The Holy Spirit was given to guide us into all truth, but He doesn't do it all at once.”\n\nDoes God Notice?\n\n\"Thou shalt know Him when He comes Not by any din of drums, Nor the vantage of His airs, Nor by anything He wears, Neither by His crown nor His gown. For His presence known shall be By the holy harmony Which His coming makes in thee.\n\nIn the days following our talk at the Lagoon I prayed for that holy harmony. It seemed impossible that the torrent of passion could be brought into the calm river of God's purposes for Jim or for me, but I prayed for it anyway.\n\nWe had sat on the grass by the lake and talked of how each had agonized over the question of singleness, knowing that our chances of finding a mate in missionary work would be strictly limited. Jim said he had no intention of looking for one. He had found the one he wanted.\n\n\"If I marry, I know who it'll be. That is, of course, if she'll have me.\" He flashed his famous smile. I smiled in reply. He hastened to add, \"But I'm not asking. I can't do that, Bett, and you'll have to understand that. I can't ask you to marry me, and I can't ask you to commit yourself to anything whatever. I can't even ask you to wait. I've given you and all my feelings for you to God. He'll have to work out whatever He wants.\"\n\nCould He? My mind was full of questions. I thanked God for a man who put Him first. I could not have gotten terribly excited about one whose spiritual hunger did not parallel my own. But Jim was not just spiritual. He was very physical. He had a wrestler's build—strong neck, barrel chest, muscular arms and legs. He had brown hair, fair skin, blue eyes, beautiful teeth, and a good square jaw.\n\n\"I'm hungry for you, Bett,\" he had said. He was not one to beat about the bush. \"We're alike in our desire for God. I'm glad for that. But we're different, too. I've got the body of a man, and you've got the body of a woman, and frankly, I want you. But you're not mine.\"\n\nNot his. God's. That much was clear. But what was God going to do about all this? Was He interested in the plight of two college kids? Had our cause perhaps escaped His notice? Would He bother with us, when He was busy with who knew how many worlds?\n\nWho had gauged the waters in the palm of his hand,\n\nor with its span set limits to the heavens?\n\nWho has held all the soil of earth in a bushel,\n\nor weighed the mountains on a balance and the hills on a pair of scales? . . .\n\nDo you not know, have you not heard,\n\nwere you not told long ago,\n\nhave you not perceived ever since the world began,\n\nthat God sits throned on the vaulted roof of earth,\n\nwhose inhabitants are like grasshoppers? . . .\n\nLift up your eyes to the heavens; consider who created it all,\n\nled out their host one by one and called them all by their names;\n\nthrough his great might, his might and power,\n\nnot one is missing.\n\nNot a star, not a planet, not a meteorite or a quasar, no, not even a black hole or a black dwarf is missing. God made them. He knows their names, knows exactly where they belong. Can He keep track of us?”\n\n“Why do you complain, O Jacob,\n\nand you, Israel, why do you say, \"My plight is hidden from the Lord, and my cause has passed out of God's notice\"? Do you not know, have you not heard? The Lord, the everlasting God, creator of the wide world,\n\ngrows neither weary nor faint;\n\nno man can fathom his understanding. He gives vigour to the weary, new strength to the exhausted. Young men may grow weary and faint, even in their prime they may stumble and fall-but those who look to the Lord will win new strength, they will grow wings like eagles; they will run and not be weary, they will march on and never grow faint.”\n\nHolding Pattern\n\n“I began to learn to wait. Patient waiting does not come naturally to most of us, but a great deal is said about it in the Bible. It is an important discipline for anyone who wants to learn to trust.\n\nJune 9,1948 — \"Lead me in thy truth, and teach me: for thou art the God of my salvation; on thee do I wait all the day.\"\n\nPsalm 25:5\n\nTo wait on the Lord is to stand perfectly still. . . . Can we two trust His words, \"Is not the Lord your God with you? and hath he not given you rest on every side? ...\"\n\n1 Chronicles 22:18\n\nLast night I read chapter 43 in Windows by Amy Carmichael: \"Bare heights of loneliness ...a wilderness whose burning winds sweep over glowing sands, what are they to Him? Even there He can refresh us, even there He can renew us.”\n\n“It was on the evening of the same day, June 9, that Jim and I walked out to a cemetery and sat down on a stone slab. I told him I did not think it would help us much in discerning God's direction if we started right in on a heavy correspondence. Wouldn't it make more sense to \"cool it\"? Not that we used that expression in those days, but it says what I meant. To allow for the perspective that both distance and silence could give might help us to see the whole thing with cool reason.\n\nJim thought that over for a few minutes. Then he spoke of the story he had read in his Bible study that morning— the story of Abraham's offering up of the most precious thing in his life: his son Isaac. \"So I put you on the altar,\" he said.\n\nSlowly we became aware that the moon, which had risen behind us, was casting the shadow of a stone cross on the slab between us.\n\nWe were silent for a very long time, pondering this undeniable sign. What Abraham did was the ancient prelude to the full revelation of the love of God. The readiness to give up his son and the rewards promised because of it—again, the central truth of the Cross was brought to us in a strange and mysterious manner. When the silence became heavy, Jim said, \"And what is to be done with the ashes?\" Time would show.\"\n\n“Waiting silently is the hardest thing of all. I was dying to talk to Jim and about Jim. But the things that we feel most deeply we ought to learn to be silent about, at least until we have talked them over thoroughly with God.”\n\n“Three days before my graduation, Jim and I spent the afternoon in a little park in Glen Oak, Illinois. We talked very little, enjoyed the sun, flowers, lake, birds, and insects. I am sure my heart was full to bursting with things I wanted to say (things like, \"I love you, I can't live without you. How can you do this? I can't bear it,\" and all the rest of the desperate phrases women always want to say). I refrained, but it was all I could do. I am sure it was good for me to refrain. \"Never pass up an opportunity to keep your mouth shut\" is a good rule that harmonizes with Scripture,\"... Keep your mouth shut and show your good sense.\" \". . . The man who talks too much meets his deserts,\" and \"When men talk too much, sin is never far away; common sense holds its tongue.\" Finding a mutual appreciation of sun, lake, and birds was a safe kind of communication for us that afternoon. God's time for further revelations of the heart might come later. Tomorrow was not our business; it was His. Letting it rest with Him was the discipline for the day, and it was enough.”\n\nMaterial for Sacrifice\n\n\"A couple of days remained before Jim and I were to part. My family came for my graduation, and I had to make choices between going to various events with them or going for a walk with Jim. Sometimes they won. Sometimes he did. One more trip to the Lagoon. \"It's going to be hard/' he said. \"Harder than we'd like to think.\" Then the next night, a Sunday, no time for a long walk to the Lagoon. Only a field near the campus, where we sat on a blanket while dew fell and ruined my hair. \"Man, your hair sure went straight!\" he said, just when I was hoping he would not notice. I think this evening was the first time Jim touched me. He ran the back of his finger down my cheek. A small gesture, big with meaning. I thought of it a thousand times afterwards.\"\n\n\"The loneliness itself is material for sacrifice. The very longings themselves can be offered to Him who understands perfectly. The transformation into something He can use for the good of others takes place only when the offering is put into His hands. What will He do with these offerings? Never mind. He knows what to do.\n\nGraduation was in the morning. In the afternoon Jim drove me to the railroad station in Chicago to catch the Texas Chief. I wanted him to kick over all the traces, grab me in a rib-cracking embrace, and kiss me without taking a breath till the train started to pull away. That was what one part of me wanted. Another part said no.\n\nIt was a long night en route to Oklahoma. Springfield, Kansas City, Wichita. How many stops in between? I woke at each, trying to calculate how far I was from Jim now, picturing him sleeping soundly (dreaming, perhaps?) in the guest room of his aunt's house, where he was to spend several weeks before going home to Oregon. I had copied a poem by Alice Meynell in a notebook. I took it out from time to time, until I had it memorized:\n\nLet this goodbye of ours, this last goodbye, Be still and splendid like a forest tree . . . Let there be one grand look within our eyes Built of the wonderment of the past years, Too vast a thing of beauty to be lost In quivering lips and burning floods of tears.\n\nAt least Jim hadn't seen the quivering lips or the tears. After we shook hands (clasped hands would be more accurate), he stood there while I walked down the platform, almost the whole length of the train, to the car where my seat was. I waved to him in the distance as I boarded.\"\n\nLittle Deaths\n\n\"The University of Oklahoma, where I studied linguistics, has an enormous stadium. Nothing was happening there during the summer, so I often climbed to the top row of bleachers, following supper, to enjoy whatever breeze there might be after the day's scorching heat, and to watch those sensational Oklahoma sunsets. It was a lovely place to be alone to think, read, and pray.\n\nI was disturbed to find that I could not think, read, or pray except about Jim Elliot. He loomed in every thought, every line I read in the Bible or anywhere else. He got mixed up in the morphology, syntax, and phonetics I was stuffing into my head. He distracted my prayers. It is a good thing the Lord has compassion on all who fear Him, knows how we are made, and remembers we are only dust. He loved us both, knew exactly how we loved each other, and used even the detours to bring us home again. Someone once observed that the toothache you have this very minute is the worst pain in the world. Lovesickness may seem a trifle compared with other maladies, but the one who is sick with love is sick indeed, and the Heavenly Father understands that. He steadily draws us along the pathway to glory, if our deepest heart is set on His kingdom, if we are not of those whom Psalm 78:8 describes as \"a generation with no firm purpose, with hearts not fixed steadfastly on God.\"\n\n\"Jim's brother Bert was a student at the university with me. In chapel sometimes I would suddenly catch a glimpse of his profile—so like Jim's. After supper we would take turns playing the piano and teaching each other favorite hymns in the dining hall. He sang as Jim sang—heartily, unabashedly, a good man's voice with no affectations. His presence was a constant reminder of Jim.\"\n\n\"When the will of God crosses the will of man/' Addison Leitch said, \"somebody has to die/' Life requires countless \"little\" deaths—occasions when we are given the chance to say no to self and yes to God. The Apostle Paul said, \"For continually, while still alive, we are being surrendered into the hands of death, for Jesus' sake....\" It is not that everything that has anything to do with ourselves is in itself wicked and deserving of death. It did not mean that when Jesus said, \"Not my will. ...\" There could not have been even the smallest part of His will that was wicked. It was a choice to lay down everything—the good He had done and the good He might do if He was permitted to live—for the love of God. The same choice is offered to us. The see Bert's profile, hear him sing; to contemplate the blessedness of marriage as I watched couples who were taking the same course at the university; to call up in memory the sweet anguish of those hours by the Lagoon; to picture Jim's face as we said good-bye at Union Station—only \"little deaths,\" but little deaths have to be died just as great ones do. Every reminder that aroused a longing had to be offered up.”\n\n“......We're created men and women. If Adam needed Eve and she was made for him, isn't it natural, then, isn't it altogether fitting and proper, that men and women should hunger for each other?\n\nIt is natural indeed. However, it's not the only thing God has in mind for us. We are not meant to live merely by what is natural. We need to learn to live by the supernatural. Ordinary fare will not fill the emptiness in our hearts. Bread will not suffice. We need extraordinary fare. We need manna. How else will we learn to eat it, if we are never hungry? How will we educate our tastes for heavenly things if we are surfeited with earthly? Sex simply will not suffice any more than bread will.”\n\n“My heart was saying, \"Lord, take away this longing, or give me that for which I long.\" The Lord was answering, \"I must teach you to long for something better.\"\n\n\"... He fed you on manna which neither you nor your fathers had known before, to teach you that man cannot live on bread alone but lives by every word that comes from the mouth of the Lord.\"\n\nGod knew that giving me Jim when I wanted him would not provide the far more important training I needed for things to come. It was in learning to eat that Living Bread, sufficient always for one day at a time (not in advance for the five years I feared) that I was taught and disciplined and prepared for later things.”\n\nNobody Knows the Trouble\n\n“I was not strong in myself. If I had never known that before—but of course I had—I became acutely conscious of it through loving and missing and desperately needing Jim. It was a kind of weakness that surprised and humiliated me. Why should I need him? \"Got along without him before I met him, gonna get along without him now,\" to paraphrase an old song. I wasn't doing very well without him, and here was another lesson. When there is real weakness, especially of the kind that surprises and humiliates us, it is our opportunity to learn what Paul had to learn through his \"thorn\": the grace of God is all we need, for \"... power comes to its full strength in weakness. ...\"\n\n\"My prayers were something like this:\n\nFor my loneliness, Lord—Your strength. For my temptation to self-pity, Lord—Your strength. For my uncontrollable longings for this man, Lord— Your strength.\"\n\nA Letter at Last\n\n\"When our paths, to my immense joy, crossed in September of 1948, Jim told me he felt that God had given the liberty to start a correspondence. We talked again about marriage, puzzling over the thought that for us it might amount to an admission that Christ was not sufficient. This idea came out of Jim's reading of 1 Corinthians 7:37, \"But if a man is steadfast in his purpose, being under no compulsion, and has complete control of his own choice; and if he has decided in his own mind to preserve his partner in her virginity, he will do well/' Jim had underlined in the hymnal he had given me the hymn, \"Have I an object, Lord, below, which would divide my heart with Thee?\" If marriage was not to be for us, then Christ was going to have to suffice. If with Himself He was going to give us marriage also, then we would receive it as His gift. The thing about gifts is that they are not asked for, but given, freely and out of love. It seemed too good a thing to hope for, but we hoped.”\n\n“As the train took me to Bible school in Alberta, Canada, I was reading the Book of Colossians as we crossed the bleak prairie of North Dakota—God's great secret, Christ in you; warnings about forced piety, self-mortification, severity to the body. How could I tell if this was what I was guilty of? Often during that school year our principal, L. E. Maxwell, would say, \"The hardest thing in the world is—,\" and he would let the students finish it: \"to keep balanced.\" I was finding that true.\n\nOn October 4, 1948, the girl who delivered the mail in the dormitory slipped the first letter from Jim under the door. I opened it with shaking fingers. I was hoping he would begin with \"Dearest Bett,\" but he took refuge in the single ministerial word, \"Beloved.\" The letter was typewritten, which made it seem impersonal and also caused me to wonder if he would be filing carbon copies.”\n\n“It's hard to pull out of the nebulae that has collected in thinking about this letter some clever point with which to impress you right off, so I won't attempt it, but proceed as if I had been writing in my present capacity for a good long time. Got your card Wednesday afternoon. Clever, devas-tatingly so. [The card said only, \"Miss you. Bett.\"]\n\nI wish I had a \"feel-o-meter\" to transcribe what has been going on inside for the last few days. It began with that word I think I spoke to you of when we were together in the chapel that last morning: trembling.\n\nAnd what should a tuffy like me be trembling about? Three things: you, me, and God. You: I tremble to think that my forwardness in declaring my feeling to you is actually affecting your entire life. I have an idea that it will be almost impossible to discern the Lord's mind for you without your struggling through a maze of thought and feeling about me. You must know a bit of this already in putting in an application to a mission board in Africa. And what if, in a real test, your feeling should overcome your faith? Whose then the responsibility? Not entirely yours. For this I fear, that I, stepping out of the path of the Lord for just a moment, should draw you with me and thus be accountable for the \"loss\" of two lives.\n\nMe: I cannot for the life of me understand my heart. Somewhere down deep in the murky pools of consciousness there is a great monster whom I will name \"Want\" just for now. This is the only constant thing about me: desire. Much to Freud's consternation I cannot name it \"sex urge,\" for I have found that such will not glut the maw of the brute; he demands more of a varied diet, and one not so easily obtained as that, either. I am very thankful that the Buddhist Nirvana is not the apex of the spiritual life, or I should be the least spiritual of all men, if absolute satiation were the ideal. The brute is not the spirit or the soul, least of all is he the body. Rather, he is the ME that talks about these other things, argues about them, laughs and asks for more. He is Life. He is submerged down there a-lusting after something he can't name. The nearest he can get to it is with the word God. And God feeds him when I allow it. Silly, isn't it? For who, then, am \"I\"? Well, I didn't intend that this should run into metaphysics, but what I want to say is that there is within a hunger after God, given of God, filled by God. I can only be happy when I am conscious that He is doing what He wills to do within. What makes me tremble is that I might allow something else (you, for example) to take the place that my God should have. Now something tells me that I can, maybe, have them both. I am not averse to this, understand. I only tremble that I should think wrongly in supposing that you are one of the ways in which God intends to come in.\n\nGod: or better, the Lord Jesus. I tremble lest I should in any way offend my Eternal Lover. And whatever passes between us let us take note of this: All shall be revoked at His command. I am such a great, cumbersome boor to be \"dove driven.\" Oh, how delicate are the tuggings of my Beloved, and how calloused my responses. Above all else I will that He might find in me the travail of His soul and be satisfied. But this is a hard thing when I speak to you, for somehow, the pleasing Him and the getting you are in conflict. I don't pretend to explain it; I can only describe what I feel—and that not very adequately.\n\nSince you left it has been as if a film has been over my soul. My genuine fervor in prayer was gone for two days. Too much rubble so that I couldn't get to building the wall. See Nehemiah 4:10 for this. Notice, it was not the outward opposers that hindered the work so much as the inward clutter. Not \"destruction\" from outside forces so much as \"decay\" within. But the proof of God's hand comes in the affirmative answer to Sanballat's mocking in verse 2. \"Will they revive the stones out of the heaps of rubbish which are burned?\" The zealous Jews did. Apply this to us and imagine a little while. Are we willing to build with a trowel in one hand while our other hand grasps the sword? The building (God's work) must go on, and if there is to be battle as we build, very well, let us strengthen the \"lower places\" (v. 13). And I say to you the words of Nehemiah to the nobles, \"The work is great... we are separated. . . . God shall fight for us\" (vv. 19, 20).\n\nI must confess to you, Bett, that I have had regrets about going even as far as we did in physical contact, and that was very little as most judge. We must guard against this if we are ever together again, for it gave me a whetted appetite for your body that I have found to be \"rubble\" in getting to the work. You must be hard on me in this; I know we do not have the same mind or makeup, and I feel that I need more of yours than you need of mine. Nietzsche has a word for us here: \"One must discontinue being feasted upon when one tasteth best; that is known by all who want to be long loved.\" Do you get what he means by this: \"Far too long hath there been a slave and a tyrant concealed in woman. On that account woman is not capable of friendship: she knoweth only love\"? This is what I found in Billy—neither a worshiper (though he loved me) nor an overlord (though he was most esteemed). We met as equal dogs at the feet of the Omnipotent. I would have it this way with you and me. Fear not to hurt me with the Living Sword, yea strike to this purpose. Be more than a lover—be a friend. We spoke of this at the moonrising tryst. \"Love one another, as I have loved you.\" Remember?\n\nBut how shall I praise the Lord for removing the film this very morning? Confession is good for the soul; it was imperative for mine this morning. I cast it all upon him and John's truth about \"cleansing from all sin\" was very precious. Oh, how sweetly He \"preached peace\" to one that was far off (Ephisians 2:13, 17) . . . Nearness was the theme of my song and the thoughts seem well expressed in #136, Little Flock hymnal. The vail is rent, our souls draw near - / Unto a throne of grace; / The merits of the Lord appear, / They fill the holy place.\n\nOh, Betts, let us 'undistracted be' in our following.\n\nJust to show you what a poor journalist I am, I will quote my time in composition of this letter: two hours. Part of it due to typing, I'm sure.\n\nHave you been delivered after the fashion of Psalm 116:8, \"Thou hast delivered my soul from death, mine eyes from tears, and my feet from falling\"?\n\nTenderly, Jim”\n\nWhetted Appetites\n\n“The physical contact Jim referred to was my taking his arm when we walked, our sitting with shoulders tightly pressed together, and on one occasion as we sat on a park bench his suddenly stretching out on his back with his head in my lap. My fingers entwined his hair.\n\nChaste means \"not indulging in unlawful sexual activity.\" Who would accuse us of having done so?\n\nWe were trying to live honestly before God, not before any worldly tribunal. Our Christian contemporaries were necking in cars (scrunching was the current word in our college), holding hands on campus, kissing in the dormitory lounges. When speakers came to campus, the question students always asked was where to draw the line, how far could they go?\n\nWe recognized that we were strongly drawn toward each other. There were \"butterflies\" when we were near. Those perfectly human, perfectly natural appetites were being whetted with every slightest touch, and the idea of a good long scrunch or even a single short kiss seemed like heaven itself.\n\nHonesty required us to admit that we could not be sure precisely where the \"line\" should be drawn, and it was a potentially unmanageable force we were dealing with. Chastity meant for us not taking lightly any least act or thought that was not appropriate to the kind of commitment we had to God.”\n\nA \"Small\" Sin\n\n\"He gave me freedom to write if I pleased—for me, there is no sin in it,\" wrote Jim a few weeks after we had begun our correspondence, when I, as usual, was full of misgivings as to whether we did right.\n\nSo long as my conscience remained pure toward God in relation to you, the Spirit freed me to write as I pleased. But, in this, my liberty may have now become license in carrying things too far for you to endure, should our relation be cut off. I am ready now to renounce our correspondence if my liberty has come to its end in imposing itself upon you with harmful results. Now I feel it is your place to precipitate discontinuance. You know best what our writing is doing to you. My answer from the Lord about marriage or engagement is now a decided no so long as present circumstances prevail, with no conditions as to what might happen when and if they change. Can you afford to continue to feed a growing love which may be cut off without any fulfillment at some future time? One word from you will settle it.\"\n\nThe word from me was that we would keep on writing. Jim's freedom freed me.\n\nA strange thing happened during Jim's senior year in college. He called it his Renaissance—a new openness to social life, friendships with people he did not consider specially \"spiritual,\" the freedom to date if he felt like dating, and a great deal of clowning, giving vent to his native flair for acting and mimicry. I heard of it secondhand and was offended. What had happened to him?\n\nA psychologist could explain it easily no doubt. Jim's explanation was simply that the Lord had liberated him from some old restraints, enabling him to reach out, break barriers, enjoy things. He admitted that he carried it too far. There were some \"kissing incidents\" reported to me in letters from other students. I asked him about those, and he answered,\n\nI stood there, said and did as you have been told, entirely in the flesh. And the same \"me\" wrote of \"purity in love.\" You may judge which, whether flesh or spirit, prompted me in this latter. For the fact that it has blackened my conscience, hurt you, stumbled others, and brought dishonor to Christ, I now experience overwhelming sorrow. The act, the effect of it, the regret for it shall be consumed by the flashing of my Judge's eye, and I shall suffer loss. There's an end of it, and a costly one.\n\nThe notion was not a new one—that the relationship that means most in a man's life is governed by far stricter principles than the casual ones. Because the girls he had kissed did not \"mean anything\" to him, he took it lightly at first. I didn't. I had expected perfection in Jim or at least the strength of consistency. I did not find it, nor did he, of course, find either perfection or consistency in me, but he repented.\n\nI do not know the tearful repentance I should like to for having wandered and caused others to stray as I did. Dr. Brooks [the dean] is right in saying that I have much to regret in seriously looking over the past year. But with that statement I must also say I have tremendous thanksgiving to God at the same moment. Impossible, you say? Very well, but that is how it stands. I have confessed to God, to the senior class, to the Foreign Missions Fellowshipers, to you, to other individuals. And I am eased. If there is more that I must do, I stand ready for reproof. Do you expect yet more of me?\n\nWhat more could I expect? Jim Elliot was a man. Men are sinners. That was the simple truth. He was my ideal, but I had to come to terms with the truth. He had disappointed me. Hadn't I disappointed him many times?\n\n\"If we claim to be sinless, we are self-deceived and strangers to the truth. If we confess our sins, he is just, and may be trusted to forgive our sins and cleanse us from every kind of wrong; but if we say we have committed no sin, we make him out to be a liar, and then his word has no place in us. . . . Jesus Christ. ... is himself the remedy for the defilement of our sins. ...\"\n\nA Cave and a Driftwood Fire\n\nJim's next letter began with an original poem.\n\nAnd dost Thou hear the silence of my heart, Lord; Canst Thou count the tears that never reach my eyes? And these yearnings, which will not fit my words, Lord; Wilt Thou feed this hidden hunger— Desire, spawned of the Spirit, which somehow fails to rise?\n\n\"Yea, Soul, Eternity has tuned my ear to silence, My own heart brims with tears now long unshed; The quiet sanctuary of unspoken reverence Is my dwelling place of old; And in the deeps of spirit have I made my bed.\"\n\nA whole year went by before I saw Jim again. We corresponded, but not often. I finished the Bible school course, and he finished college in June of 1949. I went to work with the Canadian Sunday School Mission, in an out-of-the-way place in Alberta's bush country, called Patience. I had need of Patience. Jim sent me Isaiah 59:9: \". . . We look for light but all is darkness, for the light of dawn, but we walk in deep gloom.\"\n\nHis mother wrote in August to invite me to stop in Portland on my way home from Alberta. The diary is full of misgivings and assurances—it's wrong to go; it's okay to go; God is leading; no, it's my own determination to get a glimpse of Jim. Should I take the money my parents had sent me as a \"sign\"? What about the letter from Mrs. Elliot? Would Jim be really glad if I went, or would it put pressure on him ... and on and on. I accepted and took a Greyhound bus.\n\nFrom Seattle I sat next to a sailor who was as eager to read a book as I was, so there was no chitchat until we were near Portland. He looked at me and said, \"I've never seen anybody sit so still. You haven't moved a muscle the whole trip. Scared or something?\" I was sick with anticipation. When the bus arrived in the station, there was no one to meet me. I wandered around, my worst fears seeming to materialize. Then there he was, standing at the wrong place, scanning the incoming buses. His back was toward me. I stopped, wondering what to do or say. Something made him turn, and he broke into the old grin. \"Hi, Betts.\"\n\nThe first few days were spent attending meetings at the Gospel Hall. It was the annual Labor Day conference, and the Elliot men were very much in view on the platform as speakers, at the back managing things, milling around as hosts. We had little time for talk until it was over, when we went to Mount Tabor Park. We sat on the grass. Here it comes, I thought. But again it was Isaiah 59:9. Still looking for light. Still no word as to whether God might have \"changed His mind.\" Why should I have entertained such a foolish hope? Well, because I couldn't help hoping against hope.\n\nI helped Jim's mother with the laundry one morning, and as she was hauling the sheets out of the machine she suddenly said, \"I know these Elliot men. They can never make up their minds. If I were you I'd tell Jim it's now or never.\"\n\nI knew very well what Jim's answer would be: never. I would just as soon leave myself room for hoping. I felt annoyed at her advice. She was putting Jim in the same box with the rest of them, his father and two brothers. I was trying hard to believe that he had a better reason than merely being unable to make up his mind. His mother shook my confidence.\n\nWe went to Oregon's magnificent coast for a day. We walked down through the thick fir forest to an isolated cove where we explored sea caves and swam in the frigid Pacific. We built a driftwood fire. Sitting close together, watching the sun sink into the gleaming sea, the temptation to express ourselves, to do what we felt like doing, was nearly overwhelming. Because the final choice had been made long before, by the grace of God we were not overwhelmed.\n\nI write this for one reason. To show that it is possible for two young people, full of all the juices that youth is endowed with by the Creator, to resist temptation.\n\nThey can't do it unless they have a motive that makes it worthwhile.\n\nThey can't do it alone.\n\n“If you feel sure that you are standing firm, beware! You may fall. So far you have faced no trial beyond what man can bear. God keeps faith, and he will not allow you to be tested above your powers, but when the test comes he will at the same time provide a way out, by enabling you to sustain it.\"\n\nHe enabled us.\n\nA word of warning here. It is not a good idea to go into caves or to sit by driftwood fires in lonely places if you are not yet sure of your God. Paul advised the young Timothy to \"turn from the wayward impulses of youth. . . .\" Don't walk straight into them and then blame God if the temptation is too great for you.\n\nHis Sublime Keeping\n\nNearly a year after I saw Jim on my way to Canada, we had two days together in Illinois. He was best man in my brother Dave's wedding, and I was a bridesmaid. We had a few hours alone that evening, then another year of separation. In 1951 Jim and his missionary colleague-to-be, Pete Fleming, came east to speak in churches that were to assume part of their support. Into his crowded schedule we managed to squeeze a picnic in the New Jersey pines, a lunch at Wanamaker's Tea Room in Philadelphia (I remember the pink mayonnaise on my salad), and a day in New York. We met for breakfast at what seemed to us a fancy hotel. The waiter brought tiny cups of scalding hot coffee when he brought the menus. This, we felt, must be the ultimate touch of class. We went to Radio City Music Hall and saw the film American in Paris and late that evening stood atop a tall building, leaning on a parapet, looking at the lights of the city, longing, again, for what we could not have. Jim hinted then that he was beginning to believe that God was going to allow us to be together someday. I waited, trembling with hope that the Great Revelation had been given, but it was the same story. No green light.\n\nA page from my journal of that time quotes from T. C. Upham's Inward Divine Guidance: \"The disposition ... to leave the dearest objects of our hearts in the sublime keeping of the general and unspecific belief that God is now answering our prayers in His own time and way, and in the best manner, involves a present process of inward crucifixion which is obviously unfavorable to the growth and even the existence of the life of self.”\n\nWhen the meetings were over, my brother Phil and his wife, Margaret, took the three of us—Jim, Pete, and me— to our family vacation home in New Hampshire. It was mid-October, too late for the glorious autumn colors of the rock maples and the sweet gum trees. Winter had closed in for good, and the old house, Gale Cottage, was frigid without central heating. We spent the days hiking the White Mountains—Bald Mountain and Artist's Bluff, through the Flume and then up to lovely little Lonesome Lake on the side of Cannon Mountain. These mountains were tame to Jim and Pete, who only a few weeks before had \"done\" Rainier, Adams, and St. Helens. But they were hearty in their appreciation of an older, milder beauty.\n\nOne very gray day we took the Ammonoosuc Trail up to Lake-of-the-Clouds on Mount Washington and descended by a steep, rocky trail that threaded alongside a rushing mountain stream. Jim stopped to let the others go by and pointed out to me that again and again the water was separated into two streams by an interrupting rock, but came together at last in a deep, calm pool. An allegory for us, he said.\n\nIn the evenings we all huddled around the fire, toasting marshmallows, drinking hot chocolate, while Peter read poetry aloud. The others were gallant in going up early to the arctic bedrooms, leaving Jim and me to talk late and watch the embers die.\n\nIn a letter written a few weeks afterwards, Jim wrote:\n\nI wonder if you were conscious of averting your eyes in many of those fireside sessions, when I looked straight into them. One time in particular I remember—you rolled your head clear away to look into the fire when I wanted to face you. Please don't! I love the look of you. I'm glad I love more in you than looks, so that if I went stone blind I would still have love, but your looks are not disconnected from it. Love you for love's sake only? Not exactly. For love's sake, yes, but for dozens of other things, too, not the least of which is every dear remembrance of your face. The grace of your forehead, the clearness of your eyes . . . \"but oh, that carven mouth with all its deep intensity of longing...!\"\n\nImpatience\n\n\"Nothing was harder for a woman in love to endure and nothing was stronger proof of the character of the man Jim Elliot than his restraint of power.\"\n\nI Have You Now Unravished\n\n\"Near the end of October, 1951, Jim came for a last day or two to my family's house in Moorestown, New Jersey. Somebody took the first photograph we ever had taken together. I was wearing an ill-fitting, dark green suit, Jim a double-breasted blue one. We stood under the apple tree in the backyard and smiled as though there were no need at all of that prayer for the reinforcing of our wills or for quietness and steadfastness.\n\nWe drove the twelve miles or so to the railroad station in Philadelphia, stopping once near the Camden Airport to pray and cry.\n\nJim had one more stop to make for meetings. Then, seated in the dining car en route to Chicago, he wrote:\n\nEvery minute of the weekend was crammed full with sightseeing, visiting, studying, and meetings. And all the while I have been unable to think for five minutes without being interrupted by thoughts of you. Your face died with consciousness as I went off to sleep and rose as I woke. Images, attitudes, phrases, looks, embraces, hailed me out of the past few weeks and I nearly succumbed to think that it is not to be again for years, perhaps. I am nearer tears this morning than I have been all weekend. Remembrance of what you said about missing me on waking came as dawn broke this morning, and I thought of you with your slender, white, and empty arms there in a warm bed. This may be a phase—the sort of thing Pete wished me a speedy recovery from. I hope in a way that it is, but as yet it intensifies and shows no sign of let-up. There is no need to analyze. I love you, Betty, and feel it keenly this morning. I'll not forget your clear, wide eyes vanishing at the station on Saturday. The unfeeling lackey who tugged me back on the platform and shouted, \"Watch out for the stairs!\" and slammed the cover, cut me out of a pleasure— that of seeing your eyes grow smaller and smaller until they disappeared. I had no tears.\n\nFrom California, a few weeks later:\n\nWoke early again this morning and shared my devotions with dreams of you. It bothers me somewhat that you are on my mind when I ought to be praying, and it's a discipline not to indulge overmuch in remembering. Not that I feel a conflict—I am assured that loving you is part of my life now—important as eating, and God knows, I need it.\n\n. . . she watched\n\nBeside my pillow, told me when I woke\n\nFrom the fruition of celestial love\n\nTo drink in, like a thirsty traveler,\n\nThe sweetness of her human love once more:—\n\nNever so sweet as now. They sin who deem\n\nThere can be discord betwixt love and love.\n\nEdward Henry Bickersteth \"Yesterday\"\n\nWhen he reached home in Portland from California, he wrote:\n\nI thank my God. Life has been made so much the fuller for His giving me you. I was recounting today as we rolled the last three hundred miles up from Klamath Falls how rich, how full (I can't find a better word!) He has made life for me. Sealike, but having no ebb, no not at my fingertips! Nature, Body, Soul, Friendship, Family—all full for me, and then, what many have not, the capacity to enjoy. \"And He said, 'Lacked ye anything?' they said, 'Nothing.'\" Part of me was lacking until this now—oh, I needed you, neither of us knew how sorely! And even now, though I don't have you in the fullest sense, still I do, in a sense I will not when we have known each other.\n\nI'm glad that last is still ahead. Glad I'm not jaded by nights in bed with you, as married couples are. They can bear to sit at opposite sides of the car. I'm glad I still can't quite keep my hands off you, still must be warned not to \"muss you up.\" I have you now unravished, and that is just how I need you now. The schoolboy in me still wonders and is awkward—we've not had \"experience\"—which takes the edge off. We will, I suppose, get used to each other, the feel and smell and look of one another, but I am glad it is not so now. As I never felt before, I feel now that I must keep myself for you. God knows it is a stay to purity, and He knows how many shakings to purity are ahead.\"\n\nHold God to His Bargain\n\nIn January of 1952 Jim was still at home, making last preparations for his sailing to Ecuador in February. I was living in a sleazy fifth-floor walk-up in Brooklyn, New York, trying to learn some Spanish. Things had happened in the previous six months that pointed me away from Africa and the South Seas toward Ecuador. Jim encouraged me, though we knew rumors would fly and I would be accused of chasing him.\n\nHe wrote more frequently now, often skirting very close to and occasionally mentioning the subject of love.\n\nI think that the realism of the Old Testament should make us aware of God's approval of human love. So carelessly we read, \"Jacob loved Rachel,\" and so casually it is stated \"she conceived and brought forth a son and called his name ...\" that we forget all that is behind the words, all the tremendous feeling and emotion, ache and satisfaction which the very directness of the narrative tends to subdue. But it is there! It has to be. Well, if it is for us, Bett, we have yet cause for greater praise. For now, let us not slack in being thankful. We have our reasons.\n\nOn February 2, late at night, Jim telephoned from San Pedro, California. This was the first time we had ever spoken by long-distance telephone. Ordinary folks didn't do much of that in those days. I trembled when I heard his voice, shook when I heard him say he loved me. My voice shook, I’m sure, in answer to his “question, \"Do you love me?\" I had not meant to tell him, but I had to be truthful. \"I can hardly help myself,\" was my answer. He said goodbye. He was sailing next day.\n\nAs soon as he hung up he wrote me another letter.\n\nFebruary 2, 1952. Your voice didn't sound just like I wanted it to—not close enough, and I couldn't hear the quiet aside-laughter. But I thank the Lord for the good feeling of hearing it at all. We talked nine minutes! Surprised? I was. I have to laugh at myself—playing unimpressed all day, hardly able to think through the thunder of my own pulse when I actually hear you. This is the stalwart celibate on his way to Ecuador? I suppose you sensed the same, but no one could tell, watching you. Funny pair, we two, being so different in everyone else's eyes, but so like the race in love. Aren't you glad you \"can't help yourself\"?\n\nLast night in a dream you were more alive than ever— just your face, near and inviting. Oh, how did I resist kissing you before now?\n\nFebruary 7, 1952. I am seated, shirtless, in our green-toned stateroom, having just finished lunch and a cursory promenade about the deck. Generally, I am possessed of a sense of ease, animated at times with sheer joy at the whole situation. Aboard here we are filled with an abundance which touches the edge of profligacy. Enough becomes too much. For lunch I had oxheart, squash, green peas, and cold buttermilk. Last night it was lamb curry and rice, and yesterday noon roast beef. Before that the memory jumbles, but black cod formed a part of it and the jumble on the whole entirely pleasing.\n\nYour \"sense of loss\" at our not being able to share things these past few months is not new to me. I know it, and often tell Him about it. And such thoughts as \"If Thy dear home be fuller, Lord ...\" [from Amy Carmichael] are a consolation. And then the realistic facing of nonaccom-plishment comes to me and crushes to silence all telling. For if, really, we have denied ourselves to and from each other for His sake, then should we not expect to see about us the profit of such denial? And this I look vainly for. It comes to this: I am a single man for the kingdom's sake, its more rapid advance, its more potent realization in my own life. But where is that advance and that realization? I am willing that \"my house on earth be emptier,\" but not unless \"His house be fuller.\" And I think it right that we hold God to His own bargain. I err, of course, in making visible results of our separation the final test, and, I trust, rejoice in seeing beyond results which are obvious. But I reason thus that I should be more importunate in prayer, more dogged in devotion, and should not get, as you say, to a \"weary acceptance of things as they are.\"\n\nBesides this, there is the somewhat philosophical realization that actually I have lost nothing. We may imagine what it would be like to share a given event and feel loss at having to experience it alone. But let us not forget— that loss is imagined, not real. I imagine peaks of enjoyment when I think of doing things together, but let not the hoping for it dull the doing of it alone. What is, is actual—what might be simply is not, and I must not therefore query God as though He robbed me—of things that are not. Further, the things that are belong to us, and they are good, God given, and enriched. Let not our longing slay the appetite of our living. It is true that our youth is fast fleeting, and I know the rush of wants, the perfect fury of desire which such a thought summons. All that it involves—this getting on to thirty—brings a push of hurry and a surge of \"possible\" regrets over the soul. And, Betty, this is just exactly what we have bargained for. Obedience involves for us, not physical suffering, perhaps, nor social ostracism as it has for some, but this warring with worries and regrets, this bringing into captivity our thoughts. We have planted (in our integrity) the banner of our trust in God. The consequences are His responsibility.\n\nWe would see Jesus—other lights are paling, Which for long years we have rejoiced to see; The blessings of our pilgrimage are failing: We would not mourn them, for we go to Thee.\"\n\nGod Granted and God Denied\n\nJim arrived in Quito, Ecuador, at the end of February. Two months later I followed. We were four new missionaries, my colleague, Dorothy, and I living with a family named Arias, and Jim and his colleague, Pete Fleming, living just across the street with a Dr. Cevallos and his family. It was the first time since college days, four years ago, that we had been able to see each other daily over a period of time. We made the most of it. Pete and Jim ate the noon meal with us at the Ariases', and Don Raul, our host, put us through our paces on whatever Spanish we had learned. The competition got hot at times as we raced to master the language, all of us eager to get to the jungle, although Dorothy and I did not know to which part of it we might go. Jim and Pete had promised our senior missionary, Dr. Tidmarsh, that they would go to Shandia, a station in the eastern jungle, with Quichua Indians.\n\nIn Quito Jim and I did a great deal of walking. We explored every corner of the beautiful colonial city, visited outdoor markets, churches, parks, museums, indigenous craft shops. We hiked through lovely, lush meadows where sheep grazed, climbed down into deep ravines and up high mountains. We rode the buses nearly every afternoon to the post office to pick up the mail. Sometimes we would see how far we could ride on the one-cent fare.\n\nAt the end of our four months together (Jim had been in Quito six months) Spanish study was finished. He spoke it well, and it was time to go. In September he wrote from Shell Mera, the Missionary Aviation Fellowship base from which he would fly to the station nearest Shandia:\n\nSilhouettes of distant birds are sharp against the clouds, going east—and tomorrow, happily, and in the will of God, I will follow. Only too well I know again the inner weakness to return, to go back to you, but I feel that I have set my hand, and to look back now would be dishonor. He knows the inner part, and He knows how much of me I really leave with you. And He knows why I leave and for how long.\n\nConfused Rollings and Wheels\n\nWithin a few weeks of Jim's going east, I went west, down to work on the language of a small tribe called Colorado (named for the red dye with which they painted their hair and bodies). This meant that two ranges of the Andes separated us. Mail had to travel by mule from San Miguel, where Dorothy and I were, to Santo Domingo, thence by banana truck to Quito, where it often remained for days before being sent by air or road to Shell Mera and then to Pano. From Pano, the nearest station with an airstrip, it was carried by Indians to Shandia. Sometimes it was six weeks between my sending a letter and receiving a reply, and because we always wrote in longhand, we had no copies. At times I could not remember what Jim was replying to.\n\nRiding a bus one day in Quito, I was propositioned by a huge swarthy man who sat beside me. I wrote of it to Jim, and he wrote back:\n\nSept. 27, 1952—I found myself tearing into small stumps and cutting them out with one hack, thinking about it on the airstrip a few days ago. And reading it again today, I found the little ball muscles at the jaw bulge and my teeth clench hard as I pictured it. I am afraid there would have been a scene for sure if I had been on hand, Bett—so it was probably better that I wasn't along, although it probably wouldn't have happened had I been. But what devils me is that he evidently rides the bus line frequently, and it may happen any old day again. It would be maddening but for the trust that I have in God for you. Time and again I have committed the very matter to Him, knowing better and fearing more male passions than yourself. And I am thankful that you are all that you are for such cases, that I can trust you, even if the man isn't ugly next time, and that such things find you, though disgusted and a little afraid, firm and resolutely resistant. And I know that He who has so far preserved us for each other will yet do so, Bett, and for the endurance, make the realization so much the sweeter.\n\nOctober 8—Oh, I don't know how to tell you, Betty, or even if I should, but our months in Quito put me on an entirely different emotional level toward you than I was on before. Does it sound wrong to say that where you have been given rest since parting, I have had only uprisings of stronger want than ever? Where you have had peace, I find myself at perfect war. I mentioned last letter the strong urge to write, write, write, and the something that makes one restrain. I could add the crazy wish of wanting years to pass suddenly; the old rebellion of \"why should it have to be so with us?\"; the needing of a place to rest. Could it be that we are crossing the same river, but far enough apart to be at different depths, wisely kept so so that we would not sink together? I seem to feel it all much more keenly out here—there comes a sighing even as I write.\n\nOctober 27—I have been blessed these last two weeks with many dreams of you, which, now that I try to collect them, scatter into nothing more than an exhilarating impression. That first waking agony of rolling over on my cot and not finding you there is not to be borne many days in a row. Still and ever the Spirit gives the comfort of the knowledge of the Will as simply and often I speak with Him of all my desire for you, darling, and wonder before Him at the prolonged denial of a desire for so good a thing. And I pray that what He does for me He does for you, and as often.\n\nEarly in December Jim wrote:\n\nThis will arrive as near your birthday as anything I can get to you. I well know that you will be twenty-six, and that we have always regarded that age as sort of passing the youth mark. But it doesn't frighten me. You are as fresh and virgin in my thoughts now as you were five years ago, many times more so than much younger women I could name, and I love you with the same boyish vigor that has always held me to you. That last point I hope to demonstrate in perhaps six weeks' time.\n\nExciting news and disappointing news. He was going to \"demonstrate.\" What did that mean? But he was not going to make it to Quito for Christmas. I had been cherishing the hope that he would.\n\nIt looked to me as though it really didn't matter very much to him and he wasn't trying very hard. One thing after another seemed to come up to make it less and less likely. Where there's a will there's a way, I thought, and said so.\n\n\"I will come when I can with a clear conscience before God and will let you know of my plans if it is humanly possible,\" he answered. He asked me to give him the benefit of the doubt. He trusted my love, he said, to interpret things in his favor.\n\nLove interprets things in favor of the one loved. I had a long way to go to learn that, but the principle is clear enough in Paul's description: \"Love is patient . . . never selfish, not quick to take offence. Love keeps no score of wrongs. . . . There is nothing love cannot face; there is no limit to its faith, its hope, and its endurance.\"\n\nThe trouble, of course, is that we must learn to love people. People are sinners. Love must be patient when it is tempted (by the delays of other people) to be impatient. Love must not be selfish, even if other people are. Love does not take offence, though people are offensive sometimes. There are wrongs, but love won't keep score. There are things to be faced, but nothing love can't face, things to try love's faith, discourage its hope, and call for its endurance; but it keeps right on trusting, hoping, and enduring. Love never ends.\n\nThe memory of those painful weeks when it became clear that we were not going to make it to Quito for Christmas is still very vivid. I can see now that, humanly speaking, Jim might have changed some things to make it possible. He was not doing all that could have been done to bring us together. My doubts, humanly speaking, were well-founded. But from this distance, I can also see that I should have trusted God in him. Jim, though a human being with human limitations, was trying his hardest to walk in obedience to God. He was not pushing for his own way. I should have rested in that knowledge. Sometimes I did, but often I did not. Jim was concerned with Pete, with Dr. Tidmarsh, and with the Indians. His plans to see me were far down the list. That should have been evidence enough for me that his heart was where it belonged and that, even if I felt Jim didn't deserve my absolute trust when it came to our own cherished plans, God certainly did.\n\nLove Letters\n\nWhen I received the next letter, I wondered that I could have doubted whether it mattered to Jim that we be together. He was losing sleep over it.\n\nSome nights it is lying awake, wondering what it will be like to be alone with you again; others are turbid with wild dreams, everything from embraces to arguments; and still others, like yesterday, are fine until about 4:30 a.m. Then come wisps of hopes and plans that mold and shatter in the mind, little conversation frames, settings, and the mad wanting of the alarm to ring, the \"sickness of hope deferred,\" the cry inside of \"how long?\" I think sometimes that it will be impossible to meet and speak casually with you, saying, \"Hello, Bett,\" in the presence of other people, feeling sure that my voice will crack or I'll do something that will embarrass us both. But I suppose it will be like always, the greeting, the not-too-long glance into your eyes, the handshake, and the small talk about things that really don't matter. Well, if the Lord preserves me in my right mind until then, I shall be grateful, for, quite frankly, I have never been this way before.\n\nChristmas came and went. New Year's, 1953. The weeks of January dragged by until at last, late one night, I heard the galloping of a horse. There was a knock on the door, and a man handed me a telegram. Jim was in Quito, waiting for me to come. Dawn found me traveling as fast as the mud would allow the horse to go, out to Santo Domingo de los Colorados. Another night, and I caught a banana truck before dawn for the ten-hour grinding journey up to Quito. It was as Jim had predicted—the greeting in the presence of others, the not-too-long glance. But that evening we were alone by the fire.\n\nJim had waited nearly five years for this. He took it slowly that evening, biding his time. We looked at the fire, spoke briefly of our journeys from the jungle, sat in silence. In the fullness of time, he asked me to marry him. Then— the first kiss. A ring on my finger.\n\nHis next letter to me, weeks later, when again the Andes stood between us, said:\n\nWill I ever be able to tell you, Betts, what it does to me to have you call me \"darling\"? And to know that we are wholly and for always committed to one another, given over to one another's power and pleasure, sold out of ourselves, each for the other's good. The absolute goodness and rightness of it is unspeakable. How shall I say what I feel in gratitude to God for the rights and responsibilities of your love? And what shall I say to you? I don't know. Only this, my darling Betts, that I am drawn to you with a fondness I can never exhibit and held to you with a love that is at once all tenderness and all strength which my very body at either peak of gentleness or power does not suffice to declare. I love you. Once that meant \"I trust you\" and \"I appreciate and admire you.\" Now it means that I am somehow part of you, with you, in you.\n\nHeavy rains in the mountains caused an avalanche on the road from Quito to Santo Domingo, and we were without gasoline for our lamps, staple foods, and, most trying of all, mail. A letter came at last.\n\nIt was hot today and I could hardly force myself to pour concrete into two pillar forms. . . . Hard work, and now I'm ready for bed.\n\nBut not nearly so ready as I would be if you were here. Oh, to be able to take you there, darling, and do as I have dreamed of doing with those clothes of yours, and really feel the clean flesh of your beautiful long legs against the broadness of my own. Thunder of Deep Heaven! What gasping bliss that would be tonight. But it will wait for us, and be, as you've said, \"perfect\" when we arrive there. I long to\n\nfondle you tonight, Betts, and whisper that I love you, because I am now\n\nfanatically —your —Jim.\n\nMarch 22—How shall I tell you, darling, after all I've said carelessly about your features, that now I think them all wonderfully framed? I know when it comes time for me to see them all I will remark with Solomon, \"Behold, thou art fair, my love.\" To me it is satisfying already to know that they are promised me, and only wait God's time for unveiling. Do you know how anxious I am?\n\nJim went on to tell of a conversation with an Ecuadorian friend who had made a girl pregnant. The willingness of the girl fooled him into thinking all would be well. He had then been framed by her parents, arrested, and forced to marry her. \"Such are most of the marriages in my country,\" was the friend's comment.\n\n“What robbery they must feel, if not shame, at the first intercourse after the wedding under such circumstances.May God preserve us for His time. How Juan could esteem a woman like that I don't know. How grateful I am to God that I am not dealing with the type! Praise, praise for thee, lover. Thou art all God planned for me, and I exult in His design!\"\n\nJim planned to visit me in San Miguel in May. In late April he wrote:\n\nThese next two weeks will be long ones, I fear, as the rains have come and we must be inside most of the day. I cannot spend hour after hour studying phrases like Pete, and I get wild as a stalled stallion waiting in the radio room, studying the forest across the river and facing the gray, empty sky. I will come regardless of what Pete does or whether the teacher likes being left alone. I need you, darling, and need you soon.\n\nI love you strongly tonight, with a sense of power, a huge, surging hope inside me as to the fulfillment of our love. It is not the quiet longing that is usually on me, but the upflung fists and the shouting for possession, and both arms eager to crush you to me. It is the bursting heart and the wild eye of passion, the laugh that makes the stomach tighten. You cannot possibly understand this, and I really don't ask you to—it is just one of the ways I love you and it happens to seize me as I write. Love is not all a resting in me. It is a tenseness and a daring, a call to crush and conquer. . . . Good-night, my brave lover, and may the God who loves you stronger than I stand guard over you through the night.\n\nThis Is Our God—We Have Waited for Him\n\nJim came to San Miguel as planned, slept in the schoolroom, visited the Indians with me, preached in a little Sunday service held for Spanish-speaking white people who lived in our clearing.\n\nOn the last evening we stood on the balcony of the creaking old thatched-roof house where I lived with Dorothy. We watched the mist rise in the pasture, veiling the shapes of the few cows, the horse, and the dirty white ox that grazed there. Tree frogs quacked and peeped, an occasional hoot or woodwindlike note came from a night bird. Pinpoints of light from tiny oil lamps in the houses nearby winked out one by one. The moon rose behind tier on tier of jungle trees, its light diffused by the mist.\n\nWe talked of plans for a house someday in the eastern jungle. When would it be? Jim could not tell me. We had no wedding date set. He was committed to building houses for two other missionary families. This made me feel resentful. Did it always have to be others first? I could not say this aloud—for disciples the answer was obvious.\n\nA few weeks later he wrote, \"Evenings, when we go down to the Talac River to bathe, I spend the whole time looking at the hill I want to build on for us, in reverie and wonder. And my prayers are full of you. Marriage is an hourly committal now, and I feel the want of it so strongly that I actually expect something 'catastrophic' every time I am separated from Pete for a while, or when Ed comes to the radio.\"\n\nThe next letter said, \"I am fervently praying these days that God will make the day soon when we can live out our love in everyday doings. It may not take anything catastrophic after all to bring us together—just a hurdling, one after another, of the things that block me from marriage now. I may tell you quite freely now, that one of those hurdles, namely, housing, is passed. I feel we could get on in anything to start with, and likely will.\"\n\nIn late June I left my Colorado language work in the hands of two English women in San Miguel and moved to Dos Rios, a station about six hours' walk from Shandia, to fulfill the condition of Jim's proposal—that I should learn Quichua before he would marry me. The pilot had planned to land in Shandia on our way to Dos Rios so that I could see Jim and the station, but weather began to close in, and he would not take the risk. \"To see you pass over my head was almost too much,\" Jim wrote. \"I'm not bitter, but I am disappointed, and had to look up to God, going down the trail to visit a sick believer after you had gone, and tell Him that I knew He had something better in mind ... I had banana and pineapple sherbet made for your arrival, and we soon finished it off after you flew over.\" (Jim and Pete had a small kerosene refrigerator.)\n\nLetters went back and forth between Shandia and Dos Rios by Indian carriers, and in July Jim came by trail to Dos Rios. I looked out of my window when I heard the shout, \"Chirnba-chiwapai!\" (\"Please take me across the river\") and saw him standing on the top of the cliff of the Mishahualli. By the time I reached the bank, the man with the canoe was bringing him across.\n\nIt took some fancy footwork to meet alone during that weekend without scandalizing the Quichua Indians. They knew no such thing as courtship, all marriages being arranged by middlemen and the bride and groom not speaking until after the wedding. It would have been quite impossible for them to believe that we could meet and talk alone without sexual shenanigans. One afternoon I took the trail to a sandy beach of the Mishahualli while Jim took a trail upriver and swam half a mile or so with the current to meet me. At night, long after the Indians were asleep (they went to bed with the chickens, figuratively and literally), we went out into the moonlit meadows, screened from the house by tall pasture grass and orange trees, where we could stand, locked in an embrace, and talk. The matter of a wedding date came up at last. Jim asked how I would feel about November, perhaps January, depending on Pete's reaction, my learning Quichua, Jim's having opportunity to make at least one trek to other areas of the Quichua population.\n\nA few weeks later the \"catastrophe\" Jim had half wished for, an unimagined one, happened. The Atun Yacu, the \"Big River\" on whose high cliffs the Shandia station stood, flooded in August and carried off, in a single night, all of the mission buildings and several hundred meters of the airstrip. This convinced Jim and Pete and Ed McCully (the new co-worker recently arrived from Wisconsin) that God had something else in mind. They made a three-week trek to the southern part of Quichua territory, found a place in need of a school and a missionary, and agreed that Jim and I were the ones to go there.\n\nWe were married in Quito on October 8, 1953. The McCullys and Tidmarshes were our witnesses. Others came to see us off at the airport and to throw rice at us.”\n\nAt the El Panama hotel, overlooking the Pacific coast of Panama, I picked up the phone shortly after we arrived. \"Mrs. Elliot?\" said a polite voice. I was stunned. Mrs. Elliot! It was only the front desk, inquiring if all was satisfactory in our room. We went down to dinner and as we dawdled over coffee and dessert, savoring the luxurious atmosphere and enjoying the music of a dance band, Jim looked across the candles at me. \"I can hardly believe we've got a bed waiting for us!\" he said.\n\nThe verse given to us for that day was Isaiah 25:9, \"Lo, this is our God; we have waited for him.\"\n\nIt was unspeakably worth the wait.\n\nResources: https://bethanygu.edu/blog/stories/jim-and-elisabeth-elliot/\n\n\"Passion and Purity\""
