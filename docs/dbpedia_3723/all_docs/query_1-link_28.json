The Bible tell us to be models of Jesus and reflect Him to the world. Olivet offers a caring environment away from home. The students will reflect what they have learned here into the world. Reflections can be either good or bad. A reflection of this school is you. College is a time that you will grow both spiritually and intellectually. Olivet gave you the keys to success through many means. One was the updating of ONU facilities and new building construction through the Capitol Campaign of 1998-99. The first change the campus saw in the fall was the construction of the new entrance. What was once a stone sign became a pair of symmetrical, curved brick walls bearing the name Olivet Nazarene University. The old stone sign was moved to a new position at the east end of University Avenue, near Ward Field. Next, the foundation for the Admissions Welcome Center was put into place just east of the new entrance. Another major project was the renovation of the student dining room in Ludwig. The transformation from \"cafeteria\" to the \"scatter system\" all but erased the long lines of students wrapped around the edges of the room. Phase one of dormitory renovation in Williams and Nesbitt was completed with further ( Cont. p. 4) The foundation was layedj new Admissions building J} year. 1 Refl continued from p. S residence hall work continuing for the next three summers. An outdoor patio was added just outside Common Grounds - the ONU coffee shop. Additionally, two biology labs in Reed Hall of Science were combined to form a \"SMART lab.\" All of these improvements will enhance student life and help prepare students for the next millennium. Justin Long Just can't remember where he sits for chapel. Students looking for their chapel seats on the posted lists is an annual sight.

Olivet's new entrance sign awaits the landscapers' finishing touches. Hopefully you will remember the values taught here. A time of reflection is the time to look inside of yourself and see who you are. College is the time that individuals question their being and gain their own sense of spirituality with God. Do you ever reflect in your quiet times and evaluate your day? Was it good? Did you use your time wisely? Did you do poorly on a test? These and many other questions may flood your mind. Olivet gives you the Christian support to help you grow and make the I most of your time while at (Cont. page 6).

Bac K 2 sen W61 An air of excitement marked the start of the 1998-99 school year. While students spent the summer working, ministering, relaxing and taking summer courses, the Olivet community was busy preparing for the start of a new year. Eight days following graduation ceremonies, renovations began on the dining room. The transformation was dramatic. Student input helped make the project a success. With only hours left before the beginning of classes, the final touches were completed. The opening of Common Grounds last spring with the addition of the outdoor patio in August increased the options available to students on campus. These renovations serve as examples of several significant projects undertaken, including: a new campus cable TV system, new windows and air conditioners in Nesbitt Hall, and a new fire detection and alarm system in each residence hall. The month of June was highlighted by two new student orientations. Altogether, four hundred students attended the two June orientations, while 105 students attended the August orientation prior to the start of classes. A record enrollment of 2,403 consisted of 561 freshman, 981 upperclassmen, and 861 graduate and adult students. The year's opening chapel service was marked by the work of the Holy Spirit in ways not often seen during the beginning of a school year. Following a relevant and inspiring message from Dr. John Bowling, students from across the auditorium stood and made their way to the altar. With the spiritual tone in place, our hearts were prepared for a time of fall revival on our campus. The ministry of Promise and Dr. Jim Diehl brought special and meaningful days of spiritual renewal to the Olivet community. It is times such as these that bring me the greatest satisfaction. The success of Student Development is not measured in buildings or programs. Success depends upon the number of lives encouraged toward Christian development. by Dean Walter \"Woody\" Webb 10 University Life (Facing page) Students face long lines, as back to school means back to paying school bills in Miller Business Center. Back to School 11 Chapel Begins witti SpirituaTlEmphasis Chapel was probably (he thing I was most fearful of when I deeided to come to Olivet. The whole concept of required church in the middle of a class day just threatened something inside me. But after my first few chapels, I felt better. I was encouraged to see Chaplain Bill Bray's attempt to make chapel a unique and diverse mix of school and church, while incorporating and focusing on the student. Dr. Bray expressed that his philosophy is that chapels should be more about identification for students, rather than inspiration. His love for good rock & roll helps him relate God's message in a way students both understand and remember. He wants to address issues, and not out of shock value, but with a sincere burden for students that are uncomfortable with the evangelical subculture. Bray said, \"The bottom line is for the student in the chair, unsure of where they are I spiritually 1.\" When Chaplain Bray starts searching for a new feature to include in chapels, he looks for relational aspects; easily identifiable points; varieties; and multi-ethnic, cultural, and gender selections. He describes it as more of a shooting the arrows and then drawing a bull's-eye around it. In the last five years Olivet has moved to a more national level in reference to the quality of the speaker /guests. Bray's attendance at an annual chaplains' retreat has allowed him to obtain a more complex network of resources. A year with special artists like Bebo Norman, Andrew Petterson, and speakers like Jennifer Knapp and Brennan Manning added and sustained the exciting power of God's spirit which began in the first few weeks of school. It was an attitude and power that had not been felt at Olivet for a few years, but WILL leave a mark, by Natalie Chovancek (above) Chaplain Dr. Bill Bray accepts the Academy Award for best facial expressions.

Partly school, chapel has teaching objectives within an acknowledged academic community - yet chapel is not a classroom singularly devoted to instruction. Partly church, chapel includes singing, praying, preaching - yet chapel is not a church which provides the enduring spiritual nurture and fellowship offered by local pastors and congregations. Rather, college chapels provide a unique kind of young adult ministry, with limited ends and restricted means. College chapels, like all other college programs, focus on the needs and aptitudes of the young adults who attend.\" from \"Chapel on Purpose\" K • Randy Kinder and Bill DeWees help lead the students in choruses.

Social Committee's efforts helped this year's competitions surpass all expectations. The weekend was themed \"Wendy's Wacky Weekend,\" in honor of Wendy Parsons. The turn out of students was phenomenal and finding eager participants was not a problem. When the points from the athletic and goofy games were tallied, the juniors and seniors were neck- and- neck for first. After the skit and talent competition, the seniors won it all and became two-year champs of Ollies Follies.

Ollies Follies 15 Nothing says Oyafl^PartY like.^^^ Affy TappTes Every year there are a number of Quad parties. The themes of the parties are always fun and exciting. However, this year for the first time in Olivet history, there was a Quad party without a theme. The Decker Quadrangle was filled with people and music filled the campus of Olivet Nazarene University. The good Nazarenes stood with both of their feet firmly planted. Even so, the majority of students had tons of fun just standing around chatting with friends. The most popular Quad party in recent years was the Fall Feast. This year's Fall Feast was moved inside to Birchard Gym. The location of the party didn't stop the good times. One of the highlights of every Fall Feast is eating an Affy Tapple. When Kathy Wyse was asked) why she attended the Fall Feast, she replied, \"It's all about the Affy Tapples.\" So, if for no other reason, we will see you at next year's Fall Feast for the caramel apples. by Amy Frunz Ben Moreland has a great time checking out chicks.

Open dorms, community bathrooms, fire alarms, annoying neighbors or roommates, late night pizza /study parties, and prank phone calls. What do all these things have in common? They are all part of the wonderful world of dorm life. For those of us who have moved away from a home in which the bedroom, bathroom, and kitchen were for the most part ours, we have had to make quite a few adjustments. However, I think we can all agree, it's one adventure we will never forget. So what is a typical day like living in the dorms? Well for the most part, you wake up to the sound of your alarm clock, force yourself out of bed and hopefully make your way to the shower. At this point some will choose sleep as the best option, while the rest of us will make our way to class. As the day flies by, some will not enter their room until it's time to retire for the night. Others spend their time going in and out doing various activities such as taking naps, or studying. The day ends when you decide to return to your room, jump into bed, and get a couple of hours of sleep before the journey starts again. J.R.

University Life 19 Oktoberfest Fall Fest'9 8 This year Ihe 17(h annual Fall Fest was held at Rosenboom Farm. AUhough Fall Fest has been a tradition here at Olivet for many years now, this year's had a slightly different twist compared to those held in the past. The junior class, which sponsored the event, had an Oktoberfest theme based on the German festival. It was a night of fun carnival games, pumpkin carving, food, and prizes. There were contests that enabled many of the students to get involved including pumpkin carving contests, root beer chugging races, bobbing for apples, and a wood cutting contest with a two-man saw. When the night was over and all the prizes were passed out, the junior class stood around the smoking remains of the bonfire, pleased with how well the event had gone. Looking back on that night, I would have to admit that my favorite part of the evening was fighting in the hay with my friends. by Bethany Heidel Even if it means getting wet.

It was a night when costumes were pulled out of the closet and makeup was applied to make you look more like that scary, funny, or cute image. When the clock tower struck 7:00 p.m., the fun of the Candy and Costume Fest had begun. Costumes of all kinds filled the halls of every dorm and apartment on campus. Candy was distributed, laughter filled the halls and Matt Crowder sports his Chuck Norris look for Candy and Costume Fest. that ever-so-freaky guy scared you to death.

Dr. Hanson graduated from ONU in the spring of 1 957. He then went on to complete his graduate work at Purdue University. In the fall of 1 960, he was invited to Olivet's campus to interview for a position. Following the will of God in 1 961 , Dr. Hanson took a leap of faith and joined Olivet's faculty, moving his wife and oldest daughter, Heidi, from Lafayette, Indiana to Kankakee. After only a couple of years here, he traveled to Chicago in 1 963 to study the reaction of cobalt compounds at the Institute of Technology. His first sabbatical was spent at the University of Chicago where he worked dilligently from 1 974 to 1 975 on vitamin Bl 2 model compounds. Most recently, on sabbatical in 1 984, he went north to the University of Madison in Wisconsin. In Wisconsin he taught for a semester, and also was able to study silicon chemistry. What has kept him here for close to four decades? Dr. Hanson says he has stayed because of the sense of God's calling and the need to fulfill it. He says it has been wonderful for him to work with students, see them progress, graduate, and then take their place in the world as Christians. His wife, Esther, said, \"He has given his teaching his best and the best has come back to him and his family.\" Although his two daughters, Heidi Goerlitz and Heather Brayan, no longer live at home, Dr. Hanson and his wife still reside in Bourbonnais. In the local community. Dr. Hanson has served on the Bourbonnais township as an auditor. He is also active at College Church of the Nazarene where he is a regular member and a past board member. Dr. Hanson now enjoys leading a Wednesday night Bible study group with about six other men from the church. \"Olivet is a great school, and it's been my life's work. What I have put into the University, I have been grateful to contribute. God isn't finished with me yet. I recall the verse, 'He who began a good work in you, will be faithful to complete it'.\" It is with great pleasure that the Aurora staff dedicates the 1 999 Aurora to Dr. John Hanson for countless contributions to the local community of Bourbonnais and the campus community of Olivet Nazarene University. \"What I have put into the University, I have been grateful to contribute.\" Dr. John Hanson Dedication Page 23 university Life President's Page . Dr. John Bowling Reflections— what a great theme for the 1998-99 Aurora. A yearbook provides the perfect vehicle to preserve the historical record of the University. This record becomes a \"reflection\" of the people and events which shaped our time together on this campus. And, in addition, the yearbook enables us to reflect back on this year anytime--simply by opening these pages. So this year's theme encompasses both the noun (reflections) and the verb (to reflect). When I think of Olivet, about the values and in our lives. There is an Olivet experienced.

This is more than a set of buildings or a place where futures are fashioned Olivet reflects a strong commitment to academic excellence. The members of the faculty have outstanding credentials as well as a genuine concern for students. Also ONU has strong support for technology, international travel, and learning environment. Another attribute reflected in the character of Olivet is the University's vibrant and positive commitment to campus life. The Aurora reflects the work of scores of clubs and organizations which have contributed in positive ways to the accomplishments of the University. The mission of the ONU extends from the classroom, to the residence halls and student center. The character of Olivet is reflected academically and socially, but the most significant expression of our mission is spiritually. The presence of God is to be reflected throughout all that happens on this campus. The very life of Christ ought to be seen in each of us. The scripture says: \"And we, who with unveiled faces all reflect the Lord's glory, are being transformed into his likeness with ever-increasing glory, which conies from the Lord, who is the Spirit\" (2 Corinthians 3:18). \"Olivet reflects a strong commitment to academic excellence.\" Dr. John Bowling President's Page 25 Homecoming in Style Talk about the busiest weekend of my life. As the photographer I took only 6 rolls of film by myself, and with my cronies I believe we went through 12 rolls in total. The week before homecoming I almost threw my phone out the window because of the calls \"Natalie can you run here?\" Natalie can you take some pictures of this? But it all enabled me to see the alumni more, and a more diverse selection of the acativites. There was literally something for everyone. For those who like sports, there were basketball, fottball, soccer, and track. For those musically inclined, or those who wish they were, there was a conert with the \"Other 3 Tenors.\" For the more relaxed sort, you could hang out with your old friends in Common Grounds. Whatever your niche, you were all pulled here before and pulled back once again to remember those \"good 'ole days.\" This campus is a place of memories and reflections, everywhere you look there is a story, and I am happy I can be a part of it. by Natalie Chovancek (above) The ONU Tigers took on Taylor University. \"This Is a place of memories and reflections.\" Our men's basketball team defeated Point Lx>ma Nazarene University in a close game. 26 University Life It's about the Jans.

The senior class council sponsored the Late Skate for the entire student body. This year's first Late Skate was at Hidden Cove where students could skate, eat, and play video games. The Grail concert and impromptu performance started the night off with laughter. Many students attended and had a great time whether they were dressed for the occasion in 1920's clothing or just skated to the miusic. by Camie Martin This year's 80's Late Skate was \"totally rad.\" Seeing so many students dressed in 80's trends reminded me of the good old years. The years when bangs had to be two inches high and guys had to wear tight rolled, dark blue jeans, in order to be cool. It's funny to think that in ten years from now there will be another generation of college kids hosting Late Skates. The only difference is they will be dressing up like you and me.

The Christian Music Society, or CMS, really took off this year. Having very little to work with from previous years, the CMS council members had it tough. However, this didn't stop them from trying. CMS worked on a couple different coffee houses and concerts to keep those here at Olivet a bit more entertained. Something new this year was a newsletter containing such things as updates on concerts, information on \"music stuff,\" and creative contributions such as poems. The goal this year was to give an extra effort to make CMS what it should be... a way for students to come together and listen to good Christian music. The music band. Plaid, performs for the CMS crowd. 32 Tiger Madness students take on the ONU basketball teams in a little shoot Let's get ready to rumble! Jason McHenry uses his public out. speaking skills to announce for Tiger Madness. What do you get with 300 screaming fans, ONU's women's and men's basketball teams and 100 free t-shirts? The answer is TIGER MADNESS. Tiger Madness was a pep rally for Olivet's basketball teams. It was held to energize the student body's excitement for the upcoming basketball season. The pep rally was co- sponsored by SIFE and ASC. The night featured introductions of players, participation from the crowd, crazy games, and a slam dunk contest. There was even sibling rivalry when Tyler and Tiffany Field went head-to- head in the 3 point shoot out. Senior Lady Tiger Holly Disch commented on the event by saying, \"It was great to see all of the students come out and support us.

The audience was dazzled by a well-choreographed light show that accompanied the different musical artists. Silage opened and energized the audience with their fun, punk- style music that was contained in a \"pop\" package. Jars of Clay's Steve Mason and Charlie Lowell helped them out in a little jazz ditty. Burlap to Cashmere was next to take the stage. Their enthusiastic Spanish guitar and obvious musical abilities entertained the crowd with Christian lyrics. Fans were then excited and Jars of Clay didn't let them down. The band's energy was catching. Lead singer Dan Haseltine improved a country style song and involved the audience a bit more. The band even surprised fans with a new song that they wrote from the \"Prince of Egypt\" inspirational soundtrack. Jars of Clay really got into their music, and the audience appreciated the concert.

The team finished the regular season 8-2, which also happened to be a school record. This solid regular season led the Tigers to the NAIA playoffs. The team was first paired with Hastings College in Hastings, Nebraska. Hastings ranked number one at the time and was surprised when the Tigers won the game 32 - 26. That evening on the ride home, the Tigers received word that they would next face the University of Sioux Falls. This team also underestimated the power of the Tigers.

The weather definitely added to the theme for this year's banquet, but that didn't stop anyone from dressing up and coming out. Christmas banquet has traditionally been a time in which students could take a break from all that studying and have some fun. The students generally have high expectations for the Christmas banquet. This year was no different and Social Committee did a wonderful job of living up to the high standards of the students. The smell of the evergreens filled the air and other great decorations added to the wonderful mood. The mountain scenes and the lodge area were quite the popular places for picture taking.

There are five areas in which a student can specialize. They are: drawing, painting, art history, commercial graphics, and art education. The three professors in the Art Department include Professor William Greiner (Art Department chair). Professor Chelise Kinzinger, and Professor William Petit. There have been several changes in the department this year. Two adjuct professors, each teaching a class a piece, were added. Professor Mike Perrot is teaching a sculpture class and Professor Jerry Solthis is teaching a graphics course. The sculpture class is a stepping stone class that will give new insight as to whether to begin a specialized field for sculpture. The Art Department is growing a great deal. It is said to be the fastest growing department on this campus. Professor Kinzinger explains, \"there is a great deal of bonding that takes place between the students and the professors.\" The professors try to spend as much time as possible on campus working with the students.

The work load may be difficult, but the rewards of a solid education in biology are many. After receiving a degree in Biological Sciences, students have varied career paths from which they may choose, in addition to an excellent groundwork that will allow them to further pursue an advanced degree in Biology. Many biology majors feel that the greatest part of the department is the faculty itself. Comprised of five professors, the Biology Department staff takes those extra steps to create a personal one-on-one relationship with the students. The fact that many extra hours of studying and lab work are put forth, along with the reality that the Biology Department is comprised of a wonderful faculty, gives proof enough why the Biological Sciences have, are, and will continue to thrive as a major part of Olivet's curriculum, by Leanne Loica lorogy Julie Brookman peers through a microscope during one oj many lab sessions.

Leading the Way _ Business The business department of Olivet was located on (he (hird floor of Burke Administration building. The business department advanced in the areas of education, computer integration, and campus and community involvement. In the area of education, the classes challenged the students with serious discussion in class and group meetings outside of class. The computer integration advancement involved lab sessions which helped the students learn and understand the rapid changes of technology and technological skills. Olivet's business department knew that computer skills would be imperative in the business world and having knowledge in this field will give the students the skills they need to be successful. Community and campus involvment were enhanced through clubs. These allowed the students to experience hands-on learning. Students in Free Enterprise (S.I.F.E.) helped connect students with the people of the community, while the Business Club was active in student life. The most important part of the business department was taking faith and integrating it with situations that may be faced in the real world.

Olivet offers a major and a minor in chemistry that will give students a basic understanding of chemistry and prepare them for specific careers or further studies. A degree in chemistry has its rewards, but definitely takes a great amount of dedication and devotion to a cause. Countless hours are spent working in labs and listening to lectures in Reed Hall of Science. In addition, many hours of study must be put forth outside of the classroom. After receiving a degree, a door is opened to graduate studies for careers in chemistry, biochemistry, chemical engineering, and medicine. The faculty of the Chemistry Department is made up of Dr. Douglas Armstrong, Dr. Larry Ferren, Dr. John Hanson, and Dr. Xinyu Li, who all work together to make the learning process appropriate and useful to each individual student. Education is placed on a more personal level. Here at Olivet, although the main focus of the Chemistry Department may be the study of matter, its composition, properties, and reactions, a greater emphasis is placed upon developing self-discipline and learning how to cooperate and work with others. by Leanne Loica \"Education is placed on a more personal level.\" 56 Academics J.

Students in the education field are trained for teaching in pre-school, elementary, and secondary schools. The Division of Education has three departments: education, physical education, and library science. The Education Division is responsible for all teacher programs at Olivet. The division head of education is Dr. Thomas Knowles. Other professors of education are Professor Dale Oswalt, Dr. Francis Reed, Dr. Sara Spruce, Professor Maria Streit, and Dr. H. Stanton Tuttle. The education office is located at the north side of Benner Library. Being prepared and becoming involved are two fundamentals of student teaching, according to Senior Sara Fleeman. \"Get involved as much as you can with anything having to do with children.

The department added three adjunct professors to their staff. Professor Mikel Ferri, Professor Kevin Brown, and Professor Michael Gingerich joined the engineering team to allow full-time professors additional time to prepare a document that will enable the department to become accredited. Dr. Newsham and the rest of the faculty hope to attend a self-study course this summer, with a visit from the accreditaton board in the fall of 1999. New computers, carrying Windows NT work stations, were installed which will allow new software to be used. The Engineering Department is being tested with these computers in its area, with hopes to install them all across campus in the years to come. \"It's really a great opportunity to be allowed to have these new computers and it works out well with the growing number of students we are acquiring,\" Dr. Newsham said. Forty new students entered the program this fall, compared to thirty last year. Dr. Newsham explains, \"It is so important that we get an accreditation so our students can leave with a recognized professional title.\" The department is involved with three national organizations that keep them up-to-date with the changing world of engineering. Through these organizations students are able to become involved in clubs, such as Olivet's own Engineering Club, and are encouraged to seek work off campus. by Christine Casteel \"It's really a great opportunity to be allowed to have these new computers and it works out well with the growing number of students we are acquiring.\" (Dr. Newsham) 62 Academics J. students spend a great deal of time in the labs, working and solving problems in engineering. 2.

The Geology Department is located in the Reed Hall of Science and is experimenting with Windows NT operating systems. Several new pieces of software are now being used that enable students to launch into serious geological computer applications. Technology is not all that was added to the department, though. Professor Brock Schroeder in now a full-time faculty member in geology and director of the planetarium. It is estimated that 60% of the students that graduate from this major go on to graduate schools. Those that don't pursue a higher level of education have been very successful in finding work in environmental and petroleum fields. Professor Reams says, \"several elementary and secondary teachers have emphasized in geology in order to find a teaching position in an otherwise tight market.\" Students are able to travel and experience more if they take advantage of the Olivet Geology Society (OGS). They advance with the major and take several field trips to practice what is learned in the class room.

The biggest element that sets nursing apart from other majors is the clinicals that start sophomore year at Americana Nursing Home. Junior and senior year clinicals are split between Provena St. Mary's Hospital and Riverside Hospital. These clinicals are \"practices\" for the theory being taught that semester. Subjects covered range from pediatric to psychiatric nursing, to prepare students to take the N-CLEX test upon graduation. Nursing Students in Action (NSA) is becoming involved in campus and community activities such as running the blood drive, and parish nursing. Contrary to popular belief, nursing students do more than study and they hope to show this during the 1998-1999 school year.

(Dr. Bell) The Psychology Department is the second largest academic department on the campus of Olivet. The professors of the Psychology Department are excited about the continued growth of the department and the almost overwhelming number of students interested in this field. The Department is led by its chair Dr. William Bell, and five other dedicated professors. \"Forty-one psychology majors were listed in the graduation program in May of 1998, which was the second highest number for traditional undergraduate majors,\" explained Dr. Bell. Of those 41 graduates, many went on to graduate school to specialize in one of approximately 30 fields available in Psychology. Many schools sought out Olivet students interested in Doctoral Programs. This past year a Master of Arts in Professional Counseling was added to the program and the first class of sixteen graduated in May of 1998. Also, the Department recently made a revision in the course requirements in order to offer a Counseling Psychology class. This class meets the Illinois state requirements for licensed psychologists.

Most students who major in this field leave Olivet knowing their education will take them where they want to go. \"Our students are working in a variety of social service agencies, both public and private. Those who are not working are in graduate schools of social work, law, or psychology,\" explained Professor Micheal LaReau. Professor LaReau, along with Professors Janice Hackinsmith and Kent Olney, teach the classes in this feild. The program has been accredited now for about two years. Since that time there has been a great increase in the number of students interested in Social Services. This department generates the fifth largest number of student credit hours on Olivet's campus. This year the department changed their course requirements and added three new classes. In addition \"Professor Olney is finishing his doctoral dissertation dealing with the sociology of the deaf church and the work of Rev. Phillip Hasenstab,\" LaReau said.

Speech Communication 83 The \"A trained and ready Army has at its foundation competent and confident leaders.\" (Senior Paul Cote) LeadecsjtfJJie i=uture A trained and ready Army has as its ibundation competent and eoniident leaders. Reserve Ollicers Training Corps (R.O.T.C.) develops such leaders through a dynamic process consisting of three equally important pillars: Institutional Training, Operational Assignments, and Self- Development. With Institutional Triaining, the Army understands the importance of a good education and is willing to make that investment in those individuals displaying the qualities and values of a leader. In Operational Assignments, R.O.T.C. is no different from the active Army. Students participate in activities such as rappelling, land navigation, handgrenades, and air mobile exercises. With Self Development, the Army holds to this- principle: Know Yourself and Seek Self Improvment. Leaders in our Army have many challenges. They must take care of soliders' needs, develop them into cohesive teams, train them under tough and realistic conditions to demanding standards, assess their performance, assist them with their personal and professional growth, and reward them for their successes. To meet that challenge, our leaders must be competent and confident in their ability to lead. R.O.T.C. was developed to meet that challenge. by Paul Cote, Army, R.O.T.C, Training Officer Jamilee Cook is greeted by one of her superiors. c.

You have paid a price in both discipline and dollars for your education and I congratulate each of you on your accomplishments. As you leave Olivet, you set sail to distant destinations. Most of your life will be spent in the new millennium, a world in which life may be quite different than it is today. But you need not go alone on this journey, for the One who is forever true and faithful will go before you and will go with you. I challenge you to live a life worthy of your calling in Christ Jesus. Don't be a clone of culture, but set your sights on things above. You are called to make a life, not just a living— to fulfill a destiny, not just to make a dollar. I encourage you to not only pursue happiness, but also usefulness— to seek the good, the true, the beautiful, the eternal. You are the dawn of tomorrow, the heart and soul of a new generation. This world needs you. You leave us, the faculty and staff of Olivet behind— we cannnot go with you, nor should we try. But we shall continue to watch you, pray for you, support you, and love you as you go. Live nobly. Think great thoughts. Dream great dreams. Do great deeds. Never give up, knowing that with God nothing shall be impossible. Above all, hold fast to the knowledge of Jesus Christ and God will hold fast to you. John Bowling, President Friends, Dawn Henderson, Gabrielle Garrett Sara Ucherek, and Cindy Jones celebrate the New Year together. \"I'm not wearing that thing!\" Matt Mund tells Matt Kreitzer.

David Knudson Wisconsin David spent his summer in Green Bay, WI, working with the youth at the Church of the Nazarene, under the direction of Pastor Ron Thick. For David, the process was just as faith- building and rewarding as his ministry. He trusted God in providing a job in which he would be able to earn enough money to be a youth pastor as well. Romans chapters 7 & 8 are verses that demonstrate the transformation that took place in David's life. David was able to show the youth group in Green Bay how to live through Christ and was blessed in the process. He also learned the importance of relationships. Scott Armstrong Australia Every Sunday, Scott and three other students led the worship services of a lot of different churches with different cultural backgrounds. During the week, he and the other students did a Bible study. They also worked at a kids' camp. Scott quotes \"1 prayed more than ever and I stepped out of my comfort zone. Each time the Lord was faithful to give me more strength than 1 ever wanted.\" Scott realized that it was a tough summer, but he learned a lot and it confirmed his call to missions. Emily Kortaneck India Traveling with Youth In Mission, Emily went to Washim, a city in the center of India. For seven weeks the nine-person crew painted, held youth services, Bible studies, and cared for the health needs. At Reynolds Memorial Hospital, Emily assisted in a tubal ligation surgery. This trip confirmed her call to be in full time international mission work. The best part Emily said was learning \"about the servant nature of Christ and getting past the language barrier.\" Seniors 125 Seniors Sara Ucherek Tracy Vanderwiel Tina Vanhoose Amber Vaudt Aimee Vlckers Eric Vickers 1^ H w i Adam Wade Kara Wade Jeremy Wadsworth Jaime Waldron Sally Walter Kara Warren jILJ Tessa Waterbury Timothy Welch Chad Wiersema Bryan Wilhelm Brandon Williams Carrie Williams JeffLafave Michigan-Arkansas-Louisiana-Georgia- Michigan-Missouri This summer Jeff worked with Evangelist Stephen Manley, by helping him with youth and children. One thing that impacted Jeff was observing the diversity of the churches. He feels like he has a higher standard for Biblical teaching as a result and appreciates the example Stephen Manley lives. Manley practices what he preaches. The hardest part for Jeff was building relationships with the kids and saying goodbye. 126 People r .(^ V_- iiiiliii Jeffrey Williams Jenniffer Wilson Lisa Wilson Rayna Wissbroecker Susan Woodward Brandon Wyatt Theresa Wyman Kathleen Wyse Lisa Yeackley Cara Yergler Joy Yoon Sang Yoon Seniors 127 Seniors class of ninety-nine Leadership senior class council I Our class is one who has school spirit and stands out above others. We have strong student leaders who initiate and organize events to create enthusiasm and participation among the class as well as the student body. One of my favorite events was the Jr./Sr Banquet which we hosted for the class of 1998 at the Drake Hotel in Chicago. A lot of time and preparation went into this evening. Other events included: the Fall Fest, a late bowl, Mancino's Night, and dinner with a professor. It was fun to see the final results as everything came together. The senior class seemed to enjoy their evening, which made it worth all of the hard work. This year 1 am excited to see our class come together a final time,! through activities such as a lock-in and a winter retreat, to promote unity. I've enjoyed the leadership position and being involved on campus. Through these experiences, I feel I have made life-long friends. Not only do we have fun with each other, we take accountability seriously and have helped each other to grow in Christ. — Camie Martin President of the Class of 1999 "
