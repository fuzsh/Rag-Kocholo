As she approaches, the atmosphere is cool and refreshing; the song birds are singing their sweetest selections; the whispering breeze bathes the verdant foliage; and the flowers send forth their sweet aroma. She heralds life and joy; and inspires a sleeping world to renew its task with gladness.

BOX 592 Kankakee, IL 60901 (815) 939-5337 Volume 87 Dr. John Bowling, COPYRIGH\" 2000 Olivet's story begins in a small town called Georgetown located in Illinois. In 1907 this small elementary school opened up with a mere 36 students in attendance. Olivet was given full life on June 8, 1908, during a meeting at Orla Nesbitt's farm at Olivet. A group calling themselves a Board oTTrustees proposed that the school, which was no located in Olivet, Illinois, be called the Illinois Holiness University. This school had been started by the gracious donation of farmland owned by Orla Nesbitt. Nesbitt's sister, Mary was the first teacher at The Real Story Olivet's Story the private Christian grade school. When the school moved to Olivet, Illinois it was during a prayer meeting that it got its name. The school was to be called Olivet for the mount where Christ had ascended back to heaven. Then in June of 1915, the trustees decided to change the name with the hopes of getting a fresh start. The school's name changed from Illinois Holiness University to Olivet University. Representatives from Olivet met on December 6-9, 1917, with the Chicago Central District to try and save Olivet. General Superintendent R.T. Williams made the plans to raise the entire $100,000 debt. It was because of this meeting that Olivet was saved. The school then increased its grades by adding a high school. At this time the emphasis was on high school education because people usually only advanced to thei eight grade. In a sense, high school education was like what a college education is in today's world. The school's first president was Dr. A.M. Hills, who had academict! credibility, as well as ministerial standing. During the years of 1910-1919, the board and the president went round and round about what a president's duties were. In the 1920s the school began to focus on making improvements to meet the needs of the students. In 1920 President Moore recommended the school purchase three pianos for the students to practice on. It was also at this time the school saw a series of academic lectures. From the beginning of its days to 1926 the school saw 15 different presidents. Bankruptcy plagued the school in 1925 and 1926. Contributors had overspent themselves. The school was left with two buildings. A board member Ed Richareds, gave the school $25,000 in an annuity. The college could not meet his terms as the loan turned into a direct loan involving children in the family. This led to a legal battle in these courts. This house was where Abe Lincoln used to stop on his journeys between Paris and Danville, Illinois. To save the school, the board voted in 1915 to sell 30 acres of land at $150 per acre. Just when the school had begun to get back on its feet, the Great Depression hit. A result of this was bankruptcy. , then president. Dr. T.W. Willingham bought back the property and saved it for the school in a Bankruptcy Sale. Students found themselves with no money. Students from farms would sometimes trade food needed in the kitchen, such as potatoes, for an education. During these hard times, faculty had to justify even getting paid a salary. One faculty member, it is said. Dr. Willingham asking for money to buy new shoes. In 1939 A.L. Parrott established the educational budget. Under this budget the churches would help to fund the cost to operate the college and pick up the slack that came from tuition and fees. The Olivet story seemed to be getting better, but it was soon to have another bad turn. On Sunday November 19, 1939, the Administration Building caught on fire. It was said that you could hear the grand pianos falling from the top floor to the basement. The Administration Building contained the chapel, library, science labs, administration offices, classrooms, and anything else the school needed academically. That Sunday morning with no hymnals, no offering plates and no place to meet the group met in a tabernacle in the woods. The Olivet community borrowed hymnals from someone's house and passed around hats to collect the annual Thanksgiving offering. It was said that they collected almost $2,000. 2 Opening ah Cook decides for the nursing ior to be the story of her life. for f ity[ tms at this time E.O.

The most important thing was that it had a big stone mitory with a fire hydrant right in front of it. So the school moved to the village of 600, called Bourbonnais. The 42 acres of school tained a lighted football field and several buildings we know today as Birchard Gymnasium, Miller Business Center, Walker Hall, ver Plant Campman Hall, and Burke Administration Building. Parrott negotiated the price of the school from $400,000 to $200,000. ; insurance company selling the school took the offer and knocked $5,000 off the price because they could not provide an appropriate trance (location of Maternity Church parking lot). The final cost of the new school was $195,000. George Wolff doesn't believe Lee Chamber's story, that he is Woody Webb. Freshmen start off their year with a picnic in the Bowlings' backyard.

The building was going to be used for coeducational ng with the ladies occupying the first two floors and the men on the top two floors. It was thought that this building could hold more ents than Olivet would ever have enrolled. The hallways were wide enough for the students to play in them, and best of all Champna running water in each room. It was then in 1941 that President Parrott made the school's name \"Olivet Nazarene College.\" In 1944, a ;r before it was designated to pay the school's dept. Olivet became debt-free. the end of the 40s, Harold W. Reed took over the presidency. Under Reed's 26 years of service the school saw multiple accredutatuibs, tteJexpansion of the campus to 160 acres, construction of major buildings, and development of significant traditions. lajor turning point in the Olivet story was its accreditation. In 1956 the school received full accreditation. In 1962 a master's degree in : gion was offered and in 1968 a master's was offered in education. 0 in the radical 60s, the school saw the welcoming of intercollegiate athletics. President Reed proposed the idea in 1959. In 1966 the lieral Board gave the go ahead to the idea with the exception of football because of the expense. April 16, 1963, the Olivet story had another twist in it figuratively speaking. It was a normal sunny day, and classes had just dismissed und 3:40 p.m. Twenty minutes later a dark funnel cloud formed and swept over Olivet. This tornado did close to $1,000,000 in damage. ; insurance settlement covered the rebuilding of the smokestack, a new fourth floor in Burke, clean up of the damage from 75 trailer nes, debris from 200 trees, and an elevator in Burke.

Sonnething interesting is bound to happen as those people interact as a comnnunity, and that connnnunity is what nnakes University Life. The university life stop/ began shortly after the school was started when the first dornn, Chapnnan Hall, was built in 1 906. As the years went by, students were involved ; in activities on campus such as Freshman Initiation, senior trips, a Halloween party, a Christmas dorm party, lawn parties and the Christmas Banquet. Chapel was held fourr times a week, and students were encouraged to be involved in many different campus organizations. \"Meeting as equals, living as friends, enriching our personalities, we created our activities.\" This is a quote from the 1945 AURORA, which is describing the formal and informal activities on campus. Although Olivet did not host events such asOllies Follies in 1945, the students found other ways to enjoy their time spent on campus, creating lasting friendships. As the years went Jill Stipp and Sarah Lenfield, going out on a \"roommate date.\" U n 1 V e r s i ty Life Beth Anderson, Marissa Murphy and Bianca Lucente sing back-up for Matt Meyer as he performs \"Song of the King\" for Broadway Revue.

What we <now today as Miller Business Center was known many years ago as Miller Dining Hall. It wasn't until 1966 that Ludwig Student Center was built, which provided a Diace for students to eat, relax after :lasses, and spend time with friends. Many activities that took place on DJivet's campus in the 1960s and 70s still Happen today. Ollies Follies is a tradition :hat has been around for quite a while, as A^ell as the Christmas Banquet, which dates back to before the 1940s. Students Darticipated in activities similar to our Costume and Candy Fest, and Homecoming coronation is a permanent structure in the history of Olivet. As the years go by, many traditions and activities are added to the university's life, creating nemories for students and faculty alike as students experience Olivet. Today, there are 2,514 students enrolled at Olivet, including all undergraduate, adult studies, and graduate students. Not only do these students receive an education at Olivet, but they learn to live and interact with others around them, through many activities and events that take place on campus. Olivet and its traditions help to shape these students and create a lifestyle that helps prepare them for life outside of Olivet. And so the university life story goes on... David Cortright, Ian Soper, Dave Allen and Jeremy Dale spend quality time in the dorms, pretending they're the characters in The Matrix. Divider 9 Back to School \"Welcome Back!\" These words were predominant in the dorms and classrooms as the students returned to campu; August. All over campus there were signs that the faculty and staff were ready for the new year. As usual, campus was significantly different since students left in May. There had been some additions to the campus, along with various changes made, plans completed and blueprints drafted. Among the completed tasks was the new Admissions Center, which is used ■ house the Office of Admissions and welcome visitors and prospective students to campus. Across the street from the Admissions Center burns the Eternal Flame, another addition to our campus. New landscaping was underway campus-wide throughout the beginning of the year, but possibly the most welcome change on campus was the addition of new parking spaces in Wisner Field. The changes on campus were not all physical; there were alterations made to the student curfew. Freshmen curfew remains the same, requiring students to be in their dorms by midnight on weeknights and 1 a.m. on weekends. Late passes are still allowed; however, freshmen are only allotted fifteen passes per semester. Sophomores and upperclassmen have a curfew of 1 a.m. on weeknights and 2 a.m. on weekends. Also inside the dorms was the addition of new furniture in some of the rooms. Selected rooms across campus received all new stackable furniture. As another year successfully began, students old and new alike were acquainted with a sense of community on the Olivet campus as we all strive toward furthering our education with Christ at the center of it all. by Chris Mabbitt Merideth Densford slaps Brad Yoder a high-five at the Freshman Picnic at the Bowlings' house.

School 11 Chapels When first told that they are required to attend two chapels per week, most students react rather negatively to the idea. However, aftei n low weeks of going to chapel, usually their opinion quickly changes; students ainnost begin to look forward to going to chapel. What is it that is so intimidating about chapel? Although the answer is unclear, it is clear that the way Olivet structures chapel, it is not just another time-consuming activity. Chapel is a time for students to stop everything else and worship God, a time to focus everything on Him. The chapels this year that included Robert Pickle, Siler's Bald, and Bill Bray definitely helped change student mindsets about chapel. And who could forget the offer to witness to pimps in Chicago? Through all the different varieties of chapels, one thing has remained the same: God has set aside this time for one reason, and that is to make us realize that we need to put aside time for Him everyday, and not just Wednesday and Thursday mornings. by Erin DeForge Top Right: Fall Revival speaker Jim Bond addresses the student body during a revival service.

Chapels 13 Ollies Follies Hee Haw! It's a Hillbilly Hoedown! That was the theme for the wild weekend of Ollies Follies this year. The event was fearlessly led by the vice president of social affairs, Lee Chambers. In addition to all the intramural sports that were played, Saturday afternoon was dedicated to the ever-popular crazy games. The classes battled against each other in messy competition, sacrificing themselves and their cleanliness to support their class. Along with the traditional events like tug-of- war and the human pyramids, the classes participated in wacky events like a pig chase, bobbing for hot dogs in ketchup and mustard, and, of course, the infamous fish and egg game. After the messy games were finished, even/one cleaned up and headed to Chalfant Hall that evening for Skit and Talent Night. Each class participated, entering one skit and one talent.

Quad Party One of the many traditions Olivet has had iroughout the years is the ever-anticipated uad parties. These were held in the Decker uadrangle occasionally throughout the year and ere open to any member of the student body, tie secret ingredient that makes a Quad party so Luch fun is that every party has a theme, each of hich is unique and original. Starting with the ckoff Quad party which had a NERD theme, udents couldn't help feeling more studious and iucated when they left. The annual Fall Fest uad party threw the student body into a londerful autumn mood.

By far, one of the most memorable things about the college years is living in the dorms. Sharing is definitely a key word in the act of dorm living. Residents share rooms, showers, sinks, toilets, halls and germs. They become subject to the music of neighbors at 4 a.m., subject to the sleeping schedule of roommates, and subject to the smell of burned popcorn, which is provided by that person down the hall who just can't seem to figure out the microwave. But along with all this sharing also comes the sharing of yourself. Not only do dorm residents see each other at their worst times, when they've been up all night cramming for a test, or when they've just woken up from a sound sleep, but dormmates share some of the most memorable experiences together. They are together after they've just passed that really tough final and after they've just gotten engaged, but the everyday times of life are what really count. The times spent just relaxing in the dorms, talking about anything and everything that's going on in your life - these are the times that will be remembered when students leave Olivet and head out into the world. by Anne Wadsworth Dorm Life 19 Joel Corzine just can't wait until next year's Fall Fest when his class can be in charge of it I Fall Fest Nothing brings in the annual fall spirit more than Fall Fest. Each year, Olivet's junior class presents the student body with this evening of fun, held at Rosenboom Farm. The junior class did an excellent job in planning the activities for the evening. There were prizes given away, delicious snacks to munch on, a big bonfire perfect for roasting marshmallows, and lots of laughs all evening. Some of the activities that took place throughout the evening included bobbing for apples, hay races, searching for a needle in a haystack, and a rousing game of Buck Buck. Topping off the evening was the crowning of the Pumpkin King and Queen, Jeff Forgrave and Cheri Littlefield. Everyone who attended had a great time on this evening that will not soon be forgotten!

Halloween is that special time of year when students are given the opportunity to dress up in any kind of costume, whether scary, adorable or funny, as they collect large amounts of candy and sweets. Olivet's Social Committee provided ONU students with an opportunity to do a little dressing up of their own as they participated in this year's Costume and Candy Fest. This year's fest, held in the dining room, featured entertainment by the ONU Jazz Band, as well as pumpkin decorating, cookies, cupcakes and video games. The highlight of the evening seemed to be the costume contest. Students used their creativity and unique qualities to come up with amazing costumes such as the Milby Clock Tower, Sonny and Cher, and a farmer girl. Prizes were handed out to several costume-wearers, but regardless of who won or didn't win, everyone who participated had a great time enjoying the music, food and company of their crazily-dressed friends. by Erin DeForge Costume and Candy Fest 21 Dedication Page There is no one more qualified and deserving to which we should dedicate the yearbook than sonneone who has been g major part of Olivet's NeverEnding Story. Jim Tripp has been a part of Olivet's staff for forty years, serving this institution in several different capacities during his years here. Mr. Tripp's chapter in the Olivet story began as he was an ONU student in the summer of 1960 and worked full time for Olivet in the maintenance department as a plumber's helper, assisting with maintenance repairs on campus. After serving in that capacity for three years, he began working in plumbing and maintenance in June of 1963, working on installation, repair anc maintenance of various parts of the campus. In 1965, Mr. Tripp graduated from Olivet with a degree in business administration and continued to work on campus serving as the assistant utilities engineer, responsible for the operation of boilers, plumbing and steam fitting. As the years went by, he served in several other positions on Olivet's staff until 1969 when he became the director of the physical plant, which is the position he continues to occupy today. As director of the physical plant, Mr. Tripp is responsible for the total physical plant operation. With this title comes many responsibilities, including directing operation of ths' central physical plant office, which encompasses many departments on campus such as safety and security, grounds, plumbing and heating, moving, transportation, and many other categories. Concerning his job, Mr. Tripp states, \"I love what I do! I enjoy coming to work in the morning.\" The decision to come to Olivet was made in 1960. \"I just wasn't satisfied with my life; I was doing construction work. One night, my wife and I were at a gospel sin'g, and we felt the Lord talking to us. I just felt like I needed to go to Olivet and finish my education, and she felt the same way. We knew that this had to be a calling from God. We have been here ever since.\" Mr. Tripp and his wife, Joan, have three children, Cinda, J.R., and Jeff, who have all graduated from Olivet and married Olivet graduates. For forty years, Jim has been committed to serving Olivet and its mission. \" I feel like anyone working here should be committed to the mission of the church. It's a great place to raise a family. At one time a job came up in Little Rock, but I chose Olivet because its community has a higher quality.\" While living in Bourbonnais, Mr. Tripp and Joan have gotten involved in many different aspects of community life. In 1974, Mr. Tripp was elected to be a member of the County Board, which he has now served on foE 26 years. He has served the board on several different committees. He currently is on a Public Safety Committee that is selecting a possible jail site. In addition he is also on five other committees. He is also a member of Kankakee First Church of the Nazarene and serves as a board member. In addition to serving Olivet with all of his heart for nearly 40 years, Jim has worked to make the physical plant a friendlyi Christian environment to work in. He says of the physical plant, \"We're different from a normal factory. We're more like a family We are all close. We should be different from the average university, and I think we are. I hope we don't lose our focus of who we are.\" It is because of this attitude and this commitment to serving Olivet and serving the Lord that the Aurora staff lovingly dedicates the 2000 Aurora to Mr. Jim Tripp. \"I feel like anyone working here should be committed to the mission of the church.\" Mr. Jim Tripp 22 University Life Mr. James R. Tripp Dedication Page 23 Presidents Page Never Ending Story-The Olivet story can be traced back to the first decade of the twentieth century and to the resolve of several families in east central Illinois who were committed to providing a Christian education for their children. Those founding families stood at the beginning of a new century and dreamed of a Christian college. They had no land, no buildings, no president, no faculty, no students - but they had a dream. Today, we stand near the beginning of another century and give thanks, for the dream became a reality and has endured and prospered over these many decades. Throughout its history. Olivet Nazarene University has sought to be a place where the best in learning is fully integratec with the best of faith. We exist to provide a liberal arts \"Education With a Chnstian Purpose.\" Our mission is to provide high quality academic instruction for the purpose of personal development, career and professional readiness, and the preparation c individuals for lives of service to God and humanity. The story of Olivet is the story of students and faculty and staff. It is history - yet more than that, it is HIS-story - the story of God at work building a school, a college, a university; God working with us, working for us, working in us, through us and sometimes in spite of us to bring His good will to pass. In 1907, classes began in a home in the community of Georgetown, and a year later the founders acquired several acre of land in the nearby village called Olivet. Here they raised a modest building and added the secondary level of instruction. A college of liberal arts followed in 1909. By the 1911-1912 school term, the student body was gaining numerical stability with students from 12 states, Canada and England. The founders and trustees were aware of the school's need for a wider constituency and offered to give their educational work to the Church of the Nazarene, which accepted it with the pledge of continued support. The 1915 Catalog was the first document to carry a section titled \"Purpose.\" It reads in part as follows: \"The chief end of man is to glorify God and enjoy Him forever.\" The great purpose of any true educational institution must be to assist men to meet successfully this end. Our desire is to provide opportunities that will develop all that is best in man; to establish a strong center of spiritual power and holy culture that will flow forth as a mighty stream of influence to the four quarters of the earth; to help young men and women to an equipment that will enable them to successfully fill the different vocations of life and promote the kingdom of Christ. While exalting the intellectual we magnify the spiritual. We seek the strongest scholarship and the deepest piety, knowing that they are thoroughly compatible. The officers and teachers seek to impress upon the students the necessity of obedience to Christ, as well as high scholastic attainments.\" Throughout its history. Olivet Nazarene University has sought to be a place where the best in learning is fully integratec with the best of faith. It has not always been easy. There have been moments of testing and trial, and several moments of high drama, such as June 10, 1926, when the college was sold at public auction in a bankruptcy sale held on the steps of the administration building. That afternoon in a striking move. Dr. T W. Willingham stepped forward from the crowd to purchased the college bach in an effort to keep the dream alive. Then there were the wee hours of the morning on Sunday November 19, 1939, when fire destroyed most of the origin campus south of Danville, leading to the relocation of the university to its present location in Bourbonnais. A generation later c the afternoon of Thursday, April 17, 1963, a tornado swept down upon this campus, taking with it the top floor of Burke Administration Building, the smoke stack, Trailerville and more. There have been moments of great revival - when the Spirit swept down upon this campus and classes were dismissed and the altars were filled and filled and filled again. This is a great story we share. It is the story of the passing of an Olympic-like torch from one generation to the next. The Olivet story is a people story: men and women who invested a life in this great endeavor - women and men now remembered in brick and mortar, stone and steel. Folks with names such as Nesbitt, Larsen, McClain, Strickler, Gibson, Ide, Snowbarger, Hills, Reed, Burke, Chalfant, Kelley, Hopkins and others. These have now rested from their labors, and we nowfi their shoes, their classrooms, their offices. The story of Olivet Nazarene University is in reality a collection of stories which are renewed and expanded each year, i Every person pictured here has a story of his or her own - and those stories together comprise the Olivet story. The AUROR/ provides the perfect vehicle to preserve these stories.

Family Weekend 33 Life Stories j^ Chorus and orchestra members perform during the annual presentation of Handel's Messiah. I radition is something that makes Olivet what it is today. Tradition has been a tie that binds together the Olivet story, allowing students, old and new, to relate to one another and share in the memories of the events of days gone by. The events story began with the early days of the school. In 1922, Olivet students participated in various annual activities such as Homecoming, a Thanksgiving Day celebration, Bible conference, and the Annual Aurora Campaign. Even in 1934, Olivet held two revivals during the year- a fall revival and a midwinter revival. In 1936, Olivet hosted the first presentation of Handel's Messiah, which was performed by the Messiah Chorus. As the years went by. Olivet students enjoyed attending and performing in various plays, including \"The Happy Journey,\" by Thornton Wilder; and \"The Prodigal Son,\" by Edward Finnegan. In 1950, the student body also enjoyed attending performances by Chi Sigma Rho, which presented \"Self expression through choral reading and dramatizations.\" Also in This group of banquet-goers smiles for a picture. Stage Managers Shannon Garrett and Jason Holmes look on as Chad Schumacher addresses the audience during \"Our Town.\" 1950, the senior class took a trip to Pennsylvania and Washington, D.C. Students jattended parties for Valentine's Day, Halloween, and Christmas, while faculty mennbers enjoyed a faculty Christmas party. In addition to these festivities, various banquets were held throughout the year for special occasions. During the 1999-2000 year. Olivet students had the opportunity to attend many vents. In keeping with the tradition started so long ago, two revivals were held during the school year, as well as the 64th oresentation of Handel's Messiah. In addition to those events, students were able to attend or participate in the fall play, Thornton Wilder's \"OurTown.\" And, of :ourse, the Christmas Banquet was the highlight of the Christmas season as students dressed in their finest to attend this Danquet, put on by the Social Committee. Some of these traditions have been carried throughout the decades, while others have faded with time. Still, Olivet students can look back and remember the various events that they participated in that helped to make Olivet the place that each individual student looks back on and fondly remembers. ^■■1 ^^^^1 ■ ■■ ^^^m^^^^ ^^^^^B^i 'JHHHI HBB SHHh ^^^^^^Hj^^D^^^ ^^K^ ■i^^SHk.\" ■^ ;^'5*Vi^jM ^^^K ^^^^'■^^^H ■ ^^^^^^^K' \" -><^4fP^. ^ 1 I And so the events story goes on...

Events 35 Fall Play As the leaves turned and the tennperature fell... and rose... and fell again, the students of Olivet Nazarene University began once again to settle down into their daily routines of studying, socializing and perhaps the nnost innportant of all, yet under-practiced, sleeping. Some, however, found release fronn such routine by becoming involved in the fall play, \"OurTown,\" b] Thornton Wilder, which is a touching story that revolves around Grover's Corners, a small town in New Hampshire, around the turn of the century. , \"The conglomerate makeup of persons in the show,\" explained James Netzel, sophomore, \"is what made it so : successful.\" And successful it was. \"OurTown\" brought in an impressive revenue and received numerous compliments from students and staff alike. Netzel went on to say, \"It takes a tightly knit cast to make a show great, and that's something we definitely had going for us.\" The cast of the play was made up of veterans to Olivet's stage and newcomers alike. The two character leads, George and Emily, were taken on by Josh Vance and Tanya Baker, while the narrative leads were taken on by Shannon Garrett and Jason Holmes. Supporting roles were portrayed by Erin Sudduth,Tim Koerner, Joelle Heilemann and CoreyT Wilson. Adding some community life to the play were children from the community, including Luke OIney, Rachel Martinson, Josh Penley and Josh Hedding. In the director's chair was Professor Jeff Wells, with Tim George and Keely Long assisting. Tim Koerner summed up the show by saying, \"It shows real life in a small way. It glorifies life in general to the point where it can be appreciated to the degree that it deserves.\" by CoreyT Wilson Wally and Emily Webb (Hedding and Baker) discuss tlieir upcoming day at school with their mom (Heilemann).

This year, Olivet continued a 64-year-old tradition with the perfornnance of Handel's Messiah. The Messiah tells in music the story of the prophecy, birth, life, death and resurrection of Jesus Christ. This year's Messiah was conducted by Dr. Jeff Bell. The perfornnance was held in Kresge auditoriunn instead of Chalfant or College Church as in previous years because of the better acoustics that Kresge offers. Also new to this year's Messiah was the addition of a rarely perfornned section that includes an alto-tenor duet, an alto solo and a chorus. There were two performances of Messiah this year, one held on Saturday, December fourth, and the other held on Sunday, December fifth. The Saturday night performance featured alumni soloists Mary Atkinson, alto, class of 1994; Neal Woodruff, tenor, class of 1991 ; and Greg Yates, bass, class of 1981. Also featured was Olivet's professor Martha Dalton, soprano, aTrevecca graduate. Sunday night's performance featured Olivet soloists Jessica DeZwaan, soprano; Jennifer Kell, alto; Chad Ozee, tenor; Lee Chambers, tenor; and Justin Nixon, bass. The University Orchestra, Choral Union, Orpheus Choir, Men's Choir and Women's Choir were all involved both evenings. This event helped to carry on an Olivet tradition that helps to make the Christmas season more memorable and helped all who attended to focus on the reason for the season. by Kati Ondersma Messiah 39 Christmas Banquet The last Christmas Banquet of the century united the students and faculty alike in a diverse cultural celebration of what the true meaning of Christmas is all about - Jesus' birth. This year's banquet theme was Christmas Around the World. Students enjoyed the company of each other while dining on a delightful traditional dinner produced by Marriott. The mood of the evening was unforgettable as the music department's Dr. Jeff Bell provided a classic array of vocal and instrumental melodies. The social committee outdid themselves planning every detail, including the unique decorations. Specific areas of the room represented different countries. Each table was decorated according to its appropriate region of the world, including the North Pole, complete with Santa Claus, portrayed by Wendy Parsons.

Olivet has taken these building blocks fronn years of experience and innproved how professors teach their pupils. The acadennic story began with the early days of the school. In the year 1918 students were offered the options of Music, Expression, Practical Sciences, and Grannmar School. The students were encouraged to share what they had learned in their classes in the fornn of writings were then sometimes published in the school's Later, in 1928 the school's Bible College was flourishing within several areas. The students made up several subdivisions such as Called Missionaries and Student Pastors. \"This social group (religion majors), made by God was intended to be the most sacred institution of the human race,\" said George Reader in the 1928 AURORA.

The art department is practically a second home to the nearly 70 art majors and their professors. One aspect that make this department so exceptional is the combination of professionalism with a family-like atmosphere. The professors are not only instructors, but also practicing artists, providing a great example to their students. From early morning to late evening, it seems that someone from this large \"family' is always downstairs in Larsen making art. ONU's art department is constantly expanding, with some notable changes made over the past few months. Department head, Professor Bill Greiner states that \"the influx of students has been phenomenal.\" To meet the needs of the growing numbers of students, the university funded some new features to improve the Department of Art. The graphics lab has been transformed from a classroom setting to a business office with new computers, furniture, and equipment. With a majority of art majors concentrating in graphic design. Professor Greiner is pleased with the new facility, which \"sets [higher] standards for graphic students at Olivet.\" In addition, new lighting systems have been added to two classrooms, along with the much-needed exhaust system in the painting room. Outside of classes, art students have the opportunity to experience art on many other levels. Professor Greiner and Professor Kinzinger have worked hard to bring outside artists to Olivet for exhibits several times throughout the academic year. In addition, the professors have arranged that art majors have the opportunity to visit Chicago art galleries on a regular basis, for \"Art Nights. \" Overall, the Department of Art is thriving, creating incredible art on a daily basis. With the variety of teaching methods and new resources in the art department, students have the privilege of pursuing their major in a variety of ways. In this \"age of expansion\" of the art department. Professor Greiner observes that, \"the quality of the art being produced is exceptional.\" by Katie Sullivan N, Top: J Jennifer Hatchell diligently molds her pot.

Biology is a unique major. It is the only nnajor where people can play with deadly bacteria and are encouraged to slice open cats. The biology program at Olivet includes a variety of classes which are a strong basis for the variety of careers the students will pursue in the future. The biology classrooms are progressively becoming more state-of-the-art as well. The anatomy and physiology classroom received a face lift a year ago, and this past summer the microbiology lab was completely remodeled, making the working environment more spacious and efficient. Biology students spend a large amount of time in the lab and studying, which usually causes them to interact with faculty. The faculty are willing to help students in their learning and even go as far as having a biology party twice a year to help bridge the gap between the faculty and students. Being a biology major is not easy; it takes a lot of dedication and self-sacrifice. However, in the long run, hopefully all of the hard work will payoff. by Lana Vanagasem Biology 51 Above: Nadia Jantz-Neal, Anthony Juras, Dave Evans, and Uma Reddy vocalize their questions in Intermediate Finance.

Students study hard learning to be successful in the business world while maintaining Christian integrity. This sets Olivet's business department apart from other schools' programs. Even though the focus is business, it is not \"all work and no play\" on the third floor of Burke. Students in Free Enterprise, or S.I.F.E., organizes an annual Make A Difference Day to promote volunteerism throughout the Kankakee community. The Business Club organizes several fun social events during the school year.

However, it is not too complicated for the common student to learn about. The chemistn/ department has many courses, but they all involve chemistry, and even include the name \"chemistry\" . This is different because a lot of departments tend to have several varieties of courses. A couple of interesting things about this department are its involvement in the American Chemical Society and the cooperative courses it offers. This ACS society has local, regional and national section meetings, where the faculty from ONU attend, along with an occasional student. There are also cooperative courses offered with colleges in Chicago. Usually, ONU students meet up with others in the Argon labs, just southwest of Chicago. Something new at the chemistry department is the new biochemistn/ concentration. Professor John Hanson says, \"This gives the students a broad background for the interface between the two departments. \" Two of the profession options for graduates are, of course, chemists and teachers. Chemists are needed in pharmaceutical labs and in factories to give quality assurance of material testing. Many students continue with further education, as with any department. Many go into business or law, where science is something good to have under your belt to prove things in the business world. by Joslyn Williamson Above Left: Randall Goodwin compares his formula to the book's example.

This department deals with software development, creating software, how to work networks, hardware, and how computer systems are built. The science part of the name is where students study computer systems and behavior. They also learn and know how to design systems. The students are more like engineers in that they want to accomplish and have the materials to accomplish what they want to. This year the computer science department received all new computer equipment. Instead of Windows 3.1, the computers now have Windows NT. With this, they have new servers and networks. They are also going to be changing the language from Pascal to Java, which is \"probably the biggest change in the department since 1985,\" says Dr. Larry Vail. Java is a more modern computer language, so it is a good idea for the department to switch over. Most professions in Computer Science include programmers, programming analysts, and network and systems managers. The Computer Informations Systems majors usually take on user or text support. by Joslyn Williamson -• lOve: Matthew Shotts works diligently to finish writing his program.

Throughout our years of growing up, there have been specific individuals who have helped nnold us into the people we are, and those include the teachers we have had throughout the years. Education is a degree that nnany Olivet students pursue. They are students who have a goal to change the lives of others. The focus of the Olivet Nazarene University Division of Education is to prepare students for effective teaching in preschool, elennentan/ and secondan/ schools. The students in the education division stay busy throughout the year doing practicuums at many of the schools in Kankakee County. One of the challenges some of the students faced was the fear of losing their practicuum hours due to a strike at one of the local schools. Overall, the students who major in education at Olivet will walk off this campus with the privilege to teach students and help mold their students into the individuals they will become. Education 59 60 Engineering ENGINEERING The engineering and physics department focuses on education in engineering science and design. The mission of the engineering department is to produce a quality engineering curriculum within a Christian setting so that students may be well prepared for an engineering career. At ONU, students may choose an emphasis in mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, or a nonengineering field. Olivet's engineering department strives to develop academic discipline and integrity in its students through its tough curriculum and state-of-the-art equipment. While at Olivet, engineering students will complete courses that form the foundation for engineering design and understanding of the scientific method. Engineering students will develop their design skills by intensely studying the engineering design process. Communication and oral skills are also an area of focus for engineering majors. The Technical Communication course ensures that, as engineers, students are able to make clear points and communicate their ideas well. John Zook becomes very perplexed while working on his engineering homework. £ M Adam Barriger carefully enters the information into the computer.

English majors are well suited to enter careers in education, business and the media, among other areas. A major in English is also beneficial for students interested in prelaw and preseminary studies. ely Long reads her exam carefully before answering the questions.

English 63 FAMILY AND CONSUMER SCIENCES 64 Family and Consumer Science The 1999-2000 academic year saw an increase in Family and Consumer Sciences' enrollment, mainly in the area of education, an exciting phenomenon due to the need for teachers in this field. Olivet's accreditation from the American Dietetics Association was renewed for another 1 0 years, making it one of few Christian colleges in the nation to have such a program. The FACS Department includes five majors: dietetics, housing and environmental design, fashion merchandising, FACS and FACS education. Despite their diversity, the five majors are joined as one under the motto: \"All for one and one for all!\" This motto is based on I Corinthians 12:12-13, 27-31 in which Paul reminds Christians that they have been baptized as one and are a part of one body. by Kati Ondersma Family and Consumer Science 65 lH*^ y >.'4 , * «•, .i •;' V H'J '•^« 4-^ ;-., • >;'■ '.■■««^ \"f< ^i' ' ^■.' /Above; Jen Palinski, Lisa Neufeld, Justin Neufeld, and Dave Tabbert try to get a rocl< group started.

The word means \"study of the earth,\" but Olivet's geology department seems just about endless in the options area. The careers and opportunities are fun and interesting. The geology department includes classes in both geology and astrology. The classes offered at Olivet are the basic geology courses, as well as. Frontiers in Astronomy, which involves current research; Platetarium Operations, where a student learns how to run the planetarium for a possible campus job; and a new class. Earth's Weather, for those students interested in studying meterology. There are many excting things going on in the department. Every year, the department takes field trips in the Midwest, and every other year, trips are taken to the Southwest to popular observatories. Possible trips this year are northern Wisconsin and southern Illinois. In Illinois, students will visit the Garden of the Gods and caves to observe the unique effects from the glacial period. The Career options are endless for this department. Some students, of course, continue their studies. Others become science teachers, geologists, hydrologists, geo-chemists, or help in the federal or state government, major corporations, and consulting firms. Professor Brock Schroeder says that the geology students \" leave Olivet and have successful careers. \" by Joslyn Williamson Top Left: Erin Mooreland checks her test score.

Both teaching and nonteaching minors are also offered. Many of Olivet's math graduates are now teaching in junior and senior high schools. Along with math education, several of Olivet's recent graduates have started careers in actuary science, working in insurance and financial planning fields. Math majors get their fair share of funny looks when others learn of their field of choice. \" God calls different people to do different things. Math can be fun and exciting or dull and terrifying. It all depends on your point of view, \" said senior Dan Remmenga. \"Math should be entertaining, not something to dread.\" bove: Amy Brischle and Christine Casteel write down review notes for a test. alow: One class plus two pages of note equals three credit hours.

The overall curriculum of the department was changed, adding and deleting required courses for music majors and minors. The choral ensembles were also remodeled to give the department more diversity and to serve more students. Instead of two mixed choirs, ONU now has one mixed choir, Orpheus Choir, directed by Jeff Bell; a women's choir, directed by Martha Dalton; and a men's choir, directed by Don Roddick. Other ensembles include University Orchestra, directed by Jeff Bell; Concert Band, directed by Don Roddick; and Jazz Band, directed by Eric Penrod. by Anne Wadsworth 1 u s i c 71 72 Nursing NURSING The mission of the Division of Nursing is to provide a Christian nursing education designed to prepare graduates for entry into professional nursing. The students in the nursing departnnent here at Olivet don't wait to junnp into the real-thing. Beginning their sophomore year, the students begin doing clinical work at one of the local healthcare facilities. The clinical experiences allow the students to apply what they have learned in the classrooms to real life. The nursing students are also responsible for running the blood drive that is held on campus each year. Overall, through the classroom lessons and clinical experiences, the students develop the skills that are needed to help provide for the medical needs of others. The students are prepared to enter the professional nursing field with a strong foundation in Christian nursing education.

At Olivet, physical education majors will find that they can receive professional training as well as participate in service programs. Olivet's intramural and intercollegiate programs are sponsored by the physical education department. The PHED department's goals are to promote good health practices in students, to develop Christian character through teamwork and good sportsmanship, to promote wise use of free time, and to provide skills necessary for effective service to society. Students may choose a general PHED emphasis, physical education teaching, or athletic training. Paul Shipman and Chris Pluister are eager to catch all that Coach Brenda Patterson has to say.

Students are given the opportunity to see the role Christianity plays in history, politics and our culture. Students also learn more about politics outside of the Western Hemisphere. Students with a political science major study current ethical debates in a public setting and learn to appreciate the freedoms as well as the challenges of the American political system. All the while, students may grasp and refine their roles as both Christians and Americans. by Erin Fields Pol i ti cal Sci ence 77 PSYCHOLOGY The objective of the Depattinent of Psychology is to acquaint students witii the science of behavior and the principles which contribute to optimal personality developnnent, good interpersonal relationships, and the effective understanding and influence of human behavior. The Department of Psychology offers the training that is necessary to prepare students for graduate school programs and careers in psychology. Psychology students choose a concentration of Personnel Psychology or Counseling Psychology. The students are then required to take general, experimental and clinical courses to satisfy the requirements for their degree.

In the 1999-2000 school year, over 100 students were enrolled in the departments of social work, sociology and criminal justice. These departments have undergone several changes. The first change was the appointment of a new department chair. With the completion of his dissertation. Dr. Kent OIney has been appointed the chair of the Division of Social Sciences. Along with the appointment of a new chair, the division has been in the process of searching for a faculty member to teach in and lead the Criminal Justice department beginning in the fall of 2000. The social work department has also had a busy and exciting year. The department has been working on receiving its reaccreditation of the social work program. This will accredit the social work program for eight years. These departments have had a busy, but exciting year preparing students for their future careers in the fields of social services. These students will be prepared to help provide for the social welfare of others when they walk across the stage with their diploma in hand. p: DeMesha Lewis and Evelyn Hardwick are distracted by the photographer )ove: How interesting it is!

Speech communication offers four concentrations: broadcasting, film studies, general, and journalism. Depending upon the specific focus of each course, courses may be intensive writing or speaking classes. Also in the Division of Communication, students may choose a Modern Languages major: French, Spanish, or a Romance Languages major that includes both French and Spanish. The Modern Languages program is designed to enable students to speak, read, write and understand the language. Students often cam/ a related major or minor in social work, communications, business or education. by Erin Fields lodern Language/Speech 83 ur laf ^^U *^J Above: During a field training exercise, ROTC students board a CH-47 Ctiinool< lielicopter for a familiarization exercise.

Skills obtained by students in ROTC are essential for military and civilian success. Military Science is broken into two sections, the Basic Course and the Advanced Course. The Basic Course requires six semester credit hours total. The Advanced Course requires four semester courses in addition to an advance camp during the summer after the junior year. Upon enrolling in the Advanced Course, students contractually agree to complete all ROTC training courses and agree to accept a commission in either active or reserve Army units.

ROTC 85 Cast of Characters begin to realize that these friendships are ones that will be innportant to us The friendships that we establish at Olivet are not just formed with in the dorms, but with the faculty and staff that we come into contact with also important to our experience at Olivet. The faculty and staff are not just Olivet employees, but they are our friends. They care about things that are happening in our lives, they care about our struggles and our triumphs. As we look back over our college years, the most vivid memories will be those that we spent with our friends. These times are irreplaceable. Need a ride? Kathy Jewell, Marci Reynolds, Wendi Anderson, Jodie, Lindgren, Rosette Jewell, Nancy Bretzlaff, and Anders Lindgren would be happy to give you one. People.... Everyday come in contact with people. Relationships with people are what make life at Olivet such an amazing experience, As freshmen, we walk into a whole new world where we are bombarded with unfamiliar and overwhelming surroundings. During that time, we find people who help us to make the transition from home to college easier. As we grow closer to the friends that we make those first few weeks of school, we for years to come, people that we hang out with everyday. These bonds are There is nothing like spending time together while enjoying good treats. At least that is what Marcy Miller, Elisa Bruining, Tony Mason, Jackie Evenson, Chad Griffin, Tom Dorries, and Teresa Miller think. Peopl e Hanging out with friends is what forms the bonds that tie us all together. Jeanine Wendell, Merideth Densford, Bethanie Harrier, Shannon Boytz, Anne Giovanni, Amy Williams, Erin Alderson, and Susie Clarke celebrate a friend's birthday. Jnfortunately, we often take our time at Olivet or granted. This is probably the only time in )ur lives when we will be surrounded by )eople our own age, when we can walk next loor and hang out with friends, when we can tay up all hours to watch movies and munch )opcorn with our closest friends. These days it Olivet are a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, nd the people that we meet here are unlike my other that we will ever meet again. It is up to us to take advantage of the opportunities to build friendships at Olivet. Ve should spend time hanging out and elaxing with our friends. We take time to am valuable lessons from our professors as )eople of faith who have walked the paths we low walk and are walking the paths that we vill one day walk. We should take time to stop and talk to the wonderful people who take time to make our campus look so leautiful. We should take time to make connections with each and every person we come in contact with. Life at Olivet is an incredible experience, but it would not be the same without those who walk the paths of this campus with us. And so the story of the people goes on...
