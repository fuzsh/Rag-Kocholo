        "text": "Psychology papers should\n\nAddress all parts of the prompt.\n\nUse research and empirical evidence to support all points.\n\nBe concise and clear.\n\nFormatting\n\nWriting in APA\n\n12 pt, Times New Roman font\n\nDouble-spaced with 1”margins\n\nHeader (cover page is different than other pages)\n\nCover page header: Running Head: TITLE OR ABBREVIATED TITLE\n\nHeader for rest of paper: TITLE OR ABBREVIATED TITLE\n\nPage numbering starts on the cover page\n\nReferences\n\nDouble-spaced\n\n½ ” hanging indent from the margin on all lines after the first in an entry\n\nSee “References” page for examples\n\nResearch papers: Sections\n\nAbstract\n\nIntroduction\n\nLiterature review (past tense: “Roberts showed” or present perfect tense: “researchers have shown”)\n\nMethods (past tense or future tense in the case of a proposal)\n\nResults (past tense)\n\nDiscussion (present tense)\n\nReferences\n\nAppendices (if needed)\n\nDo’s and don’ts\n\nDo\n\nUse active voice instead of passive wherever possible.\n\npassive: The experiment was conducted by Roberts.\n\nactive: Roberts conducted the experiment.\n\nUse “I” and “we” sparingly or not at all, and only use “I” and “we” when referring to researchers, not when referring to people in general.\n\nUse person-first language. For example, “people with autism” instead of “autistics.”\n\nRemember that “data” are always plural.\n\nUse the word “participants” instead of “subjects.”\n\nDon’t\n\nUse direct quotes (they can be used, but should be used sparingly. Paraphrase whenever possible).\n\nUse absolutes such as “completely”, “absolutely”, “always”, etc.\n\nUse immodest expressions such as “prove”. Use words such as “suggest”, “support”, “show”, or “indicate” instead.\n\nUse overly complex sentence structures. The goal is clarity.\n\nUse colloquial or informal writing style, especially slang.\n\nUse contractions.\n\nUse biased language.\n\nThe male pronoun (he) does not refer to everyone.\n\nDefine people by what they aren’t. Rather than saying someone is “non-white”, say they are Latino, for example.\n\nAssume readers will know what you mean. Define all acronyms, jargon, theories and ideas fully.\n\nOther useful tips and tricks\n\nProofread.\n\nEdit.\n\nMake sure everything is cited, and cited correctly.\n\nAvoid common grammatical errors.\n\nWrite the paper over time instead of in one sitting, and edit and proofread over time.\n\nNever be afraid to ask a professor for clarification if something is unclear.\n\nReferences\n\nAmerican Psychological Association.
