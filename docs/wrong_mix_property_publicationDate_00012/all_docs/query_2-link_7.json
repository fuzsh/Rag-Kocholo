        "text": "Some will call it the Lord's Supper, others the Eucharist, or the Lord's Table. But this celebration is essential to the life of the church. This paper looks at Biblical presuppositions for the Table, some philosophical principles for celebrating the table, and some pragmatic examples from my parish. The goal is to ensure that people understand this is not some dry tradition, but God in our midst.\n\nThis paper explores the meal scenes in Mark's gospel and examines the theme of Divine Hospitality in the Old Testament. In doing so, a connection is made between the table fellowship of Jesus and the Kingdom of God. The article concludes by reflecting upon ecclesiological practices of the Eucharist in light of the inclusivity of table fellowship. The argument is that by attending to the meal scenes in the gospel of Mark, an understanding of the Kingdom of God manifests and should shape the way the Church practices hospitality.\n\nWhat stands behind the basic contemporary arrangement of liturgical space? Is is simply an alternative to 'ad orientem'? Does it reveal a key aspect of Christian eucharistic theology? These issues are explored in this paper."
