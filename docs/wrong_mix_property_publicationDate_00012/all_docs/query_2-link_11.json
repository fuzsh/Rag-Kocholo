Gray may, however, have begun writing the poem in 1742, shortly after the death of his close friend Richard West. An elegy is a poem which laments the dead. Gray’s “Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard” is noteworthy in that it mourns the death not of great or famous people, but of common men. The speaker of this poem sees a country churchyard at sunset, which impels him to meditate on the nature of human mortality. The poem invokes the classical idea of memento mori, a Latin phrase which states plainly to all mankind, “Remember that you must die.” The speaker considers the fact that in death, there is no difference between great and common people. He goes on to wonder if among the lowly people buried in the churchyard there had been any natural poets or politicians whose talent had simply never been discovered or nurtured. This thought leads him to praise the dead for the honest, simple lives that they lived.\n\nGray did not produce a great deal of poetry; the “Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard,” however, has earned him a respected and deserved place in literary history. The poem was written at the end of the Augustan Age and at the beginning of the Romantic period, and the poem has characteristics associated with both literary periods. On the one hand, it has the ordered, balanced phrasing and rational sentiments of Neoclassical poetry. On the other hand, it tends toward the emotionalism and individualism of the Romantic poets; most importantly, it idealizes and elevates the common man.\n\nAuthor Biography\n\nBorn in the Cornhill district of London in 1716, Gray was the son of Dorothy Antrobus Gray, a milliner, and Philip Gray, a scrivener. Gray’s father was a mentally disturbed and violent man who at times abused his wife. Gray attended Eton School from 1725 until 1734, when he entered Cambridge University. He left Cambridge in 1738 without taking a degree, intending to study law in London. However, he and childhood friend Horace Walpole embarked on an extended tour of Europe. The two separated in Italy in 1741 after a quarrel, and Gray continued the journey on his own. He returned to London later in the year, shortly before his father died. Gray then moved with his mother to Stoke Poges, Buckinhamshire, and began his most productive period of poetic composition. In 1742 Grey wrote his first major poem, “Ode on the Spring,” which he sent to his close friend Richard West—unknowingly on the very day of West’s death from tuberculosis. In the next three months Gray wrote “Ode on a Distant Prospect of Eton College,” “Hymn to Adversity,” and “Sonnet on the Death of Mr. Richard West.” It is believed that he also worked on “Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard” during this time, though this poem was not published until 1751. Gray returned to Cambridge at the end of 1742 and received a Bachelor of Civil Law degree the next year. Gray lived at the university for most of the rest of his life, but he never took part in tutoring, lecturing, or other academic duties; instead he pursued his studies and writing, taking advantage of the intellectual stimulation of the setting. In 1757 Gray was offered the position of Poet Laureate, but he declined it. He moved to London in 1759 to study at the British Museum and remained there for two years. He read widely and earned a reputation as one of the most learned men in Europe. Except for regular trips back to London and elsewhere in England, Gray stayed in Cambridge from 1761 until the end of his life. In 1768 Gray was named Regius Professor of Modern History at Cambridge, an office he held until his death in 1771.\n\nPoem Text\n\nThe Curfew tolls the knell of parting day,\n\nThe lowing herd wind slowly o’er the lea,\n\nThe plowman homeward plods his weary way,\n\nAnd leaves the world to darkness and to me.\n\nNow fades the glimmering landscape on the sight, 5\n\nAnd all the air a solemn stillness holds,\n\nSave where the beetle wheels his droning flight,\n\nAnd drowsy tinklings lull the distant folds;\n\nSave that from yonder ivy-mantled tower\n\nThe moping owl does to the moon complain 10\n\nOf such, as wandering near her secret bower,\n\nMolest her ancient solitary reign.\n\nBeneath those rugged elms, that yew-tree’s shade,\n\nWhere heaves the turf in many a mouldering\n\nheap,\n\nEach in his narrow cell for ever laid, 15\n\nThe rude Forefathers of the hamlet sleep.\n\nThe breezy call of incense-breathing Morn,\n\nThe swallow twittering from the straw-built\n\nshed,\n\nThe cock’s shrill clarion, or the echoing horn,\n\nNo more shall rouse them from their lowly bed. 20\n\nFor them no more the blazing hearth shall burn,\n\nOr busy housewife ply her evening care:\n\nNo children run to lisp their sire’s return,\n\nOr climb his knees the envied kiss to share.\n\n25\n\nOft did the harvest to their sickle yield,\n\nTheir furrow oft the stubborn glebe has broke;\n\nHow jocund did they drive their team afield!\n\nHow bowed the woods beneath their sturdy\n\nstroke!\n\nLet not Ambition mock their useful toil,\n\nTheir homely joys, and destiny obscure; 30\n\nNor Grandeur hear with a disdainful smile\n\nThe short and simple annals of the poor.\n\nThe boast of heraldry, the pomp of power,\n\nAnd all that beauty, all that wealth e’er gave,\n\nAwaits alike the inevitable hour. 35\n\nThe paths of glory lead but to the grave.\n\nNor you, ye Proud, impute to These the fault,\n\nIf Memory o’er their Tomb no Trophies raise,\n\nWhere through the long-drawn aisle and fretted\n\nvault\n\nThe pealing anthem swells the note of praise. 40\n\nCan storied urn or animated bust\n\nBack to its mansion call the fleeting breath?\n\nCan Honor’s voice provoke the silent dust,\n\nOr Flattery sooth the dull cold ear of Death?\n\nPerhaps in this neglected spot is laid 45\n\nSome heart once pregnant with celestial fire;\n\nHands, that the rod of empire might have swayed,\n\nOr waked to ecstasy the living lyre.\n\nBut Knowledge to their eyes her ample page\n\nRich with the spoils of time did ne’er unroll;

110\n\nAnother came; nor yet beside the rill,\n\nNor up the lawn, nor at the wood was he;\n\n“The next with dirges due in sad array\n\nSlow through the church-way path we saw him\n\nborne.\n\nApproach and read (for thou can’st read) the lay, 115\n\nGraved on the stone beneath yon agéd thorn.”\n\nThe Epitaph\n\nHere rests his head upon the lap of earth\n\nA youth to fortune and to fame unknown.\n\nFair Science frowned not on his humble birth,\n\nAnd Melancholy marked him for her own. 120\n\nLarge was his bounty, and his soul sincere,\n\nHeaven did a recompense as largely send:\n\nHe gave to Misery all he had, a tear,\n\nHe gained from Heaven (’twas all he wished) a\n\nfriend.\n\nNo farther seek his merits to disclose, 125\n\nOr draw his frailties from their dread abode,\n\n(There they alike in trembling hope repose)\n\nThe bosom of his Father and his God.\n\nPoem Summary\n\nLines 1-4\n\nIn the first stanza, the speaker observes the signs of a country day drawing to a close: a curfew bell ringing, a herd of cattle moving across the pasture, and a farm laborer returning home. The speaker is then left alone to contemplate the isolated rural scene. The first line of the poem sets a distinctly somber tone: the curfew bell does not simply ring; it “knells”—a term usually applied to bells rung at a death or funeral. From the start, then, Gray reminds us of human mortality.\n\nLines 5-8\n\nThe second stanza sustains the somber tone of the first: the speaker is not mournful, but pensive, as he describes the peaceful landscape that surrounds him. Even the air is characterized as having a “solemn stillness.”\n\nLines 9-12\n\nThe sound of an owl hooting intrudes upon the evening quiet. We are told that the owl “complains”; in this context, the word does not mean “to whine” or “grumble,” but “to express sorrow.” The owl’s call, then, is suggestive of grief. Note that at no point in these three opening stanzas does Gray directly refer to death or a funeral; rather, he indirectly creates a funereal atmosphere by describing just a few mournful sounds.\n\nLines 13-16\n\nIt is in the fourth stanza that the speaker directly draws our attention to the graves in the country churchyard. We are presented with two potentially conflicting images of death. Line 14 describes the heaps of earth surrounding the graves; in order to dig a grave, the earth must necessarily be disrupted. Note that the syntax of this line is slightly confusing. We would expect this sentence to read “Where the turf heaves”—not “where heaves the turf”: Gray has inverted the word order. Just as the earth has been disrupted, the syntax imitates the way in which the earth has been disrupted. But by the same token, the “rude Forefathers” buried beneath the earth seem entirely at peace: we are told that they are laid in “cells,” a term which reminds us of the quiet of a monastery, and that they “sleep.”\n\nLines 17-20\n\nIf the “Forefathers” are sleeping, however, the speaker reminds us that they will never again rise from their “beds” to hear the pleasurable sounds of country life that the living do. The term “lowly beds” describes not only the unpretentious graves in which the forefathers are buried, but the humble conditions that they endured when they were alive.\n\nMedia Adaptations\n\nJ. Norton Publishers/Audio-Forum has produced an audiocassette entitled How Shelley Died; Elegy in a Country Churchyard: Two Lectures (1979) with Gilbert Highet.\n\nCaedmon has produced an audiocassette set (of 4 disks) entitled Eighteenth Century Poets and Drama (1970).\n\nSpoken Arts Corporation has produced an audiocassette set (of 6 disks) entitled Great English Literature of the 18th Century (1971).\n\nPerspective Films has produced a videocassette entitled Elegy to Thomas Gray (1980).\n\nMonterey Home Video has produced a video-cassette entitled The Poetry Hall of Fame: Volume IV (1994) from the BBC series “Anyone for Tennyson?”\n\nLines 21-24\n\nThe speaker then moves on to consider some of the other pleasures the dead will no longer enjoy: the happiness of home, wife, and children.\n\nLines 25-28\n\nThe dead will also no longer be able to enjoy the pleasures of work, of plowing the fields each day. This stanza points to the way in which the “Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard” contains elements of both Augustan and Romantic poetry. Poetry that describes agriculture—as this one does—is called georgic. Georgic verse was extremely popular in the eighteenth century. Note, however, that Gray closely identifies the farmers with the land that they work. This association of man and nature is suggestive of a romantic attitude. The georgic elements of the stanza almost demand that we characterize it as typical of the eighteenth century, but its tone looks forward to the Romantic period.\n\nLines 29-32\n\nThe next four stanzas caution those who are wealthy and powerful not to look down on the poor. These lines warn the reader not to slight the “obscure” “destiny” of the poor—the fact that they will never be famous or have long histories, or “annals,” written about them.\n\nLines 33-36\n\nThis stanza invokes the idea of memento mori (literally, a reminder of mortality). The speaker reminds the reader that regardless of social position, beauty, or wealth, all must eventually die.\n\nLines 37-40\n\nThe speaker also challenges the reader not to look down on the poor for having modest, simple graves. He suggests, moreover, that the elaborate memorials that adorn the graves of the “Proud” are somehow excessive. In this context, the word “fretted” in line 39 has a double meaning: on the one hand, it can refer to the design on a cathedral ceiling; on the other hand, it can suggest that there is something “fretful,” or troublesome, about the extravagant memorials of the wealthy.\n\nLines 41-44\n\nThe speaker observes that nothing can bring the dead back to life, and that all the advantages that the wealthy had in life are useless in the face of death. Neither elaborate funeral monuments nor impressive honors can restore life. Nor can flattery in some way be used to change the mind of death. Note here Gray’s use of personification in characterizing both “flattery” and “death”—as though death has a will or mind of its own.\n\nLines 45-48\n\nThe speaker then reconsiders the poor people buried in the churchyard. He wonders what great deeds they might have accomplished had they been given the opportunity: one of these poor farmers, the speaker reasons, might have been a great emperor; another might have “waked … the living lyre,” or been a great poet or musician.\n\nLines 49-52\n\nThe poor were never able to fulfill their political and artistic potential, however, because they were uneducated—they never received the “Knowledge” that would enable them to rule and to create. Instead, “Penury,” or poverty, “froze the genial current of their soul.” That is, poverty paralyzed their ability to draw upon their innermost passions—the very passions that could have inspired them to become great poets or politicians.\n\nLines 53-56\n\nIn a series of analogies, Gray observes that the talents of the poor are like a “gem” hidden in the ocean or a “flower” blooming in the desert. Just as an unseen flower in the desert is a “waste,” Gray suggests, the uneducated talents of the poor are also a “waste,” because they remain unused and undeveloped.\n\nLines 57-60\n\nThe speaker then compares these poor, uneducated people to three of the most famous and powerful people of the previous century: John Hampden, a parliamentary leader who defended the people against the abuses of Charles I; John Milton, the great poet who wrote Paradise Lost and who also opposed Charles I; and Oliver Cromwell, Lord Protector of England from 1653 to 1658. The speaker suggests that buried in this churchyard might be someone who—like Hampden, Milton, or Cromwell—had the innate ability to oppose tyranny, but never had the opportunity to exercise that ability.\n\nLines 61-64\n\nThis person, the speaker reasons, with the proper education and resources, might have “commanded” the government as well as any great political leader. Note, however, that Gray gives us two ways in which to consider this power. On the one hand, a great ruler can receive applause and can ignore “threats of pain and ruin.” A great leader can “scatter plenty,” can offer prosperity, to a grateful nation. But on the other hand, if one governs, one is, in fact, exposed to dangerous threats. And simply governing to receive “applause” suggests a shallow and self-serving motive. Moreover, “scattering plenty” implies that the wealth of a nation can be squandered by its rulers. Gray may be suggesting that having power is not as desirable as it seems. Note that the final line of this stanza is enjambed; it continues into the following line—and in this case, the next stanza.\n\nLines 65-68\n\nThe first line of this stanza continues the thought of the previous, enjambed line. It abruptly reminds us that the impoverished conditions of the poor “forbade” them from becoming great rulers. Gray underscores the abrupt shock of this idea by abruptly interrupting the flow of the line with a caesura. Building on the idea of the previous stanza, the speaker notes that if poverty prevented the country laborers from acquiring the “virtues” of great and powerful people, it also prevented them from committing the “crimes” often associated with those people—and especially with those people who hold political power. In particular, it prevented them from engaging in the bloody activity associated with the British Civil War.\n\nLines 69-72\n\nBecause these farm laborers were not in positions of power, the speaker reasons, they never had to ignore their own consciences. Nor did they sacrifice their artistic talents (the gift of the “Muse”) to “Luxury” or “Pride.”\n\nLines 73-76\n\nThe speaker continues his praise of the simple life of common people. They are “far from the madding crowd” of city and political life. “Madding” here can mean either “maddening” (that is, the source of madness or insanity) or it can mean “mad” (that is, the crowd is itself hatefully insane). In either case, the common country people were removed from this insane world; as a result, they never “strayed” into the immoral acts of the powerful. Instead, they kept steadily to their simple but meaningful lives.\n\nLines 77-80\n\nThe speaker then reminds us that these common people are, in fact, long dead. He notes that even if they were not powerful or great, and even if they do not have an elaborate memorial of the sort mentioned in line 38, they still deserve homage or tribute. At the very least, he suggests, an onlooker should “sigh” on seeing their graves. Note here the multiple meanings we can attach to the word “passing.” It can refer to the onlooker, who is simply walking or “passing by” these graves. It can mean “in passing”—that someone seeing these graves should take just a moment out of their busy lives to remember the dead. And “passing” itself is a euphemism for death. In a way, then, Gray is suggesting that there is no difference between the person “passing” by the grave and the person who has “passed” away—another reminder that all will eventually die.\n\nLines 81-84\n\nInstead of “fame and elegy,” the people buried here have modest tombstones, which display only their names and the dates of their birth and death. These common people were not famous, and no one has written elaborate elegies or funeral verses for them. Still, the very modesty of their tomb-stones testifies to the nobility and “holy” nature of their simple lives. As such, they provide an example not so much of how life should be lived, but how its end, death, should be approached. The term “rustic moralist” here is open to interpretation. It may refer to anyone who is in the countryside thinking about the meaning of death. But more likely, it refers to the speaker, who is himself moralizing—preaching or contemplating—about the nature of both life and death.\n\nLines 85-88\n\nThe speaker reasons that most people, faced with the prospect of dying and ultimately being forgotten, cling to life. Note Gray’s use of paradox in line 86: “this pleasing anxious being.” On the one hand, “being” or living can be “anxious,” filled with worries. On the other hand, just being alive— when faced with death—is itself “pleasing” or pleasant. The speaker is suggesting that even the troubles and worries of life are enjoyable in comparison to death.\n\nLines 89-92\n\nThe dead rely on the living to remember them and to mourn for them. The speaker suggests that this need is so fundamental that even from the grave the buried dead seem to ask for remembrance. In fact, as line 92 suggests, the dead actually live on in our memories.\n\nLines 93-96\n\nIn this stanza, the speaker addresses himself. He reasons that since he himself has been mindful of the dead, and has remembered and praised them in this poem, perhaps when he is dead someone will remember him. This person, he reasons, will necessarily be a “kindred Spirit,” someone who is also a lonely wanderer in the country, meditating on the nature of death. The speaker then goes on to imagine his own death: he envisions this “kindred Spirit” seeing his (the speaker’s) grave and wondering about his life and death.\n\nLines 97-100\n\nIn the next five stanzas, the speaker imagines how an old farm laborer might remember him after his death. If, the speaker speculates, the “kindred Spirit” sees the speaker’s grave and wonders about it, perhaps an old man might offer to describe the speaker. The old man would say that the speaker was often seen wandering about the countryside at dawn. Presumably, he was frequently out all night—as, no doubt, he has been in this very poem.\n\nLines 101-104\n\nAt noon, the old man continues, the speaker would frequently stretch out under an old tree at noon, and stare at a nearby brook.\n\nLines 105-108\n\nThe old man would have observed that the speaker’s moods were changeable: sometimes the speaker would wander about in the nearby woods, “smiling scornfully” and talking to himself; other times, he would appear depressed; then again, sometimes he would look as though he were in anguish. Perhaps, the old man speculates, the speaker had been “crossed in hopeless love.”\n\nLines 109-112\n\nThe speaker continues to imagine this old man remembering him after his death. The old man would have noticed one morning that the speaker was absent: he was not in any of his favorite spots. Likewise, the old man would remember, the speaker did not appear the following day.\n\nLines 113-116\n\nThe third day, however, the old man and his friends would have seen the speaker’s body being carried to the churchyard for burial. (The speaker, then, is imagining himself buried in the very graveyard he once used to wander by.) The old man invites this curious passerby, or “kindred Spirit,” to read the speaker’s epitaph. Note the reminder that the old man is uneducated: he cannot read, although the passerby can do so.\n\nLines 117-120\n\nThe last three stanzas are, in fact, the speaker’s epitaph; the way in which the speaker imagines his epitaph will read. Through the epitaph, the speaker asks the passerby (and the reader) not to remember him as wealthy, famous, or brilliantly educated, but as one who was “melancholic” or deeply thoughtful and sad.\n\nLines 121-124\n\nThe speaker asks that we remember him for being generous and sincere. His generosity was, in fact, his willingness to mourn for the dead. Because he was so generous, the speaker reasons, heaven gave him a “friend”—someone who would, in turn, mourn for him after his death. This friend is unnamed, but we can deduce that it is any “kindred Spirit”—including the reader—who reads the speaker’s epitaph and remembers him.\n\nLines 125-128\n\nThe speaker concludes by cautioning the reader not to praise him any further. He also asks that his “frailties,” his flaws or personal weaknesses, not be considered; rather, they should be left to the care of God, with whom the speaker now resides. The poem, then, is an elegy not only for the common man, but for the speaker himself. Indeed, by the end of the poem it is evident that the speaker himself wishes to be identified not with the great and famous, but with the common people whom he has praised and with whom he will, presumably, be buried.\n\nThemes\n\nDeath\n\nGray’s “Elegy” is one of the best-known poems about death in all of European literature. The poem presents the reflections of an observer who, passing by a churchyard that is out in the country, stops for a moment to think about the significance of the strangers buried there. Scholars of medieval times sometimes kept human skulls on their desktops, to keep themselves conscious of the fact that someday they, like the skulls’ former occupants, would die: from this practice we get the phrase memento mori, which we say to this day to describe any token one uses to keep one’s mortality in mind. In this poem, the graveyard acts as a memento mori, reminding the narrator to not place too much value on this life because someday he too will be dead and buried. The speaker of the poem is surrounded by the idea of death, and throughout the first seven stanzas there are numerous images pointing out the contrast between death and life. After mentioning the churchyard in the title, which establishes the theme of mortality, the poem itself begins with images of gloom and finality. The darkness at the end of the day, the forlorn moan of lowing cattle, the stillness of the air (highlighted by the beetle’s stilted motion) and the owl’s nocturnal hooting all serve to set a background for this serious meditation. However, it is not until the fourth stanza that the poem actually begins to deal with the cemetery, mentioned as the place where the village forefathers “sleep.” In the following stanzas, the speaker tries to imagine what the lives of these simple men might have been like, touching upon their relations with their wives, children, and the soil that they worked. They are not defined by their possessions, because they had few, and instead are defined by their actions, which serves to contrast their lives with their quiet existence in the graveyard. This “Elegy” presents the dead in the best light: their families adored them and they were cheerful in their work, as they “hummed the woods beneath their steady stroke.” The speaker openly admits that they are spoken of so well precisely because they are dead, because death is such a terrible thing that its victims deserve the respect of the living. In line 90, the poet explains, “Some pious drops the closing eye requires,” explaining that the living should show their respect for death with their sorrow.\n\nSearch for Self\n\nThe speaker of this poem goes through a process of recognizing what is important to him and choosing how to live his life (which leads to the epitaph with which he would like to be remembered). In stanza 8, the poem begins naming the attributes that are normally considered desirable but are now considered pointless when compared with the lives of the rustic dead in the country graveyard. Ambition and Grandeur, according to the speaker, should not think less of these people because of their simple accomplishments. He goes on to assert that Pride and Memory have no right to ignore them, and that Honor and Flattery will be as useless to the rich as to the poor when they are dead. The speaker, an educated person, gives much consideration to the subject of Knowledge, and whether the lack of it made the lives of these country people less significant. Their poverty blocked the way to knowledge, he decides, and the lack of knowledge separated them from vices as well as virtues, so that in the end he does not consider his education a factor in making him better or worse than them either. In the end, having eliminated all of the supposed benefits of the wealthy, educated world that he comes from, the speaker identifies himself with the graveyard inhabitants to such a degree that he winds up in this humble graveyard after his death. In contrast to the simple graves that he pondered over throughout his life, though, the speaker’s grave is marked with a warm-hearted memorial, the “Epitaph” at the end of the poem. Assuming that such a thoughtful person would not have been so immodest as to write this epitaph for himself, there must have been some other literate person to remember him. He is also remembered by an illiterate member of the farm community, the “hoary-headed swain” who has to ask someone to read the epitaph. Before the death of the poem’s narrator, this Swain established a nonverbal relationship with him, observing him from afar, wondering\n\nTopics for Further Study\n\nDo you think the speaker of this poem is sentimentalizing the forgotten people in the country churchyard, or is he giving them the recognition they deserve?

Explain what you think about this issue.\n\nabout him just as the narrator wondered about the country people buried there.\n\nClass Conflict\n\nA superficial reading of this poem might leave the impression that the author intends to present members of the lower class as being more worthy of praise than their upper-class counterparts. This would be a reasonable assumption, since so much of the poem is devoted to praising the simple virtues of the poor. In the larger scope, though, the position that Gray takes is that all people, poor or rich, are equal. This is a meditation on death, which has been called the “great equalizer” because no can avoid it. The reason that the poem seems to favor one class over the other is that it is working against the assumption that only those of the upper class are worthy of attention when they die. It is the humble condition of the country churchyard, with gravestones unmarked or possibly marked just with names by illiterate people unable to read, that draws attention to the virtues of the poor and uneducated (which society often forgets), and so much of the poem is spent praising their moral strength. The virtues of the wealthy and famous are not denied, they just are not explored in this poem because they are already so familiar. Evidence of the poem’s evenhandedness about the different classes can be seen in the fact that, while praising the poor country people throughout, Gray also acknowledges that education, which may give them opportunity to develop moral excellence, may also lead them to corruption: as he says in stanza 17, the humble circumstances of the poor limited the growth not only of their virtues but also of their crimes. The poem thus leaves open the question of superiority. Society glorifies the rich, and the poem’s narrator glorifies the poor, but, as he reminds us, “The paths of glory lead but to the grave.”\n\nStyle\n\n“Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard” is written in heroic quatrains. A quatrain is a four-line stanza. Heroic quatrains rhyme in an abab pattern and are written in iambic pentameter. An iamb is a poetic foot consisting of one unstressed and one stressed syllable, as in the phrase “the world.” Pentameter simply means that there are five feet in each line. Consider, for instance, the first line of Gray’s “Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard”:\n\nThe Curfew tolls the knell of parting day.\n\nWhen we scan the line, or identify its stresses, it appears as follows:\n\nTheCur / few tolls / the knell / of part / ing day.\n\nTry reading the line aloud: its regular, steady rhythm helps to creates a calm and quiet mood— one appropriate to the meditative nature of this poem.\n\nHistorical Context\n\nWhen Thomas Gray was writing this poem, the world was going through a period of intellectual development that thinkers of the time dubbed the “Age of Enlightenment.” The Enlightenment was a philosophical movement that grew out of the great advances made by scientists in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. One key example which ended up having great influence on the Enlightenment was Sir Isaac Newton’s theory of universal gravitation, which proposed laws that explained and predicted the behavior of matter in all circumstances everywhere. Newton published this theory in his book Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica in 1687, and it marked a turning point in the history of science. At the same time, this idea of the power of rationalism was growing in the area of philosophy. Thinkers such as Rene Descartes (1596-1650) and Baruch Spinoza (1632-1677) took up the idea of rationalism, attempting to apply the methods of scientific inquiry to the field of philosophy; Descartes’ famous statement “I think, therefore I am” represents his attempt to start with the one simple truth that he could be sure of about the world, which was that he himself existed. In political science, Thomas Hobbes (1588-1679) explored the interrelations of social interactions in such works as The Elements of Law, Natural and Politic, and John Locke (1632-1704) explained human intelligence as being the sum of what is learned through experience, not the God-given right of a few.\n\nBy the start of the eighteenth century, intellectuals throughout the world were excited about the new Age of Enlightenment, which promised humanity new hope for controlling the world’s problems. At first, though, the Enlightenment’s enthusiasts were considered dangerous radicals. They rejected tradition that was not backed up with solid rational explanation, and tradition was the basis for most rulers’ political power. Royalty ruled by relation to previous rulers, and landowners feasted while peasants starved because of rights based on inheritance, but rationalism served to undermine such rights and to blur class distinctions. In particular, the Catholic Church, which had been a strong influence in European politics for centuries, was threatened by the skepticism of Enlightenment thinkers who felt society should be organized according to rational rather than religious principles. As religious explanations of the universe lost credibility to scientific explanations that were based on observation, the Church took a defensive position, jailing free thinkers for heresy when they published theories that contradicted church tradition. In earlier times, Galileo, for example, was imprisoned for supporting the Copernican heliocentric view of the solar system. In the early 1700s, the church clashed frequently with Enlightenment theorists who made even minor claims about the nature of man and society that could be considered heretical. By the middle of the century, when Thomas Gray wrote\n\nCompare & Contrast\n\n1751: Benjamin Franklin, flying a kite in a thunderstorm with a key at the end of the string, discovered the fact that lightning behaves like electricity and flows through conductive material.\n\nToday: Control of electricity is one of the fundamental principles of our society.

To some extent, the poem displays Enlightenment principles in the way that the speaker shows faith that the rural poor could be intelligent and successful if they had proper education, reflecting Locke’s theory of the mind as a “blank slate” that is ready to grow. The pessimism he shows, though, regarding the potential for corruption if the poor were educated, is contrary to the standard Enlightenment optimism about the good that will result from education.\n\nThe high point for the Enlightenment was the American Revolution in 1776. This marked the beginning of a society based on rationality and fairness, not tradition. The basis for the American Revolution was that people living in North America would now be better able to decide what was best for them than a king living in England, reflecting a faith in the common person’s ability to reason. The Declaration of Independence is a major philosophical work concerning the rights of human beings to determine their own fates. The end of the Enlightenment as an intellectual movement came soon after, however, with the French Revolution from 1789 to 1799. Like the revolution in America, the French Revolution was an attempt to let individuals control their own destinies, based on faith in reason, which Enlightenment thinkers had been advocating for nearly a hundred years. While the American Revolution created a new society, however, the French Revolution created chaos, a bloodbath of government suppression of revolutionaries and public executions of deposed government figures. In the end, the oppressive system of feudal land ownership was abolished, but only at the end of a bitter struggle that required both sides to focus their attention on jingoistic slogans. The ideal of rationality became lost with the emphasis on the rights of individuals and the belief that the simple, uncorrupt poor know better than the pampered rich. The Enlightenment gave way to the age of Romanticism, which emphasized an almost mystical belief in individuality and the goodness of nature.\n\nCritical Overview\n\nOver the years, Gray’s “Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard” has received extensive critical attention. Critics have long recognized Gray’s “Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard” for its restrained and dignified expression of simple truths. In Lives of the English Poets, Samuel Johnson praised the poem for its universal appeal and its originality: “The ‘Churchyard’ abounds with images which find a mirrour in every mind, and with sentiments to which every bosom returns an echo are to me original…. Had Gray written often thus, it had been vain to blame, and useless to praise him.” Other writers, such as Samuel Coleridge and Matthew Arnold, also admired the work, although Arnold’s criticism was somewhat cautious. Arnold noted in his Essays in Criticism that “the ‘Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard’ is a beautiful poem … But it is true that the ‘Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard’ owe[s] much of its success to its subject, and that it has received a too unmeasured and unbounded praise.”\n\nIn the twentieth century, critics have often observed two competing “voices” or attitudes in Gray’s writings. Joseph Wood Krutch, in his introduction to The Selected Letters of Thomas Gray, offers a useful comparison of the classical and Romantic tendencies in the “Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard.” Krutch maintains that there are certainly strong romantic qualities in the poem, but that it is more clearly identifiable with the eighteenth century: “there is nothing mystical, at least nothing transcendental, in the ‘Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard.’ It is everywhere stubbornly rational, even in its melancholy. The simple life, even the life close to nature, is good because it is healthful and free from great temptation, not because God dwells in a sunset.” In more recent years, critical attention has been focused on Gray’s complex use of language. Some critics have noted a degree of ambiguity in Gray’s syntax. One critic, W. Hutchings, argues in an essay in Studies in Philology that this ambiguity tends to “undermine” the apparently secure or simple universe that Gray has depicted. Hutchings notes, “there is an extraordinary degree of instability about [the ‘Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard’], one which often expresses itself by making its syntax fluid, even indeterminate. Far from being something to be amended or ignored, this quality is the key to the ‘Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard.’” We notice, then, a transformation in the way in which this poem has been viewed: early critics tended to praise the poem for its simple truths; more recent critics, however, have begun to wonder if underneath these apparently simple truths there are more troubling questions.\n\nCriticism\n\nDavid Kelly\n\nDavid Kelly is an instructor of literature and writing at several community colleges in Illinois, as well as a fiction writer. Here, he examines Gray’s “Elegy” as a reflection of social conscience, finding it to be advanced in identifying the problems of a class-based society but lacking in solutions.\n\nThe most common interpretation of Thomas Gray’s poem “Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard” is that it is an expression of sympathy and support for those who have the misfortune to be without money or social prestige. When critics do not approach it from this angle, they almost always look at it as a broader philosophical statement about how fortune in this world ends up being no help to the dead, an interpretation that rests almost entirely upon line 36, “The paths of glory lead but to the grave.” These are both pertinent ideas that Gray does cover, but they’re fairly obvious ideas to readers today, and either could have been adequately dispatched in a poem a third as long. We have to question how obvious such ideas about social rank would have been in the feudal monarchy of Gray’s England, circa 1750. If Gray was a thinker ahead of his time, then the ideas that we take for granted may have been unheard of to his peers.\n\nIt would be almost impossible to believe that people before Gray wished anything but the best\n\nWhat Do I Read Next?\n\nThe most authoritative edition of Gray’s poetry is the edition originally published by the Oxford Press in 1966, entitled The Complete Poems of Thomas Gray: English, Latin and Greek. H. W. Starr wrote the introduction and edited the book with J. R. Hendrickson.\n\nJohn Dyer is a Welsh pastoral poet who wrote at the same time as Gray. His greatest works, including “Grongar Hill,” considered one of the first romantic pastoral poems, are included in the collection Poems, 1761.\n\nSamuel Johnson was the outstanding literary figure of Gray’s time. Among his writings was the ten-volume Lives of the Poets, which includes a brief biography of Gray, as well as a number of poems that he wrote himself. He is best known today for the biography that James Boswell wrote about him, The Life of Samuel Johnson, considered one of the best biographies ever and an important source for readers who want to understand the British literary scene in the eighteenth century.\n\nGray wrote during the Age of Enlightenment, a period of intense intellectual activity throughout the world. One of the leading thinkers of the time was French Philosopher Rene Descartes, who is often credited with adding humanity to the age of ideas. His Discourse on Method and the Meditations is still considered one of the world’s most important philosophical works.\n\nThomas Gray is often considered a poet ahead of his time, who predated the Romantic Movement that swept across the globe approximately fifty years later. More than his contemporaries, his contemplative style, and concern for humanity are often compared to the works of William Wordsworth, one of the founders of Romanticism. Wordsworth’s “Lines Composed A Few Miles Above Tintern Abbey, on Revisiting the Banks of the Wye During a Tour, July 13th, 1798,” has a much looser structure than Gray’s “Elegy,” but there is a similarity in the melancholy of both poems.\n\nRichard Gough’s The History of Myddle was written between 1700 and 1706, chronicling the lives of people living in the small English town of Myddle in Shropshire. This rural history is probably as close as one can get to reading about the lives of the people discussed in Gray’s “Elegy.” A 1980 edition of Gough’s book is available, with an introduction by Dr. Peter Razzell.\n\nfor victims of misfortune. After all, as the word itself indicates, misfortune has two significant characteristics: it is bad, and it happens because of luck or chance, fortune. By its basic definition, people with bad luck cannot be blamed, and that makes them innocent sufferers. To that extent, Gray seems to have brought nothing new to the question of human relations, just the circular argument that those who do not deserve misfortune do not deserve it. The fact is, though, that the issue has never been as clear-cut as that. There is the question of whether the poor, such as the struggling farmers that Gray talks about, have been cast their lot by random chance, or whether they might not actually be collecting exactly what they deserve.\n\nWe see this same question arise just as clearly, if not more so, in contemporary America. In our two-party system, the general attitude toward poverty and its related problems, such as poor education and health, shifts from one side of the spectrum to the other every generation or so. One party is dominant during a time when the general public believes that the poor are neglected, and as a result spending for social programs will increase; a few years later, the prevailing mood will hold that the poor are coddled and therefore lack the will to raise themselves out of poverty, and spending then decreases. The issue seems to balance on the question of just how much the people involved are responsible for their own positions as part of the\n\n“The ‘Elegy’ has an inconsistency in praising the inherent worth of the simple country people while pretending that their lives are somehow less for having not received the benediction of a poet before.”\n\nunderclass, and therefore how much sympathy they deserve.\n\n“Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard” appeared at one of those cultural moments when change was in the air but had not quite arrived. In a piece celebrating the two hundredth anniversary of the “Elegy”’s publication, Carl J. Weaver provided an inventory of “the originality of Gray’s democratic sympathy”: the American Revolution was twenty-five years away, and the French Revolution forty; it was to be twenty years until Oliver Goldsmith would write of “a bold peasantry, their country’s pride,” and still another twenty-five after that until Robert Burns framed the simplicity of the democratic spirit with “A man’s a man, for a’ that.” Ideas of equality may be at the core of the society we live in, but they were exceptional when Gray wrote.\n\nThis apparently was the reason why he felt the need to go to such lengths to help his readers know the simple country people he was writing about. They were not the lazy, stupid brutes his readers would have to believe they were in order to believe that they deserved to live in poverty and obscurity. They worked hard at “useful toil,” their children loved them, and they asked for little in return. These were not easy people to ignore, by Gray’s standard: their virtues should have made them stand out as society’s finest, and he writes with bitterness that they were left to rot in obscurity in tiny churchyards while men and women not nearly as useful or loved rested under marble monuments.\n\nAs a vindication of the poor, this poem does excellent work: like all of the best works of social conscience, it knows how to handle its audience, making our hearts swell with pride for the virtues of the downtrodden. This is where the regular rhythm and unyielding rhyme scheme fit in, by assuring readers of the inevitability of this view of the simple country folk and not just a limited view of one select group. The problem is that, having imagined the greatness of the “rude Forefathers” so well and rendered them so convincingly, Gray did not have any idea about what he should do about their descendants that labored on. He was hardly the revolutionary. As much as he opposed inequity, still he was not ready to call for some sort of Marxist social reorganization that would bring the intellectuals and civil servants to the farms and give plowboys their turn in the House of Lords. The best that Gray could come up with to compensate for the opportunities that had been denied these simple country people was the complaint that they should have memorials on their graves as nice as those that mark the remains of social luminaries, in acknowledgment of the fact that they could have been important too, given the chance.\n\nThe problem with having nothing to offer but praise and recognition is that the poem burns up the value of praise on its way to affirming the commoners’ self-worth. “Can storied urn or animated bust / Back to its mansion call the fleeting breath?” the poem asks, and the answer, of course, is no. “Can Honor’s voice provoke the silent dust, or / Flattery sooth the dull cold ear of Death?” Since they can’t, then just what are we supposed to do about those who died without recognition? The poem expends much of its energy convincing readers that these people lived valuable, useful lives and that memorials are for the Proud and the Vain, but it also wants to stir our sense of pathos over the fact that they do not have grand memorials. As William Empson has pointed out, referring to the fourteenth stanza of Gray’s “Elegy” in his essay “Proletarian Literature,” “a gem does mind being in a cave and a flower prefers not to be picked.” The occupants of the churchyard may have had bad lives, but that is not their own view, it is the judgement of an onlooker, the speaker of the poem: it is the same voice that simultaneously warns us not to be so arrogant as to assume that their lives are worthless.\n\nIn the end, there is nothing the speaker can offer but himself. Literary historians have gone back and forth for two-and-a-half centuries about who the young man elegized at the end is supposed to be: Gray, his recently deceased friend Richard West, a townsperson, or someone completely new. One thing that seems certain is the bond between him and the speaker of the first 116 lines; the melancholy of the nightfall in the first stanzas perfectly matches the young man’s “drooping, woeful wan” muttering as he looked out over the cemetery. The attitudes and sensibilities which take their effect on readers throughout the 29 initial stanzas have already affected the “youth to fortune” who is buried there, and so his way of dealing with social inequity can be taken as the poem’s result.\n\nThe answer this poem offers for the fact that good people who lack social prominence are left forgotten after death is for a prominent person to climb down into the grave with them, to be buried beside them and to raise up at least one large monument with a lofty epitaph within that forsaken cemetery. It is a much more temperate solution than calling for a revolution to disrupt the social structure (like the revolutions that were to come later in that century). It is at least more active than simply walking away from the problem and concluding that the downtrodden must somehow deserve the fate dealt them. Lacking a burning indignity about the way things are but unable to sit comfortably with it, Gray’s young man, steeped in sadness, opts for a show of solidarity to mock the rules that say he is from a different “set” than the farm people.\n\nIs it effective? There is no way to tell from the way the poem leaves things. Generally, rejection of one’s class privileges and identifying with the downtrodden only produces the minimal effect of making one’s relatives and former friends sigh and wink, unless the class advantage is used to pry some good out of the situation. A child of wealth from a gated suburban community who goes to live in the inner city in order to upset conventional assumptions is likely to just make people think he or she has an inflated sense of importance, while a physician who goes to an impoverished area to work is both an inspiration and a practical asset. The “Elegy” has an inconsistency in praising the inherent worth of the simple country people while pretending that their lives are somehow less for having not received the benediction of a poet before. This is reflected in the egoism in believing that having the body of a beloved young man from a good home among them is somehow an enriching experience for the rural dead. Gray’s heart was in the right place, far ahead of its time in terms of his thoughts on social equity, and with no models for him to draw from we shouldn’t be surprised that his attempt to bridge the chasm of social class would reflect the very prejudices he was trying to overcome.\n\nSource: David Kelly, in an essay for Poetry for Students, Gale, 2000.\n\nAviya Kushner\n\nAviya Kushner is the Contributing Editor in Poetry atBarnesandNoble.comand the Poetry Editor of Neworld Magazine.

Her writing on poetry has appeared in Harvard Review and The Boston Phoenix, and she has served as Poetry Coordinator for AGNI Magazine.

In the following essay, Kushner describes the pastoral qualities of the “Elegy,” which contribute “to the sense that it tells a universal story which spans both nations and centuries.”\n\nOne of the most famous poems in the history of the English language might never have been published if its author had had his way. Thomas Gray never tried to publish “Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard,” and was quite dismayed to find that a journal he didn’t like much chose to print it.\n\nOnce it was published—through a friend of Gray’s who sent a copy in to the journal—the “Elegy” was a hit. The poem’s grip on the readers of its time was no temporary fluke. Today, the “Elegy” still resonates with readers around the world. Much of that resonance is due to the great classic literary texts the “Elegy” borrows from, and the major human stories it manages to contain. The Book of Ecclesiastes, Dante’s Inferno and Purgatorio, and the pastoral visions of Virgil all lie quietly beneath the poem, contributing to the sense that it tells a universal story which spans both nations and centuries.\n\nFittingly, the elegy of timeless topics begins in slow motion:\n\nThe Curfew tolls the knell of parting day,\n\nThe lowing herd wind slowly o’er the lea,\n\nThe plowman homeward plods his weary way,\n\nAnd leaves the world to darkness and to me.\n\nThe words “toll,” “lowing,” and “slowly” physically decrease the speed of the poem. The numerous “l”s in the first stanza produce a lull, and the reader literally “plods his weary way” along with the poet.\n\nAs Henry Weinfield observes in his book The Poet Without a Name: Gray’s Elegy and the Problem of History, there are numerous opportunities for sound here. The plowman and the herd both make noise, and yet, the overwhelming impression\n\n“The poet then details the sounds of the countryside—the cock in the morning, the swallow, the echoing horn—which are not heard by the dead. While the opening stanza may have detailed a still silence, the dead and buried know an even stiller silence.”\n\nof the first stanza is silence. It is this deep and carefully controlled silence, presented in exact rhyme and pristine pentameter, that gives the opening a timeless feel.\n\nWith its mention of the herd, the opening stanza also positions itself in the pastoral tradition—the line of poetry based on songs sung by shepherds. Pastoral poetry often involves nostalgia for a past, but that past doesn’t necessarily exist. Instead, pastoral poems often look back longingly on an idealized time where purity and virtue supposedly ruled.\n\nMusically, the second stanza maintains the silence of the first. Late afternoon is turning to evening:\n\nNow fades the glimmering landscape on the sight,\n\nAnd all the air a solemn stillness holds,\n\nSave where the beetle wheels his droning flight,\n\nAnd drowsy tinklings lull the distant folds;\n\nThe movement of the day, from afternoon to dusk to dark, is just one of the movements the “Elegy” will address. Day and night foreshadow life and death, along with labor and the end of labor, and the building and destroying of personal history.\n\nThe plowman is progressing on his journey as day turns into evening. And soon, he reaches the churchyard, where beneath “rugged elms” and the “yew-tree’s shade,” the “rude Forefathers of the hamlet sleep.”\n\nThe poet then details the sounds of the countryside—the cock in the morning, the swallow, the echoing horn—which are not heard by the dead. While the opening stanza may have detailed a still silence, the dead and buried know an even stiller silence.\n\nThese buried forefathers not only don’t hear anymore, they also don’t see and feel. They don’t see their children or their wives, and they don’t gaze upon the fireplace. This inactivity doesn’t mean they weren’t active in their lives. In fact, they worked very hard:\n\nOft did the harvest to their sickle yield,\n\nTheir furrow oft the stubborn glebe has broke;\n\nHow jocund did they drive their team afield!\n\nHow bow’d the woods beneath their sturdy stroke!\n\nAt one time, these buried men had power over their animals and over the woods. Although they were only country laborers, the poet takes pains to make sure these achievements are not belittled:\n\nLet not Ambition mock their useful toil,\n\nTheir homely joys, and destiny obscure,\n\nNor Grandeur hear with a disdainful smile,\n\nThe short and simple annals of the poor.\n\nThis addressing of powers like “Ambition” and “Grandeur” seems a bit reminiscent of the Platonic forms of the Good, the Beautiful, and the like. Plato tried to nail down a definition of the Good, and here the poet seems to question what Ambition and Grandeur are, anyway. After all, one thing is clear in a graveyard—it is the final resting-place for all social classes.\n\nPower, beauty, and wealth, according to the poet, all “awaits alike th’inevitable hour.” At the end, the wildly successful match the poor in one respect: “The paths of glory lead but to the grave.”\n\nIn this country churchyard, the poet speculates about the talents of those buried here:\n\nPerhaps in this neglected spot is laid\n\nSome heart once pregnant with celestial fire,\n\nHands, that the rod of empire might have sway’d\n\nOr wak’d to the ecstasy the living lyre.\n\nSome of those buried here may have been outstanding ministers, rulers, or musicians. But destiny is often controlled by money, or what the poet calls “Chill Penury.” This churchyard might have contained a Milton or a Cromwell, if only economics didn’t play a part.\n\nBut despite the poverty and relative obscurity of those buried here, they still require the dignity of a proper place to rest:\n\nYet ev’n these bones from insult to protect\n\nSome frail memorial still erected nigh,\n\nWith uncouth rhimes and shapeless sculpture\n\ndeck’d,\n\nImplores the passing tribute of a sigh.\n\nThe churchyard, according to the poet, protects the dead from insult. But it also performs an essential function—it “teaches” the living how to die.\n\nThe poem ends with a description of the death of one individual man, who wasn’t seen on his usual hill, heath, and tree. He was also not “beside the rill” or “up the lawn.” He had died, and was being carried to the churchyard.\n\nThe dead man is carried slowly through the church-way path, the motion mimicking the slow-motion opening of the poem. Although those in attendance can’t read, an epitaph has been prepared for the dead man.\n\nThe epitaph acknowledges that this dead man was not lucky in Fame or Fortune. But in death, he is equal to all others, ready to relocate to “the bosom of his Father and his God.”\n\nSource: Aviya Kushner, in an essay for Poetry for Students, Gale, 2000.\n\nR. J. Ellis\n\nIn this essay, Ellis investigates the central mystery in one of the best-known poems in the English language.\n\nGray’s ‘Elegy’ is one of the better known poems in the English language. It is also one of those poems about which there is centred an enduring controversy. This can be referred to in shorthand as the ‘stonecutter debate’ and centres on a moment in the poem when, after an apparently serene enough progress into the pastoral mode, with an elegiac ‘graveyard poets’ edge to it, the poem suddenly introduces a startling complication. The ‘Elegy’ up until this moment seems to have a clear enough, and clearly centred, narrative voice, established emphatically in its very first stanza:\n\nThe Curfew tolls the knell of parting day,\n\nThe lowing herd wind slowly o’er the lea,\n\nThe plowman homeward plods his weary way,\n\nAnd leaves the world to darkness and to me.\n\nThe first stanza thus ends on the word ‘me’— announcing thereby a tone of personal, musing reflection. The ‘me’ is in fact quite heavily emphasised: the final word of the stanza, it is also underscored by the rhyme scheme. The poem thus seems to settle into a tone of first-person intimacy between the ‘Poet,’ that is to say the persona of the poem, and the audience. However, this apparent stability is ineradicably complicated by a sudden change of centre in lines 93–98:\n\n“On the other hand ‘thee’ is also a conventional multi-faceted portrait— stranding together West, Gray, the sensitive reader, the stonecutter/woodcarver, each one in slightly different ways safely locatable in all those pastoral traditions these identities reference, within which ‘The Ignote’ might be safely constrained….”\n\nFor thee, who mindful of th’ unhonour’d Dead\n\nDost in these lines their artless tale relate;\n\nIf chance, by lonely contemplation led,\n\nSome kindred Spirit shall inquire thy fate,\n\nHaply some hoary-headed Swain may say,\n\n‘Oft have we seen him at the peep of dawn …’\n\nThese lines, in rapid succession, introduce a new cast of characters: a ‘thee’, a ‘kindred spirit’ and a ‘hoary-headed Swain.’ The last two exist in some imagined future, imagined apparently by the poem’s ‘me’ as ‘haply’ meeting to discuss the ‘fate’ of ‘thee.’ And it is precisely this ‘thee’ which poses the problem: who exactly is ‘thee’? This question is important because the voice of the ‘Hoary headed swain, ’ speaking in this imagined future to the ‘kindred spirit, ’ dominates the remainder of the poem, and speaks wholly of this ‘thee, ’ who he regularly saw ‘Mutt’ring … wayward fancies’ until he died. Indeed, crucially, ‘The EPITAPH’ at the end is apparently engraved on the headstone of the now deceased ‘thee’ in the imagined future created within the poem. The poem thus ends not by focusing on the reflections of the poem’s narrator, ‘me, ’ but on ‘thee, ’ whoever this person is, on the fate of ‘thee, ’ and on ‘thee’s’ epitaph.\n\nThe question ‘who is “thee”?’ has been variously answered, and it is not my purpose fully to rehearse the resulting debate here. This has already often been done, for example in Herbert W. Starr’s Twentieth Century Interpretations of Gray’s ‘Elegy’ 63. The dominant explanation is that ‘thee’ is in fact ‘me, ’ either seen to be Gray, or the poem’s persona (depending on how you view the relationship of ‘me’ to the poet in this poem). Briefly, this proposal depends on us understanding that Gray/the poem’s persona has reached a point where his reflections are mature enough for him to distance himself from his own death, which he now imagines peacefully, having come to terms with his own mortality—even to the extent of imagining his own epitaph. A problem with this reading is the disconcerting smugness which now accrues to ‘The EPITAPH’:\n\nLarge was his bounty, and his soul sincere…\n\nAlternative proposals are fairly thick on the ground, however. Another popular suggestion is that the ‘thee’ is Gray’s close friend Richard West, who had died not long before. The composition date of the ‘Elegy’ is not quite clear: one, largely discarded, suggestion is that it was commenced as early as 1742, which means it may have been begun just after West’s death. Indeed the epitaph, for some critics, was one that Gray originally intended for West, an aspiring poet and Eton College schoolmate, whose career was abbreviated by his premature death. The ‘Elegy, ’ however, hardly supports this suggestion (not least because West’s background was not ‘humble, ’ as line 119 seems to indicate), and anyway its composition date is now usually accepted to be rather later.\n\nA third suggestion is that this ‘thee’ represents an imagined poet, or even an imagined personification, ‘The Poet.’ Most usually this ‘poet’ is seen as a poeta ignotus—an unknown poet of humble origins fated never to reach a wide audience—composing his poems, his ‘wayward fancies, ’ in rural obscurity before dying, unrecognised and largely unread. But this idea, like the others, has to be imposed on the poem, since it is not overtly the case that this, or any of the other readings so far examined, is correct, though each can lay claim to some degree of plausibility. These readings each, in turn, offer the promise of coherence, but it is only a promise, for the text offers no implicit or explicit support for any of them.\n\nThis lack of plain support fuels the next, undeniably dramatic, development. This seeks to define an actual figure in the poem, to whom the pronoun ‘thee’ refers—the figure of the ‘stonecutter.’ This argument is difficult to summarise. Briefly, it depends on noting that an unknown poet—a poeta ignotus—of sorts has earlier been (at the very least implicitly) introduced into the poem, namely in lines 79–81, which speak of ‘uncouth rimes’ decking the ‘frail memorials’ in the churchyard, with ‘names and years’ ‘spelt by th’ unletter’d muse.’ This poeta ignotus is usually labelled the ‘stonecutter poet, ’ who, according to this reading, is reverted to in line 93, becoming ‘thee … mindful of th’ unhonour’d dead’—‘mindful’ in that he composes verses for the gravemarkers of these dead. But, again, there are problems with this reading: is this ‘stonecutter’ explicitly mentioned, by being described as the ‘unletter’d muse, ’ or is the ‘muse’ here to be better understood as the personification of an abstract muse (as ‘the muse of poetry’ or, in my opinion more pertinently, as the ‘muse of literacy’), rather than any individual. And, anyway, even if we accept that ‘muse’ refers to a person, we are only sure this ‘muse’ writes ‘names [and] … years, ’ the bare data that all gravestones carry. Whether he also writes the ‘uncouth rhimes’ is less certain. Furthermore, the grammatical connection between lines 79–81 and lines 93 ff. is at best remote. Farcically enough, even this attempt to render the ‘Elegy’ back into good order has led on to a subcontroversy; this occasioned by noting that the ‘memorials’ are ‘frail’ and thus more likely to be made of ‘wood, ’ the usual material used for the gravestones of the poor: the ‘stonecutter’ must now become a ‘wood carver’.\n\nWhat we have ended up with is a plethora of proposed spokespersons, who all in their own way can be sensibly proposed as signifieds for the pronominal signifier, ‘thee.’\n\n(a) Gray himself (thee = me) (real)\n\n(b) the persona of the poem (thee = me) (imagined)\n\n(c) someone else (e.g., West) (real)\n\n(d) a fictional (imaginary) poet (‘poeta ignotus’) (imagined)\n\n(e) a personification: The Poet (imagined)\n\n(f) an actual unknown poet (the stone cutter/wood carver) (real)\n\nNow, I of course cannot resist adding one further plausible signified. It seems to me a further plausible reading could be that ‘thee’ denominates\n\n(g) the reader of the poem (thee = thee, the reader) (real)\n\n—an idea depending on a scenario where the reader is reciting the ‘Elegy, ’ to him or herself or actually aloud, and in this sense relating the tale told in the ‘Elegy, ’ the tale of ‘th’ unhonour’d dead, ’ of which the reader is, sui generis, being ‘mindful’ whilst reading the poem. Here the sense of ‘relate’ being deployed is related to the (now obsolete) one, ’4b: to adduce, cite (an authority (OED). This might seem to render up Gray’s idea of his readership in an interesting way: a readership which is sensitive, but not especially exalted. A problem here could be the objection that, since Walpole was one of Gray’s readers, these cannot really be seen as generically ‘humble’ in origins— but this problem can be dismissed to some extent by refusing to accept that ‘me’ and Gray can be equated and instead preferring to regard ‘me’ in the poem as a persona.\n\nHowever, it is not my purpose to press this particular case. My point in proposing a seventh possible identity for ‘thee, ’ which seems, perhaps, to stand up just as well as any other suggestion, is to dramatise the sudden decentering of the poem’s narrational harmony. The centre of the poem is suddenly called in doubt by this question: ‘who is “thee”?’ and its refusal to be resolved. It will be my contention that this irresolution is thematically integral. To explain why I believe this will take me down two lines of analysis, which I will then need to relate together before returning to the question of ‘thee’ and his identity. Both these lines of analysis demand some reference out to history and part of my point is that the ‘Elegy’ has still to be fully located within its history. The critics Richard C. Sha and John Lucas have provided recent impetus to this process, which, perhaps, finds its most significant start in William Empson’s Some Versions of the Pastoral. My analysis owes debts to all of these critics: hopefully what I am about to offer will represent a useful extension to their arguments.\n\nThe two lines of historical contextualisation I wish to address are, respectively, the chronological position of the ‘Elegy’ in the process of rural change generated by the development of enclosure and engrossment occurring during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, and the chronological position of the ‘Elegy’ in the process of transition from a society which was predominantly illiterate to one which was predominantly literate. These lines of contextualisation are worth careful examination because, I will contend, in the period during which Gray was working on the ‘Elegy’—most generally reckoned to be 1746–1750—these two important historical processes had reached points of pivotal significance, which actively impinge upon the poem’s thematic structure: their impact on the poem, I contend, is discursively constitutive. What follows are some outlines as to where considering these contextual aspects would lead, rather than a completed project, but I believe these outlines are broadly reliable and point out some interesting directions.\n\nIn the middle decade of the eighteenth century, 1746 to 1755, precisely when for much of the time Gray was at work on the ‘Elegy, ’ the process of enclosure had reached a transition point. It has become increasingly recognised that the enclosure movement had a very long foreground: it had been occurring in a piecemeal, unlegislated and unsystematic way, for many decades in the seventeenth century; the early eighteenth century saw a general, but not consistently maintained, acceleration in this process. The 1750s saw the beginnings of a new dimension to this process, as landowners increasingly turned to private parliamentary bills to facilitate the process of enclosure. This change-over, to the use of private bills, only became fully functional as the 1760s commenced: thereafter the process was very rapid. In the period 1750 to 1810 Paul Langford estimates that nearly four thousand enclosure acts were passed, whilst C.P. Hill states that the period 1760 to 1793 saw 1, 335 bills passed. What occurred was the ending of the open-field system and the large-scale absorption of common land into private ownership, as the enclosure movement entered its final, parliamentary phase. In this sense, the ‘Elegy’ appeared in print at this pivotal point: just as parliament began to become the main conduit for the processes of enclosure. Just as significantly, though, Buckinghamshire and Cambridgeshire were situated geographically in that part of the country still largely unenclosed, and thus poised for large-scale take-over by this new mode of parliamentary-authorised enclosure, which re-invigorated the whole trend. The process of enclosure and engrossment in East Anglia had been largely completed by the end of the seventeenth century, Cambridgeshire and north Buckinghamshire were brought fully under the processes of enclosure during ‘the first generation of parliamentary enclosures, ’ which would be, precisely, 1750–1770. Thus Gray’s country churchyard, whether one chooses to locate it conventionally in Stoke Poges, or, more freely, somewhere in the area between Stoke Poges and Cambridge is, from the point of view of the historical geographer, at the centre of the changing and accelerating enclosure and engrossment process, moving out of a piecemeal and unlegislated phase into one dominated by Parliamentary acts. These developments were the subject of extensive contemporary debate. Thematically, I contend, all this impresses itself on the poem, once one gives proper emphasis to the primary human impact of this rural change.\n\nHistorians now seem to be moving towards some sort of consensus concerning the human impact of engrossment and enclosure in one arena of their debate about this process. There is still the predictable disagreement about to what extent the rural population as a whole suffered from these changes: some economic historians insistently point to what they discern as rises in both productivity and levels of employment. However, there is widespread agreement that ‘many individuals’ losses may have been serious. Equally, it would seem to be generally agreed that there developed a clear ‘tendency to replace farm servants with wage-paid labour hired for the purpose’ because ‘The new farms wanted wage labourers.’ Quite simply, the loss of common land forced the rural population to turn to day labour, and day labour ‘offered no equivalent security … [to] freehold, copyhold or … long lease.’ This represented, then, a significant alteration in social relations. It has been called ‘a crisis of paternalism, ’ and seems to have been the subject of substantial contemporary debate. Radical historians, such as Christopher Hill, reference contemporary mid-century documents exposing a discourse nakedly representing this shift towards day-labour as an ideological contrivance. Hill quotes ‘official Board of Agriculture reports’ which praise the enclosure of the commons ‘because it forced labourers to “work every day in the year” … depriving the lower orders of any chance of economic independence … [so that] “the subordination of the lower ranks of society … would be thereby considerably secured.”’ Similarly Hill references ‘a pamphlet of 1739’ which asserted that ‘The only way to make the lower orders temperate and industrious … was to lay them under the necessity of labouring all the time they can spare from rest and sleep in order to procure the necessities of life.’\n\nI wish to propose that this ‘crisis of [rural] paternalism, ’ gaining momentum in the middle decades of the eighteenth century, can be laid alongside a crisis in the poetic discourse of pastoralism. We are, after all, only two decades away from the publication of Oliver Goldsmith’s The Deserted Village (1770). George Crabbe’s The Village lies only just over one decade further off (1783). Goldsmith’s and Crabbe’s poems speak of the full impact of enclosure and engrossment in their different ways, and represent the tight squeeze within which the pastoral was constrained. Gray comes significantly earlier in this process, and his ‘Elegy’ feels around the edges of this gathering process. What else are we to make of the strangely unstable oscillation in the pattern of this poem’s representation of country life?:\n\nThe Curfew tolls the knell of parting day,\n\nThe lowing herd wind slowly o’er the lea\n\nThe plowman homeward plods his weary way,\n\nAnd leaves the world to darkness and to me.\n\nRepresenting ‘lowing herd[s] wind[ing] slowly o’er the lea’ is idyllic enough—falling well within conservative expectations of the genre, but ‘The plowman … plodd[ing] … wear[il]y’ is far less reassuring, and much more in line with the sentiments of Hill’s 1739 pamphleteer. In fact this disconcerting switching of mood is recurrent. I offer a partial list:\n\n1.3: plods his weary\n\n1.5: glimmering landscape\n\n1.6: stillness\n\n1.8: drowsy tinklings lull\n\n1.14: mould’ring heap\n\n1.15: narrow cell\n\n1.16: rude Forefathers\n\n1.16: hamlet sleep\n\n1.17: incense-breathing Morn\n\n1.20: lowly\n\n1.21: blazing hearth\n\n1.25: harvest\n\n1.27: jocund\n\n1.30: homely joys\n\n1.30: destiny obscure\n\n1.32: simple annals 1.32: short … poor\n\n1.45: neglected spot\n\n1.51: chill Penury\n\n1.52: genial currents 1.52: froze\n\n1.56: waste\n\n1.65: forbad\n\n1.74: sober\n\n1.75: cool\n\n1.76: noiseless tenor\n\n1.79: uncouth … shapeless\n\n1.81: unlettered\n\nIt should be observed that antithesis is one central rhetorical trope of this poem, and this has led to the suggestion that what Gray is aiming for here is a ‘balance’ which, correctly understood, is a guarantee of the poem’s apoliticism. I find myself unable to go along with this representation of the poem. After all, the ‘Elegy’ purports, despite its eventual, disconcerting narrative decentering, to describe a real village graveyard around which real activity occurs: the ‘plowman … plods’ in the present tense to lend, exactly, a sense of immediacy. The disconcerting shuttle between negative and positive representations of this rural experience has thus, unsurprisingly, led this poem to be seen ‘both as rightist and leftist propaganda.’ Certainly, there is, virtually, an alternation: rural life being represented as fulfilling, then debilitating, rewarding, then chilling—which perhaps functions as a discursive analogue of the confusing social crisis borne within the processes of enclosure. In this respect it is crucial to note that the narrative is led in by a ‘plowman, ’ and a ‘weary’ plowman at that: a representative, precisely, of the growing numbers of agricultural labourers coming to dominate the rural scene. In fact, the labours described are all potentially those of farm workers:\n\nOft did the harvest to their sickle yield.\n\nTheir furrow oft the stubborn glebe has broke;\n\nHow jocund did they drive their team afield!\n\nHow bow’d the woods beneath their sturdy stroke!\n\nIt is consistent with my argument here to note that two of these activities (the clearing of woods and the ploughing up of ‘the stubborn glebe, ’ which the OED links to common land by quoting a source of 1598: ‘Houses … he raseth, to make the common gleabe his private land’ [T. Bastard, Chrestoleros]) could both quite well refer to the enclosure of common land: this is, perhaps, how Clare understood these lines, as witness this echo in his ‘Helpstone’ (even allowing for the deployment of stock pastoral imagery the parallelism is worth comment), in which Clare is plainly describing the process of enclosure: ‘Accursed wealth …/Thou art the cause that levels every tree/And woods bow down to clear a way for thee.’\n\nIt is equally consistent to observe, however, that in the equivalent stanza of the ‘Elegy, ’ though the second of these four activities strongly suggests hard labour, this is plainly set, once again disconcertingly, beside a more idyllic portrait of easy pastoral fulfilment, of ‘yield[ing]’ and ‘bow[ing], ’ without Clare’s sense of irony (his ‘woods’ bow to ‘wealth’). Nevertheless, the impression recurrently is of labour and labourers rather than farming and farmers. This sense of a rural working class is perhaps reinforced by constant reminders in Gray’s poem of their illiteracy. And this observation ushers in my second theme.\n\nIn exploring the relation of the ‘Elegy’ to actual processes in historical geography, what I am arguing is that the conventional pastoral discourse, as a mode of representing the rural English experience, is losing in this poem any monolithic integrity, and being riven by real contradictory inputs—the observable rural changes here suffuse the ‘Elegy’s’ dramatic representations. In Foucauldian terms, the discourse is falling available, potentially, to seizure—or recuperation. Something similar, I believe, underlies the poem’s apparent uncertainties about literacy. At one point late in the poem, in line 115, ‘thee’ (here it definitely refers to ‘some kindred Spirit’ who by ‘chance’ may ‘enquire thy fate’) is invited by the ‘hoary-headed Swain’ to ‘approach and read (for thou can’st read).’ The clear implication is that the elderly rural inhabitant cannot read (else the clause is almost wholly redundant). This near-certainty about reading abilities (‘hoary headed Swain’ = non-reader, ‘kindred Spirit’ = reader) comes almost as a relief after a cluster of doubtful suggestions about levels of literacy. Previously, you will recall, we have had the disconcerting image of an ‘unletter’d Muse’ spelling ‘names [and] … years.’ The only way to grasp this image, before it disintegrates into unresolvable contradictions (how can someone who is ‘unletter’d’ spell?) is to understand that here the ‘letters’ in question must refer to the Classical education that would not have been available to any rural memorialist: the latter is ‘unletter’d’ in this sense: without the Classics. But, even as the issue of literacy recedes by understanding ‘unletter’d’ in this way, and thus apparently resolving the contradiction, it is replaced by the issue of education. The problematic status of this issue is well-captured by the near-oxymoronic juxtaposition of ‘unletter’d’ with ‘Muse, ’ which must thereby be divested of its Classical associations and left simply as ‘inspiration’ (the ‘Muse of inspiration’, and not a Classical Muse), in a process of transference only just coming into the language (the OED’s first recorded example, 1d, dates from 1721). The terrain here is riddled with ironies, which Gray promptly compounds by offering us what can reasonably be described as a meta-textual irony, since we are reminded that we are reading an elegy at the very moment that we are being reminded that others cannot, else they would not need to rely on an ‘unletter’d muse’:\n\nTheir names, their years, spelt by th’ unletter’d\n\nmuse,\n\nThe place of fame and elegy supply.\n\nIt will be my contention that, here again, these issues, and their problematic representation in the text, derive from the particular historical context investing Gray’s ‘Elegy.’\n\nIt is increasingly often argued by historians that the middle decades of the eighteenth century mark a transition point in the cultural valuation and significance of literacy:\n\nIn the mid-eighteenth century about a third of men and two thirds of women were unable to sign their name, though the local incidence of illiteracy varied widely. But the acquisition of basic reading skills by those on the margin of middle- and lower-class life, for whom they were coming to be an essential working asset, was a notable feature of urban society.\n\nThe sting lies in the tail of this analysis: that literacy was becoming of increasing cultural importance was particularly true for those living in towns and cities—but the dislocations occasioned by the processes of enclosure and engrossing had displaced segments of the rural population. Some of these were inevitably drawn into these urban areas (in a process of increasingly fluid interchange between country and city), as the position of the rural worker, now an agricultural labourer, was rendered far more precarious. Education, particularly education to provide literacy, was becoming increasingly necessary. This, too has been quite widely agreed on by historians: one basic sign of this was patterns of reading:\n\nThere were many pointers to wide and growing readership in the mid-eighteenth century, including the production of both metropolitan and provincial newspapers, and the multiplication of new tract and book titles generally.\n\nBut these positive signs are counterbalanced by the way in which there was no decisive increase in the numbers signing parish marriage registers in the period 1754 to 1800. Indeed it is a significant sign of the growing importance of literacy that it was the year 1753 that had witnessed the introduction of Lord Hardwicke’s act requiring the signing of parochial wedding registers (thus enabling us to know the percentage signing marriage registers). Literacy was plainly becoming increasingly important for the individual in his or her negotiations with society. Literacy, I am suggesting, and beside it, education, were two key issues of the middle decades of the eighteenth century, issues of decisive socio-cultural significance. Reading and writing were key terrains of cultural hegemony. To obtain these prizes was of real social significance throughout the eighteenth century:\n\nIn the 1720s Mandeville had … [contended] that to secure the contentment of the poor with their lot, it is requisite that great numbers of them should be ignorant as well as poor.\n\nJohn Clare, born in 1793, in his autobiographical writings, notes:\n\nAs my parents had the good fate to have but a small family, I being the eldest of 4, two of whom dyed in their Infancy, my mothers hopfull ambition ran high of being able to make me a good scholar as she said she expirenced enough in her own case to avoid bringing up her children in ignorance, but god help her, her hopful and tender kindness was often crossd with difficultys … I believe I was not older than 10 when my father took me to seek the scanty rewards of industry … as to my schooling, I think never a year passd me till I was 11 or 12 but 3 months or more at the worst of times was luckily spared for my improvement …\n\nEven allowing for the conventionality of Clare’s sentiments, this determination maps onto the lack of opportunity to obtain schooling, on the one hand, and the increasingly high valuation being placed upon literacy in the market place as well as in polite society on the other. Indeed it is possible to contend that education became increasingly hierarchized, thus Gillian Sutherland claims that ‘In the course of the eighteenth century, “plebeians,” those whose fathers were not gentlemen, disappeared altogether’ from Oxford and Cambridge.\n\nThese considerations bear sharply upon the constantly problematic introduction of the theme of reading and writing into Gray’s ‘Elegy’:\n\nLet not Ambition mock their useful toil,\n\nTheir homely joys, and destiny obscure;\n\nNor Grandeur hear with a disdainful smile,\n\nThe short and simple annals of the poor.\n\nAnnals are ‘1. A narrative of events written year by year, or 2. Historical records generally’ (OED)—but in both cases, written records that the poor cannot keep. This is an issue of social status, as Gray’s later reference, in stanza eleven, to a ‘storied urn’ in turn implies: the urn, is of course here a classical one, with a frieze on it narrating a story visually, for the viewer to ‘read’—but this ‘reading’ is itself fundamentally dependent on knowledge of the classics, which ‘th’ unletter’d Muse’ surely does not possess—and so we return to the oxymoron which served as the foundation of my argument. The fact is that these agricultural labourers possessed ‘rude Forefathers’—uneducated forefathers, and their gravemarkers will bear ‘uncouth rhimes.’ But (and here the pendulum swings again) these gravemarkers also carry ‘holy text, ’ and it was precisely the Church, and particularly the Nonconformist Church, with its insistence on reading the Bible, which operated as the main stimulus towards and conduit for what education was obtainable, and then only to a very limited number. Thus Clare, in his ‘Shepherd’s Calendar, ’ will write, in 1827, of the shepherd boy still struggling with his letters:\n\nHe hears the wild geese gabble oer his head\n\nAnd pleasd wi fancys in his musings bred\n\nHe marks the figured forms in which they flye\n\nAnd pausing follows wi a wondering eye\n\nLikening their curious march in curves or rows\n\nTo every letter which his memory knows\n\nIssues of literacy and education are here, as with Gray, interlinked with the issuings of the creative imagination, but far more explicitly, and from quite another perspective.\n\nGray’s background may not be irrelevant here: he was the son of a scrivener and exchange broker (albeit one able to send his son to Eton), and in this sense slightly on the edge of the social circles in which he moved. Walpole confessed that ‘insensible to the feelings of one I thought below me … I treated [Gray] insolently.’ For Gray, therefore, issues of social rank, social order and the advantages of being lettered must have had a particular piquancy. It is tempting then, to identify him in the poem not with the suddenly introduced ‘thee’ in the poem, nor even with the ‘me’ that opens up the poem’s reflections, but with the ‘mopeing owl’ in stanza three, located in ‘yonder ivy-mantled tow’r, ’ high above the country churchyard, safe from the questions of literacy and class which in the graveyard down below press upon the consciousness.\n\nAll this comes to a climax in ‘The EPITAPH’ at the end of the poem, which contains one of the most difficult lines in the poem—‘Fair Science frowned not on his humble birth’—difficult, because whilst it plainly serves as a key pointer to the identity of the individual being remembered in this epitaph, the ‘thee’ introduced in stanza twenty-four, this line also, ironically, enormously limits the range of identities assignable to this individual. This constraint results from conjoining the ‘birth’ of ‘thee’ with the words ‘humble’ and ‘science.’ Such a conjunction renders problematic the identity of ‘thee, ’ since ‘science’—in the sense of knowledge acquired by learning—rarely conjoined with humbleness at people’s births in mid-eighteenth century England. And this observation precisely maps out for us the links between the ‘Elegy’s’ uneasy treatment of rural labouring experience, its recurrent concern with levels of literacy and the problem of arriving at a satisfactory identification of ‘thee.’ Each possible identity for ‘thee’ stumbles up against the problem of who could plausibly conjoin ‘humbleness’ and ‘science’ in their origins. Hence, I believe, the resort to identifying ‘thee’ as a poeta ignotus—an unknown poet: it is, quite simply, a way out of this dilemma. This is in fact a pressing issue for Gray: he was much attracted by the idea that true Englishness resided in those marginalised by the Norman invasion and subsequent repressions: hence his interest in the fragments of ‘Ossian, ’ his poems such as ‘The Bard’ (1757) and translations such as ‘The Triumphs of Owen’ (1768). However, these beliefs and interests directed him away from the ‘letter’d Muse’ into a cultural terrain manifestly neglected and marginalised, full, indeed of unknown poets— such as Stephen Duck, ‘a common thresher, ’ whose Poems on Several Subjects had appeared in 1730. It was indeed this period, the middle decades of the eighteenth century, that saw the irruption of vernacular poets into polite society—writers contesting, at least in part, how to understand the presence of ‘fair science’ at their births: the sense of ‘science’ would now need to shift to ‘knowledge (more or less extensive) as a personal attribute’ (OED).\n\nThis may be conjoined, I believe, to the crisis of pastoralism that I am proposing, twinned as it is with the crisis of paternalism: what is developing is a loss of confidence in the pastoral’s discursive representation of a whole nation, and a recognition of cultural and social fragmentation and social division. This manifests itself in a recognition of what I shall describe as an ‘Other, ’ a manifestation of cultural otherness—in this poem, ‘thee’—to be desired (as Edenic), feared (as penury), and, indeed, killed off, after being described in terms of melancholic exclusion. In this sense, Gray opens the way towards the Romantics, as many critics have observed, but, I would claim, his accompanying recognition of cultural division, along lines of class and education, points out the way for the concerted development of other written cultural traditions, separate from that laid out by ‘th’ …letter’d Muse.’ And this is one main element of the link between Gray and Clare. Clare’s lines:\n\nNo, not a friend on earth had I\n\nBut my own kin and poesy\n\nlinks clearly, in my mind, to the ‘thee’ as Other depicted by ‘the hoary-headed Swain’:\n\n‘His listless length at noontide wou’d he stretch\n\n‘And pore upon the brook that babbles by.\n\n‘Hard by yon wood, now smiling as in scorn,\n\n‘Mutt’ring his wayward fancies he wou’d rove,\n\n‘Now drooping, woeful wan, like one forlorn,\n\n‘Or craz’d with care, or cross’d in hopeless love.\n\nOne needs to be careful here: one needs to recognise the conventionalities investing these images, and I am not proposing that Gray’s ‘thee’ is in some way equitable with Clare. There is a clear enough separation here, which may be related to John Lucas’s depiction of Gray as ‘muddled’ in his handling of the politics involved in depicting ‘Englishness.’ What I certainly want to note here is that the portrait of ‘thee’ cannot be read off simply as ‘a poet entirely unkown to fame, an Ignotus, ’ as suggested by Odell Shepard, but rather as a complex doppelganger: tradition and its fracturing is contained within him.\n\nOn the one hand ‘thee’ is not a poeta ignotus so much as quite literally ‘The Ignote’, the unknown—the Other, yet to be delivered by the cultural fragmentation sweeping across an enclosing, engrossing, urbanising and industrialising land, where literacy and class would become primary. On the other hand ‘thee’ is also a conventional multi-faceted portrait—stranding together West, Gray, the sensitive reader, the stonecutter/wood-carver, each one in slightly different ways safely locatable in all those pastoral traditions these identities reference, within which ‘The Ignote’ might be safely constrained: as the simple rural friend, as the poet (re-)discovering himself in bucolic reverie, as the urban(e) audience longing for rural retreat— as the pastoral rural bard is progressively superseded by the more complex and problematic figure of the peasant poet. Just as Clare came to regret his constraint within one of these categories, the ‘peasant poet’—a category misrepresenting Clare, so ‘The Ignote’ in the ‘Elegy’ cannot adequately be contained within any of these categories, but plays disturbingly across them all, unsettling the pastoral’s attempt to invest the countryside with order. Thus the answer to the question ‘who can Gray have had in mind when he introduced ‘thee’ into his poem?’ is quite literally that ‘no answer fits anymore.’ After all, we end up in a projected future set in tension with a counterpoint of intertextual allusions, borrowings and debts from the pastoral’s past—Raymond Williams’ backward moving escalator which seems to offer us the promise of establishing some identity, but always fails. However the ‘Elegy’ also disconcertingly moves from unsettled backward-looking pastoral generalisation towards the anxious future of an imagined, particular ‘thee.’ But this is only ever a seeming particularity, upon which each attempt to place an existing identity fails, and further reveals ‘The(e) Ignote’ as a void still to be filled. External to the poem, one good answer to the question ‘who is “thee”?’ thus is John Clare (whose close friend and fellow autodidact John Turnill wrote at least one epitaph, and who seriously considered a career as a monumental mason), but he is not yet born. In the poem’s own terms, there perhaps is and can be no answer, so instead of seeking one, I think it is better to rephrase the question: the ‘Elegy, ’ in generating the problem of who ‘thee’ is, is also raising the question, what on earth is descending upon the inhabitant of the changing English country-side—what identity has s/he got?—a question, I would argue, of very real penetration, and one bound up with shifting social relations and their definition in language, discourse and education—the very themes I see as central to the poem.\n\nSource: R.
