-19TH AMENDMENT TO THE U.S. CONSTITUTION

The fight for women’s suffrage began quietly in the 1840s and expanded after the Civil War, with the formation of several national organizations.

In the early 20th century, a new generation of activists focused on lobbying Congress and President Woodrow Wilson for a national suffrage amendment. Attention-grabbing protests, parades, and civil disobedience thrust the suffrage debate into the mainstream.

In 1919, the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives passed a suffrage amendment. After ratification by 36 of the nation’s 48 states, the 19th Amendment became law on August 26, 1920, when the Tennessee legislature ratified the measure by just one vote.

Why did some women oppose suffrage?

Not all women supported women's suffrage. According to the ca. 1910 pamphlet below from the National Association Opposed to Woman Suffrage there were a number of anti-suffrage arguments. Their reasons included: women did not want to vote, women would vote the same as their husbands, and in some states where women outnumbered men the government would be under "petticoat rule".
