        "text": "There are two ways to search the document: FACTS AND SECTIONS. To search information, enter a keyword in a search box and select the magnifying glass icon to return matching results. Search operators \"and\" (via \"AND\" or \"&\") and \"or\" (via \"OR\" or \"|\") are available to further refine a search.\n\nFACTS\n\nThe Search Facts box can be used to find tagged facts matching entered keywords. By default, tag name, tag labels, and tagged content are included in Search. Tagged facts matching the search criteria are shown with a yellow-colored (default) shading on the page and appear in the Facts List. Select the \"X\" button to the left of the magnifying glass icon to clear the search.\n\nThe content included in Search can be increased to included tag definitions, dimensions, and authoritative references by selecting the cog / wheel icon to the left of the search box. See Settings for more information.\n\nSECTIONS\n\nThe Search Sections box can be used to filter the tagged sections of the financial statements.\n\nFilters change the number of highlighted facts and items in the fact list by providing several ways to review and pinpoint certain tagged information. Multiple filters can be used at once.\n\nDATA FILTERS\n\nThese filter options allow the user to refine the highlighted tagged facts by data type:\n\nAll - Displays all tagged data (default)\n\nAmounts Only - Numeric facts only\n\nText Only - Textual facts only\n\nCalculations Only - Numeric facts participating in a calculation only\n\nNegatives Only - Negative Numeric amounts only\n\nAdditional Items Only - Tagged facts without a corresponding HTML presentation (i.e., hidden facts) only\n\nTAGS FILTER\n\nThese filters allow the user to refine the highlighted facts by tag type:\n\nAll - Displays all tagged data (default)\n\nStandard Only- Facts with standard tags from a common taxonomy (e.g., US_GAAP, IFRS, DEI).\n\nCustom Only - Facts with extension \"custom\" tags unique to the entity's document.\n\nMORE FILTERS\n\nAdditional filters that allow user to further refine the highlighted facts:\n\nPeriods - List of all used context years and reporting periods\n\nMeasures - List of all used units of measure (e.g., US Dollars); as applicable\n\nAxis - List of all used axis (dimensions); as applicable (dimensions); as applicable\n\nScale - List of all used scaled options (e.g., thousands, millions); as applicable\n\nBalance - Debit, credit; as applicable\n\nMultiple filters work in conjunction with each other. For example, selecting the \"Amounts Only\" Data filter and \"Custom Only\" Tags filter will highlight only numeric tagged facts using custom tags and list them in the fact list. Active filters are displayed in the Filter toolbar as they are selected. Active filters can be removed individually by unchecking or selecting ALL option for each filter, or all at once via the \"Reset All Filters\" option.\n\nOn the toolbar, select the \"count\" to the right of the word Facts (e.g., Facts 234) to reveal the Facts List results - a navigable listing of all currently highlighted tagged facts. The count represents the current number of facts.\n\nBy default, all tagged facts are displayed in the Fact List Results. The list content and count reflects the currently highlighted facts (i.e., both Filters and Search criteria refine the list to match the highlighted tagged facts). Navigation controls are available to move through the list as well as move the current view to the corresponding highlighted fact location automatically. When a fact in the Facts Results List is selected, it will reveal the Fact Review Window.\n\nCertain letters may appear to the right of an item in the Fact Result list to indicate a certain property. If the letter \"A\" appears for a fact, it indicates the fact is additional data (i.e., hidden with potentially no corresponding HTML presentation). If the letter \"C\" appears, the fact is tagged with a custom tag. If the letter \"D\" appears, the fact is tagged with dimensional information."
