        "text": "I. Introduction\n\nReapportionment is the decennial process through which congressional representatives, and relatedly, Electoral College votes are allocated to the states. While the ins and outs of counting population via the census can be complex and less than accurate for a myriad of reasons, once the populations of each state have been tallied, the United States Code lays out a relatively simple reapportionment process. The President transmits to Congress a statement of the number of representatives entitled to each state using a formula dictated by federal statute. Congress, through the Clerk of the House of Representatives, then sends a certificate to each state providing notice of their number of representatives. End of story.\n\nThis simple process though, was not always so simple. Reapportionment was quite messy from the birth of the United States until the early twentieth century. During this time, Congress would start every decennial reapportionment from scratch, which led to many different reapportionment formulas being used and significant controversy. And then things got even worse. Reapportionment completely broke down following the 1920 Census when Congress utterly failed to reapportion. Finally, at the end of the Roaring Twenties, Congress cobbled together a compromise that spawned the simple process used today—a process that has mostly quieted reapportionment controversy for nearly a century.\n\nIn recent years, commentators in both the political science and law review literatures have taken aim at perceived flaws of the current, simple process. On the political science front, the target is the reapportionment formula. The current formula is alleged to be biased in favor of less populated states and, in the eyes of some, should be replaced with a formula that would be slightly less biased. In the law review literature, the calls have been for the courts to enforce a never-implemented portion of the Fourteenth Amendment known as the Reduction Clause, which can potentially be used to penalize states that deny or abridge voting rights by taking away congressional seats (which would lead to a concomitant reduction of Electoral College votes). One law review commentator proposed that a court order the Census Bureau to generate reapportionment data taking into account the denial or abridgment of voting rights pursuant to the Reduction Clause. Another legal scholar proposed that a court declare the reapportionment statute itself unconstitutional because the statute does not grant the Executive Branch the ability to generate data related to the Reduction Clause. Although these proposals differ slightly in their jurisprudential foundations, both proposals seek judicial interference in the reapportionment process premised upon application of the Reduction Clause.\n\nMany of these criticisms of the reapportionment process have been around the political science and law review literatures for years, but renewed academic interest in the Reduction Clause has occurred alongside renewed interest by litigants (and even documentary filmmakers!). A lawsuit seeking to throw out the most recent reapportionment on Reduction Clause grounds was recently considered by a three-judge federal panel, and an appeal of that decision could head directly to the U.S. Supreme Court. Put simply, the Reduction Clause’s role in reapportionment could be on a collision course with the highest Court in the land.\n\nThis Article contends that, despite any potential flaws identified by commentators and litigants, the reapportionment process should be left alone. Reapportionment was a messy political process for many decades and ultimately became so messy that Congress wasn’t even able to reapportion following the 1920 Census. The compromise emerging from that 1920s rubble has, in essence, put reapportionment on an uncontroversial autopilot—to the overall benefit of democracy in the United States. Reopening the process to debate a new formula or throwing a wrench into the existing process by judicial fiat would be a mistake because it has the strong potential to create another political football for poisonous partisan debate that is not needed in the current hyper-polarized landscape. Moreover, the Reduction Clause, which is the vehicle legal commentators and litigants want to use to spark judicial intervention, has never been implemented in its 150-plus years of history, including during some of the United States’ most despicable eras of disfranchisement. Beyond its lengthy dormancy, implementing the Reduction Clause would be extremely difficult and implementation might well be done in a partisan manner. In essence, messing with the reapportionment process could very well lead things back to the situation that existed in the 1920s. And, importantly, there would seem to be ample, credible doctrinal tools in the judicial arsenal—for example, the political questions doctrine or principles involving standing—to avoid going down this road.\n\nThis Article proceeds in three core parts. Part II provides the necessary backstory, briefly sketching the history of reapportionment and the history of the Reduction Clause while also providing a quick overview of the judiciary’s approach to the Clause and to reapportionment generally. Part III enters the realm of realpolitik. It describes the recent political science and legal proposals and sketches out what the consequences of those proposals might be, ultimately making the case that little, if anything, positive would likely emanate from changing the existing, stable reapportionment dynamic. Part IV returns to a more purely jurisprudential posture and sketches some plausible doctrinal positions to keep the judiciary from messing with reapportionment.\n\nII. Reapportionment Over Time\n\nThe U.S. Constitution mandates the reapportionment of Representatives “among the several States . . . according to their respective Numbers.” This is a seemingly simple principle. And it is a simple principle for the vast majority of seats distributed among the states. But the simple principle becomes tricky due to fractions. For instance, assume the United States has a population of 331 million, Indiana has a population of 6.7 million, and there are 435 seats to be divided up among the states. Indiana has 2.024% of the total population, and theoretically, should be entitled to 8.80 (2.024%) of the 435 seats. But seats are whole and cannot be fractionally assigned. So, should Indiana get eight or nine seats? The hypothetical demonstrates that the pressing issue when it comes to reapportionment is determining what should be done with fractional remainders.\n\nFrom the Founding until the early twentieth century, Congress bounced around between various formulas for dealing with fractional remainders. For the initial reapportionment that occurred at the Founding, dealing with fractional representation was solved using the “Jefferson method,” which is also known as the “method of greatest divisors.” In a nutshell, the Jefferson method ignored fractional remainders. This method was used for reapportionments until 1842. At that point, Congress adopted the “Webster method” of reapportionment. The Webster method considered fractions and provided an additional seat to those states that had a fractional representation above one-half. But the Webster method had a very short run, as for the next reapportionment, Congress abandoned it and adopted the “Hamilton method.” The Hamilton method distributes the fractional seats by giving the remaining seats to the states with the highest leftover fractions. The Hamilton method reigned for about half a century, until 1911, when the Webster method made a comeback.\n\nThis quick tour of various approaches to fractional representation over more than a century of American history might make your head spin, and it also might give the impression that Congress just bounced around between different formulas without much problem. But that impression would be far from the case. Reapportionment consistently generated significant controversy and angst between the Founding and the first part of the twentieth century. For instance, the initial reapportionment was vetoed by President George Washington (it was the first ever Presidential veto in history!).\n\nIn relation to the general messiness of the process, Professor Charles Eagles noted that the “first thirteen reapportionments up through 1911 involved considerable controversy.” And two other experts in reapportionment have similarly opined that “[t]he country that has had the most intense debates over [reapportionment] is the United States. The argument began at the Constitutional Convention in 1787, flared again when the results of the first census were reported in 1791, and was regularly discussed thereafter every ten years.” So, from the Founding until the early twentieth century, reapportionment occurred each decade, but it certainly wasn’t easy.\n\nThen all hell really broke loose. After the 1920 Census, Congress failed to reapportion. This fact merits repeating and being placed in italics because it is an extremely important moment in United States reapportionment history, and is absolutely crucial to bear in mind when considering whether to mess with reapportionment today: Congress did not adopt reapportionment legislation to reallocate seats based on the results of the 1920 Census. So reapportionment went from a difficult decennial event to a nonexistent one.\n\nThe reasons for the failure to reapportion after the 1920 Census were many and somewhat complex but, for current purposes, the following summary suffices:\n\nThe failure to reapportion the House based on the 1920 census resulted from many controversies that divided the Congress. Although the 1920 Census had occurred without any special controversy, its results soon sparked strenuous disagreements. The 1920 Census showed that the population had grown by nearly 14 million and that most people for the first time lived in urban areas, but some questioned the accuracy of a census taken so soon after the socially disruptive World War I. The population shifts revealed by the census meant that some changes in the apportionment of congressmen would be necessary; to prevent any state from losing a representative, sixty new congressmen would have to be added to the House. Physical limitations of the House chamber, however, made more congressional seats unlikely, and some representatives argued that the House’s efficiency would decline if it grew in numbers. Others pointed out that the larger number of voting constituents after women’s suffrage made smaller districts and more representatives necessary. An additional controversy involved whether representation should be based on a population that included [Black citizens] and aliens who could not vote. Finally, congressmen disagreed over the proper statistical procedure to use to allot seats in the House.\n\nOn the bright side, the debacle that was the failure to reapportion after the 1920 Census ultimately led to reapportionment détente. At the end of the Roaring Twenties, Congress reached a compromise, enacting the Reapportionment Act of 1929 that eliminated the decennial debate over reapportionment by creating a default process. The compromise, which was modified a bit in 1941, created the basic structure used today: the census is conducted and the President transmits to Congress a statement of the population of each state and the number of representatives to which each state is entitled using a formula known as the “method of equal proportions” and then the Clerk of the House of Representatives notifies each state of its representation. In essence, Congress put reapportionment on autopilot rather than having to subject reapportionment to manual adjustment through passage of legislation every decade.\n\nThe prior sketch of reapportionment history, though, omits a piece of the puzzle that entered the fray in the 1860s—Section Two of the Fourteenth Amendment. Section Two’s text reads as follows:\n\nRepresentatives shall be apportioned among the several States according to their re-spective [sic] numbers, counting the whole number of persons in each State, excluding Indians not taxed. But when the right to vote at any election for the choice of electors for President and Vice President of the United States, Representatives in Congress, the Executive and Judicial officers of a State, or the members of the Legislature thereof, is denied to any of the male inhabitants of such State, be-ing [sic] twenty-one years of age, and citizens of the United States, or in any way abridged, except for participation in rebellion, or other crime, the ba-sis [sic] of representation therein shall be reduced in the proportion which the number of such male citizens shall bear to the whole number of male citizens twenty-one years of age in such State.\n\nThe key verbiage here is what is known as the Reduction Clause, which allows for the representation of a state to be reduced if the right to vote is “denied” or “in any way abridged.” The Reduction Clause was designed to solve a problem related to the representation provided to the former Confederate states. When the abomination of slavery ended, the Three-Fifths Clause became inoperable (i.e., slaves would no longer count as three-fifths of a person when it came to reapportionment because they were now free). This meant that the former Confederate states would see an increase in their population for reapportionment purposes. However, those same former Confederate states might well deny voting rights to the newly freed slaves. The Reduction Clause, thus, was intended to incentivize the former Confederate states to fully enfranchise freed slaves so that those states could gain their full representation.\n\nBut the Reduction Clause turned out to be difficult to implement from the get-go. During the 1870 Census, the Executive Branch attempted to generate statistics regarding the number of persons whose voting rights were denied or abridged by asking census questions related to voting rights. Yet, even the Executive Branch gave little credence to the data generated by its own questions. Congress then tried to make its own judgment about the impact the Clause should have on reapportionment following the 1870 Census. However, Congress itself ultimately concluded the Reduction Clause should not be used in that reapportionment. In the end, as a part of the post-1870 Census reapportionment, Congress could only pass a meaningless codification of the Clause into federal law.\n\nThe Reduction Clause then basically flew under the radar for the next several reapportionments. Indeed, the Executive Branch decided to not even ask questions during the 1880 Census that might help determine the extent of denial or abridgment of voting rights. And the Clause, with one relatively minor exception, was largely ignored by Congress through the reapportionments that followed the censuses conducted between 1880 and 1910.\n\nThe Reduction Clause played a bit more of a role during the 1920 reapportionment stalemate. The main actor in the 1920s debate involving the Clause was Republican George Holden Tinkham from Massachusetts. At numerous points, Representative Tinkham and his allies attempted to make the widespread and obvious discrimination against Black voters in the South an issue in the reapportionment and to reduce the number of members of Congress granted to the southern states. In the end, though, these efforts bore little fruit.\n\nWith the normalization of the reapportionment process through the 1929 compromise, discussion of the Reduction Clause was limited in the next several decades; however, the Civil Rights Era of the 1950s and 1960s saw a renewal of interest in the Clause. During that time, Congress regularly debated whether to study application of the Reduction Clause and passed a provision in Title VIII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act that arguably moved the needle slightly toward putting some teeth into the Clause. And a lawsuit was filed in the D.C. District Court in 1963 that aimed to secure a declaratory judgment obligating executive branch officials to enforce the Clause for the 1970 Census. But momentum for any application of the Clause, through judicial intervention or otherwise, petered out with passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965.\n\nThe action involving the Reduction Clause in the 1960s momentarily implicated the federal judiciary and that judicial foray, where the lower federal courts decided against getting involved, is basically emblematic of both the judicial approach to the Clause and judicial involvement in reapportionment generally. By and large, courts have been hands off when it comes to arbitrating among competing interests jockeying for congressional seats. Indeed, the U.S. Supreme Court has never invalidated a reapportionment.\n\nThe Court’s generally laissez-faire approach to reapportionment can be seen in the early 1990s decision in United States Department of Commerce v. Montana. In that litigation, Montana claimed that the existing reapportionment formula violated Article I, Section Two because it did not “achieve the greatest possible equality in the number of individuals per representative.” In essence, Montana wanted the Court to implement a formula that would have advantaged smaller states. A three-judge federal district court sided with Montana. But the Supreme Court reversed. In doing so, the Court held that judicial interpretation of Article I, Section Two was not barred by the political questions doctrine. However, on the merits of Montana’s argument, the Court employed a very deferential standard of review, essentially holding that the current reapportionment formula was the product of a good-faith effort by Congress to fairly apportion representation. In short, Montana shows the Court unanimously choosing to give wide berth to reapportionment choices made by Congress.\n\nSimilarly hands-off was the Court’s approach in Franklin v. Massachusetts, where the Court avoided entering a dispute about the allocation of federal overseas employees to the states for reapportionment purposes. In that litigation, the Court held that decisions about the allocation of federal overseas employees made by the Secretary of Commerce were not final agency action reviewable by the judiciary under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). After dispensing with the idea that courts could adjudicate a violation of the APA, the Court proceeded to dispense with the contention that the Secretary’s allocation of federal overseas employees violated Article I, Section Two. In doing so, the Court noted that the Secretary “made a judgment, consonant with, though not dictated by, the text and history of the Constitution.” With this decision to defer to the Secretary’s judgment, the Court gave wide berth to a reapportionment choice made by the Executive Branch.\n\nDoctrinal details aside, the big-picture lesson of Franklin seems to be the same as Montana: the Supreme Court appears willing to extend quite a bit of deference to the other two federal branches of government when it comes to reapportionment.\n\nSo, let’s recap where we have been with reapportionment over time, commencing with reapportionment generally. Reapportionment historically was a political game played decennially. Every ten years, Congress had to decide upon a mathematical methodology to reapportion political power among the states. Congress was able to do that, though not without significant angst, for every decade from the Founding until 1910. Then, with the 1920 Census, the reapportionment process completely broke down. After a decade of reapportionment neglect, Congress cobbled together an agreement on a reapportionment process that would no longer necessitate a congressional reckoning after each census. Since the reapportionment that followed the 1930 Census, the process created out of the 1920s stalemate has functioned without too much fuss.\n\nNow consider Section Two of the Fourteenth Amendment and its Reduction Clause. The Clause was intended to solve a discrete problem related to the Confederate states (i.e., well-placed skepticism about their willingness to provide full voting rights to newly freed slaves). Initially, for the 1870 Census, the Executive Branch attempted to implement the Reduction Clause—without success. Another branch of the federal government (Congress) has never employed the Clause even during the most despicable eras of voting rights violations in U.S. history. And the judiciary has avoided entering the reapportionment thicket to mandate change—using the Reduction Clause or otherwise. That judicial inaction has been a good thing and, as will be discussed in the next part, should continue.\n\nIII. Don’t Mess with Reapportionment\n\nThings have been relatively quiet for nearly a century when it comes to reapportionment, but some have called for upsetting the apple cart by either changing the formula or using the judiciary to pump life into the Reduction Clause. These are not good ideas for a variety of reasons.\n\nOne of the recent calls for reapportionment reform is Professor Ruoxi Li’s proposal to revise the reapportionment formula. Professor Li proposes switching away from the current formula because it is slightly biased in favor of less populated states. Professor Li advocates use of an alternative formula, the “Webster method” that Congress used a few times in the past, to eliminate this slight bias.\n\nBut reopening congressional debate on the formula would potentially open up a new front in what have been termed the “voting wars,” which has become a shorthand phrase to describe the highly partisan battles over the democratic process that have occurred during the last couple of decades (i.e., since Bush v. Gore). Depending on the politics—whether there will be a short-term benefit for either Republicans or Democrats from a change in the formula—each side of the political aisle would be likely to predictably line up to either support or to oppose such a change. Indeed, this sort of short-term partisan gain has manifested itself before as the current reapportionment formula was chosen by Democrats because, at the time it was chosen, it provided a very slight advantage to them. Given the current poisonous, hyper-partisan political climate, reopening debate on the reapportionment formula has the potential to create a cleavage where no significant division currently exists. While others might disagree, opening up another potential front in the voting wars does not seem like the best of ideas or something that will amount to a positive for the political culture of the United States.\n\nBut maybe the flaw with the current formula is so pressing that it would be worth it to reopen the potential political Pandora’s Box of reapportionment. Maybe there is a great wrong with the current reapportionment formula that needs to be righted. Maybe the current reapportionment formula is the modern-day equivalent of the incredible malapportionment of legislative districts that occurred prior to the redistricting revolution in the 1960s brought on by Baker v. Carr. Maybe the current reapportionment formula is a cancer on the body politic.\n\nDoubtful. Political scientists have essentially concluded that no reapportionment formula can be perfect along every dimension, so choices must be made along these dimensions. Without delving into the gory mathematical details, Congress made a choice to use a formula that falls into a category of formulas called divisor methods. Divisor methods can be categorized along a continuum from those methods that consistently favor less populous states to those methods that consistently favor more populous states, and the trick is to find the method that least exhibits bias one way or the other (i.e., the most “unbiased” formula). The current formula represents Congress’s choice to compromise by choosing the median formula of five formulas they considered that fell along the continuum. In other words, when Congress chose the current formula, they had been presented with five formulas, including the Webster method, and they chose the one they thought fell in the middle of either being biased toward less populous states or being biased toward more populous states. (Recall that Congress also apparently chose the formula that was the most expedient in the short-term to the ruling political party at the time.) Such compromise in the face of a conceded inability to make things totally perfect hardly seems like a major blemish on American democracy.\n\nAnd even if one were to choose the most unbiased reapportionment formula, as determined by political scientists, the slight benefit of perfecting the formula likely would be outweighed by the costs of opening another front in the voting wars. As Professor Li has noted, the most unbiased divisor method is the Webster method. But a change from the current formula to the Webster method would likely not make much of a difference. For the nine reapportionments conducted between 1940 and 2020 using the current formula, a switch to the Webster method would have led, on average, to one state losing a seat and one state gaining a seat at each reapportionment. So, we would reopen the reapportionment battle to fine-tune the formula to account for a bias that would, on average, reallocate one (or about 0.22%) of the 435 seats every decade. And we would potentially be creating a new front in the voting wars over the placement of a single seat when even Professor Li, who advocates for such a switch, admits that change seems unlikely. While different people can certainly have different views about the costs and benefits, it just doesn’t seem worth it to tinker with the current formula.\n\nThat said, the refreshing thing about a call for Congress to revisit and revise the reapportionment formula is that it involves a political solution chosen by Congress. Congress can decide what it wants to do with the formula that governs its own internal workings. And if Congress chooses to change or to stand pat, that’s just like any other choice Congress makes to act or not act of its own volition.\n\nFar worse than a political debate in Congress would be judicial entry into the political thicket that could potentially create reapportionment chaos. For instance, a court might order the Commerce Department to redo the 2020 Census and reapportionment to account for the Reduction Clause. Indeed, such litigation is already working its way through the federal courts where a nonprofit group has filed suit seeking to have the most recent report compiled by the Census Bureau set aside, for the 2010 reapportionment to be reinstated, and for the Census Bureau to be ordered to conduct a new analysis that would account for the Reduction Clause. Not exactly a small ask of a judicial order!\n\nFor such litigation to be successful, Congress must have delegated to the Executive Branch the power to implement the Reduction Clause. While there is some debate, at least one commentator, Michael Hurta, has argued that the Executive Branch currently has statutory authority to implement the Clause. (The details of Michael Hurta’s basic argument are not necessary to an understanding of the points made here but appear in this footnote.)\n\nAssuming the accuracy of Michael Hurta’s statutory interpretation, let’s sketch what might happen if the judiciary orders the Executive Branch to tabulate reapportionment using the Reduction Clause. If a court orders the Census Bureau to produce revised reapportionment numbers implementing the Clause, then the Census Bureau has to decide what amounts to a denial or an abridgment of voting rights as contemplated by the Clause’s language. And the Census Bureau will have to make such decisions in the absence of a clear indication as to what those who adopted the Fourteenth Amendment meant by those words—particularly with regard to a vote being “abridged.”\n\nWhat sorts of laws could be considered denials or abridgments of voting rights that should be included in the mix? Consider just a smattering of issues that might be put on the table:\n\nA state denies the ability to vote to those who have been adjudicated insane.\n\nA state has a pre-election day deadline (say, thirty days) to register to vote.\n\nA state has no early voting.\n\nA state limits absentee voting to a narrow class of persons (e.g., the elderly) and does not allow other persons to vote absentee.\n\nA state makes persons appear at a polling location to cast a vote instead of allowing mail-in ballots.\n\nA state requires voters to provide a government-issued photo identification to prove their identity at the polls.\n\nA state uses precinct-based polling places instead of vote centers.\n\nA state requires voters to vote in their correct precinct to have their vote counted.\n\nThe point of these very realistic scenarios is not to compile an exhaustive list of such issues, it’s to demonstrate that many, many regulations that states make related to casting and counting a ballot could, in theory, lead to a denial or abridgment of voting rights. And the above list, which again, is by no means comprehensive, could easily be further sliced and diced. Take, for example, voter registration, where there could be variations such as a 30-day deadline, a 28-day deadline, a 15-day deadline, a 12-day deadline and so on. Put simply, the possibility to view electoral regulations as denying or abridging individual voting rights is seemingly endless and will need to be calculated to account for every single state’s unique electoral ecosystem.\n\nAssume, though, that the Census Bureau clears that hurdle and compiles a list of practices that deny or abridge voting rights in the abstract. The obvious next question to be answered is how much denial or abridgement is being created by whatever legal barrier each state has in place. This will require the Census Bureau to make estimates about how many persons in each state are unable to vote because of, say, a voter registration deadline or how many persons in each state are unable to vote because of the mechanism used to identify voters at the polls or how many persons are unable to vote because they are not allowed to vote absentee. It’s probably possible to do this—one can typically find an expert who will purport to model and quantify just about anything—but how credible will these estimates be? The Census Bureau can barely come up with a semi-accurate count of just basic total population per state for reapportionment purposes, and the implementation of the Reduction Clause per order of a federal court will require the Census Bureau to add an additional and potentially much more complicated layer to the process. That does not seem wise.\n\nPerhaps the Census Bureau could simplify the above process in some way by looking at voter registration rates or turnout rates in each of the states and using those rates as a proxy for representation reduction—but such an approach would also present difficulties. Voter registration lists are notoriously poor. And the fact that a person is registered to vote tells one very little about whether someone was actually able to cast a countable ballot. For instance, a registered voter might not have cast a ballot because of, say, too few opportunities to register their preference (e.g., no early voting, absentee voting, or vote-by-mail) or, say, a highly restrictive voter identification requirement. Using turnout data also has problems, as turnout is very much contingent on the nature of the election. Turnout may well be lower in places with less competitive elections and the lack of competitiveness of elections could have more to do with the candidates vying for office than with legal barriers to casting a ballot. And the top reasons why people do not vote generally have nothing to do with the direct impact of election laws. Indeed, election mechanics may not have a major impact on turnout.\n\nBeyond devising a method to operationalize what amounts to denial or abridgement of voting rights under the Reduction Clause, there’s also the issue of who devises such a method. Census Bureau employees work for the Executive Branch and the Executive Branch contains partisan political actors who have the capability (and likely the inclination) to make partisan political decisions. So what we might predictably expect to happen if the Census Bureau undertakes this course of action is that decisions about categorizing electoral laws and estimating impact will be made in a partisan manner. In other words, depending on who is in power, Democrats will make judgments to advantage their reapportionment prospects and Republicans will make judgments to advantage their reapportionment prospects. It would almost be naïve to think otherwise, as the Census Bureau already faces accusations of partisanship from both sides. And then when the Census Bureau does make partisan decisions related to enforcement of the Reduction Clause, what’s the solution for that? More litigation in front of federal judges? And how much should we trust federal judges to be nonpartisan actors in all this?\n\nTo summarize, even if a federal court were to interpret the current statutory scheme as enabling the Executive Branch to issue data implementing the Reduction Clause, such a federal court order would be fraught with potential problems. The Census Bureau would need to do something that no entity has done in the more than 150-year history of the Clause —determine which laws deny or abridge voting rights and then determine how much such laws deny or abridge voting rights. And all of this would be done under the guidance of political actors within the Executive Branch who would certainly not be disinterested in the myriad of choices that could be made. Instead of the relative calm currently surrounding reapportionment, there would likely be a pitched political battle.\n\nSo, one way the judiciary could intervene to enforce the Reduction Clause would be to order the Executive Branch to produce data that accounts for the Clause pursuant to current federal statutory law, but there is another possible approach. Professor Gerard Magliocca does not think current federal statutory law allows the Executive Branch to implement the Reduction Clause. Instead, Professor Magliocca thinks “a state with standing to challenge the next round of reapportionment results should raise a Section Two [Reduction Clause] claim, and the Supreme Court should respond by holding that the present allocation system is unconstitutional.” Or, as he more simply puts it, the current reapportionment statutes “must be invalidated for violating Section Two of the Fourteenth Amendment.” The reason why Professor Magliocca thinks the statute is unconstitutional is unimportant at this point but will be discussed a bit in Part III—the important point for current purposes is that his proposal would completely pull the plug on the current process.\n\nProfessor Magliocca’s approach of throwing the entire compromise from the 1920s out the window would be strong medicine and amounts to an invitation to return to the chaos of the years preceding the compromise forged after the total failure to reapportion. Again, reapportionment was never a smooth process, and it eventually completely broke down in the 1920s. Congress forged a compromise to essentially put things on autopilot and that autopilot has functioned just as intended for decade upon decade. But after nearly a century of relative quiet, Professor Magliocca’s proposal would send the whole thing to the dumpster.\n\nThe judiciary should not throw out a process that has functioned untouched for decades, particularly in the context of our current political climate. Consider these words from Professor Pamela Karlan:\n\nThe United States . . . was a nation characterized by unease and polarization. Americans lacked “their former confidence in democracy or religion.” There was deep distrust between the growing and increasingly cosmopolitan cities and declining small towns in the Midwest and the South. [There was] a tension between “the new urban civilization with its irresistible economic and scientific and mass power” and “the older American village civilization making its last stand against what to it look[ed] like an alien invasion.” Traditionalists perceived a threat “from enclaves of the foreign-born, not yet adapted to American ways,” immigrants who seemed racially different from their predecessors. The urban-rural tensions played out in substantive differences over everything from morals legislation . . . to tax and trade policy.\n\nProfessor Karlan’s description sounds a lot like the current political climate in the United States. But she was actually describing the 1920s —the decade during which reapportionment did not happen at all.\n\nSo, Professor Magliocca’s approach would likely turn what has been a dormant political issue for decades into a very active political volcano at a time that seems remarkably similar to the moment when reapportionment ended in stalemate. And, even more, once the current process gets chucked for failure to implement the Reduction Clause, we return to the difficulties recounted above of implementing the never-used Clause. Again, this does not seem like a worthwhile endeavor.\n\nOf course, all of the previous discussion might be incorrect. Reopening debate about the reapportionment formula or ordering the Census Bureau to recalculate reapportionment using the Reduction Clause or throwing the entire system out the window for failure to take account of the Clause might not create any issues. It could all end up as “champagne wishes and caviar dreams,” to quote an old television mantra. One must have the humility to admit that one can never know what future events might bring. That said, the problems and scenarios sketched out above seem much more likely than serene sailing.\n\nFinally, none of this should be read as a contention that democratic enfranchisement is somehow perfect at this moment in time and that improvements to allow for greater potential enfranchisement should not be adopted. For example, at the current time, there may be far less justification for having lengthy pre-election voter registration deadlines or even any voter registration deadline at all. After all, voter registration deadlines might be among the single biggest legal barriers to electoral turnout. But such progress when it comes to voting rights should come in the form of direct legislation rather than indirect application of the Reduction Clause that has never been used even in times of far starker disfranchisement that exists in the twenty-first century United States.\n\nWhen it comes to messing with the existing reapportionment process, we would be wise to consider the closing words of Justice John Paul Stevens from 1992 in Department of Commerce v. Montana, where the Court rejected a challenge to the current reapportionment formula:\n\nThe decision to adopt the [current reapportionment formula] was made by Congress after decades of experience, experimentation, and debate about the substance of the constitutional requirement. Independent scholars supported both the basic decision to adopt a regular procedure to be followed after each census and the particular decision to use the [current reapportionment formula]. For a half century the results of that method have been accepted by the States and the Nation. That history supports our conclusion that Congress had ample power to enact the statutory procedure in 1941 and to apply the [current reapportionment formula] after the 1990 Census.\n\nSimilarly, when it comes to implementation of the Reduction Clause, the judiciary would be wise to shy away from pulling the rug out from under something that has been “accepted by the States and the Nation” for decades upon decades.\n\nIV. Strategies for the Judiciary to Avoid Messing with Reapportionment\n\nHaving opined that the judiciary should not mess with reapportionment from what might be described as a pragmatic perspective, this section embarks on a tour of some jurisprudential strategies the judiciary might employ to avoid entering the Reduction Clause political thicket. Importantly, the ideas and strategies put forward here are just that—ideas and strategies. Thus, this is written from a perspective that judicial lawmaking, when it comes to the Reduction Clause, is a place where judges have broad power to manipulate decision-making to arrive at just about any conclusion. When it comes to constitutional decision-making at the Supreme Court level, there often is no clearly right answer in a vacuum and lots of wiggle room. There are political choices to be made, and this section briefly theorizes some doctrinal avenues that might support a judicial choice to leave reapportionment alone.\n\nThe Political Questions Doctrine. One way the federal courts could avoid entering the thicket of Reduction Clause jurisprudence would be to employ the political questions doctrine. The political questions doctrine is a quite malleable tool involving many different facets with the basic doctrinal framework emanating from Baker v. Carr:\n\nProminent on the surface of any case held to involve a political question is found a textually demonstrable constitutional commitment of the issue to a coordinate political department; or a lack of judicially discoverable and manageable standards for resolving it; or the impossibility of deciding without an initial policy determination of a kind clearly for nonjudicial discretion; or the impossibility of a court’s undertaking independent resolution without expressing lack of the respect due coordinate branches of government; or an unusual need for unquestioning adherence to a political decision already made; or the potentiality of embarrassment from multifarious pronouncements by various departments on one question.\n\nPrior to Baker, circuit courts held that issues surrounding the Reduction Clause amounted to a political question. For example, the plaintiffs in Saunders v. Wilkins, a lawsuit filed after the 1940 reapportionment, sought to enforce the Clause as a strategy to eliminate Virginia’s poll tax. In holding that enforcement of the Reduction Clause constituted a nonjusticiable political question, the Saunders court wrote:\n\n[I]n determining whether a question is political and not justiciable, the dominant considerations are the appropriateness under our system of government of attributing finality to the action of the political departments and also the lack of satisfactory criteria for judicial determination. It is our opinion that the question involved in the pending case, viewed from either aspect, will be seen to be political.\n\nEven after Baker, one could plausibly contend that Reduction Clause litigation implicates virtually every factor listed in Baker. Consider as follows (where relevant factors from Baker are in quotes):\n\nThere is evidence that the Framers intended Article I, Section Two to expressly provide Congress the exclusive authority to reapportion. And, adding to that notion, nobody seriously tried to enforce the Reduction Clause through the courts—despite widespread, obvious disfranchisement—for decades following its passage. These understandings and events could then be used to support the idea that when it comes to the Reduction Clause, there is a “textually demonstrable constitutional commitment of the issue to” Congress.\n\nIn the many years reapportionment has occurred, the Judicial Branch has played, at most, a limited role in the reapportionment process, with the Supreme Court never intervening to undo any reapportionment on any ground. The judiciary entering the fray in Reduction Clause litigation could demonstrate a “lack of the respect due coordinate branches.” Indeed, reapportionment goes to the core of congressional operations—who gets to be seated in Congress.\n\nInvalidating a reapportionment and reverting to some other reapportionment, as has been requested as relief in the current federal litigation, could lead to “multifarious pronouncements by various departments on [the reapportionment] question.” The President has transmitted a finding to Congress and Congress, through the Clerk of the House, has transmitted to each state the amount of representation it has secured. A court would be undoing each of those pronouncements.\n\nReapportionment might be a place where there is “an unusual need for unquestioning adherence to a political decision already made.” Reapportionment needs to happen quickly—before the election of the first Congress following the census—and if a court intervenes on Reduction Clause grounds, it risks delaying elections. Also, if a court invalidates a reapportionment after it has happened and after elections have occurred, that calls into question the legitimacy of Congress and potentially, depending on the timing, the legitimacy of a Presidential election because reapportionment impacts representation in the Electoral College.\n\nBut the core issues when it comes to the political questions doctrine and the Reduction Clause might be “a lack of judicially discoverable and manageable standards [and] the impossibility of deciding without an initial policy determination of a kind clearly for nonjudicial discretion.” No one has been able to implement the Reduction Clause in the entirety of its history, so a court would have to make the policy decision as to how to implement the Clause. Why? Because it is likely that to have standing (see discussion below), a state would need to show it would get greater representation in Congress if the Clause were implemented. And in order for a state to show they would get additional representation, the state would have to come up with a method to implement the Clause that the judiciary would have to accept as valid for standing purposes.\n\nAnother thing to consider when it comes to judicially manageable standards is what might happen after a court declares a reapportionment invalid or tosses out the current reapportionment process. What happens if the Executive Branch and Congress do not, for whatever reason, follow through and implement the Reduction Clause? Would a court order the Executive or Congress to craft a new reapportionment? Would a court reinstate the previous reapportionment that, presumably, was also flawed? Or might a court order up its own Reduction Clause methodology and implementation the way courts draw redistricting plans when political actors cannot reach agreement on new district lines? As discussed previously, that could be quite a complex undertaking that would involve delving into the laws of all fifty states and making complex policy judgments about the impacts of various laws. Or, perhaps the Court might choose a simpler proxy (e.g., voter registration, turnout) to implement the Clause, but that would involve policy determinations as well.\n\nTo be sure, the Court has rejected resorting to the political questions doctrine in the context of a prior reapportionment challenge. In United States Department of Commerce v. Montana (discussed in Part II), the Court rejected the government’s contention that the choice of the reapportionment formula presented a nonjusticiable political question.\n\nBut Montana could be avoided. For starters, the analysis of the political questions doctrine in Montana is quite cursory, with the Court failing to engage in any sort of deep analysis of the issue. In essence, the Court’s discussion quickly waves its hand at the political questions issue and moves on to the merits of the case. Beyond the cursory analysis though, Montana contains language that could be used to cabin its holding. The Court noted that “the reasons that supported the justiciability of challenges to state legislative districts, as in Baker v. Carr . . . apply with equal force to the issues presented by this litigation.” Importantly, the issues presented in Montana did not involve the Reduction Clause. Moreover, the choice of a formula to determine fractional remainders in seats (the issue Montana presented) would seem to be far less complex than choices that would need to be made to implement the Reduction Clause. Thus, a court could distinguish Montana and make a more limited use of the political questions doctrine aimed expressly at the Reduction Clause rather than reapportionment generally. And limiting such a holding to the Reduction Clause context could make perfect sense given that the Clause was ratified at a different time than Article II.\n\nIn sum, legitimate arguments exist that litigation related to the Reduction Clause presents a nonjusticiable political question and no clear precedent rejects such a contention. Thus, the political questions doctrine provides one possibility for the federal judiciary to remain on the Reduction Clause sidelines.\n\nStanding. The standing doctrine provides another avenue of jurisprudential avoidance. Here is the quintessential Supreme Court statement of standing doctrine:\n\nOver the years, our cases have established that the irreducible constitutional minimum of standing contains three elements. First, the plaintiff must have suffered an “injury in fact”—an invasion of a legally protected interest which is (a) concrete and particularized, and (b) “actual or imminent, not ‘conjectural’ or ‘hypothetical.’” Second, there must be a causal connection between the injury and the conduct complained of—the injury has to be “fairly . . . trace[able] to the challenged action of the defendant, and not . . . th[e] result [of] the independent action of some third party not before the court.” Third, it must be “likely,” as opposed to merely “speculative,” that the injury will be “redressed by a favorable decision.”\n\nThe standing doctrine could be used against individual plaintiffs by holding that any claims they bring would be too speculative. For example, assume an individual from Massachusetts brought litigation claiming that they reside in a state that would gain representation if Reduction Clause data were calculated. However, it’s quite possible that if Reduction Clause data were calculated, Massachusetts would not gain a seat. In this way, a court could reject the claim on standing grounds because the injury is speculative. Notably, this exact reasoning has previously been used by a federal court. Another potential litigant against whom standing could be used to reject their claim would be a person who claimed injury because they resided in a state, say Texas, that denied or abridged their voting rights. The argument would run that the Reduction Clause should be used to penalize the state denying or abridging voting rights, the penalty would lead to the state reforming its voting process, and that would lead to the individual being able to vote. But this theory as well could be rejected as speculative because it’s not entirely certain that the penalty would lead to reform, and a court has previously endorsed this sort of reasoning to avoid opining on the Reduction Clause.\n\nWhen it comes to standing, the most likely scenario for a court to find standing would be for a state to bring the litigation. There does not appear to be a clear precedent related to the standing of a state to bring a lawsuit against the results of reapportionment. Montana discussed the political questions doctrine, but not standing. However, by reaching the merits of the claim, Montana could fairly be read as endorsing state standing so long as the state demonstrates it would gain a seat under a reapportionment conducted using the Reduction Clause.\n\nBut that would be the rub. To show that it would gain a seat through use of the Reduction Clause, the state would have to put forward an analysis of every state’s voting laws to demonstrate that a reapportionment properly using the Clause would produce new totals that would entitle the state to an additional seat. And once again, we end up in the position of attempting what would appear to be a herculean task of comprehensively categorizing the level of disfranchisement caused by the electoral regimes in each state, an exercise that would likely be fraught with guesswork and quite likely be speculative. Moreover, to assert that a state would gain representation if the Clause was considered, a court would have to choose a framework for implementing the Clause that would lead to the change in the state’s representation. This leaves the judiciary having to make Reduction Clause policy choices, mentioned in the political questions doctrine discussion, for the purpose of deciding standing.\n\nBetween the tenets of the political questions doctrine and standing, a court could basically create the following circle to preclude challenges to a reapportionment on Reduction Clause grounds: To have standing to challenge a reapportionment on Reduction Clause grounds, one has to show that one has been injured; to show one has been injured, one has to show that proper application of the Clause would result in a gain of a congressional seat; however, it is beyond a court’s judicial capability to decide how the Clause should be implemented; therefore, no one has standing to sue. Sure, it’s a circular argument that leads to no one being able to assert a claim, but a court interested in judicial avoidance might embrace such an argument.\n\nThe Merits. If a court did not choose to use the political questions doctrine or standing (or some combination of both) to avoid opining on Reduction Clause litigation, a court could potentially reach the merits to find a way out.\n\nOne escape hatch on the merits would be to find that the Reduction Clause was superseded by passage of the Fifteenth Amendment. In a comprehensive article, Professor Gabriel Chin contends that the Fifteenth Amendment repealed Section Two of the Fourteenth Amendment as it relates to voting rights. Without delving too far into the details and nuance, Professor Chin’s basic argument is that the Reduction Clause was a failure. To cure this failure, Congress passed the Fifteenth Amendment that more broadly protected voting rights. And the broader protection found in the Fifteenth Amendment renders the Reduction Clause a dead letter. Of course, this theory is not without its counterarguments and doubters, but it’s a plausible avenue for a court to take.\n\nAnother escape hatch for a court to take on the merits of a lawsuit seeking to compel the Executive Branch to account for the Reduction Clause, would be to say that the statutory scheme does not allow the Executive Branch to do so. Recall that there is disagreement among scholars about whether the statute delegates such authority to the Executive Branch. Without such a delegation, a court would likely not be able to order the Executive Branch to produce data that accounted for the Clause.\n\nFinally, assuming a court was presented with a challenge to the process itself (as opposed to a challenge seeking to have the Census Bureau produce data related to the Reduction Clause), the court could hold that the process complies with the Constitution. The idea that the process itself is unconstitutional relies on the fact that Congress has delegated to the Executive Branch a mandate to generate reapportionment data but has not concomitantly delegated the ability to consider the Clause. The idea is essentially that Congress has ordered the Executive Branch to not comply with a provision of the Constitution.\n\nIn replying to this contention, one could note that implementation of the reapportionment process does not cease with the President’s transmission of data to Congress. After the President’s transmission to Congress, the Clerk of the House of Representatives still must issue certificates to the states that provide them with notice of the number of seats to which they are entitled. A court might determine that the window of time between which the President sends the reapportionment results to Congress and the time the House Clerk issues certificates to the states provides Congress the opportunity to consider and apply the Reduction Clause. After all, the existing statute contemplates that the current process can be short-circuited by a new reapportionment act. Put another way, it’s perfectly legitimate for Congress to delegate to the Executive Branch the calculation of reapportionment data without accounting for the Clause and reserve for itself the question of implementing the Clause. And, if this is the situation, then a court could uphold the process and conclude that a given Congress’s decision not to implement the Reduction Clause in that window is a reasonable choice—especially given the fact that no Congress in history has implemented the Clause. Granted, this may appear formalistic but again, the point of this discussion is to locate potential methods of judicial avoidance, not necessarily a perfect one.\n\nAt the end of the day, a number of different potential avenues exist for a court to not mess with reapportionment. Some arguments may be stronger, some arguments may be weaker. And it seems likely even more arguments exist than have been mentioned in the relatively quick tour above. (Of course, there will undoubtedly be credible counterarguments.) In the end though, adoption of the most credible argument (or arguments) from the perspective of not messing with reapportionment would be the optimal judicial approach.\n\nV. Conclusion\n\nReapportionment was a thorn in the side of Congress for many years and ultimately became so thorny that Congress was unable to reapportion for an entire decade in the 1920s. After that debacle, Congress created a system to make the reapportionment process much smoother. Historically, the judiciary has generally not been much of a player when it comes to reapportionment, so we should reject calls for changing the process or using the judiciary to compel the use of a constitutional provision, the Reduction Clause, that has not been implemented in its more than 150-year history. Democracy in the United States is certainly imperfect but the reapportionment process and judicial meddling with the process should not be contemplated as the vehicle for change. Reapportionment, though perhaps not ideal, is working just fine. Don’t mess with reapportionment."
