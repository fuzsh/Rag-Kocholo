To the SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES : Pursuant to the requirements of section 10 of the Federal reserve act, I have the honor to submit the Seventeenth Annual Report, prepared by direction of the Federal Reserve Board, covering operations during the calendar year 1930. Yours respectfully, EUGENE MEYER, Governor. IX ANNUAL REPORT OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD The year 1930 was marked by reduced demand for bank credit from trade and industry and by decreasing commodity prices and money rates, all characteristic of a period of declining activity in business. In these circumstances the Federal reserve system pursued a policy of monetary ease. This policy was expressed through the purchase at intervals of additional United States Government securities and in progressive reductions of reserve bank discount and acceptance rates. Other influences contributing to monetary ease in the United States were gold imports in large volume from Latin America and the Orient, and a diminished domestic demand for currency throughout the larger part of the year, caused by the decline in business activity and in the level of commodity prices. The inflow of gold from abroad and of currency from circulation had the effect of reducing the volume of reserve bank credit outstanding during the year. Member and nonmember bank credit also declined, reflecting a reduction in the demand for loans from the banks' customers engaged in trade and industry, which was offset only in part by an increase in the banks' holdings of investment securities and of paper purchased in the open market. Bank failures were in larger number in 1930 than in previous years, most of the failures being of small rural banks that had been in a weakened condition for some time; but there were also a few failures of large city banks that had accumulated unliquid loans and suffered losses in recent years through operations based directly or indirectly on overvalued real estate and securities. FEDERAL, RESERVE CREDIT Money rates, which for more than a year prior to October, 1929, had been on a rising level—owing largely to the rapid growth in the demand for credit to finance speculative activities in many lines and in different sections of the country—declined after the autumn break in the financial markets of the country. Industrial activity, which had reached a peak in June, 1929, also declined in the latter part of that year, particularly in the last two months, and the level of commodity prices showed a sharp recession. The Federal reserve system during the last two months of 1929 purchased $350,000,000 1 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD of United States securities and reduced discount and acceptance rates. During 1930 further purchases of United States securities were made at intervals and rates for discounts and acceptances were reduced by successive steps, as noted below. The chart below shows the course of Federal reserve bank credit and its components during 1929 and 1930. During the month of March, 1930, holdings of securities increased to $530,000,000 and remained at that figure to the end of May. During the summer months these holdings were increased to $600,000,000 and remained at about that figure until December, when additional purchases of a temporary nature were made, partly for the purpose MILLIONS OF DOLLARS 2000 MILLIONS OF DOLLARS RESERVE BANK CREDIT ( 2000 Weekly Averages of Daily Figures ) 1500 1500 1000 1000 500 1929 1930 of counteracting the tightening effect of seasonal credit and currency demands upon the money market and partly in connection with disturbances in the banking situation. Acceptance holdings of the reserve banks, which were at about $390,000,000 at the opening of the year, declined during the first six months, when seasonal influences are in this direction, and reached a low level of $100,000,000 by the end of June. This decline in bill holdings was due in part to the fact that, with the abundance of short-time funds in the money market, bills offered an attractive investment for banks and others, and bill offerings to the reserve banks consequently declined. From midsummer reserve bank holdings of bills showed a seasonal expansion, and at the close of the ANNUAL REPORT OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD & year they were at about the same figure as at the end of 1929. During the larger part of- the crop-marketing season, however, when these holdings usually show the greatest increase of the year, the system's holdings of acceptances increased less than usual, largely because of considerable purchases of bills by member banks. Toward the end of November member bank holdings of acceptances reached the unprecedented total of $500,000,000, and the member banks were accordingly enabled in the last weeks of the year to obtain a considerable part of their seasonal requirements through the sale of acceptances to the reserve banks, and the reserve banks'9 holdings of open-market bills consequently increased rapidly in December. During the autumn, when the export movement of agricultural commodities is at its peak, the Federal reserve banks in 1930, as in 1929, bought moderate amounts of foreign exchange bills, which were carried over the year end. The growth in the open-market portfolio of the reserve banks in a year when the total demand for reserve bank credit was relatively small and was not increasing resulted in a reduction of member bank indebtedness, which between the middle of March and the latter part of November was around the lowest level for any length of time since 1917. Discounts remained at approximately $225,000,000 from April to December, but rose to a maximum of $450,000,000 on the day preceding Christmas, when currency demand reached its seasonal peak and when a large volume of currency had been called into use in connection with bank failures. This temporary rise was followed by a rapid liquidation after the holiday demand was over. While discounts for all member banks were at a low level throughout the year, banks in the financial centers were practically out of debt during a considerable part of the year. This low level of indebtedness at the reserve banks was an influence in the direction of easier money conditions, which were reflected in lower rates both on open-market paper and on loans made by banks to their customers. The chart brings out the course of money rates for the years 1919 to 1930, showing that the rates in the latter part of 1930 were lower than at any other time during the 12-year period covered. Rates on acceptances fell from 5% per cent in the autumn of 1929 to 1% per cent at the close of 1930; rates on commercial paper from §y± to 2% per cent, while call money was around 2 per cent, frequently falling below that level in the last six months of the year. Kates charged to customers by banks in New York City, which from August through October, 1929, had been above 6 per cent, had dropped to 4% per cent by the end of 1930. The year, therefore, was one of low rates for money. ANNUAL REPOBT OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD Between October, 1929, and the early days of 1931 discount rates at the reserve banks were reduced from 6 to 2 per cent at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York; from 5 to 2y2 per cent at Boston; from 5 to 3 per cent at Cleveland, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, and PER'CENT MONEY RATES IN NEW YORK CITY Call Money Commercial Paper Bankers 'Acceptances 1919 1920 1921 1922 1923 \\)V* 1925 1926 1927 1928 1929 1930 San Francisco; and from 5 to 3% per cent at Philadelphia, Richmond, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and Dallas.

This decrease in reserve bank credit reflected a gradual increase in the stock of monetary gold, which for the year amounted to $310,000,000, and a decline of currency in circulation through the larger part of the year, while member bank reserve balances remained relatively constant.

GOLD During 1930, $310,000,000 was added to the stock of monetary gold in the United States, bringing the weekly average figure at the close of the year to $4,590,000,000. This amount was within less than $100,000,000 of the peak figure of May, 1927. The latter part of 1927 had been marked by easy money conditions in the United 6 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD States, and this fact, together with the restoration of the French franc and other currencies to the gold standard, had led to a heavy outward movement of gold that continued through the first half of 1928. During 1928, however, money rates advanced in this country; and early in 1929 the movement of gold became definitely inward, with the result that in the first 10 months of 1929 the monetary gold stock of the United States rose by $238,000,000. This movement was abruptly terminated by the break in the stock market at the end of October and the rapid decline of money rates which followed, and in the final two months of the year $100,000,000 of gold was exported, but early in 1930 gold again began to flow to the United States. The circumstances surrounding the renewed influx of gold in 1930 differed in important respects from those which had influenced preceding movements. With the exception of two months in the summer, when gold was shipped fo France, the movement to Europe ceased. This was largely on account of the fact that money rates abroad, which had been kept up to protect the reserves of foreign countries against the attraction of speculative and high-money conditions in the United States, declined rapidly late in 1929, when these conditions changed. By the beginning of 1930 a temporarily balanced situation had developed as between this country and Europe, in which gold moved in neither direction. On the other hand, gold flowed into the United States from Japan, China, Brazil, Argentina, and other Central and South American countries, and gold flowed into England from South America and Australia. In general, the movement of gold was one from outlying countries producing raw materials to the financial centers and bore no significant relation to differentials in money rates. The difficulties in which the outlying countries found themselves reflected chiefly a decline in the value of many of their most important commodity exports, as well as the effects of a long period of conditions in the United States unfavorable to the flotation of foreign bonds. In Japan the immediate cause of the loss of gold was the removal on January 11, 1930, of the embargo on exports of the metal—a necessary final step in the return of the country to the gold standard. In Argentina, on the other hand, the redemption of notes in gold at the Government conversion office was discontinued on December 16, 1929, and by this means gold exports were prevented during the greater part of the year, and when they were resumed in the autumn of 1930 they were strictly controlled and for account of the Government only. In Australia, also, measures were taken in December, 1929, to make the shipment of gold subject to the discretion of the central authorities. In Brazil the de facto stabilization of the cur ANNUAL REPORT OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD 7 rency was abandoned at the close of 1929, and the Government stabilization office was abolished altogether on November 22, 1930. China, a silver-using country, was affected by the sharp appreciation of gold in terms of silver and the consequent barter of gold for silver. Japan continued to maintain an effective gold standard with a free gold market; but in Japan, as in the other countries mentioned, the pressure of the declining value of commodity exports, in conjunction with continued inability to borrow in volume abroad, resulted in gold exports as the only means for covering foreign payments. In these circumstances the United States received, during 1930, $157,000,000 gold from Japan, $88,000,000 from Brazil, $23,000,000 from China, $21,000,000 from Mexico, $20,000,000 from Argentina, and $36,000,000 from other Central and South American countries. England during the 15 months ending with December, 1930, acquired $136,000,000 of gold from Australia, $44,000,000 from Brazil, and $43,000,000 from Argentina. In all, $568,000,000, an amount substantially in excess of the total production of the gold mines of the world during 1930, was thus transferred to the monetary gold stocks of the more important financial centers. Of the gold, amounting to $345,000,000, received by the United States from these outlying countries, $74,000,000 was shipped to France. The gold received from similar sources by England, as well as $209,000,000 of newly mined gold received during the year from Rhodesia and South Africa, was largely exported to France. CURRENCY Another of the principal factors affecting changes in the demand for reserve bank credit is the course of domestic demand for money in circulation. A chart is here presented showing the volume of money in circulation from 1926 to 1930. The chart shows that the volume of United States money in circulation has been decreasing continuously since 1926. Up to 1929 this decrease was not due to any considerable extent to a decline in the volume of pay rolls or retail trade, usually the two principal factors of currency demand, but represented partly a decrease in the cash carried by banks in vault, a return flow of American currency from abroad, and a gradual increase in the use of checks as a substitute for cash payments. In 1930, on the other hand, the rapid decrease in currency in circulation and its maintenance in the autumn months at a level about $300,000,000 below that of 1929 reflected the effects of the slowing down in business activity. The chart on page 9 shows the course of industrial production and factory employment from 1919 to 1930. By the end of 1930 factory pay rolls had declined by 35 per cent from 33454—31 2 8 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD the peak of 1929, and retail trade was also in smaller volume as a result of a decline both in physical volume of trade and in retail prices. For the first 10 months of the year the return flow of currency from circulation was the largest single factor in the diminished demand for reserve bank credit. During the last two months of the year, however, the demand for currency rose by nearly $500,000,000, a much larger increase than is usual during the holiday season, even in years of active business.

December, in excess of seasonal requirements, was due to the failure of several large banks, which resulted in runs on other banks and currency withdrawals, together with an increase of bank holdings of vault cash as part of the process of maintaining an exceptionally liquid position. As a consequence of these developments, the amount of currency outstanding, which in October had been $300,000,000 lower than the year before, was at the end of 1930 as large as at the end of 1929. MEMBER BANK CREDIT Taking the year 1930 as a whole, there was relatively little change in the aggregate volume of reserve balances held by the member banks with the reserve banks—the other important factor in the demand for reserve bank credit—and the factor that is directly related ANNUAL REPORT OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD 9 to changes in the volume of member bank credit. The absence of change in member bank reserve balances during the year was due to the maintenance at the member banks of a fairly constant volume of demand and time deposits, on which the member banks' reserve requirements are based. Loans and investments of the banks, however, showed a considerable decline during the year, as the demand for credit by trade and industry diminished with the slackening of business activity.

The following table shows changes in the principal asset items of the member banks during that 15-month period: CHANGES IN ASSETS OF MEMBER BANKS—OCTOBER 4, 1929-DECEMBER 31, 1930 [In millions of dollars] Member banks in— Member All membanks outber banks New York Other re- side reserve cities City serve cities Loans and investments, total Loans to banks Loans to other customers, total Secured by stocks and bonds Secured by real estate.

The heavy liquidation of local customer loans was largely offset during that period by an increase in investments and in open-market loans, including acceptances, commercial paper, and street loans. The increase in street loans during that time represented that part of the loans withdrawn by nonbanking lenders that was taken over by the banks after the break in security prices. By the final quarter of 1930, however, these loans had declined to a small figure, and continued liquidation of security loans was reflected in a reduction of street loans by member banks for their own account, which at the end of the year were at a level $400,000,000 lower than before the break in the stock market. During the last quarter of 1930 there was little further liquidation of customer loans, but street loans continued to decline as the demand for accommodation from the stock market decreased, with the net result that loans and investments of member banks during the 15-month period decreased in all by $1,050,000,000. This decrease in total loans and investments of all member banks was not equally distributed between different groups of banks. At member banks in New York City total loans and investments showed an increase of $432,000,000 for the 15-month period, while member banks in other reserve cities showed a decrease of $226,000,000, and member banks outside reserve cities—so-called \" country banks \"— a decrease of $1,261,000,000. The largest decreases in all classes of banks were shown for loans made to customers, not secured by stocks and bonds or real estate, the decrease in these loans during the 15 months reflecting largely the reduction in volume of business activity. Loans to customers secured by stocks and bonds increased at New York banks, but decreased in the other groups of banks. The open-market loan portfolio of member banks showed relatively little change for the period, a considerable increase at New York City banks being somewhat more than offset by a decrease at country banks. Bank holdings of purchased acceptances and openmarket commercial paper, however, increased in New York and in the other reserve cities, though they diminished outside of these cities. Loans to brokers and dealers in securities in New York, so-called \"street loans,\" were at a somewhat higher level at New York City banks at the end of 1930 than on October 4, 1929, reflecting the taking over by these banks of a part of the loans previously made by nonbanking lenders; at the other two groups of banks these loans showed a large liquidation. Finally, the banks' holdings of investments increased in the aggregate by $1,240,000,000, reflecting ANNUAL REPORT OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD 11 increases of more than $600,000,000 both at the New York City banks and at other reserve city banks, while at country banks they showed a small reduction. At country banks there was in fact a liquidation all along the line. A part of it was due to the elimination of banks through suspensions, but there has also been a large-scale liquidation of credit at active banks in country districts, reflecting diminished activity of trade and industry in rural areas and a decline in deposits due in part to decreases in the value of agricultural products marketed, resulting both from a smaller volume of sales and a considerable reduction in the prices of principal crops. The liquidation of member bank credit during the 15 months ending in December, 1930, was accompanied by an even larger liquidation of nonmember bank credit. The latest figures available for nonmember banks show a decrease of $800,000,000 between October 4, 1929, and September 24, 1930. If the relation of the decrease in nonmember bank credit and in member bank credit may be assumed to have remained approximately the same during the last quarter, then the total decrease in bank credit outstanding for the 15-month period was in the neighborhood of $3,000,000,000. A part of this decrease in bank credit has been due to bank suspensions during the period, and represents the elimination from the aggregate resources of active banks of the resources of failed banks that have not been gradually absorbed in one way or another by other banks. In addition to the reduction of about $3,000,000,000 in outstanding bank credit during the 15-month period, there was also a liquidation of about $5,500,000,000 of loans by nonbanking lenders to brokers and dealers in securities. Consequently, total liquidation of credit extended by banks and by others through the banks has amounted to $8,500,000,000 for the period. For the banks of the country the period of 15 months ending in December of 1930 was one of readjustment and liquidation. Through the experience of this period and of the preceding few years many important problems connected with the structure and functioning of our banking system are becoming more clearly defined. These problems are at present receiving consideration by congressional committees. Since these committees are conducting investigations with a view to determining the need of legislative and administrative reforms, the Federal Eeserve Board refrains in this annual report from making recommendations to Congress. 12 ANNUAL EEPORT OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD DETAILS OF OPERATION In the preceding pages there has been presented a brief discussion of business and banking developments in 1930 and of the policies pursued by the Federal reserve system during the year. In the following sections of this report there is given a more detailed account of the operations of the Federal reserve banks and branches and of administrative matters with which the Federal Reserve Board has dealt during 1930. EARNINGS, EXPENSES, AND VOLUME OF WORK OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE! BANKS During 1930 the gross earnings of the Federal reserve banks, at $36,424,000, were $34,531,000 less than in 1929 and the lowest since 1917. The deduction of current expenses of $28,343,000—somewhat less than the previous year—and adjustments for depreciation, reserves for losses and self-insurance, resulted in net earnings of $7,988,000 available for distribution as dividends, transfers to surplus, and franchise tax to the Government. Earnings, expenses,, and distribution of earnings for all reserve banks combined for 1929 and 1930 are summarized in the accompanying table.

Earnings from bills discounted decreased from $47,791,000 in 1929 to $10,672,000 in 1930, the result of a decrease of $679,000,000 in average daily holdings of discounts and a lowering of the average rate of earnings from 5.03 per cent to 3.93 per cent. Earnings from bills bought in the open market were also lower, but earnings from the larger holdings of Government securities, at $17,273,000, were $9,108,000 larger than in 1929. The rate of return on bills bought in the open market was 2.85 per cent in 1930, compared with 5 per cent ANNUAL REPORT OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD 13 in 1929; on Government securities 3.06 per cent, compared with 3.93 per cent.

Total current expenses of the Federal reserve banks in 1930 were $28,343,000 which is $1,348,000 less than in 1929. The cost of printing, issuing, and redeeming currency was $924,000 lower than the figure of $3,099,000 for the previous year, when this cost was unusually high by reason of the expense incurred in the process of substituting notes of smaller dimension for the old size. Salaries paid to officers aggregated $2,680,000 for the year, and to clerical staff and others $14,574,000, making a total expenditure of $17,254,000 for all salaries and wages, compared with $17,265,000 in the preceding year. Other major expenditures included taxes on banking houses aggregating $1,374,000, as against $1,470,000, and telegraphic and postage charges amounting to $2,247,000, as against $2,444,000 in 1929. The average number of officers and employees decreased from 9,995 in 1929 to 9,797 in 1930, and there was some falling off in the volume of work handled in the principal departments of the banks, except in the currency and coin departments.

Five of the reserve banks—New York, Philadelphia, Atlanta, Minneapolis, and Dallas—reported sufficient net earnings to pay accrued dividends in full, the remaining seven banks paying their dividends entirely or in part out of surplus. The surplus of the 12 Federal reserve banks combined after the closing of the books at the end of the year amounted to $274,636,000, a net reduction for the year of $2,298,000, although the New York, Philadelphia, Minneapolis, and Dallas banks made some additions to their individual surplus accounts, the latter two paying small franchise taxes. The total subscribed capital of the Federal reserve banks at the end of 1930 amounted to $339,280,000, against $341,951,000 a year before.

On January 2, 1930, a site was purchased for a new building for the Pittsburgh branch, and on April 14 the President signed a joint resolution of Congress authorizing an expenditure of $875,000 for the construction of the building proper, exclusive of the cost of the vaults, permanent equipment, furnishings, and fixtures. Ground was broken for the erection of the building on November 1, 1930. During the year a site adjoining the Philadelphia building was purchased to provide for future expansion, and construction of an addition to the Kichmond building was under way at the end of the year. BRANCHES AND AGENCIES OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE BANKS The 25 branches and 2 agencies of the Federal reserve banks which were in operation at the end of 1929 continued to function throughout 1930. As was the case for the system as a whole, the volume of work handled by the branches and agencies in their principal operating departments fell off somewhat in 1930.

CHANGES IN MEMBERSHIP During 1930 the number of member banks declined from 8,522 to 8,052, or by 470. Membership at the end of 1930 included 1,019 State banks, which was 100 less than a year earlier, and 7,033 national banks, which represented a decrease of 370 for the year. As in other recent years, the decline in the number of member banks resulted largely from mergers between member banks, suspensions, and absorptions by nonmember banks. Additions to membership during the year include 33 newly organized national banks, as compared with 71 in 1929, 35 nonmember State banks which converted into national banks, and 18 State banks admitted to membership with State charters. There were also 7 member banks which, having previously suspended operations, reopened during the year. The total of 93 banks added to membership during the year does not, however, include 165 nonmember banks that were absorbed by member banks during the year, although the assets of member banks were increased thereby. The number of nonmembers absorbed the year before was 77. Mergers between member banks account for a decrease of 199 in the number of such banks in 1930, as compared with a decrease of 171 in 1929. Suspensions account for a loss of 185 in the number of member banks, as compared with 82 in 1929. A total of 134 member banks were lost to membership through conversion into or absorption by nonmember banks; there were 39 voluntary withdrawals of State banks from membership, 2 compulsory withdrawals, and 4 instances in which the existence of member banks was terminated through voluntary liquidation. In the following table changes in membership for the year 1930 are summarized, by class of member bank: 17 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE FEDERAL, RESERVE BOARD CHANGES IN THE NUMBER OF NATIONAL AND STATE BANK MEMBERS DURING AND 1929 1930 Procedure effecting change National Active member banks at beginning of year Additions to membership: Organization of national bank Conversion of nonmember bank to national Admission of State bank Resumption following suspension Conversion within the system.

BANK EXAMINATIONS The board, through its division of examination, conducted at least one examination of each Federal reserve bank during the year; two of the reserve banks were examined twice. One banking corporation operating under provisions of section 25 (a) of the Federal reserve act, generally referred to as the Edge Act, providing for banking corporations authorized to do foreign banking business, was examined during the year. Two banking corporations operating under an agreement with the board, as provided for in section 25, were also examined during the year. BANK SUSPENSIONS There were 1,345 bank suspensions in 1930, a larger number than in any other year. Deposit liabilities of suspended banks were $865,000,000, compared with $272,000,000, the highest previous figure, which was recorded in 1926. The figures of deposits in failed banks are not a measure of the amount of deposits lost by depositors, as they do not take account of amounts received by them from time to time from the receivers in charge of the liquidation of the suspended banks. Of the 1,345 banks suspended during the year 1930, 187 were members of the Federal reserve system and 1,158 were nonmember 18 ANNUAL KEPOET OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD banks. Banks reopened in 1930 numbered 147, with deposits of $61,599,000. The following table shows for 1930 the number and deposits of the banks that suspended operations in selected States. The largest number of failures during the year occurred in Arkansas, Illinois, and Missouri.

In the past year, however, some large institutions closed their doors, one having as much as $160,000,000 in deposit liabilities and two others of $38,000,000 and $35,000,000, respectively, with the consequence that average deposits of suspended banks were $640,000 in 1930, compared with $300,000 for the preceding nine years. BRANCH AND GROUP BANKING During the first six months of 1930, while the aggregate number of banks in the United States decreased, there was an increase in the number of banks in chains or groups, as well as the number of branch offices. On June 30, 1930, the number of banks in the United States was smaller by 5,144 than six years earlier, but the number of branches had increased by 1,325, so that the decrease in the total number of banking offices was 3,819. During the first six months of 1930 there was a decrease of 778 in the number of banks and an increase of 71 in the number of branches. The group of 22 States in which the establishment of branches is now prohibited lost 3,051 banking offices, nearly one-fifth of those in existence at the beginning of the 6-year period. In the area where state-wide branch banking is permitted, banking offices decreased by 287, or about one-twelfth, reflecting a decrease of 760 banks, offset in part by an increase of 473 in branches. On the other hand, the group of States in which branches are restricted as to location showed a net increase in banking offices of 262, resulting from an increase of ANNUAL BEPOBT OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD 19 860 branches, offset in part by a decrease of 598 in the number of banks. The increase in branch offices during the first six months of 1930 occurred chiefly in the home city or county, 43 of the increase of 71 being of this class. The comparatively restricted nature of branchbanking developments from a geographical point of view is reflected in the fact that of the 3,618 branch offices in the country on June 30, 1930, only 720 were located outside of the home-office city or county, of which 451 were in California, 58 in South Carolina, and 46 in North Carolina. Twenty-five large banks in seven cities—New York, Detroit, Los Angeles, Cleveland, Boston, Buffalo, and New Orleans—each having 18 or more branches and all confining their branch activity to the city, had among them nearly 1,000 branches, and of the nearly 900 branches operated by 16 large systems whose branch activities were not so limited, more than one-fourth were within the home-office city. On June 30, 1930, there were 817 banks operating branches, 5 less than six months earlier. Decreases in branch systems resulted from 20 mergers, 12 suspensions, and in 7 cases the discontinuance of branches, offset in part by 32 new branch systems and the reopening of 2 systems following suspension. The increase of 71 branch offices resulted from the conversion of 62 banks into branches, the establishment of 89 branches de novo, and 2 resumptions following suspension—while 60 branch offices were discontinued and 22 were closed with suspension of the parent bank. At the end of June, 1930, branches were in operation in 30 States and the District of Columbia—1,308 in the 9 States and the District of Columbia which permit state-wide branch banking; 2,257 in the 12 States which restrict the establishment of branches to the home city of the parent bank or territory nearly contiguous thereto; 52 in 8 States in which the further extension of branch banking is prohibited by State law; and 1 in the State of New Hampshire, where there is no provision in State law regarding branch banking. Two-thirds of the 3,618 branches in operation in June were located in 5 States—California, New York, Michigan, Ohio, and Pennsylvania—while more than 100 branches were in operation in each of 4 other States—Massachusetts, New Jersey, Louisiana, and Maryland. A large majority of the banks operating branches in June were operating only one or two branches each. Of the 817 banks operating branches, 443, or more than one-half, were operating only 1 branch each, 144 were operating 2, and 132 were operating 3 to 5. Of the 817 banks operating branches on June 30, 1930, 165 were national banks with 1,041 branches, 169 were State member banks 20 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD with 1,308 branches, and 483 were nonmember State banks with 1,269 branches. The group * banking movement gained 79 constituent banks during the first six months of 1930, of which 53 banks were in new groups and 127 were added to old groups. Partly offsetting these increases, groups lost 30 banks because of mergers, 24 because of suspensions, and 47 because of withdrawals, dissolutions, etc. The 2,144 constituent banks reported for June 30, 1930, belonged to 289 different group systems, there being one more group than at the end of 1929. Although 12 new groups were formed during the 6-month period, suspensions, mergers, etc., accounted for the disappearance of 11 groups. While group-banking developments have not been generally restricted by provisions in State banking codes, the area within which these developments have been more considerable in extent is composed largely of States which have prohibited the establishment of branch-banking offices either by statute or by administrative policy, as, for example, in Minnesota, North Dakota, Kansas, Iowa, Illinois, Oklahoma, and Texas. Developments of this character, however, have by no means been restricted to these States, as groups have shown very considerable developments elsewhere, particularly in several of the States—Michigan and New York, for example—which have restricted the development of branch banking to the building up of home-city or local branch systems, and in California, which permits state-wide branch banking. There were, in fact, few States in which no affiliation of banking institutions in group systems was reported in June, 1930, and the group-banking area is in general much more extensive and less clearly defined than the branchbanking area. 1 The word \" group \" is used to include chains as well. Three types of chain or group systems have been reported, which may be characterized with reference to the controlling agency, as follows: (1) Instances where control is exercised by a holding corporation, which has usually been formed by interests connected with one or more of the principal banks belonging to the system. (2) Instances where control is exercised by the principal bank of the system, either through direct ownership of stock by the bank or through ownership by the stockholders or directors of the bank. (3) Instances of ownership of controlling or substantial interest in a number of banks by an individual, family, or group of individuals. Recent developments have been conspicuously of the first and second types, and these developments, commonly utilizing holding companies as controlling agencies, have been distinguished in some discussions as \" group systems,\" the designation of \" chain systenr \" being reserved for organizations of the third type. These classifications by types of control are, however, very general, since the actual method and agency of control varies from system to system and may in the case of any given system be modified from time to time. In the board's compilations, only affiliations of 3 or more banks are classified as chain or group systems. It follows that some single banks classified as independent unit banks may be affiliated through stock ownership with other single banks. ANNUAL REPORT OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD 21 During the six months' period the group movement showed a gain of 12 banks in Illinois, 9 in Wisconsin, and 8 in Florida (3 States in which branches are prohibited by law), and of 11 banks in Tennessee and 7 in Ohio (2 States in which branches are restricted as to location). In Iowa there were 14 fewer banks members of chains and groups than six months earlier. Several of the large group systems in operation in June included one or more banks operating branches, and while in some instances all of the banking offices of the group were located within the confines of a single State, in other instances they were located in several States. Forty-four important groups, none with less than 6 banks, had among them 902 of the total number of 2,144 banks associated with groups in the country as a whole. In addition, the members of these large groups had 1,037 branches in all, of which 621 were in the home-office city. One large group in the Northwest had as many as 108 members, another in the Northwest 100, while an important group with its head office in New York City, operating chiefly in California, reported 22 bank members having 475 branches. BANK MERGERS Mergers affecting members of the Federal reserve system, which were numerous in 1929, were still more numerous in 1930. The merger movement and bank suspensions taken together have served to reduce the total number of banks in the United States by almost 5,000 in a 5-year period ending with June 30, 1930, wkile banking resources were increasing by $12,000,000,000 to a total of $74,000,000,000. During these five years, therefore, the average size of banks, as measured by total resources, increased from $2,152,000 to $3,074,000. During the past five years there have been over 1,400 mergers involving members of the Federal reserve system. The accompanying table brings out the fact that during the 5-year period the national system lost to the State systems 419 banks, while gaining through mergers 310 banks. In the year 1929 the national system suffered numerous defections, some of which were associated with unfavorable feeling toward national charters that arose from a court decision concerning the continuity of fiduciary powers of national banks. That this feeling has in part lost its force is reflected in the fact that in the year 1930, for the first time in recent years, the national system gained through mergers more banks than it lost through mergers. During the year 1930 more outside banks were absorbed by member banks than were lost to the Federal reserve system by merger with nonmember institutions, although in the 5-year period the net movement in this connection was in the opposite direction. 22 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD MERGERS AFFECTING MEMBER BANKS, 1926-1930 Number of banks absorbed by mergers Type of merger 1926 Total National bank absorbed through merger: Total With national bank > -.

National bank absorbed by merger with State bank State bank absorbed by merger with national bank BANKS ON PAR LIST At the end of 1930 there were 22,445 incorporated banks other than mutual savings banks in the United States. Of this number, 19,008, or 84.7 per cent, were on the Federal reserve par list, which comprises all member banks and such nonmember banks as have agreed to pay, without deduction of exchange charges, such checks drawn upon them as are presented or forwarded for payment by the Federal reserve banks. During the year the number of nonmember banks decreased by 1,406, the number on the par list by 1,089, and the number not on the par list by 317. Of the 3,437 banks not on the par list at the end of 1930, 1,874 were located in the Southern and 1,463 in the North Central States. As will be seen from the following table, all of the banks in the Boston, New York, and Philadelphia districts and all but nine in the Cleveland district were on the Federal reserve par list: A N N U A L REPORT OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD 23 MEMBERS HIP I N P A B COLLECTION SYSTEM * [Number of banks at end of December] Member banks On par list Federal reserve district 1930 United States Federal reserve district: Boston New York Philadelphia Cleveland Rip.hmnnri Atlanta Chicago St. Louis Minneapolis Kansas City Dallas San Francisco 1 Nonmember banks . - Not on par list 1929 1930 1929 1930 1929 8,052 8,522 10,956 12,045 3,437 3,754 396 914 753 757 470 390 1,081 513 642 871 684 581 404 931 764 795 514 428 1,186 571 683 893 746 607 260 395 451 936 523 186 3,200 1,404 497 1,917 572 615 271 404 476 991 577 254 3,485 1,670 582 2,096 605 634 9 441 862 238 417 1,007 191 211 61 9 546 926 229 477 1,101 197 207 62 Incorporated banks other than mutual savings banks. TRUST ACTIVITIES OF NATIONAL BANKS The Federal Keserve Board in 1930 approved 111 original and 21 supplementary applications by national banks for permission to exercise fiduciary powers under the provisions of section 11 (k) of the Federal reserve act. Since the first fiduciary permit was granted by the Federal Reserve Board to a national bank on February 25, 1915, continuous growth has been shown each year until, at the close of 1930, 2,465 of these institutions had authority to administer trusts. A list of national banks holding permits to exercise trust powers on December 31,1930, will be found on pages 313-337. CHANGES I N THE BOARD'S REGULATIONS During the year 1930 the provisions of the board's regulations were amended in a number of particulars. Some of these changes were made in order to bring the terms of the regulations into conformity with the provisions of recent amendments to the law, while other amendments were adopted because experience had proven them to be necessary or desirable. Regulation A—Discounts under sections 13 and 13 (a).—The board adopted a number of amendments to its Regulation A with regard to rediscounts by Federal reserve banks, in order to make the provisions of the regulation conform to the following recent amendments to the law: (1) The act of May 29, 1928, which authorized the rediscount of sight drafts when drawn to cover the shipment of nonagricultural, nonperishable, readily marketable staples, as well as nonperishable, readily marketable staple agricultural products, and when 33454—31 3 24 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD drawn to finance the exportation of such staples as well as the domestic shipment thereof; (2) the act of June 17, 1929, authorizing the Secretary of the Treasury to issue Treasury bills and providing that the words \" bonds and notes of the United States \" and similar phrases as used in the Federal reserve act shall be held to include certificates of indebtedness and Treasury bills; (3) the act of April 12, 1930, which amended the law so as to make the limitations upon the amount of eligible paper of one borrower which may be rediscounted by a Federal reserve bank for a member bank conform to the limitations of section 5200 of the Revised Statutes as to the amount which a national bank may lend to a single borrower. Regulation D—Reserves of member banks.—This regulation was amended so as to provide that in computing penalties for deficiencies in reserves the required reserve balance of each member bank at the close of business each day shall be based upon its net deposit balances at the opening of business, instead of the close of business, on the same day. No change, however, was made in the existing practice of computing such deficiencies on the basis of average daily net deposit balances covering semiweekly, weekly, or semimonthly periods. Regulation F—Trust powers of national banks.—Pursuant to the act of June 26, 1930, providing for the voluntary surrender of fiduciary powers by national banks, the board amended its Regulation F so as to outline the steps which should be taken by a national bank desiring to give up its trust powers and setting forth the requirements of the board before granting a certificate to the bank certifying that it is no longer authorized to exercise such powerso Regulation H—Membership of State banks and trust companies.— Pursuant to the act of April 17, 1930, providing for the waiving by the Federal Reserve Board of the six months' notice prescribed for State banks voluntarily withdrawing from the Federal reserve system, the board amended its Regulation H by adding a new section on the subject of voluntary withdrawals of State member banks. This amendment consists principally of a paraphrase of the relevant provisions of the law as amended and a statement of the procedure to be followed in cases of voluntary withdrawal of State member banks including cases where the six months' notice is waived. Regulation I—Federal reserve bank stock.—The board amended its Regulation I so as to prescribe a procedure to be followed in cases arising under the act of Congress of April 23, 1930, which authorized the Comptroller of the Currency to appoint a receiver for a national bank which has discontinued banking operations for 60 days without going into liquidation and for which a receiver has not already been appointed, and which also authorized the Fed ANNUAL KEPORT OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD 25 eral Eeserve Board to forfeit the membership of a State member bank which has ceased to exercise banking functions without a receiver or liquidating agent having been appointed. Regulation I was also amended so as to clarify the question as to the amount of Federal reserve bank stock to which a member bank is entitled in a case where it has first reduced its surplus but subsequently has increased it. Regulation J—Check clearing and collection.—The board adopted a number of amendments modifying or clarifying the provisions of its Regulation J with regard to the collection of checks by Federal reserve banks, the more important changes being in that section of the regulation which prescribes the terms upon which Federal reserve banks will receive and handle such checks for collection. Regulation K—Banking corporations authorized to do foreign hanking business.—The board amended its Regulation K with respect to the requirements as to titles of corporations organized to do a foreign banking business under the terms of section 25 (a) of the Federal reserve act. The regulation prior to the amendment required that the title of every such corporation include the word \" foreign \" or the word \" international\" and should not include the word \" bank.\" As amended, however, an exception is made to this require* ment by providing that with the permission of the Federal Reserve Board a corporation which is closely affiliated with a bank and which is organized or operated for the purpose of transacting the foreign banking business of such bank may include the word \" bank \" in its corporate title and need not include the word \" foreign \" or the word \" international.\" Regulation L—Interlocking bank directorates under the Clayton Act.—This regulation was amended so as to bring its provisions into conformity with the act of March 2,1929, exempting from the provisions of the Clayton Act joint-stock land banks and other banking institutions which do no commercial banking business. The complete text of the Federal Reserve Board's Regulations A to L, as they existed on December 31, 1930, will be found on pageg 232-272. AMENDMENTS TO THE FEDERAL RESERVE ACT Amendments to a number of the provisions of the Federal reserve act were enacted during the year 1930. Limitations upon rediscounts for one borrower.—By act of Congress approved April 12, 1930, section 13 of the Federal reserve act was amended so as to make the limitations therein on the amount of eligible paper of any one borrower which may be rediscounted by a Federal reserve bank for a member bank conform to the limita* tions of section 5200 of the Revised Statutes as amended with regard to the amount which a national bank may lend to a single borrower. 26 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD Waiver of notice of withdrawal,—By act of Congress approved April 17, 1930, section 9 of the Federal reserve act was amended so as to authorize the Federal Reserve Board, in its discretion and subject to such conditions as it may prescribe, in individual cases to Waive the six months' notice prescribed for State member banks withdrawing from the Federal reserve system and to permit any such bank to withdraw from membership prior to the expiration of six months from the date of such notice. Banks which have discontinued operations.—By act of Congress approved April 23, 1930, section 6 of the Federal reserve act was amended so as to authorize the Comptroller of the Currency to appoint a receiver for a national bank which has discontinued its banking operations for 60 days, but which has not gone into liquidation and for which a receiver has not already been appointed for other lawful cause; and it is further provided that the stock held by the national bank in the Federal reserve bank shall thereupon be canceled and proper refund made. By the same act of Congress section 9 of the Federal reserve act was amended so as to authorize the Federal Eeserve Board, after hearing, to forfeit the membership of a State member bank of the Federal reserve system which has ceased to exercise banking functions without a receiver or liquidating agent having been appointed therefor. Costs of examination of member banks.—By act of Congress approved June 26, 1930, section 9 of the Federal reserve act and section 5240 of the United States Revised Statutes, as amended by section 21 of the Federal reserve act, were amended so as to enable the Federal Reserve Board in its discretion to decide whether the costs of examinations of member banks of the Federal reserve system made by the Federal Reserve Board or by the Federal reserve banks should be assessed against the banks examined. The previous law had required that the costs of all such examinations be assessed against the banks examined. It is also provided under the law as amended that copies of reports of examinations of State member banks may, in the discretion of the Federal Reserve Board, be furnished to the State banking authorities. Yolimtary surrender of trust powers.—By act of Congress approved June 26, 1930, a procedure is provided whereby a national bank which has been authorized to exercise fiduciary powers, pursuant to the provisions of section 11 (k) of the Federal reserve act, may surrender those powers if it so desires, in order to relieve itself from the necessity for a further compliance with the requirements of that section or to have returned to it any securities which it may have deposited with the State authorities for the protection of private or court trusts or for any other purpose. Under the law as amended, when a national bank has signified to the Federal Reserve ANNUAL KEPOET OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD 27 Board a desire to surrender its trust powers the board is authorized in its discretion to issue a certificate that the bank no longer has authority to exercise fiduciary powers, and it is specifically provided that upon the issuance of this certificate the bank is entitled, among other things, to have returned to it any securities which it may have deposited with the State authorities for the protection of private or court trusts. Election of Federal reserve hank directors.—By act of Congress approved June 26, 1930, that part of section 4 of the Federal reserve act providing the method of counting ballots in elections of Class A and Class B directors of Federal reserve banks was amended so as to clarify the meaning of the phrase \" electors voting \" appearing in the statute. Under the previously existing law it was provided that member banks voting in elections of Class A and Class B directors shall indicate their first, second, and other choices, and if no candidate have a majority of first-choice votes the secondchoice votes shall be added to the first-choice votes, and if any candidate then have a majority of the \" electors voting \" he shall be declared elected; if not, votes for first, second, and other choices shall be added together and the candidate then having the highest number of votes shall be declared elected. In a case where pursuant to the statute it had become necessary to add together the first-choice and second-choice votes and as a result several candidates had a majority of \"electors voting,\" serious doubt arose on the question whether that candidate having the highest number of first and second choice votes combined should be declared elected or whether in such case votes for first, second, and other choices should be added together and the candidate then having the highest number of votes declared elected. To eliminate this doubt, the statute was amended so as to provide that when first and second choice votes have been added together the candidate then having a \" majority ofl the electors voting and the highest number of combined votes\" shall be declared elected; if no candidate then have a majority of electors voting and the highest number of combined votes, third-choice votes shall be added in, as provided under the law previously. ADMINISTRATION OF THE CLAYTON ACT Pursuant to the provisions of section 8 of the Clayton Antitrust Act, during the year 1930 applications for permits authorizing interlocking bank directorates numbering 416 were received and considered by the Federal Eeserve Board. The board also investigated 100 alleged violations of this law which were reported to it 28 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD by the Comptroller of the Currency, and required the bank directors involved to comply with the law where it was being violated. MEETINGS OF FEDERAL ADVISORY COUNCIL Four meetings of the Federal advisory council were held in Washington during 1930 on the following dates: February 18, May 20, September 16, and November 18. CONFERENCES HELD BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD The Federal Eeserve Board, as usual, conferred with the Federal advisory council on the occasion of its meetings during the year. The governors of the Federal reserve banks and the Federal reserve agents met in Washington on September 24-25 and conferred separately and jointly. At both conferences special sessions were held at which the board was in attendance. ORGANIZATION, STAFF, AND EXPENDITURES Roy A. Young, who had held the office of governor of the Federal Reserve Board since October 4, 1927, resigned on September 1, 1930, and on September 2 became governor of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston. Edmund Platt, who had been a member of the Federal Reserve Board since June 8, 1920, and its vice governor since July 23, 1920, resigned on September 15, 1930. On September 16,1930, Eugene Meyer, of New York, was appointed a member of the Federal Reserve Board to fill the vacancy created by the resignation of Vice Governor Platt, and was designated as governor of the board. Edward H. Cunningham, a member of the Federal Reserve Board since May 14, 1923, died on November 28, 1930. The total cost of conducting the work of the board during the year 1930 was $778,759.94.
