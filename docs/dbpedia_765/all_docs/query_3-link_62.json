The Hospitallers sort of still exist ...\n\nIt is possible that the CdS route is simply one of the key routes for Templars travelling to/from Egypt via Morocco, Portugal, SdC, on to France, etc.\n\nNot really -- and not sure where the \"under cover\" comes from !!\n\nThe Templars did have a stronger presence on the Way to Jerusalem, and on some of the various Ways in France.\n\nCrosbie\n\nMember\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\n2nd Sept 2023\n\nAug 14, 2023\n\n#4\n\nThe Hospitallers did set up many pilgrim hospitals on the Camino Francès, as well as seeking to provide protection for pilgrims ;\n\nThanks. Very interesting to know that the Hospitaliers did provide refuges/stations along the route.\n\nI'd suggest that Templars tended to travel incognito, e.g. as pilgrims. And that the 'hospitals' may also have been presented as altruistic/religious missions, but were precisely intended to protect the former.\n\nCrosbie\n\nMember\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\n2nd Sept 2023\n\nAug 14, 2023\n\n#5\n\nin Jerusalem\n\nYou do realise that the Templars are so called because they were established as guardians of Solomon's Temple - located somewhere around that neck of the woods - not necessarily the place that is called 'Jerusalem' today.\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\nTo Santiago and back. Le Puy to Aumont-Aubrac.\n\nAug 14, 2023\n\n#6\n\nWell, welcome to the forum, @Crosbie. New input for a stimulating discussion is always welcome. I am trying to wrap my head around your suggestion. Do I get this right: The Templars travelled incognito and disguised as pilgrims from France and Germany over the Pyrenees to Santiago and from there through Portugal, over the Strait of Gibraltar to Morocco, Algeria, Tunesia, and Libya, to Egypt and I guess then to Jerusalem? In the 10th and 11th century when pilgrimages in Europe blossomed and were in full swing?\n\nHow very interesting.\n\nMy first question would be: Where did they hid their swords and their knight's armors? In their pilgrim's satchels? Horses - I guess they did not hide them? They were pilgrims on horseback?\n\nMy second question would be: Why did they not join their comrade knights who travelled on ships from Italy to the Holy Land or on land through the Balkans as everybody else did?\n\nAnd my third question - probably unanswerable because it is all hidden but: I guess at one point along this long journey they changed from Christian pilgrims to Muslim pilgrims, right?

In their pilgrim's satchels? Horses - I guess they did not hide them? They were pilgrims on horseback?\n\nOn foot, they'd no doubt be lightly armed, but highly trained in the martial arts of those times.\n\nMy second question would be: Why did they not join their comrade knights who travelled on ships from Italy to the Holy Land or on land through the Balkans as everybody else did?\n\nThe Hospitaliers/Templiers needed a network that would permeate Europe, and thus via multiple routes.\n\nAnd my third question - probably unanswerable because it is all hidden but: I guess at one point along this long journey they changed from Christian pilgrims to Muslim pilgrims, right? Because otherwise ... would the Muslim rulers in Iberia and North Africa have allowed them to travel through their empire?\n\nOne need not necessarily be overtly religious to be a pilgrim, but of course, mere pilgrims would not draw attention to themselves, by appearing out of place.\n\nAs to 'rulers', it is probable these were co-opted (if not established) by the Templars.\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\nTo Santiago and back.

I nearly did not click on the link, based on your description. Glad I did. It is a good overview, written in an entertaining style and only 10 pages. Recommended for anyone with a serious interest who wants to freshen up their knowledge.\n\nFor the same reason, I read through The Templars in France: Between History, Heritage, and Memory, 37 pages, today. There is a general introduction which starts with the words \"the Templars continue to fascinate [...] yet fiction has largely gained an upper hand over the historical reality\". This started already in 1805 but snowballed in recent decades. The author also recognises that \"as historians, we may easily be annoyed by this Templar mania, by the endless collection of absurdities that it often conveys\".\n\nBut he also says that on the one hand, contemporary historians are reluctant to study the Templars, distanced by an entire body of esoteric literature whose 'fantasy is not even good quality fantasy.' On the other hand, the general public, unfamiliar with recent research and sometimes fearing that scholarship embodies an ‘official’ history that they consider biased, continues to give credence to works by storytellers and charlatans – who willingly deal with the subject of the Temple, but through the prism of secrecy, mystery and looking for who knows what kind of lost treasure.\n\nI find it a pity. Because the actual history, what we can glance of the life and mindset of those people who lived so long ago, and how we know about it and how we can learn more about, is more interesting than all this made up secrecy stuff.

The Templars were to protect pilgrims going to the Holy Lands...and to do this they had to make themselves known, and that is also how they attracted others to join. Keep in mind, they were knights, not mere foot soldiers (but they needed to have them join up). Also, the Hospitallers and the Templars had different goals and callings, and reported to different parties...and... most importantly, competed with one another for funding, basically.\n\nTraveling incognito would not have made too much sense in that period. The idea of the Templar being incognito comes about when the order destroyed/outlawed/oppressed...then some of the knights not captured are thought to have gone underground.\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\nTo Santiago and back.

It would be nice if you could tell us. The name Templars is generally believed to be derived from the fact that they protected the so-called Temple Mount, presumed site of Solomon´s Temple. They were established in 1119 (a precise date and not the vague 9th, or circa 10th) and were initially stationed in the Al Aqsa mosque. The First Crusade had captured Jerusalem from the Fatimid Caliphate in 1099. It is highly unlikely that prior to then, the Fatimid caliphate would have tolerated the presence of a bunch of Christian knights attempting to defend the Temple of Solomon and its environs and even less likely that local bandits and warlords would have. The establishment of the order is a matter of established historical record. The Templars emphatically did not create the trade routes across the north of Spain, even if they used them - in fact, they probably did, everyone else did. The Templars were not the ´original pilgrims´. Christian pilgrimage dates back to Classical times (well before the 9th century). There was absolutely nothing to stop any member of the order climbing on his horse and going where he wanted, with or without his armour and weapons, no questions asked, just another bloke on a horse. Their power was based on wealth, as was the power of the monasteries. They did not have to do anything clandestine to acquire or protect this wealth, they were the recipients of vast charitable bequests and patronage and the beneficiaries of some very clever financial instruments and accounting procedure. The Templars were about money, lots of it. And it was ultimately money that destroyed them - Philip IV of France owed them money and couldn´t pay so he got them disbanded.\n\nAnyone passing through Santiago on the way to North Africa or the Near East is lost.\n\nMedieval history is actually very interesting if you focus on the real life of real people. Their technology and mathematical expertise were impressive as were their accomplishments in building, metalwork and mechanics e.g. inventing the clock in the 14th century. They had extensive trade and communications networks and highly organised societies capable of huge projects of engineering and logistics - just take a look at the inside of a Romanesque cathedral and try to figure out how they managed to shape and move those stones around or look at a suit of armour and think about the ability to forge and work steel needed to make it.

And not a garrison where knights in armour were galloping about and going on daily patrol up and down the Camino?\n\nI had a look at the map for Al-Andalus. When the Templar order received the Ponferrada site as a donation in 1178, the border with the Muslim part of Spain was already far away to the south; surely there was no need for military protection from a potential aggressor in the Ponferrada area?\n\nView attachment 154697\n\nThe Templars reworked the vast gold mining area south of Ponferrada at Las Medulas, once the largest in the Roman Empire. Many sources claim that at the beginning of the 12th century, the Templar knights took possession of the fortress and reinforced and extended it to use it as an inhabitable palace and for protection, on the route of the pilgrims on the way to Santiago de Compostela.\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\nTo Santiago and back.

Or is that yet another myth of Templars and their gold?\n\nThe period of Roman mining that is usually given varies between 100 years and 250 years. The Unesco World heritage site says that there was no subsequent industrial activity. Apparently an environmental disaster at the time but a great place to visit today! Of potential interest for peregrin@s on the Camino Francés and the Camino de Invierno.\n\nIn the 1st century A.D. the Roman Imperial authorities began to exploit the gold deposits of this region in north-west Spain, using a technique based on hydraulic power. After two centuries of working the deposits, the Romans withdrew, leaving a devastated landscape. Since there was no subsequent industrial activity, the dramatic traces of this remarkable ancient technology are visible everywhere as sheer faces in the mountainsides and the vast areas of tailings, now used for agriculture.​\n\nLast edited: Aug 17, 2023\n\nDavid61\n\nActive Member\n\nAug 19, 2023\n\n#53\n\nMr Dick Bird, you made me laugh. \"they had a very visible profile until they got the King of France offside.\"\n\nVirtually all Templars (within reach) were arrested on the same day which is why Friday 13th is considered unlucky.

Pick a quote from somewhere, interpret it in a specific way, and voilà, you have proven your point. Wait for a rebuttal and start your game moves again. I am rarely playing though these days and try to distance myself from these forum games.\n\nFor example, the quote you have chosen is in a paragraph that starts with these words (translated from French): The first half of the 12th century saw an increase in the number of pilgrimages, which was part of a wider expansion in trade and communications.\n\nI did not know for a long time, because context is rarely provided in many narratives, that this period in time was a time of great social and economic change. Agriculture became more productive due to technological advances which lead to a rapid increase of the population in Europe, greater wealth was generated, and subsequently urban centres started to appear and to develop. It is not surprising then, isn't it, that there was a wider expansion in trade and communications. Nothing to do with any military-monk orders. At best, they were the result of this development and not the cause.\n\nAt a later time - too lazy to look it up - the sea routes became safer because the attacks from Vikings ceased.

A bit like taking the methods of a cobbler of finding out what's wrong with a shoe and how to repair it and use these methods and tools to find out what's wrong with your computer software and how to repair it. You'll get a result, no doubt, when you work on your computer with a hammer, an awl and some spare leather but I bet it will be rubbish.\n\nI had never heard of the two authors of Hamlet's Mill before and I knew Tolkien only as the author of Lord of the Rings and the Silmarillion. Reading a bit up on them, I understand that they deal with the mythologies of ancient peoples - creation myths, story of supernatural beings, the belief system of a whole society.\n\nThis is not related in any way to the contemporary fantasy stories about the Templars that have been concocted by small groups of individuals in the 20th century about historical events merely a few hundred years ago during a period of time where there is plenty of written documentation left. Which, as I have said, is often more fascinating but of course not as exciting to read as the make belief contemporary Templar books and Templar movies and Templar websites.\n\nDe Santillana, von Dechend and Tolkien don't live anymore. What would they say if they knew that their name and their writing and books are used in attempts to provide some Templar fantasy stories with a fig leaf of authority?

Similar projects continued through the next generations of academics, with emphasis turning from mythology to sociology during the 1970s-1990s. The late French philosopher Bruno Latour was generally among this school but in 2003 shocked academics by embracing the reality of empirical evidence. He was confronted with the excesses of some of the field’s scholars – the explosion of the US Challenger rocket, I believe, while guest lecturing at Harvard was a main impetus (he could not embrace that the explosion of a rocket was simply a social construct) – and he spent the rest of his career moving toward collaboration with empiricists and scientists.\n\nBruno Latour, 75, Philosopher on the Social Basis of Scientific Facts, Dies\n\nA leading thinker of the postwar era, he became an ally of the science establishment in the face of attacks by climate deniers and conspiracy theorists.\n\nA long way of saying: I agree 100% Kathar1na. I don’t know what they would think. I would have to guess they’d fall closer to Bruno Latour after his latter-life turn, were they alive today.

And not everyone can be a Renaissance woman or man these days and be highly educated and highly trained in every area of today's vast human knowledge. That is why we have experts who can tell whether a document is faked on material grounds (paper quality, age, ink, etc etc) or on content grounds because they know context and can put it in context. Of course anyone else, me included, can have opinions. Needless to say scientific and scholarly dispute is normal - that is how we humans have increased our knowledge.\n\nThere is one post (#25) that peeked my interest. The poster mentions the podcast “The Scolarly Pilgrim” and says that \"[the Templars'] issue of the equivalent to letters of credit to allow pilgrims obtain services on the route without having to carry coins or precious objects was a revelation\". I had been aware of their role as bankers to the kings of European countries but not really aware of a similar role for pilgrims. I got curious.\n\nI don't think that they were the equivalent of our ATMs today . But they did play a role in providing financial services to pilgrims, especially those travelling to Jerusalem in the 13th century (1200-1300). I looked for info on Santiago pilgrims in particular and found two names of such pilgrims. One was a Parisian with the name of Pierre Sarrasin. I managed to find the actual contract between him and the Templar organisation. Alas, it is in Latin and no complete translation into French, German, English or Spanish is online. It will be a struggle again but I am determined to read the original source and not rely on short quotes in books. What made it difficult to track down the original document is the fact that various authors use different spellings of his name including for his first name - Pierre, Pedro, Peter even, and in the Latin document he calls himself \"ego, Petrus Sarracenus\".\n\nI had not bookmarked anything earlier and when I started googling again yesterday for his name (which I could barely remember) one of the Google hits led me to a 19th century book where the contract appeared to be mentioned as it had been offered for sale to a collector. The author said it was faked and he could easily recognise the fakery. I had a near heart attack - all this searching in vane and I would have made a fool of myself had I proudly posted my find on the forum. Luckily, it turned out that even I could have seen that it was a fake. The 19th century fraudster had copied the original 13th century contract word by word but had replaced the name of Petrus Sarracenus with the name of another person - in fact an ancestor of the person to whom he was planning to sell I think.\n\nYes, fraudsters are plentiful in this business as well as in the whole history of European pilgrimage including the pilgrimage to Santiago.\n\nLast edited: Aug 22, 2023\n\nWalkalong\n\nActive Member\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\nPortuguese 2020, 22, 23\n\nFrances 2019, 20, 22, 23\n\nAug 22, 2023\n\n#77\n\nInteresting story on the Smithonian's website about the review for a book about the history of cod fishing.

Even if the road to Jerusalem was already heavily used before 1098, the first crusade opened the doors of the Holy Land to new flows of pilgrims. Attested since the 9th century, the rise of the pilgrimage to Compostela is exactly contemporary with the birth of the two great military orders in the Holy Land, since it was in the years 1100-1120 that Archbishop Diego Gelmirez gave it a definitive impetus. The influx of pilgrims was then such that it led to the writing of an exceptional work, around 1130, the Pilgrim's Guide to Saint Jacques. Since the invention of the relics of the apostle, around 830,\n\nThat is a pretty good answer to my original question.\n\nThe desecration of Solomon's Temple occurred just before 'the invention of the relics of the apostle, around 830', and these relics were no doubt some of the damaged remains, especially of the Ark of the Covenant.\n\nThe proto-Templars, upon news of the desecration, would immediately respond with a military force to bring a halt to that desecration - ideally also remedying it as far as possible.\n\nThat occupying force would consume resources, and spur the indigenous (the desecrators) to form a counter-offensive. Eventually, the Templars would need to mobilise considerable defensive reinforcements, which is what gave rise to the crusades.\n\nThroughout this period, the communications network (pilgrimage routes) would be ever more heavily used, especially in support of those travelling to join the crusades.\n\nNB 'Jerusalem' is 'The Holy Land'. The Holy Land is Holy precisely because of The Holy of Holies within Solomon's Temple (which contained the Ark of The Covenant).\n\nSo, the pilgrimage routes to/from The Holy Land via Santiago (St. John/Jean/Jack/Jacques/Jacob/Iacobi/Iago - the Apostle - Eagle/Scorpio) may have existed in vaguer form prior to the 9th century, but will have been greatly consolidated and re-inforced (commanderies) as a consequence of the crusades, and would have been thereafter utilised to project Templar power throughout Europe.\n\nOnce no longer needed by The Templars, the tradition of their use would persist, in vestigal form, and give rise to a myth that they had always been about independent pilgrims on a personal spiritual/religious mission - to/from Santiago (The Holy Land having been long since forgotten).\n\nTincatinker\n\nVeteran Member\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\n2012\n\nAug 22, 2023\n\n#81\n\nOK, @Crosbie.

Similarly, knowing that The Covenant of The Ark is: “If the testimony of this ark is heeded, then mankind will never again be destroyed by a great flood”, doesn't mean much without knowing what the testimony of the ark is.\n\nBoth testimony and covenant can still be discovered. It is possible. It takes years of research of course.\n\nAlternatively, you can join The Templars – and work your way up, until you are illuminated with this knowledge as a consequence.\n\nBut, otherwise, The Templars will keep the Ark's covenant and testimony to themselves, as well as their holy mission.\n\nAs for Solomon’s Temple, bear in mind The Templars were named after it, and the earliest traces of their existence (under that name) goes only as far back as the 9th century – when they became so named as a consequence of becoming its guardians. The Temple goes way back. So, it was still around in the 9th century, and despite desecration (but not destruction), still heavily guarded by the Templars throughout the crusades and thereafter.\n\nThe Templars may have been caught off-guard, but once they arrived on the scene they made a pretty good job of it (not a ‘shite’ one).\n\nVNwalking\n\nOut walking\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\nVarious 2014-19\n\nVia Monastica 2022\n\nPrimitivo 2024\n\nAug 23, 2023\n\n#87\n\nRight\n\nThanks for the correction, @Crosbie .\n\n(I must say, Earth One is so boring...)\n\nC clearly\n\nModerator\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\nMost years since 2012\n\nAug 23, 2023\n\n#88\n\nThat is a pretty good answer to my original question\n\nCan you remind us what that original question was supposed to be?

The purpose of fairytales has been discussed by half a million authors, starting at least with Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm and not ending with Bruno Bettelheim and his well-known book published in the 80s. Oral tradition. The art of fairytale telling is immaterial world heritage in Germany and Austria. Long article in Wikipedia in various languages. Contain moral lessons and life lessons in addition to pure entertainment.\n\nThis fiction does not fall into the legend category. But at least here we are in the world of the pilgrimage to Santiago which is full of legends. A man appears on a horse in the sky. A world famous dead emperor has a dream. Grilled chicken fly. A man stays alive while hanging on the gallows for 36 days and supported by another man who had been decapitated a good thousand years earlier. These stories were taken for fact in a world where the laws of nature had not yet been explored in the way they were explored and discovered in subsequent centuries. Their purpose was manifold and in many cases politically motivated.\n\nThis fiction does not fall into the saga category such as the creation myths do. Again, oral tradition. Again, from a time when the laws of nature had not yet been explored in the way they were explored and discovered in subsequent centuries. This is how people - and they were not dumb people - explained the world they lived in and what they observed and those before them had observed. For example the Milky Way - it's spilled breast milk when Herakles was a baby; it's the visible path of the souls of the dead; it's the dust or the ashes of the trail of a man who rode a wagon over the sky. Ancient and medieval people did not know and could not see what we can see with the help of powerful telescopes: The Milky Way consists of distant stars, of suns actually. That was not known before the end of the Middle Ages and until astronomers with new technology came along, among them Herschel in the 18th century.\n\nSo what does it leave us with: The narrative is a fictional story, invented in the 19th, 20th or 21st century. It is not an old oral story. It wants to explain something that does not need such an artificial explanation: it is known how the system of roads that we call European pilgrimage roads came into existence. There is plenty of written historical documentation.\n\nJust because some known ancient fairytales, legends, sagas and myths have a kernel of fact in them does not mean that this new fictional story has even a fraction of an atom of fact in it. That is the whole argument upon which it rests: It could perhaps be true .... when I hear this line of argumentation I usually think, sure, the sun could perhaps rise in the west tomorrow morning.\n\nLast edited: Aug 23, 2023\n\nthejoker\n\nOfficial Blister Popper\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\nMany\n\nAug 23, 2023\n\n#96\n\n@Crosbie, having read your latest posts I think you do really believe in much of what you're saying.

It's great for clearing the mind and gaining clarity.\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\nTo Santiago and back. Le Puy to Aumont-Aubrac.\n\nAug 23, 2023\n\n#97\n\nThe HHGTTG was mentioned earlier. It reminded me of the Electric Monk. I found a suitable quote thanks to Google. It is a device that may come in handy:\n\n​\n\n“The Electric Monk was a labour-saving device, like a dishwasher or a video recorder... Electric Monks believed things for you, thus saving you what was becoming an increasingly onerous task, that of believing all the things the world expected you to believe.”​\n\n― Douglas Adams, Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency​\n\nCrosbie\n\nMember\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\n2nd Sept 2023\n\nAug 23, 2023\n\n#98\n\nI usually think, sure, the sun could perhaps rise in the west tomorrow morning.\n\nWhat a line to end on!\n\nAs you may therefore already know, at the time Solomon's Temple was being built, The Sun rose in the West.\n\ndick bird\n\nModerator\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\n2012, 2015, 2018, 2019, 2022, 2024\n\nAug 23, 2023\n\n#99\n\nAs you may therefore already know, at the time Solomon's Temple was being built, The Sun rose in the West.\n\nThis may be because at that time, as everyone knew, the world was flat."
