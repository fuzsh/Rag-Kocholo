        "text": "Bradypus\n\nMigratory hermit\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\nToo many and too often!\n\nMar 21, 2023\n\n#1\n\nA couple of weeks ago someone posted a question about some etched and painted rocks on the Camino Frances. The work of a Dutch artist around 1999 but the OP had been told that they were the work of the Knights Templar and were repainted from time to time by local communities. A myth in the making. Another dodgy claim which amused me when I read it some time ago was that the tiraboleiros who swing the Botafumeiro are Eastern Orthodox priests. Given the troubled history of relations between eastern and western Christianity that was never a very likely notion!\n\nSince reading about the painted rocks I've been wondering what other pieces of nonsense people have heard or read about the Caminos. \"Facts\" which turned out to be no such thing. And in my more frivolous moments I've been wondering what other pieces of nonsense it might be fun to seed and see if they establish themselves!

I actually was the source of a myth on the first camino I walked. Here's the story: I started to limp at the top of the hill at San Juan. It got worse as I walked toward Ages. I suddenly lost any support on the right side of my body. I collapsed in a heap. Peregrinos behind me stopped to help. When they saw I couldn't walk, one ran ahead to alert the authorities. Another carried my pack. Two others helped me limp my way to town. When we arrived, it seemed like the whole village and other peregrinos had heard about \"The Cripple.\" There was no hospital there, so I was taken to the albergue and put in a lower bunk that was fortunately near the shower. I slept for an hour or so, then got up, took a shower and felt good. I walked out of the albergue down the street to a restaurant. Villagers had their hands over the faces proclaiming \"Madre de Dios. Un miraculo!!!\" When I got to the restaurant, four young ladies started grilling me with questions. It turned out they were four Australian nurses. They said they assumed I had a stroke, but it was clear that I had aggravated a nerve near my hips, it fell out of place and everything fell with it. I had obviously done a poor job packing, putting too much weight on the one side. All the way from there to Santiago, I heard various versions of \"The Miracle of the Cripple.\" I always chuckled, knowing the truth.\n\nI assume many of the myths are simply tales that are told related to real events that are somehow fractured by each subsequent teller.\n\nLast edited: Mar 21, 2023\n\nnaplesdon\n\nVeteran Member\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\nMultiple Caminos 2010 to 2019\n\nMar 21, 2023\n\n#4\n\nWhat comes to mind immediately to me is the history of the Monastery and Hospital at San Anton near Castrojeriz. Run by Templars who were stance supporters of the Crusades and arch enemies of the Muslims and yet they’re there to serve in the honor of an eastern saint from Egypt. Reb Scott has published a brilliant little book about its history but there is so much we don’t know about. The Monastery survive for 100’s of year under Muslim rule in Spain.\n\nCWBuff\n\nVeteran Member\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\nFrances & Finisterre 05-07/22 Fran 26? d Nort 27?\n\nMar 21, 2023\n\n#5\n\nIt's traditional that, when you arrive in Santiago de Compostela, you must visit the Plaza de las Platerías and kiss the noses of the horses in the fountain.\n\nDANG!

It was at the end of the day on our 2021 Camino Frances when you are so calorie deprived you begin to think of rocks and sticks as possible sources of nutrition. We settled into the lovely Pension Albergue Los Caminantes, dropped our packs, showered, dressed in tomorrow's clothes and headed out to the closest bar, the Meson Ribadiso, for a well earned supper. A few minutes before we left the Pension, the skies opened up in a torrential downpour, a real frog drowner! We momentarily debated waiting out the storm but our desire to eat tossed any common sense to the curb. Even the thunder and lighting wasn't going to stop us! We quickly waded up the cobblestone street, trying to hop on the larger, drier stones to keep from soaking our only pair of non-waterproof shoes. As we entered the warm and lovely Meson, we noted a toy witch doll perched atop the beer and wine case - a whimsical nod to the witch folklore of Galicia. While enjoying a cold Estrella and hot meal, a tremendous bolt of lightning struck near us and we witnessed a blue arc of electricity leave the large polished brass beer tap and connect with the poor waiter who was holding a metal tray with a fellow peregrino's meal! He yelped more out of surprise than pain, and fortunately, recovered quickly to deliver the meal.

Before the Age of Enlightenment, people did believe that a hanged young man on the gallows could be kept alive for weeks by a saint holding him up and that hens being roasted on a spit over a roaring fire could become alive again and fly away, and we find delight in hearing these ancient myths and legends.\n\nBut 16 pieces of abstract rock art created in 1999 by a contemporary Dutch artist during his pilgrimage to Santiago who documented his Camino walk on his website for all to read and with photos to be viewed by anyone around the world - and instead we are told these rock paintings had been created by the Knights Templar (and it‘s always them and never any other of these medieval orders) and are regularly repainted by the locals? Puh-lease … whoever tells you that is either gullible themselves or pulling your legs.\n\nThe bit about the 20th c Dutch artist's work was dealt with earlier in this thread. Of course, anyone who knew what there is to know about the knights templar would see that attribution as a hoax. I certainly don't think they were medieval, and actually did not accord them any importance in my walk. Let us not argue about medieval legends. I just find delight, as you say, in them and in the history of the Camino.\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\nUs:Camino Frances, 2015 Me:Catalan/Aragonese, 2019\n\nMar 25, 2023\n\n#62\n\nSahagún's \"halfway\" certificate mentions the myth of some of Charlemagne's knight's lances rooting and leaving out to indicate that though those knights would die in the day's battle they would have eternal life.\n\nOf course if your main weapon has turned into a tree your chances of dying is going to increase.\n\nMore here:\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\nTo Santiago and back.

I think, \"How do we know all those ancient writers weren't just passing on garbage made up by some dingbat?\"\n\nResponding to\n\nOf all the legends, arguably the most famous was immortalized in the Chanson de Roland. The actual battle near Roncesvalles involved those pesky Basques routing the French army sent by Charlemagne. In the Chanson, it's not the Basques; it's Muslims. So much of history has been rewritten to suit the times. And it's still happening.\n\nThe Chanson de Roland (and the other medieval accounts of Roland) was written hundreds of years after the events it was \"reporting\" on and was a product of its time, much as the Arthurian stories were written hundreds of years after the events they purport to recount took place and reflected their times.\n\nIt is somewhat different when the accounts were contemporary. Let's take the story of the jousting of Suero de Quiñones at Hospital de Orbigo, but that nice long bridge. One might think it falls into the same category of mythical tales of chivalry. And, to be sure, some modern accounts may stray in that direction. But it was actually one of the best documented medieval tourneys with extensive contemporary accounts. At least, so says a friend of mine, a professor of medieval history specializing in medieval tourneys with numerous academic publications in that field.\n\nMichaelC\n\nActive Member\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\nMay 2023: Via Francigena, Lucca to Rome\n\nMar 29, 2023\n\n#68\n\nKing of the Pilgrimage\n\nI have not been able to confirm this, so I'll just put it here with \"other nonsense\" - it's too good of a story to keep to myself. A friend found this in Régine Pernoud's history book, Richard Coeur de Lion:\n\nIn the Middle Ages, when pilgrims traveled in groups and did not have to fear attacks as they did in Palestine, they always hurried especially on the last stage, and the one who arrived first and saw the towers of Santiago de Compostela or the hills of Rome before the others was named \"Roy du Pèlerinage\", King of the Pilgrimage - this term has become a family name and is considered the origin of the names Roy, Rey or Leroy, which so many French families bear.​\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\nTo Santiago and back.

It could be surviving Templars re-grouped calling themselves The Knights of St Anthony. They did in Leith Scotland so could of done the same in castrojeriz\n\nAmong my Masonic illustrations I have many definitions of the Tau. Some being that it means T.H. or Templum Hierosolyma, Temple of Jerusalem; or that it means a treasure, or a place were treasure is buried. The Tau is a figure constructed of five lines and is considered an important emblem or badge in Royal arch Masonry. There is also a triple cross like a T of the Egyptian, Roman, or English Alphabet.\n\nAmong my Masonic illustrations I have many definitions of the Tau.

Their Church, burying place with gardens were in St Anthony’s Wynd-an ally off the Kirkgate which no longer exists. Their Preceptory however lay in the area running from the Kirkgate Shopping Centre and Community Centre to Yardheads (Yard in Yardheads incidentally comes from Old High German Yarde meaning a Monastic garth or wall) and Henderson Gardens. Evidence for this comes from a Charter of King James VI which says All the Croft of Arable land contiguous to St Anthony’s garden, and also all that place and piece of ground whereon the Church and Preceptory of St Anthony of the Knights Templar stood”, which during the Siege of Leith bore the same name, in common with property I most parishes in Scotland which was held by the Knights Templar. Some houses in Edinburgh and Leith bore the Badge of the Order, a Tau Cross with the motto Lavs Deo” to show that they held the Superiority, but not, as is generally supposed indicating that they themselves occupied the premises.\n\nAttachments\n\nUntitledS.jpg\n\nIngham-3578.jpg\n\n1.jpg\n\nCDNII_BRIM_Painting_11-001.jpg\n\nJan_van_Eyck_(successors)_-_Man_with_pinks_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg\n\nLast edited: Jul 10, 2023\n\nme123\n\nNew Member\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\ner\n\nRebekah Scott\n\nCamino Busybody\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\nMany, various, and continuing.\n\nJul 18, 2023\n\n#73\n\nI have studied the historic record of the Antonine Monastery at Castrojeriz, and there are no Templars involved in its administration, foundation, ministry, or worship. The Tau symbol came from Egypt, the same place where St. Antony lived. The returning crusaders (there were plenty of non-Templar crusaders) brought what they believed were the bones of Antony with them back to France, where the monastic order took root. It spread all over Europe and southward to Spain, where it blossomed with two \"ecomiendas,\" or motherhouse/farmsteads: one in Olite, another, with a hospital, in Castrojeriz - at a site that was already populated. The Tau symbol figured much in their uniform and architecture. Another legend holds that St. Francis of Assisi walked the Way of St. James, and was so impressed with the Antonines at Castrojeriz that he adopted the Tau as a symbol of his new order, too! (Pure legend, no historical basis.)\n\nEurope 1000-1950 was a very religious place. Not every Tau is Franciscan or Antonine. Not every Jerusalem cross is Templar. Not every Antony is Antonine.

It took me less than five minutes to find two other (and may I say even better and more obvious) examples of Gothic masonry where this can easily be seen and done if one would find any meaning in doing so. I could probably find a dozen such examples if I wanted to.\n\nPut four or eight circles or oval shapes inside a circle so that they touch each other and you can see two perpendicular lines ending in triangles - in addition to a myriad of other patterns of lines and curves.\n\n\"\"\n\nLast edited: Jul 18, 2023\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\nTo Santiago and back.

However, this practice was apparently not confined to the Knights Templar. Churches and Cathedrals were built according to an elaborate set of numerical principles.\n\n¨Augustinián patristics refers to numerical theory in Civitatis Dei (ACTo no. 20). As well as the perfection of the number six, which is the first number that is the sum of its parts (Civ. Dei.XI-30), the number 7 represents the seventh day, recognizing the rest day of the Lord; (Civ. Dei. XI.31). Other significant numbers were twelve (=3x4 Civ. Dei XX.5.3), and one thousand, which is the perfect number for the fullness of time - a flat square figure (10 x 10), given a similar height, it is made cubic and, multiplied by ten to give a thousand (Civ. Dei XX.7.2).21 The influence of such metrics on the design of Tortosa cathedral is clear; six in the modules of the naves, seven in the heptagonal layout of the apse, and the large keystone of the presbytery, of 10 palms, is located at a height of 100 palms, which makes a thousand¨\n\nDesign and medieval construction: The case of Tortosa cathedral (1345-1441)Author(s): Josep Lluís i Ginovart and Agustí Costa JoverSource: Construction History , 2014, Vol. 29, No. 1 (2014), pp. 1-24Published by: The Construction History Society\n\nVNwalking\n\nOut walking\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\nVarious 2014-19\n\nVia Monastica 2022\n\nPrimitivo 2024\n\nJul 19, 2023\n\n#83\n\ndidn't you KNOW the Templar Knights invented the breeze block?
