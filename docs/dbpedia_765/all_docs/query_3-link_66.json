        "text": "I'm new here, but I really want to make a question about using real name order like Templar, Teutonic, Santiago, etc in my fiction but not as an Order, but a name for a Cult.\n\nTo make my question become more understandable, I will share my concept too. The picture above is my Novel Cover.\n\nSo I write a novel with this concept:\n\nIn another world there is an earth that fill by any kind of living things that created by God and Devs. In my world, there is only one God but for Devs there are so many of them. So to gardening the Earth, it's not just god to do that, Devs do the job too especially making human and other fictional creature like elf, org, goblin, etc.\n\nFYI, I will explain what is Dev. A dev is a special creature that created by God that have same power like God with an exception: a Dev can not kill God, but a Dev can kill another Dev. I'm using term \"Dev\" to make a difference between God and \"God\" such as: Thor, Amaterasu, Shiva, etc.\n\nSo the world in my story is another world concept that still using same map design and same name historical person like Jeanne d'Arc etc but with more fiction.\n\nBack to the Templar. The Templar is a cult that created by some human that created by God that really believe God is the only one allowed in this earth. So they attacking and killing the creature or human that created by Devs because they are not allowed here. I created this concept from white supremacy as my reference, so in my world maybe it called Human Supremacy or something (I'm still finding a good term for it).\n\nAnd it's not just Templar that has same think like this, I want to put other real Ordo like Teutonic, Santiago, etc and make them as cult and do thing like Templar, killing and attacking other creature and human from another Dev.\n\nEven The Templar is a dead Order today, so I think it's safe to make them like, you know, a bad guy from people created by Devs perspective.\n\nNow the question is here\n\nBut how about other Order that still exist today? Like Teutonic, Santiago, etc, is it good if I make them like Templar in my story?\n\nOf course this still plan, and I'm still writing this Novel in my Wattpad (will not put the link here because I think it will break the rule, but you can find it with the title in the cover) and Templar itself is the first cult that come in my Novel right now.\n\nI'm just afraid if I will be attacked by them (Teutonic, Santiago, etc) if I put their order name in my Novel (even it still not popular lmao). What is your suggestion? Is it safe to use the name or must I make another name? Or there is no rule about it so I am free to use their orders' names?\n\nAs I remember, the Templars were accused of heresy and disbanded 700 years ago, so the Templar organization will not sue you for libel.\n\nAs I remember, in Sir Walter Scott's novel Ivanhoe (1819) one of the main villains who plot with Prince John against King Richard, and who attack and kidnap innocent travelers, is a Templar knight, Sir Brian de Bois-Guilbert. Lucas de Beaumanoir, fictional Grand Master of the Templars, who happens to be visiting England for some reason, tries Rebecca as a witch and sentences her to burn at the stake, even though at that time the Catholic Church insisted that witchcraft wasn't real and forbade witchraft trials.\n\nAnd I have read a science fiction story set in the distant future in which a revived Templar order is involved in warfare to forcibly convert alien beings to Chrisitanity, which many contempoary people consider an evil action.\n\nSo for centuries writers have felt free to accuse medieval Templars of various misdeeds without fear of getting in trouble for libel.\n\nOn the other hand, many people think that the Templars were (mostly) good and innocent of all the charges against them, and Templars are often described as more or less \"good guys\" in fiction and historical speculation. The Templars are often mentioned in various more or less silly historical conspiracy theories, such as the Jesus bloodline theory, etc.\n\nThus I have seen a television episode where King Philip IV \"the (Un)Fair\" of France, who attacked the Templars, is described as an evil supernatural villain.\n\nhttps://moviechat.org/tt0115317/Poltergeist-The-Legacy/58c760716b51e905f67fd97c/The-Worst-Witness[1]\n\nAnd the creators of the show apparently didn't worry about the present government of France or the rival pretenders to the French crown suing them for libeling a former French leader who died about 680 years earlier.\n\nI Think that most of the other medieval military are no longer military orders but exist in other forms. I think that the modern Teutonic Knights are two charitable organizations, one Catholic and One Protestant.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teutonic_Order[2]\n\nAnd as far as I know they have never tried to interfere with viewing the famous movie Alexander Nevesky (1938) which depicts the Teutonic Knights as sinister invaders.\n\nAnd the Knights Hospitaller now exist as several charitable organizations.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knights_Hospitaller#Successors_of_the_Knights_Hospitaller[3]\n\nAs I remember, many novels, movies, television episodes, etc. have expressed strong opinions about relatively recent and still somewhat controversial events like the US Civil war and Reconstruction, World War I, World War II, the Nazis, The Cold war, Communism, the assassination of JFK, the Vietnam War, conspiracy theories, etc., etc. without too much trouble. So I tend to doubt that depicting fantasy counterparts of medieval religious orders will get a writer in much trouble.\n\nanswered Nov 9, 2019 at 18:00\n\nM. A. GoldingM. A.
