Their organisation, as reflected in their rules of life, represented a real fusion of ecclesiastical (as opposed to simply Christian) and martial ideals.1 The passage put an idea in my head, an idea that has taken some time to work out. What follows is the fruit of my labors. Ecclesiastical Knights is a spirituality study. The military orders, which emerged on the frontiers of Europe in the twelfth century, have long fascinated general readers and professional historians alike. Some of this fascination is tied up with occult mythology, the manifestations of which are legion in print and film. Worthier of attention, though, is the seemingly incongruous combination of monastic devotion and the practice of warfare into a single form of religious life. Defining, categorizing, and explaining this way of life is a major problem for the historiography of the military orders, one that Riley-Smith has called “the elephant in the room.”2 I propose a new name and a new conceptual model for understanding the Iberian military orders, one that better captures how they combined the exercise of arms and the monastic tradition into a single way of life. I hope that this model helps move the scholarly discussion beyond the label “warrior monks.” But a name or a model alone serves little to illuminate the spirituality of the military orders, which was lived in flesh and blood and the heat of the day. I undertake a detailed study of the military-religious vocation as it was lived out in the Orders of Santiago, Calatrava, and Alcántara in LeónCastile during the first century and a half of their existence. I would like to thank the people who have helped bring this project to fruition, beginning with Teo Ruiz, Patrick Geary, Kevin Terraciano, and John Dagenais, my professors at UCLA. Carlos de Ayala Martínez and Francisco García Serrano provided invaluable assistance and advice while I was in Madrid, and Helen J. Nicholson’s painstaking attention to numerous ix\n\nS N L ix\n\nx Preface drafts has dramatically improved the final product. I am grateful to the patient and dedicated board and staff of Fordham University Press, especially Franklin Harkins, Mary Erler, and William Cerbone. My fellow Jesuits have provided the necessary permissions, means, and support for the completion of the project, and family, friends, and colleagues have offered encouragement and more than polite interest all the while. A special thanks goes to Santa Clara University and its president Mike Engh, SJ, for the generous production support of this volume. I must recall, finally, the great Robert I. Burns, SJ, to whose scholarship on medieval Iberia I am greatly indebted, and whose departure from this life has been a loss for all who knew him. This might be a good place to answer a question that is sometimes posed to me about the relationship of my chosen field of study to my state of life. Years ago, I rather abruptly left my doctoral program to enter the Society of Jesus. Some have asked me if studying the military orders led to this decision. I’m not sure what the connection is supposed to be. I can say this much: like the members of the military orders, we Jesuits are not monks.3\n\nS N L x\n\nAbbreviations AHN OOMM\n\nArchivo Histórico Nacional, Sección de Órdenes Militares, Madrid, Spain\n\nBA\n\nIgnacio José de Ortega y Cotes, José Fernández de Brizuela, and Pedro de Ortega-Zúñiga y Aranda, eds., Bullarium ordinis militiae de Alcantara, olim sancti Juliani de Pereiro (Madrid: Tipografía Marín, 1761)\n\nBC\n\nIgnacio José de Ortega y Cotes, Juan Francisco Álvarez de Baquedano, and Pedro de Ortega-Zúñiga y Aranda, eds., Bullarium ordinis militiae de Calatrava (Madrid: Antonio Martín, 1759), reedited by Derek Lomax (Barcelona: El Abir, 1981)\n\nBN\n\nBiblioteca Nacional (BN), Madrid, Spain\n\nBS\n\nAntonio Francisco Aguado de Córdova, Alfonso Antonio Alemán y Rosales, and José López Agurleta, eds., Bullarium equestris ordinis sancti Iacobi de Spatha (Madrid: Typographia Ioannis de Aritzia, 1719)\n\nHDRH\n\nRodrigo Jiménez de Rada, Historia de rebus Hispanie, ed.

When asked for a short description of these institutions, many historians fall back on a well-known label: “warrior monks.” —Luis García-Guijarro Ramos1\n\nT\n\nhe Iberian military orders’ way of life from the twelfth to the early fourteenth centuries represented the consecration of knighthood to God in accordance with the ideals of the Gregorian Reform and the crusading movement, with the help of practices and norms taken from the monastic tradition. The exercise of arms and its exigencies were always primary in this hybrid way of life and gave prior form to the selection and ordering of the monastic elements. Thanks to their permanent commitment to holy war through the profession of vows and the practice of religious discipline, the orders offered to the medieval knight the highest possible opportunity to serve God that did not require him to abandon warfare altogether. The men who took this opportunity were not “warrior monks,” despite the persistent and mistaken use of that term. They were, rather, ecclesiastical knights, or warriors animated by ideals and spiritual currents endorsed by the church hierarchy. The present inquiry offers a fresh perspective on two difficult and closely related problems concerning the military orders—namely, definition and spirituality. The union of the seemingly incongruous traditions of knighthood and monasticism into a single type has long fascinated and puzzled observers, whether medieval or modern, and created serious difficulties for classifying the military orders. Some scholars, pointing to the ambiguity and discordance of the sources, have suggested that the search for greater precision is in vain. Similar problems have long bedeviled the effort to understand the orders’ spirituality, an issue that has been relatively neglected until recently.2 The scholarly contributions of latter days, despite their quality, have yet to put forth a compelling synthesis of the question. Ecclesiastical Knights aims to contribute to such a synthesis by offering a new model of the military-religious life for the Orders of Santiago, Calatrava, and Alcántara in Castile-León from their foundations until their spiritual decline in 1\n\nS N L 1\n\n2 Introduction the early fourteenth century. The new model of “ecclesiastical knighthood” may help to explain persistent problems in the historiography of other orders, such as the militarization of the Hospital, better than any alternative offered thus far. Last but not least, the present inquiry debunks the “warrior monks” nomenclature that remains a source of confusion and distortion.\n\nHistoriography\n\nS N L 2\n\nIn placing Ecclesiastical Knights within the relevant historiography, I am mindful of Borchardt’s warning that no honest scholar can claim to present entirely new ideas about the military orders between 1100 and 1300.3 My claims must be understood within an existing tradition of inquiry into definition and spirituality. General works on the military orders normally begin with their origins, accounting for the factors that led to the founding of the Knights Templar in the Latin East, highlighting the role of St. Bernard of Clairvaux in overcoming the objections voiced by contemporary churchmen, and telling how the Templars expanded and inspired the foundation of other military orders in various “crusading theaters” on Europe’s frontiers.4 This process is contrasted with the case of the Hospitallers, a religious community that underwent militarization. Such narratives often depict the birth of these two orders as a fusion of monastic and knightly ideals, closely dependent on the new crusading and religious impulses in Europe, without going into great depth or detail about the terms upon which this fusion took place. Noting the closing of the gap that had formerly separated the religious from the military way of life, Alan Forey observes that, in the early twelfth century, “the way was therefore open for the two kinds of miles Christi to be combined in the same person.”5 Franco Cardini attributes to St. Bernard of Clairvaux the view that the Templars were at once perfect monks and perfect knights.6 Carlos de Ayala Martínez has written that the Templars represented the “perfect conjunction” of knighthood and monasticism.7 Antonio Linage Conde says that the “typically medieval” military orders sought to fuse crusading and monastic ideals.8 Joseph O’Callaghan offers his own variation on the theme: “seeking to combine the ideals of monasticism and chivalry, the military Orders pledged to defend Christendom against the infidels and for more than a century were largely faithful to that trust.”9 This lack of specificity also hampers two of the most important books written on the Iberian military orders during the past decade:­\n\nIntroduction 3 Carlos de Ayala Martínez’s Las órdenes militares hispánicas en la Edad Media: siglos XII-XV and Enrique Rodríguez-Picavea’s Los monjes guerreros en los reinos hispánicos.10 These works have synthesized the great outpouring of research on the Iberian military orders and have much to say on the subject of spirituality, but overall their conceptual models are murky, a problem that Ayala Martínez has subsequently acknowledged. Sometimes the orders are treated as if they represented a particular kind of consecrated knighthood; at other times they are measured against the standard of monastic life and the other new religious movements of the twelfth century. To do the latter, tempting as it is, is to misunderstand the nature and purpose of the military orders, the key to which lies not only in the discussions of the learned but also in the way that the orders articulated themselves in the sources they have left behind. The work of Giles Constable, Anthony Luttrell, and James Brundage emphasizes the inherent difficulties of attaining greater specificity about how this fusion of military and monastic ideals took place. Luttrell highlights the seemingly insurmountable obstacles that face the historian who aims at greater precision, including the clear exceptions to any general rules that might be formulated, the medieval Church’s lack of effort to provide a canonical definition of the orders, and the vagueness and constant change of the institutions and vocabulary of early crusading.11 Constable is no more sanguine than Luttrell about the prospects for advancing the discussion of how the military orders should be categorized.12 These works call attention to the fact that medieval writers themselves were at a loss to explain or precisely define the military-religious life. Johannes Teutonicus, author of the standard gloss on Gratian’s Decretum, wrote in the second half of the thirteenth century that the Templars and Hospitallers were neither clerics nor laymen. He placed them in the same class as conversi (a kind of lay brother with a status beneath that of choir monks), with the caveat that they had a unique license to bear arms. In effect, he created a new juridical category for the military brethren because they fit nowhere else.13 Thomas Aquinas, the great systematizer of medieval theology, took up the question of whether a religious order could be instituted for the sake of waging war, in his Summa Theologiae.14 Although he answered in the affirmative, he made no specific mention of the military orders as such, nor did he enter into the more difficult questions that pertained to their classification.15 The same appears to be true for nearly all the medieval commentators, none of whom\n\nS N L 3\n\n4 Introduction\n\nS N L 4\n\n(save St. Bernard) devoted full treatises or even extensive treatments to the military-religious life. Some writers, like Otto of Freising and Anselm of Havelberg, included the military orders in their discussions of religious life, but others did not.16 The erudition of scholars like Luttrell, Constable, and Brundage might convince one that greater precision is a chimera, and the desire thereof a bugaboo of the modern, rather than the medieval, mind. While these scholars are right to say that the issue is difficult and complex, I think I have arrived at a better understanding of the military orders’ spirituality and, hence, of how to define them. Many contributions have made this possible. I point, first of all, to the work of Kaspar Elm and André Vauchez, who highlight the importance of the military orders for creating new spiritual opportunities for laymen.17 This is an essential insight for understanding the military orders as a particular kind of consecrated knighthood. Yet Elm does not sketch the contours of this lay spirituality in sufficient detail, and Vauchez claims that the orders’ lay character was rapidly effaced by the rigidity of the monastic traditions, above all the vow of chastity. As I demonstrate in this book, the military orders’ adaptation of the monastic tradition (including, in the case of Santiago, the vow of chastity) was always guided by the exigencies of knighthood operating as a prior form. Vauchez’s complaint—that the orders were a real option for only the few—points to the fact that ecclesiastical ideals about knighthood always had limited appeal to the majority of Europe’s military class. Jonathan Riley-Smith and James Brodman have furthered our understanding of the military orders by making distinctions among them. RileySmith has argued that the Temple and the Hospital were two very different orders. The former was from its foundations dedicated exclusively to holy war, whereas the latter represented a more conventional religious life that only gradually adopted military pursuits while maintaining its commitment to the care of the sick.18 Although Riley-Smith’s work on the military orders is better known for reigniting the debate over the trial of the Templars, his claims about the fundamental difference between the Hospital and the Temple are, I think, correct, and they have influenced my conception of ecclesiastical knighthood.19 Brodman has attempted to separate all military orders in medieval Europe into two categories: the “military-monastic” and the “military-hospitaller.”20 According to this model, orders like the Hospital and Santiago that dedicated a significant part of their work to the care\n\nIntroduction 5 of the sick fall into the latter category, whereas orders that apparently did not, like the Temple and Calatrava, fall into the former. Brodman traces the reason for this discrepancy back to the different rules according to which each order lived. Those that hewed closely to the Benedictine-Cistercian tradition were generally more monastic, and therefore less inclined toward hospitaller work. By contrast, those orders that were more influenced by the Rule of Augustine, or whose governing norms were eclectic, were more inclined toward the care of the sick, which often enough had been their original mission before they underwent militarization.21 Brodman’s taxonomy therefore rests ultimately on developments within religious life and the ferment it underwent during the late eleventh and twelfth centuries: some military orders were more like monks, whereas others were more like canons. Brodman’s attempt to explain the deep roots of the apparent “types” of military-religious life has improved our understanding of definition and spirituality.22 Yet I believe that the fundamental distinction between different kinds of military orders did not hinge on whether they followed a monastic or a canonical rule (though this issue has its place), but on the degree to which they were able and willing to articulate themselves in terms of ecclesiastical knighthood. It has been commonplace to treat the history of the military orders in terms of an early, heroic stage of growth and commitment to their mission that lasted perhaps until 1250, followed by the emergence of significant disciplinary issues and other problems that gradually gave way to marked decline by the early fourteenth century.23 The French historian Philippe Josserand has challenged this traditional perspective in his impressive work Église et pouvoir dans la Péninsule Ibérique.24 He thinks that “decline” has become a lazy convention among historians, and he marshals an impressive amount of evidence to demonstrate that the Iberian orders were alive and well in the late thirteenth and fourteenth centuries.25 Yet he also shows quite clearly that this was a period of significant transformation for the Iberian orders, a transformation that diminished their religious profile in society.26 Josserand’s work has convinced me that the rise-and-decline model, whatever its problems for the Iberian orders’ general history, remains applicable to their spirituality. Giles Constable’s earlier reflections on the military orders in The Reformation of the Twelfth Century highlight the priority of the exercise of arms within this hybrid phenomenon. He says that the genius of the military\n\nS N L 5\n\n6 Introduction\n\nS N L 6\n\norders was the combination of two distinct types into a new type that was neither one nor the other; “in practice, however, it seems that the military side predominated over the monastic.”27 Here is an attempt to specify the terms upon which the two ways of life were combined. Constable has apparently changed his mind since he wrote those lines, but he was right the first time. I would add, moreover, that the military side predominated over the monastic both in practice and in theory. This is a key point that allows for greater precision of definition and the rejection of the label “warrior monks” in favor of “ecclesiastical knights.” Writing in a similar vein, Luis Corral Val has dealt seriously with the question of spirituality, above all its link with the problem of definition, in his work on the Order of Alcántara. He says that the military brother was not simply a monk who dedicated part of his time to the exercise of arms, nor a knight who sought perfection by means of monastic spirituality, but one who had a genuine spirituality of his own. This way of perfection consisted of fulfilling the duties of a warrior under the condition of a religious. This definition, which has considerable merit, is nevertheless taken from a book with the problematic title (in translation) “Soldier Monks.”28 With the work of Alain Demurger and Simonetta Cerrini, we arrive at some of the most important recent contributions to the question of the military orders’ spirituality. When Demurger writes of the Templars as a chevalerie chrétienne or the members of the military orders as chevaliers du Christ, he is correctly identifying their knightly character, although these terms do not identify the military orders’ specific difference within the genus of knighthood. In speaking of a “Templar revolution,” Cerrini calls attention to the fact that the military orders were neither monks nor canons, but broke new ground for both the exercise of arms and the tradition of religious life.29 Her detailed study of the Templar Rule and her explanation of the role of Hugh of Payns in the order’s foundation are invaluable. Yet there are important ambiguities in her treatment of Templar spirituality. It is not always clear if she thinks the order’s “revolution” was articulated in accordance with or against the ecclesiastical trends inaugurated by the Gregorian Reform. Often she associates the Templars with new and doctrinally suspect intellectual trends of the age, such as the thought of Abelard, kabbalism, or religious pluralism. At other times, she presents the Templars as loyal and obedient sons of the Church.30 A related tension, to which I return in Chapter 2, is manifest in her characterization of the Templar Rule as anti-\n\nIntroduction 7 héroïque and antiascétique, which could imply that Templar life is founded upon negative principles. Ayala Martínez’s article “Nuevos tiempos, nuevas ideas” has offered the most important stimulus for Ecclesiastical Knights. Criticizing widespread scholarly nomenclature as well as his own earlier work, the Spanish historian has leveled a direct attack on the concept of the warrior monk.31 He argues that this notion has no warrant in the thought of St. Bernard of Clairvaux, whose De laude novae militiae has often been cited in support of it. Bernard, Peter the Venerable, and other monastic writers of the twelfth century who wrote favorably of the Templars or other military orders adhered to the traditional doctrine that the exercise of arms was forbidden to monks. In this and several subsequent articles, Ayala Martínez has both opposed the nomenclature of “warrior monks” and sought more adequate explanations for the emergence and development of the military-religious life.32 The present work seeks to fulfill Ayala Martínez’s objective by proposing ecclesiastical knighthood as a better conceptual model of how the military orders combined the knightly and monastic ideals into a single way of life, thereby completing the refutation of the “warrior monks” nomenclature. One need not look far in the popular and scholarly literature for this terminology. Desmond Seward’s problematic but influential book was entitled The Monks of War; a major conference of the mid-1990s used the title Los monjes soldados for its proceedings, as did Corral Val for his work on the Order of Alcántara; and the latest comprehensive survey of the Iberian orders is called Los monjes guerreros.33 Vauchez’s complaint that the military orders lost their lay character is punctuated by the claim that they became “moines-soldats.”34 Sebastian Salvadó calls the Templars “the first military monks,” and Dominic Selwood equates the daily life of Templars and Hospitallers in the West with that of any other monk.35 The work of Alain Demurger prevaricates on this issue. The first edition of his survey is titled Chevaliers du Christ, in which he explicitly denies that the Templars were monks.36 His book on the Templars, however, says that the term moines-soldats is overused but nevertheless legitimate, on the grounds that St. Bernard himself associated the Templars with both monks and knights.37 The second edition of his survey has been renamed Moines et guerriers, on the grounds that the members of the military orders both prayed and fought. Curiously, however, Demurger does not in the second edition retract his denial that the Templars were monks, raising the question of why\n\nS N L 7\n\n8 Introduction\n\nS N L 8\n\nthe title has been changed.38 Recently Saul António Gomes has restated and defended the concept of the monge-cavaleiro, on the grounds that the members of the military orders had various levels of religious practice and spirituality, especially when living in community away from the frontier, where their life would have had a less bellicose and more monastic character. Gomes’s treatment, however, does not take sufficiently into account the problems that will be discussed in this book.39 Likewise Damien Carraz uses moines-soldats and monachisme militaire repeatedly throughout his study of the Templars in Provence, but his justification of these terms is surprisingly brief.40 There are, in addition, countless passing references to warrior monks or soldier monks scattered across the pages of medieval historiography. Jean Leclercq, the great monastic historian of the twentieth century, speaks of them, as does Malcolm Barber, who has written numerous major works on the Templars.41 Frederick Russell’s classic on just war in the Middle Ages claims that St. Bernard created the image of the warrior monk, whereas Duggan says that he “passionately espoused” this new institution.42 In her work on the Order of Santiago, María Echániz Sans refers to the monje-soldado.43 A lavishly illustrated popular survey of the military orders begins with these words: “This is a book about monks who were also soldiers,” and the introduction to Jonathan Phillip’s monograph on the Second Crusade mentions warrior monks.44 C. H. Lawrence, an expert on medieval religious life, freely employs this nomenclature, describing the military orders as “orders of knights dedicated to fighting the infidel, who were also fully professed monks. They look like a contradiction in terms.”45 Even when scholars use such terms consciously and deliberately, purple passages from St. Bernard are generally the only thing they offer by way of support or explanation. Often one finds the label “warrior monk” and its equivalents only in passing, or in the titles of books or conferences, where it most readily catches the reader’s eye. Does this usage merely reflect the desire of authors or editors to generate more interest in their publications? There is, on the one hand, hesitation to explain and defend warrior monks as a conceptual model for the military orders and, on the other hand, a widespread use of a well-known label that easily escapes deeper consideration. What are the conceptual problems with understanding the members of the military orders as warrior monks? The earliest theorists and practitioners of the monastic life saw it not as a unique movement but as the fulfillment of the Christian vocation bestowed in baptism, characterized not\n\nIntroduction 9 by sacramental authority but by conversatio morum.46 With the passage of time, these figures began to acquire a distinct status and established numerous traditions and organizational models, such that it was eventually possible to speak of a monastic “order” to which they all belonged.47 The defining characteristics of this way of life were the following: flight from the world and worldly activities, conversion from sin, the permanent dedication to prayer and penance in solitude or in community, and the profession of religious vows.48 Most important for the present inquiry, combat was absolutely incompatible with this life, a situation that did not change even after the foundation of the military orders. St. Bernard and other early apologists for the military brethren did not consider them monks at all, but instead held a fundamentally traditional understanding of monasticism. Whatever points of commonality there were between monks and the members of the military orders, they were still two fundamentally different kinds of religious life. The “warrior monks” nomenclature also encourages the related and misleading tendency to view the military orders’ spirituality primarily from the standpoint of the other religious movements of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries.49 The military orders, especially the Temple and the Iberian Cistercian groups, clearly took a great deal from these movements, even to the point of maintaining strong institutional ties with them. Yet the new monastic orders and mendicants participated much more fully in the Church’s liturgical and spiritual patrimony, especially in its written articulation, than did the military orders. Held up against this standard, the latter’s spirituality can appear only thin and impoverished by comparison, and cannot be properly understood on its own terms. Some scholars, as noted already, have attempted to link the military orders with canons regular, but this solution is even more problematic. Canons were fundamentally “ordained clerics organized into groups for the performance of the holy offices in cathedrals and other large churches.”50 Although the military orders did have chaplains, they were distinctively lay (in the sense of nonordained) organizations under lay leadership, meaning that the military brethren had even less in common with canons than with monks. Caroline Walker Bynum’s distinction between monks and ­canons—that the former saw themselves fundamentally as learners, whereas the latter sought to teach by word and example—is clearly inapplicable to military orders’ form of religious life.51 While the military orders\n\nS N L 9\n\n10 Introduction\n\nS N L 10\n\ndrew ­elements from both the monastic and the canonical traditions, they were more estranged from the latter. Perhaps this is why the phrase “warrior canons” has never been in vogue. The point is that the spiritual life of the military orders cannot be understood primarily by reference to monks or canons, or to the distinction between the two, but rather as a particular kind of consecrated knighthood. The problem with the term “warrior monk” is therefore threefold: first, it suggests that the members of the military orders were in fact monks according to the definition offered earlier; second, it suggests that the medieval Church, through figures like St. Bernard, radically altered its understanding of monasticism to accommodate the military orders and include them among its ranks; third, it evaluates the military-religious life according to a standard that it never could nor intended to meet. The combination, then, of “warrior” and “monk” in a single phrase is simply a misnomer. In this vein, Christian Vogel expresses strong reservations about calling the Templars monks or canons, or even identifying the Benedictine or Augustinian influences on their Rule, saying that Bernard and the Council of Troyes helped them establish their own framework (Rahmen).52 What sort of framework could achieve the seemingly incongruous union of knighthood and monasticism into a single way of life? Richard Kaeuper’s study of chivalry suggests that it was no easy task. He identifies a major period of Church reform at the end of the twelfth century that struggled to influence an often ascetically oriented but independent-minded knightly class that was apt to carry out its devotional life without too much regard for clerical authority.53 Kaeuper has little to say about the military orders, perhaps because they sought precisely the ecclesiastical sources of order to which others paid little heed, and maybe also because he seems to reject the whole notion of a Christian knighthood when he accuses medieval warriors of “squaring the circle” by combining religious asceticism and heroic vengeance.54 A view less wedded to pacifist readings of Christianity can be found in Katherine Allen Smith’s War and the Making of Medieval Monastic Culture, which explores the mutual influences between warriors and monks during the eleventh and twelfth centuries. She contends that while scholars have been well aware of the impact that churchmen had on the emerging knightly class, they have been somewhat slower to appreciate the way that the outside or secular world penetrated monastic life:\n\nIntroduction 11 After the turn of the first millennium the concept of miles Christi was dramatically expanded as spiritual warfare became intertwined with the emerging ethos of holy war and monks’ long-held dominance of the spiritual battlefield was challenged by crusaders, members of the military orders, and pious arms-bearers more generally.55 At first, Smith’s arguments would seem to militate against any attempt to draw sharp, neat distinctions among the various kinds of milites Christi of this period. Smith herself cautions strongly against such distinctions and notes the problems that medieval writers faced in trying to classify certain groups, including the military orders. She rejects “the ideological separation of peace-loving religious communities from bloodthirsty knights, of ‘those who prayed’ from ‘those who fought,’” and rightly so.56 War and the Making of Medieval Monastic Culture nevertheless makes a fundamental point for the study of knighthood and monasticism: both these phenomena were part of a cultural milieu deeply informed by the idea and reality of warfare, especially holy warfare. Knights prayed and monks fought, if in different ways. This should remind us that an arms bearer who desired to consecrate his life to God and serve him the rest of his days did not thereby become a monk, still less a warrior monk. Nor did a monk who envisioned his struggles against the devil with all the trappings of contemporary siege warfare thereby become an arms bearer. The distinctions between ways of life are just as important as the common influences that underlie them.\n\nEcclesiastical Knights The crucial distinction between the military orders and any other religious community was that the former were permitted and expected to bear arms.57 This is a clear line of demarcation within the great spectrum of new religious movements, loricati, and other hybrid or marginal phenomena that Smith identifies. Although Duggan has shown how churchmen of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries established significant qualifications to the traditional prohibition on clerical arms bearing, only for the military orders’ was fighting normalized as a way of life.58 The question is why they, alone of all the new groups of the twelfth century, should have been permitted to make this radical departure. The answer is that the military orders did not represent\n\nS N L 11\n\n12 Introduction\n\nS N L 12\n\na new form of monasticism. They did not come into existence in the same way or by following the same motives as the other new orders of the period did. The way of life that the Templars pioneered, and that St. Bernard defended, was a new knighthood. The Temple sprang from the points of contact between the religious aspirations of twelfth-century knights, which had been fed by monastic renewal and crusade spirituality, and the ideals and plans of churchmen that had emerged out of the Gregorian Reform. Just as crusading itself was such a point of contact, with explosive results, so also was the Temple, though for a more restricted group of people. The phenomenon that we call knighthood was still in its infancy in the first decades of the twelfth century, and in time it would follow multiple lines of development across time and space. The Temple and the Iberian military orders represented one of these lines, the one most closely tied to the ideals, institutional models, and organizational control of the hierarchical Church. The traditions of monastic observance, modified for the unique demands of this military-religious life, were pressed into service and gave the orders a certain monastic cast, without thereby making their members into monks properly speaking. The military orders were indeed hybrids; in the words of James Brundage, “they were not exactly monks, nor were they canonsregular, nor were they clerics, yet in some respects their way of life resembled elements of each of these conventional religious groups.”59 Within this hybrid phenomenon, however, the warrior was the primary type. This, I believe, is the point that has frequently been overlooked in discussions of classification. Knighthood, understood in the broader sense of the exercise of arms on horseback, gave form to the military-religious life, and the vows and religious observance served to purify and consecrate that knighthood to the service of God. I therefore use the term “ecclesiastical knights” to describe the members of the military orders, as their roots lay fundamentally in the knightly piety and crusading impulses of the late eleventh and early twelfth centuries.60 The men who entered these orders were, for the most part, already warriors and did not wish to leave behind that way of life. They wished, instead, to make it holy. The terms “knight” and “ecclesiastical” both require explanation, especially in the face of various objections. “Knight” originally derives from an Old English word meaning “servant,” and it did not yet exist in the twelfth century when the military orders were born. The most basic sense of “knight” in English refers to a warrior who fights on horseback, but the\n\nIntroduction 13 semantic range of the term is wider than that. Defining what a knight is, and still more what knighthood is, is a problematic endeavor, such that some historians prefer to use terms like “arms bearer” instead.61 The issue is rendered more complex still by the particularities of the English language, which distinguishes between “knighthood” and “chivalry,” the latter having particular associations with European courtly culture that did not develop, at the earliest, until the late twelfth century.62 As for the term “ecclesiastical,” the fact that the members of the military orders wanted to consecrate their knighthood did not, in itself, set them apart from other knights. Even the strongest scholarly advocates of the “secular” character of knighthood acknowledge that Christian elements were incorporated into it, and the ritual forms associated with knighthood, however removed from clerical control they may have been, represented a kind of consecration. Many knights, moreover, took their salvation seriously and tried to turn their exercise of arms to the service of God. What then justifies the use of the term “knight” and the adjective “ecclesiastical” with respect to the military orders? I understand “knight,” as it is now used with reference to the Middle Ages, as the English equivalent of miles, a Latin term that does date from the period under investigation. This word, which in antiquity usually referred to the Roman infantryman, became almost exclusively associated with the mounted warrior sometime during the latter eleventh century. During this time, the warrior class was undergoing significant changes; indeed, it was becoming possible to identify it as a distinct group. Richard Barber’s definition of the “knight” is apropos: “a mounted warrior who enjoys a specific social status and a distinct ethos, ésprit de corps, mentality—call it what we will—which eventually blossoms into the wider culture of chivalry.”63 The attributes of specific social status and distinct ethos are the basis of my own working definition, and I accept as “knights” even those mounted warriors belonging to this general background who were not formally dubbed, especially in the Iberian context.64 The members of the military orders were mostly drawn from this same social group, and in the exercise of their new vocation, they did not entirely lose their social status or distinct ethos. Rather, both were transformed and defined by their religious observance and the particular orientation of their practice of warfare. The profession of vows and commitment to a religious rule had far-reaching consequences. In the first place, the members of the military orders, unlike their lay counterparts, chose to submit themselves to ecclesiastical discipline in perpetuity.\n\nS N L 13\n\n14 Introduction From a positive standpoint, this meant that they followed certain rhythms and patterns of the monastic life, with common dress, horarium, prayer, penance, and so on. It also means that their exercise of arms was beholden to the cause of holy war rather than mere rapine and lust for gain. While in practice there were plenty of both in the history of the military orders, the security concerns of the Holy Land and other frontier zones gave them real obligations that all of Latin Christendom counted on them to maintain. From a negative standpoint, the military orders’ way of life precluded their members from participating in a variety of activities that would become characteristic of the culture of chivalry. The most obvious of these, thanks to the vow of chastity, was the pursuit of women, whether in marriage or outside of it. But other pastimes, like tournaments, hunting, gaming, secular music, or celebrating the greatness of one’s lineage, were also excluded. In short, the military orders’ way of life was meant to breathe the atmosphere of the cloister rather than the court. Their way of life conformed to the ideals and prerogatives of the Gregorian Reform about the exercise of arms and of the proper place and activities of the knight in society, ideals to which relatively few men were willing to commit themselves.65 Hence the best way to understand the military orders’ spirituality in its own terms is as a particular kind of consecrated knighthood. Viewed from this perspective, the distinctive religious ethos of the military orders, as well as their achievements and shortcomings, can be better appreciated.\n\nMethodology and Sources\n\nS N L 14\n\nIt is necessary to explain how the present work is a spirituality study, as well as identify some of the inherent difficulties in undertaking such a task. When applied to a particular religious order or family of orders, “spirituality” refers to an aggregate that can be grasped but not always defined, “the principles more commonly and more habitually referred to, the forms of prayer in more ordinary use, the more common manner of directing souls.”66 Sometimes the roughly equivalent term “charism” is also used.67 Yet research on the military orders’ spirituality remains hampered by a number of factors, which have been addressed by Hans-Dietrich Kahl and José Mattoso.68 The military orders, especially the Iberian ones, did not produce the kind of narrative or devotional sources upon which historians of spirituality usually rely, and even liturgical books have mostly been lost.69 The evidence\n\nIntroduction 15 we do possess for their religious practices indicates a fairly thin spirituality and has led to the suggestion that the pattern of the military brothers’ devotion lay somewhere between that of conversi and third-order religious.70 Mattoso highlights, in addition to the lack of sources, the difficulty that modern people generally have in understanding the religious motives of the past and the lack of the specialized spiritual formation that would facilitate such an understanding. I think it is impossible to capture the charism of the military orders using the methods and sources that scholars of religious life normally use.71 The best alternative is to examine, from a variety of perspectives, specific military orders in their historical context as particular instantiations of the military-religious life. The primary focus of this study is the three Iberian military orders of Santiago, Calatrava, and Alcántara, all of which were based in the Kingdoms of León and Castile. I do, however, discuss the Templars and the Hospitallers as well, for three reasons. First, it is nearly impossible to explain the genesis and development of any military order without reference to these “universal” orders. 72 Second, I can adequately explain the problem of “warrior monks” only by beginning with the Templars. Third, I mean to suggest the concept of ecclesiastical knighthood as a point of departure for further research into other military-religious communities. Thus, while my treatment of the Temple and the Hospital is primarily propaedeutic to a study of Santiago, Calatrava, and Alcántara, it is also intended for scholars who know other orders better than I do. The Iberian Peninsula was fertile ground for this way of life, with more than a dozen distinct orders founded or established there between the twelfth and fourteenth centuries.73 While the Temple and the Hospital have generated greater popular and scholarly interest, their Iberian counterparts have by no means been neglected, as the great outpouring of research in recent decades has shown.74 They were not mere imitations of the Temple or the Hospital but rather were influenced by both the Outremer-based orders and historical developments and institutions particular to the Iberian Peninsula. They were, in other words, distinct permutations of ecclesiastical knighthood. What is the “variety of perspectives” that this investigation offers? Chapter 1 is dedicated to the foundations of the orders, meant in a dual sense: first, the acts and events by which they came into being at ­particular ­moments, and second, the broader historical developments, whether in Europe, the Holy Land, or Iberia, whose confluence made their existence possible. Here,\n\nS N L 15\n\n16 Introduction\n\nS N L 16\n\nI trace the paths of development that each order followed and differentiate between two classificatory schemas: one according to genesis, and the other according to range of activities and membership. The concept of ecclesiastical knighthood is presented as a way of explaining and unifying these two schemas. Chapter 2 examines how the structures of monasticism were adapted to meet the demands of the new vocation and how the orders incorporated other members, such as clerics and women, into a military organization. A major problem for studying the military-religious life in Iberia is that the extant sources are largely normative in character. This means that it is much easier to show how constructs were set up than how they were filled with content by those who lived them. Any spirituality study of the orders, including mine, runs up against this difficulty. Jochen Schenk and Nicholas Paul have provided excellent examples of how to study prosopographically the spirituality of crusaders and military orders “on the ground” in Western Europe, and such an approach to the Iberian orders could be a fruitful avenue for future research.75 My own contribution to a close contextual study can be found primarily in the final two chapters, which seek to partially overcome the limitations of the normative sources. Chapter 3 is concerned with the mission and purpose of the orders. Although fighting was their principal raison d’être, they dedicated themselves to other activities, such as the care of the sick and the ransoming of captives, all of which they saw as ways of exercising Christian charity. Chapter 4, finally, analyzes a group of documents, known as hermandades, to demonstrate how the military orders’ relations with one another reflected a common understanding of their vocation. Broadly speaking, I offer three perspectives: one of the orders’ internal workings, one of their external mission and activities, and one of their relations to each other. When viewed through the lens of ecclesiastical knighthood, these various aspects converge into a single vision of the Iberian military orders’ spirituality. As mentioned already, sources are a problem, but researchers find themselves assisted by an accident of history. In the nineteenth century, the Spanish government carried out an extensive seizure of ecclesiastical lands known as desamortización. In so doing, the government had to take responsibility for many of the local archives whose former caretakers had been expelled. Their contents were brought to Madrid and placed in the Archivo Histórico Nacional (AHN) and organized into various sections, including one dedicated to the military orders (OOMM). It is subdivided\n\nIntroduction 17 into sections for each order: Santiago, Calatrava, Alcántara, Montesa, the Hospital, and the Temple. Previous researchers have undertaken the task of classifying this material, which greatly facilitates its use.76 Santiago and Calatrava both have considerable collections, but Alcántara’s central archive was lost, and only a few documents are available. The vast majority of the documentation deals with day-to-day business: property transactions, royal and ecclesiastical privileges, donation letters, and the like, but its yield for the present study has been surprisingly good. Sources from other sections of the AHN, such as Códices, have also been consulted. The most important printed sources are the bullaria, collections of privileges, and donations that were compiled in the eighteenth century.77 Some of the orders’ rules, statutes, and other governing norms can be found in the bullaria, and others have been published separately.78 The loss of Alcántara’s central archive has been compensated by the dogged effort of Bonifacio Palacios Martín and a team of scholars to collect and publish the surviving material scattered across Europe.79 Joseph Delaville Le Roulx’s multivolume general cartulary is the principal source for the Hospitallers, whereas Carlos de Ayala Martínez spearheaded the publication of the same order’s cartulary for Castile-León.80 Hiestand has brought together materials for both the Temple and the Hospital into one volume.81 The documentary collection for one of Santiago’s principal female monasteries is also available in book form.82 Certain monographs contain indispensable documentary collections.83 The works of Julio González, who collected a massive corpus of documents from the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, have also been consulted.84 Volumes of papal correspondence have both provided necessary background and filled gaps in the orders’ own collections.85 The one major liturgical source is the Kalendario de Uclés, which pertains to the Order of Santiago.86 Yet the orders produced almost nothing in the way of spiritual writing, nor are there any saints from the early period, and so no hagiography.87 Because two of the Iberian military orders were affiliated with the Cistercian Order, the Rule of Benedict and a collection of the Cistercian general chapter proceedings have been consulted.88 St. Bernard’s crucial role in the foundation of the Templars make his collected works a valuable source.89 The most important chronicles dedicated to the Iberian military orders are the works of Francisco Rades y Andrada and Alonso de Torres y Tapia.90 The first general history for one of the orders, known as the Primera historia\n\nS N L 17\n\n18 Introduction de Santiago, was of only limited usefulness for this study.91 Rodrigo Jiménez de Rada’s Historia de rebus Hispaniae is especially important for the foundation of Calatrava and provides some valuable commentary on the orders’ place in Castilian society.92 Many general chronicles were written in Iberia during the twelfth, thirteenth, and fourteenth centuries, and these provide valuable information on the orders and the world in which they lived.93 Certain crusade chronicles, especially William of Tyre, are crucial for the Temple and the Hospital.94\n\nConclusion In the end, the judgment of other scholars and the silent artillery of time determine the significance of one’s work, yet I do wish to reiterate the purpose of the present inquiry and its place in the historiography of the military orders. The aim of Ecclesiastical Knights is to show how the military-religious life in Iberia was a particular kind of consecrated knighthood, thereby discrediting the label of “warrior monks” and contributing to a synthesis of the Iberian orders’ spirituality that until now has been lacking. I acknowledge, with Luttrell and Constable, that defining the military orders is a difficult task, but I think it is possible to do better. I agree with Ayala Martínez that the members of the military orders were not warrior monks, and if my work convinces scholars to stop using that term, I will have partially accomplished my task. I concur with Brodman and Riley-Smith on the importance of making distinctions among the various military orders with respect to spirituality, although I have drawn those distinctions somewhat differently than they have. I hope my proposed model will move the discussion of definition and spirituality beyond its present impasse and improve our understanding of these knights who consecrated their warfare with the vows of religion.\n\nS N L 18\n\nChapter One Foundations Greater love has no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends. —John 15:31\n\nW\n\nalter Map, writing in the last decades of the twelfth century, observed, “It is in the period of this century that the Templars, the Hospitallers in Jerusalem, the Knights called of the Sword in Spain, from whom our discourse took its departure earlier, have grown to the zenith of their strength.”2 This remark, made almost offhandedly amid Map’s trenchant commentary on the varieties of religious life in his day, shows the tendency of contemporaries both to perceive connections between the various military orders and to misapprehend the nature of those connections.3 Modern historians have often encountered similar difficulties, thanks to several problems: the extant source material, the hybrid nature of the military-religious life, and the different contexts in which it emerged. An inquiry into the nature of the military-religious life must accomplish three main tasks. First, to survey the historical backgrounds of several regions: Western Europe from the latter half of the eleventh century, the Holy Land in the wake of the First Crusade, and Iberia from the beginning of the twelfth century. Second, to follow the respective historical trajectories of the universal and Iberian orders from their foundations through their first decades. Third, to formulate a conceptual model grounded in the way that the orders articulated themselves and the way they were understood by contemporaries. Such a model must be sufficiently complex and flexible to account for the relevant differences of context between the Holy Land and Iberia, and sufficiently unified, in formal terms, to apply to the various orders in question. I begin with the Temple and the Hospital, which are first in terms of chronology and importance, and proceed to Santiago, Calatrava, and Alcántara, placing each order in its context.\n\n19\n\nS N L 19\n\n20 Foundations\n\nThe Universal Military Orders: Background Most accounts of the emergence of the military orders adhere to a familiar narrative of developments in Western Europe. During the eleventh century, a new social and political elite, collectively known as milites, took shape, forming the basis of what would become knighthood.4 Stimulated by the Peace and Truce of God movement as well as their contacts with monasteries and other religious movements, these mounted warriors experienced an upswing in religious piety, as manifested in foundations of monasteries, entrance into religion, the taking of the habit before death, and most important, pilgrimage.5 Most knights chose to remain in the world rather than enter religion, but the spiritual ideals and aspirations of monks and pious laymen were often remarkably similar.6 Richard Kaeuper has noted, however, that European knights maintained a marked degree of independence from Church authority and ecclesiastical ideals.7 These trajectories, in turn, intersected with numerous others. The churchmen associated with the Gregorian Reform began to rethink a traditional Christian aversion to the use of force and began to identify instances in which the exercise of arms could be a spiritually meritorious activity.8 A corollary to this development was the application of the term miles Christi, once reserved for monks and clergy alone, to those who took up the sword on the Church’s behalf.9 At the same time, the Byzantine Empire was suffering terrible losses to the Seljuk Turks and began appealing to the West for aid. Pope Urban II’s proclamation of what would later become known as the First Crusade tapped into deep currents of devotion and enthusiasm, and enormous armies were recruited for the journey to the East.10 Against all reasonable expectations, the crusader army experienced a series of victories that culminated in the fall of Jerusalem in 1099.11 Thus began Latin rule over the holy places, and with it, the insoluble problems of maintaining that rule. What follows is not an exhaustive account of the origins of the five military orders under consideration, but rather an exposition of how these now-familiar narratives point toward a new model of the military-religious life: ecclesiastical knighthood.\n\nThe Templars S N L 20\n\nOrigins Although the crusaders attributed their unlikely conquest of Jerusalem to the Almighty, they immediately faced the practical problems of victory.\n\nFoundations 21 Because the campaign was both a pilgrimage and a penitential war, crusaders fulfilled their vow once they had visited the holy places. Most participants decided to return home, and although their departures were offset somewhat by new arrivals, the Crusader States were constantly short of manpower.12 Subsequent campaigns often exacerbated the problem, because the armies fought to gain territory that, even if captured, could not be held once they departed. The warriors who did remain could not be expected to fight at all times, or serve their lords indefinitely, since professional standing armies did not yet exist. What the Latin East needed were well-trained men permanently dedicated to the practice of war, but there was no precedent for such a thing. No precedent, that is, until the foundation of the Knights Templar. There are numerous narrative sources for this event, which already manifest divergent understandings of the new group and its significance.13 According to William of Tyre, a group of pious knights, led by Hugh of Payns, took religious vows under the Latin patriarch of Jerusalem.14 They promised to devote themselves to the service of God like regular canons, but in a particular way: by protecting the roads from attacks of thieves and bandits, especially for the sake of pilgrims.15 Walter Map claims that, before the group was established, Hugh had already begun his work of protecting pilgrims by ambushing Saracens at a horse pool outside the city. He was able to convince pilgrims who were warriors to join him either temporarily or permanently in the service of God in chastity and sobriety.16 King Baldwin II of Jerusalem granted a base to this confraternity at his own palace, the Dome of the Rock, which the Christians believed to be the Temple of Solomon. There the knights followed the liturgical life of the Canons of the Holy Sepulcher, who served as their chaplains.17 They also received numerous benefices with which to sustain themselves. The date that William of Tyre gives for these events is 1118, but Malcolm Barber has argued for a foundation date between January 14 and September 13 of 1120.18 At some point before 1129, the Templars also began serving in the army of Jerusalem.19 The account of Bernard the Treasurer, though dating from the 1230s, seems to draw on an earlier tradition. This much simpler version lacks numerous key elements of the other narratives, such as the role of Hugh of Payns, the protection of pilgrims, or the renewal of knighthood. It does, however, emphasize the Templar connection to the Canons of the Holy Sepulcher.20 The early years of the Templars’ existence were marked by poverty and obscurity, and the group’s survival was uncertain. Barber suggests that William\n\nS N L 21\n\n22 Foundations\n\nS N L 22\n\nof Tyre’s figure of nine original members is incorrect. Michael the Syrian reports a more probable estimate of thirty founding members.21 Simon de St. Bertin and Orderic Vitalis do not offer full accounts of the Templars’ origins but only mention them in passing. The value of their testimony lies primarily in the fact that it precedes that of William, Michael, and Walter by decades. Simon indicates that the first Templars had participated in the crusade, without naming anyone in particular. These men vowed themselves to the Temple of God under a common life of poverty, chastity, and a poor habit, and they committed themselves to using arms only against the pagans to defend the land, as necessity required. The impetus for this decision, says Simon, came from the leaders of the army of God, while no mention is made of the patriarch of Jerusalem.22 Orderic Vitalis, writing in the 1120s or 1130s, refers to Fulk of Anjou’s association with the Templars, as “admirable knights” dedicated to fighting for God in mind and body, who hold all worldly things in contempt and face martyrdom daily.23 Anselm of Havelberg erroneously locates the foundation of the Temple, a nova religionis institutio, in the pontificate of Urban II. He praises their religious and military discipline in terms reminiscent of St. Bernard, calling them laymen (laici), religious men (viri religiosi), and knights of the Temple (milites de Templo). He also attributes to Urban the view that they were equal in merit to monks or canons.24 It may ultimately be impossible to sort out the disagreements in these accounts. What is important to note is that none of these writers identifies the first Templars as monks, even if they in some cases compare their discipline to that of monks.25 William and Simon both place emphasis on the profession of vows, with the former observing that the members lived according to the more canonichorum. Yet it is equally clear that this profession of vows and renunciation of the world did not involve, as it did for all other monks and canons, the renunciation of the use of arms. The first Templars were milites, or men of the equestri ordine, and such they would remain for the protection of pilgrims and of the Holy Land more broadly. Although the sources do not agree on the exact circumstances of the Templars’ foundation, it is clear that Hugh of Payns and King Baldwin used their contacts in the West to obtain support for the new community, and their efforts came to fruition at the Council of Troyes in 1129. There, before numerous prominent churchmen and lay lords, Hugh presented an account of his community’s customs and solicited advice for their improvement. The\n\nFoundations 23 papal legate raised the Templars to the status of a religious order, and the assembly drafted them a new rule.26 The fairly quiet and humble circumstances of the Templar foundation belie its significance. Pope Urban’s call of 1095 had been successful because it represented a point of convergence between the ideas and plans of ecclesiastics and the aspirations and interests of Europe’s knightly class. The foundation of the Knights Templar represented another point of convergence, but one that was more demanding and therefore limited to the few.27 If the pious impulses of the First Crusade had brought thousands of knights halfway across the world to Jerusalem, it is not surprising that some of them wanted to dedicate themselves in a permanent way to those same ideals. Neither the churchmen who approved the order nor the Templars themselves were creating a group of “warrior monks.” Instead, they were channeling nascent knightly ideals down a path regulated by the Church and characterized by Gregorian notions of the use of force, thereby reforming and consecrating knighthood.28 Thus, I disagree with Cerrini’s claim that the Templars were seeking to restore and democratize sacred kingship, albeit in a different form, working against the reform effort to desacralize the laity.29 What the Gregorians took away with one hand, they gave back with the other: the opportunity for the laity to obtain spiritual rewards through participating in holy warfare. Church reform, crusade, and recruitment to the Temple would often go hand in hand in Europe.30 The Templars, like their lay counterparts, constituted a defined group with a distinct ethos, but the milieu of these ecclesiastical knights would be the cloister rather than the court.31 They were inspired by the monastic ideal of imitatio Christi that had penetrated their world both in Europe and throughout the course of the First Crusade.32 They also drew heavily on the Maccabees and other Old Testament figures to articulate a warrior spirituality.33 The opening of the Templar Rule blends the Rule of Benedict with knighthood: We speak firstly to all those who secretly despise their own will and desire with a pure heart to serve the sovereign king as a knight and with studious care desire to wear, and wear permanently, the very noble armour of obedience.34 Cerrini’s study of the Templar Rule shows how thoroughly imbued it is with the language and spirit of knighthood.35 The trajectory of ­development\n\nS N L 23\n\n24 Foundations from the first stirrings of knightly piety in Europe to the foundation of the Templars can be characterized as an ascent of states of life. First, there was the conversion from worldly knighthood and its wickedness to the service of Christ, primarily through prayer and fasting, pilgrimage, and taking the habit before death. Then the exercise of arms itself, if properly directed, was articulated by Pope Gregory and other reformers as a true way of serving God. In preaching the First Crusade, Urban II offered a concrete enterprise whose spiritual merit was ensured because it was directed by the Church and it involved the profession of a temporary vow. For the knight who wanted to permanently consecrate himself to the exercise of arms according to the new crusade spirituality, the Templars offered just such a way of life.36 The articulation of this spiritual theology took place in the context of the urgent practical necessities of the Crusader States, first in the protection of pilgrims and then in the defense of the entire region. The Templars began, as William of Tyre says, living according to the more canonichorum, but the Council of Troyes modified their customs, distancing them from the Canons of the Holy Sepulcher and drawing them closer to Benedictine observance. This owed to the Templars’ encounter with the preeminent churchman of the age, St. Bernard of Clairvaux.\n\nS N L 24\n\nSt. Bernard and the Templars While St. Bernard’s remarkable life cannot be treated in detail here, he was more responsible than anyone else for the rapid growth and success of the Cistercian Order.37 He also played a crucial, but often misunderstood, role in the founding of the Knights Templar.38 Along with Stephen Harding, he was present at the Council of Troyes and assisted with the drafting of the Templar Rule. Sometime between 1130 and 1136 Bernard also authored his treatise De laude novae militiae.39 Bernard was at first reluctant to write this work, as he knew rather little about the Temple before the Council of Troyes.40 One author sees in Bernard’s choice of title a deliberate effort to employ all the semantic complexity of the word militia, which can refer both to the conduct of war in the abstract and to the organization that wages war.41 De laude has been correctly read as a full-blown apology for the legitimate and even laudable use of force in the service of God. Some historians have also read the work as an endorsement of the warrior monk.42 Yet Carlos de Ayala Martínez has persuasively argued that St. Bernard, both in De laude and in his other writings, was thoroughly traditional in his conception of\n\nFoundations 25 the monastic life.43 Rather than inventing the concept of the warrior monk, he promoted the Templars as a model of ecclesiastical knighthood. The first four chapters of De laude are an apology for the “new knighthood” that the Templars represented, and the latter nine are meditations on the various holy sites of Jerusalem. What is the work’s message? It must be admitted that two passages do appear to endorse the idea of the warrior monk: When someone strongly resists a foe in the flesh, relying solely on the strength of the flesh, I would hardly remark it, since this is common enough. And when war is waged by spiritual strength against vices or demons, this, too, is nothing remarkable, praiseworthy as it is, for the world is full of monks. But when the one sees a man powerfully girding himself with both swords and nobly marking his belt, who would not consider it worthy of all wonder, the more so since it has been hitherto unknown?44 I do not know if it would be more appropriate to refer to them as monks or as soldiers, unless perhaps it would be better to recognize them as being both. Indeed they lack neither monastic meekness nor military might.45 Tempting as they are, these statements must be regarded as rhetorical. The main thrust of the first four chapters is twofold: first, to lay out a model of a new knighthood, in contrast to the wickedness of worldly knighthood; second, to identify the Templars with the former group. “This is, I say, a new kind of knighthood and one unknown to the ages gone by. It ceaselessly wages a twofold war both against flesh and blood and against a spiritual army of evil in the heavens.”46 For Bernard, it was essential that the new knights be dedicated not only to temporal warfare but also to the battle against sin and vice represented by the fallen angels. He dedicates his second chapter to excoriating the vices of worldly knighthood, using the familiar identification of militia and malitia.47 He chastises the knights’ vanity, their wrath, their “terrible insecurity of conscience,” all of which lead them “to take such a dangerous business on such slight and frivolous grounds.”48 These were well-established tropes and represented no innovation on Bernard’s part.49 Chapter 3 offers a contrasting image of the knight of Christ, who “may strike with confidence and die yet more confidently, for he serves Christ\n\nS N L 25\n\n26 Foundations\n\nS N L 26\n\nwhen he strikes and serves himself when he falls.”50 He is “secure on every side, for his soul is protected by the armor of faith just as his body is protected by the armor of steel.”51 The principal difference between him and the worldly knight is his faith and the right intention of his heart. Bernard answers objections against the use of force with copious references to Scripture. This line of argumentation was merely following the trajectory of thought on holy warfare that the Gregorian Reformers and crusading had already launched. But Chapter 4, titled “De conversatione militum templi,” does offer something novel: the identification of the Templars with the new knighthood. The Templars are praised in terms highly reminiscent of monasticism: their discipline, their self-renunciation, and their poverty are all sublime; there is no distinction of persons between them; they keep their hair short in accordance with the apostle’s saying; they arm themselves with faith and steel rather than with gold.52 This was a highly idealized picture, as Bernard had never seen them in action.53 Applying the dichotomy of good and bad knights specifically to the Templars is the principal innovation of De laude.54 What explains Bernard’s special esteem for the new order as a model of true knighthood? William Purkis and Malcolm Barber have argued that, in Bernard’s view, their status as professed religious allowed the Templars to go beyond the elementary piety of ordinary knights and crusaders to a deeper spiritual life centered on Jerusalem.55 These historians therefore view the second half of De laude, which contains the meditations on the holy sites of the life of Christ, as a devotional manual for the Templars.56 Their consecrated life made them, in his view, the real inheritors of the warrior spirituality of the First Crusade. De laude, therefore, is addressed to a new kind of knight rather than a new kind of monk.57 This point is all the more apparent upon further examination of Bernard’s understanding of the monastic life, in which there was no place for the mobility or temporal warfare that the Templar vocation entailed. In 1124, Arnold, Abbot of Morimond, proposed to abandon his monastery and take the majority of his monks to Jerusalem to establish a new community there. Morimond was in a state of crisis, and Arnold did not have the approval of the Cistercian general chapter for this action.58 When he learned of the proposal, Bernard showed himself resolutely opposed and coordinated an effort to block it, on the grounds that it violated the vows of obedience and stabilitas loci that were essential to the Cistercian monastic life.59 He asked\n\nFoundations 27 “who does not perceive that in that land [Jerusalem] is more need of soldiers to fight than of monks to sing or pray?”60 Bernard backed up his words with deeds when he rejected King Baldwin II’s donation of land near Jerusalem for the construction of a community, giving it instead to the Premonstratensians.61 Clearly, he thought that monks should be dedicated to prayer and not to combat, a view also evident in his discomfort with preaching the Second Crusade.62 Even after he had undertaken this endeavor, he found it necessary, in 1147, to dissuade some Cistercians who wanted more direct participation in the struggle for the earthly Jerusalem.63 He compares them to Abi’ram and Dathan, who were swallowed up by the earth for murmuring against Moses, and castigates their desire to take the cross when they already bore it in their monastic life.64 These were no idle words: Bernard invokes the authority of the Apostolic See that any Cistercian who joined a crusade would be excommunicated.65 This opposition echoes in the Cistercian general chapter of 1157 as well, which determined that monks who had gone to Jerusalem were to be banished to another community.66 For Bernard, Clairvaux was the true prefigurement of the heavenly Jerusalem, as he writes in a letter praising the canon Philip’s decision to forsake his pilgrimage to the East in favor of entering Clairvaux.67 As Jotischky says, “The settlement of monks in the Holy Land was seen as detracting from the fundamental vocation of monasticism.”68 Bernard’s understanding of the monastic vocation was, in this respect, the same as what his predecessors had handed down to him.69 It was good to become a crusader or a Templar, but it was better still to become a monk.70 This was the same view held by Bernard’s contemporary Peter the Venerable, who once wrote a letter praising the Templars and comparing them to monks, as Bernard had done in De laude.71 Yet in the same letter, and in another addressed to the pope, Peter makes it clear that the Templars are not monks and do not follow, strictly speaking, a monastic life.72 For both men, monasticism excluded, by definition, constant mobility and participation in worldly combat.73 There is no question that St. Bernard wished to fully support the new Templar Order, that he saw in it both a practical tool for the defense of Christendom and a way to sanctification for pious knights. But he is not responsible for the concept of the warrior monk, and as I will argue further on, he might have balked at certain subsequent developments within the military-religious vocation.74 Thus, Bernard, pace Cardini, represents the “ascetic” strand of reform thought, which resisted the idea of finding salvation outside the\n\nS N L 27\n\n28 Foundations monastery, only to the degree that he wished to preserve the monastic vocation in its proper integrity. His endorsement of the Temple identifies him closely with the “Gregorian” strand, which encouraged the exercise of arms in service of the Church; but the men who undertook this task could not at the same time be “perfect monks.”75 Bernard’s treatise did not address, let alone refute, all the objections raised against the new knighthood, and it is fair to think that he might have shared some of those objections had he lived longer.76\n\nS N L 28\n\nExpansion and Criticism of the Templars After the Council of Troyes, the Temple was highly successful in obtaining recruits and donations throughout the Holy Land and Europe.77 The papacy lent its full support in a series of three bulls: Omne datum optimum (1139), Milites Templi (1144), and Militia Dei (1145).78 In addition to affirming the order’s mission and legitimacy in the strongest terms, these documents also exempted it from the payment of tithes, allowed it to keep any spoils obtained from the Muslims, granted indulgences to the faithful who made contributions, and allowed for the erection of oratories.79 These bulls were crucial for obtaining the support of pious laymen, for only at this point did the Temple enjoy the exemptions, privileges, and authority to provide spiritual assistance.80 For the first time, the Templars were allowed to have their own priests, who were to be subject to the master, as full members of the order. The bulls also explicitly refer to the Templars as imitators of Christ, in their reference to John 15:13, a favorite scriptural passage of crusade spirituality.81 Through the middle decades of the twelfth century, then, the order was amassing riches of many kinds, as well as expanding its responsibilities from protecting pilgrims to defending the entire Latin East. It was also undergoing an elaboration of its disciplinary regime. The original Rule of seventy-two clauses, composed and edited at Troyes in 1129, was inadequate to the order’s growing responsibilities. Additional statutes, written in French and known as the retrais, were issued sometime in the second half of the twelfth century to regulate the order’s offices, penances, and conventual life.82 Yet the order’s growth and favor invited criticism. The well-known complaints of John of Salisbury and William of Tyre are best understood as objections to the papal extension of ecclesiastical jurisdiction, especially over churches and priests, of men who were fundamentally knights.83 For\n\nFoundations 29 these members of the secular clergy, the Templars’ privileges represented a confusion of proper roles within Christian society. Walter Map, who wrote in a similar vein, also makes a brief objection to the military-religious profession as such.84 Isaac of Stella, in referring to the “new knighthood” as a “new monstrosity” and “the Order of the Fifth Gospel,” voices some of the doubt concerning crusading spirituality that could still be heard in Europe.85 These critiques did not necessarily undermine the Templars’ popularity, but they did reveal the hybrid nature of the vocation and the tensions that flowed from it.86 The Templars always occupied an ambiguous place in any schema of medieval society, which fueled the criticism they faced from time to time. If, as I have argued, the Templars were fundamentally knights, then the papal expansion of their ecclesiastical jurisdiction, especially over churches and priests, would naturally invite objections from clerical or monastic writers who saw this as a confusion of proper roles. Of course, it was the king of France, rather than clerical and monastic critics, who in the end posed the real threat to the Templars.\n\nThe Hospitallers One of the strongest objections to the concept of ecclesiastical knighthood is that it does not apply to the other great military order founded in the Latin East, the Knights Hospitaller. The impetus for the order’s establishment had little to do with knightly piety or crusade spirituality. Originally founded to care for poor and sick pilgrims in Jerusalem, the order underwent militarization during the twelfth century. This remains a difficult historiographical problem because of the conflicting nature of the evidence. One must distinguish, first of all, between the order’s assumption of military responsibilities, which may have been contracted to servants or mercenaries, and the participation of professed brethren in combat. Alan Forey thinks that there is sound evidence for the former by the 1130s, because at that time the order began to receive important fortresses.87 Members of the Hospital were present at several major battles in both the Holy Land and Iberia in the 1140s, which suggests that they were engaged in combat.88 Yet the Rule of 1153 makes no mention of this activity. The first clear references to military officers date from the 1160s, and they do not appear in capitular decrees until 1182.89 Circa 1178–1180 Pope Alexander III (1159–1181) warned the Hospital not to abandon the care of the sick, its principal commitment,\n\nS N L 29\n\n30 Foundations\n\nS N L 30\n\nfor the sake of fighting.90 During and after the Third Crusade, the order witnessed a dramatic expansion of its military activity, although it did not abandon hospitaller work.91 Rather, the Hospital presented fighting as an extension of its existing charitable efforts.92 Modern historians, such as Luis García-Guijarro Ramos and Helen Nicholson, warn against presuming a deep cleavage between military and hospitaller activities, a mind-set not characteristic of the twelfth century.93 García-Guijarro Ramos believes that militarization was neither so dramatic nor so sudden as some historians have supposed, which partially explains the murkiness of the documentary record. Fighting and caring for the sick were different manifestations of the same service, and popes recognized the elastic nature of the activities undertaken in that service, given the special circumstances of the Holy Land.94 These observations, while apropos, are not entirely satisfactory. Jonathan Riley-Smith’s recent monograph on the Hospitallers sheds some additional light on the problem. His narrative of the order’s militarization does not settle, once and for all, when and to what extent the process came about. Riley-Smith does identify, however, an aggressive attempt by Master Gilbert of Assailly, elected in 1163, to transform the Hospital through the purchase and building of castles and the adoption of militaristic rhetoric. This attempt to reorganize the Hospitallers along lines that were more akin to the Temple met with strong resistance from many of the order’s members, such that it ultimately failed.95 By the 1180s, the Hospitallers were articulating their warfare in terms of “a symbiotic relationship to the care of the sick poor.”96 These events highlight an important point. Twelfth-century writers could endorse the fairly novel view of warfare as an act of love. They could not, however, so readily accept the participation of monks or canons in combat. The attitude of St. Bernard, Peter the Venerable, and others has already been made clear: the fight against powers and principalities through prayer and fasting was superior to the fight against flesh and blood by the sword. They endorsed the Temple because it aimed to renew and convert knighthood from malitia to a true militia of Christ. It was laudable for a man to turn from sin to righteousness, or to ascend from one state of life to a more perfect one. No justification could be offered, however, for descending to a less perfect state. Even before their militarization, the Hospitallers were pioneering a new way of life with a more active commitment in the world.97 But while the Hospitallers were never traditional monks properly speaking, the shedding of blood would have unquestionably been regarded\n\nFoundations 31 as a deviation from their original purity. They could not, therefore, employ the Templars’ language about the conversion of knighthood, because their transformation took them, in terms of spiritual theology, from a higher to a lower way of life. Such a move could not be justified according to any of the various schemas of Christian states of life or the orders of society.98 It is true that such schemas were many and contradictory, that they were still being developed even in the late twelfth century, and that nothing like consensus was ever achieved.99 Most writers, however, continued to assert the superiority of the priestly or religious life.100 Arguing from the absence of evidence is always risky, but I suspect that the hesitant nature of the Hospital’s militarization, as well as the strong opposition to the initiatives of Assailly, owes primarily to the order’s inability and unwillingness to frame these developments within the spiritual doctrine of its day. Recent research has shown how Hospitaller foundation narratives through the end of the thirteenth century emphasize a fabled connection to Christ and the apostles, and to the care of the sick, rather than the exercise of arms.101 Although the dire situation in the Latin East after the Battle of Hattin gave impetus to a new wave of castle construction and other military preparations, the fact that the Hospital felt the need in 1217 to ask Honorius III for crusade indulgences for its brothers and supporters underscores the order’s misgivings and hesitancy.102 Militarization was largely a response to practical necessity, and when the order did at last speak of it, it presented militarization as an extension of existing charitable activities, not as the conversion of knighthood.103 This admittedly renders the term “ecclesiastical knighthood” problematic with reference to the Hospital. Although by the late twelfth century the Order of St. John had assumed military commitments that rivaled or even surpassed its care of the sick, the latter was primary in the Hospitallers’ institutional memory and practice, at least prior to their relocation to Rhodes.104 This tied the Hospital, despite its militarization, more closely to the mainstream of religious life. Not by accident do the Hospitallers boast of canonized saints (none of them knightly brethren), whereas the other military orders do not.105 Given the source problems and the complexity of the Hospital’s self-understanding, these proposals are preliminary and mean to suggest possibilities for further research.106 The Hospital, like the Temple, faced some criticism from contemporaries, but it seems that the problem of its transformation went mostly ­unacknowledged. This may have owed to the duration and ambiguity of\n\nS N L 31\n\n32 Foundations the process, which must have escaped the notice of most observers, just as it has eluded the investigations of modern historians. After the Third Crusade, when the order’s military endeavors dramatically increased, the situation in the Holy Land was too dire for anyone to complain. Writers instead critiqued the order’s privileges, or its pride, or its wealth. In other words, the Hospital was seen in much the same light as the Temple.107 Alongside these remarks was praise of its military valor or its commitment to the care of the sick.108 The Hospital thus became a very successful military order on the same scale as the Temple, but with a different self-understanding.\n\nThe Iberian Military Orders: Background\n\nS N L 32\n\n“Reconquest” and Crusade The military-religious life took root not only in the Holy Land, but also in the Iberian Peninsula, the medieval history of which has for some time been dominated by a key concept: the Reconquest.109 In the past several decades, this term has come under considerable criticism and has begun to fade from textbooks, although it still has its defenders. While Martín Ríos Saloma has shown that the concept was consolidated only in the nineteenth century, some contemporary Iberian medievalists have continued to use the term to describe the gradual and deliberate Christian takeover of Muslim territory in the peninsula.110 Despite its late emergence, I do not think that “Reconquest” is so problematic that it should not be used as shorthand, which I do throughout this study. A few points concerning this complex topic will suffice. Although it is true that the contest for Iberia between Christians and Muslims dates all the way back to 711, it is also true that the articulation of this conflict as a systematic and religiously or ideologically motivated campaign is ephemeral prior to the eleventh century, and that material gain was often a more important motive than religion.111 Christians and Muslims frequently allied with one another against their respective coreligionists.112 This situation changed significantly from the latter half of the eleventh century, posing for scholars the question of the relationship between Reconquest and crusade. Three main issues have dominated: when and to what degree the Christian-Muslim wars in Iberia acquired religious and ideological overtones; whether those overtones were primarily the result of outside influences or developments within the peninsula; and whether the campaigns of the late eleventh and early twelfth\n\nFoundations 33 centuries should be designated as holy wars, crusades, or proto-crusades. One reason the genesis of crusading in Iberia is difficult to pin down is that, unlike in the Latin East, there was no clear association with pilgrimage; Santiago de Compostela was not the ultimate destination for crusaders to Iberia.113 The evidence for a robust Reconquest ideology or commitment to holy war on the Christian side is rather weak even for the second half of the eleventh-century, as Richard Fletcher’s analysis of charters and chronicles of this period has demonstrated.114 O’Callaghan maintains, however, that the idea of Reconquest, though perhaps not always tangible in the sources, “was nevertheless real in that it influenced the actions of Spanish kings and princes.”115 Yet the idea took root only gradually and often went hand in hand with the more immediate objectives of spoils or land. By the 1120s, the notions of Reconquest and crusade in Iberia became more explicit; by the 1140s, they were still more so.116 The evidence suggest that influences from across the Pyrenees after the mid-eleventh century were more important than local religion or politics in stimulating ideological motivations for warfare.117 This argument has received additional support from Purkis’s investigations, which have demonstrated the enthusiastic response of Iberians to Urban II’s summons of 1095, and the persistent difficulties that the papacy faced in convincing them to stay at home.118 The popes of the early twelfth century, seeking to redirect this crusading enthusiasm, began recognizing campaigns against the Iberian Muslims as crusades and offering the same rewards and privileges to participants.119 Canon 10 of the First Lateran Council discusses the obligations of those who take the cross and make a vow to go to Jerusalem or Spain, thus equating the two destinations with each other.120 Even after 1123, however, the war against the Moors continued to be justified in terms of defending the Holy City. Diego Gelmírez, in a council held at Compostela in 1124, proclaimed a campaign to defeat the Muslims in Iberia and North Africa and thereby open up a “shorter” route to Jerusalem.121 This concept remained attractive at least until the time of the Second Crusade, when at last a local crusading ideology became well established. This owed to the renewal of military efforts under Alfonso VII as well as the dissemination of the Codex Calixtinus, which helped transform St. James into a patron of Reconquest and crusade.122 Perhaps the label “holy wars” can be used for the Iberian campaigns, such as Barbastro and Tarragona, from the late eleventh century, but I follow most historians in ­rejecting the term “crusades,” because Urban’s call of 1095 combined\n\nS N L 33\n\n34 Foundations\n\nS N L 34\n\npenance, warfare, and pilgrimage to Jerusalem in a novel way.123 Whatever names are used, however, it is important to remember that Reconquest and crusade were fluid concepts and practices, subject to change over time and variably invoked.124 Political necessity, the desire for gain, and the pursuit of salvation were often combined in complex ways. The development of knighthood also took a somewhat different course in the Iberian Peninsula than it did north of the Pyrenees. While in France shifting relations of power and lordship, the Peace and Truce of God, and new piety were crucial factors, in Iberia the frontier was the central reality. On the one hand, the need for mounted warriors and the phenomenon of castellation already had a pedigree in Iberia long before the late eleventh century. On the other hand, the nature of the frontier conflict as “Reconquest and crusade” was significantly altered by outside influences, which in turn had important consequences for the development of Iberian knighthood. Many of the characteristic features of the new French knighthood were imported, but slowly. For example, the great families of Castile-León did not begin to use heraldic devices until the very end of the twelfth century.125 The development of chivalrous culture properly speaking likewise took longer and was mostly based on French models, but with a certain local flavor. Rodríguez-Velasco dates the earliest interest of the Castilian monarchy in the institution of chivalry to the reign of Alfonso VIII (coinciding with the Cantar de mio Cid), and says that only with the Siete Partidas of Alfonso X was it incorporated into a legal framework.126 In general, the practical necessities of warfare in Iberia weakened the exclusive link between nobility and the exercise of arms.127 This reality was most apparent in the existence of the caballeros villanos, or non-noble knights, whose military, political, and social role on the frontier was crucial. Knighthood in Iberia, then, has a long trajectory of development, consisting of both internal and external influences, that is often difficult to follow because of the scarcity and ambiguity of the evidence, especially before the time of Alfonso VIII.128 It must be regarded as a rather flexible category for which the exercise of arms was the crucial factor. The contest of Christians and Muslims, newly invigorated by injections of religious fervor from abroad, proceeded apace during the twelfth century. The Almoravids, a reformist and warlike group from North Africa, had taken up the Islamic cause from the time of Alfonso VI. By about 1150, five Iberian Christian polities had emerged that would abide for the remainder\n\nFoundations 35 of the Middle Ages: León, Castile, Navarre, Portugal, and the Crown of Aragon. Around the same time, the Almohads, another North African power, supplanted the Almoravids as masters of Al-Andalus. Each of the Christian kingdoms pursued its own Reconquest, sometimes in cooperation, most often in conflict, with the others. Such were the circumstances in Iberia when the military orders first appeared on the scene.\n\nTemplars and Hospitallers Early in their history, the Templars and Hospitallers came to Iberia, where they encountered a new set of expectations. Their goal was to acquire land and other donations to support their efforts in the Holy Land, but Iberian monarchs wanted assistance with their own campaigns. The first Iberian donation to the Temple dates from 1128, in Portugal, and the order enjoyed early success there and in Aragon and Catalonia, acquiring donations throughout the 1130s.129 The Hospital was present from an even earlier time.130 Ramón Berenguer III entered the Templars in 1131, and that same year witnessed the extraordinary will of Alfonso I, who left his realms to the Temple, the Hospital, and the Canons of the Holy Sepulcher.131 Although the terms of the will were not carried out, the orders were handsomely compensated, which made them major landowners in Aragon and Catalonia.132 In Castile and León, by contrast, the Temple did not establish itself until much later; its earliest donations date from the 1140s.133 The royal family under Alfonso VII was fairly generous to the Hospital, but much less so to the Temple.134 Yet even the Hospital remained much less significant in León or Castile than it was in the Crown of Aragon. This was an important factor in the foundation and subsequent success of Santiago, Calatrava, and Alcántara. Iberian monarchs saw that the universal orders, whose principal interests lay in the Holy Land, were less than ideal for the pursuit of the Reconquest. Alfonso I of Aragon, a crusader par excellence, was the first Iberian monarch to experiment with creating local forces. He was responsible for the foundation of two pious military confraternities, Belchite and Monreal, around 1122 and 1128, respectively.135 They offered the remission of sins to anyone who joined and proclaimed their intent to follow the iter per Hispaniam to Jerusalem.136 These organizations were not military orders properly speaking, and their existence was ephemeral. Alfonso’s decision, moreover, to name the Templars and Hospitallers as heirs to his kingdom reduced\n\nS N L 35\n\n36 Foundations the opportunity for local foundations. In midcentury León and Castile, by contrast, there were relatively few Templar or Hospitaller holdings. Instead, there were a number of military confraternities and urban militias, which were exclusively dedicated to fighting in the peninsula and closely bound to royal authority.137 These groups, as well as the Temple and the Hospital, became models for the Iberian military orders.138\n\nCalatrava\n\nS N L 36\n\nThe Historia de rebus Hispaniae of Rodrigo Jiménez de Rada, archbishop of Toledo, is the primary source for the origins of Calatrava.139 In 1158, the Templars alerted the Castilian King Sancho III (1157–1158) that they had insufficient resources to hold the border fortress of Calatrava against an impending Almohad attack. The king was alarmed, as the fortress, located on the Guadiana River, was a strategic location vital to the security of Toledo. The fortunate presence of Raymond, the Cistercian abbot of Fitero, and his monk Diego Velázquez, provided the unlikely solution to the problem. Diego had been a knight prior to his entrance into the Cistercians, and he suggested that his abbot accept responsibility for the fortress, which Diego and others would then defend. The request was granted, and the castle and town of Calatrava were donated to Raymond.140 Juan, archbishop of Toledo, offered indulgences and aid to anyone who would come to its defense. There was a great outpouring of recruits and material assistance for the endeavor, and divine favor was demonstrated when the Muslim army never arrived. The abbot moved to Calatrava, bringing along the other monks of Fitero (except the aged and infirm) and their movable goods, to establish a new community. He also brought a “multitude of warriors,” for whose maintenance he took responsibility.141 There are numerous problems with Jiménez de Rada’s account. In the first place, there is no diplomatic evidence for the original donation of Calatrava to the Templars, and on the basis of what is known about the itinerary of Sancho’s short reign, the meeting with Abbot Raymond must have taken place in 1157, and not in Toledo. The threat of an Almohad attack is not mentioned in any Muslim chronicle, and the king’s reliance on two Cistercian monks t"
