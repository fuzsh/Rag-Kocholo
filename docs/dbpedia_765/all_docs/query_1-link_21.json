        "text": "Introduction\n\nBy Kimberly Hursh and Allison Bigelow\n\nIn June, 1617, having been released from the Tower of London in March of the previous year, Walter Ralegh set sail from Plymouth, England, to the fabled land of El Dorado. In the first of many failures that would ultimately define the expedition, the fleet got only as far as County Cork, Ireland, where Ralegh’s men waited out a storm for the next two months. With a geographic imagination fueled by inter-imperial rivalry, Ralegh mapped stories of ancestral Inca gold, said to have been hidden by creator-gods like Wiracocha and an unnamed a deity covered in gold dust (“El dorado”), onto real spaces in Spanish America (Staller and Stross, 24). He sought counsel from Francis Bacon, the renowned natural historian and then-solicitor general who warned Ralegh in no uncertain terms that an attack on Spain’s silver galleons, or its mineral deposits on the mainland, would be understood as pure and indefensible piracy. Still, Ralegh convinced King James I/VI to support the expedition, and the fleet set sail from Ireland in late August, arriving in November at the Cayenne River, some 700 miles south of its intended destination. In the late afternoon of January 2, 1618, in San Tomé de la Guayana, Spanish tobacco growers, colonial officials, ordinary foot-soldiers, and their indigenous and African servants looked out across the banks of the Orinoco River to see two English ships and several smaller vessels dropping anchor opposite their town. This was the small fleet of Lawrence Keymis, a commander who sailed under Ralegh, who hoped to raise his own prospects in the eyes of the English court with a discovery on the scale of Cortez or Pizarro. After sounding the Orinoco, the English laid siege to the city, burned its primary buildings, looted its treasury, and took prisoner indigenous women, native men, and Spanish colonial officials.\n\nFor the next month English sailors and soldiers battled with Spanish squadrons, solicited friendships with indigenous communities, and reconnoitered the land, hoping to defeat the first, form alliances with the second, and discover the hidden wealth of the third. Spanish and English accounts of the timing of the sack vary, but according to the testimonies translated here, the English ships anchored around dusk, and the town’s artillerymen fired three shots in warning. Governor Palomeque, Antonio Berrío’s replacement as of 1615, attempted to secure the city, sending Captain Gerónimo de Grados with ten men to defend the walls, while at the same time leading eight men himself to defend the main plaza and the Iglesia Mayor. The English entered the town sometime after and succeeded in breaking through Grados’ line, where they engaged in the main plaza with Grados and Palomeque’s small forces. Ralegh’s eldest son, Wat, is said to have led the charge, and he was killed almost immediately. The superior numbers of the English overcame the Spanish, and Palomeque and two of his lieutenants, Arias Nieto and Juan Luís Monje, were killed and their dead bodies stripped naked. The residents of the town fled, with the exception of a crippled priest, three indigenous, Spanish-speaking women captured by the English, and a number of indigenous, mestizo, and black slaves.\n\nBy English accounts, Ralegh’s mission amounted to nothing more than a series of failures. Exhausted by twenty-nine days of fighting, with no mineral deposits or other sources of colonial wealth to show for their efforts, by March of 1618 most of the remaining English men departed for other parts of the New World. Ralegh, having lost his son, stayed in the Caribbean, fully convinced that he had somehow missed the mine that the 110-year old cacique Topiawari had informed him of during his first voyage to the region, nearly twenty-five years earlier. In Ralegh’s telling of that encounter, printed in his Discoverie of the Large, Rich and Bewtiful Empire of Guiana, the friendship was solidified by a formative exchange of English material objects and indigenous bodies. Ralegh gave the cacique emblems of Queen Elizabeth I, a virgin leader like those of the Amazons of the “Orenoque” region, hoping that they will align with the English because of their similar veneration of virginal rulers, and Topiawari sent a son, Cayoworaco, to accompany Ralegh on his return to England, one of the many indigenous peoples who crossed the Atlantic in the colonial period (Kupperman) and helped to create what the kinds of “entangled” European empires that characterized the early modern Atlantic world (Gould). But by June of 1618, defeated, disgraced in the eyes of the Crown, and grieving over the loss of his son, Ralegh returned home, where he was denounced for having violated the Treaty of London, a peace agreement negotiated between England and Spain in 1604. Ralegh argued that because Guayana was English territory he had not broken the spirit of the accord, but the English state disagreed. Beginning in October, the Privy Council conducted an investigation to determine the nature of the attack, and after interrogating sailors who had served alongside Ralegh, he was executed that year.\n\nSpanish sources understood the attack differently, and they conducted their own investigation into the matter. If English documents suggest half-hearted investment on the part of the monarchy, followed by an eager absolution of responsibility, Spanish sources show just how seriously Philip III took the threat of imperial rivalry in a region celebrated for its potential agricultural and mineral wealth. On August 29, 1618, Spanish colonial officials in San Tomé de la Guayana, present-day Ciudad Bolívar in eastern Venezuela, arrived at the fort to conduct witness interviews with townspeople who had been held hostage by the English during Ralegh’s sack of the city. The military captain Diego Martín de Baena, who had arrived in July with 25 or 30 soldiers to reinforce the Spanish troops in San Tome, was now tasked with this investigation. What were the English looking for, and what did they take? What military maneuvers did they use? Where did they go? Who did they talk to? How did the governor respond, and how did the people behave? These were the types of questions put to witnesses who had survived the attack and escaped from English captivity.\n\nThe testimonies of two of those witnesses, 49-year old Spanish treasurer García de Aguilar Truxillo and a Spanish-speaking Arawak woman, Juliana de Moxica, who was in her early 20s, remain extant and are translated here into English from the Spanish. In their depositions before colonial officials, Aguilar Truxillo and Moxica relate in great detail their very different experiences. Although these depositions were circumscribed by imperial legal protocols, such as the list of questions that was submitted to both witnesses (“interrogatorio”), and notaries who translated the speech of everyday life into learned conventions, Juliana de Moxica and García de Aguilar nevertheless use different vocabularies to describe the same events and people in different ways. As treasurer, Aguilar has access to highly valuable information, but Juliana’s position within the English camp, and as a cook and the bilingual wife of an American-born soldier, allows her to access and control information flows that connected colonial officials, Spanish-speaking English soldiers, enslaved Africans, and Arawak communities. In San Tomé, as in other colonial outposts, indigenous women acted as go-betweens who managed the networks of information to which they were privy precisely because of their marginalized positions as women, and their hybrid positions as culturally and linguistically bilingual women (Metcalf; Kaygay, 5). In this case, Juliana de Moxica and her fellow intermediaries were responsible for daily tasks like food preparation and clothes washing, ways of knowing and nodes of activities that brought them into private homes, public marketplaces, and to the riverbanks of the Orinoco, the arterial heart of the region.\n\nTaken together, these two testimonies reveal new insight into larger questions of inter-imperial rivalry in the Atlantic world, as well as the local particularities of colonial society, including rich descriptions of the household goods, weapons, and religious artifacts that wealthy landowners deposited in the Royal Treasury, along with a range of currencies, descriptions of indigenous foodways, and colonial designs on natural resources – maritime, mineral, and agricultural. To this better understanding of the material cultures and patterns of everyday life of inland Venezuela and Colombia, the testimonies also document the kinds of information networks that connected Spanish- and non-Spanish speaking indigenous, African, and mixed-race peoples to the currents of colonial power. We present these testimonies, in a Spanish-language transcription and a new translation into English, with the hope that students and scholars of the Early Americas Digital Archive will use them to find new ways of reading the colonial past.\n\nPublication history\n\nThis manuscript unfolds over several chronological frames. First, it tells the story of an English attack on a Spanish fort in January, 1618, according to witnesses who testified on August 29 and September 6 of that year. After taking depositions in San Tomé, royal notary Joan de Alcalá appended these two statements to the declaration of Geronimo de Grados, a 56-year old man who had led the Spanish charge on the night of the attack. Grados delivered his statement (“información”) on April 18, 1618, almost immediately after the English had been driven from the city. Unlike the other two witnesses, he was not held prisoner during the siege; in recognition of his military service he was appointed as interim governor while officials of the Real Audiencia of Santa Fe de Bogatá, then led by don Juan de Borja, found a replacement for governor Diego Palomeque y Acuña, who had died during the attack. They ultimately decided upon Fernando de Berrío y Oruña, a wealthy landholder who had served as governor from 1598-1612, at which point he removed to his private encomienda, as he explained in a letter that was read before the Council of the Indies on 4 December, 1619, “por no poderme sustentar en ella conforme a mi calidad” (because I could not sustain myself there in a way that accorded with my station; Venezuela Papers, Vol. VIII, British Library Western Manuscripts Collection, Add MS 36321, p. 123). Berrío, having successfully negotiated a new salary, was persuaded to return to public life, and he served as governor from 1619-1622, the year of his death.\n\nThis manuscript thus sits amid substantial changes in colonial Spanish political leadership along the Orinoco. As Berrío petitioned for the crown to recognize his service in defending Spain’s American territories and preventing rival empires from settling in the lands, colonial officials were faced with a dilemma. On the one hand, Guayana would remain vulnerable for as long as the governorship was unoccupied; on the other, the reward for realizing what Berrío called “este descubrimiento del dorado” (this discovery of El Dorado) was difficult to overlook. The real demands of governance along the Orinoco River competed with the potential payoff of gold mines in the interior, creating a political vacuum in eastern Venezuela.\n\nWhen witnesses testified to governor’s response to the English attack, the Real Audiencia placed those statements within a larger debate over the proper management and right governance of a region that belonged alternately to the jurisdiction of Santa Fe de Botogá and the Audiencia de Santo Domingo. The licenciado Antonio de Quiroga assembled testimonies from April, August, and September of 1618 and sent them to the Real Audiencia of Santa Fe, where oydores gathered on the afternoon of Friday, 21 December, to review the case. After reading the statements, along with Berrío’s petition, they ruled on 18 January, 1619, to release $2,000 ducados from the Royal Treasury, one-half of Berrío’s new salary. On 22 June of that year, royal notary Lope de Berunco Clavijo copied and corrected the documents to prepare a true copy (“se saco de los originales con los quales se corrigio y va verdadero,” BL Add MS 36321, p. 117).\n\nClavijo’s notarized copy is not the only extant version of the manuscript, however; the document circulated in three different forms in the seventeenth, eighteenth, and nineteenth centuries. In 1627, Fray Pedro Simón, a Franciscan priest then ministering to the people of the Nuevo Reyno de Granada, compiled a volume that was dedicated to Felipe IV and published by Domingo de la Yglesia in Cuenca under the title Primera parte de las noticias historiales de las conquistas de tierra firme en las Indias Occidentales (First part of the historical notices of the conquests of Terra Firme in the West Indies). Simón’s 671-page history, purchased by John Carter Brown in 1852 and currently held at the John Carter Brown Library in Providence, Rhode Island (USA), glosses the testimonies of García de Aguilar and Juliana de Moxica in the twenty-fifth chapter (pp. 642-645).\n\nThe eighteenth-century turn toward independence inspired a new account of Guayana. Book II, chapter 12 (pp. 185-193) of Fray Antonio Caulín’s Historia corográfica de la region de Orinoco (Corographic history of the region of Orinoco), dedicated to Carlos III and published in Madrid in 1779 by Juan de San Martín, official printer to the Secretary of State, includes an extensive description of the attack led by Keymis and attributed to Ralegh (“Gualtéro Reáli”). While this account mentions the military excellence of the alcalde García de Aguilar, Juliana de Moxica is never named. Instead, Caulín notes that García de Aguilar and his fellow captain, Juan de Lezama, were warned of the English attack “by an Indian woman who came from the direction where they had taken women, children, and sick people, which was the Caroní region” (“advertidos por una India del rumbo que habian tomado las mugeres, niños y enfermos, que fue el de Caroní,” p. 187). By the eighteenth-century telling of the story, then, during an era in which nationalist sentiment and regional identities were both uniting and dividing emerging republics of the Americas, Juliana de Moxica’s testimony had been erased from the printed record.\n\nIn the late nineteenth century, however, the documents surfaced again, this time in the context of a geopolitical dispute between English Guiana and the sovereign state of Venezuela. As reports of mineral wealth emerged once more, Venezuela challenged the legitimacy of British dominion in the Orinoco valley. In 1897, the Venezuelan government formally disolved diplomatic relations with England, and a five-person panel was convened to determine whether the mineral-rich lands belonged to Venezuela or English Guiana. Two judges from the United Kingdom represented English interests, while two judges from the United States represented Venezuela. (A fifth judge, a Russian academic of French heritage was considered neutral.) The late-nineteenth century border dispute thus placed the colonial conflict over Guayana in a new context: the seventeenth-century English-Spanish rivalry was now triangulated through the United States, a former British colony in North America that was keen to express its own emerging imperial power in the western hemisphere. Following a two-year study, the panel resolved on 3 October, 1899, to grant full possession to Venezuela (Cleveland, Toro).\n\nColonial documents from Spanish archives, primarily the Archivo General de Indias, in Sevilla, and the Archivo General de Simancas, in Valladolid, provided an important evidentiary standard in the case. In 1897, under the supervision of Pedro Torres Lanzas, then serving as director of the AGI, certified copies of key documents, including the testimonies of García de Aguilar Truxillo and Juliana de Moxica, were prepared for James Henry Reddan, a consular official stationed in Ciudad Bolívar on behalf of Great Britain. The original files were archived in Estante 54, Caja 4, Legajo 9 of the AGI. At the conclusion of the boundary arbitration, the English copies were stored in the British Museum before being transferred to the British Library, both in London. Today, those copies have been collected into a bound edition of manuscripts known as the Venezuela Papers, held as part of the Western Manuscripts Collection at the BL. As we worked from that copy, we tried to locate the original manuscript. Unfortunately, we were unable to do so. The AGI updated its classification system after the copies were made, meaning that Estante 54 no longer exists as a repository. Manuel Álvarez Casado of the AGI helpfully pointed us to the manuscript collection of the Audiencia de Santo Domingo, 187, the new home of the documents once filed under Estante 54. Based on dates contained within the manuscript, though, Álvarez Casado doubted that we would find the testimonies in that document. Citing a possible error in the transcription of the BL copies, he suggested instead the 604-folio compendium filed under the Audiencia de Santa Fe, 23, R.6, N.32, dated in 1638.\n\nOver the course of the semester, we worked through that 600-page file to try to locate the original testimonies. Allison Bigelow, of the Department of Spanish, Italian, and Portuguese at the University of Virginia, reviewed pages 1-302 and Kimberly Hursh, of the Corcoran Department of History at UVa, worked with pages 303-604. Unfortunately, we were unable to find the testimonies in that file. In other records, however, we found supporting evidence from García de Aguilar Truxillo in the form of a letter that he sent to royal officials in Spain, on 25 April, 1612, as part of his duties as alcalde (AGI, Santo Domingo 179, R.3, N.62). In Santo Domingo 187 we found several other letters from colonial officials, including the governors of Cumaná, such as Diego de Arroyo Daza (R.6, N.36, 13 June 1620; R.6, N.39, 14 October 1621; R.6, N.40, 1 April 1623; R.6, N.41, 15 April 1623) and Juan de Haro (R.5, N.32, 15 January 1618; R.5, N.33, 20 June 1618). A search for Antonio de Quiroga returned three results: a letter to colonial officials, sent on behalf of the Audiencia de Santa Fe on 12 June, 1619 (Santa Fe, 66, N. 108), a compilation of legal proceedings (“informaciones”) prepared in 1627 (Santa Fe, 133, N. 57), and a summary of judicial findings and surveys (“jueces y comisión de vista”), also prepared for the Audiencia de Santa Fe (Santa Fe, 193, N. 40). Although our first efforts were unsuccessful, we hope that by sharing our work with the community of students and scholars at the Early Americas Digital Archive, new light might be shed on this important manuscript.\n\nOurs is not the first time that this document has been translated into English, but there are several features that distinguish our work from the earlier translation of Vincent T. Harlow, a distinguished professor of English imperial history. In 1932, Harlow printed a run of some 775 copies of his translation of the Venezuela Papers. Following the boundary dispute by some 30 years, Harlow’s work, printed as Ralegh’s last voyage: being an account drawn out of contemporary letters and relations, both Spanish and English, of which the most part are now for the first time made public, concerning the voyage of Sir Walter Ralegh, knight, to Guiana in the year 1617 and the fatal consequences of the same (London: Argonaut), which included a reproduction of the plan of San Tomé, copied from the Spanish archive of Simancas, found a ready market among Anglophone readers. But the translation – like all translations – was a product of its time, and Harlow’s rendering of culturally-specific racial, ethnic, and gender classifications reflect the historical moment in which he worked. Thanks in large part to the excellent work of earlier scholars, we have a better understanding of the complexities of race and slavery in the early Americas. Whereas Harlow translated “mestizo” as “half-caste,” and “yndio puro” as “pure bred Indian” (202-3), we preferred “pure Indian,” and we have left the term “mestizo” in the original Spanish, with an explanatory note and a list of sources for further reading, written by Shaun Casey. What Harlow Englishes as “Guatemala Indian” (197), from the expression “Indio guatian del nuevo reino de granada,” we leave as “a Guatian Indian from the Nuevo Reino de Granada.” These terms are particularly important because one indigenous man tries to call himself “mestizo” when he enters the English camp, and he is nearly killed for it. Only when enslaved Africans insist that the man is an Indian do the English allow him to live; as one Spanish-speaking English sailor tells Juliana de Moxica, the English wanted to kill Spaniards, but they did not aim to hurt Indian women or men. Finally, Harlow translates two terms for indigenous boats – “piraguas” and “curiaras” as “war-canoes of Chaguanese Indians.” We find no evidence in the manuscript of military or war-like action on the part of the Chaguanes peoples in this passage, though they are certainly keen to capitalize on English-Spanish conflicts by confiscating material goods from the homes of Spanish residents. We have thus left both terms in the source language, as they are Hispanized forms of Carib words, and Katherine Lara’s translation (“there came a large number of piraguas and curiaras of Chaguanes Indians”) is followed by explanatory notes on the boats and the Chaguanes community.\n\nOn a larger scale, our translation preserves many of the unorthodox expressions that mark Juliana de Moxica as a bilingual Spanish-Arawak speaker. Harlow’s translation streamlines repetitive, seventeenth-century Spanish into concise, contemporary-sounding English, as in one section where Juliana de Moxica explains her interaction with Spanish-speaking English sailors: “who knew Spanish and talked with her” (201). Our version is admittedly less manageable: “according to what this witness knew from the Spanish-speaking English [ladinos] that spoke with this witness.” Likewise, Harlow’s more streamlined translation of geographic places, such as a spot “near the headland known as Aramaia’s Point” (193), facilitates comprehension but collapses important elements of the original text. In our translation, Allie Soroka opts for the longer “They went about discovering them by the point that they call Aramaia” to highlight the collective naming of space (“that they call”) and the windy narrative structure that performs the act of discovery (“they went about discovering”) as it was recalled and remembered by the speaker.\n\nBy preserving the discursive particularities of witness testimonies and standard legal expressions (“this witness knows”), our translation allows readers to identify moments of overlap and divergence in the stories told by García de Aguilar and Juliana de Moxica, and to read between the lines of legal discourse to hear witnesses speak in their own words. Our translation maintains the oral nature of testimony, including repetition, grammatical errors, unorthodox expressions, and discrepancies. We consider those markers of orality to be one of the strengths of our work; such moments allow important insight into the legal weight of spoken words, and the porous borders between speech and writing as evidentiary standards in colonial courts. They also afford a glimpse into the broader relationship between imperial law and everyday life as it unfolded in the colonies. In the example above, readers can see how Juliana de Moxica uses the same word to classify Spanish-speaking English men (ladinos) that colonial officials used for indigenous witnesses (ladino, ladina).\n\nBecause we have opted for a translation that reflects the discursive patterns of the period, our readers can see how these witnesses explain colonial transmissions of knowledge. Both García de Aguilar and Juliana de Moxica report on a Portuguese boy who was kidnapped by the English; García de Aguilar identifies him as “fourteen years old, more or less,” while Juliana de Moxica describes him in terms of visible changes to his body, “he was a boy whose first fine hairs were budding above the lip” (“que hera moço que le apuntaua el boso.”) These subtle differences also index the different relationship that each witness had to the boy. In her testimony, Juliana de Moxica refers to the Spanish as “los españoles,” as does García de Aguilar. But she uses a different word, “cristianos,” to describe how the Portuguese boy talks about Spaniards, offering a small glimpse into Iberian relations as they were filtered through an Arawak woman. Spanish speakers identify themselves by language and ethnicity, and bilingual agents like Juliana de Moxica follow this pattern. However, the Portuguese boy invokes a shared religious worldview to describe Spanish people in the region. These small differences are only appreciated with a translation that closely follows the language of the source text. We made these decisions as a group, with a collective methodology that we describe below.\n\nTranslation methods\n\nThe translation here presented was prepared in Fall, 2014, by undergraduate students in an upper-division seminar on colonial translation offered in the Department of Spanish, Italian, and Portuguese at the University of Virginia. For the first half of the semester, we studied the movements of indigenous, African, and European interpreters in four accounts of colonial encounter: Colón, Cabeza de Vaca, Díaz del Castillo, and the many histories of the conquest of New Spain related in Miguel León Portilla’s edited volume, Visión de los vencidos. These texts allowed us to understand the nature of colonial translation, the agencies of interpreters, and the habits of mind that shaped the colonial period. In the second half of the semester, after UVa archivist David Whitehall generously oriented us to rare books research in the Albert and Shirley Small Special Collections Library, we took a hands-on approach to colonial translation. We divided the pages of MS 36321 evenly, with each student taking responsibility for the transcription, translation, and annotation of one folio page. Kimberly Hursh, a PhD candidate in colonial Latin American history, translated a portion of the manuscript, conducted additional research, recorded minutes from translation workshops, and collaborated heavily in the writing of this introduction. For her excellent work, we are immensely grateful.\n\nOver the course of the next six weeks, we came together to workshop ideas, strategies, and challenges, and to establish a consistent approach throughout the manuscript. Generally, we worked to strike a balance between clarity to our readers and fidelity to the text, debating when and how to translate historically-specific terms or leave them in the source language, when to clarify the text and when to preserve its original ambiguities, and when to add explanatory footnotes to guide our readers. We brainstormed ways to translate a particular term, such as “yndias ladinas,” and we used a process of elimination to work through three possibilities: to leave the term in the original Spanish (“yndias ladinas”), leave it in Spanish but write it with modern orthography (“indias ladinas”), translate it partially (“Indian ladinas,” “ladina Indians,”) or translate the concept (“Spanish-speaking Indian women”). This slow process of consensus building forced us to think carefully about our approach to the translation of historical documents, and the ways in which interlocking genres of legal discourse, history, and imaginative fiction shaped our practices of translation. When we could find an English equivalent for the Spanish, we translated the names of institutions in full (e.g., “Caja Real” as “Royal Treasury”). When we were unable to convey the cultural specificities of the original phrase, we left terms in the source language and provided sources for further reference in an accompanying footnote (e.g., Iglesia Mayor, alcalde, Real Hacienda). We took special care with the many Carib and Arawak words that find their way into the document, sometimes through colonial officials who describe indigenous fishing and navigational practices, and sometimes through indigenous peoples themselves. Those considerations are detailed below.\n\nNew light in Orinoco\n\nOne of the most striking elements of the manuscript is its yoking together the testimonies of an established colonial official and a young Arawak woman. The larger question of English-Spanish rivalry and imperial fashioning in the geographic imaginary of El Dorado has been studied in great detail (Oramas 1947), and recent scholarship has enlivened this longstanding area of inquiry (Sellin and Carlisle 2011; Britton 2011; Voigt 2009; Schmidt 2008; Fuchs 2001; Lovera 1991; Lemmon 1986). While a shared desire for control of natural resources animated both the English and the Spanish imperial projects, the nature of these interconnected empires goes beyond material goods. As the English simultaneously admired and rejected Spanish precedent in the Americas, both groups produced what Elijah Gould calls “interconnected,” “intertwined” reciprocal processes through which they defined themselves (766). In the spatial imaginary of imperial modeling, English apologists suggested that Spanish cruelty toward the Indians justified a new kind of empire. Early-seventeenth century Spanish reports from London showed how this popular idea circulated within the Stewart monarchy, as Ralegh, then imprisoned in the Tower, made it known that his indigenous informants were reluctant to reveal El Dorado’s mineral wealth “por miedo de los Españoles” or “because they feared the Spanish” (Biblioteca Nacional, Madrid, MSS/18684/18, “Documentos sobre Walter Raleigh y sus piraterías en la Guayana,” pp. 10-11). Meanwhile, multiple translations of Bartolomé de las Casas’s Brevissíma relación de la destrucción de las Indias (Antwerp, 1579; Lyon, 1582; London, 1583; Amsterdam, 1596) allowed a critique designed for an internal audience of royal readers to be enlisted in a range of political disputes, from the revolt of the Dutch republics against the Spanish monarchy to the colonization of the New World.\n\nLargely absent from this established historiography on the Black Legend as it developed along the Orinoco, however, are the voices of indigenous Arawak and Carib peoples who brokered alliances with rival European empires – English, Spanish, Dutch, French, and Portuguese alike. Printed histories have always shown the movement of language and power across imperial lines in the contested region of Guayana, as demonstrated by texts like William Hamilton’s translation of Blaise Françoise de Pagan’s report of Ralegh’s expeditions (1660), and Spanish diplomatic reports on the English traffic in books, such as the prints of Theodor de Bry (“El libro de Theodoro de Brye haze mencion de todo esto como me lo ha dicho el Raley”) and Jan Janszoon Orliers’s Les lauriers de Nassau (Leyden, 1612), which the Spanish ambassador cites as evidence of Ralegh’s maritime incursions into Cadiz and America (“quien esta conocido por el mayor Marinero desta Corona como assaz lo aueriguan sus hazanas en las Indias, y quando dio en Cadis, como lo declara la historia llamada, Des lauriers de Nassau con otro historiador frances,” BN Madrid, MSS/18684/18, p. 4v). However, the oral transmission of knowledge has not been as readily apparent. This manuscript sheds important light on the agencies of indigenous women and men who managed sensitive transfers of information in an area whose political and linguistic boundaries were as fluid as the region’s alluvial mineral deposits. In addition to Spanish, English, Portuguese, Arawak, and Carib language and ethnic groups in Guayana, the manuscript references four other indigenous communities of the region: Morca, Chaguanes, Camahuya, and Guatian. Where possible, we have provided additional information on these communities, as well as sources for further reading.\n\nBecause the same notary recorded both of the testimonies here presented, and because the witnesses responded to some of the same questions of the interrogatorio, this manuscript allows us to compare how García de Aguilar Truxillo and Juliana de Moxica described the same people, places, and events in different ways. We also see, in this new English translation, how indigenous women gained access to English networks of information and how they transmitted messages to Spanish officials. While García de Aguilar was held prisoner in the church, Juliana de Moxica and her friend, identified only as Inés, were tasked with preparing arepas, or maize cakes, sometimes filled with meat or vegetables, for the English sailors. These two Arawak women effectively became the only source of food for the English and the prisoners; by controling the production and distribution of food, Juliana de Moxica and Inés became information hubs because everyone – English, indigenous, African, Spanish – came to see them. In her testimony, Juliana de Moxica reveals how these information networks operated.\n\nIn his testimony, meanwhile, García de Aguilar confirms what he learns from Juliana de Moxica and Inés. One such moment occurs in his response to the fourth question of the interrogatorio, when he describes two indigenous men who were taken prisoner, Cristóbal and Pedro Criollo. Cristóbal is identified as a Morca Indian who had served the Governor Diego Palomeque on his encomienda. Although García de Aguilar offers nothing other than “yndio morca,” Juliana de Moxica testifies that Cristóbal is from the Nuevo Reino de Granada (present-day Colombia), and specifically from the Valle de Somagoso (Sagamoso), some 34 miles from Tunja, as the crow flies. More interestingly, she testifies that Cristóbal tries to pass as a mestizo when he circulates among the English. Three enslaved Africans told the English that Cristóbal was entirely indigenous, or “yndio puro.” While García de Aguilar and Juliana de Moxica tell different versions of Cristóbal’s story, they provide the same details about the three enslaved Africans who went voluntarily from their masters, the widow Mencia Ruiz and the military official Pedro de Padilla. They also offer similar testimonies on the fate of Pedro Criollo, an indigenous man who had been held in chains by his master, the military captain Joan Ximénez. Once Cristóbal and Pedro de Padilla found themselves behind English lines, their fates diverged: Cristóbal was thrown in a boat, never heard from nor seen again, while Pedro Criollo walked unchained. While García de Aguilar reports that Pedro de Padilla was “well dressed,” Juliana de Moxica provides more elaborate testimony: he wore a hat and new shoes that a Spanish resident had left in his house when he fled, and he had the English call him “don Pedro” as he sat around their table. The details of their testimonies suggest that Juliana de Moxica had better access to information regarding the prisoners and their movements. García de Aguilar confirms in his own words that he learned these stories from the Indian women who had fled the English enemy (“supo este testigo de las yndias que se huyeron del enemigo”), although he does not name her.\n\nNative women were not the only source of information for colonial officials, though. In the fifth question, García de Aguilar explains what he learned from an Arawak man (“un yndio que vino de la dicha ysla de nación aruaca”) who was held prisoner on an English ship manned by a general named “Guatarreal,” or Walter Ralegh. English sources, such as the DNB entries for Ralegh and Keymis, insist that Ralegh stayed on the shores of the Essequibo River, while Keymis sailed up the Orinoco to attack the Spanish settlement. In his Second voyage to Guiana, Keymis noted the mobility of the Arawak people, and their ability to cultivate alliances with Spanish settlers, dismissively calling the community “a vagabound nation of Indians, which finding no certaine place of abode of their owne, do for the most part serue and follow the Spaniardes” (B2v). García de Aguilar, meanwhile, testified that the Arawak informant came from the Island of Trinidad with the captain Cristóbal de Cárdenas to inform the governors of Trinidad, Margarita, Cumaná, and Caracas of English activity in the region, including the English fleet’s having launched three boats that sailed from San Tomé to Mayquiagua, a Carib community that sat some 70 leagues outside of the Spanish military complex. Juliana de Moxica again provides more specific details: she names the man as the same Pedro Criollo who was taken by the English with Cristóbal, an “indio guatian,” and three indigenous women, including her. She is identified as the wife of American-born Spanish soldier Luis de Arce, while her companions are both named as servants of colonial officials. One is a servant of the Franciscan father Francisco de Leuro, and the other of the military captain Cristóbal de Cárdenas. Juliana de Moxica testified that Pedro Criollo went by boat to inform Ralegh of the death of his son, and that she knew this because Pedro Criollo had told her so.\n\nThese examples suggest how the English invasion of San Tomé allowed some indigenous people to take advantage of an upended social order and to position themselves with greater benefit within colonial society, sometimes by joining the English willingly, and sometimes by reporting to the Spanish what they had learned in their captivity. At other moments in their testimonies, we hear from García de Aguilar and Juliana de Moxica how indigenous, mixed-race, and African people moved between and among English captors and Spanish colonials, including military officials, government agents, and religious leaders. These stories of movement allow us to better understand the complex interactions of race and religion along the Orinoco River. More broadly, they suggest how indigenous women and men collaborated and competed with Spanish colonial officials and English imperial agents to control the flow of information in a place where the eastern edges of the Andes meet elaborate river networks that flow into the Atlantic world.\n\nTranslators\n\nAllison Bigelow, Mawusi Bridges, Shaun Casey, Julia Colopy, Eleanor Daugherty, Taylor Dorr, Mary Catherine Gibbs, Carly Gordon, Rebecca Graham, Alison Haulsee, Brynna Heflin, Kimberly Hursh, Lindsey Jones, Katherine Lara, Nathaniel Menninger, Sierra Prochna, Kyle Reitz, Blake Selph, Alexandra Soroka, Julia Sroba, Nora Zahn, Mary-Rolfe Zeller, Emily Zhang\n\nBibliography\n\nArchives\n\nArchivo General de Indias, Sevilla\n\nBiblioteca Nacional, Madrid\n\nBritish Library, London\n\nPrint Sources\n\nBritton, Dennis Austin. “Allegory and Difference in Ralegh and De Bry: Reading and Seeing the Discoverie.” Journal of Medieval and Early Modern Studies 41.1 (2011): 117 –136.\n\nCabeza de Vaca, Álvar Núñez.

Martin de Baena[2] in the presence of the aforementioned Lieutenant Governor presented as a witness the Captain Garcia de Aguilar Truxillo,[3] alcalde ordinario[4] and treasurer of the Real Hacienda[5] of the King, Our Lord, in this city and householder of it. Who, having been sworn in the form of law and being examined in accordance with the questions in the aforementioned ynterrogatorio[6] in the presence of the previously mentioned lieutenant and [end p. 67r] of the aforementioned Captain Diego Martin de Baena, who found himself present for this investigation, said the following:\n\nWith regards to the first question from the ynterrogatorio this witness said that what he knows of this question is that Friday, which was numbered the twelfth of the past month of January of this present year, at the hour of eleven in the morning, or a little before, the governor Diego Palomeque y Acuña[7] had been at that point where he warned them that there were boats that came from up river. Having perceived soldiers and a commander they went to reconnoiter them. They went about discovering them by the point that they call Aramaia,[8] which is two leagues from this city beneath the [end p. 67v] Orinoco River.[9] There were two large ships with sails, nine sails each, more or less around one hundred tons, and one caravel, and four boats,[10] and two vessels[11] that were destined for a cove which is one league below the city that is called Aruco.[12] After they arrived, they cast the people out to the land and raised the sail once again. The caravel, leaving the vessels in this said location, embarked towards this city until it was almost before this city of Santo Thome. There, they fired at them the two pieces of artillery that were in the city. One piece [end p. 68] fired twice, causing them to halt and drop anchor so that they could not pass beyond there. This occurred an hour after dusk. Later, the aforementioned governor had news from two men of the cavalry who were sent to survey the land as to how the enemy would come in return and march through the land to this city. And because it was so sudden a matter the said governor could not take any more precautions than he had already made – which had been putting four men in charge of the artillery, and two on the riverbank in case the enemy cast people from the ships to the land, and ten men at the entrance of the city, two shots of a musket in the direction where the enemy came marching from [end 68v], because there was a mountain that way, to impede them from the entrance, and four men on horseback to the savannah within eyeshot of enemy to see where they were coming from. He divided his men in two or more troops in order to enter in other ways. With the remaining 16 or 18 men and their firearms that were left to guard and block the incoming men from the entrance, the aforementioned governor was in the Plaça de Armas[13] awaiting the progress of the enemy against the men who had gone to to the path to guard and block the entrance. The aforementioned governor heeded the warning of one of those on horseback that the enemy was arriving. As the incoming men approached the [end p. 69] city, the fleet of previously mentioned soldiers accompanying the governor went to guard the Yglesia Mayor.[14] This is where the enemy entered. It was there – with said people in a crescent-shape formation[15] – when Captain Geronimo de Grados[16] arrived as the leader of the ten men who were concealed in ambush. He said, “Señor Gobernador, the enemy broke through our flanks and came with their best men by way of the house of Clemente Bernal.[17] Many men came.” And so the aforementioned governor said, “in accordance with this testimony, go Your Grace with eight comrades to the other part of the church while I follow [end p. 69v] captain Grados with the rest of the men.” And approaching the bulwark of the Church, we encountered the enemy where there was hand-to-hand fighting until the strength of the enemy forced us to retreat toward the guard room. All this happened from nine at night until midnight. There was constant fighting with the enemy until they won the city and it was seized. And they were in the city for twenty-nine days, from sunup to sundown. This is the truth and what is known of this question as a person that found himself then in this city. _______________ [end p. 70]\n\nTo the second question he said that since this witness removed to the other part of the church he did not see any more of the aforementioned Governor, except when they all grappled with the enemy. He was stricken down and did not appear again. On this occasion in the aforementioned encounter near the part where this witness was the enemies killed captain Arias Nieto[18] and captain Juan Rruyz Monje[19] and also wounded another two soldiers who have already healed from their injuries. After the English enemy had left this city and coming to rebuild this city we found the body of the aforementioned Governor and of [end p. 70v] Captain Juan Ruyz Monje, tied up one foot with the other, with head in a hole next to the Yglesia Mayor. That is towards the place where the said governor was turned upside down by the enemy, and his head was knifed open, split open from the top of his head to the jaw. And the witness knows this because he helped unearth the said body, where the aforementioned body was half covered, and he knew by the physiognomy of the face that it was the previously said Governor, and by the size of the body, because he was was a very heavy man, more than any in this city. And this responds to this question_____ [end p. 71]\n\nTo the third question he said what he has already mentioned in the question before this, with respect to the people who died in the taking of this city. And that as to what became of Father Francisco de Leuro,[20] this witness knows he stayed at home, his feet and hands crippled, and that did not have more than a sign of death. And after, the Indian women who were held by the power of the enemy, one of whom was in the servitude of the said Francsico de Leuro, knew how the enemy had passed from his own house to another and cured him with much care. And this witness knows how the enemy [end p. 71v] burned the house where the aforementioned Father Francisco de Leuro was, and the rest of the houses of this city, and here is where they all burned down. This he knows from having heard it from Captain Joan de Lezama,[21] whom he later found burned in the house, and he buried him and he responds to this question ———-\n\nTo the fourth question, he said that what he knows of this question, is that this witness as treasurer of the Real Hazienda knows there had been in the treasury in coined money up to six hundred reales,[22] and a bar of gold marked front and back and small marked pieces[23] that in total add up to two thousand reales. [end p.72] And more, in the aforementioned treasury, in deposit, is a gold chain that he does not recall how large it was nor how much it weighed beyond what he heard from Captain Geronimo de Grados, to whom the aforementioned chain in deposit belonged, worth one thousand and three hundred reales. And that it weighs one thousand and six hundred reales of gold. And additionally, there was a silver hand-basin[24] and a large silver plate[25] in deposit that he did not remember the amount that was in deposit nor what they weighed beyond what Francisco Venegas[26] had in the treasury. Also in deposit there were thirteen or fourteen [end p.72v] marks[27] of milled silver pieces [of eight] as security for what Doña Andrea Maria de Berrio[28] owed to the Royal Treasury according to an official notarial act.[29] In deposit in the Royal Treasury there was a stud[30] belonging to Captain Bernave de Brea[31] for fifty or sixty reales and it is not certain what the said stud’s weight was. And, as well, deposited in the Royal Treasury there was an eagle made of gold mounted onto an irregular pearl[32] and garnished with emeralds, it is not certain for what sum it was present nor what value it weighed but that it belonged to Francisco Vanegas.[33] Additionally, the Royal Treasury had two hundred axes in one chest and in the other, [end p. 73v] thirty iron axes and two hundred sheaths for butcher’s knives. Moreover, the Royal Treasury had twenty muskets and four arquebuses and six dismantled cannons and ten powder kegs filled with up to one thousand arquebus and musket balls and up to a quintal[34] of rope from Spain. Moreover, there were two artillery pieces that were in the fort at the riverbank of this Orinoco River and four pedreros[35] of those pedreros that were, the night that the enemy took said city, stationed at its ports and plaça de armas, and furthermore the Royal Treasury had [end p. 73v] as many as eighteen or nineteen bills of debt recording the condemnations that the governor Diego Palomeque made to the householders of this city in the residence that he took from them. The witness understands that they appealed to the council and they made him use the aforementioned bills of debt to secure the Royal Treasury. The said claims amounted to as many as seven hundred or eight hundred reales. He does not recall well the amount beyond what he has already said in this question, and that the English enemy took it. And this witness, as treasurer, together with the accountant of the Real Hacienda that day that the enemy appeared [end p. 74], requested that the said governor in the presence of witnesses and of the scribe would give them favor and help to put the Royal Treasury in safekeeping – who responded this: “This is my duty and I am the lord of it. Your Graces are not involved in this matter, for I am the lord and master[36] of it. Bring it to my house.” And they brought it to him and the said governor placed it in his chamber. And he knows that the archive where the papers of the local council and other rewards[37] was in the house of the said governor in a box fastened with two locks, and that the said governor had the one key, and the scribe of the local council had the other [end 74v]. And that this witness and his companion did not dare take the Royal Treasury and put it in safe keeping without his order because of an unsettled condition that the said governor had. And likewise the enemy took all the papers the scribe had in his desk without a single one escaping, nor did anything from his own hacienda escape the enemy’s sight, save for what he was already wearing. And his woman[38] and children did not take anything else. And that this witness knew that there were not more than four or six people that took some clothes from his wardrobe and they were the following. Captain Geronimo de Grados, Ana Pérez,[39] widow, Joan de Trillo,[40] Captain Joan de Lezama, Captain Cebrián Frontiño,[41] Hernán Gómez, Francisco Vanegas, Hernán Claros, Francisco Granados, Captain Pedro Sandos, and that these were the people that left more than what they took.[42] And all the other householders did not take anything at all and escaped with only their lives. They and their wives and children were wearing fine silver jewelry and white clothing and carried household stuffs and up to two hundred quintals of tobacco. Because the rest of the tobacco that each one had the night when the enemy entered this city was burned in the houses when the city was burned that night. That was around where they shot their arquebus [end p. 75v]. And that everything aforesaid amounted to more than forty thousand ducados.[43] To this number must be added ornaments and clothing taken from the convents of San Francisco and San Domingo and the Iglesia Mayor. They took everything, even the bells of the aforementioned six churches, the four large and the two small. And likewise, this witness knows that two black slaves ­belonging to the widow Mencia Rruiz,[44] and another belonging to Pedro de Padilla,[45] the second-in-command[46] to Captain Cebriano Frontino, went with the said enemy. And they went voluntarily from the power of their masters to the enemy, after the masters of the said blacks had retreated from the campaign with their other soldiers. And as such, this witness knows that three Spanish-speaking Indian women [ladinas][47] stayed with the English that night that the enemy took the city. They took one of them who was in the servitude[48] of Father Francisco de Leuro, who was bed-ridden, and the other who was in the servitude of Captain Cristoval de Cárdenas.[49] And the other woman was married to Luys de Arce,[50] a Creole soldier of the Indies, and a Guatian[51] Indian of the Nuevo Reyno of Granada of the encomienda[52] of the governor Don Fernando de Oruña,[53] who was benumbed. And today he and the Indian women are in that city. And the said Indian women were forced into servitude [end p. 76] by them until twelve days later when they fled from the enemy. They traveled to where the Spaniards were. Furthermore the witness knows that two Spanish-speaking Indian men [ladinos] left with the enemy, one forcibly and the other voluntarily. Because the first, who was named Cristobal, a Morca Indian of the Nuevo Reino, was in servitude to[54] Governor Diego de Palomeque and remained within the private chambers[55] where he had been left. The other, named Pedro Criollo in the servitude of Captain Joan Ximenez, was held in chains in the said governor’s house. Because the day the sails appeared in the river, the said Indian had told them to take repose[56] because he would go with the Englishmen. His said master, fearing it, told the said governor who then ordered to condemn the said Indian to imprisonment after the enemy took the city. This witness learned from the Indian women who had fled from the enemy, how the said Indian Pedro Criollo had walked free and well-dressed among the Englishmen. And of the other Indian Cristobal, he heard said that the Englishmen threw him into the ships and never more was he heard from again. And likewise the witness knows that the same night the enemy took this city, a young Portuguese boy, fourteen years old, more or less, disappeared from the Spaniards and has not appeared [end p. 77] again. This witness does not know if the enemies took him or killed him. And likewise this witness knows that three days after the enemy entered this city, which was in the morning on Sunday, two more of the enemy’s large ships entered, one bigger than the next. According to what we saw, all were led by the same captain, which we knew because the fleet always had its flag raised. And they prepared large volleys that were fired in volleys of more than thirty pieces of artillery from all of the said ships at the time that they dropped anchor. Likewise the witness knows that when the aforementioned governor sent to see if the enemy had driven the people from the land, [end p. 78] those who went to see it told him that they came marching on land, a quantity of fifty men. And according to this witness what he saw that night would be the aforementioned quantity, and this he knows and responds to this question.\n\nIn response to the fifth question he says that he knows that within six days, more or less, of when the enemy entered this city three boats left from there going upriver on the Orinoco and this witness knew they arrived at the seat[57] of the chief Mayquiagua[58] of the Carib[59] nation that was more or less seventy leagues from this city. And he heard the enemy say to the natives of this river how they went sounding it and speaking [end p. 78v] to the Indians telling them that the Spaniards were already dead that they were already lords of this land. And that they had many axes and blades to give them and that they delayed the said voyage as the aforementioned vessel made the round trip from this town in three weeks, more or less. And in that interim, in which these three vessels were going upriver, the other was going downriver. And from what this witness understands, he was to give a notice to the other ships that were in the Island of Trinidad.[60] He knows it for certain because of an Indian who came from the aforesaid Island, who was from the Arawak nation.[61] That Indian went with captain Cristóbal Cardenas to give a notice to Trinidad and Margarita,[62] Cumana,[63] and Caracas[64] of how the enemy took over this city. The witness knew because the aforementioned Indian told this witness that having him in prison in the ship, the general named Guatarreal[65] saw how a boat arrived giving a notice of what was happening. And the aforementioned general hearing him, cried about his son’s death and he knew that in that interim in which the small vessels went up and down the river, there came a large number of piraguas[66] and curiaras[67] of Chaguanes Indians[68] who were of the nation who let the enemy on this land. And they were loaded, with their hollows filled with everything [end p. 79v] that the householders had in their houses that the enemy had not noticed. This witness knows that because he heard him say to the Indians that they ran into them loaded up, and this witness saw them come two or three times to this city by the aforementioned upper part of the river, and this he responds to this question.\n\nTo the sixth question he said that he knows that this city is in its bright, airy, spectacular place upon the Orinoco river which is seen from three or four leagues downstream and more than a league upstream. But that everything is open without any kind of reinforcement and that he knows that this land is very fertile and that two corn harvests are gotten every year; one in winter and the other in summer, and that the winter one is harvested in September and the other in summer is harvested in March and that the winter one is planted through the whole month of May and the summer one is planted through October and November. And that the harvest of corn in the summer is the most fertile and most abundant and that it usually yields, if the year is fertile, more than 300 fanegas[69] and the ordinary harvest yields 200 to 250 fanegas. And in the herd of cattle there are presently up to 4,000 heads of beef cattle and that the fisheries are all year and the most abundant are in summer; and if this land had salt in [end p. 80v] abundance then it could sustain all of the Indies. The aforementioned fishings tend to be done with barbasco,[70] nets and hooks along with spears of the natives. And this witness knows that a boy angling with just a hook customarily lands 20 arrobas[71] of fish everyday. The fisheries are also so large that many times the natives let their catch go to waste by not carrying it back. Smoked fish will last for up to 15 days and salted fish will last all year long. The witness also knows that during the summer the amount of sea turtles is so high on the beaches that if there were enough salt for all of them, they could sustain 100 townes like this and turtle meat is better to do so than any other kind of meat, even beef. [end p. 81] Even in its most ruined state, as it is at present, the land can sustain more than 200 householders such as those in an infantry. If there were care and a little diligence it could sustain many more people than what was said before. The witness knows this all because of the 22 years and more that he has been residing in and still presently resides in this city and provinces. The witness claims all of the aforementioned as fact and states under oath, and having it read to him again, he affirmed and ratified it. And as was necessary, he said it again and the aforementioned witness signed his name and claimed he is [end p. 81v] forty-nine years of age. And it was signed by the said Lieutenant Governor, who was present with the aforementioned Captain Diego Martín de Baena, García de Aguilar Trujillo, Geronimo de Grados: Diego Martín de Baena passed before me, Joan de Alcala,[72] royal notary —\n\n_____________\n\nTestimony: In the city of Santo Tome on the sixth day of the month of September of 1618 for the aforementioned information, the previously mentioned Captain Diego Martin de Baena in the presence of the aforementioned Lieutenant Governor, and to respond to the second question [end p. 82] of the aforementioned ynterrogatorio, presented as a witness Yuliana de Moxica,[73] Indian ladina of the Guayana people[74] and woman of Luys de Arce, soldier in this journey[75] and householder of this city. Having sworn in form of law and being examined in accordance with the said question of the aforementioned ynterrogatorio, she said the following: that this witness, on the night that the city was taken, was with Ynes, Indian in servitude of Captain Cardenas, with the clothing that she had. They were on the banks of the Orinoco River between some rocks that formed the shore of the river, and they went at dawn of the next day to the house of Father [end p. 82v] Francisco de Luero, who was not found in his house because the house had been burned, and looking throughout the city, they found him in the house of Francisco de Santa Cruz. The English were there curing him in that house that was in the plaça where they attended to the enemy. The captains of the enemy stayed in the said house and this witness and the said Ynes were tied up there. They spoke to the Father and asked him how he was, and he made them prepare lunch for another Indian ladina, who was also a friend of this witness and of her companion, and who was of the said Father Francisco de Luero. It was there, with the Father in their [end p. 83] company, that the English, when they saw them, they brought them to the guard room where the general was, who when he saw them, told them to have no fear, that no harm would come to the Indian women or men but only to the Spaniards. It was because of this that they served them and for this that they would be paid. And so, this witness and her friend were detained twelve days in the company of Father Francisco de Leuro and his companion, during which time the English made them grind maiz and make arepas[76] so that they could eat, and seeing that this witness and her friends did not give them [end p. 83v] arepas to eat liberally and in abundance, they said that they would set them in the chamber with the aforementioned father Francisco de Leuro, and that they would burn everything. And due to this worry and fear, each day they had threats. One day at the setting of the sun they went with the intent to collect firewood. They fled the power of the enemy, leaving the aforesaid father alone. They did not dare to take their clothes for fear the enemy would perceive them, and all of that night they were hidden on the mountain that was outside of the city. On another day in the morning, they went to the plot of land owned by Captain Geronimo de Grados [end p. 84]. Because they did not know where the Spaniards were, they went to that land, because the people there knew where they were. Then the husband of the witness arrived, and he was with all of the Spaniards next to the Caroni River.[77] He showed the witness where they were so that the alcaldes saw them and knew what the enemy had done in the city. The witness said to the aforementioned alcaldes like the enemy had spoken with the witness and her friends. He had asked them this, and how they had escaped from them, asking them what the enemy did and what the witness said to them. Also, what her friends said to him is the following: that the enemy had the Franciscan father de [end p. 84v] Leuro in the house of Francisco de Santa Cruz, curing him, and that the said enemy brought with him a Portuguese boy. She did not know his name, only that he was a boy whose first fine hairs were budding above the lip, who said to the witness and her companions that he wanted to go where the Christians were and that he did not dare to because the Christians would not understand, that when they saw him they would think he was English, and they would kill him and that he was Christian. And so he asked them for the love of God to bring him with them. And nor did her companions dare to bring him with them, for fear of being discovered by the enemy. This witness knew that the English had collected together at the convent of San [end p. 85] Francisco of this city and that she had seen a Portuguese boy in the house of Martin Rodrigues, householder of the city. And they told her how then, another day, in the morning, when they had taken the city, they had collected he who said he had gone looking for the Spanish. This witness saw them bring him through the houses of the city, hands tied behind with agave.[78] Interrogating him, he told them where there was gold that the Spanish had buried, and they went searching through the houses to see if they had indeed buried it. Because the boy did not want to say where the buried gold was, they hit him with [end p. 85v] short whips over the clothes that he was wearing. In front of this witness, they boarded one of the enemy ships and in this way the witness saw that the aforementioned enemy had under his control an Indian ladino named Cristoval, who had been in the servitude of Governor Diego Palomeque, whom she had found in the house of said governor, his master, and he was taken by the enemy. Because the aforementioned Indian said he was mestizo[79] the enemy wanted to hang him. The said Indian was from the Reino de Valle of Sogamoso[80] according to what the Christians had said.
