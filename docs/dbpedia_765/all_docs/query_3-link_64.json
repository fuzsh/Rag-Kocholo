        "text": "ARLES EVENT Panel Discussion: Artificial Intelligence and the Threat to the Real Join us on Wednesday, July 3, at 15:00 CEST for an insightful panel discussion presented by VII Insider in partnership with PhotoWings. The production of synthetic media by AI models is rapidly and radically transforming the visual landscape. Generative AI can produce increasingly realistic photographs and videos, and this capacity is expanding exponentially. Given the danger synthetic visual media poses to the power of images in reliably documenting events and issues, this session will address this question: what can independent practitioners and media organizations do to ensure authenticated visual content retains a central place in visual journalism?
