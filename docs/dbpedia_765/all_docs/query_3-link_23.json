        "text": "The Hospital is the most powerful and influential Religious Military Order in PanOceania. Crusaders for faith and country, they are aware that their mission is to always be ready for the call of duty, which always comes at the darkest hour.\n\nThe Vargar have accumulated the most victories in the annual competitions between the different spec-op units of the PanOceanian Military Complex. Evil tongues speak of experimental hardware and even of enhancement drugs secretly developed at Ulveslør Station. But even if this were true, it takes far more than a couple of toys to win those tournaments. And the Vargar have everything it takes to prevail in a competition as well as in battle, no matter how hard.\n\nThe perfect box to provide your WinterFor Army with a versatile Fireteam."
