        "text": "What symbols come to mind, when you think about the Camino? Do you think of the scallop shell? How about other symbols of the Camino? From yellow arrows to walking sticks. These symbols help to understand the history, culture, and traditions of this ancient pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela. Let us explore some of the best-known items.\n\nSome Camino symbols have a true historical origin and some are just metaphorical. After reading this post, you will have a few interesting facts to share with your fellow pilgrims on your way.\n\nPlease note: We do not provide scallop shells in our holiday pack in support of our sustainability initiatives.\n\nTable of contents\n\nThe scallop shell or “Vieiras”, a symbol of the Camino\n\nOther symbols of the Camino\n\nThe Cross of St James\n\nThe pilgrim’s passport\n\nThe Compostela\n\nGourd “calabaza”\n\nThe hat\n\nA wooden stick or “bordón”\n\nThe Milestone\n\nYellow arrow\n\nThe Codex Calixtinus\n\nThe Botafumeiro\n\nThe Jacobean Year, Holy Year\n\nThe Holy Door (Porta Santa)\n\nTomb of St James\n\nCruceiros\n\nAbove all, the scallop shell is the most well-known and iconic symbol associated with the Camino de Santiago. It is closely related to the history of the Jacobean route. Most importantly, it appears reflected on the Codex Calixtinus. Clergymen would give it to pilgrims on their arrival at Santiago de Compostela city as accreditation for completing their pilgrimage.\n\nFrom ancient times to today, the scallop shell has accompanied pilgrims on their way to Santiago. On the other hand, now that people can buy scallop shells online, they are no longer proof of walking the Camino. However, the significance and tradition of carrying the shell with you on the Camino are still alive.\n\nDid you know? The scallop shell or Vieira’s scientific name is Pecten Jacobaeus, further proof of the significance of the Camino in Galicia.\n\n#1 The association of the scallop shell with the pilgrimage is related to its use by pilgrims to drink water from springs and streams.\n\n#2 Its popularisation as a symbol of the Camino came after the settlement of some merchants around the cathedral of Santiago in the Middle Ages. They sold the Vieiras that they took from the Galician sea as a souvenir to the pilgrims.\n\n#3 The Concha of Santiago can be traced back to when the disciple visited the Spanish peninsula by boat. This was in order to bury the remains of St James. Unfortunately, a storm destroyed the ship After some time, St James’s body was found undamaged and covered in scallop shells along the seashore.\n\n#4 On their arrival at the Galician coast, the disciples saw a wedding that was taking place on the shore. The bride was on horseback, suddenly the frightened horse dove into the ocean with the bride still on the saddle. Thankfully, both the bride and the horse emerged from the water safe and sound covered in scallop shells.\n\n#5 There is another version that associates the scallop shell with Venus, the goddess of love. As Venus’s symbol signifies people’s rebirth, the resurrection. This means overcoming the ego to move forward to a true self, more humble and simple. It also means the beginnings and endings, transition and transformation. All ideas shared by pilgrims and discovered on the Camino today, a constant source of renewal and rediscovery.\n\nDid you know? Venus rose from the sea on a scallop shell. Botticelli’s painting “The Birth of Venus”, depicts this scene. In addition, the scallop shell is associated with fertility rituals practised along the route.\n\nThe scallop shell is associated with one of the 23 miracles performed by St James. When St James cured a knight who suffered from a throat disease by putting a scallop on the affected area, word spread and people started to put scallops near their beds, hanging them on the outside door, putting it near animals drinking places.\n\nSome medieval texts give the shell the virtue of chasing rodents from fields or purifying water and wine.\n\nDid you know? The Scallop shell is not only associated with the St James Way. In the XII century, they were reportedly sold in Mont St Michel in France. Emperor Charles IV received Scallops as a present from the French king when he was passing by Paris on his pilgrimage.\n\nNowadays, the scallop shell sign is printed on hundreds of milestones in yellow colour on a blue background along the different Camino routes. It indicates the path to pilgrims on their way to Santiago de Compostela.\n\nYou can pick up countless souvenirs and mementoes emblazoned with the shell. Which make a great talking point to those who’ve been or want to go. You’ll also notice that churches along the Camino and churches named St James around the world will proudly display this ancient icon as a testament to their connection with the saint.\n\nDid you know? In French, the scallop is called Coquille Saint Jacques and in German Jakobsmuscheln (James mussels).\n\nThis particular Latin cross simulates a sword and its arms take the shape of a Fleur-De-Lys. Its red colour represents Jesus’s blood and the white background is a sign of purity.\n\nIts origin is related to the times of the Crusades, the Crusaders carried small sharp-edge crosses with them to be able to push them into the ground and pray in the presence of the Cross.\n\nIt is common to see pilgrims today carrying St James cross as a pin on their backpack or hat, and some scallop shells will have the symbol painted onto them.\n\nDid you know? St James was beheaded with a sword so the cross of St James is also a symbol of his suffering.\n\nThe credential or Pilgrim’s Passport is the way that pilgrims prove that they have accomplished their pilgrimage.\n\nIt’s like a passport in which pilgrims have to collect stamps on the different stages of their journey.\n\nIf you would like to receive your Compostela then you will need to show the stamps that you have received along the journey, covering at least 100km if you have walked, or 200km if you have cycled.\n\nWe will send you your own credential with your Holiday Pack when you book with Follow the Camino.\n\nThe typical Camino hat is a wide-brimmed hat that can be folded as a half-moon. As you can imagine, pilgrims walking for long hours under the Spanish sun can get easily sunburned if not using proper protection. The wide brim kept the sun off, so this is the main reason why it became a tradition for pilgrims to wear it.\n\nNowadays, you will see a much wider variety of hats along the way. You can read more about what to pack for the Camino here.\n\nApart from the Scallop Shell, there is no other symbol that better symbolizes the Way of St James than the yellow arrow. The arrow guides pilgrims in the right direction. Furthermore, it is printed on milestones, wooden sticks, walls, rocks, paths, and more along the Camino.\n\nIts origin is very curious, it dates back to the 70s when Elias Valiña, a priest from the O Cebreiro church, started to mark with a yellow arrow the route from the Pyrenees to Santiago de Compostela. He’s also the author of the first Camino guide published in the 80s.\n\nStill more curious is the significance of the yellow colour which was used for no other reason than it was free. It was the colour of paint used by the workers to paint the roads around the area.\n\nIf you’re walking along the Portuguese Coastal Way you’ll also find green arrows to guide you to Santiago.\n\nImportant! If you see blue arrows on the Portuguese Way, do not follow them, unless you want to reach Fatima in Portugal (the opposite direction to Santiago).\n\nWeighing more than 60 kg and 1.60 m in height, the Santiago de Compostela Botafumeiro is one of the largest incense burners in the world.\n\nThis is one of the most significant symbols of the Santiago cathedral; it’s made of silver-plated brass and is filled with incense and charcoal that is made to “fly”, swinging from one side to another tied to a large rope to perfume the temple.\n\nPilgrims who finish their pilgrimage on special dates like St James, Assumption, Easter Sunday, etc., can see the Botafumeiro censer in action as a part of the mass. Apart from these special occasions, the flying of the Botafumeiro is done on random days or at the request (and expense!) of guests.\n\nA far-reaching time of the year for Christians and Camino enthusiasts is St James Day (25th July). When July 25th occurs on a Sunday, it is referred to as a Holy Year or Jacobean Year.\n\nBelievers who visit the tomb of St James in Santiago will be granted the plenary indulgence, the absolution of all their sins.\n\nTo obtain forgiveness of their sins, devotees have to go to confession within 15 days before visiting the St James Cathedral. After they pass through the Holy Door (Porta Sancta), which is only open to the public in Holy years, they have to pray in the cathedral and attend Mass.\n\nDid you know? There is a Jacobean year every 6, 5, 6, and 11 years. The next Xacobeo years will be in 2021, 2022, 2027, and 2032.\n\nHere at Follow the Camino, we are constantly talking to other Camino experts about what is happening on the Camino.
