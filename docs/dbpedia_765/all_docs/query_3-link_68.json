        "text": "Damion Santiago originally came from the mini truck world. This time around he wanted to build a bagged truck but without the low aspect so as not to constantly damage the ride. He built the Black Knight 1500 and also established a 501c3 non-profit SoCal truck club called “Raized Up” in order to become a pillar in his community. Raized Up helps support important local causes such as veterans in need, displaced children, special needs, law enforcement support, and those who have lost loves ones. They do this by fund raising, holding car shows and events, and attending organized outreach events. They also attend big automotive shows like the Lucas Off Road, The DUB Show, and SEMA. Raize Up’s mission is to give back to their communities via custom trucks, jeeps and vans. They hope to inspire other like minded enthusiasts to join them in their mission to give back by raising up.\n\nA big thank you and shout out to our friends at Atturo Tires for hooking Damion and American Truxx up!"
