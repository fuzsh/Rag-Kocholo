        "text": "Juan VÃ¡zquez de AcuÃ±a, Galileo Galilei, filosofo, y mathematico el mas celebre. [Lima, 1650].\n\nThis extraordinarily rare biographical pamphlet is significant in many ways. In addition to providing a sketch of Galileoâs life, it discusses his principal publications, calling them more lucid than the works of Johannes Kepler and FranÃ§ois ViÃ¨te. It even examineâs Galileoâs controversial Saggiatore, a dialogue between the rival cosmologies proposed by Ptolemy and Copernicus. That this work was printed in Lima in 1650 signifies that there was a scientifically literate community in Lima familiar with cutting-edge European debates between the geocentric and heliocentric models of the universe. Lima, indeed, was as cosmopolitan as any European city of the time."
