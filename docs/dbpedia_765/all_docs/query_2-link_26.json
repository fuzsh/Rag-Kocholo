One of Spain’s few women playwrights, she was considered radical for her willingness to address such issues as religious fanaticism, atheism, illegitimacy, civil marriage (and the possibility of divorce, anathema in Roman Catholic Spain), and reform of the criminal justice system.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nFamous Poets and Poetic Form\n\nAcuña is best known for her verse drama Rienzi el tribuno (produced 1876; “Rienzi the Tribune”); the tragedy describes the futile efforts of the 14th-century Roman tribune Cola di Rienzo to restore the greatness of ancient Rome. In Amor a la patria (1877; “Love of Country”), which celebrates peasants’ resistance to Napoleon, the playwright contrasts the noble heroism of women with the venality of the male characters. Her other verse dramas include El padre Juan (1891), which caused a scandal with its attack on hypocritical clergy, and La voz de la patria (1893; “The Voice of the Nation”), which stirred further controversy with its portrayal of a pregnant woman who tries to prevent her fiancé from enlisting in the army.\n\nAcuña’s collections of poetry include Ecos del alma (1876; “Echoes from the Soul”); Morirse a tiempo (1880; “To Die on Time”), written in the style of the popular poet Ramón de Campoamor; and Sentir y pensar (1884; “Feeling and Thought”), a comic poem. She also defended efforts to liberalize social policy. El crimen de la calle de Fuencarral; odia el delito y compadece al delincuente (1880?; “The Crime of Fuencarral Street: Hate the Crime and Pity the Criminal”), based on a sensational murder case, is a then-radical call for understanding the social roots of crime. Consecuencias de la degeneración femenina (1888; “Consequences of Female Degeneracy”) and the three essays in Cosas Mías (1917; “My Things”) address feminist issues.\n\nThis article was most recently revised and updated by Encyclopaedia Britannica."
