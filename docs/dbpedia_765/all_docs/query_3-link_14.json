        "text": "Order, confraternity or society of knights\n\nThis article is about secular orders of knighthood. For the medieval religious orders, see Military order (religious society).\n\nAn order of chivalry, order of knighthood, chivalric order, or equestrian order is an order of knights,[1] typically founded during or inspired by the original Catholic military orders of the Crusades (c. 1099–1291) and paired with medieval concepts of ideals of chivalry.\n\nSince the 15th century, orders of chivalry, often as dynastic orders, began to be established in a more courtly fashion[clarification needed] that could be created ad hoc. These orders would often retain the notion of being a confraternity, society or other association of members, but some of them were ultimately purely honorific and consisted of a medal decoration. In fact, these decorations themselves often came to be known informally as orders. These institutions in turn gave rise to the modern-day orders of merit of sovereign states.[2]\n\nOverview\n\n[edit]\n\nAn order of knights is a community of knights composed by order rules with the main purpose of an ideal or charitable task. The original ideal lay in monachus et miles (monk and knight), who in the order – ordo (Latin for 'order' / 'status') – is dedicated to a Christian purpose. The first orders of knights were religious orders that were founded to protect and guide pilgrims to the Holy Land. The knightly orders were characterized by an order-like community life in poverty, obedience and chastity, which was linked with charitable tasks, armed pilgrimage protection and military action against external and occasionally internal enemies of Christianity. Examples are the Knights Templar, Knights of the Holy Sepulchre officially called The Equestrian Order of the Holy Sepulchre of Jerusalem, founded in 1090, the Order of St. John and the Order of Malta. These communities only became orders in the sense of canon law through papal recognition of their own binding rules of order and through the dissolution of ecclesiastical diocesan organizations.\n\nIn addition to the religious orders of knights, courtly orders of knights emerged in many European royal houses from the middle of the 14th century. This enabled the monarchs and princes to create a reliable household power independent of the church and to combine their court life with knightly virtues. During this time, the Burgundian court culture was leading and so the Order of the Golden Fleece, founded there in 1430, was for many a model in the sense of a princely order based on the ideals of Christian chivalry.[3]\n\nIn the course of time, many orders of knights have been dissolved due to a lack of people or the field of activity has changed. So in many areas the charitable aspect and nursing came to the fore. There were also dissolutions for political reasons, such as the Knights Templar in 1312 or many orders of knights as opposition by Nazi Germany. While the Knights Templar was not re-established, some orders were reactivated after the end of World War II and the fall of the Iron Curtain.\n\nThere are repeated attempts to revive or restore old orders of knights. Often old, old knight orders are used today to honor personalities. For example, the British Queen Elizabeth II regularly appointed new members to the Order of the British Empire in the 21st century.[4] In Central Europe, for example, the Order of St. George, whose roots also go back to the so-called \"last knight\" Emperor Maximilian I, was reactivated by the House of Habsburg after its dissolution by Nazi Germany. Meanwhile, to this day, deserved personalities in republican France are highlighted by being awarded the Knight of the Legion of Honour.[5] In contrast, the knights of the ecclesiastical orders of knights such as the Sovereign Military Order of Malta and the Order of St. John mainly devote themselves to social tasks, nursing and care.[6]\n\nTerminology\n\n[edit]\n\nHoly See\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Secretariat of the State of the Holy See – medieval pioneer of the original military orders – distinguishes orders in the following manner:[7]\n\nState orders or orders of merit: order of a sovereign state, rewarding military or civil merits of citizens, legally based on the sovereignty of their states\n\nPontifical equestrian orders\n\ncollazioni diretti: conferred by the Pope\n\nsubcollazioni: under the protection of the Holy See (Teutonic Order and Order of the Holy Sepulchre)\n\nSovereign orders: the only extant one in this category is the Sovereign Military Order of Malta, an international sovereign entity\n\nDynastic orders of a sovereign royal dynasty, either an active \"dynastic state order\" (e.g. Order of the Garter), otherwise a \"non-national dynastic order\", as the head of a formerly reigning royal house operating under ius collationis (right to confer), typically approved by Papal bulls in the case of older origins (e.g. Order of Saints Maurice and Lazarus)\n\nSansovino\n\n[edit]\n\nIn Dell'origine dei Cavalieri (1566), the Italian scholar Francesco Sansovino (1521–1586) distinguished knights and their respective societies in three main categories:[8]\n\n\"Knights of Collar\", i.e. dynastic orders of knighthood\n\n\"Knights of the Cross\", i.e. religious military orders\n\n\"Knights of Spur\", i.e. knighted by the sovereign, later also by feudal lords and knights elderly (e.g. Knight Bachelor)\n\nOver time, the above division became no longer sufficient, and heraldic science distinguished orders into: hereditary, military, religious and fees.\n\nBoulton\n\n[edit]\n\nIn a more generous distribution proposed in The Knights in the Crown: The Monarchical Orders of Knighthood in Late Medieval Europe (1987), the Canadian heraldist D'Arcy Boulton classifies chivalric orders as follows:\n\nMonarchical orders (i.e. dynastic orders of knighthood)\n\nConfraternal orders (as seen in military orders)\n\nFraternal orders\n\nVotive orders\n\nCliental pseudo-orders\n\nHonorific orders\n\nBased on Boulton, this article distinguishes:\n\nChivalric orders by time of foundation:\n\nMedieval chivalric orders: foundation of the order during the Middle Ages or the Renaissance\n\nModern chivalric orders: foundation after 1789\n\nChivalric orders by religion:\n\nCatholic chivalric orders: membership exclusively for members of the Catholic Church\n\nOrthodox chivalric orders: blessed by the heads of Orthodox churches\n\nProtestant chivalric orders: blessed by the heads of Protestant churches\n\nChivalric orders by purpose:\n\nMonarchical chivalric orders: foundation by a monarch who is a fount of honour; either ruling or not\n\nConfraternal chivalric orders: foundation by a nobleman, either high nobility or low nobility\n\nFraternal chivalric orders: founded for a specific purpose only\n\nVotive chivalric orders: founded for a limited period of time only by members who take a vow\n\nHonorific chivalric orders: consist only of honorific insignia bestowed on knights on festive occasions, consisting of nothing but the badge\n\nSelf-styled orders: self-proclaimed imitation-orders without statutes or restricted memberships\n\nMilitary orders by time\n\n[edit]\n\nAnother occurrent chronological categorisation is into:[citation needed]\n\nMilitary-monastic orders (c. 1100–1291), beginning with the Order of Saint John of Jerusalem\n\nMonarchical orders (c. 1330 – c. 1470), beginning with the Order of Saint George (Kingdom of Hungary). Most military-monastic orders (except the Teutonic Order and the Order of Saint John) became parts of this category during the 15th and 16th century (e.g. the Order of Santiago)\n\nHonorific orders (c. 1580–present), beginning with the Order of Saint Stephen (despite its military obligations) and the Order of the Holy Spirit. With the Order of Saint Louis, the time of proper orders of merit begun. The monarchical orders became de facto honours during the shift from feudalism to absolutism.[9]\n\nMedieval orders\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Military order (monastic society)\n\nMonarchical orders\n\n[edit]\n\nLate medieval monarchical orders (14th and 15th centuries) are orders of chivalry with the presidency attached to a monarch:\n\nOrder of Montesa founded by James II of Aragon (Spain) in 1317.\n\nOrder of Saint George, founded by Charles I of Hungary in 1325\n\nOrder of the Band, founded by Alfonso XI of Castile in c. 1330\n\nOrder of the Sword (Cyprus), founded by Peter I of Cyprus in 1347 (allegedly)\n\nOrder of the Garter, founded by Edward III of England in 1348[10]\n\nOrder of the Star, founded by John II of France in 1351\n\nOrder of the Knot, founded by Louis I of Naples in 1352.\n\nSupreme Order of the Most Holy Annunciation, founded by Amadeus VI, Count of Savoy in 1362.\n\nOrder of the Ermine, founded by John V, Duke of Brittany in 1381: First order to accept Women.\n\nOrder of the Ship, founded by Charles III of Naples on 1 December 1381\n\nOrder of the Dragon, founded by Sigismund, as king of Hungary in 1408.\n\nOrder of the Golden Fleece, founded by Philip III, Duke of Burgundy in 1430\n\nOrder of the Tower and Sword, founded by Afonso V of Portugal in 1459\n\nOrder of Saint Michael, founded by Louis XI of France in 1469[11]\n\nPost-medieval foundations of chivalric orders:\n\nOrder of Saint Stephen (1561)\n\nOrder of the Holy Spirit (1578)\n\nBlood of Jesus Christ (military order) (1608)\n\nOrder of the Thistle (1687)[12]\n\nOrder of the Elephant (1693)\n\nOrder of Saint Louis (1694)\n\nOrder of the Seraphim (1748)\n\nOrder of Saint Stephen of Hungary (1764)\n\nOrder of St. Patrick (1783)[13]\n\nOrder of Saint Joseph (1807)\n\nOrder of Guadalupe (1821)\n\nOrder of the Mexican Eagle (1865)\n\nOrder of Saint Charles (1866)\n\nMonarchical orders whose monarch no longer reigns but continues to bestow the order:\n\nOrder of Saints Maurice and Lazarus (Italian House of Savoy)\n\nOrder of Merit of Savoy (Italian House of Savoy)\n\nOrder of the Golden Fleece (Austrian branch)\n\nOrder of St. George (Habsburg-Lorraine)\n\nOrder of the Holy Spirit\n\nOrder of Prince Danilo I of Montenegro\n\nOrder of Saint Peter of Cetinje\n\nOrder of Skanderbeg\n\nRoyal Order of Saint George for the Defense of the Immaculate Conception (Bavaria)\n\nOrder of the Crown (Romania)\n\nOrder of Carol I (Romania)\n\nOrder of the Immaculate Conception of Vila Viçosa (Portugal)\n\nOrder of Saint Michael of the Wing (Portugal)\n\nSacred Military Constantinian Order of Saint George (Two Sicilies)\n\nOrder of the Eagle of Georgia (Georgia)\n\nOrder of Queen Tamara (Georgia)\n\nOrder of the Crown of Georgia (Georgia)\n\nRoyal Order of the Crown of Hawai'i (Hawai'i)\n\nConfraternal orders\n\n[edit]\n\nConfraternal orders are orders of chivalry with the presidency attached to a nobleman:\n\nPrincely orders were founded by noblemen of higher rank. Most of these were founded in imitation of the Order of the Golden Fleece, after 1430:\n\nOrder of Saint Catherine, founded by Humbert II, Dauphin du Viennois around 1335\n\nOrder of Saint Anthony, founded by Albrecht I of Bavaria in 1384\n\nOrder of the Rüdenband, founded in Silesia, Upper Lusatia and Boehmia before 1389\n\nSociety of the Eagle, founded by Albrecht II von Habsburg in 1433\n\nSociety of Our Lady (Order of the Swan), founded by Frederick II, Elector of Brandenburg in 1440\n\nOrder of Saint Hubert, founded by Gerhard V of Jülich and Berg in 1444\n\nOrder of the Crescent, founded by René d'Anjou in 1448\n\nSociety of Saint Jerome, founded by Friedrich II of Wettin in 1450\n\nOrder of Saint Joachim, founded by fourteen nobles in 1755\n\nBaronial orders, founded by noblemen of lower rank:\n\nOrder of Saint Hubert (Barrois, 1422)\n\nNoble Order of Saint George of Rougemont, also called Confraternity of Saint-Georges of Burgundy (Franche-Comté, 1440)\n\nFraternal orders\n\n[edit]\n\nFraternal orders are orders of chivalry that were formed off a vow & for a certain enterprise:\n\nCompagnie of the Black Swan, founded by 3 princes and 11 knights in Savoy (1350)\n\nCorps et Ordre du Tiercelet, founded by the vicomte de Thouars and 17 barons in Poitou (1377–1385)\n\nOrdre de la Pomme d'Or, founded by 14 knights in Auvergne (1394)\n\nAlliance et Compagnie du Levrier, founded by 44 knights in the Barrois (1416–1422), subsequently converted into the Confraternal order of Saint Hubert (see above)\n\nVotive orders\n\n[edit]\n\nVotive orders are orders of chivalry, temporarily formed on the basis of a vow. These were courtly chivalric games rather than actual pledges as in the case of the fraternal orders. Three are known from their statutes:\n\nEmprise de l'Escu vert à la Dame Blanche (Enterprise of the green shield with the white lady), founded by Jean Le Maingre dit Boucicaut and 12 knights in 1399 for the duration of 5 years\n\nEmprise du Fer de Prisonnier (Enterprise of the Prisoner's Iron), founded by Jean de Bourbon and 16 knights in 1415 for the duration of 2 years\n\nEmprise de la gueule de dragon (Enterprise of the Dragon's Mouth), founded by Jean comte de Foix in 1446 for 1 year.\n\nCliental pseudo-orders\n\n[edit]\n\nCliental pseudo-orders are not orders of chivalry and were princes' retinues fashionably termed orders. They are without statutes or restricted memberships:\n\nOrdre de la Cosse de Genêt (Order of the Broom-Pod), founded by Charles VI of France c. 1388\n\nOrder of the camail or Porcupine, created by Louis d'Orléans in 1394\n\nOrder of the Dove, Castile, 1390\n\nOrder of the Scale of Castile, c. 1430\n\nHonorific orders\n\n[edit]\n\nHonorific orders were honorific insignia consisting of nothing but the badge:\n\nOrder of the Stoat and the Ear, founded by Francis I, Duke of Brittany in 1448\n\nOrder of the Golden Spur, a papal order (since the 14th century, flourishes in the 16th century)\n\nTogether with the monarchical chivalric orders (see above) these honorific orders are the prime ancestors of the modern-day orders of knighthood (see below) which are orders of merit in character.\n\nThe distinction between these orders and decorations is somewhat vague, except that these honorific orders still implied membership in a group. Decorations have no such limitations and are awarded purely to recognize the merit or accomplishments of the recipient. Both orders and decorations often come in multiple classes.[14]\n\nInfluence\n\n[edit]\n\nThe orders have influenced organizations which are completely separate and distinct from them. Since at least the 18th century, Freemasonry has incorporated symbols and rituals of several medieval military orders in a number of Masonic bodies, most notably, in the \"Red Cross of Constantine\" (derived from the Sacred Military Constantinian Order of Saint George), the \"Order of Malta\" (derived from the Sovereign Military Order of Malta), and the \"Order of the Temple\" (derived from the historical Knights Templar), the latter two featuring prominently in the York Rite.\n\nModern orders\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Order of merit\n\nMost orders created since the late 17th century were no longer societies and fellowships of knights[1] who followed a common mission but were established by monarchs or governments with the specific purpose of bestowing honours on deserving individuals. In most European monarchies, these new orders retained some outward forms from the medieval orders of chivalry (such as rituals and structure) but were in essence orders of merit, mainly distinguished from their republican counterparts by the fact that members were entitled to a title of nobility.[citation needed] While some orders required noble birth (such as the Order of Saint Stephen of Hungary, established in 1764), others would confer a title upon appointment (such as the Military Order of Max Joseph, established in 1806) while in yet other orders only the top classes were considered knights (such as in the Order of St Michael and St George, established in 1818). Orders of merit which still confer privileges of knighthood are sometimes referred to as orders of knighthood. As a consequence of being not an order of chivalry but orders of merit or decorations, some republican honours have thus avoided the traditional structure found in medieval orders of chivalry and created new ones instead, e.g. the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany, the Decoration for Services to the Republic of Austria, or the Legion of Merit of the United States.\n\nCurrent orders\n\n[edit]\n\nOrder of the Holy Sepulchre, one of the original military orders founded circa 1099, and its definite acceptance in 1103 by King Baldwin I.[15]\n\nSovereign Military Order of Malta, one of the original military orders, founded as the Order of St. John of Jerusalem in 1048, sanctioned by Pope Paschal II on 15 February 1113.\n\nTeutonic Order, a Catholic religious order founded as a military order in 1190 in Acre, Kingdom of Jerusalem.\n\nOrder of Aviz founded by Afonso I of Portugal in 1146\n\nOrder of Calatrava founded by St. Raymond of Fitero (Spain) in 1164.\n\nOrder of Alcantara founded by Ferdinand II of León (Spain) in 1167.\n\nOrder of Santiago founded Ferdinand II of León (Spain) in 1170.\n\nOrder of Saint James of the Sword founded by Afonso I of Portugal in 1172.\n\nOrder of Montesa founded by James II of Aragon (Spain) in 1317.\n\nOrder of Christ (Portugal), founded by Denis of Portugal in 1319.

There were two classes. The first class, the Grand Collar, was worn by the Shah, crown prince, and awarded to heads of state. The second class, the Grand Cordon, was worn by princes and princesses.\n\nTypical insignia and ranks\n\n[edit]\n\nFollowing the example set by the French Legion of Honour, founded by Napoleon, most multi-level European orders comprise five ranks or classes. The highest is usually called the Grand Cross, then descending with varying titles. Alternatively, the ranks are referred to by number (for example \"1st class\" instead of \"Grand Cross\"). Typical rankings are:\n\nClass Common names I Grand Cross, Commander Grand Cross, Grand Cordon, Grand Collar II Grand Officer, Commander 1st Class, Grand Commander, Knight Commander, Knight Companion, Commander with Star III Commander, Commander 2nd Class, Companion IV Officer, Knight 1st Class, Member 1st Class V Knight, Knight 2nd Class, Chevalier, Cavaliere, Member\n\nEach of these ranks wear insignia, usually badge (often enamelled) on a ribbon. Typically these insignia are worn from a sash in the case of the senior ranks, around the neck for the middle ranks (see also neck decorations), and on the left chest for the lower grades. Many orders use insignia in the form of a cross, but there may also be stars, and military awards may have crossed swords added onto the insignias. Ladies may wear the badge on a bow on the left chest. In orders following the example set by the French Legion of Honour, the two highest classes also wear a star (or plaque) on the chest. In special cases the senior class may wear the badge on a collar, which is an elaborate chain around the neck.\n\nIn certain countries with feudal heritage the higher ranks (usually at least the Grand Cross) may have vestments proper to them, including a robe or mantle and a hat. An example of such a modern-day order is the Order of the British Empire.\n\nThe French Legion of Honour democratised the honour systems of orders of chivalry and merit in the sense of formally omitting both the expectations of nobility on admittees while also no further implying the same status on previously non-noble conferees. Yet some orders may still expect noble ancestry on the part of recipients, such as the Sovereign Military Order of Malta and those of the Alliance of the Orders of Saint John of Jerusalem. Others may continue to imply conferral of nobility on any admittee, whether hereditary or personal, such as in some of the cases of dynastic orders conferred by the House of Bavaria or the House of Imperial Russia.\n\nSelf-styled orders\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Self-styled order\n\nSome organisations claim to be chivalric orders but are actually private membership organisations that have not been created by a state or a reigning monarch.[21] The answer to the question of whether an order is legitimate or not varies from nation to nation,[22] François Velde wrote an \"order of knighthood is legitimate if it is defined as legal, recognized and acknowledged as such by a sovereign authority. Within its borders, a sovereign state does as it pleases. Most, if not all, modern states have honorific orders and decorations of some kind, and those are sometimes called orders of knighthood.\"[23] Exactly what makes one order legitimate and another self-styled or false is a matter of debate with some arguing that any monarch (reigning or not) or even the descendants of such can create an order while others assert that only a government with actual internationally recognized authority has such power (regardless of whether that government is republican or monarchical in nature).[24][25] Historically, nobility and knights have also formed Orders of Knighthood. The Noble Order of Saint George of Rougemont is a Baronial Order and the Ordre de la Pomme d'Or was founded by 14 knights in Auvergne in 1394.[26][27]\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nMilitary order (society)\n\nOrder (honour)\n\nTitle of honor\n\nSelf-styled orders\n\nNotes\n\n[edit]\n\nBibliography\n\n[edit]\n\nAnstis, John (1752).
