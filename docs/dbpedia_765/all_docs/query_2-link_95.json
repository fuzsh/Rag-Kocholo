        "text": "A SHORT HISTORY OF ACUÑA SURNAME\n\nDue to the numerous information queries andsome errors and legends respect the ACUÑA surname, I would like to help for future investigations.\n\nWESTERN OF EUROPE\n\nThe ancient origin is located in Germanic tribes moving to Belgium and France.\n\n250 BC to 0 – Chiefs of Sicambria tribes.\n\n0AC to 390 – Chiefs of Toxandria.\n\n390 to 575 – Kings of Franks.\n\nSPANISH KINGS\n\nThe Visigoths invades Hispania in 420, they work as soldiers for romans and finally govern Hispania.\n\n575 to 680 – Visigoth Kings of Spain.\n\n680 to 740 – Pedro, Duke of Cantabria. Origin of Spanish Monarchy.\n\n740 to 925 – Kings of Galicia, Asturias y León.\n\nGALICE AND PORTUGAL\n\nDescendents from Spanish Kings establish their dominions in Galice and Portugal as landlords.\n\n921 to 980 – Infante (Prince) Aznar Fruela.\n\n980 to1185 – Richmen of Portugal. Landlords of Cunha Alta and Tábua territories.\n\n1140 to 1225 – Lourenço Fernandes da Cunha. First Cunha in the History. First use of the arms coat.\n\n1180 to 1400 – Cunhas in Portugal. Landlords of Tábua.\n\n1195 to 1207 – Cunhas Landlords of Pombeiro da Beira. Surname Cunha dissapear in XVIII century.\n\nAlvaro da Cunha (1530-1606) belong to this line, beingthe origin of Acuñas in Costa Rica and Nicaragua. 1351 to 1415 – Estebâo Soares da Cunha – He is the origin of Landlords of the Tábua, Marquises of Assentar and Counts of Cunha, as well as Acuñas of Catamarca (Argentina).\n\n1352 to 1415 – Vasco Martins da Cunha. He is the maximum nobile and knights power of the family.\n\n1397 – Martim, Gil and Lope Vasques da Cunha, their sons, exilates to Castilla. They can not obey the new Portugal King and they are called by Enrique III of Castilla.\n\n1403 – Gil return to Portugal. He is the origin of Landlords of Celorico de Basto and Gestaço. Counts of Sâo Vicente and Penaguiam, Marquises of Fontes and Abrantes. In this line there are Cunhas today.\n\n1397 to Today – Cunhas in Portugal.\n\nCASTILLA (SPAIN)\n\n1400 – Martim and Lope Vasques da Cunha change their names to Martin and Lope Vázquez de Acuña.\n\nThey never return to Portugal and build their linages in Castilla.\n\nAfter 20 years and 5.000 hours of work, I finished the investigation for Martin and Lope lines in 2011, establishing a complete continuity until today. There are 58 generations identified .\n\nMartin Vázquez de Acuña descendents (In Spain).\n\n1400 to today – Martin is designated I Duke of Valencia. Is the root of Marquises and Dukes of Escalona,Osuna and Braganza. Marquises of Bedmar, Casafuerte de la Hinestrosa, Villanueva de las Torres and Prado. Counts of Gramedo, Obedos, Luna, Oñate and Requena. Landlords of Ledigos, Molin de la Torre, La Torre de Zárate, Pajares, Villafañé, Matadión, Zubiarre, Irive, Villaviciosa, de Castro de la Vega, and Luyando. Tere are not Acuñas in this line today.\n\nLope Vázquez de Acuña descendents (In spain).\n\n1400 to Today – Lope is designated Landlord of Buendía. Is the root of Dukes of Huete, Marquises of Falces, Caracena and Castrofuerte. Counts of Pinto and Gondomar.Alféreces Mayores of Baeza. Landlords of Azañón, Anguix, Dueñas, Viana, Maya, Paredes, Portilla, Tariego, Valtablado and la Torre de Valenzuela. There areAcuñas only in this line today.\n\nOTHER ACUÑAS\n\nIn general, the Acuñas who can probe the nobile linage from Martin or Lope are the only authentic. Other are CUNHAS from Portugal transformed in Acuñas during XVI to XVIII centuries, or they taken the surname without right to do it.\n\nExamples:\n\n• Acuñas in Pontevedra (Galicia. Spain). Probably coming from Portugal.\n\n• Acuñas of Fuente de Cantos (Extremadura. Spain). Coming from Portugal.\n\n• Acuñas in America. Except Costa Rica and Nicaragua for the descendents of Alvaro de Acuña.\n\n• Acuñas in Philippines. Except descendents, if any, from Pedro Bravo de Acuña.\n\nThese Acuñas have lost “DE” (nobile origin) in the surname, and for these ones I have not information.\n\nACUÑA AS A SEPHARDIC NAME\n\nThe nobile branches of Cunha in Portugal, and Acuña in Spain, have not a jew origin and their surnames are not Sephardic.There is not ANY proof of this and is very easy to check their royal and nobile origins, and a lot of “Expedientes de nobleza” to be accepted in ALL Cavalry Orders or Canchilleries, or to be member of the “Inquisición”. Something impossible without a “blood purity”.\n\nThere is a book speaking about some Acuña and Acuña-Noronha surnames inmigrants to Brazil. If that was true, they would be portuguese Cunhas, not Acuñas.\n\nHISTORICAL PLACES TO VISIT IN SPAIN\n\n• Acuña Castle. Valencia de Don Juan (León).\n\n• Acuña Palace. Baeza (Jaén). Private property.\n\n• Acuña Palace of Counts of Buendía. Dueñas. (Palencia). Collapsed in 2011.\n\n• Counts of Buendía Burial. Dueñas. (Palencia)\n\n• San Agustín Monastry. Dueñas. (Palencia).\n\n• Princes Chapel. Toledo Cathedral.\n\nMy very best regards.\n\nJosé María de Acuña Torres.\n\n2012"
