After a distinguished career in Spain he was sent to Mexico, where his creole origin and his wise government made him popular. He attacked favoritism and corruption, extended and consolidated Spanish territorial claims, and ordered the construction of many public works. In his term the Gaceta de México, Mexico's first newspaper, appeared.\n\nThe Columbia Electronic Encyclopedia, 6th ed. Copyright © 2024, Columbia University Press. All rights reserved."
