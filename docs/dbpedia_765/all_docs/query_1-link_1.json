        "text": "On February 18, 1724, field marshal Antonio Manso Maldonado arrived in New Granada as the president, governor, and captain-general of the New Kingdom. He had been appointed to this position on December 4, 1723, because both the crown and the Chamber of the Indies thought it would be best executed by a military officer. Manso Maldonado could boast more than 30 years of military service, proven loyalty, and administrative experience, much of it during the first reign of Felipe V. After joining the royal armies as a private, Manso Maldonado rose steadily through the ranks, fighting the Moors in Ceuta and the French in the wars of the late seventeenth century. During the War of the Spanish Succession, he served at the orders of the militant bishop of Murcia and last viceroy of Valencia, Luis Belluga, who praised Manso's valor directly to the king. Most important perhaps, at the end of the War of the Spanish Succession and upon the occupation of Catalonia by Bourbon forces, Manso Maldonado had served as teniente de rey in Gerona (1716-1719) and Barcelona (1719-1723), witnessing first-hand the implementation of the Nueva Planta and the enforcement of royal authority over the rebellious principality.\n\n2. In the language of the time the Nueva Planta, or new organization, referred to the reorganized structures introduced by Felipe V and his ministers to the political institutions of the Spanish monarchy or its provinces. Most commonly, it refers to the political institutions imposed on the kingdoms of Valencia, Aragon, Catalonia, and Majorca following their occupation by Bourbon forces in the later stages of the War of Succession and the derogation of their traditional constitutions and privileges.\n\n5. Little is known about the career of this officer other than that he fought in Valencia during the War of Succession and later became corregidor and military governor of Alicante. He died shortly after arriving in Cartagena de Indias, and by 1725 field marshal Juan José de Andía, marquis of Villahermosa, had arrived to replace him.

While there exist a number of works that present biographies or biographical sketches of Mexican or Peruvian viceroys in chronological succession, few go beyond the strictly descriptive presentation of details of each individual's life that Cañeque criticized. A notable exception is the work already cited by Rubio Mané, El virreinato I, which attempts to analyze systematically the social origins of the viceroys appointed to New Spain from 1535 up to the mid-eighteenth century.\n\n12. Few exceptions exist beyond the works of Jaime Vicens Vives and Alfonso Garcia Gallo, produced during their debates of the 1940s, concerning the origins of the viceregal institutions introduced in Spanish America in the sixteenth century. For an extensive review and bibliography of such debates, see Belenguer, Ernest, “De virreinatos indianos a virreinatos mediterráneos. Una comparación contrastada,” in Congreso Internacional. El gobierno de un mundo, pp. 321–324;Google Scholar and, in the same volume, Bcrmúdez, Agustín, “La implantación del régimen virreinal en Indias,” pp. 256–262.Google Scholar Unique for its insightful analysis of the evolution of viceregal rule in the Indies from a richly informed comparative perspective is Lalinde Abadía, Jesús, “El régimen virreino-senatorial en Indias,” Anuario de Historia del Derecho Español (1967), pp. 5–244;Google Scholar a more limited comparison of viceregal rule in New Spain and Sicily is Ciaramitaro, Fernando, “El virrey y su gobierno en Nueva España y Sicilia. Analogías y diferencias entre periferias del Imperio Hispánico, Estudios de Historia Novohispana 39 (2008), pp. 117–154.Google Scholar For a thought-provoking comparison of the political dynamics of viceregal rule in sixteenth-century Italy and the crown of Aragon, see José, Carlos Sánches, Hernando , “‘Estar en nuestro lugar, representando nuestra propia persona.’ El gobierno virreinal en Italia y la Corona de Aragón bajo Felipe II,” in Felipe IIy el Mediterráneo, Vol. 3, La monarquía y los reinos (I), ed.

Ibid., p. 24, suggests incorrectly that Armendáriz was “sargento mayor in the Guardias de Corps.” Some of the documents given to Armendáriz upon his appointment as viceroy of Peru clearly identify him as “lieutenant-colonel of the regiment of Spanish infantry guards,” an altogether different branch of the armed forces charged with protecting the king. See “Ynstrucción reservada de lo que el Marqués de Castelfuerte ha de ejecutar en el Perú luego que tome posesión de aquel virreinato,“ Archivo General de Indias-Seville (hereafter AGI), Indiferente, 513, L.6, f. 86r.\n\n41. The old Habsburg guard comprised three corps of halberdiers: the Flemish archeros de la cuchilla, the Spanish halberdiers, and the Tudesque guard. Early in Felipe’s reign they were replaced by the infantry guard and the guardia de corps, created in 1704, and a company of halberdiers reformed in 1707. For more detail, see Dedieu, , “La Nueva Planta en su contexto,” pp. 126–127;Google Scholar and Castillo, Andújar, “Élites de poder militar: las guardias reales en el siglo XVIII,” in La pluma, la mitra y la espada. Estudios de historia institucional en la edad moderna, eds. Luis Castellano, Juan, Pierre Dedieu, Jean , and Ma. López-Cordón, Victoria (Madrid: Marcial Pons/Universidad de Burdeos, 2000), p. 66.Google Scholar\n\n43. Ibid., pp. 214–220; Dedieu, , “La Nueva Planta,” pp. 127–129 Google Scholar. In particular, four characteristics distinguished the royal guards: 1) they were completely autonomous from the rest of the army, placed directly under the command of the king without the intervention of the secretary for war, the directors-general, or the inspectors of the armed forces; 2) they enjoyed an exclusive and privileged fuero, which meant that all matters of civil and criminal justice involving members of the guard would be dealt with by the commanding officers of the guard with appeals going directly to the king and not to the council of war; 3) their officers had their own promotional ladder and their rankings had particularly high equivalents in the regular army; and 4) given their status as a corps intended for the higher nobility, the social rank and status of their officers were subject to a more rigorous scrutiny before appointment.\n\n49. It was Iñigo de Acuña who requested on behalf of his half-brother the knighthood in the Order of Santiago that Acuña y Bejarano received in 1679, and it was he who sorted out the documents requested during the investigation of Juan de Acuña’s lineage. See “Pruebas … de Juan de Acuña,” AHN, OM-Santiago, Exp. 40. Although we know very little about Iñigo de Acuña’s career, there is no doubt that, at least until the ascension of the Bourbon dynasty, he had a fair degree of influence at court. He had secured for his son an appointment as a page in Carlos II’s household, as well as a second knighthood, and was himself made first marquis of Escalona in 1679. See Mañé, Rubio, El virreinato I, p. 268;Google Scholar and Jones, , “New Spain and the Viceregency,” p. 248.Google Scholar\n\n52. During the War of Succession, most, if not all the corregimientos located near the border with France and Portugal or along the coast were transformed into politico-military governorships. In Andalusia, for instance, this was the case in Almería, Matril, Malaga, Puerto de Santa Maria, Sanlucar, and Cadiz. At the same time, important settlements such as Granada, Jaén, Ronda, Antequera, and Ecija retained their cor-regimientos simply because they were further away from the coast and could not be so easily attacked. See Castillo, Andújar, “Capitanes generales y capitanías generales en el siglo XVIII,” p. 16.Google Scholar\n\n56. According to Andujar Castillo in the aforementioned work, p. 20, these two captaincies-general were never governed by a captain-general of the royal armies, something that happened at least once in all the others and almost uninterruptedly in Catalonia and Valencia. Moreover, the captaincies-general of Extremadura and Andalucía, along with those of Old Castile and Costa de Granada were the only ones in which the captain-general did not serve jointly as president of the audiencia.\n\n81.

See “Yndice de los despachos de SM que se entregan al Exmo. Sr. Marques de Valero, a qn ha hecho mrd del virreynato de Na. Spaña para que en su vrd le pueda servir, todos con fecha de 22 de noviembre de 1715,” AGI, Indiferente, 515, L.3, ff. 133r-134r. On the margin off. 134r. a note indicates that “On 22 April 1722 the same dispatches contained in this index were issued so that the marquis of Casafuerte could serve as viceroy of New Spain.”\n\n91. According to the records in AGI, Indiferente, 515, L.3, Casafuerte received the same instructions as the marquis of Valero (f. 134r), Valero received the same ones as the duke of Linares (f. 133r) and Linares received (f. 129v) a copy of the ones issued without a name on April 22, 1709, apparently in an updated pliego lie mortaja (instructions for the appointment of an interim viceroy in case of the incumbent’s death) for Albur-querque. The instructions of 1709 (ff. 68v-l 19r), comprising 63 chapters, were only marginally different from those given to Alburqucrque in 1702 (ff. 20v-57r).\n\n92. Nonetheless, we cannot tell for sure. The records of viceregal titles and dispatches kept by the secretary for New Spain in the council of the Indies during the first half of the eighteenth century (AGI, Indiferente, 515, L.3) are much less precise than those kept by the secretary for Peru (AGI, Indiferente, 513, L.4). Moreover, while the General Archive of the Indies contains a legajo with all the titles and instructions issued by the secretaries of state without the intervention of the Council of the Indies for the viceroys of Peru between 1718 and 1744 (AGI, Indiferente, 513, L.6); no equivalent exists for New Spain.\n\n95. See “Ynstruccion reservada de lo que el Marques de Castelfuerte ha de egecutar en el Peru luego de que tome posesión de aquel Virreynato,” AGI, Indiferente, 513, L.6, ff. 86r-91v. José Gutiérrez de Grimaldo, first marquis of Grimaldo, was one of Felipe V's most trusted ministers, a secretary of state from 1705 to 1726 and the leading figure of government between 1709 and 1710 and again from 1720 to 1724. See Concepción, de Castro, A la sombra de Felipe V. José de Grimaldo, ministro responsable (1703–1726) (Madrid: Marcial Pons, 2004);Google Scholar and Eissa-Barroso, , “Politics, Political Culture and Policy Making,” pp. 356–360.Google Scholar\n\n100. “Ynstruccion reservada de … el Marques de Castelfuerte,” AGI, Indiferente, 513, L.6, ff. 86v-87r. It should be noted, however, that the use of these expressions is not altogether unique and that essentially the same phrases were used to describe the third marquis of Villagarcia in the secret instructions he received upon his appointment as Castelfuerte’s replacement. See, “Ynstruccion [reservada] de lo que a de observebar el Marques dc Villa Garzia electo Virrey del Peru,” AGI, Indiferente, 513, L.6, ff. 91v-145r.\n\n103. As did all other Peruvian viceroys, Castelfuerte received a specific instruction to visit and examine both the fortresses and the garrisons of Tierra Firme and Cartagena on his way to Lima (“Sobre q Dn Joseph de Armendáriz Marqs de Castelfuerte visite y reconozca los castillos y fuerzas de Tierra Firme y Cartagena,” AGI, Indiferente, 513, L.4, ff. 367v-369r), but no additional or unique instructions were given in this or any other military matter. Of course, since both Castelfuerte and Casafuerte were appointed captains-general for the territories of their viceroyaltics—as were all other viceroys—they were involved in some ventures of strictly military nature. Casafuerte, in New Spain, dealt with the organization of expeditions to complete the conquest of Nayarit and expel the English from Belize, and he also showed particular interest in reforming the lives of soldiers in the chain of outposts or presidios that garrisoned the northern frontier of his viceroyalty. See Jones, , “New Spain and the Viceregency,” pp. 30–57, 132–155 and 161–71.Google Scholar Castelfuerte, in turn, was involved in organizing the expeditions sent to suppress the rebellions in Paraguay and had to deal with the defense and pacification of the southern borders in Chile and Tucumán as well as with Portuguese encroachments near Montevideo. See Cebrián, Moreno, El virreinato del marqués, pp. 287–322.Google Scholar\n\n114. Jones, , “New Spain and the Viceregency,” p. 14,Google Scholar refers to the letters of appointment issued to Casafuerte on April 22, 1722, which apparently made reference to “his many services to the crown, including the new viceroy’s position in the council of war and his commanding status in the royal armies.” I have been unable to access these documents, which are presumably located in AGI, Mexico, 1217.\n\n124. Cavo, Los tres siglos de Mexico, p. 135. Moreover, according to Cavo, Casafucrte’s “disinterested demeanor which he maintained for over twelve years … earned him not only the veneration and appreciation of everyone but also the many tears which were shed at his funeral.” Cavo’s work, originally titled “History of Mexico” or “Annals of Mexico City,” was written between 1791 and 1798, although it remained unpublished until Bustamante edited it in 1836.\n\n128. This is certainly the opinion of Jones, “New Spain and the Viceregency” ,p.87, according to whom Casafuerte “sought impartiality in his actions so that benefits from increased efficiency [in government] would accrue not only to the Peninsula, but also to the colony.”\n\n129. Undeniably, both viceroys produced significant improvements in the royal exchequers of their respective provinces. Both men reported having found the coffers empty and revenue insufficient to meet ordinary costs. By the end of their tenures, through programs of intensive savings and cuts, collection of amounts outstanding, projects carefully crafted to increase revenue, and tighter supervision of royal officials, they could each report significant improvements in the situation of the royal arks. See Jones, , “New Spain and the Viceregency,” pp. 63–69, 85–88, 209–214; and Moreno Cebrián, El virreinato del marquis, pp. 155–248.Google Scholar It is more difficult to judge the viceroys’ successes in dealing with contraband—a matter in which Jones, for instance, judged Casafuerte “no more successful than other officials before him” (p. 259). On the recommendations put forward by Casafuerte’s junta de medios (an adhoc committee charged with advising the viceroy on principles of fiscal governance) and his policies on illicit trade, see Jones, , “New Spain and the Viceregency,” pp. 69–73, 77–82, and 120–125. On Castelfuerte’s efforts to fight illicit trade see Moreno Cebrián, El virreinato del marques, pp. 208–228.Google Scholar\n\n130. Casafuerte fell ill in February 1734 and soon thereafter was so weak as to be unable to leave his bed. On the morning of March 17, 1734, he passed away in the viceregal palace of Mexico City at the age of 76. See Jones, “New Spain and the Viceregency,” pp. 246–247.\n\n140. Rubio Mañé, El virreinato I, p. 269. Other viceregal representatives of these new “middle classes” included, according to Rubio Mañe, the two counts of Rcvillagigedo, the marquises of Amarillas and Cruil-las, Matías Gálvcz and his son the count of Gálvez, and Manuel Antonio de Flores (pp. 269–270). The claim would perhaps be more accurate if we were to read “minor nobility” in place of “middle classes.”\n\n144. Two of the notable exceptions occurred in the reign of Felipe V: the third marquis of Villagarcia, immediate successor of Castelfuerte, and the fifth count of Fuenclara, viceroy of New Spain from 1742 to 1746. Very little is known of the former; the latter was a diplomat who had played a key role in securing the marriage of the future Carlos III and was himself married to José Patiño’s niece."
