        "text": "The Military Order of Saint James of the Sword (Ordem Militar de Sant'Iago da Espada) is a military order of chivalry with its roots in the Spanish Order of Santiago.\n\nKnight with a shield bearing the insignia of the order\n\nHistory\n\nThe order was founded in 1172 after the establishment of the Order of Santiago two years earlier in Spain. The Spanish order's main function was to escort pilgrims to the shrine of St. James in Santiago de Compostela during the Christian Reconquista of the Iberian Peninsula. The Portuguese branch of the order, was founded by Afonso I of Portugal, (Afonso Henriques), the first King of Portugal. Afonso granted them varies lands and properties including the Castle of Monsanto and also Abrantes Castle.\n\nHowever, Afonso fell out with the order and expelled them from Portugal. They returned in 1186 during the reign of Sancho I and were given land and castles in Alcácer do Sal, Almada and Palmela. King Denis I separated the Portuguese order from its Spanish equivalent in 1288, which was confirmed by the Pope in 1320.\n\nAfonso de Albuquerque, Portuguese Governor of the Indies (1509-1515), wearing a cloak with the cross of the Order of Santiago\n\nOver the centuries, the order evolved and played a significant role in various military and diplomatic endeavors. During the Age of Discoveries in the 15th and 16th centuries, members of the order were involved in maritime exploration particulary to India and played a role in the overseas expansion of the Portuguese Empire. Vasco da Gama, Paulo da Gama, D. Francisco de Almeida, D. Afonso de Albuquerque and Duarte de Meneses, were all leading knights of the Order of Saint James.\n\nAs a reward for their service, members of the order received lands, titles, and privileges both at home and overseas.\n\nWith the decline of the Portuguese Empire in the 17th and 18th centuries, the importance of chivalric orders also diminished. However, the Order of Saint James of the Sword persisted, and its focus shifted to charitable and cultural activities. In the 20th century, it became a civilian honor, and its role as a military order no longer exists.\n\nThe Grand Master is now the President of the Portuguese Republic.\n\nBadge, collar and star of the order\n\nHonor\n\nToday, the Order of Saint James of the Sword is a prestigious honor awarded by the President of Portugal. It is granted to individuals who have made significant contributions to the country in various fields, including public service, culture, science, and diplomacy. The order is divided into several classes, each with its own criteria and distinctions. It continues to be an important symbol of recognition and merit in Portuguese society.\n\n© PortugalVisitor.com"
