        "text": "Royal Knights (Early) Unit Type: Knights Combat Stats Charge: 8 Attack: 4 Defence: 3 Armour: 4 Shield: Cavalry Speed: 9, 20, 22 Morale: 8 Notes: Elite, Impetuous Dismounts to: Feudal Foot Knights Unit Costs Recruitment: 325 Upkeep: 62 Unit Restrictions Eras: Early Factions: Aragonese, Burgundians, Danes, English, French, Holy Roman Empire, Hungarians, Italians, Papacy, Poles, Sicilians, Spanish Buildings Needed: Royal Court Unit Card:\n\nUnit Description\n\nEarly Royal Knights are the first knight unit available in the campaign, trainable in the Early period and with a fairly low build requirement. Statistically, they are the same as Feudal Knights, but have only 20 Royal Knights (regardless of unit size option) compared to the 40 available in default sized Knight units.\n\nRoyal Knight tactics are the same as most Knight units: flank the enemy, charge them in the rear, repeat as necessary. Avoid frontal charges into spear and pike units, avoid polearm units unless an instant rout is assured, and avoid camels. Like most Knights, they are Elite and Impetuous, and care must be taken to avoid situations that put them at a disadvantage, especially if they contain a royal family member. Their small unit size must also be taken into account, they will not have the same impact as a full sized knight unit and can be overwhelmed if they are not watched over carefully.\n\nRoyal Knights serve as the royal bodyguard units for all Catholic factions except for the Swiss. The faction leader and heirs will appear on the campaign map leading early Royal Knight units in the Early period, and will all be upgraded to High Royal Knights when the High period starts (existing non-royal units, including \"royal uncles\" will not be upgraded). As they cannot be retrained in High or beyond, maintaining units of early Royal Knights beyond year 1205 can be a tough task, and keeping around an uber-general in an obsolete unit can be difficult.\n\nIn siege battles, they may be dismounted for Feudal Foot Knights."
