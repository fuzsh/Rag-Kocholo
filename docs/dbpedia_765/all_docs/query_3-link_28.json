        "text": "The first Afro-Brazilian to be awarded a knighthood in the Portuguese Order of Santiago seems to have been the light-skinned mulatto, Manuel Gonçalves Doria. In 1628 he was rewarded by King Philip IV with the habit and knighthood, as well as an annual pension of 20$ or 20 milreis, for his eight years of service as a soldier and captain (through 1627) and, especially for his bravery in Bahia in 1624 and 1625, fighting against the Dutch when they captured and occupied Salvador, the capital of Brazil. A letter from the crown praised him as “the prime mover behind the attacks and ambushes” which the Portuguese made as the Dutch occupiers tried to expand their military presence beyond the city limits. So great were his exploits during the Dutch invasion that the Portuguese-born Jesuit priest Bartolomeu Guerreiro, in his Jornada dos Vassalos da Coroa de Portugal, published in Lisbon in 1625, highlighted several examples of his derringdo. Not to be outdone, the Bahian-born Franciscan Frei Vicente do Salvador gave Gonçalves Doria's actions against the Dutch at least eleven mentions in his História do Brasil. But as Manuel and many of his contemporaries would discover, it was one thing to be awarded a knighthood and another to receive the authorization for the ceremonies to be performed.\n\n1 See consulta of 26 April 1641 in Arquivo Nacional da Torre do Tombo (cited hereafter as ANTT), Habilitações da Ordem de Santiago (cited hereafter as HOS), Letra M, Maço 4, Número 42, fol. 157. Six documents are included in Doria’s above-mentioned dossier: 1) consulta of Mesa da Consciência e Ordens dated 16 July 1630 (unnumbered); 2) undated petition of Manuel Gonçalves Doria on the eve of returning to Brazil (pre-June 1630) (unnumbered); 3) consulta of the Mesa da Consciência e Ordens, dated 26 April 1641 (fols. 157–162); 4) consulta of the Mesa da Consciência e Ordens, dated 9 September 1641 (fols. 156–156v); 5) consulta of the Mesa da Consciència e Ordens, dated 6 August 1642 (fols. 346–350v); 6) consulta of the Mesa da Consciência e Ordens, dated 16 October 1647 (fol. 156). A seventh document, erroneously filed in a new dossier under the name Manuel Gonçalves, Letra M, Maço 5, Número 29, contains correspondence with the Mesa da Consciência e Ordens, dated 20 April 1630. The original notarized background investigations are missing. For a recent overview of the recapture of Bahia in 1625, see Schwartz, Stuart B. “The Voyage of the Vassals: Royal Power, Noble Obligations, and Merchant Capital before the Portuguese Restoration of Independence, 1624–1640,” The American Historical Review, 96:3 (June 1991), 735–762.CrossRefGoogle Scholar\n\n13 See Saunders, A.C. de C.M. “The Life and Humour of João de Sá Panasco, o Negro, Former Slave, Court Jester and Gentleman of the Portuguese Royal Household (fl. 1524–1567)” in Hodcroft, F.W. et al., Mediaeval and Renaissance Studies on Spain and Portugal in Honor of P. E. Russell (Oxford: Society for the Study of Mediaeval Languages and Literature, 1981), p. 183.Google Scholar To date, the best evidence that João de Sá Panasco was a knight of Santiago is dito 402: “Zombando Fernão Cardoso com João de Sá, o Negro, diante de el-rei, correu-se João de Sá; e Fernão Cardoso, assoprando-lhe no habito de Sant’Iago que trazia, disse a el-rei: — Senhor, assopro esta brasa, porque se apaga este carvão.\" In Descon-hecido, Autor, Ditos Portugueses Dignos de Memória. História Íntima do Século XVI. Anotada e comentada por Saraiva, José H. 3rd ed. (Lisbon: Publicações Europa-America, 1997), p. 152.Google Scholar Brasa refers to the red cross of the Order of Santiago on the front of their black habits.\n\n15 See the Biblioteca Nacional’s Ementas de Habilitações de Ordens Militares nos Principios do Século XVII (hereafter cited as Ementas) (Lisbon: Biblioteca Nacional, 1931), pp. 86–87, and the consulta of the Mesa da Consciência e Ordens, dated 6 August 1642 in ANTT, HOS, Letra M, Maço 4, Número 42, fol. 346. According to the Ementas, Manuel’s paternal grandparents were Jacome Martins and Catarina Pires who were born in Porto. One witness claimed that young Isabel was ten years old when she left Porto for Bahia. See consulta of 26 April 1641, ANTT, HOS, Letra M, Maço 4, Número 42, fol. 139v.\n\n21 Despite various regulations prohibiting anyone of New Christian background from becoming a member of the military orders, it was possible for those with such a background to obtain dispensations— though usually papal as well as royal ones were required. This was true both before the 1627 reformed statutes for all three orders as well as after (until the early 1670s). See Olival, Fernanda, “Para um Estudo da Nobilitação no Antigo Regime: Os Cristãos Novos na Ordem de Cristo (1581–1621)” in As Ordens Militares em Portugal (Palmela: Câmara Municipal de Palmela, 1991), pp. 233–244.Google Scholar Regulations against the admission of New Christians into the military orders began to harden during the reign of King Sebastian (1557–1578), especially with his regimento on the subject dated 6 February 1572. Despite the strong language both in this regimento and the 1627 statutes, during the last years of Habsburg rule in Portugal (1635–1640) thirteen New Christians received dispensations to become knights of Santiago. For these thirteen—all of whom remained loyal to Philip IV—see Dutra, Francis A., “The Restoration of 1640, the Ausentes em Castela, and the Portuguese Military Orders: Santiago, a Case Study” in dos Santos, João Camilo and Williams, Frederick G. eds., O Amor das Letras e das Gentes. In Honor of Maria de Lourdes Belchior Pontes (Santa Barbara: Center for Portuguese Studies, University of California at Santa Barbara, 1995), p. 118.Google Scholar\n\n33 See respectively, ANTT, COC, liv. 13, fol. 203v; liv. 9, fol. 63v; and liv. 21, fol. 54v. As an inducement for him to serve in Brazil, he was issued an alvará dated 14 March 1625, allowing him to use the receipts of his three commanderies for four years to pay his debts if he died in Brazil. The following day he was promised a commandery valued at $400 annually. Later that year, on 20 September, he was granted $100 annually from the commandery of São Martinho de Pombal. See Ibid., liv. 12, fol. 39v and fol. 36v.\n\n38 The reorganization had been ordered by the Crown on 12 June 1626 and implemented by the governor-general Diogo Luís de Oliveira on 31 August 1627. See Biblioteca da Ajuda (hereafter cited as BA), 49–X–7, fol. 136. For a brief sketch of the military structure of seventeenth-century Brazil, see “A Note on Portuguese and Brazilian Military Organization” by Schwartz, Stuart B. in Sierra, Juan Lopes, A Governor and His Image in Baroque Brazil. The Funeral Eulogy of Afonso Furtado de Castro do Rio de Mendonça. Schwartz, Stuart B. ed., Jones, Ruth E. trans. (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 1979), pp. 173–177.Google Scholar In 1638, because of the Dutch threat, there were four terços in Bahia: 1) the Terço Velho with Giovanni Vincenzo de San Felice, Count of Bagnuoli, as mestre de campo; 2) the Terço Novo with Luís Barbalho Bezerra as mestre de campo; 3) the Terço de Castela (also known as the Spanish Infantry Terço) with João Ortiz as mestre de campo; 4) the Terço de Napoles with Heitor de LaCalche as mestre de campo. See de Vilhasanti, Pedro Cadena, Relação Diária do Cêrco da Bahia de 1638. Serafim Leite, S.J. and Múrias, Manuel eds. (Lisbon: Editorial Ática, 1941), pp. 147–156.Google Scholar\n\n43 For this or a similar investigation, see Schwartz, Stuart B., Sovereignty and Society in Colonial Brazil. The High Court of Bahia and its Judges, 1609–1751 (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1973), p. 199.Google Scholar For other complaints against Oliveira, see the undated document entitled “Queixas que Lourenço de Brito Correa faz a S. Mag. das vexações, opressões publicas, injustiças e roubos que Diogo Luiz de Oliveira, Governador do Brasil, cometeu naquelle Estado,” BA, 49–X–10, fol. 320. The king’s response is dated 28 August 1631, BA, 51–VI–3, fol. 29v. See also the letters of the governor of Portugal, dated 14 February 1632 (BA, 51–VI–4, fol. 212v) and the king, dated 15 December 1632, (BA, 51–VI–6, fol. 54v). On 27 August 1633 Lourenço was identified as Captain Lourenço de Brito Correa, Fidalgo da Casa de Sua Magestade. See Livro Velho do Tombo do Mosteiro de São Bento da Cidade do Salvador (Bahia: Tipografia Beneditina, 1945), p. 80. Other complaints about the “molestias e vexações” caused by the governor-general are found in the letters of Francisco Soares de Abreu, provedor-mor da fazenda: Letter to the king, dated 20 November 1629, BA, 49–X–10, fol. 144; letters to the king, 25 September and 1 October 1630, BA, 51–X–12, fols. 154, 208, 290 and 370. Oliveira’s retaliation against Soares de Abreu is discussed in the latter’s letter of 3 February 1632, BA, 49–X–12, fol. 22. See also the response of the Conselho da Fazenda in documents dated 11 December 1635, BA, 49–X–10, fol. 165. The case dragged on even after Soares de Abreu’s death. See the consulta of 30 March 1640, BA, 51–V–6, fol. 286. The governor-general imprisoned Lourenço de Brito Correia. See the king’s letters of 18 March and 15 December 1632 in BA, 51–VI–4, fol. 60v and 51–VI–6, fol. 54v, respectively.\n\n45 Clearly, his military experience as mestre do campo in Flanders and the dangers Brazil was facing from Dutch attack—Pernambuco had been invaded in February of 1630—go far to explain King Philip IV’s reluctance to remove him from office. Oliveira was praised for readying Bahia defensively and for defending the Brazilian capital against the two attacks of Piet Heyn in 1627. See the praise given Oliveira in de Melo, D. Francisco Manuel, Epanáforas de Vária História Portuguesa, 3rd ed., Prestage, Edgar ed. (Coimbra: Imprensa da Universidade, 1931), pp. 378–379.Google Scholar For a favorable account by a modem historian of Oliveira’s three terms as governor-general, see Calmon, , História do Brasil 2, 530.Google Scholar\n\n46 However, both Matias de Albuquerque (former governor-general of Brazil and superintendent of the war against the Dutch in Pernambuco until 1635) and Diogo Luís de Oliveira, after having arrived in northern Portugal upon returning with the fleet from Brazil in 1636, were ordered to be taken into custody. Albuquerque was imprisoned in Castelo da Vide and Oliveira in Tomar, while official investigations (devassas) were being undertaken by Francisco de Andrade Leitão and Jorge Correia de Lacerda. See letter of King to Vicereine of Portugal, Princess Margarida, Madrid, 11 August 1636, BA, 51–VI–8, fol. 40. Albuquerque remained under arrest until the Portuguese Restoration. Oliveira was freed and in 1637 served in Cantabria as mestre de campo under the Neapolitan D. Francisco Carrafa, Duke of Nochera, to defend northern Spain against the French armies of Louis XIII. However, both men incurred the displeasure of the Count-Duke of Olivares and were imprisoned. For the death of Oliveira in prison, see de Melo, D. Francisco Manuel, Ecco Polytico. Responde en Portugal a la Voz de Castilla (Lisbon: Paulo Craesbeeck, 1645),Google Scholar pp. llv–12. For more on Oliveira after his service in Brazil, see the same author’s Epanáforas, pp. 42; 64; 142–143. Oliveira was still dealing with repercussions from his actions as governor-general of Brazil as late as 26 March 1639. See consulta of that date in BA, 51–V–6, fol. 201.\n\n56 DH XVII, p. 38. He probably arrived shortly before 18 July 1630, for on that day Captain Santos da Costa,”who only a few days earlier had arrived from Portugal,” was killed in a skirmish against the Dutch. See Albuquerque Coelho, Duarte de, Memórias Diárias da Guerra do Brasil, 1630–1638 (Recife: Secretaria do Interior, 1944), pp. 41–42,Google Scholar under the entry of 18 July. This is a Portuguese translation of Memórias Diárias de la Gverra del Brasil (Madrid: Diego Diaz de la Carrera, 1654). Duarte was the fourth lord-proprietor of Pernambuco. Matias de Albuquerque was Duarte’s younger brother.\n\n62 See Coelho, Albuquerque, Memórias Diárias, p. 42.Google Scholar Bento Maciel Parente should not be confused with his illegitimate son with the same name. The younger Bento Maciel Parente’s mother was an Amerindian from São Paulo. The younger Bento possibly was conceived when his father was in São Paulo with D. Francisco de Sousa about 1609. The Brazilian-born younger Bento was awarded a knighthood in the Order of Christ on 5 April 1644 for his services in Brazil and in Portugal during the Wars of Restoration. This Bento received permission to have the São Paulo or maternal part of his background investigation held in Lisbon (the paternal part being conducted in Viana and Caminha). A number of impediments were discovered: His father’s father was a tailor, his maternal grandparents were pagans from Brazil, and he himself was illegitimate. Though in a consulta dated 20 July 1644, the Mesa da Consciència e Ordens recommended a dispensation because of Bento’s services at the front in the Wars of Restoration, King João IV refused. There is no record in the registry books of the Order of Christ that the younger Bento ever received the knighthood he had been awarded, though, earlier, he was made a fidalgo da casa real. See ANTT, Habilitações da Ordem de Cristo (cited hereafter as HOC), Letra B, Maço 12, Número 85. His award of the knighthood in the Order of Christ is found in Inventario dos Livros das Portarias do Reino (cited hereafter as IPR) 2 vols. (Lisbon: Imprensa Nacional, 1909–1912), I, p. 94. See fn. 80 below\n\n71 The confession and the identification of Isabel Fernandes are found in Gonsalves de Mello, José António ed., Confîssões de Pernambuco 1594–1595 (Recife: Universidade Federal de Pernambuco, 1970), pp. 118–119.Google Scholar There is no Isabel Fernandes from Itamaracá in the two volumes of Inquisition records from Licenciado Heitor Furtado de Mendoça’s visit to Bahia, 1591–1593, that have been published. See de Abreu, João Capistrano ed., Primeira Visitação do Santo Officio ás Partes do Brasil. Confissões Bahia, 1591–1592 (Rio de Janeiro: F. Briguiet & Ca., 1935)Google Scholar and de Abreu, João Capistrano ed., Primeira Visitação do Santo Officio ás Partes do Brasil. Denunciações da Bahia, 1591–1593 (São Paulo: Homenagem de Paulo Prado, 1925).Google Scholar Finally, none of the women with the name Isabel Fernandes denounced to the Inquisition in Pernambuco, Itamaracá, and Paraiba between 1593–1595 fit the description of the Isabel Fernandes from Itamaracá. See de Mendoça, Heitor Furtado, Primeira Visitação do Santo Officio ás Partes do Brasil. Denunciações de Pernambuco, 1593–1595 (São Paulo: Homenagem de Paulo Prado, 1929).Google Scholar\n\n78 DH XVII, 145–148. See also Ibid., pp. 468–469. Duarte de Albuquerque Coelho, who was in the Brazilian capital at the time, calls him Francisco Gonçalves. In an entry dated 26 April 1638, Albuquerque Coelho mentioned the exploits of Francisco Gonçalves, brother of Captain Manuel Gonçalves Doria, both natives of Bahia, fighting the Dutch. See Memórias Diárias, p. 284. According to his patent, Francisco had been serving the crown since 1625 and had played an important role in driving the Dutch from the Brazilian capital that year.\n\n80 de Vilhasanti, Cadena, Relação Diària, p. 52.Google Scholar See also pp. 314–315 for Manuel Múrias’s list of documents on the military career of Gonçalves Doria. Manuel’s brother Francisco was rewarded for his bravery against the Dutch in 1638 by being granted an “escudo de vantagem.” Ibid., p. 262. A copy of the award is found in DH XVII, 468–469. This document makes special mention of Francisco’s services against the Dutch forces on 18 May 1638. It also states that Francisco’s father—and presumably Manuel’s father as well—was killed during the 1638 Dutch attack on Bahia, . Ibid., p. 469.Google Scholar\n\n81 For his services on the armada headed by the 1st Count of Torre, see the consulta of 26 April 1641 in ANTT, HOS, Letra M, Maço 4, Número 42, fol. 158. The 1641 consulta states: “E porqto elle supplicante tornou acontinuar na guerra do Brasil desde o dito ano de 1638 ate o passado de 1640 que foi na armada do Conde da Torre e veo deRotado a esta cidade de Indias.” The 1642 consulta gives the impression that he never left Brazil until 1640—“em que se embarcou na armada do Conde da Torre e foi deRotada a Indias.” See fol. 347v. The Count of Torre’s armada left Lisbon in September of 1638. After much loss of life by disease off the Cape Verde islands, the armada arrived in Bahia in 1639. After obtaining reinforcements and supplies, it set sail on 19 November 1639 to attack Dutch-held Pernambuco. For the Count of Torre’s expedition, see Boxer, C.R. Salvador de Sá and the Struggle for Brazil and Angola, 1602-1686 (London: The Athlone Press, 1952), pp. 116–120.Google Scholar\n\n83 Ibid., fol. 157. King João IV (r. 1640–1656), especially in the early years of his reign—in contrast to his widow Queen Luisa when she served as regent (1656–1662) for young Afonso VI—was reluctant to grant dispensations, especially to those born in Brazil, despite their excellent services. Another good example is the case of the Paraiban-born Feliciano Dourado. On 12 April 1642, Dourado, a future member of the newly-created Portuguese Overseas Council was awarded a knighthood in Santiago. IPR I, 42. He was serving as secretary to the Portuguese embassy to the Netherlands. Dourado’s initial background investigation revealed that his paternal grandfather had been a carpenter and that little was known about his grandmother—though both were from Portalegre in Portugal. The Mesa da Consciència e Ordens in a consulta dated 19 May 1642, recommended a dispensation. On 21 May and 27 October 1642 King João demanded further diligence by the Mesa in obtaining more information about Dourado's maternal grandmother. On 6 February 1643, the Portuguese monarch ordered the Mesa to follow the statutes of the order. It was not until 19 July 1644 that King João IV authorized the dispensation. See ANTT, HOS, Letra F, Maço 2, Número 6. The carta de hábito was dated 23 August 1644 and authorized that the ceremonies take place in the Netherlands. ANTT, COS, liv. 15, fols. 137–137v."
