        "text": "Hotel Poeta Manrique, the perfect place to imbibe the rich heritage and cultural history of Segura de la Sierra, with its impressive castle and the church of Santa María del Collado as its main claims. Stay with us and follow the trace of Jorge Manrique, who wrote part of his immortal verses in some of our rooms, according to some documents.\n\nExperience nature and history as never before in Hotel Poeta Manrique.\n\nSegura de la Sierra, as every region in Sierra de Segura, is distinguished by its wide mountain range, which stands out for its huge natural and forest richness, with the olive tree as the predominant crop, its agriculture and cattle raising.\n\nAll and each little and scattered inhabited places that make it up are located in magnificent landscape enclaves. Due to its location and architectural features, Hotel Poeta Manrique is a perfect place to deepen the natural variety, history and monumental heritage that make Segura de la Sierra a picturesque village of unquestionable beauty and the entrance to the Natural Park Sierras de Cazorla, Segura y las Villas. Experience nature in its purest form with outdoor activities like hiking, cycling, parachuting, bungee jumping or vias ferratas.\n\nHotel Poeta Manrique is a place where everything has been conceived and planned to guarantee quietness and rest to our guests. An eco-friendly building that respects the natural environment that surrounds it.\n\nA rural accommodation that conveys emotions and with everything the visitor needs to find the desirable atmosphere and comfort.\n\nWe believe in comfort, so the whole place is domotized. Our six rooms, apart from bathroom, smart TV and high speed Wi-Fi connection with optic fiber, have high quality beds, mattresses and linen for your enjoyment and relax, without forgetting to mention the amazing views to the leafy valley and the mountains.\n\nHis childhood and early adolescence probably elapsed in Siles and Segura de la Sierra. Rodrigo Manrique had a determining role in the life of the poet and tried to make him in his image and likeness through his education. He studied humanities and the proper duties of a Castilian military man. He assumed the line of the political and military role of his extended Castilian family.\n\nHe fought the Muslims, took part in the uprising of the nobles against Enrique IV of Castile, intervened in the victory of Ajofrín and fought for Isabel and Juana la Beltraneja in the Castilian succession war.\n\nWhen he was 24 years old he took part in the battles of the siege of the Montizón castle (Villamanrique, Ciudad Real), where he gained reputation and prestige as a warrior. His motto was ‘I neither lie nor regret’. He was made prisoner in Baeza for a while, where his brother Rodrigo died after his military entry in the city to help their allies, the Benavides, against the royal delegates (the Count of Cabra and and the Marshal of Baena). He later enrolled into the troops on the side of Isabel and Fernando in the war against the parties of Juana la Beltraneja.\n\nAs the queen lieutenant in Cuidad Real together with his father Rodrigo, he lifted the siege of Uclés, which was directed by Juan Pacheco and Alfonso Carrillo de Acuña, archbishop of Toledo. In that war, in a skirmish near the castle of Garcimuñoz in Cuenca defended by the Marquis of Villena, he was fatally wounded in 1479, probably near spring.\n\nThe work of Jorge Manrique has influenced many later authors that showed great interest and admiration for his poetry, especially for the Coplas por la muerte de su padre (verses on the death of this father). His verses have been widely recreated and survived through time as an inspiration source.\n\nCoplas por la muerte de su padre\n\nAmong his whole work, Coplas por la muerte de su padre stands out in a unique way linking tradition and originality. Jorge Manrique gives funeral eulogy or cry on his father, Rodrigo Manrique, showing him as a model of heroism, virtues and serenity against death. The poem is one of the classical in the Spanish literature of all times and has entered the cannon of universal literature.\n\nDocument from 1721 that explains the door of the so-called house of Jorge Manrique where it is written up who built the door with the shield of the Figueroa family.\n\nIn the text it is said: they have their door of stone with a shield of weapons of the name Figueroa graven in stone that seems made when the commander was Don Lorenzo Suárez de Figueroa.\n\nThey must have made the door around 1575.\n\nIt is possible that it is a part of the capital. Tuscan style, typical from the XVI century."
