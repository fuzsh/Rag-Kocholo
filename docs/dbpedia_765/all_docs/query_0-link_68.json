        "text": "This essay focuses on a unique Mexican folding screen (biombo) created in Mexico in the 17th century depicting a mitote (Moctezuma dance), Indian wedding, and flying pole (Los Angeles County Museum of Art). The text expands the author's earlier analysis of the screen (Casta Painting, 2004; Una visión del México del Siglo de las Luces, 2006), placing it within the context of Amerindian and viceregal festive traditions. Soon after the conquistador Hernán Cortés defeated the Mexica (commonly known as the Aztec) in 1521, their capital, Tenochtitlan, with its striking ceremonial center, was transformed into a Spanish city, the new locus of Spanish power and the setting for the emergence of a host of new political and religious rites. While in many ways these festive apparatuses introduced new forms of ritual and advanced a key new message—the willing submission to the Catholic prince—the indigenous communities of Central Mexico had had ample experience with highly ostentatious forms of ritual since pre-Hispanic times. This essay examines a number of texts and images that underscore the participation of Amerindians in festive rites in seventeenth-and eighteenth-century Mexico. Panegyric texts such as those describing the entry of a new viceroy or the ceremony of allegiance to a new monarch were carefully constructed to spread the idea of good governance. Native participation remained a fixture of many of these celebrations; how indigenous participants were represented and by whom are more complicated questions that are addressed in this essay.\n\nFive interrelated case studies from the sixteenth to the twentieth centuries develop the dynamic contrast between portraiture and pictorial genres newly invented in and about Latin America that do not represent their subjects as individuals despite the descriptive focus on the particular. From Jean de Léry’s genre-defining proto-ethnographic text (1578) about the Tupinamba of Brazil to the treatment of the Creole upper class in New Spain as persons whose individuality deserves to be memorialized in contrast to the Mestizaje, African, and Indian underclass objectified as types deserving of scientific study, hierarchical distinctions between portraiture and ethnographic images can be framed in historical terms around the Aristotelian categories of the universal, the individual, and the particular. There are also some intriguing examples that destabilize these inherited distinctions, such as Puerto Rican artist José Campeche’s disturbing and poignant image of a deformed child, Juan Pan...\n\nFive interrelated case studies from the sixteenth to the twentieth centuries develop the dynamic contrast between portraiture and pictorial genres newly invented in and about Latin America that do not represent their subjects as individuals despite the descriptive focus on the particular.

There are also some intriguing examples that destabilize these inherited distinctions, such as Puerto Rican artist José Campeche's disturbing and poignant image of a deformed child, Juan Pantaléon Aviles, 1808; and an imaginary portrait of Moctezuma II, c. 1697, based on an ethnographic image, attributed to the leading Mexican painter Antonio Rodriguez. These anomalies serve to focus the study on the hegemonic position accorded to the viewing subject as actually precarious and unstable, always ripe for reinterpretation at the receiving end of European culture. Resumo: Cinco estudos de caso interligados, abrangendo o período entre os séculos XVI e século XX, desenvolvem o contraste dinâmico entre retrato e novos gêneros pictóricos inventados na e sobre a América Latina, que não representam seus sujeitos como indivíduos, apesar da ênfase descritiva no elemento particular. Do texto proto-etnográfico e inaugurador de gênero, Jean de Léry (1578) sobre os Tupinambá do Brasil, ao tratamento dado à classe dominante Criole na Nova Espanha, como pessoas que merecem ser lembradas, em oposição à Mestizaje, aos africanos e aos indígenas das classes subalternas, objetificados como tipos merecedores de estudos científicos, distinções hierárquicas entre o retrato e imagens etnográficas podem ser enquadradas em termos históricos, sob as categorias aristotélicas do universal e do particular. Alguns exemplos intrigantes também existem, que desestabilizam essas distinções herdadas, tais como a imagem perturbadora e pungente da criança deformada, Juan Pantaléon Aviles, pintada pelo artista porto-riquenho José Campeche em 1808; e um retrato imaginário de Montezuma II, de c. 1697, baseado em uma imagem etnográfica atribuída ao reputado pintor mexicano Antonio Rodriguez. Essas anomalias servem para focar o estudo na posição hegemônica atribuída ao observador, denunciando-a como de fato precária e instável, sempre pronta para reinterpretação junto ao polo receptor da cultura europeia.\n\nWalk into the historical museums of Lima and Buenos Aires today, and some of the first paintings you encounter are viceroy portraits. Commissioned and painted primarily during the eighteenth century, these imposing and innovative works of art launched the genre of political portraiture in South America. Often contrasted as socio-political opposites, Lima and Buenos Aires embraced similar artistic practices, social traditions, and innovative political tactics between 1750 and 1824. The viceroy portrait series were not only embedded in the Spanish colonial governance of the sub-continent, they were commissioned by the urban municipal councils as tools to be activated in local power negotiations. Official portraiture was an integral component of the late-colonial remapping of political and cultural boundaries. Visual and textual evidence, including parallel portrait traditions, public ritual and discourse, personal correspondence, and government records, provide the basis for contextualizing the viceregal portrait sub-genre within a cultural history of late-colonial South American portraiture. This study demonstrates that the viceroys, local elites, and their visually receptive subjects exploited portrait paintings and their display to construct municipal identities and to negotiate intra-continental political relationships. Portraiture became increasingly relevant in the dynamic social context of late eighteenth-century Lima and Buenos Aires. Municipal elites collaborated with artists in adjusting pictorial convention to make portraiture the primary cultural medium for self-identification. Cultural discourse in both cities focused on authority, a tangible and localized form of power, as an essential component of official identities. Political authority was conceptually debated and overtly contested in portrait paintings. As the viceregal portraits reveal, the viceroys, city councils, and their subjects carved out spheres of distinct but overlapping influence in an environment where boundaries were porous and negotiable. This comparative analysis of visual culture in the Viceroyalties of Peru and Rio de la Plata contributes to a broader socio-cultural understanding of the impact of art on imperial dynamics, asymmetrical power relations, and modes of constructing identity. Ultimately, the performance of power in official portrait collections became the foundation for the visual culture of nationhood in both Peru and Argentina."
