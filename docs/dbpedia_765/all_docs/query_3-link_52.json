Typical of this period is the Cervelliere Helmet. Towards the end of the 12th century. He begins the dualism between Bascinet, which is linked to the helmet Cervelliera and from which derive the following helmets to war, and the real combat helmet, which will develop the helmets knight tournament, and parade. In the 13th century. helmet became more closed and eventually cover the entire scalp; characteristic is the helmet cylinder-conical holes for breathing, with one or two horizontal slits for the eyes. In the 14th century. the helmet is developing increasingly perfecting the defensive point of view; often with the addition of the Cervelliere chainmail was reinforced, which grew into Barbute; Bascinet was added to the visor, it is particularly heavy helmets used in the most brutal fighting. This page highlights medieval helmets wearables.
