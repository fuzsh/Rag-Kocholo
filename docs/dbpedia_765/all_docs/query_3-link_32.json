        "text": "We create our paintings with museum quality and covering the highest academic standards. Once we get your order, it will be entirely hand-painted with oil on canvas. All the materials we use are the highest level, being totally artist graded painting materials and linen canvas.\n\nWe will add 1.6\" (4 cm) additional blank canvas all over the painting for stretching.\n\nHigh quality and detailing in every inch are time consuming. The reproduction of Tiziano Vecellio Titian also needs time to dry in order to be completely ready for shipping, as this is crucial to not be damaged during transportation.\n\nBased on the size, level of detail and complexity we need 8-9 weeks to complete the process.\n\nIn case the delivery date needs to be extended in time, or we are overloaded with requests, there will be an email sent to you sharing the new timelines of production and delivery.\n\nTOPofART wants to remind you to keep patient, in order to get you the highest quality, being our mission to fulfill your expectations.\n\nWe not stretch and frame our oil paintings due to several reasons:\n\nPainting reproduction is a high quality expensive product, which we cannot risk to damage by sending it being stretched.\n\nAlso, there are postal restrictions, regarding the size of the shipment.\n\nAdditionally, due to the dimensions of the stretched canvas, the shipment price may exceed the price of the product itself.\n\nYou can stretch and frame your painting in your local frame-shop."
