        "text": "Â p441Â Biographical Notes\n\n(beginning:Â A)\n\nIn preparing the sketches that follow, the editor and translator found Virgilio Figueroa's Diccionario histÃ³rico yÂ biogrÃ¡fico deÂ Chile peculiarly useful. It covers much the same ground and largely supersedes the older work of Pedro Pablo Figueroa, Diccionario biogrÃ¡fico deÂ Chile. P.Â P.Â Figueroa is not a relative of Virgilio. Both writers are charged with numerous minor errors and often show a partisan bias, but they give us details that can be found nowhere else. An attempt has been made to check their accounts with those of other writers but in many cases, particularly for recent events, their statements have had to be accepted in lieu of more authoritative ones. For the colonial period the scholar­ly work of JosÃ© Toribio Medina, Diccionario biogrÃ¡fico colonial deÂ Chile, is essential. All three of these compilations have been supplemented by JosÃ© Espasa's Enciclopedia universal ilustrada, Europeo-Americana.\n\nIn order to simplify the references to these three authorities, the editor has adopted the following abbreviations: Espasa,Â \"E\"; Figueroa,Â \"F\"; Medina,Â \"M.\" Because of his numerous references to Historia jeneral deÂ Chile (see p354) of Diego Barros Arana, he has also made use of the initialÂ \"B\" for that writer. Use has also been made of Who's Who in Latin America, edited by Percy Alvin Martin (Stanford, 1935). All other references in the Biographical Notes are given in full.\n\nJosÃ© Fernando Abascal yÂ Souza (1743â1827), MarquÃ©s deÂ laÂ Concordia, a native of Oviedo, entered the army inÂ 1762, fought in Morocco and at Roussillon,Âº and became a general in the war against France, 1793â1795. InÂ 1804, after service in Cuba and Mexico, he was appointed viceroy of Peru. Captured by the English while on his way to that post, he eventually escaped and assumed command there. During the invasion of Spain by Napoleon's forces, he exerted himself to send supplies and munitions to the mother country. He introduced many reforms in the viceroyalty, such as establishing schools and abolishing the Inquisition, and especially strove to maintain harmonious relations between the Spaniards and Creoles â hence his title. After the revolutionary outbreak in Buenos Aires on MayÂ 25, 1810, he proceeded to incorporate the neighboring provinces of CÃ³rdoba, PotosÃ­, LaÂ Paz, and Charcas with his viceroyalty. He formed within his jurisdiction a royalist party that did much to suppress insurrection. Nevertheless, FerdinandÂ VII replaced him inÂ 1816 with his subordinate, Palezuela. â E,Â I,Â 181.\n\nÂ p442Â Antonio deÂ AcuÃ±a yÂ Cabrera (d.Â 1662) had seen military service in Piedmont and Lombardy before coming to Peru, where he enjoyed some prestige through the influence of his relatives rather than through his own merits. Appointed to the presidency of Chile by the viceroy of Peru, he took possession of the office in May,Â 1650, and his appointment was confirmed by the sovereign some two years later. His term of office was then extended to eight years, but he was deposed on FebruaryÂ 20, 1655, as shown in the text. Although he was ordered back to his post by the audiencia in Santiago, the viceroy summoned him to Peru and sent four hundred soldiers to enforce the order. In Lima, through family influence, he escaped the consequences of his folly, but died in that city. â M,Â p11.\n\nFrancisco deÂ Aguirre (ca.Â 1507â1580?) was born in Talavera deÂ laÂ Reina and first saw military service in Italy, being present at the sack of Rome inÂ 1527. Arriving in Peru aboutÂ 1536, he fought against Almagro. He campaigned in Upper Peru with Gonzalo Pizarro and Diego deÂ Rojas, accompanied Valdivia to Chile, filled various municipal offices in Santiago, and, reoccupying the valley of Coquimbo, first settled by Juan BohÃ³n, established there the city of LaÂ Serena. Furthermore, he was designated by Valdivia as lieutenant-governor and in that capacity began to dispute with another Spaniard, Juan NÃºÃ±ez delÂ Prado, for possession of the city of ElÂ Barco, east of the Andes, where he founded Santiago delÂ Estero. While engaged in subduing the neighboring Indians, he learned of the death of Valdivia and recrossed the Andes to assume the government of the province. Recognized as governor in the north, he found himself opposed by Francisco deÂ Villagra, who obtained equal recognition in the south. Ultimately both claimants were taken prisoner and banished to Lima by Hurtado deÂ Mendoza. InÂ 1569 Aguirre became governor of TucumÃ¡n but, owing to charges brought by his enemies before the Inquisition, he retired to LaÂ Serena where he died. â E,Â III,Â 647; M,Â pp18â30.\n\nPedro Aguirre Cerda (1879â1941),​a born in LosÂ Andes, was educated in the local schools and in the Liceo of SanÂ Felipe. InÂ 1897 he entered the Instituto pedagÃ³gico where he prepared himself to teach Spanish, at the same time taking up the study of law in the National University. He received his title as advocate inÂ 1904, when professor of Spanish in the National Institute. InÂ 1910 he went to Europe to study public finance and pedagogy and on his return took an active part in educational and financial reform. He became deputy for his native town of LosÂ Andes, was minister of justice and public instruction inÂ 1918, assisted in organizing Alessandri's campaign for the presidency, served as minister of the interior in three of Alessandri's cabinets and as Â p443Â senator from ConcepciÃ³n, and shared Alessandri's exile. He is justly famed for his eloquence, his mental energy, his skill in political manipulation, and his social outlook. Later as president of the radical party he favored a liberal progressive policy rather than a radical one. AÂ successful lawyer and man of business, proprietor of a considerable estate, and a skillful party leader, he was made president inÂ 1938 by the Popular front. â F,Â I,Â 186â192.\n\nManuel deÂ Alday yÂ Axpe (1712â1788) was born in ConcepciÃ³n. He earlier studies were carried on in his native city at the seminary of SanÂ JosÃ©. He obtained his doctorate in both theology and jurisprudence at the University of SanÂ Marcos in Lima inÂ 1739. Nominated by the king as bishop of Santiago on SeptemberÂ 8, 1753, he took possession of his office on AugustÂ 24, 1755, amid universal expressions of satisfaction. He fulfilled his duties with \"notable moderation, prudence, and virtue.\" He presided over a diocesan synod at Santiago inÂ 1763, twice visited all portions of his province, and issued to the faithful therein notable pastoral letters. His most significant task was the rebuilding of the Cathedral of Santiago, to which he contributed from his private fortune. â M,Â pp43â44; Vicente Carvallo yÂ Goyeneche , DescripciÃ³n histÃ³rico-jeogrÃ¡fica delÂ reino deÂ Chile, in \"ColecciÃ³n deÂ historiadores deÂ Chile,\" Vol.Â IX, chap.Â xcii.\n\nJuan deÂ Dios Aldea (1853â1879) was the son of a schoolmaster residing in ChillÃ¡n. He received some education in the Franciscan school of his native city, entered the marine artillery when still very young, and by his industry and good conduct had become second sergeant at the time of his glorious death. He was buried along with his fellow heroes in Iquique, where their remains were later identified and transferred to Valparaiso. In that city a worthy monument commemorates their valor. â F,Â I,Â 302â304.\n\nJerÃ³nimo deÂ Alderete yÂ Mercado (1518â1556) was a native of Olmedo. He arrived in Peru inÂ 1535 and gained his first experience in fighting the Indians of Upper Peru. Joining Valdivia in northern Chile, he took part in the founding of Santiago and was selected as one of the first regidoresÂ of that city. His survey of the coast to the BiobÃ­o, his campaigns against the Indians and against Gonzalo Pizarro, and his part in the founding of cities led Valdivia to regard him as one of his best officers. He was given a substantial encomienda and was selected by that leader to report conditions in Chile at the Spanish court. Alderete had to journey to England, where PhilipÂ II was then sojourning with his wife, Queen Mary. His report, backed up a substantial supply of Chilean gold, produced a good impression on the Spanish ministers, and, when they learned of Valdivia's death, Alderete was appointed governor Â p444Â of Chile. He was destined never to fill the office, for while on his way back he died at the island of Tobago near Panama â of fever, according to one account; of injuries received from a fire on shipboard, which drove him insane, according to another. â E,Â IV,Â 352; M,Â pp44â49.\n\nArturo Alessandri Palma (1868âÂ ) was born in Linares, educated in the colegio of the French fathers, and obtained his license as advocate inÂ 1893. His law thesis dealt with a social subject. He became prominent among the young men of the liberal party, assisted in the candidacy of the younger ErrÃ¡zuriz, became deputy inÂ 1897, and in the following year was minister of industry and public works. InÂ 1918 he was in charge of the treasury and for a time inÂ 1918 held the ministry of the interior, a position which enabled him to begin his own campaign for the presidency. Early recognized as an incomparable orator, he distinguished himself in the speech he pronounced before the Argentine congress at the centennial celebration ofÂ 1910 and again inÂ 1915 at the inauguration of the railroad from Arica to LaÂ Paz. In addition, during these earlier years, he served as attorney for foreign and domestic corporations and was looked upon as a sort of liberal conservative, although displaying on occasion interest in measures of social welfare.\n\nUrged on by his presidential aspirations, Alessandri, as the election year ofÂ 1920 approached, completely changed his political philosophy. Voi­cing popular discontent at existing economic and social conditions, he inaugurated a whirlwind campaign which at the close resulted in a disputed election. This election was resolved by the appointment of a tribunal of honor which determined that, while frauds were committed on both sides, fewer marked the course of Alessandri's followers, and hence they awarded him the presidency over his competitor, Luis Barros BorgoÃ±o. The events of his troubled administration are detailed in the text. His withdrawal from the presidency, his exile, and his triumphant return inÂ 1925 paved the way for the constitution of that year, a document on which Alessandri exerted great influence. Failing to complete his term in office because of the dispute over his successor, Alessandri remained in the country for a time as a private but influential citizen, as was shown by his speech on the Tacna-Arica question in July,Â 1926. Suffering exile under IbÃ¡Ã±ez, he returned afterÂ 1931 and in the following year was triumphantly reÃ«lected president, an office which he held until the end of his constitutional period inÂ 1938. â F,Â I,Â 350â365.\n\nDiego deÂ Almagro (1475â1538) was supposedly an abandoned infant found in Almagro, a small town near Ciudad Real. He is reported to have passed some time in the Spanish army and then to have fled from Spain because he had killed a man. In Panama he became so intimate with Pizarro that the historian Oviedo characterizes the twain as \"one Â p445Â soul with two bodies.\" If so, it was an unlettered friendship in which Almagro's more trustful nature was no match for the other. He lost an eye in the first attempt of the two against Peru and drew only the position of commandant at TÃºmbez, with a modest salary, in the grant which Pizarro obtained at court. It needed all the tact and persuasion of Fernando deÂ Luque to keep these untutored soul mates from blows. Nor did the presence of Pizarro's half brothers, particularly Hernando, prove agreeable to the overreached Almagro. For the time being they patched up their friendship. Almagro shared in the spoil guilefully won from Atahualpa, although taking no part in the Inca's capture and betrayal, and later helped in persuading Alvarado to desist from his projected conquest of Quito and leave the field to the Pizarros and himself. Almagro's part in the first expedition to Chile and in the bloody strife around Cuzco is described in the text. He left a son, child of an Indian woman of Panama, who avenged his father's death by devising the assassination of Francisco Pizarro. Later, after being defeated at Chupas, the younger Almagro met death at the hands of the hangman who had executed his father. â Manuel deÂ Mendiburu, Diccionario histÃ³rico-biogrÃ¡fico delÂ PerÃº (8Â vols. Lima, 1874â1890), I,Â 102â166; E,Â IV,Â 787.\n\nLuis Altamirano Aracena (1836â1905) was born in SanÂ Felipe, educated in the National Institute, and obtained his degree as advocate inÂ 1860. After acquiring prestige as a lawyer, he entered politics. InÂ 1870 he became minister of justice, worship, and public instruction under PÃ©rez and continued in office under ErrÃ¡zuriz as minister of the interior â aÂ post held by him during the entire administration. He held other cabinet posts during succeeding administrations and was also a deputy or senator from ConcepciÃ³n, serving likewise on the comisiÃ³n conservadora as counselor of state and as intendant of Vaparaiso. During the War of the Pacific, he was special envoy in the conferences at Arica (see p333) and later fought in the battles before Lima. He opposed the administration of Balmaceda and in his later years held subordinate judicial positions. â E,Â IV,Â 953, F,Â I,Â 401â403.\n\nLuis Altamirano Talavera (?â?) had a military career dating from the Civil War ofÂ 1891 upon which he entered as a captain. Afterward he passed through the usual military grades and took part in various commissions to Europe and other American countries and was lieutenant general at the beginning of the revolutionary movement inÂ 1924. Elevated by the discontented militarists to the junta which replaced President Alessandri, he headed that body until the following January when a second military overturn sent him into private life. Altamirano was supposedly becoming too partial to the aristocratic element and unmindful of his duty to the group that had brought him to political Â p446Â distinction. His high character and patriotic action together with his long and honorable service saved him from becoming a sacrifice to the second military revolution. â F,Â I,Â 403â406.\n\nManuel deÂ Amat yÂ Junient (1704â1790) was the second son of the MarquÃ©s deÂ Castebell, member of a family of considerable repute for learning. After lengthy military service in Spain, Italy, and Africa, during which he gained knighthood in the Order of St.Â John and the rank of field marshal, he was appointed governor and captain-general of Chile inÂ 1754. Intelligent and energetic in fulfilling his duties, he affected to believe the appointment below his merits and displayed little sympathy toward those he governed. Nevertheless his career in Chile led to promotion inÂ 1761 to the viceroyalty of Peru. The creation of a police force for Santiago was due to a mutiny among the city prisoners which he in person repressed with severity. â B,Â VI,Â 195â218; M,Â pp73â74.\n\nMiguel Luis AmunÃ¡tegui Aldunate (1828â1888) was born in Santiago and received his first instruction from his parents. The early death of his father forced him to help in the support of the family, while pursuing his course at the National Institute. Entering his alma mater at the age of fourteen, he distinguished himself as a student, tutored others for examinations, and at the age of nineteen, through special dispensation and the influence of his constant mentor, AndrÃ©s Bello, received the chair of humanities in the institute. The salary from this position, supplemented by his income from private classes, enabled him to support his mother and sister and educate his two borders. He was aided in these family tasks by DonÂ Gregorio VÃ­ctor (1830â1898), and this association in early privation and training made the two brothers inseparable companions. DonÂ Miguel Luis entered journalism and public office inÂ 1848 and at the same time joined the liberal party. In addition to their joint historical work, Miguel Luis essayed various biographies and inÂ 1853 presented to the ministry an important memoir upon the right of Chile to the Strait of Magellan, to be followed shortly by LaÂ dictatura deÂ O'Higgins. Thenceforward he continued his active political and administrative career, of which the pages of the present work bear frequent witness. The high spots of his career were his service as minister of the interior inÂ 1868 and as unsuccessful candidate for the presidential nomination inÂ 1875 (see pp313 andÂ 320). InÂ 1857 he published an important memoir on public instruction in Chile and as minister of public instruction under Pinto opened professional instruction in the University of Chile to women. Had he survived, his moderating tendencies might have made him the presidential candidate ofÂ 1891 and thus have prevented the civil strife of that year.\n\nMiguel Luis was the more prominent of the two brothers, but Gregorio Â p447Â VÃ­ctor, modest and retiring, was his silent helper in many activities for which the other derives credit. The latter likewise engaged in newspaper work and afterÂ 1862 published important biographies and studies of the colonial period under his own name. FromÂ 1868 on, he devoted himself to a judicial career, including member­ship in the court of appeals inÂ 1875 and in the supreme court inÂ 1889. At the same time he collaborated with his brother until the latter's death. AÂ statue to the two brothers in Santiago fittingly commemorates their public career. â F,Â I,Â 478â482. For a critical study of the elder AmunÃ¡tegui's work see Cruz, Estudios sobre laÂ literature chilena, I,Â 215â285. See also C.Â Norla VicuÃ±a, DonÂ Luis AmunÃ¡tegui (1828â1888) (Paris, 1889?). Of the volumes mentioned (p353), ElÂ descubrimiento appeared inÂ 1862; and LosÂ precursores, inÂ 1870â1872.\n\nDomingo AmunÃ¡tegui Solar (1860âÂ ), born in Santiago, was the son of DonÂ Miguel Luis AmunÃ¡tegui. He was educated in the National Institute and the National University and became an advocate inÂ 1881. InÂ 1887 he became subsecretary of justice and inÂ 1889, professor of constitutional law in the Pedagogical Institute, professor of history in the National Institute, and dean of the faculty of humanities. He has served in several ministries from 1907 to date, was twice rector of the university, and has been honored by member­ship in learned societies at home and abroad. In addition to numerous articles of a political and educational character, he has contributed important studies upon the literary, political, and social conditions of Chile, especially during the colonial epoch. His Historia deÂ Chile, a school text, appeared inÂ 1933. â F,Â I,Â 490â491.\n\nGeorge Anson (1697â1762) entered the British navy inÂ 1712. From June to November inÂ 1741 he was on the coast of South America. InÂ 1739 Anson was appointed commodore of a fleet to sail to the Pacific. Setting out on SeptemberÂ 18, 1740 in six ill-fitted and ill-manned vessels, the expedition rounded Cape Horn. In spite of the loss of three of these ships, they captured the Philippine galleon. He returned in the Centurion by way of the Cape of Good Hope on JuneÂ 15, 1744, bringing a treasure worth Â£500,000. He was then appointed a member of the admiralty and was influential in securing the passage of several naval construction bills in parliament. He became an admiral two years prior to his death. â Dictionary of National Biography (London, 1885âÂ ), II,Â 31â36. For an account of his expedition see the work written by his companion, Richard Walter, AÂ Voyage Round the World (London, 1748). The latest biography was written by M.Â V.Â Anson, Life of Admiral Anson (London, 1912).\n\nJosÃ© Gregorio Argomedo Montero (1767â1830) was born in SanÂ Â p448Â Fernando. During the colonial period, he occupied minor municipal posts, and after the deposition of GarcÃ­a Carrasco became secretary of the general government, minister of the court of appeals, councilor of state, member of congress, vice-president and president of the supreme court, and rector of the University of SanÂ Felipe. After joining the revolution ofÂ 1810, he proposed the calling of a general American congress in which all nations of the new world were to have representation. He edited the most important documents of the revolution. â F,Â I,Â 573â576.\n\nVirginio Ãrias Cruz (1855âÂ ) was born in Ranquil, near ConcepciÃ³n. Son of a modest farmer, who died when Virginio was eight years old, the future sculptor owed much of his inspiration to his mother and his early training to practical work in ornamenting and repairing churches. He later joined a class in sculpture at the University of Chile and accompanied his instructor, Nicanor Plaza, to Paris. InÂ 1875 he was admitted to the salon of that city and to the School of Fine Arts. InÂ 1882 he gained recognition with his statue \"ElÂ roto chileno,\" and thereafter frequently received honorable mention or medals at Paris, at Buffalo, and in Chile. InÂ 1900 he became director of the Escuela deÂ bellas artes in Santiago, and during his term as director reorganized its curriculum. His list of works includes statues of the leading public men of Chile, some of whose figures ornament the plazas of Santiago, the Palace of Fine Arts, and the National Library. The monument to Baquedano is a notable example of his recent work. â F,Â I,Â 578â581.\n\nJusto Arteaga Alemparte (1834â1882) and Domingo Arteaga Alemparte (1835â1880) were both born in ConcepciÃ³n, the sons of Justo Arteaga Cuevas, a notable Chilean general â F,Â I,Â 626â628. He pursued studies in the National Institute, where they came under the influence of the notable journalist, Manuel Blanco CuartÃ­n, who was also their French teacher. Both derived from this early training many characteristics of style, which later appear in their writings â exact and striking phrasing, good taste, robust expression. They inherited the fighting instinct but they fought with the pen and not the sword and they fought fairly and with grace. Their daily contributions to the press form meritorious literary products and at the same time afford charming sketches of noteworthy contemporaries. â F,Â I,Â 623â625.\n\nJusto Arteaga early entered journalism in a goodly company, speedily proving its most conspicuous exemplar. Prone to ally himself with the opposition, he accomplished more for liberal ideas by his sketches and editorials than did thousands of speeches uttered in congress yet he \"never soiled his gloves, when he grasped the axe. He alone knew how to wound with courtesy.\" His brother was more of the poet Â p449Â than was Justo, but on occasion could himself wield a facile editorial pen. Often the two worked together and the careful critic frequently finds himself at a loss to determine the part of each in their joint productions.\n\nThe early works of Justo appeared in ElÂ PaÃ­s, LaÂ actualidad, and LaÂ discusiÃ³n. Later during two considerable periods he wrote for ElÂ ferrocarril and still later for LosÂ tiempos. His brother spent the years fromÂ 1851 toÂ 1857 in exile with their father, learned through necessity something of business, wrote his early poems, and on his return to Chile joined his brother in publishing a short-lived but provocative paper, LaÂ semana. Domingo, for some years afterÂ 1860, headed a section of the foreign office. The two were also associated afterÂ 1866 in bringing out LaÂ libertad, a paper which just suited their genius. At the same time they published numerous political pamphlets and likewise held seats in congress. InÂ 1870 appeared their most significant joint product, LosÂ constituyentes chilenos deÂ 1870. The edition edited by Robert Huneeus (Santiago, 1910) proved extremely useful for the notes of the present volume. Both died prematurely but left behind a flattering legacy of prose and poesy for the enrichment of Chilean literature. See the introductory sketch by Robert Huneeus in LosÂ constituyentes chilenos deÂ 1870, pp.Â viiâlxii. See also F,Â I,Â 623â625.\n\nAtahualpa (d.Â 1533), the fourteenth and last of the Inca rulers of Peru, was the illegitimate son of Huaina Capac, greatest of the Inca line. His father divided his conquests, leaving the southern portion to Huascar and the northern portion with headquarters at Quito to Atahualpa. Dissatisfied with this division, the latter had fought with and captured and imprisoned his half brother shortly before Pizarro landed to begin his conquest. The usual story that Atahualpa was betrayed and captured at the famous parley near Cajamarca, through the device of proffering a copy of the Bible for his consideration, is matched by another to the effect that Pizarro, foreseeing an attempt on the part of the Inca to entrap him, simply arranged a more successful trap for the unlucky Atahualpa. This pretext for the captive ruler's death is simply in keeping with the bloody and treacherous tale of this conquest. â Mendiburu, op.Â cit., I,Â 370â404; E,Â VI,Â 840â842.\n\nThayer's Note:"
