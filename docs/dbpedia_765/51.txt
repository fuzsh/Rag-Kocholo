Unit Description

Knights of Santiago are available only to the Spanish and Aragonese, and they cannot be recruited, they may appear when a Crusade is launched. Statistically, they are the same as Chivalric Knights.

Knights of Santiago tactics are the same as most Knight units: flank the enemy, charge them in the rear, repeat as necessary. Avoid frontal charges into spear and pike units, avoid polearm units unless an instant rout is assured, and avoid camels. Like most order Knights, they are not Impetuous like Chivalric Knights, so they will be a little easier to keep out of trouble. While they carry the cavalry shield, they only get half value for it's protection.

Knights of Santiago trained in Leon gain a +1 bonus to valour. (Does this mean crusades started in Leon?)

In any battle, Knights of Santiago may be dismounted for Chivalric Foot Knights.
