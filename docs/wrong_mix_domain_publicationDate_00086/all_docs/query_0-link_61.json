        "text": "Here’s a list of great books one is apparently supposed to have read. Sadly, great non-fiction works are omitted. Here’s how I add up:\n\nBook – Author (Reason)\n\nRead:\n\nChoke – Chuck Palahniuk (last year, I think)\n\nLife of Pi – Yann Martel (borrowed from Dad two years ago)\n\nCryptonomicon – Neal Stephenson (read two years ago, must read again)\n\nThe Long Dark Teatime of the Soul – Douglas Adams\n\nDirk Gently’s Holistic Detective Agency – Douglas Adams\n\nThe Name of the Rose – Umberto Eco (read after an undergrad class in Semiotics. Great.)\n\nThe Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy – Douglas Adams (all Douglas Adams is excellent. I have read each of three multiple times)\n\nWatchmen – Alan Moore & David Gibbons (A graphic novel. Excellent.)\n\nBreakfast of Champions – Kurt Vonnegut, Jr. (Finished recently. I tried reading when I was 11, but I was too young and gave up.)\n\nSlaughterhouse-five – Kurt Vonnegut, Jr. (in Southeast Asia last summer)\n\nDo Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? – Philip K. Dick (read in an anthology a few years ago)\n\nStranger in a Strange Land – Robert Heinlein (read a few years ago)\n\nCatch-22 – Joseph Heller (my favourite novel. ever.)\n\nTo Kill a Mockingbird – Harper Lee (for high school english)\n\nThe Lord of the Rings – J.R.R. Tolkien (Long, but imaginative. My opinion is mixed on whether books should have multiple appendices.)\n\nLord of the Flies – William Golding (for high school english)\n\nThe Catcher in the Rye – J.D. Salinger (during high school, outside class)\n\nA Modest Proposal – Jonathan Swift (not sure why this is on the list, as its an essay. But I have read it)\n\nRobinson Crusoe – Daniel Defoe (during high school, outside class)\n\nNineteen Eighty-Four – George Orwell (during high school, outside class)\n\nAnimal Farm – George Orwell (during high school, outside class)\n\nThe Hobbit – J.R.R. Tolkien (I think when I was younger than 12)\n\nBrave New World – Aldous Huxley (during high school, outside class)\n\nThe Great Gatsby – F. Scott Fitzgerald (for high school english)\n\nHeart of Darkness – Joseph Conrad Defoe (during high school, outside class)\n\nThe Time Machine – H.G. Wells (when I was much younger)\n\nThe Adventures of Huckleberry Finn – Mark Twain (in Southeast Asia last summer)\n\nLittle Women – Louisa May Alcott (Mom gave it to me?)\n\nGreat Expectations – Charles Dickens (for high school english)\n\n29!\n\nIn Progress:\n\nUlysses – James Joyce\n\nSaw as a movie:\n\nAtonement – Ian McEwan (recent)\n\nTrainspotting – Irvine Welsh (twice)\n\nAmerican Psycho – Bret Easton Ellis (on David’s recommendation)\n\nThe Cider House Rules – John Irving (few years ago)\n\nSchindler’s Ark – Thomas Keneally (motivation for Schindler’s List, which I saw on Sunday.)\n\nFear and Loathing in Las Vegas – Hunter S. Thompson\n\nThe Godfather – Mario Puzo\n\n2001: A Space Odyssey – Arthur C. Clarke (I actually really don’t like this film. It does nothing new for me and is horribly paced.)\n\nDo Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? – Philip K. Dick (Bladerunner)\n\nFlew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest – Ken Kesey\n\nA Clockwork Orange – Anthony Burgess\n\nDoctor Zhivago – Boris Pasternak (Mom’s favourite movie)\n\nGone With the Wind – Margaret Mitchell (This was playing a few times around the Freeman household in my youth)\n\nHeart of Darkness – Joseph Conrad (As the excellent adaptation Apocalypse Now)\n\nBen-Hur – Lew Wallace (Dad’s favourite movie)\n\nThe Hunchback of Notre Dame – Victor Hugo (yay Disney!)\n\nGave up:\n\nFoucault’s Pendulum – Umberto Eco (A book profoundly stupid in detail. I realized I wasn’t gaining by reading it)\n\nWant to read:\n\nFear and Loathing in Las Vegas – Hunter S. Thompson\n\nThe Unbearable Lightness of Being – Milan Kundera\n\nNeuromancer – William Gibson\n\nTrainspotting – Irvine Welsh\n\nNaked Lunch – William Burroughs\n\nThe Island of Dr. Moreau – H.G.
