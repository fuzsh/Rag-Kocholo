        "text": "Estimated Reading Time: 9 minutes\n\nBack sometime in 2018, I wrote about how I find the books that I read and what my selection process is like. I meant to follow it up shortly with another post about how I choose which books to add to my collection because as much as I try not to be materialistic, books are definitely my kryptonite. Obviously, as a nerd, books hold a special place and I waiver in my belief that it's somehow different from holding dear to shoes, clothes, cooking devices, sports memorabilia, etc. But I wanted to do more than just that, but explain how I conceive of, organize, and interact with my bookshelves.\n\nWhile a part of me would love to have a library of every book I've ever read (Goodreads says that would be in the vicinity of 4,250+ books, but I know that list is missing at least 100-200), I also live in a finite space and with a partner who would prefer not to trade in furniture for bookshelves. A few years ago, I worked to find an acceptable limit that would capture the gist of my reading but also not overwhelm our living space. About a decade ago, I bought 2 large 4-foot wide/8 foot tall reinforced bookshelves from The Mill Store (they have amazing deals!). These were beautiful and perfect for my books--no sagging shelves, ample room for all the books. So somewhere along the way, that I decided that this would be the definitive maximum space my read-books would take up. I should also note that I have one other large bookshelf but that is of work-related books and I keep that at work.\n\nGiven the limited space (for a book nerd, mind you), I've developed two rules about what books make it onto the bookshelf.\n\nThe first rule is that I must have read it entirely (audiobooks count here, of course). I can't add it until it's done. This means it took me over a decade to get Foucault's History of Sexuality Volume 1 from TBR shelf (more on that below) to my actual bookshelf. 10+ years!!! But that's the rule, until I finish it, it's not allowed to be there; in fact, I'm not allowed to even buy it (with one loophole--again, more on that later).\n\nHowever, once I have read it, it doesn't transfer to the bookshelf instantaneously. It has to pass the litmus test for ownership and then the price test for purchasing.\n\nPart of the Nonfiction Section\n\nThe Litmus Test for Book Ownership\n\nThe second rule for books that end up on my bookshelf is that they have to fit into one of three categories: life-changing, academically-related, deep nostalgic connection.\n\nLife-changing books are, of course, books that have profoundly changed me or challenged me at my core and made me rethinking so much of what I know about the world and my place in it. Books that fall into this category include (note, these are just 10 that I grabbed from a quick scan of the nonfiction, not a comprehensive or ranked list).\n\nThe New Jim Crow by Michele Alexander\n\nA More Beautiful Question by Warren Berger\n\nGender Outlaw by Kate Bornstein\n\nFreaks Talk Back by Joshua Gamson\n\nThe Culture of Fear by Barry Glasner\n\nEverything Bad For You Is Good by Steven Johnson\n\nShock Doctrine by Naomi Klein\n\nLies My Teacher Told Me by James Loewen\n\nThe Erotic Mind by Jack Morin\n\nInventing Reality by Michael Parenti\n\nBooks that are related to my work as an instructional designer, teacher, writer, or scholar obviously need to be held onto so as to call upon as needed. Many of the books for instructional design are at work but others can also be found on my bookshelves at home. These include the following:\n\nThe Copyright Wars by Peter Baldwin\n\nThe Power of Comics by Randy Duncan and Matthew Smith\n\nHow to Read Literature Like a Professor by Thomas Foster\n\nPopular Culture: An introduction by Carla Freccero\n\nThe Literature Review: 6 Steps to Success by Lawrence Machi and Brenda McEvoy\n\nThen, of course, there are the books that make it onto deep nostalgic connection. Some of these are actually mentioned above and were the topic of a piece I wrote on this blog back in 2012 (yeah--this blog has been around for 8 years; in Internet years, that means it's old enough to tell you to get of its lawn!)\n\nHitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy by Douglas Adams\n\nThe Foundation series by Isaac Asimov\n\nThe Fall of Freddie the Leaf by Leo Buscaglia (This children's book was a main feature in my father's eulogy)\n\nEnder's Game by Oscon Scott Card\n\nThe Wayfarer Redemption series by Sara Douglass\n\nThe Count of Monte Cristo by Alexander Dumas\n\nThe Odyssey by Homer\n\nIt by Stephen King\n\nThe Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde\n\nCaliban's Hour by Tad Williams\n\nNow, these are not absolutely categories; many of the ones above mentioned could have strong overlaps in a Venn diagram (particularly the fiction with the teaching and the writing careers), but those constructs help me to determine which ones end up in on the shelves.\n\nPart of the Fiction Section\n\nBut Where Do The Books Go On Your Shelf?\n\nOnce I have them, the inevitable question is how to organize them. I've known some to be creative, doing date of publication, binder color, order of acquisition, alphabetical by title, alphabetical by author's last name, size of the book, length of the book and so on. I'm sure there are several coffee books out there on the ways with which you could organize books for the home.\n\nI go in a semi-traditional direction of alphabetical by author's last name. However, before doing that, I have broken my books into three different sections: fiction, graphic novels, and nonfiction. Some of this makes sense in what I'm often looking at the books for but also for a more functional reason. If this is the space I have dedicated to books, then I need to make the most efficient space of it. Therefore, having books of similar size (e.g. mass market paperbacks) together means I can get the most out of given spaces since most of the books are of similar size (e.g. 90% of graphic novels--completely made up number--are of 2 sizes: traditional comic book size and the smaller manga size, so it's easier to organize them effectively).\n\nStacking varies. Right now, while I still have room, my nonfiction section is placed akin to how one might see it in a library, spines perpendicular to the shelf. However, my graphic novels and some of my fiction section is horizontally stacked to keep it limited to three shelves in total.\n\nSide-note about bookshelves: How is it in 2020, we haven't figured out a better way to display books in bookstores than horizontal shelving with books vertically aligned? Seriously, this is the WORSE way by which to peruse books. People wanna blame ebooks, millennials, or Amazon for the demise of bookshops. I blame user-design of bookshelves.\n\nPart of the Graphic Novel Section\n\nMaintaining the Balance\n\nThe hardest part of maintaining these bookshelves is the pruning that must take place. Every six months or so, I take a look through my shelves. I do two run-throughs. The first is to see if any specific books I can easily or unemotionally yank from the shelves. There can be numerous reasons for this and this pass usually gets at least 2-5 books. The second run-through is a bit more deliberate and calls for me to wrestle with my own mind. I try to take a bit more time during this run through and determine if I really want this book in connection with the three reasons up above or if I am keeping it just to keep it (and of course, underneath that \"just to keep it\" are all sorts of psychological questions about why; that may be an idea for another post). This process is hard but inevitably useful. The discarded books will inevitably be donated to the library or some other book-related cause.\n\nDr. Doom's just trying to hold back all the (Sara Douglass) books!\n\nWhat About My TBR Pile\n\nAvid readers all have a To-Be-Read (TBR) pile. What is a TBR pile? It is a \"to be read\" pile of books that we are planning to read next. For years, my TBR pile grew by leaps and bounds, eventually taking up large plastic bins. Eventually, I realized I was never going to get to them. Over the years, I have shrunk that to a singular (non-bookshelf) shelf and have slowly chipped away at it, either removing books or actually reading them.\n\nHowever, I stopped collecting books that I haven't read yet with rare exceptions. Instead, if there are books that I'm interested in reading, I add them to specified Wishlists on Amazon (broken up by different interests--fiction, nonfiction, graphic novels, work-related, and PhD-related lists) so that they are always there but not taking up physical space. When I'm ready to read a specific book, my first go-to is the library to try to read it before deciding to own it.\n\nThe one exception to this bringing in of books into the house is when I travel. On trips, I often make it a habit to visit a local bookstore (preferably used bookstore) and purchase a book that grabs my fancy. Sometimes, it's a book I know about and have been meaning to read, but more often, it's something I was previously unaware of and just happened to grab me in the moment). For instance, recently while wandering a flea market, I couldn't resist \"That Was Then, This Is Now\" by S. E. Hinton, which will join my small pile of books by my bed that I read before bed.\n\nSo those are the \"rules\" or the ways in which I negotiate my bookshelf and keep my house from becoming a supreme fire hazard.\n\nWhat are you rules or ways of keeping books?\n\nDid you enjoy this read?
