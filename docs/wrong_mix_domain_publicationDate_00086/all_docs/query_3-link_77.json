        "text": "One of the fun things about reading a collaboration between two authors you enjoy is playing the “who wrote what” game. For instance, in Good Omens, there are parts that are so self-evidently Gaiman, or so clearly Pratchett, that reading the book involves the fun of watching how their sensibilities combine to make something more than the sum of their parts. More unusual is the case of The Talisman, the first (of two) collaborations between Stephen King and Peter Straub, in which the two authors’ styles come together in something far more blended and inseparable than the clear distinctions of Good Omens. Oh, there are parts of The Talisman that are more King-ish, or more Straub-esque…but even in those stretches, it’s hard not to feel the way the other bleeds into it, making a book wholly like and wholly unlike either of their other books.\n\nIn its broadest terms, The Talisman is about a boy named Jack who has to go on a journey to save his mother. That journey finds Jack traveling across both our world and an alternate world called The Territories, one that corresponds to ours in unsettling ways, even as it’s also a world of magic and fantasy. But those broad terms honestly don’t quite convey the oddness and ambition of The Talisman, which stops its narrative cold for a stretch in a fundamentalist boys home, weaves its worlds together in a kaleidoscopic array, unveils family secrets and drama casually, and generally gives you a scope more akin to something epic than the more intimate tales that both authors generally favor – even as it stays true to both of their strengths: the imagination of both, the strong dialogue, characterization of children, and intense horror and pacing of King; the poetic sensibility, the restrained unease and suspense, and the strong sense of magical unreality of Straub. Indeed, there are setpieces here as good as any that either has ever written, from a jaw-dropping final stretch that weaves in and out of two worlds to a long-deserved explosion of revenge that’s both horrific and satisfying.\n\nThat’s not to say that The Talisman isn’t bumpy. It takes far too long to get going (playing off of both author’s worst tendencies and exacerbating them), and there are definitely some tropes here that I’m just as glad to leave in the past (particularly the Magical Negro, although the Kindhearted Simpleton rears its head too), even if they’re executed with some nuance and depth thanks to both men’s craft. The book sprawls, and while that’s somewhat of an asset (in how it builds the world and shows off wonders), it can definitely feel a bit overlong at times, with some changes in direction that often feel a little more “and then this happens” rather than always flowing quite as organically as we might like.\n\nBut when a book gives you characters like Wolf, or the way it plays with the concept of Twinners (people who echo across both worlds), or the blurry lines of reality, or some of the horror visions here, it’s hard to complain too much. The Talisman is big and bulky and maybe a bit overstuffed and in need of tightening, but it’s also a great adventure story with rich characters and imagination to spare – and an interesting anomaly in the careers of both of its authors. Rating: ****\n\nFor me, Robert Louis Stevenson’s The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde has always been inextricably mentally linked with two other iconic and essential works of horror: Dracula and Frankenstein. There are a lot of reasons for this (not least a horror fiction class I took in college), but in the end, every time I read one, I end up thinking of it in comparison to the others. Frankenstein is always the most surprising to people, the one that defies easy expectations; it’s also the one that drags the most, bogged down in Romanticism and mopey whining at times, but that can’t undo the fundamental excitement and complexity of the tale. Dracula is the potboiler; it’s a bit too long, but it just moves like a rocket, delivering a more action-packed story than you might expect, along with a few sequences for the ages (and a lot of barely repressed sexual anxiety). And then there’s Jekyll and Hyde, the leanest of the three (not even 70 pages), but maybe the darkest of any of them, with the least hopeful ideas, sensibility, and outcome of the trio – and that’s saying something indeed.\n\nMind you, reading Jekyll and Hyde in the modern era is a very different experience, mainly because the central conflict is so utterly familiar to us, even if you’ve never read the book…which pulls some of the book’s impact, since it waits to reveal the nature of their relationship until the very end. And yet, somehow, that doesn’t really diminish the book, nor does it prepare you for how surprisingly grim it is; when the very first incident of note involves Hyde nearly stomping a child to death, it’s no surprise to find that Stevenson reportedly was so horrified by what he wrote that he burned the manuscript before writing it a second time (reportedly as more of a morality tale and less of a pure “shocker”).\n\nAnd sure, that moral point leans a little heavily over the book, but it never detracts from the central appeal of the novel – that pull towards our darkest impulses, and how easy it becomes to give into them again and again. As Stephen King points out in the forward to the edition I read, Jekyll can’t help but resonate as a work of the same time period that gave us Jack the Ripper – indeed, if Dracula is the prim and proper face the society showed to the world, Jekyll is that facade pulled away and exposed as the thin cover that it is. Sure, Jekyll and Hyde works because it’s got a great hook, but in the end, what sticks with us is that slow realization by Jekyll that he’s maybe not so much turning into Hyde as Hyde is sometimes turning back into him…and the implications of that are what make the book such a classic.
