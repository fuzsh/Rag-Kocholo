        "text": "The Sunday Post is a weekly meme hosted by\n\nKimberly @ Caffeinated Book Reviewer.\n\nIt’s a chance to share news.\n\nA post to recap the past week on your blog,\n\nshowcase books and things we have received.\n\nShare news about what is coming up\n\non your blog for the week ahead.\n\nSee rules here: Sunday Post Meme\n\n***\n\nThis post also counts for\n\n#SundayPost #SundaySalon\n\n#itsmonday\n\n#WWWWednesday #WWWWednesdays\n\nClick on the logos to join the memes\n\nThis past week has been milder in Chicagoland, and I managed to go out and walk everyday (except one day when it was impossible to fit it walking with six hours of teaching).\n\nI have also restarted being more serious at Japanese learning.\n\nAND I have been enjoying writing longer reviews (3 in one week! I can’t even recognize myself) – let’s enjoy it as long as it lasts, lol!\n\nIt must be Spring in the air – though more ice and snow on the horizon.\n\nHere is what I posted this past week:\n\nMonday: Spell the month in books – February 2024\n\nTuesday: Top Ten Books under 150 pages\n\nWednesday: Book review: A Summer with Rimbaud\n\nThursday: Throwback Thursday: October 2013\n\nFriday: Book review: The Informer\n\nSaturday: Book review: A Death in Tokyo\n\nNext week, I hope to review a couple more reviews, and possibly post for Top Ten Tuesday.\n\nI finished four books (two were short stories) since last post. Three of these were audiobooks.\n\nJUST READ / LISTENED TO 🎧\n\n📚 Becoming uncreated: The journey to human authenticity : updating the spiritual christology of Gregory Palamas,\n\nby Daniel M. Rogich Nonfiction / Orthodoxy\n\n1997\n\n233 pages\n\nGregory Palamas (c. 1296-1359) is my favorite Orthodox father.\n\nSo it was good reading this book that’s trying to show how relevant Gregory’s teaching is still today.\n\nIn the last part, the author even shows Palamite spirituality relevancy compared to quantum physics. I will do a short review on my Orthodox blog.\n\n🎧 The Pearl of Price\n\n(Parker Pyne series),\n\nby Agatha Christie\n\nMystery / Short story\n\n1933\n\n100 pages (?) / 27 minutes\n\nThis book counts for the\n\nAgatha Christie Short Stories Challenge\n\nand for the Classics Club (4th list)\n\nA rich girl loses one of her pearl earrings while visiting Petra, Jordan.\n\nIt was ok, I liked the setting.\n\nThe girl got on my nerves and I easily guessed what had happened, though I couldn’t figure out why.\n\nOnce again, the redeeming factor was Hugh Fraser’s excellent audio narration.\n\n🎧 The Affair at the Bungalow\n\n(Miss Marple series),\n\nby Agatha Christie\n\nMystery / Short story\n\n1930\n\n21 pages / 39 minutes\n\nThis book counts for the\n\nAgatha Christie Short Stories Challenge\n\nand for the Classics Club (4th list)\n\nThis one was much better for its content.\n\n“A beautiful actress recounts a mysterious tale about a strange meeting in a bungalow somewhere out of London with a playwriter who was hoping to have his new play performed. She mentions a later jewel robbery at the bungalow too. Something in the story doesn’t ring true for Miss Marple. Did you catch it?”\n\nNo I didn’t! The story had some great twists. Really nice feat for such a short story. We don’t hear much from Miss Marple, but she’s here, very attentively listening to the story, and the important thing is what she says to the actress ear near the end of the story – and that the reader doesn’t even hear!\n\nThis time, I found the audio terrible. I couldn’t stand the female narrator Juliet Stevenson. You don’t need to have a high pitch voice to convey how stupid someone is… I would definitely NOT listen to a full book with her narration.\n\n🎧 A Death in Tokyo,\n\n(Kyoichiro Kaga Series #3 in English),by Keigo Higashino\n\nMystery / Thriller\n\nNarrated by P. J. Ochlan\n\n麒麟の翼 was published in 2011\n\nThe English translation by Giles Murray on December 13, 2022\n\nby Minotaur Books\n\n368 pages / 9H36\n\nAudiobook by Tantor Media\n\nEcopy received for review through NetGalley\n\nThis book counts forthe Japanese Literature Challenge 17\n\nMY VERDICT: Dead body, Tokyo landmark, thrilling puzzle: dive into a captivating mystery packed with cultural insights and unexpected twists, where the author cleverly leads you astray.\n\nClick on the cover to access my full review\n\nCURRENTLY READING / LISTENING TO\n\nHighlighting here only a few:\n\n📚 After the Banquet,\n\nby Yukio Mishima\n\nJapanese literary fiction\n\n宴のあと was first published in 1960\n\n271 pages\n\nReading for the\n\nJapanese Literature Challenge 17\n\nIt counts for the Classics Club (4th list)\n\nI enjoy very much Mishima’s novels. The last one I read was Beautiful Star.\n\nThis one is more in the style of The Sound of Waves. I really love how he portrays the people and their evolution.\n\n“For years Kazu has run her fashionable restaurant with a combination of charm and shrewdness. But when the middle-aged entrepreneur falls in love with one of her clients, an aristocratic retired politician, she renounces her business in order to become his wife. In time, however, Kazu decides to resurrect her husband’s political career. She embarks on a series of compromises and evasions that will force her to choose between her marriage and the demands of her irrepressible vitality.”\n\n📚Travels with a Writing Brush:\n\nClassical Japanese Travel Writing from the Manyoshu to Basho,\n\nby Meredith McKinney (editor), Translated from the Japanese\n\nPoetry / Travel / Japanese classic literature\n\n2019\n\n400 pages\n\nReading for the\n\nJapanese Literature Challenge 17\n\nIt counts for the Classics Club (4th list)\n\nAlas, just a few more days to go!\n\n“A rich, exquisite and original anthology that illuminates Japanese travel writing over a thousand years.\n\n‘Oh journey upon journey, my life is a brief moment, and I cannot hope that we will meet again’.\n\nRoaming over mountains and along perilous shores, this anthology illuminates over a thousand years of Japanese travel writing. It takes in songs, diaries, tales and poetry, and ranges from famous works including The Pillow Book and the works of Basho to pieces such as the diary of a young girl who longs to return to the capital and her beloved books, or the writings of travelling monks who sleep on pillows of grass. Together they illuminate a long literary tradition, with intense poetic experience at its heart.”\n\n📚 Mon Cœur a déménagé\n\nby Michel Bussi French mystery\n\nPublished January 11, 2024\n\n380 pages\n\nNot yet available in English.\n\nReading with my French student F.\n\nI am a big fan of Michel Bussi’s books, whether they be mysteries, scifi, or YA.\n\nThis is getting better and better!\n\nTranslation of the French synopsis:\n\n“The death of a mother The quest of a daughter An implacable revenge.\n\n“Dad killed Mom.” Rouen, April 1983.\n\nOphélie saw it all, almost, from the age of seven. But her father was not the only one responsible. Another man could have saved her mother.\n\nFrom that moment on, Ophélie had only one goal: to find the witnesses, to piece together the puzzle that would lead her to the truth. And, patiently, to carry out her revenge…\n\nPlaced in a foster home as a child, a rebellious student in high school, and an undergraduate student living under a false identity, every stage of Ophélie’s life will be marked by her obsessive and heartbreaking quest.\n\nIn a plot that blends romance, friendship, coming-of-age, and manipulation, Michel Bussi also paints an unprecedented social fresco of the 1990s.\n\nMon Cœur a déménagé [My Heart Has Moved out] is as the same time a coming-of-age story, a love story and a friendship story, a vast investigation spanning over a decade, and, of course, a twist-filled plot, where no one knows, until the last page, who knows the truth, and who is manipulating it.\n\n🎧 Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,\n\nby Robert Louis Stevenson Narrated by Alexander Spencer\n\nGothic/Horror? novella\n\n1886\n\n139 pages / 3H6\n\nIt counts for The Classics Club\n\nReading for BookBound2024\n\nThe last book I read in my BoookBound thread was about the French poet Rimbaud. The author highlighted the possible presence of double personality in Rimbaud, and he made reference to Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. And I have never read it, so the time had come!\n\nThe last time I read something by Stevenson was Travels with a Donkey in the Cévennes, so this is VERY different!!\n\nI’m actually quite impressed by the variety of genre this author has.\n\nI’m sure you all have seen the movie or movies. I haven’t, and I only vaguely knew what this was about. So this is a lot of fun!\n\nPerfectly gothic. And the narrator is very good.\n\nBOOK UP NEXT 🎧\n\n🎧 The Restaurant at the End of the Universe (The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy #2),\n\nby Douglas Adams\n\nScience-Fiction\n\n1980\n\n250 pages / 5H47\n\nNarrated by Martin Freeman\n\nI planned to listen to this one in January, but then, offers that I could not refuse presented themselves. Now is the time.\n\nI can’t wait to meet again my favorite robot Marvin.\n\n“Facing annihilation at the hands of the warlike Vogons is a curious time to have a cosmically displaced Arthur Dent and his curious comrades in arms as they hurtle through space powered by pure improbability – and desperately in search of a place to eat. Among Arthur’s motley shipmates are Ford Prefect, a long-time friend and contributor to the The Hitch Hiker’s Guide to the Galaxy; Zaphod Beeblebrox, the three-armed, two-headed ex-president of the galaxy; Tricia McMilan, a fellow Earth refuge who’s gone native (her name is Trillian now); and Marvin, who suffers nothing and no one gladly.”\n\nTHE LINK OF THE WEEK\n\nAI reads ancient scroll buried by Vesuvius eruption\n\nGreat example of using AI as the tool it is,\n\nfor the good, for culture, and education\n\n🎧 THE MUSIC OF THE WEEK 🎧\n\nOne of my French students just went to the Mozart Festival in Salzburg.\n\nSo I asked her what her favorite Mozart piece was.\n\nThis one. The famous Adagio part (starts here at 18:31) is well known\n\nand for sure gorgeous.\n\nSerenade No. 10 (K 361) ‘Gran Partita’\n\nLAST BOOK ADDED TO MY GOODREADS TBR\n\nSweet Harmony,\n\nby Claire North\n\nScience-fiction novella\n\n2020\n\n124 pages\n\n“From the bestselling and award-winning author of The First Fifteen Lives of Harry August and 84K, a darkly inventive novella about the dangers of pursuing perfection.\n\nHarmony is tired. Tired of working so hard, tired of the way she looks, tired of being average.\n\nBut all that changes when she decides to splash out and upgrade her nanos. And why not? Everyone’s doing it now. With a simple in-app purchase, you can update the tech in your bloodstream to transform yourself – get enhanced brain power, the perfect body or a dazzling smile. Suddenly, everything starts going right for her. She’s finally becoming the person she always wanted to be.\n\nBut as Harmony will find out, there’s a limit to how many upgrades a body can take . . .”"
