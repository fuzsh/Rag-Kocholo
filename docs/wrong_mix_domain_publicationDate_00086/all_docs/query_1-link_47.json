        "text": "My idea of a 1931 movie is something like Dracula or one of those early Garbo talkies - static camera, awkward dialogue, millions of rats, etc. - but this has the visual acrobatics of a silent movie, opening on an extended POV shot for no particular reason and very rarely letting up from there. It matches nicely with Jekyll's rationale for his experiments, that he performs them because he can, paying no heed to conservative reservations about how these things just aren't done. It's safe to say that the filmmakers don't take their ostensible moral, about how there are things one just doesn't do, seriously.\n\nI think I first saw this around the same time Ang Lee's Hulk came out,…\n\nOne of cinema's best early-era horror films, Rouben Mamoulian's \"Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde\" is a muscular, superbly acted, and handsomely crafted film. As strong superficially as it is internally, the horror outing combines visual atmosphere and thematic undercurrents to form an excellent genre entry.\n\nBased on Robert Louis Stevenson's novel, \"Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde\" focuses on the chaos caused when the good Dr. Jekyll develops a potion, turning him into the ferocious Mr. Hyde. Torn into two separate beings, Jekyll as Hyde explores violence and desire before falling victim to his more base self.\n\nThe story has always provided an observation of the competing natures that dwell within the human mind and body. Here, that competition is between…\n\nDr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde feels like it's at once a condemnation of the unfair and unreasonable expectations polite society places upon those who wish to stay within its ranks, and also a warning about what might happen in the absence of those expectations. Society is to blame for the birth of Mr. Hyde, but the horrors wrought by Hyde upon Ivy all spring from the depths of Dr. Jekyll's soul, not society's rigor. It's difficult to accept both ideas at once, as the film ultimately seems to be telling us that society is a cruel master but a wise one, forcing men to keep monsters like Hyde hidden away, not out of the fear of sinning, but out of…\n\n\"I've played with dangerous knowledge; I've walked a strange and terrible road. Help me to find my way back!\"\n\nNo study of pre-Code cinema would be complete without an appraisal of Paramount's 1931 version of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, for many people still the gold standard (as TCM host Dave Karger calls it) in adapting Robert Louis Stevenson's classic novel. The film is not only a superior example of horror from the same year as Frankenstein - similarly showcasing transformational makeup for Fredric March in these dual roles, which resulted in his first Academy Award for Best Actor - but it is also a remarkably innovative talkie. Director Rouben Mamoulian, who also broke new ground in the medium with…\n\nMamoulian camera work often gets a lot of credit (as it does in most of his early work), but best contribution here is how he patterns the film on his casting of March, at the time known mostly as a romantic lead. This Jekyll and Hyde is all about libido, Hyde is pretty much Jekyll with his sexual inibitions turn off. March is very good at suggesting his danger but he does so not by playing Hyde as Jekyll's inner beast, but a very evil man, there's more personality to his Hyde and one that isn't that far from his usual seductive self only without the good manners. His Jekyll is a self-serving coward who doesn't look good even in…\n\n\"Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde\" is an age-old story in application that easily resonates as common knowledge from majority of people today. Written in 1886 by legendary author Robert Louis Stevenson directly as \"Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde\", this classic story has been adapted in a vast array of contexts over the years. Uniquely, even this presentation of the story from 1931 isn't the earliest film adaptation as there was a silent feature on its story released 11 years prior in 1920. Still, this presented version of \"Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde\" directed by Rouben Mamoulian and starring Fredric March is considered by many to be the best. Even Fredric March took home an Oscar for Best…"
