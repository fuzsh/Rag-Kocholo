As a young adult in fragile health, he gave up his studies to devote himself to writing. His rhythmic, unrealistic stories were innovative for his time.\n\nTravels with a Donkey in the Cévennes (1879), Treasure Island (1883) and The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde (1886) are among his best-known works. Stevenson"
