The Bride is also a recurring character in DC lore, based on a character from James Whale's Bride of Frankenstein, a sequel to his earlier adaptation of Shelley's novel.\n\nRobert Louis Stevenson\n\nRobert Louis Stevenson (November 13, 1850 - December 3, 1894) was a Scottish novelist and poet who wrote the classic novels Treasure Island and Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde.
