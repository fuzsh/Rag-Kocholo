        "text": "Writers Write shares writing resources and writing trivia. In this post, we share details about the death of Scottish novelist and poet, Robert Louis Stevenson.\n\nRobert Louis Stevenson, born 13 November 1850, was a Scottish novelist, poet, essayist, and travel writer. A literary celebrity during his lifetime, Stevenson is best known for his novels Treasure Island, Kidnapped, and The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde. He is among the 26 most translated authors in the world.\n\nIn 1890 Stevenson purchased a tract of about 400 acres in Upolu, an island in Samoa. He settled on his estate in the village of Vailima. He took the native name Tusitala, which is Samoan for “Teller of Tales”.\n\nOn 3 December 1894, aged 44, Stevenson collapsed while talking to his wife, Fanny, and died within a few hours. He was buried with great local ceremony on Mount Vaea, Samoa, overlooking the sea.\n\nHis gravestone was inscribed with his own poem, Requiem:\n\nUnder the wide and starry sky,\n\nDig the grave and let me lie.\n\nGlad did I live and gladly die,\n\nAnd I laid me down with a will.\n\nThis be the verse you grave for me:\n\nHere he lies where he longed to be;\n\nHome is the sailor, home from sea,\n\nAnd the hunter home from the hill.\n\nStevenson was so loved by the Samoans, that his epigraph was translated to a Samoan song of grief ,which is well-known and still sung in Samoa.\n\nby Amanda Patterson\n\nIf you enjoyed this, you will love:"
