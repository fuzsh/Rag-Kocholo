        "text": "VOTE FOR US by the 14 of February 2019 Australian Podcast Awards\n\nThis episode of The Frankenpod Morgan tells Brent a bit about the first gothic novel The Castle of Otranto and its creator, Horatio Walpole the 4th Earl of Oxford, known for our purposes as Horace Walpole.\n\nYou can stream the episode on Libsyn\n\nDownload it here\n\nAdd The Frankenpod to your podcast app here\n\nOr search for The Frankenpod in your podcast app.\n\nYou can read The Castle of Otranto for free thanks to public domain and Project Gutenberg here\n\nHorace Walpole was the son of the first British prime minister Robert Walpole and entered into politics himself as the elected member for Callington Cornwall. Horace Walpole never went to Callington. The constituency was what was known as a rotten borough which meant that an elected member of a very small area could be gain the same amount of influence as someone who was elected by a very populated area.\n\nHorace spent 43 years building a gothic mansion called Strawberry Hill which is a quilt of gothic architectural elements all represented in one large building, as promised during the podcast here are some photos of Strawberry Hill:\n\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript.\n\nHorace Walpole published The Castle of Otranto anonymously in 1764, but the preface claims that it is a found text discovered by Catholic family in the north of England.\n\nIt is a story in which a tyrant and illegitimate ruler of the castle of Otranto named Manfred attempts through various nefarious and immoral means to maintain his lordship of Otranto.\n\nWhen his son Conrad is killed by a massive helmet with a particular resemblance to the helmet on the statue of the founder of Otranto, Alfonso the Good, Manfred begins to panic and freak out. He tries to divorce his wife Hippolita and marry Isabella the young woman who his son was supposed to marry.\n\nThankfully it turns out that more that one person or entity is determined to stop Manfred’s evil machinations.\n\nThe Bride Season 2 Episode 6 of The Frankenpod\n\nDownload the episode\n\nListen on libsyn\n\nSearch for The Frankenpod in your podcast app!\n\nAs it’s our podcast anniversary we thought it might be nice to return to our origins. But not Frankenstein and his creature but the potential second creature. The woman who raises so many issues of consent, possibly the most culturally visible character to be born out of a few short chapters of a book!\n\nIt’s The Bride!\n\nShe exists in Mary Shelley’s novel Frankenstein as an ambiguous collection of anatomical parts that are destroyed before she can even achieve personhood. Victor Frankenstein’s creature pressures him into creating a female from the dead just like him. When Frankenstein begins to speculate on the additional damage that a female creature could cause his concerns fall into two major categories\n\nProcreation\n\nThe one that most movies featuring the female creation explore her rejection of the original creature\n\nAs a result of these fears Victor destroys his second creation in front of his first, which is the final straw for the creature, this is when he vows to be with Victor Frankenstein on his wedding night.\n\nAnd we never see the female creature again.\n\nShe is all potential. And that is what she remained until relatively recently. It wasn’t until the 1930s that James Whale delivers The Bride of Frankenstein and Elsa Lancaster’s brilliant performance gives us the bride as we typically view her today despite various reenvisionings and reimaginings.\n\nThis episode we are going to talk about not only the 1935 classic universal monster movie The Bride of Frankenstein but one of those reimaginings. The 1985 movie The Bride starring Jennifer Beals, Clancy Brown and Sting.\n\nNow back to 1935 and The Bride of Frankenstein introduces a framing narrative that we never return to which is Mary Shelley played by Elsa Lanchester telling the rest of the story that happens after the conclusion of her novel Frankenstein to a very camp Byron and Percy Shelley. On a dark and stormy night no lass\n\nThe actual story then kicks off at the end of the original 1931 movie Frankenstein. In fact, we have a scattered reframing of the end of Frankenstein to retroactively suit their purposes.\n\nA character named Dr Pretorius calls upon the recovering Frankenstein who has been renamed appropriately Victor as in the book if you remember in the 1931 movie Frankenstein was called Henry.\n\nThe creepy doctor Pretorius has a proposition for the young doctor. One last big experiment. A collaboration.\n\nPretorius also has little people in jars… it’s a whole thing.\n\nFrankenstein’s wife Elizabeth is. Not. Into. This. And she makes this absolutely clear by talking about ominous premonitions.\n\nMeanwhile, the creature who unexpectedly survived goes on a rampage killing the rest of the family of the little girl who was killed in the original movie and others.\n\nHe fled the township\n\nHe then made a friend in an old blind fiddler who does not judge him on his appearance and teaches him language. Their domestic bliss is interrupted by some hunters who are lost and raise the alarm that the murderous monster responsible for deaths in the township.\n\nPretorius befriends the creature as he is collecting the parts for a female creature. He tells the creature that this female creation will be a friend for him.\n\nThe creature then helps Pretorious by kidnapping Elizabeth thereby forcing Frankenstein into their unholy collaboration.\n\nThey begin a long process of creation which includes Dwight Frye killing some random woman for her heart. The creature kills Dwight Frye… which is the second time that Frankenstein has killed a Dwight Frye character in as many movies. Elizabeth gets free.\n\nThe bride is brought to life.\n\nShe rejects the Male creature and in a moment of compassion, he lets Frankenstein and Elizabeth go. Before destroying the laboratory with The Bride, Pretorius and himself still inside.\n\nGuess what. It’s time to talk about Sting.\n\nYep, the 1985 movie the bride….\n\nFor more listen to Season 2 Episode 6 of The Frankenpod, The Bride\n\nYou know how we said we’d be better organised for season 2? Well that may only be marginally true. The Christmas Special that we had in the works for over a month turned into somewhat of a Christmas Disappointment .\n\nStill keen to listen? Really? Okay well here are the links.\n\nDirect Download MP3 here\n\nListen on Libsyn here\n\nAdd us to your podcast app here\n\nSo for the heck of it let’s divide the episode into five staves just like Dickens’ 1843 novella A Christmas Carol, In Prose, Being a Ghost Story of Christmas.\n\nStave 1\n\nIn which we deal with Facebook and Get Grimm, we read a lovely review from Courtney of the Cult of Domesticity and play everything is gothic, unless it’s not, then it’s something else. We also introduce the gothic texts of the episode A Muppet Christmas Carol (1990) and A Christmas Carol by Charles Dickens (1843).\n\nStave 2\n\nIn which Morgan gives a narrative summary of the events of the book and movie (for once they were pretty faithful to the plot of the source material, even if they do include Muppets).\n\nStave 3\n\nBeing a discussion of gothic elements… and Harry Potter. These elements include the tyrant, the curse, the haunting and the gothic city. Then a promo for Electric Monks.\n\nStave 4\n\nIn which Brent gets muppety, both hosts read movie names from IMDB (riveting) and Morgan is disappointed in Michael Caine.\n\nStave 5\n\nWe hear from the Lady Pod squad and we rate the stories out of 5 ice skating penguins. Three penguins a pop. In case you care.\n\nThe podcast mentioned include\n\nRabbit Holes Podcast\n\nWhatshername\n\nGet Grimm\n\nThe Cult of Domesticity\n\nElectric Monks Podcast\n\nNihilist Podcast Network\n\nVocal Fries Podcast\n\nand don’t forget to subscribe to Morgan’s new podcast The Hoopy Froods Podcast which is fan exploration of the works of Douglas Adams\n\n‘I ran as I have never run before, heedless of my own safety, desperate to go to the aid of the brave, bright little creature who had given me such consolation and cheer in that desolate spot’\n\n– The Woman in Black, Susan Hill\n\nThis episode is on Susan Hill’s ‘The Woman in Black’ and the 2012 Hammer Horror flick ‘The Woman in Black’\n\nYou can listen on libsyn here\n\nYou can download here\n\nand you can add us to your podcast app by searching for The Frankenpod\n\nAnd hit subscribe… we’d appreciate it\n\nOur promo this week is from the Fataliteas podcast\n\nThe Woman in Black is a story In which our hero, Spider the floofy dog, detects a problem… there is also some guy named Arthur Kipps who does a bunch of stuff. But the real story is about one floofy little dog who’s the bravest girl in the whole darn story.\n\nThe Woman in Black is a ghost story that centres around the haunting of a house by a creepy, skeletal woman in black. A young solicitor Arthur Kipps gets sent to a creepy place a la Jonathan harker in Dracula. Kipps is sent to settle the affairs of Alice Drablow, a reclusive elderly lady who lives in a creepy house called Eel Marsh which is only accessable at low tide. Once the tide is in you are stuck there with the creepy shadows, ominous noises and scary wildlife. At the nearest town, Crithin Gifford, everyone is sending Kipps some serious don’t-go-to-Eel-Marsh-vibes.\n\nA spectre haunts Eel Marsh, a spectre that lures children to their deaths. There is a lot of child death in this episode. We try not to be too graphic, but if you’ve seen the movie you know that the graphic deaths are a huge part of the story. Not so much in the book. It is an atmospheric gothic horror that Susan Hill crafts drawing from classic horror stories. You can really feel the influence of the Brontës and Henry James in this book.\n\nApart from the graphic/atmospheric horror another key difference between the book and the movie is the biographical timeline of Mr Kipps. Whether he is a young enthusiastic solicitor looking to make a name for himself, or a greiving widower barely hanging on to his job as a solicitor for the sake of his young child, the Woman in Black has her sights set on Arthur Kipps and she wants revenge\n\nPicture credit\n\n“Mothman IMG_1819” by OZinOH is licensed under CC BY-NC 2.0\n\nThe objects and apparitions do not necessarily originate on another planet and may not even exist as permanent constructions of matter. It is more likely that we see what we want to see and interpret such visions according to our contemporary beliefs.\n\n– John Keel, The Mothman Prophecies (1975 novel)\n\nJohn Klein: I think we can assume that these entities are more advanced than us. Why don’t they just come right out and tell us what’s on their minds?\n\nAlexander Leek: You’re more advanced than a cockroach, have you ever tried explaining yourself to one of them?\n\n– The Mothman Prophecies (2002 movie)\n\nYou can listen on Libsyn\n\nYou can download as an MP3\n\nOr add us to your podcast app\n\nOn December 15th 1967 Point Pleasant’s Silver Bridge collapsed resulting in the tragic deaths of 46 people. There are still many residents of the area who were directly effected by the disaster.\n\nThis tragedy would have become a sad part of local history if it were not for a ufologist, author and paranormal investigator, John Keel, who happened to be investigating sightings in the area in the months prior to the bridge collapse. Point Pleasant locals seem to have mixed feelings about the way that Keel’s book the Mothman Prophecies framed and sensationalised the events that took place in their city.\n\nSo about 3 months ago we thought it would be fun to cover the mothman. I even sought out the source material and I knew that Jenni and Shelby would be able to give some insight as their whole darn podcast is about myths, legends and cryptids. But it turns out that the 2002 film would prove to be not quite what we expected from our old pal the mothman. If you want more info on the mothman or weird demon things that braid women’s hair I highly recommend checking out the Wives Tales podcast!\n\nOur promo this week is from the amazing Cutaways podcast. Honestly we’ve all internalised countless rom coms, even if we aren’t too keen on the genre and this podcast has a lot of fun while taking down some of garbage people and situations that go unquestioned.\n\nWant to support our nonsense?
