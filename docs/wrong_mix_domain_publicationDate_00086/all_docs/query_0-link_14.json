        "text": "Hi crew! üëãüèª I have this annoying little habit of adding older books to my TBR and then just never reading them, and most of those older books on my TBR end up being sci-fi.\n\nThe term ‚Äòclassic‚Äô is entirely subjective but my definition of classic sci-fi leans towards books published in the 20th century or earlier that have a cult following or have been cited as being influential. You may have a different definition of what makes something a ‚Äòclassic‚Äô and that‚Äôs totally fine!\n\nNeuromancer by William Gibson\n\nThis book is a very recent addition to my TBR thanks to a recommendation from a colleague of mine, and I‚Äôm really interested in this one. I don‚Äôt know much about it other than it being one of the earlier cyberpunk novels but I think going into this one without knowing very much about it could be a good thing. Plus, it‚Äôs under 300 pages which is always a bonus to me.\n\nI Am Legend by Richard Matheson\n\nI haven‚Äôt seen any of the adaptations of this book outside of the Simpsons parody of The Omega Man, so this one really interests me. Zombies aren‚Äôt my favourite kind of monsters because there are only so many ways you can write them differently, but Matheson refers to the creatures in the book as vampires so I‚Äôm curious to see how he justifies that.\n\nA Clockwork Orange by Anthony Burgess\n\nI have a gorgeous anniversary edition of this book in my collection and yet I constantly forget that I have it. It‚Äôs been a long time since I watched the movie, which I enjoyed, but I‚Äôm still curious to see how much it differs from the book. I think it‚Äôs also kind of telling that most of the books on this list I added when I was in a huge dystopian mood and my understanding of classic SF was just dystopian and post-apocalyptic fiction. Oh, how time has shown me different things.\n\nThe Hitchhiker‚Äôs Guide to the Galaxy by Douglas Adams\n\nIt may not be a crime to be a British sci-fi fan who hasn‚Äôt read The Hitchhiker‚Äôs Guide to the Galaxy but it sure does feel like one. This is one of many books that has been on my TBR for a long time and I will get around to it eventually, but this is one that I‚Äôm not getting to in a hurry.\n\nBrave New World by Aldous Huxley\n\nI have had an unread copy of this book for so long that it‚Äôs getting to be a little embarrassing. I‚Äôve read plenty of dystopian novels where the society the characters live in is outwardly terrible to drive the point home, but one that masquerades as a utopia to keep the masses ignorant is one that‚Äôs very interesting to me. I will get to this one eventually!\n\nWho Goes There? by John W. Campbell Jr.\n\nIf you didn‚Äôt know (but you should by now), John Carpenter‚Äôs The Thing is not only one of my favourite horror movies and one of my favourite sci-fi movies, but one of my favourite movies ever. I didn‚Äôt realise that it was based on a book until the title showed up in the credits and I‚Äôve been curious about it ever since. Hopefully, this won‚Äôt be too difficult to find because I want to see how it compares to the movie.\n\nWe by Yevgeny Zamyatin\n\nOne of my favourite novels is George Orwell‚Äôs Nineteen Eighty-Four, even after it‚Äôs been misinterpreted as anti-communist (it‚Äôs not) or anti-socialist (it‚Äôs not) and taught horribly by teachers who are just following the curriculum, and I believe that this novel is a precursor to that. I haven‚Äôt read any Russian literature, and especially not Soviet literature because the government did have mandates in place that made sure most art was propaganda, and I‚Äôm not about that. That being said, I am curious to read an anti-totalitarian stance from someone who actually experienced living in the Soviet Union, rather than from someone on the outside making an allegory.\n\nStrange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde by Robert Louis Stevenson\n\nIf I had a pound for every time I told myself I was going to finally read this book, I could be considerably better off than I am now. This book is in that grey area between Gothic literature and sci-fi because it‚Äôs seen as proto-science fiction just like Frankenstein, but the themes in it are firmly Gothic. I don‚Äôt really have much of an excuse to have still not read this book because it‚Äôs so short and I have a physical copy, but I just keep forgetting that it exists.\n\ntalk to me!\n\nWhat classic SF books are on your TBR?"
