I remember my fourteenth summer when I decided to read the entire Edgar Rice Burrough’s “Tarzan” series and then the “Mucker” books as well. I think that year began the summertime tradition of reading as many books as I could before school started again. There was the summer of “Anne”, reading the Anne of Green Gables series and a great summer of “Janette”, buried in Janette Oke books. Oh and who could forget the summer of “Peretti”, where I was left on the edge of my seat reading his supernatural thrillers?!\n\nNow don’t get me wrong, I also read during the rest of the year but summer gives me the time to really immerse myself in a series or read stand-alone books by the same author. Also it is the most relaxing thing to do while camping, or sitting at the beach, or on those rainy summer days. So I’ve decided to make a fun little poll for READERS ONLY! Here is a list of 81 of my favorite “classic” books.\n\nHow many books from this list have you read? Just for the record, every book I’ve listed, I have also read."
