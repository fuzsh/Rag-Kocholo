        "text": "Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm has delighted readers for over 100 years. Published in 1903, when girls were inevitably depicted as pretty, gentle and proper, Rebecca Rowena Randall burst onto the scene of children’s literature. Sent to live with her prim and proper Aunt Miranda, who is expecting her much more demure sister, Rebecca is a “bird of a very different feather”. She has “a small, plain face illuminated by a pair of eyes carrying such messages, such suggestions, such hints of sleeping power and insight, that one never tired of looking into their shining depths…” To her Aunt Miranda’s continual dismay, Rebecca is exuberant, irrepressible, and spirited – not at all “proper” or “demure”. She wins over her aunt soon enough, and the whole town, and thousands of readers and listeners everywhere.\n\nRebecca of Sunnybrook Farm by Kate Douglas Wiggin\n\nPublished 2017 by Post Hypnotic Press (Originally Published 1903)\n\nFormat: e-audiobook; 8 hours, 11 minutes\n\nClassics / Young Adult\n\nAlso By This Author: The Bird’s Christmas Carol, Mother Carey’s Chickens\n\nGoodreads | Audible\n\nMy Rating: ♥♥♥♥\n\nThoughts\n\nSurprisingly, I had never heard of this novel until very recently, which shocks me because it’s the type of classic young adult novel that I usually gravitate towards. I was also pretty surprised at the similarities between this novel and L.M. Montgomery’s novels Anne of Green Gables and Emily of New Moon, especially since Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm was published several years beforehand.\n\nRebecca of Sunnybrook Farm follows the journey of Rebecca Randall as she leaves her family home to live with her two polar opposite aunts. When Rebecca arrives, she is rather plain and unbecoming, but her personality and imagination are quite the opposite. Her guardians, especially Aunt Miranda, do their best to raise Rebecca into a respectable young lady. If you’re familiar with L.M. Montgomery’s most iconic heroine, Anne Shirley, then you will probably notice the similarities between her and Wiggin’s Rebecca Randall, although I would argue that Rebecca is a milder mix between Anne Shirley and Emily Starr, another one of Montgomery’s heroines.\n\nMy favorite aspect of Wiggin’s novel was Rebecca’s character growth. She reigns in her temper and impulsive reactions fairly quickly, and her adolescent mistakes become fortuitous opportunities, such as when she sells a large amount of soap to Adam Ladd. She also possesses a pure heart and genuinely cares about others.\n\nRead This Book If…\n\n…you enjoy novels with fierce, unconventional heroines.\n\n…you appreciate the traditions and values of small town, early 20th century life.\n\n…you are a fan of novels like Anne of Green Gables and Emily of New Moon by L.M. Montgomery.\n\nAudiobook Review\n\nI previously listened to (and loved!) the first three Anne of Green Gables novels which were produced by Post Hypnotic Press, so I was looking forward to listening to their adaptation of Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm. Ann Richardson’s performance did not disappoint! She brought a liveliness to the characters that was enjoyable and engaging. I especially love listening to classic novels on audiobook, and I would definitely listen to another one of Ann Richardson’s narrations :)\n\nAbout the Narrator: Ann Richardson has been narrating for major publishers as well as independently published authors since 2008, happily giving voice to classics such as “Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm” (Kate Douglas Wiggin), “Greenwillow” (B.J. Chute), and Zane Grey’s “Riders of the Purple Sage”. Her narrations have been awarded AudioFile Magazine’s Earphones Awards, as well as having been finalists in the Voice Arts Awards in 2016 and 2017. In her spare time Ann is a volunteer narrator for Learning Ally (formerly Recording For the Blind and Dyslexic), and speaks to author groups and at writers’ conferences about the process of making an audiobook.\n\nGiveaway!\n\nRebecca of Sunnybrook Farm Giveaway: 3-Month Audible Membership\n\nAnd stop by the tour page to check out other blogger’s reviews for Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm :)\n\nDisclaimer: I received this audiobook as part of my participation in a blog tour with Audiobookworm Promotions. The tour is being sponsored by Post Hypnotic Press. The gifting of this audiobook did not affect my opinion of it.\n\nValancy lives a drab life with her overbearing mother and prying aunt. Then a shocking diagnosis from Dr. Trent prompts her to make a fresh start. For the first time, she does and says exactly what she feels. As she expands her limited horizons, Valancy undergoes a transformation, discovering a new world of love and happiness. One of Lucy Maud Montgomery’s only novels intended for an adult audience, The Blue Castle is filled with humour and romance.\n\nThe Blue Castle by L.M. Montgomery\n\nPublished 1926 by McClelland and Stewart\n\nFormat: e-book rental from Hoopla*; 218 pages\n\nClassics/Romance/Adventure\n\nAlso By This Author: Anne of Green Gables, Anne of Avonlea, Anne of the Island, Kilmeny of the Orchard\n\nGoodreads | Amazon\n\nMy Rating: ♥♥♥♥♥\n\nThoughts\n\nHappy Valentine’s Day! Today I am blogging about a new favorite love story of mine by one of my favorite authors.\n\nThe Blue Castle was the first book I read in 2018, and as soon as I finished, I knew I had found my favorite read of the year. I know I will probably read 40+ more books this year, but I don’t think any of them will resonate with me more than The Blue Castle. It’s a hidden gem of a novel and I only wish I had read it sooner!\n\nThe characters in this novel are so bold and entertaining. The heroine, Valancy Sterling, is as lovable and admirable as Anne Elliot, Jane Eyre, and Jo March, and the supporting characters will honestly make you laugh until you cry. There was a smile plastered on my face for most of the novel (with the exception of a few moving scenes–I mean, this is L.M. Montgomery we’re discussing!).\n\nThe Blue Castle is one of those books you bring with you everywhere, just in case you’re able to sneak in a page or chapter while you’re out, and once you finish the book, you’re ready to start it all over again. I felt so happy and thrilled when I finished it, and I couldn’t stop recommending it to friends.\n\nYou May Also Enjoy…\n\nJane Eyre by Charlotte Bronte\n\nWives and Daughters by Elizabeth Gaskell\n\nPersuasion by Jane Austen\n\nDr. Thorne by Anthony Trollope\n\n(I haven’t read this one yet, but I loved the miniseries!)\n\nFinal Musings\n\nI tried listening to The Blue Castle on audiobook, but it just wasn’t good. This is one of those books you need to read in print.\n\nOne of my favorite things about reading The Blue Castle is that I didn’t know anything about it beforehand, and even the blurb on the cover gives nothing away, so I was in full suspense and surprised by so many of the plot points. That’s why I’ll keep this review short and sweet, but if you have read it and would like to gush about it with me, leave a comment below :)\n\n*Hoopla is one of my favorite bookish services!

Eric has taken the two-month teaching post only as a favor to a friend — but fate throws in his path a beautiful, mysterious girl named Kilmeny Gordon. With jet black hair and sea blue eyes, Kilmeny immediately captures Eric’s heart. But Kilmeny cannot speak, and Eric is concerned for and bewitched by this shy, sensitive mute girl. For the first time in his life Eric must work hard for something he wants badly. And there is nothing he wants more than for Kilmeny to retum his love.\n\nKilmeny of the Orchard by L.M. Montgomery\n\nPublished 1910 by L.C. Page & Company\n\nFormat: Hardcover, 134 pages; Audiobook, 4 hours\n\nClassics/Romance\n\nAlso By This Author: Anne of Green Gables, Anne of Avonlea, Anne of the Island, Emily of New Moon series, The Blue Castle\n\nGoodreads | Amazon\n\nMy Rating: ♥♥♥♥\n\nThoughts\n\nI am a strong believer in judging a book by its cover, especially when the cover is gorgeous like Kilmeny of the Orchard. I have been scouring every local bookstore and thrift store in town trying to find any copies of the Bantam editions of L.M. Montgomery’s novels because the covers are beautiful enough to frame. (Side note: if anyone finds Bantam editions of Kilmeny or The Blue Castle that are in good condition, please let me know! I’ve never been a book collector before, but it’s almost become a hobby of mine to own all of Bantam editions of L.M. Montgomery’s novels)\n\nThe story of Kilmeny isn’t the most endearing of Montgomery’s novels, but the writing is captivating. The first orchard scene, when Eric happens upon Kilmeny as she’s playing her violin, is probably my favorite scene in the novel. Montgomery’s descriptions are so poetic and vibrant that I feel as if I’m walking through the orchard myself.\n\nIt was an elusive, haunting melody, strangely suited to the time and place; it had in it the sigh of the wind in the woods, the eerie whispering of the grasses at dewfall, the white thoughts of the June lilies, the rejoicing of the apple blossoms; all the soul of all the old laughter and song and tears and gladness and sobs the orchard had ever known in the lost years; and besides all this, there was in it a pitiful, plaintive cry as of some imprisoned thing calling for freedom and utterance.\n\nI admire L.M. Montgomery’s ability to be wistful and hopeful at the same time. Whenever I read any of her books I always simultaneously feel nostalgic and desirous of enjoying every beautiful little moment.\n\nRead This Book If…\n\n…you need a happy novel that will touch you deep in your heart.\n\n…you’re ready for it to be Spring!\n\n…you love Romantic characters and poetic language.\n\nFinal Musings\n\nI’ve read three L.M. Montgomery novels since the New Year, and I’m currently on my fourth (Chronicles of Avonlea). I would love to buddy read some more of her novels this year, or participate in any L.M. Montgomery blogging events, so please drop me a line in the comments if you know of any or if you’d like to buddy read with me!\n\nOne pitch-black London morning, a ghoulish little man tramples a young girl and continues heedlessly on his way. Caught by a passerby and returned to the scene of the crime, the man is forced to pay £100 in restitution. He produces ten pounds in gold and a check for the remainder. Curiously, the check bears the signature of the well-regarded Dr. Henry Jekyll. Even stranger, Dr. Jekyll’s will names this same awful and mysterious little man, Mr. Hyde, as the sole beneficiary. Troubled by the coincidence, Dr. Jekyll’s attorney visits his client. What he uncovers is a tale so strange and terrifying it has seeped into the very fabric of our consciousness.\n\nThe Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde by Robert Louis Stevenson\n\nPublished January 5, 1886 by Longmans, Green & Co.\n\nFormat: e-book/audiobook; 64 pages/3 hours 3 minutes\n\nClassics/Science Fiction\n\nAlso By This Author: Treasure Island, Kidnapped\n\nGoodreads | Amazon\n\nMy Rating: ♥♥♥\n\nThoughts:\n\nI was really looking forward to reading this spooky gothic classic by Robert Louis Stevenson, especially during the Halloween season. Unfortunately, I was sadly disappointed. While the novel’s plot and characters were intriguing, I found the writing style incredibly boring. It took me at least two weeks to finish a three hour audiobook, mainly because I kept zoning out and losing interest as the story went on.\n\nEveryone knows the basic plot of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde: a curious scientist drinks a potion that turns him into a murderous lunatic, and overtime Dr. Jekyll becomes consumed by this psychotic half of his split-personality. It’s a fascinating plot for a story, which is why Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde remains so popular over a century later. While I did enjoy the beginning and the end of this novel, I felt that the middle dragged on without very many exciting things happening, aside from some very lengthy passages of dialogue that could have used a sentence or two of description.\n\nI would recommend this book to fans of gothic lit and classic sci-fi (namely H.G. Wells’s novels), but I wouldn’t necessarily recommend an audiobook version unless the narrator is extremely entertaining. I believe the version I listened to was from Librivox.\n\nYou May Also Enjoy:\n\nThe Invisible Man by H.G. Wells\n\nFrankenstein by Mary Shelley\n\nWhen Ross Poldark plunges into a highly speculative mining venture, he risks not only his family’s financial security but also his already turbulent marriage. When his old flame, Elizabeth, reenters his life, Ross is tested like never before. But soon his wife, Demelza, retaliates, becoming dangerously involved with a handsome Scottish cavalry officer of her own.\n\nWith the looming threat of bankruptcy and scandal, the Poldarks now face the possibility of disaster on all fronts. Will they be able to keep it together before everything falls apart?\n\nA tale of romance, revenge, and risk, Warleggan brings you characters and rivalries you won’t soon forget.\n\nWarleggan (The Poldark Saga #4) by Winston Graham\n\nPublished 1953\n\nFormat: audiobook; 14 hours 19 minutes\n\nClassics/Historical Fiction\n\nAlso By This Author: Ross Poldark (The Poldark Saga #1), Demelza (The Poldark Saga #3), Jeremy Poldark (The Poldark Saga #3), Cordelia\n\nGoodreads My Rating: ♥♥♥♥\n\nThoughts\n\nHonestly, I was dreading reading this volume of the Poldark Saga. If you watch the BBC/Masterpiece show, you’ll understand why. Without giving away too many spoilers, Ross does something unforgivable, and it threatens to destroy his entire family. Fortunately, I watched Season 2 before reading Jeremy Poldark and Waleggan (the two books Season 2 is based on), so I was prepared, and although it was a really difficult section of the book to read, the ending was very sweet and made up for it (mostly).\n\nSurprisingly, I ended up enjoying Warleggan more than its predecessor. It felt like so much more happened in this novel than in Jeremy Poldark, and near the end I was more into the book than I originally anticipated.\n\nSeason 2 of Poldark is still rather fresh in my mind since I recently rewatched the last few episodes before Season 3 premiered, so I was doing a lot of comparing and contrasting between the novel and it’s on-screen adaptation. In my opinion, the tv show handles Ross’s infidelity and the other characters’ reactions to it in a much more realistic and forgiving light. In the book, it feels like Ross pretty much has his way and the female characters involved simply submit to his will and desires. I was very disappointed with how almost passive Demelza was in the book. She’s one of the fiercest literary characters I know of, and I felt that her reaction in the tv show was more realistic. I think this may be the part of the series where TV Demelza branches off from Book Demelza. I think this can probably be attributed to the fact that the show’s writer is a woman ;)\n\nAudiobook Review\n\nFor the most part, I really enjoyed this narration of Warleggan. The narrator, Oliver Hembrough, has an entertaining voice that is easy to listen to. The only letdown for me was that his voice for most of the ladies, Demelza especially, was pitiful. Demelza is fierce, yet the narrator depicted her in a moping way that I was not a fan of. I can understand Elizabeth sounding that way, but not passionate Demelza.\n\nFinal Musings\n\nThe ending of Warleggan was very touching, and there are several reconciliations that will pull at your heartstrings. I’m very tempted to pick up the next book before this season is even over, but at the same time I don’t want to spoil anything! I enjoy watching the show and then reading the books afterwards.\n\nJust for fun, and because it doesn’t actually happen in the novel, here’s my favorite scene from Season 2 of Poldark:\n\nRoss Poldark faces the darkest hour of his life in this third novel of the Poldark series. Reeling from the tragic death of a loved one, Captain Poldark vents his grief by inciting impoverished locals to salvage the contents of a ship run aground in a storm-an act for which British law proscribes death by hanging. As Ross is brought to trial for his involvement, his wife Demelza tries to rally support to save him and their family. But plenty of enemies would be happy to see her husband convicted, not the least of which is George Warleggan, the powerful banker whose personal rivalry with Ross threatens to destroy the Poldarks.\n\nThe third book in Winston Graham’s hugely popular Poldark series, Jeremy Poldark brings to vivid life the clash of rich and poor, loss and love, powerful and powerless in a mesmerizing saga you won’t forget.\n\nJeremy Poldark (The Poldark Saga #3) by Winston Graham\n\nPublished 1950\n\nFormat: paperback; 244 pages\n\nClassics/Historical Fiction/Romance\n\nAlso By This Author: Ross Poldark (The Poldark Saga #1), Demelza (The Poldark Saga #3), Marnie, Cordelia\n\nGoodreads My Rating: ♥♥♥♥\n\nThoughts:\n\nI’ve finally started catching up on the Poldark novels, now that Season 3 has premiered. If, like me, you are a fan of the BBC/Masterpiece show Poldark, Jeremy Poldark covers the events from the first half of Season 2. If you haven’t watched up to that point in the show, or if you haven’t read the first two novels, beware of spoilers :)\n\nJeremy Poldark gets its name from a character that isn’t even introduced until the end of the novel; for the most part the book follows Ross Poldark’s trial (remember: he was arrested at the end of Demelza) and his ever growing rivalry with George Warleggan. Like the previous Poldark novel (and what I’m gathering is an interwoven theme throughout the entire series), this book has its fair share of heartbreak. Ross and Demelza are very much grieving the death of their daughter Julia, but they also have tender moments between themselves and close friends.\n\nMy favorite part about this novel is the blossoming relationship between Dr. Dwight Enys and Caroline Penvenen. Since I’m watching the show first before reading the books each season is based on, I was already a fan of Dwight and Caroline, but this book made me fall in love with both characters and their relationship even more. Book-Caroline is as headstrong as TV-Caroline, but she also has an even deeper streak of sassiness that I wish we saw more of on the show.\n\nRead This Book If…\n\n…you enjoy family sagas, especially ones including plenty of tension and drama.\n\n…you’re a fan of historical fiction.\n\n…you are intrigued by novels that feature opposing socioeconomic classes.\n\n…you’ve already read Ross Poldark and Demelza.\n\nFinal Musings:\n\nHere’s a trailer for Season 2 of the show (they make it look like a dramatic soap opera, I know, but it kind of is in some ways). I’ll let you guess what my favorite scene is (even though it doesn’t even happen in the books)…\n\nNotable for its sheer invention, suspense, and psychological nuance, The Invisible Man focuses on Griffin, a scientist who has discovered the means to make himself invisible. His initial, almost comedic, adventures are soon overshadowed by the bizarre streak of terror he unleashes upon the inhabitants of a small village.\n\nThe Invisible Man by H. G. Wells\n\nPublished 1897 by Pearson’s Weekly\n\nFormat: e-book/library hardcover/audiobook; 192 pages (clearly I couldn’t put this book down!)\n\nClassics/Science Fiction\n\nAlso By This Author: War of the Worlds, The Time Machine\n\nGoodreads\n\nMy Rating: ♥♥♥♥\n\nThoughts\n\nWhat a creepy story! I have to admit, when I first picked up The Invisible Man, I was not expecting it to be a Gothic suspense story, so I was pleasantly surprised to read the subtitle: a grotesque romance. I love Gothic literature, especially when paired with science fiction! [side note: there is no romance in this novella; according to the footnote, that description refers to the fact that this story deals with supernatural incidents that are removed from every day life.]\n\nThe Invisible Man starts off right away by throwing readers into suspense and intrigue. We meet our antihero, whom we later learn is called Griffin, as he arrives at an inn and begins terrorizing the local townspeople. Terrorizing is a little harsh; at first he is simply worrying them with his shroud of mystery, but as the novel progresses and Griffin’s condition worsens, he enacts a self-proclaimed reign of terror.\n\nI must confess that in the beginning I liked Griffin, despite the fact that he was impatient, rude, and prone to outbursts. He reminded me of Mr. Rochester from Jane Eyre and he had an unusual sense of humor about him. But then Griffin started harming other people without remorse, and I felt torn over my former sympathy for his predicament and my later fear of and disappointment in his mental decline.\n\nThere are several minor characters, but none of them are nearly as interesting as Griffin; however, I did feel for both Marvel and Dr. Kemp at times.\n\nThe ending was appropriately abrupt, and the story was resolved in a surprising and inevitable way (the best type of ending!). This was my third H. G. Wells novel, after War of the Worlds and The Time Machine, and I will definitely be reading more of his novels in the future.\n\nRead This Book If…\n\n…you enjoy classic novels and science fiction.\n\n…you appreciate Gothic literature.\n\n…you’re interested in books that feature a villain or antihero as the main character.\n\n…you’re looking for a suspenseful story that has a fair amount of creepiness.\n\nYou May Also Enjoy…\n\nThe War of the Worlds by H. G. Wells\n\nFrankenstein by Mary Shelley\n\nThe Birthmark by Nathaniel Hawthorne\n\nThe Time Traveller embarks on an astonishing journey into the future. His Time Machine transports him to a far-distant but dying world where humanity is divided into two classes: the graceful, idle Eloi who inhabit the idyllic surface of the world, and the Morlocks, ugly nocturnal creatures who live and work underground. In The Time Machine, Wells created one of the first and finest science fiction stories: a social allegory that is both vivid and perturbing.\n\nThe Time Machine by H. G. Wells\n\nPublished 1895 by William Heinemann\n\nFormat: paperback; 118 pages\n\nClassics/Science Fiction\n\nAlso By This Author: War of the Worlds, The Invisible Man\n\nGoodreads\n\nMy Rating: ♥♥♥♥♥\n\nThoughts\n\nWhen I was twelve or thirteen years old, I remember watching what was quite possibly my first ever live-action sci-fi movie. However, for years afterwards I could not remember the title, or the basic plot, or even the actors; I could only remember one scene that involved a beautiful, misfortunate lady in a red dress and a man determined to save her life. For years I longed to find this movie and watch it again. It bothered me like an itch I just couldn’t scratch, and I started to believe that I had dreamed the whole thing up.\n\nThen one day, somehow, I stumbled across the movie The Time Machine. I probably picked it up for one of two reasons: Guy Pierce was on the cover, and it was about time travel. But then I watched it, and my heart filled up with excitement because at long last I had been reunited with THE movie!\n\nSince then I have watched and re-watched The Time Machine multiple times, and I credit it as the movie that sparked my love for all-things time travel. But, until only recently, I had never actually read the novella that the movie is based on. H.G. Wells is often regarded as the father of Science Fiction, and The Time Machine is what originally brought him critical acclaim at the end of the 19th century. It was one of the first stories of its kind, and it propagated sub-genres of science fiction that remain wildly popular today.\n\nThe Time Machine is told through the narrator, known only as The Time Traveler. In the same manner Jules Verne, another pioneer of science fiction, introduced Phineas Fogg in Around the World in 80 Days, H.G. Wells introduces The Time Traveler and his time machine by presenting them to a group of intelligent and skeptical peers. The majority of the novella is told as a recounting of The Time Traveler’s journey to the very distant future, when the human species has devolved into two opposing and rival species. The Eloi, which represents the consequences of mankind’s political and cultural aspirations, is a frail and indistinct group that has few interests or emotions in general. Their way of life is free from burden, work, or even relationships. The Morlock tribe, on the other hand, symbolizes the savage and industrial sides of mankind. They are completely nocturnal and reside underground, surfacing only at night to hunt.\n\nThe suspense in The Time Machine is incredibly thick and mystical. Even though, through Wells’s use of foreshadow, you know what is going to happen, you can’t help but become caught up in The Time Traveler’s journey to and escape from the future. The imagery of dying Earth and the fall of humanity is both fascinating and worrisome. When coupled with H. G. Wells’s technical voice, it’s easy to pretend you’re reading a memoir and not merely a science fiction novella.\n\nRead This Book If…\n\n…you appreciate both classics and science fiction.\n\n…you are looking for a book that can be read in one sitting.\n\n…you have a healthy imagination and sense of curiosity.\n\n…you love stories about time travel and dystopian societies.\n\nYou May Also Enjoy…\n\nAround the World in Eighty Days by Jules Verne\n\nJourney to the Center of the Earth by Jules Verne\n\nThe Martian Chronicles by Ray Bradbury\n\nFinal Musings\n\nDoes anybody else love the movie The Time Machine? Fun fact: it is directed by H. G. Well’s great-grandson.\n\nAnne of the Island was published in 1915, seven years after the best-selling Anne of Green Gables, partly because of the continuing clamor for more Anne from her fans – a fan base that continues to grow today!\n\nIn this continuation of the story of Anne Shirley, Anne leaves Green Gables and her work as a teacher in Avonlea to pursue her original dream (which she gave up in Anne of Green Gables) of taking further education at Redmond College in Nova Scotia. Gilbert Blythe and Charlie Sloane enroll as well, as does Anne’s friend from Queen’s Academy, Priscilla Grant. During her first week of school, Anne befriends Philippa Gordon, a beautiful girl whose frivolous ways charm her. Philippa (Phil for short) also happens to be from Anne’s birthplace of Bolingbroke, Nova Scotia. Anne, always the good scholar, studies hard, but she also has many life lessons. This book sees Anne leave behind girlhood to blossom into a mature young woman.\n\nAnne of the Island by L.M. Montgomery\n\nPublished 2014 by Post Hypnotic Press (Originally Published 1915)\n\nFormat: e-audiobook; 8 hours, 20 minutes\n\nClassics / Young Adult\n\nAlso By This Author: Anne of Green Gables, Anne of Avonlea, Emily of New Moon\n\nGoodreads | Audible | Publisher\n\nMy Rating: ♥♥♥♥♥\n\nThoughts\n\nEven though I’ve read Anne of the Island several times, and there are still five books that follow it, I feel sad, as if Anne’s story is over. Which it isn’t, honestly! Anne of the Island only marks the end of Anne’s beginning. So I will contribute these sad feelings to what I like to call a “book hangover.” Apparently it is still possible to be wrapped up in a book you’ve read and reread multiple times.\n\nAnne of the Island is often regarded as the most popular installment of L.M. Montgomery’s beloved Anne series, and that is most likely due to the fact that this novel is a culmination of events that started back in Anne of Green Gables. Anne finally gets to go off to college, after having put her education on hold to save up money through teaching. She also experiences romance in several different and, in one particular case, hilarious ways. Finally, Anne gets to see multiple dreams of hers realized, and the outcomes are particular surprising.\n\nAlthough Anne of Green Gables is my favorite novel, Anne of the Island (and book #5: Anne’s House of Dreams, as well) holds a very dear place in my heart. There are so many sweet and sentimental scenes in this book that really pull on your heartstrings. Anne experiences heavier emotions, such as love and grief, but now as an adult. In Anne of Green Gables and Anne of Avonlea, Anne is still growing up and learning about who she is and who she wants to be. In Anne of the Island, Anne has to actually make decisions about her future, and, as she says perfectly, “I do know my own mind…the trouble is, my mind changes and then I have to get acquainted with it all over again.”\n\nRead This Book If…\n\n…you’ve previously read Anne of Green Gables and Anne of Avonlea and you need more Anne in your life!\n\n…you are looking for a book that makes you feel.\n\n…you appreciate good storytelling.\n\n…you love books that make you laugh, cry, swoon, and feel suspense.\n\nAudiobook Review\n\nI’ve been listening to many different audiobooks lately, and I can tell you that a narrator can either enlighten or ruin a story. Colleen Winton does a fantastic job at bringing Anne Shirley and the rest of the rest of L.M. Montgomery’s beloved characters to life. I would love to know if there were plans to have her narrate the rest of the Anne series, because I would definitely enjoy listening to them!\n\nAbout the Narrator: Colleen is a Vancouver actor, singer, dancer, director and choreographer…and now a narrator. Her career has taken her all over the country and includes the Stratford, Shaw and Charlottetown Festivals, the original Canadian companies of CATS and Show Boat, extensive film/TV credits, and numerous directing/choreographing credits. Her stage work has been honored with numerous nominations and a Jessie and Ovation award and she received a cultural award given by her local Chamber of Commerce. She was especially pleased to have recorded the works of L.M. Montgomery for Post Hypnotic Press just before she embarked on a production of the musical Anne of Green Gables at Theatre Calgary in which she plays Marilla Cuthbert.\n\nAnne of Green Gables Giveaway: Three Winners\n\nIf you are interested in this audiobook, enter into a giveaway for a chance to win a copy of Colleen Winton’s narrations for Anne of Green Gables, Anne of Avonlea, and Anne of the Island!

The tour is being sponsored by Post Hypnotic Press. The gifting of this audiobook did not affect my opinion of it.\n\nFollowing Anne of Green Gables (1908), this book covers the second chapter in the life of Anne Shirley. We learn of Anne’s doings from the age of 16 to 18, during the two years that she teaches at Avonlea school. It includes many of the characters from Anne of Green Gables, as well as new ones: Mr. Harrison and his foul-mouthed parrot, Miss Lavendar Lewis, Paul Irving, and the twins Dora (sweet and well behaved) and Davy (mischievious and in constant trouble). Anne matures, slightly, but she gets into a number of her familiar pickles, as only Anne can: She accidentally sells her neighbor’s cow (having mistaken it for her own), gets stuck in a broken duck house roof while peeping into a pantry window, and more.\n\nAnne of Avonlea by L.M. Montgomery\n\nPublished 2014 by Post Hypnotic Press (Originally Published 1909)\n\nFormat: e-audiobook; 9 hours, 5 minutes\n\nClassics / Young Adult\n\nAlso By This Author: Anne of Green Gables, Anne of the Island, Emily of New Moon\n\nGoodreads | Audible | Publisher\n\nMy Rating: ♥♥♥♥♥\n\nThoughts\n\nIt’s amazing what you pick up from a book when you listen to the audiobook version, even if you’ve read the book countless times before. I have read and reread Anne of Avonlea several times since I was in elementary school, but I had never connected with this quote before now: “She seemed to walk in an atmosphere of things about to happen.” What a perfectly lovely description of Anne!\n\nIn Anne of Avonela, a lot of things do happen to Anne: she becomes a teacher, she turns a grumpy old neighbor into an unlikely friend, and, my personal favorites, she stumbles upon an enchanted cottage in the wood and helps to reunite two lost lovers. In this novel we discover Anne the opportunist, who never shies away from the prospect of an adventure.\n\nBesides Anne, we also reconnect with Marilla, Diana, and Gilbert, and we are introduced to several new brilliant characters, including Mr. Harrison and his spiteful parrot, Ginger, ethereal Ms. Lavender, and the polar opposite twins, Davy and Dora (more on Davy down below!). L.M. Montgomery is a master story teller and through these complex characters she tells the most delightful and inspiring stories.\n\nLike many other second installments in a series, it’s may be easy to overlook Anne of Avonlea as merely a bridge between Anne of Green Gables and Anne of the Island, but I have always regarded this novel as one of the best in the series. Anne is becoming more of who she will be as an adult, but she still has her typical mishaps and serendipitous adventures that made the world fall in love with her in Anne of Green Gables.\n\nRead This Book If…\n\n…you enjoy classics and/or young adult fiction.\n\n…you love novels with romantic depictions of nature and rural 19th century life.\n\n…you prefer character-driven books.\n\n…you’re looking for a new audiobook to listen to (keep reading below!).\n\nAudiobook Review\n\nIf you read my recent review of Anne of Green Gables, you already know that I really enjoy Colleen Winton’s talents as a narrator. In Anne of Avonlea, Ms. Winton continues to bring L.M. Montgomery’s beloved characters to life in her own dramatic way. My favorite aspect about this audiobook is Ms. Winton’s portrayal of darling Davy Keith. Davy is without a doubt one of my favorite characters in the Anne of Green Gables series. He is mischievous, adorable, and spunky, and his antics are depicted wonderfully by Colleen Winton. I always smiled when she said Davy’s trademark line, “I want to know!”\n\nI’m really looking forward to listening to Anne of the Island; I’m positive that Colleen Winton will do a fantastic job with the next series of characters we meet!\n\nAbout the Narrator: Colleen is a Vancouver actor, singer, dancer, director and choreographer…and now a narrator.
