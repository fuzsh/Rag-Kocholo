Use it as a gateway to further study!\n\nHere are the table images from the theme revision lesson. You may need to zoom in to see the comments in full.\n\nA Study in Dualism is an article on the NCBI website that explores the themes of the novel in detail. It's an excellent piece of research reading if you're preparing for the whole-text question. Consider some of the author's ideas and explore your own interpretations.\n\nThis is an extremely enlightening and interesting article that explore the themes, characters and settings of the novel from an academic perspective. If you're aiming from Band 5 then you must familiarise yourself with a wider range of academic analyses than those you find on SparkNotes and Shmoop. Taken from The Guardian:\n\nAmong the many screen adaptations of Robert Louis Stevenson's novella \"Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde\" is a seven-minute Tom and Jerry film made by Hanna-Barbera in 1947. Here, a saucer of milk spiked with moth balls and bug powder is enough to transform an ordinary, decent soul - the mouse - into a monster. After a few sips, Jerry swells into supermouse, terrorising Tom, who normally holds the upper paw. At the end of \"Dr Jekyll and Mr Mouse\", Tom tries lapping up the milk - only to be reduced to the size of a fly. The pair exit with Jerry in pursuit, wielding a swatter.\n\nThe same storyline drives another cartoon of the 1940s, \"Mighty Mouse Meets Jekyll and Hyde Cat\", though this time it is the cat who mixes a cocktail in the doctor's laboratory, changing from cute puss into a beast with fangs and fiendish claws. There is a Daffy Duck Jekyll and Hyde, and Bugs Bunny also makes use of it. Back in the human zone, there have been Abbott and Costello and Jerry Lewis versions of Stevenson's novella. In 1925, Stan Laurel starred in Dr Pyckle and Mr Pryde, which competed with When Quackel Did Hyde of 1920. Between 1950 and 1951, Japanese publishers offered readers seven translations to choose from, including one in graphic-novel form.\n\n\"Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde\" belongs to everyone who has ever referred to themselves in the third person, or cursed their own \"split personality\", or praised their \"better nature\". The poet Hugo Williams has compressed the essence into a single line - \"God give me strength to lead a double life\" - a plea to be in two places at once, not necessarily legitimately, without the inconvenience of a guilty conscience. Stevenson's respectable physician Henry Jekyll appears to have had a similar desire, though his appeal was not to the deity but the pharmaceutical cabinet, with disastrous results.\n\n\"Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde\" (the definite article is missing from the original title) was written in about six weeks in the autumn of 1885. It was Stevenson's response to a request from the publisher Charles Longman for a ghost story for the Christmas number of Longman's Magazine, in which he gave readers a taste of his best authors. The legend put about by RLS's stepson Lloyd Osbourne has it that he wrote a draft in three days, after being awakened from a dream, then threw it into the fire when his wife Fanny, Lloyd's mother, complained that he had \"missed the allegory\". After a brief period of reflection, Stevenson wrote it all out again, \"in another three days of feverish industry\".\n\nLloyd was a charming teller of tales about his stepfather, but not a reliable one. Letters make it plain that Stevenson spent at least six weeks on the revision. And even if an early version really was burned - \"imagine my feelings as we saw those precious pages wrinkling and blackening and turning into flames\", Lloyd wrote - there still exist two full drafts of the novella.\n\nFanny, however, was right to stress the importance of the missing element. It clearly is an allegory: in real life, people do not split into separate selves, with different bodily characteristics and ages (Hyde is notably smaller and younger than Jekyll). But an allegory of what? Stevenson's mother Margaret, who lived for three years after the death of her son in Samoa in 1894, was touched to learn that the story had been interpreted by a Church of Scotland minister as a parable on the wages of sin, and preached as a sermon from the pulpit. Stevenson's first biographer, Graham Balfour (1901), tells us that it was also \"made the subject of leading articles in religious newspapers\". Stevenson might have smiled indulgently at his acceptance by the kirk many years after he had fallen out with his father over fundamental religious differences, but he would have disapproved of the simplistic reading of his story as a lesson on the perils of straying from the path of righteousness.\n\nAn equally common Victorian reading of the story was as a moral tale on the horrors of the sexual appetite unleashed. This aspect was emphasised in early theatrical adaptations, of which there were several in the decade after publication (they included Dr Freckle and Mr Snide at Dockstader's Minstrel Hall, New York, in 1887). The most popular was the one starring Richard Mansfield, which was up and running a year after the appearance of the book and continued, on one side of the Atlantic and then the other, into the next century.\n\nIn adapting the novella for the stage, Thomas R Sullivan was obliged to negotiate an inconvenient absence in the original text: it contains no women characters, apart from an anonymous housemaid and a cook. Sullivan therefore presented Mansfield with Agnes Carew as the object of Jekyll's affection - a dramatic invention indeed, since it is her father, Sir Danvers Carew, who is the most prominent victim of Hyde's violence. In a rival production, which opened in London two days after Mansfield's but was closed down by Longman in a dispute over performance rights, love interest was provided by Sybil Howell, the daughter of a clergyman who is himself an adapter's fancy. The script of a 1931 film version, directed by Rouben Mamoulian, had a barmaid called Ivy performing a striptease in front of Jekyll. In an interview reprinted in the invaluable Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde Companion, edited by Harry M Geduld, Mamoulian described the scene, which was cut from the finished movie: \"She keeps throwing away the stockings, the garters, then the brassiere, the panties.\" In Mamoulian's view, the point of the story was that Dr Jekyll \"would like to indulge in all sort of sexual excess and debauchery\". Hyde, his hidden self, was brought into existence to give him licence to do so.\n\nStevenson deplored the attempts to plumb his divided hero's psychology in the various theatrical productions. In a private letter to the editor of the New York Sun in 1887, written from the Adirondacks, where he had gone for the sake of his health, he dismissed Mansfield's portrayal as an offshoot of modern society. Hyde, Stevenson insisted, \"is no more sexual than another\". He was certainly not, \"Great Gods! a mere voluptuary\", though there was \"no harm\" in that. \"But people are so filled full of folly and inverted lust, that they can think of nothing but sexuality.\"\n\nThere are many other allegorical interpretations of the story. Elementary Freudianism sees Jekyll as embodying the ego (rational), Hyde the id (instinctive). Jekyll has been seen as a drunk, a drug addict, a pederast, a closet homosexual. In an excellent introduction to the Edinburgh University Press edition of the novella, Richard Dury ranges over a variety of possible readings, noting that of several \"socially condemned activities\" that Hyde is associated with, \"veiled allusions to homosexuality are particularly frequent\". The double life of Jekyll and Hyde can be seen as parallel to \"the necessarily double life of the Victorian homosexual\". Even though Stevenson may not have intended leaving them, there are suggestive markers throughout the text: the suspected blackmail of Jekyll by his \"young man\", his \"favourite\"; the \"very pretty manner of politeness of Sir Danvers Carew\" when approached in the street - terms that may have denoted forbidden liaisons to a Victorian readership. It happens that the year of composition, 1885, was the year in which an amendment to an act of parliament made homosexual acts between men a criminal offence.\n\nThe most popular allegorical reading in our own day suggests that, although the action is set in Soho, the atmosphere is really that of Edinburgh, capital of Scotland and RLS's birthplace. In this view, the moral focus of the story is the Scottish character, burdened by dual nationality (Scottish and British), caught between two tongues (Scots and English), its instinctive spontaneity repressed by a Calvinistic church - the very church that once came between Stevenson and his father, and caused a split in the family. Edinburgh is a city starkly divided into two: the foggy old town up on the hill, once the site of colourful crimes such as bodysnatching and of public hangings in the Grassmarket; and the splendid New Town to the north, on the other side of the then newly laid railway tracks. In Glasgow, where I grew up, the common perception of Edinburgh was of a cloudy inner life (old town) shielded by a genteel exterior (New Town). It was - how could you avoid saying so? - a Jekyll-and-Hyde sort of place.\n\nThe reclaiming of Stevenson's most famous work as a Scottish fable has a modern feel to it in this era of aspirationally independent Scotland, but it was suggested as early as 1915 by an American, Clayton Hamilton, who believed that the story might be \"conceived as happening among the gloomy doorways and narrow wynds of the Scottish capital\". GK Chesterton went further, stating that \"Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde\", though \"presented as happening in London\", was \"very unmistakably happening in Edinburgh\" - which is plausible, but unmistakably not the case. If Stevenson had wanted to set his story in Edinburgh, rather than the streets of Soho, he could have done so; if he had intended it to be read as a Scottish story, he would have made it one. After all, he had written plenty of others. He had even written an early study of the split personality in the form of a play, Deacon Brodie or the Double Life, in collaboration with his friend WE Henley. It is based on the career of William Brodie, who lived in Edinburgh's old town in the late 18th century, and was one of its more colourful criminals. In Stevenson and Henley's play, Brodie is a respectable cabinet-maker and deacon of the Incorporation of Wrights and Masons by day. At night he dons a mask and burgles the houses of well-to-do Edinburgh citizens. In 1788, the deacon was caught and hanged on a scaffold that had been designed according to his own technical specifications.\n\n​\n\nIt is, of course, possible to think of \"Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde\" as a study of the Scottish character - or of any of the other topics mentioned. All are reasonable suggestions, and most can be supported to some extent by textual evidence. The author himself (not necessarily the most reliable guide) stated that the central problem was Jekyll's hypocrisy. In his letter to the New York Sun on the subject of Mansfield's sexual interpretation, he wrote that it was Jekyll's \"selfishness and cowardice\" that had let out the beast Hyde, \"not this poor wish to have a woman\".\n\nAbove all, however, Stevenson was against simplicity. He might have agreed with Fanny that his original attempt had \"missed the allegory\", but he did not wish to have the allegory rigidly defined. \"Everything is true,\" he told Sidney Colvin, \"only the opposite is true too; you must believe both equally or be damned.\" Jekyll is a true type, but no more so than Hyde; truer than either is Jekyll-and-Hyde, that combination we all recognise. As Stevenson's friend the poet and folklorist Andrew Lang recalled: \"He told me once he meant to write a story about a fellow who was two fellows, which did not, when thus stated, seem a fortunate idea.\" They are often the best ones.\n\n​\n\n• Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde, directed by Rouben Mamoulian, is at the BFI, London SE1 until December 30. Box office: 020 7928 3232.\n\nThis is important. Taken from an article at www.tor.com:\n\n​And when I say everybody, I mean everybody. Not just most people today don’t understand the original story—though that’s true—but every retelling of the story, from the earliest stage plays to Steven Moffat’s otherwise brilliant miniseries Jekyll, misses a key point of Robert Louis Stevenson’s original story:\n\nThere is no Mr. Hyde.\n\nEdward Hyde is not a separate personality living in the same body as Henry Jekyll. “Hyde” is just Jekyll, having transformed his body into something unrecognizable, acting on unspecified urges that would be unseemly for someone of his age and social standing in Victorian London (i.e. some combination of violence and sex. Torture is specifically mentioned).\n\nJekyll did not create a potion to remove the evil parts of his nature. He made a potion that allowed him express his urges without feeling guilty and without any consequences besmirching his good name. That’s also why he names his alter ego “Hyde,” because Hyde is a disguise, to be worn and discarded like a thick cloak. He might as well have called Edward “Mr. Second Skin,” or “Mr. Mask.”\n\nIt’s important that it’s Doctor Jekyll and Mister Hyde. Jekyll is a respected professor. Hyde is a lower class schlub. Hyde is also much younger than Jekyll. Both of these facts allow Jekyll as Hyde to get away with a lot worse behavior.\n\nCrucially, we never get Hyde’s point of view. Because it does not exist. Even when he looks like Hyde, Jekyll always thinks of himself as Jekyll. In his testament that ends The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, Jekyll always talks about his time in Hyde’s body using “I” statements: I looked in the mirror and saw Hyde, the pleasures I sought in my disguise, I awoke to see I had the hand of Hyde. Even when describing the murder of Sir Danvers, the worst thing he ever does as Hyde, Jekyll says “I mauled the unresisting body” and then, “I saw my life to be forfeit.” That is, he both takes responsibility for the murder (and the pleasure it brought him) and has a very Jekyll-like fear of losing the good life he has. He is always Jekyll, no matter what he looks like, or how he’s behaving.\n\nOne source of the misinterpretation of the story is that Jekyll himself refers to Hyde as a separate person, an other, one who has desires and cares completely separate from Jekyll’s. Jekyll claims that while he may want to commit the sins of Hyde, Hyde doesn’t care about the friends, respect, wealth, or love that Jekyll needs.\n\nBut Jekyll’s an extremely unreliable narrator in this respect, because his own account belies this conclusion. Not just specifically when recounting the times that he was disguised as Hyde and he still refers to himself as Jekyll, but because “Henry Jekyll’s Full Statement of the Case” is written by Jekyll when he’s stuck in the body of Hyde. If there were ever a time for Hyde to exert himself, talk about himself as an autonomous being, it would be then. But he does not. Because he can’t. Because he does not exist.\n\nThe fundamental mistake most versions of Jekyll and Hyde make is not understanding that Jekyll wants to do all the things he does as Hyde. He loves being Hyde. He revels in the freedom of being Hyde and it’s only when the consequences catch up to him anyway that his duel personality becomes a problem for him.\n\nThis fundamental mistake leads to further misunderstandings. First, Jekyll is not good. He’s not bad, either, so much as Jekyll is a deeply repressed man who has hidden his violent and sexual urges. His biggest sin is that he wants to face no consequences for anything he does.\n\nSecond, Hyde is not the accidental result of an unrelated experiment. Hyde is the absolutely intended result of Jekyll’s experiment. Hyde is not Jekyll’s punishment for playing God. Hyde is Jekyll’s reward.\n\n​\n\nThird, Jekyll is not unaware or out of control when he’s Hyde. He does not wake up with no memory of what happened the night before. He remembers perfectly everything he does as Hyde, because he was in control the whole time.\n\nAnd finally, Hyde is not a monster. He’s not the grotesque pink giant Hulk of League of Extraordinary Gentlemen or the super-fast, super-strong, super- handsome superhuman of Jekyll. He’s a nasty, brutish, and short ape-like man whose great advantage over Jekyll is that he’s young and seemingly lower class, and therefore can get away with a lot of things.\n\nObviously, this rant is one hundred years too late to change the popular perception of this classic of horror. To most people, Jekyll and Hyde is the story of two completely separate personalities, one good and one evil, that share a body and are at war with each other, and that’s not going to change.\n\nThat said, I think the original is a much more complicated take on the nature of evil, society, shame, and repression than any that have followed it, and I’d love to see a version that really explored the appeal of Hyde to Jekyll. What would you do if you could be someone else for a night, do whatever you wanted to do, commit whatever sins you wanted to commit, without fear of consequences of any kind? Are we good because we want to be good, or are we good because we just don’t want to be punished?\n\nThe idea of evil as “that guy, over there, who takes over my body sometimes against my will” is too simple, and dissociative, and irresponsible. It’s the mistake Jekyll himself makes. Hyde is not someone else who commits Jekyll’s sins for him. Hyde does not exist. Jekyll commits all of his sins on his own.\n\nSteven Padnick is a freelance writer and editor. By day. You can find more of his writing and funny pictures at padnick.tumblr.com.\n\nThere has been some fervent discussion (and an argument!) about Hyde's living arrangements in the novel. Of course, Hyde's only real place of abode is inside Jekyll's head - for he is not a person, as many assume - he is Jekyll himself - though when Jekyll is in Hyde form, he does indeed tend to 'live' in Jekyll's laboratory, behind the 'red baize door' (symbolism alert!).\n\nHowever, there is a small frame of time around the Carew murder where 'Hyde' takes on a different apartment in a shady area of Soho - this is where Utterson finds the broken cane and so is where he begins to make links between Hyde and the murders that have taken place. The apartment is described as dull and dank - not a place resplendent in luxury, as Jekyll is accustomed to.\n\n​ As the cab drew up before the address indicated, the fog lifted a little and showed him a dingy street, a gin palace, a low French eating-house, a shop for the retail of penny numbers and twopenny salads, many ragged children huddled in the doorways, and many women of different nationalities passing out, key in hand, to have a morning glass; and the next moment the fog settled down again upon that part, as brown as umber, and cut him off from his blackguardly surroundings. This was the home of Henry Jekyll’s favourite; of a man who was heir to a quarter of a million sterling.\n\n​This apartment dwelling could symbolise Hyde's role in Jekyll's life. When Hyde begins to commit violent acts like murder, Jekyll almost 'removes' him by placing him in a different location, a place where he occasionally visits when in Hyde form. He is almost in denial, treating Hyde as a different person rather than simply him in another form. It could well be that Jekyll is trying to separate his evil side from the life he knows and loves by placing it in a separate location altogether. However, after the Carew murder, Hyde returns to Jekyll's quarters and 'lives' in the laboratory, which is connected to the house by a secret walkway. This symbolises the closing gap between Jekyll's good side and his evil 'Hyde' persona.\n\nThe British Library often features interesting explorations into a range of novels from throughout history.
