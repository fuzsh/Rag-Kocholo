        "text": "This short book is the well-known story of Dr. Jeykell and his vile alter ego, Mr. Hyde. The book follows John Utterson who, while out one night, witnesses Mr. Hyde trample a girl in the street. His indignation persuades him to seek out the identity of this wicked man. Utterson struggles to locate Mr. Hyde but he does connect with Dr. Jekyll. Upon their meeting, Uterson discovers that Dr. Jeykell has written his will completely in Hyde’s favor. Utterson pursues this oddity while Jekyll handles the relationship with his dangerous persona. By the story's end, the two egos wrestle to exasperation and the serum that had enabled Dr. Jeykell to switch between Hyde and Jekyll runs dry. The doctor comes to the grim realization that his Hyde ego is permanent. Completely distraught, he chooses to drink a vial of poison, ending both of their lives.\n\nWhile the mystery, intrigue, and gothic themes add to the story’s charm, author Robert Louis Stevenson conveys a larger message - The duality of man. This idea suggests that everyone has both virtuous and nefarious qualities and how the latter can often be a challenge to suppress, even if we feel generally righteous. In the final chapter, Dr. Jekyll reflects on his relationship with Hyde, “I was in no sense a hypocrite; both sides of me were in dead earnest; I was no more myself when I laid aside restraint and plunged in shame, then when I labored, in the eye of day.\" The key phrase to take away from his reflection is, “both sides of me were in dead earnest” I believe it is low hanging fruit to simply state that there is good and bad in everyone; if we deepen the idea, we can appropriately evolve it, and a more substantial idea emerges. It is that our behavior is not a wave of mistakes and triumphs but rather, being both a good person and a bad one is entirely foundational to the human condition. Realizing this, Jekyll compares his discontent to a shipwreck, “I have been doomed to such a dreadful shipwreck: that man is not truly one, but truly two.\" It creates within each of us a psychological agony that disrupts our core tenant of a singular and secure identity. All in all, Dr. Jekyll fought a battle with Dr. Jekyll, not with Mr. Hyde. He toiled desperately to justify his identity of a well-attuned man to himself, all while hopelessly fending off his nefarious convictions.\n\n“I learned to recognise the thorough and primitive duality of man; I saw that, of the two natures that contended in the field of my consciousness, even if I could rightly be said to be either, it was only because I was radically both.”"
