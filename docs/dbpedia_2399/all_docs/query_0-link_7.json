        "text": "Hi @Gijs\n\nIn GumballAutoReset doesn't work you looked at a problem with me about the Gumbal AutoReset. I thought the Gumbal AutoReset was the problem but im not so sure anymore, because I’m still experiencing the problem.\n\nMy problem is that blocks in my file get there gumbal placement misplaced. This happens randomly. Could be at a block is fine one moment, work some more come back to that block and its misplaced.\n\nIn the image you see a fairly simpel block where Rhino suggests that the gumbal is above it. But in fact there is nothing there, call it a ghost. This block was exported to new Rhino and still its misplaced.\n\nIve scaled that block like a million times bigger because the gumball is over 200.000mm away.\n\nIf you run GumballReset it go’s back to its origin.\n\nI’m really not sure what is causing this misplacement, not sure if its something is that I do or just Rhino8 bug.\n\nGumball placement wrong.3dm (386.4 KB)\n\nSystemInfo\n\nRhino 8 SR8 2024-5-14 (Rhino 8, 8.8.24135.14001, Git hash:master @ 8c191427bc5c6c4e62f523a752d809f68897c3a5)\n\nLicense type: Commercial, build 2024-05-14\n\nLicense details: Cloud Zoo\n\nWindows 10 (10.0.19045 SR0.0) or greater (Physical RAM: 32GB)\n\n.NET 7.0.0\n\nComputer platform: DESKTOP\n\nStandard graphics configuration.\n\nPrimary display and OpenGL: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2060 SUPER (NVidia) Memory: 8GB, Driver date: 3-8-2023 (M-D-Y).

I have seen it on my home and work pc, and in every file I work on. big blocks, small blocks, linked blocks, embedded blocks.\n\nI’ve had case that I reset-ed the gumball, exited the parent block, opened/blockedited the parent block again and it was moved again.\n\nIt wasn’t in Rhino 7, and I have been using the _GumballAlignment since RH6 already. I’m not sure anymore if it was in the first release of RH8 of that it came with a later release.\n\nTo me it really seems like a Rhino8 problem but I just don’t know what specifically is causing it.\n\nThanks for staying with me and reporting this stuff. All these files show the same thing which is a saved gumball orientation in the user data already that’s being used. How it’s getting to the wrong spot in the first place is the question. If you can give me the step-by-step of what exactly you do leading up the orientation going wrong it would help immensely. I understand this can be tricky since it seems random. So far while investigating this I’ve dug up RH-82058 where scaling isn’t being applied to the saved orientation for block instances on import when unit systems vary.\n\nI think this is the crux of the problem.\n\nThis behaviour is different in RH8 vs RH7 and this give a lot of problems. I still don’t know why my gumballs are so much displaced but if there were to be reset every time you click the object it solves everything.\n\nI’m not sure how this will work with the new function where you deliberately move to gumball to a new position (using the double click), but I’m sure McNeel can think of a solution for this.\n\n@Joshua_Kennedy, @Gijs, would love to hear your input on this."
