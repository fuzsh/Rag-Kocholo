        "text": "‘Ik zie geen kleur.’ Ontwerp van een didactiek voor representatie-analyse van teksten bij Nederlands\n\nS. (Sarah) Badwy, Christelijk Lyceum Zandvliet – Tilburg University\n\nBrands are increasingly expressing themselves on sociopolitical issues to showcase their human side. This can have a positive impact by encouraging consumers to engage with specific issues, but it comes with risks. Buying from a \"social\" brand can sometimes serve as a barrier to behavioral change. This research builds upon the Theory of Mind to understand the effect brand activism on different forms of consumer empowerment and the role of humanity. Consequently, this proposal investigates how and under what circumstances brand activism contributes to consumer commitment to certain social-political issues, and how the brand can have a positive impact on society.\n\nWhat works for workplace well-being? Towards a deeper understanding of the role and development of employees’ personal resources in Dutch non-governmental organizations\n\nL.I.S.A. (Lisanne) van den Berg, University of Applied Sciences Amsterdam – Utrecht University\n\nHealth professionals do not always talk (timely) about end-of-life wishes and care preferences with home-dwelling older people and their relatives (advanced care planning). Even where articulated, wishes and preferences are regularly inaccessible to other health professionals. This hinders the provision of care based on these wishes and may lead to unwanted burdensome treatments and hospital admissions, effecting quality of life and quality of dying. This research proposal aims to improve care to home-dwelling older people through developing, implementing and evaluating a transmural care pathway advanced care planning including specific attention to its implementation in community nursing teams and involving relatives.\n\nBlind Navigeren op Navigatieberichten: Verbale navigatieberichten voor mensen met een visuele beperking bij het navigeren op onbekende routes\n\nJ.H.F. (Joey) van der Bie, University of Applied Sciences Amsterdam – Utrecht University\n\nPeople with visual impairments face challenges in navigating because visual information of the surroundings is not accessible. Technological aids as navigation applications fall short in addressing this issue, they primarily rely on visual cues and provide limited environmental information in navigation messages. This research investigates how essential information can effectively be conveyed through navigation messages, constructed by artificial intelligence.\n\nThe information requirements for unfamiliar routes will be analysed and integrated into a practical model for navigation instructions. The model will be assessed through experimental behavioural studies and a situated context study, wherein participants will navigate using verbal navigation instructions.\n\nPublieke Betrokkenheid Duiden en Versterken in Praktijkgericht Onderzoek op Hogescholen: een Middel tot Valorisatie\n\nK.T. (Kiran) van den Brande, Aeres Group – Open University\n\nPublic Engagement (PE) is an outcome and a dialogical process between science and society. It is crucial that the public is engaged in science. This research, focused on universities of applied sciences, enhances PE in practice-based research. We develop a model, based on the ideas of political philosopher Hannah Arendt, grounded in literature review, a questionnaire study, and a design study. The model is practically applied to improve PE. This process involves translating theoretical principles into practical methods and testing these methods in real-life situations. The goal is to make practice-oriented research even more accessible and applicable to everyone.\n\nDe framing van een systeemtechnologie – Narratieven en verbeeldingen over kunstmatige intelligentie in Nederlandse journalistieke media\n\nJ. (Jessy) de Cooker, Fontys University of Applied Sciences – Utrecht University\n\nThis study examines perceptions of artificial intelligence (AI) in the Netherlands in five major Dutch newspapers from 1950 onwards. It analyses how media present and conceptualise AI, identifies dominant topics and journalistic frames, reveals expert influences, and examines the possible impact on policy papers on AI. The results of this study indicate which dominant topics and journalistic frames are present in coverage of AI, how main features of this technology are framed, which experts dominate AI media discourse, how journalists think to balance their coverage, and how narratives in journalistic coverage may recur in Dutch policy documents on AI.\n\nHelpful or Hostile? A phenomenological and ethical analysis of surveillance in the educational digital ecosystem.\n\nR. (Rik) van Eijk, University of Applied Sciences Amsterdam – Technical University Delft\n\nAs a teacher I see that digital educational technology (edtech) is changing my classroom: physical interactions between students and teachers are increasingly augmented with and shaped by (commercial) edtech. This dissertation project researches visible and invisible forms of student-surveillance by edtech in the educational digital ecosystem by using niche-construction theory (NCT) to understand how students shape, but also are being shaped, by the digital ecosystem they live and learn in. Its aim is to ask and answer questions about the normalization of (digital-)surveillance in education and to offer future-directed design recommendations for a more responsible use of edtech.\n\nRegaining balance in life – Exploring preferences and needs in transitioning follow-up care for chronic cancer patients to nurse practitioners in primary care\n\nS.H. (Sandrien) van Geel-Weda, University of Applied Sciences Utrecht – University of Utrecht\n\nAs cancer diagnoses increase and cancer treatments improve, more people live long-term with cancer. As a result, cancer is increasingly becoming a chronic disease that requires appropriate follow-up care to ensure it fits patients’ needs. Current follow-up care cannot meet the growing demand for chronic cancer care, partly due to personnel shortages and rising healthcare costs. The reorganisation of follow-up care for chronic cancer patients is necessary to maintain the accessibility of care. This study explores preferences and needs of chronic cancer patients, involved close ones and healthcare providers in transitioning follow-up care to Nurse Practitioners in primary care.\n\nBetekenisvol grammatica onderwijzen op de basisschool.\n\nL.W.J. (Leonie) Goutier, Fontys University of Applied Sciences – University of Utrecht\n\nAlthough grammatical knowledge is considered crucial for students in first language education, there has been little research on the best way to teach grammar, especially in primary education. Recent empirical research has shown that grammar instruction in secondary education can be more meaningful when school grammar is enriched with linguistic metaconcepts. However, it is not yet known whether, and under what circumstances, this metaconceptual approach can also be effectively implemented in primary education. In this project, we investigate this gap, considering both the perspective of primary school students and that of teacher training students.\n\nBetekenisvolle zorg (BETerZO): Van verpleegkundige registratielast naar optimalisatie van gepersonaliseerde zorg middels beslisondersteuning.\n\nH.I. (Helen) de Graaf-Waar, Rotterdam University of Applied Sciences – Erasmus UMC\n\nIndividuals with cancer follow intensive treatment with implications for their physical and psychosocial health. The rich dialogue between these individuals and nurses is essential to establish a person-centered care plan. However, important psychosocial aspects are often not included in the care plan, partly due to workload and registration burden. Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications offer solutions for (digital) decision support, if developed with end users in their context, to promote adoption in practice. This research project develops and validates intended AI applications in a learning community of nurses working with people with cancer, assisted by teachers, students and information technologists.\n\nOptimizing Robot Tutors for Underperforming Children in Arithmetic Education\n\nV.L.N.F. (Veerle) Hobbelink, University of Applied Sciences Utrecht – Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam\n\nIn the Netherlands, primary education grapples with a severe shortage of educators, especially in diverse pupil populations, coinciding with a rise in children leaving school with deficient arithmetic skills. Together with attention deficits, this predicts lower educational achievement. Traditional teaching methods often fall short, necessitating innovative solutions. Social robots, with their tailored one-to-one tutoring and adaptability, offer a promising approach. Whereas studies indicate positive outcomes, the interplay of individual differences and diverse behavioural styles of robots remains understudied. This proposed PhD research aims to fill this gap, offering insights into personalized and sustained interventions through social robots in primary education.\n\nThe role of law in megafauna reintroduction and human-wildlife coexistence in the Netherlands.\n\nB.M.M. (Bram) Janssens, University of Applied Sciences Legal College Avans-Fontys – Tilburg University\n\nRestoration of ecosystems and biodiversity has become a global necessity. Research shows the reintroduction of megafauna to ecosystems can strongly contribute to such restoration and biodiversity recovery. The return of megafauna to the densely populated Netherlands however raises questions for wildlife management and provides for human-wildlife conflict (HWC). This research is aimed at answering the question of what the role of law and the Dutch legal framework is in the reintroduction of megafauna and HWC and what its role could be in solving, mitigating or preventing HWC and achieving sustainable human-wildlife coexistence.\n\nCAPTURE-CR: Comprehensive Assessment of PrognosTic factors, Using quantitative sensory testing and inflammatory markers for Recovery Evaluation in painful Cervical Radiculopathy\n\nS.C. (Sjoerd) Kielstra, Hanze University of Applied Sciences Groningen – Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam\n\nPainful cervical radiculopathy is a nerve root disorder in the neck, often causing severe symptoms and functional limitations. Some patients develop a chronic condition, but the factors contributing to this are unclear. Quantitative Sensory Testing has been developed to explore pain and sensory function. This project investigates the association between Quantitative Sensory Testing and recovery in patients with painful cervical radiculopathy. Additionally, it explores the relationship between Quantitative Sensory Testing and the distribution of radiating pain and tingling. Finally, we will develop a machine learning-based prediction model for recovery based on biopsychosocial factors, including Quantitative Sensory Testing and inflammatory markers.\n\nVerstand van verband. Naar een effectieve methode meervoudig tekstbegrip voor diep lezen.\n\nJ.E. (Juul) Klein Wolterink, Stichting Spinoza Lyceum– Utrecht University\n\nThis project aims to design and test an effective method for teaching multiple text comprehension in secondary education. Multiple text comprehension is defined as the ability to create a mental model of information from multiple texts. It is a prerequisite for ‘deep reading’, a skill which many 15-year-old Dutch students lack (PISA-research 2018; 2023). The demand for a new teaching method is urgent, as the frameworks for the final exams will be revised in the coming years, and will include the assessment of multiple text comprehension.\n\nOntrafelen van good VIBES [Unravelling good VIBES]\n\nT. (Tim) van de Laak, Fontys University of Applied Sciences – UMC Groningen\n\nPrevocational students have high levels of physical inactivity which is associated with a wide range of (health-related) risks. Unravelling good VIBES focuses on understanding and interpreting physical activity (PA) and contextual factors among prevocational students in the Netherlands. In four sub-studies in-depth research is proposed on innovative PA interventions in prevocational education to gain insight in the working mechanisms and conditions needed for successful development and implementation of PA interventions and how these interventions can contribute to sustainable PA promotion. This study aims to contribute to concisely targeted PA interventions and reducing inequality of opportunities in society.\n\nPrescribed literature: the contents of and approaches to English literature in Dutch textbooks for havo/vwo students (1985-2020)\n\nV.P.H. (Valerie) Meessen, Raayland College Venray – University of Leiden\n\nLiterature is a mandatory component in the exam curriculum of teaching English at havo/vwo level. However, the curriculum does not list specific works. The current concerns about reading apathy have resulted in a growing interest in the selection of and approach to literary works used in the classroom. One factor seems to be neglected in this discussion: the role that educational publishing companies play by their endorsement of certain literature, which influences teachers. This project studies changes in the selection of and approach to English literature in literary textbooks from 1985-2020, and makes recommendations for future literary education.\n\nFrom carpenter or nurse to teacher: Exploring the professional identity development of VET second career teachers during their alternative certification programme.\n\nA.H. (Alice) Middelkoop, Hoornbeeck College Rotterdam – Wageningen University & Research\n\nDutch VET faces teacher shortages and a relatively high attrition rate among second career teachers (SCTs). This project examines SCTs' transition into teaching through an Alternative Certification Programme (ACP) using the lens of professional identity (PI) development. The project aims to understand the development of VET SCTs' teacher identity during ACP, considering personal and prior professional identities, and other factors that facilitate or hinder identity development. Findings will inform teacher education programs in how to enhance PI development. That is, PI development significantly contributes to teacher retention in education.\n\nKundig in taal. Een onderzoek naar de taalkundige ontwikkeling van havo- en vwo-leerlingen in het voortgezet onderwijs.\n\nM. (Mo) van der Schoot, Koninklijke Scholengemeenschap – University of Utrecht\n\nIn an international context, L1-education is looking for ways to include linguistics in the curriculum. In the national curriculum revision, linguistic knowledge is given considerably more space, because of which teachers will be in need of tools for instructing linguistics in a differentiated manner. This project aims to (a) create a development model to distinguish different levels of linguistic competence for secondary education and (b) develop a measuring instrument to determine the current linguistic competence level of students. To identify this linguistic competence, this research builds on empirical research previously undertaken into reflective thinking, linguistic (meta)concepts and linguistic reasoning.\n\nVakgeïntegreerd schrijfonderwijs in het hoger beroepsonderwijs\n\nS. (Suzanne) van Stratum, University of Applied Sciences Amsterdam – University of Amsterdam\n\nHigher vocational education is struggling with students' poor writing skills. This hinders their study outcomes, and their skills fall short of employers’ expectations. Isolated language lessons are not enough, because higher-order aspects of writing skills are developed within subject lessons. An approach, ‘taalontwikkelend lesgeven’ (TOL; ‘language-sensitive teaching’), in which teachers combine content with language awareness, shows effectiveness. This design-based research investigates what teachers need to apply TOL. The aim is to develop a professionalization program that helps teachers to apply TOL in their own education. The ultimate goal is to promote students' writing skills.\n\nAnti-institutioneel complotdenken in Nederland\n\nR. (Renze) Tjoelker, Saxion University of Applied Sciences – Twente University\n\nAnti-institutional conspiracy thinking mainly has negative outcomes and poses a threat to democracy. Research is characterized by conceptual and methodological limitations that hinder scientific progress. Based on a systematic literature review, a longitudinal survey study and interviews, the PhD research establishes a conceptual definition and promotes in-depth knowledge about factors that contribute to anti-institutional conspiracy thinking. Results serve practice and education in the safety domain. It contributes to knowledge for designing or evaluating policy and designing interventions aimed at the factors that contribute to anti-institutional conspiracy thinking.\n\nLees de les: Een onderzoek naar metafoorvaardigheden van zwakke lezers in het basisonderwijs.\n\nR. (Roel) Verloop, Driestar Unversity of Applied Sciences – Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam\n\nMetaphors are used to enhance the comprehensibility of educational texts. However, for poor readers, metaphors result in reduced reading comprehension. In this project, 1) we analyse how metaphors are used in educational texts and 2) we explore which problems poor readers encounter when they have to process these metaphors and which metaphorical competencies they need to develop. The ultimate goal is 3) to develop an intervention focused on developing metaphorical competencies in order to improve reading comprehension of educational texts.\n\nTransformatie van toetsculturen in het hoger onderwijs: denken en doen van docenten.\n\nM. (Martijn) Vlug, University of Applied Sciences Utrecht – Utrecht University\n\nMany higher education programmes search for new assessment systems to promote more meaningful learning and assessment. They move away from assessment designs with a slew of pass/fail assessments. However, this not only requires newly designed assessment systems, but a transformation of assessment culture, and teachers need to adjust their familiar beliefs and practices. How these beliefs and practices change and what factors facilitate or hinder this is still unknown. Observations and interviews are used to understand how teachers’ beliefs and practices regarding programmatic assessment in higher education change and which factors play a role in this transformation.\n\n“Ability is nothing without opportunity”: Implementing the policy of ability grouping in Dutch primary education.\n\nA. (Annefleur) Vogelaar, Onze Wijs – Utrecht University\n\nThe political-educational agenda is nowadays increasingly focusing on the capacity to organize primary education differently. The trend to pursue ability grouping as a school policy is expanding despite insufficient knowledge about this theme in primary education. This research aims at determining the effects of ability grouping as a school policy together with pupils, educational professionals, and school leaders. In addition, preconditions for establishing ability grouping will be identified that will enable primary schools to effectively implement school policies around ability grouping.\n\nA Neorepublican Perspective on Automated Decision‐making\n\nH. (Hans) de Zwart, University of Applied Sciences Amsterdam – Radboud University Nijmegen\n\nThe topic of this proposed PhD research is the legitimacy of machine learning-based profiling in institutional decision-making. Grounded in a neorepublican framework, it scrutinizes when profiling raises political or moral concerns, compares traditional and machine learning-based approaches, conducts empirical case studies in different institutional domains, and proposes policy recommendations. The study contributes to and extends the neorepublican thinking on profiling in relationship to nondomination and abuse of power and deepens the debate on fairness in machine learning. After theoretical and empirical analysis, it aims to furnish practical tools to guide the implementation of automated decision-making.\n\nHet merk als activist: hoe menselijke merken consumenten kunnen betrekken bij sociale verandering\n\nN. (Nelleke) de Boer, Rotterdam University of Applied Sciences – VU Amsterdam\n\nBrands are increasingly expressing themselves on sociopolitical issues to showcase their human side. This can have a positive impact by encouraging consumers to engage with specific issues, but it comes with risks. Buying from a \"social\" brand can sometimes serve as a barrier to behavioral change. This research builds upon the Theory of Mind to understand the effect brand activism on different forms of consumer empowerment and the role of humanity. Consequently, this proposal investigates how and under what circumstances brand activism contributes to consumer commitment to certain social-political issues, and how the brand can have a positive impact on society.\n\nNaar proactieve zorgplanning bij ouderen met thuiszorg: Ontwikkeling, implementatie en evaluatie van een transmuraal zorgpad\n\nA.A.E. (Annigje) Bos, University of Applied Sciences Amsterdam – University of Amsterdam\n\nHealth professionals do not always talk (timely) about end-of-life wishes and care preferences with home-dwelling older people and their relatives (advanced care planning). Even where articulated, wishes and preferences are regularly inaccessible to other health professionals. This hinders the provision of care based on these wishes and may lead to unwanted burdensome treatments and hospital admissions, effecting quality of life and quality of dying. This research proposal aims to improve care to home-dwelling older people through developing, implementing and evaluating a transmural care pathway advanced care planning including specific attention to its implementation in community nursing teams and involving relatives.\n\nCONNECT-AYA: Ondersteuning van jongvolwassenen met kanker (AYA’s) bij participatie in opleiding en transitie naar werk.\n\nA.W. (Anke) Boumans, University of Applied Sciences Amsterdam – Amsterdam UMC\n\nAdolescents and young adults diagnosed with cancer (AYAs) lack support when they are hindered in participation in education or hindered while entering the workforce. This PhD research aims to develop an educational and career support program in healthcare and/or education that contributes to participation in education or entering the workforce of AYAs diagnosed during their study. Literature research of existing interventions and empirical research on facilitating and hindering factors for participation and support from different perspectives (AYA’s, healthcare professionals, educational professionals and employers) provide knowledge to develop and evaluate a tailored, evidence-based support program in co-creation with AYAs and stakeholders.\n\nInzicht in de effectiviteit en bruikbaarheid van e-consulten in de jeugdgezondheidszorg\n\nA.R. (Arina) Brunekreeft-Budding, Ede Christian University of Applied Sciences – University of Twente\n\nE-consultations can help keep healthcare available to everyone. Nurses have questions about e-consultations. Does it work? What do clients find pleasant or unpleasant when they use e-consultations? Which clients and nurses use e-consultations? How do e-consultations affect the relationship between nurses and clients? We use questionnaires to investigate three things.\n\nWhether e-consultations work\n\nWhat nurses and clients think about e-consultations\n\nWho use e-consultations\n\nWe ask questions about how e-consultations affect the relationship between nurses and clients, during interviews with nurses. We want to help organizations and researchers decide and develop e-consultations in healthcare.\n\nVirtual reality in shoulder rehabilitation (VRISseR study)\n\nB. (Beate) Dejaco, HAN University of Applied Sciences – Radboud University Medical Centre\n\nShoulder pain is common and associated with significant morbidity. Current treatment includes different modalities, however, with equivocal results. Exercise therapy appears to be effective, however, adherence to exercise programs is moderate. Research suggests that Virtual Reality (VR) is pain-reducing, can increase exercise adherence and may be a good addition or alternative to current treatments. The primary aim of this project is to investigate the effectiveness of VR in treating patients with shoulder pain. The secondary aim is to investigate the feasibility and acceptability of using VR for clinicians and patients.\n\nLiterary Tourism at the Peripheries: A Relational Analysis of the Hay Festival in Rural Wales and in the ‘Global South’\n\nC.J. (Calvin) Duggan, Hotelschool The Hague – University of Amsterdam\n\nThis project investigates contemporary literary tourism through an in-depth relational analysis of different international editions of the Hay Festival of Literature. Tracing the Festival’s trajectory from rural Wales to the ‘Global South,’ this project considers tourism and literature as related modes of circulation through which places and people find meaning. Combining interviews, archival research and primary sources, this project incorporates posthumanist relational thinking to interrogate the entangled relations between the places and people that make up the Festival. In doing so, this project aims to uncover any latent inequalities and colonial logics that continue to permeate literature and tourism.\n\nBias is in the eye of the beholder? How mansplaining can help us better understand miscommunication and the factors affecting the perception of bias\n\nA.F.L. (Astrid) Fokkema, Fontys University of Applied Sciences – Tilburg University\n\nIn recent years the explanation has become an increasingly contentious conversational act. Mansplaining, whitesplaining and momsplaining, used to define an explanation as insulting and to accuse the explainer of being biased, have entered popular vocabulary. What do these words tells us about what we expect in a conversation? When does explaining become 'mansplaining'? And what factors affect the perception of an explanation as insulting? This project researches these forms of miscommunication and sheds new light on the perception of bias.\n\nResisting unsustainable temptations: Are countercampaigns effective in cancelling out the effects of advertising?\n\nJ. (Joris) Galama, NHL Stenden University of Applied Sciences – University of Amsterdam\n\nConsumers are constantly exposed to tempting advertisements and commercials that stimulate unstainable choices, which is at odds with the government’s goal to stimulate sustainable behavior. Currently, various strategies are considered to make consumers more resistant to such advertisements (e.g. adding disclaimers to advertisements or adding advertisements from awareness campaigns to commercial breaks). It is unclear whether such countercampaigns are sufficient to counteract the influence of advertisements. In this proposed PhD-project I will investigate if people pay attention and are able to remember countercampaigns, and lastly how to make consumers with a high carbon footprint more receptive to information from countercampaigns.\n\nUnderstanding Software: Towards an Analytic Ontology of Computational Artefacts\n\nJ.A.H. (Jeroen) de Haas, Avans University of Applied Sciences – Eindhoven University of Technology\n\nSociety is digitizing at an incredible pace. The impact of failing software on society grows accordingly. But what is software? What is its function? Can it fail? Governments, scholars and engineers have difficulty articulating such questions and their answers. For material artefacts — human-made objects— there exist ontologies that prescribe how to reason about their function and malfunction. Initial attempts to translate these analyses to software lead to counter-intuitive or contradictory conclusions. In this research, we uncover these problems to then construct an ontology that better aligns with reality and thus provides a solid foundation for scientific and societal debates.\n\nHistorische teksten in de bovenbouw van het primair onderwijs. De stimulering van bewuste geletterdheid, historische kennis en burgerschapsvorming door literatuurhistorisch redeneren in het primair onderwijs.\n\nP. (Pim) van der Helm, Thomas More Hogeschool – Tilburg University\n\nLiteraturehistorical reasoning based on historical texts may help children in primary school in different ways. This method deals with problems concerning decreasing reading motivation and results, inadequate historical awareness and a lack of knowledge of citizenship skills. Literaturehistorical reasoning contributes to conscious literacy and historical consciousness and may have a positive impact on what is called 'burgerschapsvorming'. The intended result is a series of lessons based on relevant literature and on empirically proven design principles.\n\nDe weerbaarheid van startende jeugdprofessionals versterken door zingeving in werk: een onderwijsinterventie\n\nS. (Sterre) Hoenderop, HZ University of Applied Sciences – University of Humanistic Studies\n\nIn this mixed-methods research is studied how meaning in work influences youth healthcare students’ and starting professionals’ resilience, and how that can be promoted by an educational intervention. The first study comprises a scoping review on the relationship between resilience and meaningful work in youth healthcare. In the second study, the experience of resilience and meaningful work by youth healthcare students and professionals is investigated. In the third study, an educational intervention will be developed through participatory design-based research, based on the first two studies. During the fourth study, the impact of the educational intervention will be assessed.\n\nBiodiversiteit in de gebouwde omgeving; verspreidingsmodellering van stadssoorten ten behoeve van ecologisch ontwerpen.\n\nB.B. (Berry) van der Hoorn, Inholland University of Applied Sciences Delft – Naturalis Biodiversity Center\n\nIn 2050, an estimated 68% of the world population is living in cities. Urbanisation leads to homogenization and loss of biodiversity. In recent years, there has been a shift towards nature-inclusive (re)design of cities focussing on green-blue infrastructures and biodiversity. Ecological urban design benefits from knowledge of the habitat requirements or niche of urban target species. Statistical analyses such as distribution modelling using artificial intelligence can provide this knowledge. However, this has not been widely used in cities yet. In this study, we develop new statistical models to analyse the urban distribution of bats, bees and grasshoppers.\n\nBegrijpen werknemers wat er staat? Een empirisch onderzoek naar de verbetering van de begrijpelijkheid van de arbeidsovereenkomst.\n\nH. (Hanneke) Houwers, HAN University of Applied Sciences – Utrecht University\n\nThe employment contract contains the most important rights and obligations that apply to employees, but is often worded in complicated terms, so that the non-lawyer does not fully understand what it actually says. This can have unwanted consequences, such as wrongful dismissal during the probationary period or missing out on severance pay. It is therefore important to examine what makes the employment contract so complicated, whether there are methods to achieve greater comprehensibility, and to examine whether comprehensibility should be included as a standard in labor law so that a more comprehensible employment contract becomes an entitlement for all employees.\n\nTwo Spains? The Spanish Memory Debate and the (De)-Construction of National Identity (1996-2022)\n\nD. (David) Huijs, Zuyd University of Applied Sciences – Maastricht University\n\nAfter the death of dictator Franco in 1975, Spain looked ahead to a democratic future, leaving behind painful memories of the Civil War (1936-1939) and the subsequent dictatorship (1939-1975). This period is called the 'transición' (1975-1982) and is considered the foundation of today's democratic Spain. However, from the mid-1990s, people began to look back at the past, leading to a polarised debate. The study looks at how this 'transición period' is interpreted in different ways in the memory debate and what this means for Spain's democracy.\n\nWeg met het hokjesdenken: zakelijk en literair lezen gecombineerd. Het effect van een geïntegreerde aanpak voor het leesonderwijs op leesvaardigheid\n\nN.M.H. (Nadie) Janssen, Jacob-Roelandslyceum – Tilburg University\n\nA critical and conscious reading attitude is essential in society nowadays, but many Dutch students lack it. They read, but not ‘deeply’ enough. Reading education falls short and does not adequately address the blurred distinction between fact and fiction. This project aims to develop a didactic approach that trains students to become better readers by integrating informational and literary reading and linking them to subject-specific insights that transcend various domains of the school subject. Using Educational Design Research, we develop a didactic approach to strengthen and integrate the subject matter and teaching methodology of the school subject and reading education.\n\nSustainable collaboration in networks in the Dutch-German borderland: The role of cross-border collaboration readiness\n\nM. (Max) Klöters, Fontys University of Applied Sciences – Open University\n\nRecent studies continue to confirm that border regions miss opportunities with regard to their development. In this regard cross-border collaboration (CBC) has become imperative to address economic and societal challenges. When organizations succeed in orchestrating CBC, the border context offers untapped opportunities. As response, cross-border networks (CBN’s) have manifested as favourable approach to collaborate. However, most initiatives are not resilient, failing due to different expectations and current support mechanisms do not seem to be sufficient. This research focuses on sustainable CBC in CBN’s by delving into collaboration readiness, its antecedents and its effects on collaborative behaviour and active participation intention.\n\nRobuust Realisme. Een Reconstructie van Machiavelli’s Ambtenaarsethiek voor Onderwijs in Morele Weerbaarheid\n\nS. (Stephan) Meijers, University of Applied Sciences Leiden – Theological University Kampen\n\nThe dissertation is about the moral resilience of civil servants. Moral resilience is the necessary link between the integrity of the civil servant and the interests that could put pressure on the integrity of this civil servant. Niccolò Machiavelli's civil servant ethics is the source of advice for education that trains civil servants. With Jonathan Bennett's method of rational reconstruction, Machiavelli's perspective gains significance for the present. Civil servant ethics are treated as a funnel; from fundamental views about human nature, law and the state task to practical civil service ethics and the education that trains civil servants.\n\nLearning about future proof farming: from fear to hope\n\nE.M. (Eline) Schothorst, Aeres Group – Wageningen University & Research\n\nThe agricultural sector is in an ecological crisis and a transition is imminent. This research critically reflects on the imagined futures and emotions such as fear, anger and desire, that accompany the agricultural transition, and how these give shape to future policy and practice. The project also explores how we can give space to the emergence of these imaginaries and emotions in agricultural education, so that education can play its role in transforming agriculture and food systems.\n\nOnderzoek naar co-creatie en gezamenlijke besluitvorming (SDM) tussen jongeren en professionals bij het voorkomen van schulden bij jongeren\n\nP. (Paula) Smith, Inholland University of Applied Sciences Amsterdam – University of Amsterdam\n\nIn this proposal the central question is how youngsters and professionals can collaborate as partners in developing an approach that focusses on the prevention of debts among youngsters. At the moment, youngsters with money problems don’t find their way to financial support. By including the voice of young people in the development of a preventive approach, it’s the expectation that support better fits with their needs, that more youngsters find their way to support and that fewer get into problematic debts. This will happen through a cycle of action and reflection (action research) in combination with design based research.\n\nDekolonisering van het aardrijkskundecurriculum in het voortgezet onderwijs in Nederland met behulp van het GeoCapabilities model.\n\nM.S. (Mieke) van Vemden, Fontys Unversity of Applied Sciences – Utrecht University\n\nYoung people are exposed to simplified, and fake news narratives, hindering their understanding of complex global challenges like inequality and climate change. Geography education is vital in equipping youth with knowledge. However, achieving objectivity and multiperspectivity is challenging, given the ongoing debate on subject-related perspectives and recently decolonization within the subject. To address this, teachers must become active curriculum makers. A GeoCapabilities approach presents theoretical concepts and practical resources for educators to become active curriculum makers. This research focusses on geography teachers in the Netherlands, emphasizing their potential contribution to decolonizing the curriculum through the application of a GeoCapabilities approach.\n\nTowards a Gold Standard for Fetal Age Estimation\n\nS.C. (Sophie) Visser, OVO Zaanstad – Amsterdam UMC\n\nAccurate fetal age estimation is paramount for maternal and prenatal care. Incorrect age estimation can lead to erroneous labour induction, resulting in premature birth, and an increased risk of stillbirth. By combining multiple validated biometric methods in clinical ultrasound and radiological data, forensic (radiologic) material, and fetal material from the Dutch Fetal Biobank, the standard deviation -which is currently up to three weeks- can be lowered to a few days. The aim of this project is to create an online tool combining both existing and newly designed methods into a calculation model for clinical, forensic, and anthropologic cases worldwide.\n\nVan Technasium tot tweetalig onderwijs: een onderzoek naar meso-differentiatie in relatie tot kansengelijkheid in het voortgezet onderwijs.\n\nK. (Karina) de Waal, ISW Hoogeland – Radboud University\n\nIn Dutch secondary schools, there is an increasing trend towards meso-differentiation of the curriculum. This means that students who are enrolled at the same level of education get different or additional lessons, resulting in disparities between classes/groups. Examples of such differentiation include Technasium, bilingual education and additional arts programmes. There is limited research on meso-differentiation in secondary schools, leaving questions unanswered about its forms, origins, and implications for educational opportunities of different student groups. This study aims to provide insights into these questions using a mixed methods research design.\n\nSamen Beter Worden; De Kracht van Voeding en Beweging voor Patiënten na Oncologische Buik- en Longchirurgie\n\nC. (Charlotte) van Westerhuis, University of Applied Sciences Amsterdam – University of Amsterdam\n\nFor oncological patients following lung or abdominal surgery, a coordinated combination of physical activity and nutrition is crucial for a successful recovery of physical functioning. However, the optimal nutritional and exercise intervention for practical application, the enhancement of interdisciplinary collaboration between dieticians and physiotherapists, and the most effective utilization of eHealth in this context remain uncertain. This project aims to develop recommendations for healthcare professionals in primary care to optimize the content, delivery format, and organization of nutrition and exercise care during the rehabilitation period following oncological abdominal and lung surgery.\n\nPolarisatie en strategieën voor depolarisatie in (sociale) media\n\nE.F.J. (Enno) Wigger, University of Applied Sciences Windesheim – Wageningen University & Research\n\nThere is growing concern about increased polarization in societal discourse, particularly on (social) media platforms. However, existing scholarly knowledge on media polarization is limited due to its predominant focus on the United States and specific platforms like X (Twitter), with relatively scant attention to strategies for depolarization. This research proposal examines polarization in Dutch media across key themes such as climate change, immigration, and inclusivity. The first part maps the presence and nature of polarization in traditional and social media, while the second assesses the effectiveness of depolarization strategies for journalists and platforms.\n\nHet stimuleren van een duurzame actieve leefstijl bij CVA-patiënten in de transitie van zorg naar eigen leefomgeving.\n\nM. (Martijn) Bakker, Hanze University of Applied Sciences Groningen – University of Groningen\n\nThis research proposal aims to address the growing problem of an inactive lifestyle among stroke patients. Inactivity in stroke patients can have negative impacts on quality of life and the disease course. Despite existing interventions, current approaches are not successful in promoting physical activity sustainably in stroke patients, particularly when transitioning from clinical care to the home environment. In cocreation with patients and healthcare professionals, this program develops an intervention, tailored to patients' personal, social, and environmental determinants, to promote an active lifestyle in their own living environment. The effects of the intervention will be evaluated using a single-case design.\n\nPROMs voor de verbetering van individuele fysiotherapeutische zorg bij heup- en knievervanging\n\nD.J. (Dennis) van den Berg, University of Applied Sciences Utrecht – VU Amsterdam\n\nPatient reported outcome measures (PROMs) are questionnaires that capture the subjective experience of a patient’s health status. Currently, PROMs are mainly used to evaluate health outcomes at the group level, while they are much less often used in individual patient care. This project aims to provide evidence on how and to what extent PROMs may be used during individual physiotherapy care following a common treatment procedure (hip and knee replacement due to osteoarthrosis).\n\nEen eerste stap richting een educatieve methode om wiskundeangst en zelfsturend leren in wiskundelessen te reguleren\n\nD. (Dominique) van den Bosch, Stichting Stedelijk Voortgezet Onderwijs Zoetermeer\n\nPicasso Lyceum – TU Delft\n\nThis PhD-proposal begins by constructing a theoretical framework concerning math anxiety amongst students and teachers. It will then go on to explore the appropriate amount of help math teachers should give to students in order to regulate the math anxiety but control their skills in self-directed learning. During the third study, the math (teaching) anxiety pre-service high school math teachers experience and observe in their classrooms is measured. Taken together, the PhD-proposal ends with an educational method constructed for pre-service high school math teachers to improve self-directing learning skills but control the levels of math anxiety.\n\nErvaringen van cliënten en professionals met integrale geboortezorg in Nederland.\n\nE. (Evelien) Cellissen, Zuyd University of Applied Sciences – Maastricht University\n\nIn 2016, the Integrated Maternity Care Standard was developed in the Netherlands. The actual implementation is difficult because of the lack of a clear definition of the concept of integrated maternity care. In addition, women's experiences with the Care Standard has not been scientifically evaluated. We investigate the concept of integrated maternity care and women’s experiences with it. The results of our studies will provide insight into women’s experiences enabling maternity care professionals to align integrated maternity care with women's needs as much as possible and thereby improve quality of care.\n\n(Teaching) English as a multilingua franca: Preparing learners for successful communication in multilingual settings\n\nL. (Mili) Gabrovsek Sanders, University of Applied Sciences Amsterdam – University of Amsterdam\n\nIn present-day multilingual society, English functions as a multilingua franca, a global language learned and used by multilingual speakers to communicate across language borders. This important role of English has so far been insufficiently reflected in present-day English language teaching. This four-stage design research project therefore aims to further develop the emerging concept of English as a multilingua franca theoretically, and facilitate its transfer into practice, in order to provide teachers with the necessary tools for enhancing their learners’ capacity to communicate successfully in English in multilingual settings.\n\nVerbinding maken met de toekomst. Bruggen bouwen tussen persoonlijk welbevinden en maatschappelijk handelingsperspectief door het aansporen van toekomstbewustzijn in het hoger onderwijs.\n\nM.J. Koch, Avans University of Applied Sciences – University of Twente\n\nFutures consciousness is the ability to anticipate a complex and unpredictable future. This ability contributes to personal well-being and agency. While future-oriented higher education is becoming increasingly popular, it often focuses solely on societal challenges. However, students often experience a discrepancy between their personal, optimistic outlook on the future and a pessimistic societal outlook on the future. This research aims to develop an educational program to enhance individual-centered future consciousness in higher education in economics. The goal is to gain insight into how future consciousness develops and how education can contribute to this.\n\nDe ontwikkeling van loopbaanagency bij jongeren in een kwetsbare positie.\n\nM. (Marijn) Neuman-Sjonger, Friesland College, University of Amsterdam\n\nYouths who find themselves in vulnerable positions often experience difficulties taking control of their careers. They encounter problems taking first steps, run into barriers in their private lives and at work, and often cannot change this themselves. This research aims to understand both theoretically and empirically how youths take control over their own career development (i.e. career agency) and how this can be strengthened by interventions aimed at youths and the workplace. Forty youths who find themselves in vulnerable positions, their mentors, and the social work environment will be closely analyzed to gain insight into obstacles and efficacious mentoring interventions.\n\nLiteratuurkritiek in een digitaal tijdperk: recensies van oorspronkelijk Nederlandstalige literaire romans uit 2011-2020\n\nD.F. (Dirk) Hage, University of Applied Sciences – Radboud University Nijmegen\n\nThe practice of book reviewing has traditionally functioned as a gatekeeper: it plays a crucial role in assigning value to literary works. Due to the omnipresent digitalization in the 21st century, the scope and functioning of the reviewing practice has changed considerably. This present study is aimed at the reception of Dutch novels that were published in 2011-2020 by leading publishing houses. The reviewing practice in traditional newspapers and weekly magazines, as well as the reviewing practice on ‘serious’ websites dedicated to literary book reviews and on reading communities, will be analyzed quantitatively and qualitatively.\n\nDe rol van online pesten bij suïcide van adolescenten\n\nA.C. (Anne) Frederiks-Franssen, University of Applied Sciences Rotterdam – University of Groningen\n\nSuicide is the leading cause of death among adolescents. Bullying can play an important role. Due to technological developments, there is a trend towards cyberbullying. Research into the impact of cyberbullying and suicide, and the mechanisms at play here, are limited.\n\nThis research will provide insights for suicide prevention, by mapping the life path of adolescents who died by suicide and the role cyberbullying played to their suicide, as well as the life path of adolescents who were bullied, but did not become suicidal. Furthermore, by studying data from social media, we provide a methodologically innovative contribution to science.\n\nDe impact van de koe op de gezondheid en het welzijn van haar kalf\n\nT. (Titia) Fokkema, Van Hall Larenstein University of Applied Sciences – Wageningen University & Research\n\nGood care of calves on a dairy farm ensures that calves grow up and develop well. Much is known about the way in which the farmer can manage calf health and development. Knowledge is lacking about the influence of the cow during pregnancy and parturition on health and welfare of the calf. In this project, information is collected from cows from conception to calving and calves are intensively monitored till six months of age. Herewith, knowledge will be gained on relationships between mother and calf and perspectives for practice can be developed to further improve the care for young calves.\n\n(Teaching) English as a multilingua franca: Preparing learners for successful communication in multilingual settings\n\nL.

(Albertine) de Haan, University of Applied SciencesWindesheim – Radboud University Nijmegen\n\nMore scientific validation for psychomotor therapy (PMT) is necessary for further development of the discipline. Measurements with Patient Reported Outcome Measures (PROMs) in psychomotor therapy practice may contribute to the scientific validation of PMT, and to monitoring the results of PMT in individual patient care. The goal of this study is to develop a set of validated PROMs that may be used to evaluate the effectiveness of psychomotor therapy and to monitor individual treatment results. Moreover, this proposal addresses implementation of PROMs and the use of PROMs in psychomotor practice.\n\nLiteratuurkritiek in een digitaal tijdperk: recensies van oorspronkelijk Nederlandstalige literaire romans uit 2011-2020\n\nD.F.

(Elleke) Huijbrechts, Fontys University of Applied Sciences – Amsterdam University Medical Center, location VUmc\n\nPodiatrists play an important role in the treatment of foot pain in rheumatic disorders. Treatment success depends on patients' adherence to treatment recommendations and podiatrists' compliance with treatment guidelines. Understanding the level of adherence of patients and the factors affecting it is important, to understand and improve the self-management support provided by the podiatrist in the treatment of rheumatic foot problems. Furthermore, understanding the compliance to foot care guidelines by podiatrists is important, as this may affect the effectiveness of podiatric treatment.\n\nSamen beslissen rond artrose in 2030, door patiënten en fysiotherapeuten.\n\nJ. (Jelmer) Jager, University of Applied Sciences Leiden – Erasmus Medical Center\n\nDutch government policy calls for a transformation of care, in which 'shared decision-making' and 'transfer of care to the living environment' are important topics. By (re)designing an intervention for shared decision-making, with explicit attention to the role of the environment in which shared decision-making takes place, this scientific research contributes to this transformation. The (re)design is based on the wishes and preferences of the users as well as the state-of-art in scientific literature. As casestudy, the interaction between people with osteoarthritis and physiotherapists, and their decisions about treatment and care is used.\n\nEffectieve beweegadvisering bij prostaatkanker: een stap naar optimale interactie\n\nM.M.J. (Myrthe) Joosten, University of Applied Sciences Amsterdam – Tilburg University\n\nExercise improves overall health in prostate cancer patients and lowers their mortality risk. Yet, most prostate cancer patients move too little, partly because of lacking or inadequate advice from healthcare professionals. With our multidisciplinary, mixed-methods study we aim to gain insights into the dynamic nature of the professional - patient interaction concerning lifestyle advice, to identify targets for improvement. Additionally, the role of low health literacy and stigma will be investigated. We will identify those aspects in the interaction between care provider and patient which are both important and feasible to improve, to improve exercise advice for prostate cancer patients.\n\nVerbinding maken met de toekomst.

Een onderzoek naar het belang van diverse vormen van psychologische flexibiliteit bij chronische pijn.\n\nI.P. (Ivo) Legierse, Fontys University of Applied Sciences– Radboud University Medical Center\n\nChronic pain has a major impact on society, healthcare(costs) and the quality of life of patients. After years of focus on medicalization and specific personal characteristics that play a role in the development and maintenance of chronic pain, the focus is shifting to demedicalization and prevention with special attention to the dynamic and continuous adaptability of a patient to stay as healthy as possible. Psychological flexibility has a potential important protective effect in this regard. However, more knowledge and research is needed on the role of different forms of psychological flexibility in recovering and experiencing optimal health, despite chronic pain.\n\nDe ontwikkeling van loopbaanagency bij jongeren in een kwetsbare positie.\n\nM. (Marijn) Neuman-Sjonger, Friesland College – University of Amsterdam\n\nYouths who find themselves in vulnerable positions often experience difficulties taking control of their careers. They encounter problems taking first steps, run into barriers in their private lives and at work, and often cannot change this themselves. This research aims to understand both theoretically and empirically how youths take control over their own career development (i.e. career agency) and how this can be strengthened by interventions aimed at youths and the workplace.

Een empirisch hermeneutisch onderzoek naar de receptie van religieuze bronnen in nieuwe gemeenschappen in Nederland.\n\nJ.A. (Hanneke) de Pater-Bakker, Ede Christian University of Applied Sciences – VU Amsterdam\n\nAs seen in crisis situations such as the Covid-19 pandemic, community and meaning-making are important conditions for strengthening resilience. Main point of research is the development of meaning in the context of human encounter and in interaction with religious sources. This study will focus on the question whether and how, in a post-Christian context, participants of new experimental Protestant communities develop meaning in interaction with the sources provided to them. This research brings the potential contribution of this meaning-making to the development of resilience for participants into focus.\n\nVan evaluatie naar implementatie: een bio-psychosociale behandeling voor mensen met nek en rugpijn\n\nE.Y. (Eva) Poolman, University of Applied Sciences Utrecht – VU Amsterdam\n\nBack and neck pain are common disorders and are often accompanied with mental problems. This combination of physical and mental problems requires a bio-psychosocial approach. A newly developed intervention (Back2Action) combines the usual physiotherapeutic care with online modules aimed at reducing mental problems. In this project we will evaluate Back2Action and investigate how we can implement Back2Action in primary physiotherapy practice. We anticipate that Back2Action will improve the management of people with back and neck pain.\n\nMind(set) Your Motivation\n\nD. (Dagmar) Platte, Stichting Pallas – Open University\n\nThe motivation of Dutch primary school pupils and their learning performance in reading and math have been declining over the past 15 years. Fostering a growth mindset could be beneficial to increase learner motivation and improve learning performance. However, mindset research has been done predominantly in secondary or higher education students, the population of primary school pupils is relatively unexplored. Using a Design Based Research approach, in co-creation with all stakeholders, a growth mindset intervention for primary school pupils will be designed, implemented, and evaluated for its acute and long-term effectiveness on mindset belief, motivation and learning performance.\n\nHet stimuleren van zelfregulatie onder (aanstaande) basisschoolleerkrachten door de inzet van digitaal aangeboden nudges in een blended pabo-curriculum.\n\nN.J.M. (Nienke) Reessink, Iselinge University of Applied Sciences – Open University\n\n(Pre-service) primary school teachers need to regulate their own learning (self-regulation). Self-regulation enables students to take more control of their own learning process. Early career primary school teachers need self-regulation to participate in professionalization. Self-regulation can be supported during their study programme with notifications (nudges) in the digital learning environment. Some forms of nudges are more likely to yield a long-term effect on self-regulation. It is possible that the effect on self-regulation that nudges in the digital learning environment have during the study programme persists into the (early) career of primary school teachers.\n\nFungal diversity to expand the palette of mycelium materials with varying properties\n\nC.A. (Ilse) Rovers, Avans University of Applied Sciencesl – Utrecht University\n\nBeing biodegradable and carbon-neutral, mycelium-based-materials (MBMs) contribute to solving global societal issues like climate change. Current MBMs are produced by utilising only a few fungal species. Yet, different filamentous fungi may possess unique mycelium characteristics and thereby may have different material properties. Therefore, the impact of MBMs could potentially be even larger when this variation of material properties is considered. This PhD-project will study the unique mycelium properties of different fungi with the aim to expand the palette of MBMs with a focus to textile-like pure mycelium materials.\n\nZicht op professionaliseringsinterventies in het mbo.\n\nN.M. (Natasja) Sabajo, University of Applied Sciences Leiden – Tilburg University\n\nTeachers in senior secondary vocational education face a growing challenge due to increasing diversity within their student population. To achieve an inclusive work and learning climate, it is imperative that students feel a sense of belonging and experience the opportunity to achieve study success. The impact of teacher’s behavior on students' achievements has become more evident. In order to create an inclusive climate teachers are trained in professional knowledge and pedagogical behavior in order to better manage the diversity of students. This research investigates how teachers professionalism contributes towards an inclusive work and learning climate.\n\nWitness protection: defining best practices in international criminal cases and assessing the needs of domestic witness protection units in International Criminal Court (ICC) situation countries to enhance capacity and complementarity\n\nG.A. (Gregory) Townsend, University of Applied Sciences the Hague – Leiden University\n\nThis research examines what are the best practices of witness protection units of international courts. It assesses what domestic, witness-protection units need, in developing countries and countries with cases before the International Criminal Court, with a view to making these units better able to protect witnesses in their respective countries.\n\nMedisch rekenen in het mbo: Inzicht in en interventies voor dit beruchte struikelblok.\n\nH.A.C. (Hiske) Vaarwerk, ROC Midden Nederland – Utrecht University\n\nIt has been questioned whether nurses are able to conduct calculation of medication properly. Concerns have been raised in the media and in scientific research. Nurses feel their responsibility, but their abilities aren’t always up to par. How can education be improved to prevent mistakes? This question is tackled in this project among nursing students. First, the contribution of potential underlying factors to medical calculation is investigated. This concerns language ability, working memory and affective processes. Based on the outcomes, appropriate interventions are developed to improve students’ medication calculation skills.\n\nBots of Trust: An interdisciplinary discourse\n\nR. (Rhied) Al-Othmani, University of Applied Sciences Utrecht – Utrecht University\n\nThis PhD project focuses on automated Conversational Agents (e.g. chatbots and voice assistants) and their role in user services in the public domain. Automated forms of communication have become increasingly common in interactions between organisations and their target groups. This raises questions of relationship-building, trust, forms of service use and data ethics. The interdisciplinary study critically examines how citizens’ interactions with Conversational Agents shape trust in public organisations. By connecting insights from different disciplines (media and communication studies, human-computer-interaction research and marketing) and experimental research, this study contributes to the scientific understanding of automated communication technology in daily life.\n\nIncorporating supply-chain actor perspectives in optimising valorization decisions in agri-food supply chains\n\nE. (Emmanuel) Anom, Aeres Group – Wageningen University & Research\n\nSeveral valorisation options for agricultural waste and side streams are being explored for the design of sustainable closed-loop supply chain systems. These studies, handled on a case-specific basis, require decision support tools to evaluate optimal valorisation pathways and the influence of individual actor objectives on the design of the sustainable supply chain networks (SSCN). SSCNs need to consider alternative value and supply chain configurations that provide benefits for all participating stakeholders. This could lead to insights that identify tradeoffs and phrase managerial and policy recommendations to eliminate inefficiencies of current supply chains.\n\nEffective strength training of frail elderly people still living at home: tools for the physiotherapist\n\nM. (Mohammed) Benali, Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences – VU Amsterdam\n\nAs society ages, the prevalence of physical limitations is increasing. For frail elderly adults, these limitations mean they require assistance in their daily activities. An important cause of physical limitations is sarcopenia. Strength training is known to help prevent and treat sarcopenia. However, it is unknown which training load is most effective for frail elderly adults. Also, the role of proteins and individual characteristics (such as gender, age, or frailty status) in determining the ideal training load is unclear. With this study, we want to provide physiotherapists with tools for the treatment of frail older adults.\n\nThe pathway to a biopsychosocial approach in primary care physiotherapy\n\nJ. (Han) van Dijk, University of Applied Sciences Utrecht – Maastricht University\n\nA large portion of the Dutch population suffers the consequences of chronic pain on a daily basis. Many of them visit a physiotherapist with these complaints. Scientific insights on how to best treat this group of patients are not well utilized in primary care. In this research, I aim to develop, apply and evaluate an implementation strategy. The goal of this strategy is to change the working method of physiotherapists to treat patients with chronic pain according to the current scientific insights.\n\nChallenged or exhausted? How front-line paramedics deal with increasingly complex requests for assistance\n\nJ. (Jeroen) van Egmond, Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences – Utrecht University\n\nIn order to meet increasingly complex care needs, healthcare professionals are expected to work in a fundamentally different way. This study examines how allied healthcare professionals translate these complex care needs into their treatment approach and how that is influenced by their views on appropriate care and professionalism. It also examines how possible differences between the desired care and the care actually provided affect the enthusiasm of these professionals. Finally, these insights will be translated into a programme for further training and support.\n\nTeaching for Purpose: encouraging purpose development in adolescents through an integrated approach in secondary classroom settings.\n\nR.M. (Ruth) Frans, Wolfert van Borselen Scholengroep – Erasmus University Rotterdam\n\nThere is growing recognition that schools need to prepare students for an actively contributing role in society. To reach this goal, schools frequently use add-on programmes that focus on social-emotional development. The effectiveness of these programmes in secondary schools is still limited, however, possibly due to the detachment from day-to-day teaching practices. Recent research in educational and developmental science underlines the importance of adolescents' sense of purpose (i.e. having a meaningful, beyond-the-self goal). The overall goal of this multi-method project is to develop and test a novel, integrated method: Teaching for Purpose, leading to a new purpose-driven approach in education.\n\nVoice to the patient. Qualitative inquiry to enhance meaningful engagement of people living with non-communicable diseases in sub-Saharan Africa to influence health policy making.\n\nA. (Tineke) de Groot, Ede Christian University of Applied Sciences – VU Amsterdam\n\nCollective patient engagement is increasingly considered an important strategy for improving health policymaking and thereby the quality of care for people living with non-communicable diseases. Research on engagement practices merely focuses on high-income countries. It is unclear how collective patient engagement in low- and middle-income countries is experienced and how this could be best operationalised and implemented, in order to influence health policymaking. By conducting participatory and transdisciplinary research in the sub-Saharan Africa context, the proposed study seeks to address this gap and help to increase meaningful engagement of people living with non-communicable diseases.\n\nFrom anxiety to self-efficacy: ‘Daring spaces’ learning environments for living labs\n\nM.J. (Mirthe) van den Hee, Inholland University of Applied Sciences Diemen – Wageningen University & Research\n\nLiving labs are relatively new learning environments in which students work independently on real-life, wicked problems. Students struggle to shift to a more autonomous mindset while engaging with highly ambiguous and complex cases. The resulting anxiety negatively impacts their confidence and learning in the lab. This research aims to explore how the sociological notion of 'daring spaces' - a safe and challenging environment for all participants - can be developed within the living lab as a practical, educational framework. The ambition is to explore how daring spaces can create an appropriate learning environment for students to develop their self-efficacy.\n\n'Can madam help me?' Forms of address in Friesland\n\nG.A. (Gerbrich) de Jong, NHL Stenden University of Applied Sciences – Radboud University Nijmegen\n\nIn Frisian, you can address someone with 'jo' (Dutch 'u') or 'do' (Dutch 'jij'), but also in the third person, as in the title of this project. Some Frisians also use this form when speaking Dutch. This project investigates when these forms of address are used, by whom and to whom, where they come from, and also what effect they have on the addressee. Knowledge about this will contribute to mutual understanding and intercultural communication in the bilingual province of Friesland.\n\nPoppin’ pills is all we know; performative pedagogy and resistance in secondary vocational education\n\nJ. (Jacob) Koolstra, ROC van Amsterdam – Erasmus University Rotterdam\n\nThis research studies the role resistance plays in the personal development of students in secondary vocational education in the Netherlands (mbo). By making a connection between educational practices and recent insights into philosophy, it investigates the possibility of incorporating the resistance of students in the learning process to create unique and creative 'selves'. This gives students in vocational education the opportunity to make a distinctive contribution to their own personal development and to the development of society.\n\nDialogue in Sustainable Human Resource Management: An interpretative investigation into the application of dialogue in the development of a sustainable employment relationship and sustainable work.\n\nJ.W.A. (Jan Willem) Nuis, Ede Christian University of Applied Sciences – Nyenrode Business University\n\nIncreasingly, dialogue is referred to as an important practice that enables to organize work more sustainably. However, dialogue has not yet been clearly defined in the literature and practice of Sustainable HRM, although oftentimes much is expected of its outcomes. In this research project, dialogue is further elaborated in the context of sustainable work. In collaboration with managers, employees and HR professionals, it is examined what dialogue means to them, how they can and do use it in their daily practice and how this can be supported. A working method will be developed for this together with practitioners and HRM students.\n\nDon’t let go, just hold on differently – interaction and collaboration in family-centred transition care for people with severe multiple disabilities turning 18\n\nI. (Ilse) Ooms, Rotterdam University of Applied Sciences – Erasmus University Rotterdam\n\nDue to increasing medical possibilities, more children with profound intellectual and multiple disabilities (PIMD) are reaching the age of 18 years. Legal and organizational aspects of healthcare then change. Transition in care is particularly complex for this patient group due to complex medical problems, reliance on others for interaction and collaboration with healthcare professionals, and the lack of a coordinating adult care practitioner, such as a pediatrician. Family-oriented transitional care can improve the quality of life of young people with PIMD and their families. Hardly any research has been conducted that reveals bottlenecks for interaction and cooperation in family-oriented transitional care.\n\nThe effects of an intermedial literature didactic on conscious literary reading skills and media literacy\n\nE.A.M.P. (Eline) Peeters, Stichting Spinoza Lyceum – Tilburg University\n\nStudents today need to be able to navigate a complex media culture. Reading literature is exceptionally suited to teaching students deep reading, critical thinking and reasoning. Literature education can therefore help to improve students’ media literacy and literacy in general. Through this project, based on Educational Design Research, a new literature didactics for upper secondary education (havo/vwo) students will be developed that teaches students how to deep read and educates them to become critical media users. It will examine to what extent this intermedial literature didactics can help to strengthen their conscious literary literacy and media literacy.\n\nProviding effective feedback to students with Special Educational Needs\n\nM. (Maaike) Radix, Herman Broerenstichting – VU Amsterdam\n\nIn educational research, feedback is considered an effective means to support student’s learning and development. However, not much is known about providing feedback to students with Special Educational Needs (SEN). This PhD project aims to develop and test a feedback model for teachers working with students with SEN. First, a systematic review will be conducted of studies on effective feedback styles for teachers with SEN-students. Second, we propose a feedback model for teachers working with SEN-students. Lastly, this model will be tested in an intervention study in primary and special education.\n\nResearch into family therapy for relational trauma after sexual sibling abuse\n\nA.P. (Aletta) Simons, Ede Christian University of Applied Sciences – Tilburg University\n\nSibling Sexual Abuse (SSA) is a common form of sexual abuse in families. Consequences are often severe, long-lasting, and in multiple life areas for both the victim and the young perpetrator. After a disclosure, the individual psycho-trauma symptoms of the victim and the young perpetrator are addressed. However, the abuse impacts the entire family and can lead to relational family trauma that requires treatment. This PhD research wants to increase insight into the relational trauma after sexual sibling abuse and the content and outcomes of family treatment.\n\nA sustainable career perspective on the school-to-work transition of emerging adults with autism spectrum disorder\n\nL. (Lars) Veerhoff, Fontys University of Applied Sciences – Radboud University Nijmegen\n\nIndividuals with autism struggle to transition from education to work and shape their careers. The transition from education to work is an important junction. This PhD project will investigate how young adults with autism go through this school-to-work transition towards a sustainable career as not much is known about it. Career sustainability is determined by long-term happiness, health and productivity, which are affected by both individual and contextual factors. The research aims to gain insight into the important underlying mechanisms and preconditions to improve support at school and work.\n\nHigher vocational education teachers in work experience placements: connecting education and practice\n\nE.C.A. (Liesbeth) Verkuyl, Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences – University of Amsterdam\n\nTeachers in higher vocational education are increasingly involved in supervising students in learning environments at the school-work interface. This differs from guiding students within the ‘confines’ of the educational institution. This PhD research aims to gain insight into how teachers can successfully develop their role to guide students in these learning environments and connect education and practice.\n\nWhy are young men in the Netherlands committing suicide? An examination of causes during the life course and the challenges of modern society, especially during the COVID-19 era\n\nW.E. (Eline) Verschoor, University of Applied Sciences Windesheim – University of Groningen\n\nDuring the pandemic, the suicide rate among young men peaked in the Netherlands. Indeed, since 2013, the suicide rate among young adults has been gradually increasing. This study aims to better understand suicide among young men in order to develop a suicide prevention strategy. Through interviews with parents and friends of deceased young men (and a control group), I investigate how developments in the peer group, demands of modern society and personal challenges influenced the suicides of young men during the pandemic. Theoretical contributions consist of updating the explanatory power of Durkheim’s anomic suicide, egoistic suicide and the Interpersonal Theory of Suicide (Joiner).\n\nApplying Change Laboratory to transform school systems\n\nA.H.L. (Adriaan) Walpot, De Werkplaats Kindergemeenschap – Utrecht University\n\nThis study investigates criteria for the beneficial transformation of routines in school systems. In Change Laboratory intervention sessions, stakeholders (students, teachers, parents and school management) collaborate with the researcher to identify and solve obstacles to their objectives. The importance of this study is its contribution to knowledge on educational change; change which is proven difficult to accomplish. Usually, educational change research focuses on one perspective (e.g. teacher or organisation). This study aims to combine multiple perspectives. By scaling up and analysing different contexts, it offers both micro-level insights into change processes in teachers’ classrooms, and micro-meso-level explanations for change.\n\nInternationalisation and Corporate Social Responsibility: Zooming in on emerging-markets multinationals\n\nY. (Yigi) Wang, HAN University of Applied Sciences – University of Amsterdam\n\nFast economic development sees more emerging-market multinationals (EM-MNEs) expanding overseas, yet they face very different stakeholder expectations in developed countries. This puts pressure on EM-MNEs to develop and implement context-specific corporate social responsibility (CSR) actions and policies during internationalisation given home-host country differences. Despite large societal, managerial and academic interests in the CSR performance of EM-MNEs abroad, research has been lacking. This project explores the CSR performance of EM-MNEs in response to host-country pressures and home-host country differences during internationalisation. Using both quantitative and qualitative methods, it contributes to international business and management literatures and yields practical (teaching) insights.\n\nMultilingual language didactics: recognising every student! A study on promoting language awareness and target language development through the implementation of multilingual language didactics in Dutch and modern foreign languages\n\nI.M.H. (Irma) Westheim, OSG Hugo de Groot – University of Amsterdam\n\nAlthough plurilingualism is a reality in the Netherlands, secondary education underutilizes additional linguistic knowledge and skills of students. Even language teachers who know the benefits of multilingual pedagogies wonder how to use these in their lessons. This study aims to expose language teachers to the advantages of multilingual pedagogies by Lesson Study and professionalization and to stimulate the language awareness and (foreign) language learning of students (ages 14 to 16) in the third and fourth grades of their pre-university (vwo) and senior general secondary (havo) programmes in the Dutch school system.\n\nPhysical activity in the transition period from primary to secondary school (10-15 years); understanding influencing factors and effective interventions\n\nL.A.J. (Lieke) Wolfs, The Hague University of Applied Sciences – Leiden University Medical Center\n\nMany adolescents are physically inactive and do not meet the physical activity guidelines. This can result in a range of negative health effects ear. If this trend continues, the lives of current generation of young people will be five years shorter than that of their parents. Some of these adolescents still met the physical activity guidelines during primary education. This PhD research investigates which factors can explain the decline in physical activity between the ages of 10 and 15 years, and what effective interventions can stop this decline and promote an active lifestyle.\n\nWorking with a systems-based approach in clinical youth psychiatry\n\nB. (Bertine) Zech, University of Applied Sciences Leiden – Leiden University\n\nAdolescents admitted in in-patient psychiatry not only experience severe individual psychiatric problems but also face challenges in family functioning. Although families are heavily involved in therapy, professionals are challenged to apply an effective family-focused approach. This action-based research project has trained treatment teams. Data has been collected from professionals, parents and adolescents regarding professionals’ perceived competence, cooperation between the team and families, and satisfaction. This PhD research focuses on profound analyses of this data to provide scientific knowledge and guidance for application of an effective family-focused approach.\n\nThe sacred in musealised synagogue space. Representations of Jewish religious life in the Amsterdam Jewish Cultural Quarter\n\nP.P. (Paul) Ariese, Amsterdam University of the Arts - University of Amsterdam\n\nHow are religion and heritage intertwined in the synagogues of the Jewish Cultural Quarter in Amsterdam? Which emotions, views and senses of ownership play a role in this interaction, and how can heritage professionals respond to this? This empirical study examines and compares how religious communities, museum visitors and heritage professionals perceive the Portuguese Synagogue and the Great Synagogue. The research offers (future) heritage professionals a theoretical, practical and ethical action framework for representing religion in postsecular Dutch society.\n\nThe influence of the teacher's personal beliefs on lesson preparation in primary education\n\nH. (Henk) Averesch, Viaa Christian University of Applied Sciences – Theological University of Apeldoorn\n\nWhen primary school teachers prepare their lessons, they make a variety of choices. In these choices, the personal beliefs plays an important role because these influence their lessons. In this educational design research, a lesson preparation practice is designed in which the influence of the personal convictions is more explicitly brought to the attention. The expectation is that this will enable the teacher to better substantiate and justify the choices he has made. This is relevant because accountability by the teacher is required increasingly.\n\nRegenerative Education: Designing and Enacting Ecological Higher Education that connects to Sustainability Transformations\n\nB. (Bas) van den Berg, The Hague University of Applied Sciences - Wageningen University & Research\n\nThis research aims to unravel how regenerative higher education that contributes to regional transformations towards more sustainable futures, can be designed and enacted. This is done through two interrelated studies:\n\nA review of the current state of practice and the characteristics of higher education that actively engages students in transformations towards sustainability.\n\nAn extensive case study of designing and enacting this type of education through a minor (Mission Impact) in The Hague, the Netherlands, investigating how such education can be co-created and what this requires from the involved stakeholders, particularly teachers and students.\n\nSocial robotics and generative AI to support and enhance creative experiences for older adults\n\nM. (Marianne) Bossema, Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences – Leiden University\n\nExtensive research has shown that creative activities can promote health and well-being with older adults. At some point in their lives, it becomes more difficult for seniors over 65 to participate in the creative activities that give them pleasure. Social robotics and generative AI offer unique opportunities to keep creative activities accessible and engaging, but there are unanswered questions about the added value and the specific wants and needs of older adults. Research into this contributes to the empowerment and wellbeing of the elderly, as well as to the development of theories about human-machine creative collaboration.\n\nWho am I now? A study on identity changes of people with aphasia\n\nR. (Rianne) Brinkman, Rotterdam University of Applied Sciences - University of Humanistic Studies\n\nPeople who have a stroke experience major changes in daily life. They have to learn how to deal with limitations that arise and how to reshape their identity. Communication, however, is crucial in identity formation. Thus, for people with aphasia who suffer from language disorders, it is an even greater challenge to reshape identity. In this study we will explore how people with aphasia reshape identity in the first two years after their stroke and how health care professionals can better support identity formation of people with aphasia.\n\nAnother Disappearing Audience? Towards an Integrated Study of Standpoint Epistemologies and Intersectionality for Critical Media Literacy Education\n\nC.P.M. (Castor) Brouwer, Metis Montessori Lyceum - University of Amsterdam\n\nConsidering the rising impact of audiovisual media alongside increasing diversity among high school students in the Netherlands, it is important to incorporate inclusive and critical media literacy in contemporary education practice. When it comes to teaching students critical media skills, however, this multiplicity of backgrounds is largely left unconsidered, obstructing the core principles and strengths of diverse classrooms. This project bridges this gap by implementing intersectionality and standpoint epistemologies into critical media literacy education. Through combining an integrative literature review with interpretative (audience) ethnography, this research answers to how specifically audiovisual media literacy relies on inclusive and emancipatory educational practices.\n\nUnravelling sympatric speciation in a marine host-symbiont system\n\nJ.R. (Jorn) Claassen, Dollard College – University of Groningen\n\nCoral reefs harbour an immense biodiversity. A large component of this biodiversity is made up by small invertebrates living in association with coral species. Many questions still remain on the origin of this marine biodiversity, but terrestrial research on plants and insects shows many of these species originate in the same region, while it is often thought new species are formed in isolation. The researcher will investigate corals and their symbiotic crabs, to elucidate whether such sympatric speciation can also explain the high biodiversity found on coral reefs.\n\nEqual opportunities in secondary education: What role do secondary school teachers play in the transition of pupils from heterogeneous to homogeneous classes?\n\nN. (Nathalia) Drent, Openbaar Onderwijs Groep Groningen (O2G2) - University of Groningen\n\nThere is an inequality of opportunity in secondary education, because socio-economic status (SES) plays a role in the educational success of students. As a solution, the Education Council proposes a multi-year heterogeneous class, so that students have more time to develop themselves. The role of secondary education teachers in the development of educational transfer advice is unclear. That is why this study examines the development of educational transfer recommendations in more detail.\n\nPersonal formation in practice. A proposal for a theoretically sound concept and a recognisable phenomenon in practice\n\nP. (Peter) Elshout, Inholland University of Applied Sciences - University of Humanistic Studies\n\nPersonal formation within primary schools is a theoretically complex subject. In practice this formation takes place on numerous occasions. The purpose of this research project is to get a clear understanding of both the concept and the phenomenon of personal formation. First a theoretical framework will be composed which will be used to interview a group of experienced teachers to clarify the concept. Then the phenomenon of personal formation will be examined, using journals and video-recall interviews. Lastly we will discuss the contribution the gathered data on the experienced phenomenon can make to the theoretical concept of personal formation.\n\nCommon Practice: a livelihood perspective of economic development in the post-Roman world\n\nR. (Roeland) Emaus, Saxion University of Applied Sciences – Leiden University\n\nToday’s socio-economic challenges aren’t new. In the centuries after the retreat of the Roman state people with different backgrounds and with different ways of life somehow managed to build and maintain a complex economic system in northern Gaul that would produce the ruling dynasties of Europe.\n\nBy applying state of the art analytical models on available archaeological data, this research will contribute to an understanding of how local communities in post-Roman northern Gaul organized their livelihoods. This study will provide fundamentals on what it is that makes local economies resilient and successful.\n\nDevelopment of a toolkit for digital innovation according to the CeHRes Roadmap in the clinical context of recovery care\n\nM. (Martijn) van der Ent, The Hague University of Applied Sciences - Delft University of Technology\n\nDigital technology has the potential to make healthcare more effective and efficient. However, scalable implementation of digital technology proves difficult due to the complex healthcare context. The CeHRes Roadmap is a robust innovation model that facilitates multidisciplinary development, implementation, and evaluation of meaningful healthcare technology with a structured holistic approach. The aim of this research proposal is to make the CeHRes Roadmap applicable to the specific context of rehabilitation. A toolkit will be developed to facilitate the innovation process in a fieldlab to allow a more effective and efficient development of digital innovations.\n\nWhen and why do parents stumble or thrive? Examining interrelations among changes in the spousal relationship, parental functioning, and child development in the 4 years following the transition to parenthood\n\nJ.F. (Jolien) Grolleman, University of Applied Sciences Leiden - University of Amsterdam\n\nThe birth of a child can cause a decline in spousal relationship satisfaction. Dissatisfaction in the spousal relationship can negatively affect parental functioning and child development, hence the need among municipalities and professionals for effective methods to strengthen the spousal relationship during the transition to parenthood. Therefore, this PhD research increases knowledge about the interrelations among (changes in) relationship satisfaction, parental functioning and the child development during the transition to parenthood and the following four years, and investigates the effectiveness of a preventive intervention.\n\nBuilding an integrated sustainability curriculum for higher professional economic education?\n\nT. (Theo) de Joode, The Hague University of Applied Sciences – VU Amsterdam\n\nPoliticians and society are increasingly calling on businesses to incorporate sustainability into their business operations. Higher professional economic education partly meets these requests by offering more or less stand-alone sustainability courses. However, the integration of sustainability into the main curriculum is still insufficient. Here, the neoclassical economic theory of the firm, which focusses on maximizing profits for financiers, generally dominates. The objective of this research is to develop building blocks from more appropriate business views - and underlying views of humans and society - that can be used to fully integrate sustainability into the curriculum.\n\nSociety and the Control of Religious Radicalism in the Low Countries During the Long Fifteenth Century\n\nD.J. (David) Knibbe, Metis Montessori Lyceum – Radboud University\n\nThe proposed project will investigate the formation of the Dutch way of coping with religious radicalism during the long fifteenth century (1370-1550). Social, political and religious developments make it an pivotal period in history. This research studies three religious figures, Henricus Herp (1400-1478), Alanus de Rupe (1428-1475) and Maria van Hout (ca. 1470-1547), who spread their ideas amongst the laity and challenged the authority of the Church as well as their political and social surroundings. On the basis of both secular and religious primary source material the proposed research studies the formation of Dutch (religious) tolerance in its historical context.\n\nErasmus motivator: the Colloquia as a pedagogical-didactical instrument\n\nJ.T.J. (Jacques) Koppenol, Kennemer Lyceum Overveen – Utrecht University\n\nThis project investigates how Erasmus successfully motivated students to learn a foreign language in his Colloquia. Analysing Erasmus’ innovative approach to education is particularly promising as it applies his conceptual understanding of motivation to practical examples. This interdisciplinary approach reveals how Erasmus, in this historical case, developed effective motivational strategies in foreign language acquisition. It also offers a new perspective on the similar, contemporary challenge in our educational practice of keeping students motivated for learning foreign languages.\n\nMore than just \"Uh, was?\": Strengthening communicative competence through plurilingual strategies in the school subject German\n\nC.M.J. (Chrissy) Laurentzen, Commanderij college – Radboud University\n\nDuring lower secondary education pupils learn German for at least two years (havo/vwo). However, there is a(n) (unspoken) native speaker norm and little spoken communication takes place. This results into pupils not achieving basis communicative skills and hardly daring to speak German. In order to improve this, plurilingual strategies can be taught. The CEFR companion volume with new descriptors for plurilingualism and the proposal of curriculum.nu for the new school curriculum also speak for that. Therefore, this research investigates to what extent the teaching of plurilingual strategies during German classes can better prepare pupils for effective communication with German speakers.\n\nA New Dawn for Angola? A Case Study of Angola’s Delayed Transitional Justice Process\n\nM.V. (Maarten) van Munster, The Hague University of Applied Sciences – VU Amsterdam\n\nWhen Angola's 27-year civil war ended in 2002, its government declared a general amnesty for all perpetrators. Recently, however, the country entered into delayed transitional justice (TJ), aimed at memorialization, truth-seeking, and reconciliation. Very little is known about factors that contribute to the success or failure of such processes that are vital for enduring peace. This study critically analyses risk and promotive factors for the Angolan case and measures the popular perception of the TJ process. Results will not only enrich literature, but also aid other countries confronted with the question of how to address past atrocities in post-conflict situations.\n\nThe Implementation of Retrieval Practice to Improve Language and Math Skills in Primary Education\n\nF.H.A. (Fieke) Ophuis-Cox, Stichting Katholiek en Protestants-Christelijk Onderwijs Eindhoven en omgeving - Open University\n\nIn Dutch primary education (PE), pupils’ language and math skills are insufficiently developed. A possible solution for this problem may lie in the use of evidence-based didactic strategies, such as retrieval practice (RP). This strategy has promising effects on learning outcomes. However, RP has only been studied to a limited extent in the context of PE. Therefore, in this proposal, it is investigated how RP is currently used in textbooks and how different implementations of RP can lead to the improvement of language and math education in PE.\n\nAI in design education: a critical orientation\n\nE. (Eke) Rebergen, Avans University of Applied Sciences - University of Amsterdam\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is integrated in more and more products. Various contemporary ecological, social, and ethical issues are involved when using this technology. Designers should take these issues into account while working on future applications. This research enables designers to critically deploy AI in various domains the upcoming years. For that purpose research will be done on the possibilities to strengthen the critical orientation within different design programs in the Netherlands.\n\nProtein transition in the elderly\n\nA. (Annelies) Rotteveel, The Hague University of Applied Sciences - Amsterdam UMC - VUmc\n\nThe environmental impact of our current food system is huge. It is internationally recognized that a shift towards more plant-based diets is needed. The aim is to reverse the animal-plant protein ratio in the diet from 60% animal and 40% plant protein to 40% animal and 60% plant protein.\n\nIn this PhD project the possibilities and effects of this protein transition are investigated. Is the diet complete, are there any effects on (muscle)health and what is the practical feasibility for the elderly? The project provides essential knowledge, as well as applicable guidelines and aids for dieticians in practice.\n\nQuantitative diagnostics of dysphagia using ultrasound\n\nL. (Lotte) Terwoert, Fontys University of Applied Sciences - Eindhoven University of Technology\n\nSwallowing disorders are common and manifest several symptoms that impact the quality of life severely. Current diagnostics are subjective and miss uniformity, as objective characterization of the swallowing function and the involved structures is lacking. Ultrasound promises to be a suitable technology to provide new insights and quantitative diagnostics. Following a well-designed protocol, ultrasound measurements can provide quantitative information on the swallowing structures and their dynamic behavior. In this project, dedicated ultrasound tissue-characterization and strain-imaging methods are proposed with the aim to investigate and evaluate the added value of quantitative ultrasonography in the diagnosis of swallowing disorders.\n\nBorn with a silver spoon? Kinship, agency and social continuity in a Frisian middle class\n\nB. (Boike) Teunissen, Willem Lodewijk Gymnasium – University of Groningen\n\nIntergenerational continuity of social positions within middle-class families is an underexposed and misunderstood phenomenon. It is not self-evident that middle-class families maintain the same social position for generations, certainly not in times of major "
