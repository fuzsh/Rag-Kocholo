        "text": "Why a national competition authority should or shouldn't share its own news and posts in English? After many (Dutch) comments and the current 'political' context in the Netherlands, Martijn Snoep explains his reasons. And let me add two points. First, not only the work of the ACM but also its broader epistemic community is highly international, including academia and the students who study competition law and regulation in the Netherlands. I hope it remains like that, because from the side I watch this space this community, and any other community can only strive if it is open and inclusive (including age, gender and race), diverse and multicultural and has the ability to speak many languages including that of the specialist and that of non-specialist audiences. Second, communicating in English can increase the transparency and accountability of NCAs' work and can provide a forum to question the decisions taken (or not taken). The ACM and many other administrative authorities in the Member States are becoming the enforcers of what has been called an emerging \"digital constitutionalism\" and hence, their \"court-like\" functions and new enforcement roles should be subject to increased constitutional controls both in domestic and supranational levels. Obviously, the language of communication is not a constitutional safeguard in itself, but can be a robust way to start the debate on the constitutional role of NCAs.\n\nEuropean Commission accuses Apple of DMA violation: The European Commission (EC) outlined its initial view Apple was breaching Digital Markets Act (DMA) rules with its App Store policies, as the regulator opened a fresh investigation into the iPhone maker for another potential violation. Preliminary findings of an investigation into the tech giant’s compliance with the DMA with regards to its App Store indicated Apple’s rules prevented developers from freely steering consumers to alternative channels for offers and content, the EC explained. Under the law, it highlighted, developers using Apple’s app distribution platform should be able to inform users of alternative purchasing options without charge and steer them to those offers. In its initial view none of Apple’s three sets of relevant business terms allowed developers to freely steer customers. Should the EC’s preliminary findings be confirmed a non-compliance decision will be made within 12 months of the start of the probe, which in this case was 25 March 2024. European Commissioner for the Internal Market Thierry Breton said it had “reason to believe that the App Store rules not allowing app developers to communicate freely with their own users is in breach of the DMA”. “Without prejudice to Apple’s right of defence, we are determined to use the clear and effective DMA toolbox to finally open real opportunities for innovators and for consumers”. EC EVP for competition policy Margrethe Vestager (pictured) added: “the developers’ community and consumers are eager to offer alternatives to the App Store. We will investigate to ensure Apple does not undermine these efforts”. The developers’ community and consumers are eager to offer alternatives to the App Store. We will investigate to ensure Apple does not undermine these efforts Margrethe Vestager, EVP for competition policy European Commission At the same time as it opened that investigation, the regulator commenced probes into Apple over its software policies alongside starting to look into the activities of fellow US players Meta Platforms and Alphabet. The maximum fine for infringing the DMA is 10 per cent of worldwide turnover with the level of fine able to be increased for repeat offences. It also has the power to “adopt additional remedies” such as obliging companies to “sell a business or parts of it” for systematic non-compliance. New investigation At the same time as publishing the result of its App Store investigation the EC announced it was opening a third non-compliance investigation against the iPhone maker over its new contractual terms for developers. As part of this assessment the EC will decide if the new requirements comply with the DMA, including by looking at its fee structure for developers of third party app stores and apps. Other elements under the microscope include eligibility… http://dlvr.it/T8jBBD\n\nThe European Commission today said it found that Apple is violating the Digital Markets Act (DMA) with App Store rules and fees that \"prevent app developers from freely steering consumers to alternative channels for offers and content.\" This starts a process in which Apple has the right to examine documents in the commission's investigation file and reply in writing to the findings. There is a March 2025 deadline for the commission to make a final ruling. The commission noted that it \"can impose fines up to 10 percent of the gatekeeper's total worldwide turnover,\" or up to 20 percent for repeat infringements. For \"systematic infringements,\" the European regulator could respond by requiring \"a gatekeeper to sell a business or parts of it, or banning the gatekeeper from acquisitions of additional services related to the systemic non-compliance.\" Under the DMA, developers must be free \"to inform their customers of alternative cheaper purchasing possibilities, steer them to those offers and allow them to make purchases,\" the commission said. But Apple's business terms prevent that, the commission found.

AppleInsider reports: The intention of the bill is that it will facilitate competition and reduce app prices. Japan's government reportedly believes that Apple and Google are a duopoly, and that they charge developers high fees that are then passed on to users. Big tech companies with App Stores will also prohibit companies from prioritizing their own services. Google is likely to be hit hardest by this. Violators will initially be fined up to 20% of the domestic revenue of the specific service that broke the law. The fee can increase to 30%, if the behavior continues. The Japanese government's Fair Trade Commission (FTC) will choose which firms to apply it to. Companies that will be regulated will be required to submit compliance reports annually. While it hasn't been explicitly said that Apple and Google must comply, It seems certain that the announcement that they'll be held to the provisions is imminent. The Japan FTC isn't expected to add any Japanese firms to the list. The law likely won't take effect until the end of 2025.

The deal was initially struck between the parties in September, but the agreement was filed late Monday night in a federal court in San Francisco. The settlement — which includes all 50 states — allocates a $630 million payout for U.S. consumers who utilized a payment system within Google’s Play Store that the state attorneys general alleged magnified prices for in-app purchases. The states accused the company of up-charging customers and restraining “trade in the markets for Android app distribution.” Google collects 15 to 30 percent of commissions on in-app purchases, which the states argued inflated prices higher than they would be if there was an open market for payment processing, according to The Associated Press. “The Complaint also alleges state-law antitrust and consumer protection claims. Specifically, the States allege that Google has unreasonably restrained trade and monopolized Android app distribution and payment-processing services through anticompetitive conduct,” the settlement agreement states. A majority of phones used globally operate on Android software and use the Google Play Store for purchases. Consumers who are eligible to receive part of the settlement will be paid automatically. Those who are eligible will receive at least $2, and additional payments may be issued depending on their spending on Google Play from Aug. 16, 2016, through Sept. 30, 2023. Google will also need to pay $70 million to the states in penalties and other costs, according to the court documents. The settlement still needs to be approved by a judge. Wilson White, Google’s vice president of government affairs and public policy, wrote in a blog post that the settlement “builds on Android's choice and flexibility, maintains strong security protections, and retains Google’s ability to compete with other OS makers.” As a result of the settlement, White said Google will allow app and game developers to implement an alternative billing system alongside Google Play’s existing one. “Android and Google Play provide choices and opportunities for innovation that other platforms we compete against simply don't – from allowing for multiple app stores and avenues of app distribution to piloting new ways for users to pay for in-app purchases,” he wrote in the post. “We're pleased to reach an agreement that builds on that foundation and we look forward to making these improvements that will help evolve Android and Google Play for the benefit of millions of developers and billions of people around the world,” White added. This comes just one week after a federal jury in California sided with Fortnite maker Epic Games in the company’s antitrust lawsuit against Google’s...\n\nApple changes up App Store rules in Europe once again as EU threat of non-compliance grows https://ift.tt/CqM6jZt Apple on Thursday announced changes to its App Store after the European Union accused the iPhone maker of breaking the bloc’s landmark new digital rules. The EU said the App Store terms prevented app developers from freely steering consumers to alternative ways to pay, making Apple the first ever tech firm to face accusations of breaching a new law known as the Digital Markets Act (DMA). Now Apple says there will be changes to comply with the DMA and address the findings of the European Commission, the EU’s powerful antitrust regulator. Brussels at the time said developers could only steer customers through a link in their app that redirected the user to a web page to conclude any contracts. Regulators said Apple placed “several restrictions” meaning app developers could not communicate, promote offers and conclude contracts through the channel of their choice. From the autumn, Apple said developers in the EU “can communicate and promote offers for purchases” wherever they want, for example, via an alternative app marketplace. But in Thursday’s announcement, Apple said the changes mean developers will have a new fee structure for customers linking out of an app for offers and content. For instance, developers will have to pay a five-percent fee on sales of digital goods and services made on any platforms within a year of a user first installing an app with the ability to link out to a different channel such as a website. Risk of fines If the tech titans modify their platforms in accordance with EU rules, they can avoid large penalties. The DMA demands the EU wrap up any probe within a year of its start. The commission told AFP it “will assess Apple’s eventual changes to the compliance measures, also taking into account any feedback from the market, notably developers”. The charges against Apple came after the commission launched investigations in March into Apple, Facebook owner Meta and Google under the DMA. Meta also faced formal accusations of violating the DMA in July. The DMA gives big tech a list of what they can and can’t do in business in a bid to increase competition in the digital sphere. For example, they must offer choice screens for web browsers and search engines to give users more options. The law gives the EU the power to impose fines of up to 10 percent of a company’s total global turnover. This can rise to up to 20 percent for repeat offenders. Apple also faces daily penalties of up to five percent of its average daily worldwide turnover if found to be non-compliant. Apple’s total revenue in the year to September 2023 stood at $383 billion. The Coalition for App Fairness, whose members include Swedish streaming giant Spotify and which has long called for Apple to open up its marketplace, dismissed the latest Apple announcement. “With the introduction of yet another confusing, arbitrary, and...\n\nApple's App Store Policies Charged Under New EU Competition Law: Apple is imposing unfair restrictions on developers of apps for its App Store in violation of a new European Union law meant to encourage competition in the tech industry, regulators in Brussels said on Monday. From a report: The charges further escalated a tussle between Apple, which says its products are designed in the best interest of customers, and E.U. regulators, who say the company is unfairly using its size and considerable resources to stifle competition. Apple is the first company to be charged for violating the Digital Markets Act, a law passed in 2022 that gives European regulators wide authority to force the largest \"online gatekeepers\" to change their business practices. After initiating an investigation in March, E.U. regulators said Apple was putting unlawful restrictions on companies that make games, music services and other applications. Under the law, also known as the D.M.A., Apple cannot limit how companies communicate with customers about sales and other offers and content available outside the App Store. The company faces a penalty of 10 percent of global revenue, a fine that could go up to 20 percent for repeat infringements, regulators said. Apple reported $383 billion in revenue last year. \"Today is a very important day for the effective enforcement of the D.M.A.,\" said Margrethe Vestager, the European Commission executive vice president in charge of competition policy. She said Apple's App Store policies make developers more dependent on the company and prevent consumers from being aware of better offers.

We know as gamers ourselves, this is an exciting way to engage through play with the GamesBeat content you have already come to love. Start playing games here. Apple has updated its terms and policies for app developers in the European Union, ostensibly to better comply with the EU’s Digital Markets Act. The new compliance plan allows developers to link to outside payment systems or promote other platforms — however, the new terms also have new fees that allow Apple to take a cut of each purchase. The company recently settled its antitrust case with the EU, agreeing to open its Apple Pay platform up to outside payment options. The new rules, which are available to view on Apple’s developer support website, list all of the various percentages Apple takes from each purchase, regardless of where it’s made. The fee structure is different for those who enroll under Apple’s new terms and those who are part of its existing terms. For developers who enroll under the new terms, Apple takes a 5% initial acquisition fee on all sales of digital goods and services made within a 12-month period after an initial app install, and a 10% store services fee for all sales made within a 12-month period after any install (that includes re-installs). For developers who are already part of Apple’s existing terms, they face even heavier fines for adding external links: 20% for a 12-month period after install (though that number goes down to 7% for App Store Small Business Program participants).

We know as gamers ourselves, this is an exciting way to engage through play with the GamesBeat content you have already come to love. Start playing games now! These new policies have already faced some criticism from some of the companies behind the App Store’s most popular apps. Tim Sweeney, CEO of Epic Games, said on X, “Apple continues its malicious compliance by imposing an illegal new 15% junk fee on users migrating to competing stores and monitor commerce on these competing stores.” Spotify said in a statement to TechCrunch, “At first glance, by demanding as much as a 25% fee for basic communication with users, Apple once again blatantly disregards the fundamental requirements of the Digital Markets Act (DMA). The European Commission has made it clear that imposing recurring fees on basic elements like pricing and linking is unacceptable. We call on the Commission to expedite its investigation, implement daily fines and enforce the DMA.” GB Daily Stay in the know!
