        "text": "Morten Christensen · CEO · Samsøposten\n\nOwner of a diverse printing company on a small Island between the Jutland and Zealand in Denmark has its challenges—or opportunities. Morten Christensen is the second-generation owner of Samsøposten, which essentially started as the local newspaper; however, today is a diverse business of print, textile, merchandise, and content creation—and as 'old-school' as a phone book. The company heavily depends on the mechanical, electrical, and engineering skills that Morten Christensen has, as he operates a combination of new and old equipment. We visited the company as part of our \"The New Offset Machine, that doesn't exist,\" he has two Koenig & Bauer 74Karat machines printing when jobs are too big for his HP Indigo machines. Super interesting to visit a company that, by many vendors, is off-radar, as the products Samsøposten needs are either too expensive or less aligned with the business he operates. Also a great discussion - not on film - about how brands don't offer service, parts, and consumables to machines acquired out of the, let's say, more traditional channels. Maybe a company that is more similar to most companies worldwide than most of us believe.

Köngeter introduced himself and his company, which he owns with his wife. In Southern Germany, Wirbelwild's name is a play on the words 'world wind' and 'wild.' Köngeter explained that they started the company because they couldn't find software to create highly individualized printing products, so they decided to develop it themselves. Köngeter and his wife, both from creative backgrounds, found repetitive tasks in pre-press work, such as calendar layouts, boring and risky. They wanted software to handle complex and creative printing tasks that existing software like InDesign or QuarkXPress couldn't manage. To achieve this, Köngeter learned programming, which allowed them to develop the necessary software and turn Wirbelwild into a company providing layout automation solutions. Köngeter introduced ManyPrint Solutions, a cloud-based layout automation software that processes data dynamically without predefined templates. The system can import data from various sources, adapt layout rules dynamically, and produce outputs in multiple formats, including printing PDFs, InDesign files, HTML files, videos, and audio. He explained that ManyPrint Solutions is open to various data inputs, flexible in layout generation, and versatile in output formats. He highlighted a product called the Running Diary, which generates personalized brochures with running route recommendations, maps, and individualized videos based on the user's location. Köngeter announced that Wirbelwild would exhibit at Drupa in Hall 8B, sharing a large stand with Konica Minolta.

Reitoft · INKISH\n\nThe media got the embargoed press release about 20 minutes before the information could be published at 16:00, December 6th, 2023 - which is BREAKING news. Of course, acquisitions between companies like Hunkeler and Müller Martini will always create headlines and have consequences. However, this is not just an acquisition, but in our view, a game-changer for several reasons. First of all, we believe it will change the dynamics in the finishing industry - and yes, initially only in the digital space. However, as the digital space continues to grow, the impact of a merged Müller Martini with Hunkeler can have huge opportunities. We are, in particular, curious about what this does to the long-time relationship between Horizon and Hunkeler - mainly because the two companies have worked closely together for years, and now the acquirer is maybe Horizon's biggest competitor - but it may also have other consequences as the biggest market for Hunkeler and probably Müller Martini, North America, have Standard Finishing as distributor for both Hunkeler and Horizon - can that continue? Or what will happen? All of these are speculations, and time will tell - but they are interesting - and an acquisition with further impact than most other M&As lately. Warm congratulations to Hunkeler and Müller Martini. Find the official press release below: Müller Martini and Hunkeler join forces for the future After careful consideration, the owner families have decided to merge the Hunkeler Group with the Müller Martini Group. Müller Martini Holding AG has acquired all of the shares of the Hunkeler Group. With this transaction, the Hunkeler family and Crédit Mutuel Equity have sold off all their shares to Müller Martini. The parties have agreed not to disclose the purchase price. Hunkeler AG and Müller Martini AG are both global market leaders with innovative solutions for post-print paper processing. Both companies focus a significant part of their innovative strength on the economical production of individualized print products within an automated smart factory. Hunkeler and Müller Martini have been very close for many years. The long and successful history began during the 2nd World War, when Hans Müller worked for Hunkeler as a mechanical engineer before setting up his own business in 1946 and founding the company Hans Müller / Grapha. These good relations have been maintained for decades. The local proximity in the Zofingen region and the already existing and successful partnership in the machine and component business form an ideal starting point for even closer cooperation in the future. By joining forces, both companies see great opportunities to bundle their innovation activities and to serve their global customer base even better in the future through joint sales and service activities. The two owner families have therefore decided on this strategic transaction that led to the acquisition of Hunkeler AG by Müller Martini AG. Bruno Müller: \"The graphic arts industry is constantly changing and regularly calls for new innovations. By combining the key components of the two companies, such as personnel, expertise and technology, we will be able to serve our global clientele even better with innovative solutions in the future.\" Stefan and Michel Hunkeler: \"There is a long-standing partnership between Hunkeler and Müller Martini and a regular exchange. The opportunity for the merger is currently greatly beneficial for both partners and our joint customers, as it will result in considerable advantages in a combined enterprise. This is also a strong commitment for the Zofingen region.\"\n\nPrinting United 2023 · Reporting from Müller Martini\n\nMorten here from INKISH, reporting from Printing United in Atlanta. If you notice the distinct blue-purple hue, you'll recognize I'm at the Müller Martini booth, a signature color of this Swiss brand. Not far from them in Switzerland is Hunkler, another exceptional company. While Hunkler specializes in digital paper finishing, Müller Martini excels in book finishing and saddle stitch products, and they're renowned in their field. Although Müller Martini was once a larger company, it's now more streamlined, profitable, and innovative. What's intriguing is their evolution from a leader in the offset realm to a significant player in the digital world, meeting its unique demands. Case in point: their variable binding equipment. Many print companies now use their machinery for 'books of one'. A notable example is Linemark in Maryland, which efficiently handles thousands of such orders daily. The booth is quiet as they're setting up for a presentation. Even though the equipment isn't running now, it's a testament to the power of trade shows like this. Attendees can see, touch, and discuss these machines with experts."
