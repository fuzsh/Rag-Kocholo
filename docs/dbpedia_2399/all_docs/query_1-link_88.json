        "text": "The brand GULA was founded in 2021 by me, Martijn Dorhout Mees (Amsterdam) and my best friend Gula; a two-year-old Vizsla who loves the outdoors but can also sleep for hours. As an active dog, but generally like any dog, Gula loves to run, play and occasionally get dirty... (you know what I mean). This lifestyle is difficult to combine when you, and therefore your dog, love beautiful products.....\n\nIt is for this reason that the idea arose to develop dog accessories that are affordable, accessible, durable and, last but not least, good-looking!\n\nAll our collars and leashes are made by hand (by me, Martijn.. not Gula) in our studio in Amsterdam. Tested and approved by Gula herself and now available for all four-legged friends!\n\nDid you know that... Martijn grew up in Indonesia. Gula is named after gula merah, which means brown sugar in Indonesian. Fun fact is that the goddess of healing and protector of dogs in Egyptian times was also called Gula!"
