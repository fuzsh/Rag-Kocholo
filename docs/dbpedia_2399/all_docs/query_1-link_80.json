        "text": "A\n\nEconomic behaviour on TV\n\nDr M.J. (Martijn) van den Assem (m), VU University Amsterdam – Economics and Business Administration\n\nHow do people make decisions when there is a lot of money at stake? I will use game shows to analyse economic behaviour. Some game shows are unique behavioural experiments by virtue of the large money prizes and the repetition of well-defined choice problems that provide answers to the debate about the external validity of conventional experiments.\n\nB\n\nLignin waste to valuable chemicals\n\nDr K. (Katalin) Barta (f), RUG – Stratingh Institute for Chemistry\n\nLignin is the largest renewable source of aromatics on the planet. Still, its chemical conversion is a real challenge. This research will find ways to break down the robust structure of lignin and convert this aromatic biopolymer into valuable chemicals.\n\nRaised bogs: valuable sources of knowledge under pressure\n\nDr R. (Roy) van Beek (m)\n\nRaised bogs contain highly detailed information about the landscape and human activity in former times. At present, this knowledge is being barely used, but meanwhile these areas are under severe pressure from agriculture, dewatering and climate change. The researchers gather high-quality scientific data and use these data to develop a vision of the future for sustainable responsible management.\n\nSpace-time symphony for two neutron stars\n\nDr (Sebastiano) Bernuzzi (m), Nikhef, FOM Institute for Subatomic Physics\n\nNeutron stars collisions are among the universe's most energetic phenomena. Such events are uniquely identified by the tiny gravitational waves emitted at acoustic frequencies. To enable future observations, researchers will calculate the gravitational wave symphony by solving Einstein's space-time equations using super computers.\n\nHow crowded is a cell?\n\nDr A.J. (Arnold) Boersma (m), University of Groningen – Groningen Biomolecular Sciences and Biotechnology Institute\n\nWe do not know how crowded cells are, despite the fact that this parameter affects various processes and can be at the root of diseases. The researchers are going to map this molecular crowdedness in the cell.\n\nWhat you read is what you hear\n\nDr M.L. (Milene) Bonte (f), Maastricht University – Cognitive Neuroscience\n\nLearning how to read is a crucial milestone in a child’s development and leads to alterations in the brain. The researchers conduct brain scans at different times during reading development. As a result, they will improve our understanding of how reading alters functions in the brain and why this is an obstacle for dyslexic children.\n\n‘Junk’ RNA and heart ageing\n\nDr R.A. Boon (m), VUMC Physiology\n\nAgeing is the main risk factor for cardiovascular disease. The researcher will study how so-called non-coding RNA (also known as ‘Junk’ RNA) contributes to heart ageing. This research aims to find new leads to counter heart ageing.\n\nC\n\nCause and consequences of trusting the sharing economy\n\nDr R. (Rense) Corten (m), Utrecht University – Sociology\n\nUnder which circumstances will strangers trust each other during interactions in the sharing economy, and to what extent does the sharing economy generate more social cohesion? This project will examine these questions using a mixture of methods: laboratory experiments, online experiments, digital user data and survey data.\n\nSilencing excessively liberal platelets\n\nDr J.M.E.M. Cosemans (f), UM, Molecular Biology\n\nA first myocardial or cerebral infarction increases the chances of a second infarction. Researchers have shown that the long-term release of platelet proteins can be the cause of this – despite modern medication. The aim of this research is to effectively curtail this release in order to find new reference points for medication.\n\nD\n\nDahmen New Diophantine directions\n\nDr S.R. (Sander) Dahmen (m), VU University Amsterdam\n\nDiophantine equations are equations whose coefficients and unknowns must be integers. They currently play a key role in modern theories of arithmetic and algebraic geometry. The researchers will design new methods that will finally make it possible to solve a large number of Diophantine equations.\n\nSeveral needles in several haystacks\n\nDr K. (Katrijn) Van Deun (f), Tilburg University – Methodology and Statistics\n\nTo measure is to know, and so we measure to our heart’s content: voting behaviour, income, education, age, BMI, opinions, overweight yes/no, our genome… Current statistical methods are inadequate for the integrated analysis of these kinds of data. That is why we are developing new methods that will shed light on the interplay between genetic and environmental factors in overweight people, for example.\n\nHiggs from Z to A\n\nDr T.A. (Tristan) du Pree (m), Nikhef, FOM Institute for Subatomic Physics\n\nThe Higgs boson was discovered in 2012 by CERN’s Large Hadron Collider. The physicist conducting this research will use the Higgs bosons to make precision measurements to study their characteristics, to search for scalar particles, and to attempt to shed light on dark matter – a new step in particle physics.\n\nF\n\nHow cabbage plants kill insect larvae\n\nDr N.E. (Nina) Fatouros (f), Wageningen UR\n\nButterfly caterpillars can wreak serious damage to food crops. Some wild plants have a special way of preventing this kind of damage, however: they kill the butterfly larvae. In my VIDI project I will study how this successful plant defence works. The acquired knowledge can be used to give crops sustainable protection against pests.\n\nG\n\nNanoBricks: building monocrystalline optoelectronics from welded nanocubes\n\nDr E.C. (Erik) Garnett, FOM Institute for Atomic and Molecular Physics (AMOLF)\n\nSolar cells have to be made of nearly perfect crystals of a specific shape to be highly efficient. Currently solar cells are usually cut from a large crystal, which is inefficient. The NanoBricks programme creates perfect crystals in the right shape by placing and welding small nanocubes like bricks.\n\nFrom active matter to artificial cells: a mechanical insight into the fabric of life\n\nDr L. (Luca) Giomi (m), Leiden University – Physics\n\nThe researchers will do theoretical research into synthetic cells, in order to understand hoe mechanical functionality comes to the forefront in living organisms.\n\nThe importance of personality in school performance\n\nDr B.H.H. (Bart) Golsteyn (m), Maastricht University – Economics\n\nThe research focuses on the importance of personality in school performance and how we can invest in it. Will students who are not endowed with a favourable personality perform better if rewarded? Will this curtail students’ ability to use their personality in other tasks? Does habituation gradually reduce the need for a reward?\n\nOptomechanical coupling on a quantum chip\n\nDr S. (Simon) Groeblacher (m), Delft University of Technology – Quantum Nanoscience\n\nAlthough mechanical vibrations (phonons) can be used as signals in quantum technologies, this has not happened convincingly yet. By using specially designed optomechanical crystals, these physicists want to get complete control of phonons and couple them to optical and microwave light particles (photons) on a quantum chip.\n\nOptimising the methodological framework for studies of the effects of medical interventions using routine care data\n\nDr R.H.H. Groenwold (m), University Medical Center Utrecht – Epidemiology\n\nLarge digital databases have huge potential when it comes to answering important biomedical questions. This research will develop the advanced methods needed to achieve this aim.\n\nH\n\nCrumpled sheets have surprisingly useful qualities\n\nDr M. (Mehdi) Habibi (m), University of Amsterdam – Institute of Physics\n\nTo design material with extraordinary qualities (‘metamaterial’), you need to use techniques like origami, for example, in which thin layers are cleverly folded. But crumpled layers and even wads have surprising qualities that can be used in a variety of ways. Physicists are researching the fundamental qualities of crumpled layers and will then use them to build metamaterial.\n\nWorking together on climate-proof cities\n\nDr J.J. (Jeroen) van der Heijden (m), Australian National University – Architecture and Public Administration\n\nCities are a driving force for climate mitigation. Authorities, industry and citizens are working together worldwide on innovative policy arrangements for climate-proof cities. This research will examine to what extent and which forms of administrative cooperation will most benefit the rapid and large-scale mitigation of cities.\n\nWomen of(f) the street\n\nDr D.W.A.G. (Danielle) van den Heuvel (f), University of Amsterdam – Institute of Culture and History\n\nMany historians believe that women disappeared from the streets between 1600 and 1850. This project examines whether this claim is true and which factors determined women’s access to public space in two different cities: Amsterdam en Edo.\n\nTwo ends of one world: bridging microscale cytoarchitectonics and macroscale connectomics in the human brain\n\nDr M.P. van den Heuvel (m), University Medical Center Utrecht – Psychiatry\n\nHow do the different levels of our brain interact to make one efficient brain? At a microscopic scale, neurons process information, but at a macroscopic scale, taken together the areas of the brain also create large communication networks. We will study how major brain processes, and changes to these during development, depend on the smallest parts of our brain.\n\nTracing the potter’s wheel in the Bronze Age Aegean\n\nDr J.R. (Jill) Hilditch (f), University of Amsterdam – Archaeology\n\nThis project aims to research the spread of the potter’s wheel in the Aegean region during the Bronze Age by studying the mobility of people, objects and ideas. This will shed new light on the way in which new, innovative techniques were employed in prehistoric societies.\n\nShedding new light on star formation in the early universe\n\nDr J.A. (Jacqueline) Hodge (f), Leiden University\n\nOne of the most fundamental questions in astronomy is understanding how galaxies form stars. Half of star formation, however, takes place behind clouds of interstellar dust. The researchers will use two state-of-the-art telescopes to unveil this obscured star formation in the early universe.\n\nEarly modern private partnerships revisited\n\nDr B. (Bram) Van Hofstraeten, (m), Maastricht University – Faculty of Law\n\nTo the extent that the numerous, more modest private partnerships from the early modern period in the Netherlands are studied by law historians, it nevertheless based almost exclusively on theoretical source texts, such as legislation and legal doctrine. This project, on the other hand, will search for the true legal nature of these partnerships by looking at more representative archival sources, such as partnership contracts.\n\nThe origin of familial hypercholesterolemia\n\nDr G.K. Hovingh (m), Amsterdam Academic Medical Center, Vascular Medicine\n\nFamilial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is a hereditary disorder characterised by an elevated LDL blood cholesterol level, which causes cardiovascular diseases. The cause in 5%-10% of FH patients is unknown. This project will map the multifactorial causes and consequences of this FH type.\n\nMINGLE: Modelling social group dynamics and interaction quality in complex scenes using multi-sensor analysis of non-verbal behaviour\n\nDr H. (Haley) Hung (f), Delft University of Technology\n\nPrevious research has shown that networks contribute significantly to people’s professional growth and careers. The aim of MINGLE is to develop new machine learning approaches that automatically analyse the quality of social interaction by observing non-verbal behaviour. This research will not only lead to a better understanding of how people communicate, but also methods to improve this communication.\n\nPreparing MFDEs for the modelling world\n\nDr H.J. (Hermen Jan) Hupkes (m), Leiden University\n\nConventional mathematical models treat space and time as a continuum, though it is sometimes more useful to view them as granular. The mathematicians will research what this means for several important patterns that are commonly found in computer calculations and in nature.\n\nI\n\nEncoding, reconstructing and comparing complex evolutionary scenarios\n\nDr L.J.J. (Leo) van Iersel (m), Delft University of Technology\n\nThe relationships between different species of plants, bacteria and fungi form a complex network. Mathematicians are now examining how we can combine knowledge about small parts of these networks to identify larger networks.\n\nThe Himalayas: an unknown water tower\n\nDr W.W. (Walter) Immerzeel (m), Utrecht University – Geosciences\n\n‘Himalaya’ means ‘house of snow’ in Sanskrit, and meltwater is of paramount importance to millions of people in Asia. We know very little about the water cycle in this high mountain range, however. In Hi-Cycle, a team of researchers will use drones, measuring equipment and simulation models to unravel the mystery of this water cycle.\n\nMagnaData: massivising data centre scheduling to bring all data services to all people\n\nDr A. (Alexandru) Iosup (m), Delft University of Technology\n\nData centres are factories that produce (hosting) data services for our digital economy. MagnaData will develop groundbreaking resource management and scheduling techniques. These techniques help engineers manage increasingly larger datacentres, and address how social and sophisticated customers use data services. This makes data centres much more flexible and efficient, and improves customer experience.\n\nK\n\nOne muscle is not a muscle\n\nDr H.E. (Hermien) Kan, (f), Leiden University Medical Center – Radiology\n\nIn many types of muscular dystrophy, muscle weakness starts in certain muscles and then spreads to virtually all other muscles. I will examine what makes the muscles that stay strong the longest so different from the muscles that weaken rapidly. Knowledge about this is of paramount importance for the development of new therapies.\n\nOn the edge: theory and techniques at the frontiers of edge colouring\n\nDr R.J. (Ross) Kang (m), Radboud University\n\nA natural problem in a wireless communication network is to apportion all links among few transmission frequencies so no communication interference occurs. This translates into a mathematical problem called edge colouring. We study variations and strengthenings, and establish asymptotic, extremal structure using probabilistic methods.\n\nChanging shape: DNA unzipped\n\nDr J.H. (Jop) Kind (m), Hubrecht Institute – Developmental Biology\n\nTwo metres of DNA lies folded in the nucleus of every cell. The active DNA is situated in the middle; the inactive DNA is draped against the wall of the nucleus. The main question in this research is: what is the origin of this arrangement and what changes if a cell takes on another identity?\n\nIdentity crisis in a failing heart\n\nDr G. Krenning (m), University Medical Center Groningen – Pathology and Medical Biology\n\nHeart failure is caused by myocardial scarring. Cells in the heart’s blood vessels contribute to this scarring by changing their identity. The researchers have discovered a protein that inhibits the blood vessels’ change of identity. The researchers will examine whether activating this protein can stop heart failure.\n\nInside granular sludge – the effects of suspended matter on stability and activity\n\nDr M.K. (Merle) de Kreuk (f), Delft University of Technology – Sanitary Engineering\n\nWastewater treatment with granular sludge has turned out to be highly efficient. Suspended matter in wastewater, however, can break down bacterial granules, reduce their activity and even lead to process failure. This research will combine advanced analysis and modelling techniques to penetrate the mechanisms of influence in suspended matter.\n\nL\n\nHead-on collision: mapping DNA repair during transcription\n\nDr M.S. (Martijn) Luijsterburg (m), Leiden University Medical Center – Human Genetics\n\nProtein molecules that read DNA coding can have head-on collisions with DNA lesions. These collisions cause cell death, ageing and neurodegeneration. Using advanced microscopic methods and protein analyses, the researchers will study how cells handle these collisions, which proteins are involved in this process and how it helps to maintain chromosome stability.\n\nM\n\nUnifying millimetre wave antennae and chips\n\nDr R. (Rob) Maaskant (m) – Eindhoven University of Technology\n\nIn this research, antennae will be wirelessly connected to chips and, moreover, integrated into a single casing. This is a milestone for integrated millimetre wave systems in general and for power-efficient and low-loss antenna systems in particular.\n\nThe language of stories and the imagination\n\nDr E. (Emar) Maier (m), University of Groningen – Theoretical Philosophy\n\nYou read a newspaper differently than a novel. You expect true statements about existing individuals in a newspaper, whereas you are aware, when reading Harry Potter, that wizards do not exist. In this project, philosophers and linguists develop a theory to discover the fundamental difference between stories ad everyday language use.\n\nTowards a European legal culture?\n\nProf. E. (Elaine) Mak (f), Erasmus University Rotterdam – Jurisprudence\n\nEffective legal protection in the European Union requires cooperation between judges based on shared professional values, legal rules and work methods. This research will examine to what extent the judicial cultures in EU member states can develop into a single judicial culture.\n\nUnderstanding heterogeneity in neurodevelopmental disorders using normative models based on brain imaging biomarkers\n\nDr A. F. Marquand (m), Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Center – Cognitive Neuroscience\n\nPsychiatric disorders, such as ADHD and autism, are characterised by heterogeneity. The aim of this research programme is to develop a method to improve our understanding of this heterogeneity. This will increase our knowledge of the origins of disorders and lead to treatment strategies that specifically target what individual patients need.\n\nFrom political crisis of confidence to crisis of democracy\n\nDr T.W.G. (Tom) van der Meer (m), University of Amsterdam – Political Science\n\nThough politicians, journalists and academics have suggested for decades now that a decline in political confidence is damaging the stability of democracy, the consequences have never been empirically examined. This research project systematically tests the consequences and mechanisms of political crises of confidence at the micro (citizens), meso (political elite) and macro (regime) levels by means of experiments, content analysis, in-depth interviews and panel research.\n\nStudying paths through the pore labyrinth of catalysts\n\nDr F. (Florian) Meirer (m), Utrecht University – Inorganic Chemistry and Catalysis\n\nFunctional porous materials such as catalysts are essential for producing modern everyday life products. The materials’ pores form a complex maze that influences their macroscopic properties. This project will explore how matter travels through this labyrinth and relate this to catalyst performance.\n\nThe hidden role of canyons\n\nDr F. (Furu) Mienis (f), NIOZ Royal Netherlands Institute for Sea Research – Ocean Systems\n\nThe aim of this research is to determine the importance of transporting carbon via underwater canyons between coast and deep sea, and the role canyons play in (temporarily) storing carbon. Carbon storage via lateral transport is still an unknown factor in the global marine carbon cycle, which has a major impact on our climate.\n\nSAMURAI (Steering Actuated Probes for Targeted Interventions)\n\nProf. S. (Sarthak) Misra (m), University Medical Center Groningen – Biomedical Engineering\n\nProbes are often used in diagnostics and the administration of medicines. These generally inflexible instruments often miss their target, which results in complications. SAMURAI will develop flexible, robot-driven probes that can reach difficult locations in the body, which will improve both patient comfort and clinical results.\n\nCombining targeted compounds in neuroblastoma tumours: is two better than one?\n\nDr J.J. Molenaar (m), Amsterdam Academic Medical Center – Oncology\n\nNeuroblastoma are paediatric tumours that kill more than 50% of the patients. New medicines are being developed to target this problem, but as monotherapies they will not be able to cure patients. Now we want to use model systems to show that by combining these medicines we can develop cures.\n\nSupramolecular catalysts for the one-pot selective synthesis of carbohydrate derivatives\n\nDr T.J. (Tiddo) Mooibroek (m), University of Amsterdam – Van ‘t Hoff Institute for Molecular Sciences\n\nIt is difficult and expensive to make the sugar molecules needed for research into processes such as infections and cancer. The catalysts that these researchers are going to use will make this a great deal easier and less expensive.\n\nN\n\nBlack hole births: measuring extreme astrophysics in the dynamic universe\n\nDr S.M. (Samaya) Nissanke (f), Radboud University\n\nBlack holes and gravitational radiation are the most fascinating predictions or Einstein’s relativity theory. The researchers want to monitor the birth of black holes live for the first time by detecting waves in space-time or gravitational radiation and combining these findings with measurements from the spectacular corresponding flashes of light.\n\nO\n\nMolecular insight into alcohol addiction\n\nDr M.C. (Michel) van den Oever, (m), VU University Amsterdam – Molecular and Cellular Neurobiology\n\nAlcohol relapse is often triggered by environmental factors that act as a reminder of its pleasant effects. The researchers will use new advanced techniques to study how an alcohol memory is recorded by small populations of nerve cells in the brain and how these specific memories can be blocked to prevent relapse.\n\nShaping nanomaterials for future electronics\n\nDr C. (Carmine) Ortix (m), Utrecht University, Institute for Theoretical Physics\n\nSemiconductor nanomembranes – sheets of materials with nanoscale thicknesses – can be rolled or folded into a variety of curved geometric shapes, such as spirals and helices. Researchers will investigate how quantum effects in these curved nanoarchitectures can make new electronics possible.\n\nP\n\nGood start for preterm babies\n\nDr A. B. te Pas (m), Leiden University Medical Center – Neonatology\n\nPreterm babies often need help breathing during birth to survive, but that is when they are most vulnerable. At the Leiden University Medical Center, we will research how best to administer this aid to prevent damage from occurring.\n\nThe fate of sea butterflies in acidic oceans\n\nDr K.T.C.A. (Katja) Peijnenburg (f), Naturalis – Marine Zoology\n\nSea butterflies, sea angels and elephant snails are special groups of snails that have adapted to life in the open ocean. The oceans, however, are changing more rapidly by the day: they are becoming warmer and more acidic. The question is whether these spectacular snails will be able to adapt and whether they will keep their shells.\n\nUnwanted souvenirs\n\nDr J. Penders (m), Maastricht University Medical Center – Medical Microbiology and Epidemiology\n\nIt is becoming increasingly common for Dutch people to travel to countries where antibiotic-resistant bacteria are pervasive. This research will study the prevention and spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria among the Vietnamese population and among Dutch travellers to Vietnam and other countries where antibiotic-resistant bacteria are common. The researchers will use molecular techniques to track down antibiotic-resistance in the intestinal flora.\n\nTracking down the Tocharians\n\nDr M. (Michaël) Peyrot (m), Leiden University – Linguistics\n\nTocharian is known to us through manuscripts from 500–1000 BC from northwest China. It is an Indo-European language, related to Latin, Greek and Dutch, for example. Speakers of Tocharian therefore had to have migrated from Europe to China. The researchers will ascertain the Tocharians’ migration route based on their contact with other languages.\n\nCicero through the ages\n\nDr C.H. (Christoph) Pieper (m), Leiden University – Leiden University Center for the Arts in Society (LUCAS)\n\nCicero is an extremely well-known figure from antiquity – in particular for his speeches and rhetorical essays. But why is this the case? This project examines how Cicero’s image in antiquity influenced how he was perceived later, both as a person and as an outstanding stylist.\n\nPromote diversity in local communities\n\nDr R.A.H. (Roos) Pijpers (f), Radboud University Nijmegen – Social Geography\n\nElderly care in the Netherlands was decentralised in January 2015. This research examines how municipalities, social district teams and local communities meet the care requirements of migrant parents and elderly LGBT people. It provides insight into local combinations of formal and informal care in which diversity among the elderly is recognised and acknowledged.\n\nR\n\nProtein, stay in shape!\n\nDr Y.L.A. (Yves) Rezus (m), AMOLF – Molecular Biophysics\n\nPrion diseases are brain disorders caused by the PrP protein. Pathologically folded PrP molecules cause healthy PrP molecules to misfold or aggregate, which generates a chain reaction in the brain. The researchers will use advanced laser techniques to study the molecular mechanism behind these diseases.\n\nI see, I see what you do not see: social attention for children with an extra X or Y chromosome\n\nDr S. (Sophie) van Rijn (f), Leiden University – Clinical Child and Adolescent Studies\n\nOne in a thousand children are born with an extra X or Y chromosome. Remedial educationalists will research whether developmental problems in the areas of language, communication and social behaviour in these children are related to reduced receptiveness to social signals as a result of heightened stress responses during social interaction.\n\nMonitoring top executives: internally or externally?\n\nDr F. (Floor) Rink (f), University of Groningen – Organisational Behaviour\n\nNowadays decision making by top executives is strictly monitored. But monitoring does not always generate the desired result. This raises the question, who is exerting the most influence on executives: internal or external supervisors?\n\nForbidden fruit: does mindset determine how your brain sees food?\n\nDr A. (Anne) Roefs (f), Maastricht University – Faculty of Psychology & Neuroscience\n\nThe western environment is called a fattening one because high-calorie food is so readily available. This food has two sides: delicious but unhealthy. This research will examine whether focusing on health versus enjoyment determines how our brains process food stimuli. A change of focus could make it considerably easier to eat healthy food (and lose weight).\n\nLegitimacy beyond consent\n\nDr E. (Enzo) Rossi (m), University of Amsterdam – Faculty of Social and Behavioural Sciences\n\nMany are suggesting that democracy is facing a crisis of legitimacy because it is being assailed from two fronts: from the supranational authority of the European Union, and from the transnational political power of corporations. This project will develop a new theory of legitimacy to face these challenges.\n\nAre stress hormones fattening and bad for your health?\n\nD. E.F.C. van Rossum (f), Erasmus Medical Center Internal Medicine – Endocrinology\n\nThe research focuses on whether the stress hormone cortisol is an important risk factor in weight gain and the associated complications of being overweight, such as diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. The research will also examine why cortisol levels are often higher in obese people. This can lead to new treatments aimed at reducing cortisol levels.\n\nS\n\nGetting better with age?\n\nDr S. (Susanne) Scheibe (f), University of Groningen – Psychology\n\nIncreasingly, people need to work longer. How well prepared are they to meet this challenge? In this project scientists will explore how emotional changes with age shape, and are shaped by, work experiences, and whether older workers have the emotional strength to help them to be effective at work.\n\nWhy 1 kidney at birth is not enough...\n\nDr M.F. Schreuder (m), Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Center RUMC – Paediatric Nephrology\n\nBeing born with 1 kidney causes problems such as high blood pressure and even kidney failure in adulthood. The single kidney starts to work harder to compensate, which wears it down. The researchers will try to work out why the kidney does this by means of studies in test animals. This will make it possible to tackle overcompensation in order to prevent problems later.\n\nLight. Catalyst. ACTION!\n\nDr W.A. (Wilson) Smith (m), Delft University of Technology – Chemical Engineering\n\nThe storage of solar energy with abundant resources can simultaneously address global energy and environmental problems. This research aims to find low-cost materials to convert sunlight and water into hydrogen (and oxygen), a potentially clean source of fuel in the future.\n\nSoil fungi intertwined with carbon sequestration\n\nDr N.A. (Nadia) Soudzilovskaia (f), Leiden University – Earth and Life Sciences\n\nSoil fungi, which co-exist with plant species, determine the soil quality and the amount of carbon in the soil. Different plant species exist with different soil fungi, however. A change in the plant or fungus composition can therefore have far-reaching effects. The researchers will use experiments and models to examine what the unknown mechanisms are that prompt these kinds of changes.\n\nSexuality and the making of the middle class. A comparative study of desire and status in three African countries\n\nDr R. (Rachel) Spronk (f), University of Amsterdam – Faculty of Social and Behavioural Sciences\n\nWhile global media have 'discovered' an emerging middle classes in Africa, this project will investigate their historical roots by focusing on the four contentious questions of homosexuality, female circumcision, polygyny and bridewealth. It will study the interface between sexuality and the middle class, examining problematic assumptions behind both terms, and theorise the middle class as a desirable position and thus as a classification in the making, emerging from (shifting) ideas of distinction.\n\nComputer simulations improve design of wind farms\n\nDr R.J.A.M. (Richard) Stevens (m), University of Twente – Physics of Fluids\n\nDepending on the wind conditions, large wind farms can severely hamper the generation of electricity as a result of the wake effect from other turbines. We will use major computer simulations to analyse these effects in detail and then translate this knowledge into simple physical models, which can be used to optimise wind farms.\n\nScalable ‘big data’ methods towards personalised genome diagnostics\n\nDr M.A. Swertz (m), University Medical Center Groningen – Genetics\n\nNew ‘NGS’ techniques can now measure all DNA variations in one go. Unfortunately the diagnoses cannot keep up because the genetic labs are drowning in all these data. It used to be that only one gene was tested at a time. This project will develop patient-oriented techniques to find harmful mutations more quickly and more easily for personalised whole genome diagnostics.\n\nT\n\nDigital vigilantism\n\nDr D. (Daniel) Trottier (m), EUR – Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication (ESHCC)\n\nDigital media put citizens in a position to persecute people by exposing them in a harmful way. This practice builds on previous forms of vigilantism, and technological progress and the user culture determine what is acceptable. It poses a challenge for scientists, users, the police and policymakers.\n\nU\n\nOne child’s head, two languages\n\nDr S. (Sharon) Unsworth (f), RU – Centre for Language Studies\n\nYoung children are highly capable of learning two languages simultaneously, but to what extent do they separate their two languages? This research identifies how and why two languages in a single child’s head can affect each other.\n\nV\n\nRobot assistance for human balance\n\nDr H. (Heike) Vallery (f), Delft University of Technology, Mechanical Engineering\n\nMy research group wants to develop small robotic lightweight support tools for people with balance problems. This will become possible thanks to new drives with gyroscopic technology. These drives are extremely light and compact and can be put in backpacks, shoes or limb prosthetics.\n\nLess noise: the key to a silicon quantum computer\n\nDr M. (Menno) Veldhorst (m), Delft University of Technology – QuTech\n\nDespite great progress, a practical quantum computer is still not a reality. These physicists are opting for widely used building materials and thus will try to create more reliable building blocks than ever before for a quantum computer by tackling harmful noise at the source, reducing the need for cooling and developing the first scalable quantum architecture.\n\nThe microscope that sees through everything\n\nDr I. M. (Ivo) Vellekoop (m), University of Twente – MIRA Institute for Biomedical Engineering and Technical Medicine\n\nA microscope enables you to see exactly what is happening in a cell. But it is not possible to look at a cell in a tumour or deep in the brain, because these membranes are opaque. This project provides a solution for looking straight through opaque membranes.\n\nDoes a lack of oxygen explain how rises in temperature affect cold-blooded animals?\n\nDr W.C.E.P. (Wilco) Verberk (m), Radboud University Nijmegen – Animal Ecology and Physiology\n\nThis research project examines the effects of temperature on the metabolism, growth and reproduction of cold-blooded animals and focuses in particular on the role that the availability of oxygen plays in arthropods and fish. Understanding the occurrence of this lack of oxygen could explain global patterns of biodiversity and shed light on the effects of climate change.\n\nSponges: the cleaners of the coral reefs\n\nDr N.J. (Nicole) de Voogd (f), Naturalis – Marine Zoology\n\nSponges have a major impact on the quality of coral reef environments as a result of their symbiotic relationship with microbes. The researchers want to know whether the rise in pollution and acidification of the oceans will change the sponge-microbe symbiosis and influence the ability of sponges to keep coral reefs clean.\n\nAdvanced membranes, made in water\n\nDr W.M. (Wiebe) de Vos (m), University of Twente – Membrane Science and Technology\n\nMembranes are created to purify water, but they in turn are produced using hazardous and environmentally unfriendly solvents. This research will develop a method that makes it possible to create membranes with advanced characteristics entirely in water.\n\nW\n\nHow can we reduce global flooding in deltas and estuaries?\n\nDr P.J. (Philip) Ward (m), VU University Amsterdam – Institute for Environmental Studies, Earth and Life Sciences\n\nSimultaneous riverine and ocean flooding (in Thailand in 2011, for example) can have a devastating impact on people living in deltas and estuaries. This research reveals the impact of these simultaneous events on the global flood risk and evaluates potential strategies to reduce this risk.\n\nIntestinal bacteria against pneumonia\n\nDr W.J. Wiersinga (m), Amsterdam Academic Medical Center – Infectious Diseases\n\nIntestinal flora play a part in the defence against harmful bacteria. The researchers want to know which bacteria in the intestines help people to recover from pneumonia, and whether these bacteria can be used in treatment. Pneumonia is the most frequently occurring deadly infectious disease in the world.\n\nVisual communication of material properties\n\nDr M.W.A. Wijntjes (m), TU Delft – Industrial Design Engineering\n\nPainters are extremely adept at conveying materials visually. That could be useful for us too, for example while doing online shopping. The only thing is, how do we make this artistic knowledge widely accessible? We are going to study this problem in this project by perceptually scrutinising 30,000 paintings.\n\nLaunching NanoMotors for disease detection and treatment\n\nDr D.A. (Daniela) Wilson (f), Radboud University Nijmegen – Institute for Molecules and Materials – Chemistry\n\nSynthetic molecular machines are self-propelling structures that require extensive work. But why not let the ‘motor’ build itself? Using simple building blocks the researchers will program them to ‘assemble’ into nanomotors while tailoring their structure, shape, and movement for disease detection, delivery of medicines and stimuli manipulation.\n\nHow DNA folding affects gene regulation\n\nDr E. (Elzo) de Wit (m), Netherlands Cancer Institute-Antoni van Leeuwenhoek Hospital – Genome Biology\n\nIn order to fold 2 metres of DNA in a cell nucleus with a diameter of a hundredth of a millimetre, it has to be folded extremely efficiently. Using genomics and computational analysis, I will examine which proteins are involved in this process. This can shed new light on the function of these proteins.\n\nMolecular tools for phospholipases\n\nDr M.D. (Martin) Witte (m), University of Groningen – Chemical Biology\n\nEnzymes involved in remodelling the cell membranes of phospholipases play an important part in transmitting signals and creating organelles. The research will focus on developing molecular tools that can be used to study these processes.\n\nThe heart of the crimmigation matter\n\nDr M.A.H. (Maartje) van der Woude LLM MSc (f), Leiden University – Jurisprudence, Criminal Law & Criminology\n\nEU countries are struggling with open borders and the associated risk of potentially dangerous or undesirable groups moving effortlessly throughout Europe. This project examines the way in which EU member states handle this dilemma in their development of concrete measures, but also how border communities experience the authorities’ approach.\n\nY\n\nBuilding life brick by brick\n\nDr H. (Hyun) Youk (m), Delft University of Technology – Bionanoscience\n\nComplex animals arise from simple molecules. How physics allows complex life forms to emerge from simple molecules is a mystery. The researchers will address this question by glueing together molecules and cells, one by one, to build living structures.\n\nZ\n\nWhen will the ice caps melt?\n\nDr M. (Martin) Ziegler (m), Utrecht University – Geosciences\n\nMeasuring the composition of isotopes can determine what the temperature was during the formation of calcium carbonate. This project uses this technique to unravel the deep-sea temperature and variations in the sea level over past 65 million years. These data will make it possible to make better predictions about the future of the polar ice caps."
