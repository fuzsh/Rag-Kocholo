        "text": "Samstag, 20. April 2013> Neue Arbeiten an der Save&Destroy Art Show in Zürich\n\nSAVE & DESTROY was born to bring Kaiju and toy culture to Spain, a country where art toys are not well known. The first three exhibitions were located at Comic Conventions, where many people gather to enjoy different kinds of art.\n\nNow, it is time to bring SAVE & DESTROY to the world outside Spain, starting with Zurich in Switzerland. Together with Beatrice Seifert from Galerie Maurer and Martijn De Zwart from KaijuMonster Blog, Javier Jimenez, the creator of SAVE & DESTROY, decided to host the fourth show at Galerie Maurer in Zurich.\n\nVernissage:Samstag, 20. April 2013 11:00 – 18:00."
