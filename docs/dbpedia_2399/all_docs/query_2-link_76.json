        "text": "Mutations with large fitness benefits and mutations occurring at high rates may both cause parallel evolution, but their contribution is predicted to depend on population size. Moreover, high-rate and large-benefit mutations may have different long-term adaptive consequences. We show that small and 100-fold larger bacterial populations evolve resistance to a β-lactam antibiotic by using similar numbers, but different types of mutations. Small populations frequently substitute similar high-rate structural variants and loss-of-function point mutations, including the deletion of a low-activity β-lactamase, and evolve modest resistance levels. Large populations more often use low-rate, large-benefit point mutations affecting the same targets, including mutations activating the β-lactamase and other gain-of-function mutations, leading to much higher resistance levels. Our results demonstrate the separation by clonal interference of mutation classes with divergent adaptive consequences, causing a shift from high-rate to large-benefit mutations with increases in population size.\n\nTY - JOUR\n\nT1 - Population size mediates the contribution of high-rate and large-benefit mutations to parallel evolution\n\nAU - Schenk, Martijn F.\n\nAU - Zwart, Mark P.\n\nAU - Hwang, Sungmin\n\nAU - Ruelens, Philip\n\nAU - Severing, Edouard\n\nAU - Krug, Joachim\n\nAU - de Visser, J.A.G.M.\n\nPY - 2022/4\n\nY1 - 2022/4\n\nN2 - Mutations with large fitness benefits and mutations occurring at high rates may both cause parallel evolution, but their contribution is predicted to depend on population size.
