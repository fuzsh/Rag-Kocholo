        "text": "Weâ€™re thrilled to announce that Made with Maude is now a Certified B Corp! This is a major milestone for us and marks the beginning of a new chapter in our journey towards making a positive impact in the world! If youâ€™re not familiar: B Corp is (a relatively new) business classification which is awarded to businesses and organisations that place people, planet and purpose above profit. It was important to us to formalize our commitment to doing business in a better way and to hold ourselves to account. Our B Corp status is what does that. Weâ€™re happy to say Made with Maude scored 97.6 on our B Corp assessment, which is well above the 80-point threshold required for certification, but thereâ€™s still room for improvement! Our score is most of all a testament to the hard work and dedication of the people we work with. So, this is also a big thank you to: Been Management Consulting, Esther Eijkemans and Sofie Snoek Your expertise has been key to our success. Together, we've made the right choices from the very beginning. Thanks for your support and knowledge. Elias Macovela: Your expertise and passion for sustainable wine production have been indispensable. Without you, we simply wouldn't exist. And a special shoutout to Linda van Egmond: Your knowledge, dedication, and support have been crucial from start to finish. Without you, this wouldn't have been possible. I'm immensely grateful for everything you've done to ensure our B Corp certification. Thanks to everyone who played a part in this achievement. Of course, to all our earliest ambassadors and our amazing customers who have embraced our mission and wines. Special thanks to our Business Friends: Herman de Boer, Janka Dekker, Daphne Lara Schipper, Hendrik Franken, Pieter Munten, Ellen van Hierden, Angelien Landstra - Majoor, Irene Iniguez, Joost la Housse, Moniek Hop - van Roon, Martijn Van Den Nieuwenhof, Catrien de Jong, Michelle Stradal, B Lab Europe, B Lab Benelux, Tessa van Soest and Ian Enserink. Here's to more positive change ahead! ðŸ™Œ"
