        "text": "At work we work with volume discounts because with more ordering is less transport costs! So honest for you and for us. The discount can be combined and is about the number of products you ordered from us.\n\nHow much discount can I get?\n\nNumber of products Discount 4 6% 6 8% 8 12% 10 14%\n\n* Can be combined with different products* services and customized options are excluded.\n\nThe discount will be automatically calculated at checkout!\n\nDo you wish to order more? Then you can always request a quote.\n\nFree shipping from € 30!\n\nDoes work also deliver abroad? Yes. You can also receive our products in Belgium, Germany & France. Without shipping costs from € 30 of course.\n\nDelivered quickly\n\nFor some products, \"ordered before 12:00, the next day at home\". This only applies to the Netherlands. For other countries, the delivery time is 3-5 business days.\n\nReturn\n\nNot satisfied with your article? You can return your item up to 14 days after receipt.\n\nWith work we care about sustainability. Returning has an impact on the environment, so we apply the following conditions: - Our full range can be returned, we only ask you to pay the shipping costs yourself. Articles from the refurbished, living living and workliving range can be returned for free because they are delivered mounted and must be picked up with collection appointment.\n\nWhy do we make a difference in this? Millions of articles are destroyed worldwide because they are returned with poor quality or the item simply cannot be sold again. Sin and harmful to the environment! Our articles from refurbished and our range, on the other hand, are taken back by our us, checked, where necessary refurbished and are offered again as \"second chances\". As a result, raw materials and therefore articles are not unnecessarily lost.\n\nFor quick processing it helps to register your return in advance. Mail the data; Order number, reason for return and any photos of product (in the event of damage) to support@workliving.nl. We help you further.\n\nSustainable shopping: How you can contribute yourself:\n\nBe well advised when selecting your product. Returning or exchange is always possible, but it is even better to make the right choice in one go. We are happy to help you with advice and tips. We inform you about the delivery day and the time that our driver comes by. Help unnecessary kilometers to reduce by contacting in time if the delivery time does not work out well or if we are allowed to deliver to the neighbors, for example.\n\nAnother question? You can always contact our service team, accessible via support@workliving.nl or call +31 (0) 85 00 41 412. In the case of technical defects or defects, contact our service team."
