        "text": "SECOND CALL FOR PAPERS In recent years linguistic conferences organized by the Białystok circle of neophilologists have established a strong tradition in terms of providing a forum for the exchange of views on the nature of language. It all started almost fifteen years ago, in 2002. The main aim of the conferences was to provide a meeting ground for a wide range of scholars: linguists, literary scholars, foreign language teaching methodologists, to mention but a few groups of researchers participating in the events. The conferences explored the relationship between language, culture, and social interaction. They were often organized in cooperation with French language scholars. This year, we are launching a new series of conferences on theoretical and applied linguistics, which will be held in Białystok every two years, with the aim of focusing on various dimensions of linguistics as related to a large number of disciplines within the humanities, the social sciences, and the arts. The main goal of the initiative is to make a significant contribution to the study of language in connection with the realm of the constant changes occurring in today's world. Therefore, we are pleased to announce the first call for papers for the 1 st Białystok Conference on Theoretical and Applied Linguistics, which will be held at the University of Białystok, Poland, 7-8 December 2017. The conference is co-organised by the Borys Grinchenko Kiev University. The conference is intended as a platform for scholars from different disciplinary backgrounds, particularly in relation to various research areas connected with language, including cognitive linguistics, socio-and psycholinguistics, cultural linguistics, contrastive linguistics, translation studies, language acquisition and learning, philosophy of language, and philosophy of translation. The conference sets out to explore both empirical and theoretical findings in linguistic research, as well as their pedagogical usefulness. The special theme of the conference Between Theoretical and Empirical Models in Linguistic Research aims to focus the attention of all scholars interested in language on the process of negotiating between two crucial poles in linguistic research: empirical research and theory. In recent decades, there has been a strong tendency in linguistics towards a greater use of empirical data and empirical methods. It has also been observed that methodological know-how has become a specific point of reference in our thinking about linguistic phenomena in today's world. However, too little space and time is devoted to interpreting the empirical data as juxtaposed against the backdrop of various theoretical and philosophical perspectives which, at least in our view, might inform the methodology and provide a wider context for the logic of research and its criteria. Therefore, our aim is to identify empirical challenges in linguistic research and to stimulate a broad discussion that will encourage the conference participants to reflect upon the ways theoretical inquiry, including theoretical constructs of different disciplines within the humanities, might be connected to empirical research in linguistics and in translation studies."
