        "text": "It was my first big tournament in my new role in a sport that was/is relatively new to me other than being a fan. Getting a glimpse of how a tournament with 2100+ athletes and 202 teams is organized is mind-boggling, and this was only the start. They had city and side events for young and old, which led to a whole city being in the realms of Athletics. Then, to think that in 2025, we will host the European Athletics Indoor Championships in Apeldoorn. Amy Kortbeek was here to have a good look behind the scenes for this tremendous project that will be amazing! My content, press, and media team were in full effect these last weeks! This means Esther Singendonk on the press and media side, first pre worlds press conference at Papendal, and during the event, she guides athletes and coaches through the mixed zone (the place where media do their interviews) as well as other media requests on-site. As you can imagine, we had a busy couple of weeks as something's had happened :) Content-wise, we had Merle van Elzakker running all the channels from TikTok to Instagram, X, and FB, creating concepts & stories with the athletes and partners on the go, depending on how the tournament was evolving. She had, of course, a small team of people helping out with filming and taking pictures Lars V. was on her side most of the time, and BSR for all the competition imagery. Together with our partner ASICS Corporation we celebrated the first medal for TeamNL heptathlete Anouk Vetter in the ASICS house, together with family and friends. Special thanks to the ASICS team: Olivier Mignon Ryan Montgomery Paul Hartman for creating this with us. We also hosted a Friends & Family (of the Athletes competing) breakfast run to bring everyone together, share knowledge from parent to parent, and relax and enjoy a good morning at the ASICS house. For the fans, we created a TeamNL x ASICS Corporation Orange fan zone during the marathon to support Abdi; we wanted to bring as many Dutch fans together as possible! It could be that you have seen this pass by in the media. :) Jarmilla van Stralen was in the lead of all these incredible activations, and I think it's safe to say people had a good time. As this is already a good book by now, and I have experienced many more things aside from the above, like team tactics 400m Women with Laurent Meuwly and Vincent Kortbeek, to name just one, I think I will keep those stories for another day with a good coffee :) Thank you, team, athletes, coaches, and partners, for an incredible first tournament and on to many more to come!"
