        "text": "Letter to My Grandchildren\n\nWritten by Douglas J. Brouwer\n\nAs his forty-year career in ministry comes to an end, Douglas Brouwer finds himself wondering about one of the oldest questions there is: who am I? To find his true identity, Brouwer undertakes extensive genealogical research, probes the meaning of his family name, explores his ethnic heritage, asks what genealogies are for (biblical genealogies and his own), reflects on the meaning of his DNA testing, and tells sometimes-unflattering family stories.\n\nIn the end, he arrives at one of the most basic answers it’s possible to give about our identity as human beings created in the image and likeness of God. The Truth About Who We Are is written as a letter from Brouwer to his grandchildren, but the story is a universal one. The answer he discovers at the end applies to all.\n\nEndorsements\n\n“Every grandfather should write a book like this. It’s perfectly pegged for grandchildren, telling them who they are by lineage, heritage, patrimony—embarrassing or not—even DNA, and a grandfather who drove an electric car a hundred years ago. A cleric, Brouwer’s heritage is Dutch, Calvinist, and West Michigan, but anyone can use this book as a template.” —Robert P. Swierenga, Professor of History Emeritus, Kent State University, Albertus C. Van Raalte Research Professor, Van Raalte Institute, Hope College, Holland, Michigan\n\n“This sparkling gem of a memoir reflects on history, memory, and theology in a poignant, very personal way. Dutch-Americans, particularly from West Michigan, will appreciate Douglas Brouwer’s excavation of their native soil. More important, people of faith will appreciate his reminder of where our true identity and loyalties belong. A timely book.” - —James D. Bratt, Department of History, Calvin College\n\nPaperback, 98 pages, illustrated"
