        "text": "Tetanus in adult males, Bugando Medical Centre, United Republic of Tanzania.\n\nPubMed\n\nAziz, Riaz; Peck, Robert N; Kalluvya, Samuel; Kenemo, Bernard; Chandika, Alphonce; Downs, Jennifer A\n\n2017-11-01\n\nIn the United Republic of Tanzania, the incidence of non-neonatal circumcision-related tetanus is probably underreported. We analysed charts and extracted information on outcome and wound location for non-neonatal cases of tetanus admitted to the intensive care unit of Bugando Medical Centre between 2001 and 2016. Bugando Medical Centre, which is one of four teaching referral hospitals in the United Republic of Tanzania, has a 13-bed intensive care unit that manages all admitted patients with tetanus. Within the United Republic of Tanzania, formal programmes of tetanus immunization are targeted at infants or women. From our inpatient logs, we identified six patients with non-neonatal tetanus among male patients with a recent history of circumcision. Only one of these patients had been circumcised within a subnational programme of voluntary medical male circumcision. The other five had been circumcised outside of the programme - e.g. at small rural dispensaries or by a traditional provider with no formal medical training. The six patients were aged 11-55Â years and five (83%) of them died in hospital - all of overwhelming sepsis. Within the Tanzanian programme of voluntary medical male circumcision, education on wound hygiene probably helps to reduce the incidence of non-neonatal circumcision-related tetanus. The corresponding incidence among the boys and men who are circumcised beyond this subnational programme is probably higher. The training of all circumcision providers in wound care and a vaccination programme to ensure that male Tanzanians receive tetanus immunization post-infancy are recommended.\n\nSplenic injuries at Bugando Medical Centre in northwestern Tanzania: a tertiary hospital experience\n\nPubMed Central\n\n2012-01-01\n\nBackground Splenic injuries constitute a continuing diagnostic and therapeutic challenge to the trauma or general surgeons practicing in developing countries where sophisticated imaging facilities are either not available or exorbitantly expensive. The purpose of this review was to describe our own experience in the management of the splenic injuries outlining the aetiological spectrum, injury characteristics and treatment outcome of splenic injuries in our local environment and to identify predictors of outcome among these patients. Methods A prospective descriptive study of splenic injury patients was carried out at Bugando Medical Centre in Northwestern Tanzania between March 2009 and February 2011. Statistical data analysis was done using SPSS software version 17.0. Results A total of 118 patients were studied. The male to female ratio was 6.4:1. Their ages ranged from 8 to 74 years with a median age of 22 years. The modal age group was 21-30 years. The majority of patients (89.8%) had blunt trauma and road traffic accidents (63.6%) were the most frequent cause of injuries. Most patients sustained grade III (39.0%) and IV (38.1%) splenic injuries. Majority of patients (86.4%) were treated operatively with splenectomy (97.1%) being the most frequently performed procedure. Postoperative complications were recorded in 30.5% of cases. The overall length of hospital stay (LOS) ranged from 1 day to 120 days with a median of 18 days. Mortality rate was 19.5%. Patients who had severe trauma (Kampala Trauma Score II â¤ 6) and those with associated injuries stayed longer in the hospital (P < 0.001), whereas age of the patient, associated injuries, trauma scores (KTS II), grade of splenic injuries, admission systolic blood pressure â¤ 90 mmHg, estimated blood loss > 2000 mls, HIV infection with CD4 â¤ 200 cells/Î¼l and presence of postoperative complications were significantly associated with mortality (P < 0.001). Conclusion Trauma resulting from road traffic\n\nPattern and outcome of chest injuries at Bugando Medical Centre in Northwestern Tanzania\n\nPubMed Central\n\n2011-01-01\n\nBackground Chest injuries constitute a continuing challenge to the trauma or general surgeon practicing in developing countries. This study was conducted to outline the etiological spectrum, injury patterns and short term outcome of these injuries in our setting. Patients and methods This was a prospective study involving chest injury patients admitted to Bugando Medical Centre over a six-month period from November 2009 to April 2010 inclusive. Results A total of 150 chest injury patients were studied. Males outnumbered females by a ratio of 3.8:1. Their ages ranged from 1 to 80 years (mean = 32.17 years). The majority of patients (72.7%) sustained blunt injuries. Road traffic crush was the most common cause of injuries affecting 50.7% of patients. Chest wall wounds, hemothorax and rib fractures were the most common type of injuries accounting for 30.0%, 21.3% and 20.7% respectively. Associated injuries were noted in 56.0% of patients and head/neck (33.3%) and musculoskeletal regions (26.7%) were commonly affected. The majority of patients (55.3%) were treated successfully with non-operative approach. Underwater seal drainage was performed in 39 patients (19.3%). One patient (0.7%) underwent thoracotomy due to hemopericardium. Thirty nine patients (26.0%) had complications of which wound sepsis (14.7%) and complications of long bone fractures (12.0%) were the most common complications. The mean LOS was 13.17 days and mortality rate was 3.3%. Using multivariate logistic regression analysis, associated injuries, the type of injury, trauma scores (ISS, RTS and PTS) were found to be significant predictors of the LOS (P < 0.001), whereas mortality was significantly associated with pre-morbid illness, associated injuries, trauma scores (ISS, RTS and PTS), the need for ICU admission and the presence of complications (P < 0.001). Conclusion Chest injuries resulting from RTCs remain a major public health problem in this part of Tanzania.

The is a paucity of published data on paediatric injuries in our local environment. This study describes the etiological spectrum, injury characteristics and treatment outcome of paediatric injuries in our local setting and provides baseline data for establishment of prevention strategies as well as treatment guidelines. Methods This was a descriptive cross-sectional study involving paediatric injury patients admitted to Bugando Medical Centre from August 2011 to April 2012. Statistical data analysis was done using SPSS version 17.0 and STATA version 12.0. Results A total of 150 patients were studied. The age of patients ranged from 1Â month to 10Â years with a median age of 5Â years. The male to female ratio was 2.3:1. Road traffic accident was the most common cause of injury (39.3%) and motorcycle (71.2%) was responsible for the majority of road traffic accidents. Only 11 (7.3%) patients received pre-hospital care. The head /neck (32.7%) and musculoskeletal (28.0%) were the most frequent body region injured. Open wounds (51.4%), foreign bodies (31.3%) and fractures (17.3%) were the most common type of injuries sustained. The majority of patients 84 (56.0%) were treated surgically. Complication rate was 3.9%. The mean duration of hospitalization was 9.7âÂ±â13.1Â days. Mortality rate was 12.7%. Age of the patient (< 5Â years), late presentation and presence of complications were the main predictors of length of hospital stay (P <â0.001), whereas burn injuries, severe head injuries and severity of injury (Paediatric trauma score =â0â5) significantly predicted mortality (P <â0.0001). Conclusion Paediatric injuries resulting from road traffic accidents (RTAs) remain a major public health problem in this part of Tanzania. Urgent preventive measures targeting at reducing the occurrence of RTAs is necessary to reduce the incidence of paediatric injuries in this region\n\nSurgical management of inguinal hernias at Bugando Medical Centre in northwestern Tanzania: our experiences in a resource-limited setting.\n\nPubMed\n\nMabula, Joseph B; Chalya, Phillipo L\n\n2012-10-25\n\nInguinal hernia repair remains the commonest operation performed by general surgeons all over the world. There is paucity of published data on surgical management of inguinal hernias in our environment. This study is intended to describe our own experiences in the surgical management of inguinal hernias and compare our results with that reported in literature. A descriptive prospective study was conducted at Bugando Medical Centre in northwestern Tanzania. Ethical approval to conduct the study was obtained from relevant authorities before the commencement of the study. Statistical data analysis was done using SPSS software version 17.0. A total of 452 patients with inguinal hernias were enrolled in the study. The median age of patients was 36 years (range 3 months to 78 years). Males outnumbered females by a ratio of 36.7:1. This gender deference was statistically significant (P=0.003). Most patients (44.7%) presented late (more than five years of onset of hernia). Inguinoscrotal hernia (66.8%) was the commonest presentation. At presentation, 208 (46.0%) patients had reducible hernia, 110 (24.3%) had irreducible hernia, 84 (18.6%) and 50(11.1%) patients had obstructed and strangulated hernias respectively. The majority of patients (53.1%) had right sided inguinal hernia with a right-to-left ratio of 2.1: 1. Ninety-two (20.4%) patients had bilateral inguinal hernias. 296 (65.5%) patients had indirect hernia, 102 (22.6%) had direct hernia and 54 (11.9%) had both indirect and direct types (pantaloon hernia). All patients in this study underwent open herniorrhaphy. The majority of patients (61.5%) underwent elective herniorrhaphy under spinal anaesthesia (69.2%). Local anaesthesia was used in only 1.1% of cases. Bowel resection was required in 15.9% of patients. Modified Bassini's repair (79.9%) was the most common technique of posterior wall repair of the inguinal canal. Lichtenstein mesh repair was used in only one (0.2%) patient. Complication rate was 12.4% and it\n\nA Fibreoptic endoscopic study of upper gastrointestinal bleeding at Bugando Medical Centre in northwestern Tanzania: A retrospective review of 240 cases\n\nPubMed Central\n\n2012-01-01\n\nBackground Upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding is recognized as a common and potentially life-threatening abdominal emergency that needs a prompt assessment and aggressive emergency treatment. A retrospective study was undertaken at Bugando Medical Centre in northwestern Tanzania between March 2010 and September 2011 to describe our own experiences with fibreoptic upper GI endoscopy in the management of patients with upper gastrointestinal bleeding in our setting and compare our results with those from other centers in the world. Findings A total of 240 patients representing 18.7% of all patients (i.e. 1292) who had fibreoptic upper GI endoscopy during the study period were studied. Males outnumbered female by a ratio of 2.1:1. Their median age was 37âyears and most of patients (60.0%) were aged 40âyears and below. The vast majority of the patients (80.4%) presented with haematemesis alone followed by malaena alone in 9.2% of cases. The use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, alcohol and smoking prior to the onset of bleeding was recorded in 7.9%, 51.7% and 38.3% of cases respectively. Previous history of peptic ulcer disease was reported in 22(9.2%) patients. Nine (3.8%) patients were HIV positive. The source of bleeding was accurately identified in 97.7% of patients. Diagnostic accuracy was greater within the first 24 h of the bleeding onset, and in the presence of haematemesis. Oesophageal varices were the most frequent cause of upper GI bleeding (51.3%) followed by peptic ulcers in 25.0% of cases. The majority of patients (60.8%) were treated conservatively. Endoscopic and surgical treatments were performed in 30.8% and 5.8% of cases respectively. 140 (58.3%) patients received blood transfusion. The median length of hospitalization was 8âdays and it was significantly longer in patients who underwent surgical treatment and those with higher Rockall scores (Pâ<â0.001).

Historic evolution of health care has led to significant healthcare sector fragmentation, resulting in systemic inefficiencies and suboptimal resource exploitation. To attain a sustainable healthcare model, fundamental, system-wide improvements that effectively network, and ensure fulfilment of potential synergies between sectors, and include and facilitate coherent strategic planning and organisation of healthcare infrastructure are needed. Critically, they must be specifically designed to sustainably achieve peak performance within the current policy environment for cost-control, and efficiency and quality improvement for service delivery. We propose creation of a new healthcare cluster, to be embedded in existing healthcare systems. It consists of (i) local 24/7 walk-in virtually autonomous do-it-yourself Digital Medical Centres performing routine diagnosis, monitoring, prevention, treatment and standardized documentation and health outcome assessment/reporting, which are online interfaced with (ii) regional 24/7 eClinician Centres providing on-demand clinical supervision/assistance to Digital Medical Centre patients. Both of these are, in turn, online interfaced with (iii) the National Clinical Informatics Centre, which houses the national patient data centre (cloud) and data analysis units that conduct patient- and population-level, personalized and predictive(-medicine) intervention optimization analyses. The National Clinical Informatics Centre also interfaces with biomedical research and prioritizes and accelerates the translation of new discoveries into clinical practice. The associated Health Policy Innovation and Evaluation Centre rapidly integrates new findings with health policy/regulatory discussions. This new cluster would synergistically link all health system components in a circular format, enable not only access by all arms of the health\n\nMedical students' and patients' perceptions of patient-centred attitude.\n\nPubMed\n\nHur, Yera; Cho, A Ra; Choi, Chang Jin\n\n2017-03-01\n\nPatient-centred care can increase patient satisfaction and lead to better clinical outcomes for them, such as improved physical status and higher health-related quality of life. However, doctors' and patients' views on patient-centred attitude might differ and could be affected by culture and the community environment. To clarify the differences in primary care patients' and senior medical students' perceptions of medical students' patient-centred attitude. A total of 1,025 subjects-827 patients from primary care institutions and 198 fourth-year medical students from a medical college in South Korea-completed the Patient Practitioner Orientation Scale (PPOS). The students completed the self-reported questionnaire at the end of their clinical clerkship. Descriptive statistics, t-tests, and one-way analysis of variances were conducted in SPSS version 21.0. Firstly, sharing subscale scores were higher among patients than among medical students (students, 3.61 vs. patients, 3.76; p<0.001), but secondly, caring subscale scores were higher among medical students (students, 4.18 vs. patients, 3.82; p<0.001). Thirdly, PPOS total scores were higher among medical students (students, 3.90 vs. patients, 3.79; p=0.001). Finally, male students had the lowest sharing scores (F=6.811, p<0.001) and female students showed the highest PPOS total scores (F=5.805, p=0.001). Significant differences between medical students' and patients' perceptions of medical students' patient-centred attitudes suggest the necessity of educational efforts to overcome the gap between the groups.\n\nBirth centre confinement at the Queen Victoria Medical Centre. I. Obstetric and neonatal outcome.\n\nPubMed\n\nCampbell, J; Hudson, H; Lumley, J; Morris, N; Rao, J; Spensley, J\n\n1981-10-03\n\nA review of hte first 175 confinements at the Queen Victoria Medical Centre Birth Centre is presented. The design, structure and function of hte Birth Centre is described and the safety of the programme demonstrated. Seventy-four pregnancies (42%) accepted for Birth Centre confinement required transfer because of antepartum or intrapartum complications. There were satisfactory obstetric and neonatal outcomes in all pregnancies. The first year's experience has allowed a reassessment of the risk factors, which will permit greater use of the Birth Centre without any increases risk to mothers or babies.\n\nBirth centre confinement at the Queen Victoria Medical Centre: four years' experience.\n\nPubMed\n\nMorris, N; Campbell, J; Biro, M A; Lumley, J; Rao, J; Spensley, J\n\n1986-06-09\n\nA review of the first four years of the functioning of the birth centre at the Queen Victoria Medical Centre is presented. In that time, 1040 pregnant women were accepted for confinement there. Of these, 52 withdrew for non-obstetric reasons, while 470 were transferred to alternative obstetrical care--274 because of antepartum complications and 196 because of intrapartum problems. Therefore, 518 women were delivered in the birth centre. The care of the women is entrusted almost entirely to a team of midwives and this review demonstrates an enviable safety record.\n\n[Medical waste management in healthcare centres in the occupied Palestinian territory].\n\nPubMed\n\nAl-Khatib, Issam A\n\n2007-01-01\n\nMedical waste management in primary and secondary healthcare centres in the occupied Palestinian territory was assessed. The overall monthly quantity of solid healthcare waste was estimated to be 512.6 tons. Only 10.8% of the centres completely segregated the different kinds of healthcare waste and only 15.7% treated their medical waste. In the centres that treated waste, open burning was the main method of treatment. The results indicate that Palestinians are exposed to health and environmental risks because of improper disposal of medical waste and steps are needed to improve the situation through the establishment and enforcement of laws, provision of the necessary infrastructure for proper waste management and training of healthcare workers and cleaners.\n\nRegistered nurses' experiences of their decision-making at an Emergency Medical Dispatch Centre.\n\nPubMed\n\nEk, Bosse; Svedlund, Marianne\n\n2015-04-01\n\nTo describe registered nurses' experiences at an Emergency Medical Dispatch Centre. It is important that ambulances are urgently directed to patients who are in need of immediate help and of quick transportation to a hospital. Because resources are limited, Emergency Medical Dispatch centres cannot send ambulances with high priority to all callers. The efficiency of the system is therefore dependent on triage. Nurses worldwide are involved in patient triage, both before the patient's arrival to the hospital and in the subsequent emergency care. Ambulance dispatching is traditionally a duty for operators at Emergency Medical Dispatch centres, and in Sweden this duty has become increasingly performed by registered nurses. A qualitative design was used for this study. Fifteen registered nurses with experience at Emergency Medical Dispatch centres were interviewed. The participants were asked to describe the content of their work and their experiences. They also described the most challenging and difficult situations according to the critical incidence technique. Content analysis was used. Two themes emerged during the analysis: 'Having a profession with opportunities and obstacles' and 'Meeting serious and difficult situations', with eight sub-themes. The results showed that the decisions to dispatch ambulances were both challenging and difficult. Difficulties included conveying medical advice without seeing the patient, teaching cardio-pulmonary resuscitation via telephone and dealing with intoxicated and aggressive callers. Conflicts with colleagues and ambulance crews as well as fear of making wrong decisions were also mentioned. Work at Emergency Medical Dispatch centres is a demanding but stimulating duty for registered nurses. Great benefits can be achieved using experienced triage nurses, including increased patient safety and better use of medical resources. Improved internal support systems at Emergency Medical Dispatch centres and striving for a blame\n\nNot a Humbug: the evolution of patient-centred medical decision-making.\n\nPubMed\n\nTrump, Benjamin D; Linkov, Faina; Edwards, Robert P; Linkov, Igor\n\n2015-12-01\n\nThis 'Christmas Issue'-type paper uses the framework of 'A Christmas Carol' to tell about the evolution of decision-making in evidence-based medicine (EBM). The Ghost of the Past represents paternalistic medicine, the Ghost of the Present symbolises EBM, while the Ghost of the Future serves as a patient-centred system where research data and tools of decision science are jointly used to make optimal medical decisions for individual patients. We argue that this shift towards a patient-centred approach to EBM and medical care is the next step in the evolution of medical decision-making, which would help to empower patients with the capability to make educated decisions throughout the course of their medical treatment.\n\nA patient-centred team-coaching concept for medical rehabilitation.\n\nPubMed\n\nKÃ¶rner, M; Becker, S; Dinius, J; MÃ¼ller, C; Zimmermann, L; Rundel, M\n\n2018-01-01\n\nTeam coaching enhances teamwork and subsequently improves patient-centredness in medical rehabilitation clinics. Even though interprofessional teamwork is regarded as a crucial factor in medical rehabilitation, to date no evaluated team-coaching approaches are available for improving interprofessional teamwork in medical rehabilitation in Germany. Based on a systematic literature search and interviews with staff, managers, and patients of rehabilitation clinics, we developed a team-coaching approach that is standardized in its process but based on the individual needs and requests of each clinic. It takes a systemic perspective and is goal-oriented and solution-focused. The approach mainly serves to provide impulses to make use of resources within the team and to support a self-directed organisational learning process. It is manualized and can, therefore, be used by professionals aiming to improve interprofessional teamwork in their clinic. A multi-centre, cluster-randomized controlled study that was conducted to evaluate the team-coaching approach showed positive results. Team organization, knowledge integration, and responsibility can be improved, and, therefore, the implementation of the patient-centred team-coaching approach in interprofessional rehabilitation teams can be recommended.\n\nIntegrating public health and medical intelligence gathering into homeland security fusion centres.\n\nPubMed\n\nLenart, Brienne; Albanese, Joseph; Halstead, William; Schlegelmilch, Jeffrey; Paturas, James\n\nHomeland security fusion centres serve to gather, analyse and share threat-related information among all levels of governments and law enforcement agencies. In order to function effectively, fusion centres must employ people with the necessary competencies to understand the nature of the threat facing a community, discriminate between important information and irrelevant or merely interesting facts and apply domain knowledge to interpret the results to obviate or reduce the existing danger. Public health and medical sector personnel routinely gather, analyse and relay health-related inform-ation, including health security risks, associated with the detection of suspicious biological or chemical agents within a community to law enforcement agencies. This paper provides a rationale for the integration of public health and medical personnel in fusion centres and describes their role in assisting law enforcement agencies, public health organisations and the medical sector to respond to natural or intentional threats against local communities, states or the nation as a whole.\n\nInternational Medical Graduates and the Discursive Patterns of Patient-Centred Communication\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nWoodward-Kron, Robyn\n\n2016-01-01\n\nIn many Western countries such as Australia, international medical graduates (IMGs) play a crucial role in meeting health workforce needs.

Nursing theory structures thought and action as demonstrated by evidence of improvement in complex health-care settings. Nursing administrators selected Modelling and Role-Modelling (MRM) for the theory-based practice goal in their strategic plan. An action research approach structured implementation of MRM in a 1-year consultation project in 2001-2002. Quality of health care improved according to national quality assessment ratings, as well as patient satisfaction and nurse satisfaction. Modelling and Role-Modelling demonstrated capacity to structure nursing thought and action in patient care in a major medical centre. Uniformity of patient care language was valued by nurses as well as by allied health providers who wished to learn the holistic MRM style of practice. The processes of MRM and action research contributed to project success. A positive health-care change project was carried out in a large medical centre with action research. Introducing MRM theory-based practice was a beneficial decision by nursing administration that improved care and nurse satisfaction. Attention to nursing practice stimulated career development among the nurses to pursue bachelors, masters, and doctoral degrees.

Despite their importance in the settlement hierarchy and the key medical services provided from these centres, little research has focused on their issues of workforce supply and long-term service requirements. In addition, they are a critical component of the recent growth of 'regional' hub-and-spoke specialist models of service delivery. Methods The present study interviewed 62 resident specialists in four regional centres, seeking to explore recruitment and retention factors important to their location decision making. The findings were used to develop a framework of possible evidence-informed policies. Results This article identifies key professional, social and locational factors, several of which are modifiable and amenable to policy redesign, including work variety, workplace culture, sense of community and spousal employment; these factors that can be targeted through initiatives in selection, training and incentives. Conclusions Commonwealth, state and local governments in collaboration with communities and specialist colleges can work synergistically, with a multiplicity of interdigitating strategies, to ensure a positive approach to the maintenance of a critical mass of long-term rural specialists. What is known about the topic? Rural origin increases likelihood of long-term retention to rural locations, with rural clinical school training associated with increased rural intent. Recruitment and retention policy has been directed at general practitioners in rural communities, with little focus on regional centres or medical specialists. What does this study add? Rural origin is associated with regional centre recruitment. Professional, social and locational factors are all moderately important in both recruitment and retention. Specialist medical training for regional centres ideally requires both generalist and subspecialist skills\n\n[Are our medical centres for fitness to drive and firearms licences effective?].\n\nPubMed\n\nGarcÃ­a-Fortea, P; Estebaranz-GarcÃ­a, F J; Heredia-Civantos, M D; BermÃºdez-VirgÃ³s, A; RodrÃ­guez-Ortega, J\n\n2016-01-01\n\nThis article aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of medical centres in the assessment of medical fitness for driving and gun licences, as well as describing the differences between them. Using a crossover design and a representative sample of holders of driving and firearms licences in the province of Malaga during 2014 (363 reports for driving licenses and 626 for firearms licenses), an assessment was made of fitness report issued by the centres by comparing it with the records of the Andalusian public health service. The proportion of those that would not meet the legal eligibility requirements was calculated. An analysis was made of the origin of the disagreements as regards the information made available by the centres. The discordance in the assessment of fitness to drive was estimated as 15.4% (95% CI: 12.0 to 19.4), while for firearms licenses it was 2.7 times higher (41.4%). The origin of the discordance is related to the information provided to the centres, rather than the assessment made by them. The limited effectiveness of the centres in the assessment of fitness for driving and, especially, for firearms licenses, could be improved by increased monitoring of their activity, providing health workers with adequate training and access to healthcare records of applicants.

Reviews of recent MCIs suggest that trauma centre preparedness has frequently been limited. We set out to evaluate Canadian trauma centre preparedness and the extent of their integration into a regional response to MCIs. Methods We conducted a survey of Canadian level-1 trauma centres (n = 29) to characterize their existing disaster-response plans and to identify areas where pre-paredness could be improved. The survey was directed to the medical director of trauma at each centre. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze responses. Results Twenty-three (79%) trauma centres in 5 provinces responded. Whereas most (83%) reported the presence of a committee dedicated to disaster preparedness, only half of the medical directors of trauma were members of these committees. Almost half (43%) the institutions had not run any disaster drill in the previous 2 years. Only 70% of trauma centres used communications assets designed to function during MCIs. Additionally, more than half of the trauma directors (59%) did not know if their institutions had the ability to sustain operations for at least 72 hours during MCIs. Conclusion The results of this study suggest important opportunities to better prepare Canadian trauma centers to respond to an MCI. The main areas identified for potential improvement include the need for the standardization of MCI planning and response at a regional level and the implementation of strategies such as stockpiling of resources and novel communication strategies to avoid functional collapse during an MCI.

Despite their importance in the settlement hierarchy and the key medical services provided from these centres, little research has focused on their issues of workforce supply and long-term service requirements. In addition, they are a critical component of the recent growth of 'regional' hub-and-spoke specialist models of service delivery. Methods The present study interviewed 62 resident specialists in four regional centres, seeking to explore recruitment and retention factors important to their location decision making. The findings were used to develop a framework of possible evidence-informed policies. Results This article identifies key professional, social and locational factors, several of which are modifiable and amenable to policy redesign, including work variety, workplace culture, sense of community and spousal employment; these factors that can be targeted through initiatives in selection, training and incentives. Conclusions Commonwealth, state and local governments in collaboration with communities and specialist colleges can work synergistically, with a multiplicity of interdigitating strategies, to ensure a positive approach to the maintenance of a critical mass of long-term rural specialists. What is known about the topic? Rural origin increases likelihood of long-term retention to rural locations, with rural clinical school training associated with increased rural intent. Recruitment and retention policy has been directed at general practitioners in rural communities, with little focus on regional centres or medical specialists. What does this study add? Rural origin is associated with regional centre recruitment. Professional, social and locational factors are all moderately important in both recruitment and retention. Specialist medical training for regional centres ideally requires both generalist and subspecialist skills\n\nSevere Traumatic Brain Injury at a Tertiary Referral Center in Tanzania: Epidemiology and Adherence to Brain Trauma Foundation Guidelines.\n\nPubMed\n\nSmart, Luke R; Mangat, Halinder S; Issarow, Benson; McClelland, Paul; Mayaya, Gerald; Kanumba, Emmanuel; Gerber, Linda M; Wu, Xian; Peck, Robert N; Ngayomela, Isidore; Fakhar, Malik; Stieg, Philip E; HÃ¤rtl, Roger\n\n2017-09-01\n\nSevere traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major cause of death and disability worldwide. Prospective TBI data from sub-Saharan Africa are sparse. This study examines epidemiology and explores management of patients with severe TBI and adherence to Brain Trauma Foundation Guidelines at a tertiary care referral hospital in Tanzania. Patients with severe TBI hospitalized at Bugando Medical Centre were recorded in a prospective registry including epidemiologic, clinical, treatment, and outcome data. Between September 2013 and October 2015, 371 patients with TBI were admitted; 33% (115/371) had severe TBI. Mean age was 32.0 years Â± 20.1, and most patients were male (80.0%). Vehicular injuries were theÂ most common cause of injury (65.2%). Approximately half of the patients (47.8%) were hospitalized on the day of injury. Computed tomography of the brain was performed in 49.6% of patients, and 58.3% were admitted to the intensive care unit. Continuous arterial blood pressure monitoring and intracranial pressure monitoring were not performed in any patient. Of patients with severe TBI, 38.3% received hyperosmolar therapy, and 35.7% underwent craniotomy. The 2-week mortality wasÂ 34.8%. Mortality of patients with severe TBI at Bugando Medical Centre, Tanzania, is approximately twice that in high-income countries. Intensive care unit care, computed tomography imaging, and continuous arterial blood pressure and intracranial pressure monitoring are underused or unavailable in the tertiary referral hospital setting. Improving outcomes after severe TBI will require concerted investment in prehospital care and improvement in availability of intensive care unit resources, computed tomography, and expertise in multidisciplinary care.

Epidemiological data from poisons information centres enable characterisation of trends in medication errors occurring across the healthcare spectrum. The objective of this study was to characterise the epidemiology and type of medication errors reported to the National Poisons Information Centre (NPIC) of Ireland. A 3-year prospective study on medication errors reported to the NPIC was conducted from 1 January 2007 to 31 December 2009 inclusive. Data on patient demographics, enquiry source, location, pharmaceutical agent(s), type of medication error, and treatment advice were collated from standardised call report forms. Medication errors were categorised as (i) prescribing error (i.e. physician error), (ii) dispensing error (i.e. pharmacy error), and (iii) administration error involving the wrong medication, the wrong dose, wrong route, or the wrong time. Medication errors were reported for 2348 individuals, representing 9.56% of total enquiries to the NPIC over 3 years. In total, 1220 children and adolescents under 18 years of age and 1128 adults (â¥ 18 years old) experienced a medication error. The majority of enquiries were received from healthcare professionals, but members of the public accounted for 31.3% (n = 736) of enquiries. Most medication errors occurred in a domestic setting (n = 2135), but a small number occurred in healthcare facilities: nursing homes (n = 110, 4.68%), hospitals (n = 53, 2.26%), and general practitioner surgeries (n = 32, 1.36%). In children, medication errors with non-prescription pharmaceuticals predominated (n = 722) and anti-pyretics and non-opioid analgesics, anti-bacterials, and cough and cold preparations were the main pharmaceutical classes involved. Medication errors with prescription medication predominated for adults (n = 866) and the major medication\n\nExperiences of violence, burnout and job satisfaction in Korean nurses in the emergency medical centre setting.\n\nPubMed\n\nYoon, Hee Sook; Sok, Sohyune R\n\n2016-12-01\n\nThe aim of this study was to examine the experience of violence in relation to burnout and job satisfaction in Korean nurses in the emergency medical centre setting. Participants were 236 nurses in the emergency medical centre setting of three metropolitan areas in Korea. Measures included a general characteristics form, characteristics related to experiences of violence, the Maslach Burnout Inventory and the Minnesota Satisfaction Questionnaire. Data were collected from June 2013 to February 2014. In the prediction model, 33.4% of burnout was explained and 35.7% for job satisfaction. The greatest influence on burnout was handling violence, followed by verbal abuse. The greatest influence on job satisfaction was physical threat, followed by handling violence. The study shows that burnout and job satisfaction of Korean nurses in the emergency medical centre setting are related to experiences of violence such as verbal abuse, physical threat and physical violence, as well as handling violence.

Starting in July 2000, every birth at Kilimanjaro Christian Medical Centre (KCMC) in Moshi, Tanzania has been recorded in a separate database. The information is obtained through personal interviews with each mother, conducted by specially trained midwives, and supplied with data from the medical records. A secretary enters the data into the electronic file. Data are collected about the mother and father: education, occupation and living conditions, mother's health before and during present pregnancy, expected date of delivery, smoking and drinking (alcohol) habits, use of drugs, plus HIV and syphilis status (if known). This is followed by particulars on the delivery: spontaneous or induced, and complications; the child or children: weight, height and Apgar score, malformations and other diagnoses. Mode of birth: spontaneous or operative intervention. If perinatal death: when? Transfer to intensive neonatal unit? The mother's reproductive history (births, miscarriages, ectopic pregnancies) is also recorded, with outcomes. We describe the process based on more than six years' experience, including obstacles and how they were overcome. The registry serves as a monitoring tool, with a set of key activities and events being issued monthly, indicating changes and trends in, e.g., bleeding complications, caesarean section rates and perinatal mortality, as early warning signs. Monthly reports on key issues are presented. Confidentiality and data protection are key issues. Day-to-day recording of births is vulnerable to personnel shortage, whether from disease or holidays. Validation and quality checks leave the overall impression that the database is largely accurate and credible. There are plenty of opportunities for research. Clinicians and epidemiologists will profit from using the database to test hypotheses and clarify problem issues, to the ultimate benefit of\n\nSeroprevalence of acute dengue in a Malaysian tertiary medical centre\n\nPubMed Central\n\nDing, Chuan Hun; Rashid, Zetti Zainol; Rahman, Md. Mostafizur; Khang, NanFeng; Low, Wan Ngor; Hussin, Nurabrar; Marzuki, Melissa Iqlima; Jaafar, Alyaa Nadhira; Roslan, Nurul Ainâ Nabilla; Chandrasekaran, Terukumar\n\n2016-01-01\n\nObjectives: The aims of this study were to determine the seroprevalence of acute dengue in Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia (UKM) Medical Centre and its correlation with selected haematological and biochemical parameters. Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted from January to June 2015. A patient was serologically diagnosed with acute dengue if the dengue virus IgG, IgM or NS-1 antigen was reactive. Results: Out of 1,774 patients suspected to have acute dengue, 1,153 were serologically diagnosed with the infection, resulting in a seroprevalence of 64.9%. Dengue-positive patients had a lower mean platelet count (89 Ã 109/L) compared to the dengue-negative patients (171 Ã 109/L) (p<0.0001). The mean total white cell count was also lower in the dengue-positive cases (4.7 Ã 109/L vs. 7.2 Ã 109/L; p<0.0001). The mean haematocrit was higher in patients with acute dengue (42.5% vs. 40.0%; p<0.0001). Likewise, the serum alanine transaminase level was also higher in patients with acute dengue (108 U/L vs. 54 U/L; p<0.0001). Conclusions: Dengue is very prevalent in UKM Medical Centre as most patients suspected to have acute dengue had serological evidence of the infection. The platelet count was the single most likely parameter to be abnormal (i.e. low) in patients with acute dengue.

This study aimed to investigate these calls, specifically the medical issues leading to them and the pre-hospital units dispatched to the paediatric emergencies. We performed a retrospective, observational study on paediatric medical emergency calls managed by the EMDC in the Region of Southern Denmark in February 2016. We reviewed audio recordings of emergency calls and ambulance records to identify calls concerning patients â¤â15Â years. We examined EMDC dispatch records to establish how the medical issues leading to these calls were classified and which pre-hospital units were dispatched to the paediatric emergencies. We analysed the data using descriptive statistics. Of a total of 7052 emergency calls in February 2016, 485 (6.9%) concerned patients â¤â15Â years. We excluded 19 and analysed the remaining 466. The reported medical issues were commonly classified as: \"seizures\" (22.1%), \"sick child\" (18.9%) and \"unclear problem\" (12.9%). The overall most common pre-hospital response was immediate dispatch of an ambulance with sirens and lights with a supporting physician-manned mobile emergency care unit (56.4%). The classification of medical issues and the dispatched pre-hospital units varied with patient age. We believe our results might help focus the paediatric training received by emergency medical dispatch staff on commonly encountered medical issues, such as the symptoms and conditions pertaining to the symptom categories \"seizures\" and \"sick child\". Furthermore, the results could prove useful in hypothesis generation for future studies examining paediatric medical emergency calls. Almost 7% of all calls concerned patients â¤â15Â years. Medical issues pertaining to the symptom categories \"seizures\", \"sick child\" and \"unclear problem\" were common and the calls commonly resulted in urgent pre-hospital responses.\n\nKnowledge and perceptions of physicians from private medical centres towards generic medicines: a nationwide survey from Malaysia.\n\nPubMed\n\nKumar, Rohit; Hassali, Mohamed Azmi; Saleem, Fahad; Alrasheedy, Alian A; Kaur, Navneet; Wong, Zhi Yen; Kader, Muhamad Ali Sk Abdul\n\n2015-01-01\n\nGeneric medicine prescribing has become a common practice in public hospitals. However, the trend in private medical centres seems to be different. The objective of this study was to investigate knowledge, perceptions and behavior of physicians from private medical centres in Malaysia regarding generic medicines. This study was a cross-sectional nationwide survey targeting physicians from private medical centres in Malaysia. The survey was conducted using questionnaire having (i) background and demographic data of the physicians, volume of prescription in a day, stock of generic medicines in their hospital pharmacy etc. (ii) their knowledge about bioequivalence (iii) prescribing behavior (iv) physicians' knowledge of quality, safety and efficacy of generic medicines, and their cost (v) perceptions of physicians towards issues pertaining to generic medicines utilization. A total of 263 questionnaires out of 735 were received, giving a response rate of 35.8%. Of the respondents, 214 (81.4%) were male and 49 (18.6%) were females. The majority of the participants were in the age range of 41-50 years and comprised 49.0% of the respondents. Only 2.3% of physicians were aware of the regulatory limits of bioequivalence standards in Malaysia. Of the respondents, 23.2% agreed that they 'always' write their prescriptions using originator product name whereas 50.2% do it 'usually'. A number of significant associations were found between their knowledge, perceptions about generic medicines and their demographic characteristics. The majority of the physicians from private medical centres in Malaysia had negative perceptions about safety, quality and the efficacy of generic medicines. These negative perceptions could be the cause of the limited use of generic medicines in the private medical centres. Therefore, in order to facilitate their use, it is recommended that the physicians need to be reassured and educated about the drug regulatory authority approval system of generic\n\nMoving into the 'patient-centred medical home': reforming Australian general practice.\n\nPubMed\n\nHayes, Paul; Lynch, Anthony; Stiffe, Jenni\n\n2016-09-01\n\nThe Australian healthcare system is a complex network of services and providers funded and administered by federal, state and territory governments, supplemented by private health insurance and patient contributions. The broad geographical range, complexity and increasing demand within the Australian healthcare sector mean health expenditure is high. Aspects of current funding for the healthcare system have attracted criticism from medical practitioners, patients, representative organisations and independent statutory agencies. In response to the problems in primary care funding in Australia, The Royal Australian College of General Practitioners developed the Vision for general practice and a sustainable healthcare system (the Vision). The Vision presents a plan to improve healthcare delivery in Australia through greater quality, access and efficiency by reorienting how general practice services are funded based on the 'patient-centred medical home' model.\n\nIntraocular straylight screening in medical testing centres for driver licence holders in Spain\n\nPubMed Central\n\nMichael, Ralph; Barraquer, Rafael I.; RodrÃ­guez, Judith; TuÃ±i i Picado, Josep; Jubal, Joan Serra; GonzÃ¡lez Luque, Juan Carlos; van den Berg, Tom\n\n2010-01-01\n\nPurpose To test the performance of the C-quant straylight meter during the daily routine work in medical testing centres for driver license applicants and driver license holders in Spain. Methods Altogether 914 subjects, of which 376 younger than 35 years, 428 between 35 and 60 years and 110 over 60 years were measured with the C-quant in three medical testing centres (Barcelona, Zaragoza and Palma de Mallorca) in 2006. Technicians were instructed once and the measurements were done during the daily routine work. We recorded: age, BCVA, self-reported subjective blinding at night; and from the C-quant: straylight parameter (log s), measurement quality parameters (ESD, Q) and test duration. Results Total C-quant test duration increases slightly with age from a mean of 7 min (< 35 years) to a mean of 9 min (> 60). At first attempt, 82 % of all subjects produced reliable results (ESD < 0.12). The straylight parameter for this group was independent of ESD and ESD was independent of total test duration. The known age dependence of the straylight parameter and the weak correlation with BCVA was confirmed. The distribution of subjective blinding at night was very different between test centres. Subjects with âvery strongâ subjective blinding had significantly higher straylight values than subjects with ânoâ subjective blinding. Subjects avoiding night driving had significant higher straylight values than subjects driving at night. Conclusion The C-quant measure is reasonable fast. Good subject instruction is important to get first attempt reliable results. Self-reported subjective blinding results depend strongly on the interviewer.\n\nDriving forces of biomedical science education and research in state-of-the arts academic medical centres: the United States as example.\n\nPubMed\n\nJohn, T A\n\n2011-06-01\n\nBasic science departments in academic medical centres are influenced by changes that are commonly directed at medical education and financial gain. Some of such changes may have been detrimental to or may have enhanced basic science education. They may have determined basic science research focus or basic science research methods. However, there is lack of research on the educational process in the basic sciences including training of PhD's while there is ample research on medical education pertaining to training of medical doctors. The author here identifies, from university websites and available literature, some forces that have driven teaching and research focus and methods in state-of-the-arts academic medical centres in recent times with a view of seeing through their possible influences on basic science education and research, using the United States of America as an example. The \"forces\" are: Changes in medical schools; Medical educational philosophies: problem based learning, evidence based medicine, cyberlearning and self-directed learning; Shifting impressions of the value of basic sciences in medical schools; Research trends in Basic Sciences: role of antivivisectionists, alternative experimentations, explosion of molecular and cell biology; Technological advancements; Commercialization of research; and Funding agencies. The author encourages African leaders in academia to pay attention to such forces as the leadership seeks to raise African Universities as centres of knowledge that have a major role in acquiring, preserving, imparting, and utilizing knowledge.\n\nSurgical management of vascular anomalies in children at a tertiary care hospital in a resource-limited setting: a Tanzanian experience with 134 patients.\n\nPubMed\n\nChalya, Phillipo L; Kayange, Neema M; Rambau, Peter F; Manyama, Mange; Gilyoma, Japhet M\n\n2015-11-30\n\nVascular anomalies pose major diagnostic and therapeutic challenges among pediatricians and pediatric surgeons practicing in resource limited countries. There is paucity of published data regarding this subject in Tanzania and Bugando Medical Centre in particular. This study describes our experiences on the challenges and outcome of surgical management of childhood vascular anomalies in our environment. Between January 2009 and December 2013, a prospective study on the surgical management of vascular anomalies was undertaken at Bugando Medical Centre. A total of 134 patients (M; F = 1:2.5) were studied. The median age at presentation was 6 years. Of the 134 patients, 101 (75.4%) were diagnosed as having vascular tumors and 33 (24.6%) had vascular malformations. The head and the neck were the most frequent anatomical site recorded as having a tumor (56.7% of patients). Out of 134 patients, 129 (96.3%) underwent surgical treatment. Failure to respond to non-operative treatment (86.8%), huge disfiguring/obstructing mass (4.7%), infection (3.1%), ulceration (3.1%) and hemorrhage (2.3%) were indications for surgical intervention. Tumor excision and primary wound closure was the most common type of surgical procedure performed in 80.6% of patients. Surgical site infection was the most frequent complications accounting for 33.8% of cases. Mortality rate was 1.5%. Tumor excision and primary wound closure gave better outcome compared with other surgical options (p < 0.001). Outcome of injection sclerotherapy in 3 (3.7%) children, serial ligation of feeder vessels employed in 2 (1.6%), and conservative treatment in 5 (3.7%), were poor and required conversion to surgical excision. Despite low mortality rate recorded in this study, but ugly scar, 14 (20.6%) and limb deformity, 6 (8.8%) were problems. The overall result of surgical treatment at the end of follow up period was excellent in 108 (87.1%) patients.

Quantitatively, the university medical centres (UMCs) deliver about 40â% of the total number of scientific publications of this research. Analysis of the bibliometric output data of the UMCs shows that their research is highly cited. These output-based analyses also indicate the high impact of cardiovascular scientific research in these centres, illustrating the strength of this research in the Netherlands. A set of six joint national cardiovascular research topics selected by the UMCs can be recognised. At the top are heart failure, rhythm disorder research and atherosclerosis. National collaboration of top scientists in consortia in these three areas is successful in acquiring funding of large-scale programs. Our observations suggest that funding national consortia of experts focused on a few selected research topics may increase the international competitiveness of cardiovascular research in the Netherlands.\n\nThe Clinical Librarian and the Patient: Report of a Project at McMaster University Medical Centre.\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nMarshall, Joanne G.; Hamilton, John D.\n\nIn June 1975 a clinical librarian project was initiated in the Gastroenterology Programme of McMaster University Medical Centre (MUMC).

The aim of this article is to evaluate the multidisciplinary training organised by the author there, to exchange information and to provide suggestions for improvement and development. Description of the training scheme and analysis of routinely collected management data. The training scheme is based on adult education principles with a focus on interactive learning. Over the period November 2005-July 2010 a total of 1201 members of staff from various disciplines participated in 86 documented training sessions. The majority of the attending staff considered the training to be relevant, interesting and well presented. A substantial proportion indicated that they would change their practice as a result of the training. These views remained stable over time. The majority of facilitators consisted of medical centre employees. This article provides an overview onfive years of multidisciplinary training in a general practice setting. Overall feedback from staff suggests that the training has been highly valued over those years. However, it is recognised that this evaluation has its limitations and suggestions are made regarding how these types of training schemes can be improved and developed further.\n\nIs cost-effective healthcare compatible with publicly financed academic medical centres?\n\nPubMed\n\nChia, Whay Kuang; Toh, Han Chong\n\n2013-01-01\n\nProbably more than any country, Singapore has made significant investment into the biomedical enterprise as a proportion of its economy and size. This focus recently witnessed a shift towards a greater emphasis on translational and clinical development. Key to the realisation of this strategy will be Academic Medical Centres (AMCs), as a principal tool to developing and applying useful products for the market and further improving health outcomes. Here, we explore the principal value proposition of the AMC to Singapore society and its healthcare system. We question if the values inherent within academic medicine--that of inquiry, innovation, pedagogy and clinical exceptionalism--can be compatible with the seemingly paradoxical mandate of providing cost-effective or rationed healthcare.\n\n[Accessibility barriers in the German health care system : Supporting and inhibiting factors when establishing medical centres for mentally and multiply disabled persons].\n\nPubMed\n\nSchÃ¼lle, Mirjam; Hornberg, Claudia\n\n2016-09-01\n\nIn addition to primary and secondary special care, aÂ special type of care was created in the 2015 German Health Care Strengthening Act [GKV-VersorgungsstÃ¤rkungsgesetz]: medical care centres for adult people with mental and multiple disabilities (MCAMD). This closed aÂ gap in the German healthcare system and part of ArticleÂ 25 of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities was implemented. Experiences from pilot projects are useful while implementing these centres. The issue is therefore: which are the supportingÂ (s) and inhibitingÂ (i) factors when establishing MCAMDs in the view of health care providers? Based on open guided expert interviews medical directors and initiators of existing and planned centres were interviewed. Data analysis was done by qualitative content analysis. Healthcare providers think reducing barriers in people's minds is most important. In the course of approval procedures, reservations from different actors and institutions were considered (i). During financial negotiations, health insurance companies requested aÂ characterisation of the target group using the ICD-lists, which doesn't comply with the needs of the usersÂ (i). Implementation was only possible with aÂ great effort from the initiators paired with willingness from actors of the association of statutory health insurance physicians and the health insurances (s). This paper describes the process used to implement MCAMDs. Potential centre providers can be inspired by these results. Further research on the process of implementation of these medical centres is needed, especially taking into account all involved parties.\n\nDevelopment of gastrointestinal endoscopy in Malaysia: a historical perspective with special reference to the experience at the University of Malaya Medical Centre.\n\nPubMed\n\nGoh, Khean-Lee\n\n2011-05-01\n\nGastrointestinal endoscopy started in the early 1970s in Malaysia with the help of Japanese doctors. It has evolved over the past 30 years.

What is true in the United States is also being fulfilled in Europe. This, though, is generally at a significantly lower investment level, even if for \"large\" capital infrastructure and interdisciplinary centers. Against this, the United Kingdom and its European partners are following the maxim \"small is beautiful\" and are attempting to identify and develop academic research and commercial businesses in areas that traditional nanotechnology developments involving engineering or physics find challenging. Thus in London-University College London (UCL) in a major joint project with Imperial College and linked to other UK and European centers of excellence-we are building upon our internationally competitive medical research (the two universities together form one of the largest centers of biomedical research outside the United States) to focus on and develop medical nanotechnology as a major sector of our research activity. A novel approach to commercialization has been the establishment with government and private equity funds of a \"BioNanotechnology Centre\" that will act as a portal for UK industry to access specialist skills to solve issues relating to developing nanotechnology-based medical applications, for example, for environmental screening, diagnostics, and therapy. This article reviews our academic and business strategy with examples from our current biomedical research portfolio.\n\nRedesigning care at the Flinders Medical Centre: clinical process redesign using \"lean thinking\".\n\nPubMed\n\nBen-Tovim, David I; Bassham, Jane E; Bennett, Denise M; Dougherty, Melissa L; Martin, Margaret A; O'Neill, Susan J; Sincock, Jackie L; Szwarcbord, Michael G\n\n2008-03-17\n\n*The Flinders Medical Centre (FMC) Redesigning Care program began in November 2003; it is a hospital-wide process improvement program applying an approach called \"lean thinking\" (developed in the manufacturing sector) to health care. *To date, the FMC has involved hundreds of staff from all areas of the hospital in a wide variety of process redesign activities. *The initial focus of the program was on improving the flow of patients through the emergency department, but the program quickly spread to involve the redesign of managing medical and surgical patients throughout the hospital, and to improving major support services. *The program has fallen into three main phases, each of which is described in this article: \"getting the knowledge\"; \"stabilising high-volume flows\"; and \"standardising and sustaining\". *Results to date show that the Redesigning Care program has enabled the hospital to provide safer and more accessible care during a period of growth in demand.\n\nStrengthening patient safety in transitions of care: an emerging role for local medical centres in Norway.\n\nPubMed\n\nKongsvik, Trond; Halvorsen, Kristin; Osmundsen, Tonje; GjÃ¸sund, Gudveig\n\n2016-08-30\n\nPatient safety has gained less attention in primary care in comparison to specialised care. We explore how local medical centres (LMCs) can play a role in strengthening patient safety, both locally and in transitions between care levels. LMCs represent a form of intermediate care organisation in Norway that is increasingly used as a strategy for integrated care policies. The analysis is based on institutional theory and general safety theories. A qualitative design was applied, involving 20 interviews of nursing home managers, managers at local medical centres and administrative personnel. The LMCs mediate important information between care levels, partly by means of workarounds, but also as a result of having access to the different information and communications technology (ICT) systems in use. Their knowledge of local conditions is found to be a key asset. LMCs are providers of competence and training for the local level, as well as serving as quality assurers. As a growing organisational form in Norway, LMCs have to legitimise their role in the health care system. They represent an asset to the local level in terms of information, competence and quality assurance. As they have overlapping competencies, tasks and responsibilities with other parts of the health care system, they add to organisational redundancy and strengthen patient safety.\n\nKey performance indicators' assessment to develop best practices in an Emergency Medical Communication Centre.\n\nPubMed\n\nPenverne, Yann; Leclere, Brice; Labady, Julien; Berthier, Frederic; Jenvrin, Joel; Javaudin, Francois; Batard, Eric; Montassier, Emmanuel\n\n2017-05-17\n\nEmergency Medical Communication Centre (EMCC) represents a pivotal link in the chain of survival for those requiring rapid response for out-of-hospital medical emergencies. Assessing and grading the performance of EMCCs are warranted as it can affect the health and safety of the served population. The aim of our work was to describe the activity on an EMCC and to explore the associations between different key performance indicators. We carried out our prospective observational study in the EMCC of Nantes, France, from 6 June 2011 to 6 June 2015. The EMCC performance was assessed with the following key performance indicators: answered calls, Quality of Service 20âs (QS20), occupation rate and average call duration. A total of 35â073âh of dispatch activity were analysed. 1â488â998 emergency calls were answered. The emergency call incidence varied slightly from 274 to 284 calls/1000 citizens/year between 2011 and 2015. The median occupation rate was 35% (25-44). QS20 was correlated negatively with the occupation rate (Spearman's Ï: -0.78). The structural equation model confirmed that the occupation rate was highly correlated with the QS20 (standardized coefficient: -0.89). For an occupation rate of 26%, the target value estimated by our polynomial model, the probability of achieving a QS20 superior or equal to 95% varied between 56 and 84%. The occupation rate appeared to be the most important factor contributing towards the QS20. Our data will be useful to develop best practices and guidelines in the field of emergency medicine communication centres.\n\nChildhood Mortality in Federal Medical Centre Umuahia, South Eastern Nigeria\n\nPubMed Central\n\nCharles, Nwafor Chukwuemeka; Chuku, Abali; Anazodo, Nnoli Martin\n\n2014-01-01\n\nObjectives This study aimed to evaluate the mortality pattern in children seen at Federal Medical Centre Umuahia (FMCU) Abia state, South Eastern Nigeria. Methods A retrospective cross sectional descriptive study over a 5-year period from January 1, 2004 to December 31, 2008 using data retrieved from the hospitalâs medical records department. Results A total of 3,814 children were admitted in the hospital and 434 of them died giving a mortality rate of 11%. The mean age was 1.7 (Std D of 3.19). Two hundred and thirty eight of them were males while 196 of them were females giving a sex ratio of 1.2:1. Majority of the mortality (49%) occurred within 24 hours of admission. The major causes of death during neonatal period were birth asphyxia (34%), prematurity (24%) and neonatal sepsis (24%). Malaria was the leading cause of death beyond the neonatal period accounting for 42% of cases. Other common mortality causes were pneumonia, septicaemia, diarrhea, HIV AIDS and meningitis each accounting for 10%, 10%, 7%, 7% and 5% respectively. The months of July, May and March accounted for most deaths (12%, 12% and 11% respectively). Conclusion Birth asphyxia and malaria associated deaths were responsible for most deaths during neonatal and beyond neonatal periods respectively. Presence of trained personal at all deliveries will help to reduce neonatal asphyxia. Efforts should be made to reinforce the existing effective malaria control tools.

Few if any of these centres would have the critical mass to solely resource a program. Methods: In order to enable an academic program, stakeholders from five institutions made a proposal to Carleton University for a) a research network with defined membership requirements and a process for accepting new members, and b) a graduate specialization (MSc and PhD) in medical physics. Both proposals were accepted and the program has grown steadily. Our courses are taught by medical physicists frommoreÂ Â» across the collaboration. Our students have access to physicists in: clinical radiotherapy (the Ottawa Cancer Centre treats 4500 new patients/y), radiology, cardiology and nuclear medicine, Canadaâs primary standards dosimetry laboratory, radiobiology, and university-based medical physics research. Our graduate courses emphasize the foundational physics plus applied aspects of imaging, radiotherapy, and radiobiology. Active researchers in the city-wide volunteer-run network are appointed as adjunct professors by Physics, giving them access to national funding competitions and partial student funding through teaching assistantships while opening up facilities in their institutions for student thesis research. Results: The medical physics network has grown to â¼40 members from eight institutions and includes five full-time faculty in Physics and 17 adjunct research professors. The graduate student population is â¼20. Our graduates have proceeded to a spectrum of careers. Our alumni list includes a CCPM Past-President, the current COMP President, many clinical physicists, and the heads of at least three major clinical medical physics departments. Our PhD was Ontarioâs first CAMPEP-accredited program. Conclusion: A self-governing volunteer network is the foundational element that enables an MSc\n\nChief medical officer actions on information security in an Italian rehabilitation centre.\n\nPubMed\n\nReni, Gianluigi; Molteni, Massimo; Arlotti, Stefano; Pinciroli, Francesco\n\n2004-03-31\n\nIn a multi-speciality rehabilitation centre, where child neuropsychiatrists, neurologists, physical rehabilitators, psychologists, nurses, therapists and other health care professionals actively care for patients, the moment will arrive when information security takes high priority on the chief medical officer (CMO) agenda. This has happened at the La Nostra Famiglia Institution. Local push to high priority arose from several concurrent forces, like privacy both on the patient and on the doctor side, legal and ethical aspects. Recommendations on the protection of medical data require appropriate technical and organisational measures to be taken to protect personal data against unauthorised access, alterations or any other form of inappropriate processing. In the same time quick and easy access to patient information should be granted to authorised personnel to ensure proper and in time treatment of patients. A long lasting sequence of co-operative negotiation meetings between the CMO and the chief information officer (CIO) led to appropriate outline of policies. We developed a suitable and modular architecture for designing systems that can simultaneously manage an increasing number of healthcare actors, objects and related access levels taking into account temporal conditions. Actions for keeping the prototype in use on an everyday basis are directly taken by the CMO.\n\nAnalysis of the life stages of Cimex lectularius captured within a medical centre suggests that the true numbers of bed bug introductions are under-reported.\n\nPubMed\n\nSheele, J M; Barrett, E; Dash, D; Ridge, G E\n\n2017-11-01\n\nLittle is known about the epidemiology of bed bugs within the healthcare system, but nymphal stages predominate in natural infestations. This study determined the life stages of bed bugs captured within a medical centre, and found that older bed bugs were more likely to be captured than younger insects. The numbers of first instars, third-fifth instars and adult females captured were significantly different compared with the numbers of each life stage found in a natural infestation (P<0.01). A significant number of early-instar bed bugs introduced into the medical centre may go unnoticed by hospital staff. Copyright Â© 2017 The Healthcare Infection Society. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Currently, hardcopy film is being rapidly replaced by digital radiological images in teaching hospitals, and an electronic teaching file (ETF) library would be desirable. Furthermore, a repository of ETFs deployed on the World Wide Web has the potential for e-learning applications to benefit a larger community of learners. In this paper, we describe a Singapore National Medical Image Resource Centre (SN.MIRC) that can serve as a World Wide Web resource for teaching diagnostic radiology. On SN.MIRC, ETFs can be created using a variety of mechanisms including file upload and online form-filling, and users can search for cases using the Medical Image Resource Center (MIRC) query schema developed by the Radiological Society of North America (RSNA). The system can be improved with future enhancements, including multimedia interactive teaching files and distance learning for continuing professional development. However, significant challenges exist when exploring the potential of using the World Wide Web for radiology education.\n\nAccidental hypothermia: rewarming treatments, complications and outcomes from one university medical centre.\n\nPubMed\n\nvan der Ploeg, Gert-Jan; Goslings, J Carel; Walpoth, Beat H; Bierens, Joost J L M\n\n2010-11-01\n\nAccidental hypothermia (AH) is a complex and life threatening condition. Knowledge about epidemiology, rewarming treatments, complications and outcome is limited. This study was initiated to obtain data on causes, rewarming treatments and complications. A retrospective cohort study of all patients with a body temperature â¤ 35Â°C admitted to the Emergency Department (ED) of the VU university medical centre, Amsterdam, The Netherlands, between January 1, 2000 and August 31, 2008. A predefined set of epidemiological and clinical data was retrieved. Eighty-four patients were included (median age: 47 years). Categories of hypothermia included immersion (18), submersion (29) and exposure to cold (37); concomitant factors were intoxication (26), trauma (40) and homelessness (7). Temperature at admission in the ED was 31.6 Â± 2.6Â°C (mean Â± SD), lowest temperature 24.2Â°C. Fourteen different rewarming treatments were used resulting in a wide range of rewarming speeds. Seventy-nine complications occurred: pulmonary, renal and neurological complications in 20, 17 and 10 patients respectively. Seventeen patients had 2 or more late complications. Twenty-four patients (28.6%) died: 10 during rewarming and 14 after rewarming was completed. Prognosis was poor in older and colder patients and after indoor exposure and submersion. AH is a rare diagnosis in an inhomogeneous population, treated with a large variety of rewarming techniques. Most complications and death occurred late, after rewarming was completed. Because individual teams gain little clinical experiences, we suggest multiple centre data collection as a first step towards an evidence-based standard of care.

The experience gained from designing, implementing and evaluating these learning sessions is presented and discussed. A total of 265 medical students and 43 physiotherapy apprentices attended five interprofessional learning sessions. Of these, 87-100% responded to closed and open-ended questions on a self-developed questionnaire (24 items). The responses regarding self-reported learning gains, benefit, motivation and satisfaction with the sessions were analyzed separately by professions. The learning sessions were well received by both groups. More than 75% of all participants were of the opinion that they could not have learned the new material in a better way. Significant differences between the medical students and the physiotherapy apprentices were mainly found with regard to perceived learning gains, which physiotherapy apprentices reported as being lower. Positive aspects of interprofessionalism were most often emphasized in the responses to the open-ended questions. Most frequently criticized were organizational aspects and a lack of perceived learning gains. The introduction of interprofessional learning entails great effort in terms of organizational and administrative challenges. However, the project is considered worthwhile because the interprofessional aspects of the learning sessions were indeed valued by the participants. Permanently including and expanding interprofessional learning in the curricula of both professions longitudinally is therefore something to strive for.\n\n[What illegal substances are used by sportsmen? a study in Midi-PyrÃ©nÃ©es Doping Preventing Medical Centre (AMPD-MP)].\n\nPubMed\n\nSenard-Ojero, Ana; Durrieu, GeneviÃ¨ve; Depiesse, FrÃ©dÃ©ric; Schmitt, Laurent; Riviere, Daniel; Montastruc, Jean-Louis\n\n2010-01-01\n\nDoping Preventing Medical Centres (Antennes MÃ©dicales de PrÃ©vention du Dopage) were established in France in 2000 in order to help sportsmen using illegal substances. These services are also information centres on illegal substances (drugs or others) used in sport. The aim of the study was to analyze the characteristics of sportsmen outpatient clinics in Antenne MÃ©dicale de Prevention du Dopage Midi-PyrÃ©nÃ©es (AMPD-MP). We present the results of outpatient clinics in AMPD-MP from 2002 to 2008. A descriptive analysis of demographic data, substances used and sports practised were performed. During this 7 year-period, 35 outpatient clinics were performed [32 men, 3 women, mean age: 28 years (extreme values: 18-47; 10 patients â¥ 30 years)]. They were mainly involved in national (16), international (8) or regional (7) competitions. The main sports involved were rugby (9) followed by cycling (5), athletics (3) and body-building (3). The most frequently used illegal substances were cannabis (15) followed by glucocorticoÃ¯ds (9), androgens (4), indirect sympathomimetics amphetaminics (4), beta 2 adrenergic agonists (2) and NSAIDs (2). Two veterinary substances (clenbuterol, boldone-veterinaire) were also found in body-builders. This study shows a clear under use of Doping Preventing Medical Centres by sportsmen and practitioners. It also indicates a relative high age for sportsmen referred to the centre. The main sports involved were rugby and cycling. Cannabis and glucocorticoÃ¯ds were the drugs more often involved in doping behaviours.\n\nClinicopathological profile and surgical treatment of abdominal tuberculosis: a single centre experience in northwestern Tanzania\n\nPubMed Central\n\n2013-01-01\n\nBackground Abdominal tuberculosis continues to be a major public health problem worldwide and poses diagnostic and therapeutic challenges to general surgeons practicing in resource-limited countries. This study was conducted to describe the clinicopathological profile and outcome of surgical treatment of abdominal tuberculosis in our setting and compare with what is described in literature. Methods A prospective descriptive study of patients who presented with abdominal tuberculosis was conducted at Bugando Medical Centre (BMC) in northwestern Tanzania from January 2006 to February 2012. Ethical approval to conduct the study was obtained from relevant authorities. Statistical data analysis was performed using SPSS version 17.0. Results Out of 256 patients enrolled in the study, males outnumbered females. The median age was 28 years (range = 16â68 years). The majority of patients (77.3%) had primary abdominal tuberculosis. A total of 127 (49.6%) patients presented with intestinal obstruction, 106 (41.4%) with peritonitis, 17 (6.6%) with abdominal masses and 6 (2.3%) patients with multiple fistulae in ano. Forty-eight (18.8%) patients were HIV positive. A total of 212 (82.8%) patients underwent surgical treatment for abdominal tuberculosis. Bands /adhesions (58.5%) were the most common operative findings. Ileo-caecal region was the most common bowel involved in 122 (57.5%) patients. Release of adhesions and bands was the most frequent surgical procedure performed in 58.5% of cases. Complication and mortality rates were 29.7% and 18.8% respectively. The overall median length of hospital stay was 32 days and was significantly longer in patients with complications (p < 0.001). Advanced age (age â¥ 65 years), co-morbid illness, late presentation, HIV positivity and CD4+ count < 200 cells/Î¼l were statistically significantly associated with mortality (p < 0.0001).

However, this practice has not been implemented in Tanzania, where there is unacceptably high treatment gap of 62.1% between cases estimated and cases detected. Therefore calls for more aggressive case finding for TB to close this gap. We aimed to determine the magnitude and predictors of bacteriologically-confirmed pulmonary TB among household contacts of bacteriologically-confirmed pulmonary TB index cases in the city of Mwanza, Tanzania. This study was carried out from August to December 2016 in Mwanza city at the TB outpatient clinics of Tertiary Hospital of the Bugando Medical Centre, Sekou-Toure Regional Hospital, and Nyamagana District Hospital. Bacteriologically-confirmed TB index cases diagnosed between May and July 2016 were identified from the laboratory registers book. Contacts were traced by home visits by study TB nurses, and data were collected using a standardized TB screening questionnaire. To detect the bacterioriologically-confirmed pulmonary TB, two sputum samples per household contact were collected under supervision for all household contacts following standard operating procedures. Samples were transported to the Bugando Medical Centre TB laboratory for investigation for TB using fluorescent smear microscopy, GeneXpert MTB/RIF and LÃ¶wenstein-Jensen (LJ) culture. Logistic regression was used to determine predictors of bacteriologically-confirmed pulmonary TB among household contacts. During the study period, 456 household contacts from 93Â TB index cases were identified. Among these 456 household contacts, 13 (2.9%) were GeneXpert MTB/RIF positive, 18 (3.9%) were MTB-culture positive and four (0.9%) were AFB-smear positive. Overall, 29 (6.4%) of contacts had bacteriologically-confirmed pulmonary TB.

Efficacy indicators include students' (1) perceived competency (2) attitude (3) conceptual knowledge, and (4) performance with regard to patient-centred communication. A longitudinal study with a before-after design tracked a preclinical cohort's progress on the aforementioned indicators as they advance through the training. Results indicate that following the CST, students perceived themselves to be more competent in interpersonal communication, had more positive attitude towards patient-centred communication, and developed a better conceptual knowledge of doctor-patient communication. In addition, those with good conceptual knowledge tend to demonstrate better communication skills performance at the Objective Structure Clinical Examination 12 months following the initial CST.\n\nThe digital eczema centre utrecht.\n\nPubMed\n\nvan Os-Medendorp, Harmieke; van Veelen, Carien; Hover, Maaike; Eland-de Kok, Petra; Bruijnzeel-Koomen, Carla; Sonnevelt, Gert-Jan; Mensing, Geert; Pasmans, Suzanne\n\n2010-01-01\n\nThe University Medical Centre Utrecht (UMC Utrecht) has developed an eczema portal that combines e-consulting, monitoring and self-management training by a dermatology nurse online for patients and parents of young children with atopic dermatitis (AD). Patient satisfaction with the portal was high. It could be extended to become a Digital Eczema Centre for multidisciplinary collaboration between health-care providers from different locations and the patient. Before starting the construction of the Digital Eczema Centre, the feasibility was examined by carrying out a business case analysis. The purposes, strength and weaknesses showed that the Digital Eczema Centre offered opportunities to improve care for patients with AD. The financial analysis resulted in a medium/best case scenario with a positive result of euro50-240,000 over a period of five years. We expect that the Digital Eczema Centre will increase the accessibility and quality of care. The web-based patient record and the digital chain-of-care promote the involvement of patients, parents and multidisciplinary teams as well as the continuity and coordination of care.\n\nComprehension through cooperation: Medical students and physiotherapy apprentices learn in teams â Introducing interprofessional learning at the University Medical Centre Mannheim, Germany\n\nPubMed Central\n\nMette, Mira; DÃ¶lken, Mechthild; Hinrichs, Jutta; NarciÃ, Elisabeth; SchÃ¼ttpelz-Brauns, Katrin; Weihrauch, Ute; Fritz, Harald M.\n\n2016-01-01\n\nAim: In order to better prepare future health care professionals for interprofessional cooperation, interprofessional learning sessions for medical students and physiotherapy apprentices were developed at the University Medical Centre Mannheim, Germany.

Centro Internazionale Radio Medico.\n\nPubMed\n\nAmenta, F; Dauri, A\n\n2001-01-01\n\nThis paper reviews medical activity provided from 1996 to 2000 by the International Radio Medical Centre (Centro Internazionale Radio Medico, C.I.R.M.). C.I.R.M. is a non-profit organization headquartered in Rome and providing freely telemedical advice to ships flying of any flag navigating on all seas of the world, to civil airplanes and to small Italian islands. From 1996 to 2000 C.I.R.M. has assisted 4,982 patients, 4,686 of which (94%) on board ships, 85 on airplanes and 206 on small Italian islands. More than 65% of requests of telemedical advice received by C.I.R.M. were from non-Italian ships. This indicates the really international nature of C.I.R.M.'s activity. The largest number of medical requests come from the Atlantic Ocean, followed by the Mediterranean sea, Indian Ocean and Pacific Ocean. In terms of pathologies assisted, accidents took the first place, followed as main pathologies by gastrointestinal disorders, cardiovascular pathologies, respiratory disorders, infectious and parasitic diseases and nervous system complaints. Analysis of the outcome of C.I.R.M.'s medical activity showed that more than 50% of patients assisted were recovered or improved while assisted by the Centre.\n\nExamining patterns in medication documentation of trade and generic names in an academic family practice training centre.\n\nPubMed\n\nSummers, Alexander; Ruderman, Carly; Leung, Fok-Han; Slater, Morgan\n\n2017-09-22\n\nStudies in the United States have shown that physicians commonly use brand names when documenting medications in an outpatient setting. However, the prevalence of prescribing and documenting brand name medication has not been assessed in a clinical teaching environment. The purpose of this study was to describe the use of generic versus brand names for a select number of pharmaceutical products in clinical documentation in a large, urban academic family practice centre. A retrospective chart review of the electronic medical records of the St. Michael's Hospital Academic Family Health Team (SMHAFHT). Data for twenty commonly prescribed medications were collected from the Cumulative Patient Profile as of August 1, 2014. Each medication name was classified as generic or trade. Associations between documentation patterns and physician characteristics were assessed. Among 9763 patients prescribed any of the twenty medications of interest, 45% of patient charts contained trade nomenclature exclusively. 32% of charts contained only generic nomenclature, and 23% contained a mix of generic and trade nomenclature. There was large variation in use of generic nomenclature amongst physicians, ranging from 19% to 93%. Trade names in clinical documentation, which likely reflect prescribing habits, continue to be used abundantly in the academic setting. This may become part of the informal curriculum, potentially facilitating undue bias in trainees. Further study is needed to determine characteristics which influence use of generic or trade nomenclature and the impact of this trend on trainees' c"
