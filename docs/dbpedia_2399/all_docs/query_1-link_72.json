        "text": "Planting the SEED: Towards a Spatial Economic Ecological Database for a shared understanding of the Dutch Wadden area\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nDaams, Michiel N.; Sijtsma, Frans J.\n\n2013-09-01\n\nIn this paper we address the characteristics of a publicly accessible Spatial Economic Ecological Database (SEED) and its ability to support a shared understanding among planners and experts of the economy and ecology of the Dutch Wadden area. Theoretical building blocks for a Wadden SEED are discussed. Our SEED contains a comprehensive set of stakeholder validated spatially explicit data on key economic and ecological indicators. These data extend over various spatial scales. Spatial issues relevant to the specification of a Wadden-SEED and its data needs are explored in this paper and illustrated using empirical data for the Dutch Wadden area. The purpose of the SEED is to integrate basic economic and ecologic information in order to support the resolution of specific (policy) questions and to facilitate connections between project level and strategic level in the spatial planning process. Although modest in its ambitions, we will argue that a Wadden SEED can serve as a valuable element in the much debated science-policy interface. A Wadden SEED is valuable since it is a consensus-based common knowledge base on the economy and ecology of an area rife with ecological-economic conflict, including conflict in which scientific information is often challenged and disputed.\n\nCan guild- or site-specific contrasts in trends or phenology explain the changed role of the Dutch Wadden Sea for fish?\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nTulp, Ingrid; van der Veer, Henk W.; Walker, Paddy; van Walraven, Lodewijk; Bolle, Loes J.\n\n2017-09-01\n\nThe Wadden Sea bordering the Dutch, German and Danish coast, is traditionally a region with important functions for many fish species: as a nursery area for juveniles (marine juveniles), as a feeding area, as a transit to and from fresh water, and resident species complete their whole life cycle there. Because of indications that the importance of the Dutch Wadden Sea has changed drastically for many species during the past decades, we analysed and classified trends of 24 common fish species in the last 45 years, which were assigned to 5 different ecological guilds. Trends were examined for three Wadden Sea regions and compared to trends in the adjacent two North Sea coastal regions. For these analyses we made a combined use of two longterm time series: an annual beamtrawl survey, the Demeral Fish Survey (DFS) with a high spatial but poor seasonal resolution and a fyke series with a high seasonal but poor spatial resolution. We investigated for which species the DFS survey was appropriate for trend analysis, and we evaluated whether a change in timing may contribute to patterns in DFS time trends. Total fish biomass showed a similar pattern in all tidal basins with an increase from 1970 to 1980, a peak in the mid-1980s and a strong decline from 1980 to 2000, with a subsequent stable trend. The pattern in the coastal region deviated especially in the past 10 years, with a further decline along the Dutch Wadden coast and an increase along the mainland coast. Most dramatic declines throughout the Wadden Sea occurred in species belonging to the marine juvenile guild, notably plaice, sole and dab. A declining trend in marine juveniles is on-going in the western part, while it recently stabilised or even increased in the central and eastern part and in the coastal regions. Resident species showed more variable trends in the Wadden Sea with less pronounced directions: both increases and decreases occurred. In the coastal regions, several resident species have increased\n\nLong-term trends in nutrient budgets of the western Dutch Wadden Sea (1976-2012)\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nJung, A. S.; Brinkman, A. G.; Folmer, E. O.; Herman, P. M. J.; van der Veer, H. W.; Philippart, C. J. M.\n\n2017-09-01\n\nLong-term field observations of nitrogen [N] and phosphorus [P] concentrations were used to construct nutrient budgets for the western Dutch Wadden Sea between 1976 and 2012. Nutrients come into the western Dutch Wadden Sea via river runoff, through exchange with the coastal zone of the North Sea, neighbouring tidal basins and through atmospheric deposition (for N). The highest concentrations in phosphorus and nitrogen were observed in the mid-1980s. Improved phosphorus removal at waste water treatment plants, management of fertilization in agriculture and removal of phosphates from detergents led to reduced riverine nutrient inputs and, consequently, reduced nutrient concentrations in the Wadden Sea. The budgets suggest that the period of the initial net import of phosphorus and nitrogen switched to a net export in 1981 for nitrogen and in 1992 for phosphorus. Such different behaviour in nutrient budgets during the rise and fall of external nutrient concentrations may be the result of different sediment-water exchange dynamics for P and N. It is hypothesized that during the period of increasing eutrophication (1976-1981) P, and to a lesser degree N, were stored in sediments as organic and inorganic nutrients. In the following period (1981-1992) external nutrient concentrations (especially in the North Sea) decreased, but P concentrations in the Wadden Sea remained high due to prolonged sediment release, whilst denitrification removed substantial amounts of N. From 1992 onwards, P and N budgets were closed by net loss, most probably because P stores were then depleted and denitrification continued. Under the present conditions (lower rates of sediment import and depleted P stores), nutrient concentrations in this area are expected to be more strongly influenced by wind-driven exchange with the North Sea and precipitation-driven discharge from Lake IJssel. This implies that the consequences of climate change will be more important, than during the 1970s and 1980s.\n\nLong-term patterns in fish phenology in the western Dutch Wadden Sea in relation to climate change\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nvan Walraven, Lodewijk; Dapper, Rob; Nauw, Janine J.; Tulp, Ingrid; Witte, Johannes IJ.; van der Veer, Henk W.\n\n2017-09-01\n\nLong-term patterns in fish phenology in the western Dutch Wadden Sea were studied using a 53 year (1960-2013) high resolution time series of daily kom-fyke catches in spring and autumn. Trends in first appearance, last occurrence and peak abundance were analysed for the most common species in relation to mode of life (pelagic, demersal, benthopelagic) and biogeographic guild (northern or southern distribution). Climate change in the western Wadden Sea involved an increase in water temperature from 1980 onwards. The main pattern in first day of occurrence, peak occurrence and last day of occurrence was similar: a positive trend over time and a correlation with spring and summer water temperature. This is counterintuitive; with increasing temperature, an advanced immigration of fish species would be expected. An explanation might be that water temperatures have increased offshore as well and hence fish remain longer there, delaying their immigration to the Wadden Sea. The main trend towards later date of peak occurrence and last day of occurrence was in line with our expectations: a forward shift in immigration into the Wadden Sea implies also that peak abundance is delayed. As a consequence of the increased water temperature, autumn water temperature remains favourable longer than before. For most of the species present, the Wadden Sea is not near the edge of their distributional range. The most striking phenological shifts occurred in those individual species for which the Wadden Sea is near the southern or northern edge of their distribution.\n\nDisease prevalence in flounder (Platichthys flesus) from the Dutch Wadden Sea as indicator of environmental quality: A summary of 1988-2005 surveys\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nVethaak, A. D.\n\n2013-09-01\n\nIn 1988, epizootics of ulcer disease in the flatfish flounder in the Dutch Wadden Sea were reported near freshwater drainage sluices of IJsselmeer Lake, locally affecting up to 38.9% of fish. Other diseases such as fin rot and lymphocystis were less frequent, but followed a similar pattern. Results of follow-up surveys in the Wadden Sea in 1994-2005 confirm previous findings and also show significantly elevated ulcer prevalences at other smaller drainage works. The most likely stress factors that contributed to the development of the epizootics at these sites include osmotic stress, adverse water quality conditions including chemical contaminants, nutritional deficiencies, and obstruction to fish migration. It was shown that discharges of IJsselmeer Lake freshwater in 1988-96 had a wide effect on the prevalence and distribution of ulcers and lymphocystis in the western Wadden Sea. A general reduction in disease prevalence in flounder in the entire Dutch Wadden Sea was observed during 1988-2005, which was most likely due to a general improvement in water quality and locally improved habitat conditions for flounder near drainage sluices. Ulcer prevalences outside the two IJsselmeer Lake sluices (Den Oever and Kornwerderzand) declined in this period from approximately 30% to 10% for medium-sized fish. Other skin diseases have also displayed a downward trend at both sites in recent years, with prevalences falling sharply to below 1%. Elsewhere in the Wadden Sea and the Ems-Dollard estuary, disease prevalences have declined towards natural background levels (< 1%). It is concluded that skin diseases, especially ulcers, are useful indicators of environmental quality in the Wadden Sea.\n\nLarge-scale synchronization of annual recruitment success and stock size in Wadden Sea populations of the mussel Mytilus edulis L.\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBeukema, J. J.; Dekker, R.; van Stralen, M. R.; de Vlas, J.\n\n2015-12-01\n\nSimultaneous abundance or shortage of mussels over vast areas may seriously affect fishery as well as shellfish-eating birds. We studied synchrony in annual recruit numbers and stock sizes (biomass) of mussels on the base of long-term observations in various parts of the Dutch (and German) Wadden Sea, including regular monitoring on Balgzand (a 50-km2 tidal flat area) and published or unpublished records for other parts of the Wadden Sea. Annual records for 37 years of mussel seed abundance in the eastern and western half of the Dutch Wadden Sea proved to be mutually well correlated and were also significantly correlated with annually assessed numerical densities of mussel recruits on Balgzand. The scarce long-term series available on mussel biomass pointed to significantly positive correlations between stock sizes on Balgzand and those in the northern German Wadden Sea, at about 300 km distance. The incidence of severe winters, which occurrence is synchronized over areas in the order of thousands of km, is identified as the dominant causative factor behind Wadden Sea-wide recruitment synchrony. Severe winters are known to reduce abundance of predators on tiny bivalve spat, and this process may overrule local processes causing abundance variation in bivalves. As such extreme winters are infrequent (usually only one or two per decade), sensible studies on the phenomenon of synchronization in abundance of Wadden Sea bivalves should be based on data series of sufficient length, covering decades.\n\nIntra-tidal variability of the vertical current structure in the western Dutch Wadden Sea\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nde Vries, Jurre; Ridderinkhof, Herman; van Aken, Hendrik\n\n2014-05-01\n\nLong-term velocity measurements are presented which were collected during three different seasons at one single location in an estuarine basin of the western Dutch Wadden Sea. These data are used to investigate the processes that determine the variability of the vertical current structure in the western Dutch Wadden Sea, in combination with simplified model runs using the one-dimensional water column model GETM (http://www.getm.eu/). Jay and Musiak [1996] were the first to suggest that intra-tidal variations in the vertical current might be important in determining the residual circulation patterns. More research [e.g. Stacey et al., 2001; Burchard and Hetland, 2010] has supported this hypothesis. Recently, lateral processes have been shown to influence the vertical current structure of alongstream velocity and hence the residual circulation [e.g. Lerczak and Geyer, 2004; Burchard and Schuttelaars, 2012]. Therefore to better understand the tidal dynamics in the western Dutch Wadden Sea, it is crucial to understand the processes that determine the vertical current structure. The two main findings of this study are that the complex bathymetry at the study site seems to produce an intra-tidal asymmetry in near-bed velocities and secondly that cross-stream processes strongly modify the current structure during late flood. Near-bed velocity and the bed roughness are greater during ebb than during flood. The GETM simulations suggest that vertical mixing during ebb is sufficient to destroy vertical stratification generated by classical tidal straining. The cross-stream current during late flood generate vertical stratification and drive an early reversal of the flood current near the surface. Therefore, it is hypothesized that this processes might increase the residual estuarine circulation at the study site. References - Burchard, H., Hetland, R.D.

The DWS is of high ecological importance due to its biodiversity and has been declared a World Heritage site by UNESCO. It is a dynamic area subject to regional relative sea level rise due to global sea level rise, postglacial rebound and gas exploitation. For intertidal areas to continue to serve as feeding ground for migratory birds, a net import of sediment is required. Observations are crucial but provide only scarce information in space and time. Hence, to estimate the net influx of suspended sediment into the DWS, realistic high resolution three-dimensional numerical simulations have been carried out using the General Estuarine Transport Model (GETM). The hydrodynamics are mainly governed by the tides, the fresh water discharge from several sluices into the DWS and wind variability. It is expected that the transport of suspended particulate matter (SPM) is governed by the same factors, too, in combination with sediment sink and source terms. For validation, the results are compared against different observational data sets, such as tidal gauges, temperature and salinity at a fixed station, and the volumetric flux rate through one of the inlets obtained from an acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP) attached to a ferry. SPM transport is modeled for four different sediment classes each of which is defined by the critical shear stress and the settling velocity. Results show a clear net import of SPM through one of the inlets, which is in agreement with the observations. First estimates of the total sediment fluxes through the different inlets are presented together with an analysis on their variability and sensibility to the external forcing. Of particular importance is the net export of SPM during storms as well as the role of storms on\n\nDiseases of flounder ( Platichthys Flesus L.) in the Dutch Wadden Sea, and their relation to stress factors\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nDick Vethaak, A.\n\nIn 1988 a survey was conducted on the occurrence of gross pathologies in flounder ( Platichthys flesus L.) in the Dutch Wadden Sea in relation to stress factors, especially near fresh-water drainage sluices. A total of 9608 flounder were collected from 16 sites in June and September. Diseases recorded were: skin ulcers (affecting 7.7% of fish); fin rot (2.8%; only included in the study in September); lymphocystis (3.7%); skeletal deformities (0.3%); liver nematode infections (5.0%); intestinal cysts of the parasite Glugea sp. (0.4%); and liver nodules (pre-neoplastic and neoplastic lesions) (< 0.1%). Prevalences of skin ulcers and fin rot in Wadden Sea flounder are considerably higher than in those captured off the Dutch North Sea coast or in the Elbe estuary in Germany. These high disease levels in the Wadden Sea, however, are largely due to extremely high prevalences of skin ulcers observed near the drainage sluices of Lake IJssel, indicating a localized effect. Fin rot occurs at relatively high prevalences over the whole study area, but the data should be interpreted with some caution, due to diagnostic problems. Associations with possible disease determinants were investigated and causal hypotheses formulated. In general fish seem to develop skin diseases at sites with strong salinity fluctuations. Nutritional deficiencies possibly related to strong salinity fluctuations, high bacterial loads in the environment and obstacles to fish migration through sluices are amongst the most likely factors determining the locally high levels of skin ulcers. Although not established, it is possible that pollution-related factors and contaminant bioavailability are important. The stress imposed by a combination of these factors may adversely affect the immune system, making the fish vulnerable to opportunistic bacterial infection.\n\nRed List of birds of the Wadden Sea area\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nRasmussen, L. M.; Norden Andersen, O. G.; Frikke, J.; Laursen, K.; Salvig, J.; Fleet, D. M.; HÃ¤lterlein, B.; Heckenroth, H.; Merck, T.; RÃ¶sner, H.-U.; SÃ¼dbeck, P.; Wolff, W. J.; Thissen, J. B. M.\n\n1996-10-01\n\n350000 400000 pairs of breeding birds as well as 10 12 millions of migratory waterbirds use the Danish-German-Dutch Wadden Sea as a feeding, roosting and moulting area. The exact number of migrating birds using the Wadden Sea is unknown. 4 Wadden Sea breeding bird species are (probably) extinct in the area, e.g. Caspian Tern ( Sterna caspia) and Roseate Tern ( Sterna dougallii); the status of 5 species is critical, 4 species are endangered, the status of 6 species is vulnerable and of 4 species susceptible. Internaional responsibility can be stated for at least 15 breeding bird species or subspecies, because considerable parts of the north-west-european population (at least 5%) breed in the Wadden Sea (e.g. Eurasian Spoonbill ( Platalea leucorodia), Common Shelduck ( Tadorna tadorna), Hen Harrier ( Circus cyaneus), Avocet ( Recurvirostra avosetta), Kentish Plover ( Charadrius alexandrinus), Common Redshank ( Tringa totanus totanus), Gull-billed Tern ( Gelochelidon nilotica), Sandwich Tern ( Sterna sandvicensis), Common Tern ( Sterna hirundo), Little Tern ( Sterna albifrons). International responsibility can be determined for at least 54 migratory bird species or subspecies, because considerable parts of the biogeographical population (at least 1%) occur in the Wadden Sea during migration. Some species are present in the Wadden Sea with about 50% or nearly 90% of all individuals of the concerned populations, which means a very special international responsibility of the Wadden Sea has to be stated for these species.\n\nPhosphorus limitation during a phytoplankton spring bloom in the western Dutch Wadden Sea\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLy, Juliette; Philippart, Catharina J. M.; Kromkamp, Jacco C.\n\n2014-04-01\n\nLike many aquatic ecosystems, the western Dutch Wadden Sea has undergone eutrophication. Due to changes in management policy, nutrient loads, especially phosphorus decreased after the mid-80s. It is still under debate, however, whether nutrients or light is limiting phytoplankton production in the western Wadden Sea, as studies using monitoring data delivered sometimes opposite conclusions and outcomes were related to years, seasons and approaches used. Clearly, the monitoring data alone were not sufficient. We therefore examined the limiting factors for the phytoplankton spring bloom using different experimental approaches. During the spring bloom in April 2010, we investigated several nutrient regimes on natural phytoplankton assemblages at a long term monitoring site, the NIOZ-Jetty sampling (Marsdiep, The Netherlands). Four bioassays, lasting 6 days each, were performed in controlled conditions. From changes in phytoplankton biomass, chlorophyll-a (Chla), we could conclude that the phytoplankton in general was mainly P-limited during this period, whereas a Si-P-co-limitation was likely for the diatom populations, when present. These results were confirmed by changes in the photosynthetic efficiency (Fv/Fm), in the expression of alkaline phosphatase activity (APA) measured with the fluorescent probe ELF-97, and in the 13C stable isotope incorporation in particulate organic carbon (POC). During our bioassay experiments, we observed a highly dynamic phytoplankton community with regard to species composition and growth rates. The considerable differences in net population growth rates, occurring under more or less similar environmental incubation conditions, suggest that phytoplankton species composition and grazing activity by small grazers were important structuring factors for net growth during this period.\n\nChemical contaminants in the Wadden Sea: Sources, transport, fate and effects\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLaane, R. W. P. M.; Vethaak, A. D.; Gandrass, J.; Vorkamp, K.; KÃ¶hler, A.; Larsen, M. M.; Strand, J.\n\n2013-09-01\n\nThe Wadden Sea receives contaminants from various sources and via various transport routes. The contaminants described in this overview are various metals (Cd, Cu, Hg, Pb and Zn) and various organic contaminants (polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and lindane (hexachlorocyclohexane, Î³-HCH)). In addition, information is presented about other and emerging contaminants such as antifouling biocides (e.g. TBT and Irgarol), brominated flame retardants (BFRs), poly- and perfluorinated compounds (PFCs) and pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs). Special attention is given to biogeochemical processes that contribute to the mobilization of contaminants in the surface sediments of the Wadden Sea. Finally, the effects on organisms of contaminants are reviewed and discussed. The main source of contaminants in the Wadden Sea are the rivers Rhine (via de Dutch coastal zone), Elbe and Weser. The Wadden Sea is not a sink for contaminants and adsorbed contaminants are transported from east to west. The surface sediments of the Wadden Sea are an important source for contaminants to the water above. The input and concentration of most contaminants have significantly decreased in water, sediments, organisms (e.g., mussel, flounder and bird eggs) in various parts of the Wadden Sea in the last three decades. Remarkably, the Cd concentration in mussels is increasing the last decades. In recent decades, the effects of contaminants on organisms (e.g., flounder, seal) have fallen markedly. Most of the affected populations have recovered, except for TBT induced effects in snails. Little is known about the concentration and effects of most emerging contaminants and the complex environmental mixtures of contaminants. It is recommended to install an international coordinated monitoring programme for contaminants and their effects in the whole Wadden Sea and to identify the chemical contaminants that really cause the effect.\n\nHeight system connection between island and mainland using a hydrodynamic model: a case study connecting the Dutch Wadden islands to the Amsterdam ordnance datum (NAP)\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSlobbe, D. C.; Klees, R.; Verlaan, M.; Zijl, F.; Alberts, B.; Farahani, H. H.\n\n2018-03-01\n\nWe present an efficient and flexible alternative method to connect islands and offshore tide gauges with the height system on land. The method uses a regional, high-resolution hydrodynamic model that provides total water levels. From the model, we obtain the differences in mean water level (MWL) between tide gauges at the mainland and at the islands or offshore platforms. Adding them to the MWL relative to the national height system at the mainland's tide gauges realizes a connection of the island and offshore platforms with the height system on the mainland. Numerical results are presented for the connection of the Dutch Wadden islands with the national height system (Normaal Amsterdams Peil, NAP). Several choices of the period over which the MWLs are computed are tested and validated. The best results were obtained when we computed the MWL only over the summer months of our 19-year simulation period. Based on this strategy, the percentage of connections for which the absolute differences between the observation- and model-derived MWL differences are â¤ 1 cm is about 34% (46 out of 135 possible leveling connections). In this case, for each Wadden island we can find several connections that allow the transfer of NAP with (sub-)centimeter accuracy.\n\nParasites in the Wadden Sea food web\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nThieltges, David W.; Engelsma, Marc Y.; Wendling, Carolin C.; Wegner, K. Mathias\n\n2013-09-01\n\nWhile the free-living fauna of the Wadden Sea has received much interest, little is known on the distribution and effects of parasites in the Wadden Sea food web. However, recent studies on this special type of trophic interaction indicate a high diversity of parasites in the Wadden Sea and suggest a multitude of effects on the hosts. This also includes effects on specific predator-prey relationships and the general structure of the food web. Focussing on molluscs, a major group in the Wadden Sea in terms of biomass and abundance and an important link between primary producers and predators, we review existing studies and exemplify the ecological role of parasites in the Wadden Sea food web. First, we give a brief inventory of parasites occurring in the Wadden Sea, ranging from microparasites (e.g. protozoa, bacteria) to macroparasites (e.g. helminths, parasitic copepods) and discuss the effects of spatial scale on heterogeneities in infection levels. We then demonstrate how parasites can affect host population dynamics by acting as a strong mortality factor, causing mollusc mass mortalities. In addition, we will exemplify how parasites can mediate the interaction strength of predator-prey relationships and affect the topological structure of the Wadden Sea food web as a whole. Finally, we highlight some ongoing changes regarding parasitism in the Wadden Sea in the course of global change (e.g. species introduction, climate change) and identify important future research questions to entangle the role of parasites in the Wadden Sea food web.\n\nAn operational data access infrastructure for accessing integrated environmental and socio-economic data from the Dutch Wadden Sea\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nDe Bruin, T.\n\n2012-12-01\n\nThe Wadden Sea, an UNESCO World Heritage Site along the Northern coasts of The Netherlands, Germany and Denmark, is a very valuable, yet also highly vulnerable tidal flats area. Knowledge is key to the sustainable management of the Wadden Sea. This knowledge should be reliable, founded on promptly accessible information and sufficiently broad to integrate both ecological and economic analyses. The knowledge is gained from extensive monotoring of both ecological and socio-economic parameters. Even though many organisations, research institutes, government agencies and NGOs carry out monitoring, there is no central overview of monitoring activities, nor easy access to the resulting data. The 'Wadden Sea Long-Term Ecosystem Research' (WaLTER) project (2011-2015) aims to set-up an integrated monitoring plan for the main environmental and management issues relevant to the Wadden Sea, such as sea-level rise, fisheries management, recreation and industry activities. The WaLTER data access infrastructure will be a distributed system of data providers, with a centralized data access portal. It is based on and makes use of the existing data access infrastructure of the Netherlands National Oceanographic Data Committee (NL-NODC), which has been operational since early 2009. The NL-NODC system is identical to and in fact developed by the European SeaDataNet project, furthering standardisation on a pan-European scale. The presentation will focus on the use of a distributed data access infrastructure to address the needs of different user groups such as policy makers, scientists and the general public.\n\nOstreid herpesvirus OsHV-1 Î¼Var in Pacific oysters Crassostrea gigas (Thunberg 1793) of the Wadden Sea, a UNESCO world heritage site.\n\nPubMed\n\nGittenberger, A; Voorbergen-Laarman, M A; Engelsma, M Y\n\n2016-01-01\n\nThe Wadden Sea is an extensive wetland area, recognized as UNESCO world heritage site of international importance. Since the mid-1990s, the invasive Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas (Thunberg 1793) population in the area has grown exponentially, having a distinct impact on the ecosystem. The recent spread of the emerging oyster pathogen Ostreid herpesvirus OsHV-1 Î¼Var worldwide and specifically in the oyster culture areas in the south of the Netherlands raised the question whether the virus may also be present in the Wadden Sea. In the summer of 2012 juvenile Pacific oysters were collected from five locations in the Dutch Wadden Sea. The virus was shown to be present in three of the five locations by real-time PCR and sequencing. It was concluded that OsHV-1 Î¼Var has settled itself in Pacific oyster reefs in the Wadden Sea. These results and the recent discoveries of OsHV-1 microvariants in Australia and Korea indicate that OsHV-1 Î¼Var and related variants might be more widespread than can be deduced from current literature. In particular in regions with no commercial oyster culture, similar to the Wadden Sea, the virus may go undetected as wild beds with mixed age classes hamper the detection of mortality among juvenile oysters. Â© 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.\n\nThe data access infrastructure of the Wadden Sea Long Term Ecosystem Research (WaLTER) project\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nDe Bruin, T.\n\n2011-12-01\n\nThe Wadden Sea, North of The Netherlands, Germany and Danmark, is one of the most important tidal areas in the world. In 2009, the Wadden Sea was listed on the UNESCO World Heritage list. The area is noted for its ecological diversity and value, being a stopover for large numbers of migrating birds. The Wadden Sea is also used intensively for economic activities by inhabitants of the surrounding coasts and islands, as well as by the many tourists visiting the area every year. A whole series of monitoring programmes is carried out by a range of governmental bodies and institutes to study the natural processes occuring in the Wadden Sea ecosystems as well as the influence of human activities on those ecosystems. Yet, the monitoring programmes are scattered and it is difficult to get an overview of those monitoring activities or to get access to the data resulting from those monitoring programmes. The Wadden Sea Long Term Ecosystem Research (WaLTER) project aims to: 1. To provide a base set of consistent, standardized, long-term data on changes in the Wadden Sea ecological and socio-economic system in order to model and understand interrelationships with human use, climate variation and possible other drivers. 2. To provide a research infrastructure, open access to commonly shared databases, educational facilities and one or more field sites in which experimental, innovative and process-driven research can be carried out. This presentation will introduce the WaLTER-project and explain the rationale for this project. The presentation will focus on the data access infrastructure which will be used for WaLTER. This infrastructure is part of the existing and operational infrastructure of the National Oceanographic Data Committee (NODC) in the Netherlands. The NODC forms the Dutch node in the European SeaDataNet consortium, which has built an European, distributed data access infrastructure. WaLTER, NODC and SeaDataNet all use the same technology, developed within the Sea\n\nAbundance and tidal behaviour of pelagic fish in the gateway to the Wadden Sea\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nCouperus, Bram; Gastauer, Sven; FÃ¤ssler, Sascha M. M.; Tulp, Ingrid; van der Veer, Henk W.; Poos, Jan Jaap\n\n2016-03-01\n\nThe shallow coast of The Netherlands is an important habitat for small pelagic fish. They form one of the major links between plankton and the higher trophic levels. Predatory fish, sea mammals and birds rely on small pelagic fish as a major food source. Currently, monitoring of fish in the Dutch coastal zone mainly focuses on demersal species, using bottom trawls and fykes. Four hydro-acoustic surveys were carried out in May and October 2010/2011 in the Marsdiep area, a relatively deep tidal inlet in the western Wadden Sea, to quantify abundances of pelagic fish. The aims of this study were to (1) describe temporal and vertical variations in fish distribution and school dimensions in relation to tide, and (2) estimate biomass of pelagic fish and their proportion to total fish biomass. The biomass of pelagic fish in the Marsdiep area ranged between 23 and 411 kg/ha. These were mainly sprat, but also young herring, anchovy and pilchard. The fish was scattered in small schools with volumes smaller than 5m3 and concentrated in the top 10 m below the surface. There was a clear effect of tidal cycle on school volume and fish abundance, with larger densities and larger schools at high tide compared to low tide. In May, sandeel contributed substantially to the pelagic assemblage, whereas in October sandeel was absent in the trawl catches, most likely because they stayed buried in the seabed from late summer to spring. The presence of pilchard and anchovy confirmed their re-establishment in the Southern North Sea and Wadden Sea. The abundance of pelagic fish exceeded the biomass of demersal fish in the western Wadden Sea by an order of magnitude. This finding is relevant for ecosystem studies. The fact that this study suggests that small pelagics outnumber demersal species to such a large extent calls for a rethinking of the allocation of monitoring effort in the Dutch coastal zone.\n\nRed List of grasshoppers of the Wadden Sea area\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHolst, K.; Grein, G.; Dierking, U.; van Wingerden, W. K. R. E.\n\n1996-10-01\n\nIn typical coastal habitats of the Wadden Sea, 15 species of grasshoppers are threatened in at least one subregion. Of these, 14 species are threatened in the entire area and are therefore placed on the trilateral Red List. The situation in the Danish part of the Wadden Sea could only be taken into consideration in a limited way due to the latest available data in Denmark from 1969. The status of 2 species of grasshoppers in the entire Wadden Sea area is critical, 4 species are endangered, the status of 3 species is vulnerable and of 5 species susceptible.\n\nRed List of beetles of the Wadden Sea Area\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMahler, V.; Suikat, R.; AÃmann, Th.\n\n1996-10-01\n\nAs no data on beetles in the Wadden Sea area are available from The Netherlands, the trilateral status of threat only refers to the Danish and German part of the Wadden Sea. In this area, in total, 238 species of beetles are threatened in at least one subregion. Of these, 189 species are threatened in the entire area and are therefore placed on the trilateral Red List. 4 species are (probably) extinct in the entire Wadden Sea area. The status of 24 species of beetles is (probably) critical, 46 species are (probably) endangered, the status of 86 species is (probably) vulnerable and of 29 species (probably) susceptible.\n\nRed List of lampreys and marine fishes of the Wadden Sea\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBerg, S.; Krog, C.; Muus, B.; Nielsen, J.; Fricke, R.; Berghahn, R.; Neudecker, Th.; Wolff, W. J.\n\n1996-10-01\n\nIn the Wadden Sea areas of Denmark, Germany and The Netherlands, a total of 162 fish and lamprey species is known. 72 of these species are migrants entering the area occasionally; the total number of resident species in the Wadden Sea area is 90. In the Wadden Sea, in total, 20 species of fish and lamprey species are threatened in at least one subregion. Of these, 19 species are threatened in the entire area and are therefore placed on the trilateral Red List. 2 species of the listed fish and lamprey species are (probably) extinct in the entire Wadden Sea area. The status of 5 species of fish and lamprey species is critical, 5 species are (probably) endangered, the status of 6 is vulnerable and of 1 species susceptible. For about 16 rare species which may also be threatened, data were not sufficient to estimate past and present population sizes. The contributors to the list would like to encourage researchers to intensify work on the ecology and the present population sizes of these rare Wadden Sea species (see Fricke et al., 1995).\n\nChattonella and Fibrocapsa (Raphidophyceae): First observation of, potentially harmful, red tide organisms in Dutch coastal waters\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nVrieling, E. G.; Koeman, R. P. T.; Nagasaki, K.; Ishida, Y.; Pererzak, L.; Gieskes, W. W. C.; Veenhuis, M.\n\nSpecies of the potentially toxic and red-tide-forming marine-phytoplankton genera Chattonella and Fibrocapsa (Raphidophyceae) were observed for the first time in 1991 in samples taken in Dutch coastal waters; they were again recorded and enumerated in the following years. Chattonella spp. cell numbers varied with the season, with a maximum in May or June in the Dutch Wadden Sea. Cell numbers of Chattonella and F. japonica Toriumi et Takano were up to 6.0Â·10 3 cellsÂ·dm -3 in the Dutch Wadden Sea, except at one station in June 1993 when over 10 4 cellsÂ·dm -3Chattonella were counted. In May 1993, a minor bloom (over 2.0Â·10 5 cellsÂ·dm -3) was observed at a station in the southern central North Sea, 100 km northwest of the island of Terschelling. The potentially neurotoxic species Chattonella marina (Subrahmanyan) Hara et Chihara was identified and discriminated from morphologically related species within the class of Raphidophyceae by immunofluorescence. F. japonica could only be clearly identified in live samples; in fixed samples cell morphology was severely affected. The identification of this species was supported by the presence of mucocysts, structures that can be observed readily by optical and electron microscopy.\n\nRed List of macrofaunal benthic invertebrates of the Wadden Sea\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nPetersen, G.

Of these, 72 species are threatened in the entire area and are therefore placed on the trilateral Red List. 7 species are (probably) extinct in the entire Wadden Sea area. The status of 9 species of macrofaunal invertebrates is critical, 13 species are (probably) endangered, the status of 25 species is (probably) vulnerable and of 17 species (probably) susceptible.\n\nThe Wadden Sea in transition - consequences of sea level rise\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBecherer, Johannes; Hofstede, Jacobus; GrÃ¤we, Ulf; Purkiani, Kaveh; Schulz, Elisabeth; Burchard, Hans\n\n2018-01-01\n\nThe impact of sea level rise (SLR) on the future morphological development of the Wadden Sea (North Sea) is investigated by means of extensive process-resolving numerical simulations. A new sediment and morphodynamic module was implemented in the well-established 3D circulation model GETM. A number of different validations are presented, ranging from an idealized 1D channel over a semi-idealized 2D Wadden Sea basin to a fully coupled realistic 40-year hindcast without morphological amplification of the Sylt-RÃ¸mÃ¸bight, a semi-enclosed subsystem of the Wadden Sea. Based on the results of the hindcast, four distinct future scenarios covering the period 2010-2100 are simulated. While these scenarios differ in the strength of SLR and wind forcing, they also account for an expected increase of tidal range over the coming century. The results of the future projections indicate a transition from a tidal-flat-dominated system toward a lagoon-like system, in which large fractions of the Sylt-RÃ¸mÃ¸bight will remain permanently covered by water. This has potentially dramatic implications for the unique ecosystem of the Wadden Sea. Although the simulations also predict an increased accumulation of sediment in the back-barrier basin, this accumulation is far too weak to compensate for the rise in mean sea level.\n\nPossible causes for growth variability and summer growth reduction in juvenile plaice Pleuronectes platessa L. in the western Dutch Wadden Sea\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nvan der Veer, Henk W.; Jung, Alexa Sarina; Freitas, VÃ¢nia; Philippart, Catharina J. M.; Witte, Johannes IJ.\n\n2016-05-01\n\nGrowth variability within individuals and among groups and locations and the phenomenon of summer growth reduction has been described for juvenile flatfish in a variety of European coastal areas whereby the underlying causes still remain elusive. Potential mechanisms were tested for juvenile plaice Pleuronectes platessa L. in the western Dutch Wadden Sea, by analysing published and unpublished information from long-term investigations (1986-present). Growth variability did occur and could be explained by differences induced by environmental variability (water temperature), and by non-genetic irreversible adaptation and sex. Dynamic Energy Budget analysis indicated that especially sexually-dimorphic growth in combination with variability in sex ratio could explain most of the variability in growth and the increase in the range of the size of individuals within the population over time. Summer growth reduction was not only observed among 0-group plaice in the intertidal, but also in the subtidal and tidal gullies as well as among I- and II-group plaice. Intraspecific competition for food was not detected but some support for interspecific competition with other predators was found. Also resource competition (due to crowding) with the other abundant epibenthic species (0-, I- and II-group flounder Platichthys flesus; the brown shrimp Crangon crangon; the shore crab Carcinus maenas; the goby species Pomatoschistus minutus and Pomatoschistus microps) could not explain the summer growth reduction. The observed growth reduction coincided with a decrease in stomach content, especially of regenerating body parts of benthic prey items. It is hypothesised that macrozoobenthos becomes less active after the spring phytoplankton bloom, reducing prey availability for juvenile plaice in summer, causing a reduction in food intake and hence in growth.\n\nRed List of spiders (araneae) of the Wadden Sea Area\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nVangsgÃ¥rd, C.; Reinke, H.-D.; Schultz, W.; van Helsdingen, P. J.\n\n1996-10-01\n\nIn the Wadden Sea, in total, 55 species of spiders are threatened in at least one subregion. Of these, 50 species are threatened in the entire area and are therefore placed on the trilateral Red List. According to the present knowledge, no species of the listed spiders are extinct in the entire Wadden Sea area. The status of 3 species of spiders is (probably) critical; 12 species are endangered; the status of 30 species is (probably) vulnerable and of 6 species susceptible.\n\nReconstruction of the total N and P inputs from the IJsselmeer into the western Wadden Sea between 1935-1998\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nvan Raaphorst, Wim; de Jonge, Victor N.\n\n2004-03-01\n\nIn this paper we reconstruct the Total Nitrogen (TN) and Total Phosphorus (TP) inputs into the western Wadden Sea from its major freshwater source the lake IJsselmeer between 1935-1998. The reconstruction is based on the TN and TP loads of the river Rhine at the German/Dutch border and follows the aquatic continuum approach to calculate loads further downstream in (1) the river IJssel feeding the IJsselmeer, and (2) the discharge of this lake into the western Wadden Sea. Our objectives are to determine (1) how the signal of changing nutrient loads of the Rhine is transferred downstream, and (2) how hydrological changes in the rivers-and-lake system affected the TN and TP discharges into the western Wadden Sea. Observational data from which TN and TP loads of the river Rhine could be calculated date back to the 1960s and we used background loads for European rivers for the period before World War II. The period in between was interpolated using the historic scenarios of watershed land use and management tested for the hypothetical Phison river (Billen and Garnier, 1997, Aquat. Microb. Ecol. 13, 3-17), adapted for the hydrology of the Rhine. The interpolations were constrained by loads of dissolved inorganic N and P compounds, for which data go back to the 1930s. Using the reconstructed loads of the river Rhine, TN and TP loads of the river IJssel and the lake IJsselmeer were calculated with simple mass balance models that were calibrated against data available from 1972-1993 onwards. Results show a gradual 12-fold increase of the TN discharge of the IJsselmeer into the Wadden Sea from 1935 to 1988, after which it decreased to levels still Ë5 fold those in 1935. The discharge of TP increased more abruptly in the early 1960s to values in 1983 Ë10 fold those before 1965, followed by a sharp decrease to values still Ë2.5 fold those before 1965. These patterns resemble those in the river Rhine, but are modified due to (1) variability of other sources to the lake, and\n\nRed List of vascular plants of the Wadden Sea Area\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nWind, P.; van der Ende, M.; Garve, E.; Schacherer, A.; Thissen, J. B. M.\n\n1996-10-01\n\nIn the Wadden Sea area, a total of 248 (sub)species of vascular plants are threatened in at least one subregion. Of these, 216 (sub)species are threatened in the entire area and are therefore placed on the trialteral Red List. 17 (sub)species of the listed vascular plants are (probably) extinct in the entire Wadden Sea area. The status of 47 (sub)species of vascular plants is (probably) critical; 61 (sub)species are (probably) endangered; the status of 65 (sub)species is (probably) vulnerable and that of 26 (sub)species susceptible.\n\nHelminth parasites of the digestive tract of the oystercatcher, Haematopus ostralegus, in the Wadden Sea, The Netherlands\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBorgsteede, F. H. M.; Van den Broek, E.; Swennen, C.\n\nThe digestive tracts of 90 oystercatchers (equal numbers of males and females and of juveniles, subadults and adults) wintering in the Dutch Wadden Sea were examined for helminth parasites. The nematodes Capillaria sp. (36.7%) and Streptocara crassicauda (7.8%) were found in the stomach. Unidentified cestodes (76.7%) and the trematodes Psilostomum brevicolle (42.2%), Notocotylus sp. (81.1%), and unidentified gymnophallids (100%) were found in the intestine and caeca. Two birds were infected with Gymnophallidae only, while all other birds contained additional helminth species. Compared with subadult and adult birds, the juveniles had significantly more infections with Capillaria sp. and cestodes. Moreover, the juveniles were infected with a greater variety of species. No further relation was found between the presence of helminths or worm numbers and age groups or sexes of birds.\n\nRed List of amphibians and reptiles of the Wadden Sea area\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nFog, K.; Podloucky, R.; Dierking, U.; Stumpel, A. H. P.\n\n1996-10-01\n\nIn the Wadden Sea, in total, 8 species of amphibians and 4 species of reptiles are threatened in at least one subregion. Of these, 7 species of amphibians and all 4 species of reptiles are threatened in the entire area and are therefore placed on the trilateral Red List. 1 species of the listed reptiles is (probably) extinct in the entire Wadden Sea area. The status of 1 species of amphibians is endangered, the status of (probably) 4 species of amphibians and 3 species of reptiles are vulnerable and of 2 species of amphibians susceptible.\n\nA numerical model for the whole Wadden Sea: results on the hydrodynamics\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nGrÃ¤we, Ulf; Duran-Matute, Matias; Gerkema, Theo; FlÃ¶ser, GÃ¶tz; Burchard, Hans\n\n2015-04-01\n\nA high-resolution baroclinic three-dimensional numerical model for the entire Wadden Sea of the German Bight in the southern North Sea is first validated against field data for surface elevation, current velocity, temperature and salinity at selected stations and then used to calculate fluxes of volume, heat and salt inside the Wadden Sea and the exchange between the Wadden Sea and the adjacent North Sea through the major tidal inlets. The General Estuarine Transport Model (GETM) is simulating the reference years 2009-2011. The numerical grid has a resolution of 200x200m and 30 adaptive vertical layers. It is the final stage of a multi-nested setup, starting from the North Atlantic. The atmospheric forcing is taken from the operational forecast of the German Weather Service. Additionally, the freshwater discharge of 23 local rivers and creeks are included. For validation, we use observations from a ship of opportunity measuring sea surface properties, tidal gauge stations, high frequency of salinity and volume transport estimates for the Mardiep and Spiekeroog inlet. Finally, the estuarine overturning circulation in three tidal gulleys is quantified. Regional differences between the gullies are assessed and drivers of the estuarine circulation are identified. Moreover, we will give a consistent estimate of the tidal prisms for all tidal inlets in the entire Wadden Sea.\n\nLong-term effects of mechanical harvesting of lugworms Arenicola marina on the zoobenthic community of a tidal flat in the Wadden Sea\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBeukema, J. J.\n\nMore than half of the annual catch of about 30 million lugworms Arenicola marina from the Dutch Wadden Sea originates from digging machines which make 40-cm deep guilles in a few restricted tidal-flat areas (Texel, Balgzand) in the westernmost part of the Wadden Sea. Four successive years (1978-1982) of frequent disturbance by a lugworm dredge of one of the 15 sampling stations involved in a long-term study of the dynamics of the macrozoobenthos on Balgzand allowed a study of long-term effects of mechanical lugworm digging. Within an area of about 1 km 2, a near-doubling of the annual lugworm mortality rate resulted in a gradual and substantial decline of the local lugworm stock from more than twice the overall Balgzand mean at the start of the 4-year digging period to a value close to this mean at the end of the period (when the dredge moved to a richer area). Simultaneously, total zoobenthic biomass declined even more by the almost complete extinction of the population of larger gaper clams Mya arenaria that initially comprised half of the total biomass. Of the other, mostly short-lived, species only Heteromastus filiformis showed a clear reduction during the dredging period. Recovery of the biomass of the benthos took several years, particularly by the slow re-establishment of a Mya population with a normal size and age structure.\n\nContribution of different generations of the brown shrimp Crangon crangon (L.) in the Dutch Wadden Sea to commercial fisheries: A dynamic energy budget approach\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nCampos, Joana; Van der Veer, Henk W.; Freitas, VÃ¢nia; Kooijman, Sebastiaan A. L. M.\n\n2009-08-01\n\nIn this paper a contribution is made to the ongoing debate on which brown shrimp generation mostly sustains the autumn peak in coastal North Sea commercial fisheries: the generation born in summer, or the winter one. Since the two perspectives are based on different considerations on the growth timeframe from settlement till commercial size, the Dynamic Energy Budget (DEB) theory was applied to predict maximum possible growth under natural conditions. First, the parameters of the standard DEB model for Crangon crangon L. were estimated using available data sets. These were insufficient to allow a direct estimation, requiring a special protocol to achieve consistency between parameters. Next, the DEB model was validated by comparing simulations with published experimental data on shrimp growth in relation to water temperatures. Finally, the DEB model was applied to simulate growth under optimal food conditions using the prevailing water temperature conditions in the Wadden Sea. Results show clear differences between males and females whereby the fastest growth rates were observed in females. DEB model simulations of maximum growth in the Wadden Sea suggest that it is not the summer brood from the current year as Boddeke claimed, nor the previous winter generation as Kuipers and Dapper suggested, but more likely the summer generation from the previous year which contributes to the bulk of the fisheries recruits in autumn.\n\nData access systems in the real world: How distributed environmental and socio-economic data from the Dutch Wadden Sea are being integrated and made accessible through one portal, using the SeaDataNet infrastructure as a basis\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nDe Bruin, T.; Thijsse, P.\n\n2013-12-01\n\nThe Wadden Sea, an UNESCO World Heritage Site along the Northern coasts of The Netherlands, Germany and Denmark, is a very valuable, yet also highly vulnerable tidal flats area. It is noted for its ecological diversity and value, being a stopover for large numbers of migrating birds. The Wadden Sea is also used intensively for economic activities by inhabitants of the surrounding coasts and islands, as well as by the many tourists visiting the area every year. A whole series of monitoring programmes of both ecological and socio-economic parameters is carried out by a range of governmental bodies and institutes, to study the natural processes occuring in the Wadden Sea ecosystems as well as the influence of human activities on those ecosystems. Yet, the monitoring programmes are scattered and it is difficult to get an overview of those monitoring activities or to get access to the data resulting from those monitoring programmes. The Wadden Sea Long Term Ecosystem Research (WaLTER) project aims to: 1. Provide access through one data portal to a base set of consistent, standardized, long-term data on changes in the Wadden Sea ecological and socio-economic systems, in order to model and understand interrelationships with human use, climate variation and possible other drivers. 2. Provide a research infrastructure, open access to commonly shared databases, educational facilities and one or more field sites in which experimental, innovative and process-driven research can be carried out. This presentation will, after a short introduction of the WaLTER-project (2011-2015), focus on the distributed data access infrastructure which is being developed and used for WaLTER. This is based on and makes use of the existing data access infrastructure of the Netherlands National Oceanographic Data Committee (NL-NODC), which has been operational since early 2009. The NL-NODC system is identical to and in fact developed by the European SeaDataNet project, furthering standardisation\n\nMorphological differences in Macoma balthica (Bivalvia, Tellinacea) from a Dutch and three southeastern United States estuaries\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKamermans, Pauline; Van der Veer, Henk W.; Witte, Johannes IJ.; Adriaans, Ewout J.\n\n1999-05-01\n\nField collections of the bivalve Macoma balthica in the Dutch Wadden Sea and three southeastern United States estuaries revealed morphological differences between populations of the two sides of the Atlantic Ocean. Individuals of the same age showed much larger shell lengths at the American stations. In addition, bivalves of the same body weight had higher siphon weights at the American stations than at the Dutch stations. This difference in siphon size was related to their burying depths. The American population, which invested more in heavier siphons, was able to burrow much deeper into the sediment (up to 30 cm). Deep burial may be an adaptation to avoid exposure to the high southern temperatures. Furthermore, it may serve as a refuge from blue crab predation. The results of our comparison between the southern American population and the European support the suggestion that populations of M. balthica living in these two regions should be considered separate and sibling species.\n\nStage-structured transmission of phocine distemper virus in the Dutch 2002 outbreak\n\nPubMed Central\n\nKlepac, Petra; Pomeroy, Laura W.; BjÃ¸rnstad, Ottar N.; Kuiken, Thijs; Osterhaus, Albert D.M.E.; Rijks, Jolianne M.\n\n2009-01-01\n\nHeterogeneities in transmission among hosts can be very important in shaping infectious disease dynamics. In mammals with strong social organization, such heterogeneities are often structured by functional stage: juveniles, subadults and adults. We investigate the importance of such stage-related heterogeneities in shaping the 2002 phocine distemper virus (PDV) outbreak in the Dutch Wadden Sea, when more than 40 per cent of the harbour seals were killed. We do this by comparing the statistical fit of a hierarchy of models with varying transmission complexity: homogeneous versus heterogeneous mixing and density- versus frequency-dependent transmission. We use the stranding data as a proxy for incidence and use Poisson likelihoods to estimate the âwho acquires infection from whomâ (WAIFW) matrix. Statistically, the model with strong heterogeneous mixing and density-dependent transmission was found to best describe the transmission dynamics. However, patterns of incidence support a model of frequency-dependent transmission among adults and juveniles. Based on the maximum-likelihood WAIFW matrix estimates, we use the next-generation formalism to calculate an R0 between 2 and 2.5 for the Dutch 2002 PDV epidemic.

The bivalve species Macoma balthica was observed on a 500Ã500 m grid in the Dutch part of the Wadden Sea. In total, 66% of the 3451 counts were zeros. A zero-inflated Poisson mixture model was used to relate counts to environmental covariates. Two models were considered, one with relatively fewer covariates (model \"small\") than the other (model \"large\"). The models contained two processes: a Bernoulli (species prevalence) and a Poisson (species intensity, when the Bernoulli process predicts presence). The model was used to make predictions for sites where only environmental data are available. Predicted prevalences and intensities show that the model \"small\" predicts lower mean prevalence and higher mean intensity, than the model \"large\". Yet, the product of prevalence and intensity, which might be called the unconditional intensity, is very similar. Cross-validation showed that the model \"small\" performed slightly better, but the difference was small. The proposed methodology might be generally applicable, but is computer intensive.\n\nRemotely sensing the German Wadden Sea-a new approach to address national and international environmental legislation.\n\nPubMed\n\nMÃ¼ller, Gabriele; Stelzer, Kerstin; Smollich, Susan; Gade, Martin; Adolph, Winny; Melchionna, Sabrina; Kemme, Linnea; GeiÃler, Jasmin; Millat, Gerald; Reimers, Hans-Christian; Kohlus, JÃ¶rn; Eskildsen, Kai\n\n2016-10-01\n\nThe Wadden Sea along the North Sea coasts of Denmark, Germany, and the Netherlands is the largest unbroken system of intertidal sand and mud flats in the world. Its habitats are highly productive and harbour high standing stocks and densities of benthic species, well adapted to the demanding environmental conditions. Therefore, the Wadden Sea is one of the most important areas for migratory birds in the world and thus protected by national and international legislation, which amongst others requires extensive monitoring. Due to the inaccessibility of major areas of the Wadden Sea, a classification approach based on optical and radar remote sensing has been developed to support environmental monitoring programmes. In this study, the general classification framework as well as two specific monitoring cases, mussel beds and seagrass meadows, are presented. The classification of mussel beds profits highly from inclusion of radar data due to their rough surface and achieves agreements of up to 79Â % with areal data from the regular monitoring programme. Classification of seagrass meadows reaches even higher agreements with monitoring data (up to 100Â %) and furthermore captures seagrass densities as low as 10Â %. The main classification results are information on area and location of individual habitats. These are needed to fulfil environmental legislation requirements. One of the major advantages of this approach is the large areal coverage with individual satellite images, allowing simultaneous assessment of both accessible and inaccessible areas and thus providing a more complete overall picture.\n\nEndoparasites in common eiders Somateria mollissima from birds killed by an oil spill in the northern Wadden Sea\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nThieltges, David W.; Hussel, Birgit; Baekgaard, Henrik\n\n2006-05-01\n\nMass mortalities of common eiders Somateria mollissima have been ascribed to high parasite loads. However, the actual role of parasites in mortalities is disputed as in the case of a mass mortality of eiders in the Wadden Sea in the winter of 1999/2000. A critical evaluation of the role of parasites in eider mass mortalities is hampered by (1) a lack of data on actual parasite loads of the birds involved, (2) missing regional data for comparison, and (3) a lack of unbiased samples: investigations are often based on dead beached individuals, which are presumably the more heavily infected birds of a population and thus more likely to die and be washed ashore. Although published data on parasite loads in birds of the winter 1999/2000 mortality are available, no data on background parasitism in eiders from the Wadden Sea exist, making an evaluation of the potential role of parasites in this mortality event difficult. By investigating endoparasites of 102 eiders affected by an oil spill in the northern Wadden Sea in winter 1998/1999, we provide a data set of background parasitism in wintering eiders from the Wadden Sea. We found 13 different parasite taxa with high prevalence values (% infected birds) in the acanthocephalan Profilicollis botulus, the nematode Amidostomum acutum, cestodes and trematodes. In some taxa we observed pronounced differences in prevalence values between juvenile eiders and adults, as well as between adult sexes. The parasite composition shows that bivalves, crabs ( Carcinus maenas) and other crustaceans are important sources of infections by being intermediate hosts. This is partly mirrored in the food content of eider stomachs where bivalves and crabs were predominantly found. Intensities of the acanthocephalan P. botulus, suspected of causing eider mortalities, were especially high in juveniles (1112 Â± 416 ind per infected host), but lower in adult males (40 Â± 7) and adult females (81 Â± 18). However, no extraordinary mortality event was\n\nFood intake and growth of Sarsia tubulosa (SARS, 1835), with quantitative estimates of predation on copepod populations\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nDaan, Rogier\n\nIn laboratory tests food intake by the hydromedusa Sarsia tubulosa, which feeds on copepods, was quantified. Estimates of maximum predation are presented for 10 size classes of Sarsia. Growth rates, too, were determined in the laboratory, at 12Â°C under ad libitum food conditions. Mean gross food conversion for all size classes averaged 12%. From the results of a frequent sampling programme, carried out in the Texelstroom (a tidal inlet of the Dutch Wadden Sea) in 1983, growth rates of Sarsia in the field equalled maximum growth under experimental conditions, which suggests that Sarsia in situ can feed at an optimum level. Two estimates of predation pressure in the field matched very closely and lead to the conclusion that the impact of Sarsia predation on copepod standing stocks in the Dutch coastal area, including the Wadden Sea, is generally negligible.\n\nInteraction between birds and macrofauna within food webs of six intertidal habitats of the Wadden Sea.\n\nPubMed\n\nHorn, Sabine; de la Vega, Camille; Asmus, Ragnhild; Schwemmer, Philipp; Enners, Leonie; Garthe, Stefan; Binder, Kirsten; Asmus, Harald\n\n2017-01-01\n\nThe determination of food web structures using Ecological Network Analysis (ENA) is a helpful tool to get insight into complex ecosystem processes. The intertidal area of the Wadden Sea is structured into diverse habitat types which differ in their ecological functioning. In the present study, six different intertidal habitats (i.e. cockle field, razor clam field, mud flat, mussel bank, sand flat and seagrass meadow) were analyzed using ENA to determine similarities and characteristic differences in the food web structure of the systems.

The intertidal area of the Wadden Sea is structured into diverse habitat types which differ in their ecological functioning. In the present study, six different intertidal habitats (i.e. cockle field, razor clam field, mud flat, mussel bank, sand flat and seagrass meadow) were analyzed using ENA to determine similarities and characteristic differences in the food web structure of the systems. All six systems were well balanced between their degree of organization and their robustness. However, they differed in their detailed features.

J.; CadÃ©e, G. C.; Dekker, R.\n\n2002-10-01\n\nWe address the question of whether year-to-year variability in pelagic algal food supply can explain long-term variability in macrozoobenthic biomass in an estuarine area. Starting in the early 1970s, quantitative data were frequently collected in standardized ways in the western part of the Dutch Wadden Sea on (1) concentrations of phytoplankton species and chlorophyll (and rates of primary production) in the main tidal inlet (Marsdiep) and (2) numerical densities and biomass of macrozoobenthic animals (and growth rates in a few species) in a nearby extensive tidal-flat area (Balgzand). In both data series, the most distinctive feature was a sudden change that took place around 1980, viz. a rather sudden and persisting doubling of concentrations of chlorophyll and algal cells and of primary production rates, as well as of numerical densities and biomass of zoobenthos. From these parallel changes we hypothesise that algal food largely determines the abundance of zoobenthos in the Wadden Sea. The following observations substantiate this hypothesis: (1) the significant correlation between annual mean values of chlorophyll concentration and overall mean numerical density and biomass of zoobenthos (as estimated after an appropriate time lag), (2) the observed limitation of zoobenthic biomass doubling (after the doubling of food supply) to areas with already high biomass values (where food demand was high and food could therefore be in short supply), (3) the limitation of a strong response to changes in food supply to functional groups that are directly dependent on algal food, i.e. suspension and deposit feeders, as opposed to carnivores, (4) the significant correlation between annual growth rates in Macoma balthica and food supply in the growing season, particularly in areas close to the tidal inlet where food concentrations were monitored. Some other factors were identified that could decisively influence zoobenthic abundance locally and/or temporarily. Harsh\n\nMacrofauna on flood delta shoals in the Wadden Sea with an underground association between the lugworm Arenicola marina and the amphipod Urothoe poseidonis\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLackschewitz, D.; Reise, K.\n\n1998-06-01\n\nLiving conditions for macrofauna on flood delta shoals are determined by surf, strong currents and sediment mobility. Thus, a unique assemblage of invertebrate species colonize these far off-shore, low intertidal flats. We here describe the macrobenthic fauna of emerging shoals in the Wadden Sea between the islands of RÃ¶mÃ¶ and Sylt. Besides ubiquitous macroinvertebrates of the intertidal zone and species which attain their main distribution in the subtidal zone, the flood delta shoals are characterized by organisms adapted to live in these highly unstable sediments, like the polychaetes Spio martinensis, Streptosyllis websteri, Magelona mirabilis, Psammodrilus balanoglossoides, the pericarid crustaceans Cumopsis goodsiri, Tanaissus lilljeborgi, Bathyporeia sarsi and a few others. Average abundance (1440 m-2 of ind >1 mm) and biomass (12.9 g AFDW m-2) were low compared to other intertidal habitats in the Wadden Sea. Biomass was dominated by largesized individuals of the lugworm Arenicola marina. The U-shaped burrows of these polychaetes were inhabited by high numbers of Urothoe poseidonis. Maximum densities of these amphipods occurred in the deepest parts of the burrows. Sampling at approximately montly intervals revealed no apparent seasonality of U. poseidonis abundance. Together with small Capitella capitata, these amphipods constitute a deep-dwelling component of the macrofauna associated with lugworms, which is separated from all other macrofauna living at the sediment surface. As a response to rising sea level and increasing tidal ranges, we expect the unstable sandy shoals, inhabited by numerous Spio martinensis and Urothoe poseidonis, to expand within the Wadden Sea at the cost of stable sandy flats with abundant macrofauna.\n\nEthnic identity, externalizing problem behaviour and the mediating role of self-esteem among Dutch, Turkish-Dutch and Moroccan-Dutch adolescents.\n\nPubMed\n\nWissink, Inge B; DekoviÄ, Maja; YaÄmur, SengÃ¼l; Stams, Geert Jan; de Haan, MariÃ«tte\n\n2008-04-01\n\nThe present study examined whether self-esteem mediates the relationship between two aspects of ethnic identity (i.e. ethnic identity exploration and ethnic identity commitment-affirmation) and externalizing problem behaviour in Dutch, Turkish-Dutch and Moroccan-Dutch adolescents living in the Netherlands. A total number of 345 adolescents (115 Dutch, 115 Turkish-Dutch, 115 Moroccan-Dutch) with a mean age of 14.5 filled in questionnaires at school. Turkish-Dutch and Moroccan-Dutch adolescents reported higher levels of both aspects of ethnic identity than their native Dutch counterparts, but there were no ethnic differences in self-esteem and externalizing problem behaviour. Only in the Moroccan-Dutch group was support found for the mediational model: stronger ethnic identity commitment-affirmation was related to a higher level of self-esteem, which, in turn, was related to a lower level of externalizing problem behaviour.\n\nManagement of the Wadden Sea\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nWolff, W. J.; Zijlstra, J. J.\n\n1980-03-01\n\nThe Wadden Sea situated along the North Sea coasts of Denmark, the Federal Republic of Germany and The Netherlands represents one of the world's largest bar-built type of estuaries. The area is a typical sedimentation and mineralization basin, with a large influx of organic matter from the adjoining North Sea, consequently a delicate oxygen balance and a rich benthic macrofauna, poor in species, which serves as food for juveniles of some commercially important North Sea fishes and for large numbers of migrating and wintering waders and waterfowl. Past and present activities of the human society in the area include fisheries (mainly for shrimp and mussels, semi-culture), shipping, land reclamation, recreation, dredging for sand and shells, and waste discharge from industries and human communities. Until the present these activities, although sometimes conflicting, did not fundamentally affect the area and its biota (pollution excluded), but future claims, including the construction of large deep-sea harbours, drilling for natural gas and oil, large-scale land reclamation and increased industrialization etc., might gradually induce degradation. For instance, area reduction by continued land reclamation could lead to irreversible losses of specific biotopes (e. g. salt-marshes, mud-flats), which could affect the size of bird and fish populations in a much wider region. Increased pollution, which has already inflicted damage on bird and seal populations, could reduce the fauna and hence the value of the area as a natural sanctuary. In the event of a proposal for a new human activity in the area, the present standing practice in the countries concerned requires an evaluation of its safety and economic aspects and its environmental impact. However, the various plans are considered separately and there is a general need for integrated management of the area.\n\nBenthic primary producers are key to sustain the Wadden Sea food web: stable carbon isotope analysis at landscape scale.\n\nPubMed\n\nChristianen, M J A; Middelburg, J J; Holthuijsen, S J; Jouta, J; Compton, T J; van der Heide, T; Piersma, T; Sinninghe DamstÃ©, J S; van der Veer, H W; Schouten, S; Olff, H\n\n2017-06-01\n\nCoastal food webs can be supported by local benthic or pelagic primary producers and by the import of organic matter. Distinguishing between these energy sources is essential for our understanding of ecosystem functioning. However, the relative contribution of these components to the food web at the landscape scale is often unclear, as many studies lack good taxonomic and spatial resolution across large areas. Here, using stable carbon isotopes, we report on the primary carbon sources for consumers and their spatial variability across one of the world's largest intertidal ecosystems (Dutch Wadden Sea; 1460Â km 2 intertidal surface area), at an exceptionally high taxonomic (178 species) and spatial resolution (9,165 samples from 839 locations). The absence of overlap in Î´ 13 C values between consumers and terrestrial organic matter suggests that benthic and pelagic producers dominate carbon input into this food web. In combination with the consistent enrichment of benthic primary producers (Î´ 13 CÂ -16.3â°) relative to pelagic primary producers (Î´ 13 C -18.8) across the landscape, this allowed the use of a two-food-source isotope-mixing model. This spatially resolved modelling revealed that benthic primary producers (microphytobenthos) are the most important energy source for the majority of consumers at higher trophic levels (worms, molluscs, crustaceans, fish, and birds), and thus to the whole food web. In addition, we found large spatial heterogeneity in the Î´ 13 C values of benthic primary producers (Î´ 13 C -19.2 to -11.5â°) and primary consumers (Î´ 13 C -25.5 to -9.9â°), emphasizing the need for spatially explicit sampling of benthic and pelagic primary producers in coastal ecosystems. Our findings have important implications for our understanding of the functioning of ecological networks and for the management of coastal ecosystems.

The intertidal flats of the Dutch Wadden Sea are a State Nature Monument and are protected under the Ramsar convention and the European Union's Habitat and Birds Directives. Until 2004, the Dutch government granted permission for ~75% of the intertidal flats to be exploited by mechanical dredgers for edible cockles (Cerastoderma edule). Here we show that dredged areas belonged to the limited area of intertidal flats that were of sufficient quality for red knots (Calidris canutus islandica), a long-distance migrant molluscivore specialist, to feed. Dredging led to relatively lower settlement rates of cockles and also reduced their quality (ratio of flesh to shell). From 1998 to 2002, red knots increased gizzard mass to compensate for a gradual loss in shellfish quality, but this compensation was not sufficient and led to decreases in local survival. Therefore, the gradual destruction of the necessary intertidal resources explains both the loss of red knots from the Dutch Wadden Sea and the decline of the European wintering population. This study shows that MPAs that do not provide adequate protection from fishing may fail in their conservation objectives.\n\nShellfish Dredging Pushes a Flexible Avian Top Predator out of a Marine Protected Area\n\nPubMed Central\n\nvan Gils, Jan A; Piersma, Theunis; Dekinga, Anne; Spaans, Bernard; Kraan, Casper\n\n2006-01-01\n\nThere is a widespread concern about the direct and indirect effects of industrial fisheries; this concern is particularly pertinent for so-called âmarine protected areasâ (MPAs), which should be safeguarded by national and international law.

N.; van Weerlee, Evaline; Duineveld, Gerard C. A.\n\n2017-09-01\n\nThis paper describes the distribution of the razor clam Ensis directus in the Dutch coastal zone with emphasis on its relation to sediment grainsize, in particular silt. The study includes a spatial survey along the coast of North Holland (Netherlands) and an in-situ experiment for the burial of silt. Densities of E. directus appeared highest close to the coast in the siltiest sediment, where also the highest body mass index values (BMI) were found suggesting the best conditions for growth. The largest specimens with the lowest BMI were found at the less silty, outermost off-shore stations. In the shallow (10 m) zone a \"lander\" frame was deployed at the seabed containing 100 pvc tubes filled with silt free sand that each hosted either a living E. directus, an empty shell, or bare sand. After three 3-weeks periods the silt content in the different tubes was determined and compared. The silt content around a living E. directus appeared 34% (spring) and 12% (autumn) higher than around an empty vertical shell, and 56% (spring) higher than in bare sand. We discuss the different pathways along which silt is brought into subsurface sediment layers and speculate about the potential role of E. directus in the coastal sediment and silt dynamics. It is estimated that E. directus facilitates the (temporal) burial of up to 6 Mton of fine particles in the coastal zone annually. This equals up to 27% of the annual SPM transport along the Dutch coast and is between 45 and 85% of the annual influx into the western Wadden Sea. The results show that the coastal E. directus population has a large impact on mass balance and behaviour of SPM, and on the ecological functioning of Dutch coastal and estuarine ecosystems.\n\nPerceived antecedents of marital satisfaction among Turkish, Turkish-Dutch, and Dutch couples.\n\nPubMed\n\nCelenk, Ozgur; van de Vijver, Fons J R\n\n2013-01-01\n\nWe studied mainstream couples in The Netherlands and Turkey as well as Turkish-Dutch immigrant couples to address cultural factors associated with marital satisfaction. A total of 13 Turkish (mainstream couples living in Turkey), 19 Turkish-Dutch (Turkish immigrant couples living in The Netherlands), and 17 Dutch (mainstream couples living in The Netherlands) married dyads (total of 98 individuals) were independently interviewed about positive and negative characteristics of marriages, determinants of general marital satisfaction and dissatisfaction, spousal communication, marital conflict, and marital roles. Multivariate tests revealed ethnic group differences on all marriage-related domains except the conflict resolution strategies. However, univariate analyses showed differences in few themes within domains; main differences were assessed between the Turkish/Turkish-Dutch (who put more emphasis on children and economical aspects) and Dutch couples (who put more emphasis on behavior, and personality of the spouse, reciprocity, emotional sharing, and psychological roles). Turkish-Dutch couples were more similar to Turkish than to Dutch couples. Results were discussed in light of the socioeconomic development and cultural value theories, which are believed to provide a useful framework for understanding the role of culture in marital satisfaction.\n\nEthnic Identity, Externalizing Problem Behaviour and the Mediating Role of Self-Esteem among Dutch, Turkish-Dutch and Moroccan-Dutch Adolescents\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nWissink, Inge B.; Dekovic, Maja; Yagmur, Sengul; Stams, Geert Jan; de Haan, Mariette\n\n2008-01-01\n\nThe present study examined whether self-esteem mediates the relationship between two aspects of ethnic identity (i.e. ethnic identity exploration and ethnic identity commitment-affirmation) and externalizing problem behaviour in Dutch, Turkish-Dutch and Moroccan-Dutch adolescents living in the Netherlands.

Observations on a tidal flat in the Dutch Wadden Sea have shown that: - (1) The average energy density of ten invertebrate prey species varies between 21 and 23 kJÂ·g -1 AFDW. In Scrobicularia plana and Mya arenaria, but not in Macoma balthica, the energy density is 10% lower in winter than in summer. - (2) Depending on the species, body weights of prey of similar size are 30 to 60% lower in winter than in summer. - (3) The year-to-year fluctuation in standing-crop biomass is larger in some species than in others, the difference depending mainly on the frequency of successful recruitment. The overall biomass of the macrobenthos in winter is half of that in summer, but the timing of the peak biomass differs per species. - (4) The burying depth varies per species: Cerastoderma edule live just beneath the surface, while M. balthica, S. plana, M. arenaria, Arenicola marina and Nereis diversicolor bury more deeply and the majority of these prey live out of reach of the bird's bill. In all six species, burying depth increases with size. There is no seasonal variation in depth of C. edule and M. arenaria, but the four other species live at most shallow depth in early summer and most deeply in midwinter. Burying depths in winter vary from year to year, but are unrelated to temperature. Neither has temperature any effect on depth within months. For knot Calidris canutus feeding on M. balthica, the fluctuation in the accessible fraction was the main source of variation in the biomass of prey that is actually harvestable, i.e. the biomass of prey of suitable size that is accessible. Accordingly, the paper reviews the available data on the temporal variations in accessibility, detectability, ingestibility, digestibility and profitability of prey for waders. Only a small part of the prey is harvestable since many accessible prey are ignored because of their low\n\nMacrobenthic turnover in the subtidal Wadden Sea: The Norderaue revisited after 60 years\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nReise, K.; Schubert, A.\n\n1987-03-01\n\nThe benthic macrofauna of a tidal inlet in the northern Wadden Sea was sampled with grab and dredge in 1924 1926 (Hagmeier & KÃ¤ndler, 1927), and again in 1985 and 1986. The comparison of surveys from consecutive years, as well as observations from an adjacent area, are employed to separate spurious from real long-term changes. Several epibenthic species of the 1920s became rare or absent in the 1980s. Oyster beds and reefs of the colonial polychaete Sabellaria spinulosa have disappeared completely. On the other hand, mussel beds have extended their range, and the abundance of mobile infauna has increased. The total number of species has remained approximately the same. Compared to surveys from consecutive years, the 60-year interval has doubled the species turnover rate, and has decreased the similarity in relative abundances by one third. The observed losses are best explained by the impact of dredging and trawling on the benthic fauna, while gains seem to indicate coastal eutrophication.\n\nAre GP patients' needs being met? Unfulfilled information needs among native-Dutch and Turkish-Dutch patients.\n\nPubMed\n\nSchinkel, Sanne; Schouten, Barbara C; van Weert, Julia C M\n\n2013-02-01\n\nThis study aims to assess unfulfilled information needs of native-Dutch and Turkish-Dutch general practitioner (GP) patients in the Netherlands. In addition, the relation between perceived and recorded information provision by GPs is studied. Unfulfilled information needs of native-Dutch (N=117) and Turkish-Dutch patients (N=74) were assessed through pre- and post-consultation questionnaires. Audiotapes of GP consultations were made to code GPs' information provision. Turkish-Dutch patients experience more unfulfilled information needs than native-Dutch patients, in particular those who identify equally with Dutch and Turkish culture. Overall, perceived information provision is hardly related to recorded information provision. GPs insufficiently provide Turkish-Dutch patients and, to a lesser extent, native-Dutch patients as well, the information they need. GPs should be trained in giving adequate, tailored information to patients with various ethnic and cultural backgrounds. Copyright Â© 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

But how does this work in times of foreign occupation? Is it even possible then, or does it almost automatically lead to collaboration? The Dutch example of 1940-1945 gives some insight into this problem. Abandoning its post would end the aid the Dutch Red Cross (DRC) gave, so it was decided to stay in business. This, however, led to adherence to German orders, given not for humanitarian, but for military-political reasons. Amongst other things, the DRC helped to equip a field hospital for Dutch volunteers to the Waffen-SS on the eastern front, so directly strengthening the German war effort. It was clear that the doctors and nurses of this field hospital would do next to nothing to help save Russian sick or wounded, and that, if necessary, they would have to fight alongside German and Dutch soldiers.\n\nThe influence of four macrozoobenthic species on the abundance of the amphipod Corophium volutator on tidal flats of the Wadden Sea\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nFlach, E. C.\n\nOn the tidal flats of the Wadden Sea, a zonation pattern can be found with Corophium volutator and Nereis diversicolor as the dominating species of the upper intertidal zone and Arenicola marina and Cerastoderma edule as the dominating species of the lower zone. As C. volutator can live under a great variety of physical conditions, its restriction to higher areas might result from biotic interactions. This was investigated by field experiments on a tidal flat in the westernmost part of the Wadden Sea. Within large depopulated areas, small plots were recolonized with different densities of N. diversicolor, A. marina, C. edule and Macoma balthica and the subsequent settlement and dynamics of C. volutator were studied. In addition, A. marina and/or C. edule were added to or removed from small plots within a natural benthic community. Neither the presence of M. balthica not that of N. diversicolor significantly affected the abundance of C. volutator. A strongly negative effect was found of C. edule when present in high densities, whereas A. marina negatively affected C. volutator abundance already at relatively low densities. Local removals of A. marina and C. edule from their own zone resulted in increases of Corophium numbers at these locations and local additions of these species within the Corophium zone resulted in decreases of Corophium numbers at these locations. It is suggested that the major species to restrict C. volutator effectively to the upper tidal zone is A. marina.\n\nHow to structure and prioritize information needs in support of monitoring design for Integrated Coastal Management\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nVugteveen, Pim; van Katwijk, Marieke M.; Rouwette, EtiÃ«nne; Hanssen, Lucien\n\n2014-02-01\n\nIntegrated Coastal Management cannot operate effectively without reliable information and knowledge on changes in the environment and on the causes of those changes. Monitoring is essential to provide data needed for a real understanding of socio-economic and ecological functioning in multi-user nature areas. We present a web-based and comprehensive assessment methodology to articulate, structure and prioritize information needs and ensuing monitoring needs. We applied this methodology in the Dutch Wadden Sea Region, which includes a designated UNESCO World Heritage nature reserve. The methodology consists of the following steps: i) exploring social-ecological issues of concern and defining the monitoring scope; ii) articulating information needs expressed as tractable questions; iii) elaborating monitoring needs; iv) grounding in scientific models and current monitoring; v) synthesizing assessment findings into target entities, i.e. analysis variables for monitoring. In this paper we focus on the first three steps. As part of our methodology we performed two online surveys amongst a broad range of stakeholders and amongst monitoring professionals. In the case of the Dutch Wadden Sea Region, main monitoring questions were related to biodiversity and food web relations; effects of fisheries and its pressures on the ecosystem; channel and port dredging; spatial planning and multifunctional use; sustainable energy production; and effects of changing storm regimes due to climate change. Subsequently we elaborated these general issues into analysis variables within five themes. The presented methodology enables large scale and unbiased involvement of stakeholders in articulating information needs in a multi-user nature reserve like the Wadden Sea. In addition the methodology facilitates the input and feedback of monitoring professionals by providing a detailed elaboration of monitoring needs.\n\nWill Dutch Become Flemish?

We ask whether there are differences in the verbal interaction of Dutch GPs with immigrant and Dutch patients. Data were drawn from 144 adult patient interviews and video observations of consultations between the patients and 31 Dutch GPs. The patient group consisted of 61 non-Western immigrants (Turkish, Moroccan, Surinamese, Antillean, Cape Verdian) and 83 Dutch participants. Affective and instrumental aspects of verbal communication were assessed using Roter's Interaction Analysis System (RIAS). Patients' cultural background was assessed by ethnicity, language proficiency, level of education, religiosity and cultural views (in terms of being more traditional or more modern). Consultations with the non-Western immigrant patients (especially those from Turkey and Morocco) were well over 2 min shorter, and the power distance between GPs and these patients was greater when compared to the Dutch patients. Major differences in verbal interaction were observed on the affective behavior dimensions, but not on the instrumental dimensions. Doctors invested more in trying to understand the immigrant patients, while in the case of Dutch patients they showed more involvement and empathy. Dutch patients seemed to be more assertive in the medical conversation. The differences are discussed in terms of patients' ethnic background, cultural views (e.g. practicing a religion) and linguistic barriers. It is concluded that attention to cultural diversity does matter, as this leads to different medical communication patterns. A two-way strategy is recommended for improving medical communication, with implications for both doctor and patient behavior.\n\nDifferential relationships between language skills and working memory in Turkish-Dutch and native-Dutch first-graders from low-income families.\n\nPubMed\n\nBosman, Anna M T; Janssen, Marije\n\n2017-01-01\n\nIn the Netherlands, Turkish-Dutch children constitute a substantial group of children who learn to speak Dutch at the age of four after they learned to speak Turkish. These children are generally academically less successful. Academic success appears to be affected by both language proficiency and working memory skill. The goal of this study was to investigate the relationship between language skills and working memory in Turkish-Dutch and native-Dutch children from low-income families. The findings revealed reduced Dutch language and Dutch working-memory skills for Turkish-Dutch children compared to native-Dutch children. Working memory in native-Dutch children was unrelated to their language skills, whereas in Turkish-Dutch children strong correlations were found both between Turkish language skills and Turkish working-memory performance and between Dutch language skills and Dutch working-memory performance. Reduced language proficiencies and reduced working-memory skills appear to manifest itself in strong relationships between working memory and language skills in Turkish-Dutch children.
