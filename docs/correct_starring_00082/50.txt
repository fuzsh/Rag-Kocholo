Actor Bill Murray will appear in Sony’s new “Ghostbusters” film, TheWrap has learned.

Murray starred in 1984’s original “Ghostbusters” and 1989’s “Ghostbusters II” alongside Dan Aykroyd, Harold Ramis, Ernie Hudson and Sigourney Weaver.

Appearing on CBS’ “Late Show” in 2011, Murray called the idea of appearing in a new “Ghostbusters” film “crazy talk.”

The nature of Murray’s role in the new movie is not yet known.

Sony announced in 2014 that it would reboot the long-dormant film franchise with director Paul Feig and a female cast.

The studio subsequently revealed that Kristen Wiig, Melissa McCarthy, Kate McKinnon and Leslie Jones would play the four leads. The film is currently in production.
