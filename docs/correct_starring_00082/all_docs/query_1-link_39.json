He also showed up in Paul Feig’s all-female reboot, but played a different character.\n\nHe told Vanity Fair in a behind-the-scenes interview: “The script is good. It’s got lots of emotion in it. It’s got lots of family in it, with through lines that are really interesting. It’s gonna work.”\n\n19 films to look out for in 2020\n\nShow all 19\n\nMurray’s co-stars Dan Aykroyd and Ernie Hudson will also return as Dr Ray Stanz and Winston Zeddemore, respectively.\n\nHarold Ramis, who played Dr Egon Spengler, died in 2014.\n\n“We are a man down,” Murray continued. “That’s the deal – and that’s the story that we’re telling, that’s the story they’ve written.”\n\nGhostbusters: Afterlife will be released in cinemas on 10 July.\n\nSubscribe to Independent Premium to bookmark this article\n\nWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?
