        "text": "Remembering Ivan Reitman (1946-2022)\n\nDevastating news today as we have learned Ivan Reitman has passed away at the age of 75. Affectionately known as the “man who loved to laugh,” notoriously so as comedians like Bill Murray would rib him for hearing his laughter during takes, Reitman leaves behind a filmography that defined a popular culture zeitgeist, collaboration with the greatest comedians of a generation, and a wonderful family who continue his talents for storytelling for a new generation.\n\n“Our family is grieving the unexpected loss of a husband, father, and grandfather who taught us to always seek the magic in life,” children Jason Reitman, Catherine Reitman and Caroline Reitman said in a joint statement. “We take comfort that his work as a filmmaker brought laughter and happiness to countless others around the world. While we mourn privately, we hope those who knew him through his films will remember him always.”\n\nReitman loved to tell stories about outsiders, the misfits like the kids in Meatballs, and the Delta House of Animal House, new recruits in Stripes, and an unsuspecting man called to be President in Dave. He loved his homes in Toronto and Montecito, and took great pride in both of them. His family land was donated to become the Toronto Bell Lightbox theater, host to the Toronto International Film Festival. He loved to collaborate with new and upcoming talents, and in later years boosted films like Old School and most recently guided his own son Jason on the production of Ghostbusters: Afterlife.\n\nI had the pleasure of meeting Ivan on several occasions. People like Ivan meet new faces all the time, and I would constantly re-introduce myself every time we’d meet. Finally after the fifth or sixth time shaking his hand and saying, “Hi Ivan, I’m Troy,” he wrinkled his brow and looked at me like I was nuts and said, “Yeah, I know who you are.” It was the strangest feeling to have someone that you’ve looked up to and admired for so long even just be aware of your existence, let alone know your name. I think it was indicative of just how much he appreciated fans of his work, and fellow fans of comedy, art, and just telling good stories.\n\nThis is incredibly tough, and words just aren’t coming sitting here trying to type this. I’m sure I’ll be able to articulate things far better after processing a bit. If there’s one consolation, Ivan was able to see the success of Ghostbusters: Afterlife before he passed. And he was there to tell a deeply personal and deeply moving story with his own son, and to have heard the overwhelmingly positive and emotional response from audiences.\n\nHere’s more from the Associated Press:\n\nKnown for big, bawdy comedies that caught the spirit of their time, Reitman’s big break came with the raucous, college fraternity sendup “National Lampoon’s Animal House,” which he produced. He directed Bill Murray in his first starring role in “Meatballs” and then again in “Stripes,” but his most significant success came with 1984’s “Ghostbusters.”\n\nNot only did the irreverent supernatural comedy starring Murray, Dan Aykroyd, Harold Ramis, Ernie Hudson, Sigourney Weaver and Rick Moranis gross nearly $300 million worldwide, it earned two Oscar nominations, spawned a veritable franchise, including spinoffs, television shows and a new movie, “Ghostbusters: Afterlife,” that opened this last year. His son, filmmaker Jason Reitman directed.\n\nAmong other notable films he directed are “Twins,” “Kindergarten Cop,” “Dave,” “Junior” and “Six Days, Seven Nights.” He also produced “Beethoven,” “Old School” and “EuroTrip,” and many others, including several for his son.\n\nHe was born in Komarmo, Czechoslovakia, in 1946 where his father owned the country’s biggest vinegar factory. When the communists began imprisoning capitalists after the war, the Reitmans decided to escape, when Ivan Reitman was only 4. They traveled in the nailed-down hold of a barge headed for Vienna.\n\n“I remember flashes of scenes,” Reitman told the AP in 1979. “Later they told me about how they gave me a couple of sleeping pills so I wouldn’t make any noise. I was so knocked out that I slept with my eyes open. My parents were afraid I was dead.”\n\nThe Reitmans joined a relative in Toronto, where Ivan displayed his show biz inclinations: starting a puppet theater, entertaining at summer camps, playing coffee houses with a folk music group. He studied music and drama at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario, and began making movie shorts.\n\nWith friends and $12,000, Reitman made a nine-day movie, “Cannibal Girls,” which American International agreed to release. He produced on a $500 budget a weekly TV revue, “Greed,” with Dan Aykroyd, and became associated with the Lampoon group in its off-Broadway revue that featured John Belushi, Gilda Radner and Murray. That soon led to “Animal House.”\n\nBy the time 1990’s “Kindergarten Cop” came around, Reitman had established himself as the most successful comedy director in history. Though not even being the father of three children could have prepared him for the arduous task of directing 30 children between the ages of 4 and 7 in the Arnold Schwarzenegger comedy.\n\nReitman slowed down as a director after “Six Days, Seven Nights” — only four films would follow “Evolution,” “My Super Ex-Girlfriend,” “No Strings Attached” and “Draft Day,” from 2014.\n\nBut he continued producing and, with “Ghostbusters: Afterlife,” even found himself on the press circuit with his son, providing emotional moments for both with the passing of the baton.\n\nWhen asked late last year why the 1984 film continued to fascinate, Reitman told the AP that it was hard to define.\n\n“I always had a sort of sincere approach to the comedy,” he said. “I took it seriously even though, it was a horror movie and a comedy, I felt you had to sort of deal with it in a kind of realistic and honest way.”\n\nGet Ready for the Afterlife - New Trailer Debuts Tomorrow!\n\nThe wait is finally over!\n\nThe past couple weeks, you could almost sense the build-up to something big coming and today the veil of mystery has been lifted.

About 1.5K people waiting so far!\n\nIvan Reitman is saying hello to McKenna Grace. A bit of a technical issue, but it’s almost like joining a party line phone conversation with everyone.\n\nJim at IGN is introducing us to the panel which includes Jason Reitman, Ivan Reitman, McKenna Grace, Carrie Coon, Finn Wolfhard, Celeste O’Connor, and Logan Kim. The panel is split into two parts - the first being a few conversations about the film, the second being a trivia game.\n\nJim sounds a little nervous as he introduces Carrie Coon as Callie, the strong-willed mom. Phoebe, the “young scientist of the group” played by McKenna Grace, Logan Kim plays PODCAST character name reveal! They’re still having technological problems, Carrie Coon and Logan Kim aren’t joined.\n\nFather and son are ready to go, Ivan jokes about being the eldest person on the line and being able to get connected and participate. Jim says that this is the first film to have a family story in the Ghostbusters franchise.\n\nJason Reitman, \"My father always described the first one about four guys that go into business. I have to admit that I never imagined making a Ghostbusters film. It was a film that I grew up on. I couldn’t imagine picking up the proton pack. It was too daunting and scary. The concept for Afterlife came to me in a few images and the more I thought about it, this story began to evolve. And that’s when it became a family, that’s the first way I saw it. I saw a young girl with a proton pack in the middle of a wheat field. I imagined a young boy finding Ecto-1 and it doesn’t work, and imagined him Tokyo Drifting through that same wheat field.”\n\nIvan, “It’s okay to talk about it as a family film because the main characters are a family. But really it’s a Ghostbusters movie. This movie, much like the first two captures the spirit in the comedy and the scares and the emotionality of those first two. And I’m proud that Jason was behind this and worked it out.”\n\nIvan now talking about it being the greatest thing a father can have to see his son succeed him.\n\nJim at IGN opens it up to the cast, hoping that everyone is setup to hear and speak. Logan and Carrie do not seem to be in the group still.\n\nJason, “Paul Rudd’s character is Mr. Grooberson. That’s the correct pronunciation of that name.”\n\nJim at IGN throws to McKenna and Finn to talk about where they were when they got the call they were going to be in a Ghostbusters movie. Finn says that it wasn’t a call, it was a weird fever dream. He had self-taped at his room in Vancouver and didn’t know he was auditioning for Ghostbusters. Then he got an email that was cryptic asking him to come to Jason Reitman’s house in Los Angeles and read the script. Arriving at the house, that’s when he found out the movie was Ghostbusters. He read the script which was still a work in progress and then after feels like it was the easiest audition of his life, he showed up at a person’s house that he respects and was asked to do it. “I couldn’t believe it. That was easy. And then it was like the joy of getting to be there with Celeste and getting to be there when Jason cast her. It was an incredible experience.”\n\nMcKenna was shooting in Atlanta and had auditioned multiple times being told that “it was an important film but you can’t know what it was.” She got to read with Logan Kim and they had a proton pack. That was a big giveaway.\n\nDiscussing now this being a Ghostbusters film that doesn’t take place in New York, it’s a small town film. Jason shouts out Gil Kennen the writer who is in attendance listening but is not participating. Jason and Gil wanted to go somewhere new with the film, they wanted this to feel as though we were discovering Ghostbusters equipment in a new place. Jason is being careful to not give anything away. The film had to get out of the city and had to be about a family discovering who they were. It made sense to get out of the city and to someplace that didn’t look anything like the first two films. The color palate and all of the iconic images like the packs and traps are there, but it will look and feel like a new location.\n\nCeleste’s character is named LUCKY, she’s a girl from a small town in the middle of nowhere. The town is her home, but she’s always wanted to get out and is searching for something more. She meets the new kid in town at the diner she works at (Finn) and becomes his friend and learns what’s going on in his life. She finds herself in that adventure that she’s always been searching for.\n\nIvan talking about the Ecto-1 being discovered in a dilapidated state and it being wonderful that Finn’s character gets to work on it and bring it back to life. A lot of time has passed since we saw it, and a lot of things have changed. We’ll discover those things in the film. Finn has a moment with the Ecto-1 that has to be a real kick in getting behind the wheel. Finn says, “It was the coolest. I don’t know how else to describe it. The Ecto-1 - it’s not like we were filming on a greenscreen. We were driving this car that had a Corvette engine in it. It was completely souped-up.” Finn asks Ivan where the cars came from?\n\nJason says, it’s an extraordinarily rare car. They only made 100 of those body types in 1959. They wanted to get every detail right. He respects it all so much, and says he was heartbroken that the ladder was on the wrong side and people didn’t know that it was on the wrong side. Finn, “See look, it’s different. There was a reason why.” Jim at IGN brings up the gunner seat. Jason says that he’s loved this car his entire life and thinks it’s one of the coolest cars in film history. They worked with amazing car people to bring it back to life and “juiced the hell out of it.” Jason makes fun of his dad for the original shot of the Ecto-1 cranking out of the firehouse because it was sped-up. He wanted the car to REALLY fly. “We really got that car going.” Jason says that he and Gil wanted to know what Egon had done with Ecto-1 over the course of the years that we haven’t seen them. That was one of the great thrills on this film, was getting to come up with these improvements. “We wanted to put Ghostbusting into motion. The characters were often standing on their feet and holding a line, there was something static about it. We wanted to bring Ghostbusting up to 75 miles per hour.”\n\nMcKenna talking about it being a dream come true to be in the gunner seat of the Ecto-1, not wanting to spoil anything. But she says that it was “absolutely magical.”\n\nJim at IGN asking about Paul Rudd’s role in the movie and how he stumbles into the universe. Jason, “He’s a science teacher. Science has always been essential to Ghostbusters. Phoebe who McKenna plays is a scientist and finds herself in summer school filled with delinquents and Grooberson becomes a mentor for her.”\n\nMcKenna talking about it being super-cool to see all the gizmos, she hates to say that she “grew up” with Ghostbusters because she’s only 14. Getting to see the packs and traps and getting to play with them has been insane. Finn says that Jason got to write the film as a fan, it’s a Ghostbusters movie but Jason is a fan. “It comes from a really respectful place when it comes to being a fan.” Finn says that fans will appreciate that there’s CG in the movie, but Jason from the beginning was adamant that he would be using a lot of practical effects. Especially with the props, make-up, sets, and backgrounds. “That to me is why I was over the moon being on set, because it really felt like we were making a movie back in the 80’s. Ghostbusters is such a big franchise, but it didn’t feel like we were filming a big movie in the best way possible. It was like we were added to this family reunion.”\n\nCeleste says that Lucky is a little skeptical about the existence of ghosts at first. Becoming friends with Finn’s character, she gets pulled into it though. For her she said it was cool to be working on a big studio film, the project she did before this was a small indie movie and going from that to Ghostbusters was crazy. Seeing all the gadgets she was overwhelmed coming onto set. “Do I belong here? How did I get here?” She jokes. She says her dad was a huge fan of the movies and showed them to his kids when they were younger.\n\nCarrie is now on the chat! “Grandma figured it out!” She jokes that they only have about thirty seconds left probably. She jokes that Paul Rudd is “a miserable human being.” She says that she’s playing a mom trying to make ends meet and desperately trying to keep them afloat. She hasn’t had a lot of time for other parts of her life, and when she meets someone like Rudd’s character Grooberson, she gets to have some fun. She compliments Rudd saying that he’s wonderful and sweet.\n\nJim at IGN praises the ensemble that Jason’s team brought together. Asks what the Ecto-Goggles do, wishing that Logan Kim were there. Jason says that there “is no way to not lose your cool when you put on a proton pack. There’s a unique smile that happens when someone puts on the pack and holds the wand. I don’t care how old you are, you just become a kid again. I knew we cast the right people, because every time they put on the pack their thrill and passion was so true.” Jason shifts to talking about the Ecto-Goggles, saying that they now take Polaroid photos.\n\nMcKenna talks about putting on the proton pack, she says that she cried. Jason, “You actually did cry. My father was there too, it was wonderful.” McKenna jokes that she hasn’t gotten used to it still, even after three months of filming. Finn says that McKenna put them on during the camera test and losing her balance because of how heavy they are. Jokes about the original packs being so heavy - McKenna says that they’re still heavy. Ivan says that Dan Akyroyd and Bill Murray came on set and picked up the packs and said they were WAY lighter.\n\nCarrie jokes that proton packs are real now, that’s the biggest difference. Jason says that the proton pack is the same one that we know and remember. The mold that was used to build it was built off of one of the original 1984 packs. They just tried to do the visual storytelling, what little welds and splits and cracks and things that make you feel like the packs have been used for three decades. Jason talks about working with craftspeople who grew up loving Ghostbusters. Arjen their creature designer and Ben the armorer were artisans who have less opportunities to do their craft practically, who also grew up loving Ghostbusters. “You can see their joy in the finished work.”\n\nJim at IGN asks if any of them have had ghost experiences. Ivan talks about Dan’s experiences and his family’s history. Ivan says he was and is skeptical. Dan’s enthusiasm made them take things seriously. “I still have those conversations with Dan.” Jim asks who the Dan Aykroyd of the cast is. Jason says that Logan is the true believer in ghosts. “He is 100% ready to believe.”\n\nFinn praising Logan Kim, he came from Texas and had no acting experience aside from a FedEx commercial. And he has quickly become the heart of the movie. “He walked on set like he was a 70-year old character actor, like he was kind of over it,” Finn jokes. They all couldn’t believe it. “Everyone is going to know him.” Jason says that Logan was the most confident actor on set out of the bunch.\n\nCarrie says that she grew up on an old farm house, there were things she can’t explain and things we don’t understand, but is skeptical. She believes in science and wants proof.\n\nMcKenna is going to try FaceTiming Logan so that he can join them. She says that it rang for a second and he sent her to voicemail. Carrie jokes that he’s probably talking to his manager. “He’s firing someone for sure now,” Finn jokes. Jason jokes about him being the Daniel Day Lewis. Finn jokes that Logan already has an 800 number like Bill Murray.\n\nMcKenna gets Logan on via her phone to say something, “How are all of you today?” He asks. Everyone says that he’s a legend already. Jim at IGN asks him what it’s like to be a living legend. “To be part of Ghostbusters, that’s a huge honor. I don’t even know how I got to this point in life but here we are.” Logan is asked what he can say about the Ecto-Goggles. Logan says that the goggles are for locating and identifying ghosts and their classes. In Afterlife he can take pictures of them. “I have to say, that’s probably my favorite feature about them. Just to press that button felt so cool.” Logan says he could barely see out of them on-set through the two little slots. One time he whacked McKenna in the face with them because he couldn’t see.\n\nMcKenna and Finn talk about Logan tripping and falling all the time. Jason says that they were always trying to get them to balance the way that Aykroyd always has them, but it was harder than they thought it would be. Finn says that Jason was giving Logan notes to look in a direction and Logan looked directly at him and was like, “Jason, I can’t see.”\n\nCarrie Coon allows her son Haskell to say hello to everyone.\n\nJim at IGN turns conversation back toward Stay Puft. Jason corrects him, “We have NEW characters, the Mini-Pufts.” Jason says that the Mini-Pufts want to watch the world burn. And they really enjoy it. Jim talks about Plasma Mini-Puft three packs with three articulated figures and heads that you can build your own marshmallow army. PRODUCT REVEAL! They are the same size as they are in the film, 1:1 scale. And they can be pre-ordered on Hasbro Pulse now!\n\nConversation shifting to a trivia game, finishing a Ghostbusters quote. Won’t be updating for this time to give these old frail typist hands a breath.\n\nThe trivia game forces Jason to give his Brownstone Boy #2 quote to everyone.\n\nJim at IGN wrapping things up, Ghostbusters Afterlife opens only in theaters November 11th. And that’s all for the Twitter Spaces event!\n\n3PM\n\nNew Images\n\nIGN during the Twitter Spaces event revealed a few new images from the film.\n\n4PM\n\nHasbro\n\nMore information and photos care of our friends at Hasbro for their reveals today.

The younger-skewing Sony Pictures Animation project is being creatively spearheaded by Ivan Reitman and his production company Ghost Corps. Ghostbusters: Ecto Force is eyeing an early 2018 debut.\n\nNo word on additional creative team (art director, writers, etc.) but we'll keep you posted as we hear more. Very exciting seeing the possibility of what everything will bring, especially with a premise that is set in the canon universe but more than 30 years in the future. Shade of Dan Aykroyd's original drafts coming to life?\n\nSony and Ghost Corps Open the Gates to a Lucky Few\n\nThe big story today is, quite obviously, the first Ghostbusters trailer in nearly thirty years. Once again the familiar tones of Ray Parker Jr.'s iconic theme, the familiar sights, the jump scares, and the laughs are on the big screen and it's a glorious thing.\n\nWhat might be buried under the lead today is the tremendous branch that Sony and the newly-formed Ivan Reitman production company Ghost Corps extended to a select few fans, and the great lengths they went to make a memorable day for them. It's unfortunate that not everyone was able to attend, but when I refer to a select few there was still quite a gathering of fans from all around the country that were given a rare pass inside the gates of the Sony Pictures Studios, allowed to view the trailer with select members of the press in advance, and get to meet and thank some of their heroes - who were just as thankful and gracious in return.\n\nThe morning on Wednesday was chaotic, a very complicated press and marketing day with a lot of moving parts that, make no mistake, usually does not accompany a trailer launch but rather the proper premiere of the film. But the chaos was good natured, more of a buzz of excitement rather than an uncomfortable clutter. As fans arrived, some having driven through the night and the wee hours of the morning to make a 9am arrival time, they walked onto the studio lot and immediately caught a glimpse not just of the original 1959 Caddy Ectomobile, but its new \"modern\" counterpart waiting in the courtyard during their walk. It wasn't uncommon during that walk to hear gasps, backpacks and purses drop to the floor, and Ghostheads in full regalia go running toward the cars and immediately start posing for photo opportunities.\n\nSony laid out a spread of props, coffee and pastries for the fans and the press as they waited - many fans who have have discussed so many topics at so much length over the internet for years but were only meeting in person for the very first time. I have to admit, in the years that I've spent covering Ghostbusters and trying to be an industrious member of the community, I've been somewhat of a hermit in social gatherings and meeting people \"IRL\" as the kids say. Do they still say that? Whatever, it's irrelevant, Sony's Cary Grant theater quickly became overrun by flight suits, proton packs, and a whole lot of smiles.\n\nEveryone was led into the theater and seated - fans were placed in the front rows, proton packs were catered to with care, and Ivan Reitman was up first to greet everyone and introduce Paul Feig. After quick introductions everyone was treated to the trailer...\n\nI was so thankful that when fans chanted \"one more time\" because I was so overwhelmed with the first viewing of the trailer - after all this time, after all this waiting, it was too much of a blur to completely comprehend. A surreal experience where, by the time you realize you're watching a new Ghostbusters trailer, you're looking at the end sell cards at its tail. On the second viewing, I was able to have more of a genuine reaction (something that happened as well in watching The Force Awakens over the holidays, you're able to absorb more on the second viewing after so much anticipation).\n\nFollowing the trailer viewing, a Q&A discussion with Ivan Reitman, Paul Feig and writer Katie Dippold commenced. It was a lively conversation, with so many great details that were revealed about the production process and the things that we've yet to still see. That entire discussion will be heard as a bonus episode of the Interdimensional Crossrip tomorrow.\n\nThe theatrical presentation came to a close and everyone flooded into the walkways of the lot outside, and back to the comfort of Ghost Corps' front yard which houses both Ectomobiles. Group photos were taken, autographs were signed, interviews for EPK, the Ghostheads documentary, and several other outlets were completed. And then Reitman took a position at the top of the stairs to the Grant Building and held court, presenting the franchises with certificates of their registration with Ghost Corps, shaking their hands, and posing for photos. After all of the certificates were handed out, more photos were taken and the crowd started to disperse. Paul Feig shook so many hands, graciously thanked everyone, and signed as many autographs as he could before his representatives shooed him away. During the Q&A, he made a point to talk about seeing the original Ghostbusters film for the first time and how much it impacted him. His love for the film, especially for all of the technology, is abundantly clear in the trailer and how he speaks of the film to come, and certainly was evident in the energy and enthusiasm he had for all of the fans on site.\n\nThat event in and of itself would have been extremely generous of all involved, but that's not where the day ended. Fans were then invited into a dining area near the theater for a catered lunch that featured themed foods and of course, gourmet Twinkies for dessert. As fans sat at giant roundtables and discussed everything that had just occurred (some lively discussions, some more tempered as exhaustion began to set in for some of those who had been up through the night), the room buzzed again as Ivan Reitman stepped in and went from table to table to have quick quality chats with each. As he sipped his coffee and the fans ate, they talked about the new film, the future of the franchise, and even shared laughs over how his other films like Meatballs were responsible for so many childhoods.\n\nAs shuttles and cars began to leave and the crowd thinned, the smiles were still present. It truly was a wonderful day in which the warmth, the love, and the respect between everyone involved was incredibly evident and it once again was clear that the fans are coming first. With so many dedicated fans, so many franchises, and so many active members of the community, not everyone could be included - but the gesture on the part of the studio and the production company was enormous and most likely only the first indication of many more things to come, in which I'm sure a greater number will be able to feel the love.\n\nDissecting an Encounter with the EPA\n\nIn the process of doing a little clean-up on my computer, I recently came across an analysis I had done in school for the blocking/setup of Peter Venkman's first encounter with Walter Peck in the original 1984 film. It was an exercise in dissecting a scene from a film to determine how blocking, camera setup and composition, lighting, editorial, music and directorial choices impacted the overall effectiveness of the scene.\n\nGoing back and re-reading it, I'm actually still fascinated with the findings and thought I'd share them with the masses... so here you go, here's my original essay from December of 2002 (and the scene courtesy of Ghostbusters.net for reference).\n\nI chose to analyze this particular scene from “Ghostbusters” because it was one of the first things that I noticed after learning about analyzing the beats of a scene in class. It was an interesting realization to me because “Ghostbusters” has been a film that I have greatly admired and respected (and viewed countless times) and had never really noticed the structure to it like this before. It also adds so much to the relationship between the protagonist and the antagonist that I had not really caught onto and makes their rivalry that heats to the climax so much more memorable.\n\nThere is one beat to the scene really, however since there are two separate levels to the scene it could be said that there are two separate beats. The first beat hits the moment that Venkman tells Peck that he may not see the storage facility. It turns the tables, suddenly Peck goes from running the show to having resistance to his request. On a sub-level to the scene, the beat hits when Peter realizes that he’s being accused of fraud (not to mention there’s a hint that he knows that he’s operating without the required permits). This beat comes the moment of Peck’s monologue that accuses Venkman and the Ghostbusters of polluting with noxious gasses etc.\n\nThe scene proves to be more of a serious note in an otherwise light and goofy comedy. While “Ghostbusters” isn’t exactly a National Lampoon film, it is a very light and genre pieced blockbuster comedy. It is lit very lightly and vibrantly. The actors quip funny lines frequently. This scene fits well into the film because it highlights the smart-ass remarks of Venkman adding some comic relief to the tension.\n\nThe pacing of the scene is very casual and slow at first. The shots are a bit longer and since they are wider shots, they seem to be orienting the viewer as to their surroundings and the characters before they get into the thick of things. There are brief pauses between the characters’ lines at first. Then it begins to pick up pace as the two realize that they both have other motives behind the meeting. The actors begin to read their lines quicker after the line “Why do you want to see the storage facility?” Peck realizes that he’s getting nowhere and will continue to go nowhere and begins attacking. It is a gradual process, however.\n\nThe scene begins with a wide shot as the two characters are introduced to each other. It quickly cuts to a tilt that reveals the “slime on the suit” gag. Then cuts back to an even wider shot to not only establish Peter Venkman’s office once again (it appears earlier in the film when Peter first meets Dana Barrett) but to establish the casual, and ordinary meeting of the two characters. The first close up is the first moment that a hostile line is spoken. When Peck asks, “What exactly are you a doctor of?” in a very sarcastic and inquisitive tone is the first moment we are drawn into a close up. A close, but high angle on Venkman as he answers the question shows that Venkman didn’t expect the attack at first. As the questioning continues, Peck walks away to turn his close-up into a medium shot (which then cuts back to a new setup medium shot of Venkman in the exact same placement as Peck). Then it’s back to a close up as Peck asks “May I see the storage facility?” Venkman says no and immediately it cuts to a 2 shot where the actors are on the same level, the same plane, worthy opponents for each other. Back to even closer shots of both filling the frame intercut with 2 shots where they appear to be right in each others’ faces (as the tensions get high toward the end of the scene). Again, on the same level on the same plane. Venkman stands to take dominance in the scene (fills the frame with a tilt up to an Extreme Close Up) which is immediately matched in an identical shot by Peck (tilt up to Extreme Close Up mirrored to Venkman) to show that indeed, these two will be butting heads on the same level again.\n\nThe main character (Venkman) achieves his goal of pushing Peck away with the activation of his defense mechanism that is established the moment that the character is introduced. He knows that he is superior to everyone else and quips wisecracks at the expense of those below him. As Peck threatens with unlicensed waste handling, Venkman’s objective quickly goes from schmoozing with the government official to threatening law suit and trying to push his adversary away.\n\nAs far as acting methods go, the actors begin casual. As it becomes apparent to their characters that there are tensions between the two of them and that they will be facing off against each other, they begin limiting the space between them. Both are unwilling to budge. While Peck (William Atherton) was quick to walk away and present the conversation with a comfortable distance, as soon as Venkman (Bill Murray) resists, they are in each other’s faces fighting for dominance in the scene. The movement of Peck as he sits down to look Venkman eye to eye pits them on the same battlefield, then at the end of the argument, Venkman stands to become dominant and Peck quickly counters getting to eye level again. Again, neither of them are willing to back down.\n\nIn addition to the actual dialogue in the scene, actions that the actors take (for example, Venkman is slouching in his chair during the beginning of the conversation fidgeting with a paperweight) show their perspectives on the conversation. In addition, costume direction plays an important role. Venkman is sloppy, worn from working hard, slime covered. Peck is dressed in a nice suit with a power tie. Their hair is also the same polar opposite. Venkman’s is unkempt while Peck’s is neatly arranged. Without the dialogue, we immediately have a sense of the roles each character takes.\n\nAs far as shot composition and cinematography go, again the entire scene is lit very evenly and very brightly. The shots are setup to associate Venkman with chaos, clutter, and disorder (the desk in front of him is messy, behind him an empty potato chip bag and more of a mess). Peck is associated with straight lines and order (he is shot with the walls and the file cabinets behind him. Both are very heavy metaphors for their personality.\n\nThere is little foley to the scene and there is no music added.\n\nJudging from the final edit, it appears that there were 12 setups. 3 of them included a pan and a tilt, 2 of them tilted up to follow the characters, 1 moving pan became a planned 2 shot of both characters. The editing seems to be a simple back and forth from character to character. Again, it seems to speed up and move to the tighter and closer shots as the tensions between the two characters grow. As both of them become familiar with each other, the audience becomes “closer” acquainted with the two of them. The pacing also mirrors this concept. It grows faster, with the lines being read quicker and the cuts getting more frequent toward the end of the scene. It builds the tension, deepening the argument between the two characters as they get further and further into it.\n\nThe scene seems to be from Venkman’s point of view. Obviously, since it begins casual and friendly we are led to believe that this was what Venkman was expecting from the encounter. Had the scene been from Peck’s point of view, I’m sure that it would have been less friendly and more confrontational from the start. Peck was there to stir up trouble and it took a while for Venkman to catch onto that. Then again, when the EPA comes knocking at your door, it normally just isn’t a friendly chit chat is it?"
