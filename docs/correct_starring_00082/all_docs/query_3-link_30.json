        "text": "Bill Murray ain’t afraid of no reboot.\n\nThe actor, who played Dr. Peter Venkman in Ghostbusters (1984) and Ghostbusters II (1989), will appear in director Paul Feig‘s upcoming installment of the franchise, The Hollywood Reporter has confirmed.\n\nRead more Emma Stone: I Turned Down ‘Ghostbusters‘ Because “It’s a Whole Thing”\n\nMurray has long been resistant to star in a third Ghostbusters. He told David Letterman earlier this year that his hesitancy stems from Ghostbusters II not having been as well-received as the first one.\n\nFeig’s film, which is currently shooting, stars Melissa McCarthy, Kristen Wiig, Kate McKinnon, Leslie Jones and Chris Hemsworth. It hits theaters on July 22, 2016."
