        "text": "“Human sacrifice, dogs and cats living together &mldr; mass hysteria!” — Dr. Peter Venkman, “Ghostbusters” (1984)\n\n“Ghostbusters” was a big deal when it came out in the summer of 1984, while “Ghostbusters II,” which came out five years later, not so much because it was awful.\n\nThe original — which I saw at Showcase Cinema in downtown Worcester numerous times during its first run — was clever, whimsical and funny.\n\nIt had a great original concept (shortly after three parapsychologist friends start a ghost-catching business in New York City, business starts booming to biblical proportions), a lot of quotable lines (“He slimed me” for instance), a memorable bureaucratic villain (EPA inspector Walter Peck played by William Atherton, four years before he played an even slimier TV reporter, Richard Thornburg, in “Die Hard”), a catchy theme song (Ray Parker Jr.’s rip-off of Huey Lewis and the News’ “I Want A New Drug”) and one of the best sight gags to come out of a movie (a 100-foot-tall Stay Puft Marshmallow Man making mincemeat out of New York City).\n\nTop this off with the beloved team of Bill Murray as Dr. Peter Venkman, Dan Aykroyd as Ray Stantz and Harold Ramis (Murray’s buddy in “Stripes”) as Egon Spengler at their comedic best and you have an instant classic.\n\nThe jury isn’t out yet for “Ghostbusters: Afterlife,” which has two of the three principal “Ghostbusters” returning (Murray and Aykroyd; Ramis died in 2014), plus Ernie Hudson, Sigourney Weaver and Annie Potts reprising their roles from the original films.\n\nWhat, no Rick Moranis, the nerdy accountant who becomes possessed by the ancient “Keymaster” or the aforementioned Atherton?\n\n“Ghostbusters: Afterlife” looks like a well-intended flick but I am afraid it’s going to be too heavy on nostalgia (and not laughs), too many new characters that we don’t care about and a tear-jerker backstory for Paul Rudd (aka People magazine's 2021 Sexiest Man Alive”) and a bunch of fresh-faced whippersnappers.\n\nAlso, it seems likely that the appearances of Murray and Aykroyd (both of whom I met) are going to be nothing more than glorified cameo roles. I hope I’m wrong. And I hope their appearances in the new film are as memorable as when I met them.\n\nQuick question: what does downtown Worcester look like on a typical Sunday?\n\nAnswer: A ghost town.\n\nSo if you are Bill Murray walking on the city streets on a Sunday and you’re trying to blend in, you’re going to stick out like a sore thumb, which was the case on the evening of April 22, 2018.\n\nThe “Ghostbusters” star was in town for “Bill Murray, Jan Vogler and Friends: New Worlds,” an evening of music, poetry and prose at The Hanover Theatre and Conservatory for the Performing Arts.\n\nAfter I parked my car at the old Worcester Center garage around 6:30 p.m., I noticed this tall, lanky old guy walk past me. And, I immediately realized it was Bill Murray.\n\nHow did I know it was Bill Murray?\n\nNobody walks in downtown Worcester. Nothing is open. There’s nowhere to go. There’s nothing to do. It’s a ghost town.\n\nAlso, he wasn’t talking to himself nor did he smell of urine.\n\nFurthermore, he didn’t approach us (I was attending the show with my brother) and beg for money.\n\nAnd then there was the way Murray was dressed. He was wearing a chartreuse knit hat on his head, a flashy dress shirt, an expensive wristwatch, nice casual trousers and what appeared to be $6,000 pair of Italian shoes.\n\nI wanted to tell him how big of a fan I was and how I was looking forward to seeing the big show that night. So I decided to follow him up Mechanics Street.\n\nAs Bill turned the corner on Main Street at the old Shack’s building, the comedian did a complete about face, jumped in the air, landed in a fighting stance and said, “How would you like it if I kicked you both in the nuts?”\n\nThis was clearly Bill Murray. His voice was very precise and even keeled and he just threatened me. He wasn’t doing shtick. He was dead serious. I didn’t know if I should laugh or cry or run away or ask forgiveness.\n\nMy next thought was “Nuts?” What are you a squirrel? I haven’t heard the term “Nuts” since I was in third grade. I wanted to say, “Bill, if you want to blend in in Worcester, instead of using the term 'Nuts' take your first name, change the 'I' to an 'A' and add an 'S.' Now you can start blending in in Worcester.” But I did not dare.\n\nThen, I came up with three possible ways to respond to Bill’s original question.\n\n“I wouldn’t.”\n\n“I would.”\n\nAnd, finally, “I would prefer you took your shoe off first and used your stocking foot.”\n\nI was still in shock from the situation. And with my hands up in a surrender pose, I apologetically begged the comedian’s forgiveness and said, “Bill, I’m a big fan. I’m reviewing the show tonight.”\n\nMurray, once again speaking even keel, without breaking into a smile or lightening up the mood of his delivery said, “You know I was only joking?” Bill Murray wasn’t joking.\n\nI am totally convinced that the “I was only joking” line is a disclaimer that Murray’s lawyers have told him to say whenever he gets into a potential situation (like this one) where he wants to knock someone’s block off.\n\nGoing into that night, I knew that Murray had a reputation for violent mood swings and fist-a-cuffs.\n\nBefore parting ways (for now), Murray said, “You shouldn’t sneak up on somebody like that.”\n\nIn what unfolded as a highbrow (but never stuffy) “Prairie Home Companion,” Murray's two-hours-and-10-minutes performance at the Hanover Theatre was smart and funny at times, emotional and moving other times, inspiring and entertaining throughout.\n\nThere were a few people who were dressed up like Ghostbusters in the audience that probably didn’t appreciate the humor of James Thurber but at least they weren’t threatened with grievous bodily harm before the show started.\n\nRound Two: Bill’s publicist invited me to meet the comedian after the show. I accepted.\n\nThe publicist went in to see Bill and said something on the lines that the reporter from the local newspaper here. He would like to say hi.\n\nBill comes out, stands in front of me, looks up and down at me from head to toe, makes a snorting sound, dismisses me with his hand and walked away without saying a word. His publicist looked puzzled. I was dumbfounded.\n\nThe back stage area wasn’t that big to begin with and there were very few people in it. And I had nowhere to hide. Bill walked by me several times, ignoring me like I was an ugly house plant.\n\nEventually, Bill stopped and said, \"All right, OK, what do you want?\"\n\nI told him the show was great and I was going to give him a glowing review in the paper.\n\nMurray snapped, “Gee, that’s really going to help sell tickets tonight.”\n\nOuch.\n\nI told him it was his movie, “Where the Buffalo Roam” that made me want to become a journalist.\n\nBill said, “Then, you’re seriously (expletive) up.”\n\nAfter a quick photo with Murray, I left. Shortly after that incident, Bill Murray was in the news for allegedly slamming professional photographer Peter Simon (Carly Simon’s brother) against the door of a fancy restaurant in Oak Bluffs. Allegedly, Murray also dumped a glass of water on Simon and his camera, all because he was being photographed, which Simon denies.\n\nSo, in hindsight, I got off easy that night.\n\nMeeting Dan Aykroyd was a different story altogether.\n\nAykroyd was at the Yankee Spirits in Norwood signing bottles of his Crystal Head Vodka.\n\nNot only is Aykroyd the most talented and creative of cast members of the early days of SNL, he is very personable and engaging.\n\nEven if you didn't know he was responsible for some of the funniest sketch comedies of the last 50 years, you would instantly like the guy.\n\nAnd, his vodka goes down as smooth as the phrase, “Fred Garvin: Male Prostitute.”\n\n“Dan, it's an honor and privilege to meet you,” I said. “It's because of you that I pursued a career as a male prostitute.”\n\nAykroyd laughed and said, “Being a male prostitute is a good profession.”\n\n“Well, I didn't say I was any good at it,” I snapped.\n\nAfter our silly banter, Aykroyd asked me what I did for a living and we had a warm conversation about journalism and how newspapers are more important than ever today. Not only did Aykroyd make me feel good about myself, he made me feel good about my lifelong profession. And, not once did he threaten to kick me in the nuts."
