        "text": "VOICE OVER: Rebecca Brayton\n\nWho you gonna call for a second time? Welcome to WatchMojo, and today we'll be highlighting all the reasons why 1989's “Ghostbusters II” is a strong sequel in the franchise and doesn't deserve its bad reputation. We'll have a look at comedy highlights, a memorable villain, standout secondary characters and more!\n\nWelcome to WatchMojo, and today we’ll be highlighting all the reasons why 1989’s “Ghostbusters II” is a strong sequel in the franchise and doesn’t deserve its bad reputation. Are you a fan of “Ghostbuster II”? What’s your favorite part of the movie? Don’t be afraid to cross the streams in the comments below!\n\nThe Stakes Are Raised\n\nIt’s fair to say that “Ghostbusters II” raises the stakes fairly significantly from its predecessor. The danger feels more urgent this time around, creating an increased sense of looming tension that drives the story forward. Each character is given their own unique challenges to conquer also. With the team being sued by the government for the destruction caused in the first film, it splits them up. Placed back at square one, they are forced to question everything. But, when paranormal events resurface in New York, our heroes must find a way back together in order to save their beloved city from some pretty major supernatural threats. And when they inevitably do, it’s clear each has grown as individuals – making them stronger as a team. So, with increased public skepticism, personal strife’s, and plenty of internal turmoil, the Ghostbusters had plenty of challenges to overcome before they could even tackle the film’s big bad! Which brings us to…\n\nA Formidable Villain\n\nCentral to any good sequel – scratch that – central to any good movie is the presence of a worthy antagonist. And, “Ghostbusters II” most certainly does not have a villain problem. In fact, Vigo the Carpathian stands as one of the most iconic big screen baddies of all time. A powerful 16th-century sorcerer trapped in a museum painting, Vigo serves as a truly intimidating threat. Using malevolent manipulations, Vigo attempts to possess a child in order to be reborn so he can rule the world. It’s quite the sinister plan, one made all the more effective thanks to those who brought the “Sorrow of Moldavia” to life. We say “those” because it was a team effort. You see, while Wilhelm von Homburg played Vigo, his voice was dubbed in by the legendary Max von Sydow. The result is pure epic evilness that undoubtedly gave 80s kids plenty of sleepless nights.\n\nSupporting Characters Shine\n\nMany say that 1984’s “Ghostbusters” is a perfectly cast film. And it’s hard to argue with that, as everyone plays their part to perfection. If only we got to see more of them. Well, “Ghostbusters II” gives everyone, including the supporting cast, ample time to shine. Characters like Louis Tully and Janine Melnitz are given greater prominence, while Sigourney Weaver’s Dana is once again central to the story. Speaking of Dana, her boss at the museum, Dr. Janosz Poha, is an absolute scene-stealer. Played by the terrific Peter MacNicol, the eccentric character adds a wonderful layer of zany fun to the proceedings. Of course, there is one character in particular who rightfully got a bigger share of the spotlight this time around…\n\nWinston Gets His Due\n\nIntroduced in the middle of the original film, Winston Zeddemore was unfortunately given limited screen time. “Ghostbusters II” corrects this, however. Now a full-fledged member of the team, Winston isn’t the new guy “learning the ropes” anymore. In fact, he’s a principal part of the group who plays an important role from the get-go. And aside from his passable singing chops, we get to witness Winston’s impressive work ethic and stellar comedic timing. “It’s always the quiet ones.” Fans can thank “Ghostbusters II” for bringing Winston to the forefront. And we can thank Ernie Hudson for his charm-filled performance.\n\nThe Comedy Lands\n\nBalancing out the on-screen frights is plenty of the signature wit and humor that made the original film so beloved. We’re not here to tell you which film is funnier, but rather that “Ghostbusters II” has no dearth of laugh out loud moments. Of course, when you have a cast of comedy heavyweights the likes of Dan Aykroyd, Harold Ramis, and Bill Murray, the comedy will flow effortlessly. And while our core heroes retain their excellent comedic chemistry, the supporting cast also gets plenty of instances to tickle our funny bones. From Louis and Janine’s make out session while babysitting to Venkman’s hilariously odd \"World of Psychics\" TV show taping, there are countless comedic moments throughout the film. Heck, even Slimer gets in on the laughs this time around!\n\nUnique Story Elements\n\nWe’re not going to lie, “Ghostbusters II” has its fair share of silly and contrived moments. It’s also heavily criticized for how similar it is to the original. Luckily, amidst all the familiar plot beats can be found some truly intriguing concepts that expand upon the world established in the first film. For starters, the idea of negative psychic energy fueling paranormal activity on the streets of New York City makes for a smart twist on traditional ghostly encounters. The underground “river of slime” was a sly metaphor for all the negative hostility bubbling beneath the surface of major cities like New York – especially in the 1980s. The film also explores welcome themes around redemption and the power of positivity. Plus, with a festive holiday setting and the climax coinciding with New Year’s Eve, it doubles as a great holiday movie. Yep, we’d argue there’s more than enough originality on display in “Ghostbusters II” to set it apart.\n\nMore Action\n\nYou know what they say: if you’re going to make a sequel, you’ve got to go bigger! And “Ghostbusters II” did just that, not only offering up plenty of action throughout, but delivering it on a larger scale than its predecessor. The results are all quite memorable. The courtroom scene alone is one of the most fun (not to mention suspensefully startling) sequences in any film. And seeing our heroes use the Statue of Liberty to crash through the slime-covered museum bubble to save Dana and her baby was as big of a silver screen spectacle as they get. And hey, it wouldn’t be an 80s flick if there wasn’t a sweet action montage!\n\nThe first “Ghostbusters” will always be a supernatural comedy classic that, in all likelihood, will never be topped. But, it’s also fair to say that “Ghostbusters 2” stands as a worthy sequel. Successfully maintaining the charm of its predecessor, the movie managed to introduce exciting new elements – not to mention an all time iconic villain. And with memorable action sequences, plenty of humor, and clever themes, “Ghostbusters II” has earned its place as an admirable part of the celebrated franchise."
