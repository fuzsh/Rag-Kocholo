        "text": "Earlier this year, a third, extremely long-awaited Ghostbusters movie was finally confirmed, set in the same universe as the original two movies, Ghostbusters (1984) and Ghostbusters II (1989).\n\nNow, much to the delight of Ghostbusters fans everywhere, original co-star Dan Aykroyd has confirmed that Bill Murray will return as Dr. Peter Venkman in Ghostbusters 2020.\n\nIt’s official: Bill Murray has been confirmed for the new Ghostbusters 2020 film in what is set to be a very important cinema event of 2020.\n\nThe film is being directed by Jason Reitman (Juno, Thank You for Smoking), who is the son of the original Ghostbusters director, Ivan Reitman. Jason Reitman also wrote the screenplay, along with Gil Kenin (Poltergeist, Monster House), whilst Ivan Reitman himself will be filling the role of producer.\n\nSpeaking in a recent interview on The Gregg Hill Show, Aykroyd described that Jason Reitman had written “a beautiful, heartfelt script that takes the real DNA from the first two movies and transfers that directly to the third, the next generation. It hands the legacy off to a new generation of stars, and players, and actors, and characters.”\n\nAykroyd also revealed that the new film will pay tribute to late Harold Ramis, who played Egon Spengler in the original two movies.\n\n“I miss him a lot. He was, of course, a really intelligent, great writer and collaborator,” Aykroyd described. “Of course, we’ll recognise him in this film in some way, however small.”\n\nAs well as Murray and Aykroyd, original cast members Ernie Hudson, Sigourney Weaver, and Annie Potts will all be returning to their roles. New cast members include Paul Rudd, Carrie Coon, Finn Wolfhard, and McKenna Grace.\n\nGhostbusters 2020 is set to come out July 10, 2020.\n\nCheck out a teaser trailer below:"
