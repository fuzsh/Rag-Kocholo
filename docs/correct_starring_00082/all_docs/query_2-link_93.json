        "text": "For many years, Bill Murray said his time into paranormal investigation and elimination service business was over after Ghostbusters II. Recently, however, he reconsidered his decision and eventually he popped up for a cameo in Paul Feig’s 2016 remake. In a new interview with IndieWire, Murray has confessed that he is ready to step into Peter Venkman’s shoes once again, if asked.\n\n“This franchise paid for my son’s college,” he said. “We made this thing. We are the caretakers of it. It’s a great thing and it was a really fun movie to make. It’s a real movie with some really funny stuff in it.” He added that his problem with previous sequel talks had mainly been with Sony. “For years, they said, ‘We can’t make another Ghostbusters because Bill Murray won’t change the deal he made in 1984.’ Well, no, I never did.”\n\nRELATED – Captain Marvel’s Mckenna Grace in Talks for Ghostbusters 3\n\nThen the actor explained that his friendship with co-stars Kate McKinnon and Melissa McCarthy is the reason why he made an appearance in the Paul Feig-directed Ghostbusters in 2016.\n\n“I was in that movie just because they asked me, and I knew if I said no, I was saying I didn’t support that movie,” he added. “I felt like, OK, I’m going to support them because I support them as people. So I did that one and I would do this next one.”\n\nJason Reitman will direct the upcoming Ghostbusters threequel, which directly continues the original story but focuses on a younger cast. Reitman takes up the mantle from his father Ivan Reitman who directed the original Ghostbusters (1984) and Ghostbusters 2 (1989)."
