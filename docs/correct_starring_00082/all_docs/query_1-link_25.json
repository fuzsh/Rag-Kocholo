        "text": "Actor Bill Murray will appear in Sony’s new “Ghostbusters” film, TheWrap has learned.\n\nMurray starred in 1984’s original “Ghostbusters” and 1989’s “Ghostbusters II” alongside Dan Aykroyd, Harold Ramis, Ernie Hudson and Sigourney Weaver.\n\nAppearing on CBS’ “Late Show” in 2011, Murray called the idea of appearing in a new “Ghostbusters” film “crazy talk.”\n\nThe nature of Murray’s role in the new movie is not yet known.\n\nSony announced in 2014 that it would reboot the long-dormant film franchise with director Paul Feig and a female cast.\n\nThe studio subsequently revealed that Kristen Wiig, Melissa McCarthy, Kate McKinnon and Leslie Jones would play the four leads. The film is currently in production."
