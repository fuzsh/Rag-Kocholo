The “Ghostbusters” sequel, “Ghostbusters: Afterlife” is set to premiere on July 10, 2020, and Bill Murray will officially reprise his role of parapsychologist Peter Venkman from 1984’s “Ghostbusters.”

The “Ghostbusters” franchise also includes “Ghostbusters II,” the 1989 sequel to the original film, and an all-female version of “Ghostbusters” that was released in 2016. Murray appeared in all three films.

“The script is good,” Murray told Vanity Fair of “Ghostbusters: Afterlife.” “It’s got lots of family in it, with through lines that are really interesting. It’s gonna work.”

The new movie will also feature original stars Dan Aykroyd as Ray Stantz and Ernie Hudson as Winston Zeddemore. Harold Ramis, who co-wrote the original script with Aykroyd and starred as the fourth Ghostbuster, Egon Spengler, passed away in 2014.

“Ghostbusters: Afterlife” follows single mom Callie (Carrie Coon) and her children Trevor (Finn Wolfhard) and Phoebe (Mckenna Grace), who begin to suspect paranormal activity after moving into an old farmhouse in Oklahoma. It picks up 36 years after the events of the original “Ghostbusters.”

The film is directed by Jason Reitman, the son of Ivan Reitman, who directed the original film and its sequel.

“I think about who I’m making this movie for, it’s my father,” he told Vanity Fair. “We all know what it’s like to be told stories by our parents. I’m really honored to get a chance to tell one back to him from the world he brought to life.”
