        "text": "There are a few things I have learned from my French friends over the year about the culture. One of those that stood out to me years ago is that what you wear under your clothes is just as important as what you wear on the outside. Single or taken, lingerie is an important element of the French wardrobe.\n\nAfter a little hesitation, I tried it and I have to say it was an instant mood booster! No one needs to know that you are wearing a matching lace set underneath your sweatpants or flowy Summer dress but it makes a huge difference in the way you feel. I think we could all use a little uplift right now.\n\nI have tried out a few brands over the years that I have come to love and currently wear. (Mom, clothes your eyes or maybe you want to take notes)\n\nWacoal\n\nWacoal reached out to me about a year ago about sending me a few items. I hadn’t tried their bras before so I stopped over to Galleries Lafayette to get fitted. I wanted to make sure I was getting the right size. They do offer them at Nordstrom and they can size you in the lingerie department. If you are buying online, try to buy your regular size and then maybe one size up or down if you want to make sure you are getting the right fit. I have had issues with bras in the past and now it is a big focus of mine to always get refitted and checked. I wear a 30DD normally but my chest is the first thing to shrink or grow when my weight changes.\n\nP.S. I have heard the Wacoal strapless bra is the best one out there. This is my next purchase!\n\nNatori\n\nThe Natori Feathers Bras are the bras I own and have bought for years. I have them in neutral colors of nude and black but I also have some fun patterns and colors.\n\nCosabella\n\nCosabella is the brand I wear the most. I love their thongs/boyshorts. They are way more comfortable than Hanky Panky in my opinion and last for years. (hang dry do not put in the dryer)\n\nChantelle\n\nChantelle is designed in Paris and available in the US and around the world. They have a variety of sizes for all body types.\n\nEberjey\n\nPrincesse Tam Tam\n\nPrincesse Tam Tam is a brand you will see around a bunch on the streets of Paris. They make adorable lingerie and also super cute swimsuits!\n\nIf you are looking for an affordable brand, Adore Me sent me some matching sets around my birthday and I loved them! I have been wearing them all of the quarantine. I didn’t realize how much I actually needed to feel good until I put them on. Plus, my bra size isn’t the easiest to find and they had my size and it fit great!\n\nTake a little time for yourself this weekend and before you queue up another Netflix marathon, draw a bath or hot shower and put on a matching set of lingerie.\n\n*This post includes affiliate links.
