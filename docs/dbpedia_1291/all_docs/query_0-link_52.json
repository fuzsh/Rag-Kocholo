        "text": "Buoyed by the success of the French musical Zou Zou, the same team created this comedy in which a mischievous shepherd girl rises through society to become a pretend princess and the toast of Paris nightlife. While in Tunisia seeking inspiration for a new novel, a French aristocrat (Albert Préjean) becomes infatuated with the innocent Alwina (Josephine Baker) and constructs a plot to bring her back to Paris and pass her off as an Indian princess.\n\nIn a thinly veiled parallel to Baker’s own experience, Alwina becomes a celebrity. Her rise to notoriety climaxing in a posh nightclub, where she dances as only La Baker could.\n\n‘In and of themselves, Baker’s films are a source of knowledge about her – but also about the worlds of symbols and stories; about formation of Blackness in the United States, Europe and Africa; about dance, and about what it means to be in cinema in the 1930s as a Black woman actor and global entertainer.’\n\nTerri Simone Francis (Josephine Baker’s Cinematic Prism)\n\nWith an introduction by Terri Simone Francis.\n\nDirector: Edmond T Gréville\n\nCast: Josephine Baker, Albert Préjean, Germaine Aussey, Robert Arnoux Coton\n\n1935 / 15 / France / 107 mins / Primary language: French / Subtitled\n\nThis event is part of Cinema Rediscovered and Future City Film Festival.
