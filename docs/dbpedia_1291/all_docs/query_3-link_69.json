Ltd., the company said.\n\nHe is replacing Nobuo Domae, senior group officer of Fast Retailing and co-ceo of Fast Retailing France, who took up the post temporarily after Nancy Pedot decided to leave the group in September 2014 to pursue other career opportunities.\n\nWith a background in marketing, publishing and fashion, Chenut most recently co-launched the French daily L’Opinion. He also served as ceo of Lacoste until 2013, was ceo of French sports publication L’Equipe and of French communications group DDB."
