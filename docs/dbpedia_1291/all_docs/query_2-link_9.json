        "text": "It’s no secret that the French produce some of the world’s best lingerie—after all, it is the city of love. Their romantic approach to all aspects of life manifests itself in silk bras, lace bustiers, and provocative garter belts that mirror intricate works of art. Premium materials coupled with a rich history of expert craftsmanship, make France the go-to destination for intimates that’ll have you feeling like a sultry siren.\n\nWhile our undergarments go unseen throughout most of the day (hopefully only until sundown if you’re lucky), they are quite literally the foundation of our outfits. Regardless of your relationship status, investing in new lingerie is a surefire way to amp up your sex appeal and increase your confidence. It’s impossible not to feel like your best self when you’re wearing a matching pair of fabulous undies. If it’s time to give your underwear an upgrade, look no further.\n\nWe’ve compiled six of the best French lingerie brands that’ll make your inner siren sing songs of joy.\n\nChantelle\n\nChantelle is one of the most recognizable French lingerie brands as it has nearly 145 years of expertise, perfecting its craft since 1876. Founded at the turn of the century, Chantelle began breaking the mold from the very beginning as the brand created the first elasticized fabrics, allowing corsets to stretch. The storied label is beloved for its unparalleled quality as exceptional materials and meticulous manufacturing generate long-lasting pieces.\n\nThe brand’s dedication to its customers has not wavered as it champions inclusivity and progress. Chantelle welcomes a wide range of styles to cater to every woman, ranging in cup sizes A to I. Delivering plunging T-shirt and full coverage bras, alongside flattering minimizers and racer-back bralettes, Chantelle leads with a timeless, yet trendy aesthetic that has earned it a deserving spot in our weekly rotation.\n\nRelated: The 13 Most Comfortable Bras of 2023, Tested and Reviewed\n\nEres\n\nEres is a trailblazer as the Parisian brand revolutionized swimwear when founder Irene Leroux focused on the female form, dispensing with uncomfortable boning and padding when she launched her brand in 1968. Naturally, the “Chanel of swimwear” is a master at crafting quality lingerie. Eres brings its high-caliber designs to intimates, offering undergarments that feel like a second skin. The brand doesn’t compromise on support or style, utilizing the finest textiles to mold to the wearer’s body.\n\nLuxurious silk, delicate lace, breathable cotton and uber-soft jersey arrive in the form of utterly feminine undergarments. The Roller set exudes classic French girl style with its petal pink detailing and black cups, quietly calling to mind an off-duty French maid. Jacquard lace sheer full-cup bras and matching briefs immediately evoke a vintage aesthetic. Meanwhile, vibrant floral camisoles and flowing nightshirts will make you feel like a garden fairy. Black dainty sets welcome ornate lace trimming, whereas light and airy blush-tinted bras mirror nature with its bouquet-inspired fabric.\n\nEtam\n\nPrayers were answered last year as Etam finally made its ways overseas to lingerie drawers stateside. The much-loved intimates brand wasn’t available in the United States until 2022, making its incredibly comfortable and supremely sensual silhouettes even more exclusive. Initially founded as a stocking company in 1916 by Max Lindermann, Etam sets itself apart with its signature run-resistant lace—no doubt a leftover from its days of making tights. With more than a century of experience creating intimates for the modern woman, it’s no wonder the brand has such a devoted following. Sexy scalloped balconette bras and tulle bodysuits are mainstays of the brand, joining 100% silk sleepwear and flirty heart-covered pajamas. Not only does Etam excel at creating lingerie with a superior fit, it comes at a price that can’t be beaten with items ranging from $14.95 to $100 USD.\n\nEstablished in the midst of the French Revolution, the period’s social climate ushered in an era of liberation that trickled down to fashion. Corsets quickly became a thing of the past and soon enough, Etam began incorporating comfortable styles and materials like cotton. Since then, Etam has remained a pioneer in its industry, releasing aerobic bodysuits in the 1980s, cleavage-enhancing technology in the ‘90s and organic cotton lingerie in the early 2000s. The forward-thinking French brand launched a post-mastectomy bra line in 2020, showcasing its commitment to supporting women at all stages of their lives.\n\nLIVY\n\nFounded by Lisa Chavy, LIVY is a lingerie brand designed by women, for women. “I created LIVY because I wanted to accompany women’s freedom.” With autonomy and self-expression at the heart of Chavy’s brand, LIVY empowers women to step into their full and authentic selves. With the support of a well-crafted bra and sumptuously soft underwear, the LIVY woman has the confidence to embody her complexities rather than shy away from them.\n\nChavy’s commitment to representing women’s divine power is present in every single one of her designs as the abundance of black lace and geometric splashes of tulle and mesh nod to a sexually liberated ethos. LIVY dares us to proudly wear our lingerie out in the open as its sculptural aesthetic transforms intimates into ready-to-wear couture. The brand’s dominatrix-adjacent silhouettes are absolutely something Julia Fox would wear to brunch. Ornately embroidered bustiers accompany graphic balcony bras and sheer tulle briefs, all appear with gold jewelry accents for a subtle touch of opulence.\n\nSimone Pérèle\n\nAt the forefront of the French lingerie industry, Simone Pérèle sought to throw out antiquated traditions that constricted a woman’s shape as she used her training as a corset maker to create intimates that celebrated the female body. Dedicated to quality, each collection takes over a year to come to fruition as items are tested on French women of all shapes and sizes to ensure the best fit. Every piece is made in France and is crafted with fabric from European embroidery and lace houses, including Chantilly lace. Sophisticated full cup bras and strappy underwire triangle bras join slightly sheer scoop demi iterations, painted in saturated shades of berry, golden yellow and verdant green. The assortment of vibrant colors and refined silhouettes make Simone Pérèle an immediate go-to for anyone looking to embody an elegant French woman.\n\nCompany slogans like, “The woman is independent, she buys lingerie in order to please herself before being sensual for others,” perfectly capture Simone Pérèle’s trailblazing spirit. Pérèle opened her atelier in Paris in 1948, working with her husband to manufacture satin bras. In the 1960s, the brand truly started to innovate when Pérèle created the first lycra bra, the Sole Mio. Today, Simone Pérèle is now run by her grandchildren, continuing her legacy of excellence.\n\nPrincesse tam.tam\n\nSadly, most lingerie brands are owned and operated by men, causing a disparity in how undergarments fit and feel. Princesse tam.tam, however, places women at its center as it was founded by sisters Loumia and Shama Hiridjee in 1985. The intimates label pays homage to Josephine Baker as the name takes inspiration from the tam tam instrument, which provided the musical accompaniment for her iconic dances. Encapsulating the French woman’s inimitable freedom of movement and expression, Princesse tam.tam. lives up to its mission of “bringing joy to every woman’s life.”\n\nThe brand provides a curated collection of lingerie, providing sleek and simple soft cup bras, wireless bralettes with straight necklines, as well as uplifting underwire balconette iterations for daily wear, Sheer embroidered tulle options, lace-trimmed onesies and backless cashmere bodysuits lend themselves to more special nights. Princesse tam. tam also carries soft and cozy loungewear and pajamas, alongside activewear, dressing us for every occasion.\n\nRelated: The 19 Best Lingerie Brands to Upgrade Your Top Drawer Stash\n\nFor more InStyle news, make sure to sign up for our newsletter!"
