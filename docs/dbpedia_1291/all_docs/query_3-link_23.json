        "text": "I paid for the return 20€. I could buy lingerie in another shop for this money\n\nI wish I had read TrustPilot before making a purchase in this shop. I liked this brand a lot when I lived in another country where I could buy this brand in retail. I decided to order it online because they are not present in Germany. The order arrived quite quickly but when it came to the return, I encountered some issues. First, I could not login on my account on their website to request a return because they had a mistake in my email. After two unanswered by customer service emails I decided to call and there, they told me that there is no return label for orders from countries outside France! I have to pay myself for the delivery and I am fully responsible if it is not delivered. So I have just paid for the delivery 20€. Now I am curious how fast they will return my money.\n\nVery unpleasant experience.\n\nShame on this shop.\n\nDate of experience : May 22, 2024\n\nI'd give 0 stars if an option\n\nI'd give 0 stars if an option. I ordered and paid for 4 items but only received 2. Customer service's response was that, according to their records, 4 items had been scanned and thus I received 4.\n\nDespite sending them a sworn statement and copy of my passport as suggested by them, I received no further response from them. Abominable service. I'll be turning to other lingerie brands for sure.\n\nDate of experience : October 20, 2023\n\nWorst client service experience ever...\n\nWorst client service experience I ever had. They do not response to emails. It‘s almost impossible to reach someone on their hotline. My order has not been delivered for three weeks now - there is no update available where the parcel is. Princesse tam.tam does also not feel responsible to clarify this - no feedback after several emails. I tried calling several times - no one answered the phone. Finally I spoke to someone yesterday who promised to get back - what of course did not happen. Untrustworthy how they deal with their customers.\n\nDate of experience : January 22, 2019\n\nFriendly but incredibly incompetent customer service\n\n2 month ago my order got lost in the mail. Countless phone calls, explanations and discussions with the customer service followed, each of them ending with empty promises about how they would try to find the parcel, refund me the money, contact me back, which (needless to say) simply never happened. The money is still not back on my bank account and I'm getting exhausted of calling and explaining everything again, but as they don't reply to E-mails I think I have no choice..\n\nDate of experience : January 25, 2021\n\nAwfull\n\nAwfull. I've placed an order on 16 nov, now it's 20 dec. After a month after placing my order they told me they are preparing it to be delivered & than in 2 days I got an e-mail saying my order was delivered, but I've never received the order. I've contacted them 4 times since then & no response at all.\n\nTrully disappointed\n\nDate of experience : December 20, 2020\n\nThe worse customer service I have ever encountered\n\nI received a faulty pair of pyjama trousers. I sent photos and proof of purchase from their website, it took weeks for them to respond. I answered their queries, it took several more weeks to respond. At no point did they offer to replace the trousers. 2 months later and the correspondence has simply stopped. The worst customer service I have ever encountered. Never again. Shame, they are lovely products.\n\nDate of experience : March 26, 2019\n\nBad quality, bad customer service\n\nThey sent out the package without the street address but thank God I could re-route it to a Packet shop. The night gown were of extremely bad quality so I decided to send them back but WATCH OUT, you have to send them back to France and the costs are assumed by the customer so 8€ to send the package back!!!! How can a company still do this in 2021!???\n\nThat's HORRIBLE customer service! I will NEVER order again.\n\nDate of experience : May 20, 2021\n\nReliable and fast delivery\n\nI'm very satisfied with my order. It took five days for it to arrive.\n\nOrder was complete and I even got a little present on top.\n\nOne thing the company could work on is the presentation of the colours of their products. I ordered a bra in lavender colour which looked pale on the pictures but turned out more intense in reality.\n\nDate of experience : January 21, 2021\n\nI haven't received my order.\n\nThe order I placed with Princesse Tamtam was supposed to have delivered a week today. It wasn't delivered and in the evening the tracking page changed to 'in transit' and to check back later. It has continued to say that since last Tuesday. It has clearly been lost by UPS. I called Princesse Tam Tam's helpline and was told they would email me to let me know what was going on. I heard nothing back from them. I called again this morning asking for a cancellation and a refund. A pointless thing to do as once again was told that they would email me to see what was going on and would only refund me after they received the lost parcel. In other words a lost parcel I have not received needs to go back to them for them to give me my money back. I really do not recommend buying anything online by this company.\n\nDate of experience : November 17, 2020\n\nZero communication and wrong order\n\nPrincesse tam tam:\n\n1. Check customers email to you. Why not?\n\n2. Do your staff know how to communicate beyond french language?\n\n3. Why not send money back to customer when you are not able to send right or all of the products?\n\n4. Correct wrong order sent to customer. Why not? I am 100 % disappointed here. Do you want dissapointed customers getting wrong product and paying for products that never came?\n\n5. Do you want international customers? How in that case?\n\nIf you are not able to answer customer who tells about wrong order after one week: it's really bad for a big company like princesse tam tam. I Will not recommend you.\n\nFast in Sending but it seems you do not check if order is correct! Bad! Really bad! Du you trust Robot so much?\n\nI ordered from Sweden Stockholm neighbour and I can Imagine you have tech systems making order for me but Please check it!!\n\nDate of experience : July 19, 2019"
