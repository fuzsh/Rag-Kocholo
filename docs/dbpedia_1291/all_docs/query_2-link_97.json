        "text": "SPOILER WARNING: This article has important plot information. Caution is advised!\n\nLucien Vanserra (pronounced: Loo-shien[2]) is a High Fae and former emissary to the Spring Court. He is the current emissary to the Night Court.\n\nHistory[]\n\nEarly Life[]\n\nLucien is the son of the Lady of the Autumn Court and Helion, the High Lord of the Day Court, as a result of their secret love affair. When she was pregnant with Lucien, Lucien's mother was already married to Beron Vanserra, the High Lord of the Autumn Court. Fearing for her life and the life of her unborn child, as Beron's temper and penchant for violence were well-known to all, the Lady of the Autumn Court attempted to pass her bastard son off as the true son of Beron. Her husband, however, always suspected the truth. Lucien believes himself to be the youngest blooded son of Beron as he was raised as one of the seven sons of the High Lord, and was never told the truth.\n\nLucien grew up in the Autumn Court, but never cared much about his nobility. He made friends with individuals of different Courts and with individuals from non-aristocratic backgrounds. As Lucien was unlikely to become High Lord, he was allowed to roam the Court as he saw fit.\n\nDuring his youth, he met a Lesser Faerie named Jesminda, who lived in the countryside of the Autumn Court. She teased and seduced Lucien until they fell in love.[3] Beron disapproved of this relationship, believing it was inappropriate for a High Fae noble to marry a Lesser Faerie, and so he had Jesminda executed in front of Lucien. Two of his elder brothers restrained him and forced him to watch. Neither of the brothers was Eris Vanserra, Lucien's eldest and most sadistic brother.[4]\n\nAfter this event, Lucien left the Autumn Court and fled to the Spring Court, to Tamlin, the son of the High Lord of the Spring Court, whom he became friends with. Eris, his older brother, claimed later to have warned Tamlin about Lucien to ensure his half-brother's safety. His brothers believed that he was a strong contender to the High Lord's crown, and so the three of them went to kill him, to prevent him from one day becoming High Lord. Lucien killed one of the brothers, while Tamlin killed the other. The third escaped back to the Autumn Court to report what had happened.\n\nNow without a place at the Autumn Court, Tamlin gave Lucien a place at his Court and then appointed him as the Spring Court Emissary to give him some political protection through a title. After the appointment, the Autumn Court members dared not openly attack Lucien for fear of starting a war with the Spring Court.\n\nAs the emissary for the Spring Court, Lucien met with individuals from other Courts, including eventually his father, Beron, who he was forced to meet for political matters between the two Courts. Another such required meeting was with Amarantha, Hybern's former General and a High Fae of incredible power. Amarantha desired Tamlin and wanted a relationship with him, but Tamlin was not interested. To convey his disinterest in a political manner, but to discuss how they might keep the peace despite it, Tamlin sent Lucien to her to parlay. Amarantha did not take Tamlin's rejection well and she allowed her anger to get the better of her, claiming there would be no peace so long as Tamlin refused her. In a rare moment of losing his temper, Lucien told Amarantha to, \"go back to the shit-hole she'd crawled out of.\"[5] As punishment for his words, Amaranatha attacked Lucien and carved out his left eye. She sent him back to the Spring Court so severely wounded that Tamlin had vomited when he saw his friend, to serve as both an insult and as a challenge to the Spring Court for war.\n\nLucien's face was left scarred from the incident. Nuan, an alchemist from the Dawn Court and Lucien's friend, aided him in his healing. She crafted a metal eye and gave it to Lucien to use as a replacement for his left eye. [6]\n\nNot long after those failed \"negotiations\" Amarantha hosted a masquerade ball Under the Mountain and claimed it was to make amends for removing Lucien's eye. The entire Spring Court attended, including Lucien, who wore a fox mask. Amarantha claimed the ball would be a masquerade, so Lucien could hide the scarring. Her true motive for the party was to seduce Tamlin into becoming her lover and consort. However, Tamlin was outraged at the injuries that Amarantha had inflicted upon Lucien so he refused her again. To add insult to injury, he told her he would rather take a human to bed than her. Amarantha may have forgiven Tamlin for that insult, but he added one last unforgivable one. He said that her own sister, Clythia, had preferred a human's company over hers, referring to Jurian. Facing his scorn before a room full of Fae humiliated Amarantha, and so she cursed the entire Spring Court to forever wear their masks. The only chance to break this curse was for Tamlin to find a mortal girl who despised faeries but still fell in love with him, and he was given a time limit of \"seven times seven years\" to break the curse. If he did not manage to complete this task in time, Amarantha would claim him and all of his subjects as slaves and imprison them in Under the Mountain forever.\n\nTo aid his best friend and end the curse on all of them, Lucien vowed to help Tamlin try to find this mortal female.\n\nA Court of Thorns and Roses[]\n\nDuring the forty-ninth and final year of the curse, Andras is sent in wolf form to a village near the Wall, a human female named Feyre Archeron kills him because of her hatred of faeries. When Tamlin finds out he goes to find her and deceives her by saying that she has broken the Treaty, which states that if a human kills a faerie they must either die or go live in the faerie realms. Feyre agrees to go with him and when they reach the Spring Court Lucien is extremely condescending to her, mocking her human qualities.\n\nHe accompanies Tamlin during meals and at dinner Feyre also joins them. One day he takes Feyre hunting with him and from that moment he begins to be more comfortable in her presence and their relationship improves. It is Lucien who tells Feyre how she can ensnare the Suriel to tell her what she wants to know and tells her that he will be near the Western Woods in case she needs help, but when she screams at being attacked by naga, he is hesitant about going to help her, in the end the one who does it is Tamlin. He then apologizes to Feyre and to make up for it he gives her one of his knives.\n\nThen when he finds Feyre in the cave where the Great Rite is to take place during Calanmai, he tells her that she is an idiot for being there since surely Tamlin will smell her and want to sleep with her. He then takes her back to the manor and tells her not to leave her room all night.\n\nWhen Rhysand appears at the Spring Court, Lucien and Tamlin hide Feyre from his sight. When Rhysand taunts Lucien, he tells him that he is \"Amarantha's whore\". Then Rhysand discovers Feyre's presence and asks her name, to which she replies that her name is Clare Beddor, something that is not true. After this, Tamlin decides that it is not safe for Feyre to remain in the Court and decides to send her home, making Lucien angry with both of them since the curse could have been broken.\n\nAt the end of the forty-nine year period, they are kidnapped by Amarantha's subjects and taken to Under the Mountain, where Lucien has to reconnect with his family and see how Feyre goes through the three trials that Amarantha puts her through to prove her love for Tamlin.\n\nAfter Amarantha's subjects brutally beat Feyre Lucien goes to her cell and heals her broken nose. As punishment, Amarantha forces Tamlin to give Lucien twenty lashes. Nobody is permitted to heal him.\n\nLucien was then a victim of the second trial, in which Feyre has to read a question and press the lever that indicates the correct answer, otherwise twisting blades would reach her and Lucien. As she can not read he tells her to choose any lever but when she is going to choose the second, the tattoo that Rhysand gave her made her hand hurt, the same thing happens when she goes to choose the first lever, leaving the third lever as the correct answer.\n\nWhen Feyre finally discovers the answer to Amarantha's riddle, the curse is broken and Lucien is able to remove his fox mask.\n\nA Court of Mist and Fury[]\n\nAfter the events of Under the Mountain, Lucien returns to the Spring Court with Feyre and Tamlin. Lucien remains steadfast and loyal to his friend, Tamlin even as he worries about Feyre's health and safety. He goes out with her to visit nearby villages at her request. Tamlin's irrational need to suddenly control Feyre's every move is seen by Lucien, and he does what he can to alleviate some of that control, often at the expense of his own well-being. From providing her with weapons to hide on her person when Tamlin wouldn't, to begging Tamlin to allow Feyre to properly train and use her newfound powers, Lucien was seemingly the only member of the Spring Court to fight for her autonomy. When Tamlin locked her in his manor, Lucien urged her to be patient, promising to see what he could do in order to set her free, despite the threats on his life.\n\nAfter Feyre disappears after Tamlin locks her in his house, Tamlin sends Lucien along with Hart, Bron and another sentry out into Prythian to find and bring his intended bride back to him. Lucien spends weeks searching for her and eventually corners her in the wilds of the Night Court, while she is out training up her new skills with Azriel. Lucien believes Rhysand and the Night Court have bewitched Feyre somehow and that she is not in her right mind when she makes it clear to them that she is not going back to Tamlin. When they try to take her by force, she utilizes her new powers and asks Lucien to leave. He returns to Tamlin with Feyre's message and news of her new abilities.\n\nWhen Feyre, Rhysand, Azriel, Morrigan, and Cassian infiltrate Hybern's castle, they are captured by Jurian. Lucien is present as Tamlin has allied himself with the King to sever the bond that binds Feyre to Rhysand. As Hybern torments them, he brings out a secret weapon against Feyre.\n\nIanthe, who has latched onto the Spring Court through Tamlin's naivety turns over Feyre's sisters, Nesta and Elain Archeron to him. Tamlin and Lucien show disapproval of this move demanding that Hybern stop. Elain is tossed into the black waters of the Cauldron anyway. When she emerges moments later, she has been Made into a High Fae. Lucien feels the mating bond snap into place between him and Elain and whispers that she is his mate.\n\nMorrigan winnows Elain and Nesta, and Rhys gathers Azriel and Cassian. The six escape Hybern's castle and return to the Night Court. Lucien is bereft of what just happened and demands Tamlin go after Elain. Feyre inserts herself as a tired victim of Rhysand's manipulations and asks Tamlin to simply take her home, knowing the High Lord of Spring will grant her wish. Lucien suspects she is lying but says nothing.\n\nA Court of Wings and Ruin[]\n\nLucien is forced to watch over Feyre at the Spring Court for Tamlin. He remains at his friend's side for this purpose, despite his resentment of the task. It is seen that Lucien doubts Feyre's intentions from the start. He is seen asking Feyre about Elain, wanting to know if she's worth fighting for.\n\nA few weeks after the events in Hybern's throne room, the King of Hybern sends a delegation made up of his twin nephews Princes Dagdan and Brannagh along with Jurian, they are welcomed by Tamlin, Lucien, Feyre and Ianthe into the manor. They have gone on the supposed mission of inspecting the fissures of the Wall.\n\nFrom the beginning, it is clear Lucien does not like their guests, but as he is assigned to watch Feyre by Tamlin, he has to go with her everywhere. When Feyre escorts the Prince and Princess to the Wall, so they can inspect it for weaknesses, Lucien accompanies them. During that first journey, Lucien aids the twins by supplying information regarding the holes in the Wall, albeit reluctantly.\n\nWhile they are away from the manor and Tamlin, Lucien confronts Feyre with his suspicions, and Feyre confides in him about what happened during her absence from the Spring Court. Feyre is quiet about the truth of her relationship with Rhys, however.[7] The friendship that was once there between Lucien and Feyre is tentatively rebuilt, although it is clear on both sides that there is still great mistrust.\n\nA few days later, the Summer Solstice arrives. Like all of the Spring Court, Lucien attended these celebrations, though he is half-asleep during one of Ianthe's performances. During one particular performance, Ianthe is interrupted by Feyre who uses the power she acquired from the High Lord of the Dawn Court to glow, creating a display of light that makes her appear \"holy\" and \"blessed\" by the Mother, instead of Ianthe. Lucien decides to help Feyre in crushing Ianthe's plan to look powerful by taking her hand and kneeling on the floor at her feet, adding to the dramatics of the spectacle.[8] The incident creates jealousy in Ianthe, who expected to be the center of attention that day, and in Tamlin, who starts getting jealous of Feyre and Lucien's friendship and dynamic.\n\nThat same night, after the celebrations have ended, Lucien's sleep is interrupted by Feyre's screaming and her knocking on his door. He opens the door to his chambers shirtless to find her wearing lacy clothing and in disarray from her night terrors. She tells him she has terrible dreams of her time Under the Mountain and hugs Lucien for comfort. Their somewhat sensual embrace is interrupted by Tamlin, who becomes angered at the scene of his friend and his lover in such a state.[9] Lucien knows then to keep a distance from Feyre or risk Tamlin's irrational violence.\n\nThe next day, Feyre and Lucien again escort Dagdan and Brannagh to the Wall, however this time they visit the Continent as well to further inspect the Wall. Brannagh is unable to winnow, and Dagdan can only winnow a few miles, and so the group winnow and hike to the Continent. During their trek, three members of the Children of the Blessed approach them. Lucien rejects their plead to dwell in Prythian, but Brannagh and Dagdan are enticed by their offer. The next day, Lucien finds the three Children of the Blessed dead and their bodies mutilated by Brannagh and Dagdan.[10] As retribution, Lucien and Feyre send the Bogge after the Hybern twins. For this trickery, both Lucien and Feyre are scolded by Tamlin. Feyre, however, turns the scolding around on Tamlin, causing his anger to unleash his magic. She purposely does not shield herself and is injured by furniture being thrown around the room by Tamlin's wild magic. Lucien immediately runs to Feyre's aid, and this only further needles Tamlin's jealousy.\n\nFeyre's schemes succeed, causing the people of the Spring Court to rethink their loyalty to their High Lord and forcing Lucien to admit that his best friend, Tamlin, has lost all good reason and has become a tyrant on the wrong side of a coming war.\n\nDuring the last visit out to the Wall, Lucien again accompanies Feyre, Dagdan, and Brannagh. However, this time, Ianthe and Tamlin also attend them. When Lucien is left alone with Ianthe at one point during the trip, she tricks him and ties him in shackles to force him to accept her unwanted sexual advances. He coldly rejects her and is saved by Feyre who uses her daemati abilities to force Ianthe to unshackle him and make her crush her hand with a rock repeatedly so that she would not touch someone without their consent ever again.[11] Brannagh and Dagdan appear and confront Lucien and Feyre, admitting that they've been using small amounts of faebane so that it was not noticeable to poison her and Lucien for weeks. Lucien and Feyre team up and kill the Hybern twins.\n\nMurdering the niece and nephew of the Spring Court's ally, Hybern, severs any chance for Feyre and Lucien to return to the Spring Court. They know their lives will be forfeit now, and flee from the Spring Court, running into the Autumn Court on their journey north towards the Night Court, knowing it is their only chance for safety.[12] Weakened by the faebane, though, the two weary companions are forced to travel on foot. They trek through the Autumn Court, and through the Forest House, a passage that takes days. Eventually, near the border between the Autumn Court and Winter Court, they are intercepted by Lucien's brothers who are sent by Beron, one of whom is Eris. They fight against the brothers and barely manage to escape. They settle in a cave for the night and pass the time talking.\n\nThe next day, they enter the Winter Court but are again intercepted by Lucien's brothers. Azriel and Cassian come to their aid. Frightening off Lucien's brothers, the two Illyrians fly Lucien and Feyre back to Velaris.\n\nThough wary of the Night Court, Lucien is amazed at the peace in Velaris and comments how surprised he is that there are children laughing in the street. Having only known the cruel and evil rumors about the Night Court, Lucien is stunned by Velaris.\n\nWhen they reach the home, Elain appears to have not recovered well from her kidnapping and forced re-making by the Cauldron. She drifts from place to place, seemingly uncaring about where she's at or even if she eats, and rarely speaks to anyone. Elain refuses to acknowledge Lucien, pining away for her mortal life and her fiancé, Graysen.\n\nFeyre goes into Lucien's head and mind to see his thoughts. His thoughts are flooded with concern for Elain's condition from her not eating and moving, yet notes how even then he thinks she is the most beautiful female he had ever seen. However, nothing could stop the betrayal that slid through his veins as he realized he'd once told his dead lover Jesminda the same thing. Lucien and Elain formally meet and something inside Lucien chants, \"Mine. You are mine, and I am yours. Mate.\" Elain then tells him that she can hear his heart beating through the stone when she sleeps. When asked if Lucien hears hers, he replies that he does not. Eventually, Lucien realizes that Elain is not interested in acknowledging the mating bond between them and exits the room, but on his way out he states that Elain needs fresh air and for Feyre and Nesta to take her to the sea or garden as a way to get her out of the house.\n\nAfter Lucien decides to help Feyre and the Night Court in gathering allies for the coming war with Hybern. He goes on a quest to find the missing cursed mortal queen, Vassa, in an attempt to win her aid in the coming war and to show his loyalty to the Night Court, but specifically Feyre. Before leaving, Elain came to see him out and Lucien inclined his head in a bow in hopes of hiding the longing and sadness in his eyes. When he turned to go, Lucien didn't glance back at her nor did he see the half step she took towards him. Rhysand takes him to the Continent where he has to continue his journey alone.\n\nWhen he finds Vassa she is already heading to Prythian with Mr. Archeron, Feyre's father, and a mortal army. During the journey, they become friends and encounter the Seraphim army under Prince Drakon and Miryam, and Tamlin. They all arrive at the final battle between Hybern and Prythian just in time to aid in battle.\n\nImmediately after the battle Lucien finds Feyre and tells her all about his quest with her father and Vassa. When Feyre teases Lucien about sounding like an acolyte, he blushes before glancing at Elain who peers at him as the trio start walking. Lucien is the first and only person to acknowledge Elain's role in killing Hybern and soon after when Feyre nudges Elain, she blurts out for him to come to Velaris. Feyre then leaves Lucien and Elain alone to find a place to wash up from the battle or to simply talk.\n\nHe is seen at the meeting called by Feyre in the ruins of the Archeron's Estate to renegotiate a new Treaty between faeries and mortals. There Tamlin sees him dressed in Illyrian leathers and feels hurt, but in reality he is wearing them because it is the only thing he had at the time. Rhysand offers him a place in Velaris and he says it would be a pleasure for him to live there but after the war he stays behind to help take care of the wounded mortals and has to speak to Tamlin before leaving, for whom Feyre asks him to deliver a note. Lucien is seen spending time with Vassa, relaxed and chuckling at something she says before leaving to travel with her and Jurian.\n\nA Court of Frost and Starlight[]\n\nAfter the end of the war against Hybern Lucien who continues to work for the Night Court moves out of the town house into his own apartment in Velaris as Elain can not bear to be in his presence. He spends his time traveling to the Spring Court, to care for Tamlin, and to the southern Mortal Lands of Prythian, where he starts living with Jurian and Vassa in a manor given to them by Graysen. The three become very good friends and he serves as a link between mortals and faeries. Together they call themselves the Band of Exiles and while Jurian and Vassa rule the Mortal Lands Lucien does his best to help.\n\nHe sends twice-weekly reports to Rhysand's spymaster, Azriel. He gives information about the human lands and how Jurian and Vassa are dealing with it. On a visit to Tamlin, Lucien returns to the Night Court full of bruises, a short time later he has his belongings thrown at the door of his apartment in the Night Court, he believes that this action by Tamlin was provoked by his and Rhysand's conversation when the latter went to the Spring Court to check on Tamlin's condition as Rhysand was especially cruel in his words to him. Tamlin is practically dead while alive and does not care to protect his territory from invasion. Lucien stops going to see Tamlin at his request but still feels sorry for him.\n\nOn the day of Winter Solstice he shows up at the town house carrying gifts for Feyre and Elain. He stays for a while talking to Feyre and asks how Elain is doing, he is seen trying to restrain himself when he finds out that she is still grieving for Graysen, he also informs her of his life with Jurian and Vassa. After Feyre reacts negatively, learning the Band of Exiles have become friends, he points out him having nowhere else to go is partialy her fault due to her actions at the Spring Court. He also mentions Rhysand going too far during his last visit to Tamlin resulted in things deteriorating further between Tamlin and Lucien. After his conversation with Feyre, he leaves.\n\nA Court of Silver Flames[]\n\nLucien remains an emissary of the Night Court, allied with Jurian and Vassa, and also in the Spring Court with Tamlin. Mor tells Cassian that he should start going to the Band of Exiles to gather information, because she believes that because Lucien has chosen to live with Jurian and Vassa, not as an emissary but as friends, any information would be skewed in their favor. Cassian believes that for this reason perhaps the reports on Vassa can't be unbiased. Cassian then decides to pay them a visit.\n\nWhen Cassian goes to the Band of Exiles he is met by Lucien who informs him that Eris is also there. Azriel informs Rhys that Lucien needs to be informed about Feyre's pregnancy and that he needs to be placed permanently in Spring Court for him to deal with Tamlin. He makes an appearance at the House of Wind at Feyre's behest to find out how Nesta's training is going and seems apprehensive about her powers. On the winter solstice, he goes to a party at Feyre's house. He is seen talking with Cassian and Rhysand about sports. He brought gifts for Feyre and Elain, Cassian notices Lucien's look of disappointment and longing as he looks at Elain opening her gift and sympathizes with him.\n\nAppearance[]\n\nLucien is tall with red hair and sun-kissed/golden skin a few shades darker than his half-brothers, but still light enough to have passed for Beron's son for centuries. The left side of his face is brutally scarred from brow to his jaw. His right eye is whole and russet-colored; but his left eye was ripped out by Amarantha and has been replaced with an artificial mechanical eye made of gold that allows him to see all the same. His features are described as sharp, elegant, and ethereally handsome despite the length of scars on his face.\n\nPersonality[]\n\nLucien is clever, sarcastic, witty and loyal to a fault. He also is perceptive and notices a lot of things other people don't. In addition, Lucien has many emotional scars as a result of Beron's cruelty and abuse of him, which emboldened his half-brothers to treat him similarly. Lucien covers up his anguish and trauma under the guise of a bright, charismatic personality. He deeply cares for the people he loves and he is beyond loyal to them.\n\nPowers and Abilities[]\n\nLucien wields fire magic which he inherited from his mother, the Lady of the Autumn Court, who hails from a family with a strong magical bloodline of flame wielders. Lucien has healing abilities as well, which he uses to heal Feyre during their time Under the Mountain. He also has the ability to winnow. Furthermore, Lucien possesses spell-cleaving powers from his father Helion who is High Lord of the Day Court. A glimpse of his spell-cleaving powers was seen in A Court of Mist and Fury when he broke through the binding spell placed by Hybern with ease.\n\nHis mechanical eye has magical properties that allow him to see through spells and glamours.\n\nRelationships[]\n\nVanserra Family[]\n\nLucien hates his family because his father murdered the faerie he loved. Also, his brothers were cruel and attempted to kill him so that he would not be a threat to them their ambition of inheriting title of High Lord of the Autumn Court. Beron suspected that Lucien was not his biological son as he learned of the affair his wife had with the High Lord of the Day Court, Helion. For that reason, he ordered his other sons to hunt Lucien down after he left the court. Lucien's mother loves him devotedly.\n\nJesminda[]\n\nWhile living in the Autumn Court, Lucien met Jesminda, a Lesser Faerie who lived in the countryside. She teased and seduced him until the pair eventually fell in love. Jesminda appreciated Lucien for who he was, instead of loving him for his noble rank. Lucien loved her with the same amount of appreciation and even believed she was the most beautiful female he knew. The pair were not mated, though this did not diminish their love.\n\nThe pair's love was cut short, as Beron believed it was inappropriate for a High Fae noble to have a relationship with a Lesser Faerie, and so he executed Jesminda in front of Lucien. This had a harrowing effect on Lucien, who fled to the Spring Court for safety.\n\nElain Archeron[]\n\nAt the end of A Court of Mist and Fury, Lucien realizes that Elain is his mate after she comes out of the Cauldron, having been Made Fae. When Lucien and Feyre leave the Spring Court and travel together, he asks her about Elain, wanting to know if she is worth fighting for.\n\nWhen Lucien sees his mate again in the Night Court, he finds her withdrawn and suffering with her new life. He sits with her and drinks tea. Elain says she can hear Lucien's heartbeat. When she asks him if he can hear hers Lucien says he cannot. Elain also comments on the feeling of the Bond between them, telling him that she can feel it and that it is as there he had pulled on a thread tied to her ribs.\n\nWhen Lucien volunteers to go on a quest to find Vassa in the Mortal Lands, Elain appears to wish to say something to him before he leaves, but stops herself, and remains silent. After the war, Elain asks Lucien to stay in Velaris.\n\nTheir relationship continues to regress as both Elain and Lucien appear to feel uncomfortable around each other. Elain avoids and ignores Lucien as much as possible while Lucien keeps his distance. Lucien however continues to bring Elain gifts.\n\nVassa[]\n\nLucien met Vassa when he went on a quest to find her and attain her help for the war against Hybern, and hopefully help break her curse. On the journey, they became friends.\n\nHe visits Vassa and Jurian often enough and soon after chooses to move in with them in a manor situated near the human lands. Feyre is surprised to find that Vassa, Jurian, and Lucien have become friends and together they call themselves the Band of Exiles.\n\nTamlin[]\n\nAfter Jesminda's death, Lucien left the Autumn Court in hopes of escaping the cruelty of his father and brothers but he had nowhere to go. Tamlin offered Lucien a place to stay in his manor. He made Lucien the emissary of the Spring Court and they became friends as they worked together for years. When Amarantha ripped Lucien's eye out, scarring him forever, Tamlin rejected her advances. After Under the Mountain, Tamlin became increasingly aggressive and toxic. He became abusive, both physically and mentally. Lucien's loyalty kept him tied to Tamlin despite his behavior. Even after the war against Hybern, when Tamlin was devastated and alone, it was Lucien who checked on him and gave him food out of empathy and good heartedness. Despite that, Tamlin abused Lucien physically and dumped his belongings away.\n\nFeyre Archeron[]\n\nLucien and Feyre have a rocky relationship. In A Court of Thorns and Roses, he dislikes her at first, being sarcastic and mocking towards her for having killed his friend Andras. Slowly, they start trusting each other and are seen joking around. He stands up for Feyre Under the Mountain, helps her in her challenges and even risks his life to heal her. In A Court of Mist and Fury, he pleads with Tamlin to let Feyre train. Feyre further betrays their friendship by using Lucien to make Tamlin jealous, putting Lucien's life at risk with little care for the consequences. Feyre brings Lucien along to the Night Court after they leave the Spring Court. Their relationship continues to fracture as Lucien is not treated with respect there. When Lucien finds friendship with Vassa and Jurian, Feyre mocks their group named Band of Exiles by making a joke instead of understanding him.\n\nJurian[]\n\nJurian is a member of the Band of Exiles. Lucien and him got off on a rocky start as he goaded Lucien about Elain being in the Night Court, but later become good friends.\n\nNuan[]\n\nNuan is an old friend of Lucien. She made Lucien's mechanical eye after Amarantha tore his eye out. Their relationship is not expanded upon beyond this, however she is of a different court than Lucien.\n\nIanthe[]\n\nLucien is bitter and cold towards Ianthe, rejecting her sexual advances. Ianthe, however, is interested in the prospect of having a child with Lucien, as their offspring would be powerful and respected. She attempts to gain his interest, but he consistently ignores her. During the night of Calanmai, Tamlin refuses to participate in the Rite. Lucien believes it is his duty to perform in the Great Rite, and so he sleeps with Ianthe reluctantly. It is something Lucien regrets and is deeply embarrassed about. After Ianthe kidnaps Elain and takes her to Hybern, Lucien becomes more bitter to Ianthe. Despite his constant rejections, Ianthe locks him in shackles in hopes of forcing him to accept her sexually. Lucien does not concede to her advances even after this.\n\nTrivia[]\n\nThe name Lucien is of French origin and means light.[13]\n\nSarah J.

However, when she started writing A Court of Mist and Fury, Maas came to the conclusion that this relationship wouldn't work.[14]\n\nSarah J. Maas talked on Twitter that Lucien and Dorian Havilliard of Throne of Glass, would probably be best friends.[15]\n\nOn her YouTube channel, Sarah J. Maas said that one of the characters she would love to write her books together with would be Lucien, she said she thinks it would be fun because he's smart so he would be able to make extensive plots.[16]\n\nReferences[]\n\n↑ In A Court of Thorns and Roses Rhysand says to Lucien: \"I was slaughtering on the battlefield before you were even born\" given Rhysand finished his training at 28 years old when the War started which was 500 years before the events of the book, Lucien is less than 500 years old.\n\n↑ World of Sarah J.
