        "text": "Founded in 1985, Princess tam tam is a lingerie, swimwear, and women’s clothing brand known for its freedom, cheerfulness, and audacity. The brand sells its items in around fifty stores in France and abroad, as well as in several department store corners, and through its e-commerce site.\n\nSince 2005, Princess tam tam has been part of the Fast Retailing group, which also owns the Uniqlo and Comptoir des Cotonniers brands, creating synergies within the group.\n\nRepositioning the brand with accessible prices while proving that quality is still present\n\nEvolving products and services based on customer feedback\n\nContinuing growth by optimizing the purchasing process\n\nPrincess tam tam’s strategy includes using ratings and reviews to demonstrate the quality of their products. They also use this feedback to understand customer desires and collaborate internally on product and service evolution.\n\nTo withstand the market’s challenges and invigorate its stores, Fast Retailing decided a few months ago to reposition Princess tam tam with even more accessible prices. This attractive new pricing is made possible through group synergies, optimizing manufacturing processes, and reducing costs while maintaining product quality.\n\nTo reassure customers about maintaining quality, it was essential to collect genuine and verified customer reviews. Princess tam tam decided to increase review collection by soliciting feedback across all purchase channels using Skeepers Ratings & Reviews to its fullest capacity.\n\nSystematically collecting reviews with a reliable, certified solution\n\nIntegrating reviews and ratings into product pages to increase conversion rates\n\nListening to the customer’s voice by analyzing and sharing reviews internally\n\nPrincess tam tam uses Skeepers Ratings & Reviews (formerly Avis Vérifiés) to gather reviews that enrich product pages and reassure customers about product benefits. With Skeepers’ trusted third-party quality, reviews and ratings are certified as authentic.\n\nAfter each purchase, an automatic email is sent to the customer to collect their feedback. The rating is displayed on the product page through a widget that automatically retrieves and calculates the average. When a negative review is detected, it is easily identified through Skeepers’ management console, allowing customer service to quickly address any dissatisfaction.\n\nTo increase review collection, Princess tam tam now sends an email to in-store shoppers 48 hours after their purchase. This initiative, launched a few months ago, has seen a good response rate, with more engaged customers eager to share their experiences.\n\nWith Feedback Management, Princess tam tam can also analyze reviews with refined segmentation by product category or store.\n\nIncrease in average rating by 0.3 points in a few months\n\nIncrease in the volume of collected ratings and reviews\n\nProduct innovation driven by ideas gathered from customer reviews\n\nBy systematically sending messages to customers who made in-store purchases, Princess tam tam has significantly accelerated the collection of customer reviews. Today, 70% of reviews come from in-store customers.\n\nDisplaying these ratings and reviews on product pages reassures customers that the quality of materials and cuts remains high, even with more accessible prices. This also boosts conversion rates: items with more ratings and reviews have higher add-to-cart rates.\n\nFor Princess tam tam, analyzing detailed reviews fuels innovation, allowing them to create items that meet customer expectations with new materials, new designs, and optimizations of the brand’s iconic products. Reviews are also used to improve purchasing and delivery processes and in-store service, increasing customer satisfaction and loyalty.\n\nTo further optimize conversion, Princess tam tam plans to integrate reviews and ratings into the checkout process once a product is added to the cart. They also aim to set up a process for each department to consult their respective dashboards for more segmented customer voice analysis."
