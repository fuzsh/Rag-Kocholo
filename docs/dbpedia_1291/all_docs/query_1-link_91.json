        "text": "Christine Phung is a French fashion designer. She studied fashion at the Ecole Duperré and then at the IFM Paris. She began her career working for brands such as Lemaire, Veja, See by Chloé, Baby Dior, Vanessa Bruno and Lacoste. In 2011, Christine Phung launched her own eponymous label and presented her first show at Paris Fashion Week in 2012.\n\nResident at Les Ateliers de Paris from 2011 to 2013, her eponymous label is characterized by an innovative approach to fashion, combining traditional couture techniques with modern technologies. Her creations are inspired by geometric, organic and architectural forms, contemporary art, a passion for pattern and a singular outlook on her time.\n\nChristine Phung's creations are both emotional and functional. She won the Grand Prix de la Création de la Ville de Paris in 2011, and the Prix des Premières Collections de l'ANDAM (Association Nationale pour le Développement des Arts de la Mode) in 2013. In 2016, she became Artistic Director of Leonard, a fashion house she helped modernize while respecting its identity codes; then Artistic Director Image for Princesse Tam Tam for two years. Today, Christine Phung collaborates with LaFrançaise, a knitwear brand whose transformation she is accompanying. She continues to create innovative, sustainable collections with her brand of arty, sustainable shirts, while exploring new forms of artistic expression.\n\nI'm convinced that fashion, which embodies the energy of creation, makes a garment as singular as a work of art. Color is a language that shines on oneself and others. My aim is to offer clothes that fill the wearer with a feeling of radiance and singularity, of strength, happiness and joy. Clothes have the power to transform the way we perceive ourselves.\n\nChristine Phung\n\nIts news\n\nChristine Phung, is preparing her second Arty and Sustainable collection, scheduled for early spring.\n\nAt the same time, the designer is embarking on an eco-responsible initiative with the imminent launch of a line of leather goods (sourced from dormant stocks of luxury suppliers) 100% made in France.\n\nShe is also preparing a new line of 100% made-in-France caps in collaboration with the Headonist brand.\n\nIn addition to her role as Artistic Director for the \"La Francaise\" brand, where she is responsible for the artistic direction of collections and image, Christine Phung is involved in wider projects, such as the design of eco-designed uniforms for a hotel in Toulouse opening this summer."
