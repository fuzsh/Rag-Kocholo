        "text": "Gambettes Box is a tights subscription with no commitment period where you receive two pairs of tights each month (delivery included of course).\n\nWhether you're a fan of tights that turn heads: delicately patterned, sometimes sparkly (because life is short) but never neon, or more classic tights: polka dots or stripes have them delivered to your doorstep in a neat little package!\n\nOur deniers range from 20D (being or lightest) to 90D (cosy for those winter mornings), and they come in sizes 1, 2 and 3 (S, M & L). We're proud to share that all our tights are designed in France and made in Italy. Did we mention they're super comfortable?\n\nOccasionally they're exclusive: indeed French boutiques such as Princesse tam.tam, Tara Jarmon and Claudie Pierlot have been known to create limited edition tights with us.\n\nGambettes Box is not just a tights subscription, it is also a gift subscription. We share secret projects we've been working on such as Cervin, as well as offer collectable tote bags and other limited edition products."
