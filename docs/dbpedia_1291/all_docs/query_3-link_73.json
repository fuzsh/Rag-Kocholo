        "text": "Hometown: NYC.\n\nOccupation: Publishing strategist and food writer.\n\nFavorite destinations: France, Argentina, and back home, now that I live in London.\n\nDying to visit: Marrakech.\n\nBizarre travel rituals: I send myself a postcard from everywhere I go, so I can always remember really being there.\n\nIn-flight relaxation regime: I take off my shoes and put on socks. Then I curl up, and watch a movie I've already seen. I feel planes are a place for re-runs.\n\nAlways in carry-on: Ear plugs. The best ones are made by Quiet Please. You're a fool to travel without them.\n\nConcierge or DIY? Now, DIY. One day, concierge.\n\nSee it all or take it easy? I'm guilty of see it all, although I admire the take-it-easies.\n\nDrive or be driven? Be driven to the airport; drive when you get there.\n\nTravel hero: Is it wrong to say myself? I have to say I'm a travel super trooper. I travel so much, but I'm proudest that I often travel alone. Nothing stops me from being where I want to be.\n\nWeirdest thing seen on travels: When I was in Buenos Aires, I signed up for a \"tango massage.\" The dollar was incredibly strong, I was in my early twenties, and I wanted some luxury. Two men massaged me for 90 minutes, completely synchronized with each other and the rhythm of the tango music pulsating through the room. I highly recommend.\n\nBest hotel amenity: chocolates on the pillow. They're starting to go the way of playing cards and peanuts on airplanes, and I'm not happy about it.\n\nI dream about my meal at The Red Bicycle in Santorini.\n\nEverywhere I go, I check out the menus, and take vigorous notes on how to rip them off at home!\n\nWhen I arrive in a new place, I learn the lay of the land by buying a Streetwise map. Not to plug a brand, but these are truly amazing. They show just what you need to know, and are indestructible. I keep a collection on my bookshelf.\n\nI always bring home clothes and food. From England, it was pre-revamp Burberry scarves and rose-scented chocolates. From France, Princesse Tam Tam lingerie and cans of cassoulet and flavored mustards. From Argentina, gorgeous leather shoes and cans of dulce de leche. Typical, maybe, but there's a reason these places are so famous for beautiful and delicious things!\n\nIf I never return to __________, it'll be too soon because __________________. I swear, I can't answer this question. Even if it sucks, I just love going somewhere.\n\nI travel for the chocolates on the pillow.\n\nMORE KERRY"
