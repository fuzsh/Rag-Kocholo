        "text": "This summer, I’m curious to try out this different way of wearing a bra…\n\nFirst off, what color bras do you wear? I have two black and two nude. I haven’t had a white bra since my childhood training bra.\n\nBut the other day, we were chatting with Allison Beale of Journelle, and she pointed out something interesting:\n\nThere is definitely a difference between American and French approaches to lingerie. We talk about this constantly around here. Most American women are not as bold in showing off their lingerie. There’s a basic understanding here — maybe it was a lesson we all learned from our mothers and grandmothers? — that bras are for support, coverage and not to be seen. A nude bra, the American staple, showcases your blouse. A white bra, which European women often wear, showcases your whole outfit, bra included.\n\nHave you heard this before? European readers, do you wear white bras? I’m inspired to pair one with white tees and jeans this summer.\n\nP.S. My underwear solution.\n\n(Photo by Whitney Hayes.)\n\nMore to Love\n\n10 TV series that my husband and I both loved.\n\nThe Filipina American author talks about signature lipsticks, gray hair, and her love of Dance Church.\n\n*Types \"Wears multiple hats\" on resume.*\n\nNine people on the NYC streets shared their outfits."
