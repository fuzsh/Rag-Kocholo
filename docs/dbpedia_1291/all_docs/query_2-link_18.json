        "text": "Paris Underneath it All\n\nA tantalizing tour of where to buy the best unmentionables Paris has to offer\n\nFrom stern old-fashioned corsetières to tiny boudoirs, every quartier of Paris has at least one lingerie boutique. For the ultimate chic, head to the smart fashion hubs of St-Germain-des-Prés and the rue St-Honoré, where French lingerie brands, mostly designed by women for women, maintain a long tradition of silk and lace making. Some of these undies look so delicious you feel you should be reclining on a chaise longue to show them off; others are all about comfort (while sacrificing none of the chic—this is France, after all).\n\n1. Aubade\n\nAubade’s ongoing advertising series “Lessons in Seduction” says everything about this high-end French brand, a favorite among Parisiennes. Founded in 1875 as a girdle and corset maker, Aubade is famed for introducing lingerie with bright colors and printed motifs. The small boutique at 22 rue du Vieux Colombier, one of eight in Paris, has a friendly staff who are equally adept at advising women on what to try and men on what to buy as a gift (45-48-16-62).\n\n2. Cadolle\n\nHerminie Cadolle is credited with inventing the bra in 1889, thus liberating women from the corset. Four generations later, this little red-and-gold boutique is still a purveyor of the kind of undergarment that molds your body into the perfect shape—all the better to show off that body-skimming dress (4 rue Cambon; 42-60-94-22). For the bespoke version, head around the corner to the by-appointment-only Loft Couture (255 rue St-Honoré; 42-60-94-94).\n\n3. Carine Gilson\n\nGilson’s lingerie is gorgeous, outrageously expensive, and completely handmade, using only natural silks and French lace. The designs are refined and romantic, featuring wispy, almost transparent black nothings and peachy satins with delicate lacy motifs (18 rue de Grenelle; 43-26-46-71).\n\n4. Chantal Thomass\n\nThe slinky-white interior of this pretty boutique, strategically positioned next to fashionista favorite Colette, provides a boudoir backdrop for striking designs by Chantal Thomass, one of the pioneers of underwear as fashion. With their instantly recognizable black silhouette logo, Thomass’s flirty creations have just the right dose of Belle Époque nostalgia, with lots of ivory and black lace, clever pleats, and almost sculptural bra trimmings (211 rue St-Honoré; 42-60-40-56).\n\n5. Eres\n\nEres is synonymous in France with sophisticated body-sculpting swimwear and discreet good taste, but it also added a lingerie line at the end of the ’90s. The look is pared-back and modern and makes good use of innovative fabrics and near-nude shades (2 rue Tronchet; 47-42-28-82).\n\n6. Fifi Chachnil\n\nFifi Chachnil’s style is fun and flirtatious with a hint of the ’50s: Think Brigitte Bardot meets Betty Boop—there’s lots of polka-dot details and contrasting ribbon bows. Chachnil, who was responsible for creating the wispiest of costumes for the famed Crazy Horse cabaret revue, is also a singer; strains from her eponymous CD fill the gloriously frilly boutique (231 rue St-Honoré, at the back of the courtyard; 42-61-21-83).\n\n7. Laurence Tavernier\n\nLaurence Tavernier’s nightwear and homewear are a genre all their own. The luxurious, comfortable dressing gowns, robes, and nightdresses in fine cotton, silk, or modal are just meant for lounging. There’s also a men’s line (32 rue du Bac; 49-27-01-69).\n\n8. Laure Sokol\n\nThe Marais branch of this multi-brand mini-chain is a stylish update of the traditional neighborhood lingerie shop, offering a wide range of sizes and classic brands. The staff are conscientious and knowledgeable (84 rue François Miron; 42-76-92-25).\n\n9. Le Bon Marché\n\nThe oldest and most Parisian of the great department stores has a spacious, softly lit lingerie department. The choices range from basics by Dim and Triumph to snappy young styles by Stella McCartney to luxurious offerings by Carine Gilson. There’s also a comprehensive hosiery selection (24 rue de Sèvres; 44-39-80-00).\n\n10. Louise Feuillère\n\nFar from the well-worn fashion trails, appropriately located on the rue des Dames, Louise Feuillère carries bras, corsets, and bustiers that are an incredible meeting of craftsmanship and sexiness. There’s a definite touch of Zola’s Nana in the boned serretailles and corsets, but everything’s been rendered in updated fabrics and colors. The shop’s real specialty, though, is ensuring the perfect fit, either through ­_demi-mesure_, which means you can have items on display made in your size, or sur mesure—fully bespoke creations (102 rue des Dames; 42-93-17-76).\n\n11. Princesse Tam Tam\n\nPrincesse Tam Tam’s lingerie and swimwear designs are young, contemporary, fun, and affordable but also charmingly evocative of the 1950s retro look, with high-waisted culottes, dainty boxers, and pointy bras in plain colors or graphic prints (4 rue de Sèvres; 45-48-27-49).\n\n12. Sabbia Rosa\n\nMany connoisseurs consider Sabbia Rosa the ultimate in sensuality, and its pale-green-fronted shop in St-Germain-des-Prés is frequented by movie stars. The wares are luscious and romantic—delicate satin negligees, shocking-pink or emerald-green silk bustiers, and panties trimmed with creamy lace—and there’s a sur mesure service as well (73 rue des Sts-Pères; 45-48-88-37).\n\nPhoto Credits\n\nParisian Souveniers: Photograph by David Prince; Styled by Robyn Glaser.
