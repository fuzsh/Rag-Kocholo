        "text": "I’ve been learning about lingerie for well over a decade now. One of the fascinating parts of that has been discovering how styles differ between countries. What’s popular in one place isn’t necessarily the norm elsewhere.\n\nCertain countries have a particularly distinctive lingerie aesthetic. Not surprisingly, France is one of them. And not just because the word lingerie itself comes from the French language. France has also given us Paris, one of the world’s fashion capitals. So style is much more than just a small part of this country’s culture.\n\nIf I had to summarise the French lingerie aesthetic in one word, I would probably say ‘refined.’ Or maybe ‘elegant.’ It’s stylish, but there is less emphasis in general on short-term trends. Instead, they are experts at designing beautifully timeless looks.\n\nLumineuse half-cup bra\n\nAvailable in sizes 30D-38D\n\nvia Simone Pérèle\n\nExpresso balcony bra & string\n\nAvailable in sizes 32B-36D & XS-XL\n\nvia LIVY\n\nMy very favorite thing about French lingerie is that they are big on lace and embroidery. Again, this is hardly a surprise. France is well-known as the place to go for luxury laces. Lace from the cities Calais and Caudry are considered some of the finest in the world.\n\nFrench lingerie often has a particular delicacy to it. Nowadays, you can find molded-cup bras anywhere, including France. But it’s the unlined cup that reigns as the quintessential French bra style. It’s the best way to show off the patterns of those laces and embroideries, after all!\n\nDemi-cups are especially popular among French brands. Even the name is French; ‘demi’ means half. And as for the other half of a lingerie set, the French like that ‘demi’ too. A cheeky cut that’s halfway between a full-coverage brief and a thong is a staple of French lingerie design. I find it ultra-flattering, so I get the appeal.\n\nAu Bal de Flore St Tropez short\n\nAvailable in sizes XS-2XL\n\nvia Aubade\n\nWhite Nights bra\n\nAvailable in sizes 32C-36DD\n\nvia Passionata\n\nFrench lingerie is not, however, only attractive from a style perspective. There’s also a strong focus on fit. The country is home to some of the longest-running brands in the industry. They’ve had plenty of time to perfect their sizing.\n\nChantelle, for example, launched in 1876. Cadolle launched in 1889. Maison Lejaby in 1930, Empreinte and Lou in 1946, and Simone Pérèle in 1948. Lise Charmel followed in the 1950s. Aubade launched in 1958, although its parent company was making corsets as far back as 1875.\n\nAll of the brands I’ve just mentioned are luxury ones. France is a country that takes its lingerie seriously! You’ll find no shortage of high-end lingerie design houses here. But for something more budget-friendly, take a look at Etam, Princesse Tam Tam, and Chantelle owned Passionata. These have a more fast-fashion take on lingerie. But the lace, embroidery, and general love of decoration are still there.\n\nRoom bra\n\nAvailable in sizes 32B-36C\n\nvia Etam\n\nThalia underwired balconette bra by Empreinte\n\nAvailable in sizes 30E-42F\n\nvia Figleaves\n\nAs to fit and size, French lingerie tends to come in a wide-ish size range. Larger plus sizes are generally lacking. Band sizes below a 32 are still a rarity. And a few brands have limited size offerings. Cadolle, for example, only makes three band sizes and B-D cups. But the majority of French lingerie brands go beyond a D cup, at least.\n\nThere’s a phrase in French, la séduction voilée. It translates to ‘the veiled seduction,’ and references having a tiny flash of your lingerie on show. A decorative bra strap is a common feature among French brands, as is a lacy bra peeking out from a slightly unbuttoned blouse.\n\nFrench lingerie isn’t just foundation wear; it’s fashion. And it’s designed to be seen!"
