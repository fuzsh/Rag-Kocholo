        "text": "JULIE\n\n@juliesfi\n\n—\n\nWe heard you just got back from a special summer shoot in Marseille for Princesse tam tam. How did it go? Could you share a little anecdote with us?\n\nSure! It was wonderful. The weather was lovely despite the mistral wind that intruded on the shoot and was not exactly friendly to my bangs!\n\n—\n\nThe three of you are young women, all very different yet all very contemporary. Is diversity of style something that is important to you? Friendship? Sisterhood?\n\nNaturally, it's even better to be able to share unique moments together with friends by mixing our styles.\n\n—\n\nHow would you describe your own personal style in three words?\n\nColourful, comfortable, and versatile.\n\n—\n\nWhat provides you energy and drive on a daily basis?\n\nMy coffee.\n\n—\n\nFor you, summer is synonymous with... ?\n\nLazing around, having a drink with friends, in Corsica of course, and lots of swim suits.\n\n—\n\nIf you could only take five things, clothes or otherwise, in a suitcase to an unknown holiday destination, what would you pack?\n\nSwim suits, disposable camera, a good book, a shirt/shorts combo, and my little dog!\n\n—\n\nIf you were given the choice, right now, where would you go?\n\nTo Ile Rousse quite simply, my home village in Corsica.\n\n—\n\nYou probably need to travel a lot for your work, whether it's near or far. Do you have any tips on how to travel light while still being prepared for all eventualities?\n\nI cannot offer any advice at all. No matter how hard I try, I just can't seem to travel light! However, I do think you should go for the classics, simple items that can be easily mixed and matched to suit any occasion!\n\n—\n\nWhat is your favourite thing about Princesse tam tam? Why does this brand appeal to you? Is there something about its very philosophy that resonates with the woman you are?\n\nPrincesse tam tam is representative of my evolution as a woman. When I was a teenager, my mother treated me to their beautiful pyjamas and my first lingerie items. It became my reference and a discreet testimony to my life as a woman.\n\n—\n\nA favourite model of ours? A must-have item or something you've been eyeing?\n\nI really like one-piece swim suits and frilly panties!\n\nEMMANUELLE\n\n@emmanuelle_k\n\n—\n\nWe heard you just got back from a special summer shoot in Marseille for Princesse tam tam. So how was it?\n\nIt was really nice. A photo shoot in the sun by the sea, what more could anyone ask for?\n\n—\n\nThe three of you are young women, all very different yet all very contemporary. Is diversity of style something that is important to you? Friendship? Sisterhood?\n\nObviously, stylistic diversity is really important to me, as is friendship and sisterhood. It is through our diversity that we become more complete and able to learn from others and from life. It creates bonds and opens the mind.\n\n—\n\nHow would you describe your own personal style in three words?\n\nFeminine, chic, retro.\n\n—\n\nWhat provides you energy and drive on a daily basis?\n\nBeing consistent in my wellness routine (meditation, gratitude, and such), spending time with my boyfriend, listening to music, dancing, and doing things that keep me in a good mood.\n\n—\n\nFor you, summer is synonymous with... ?\n\nHappiness and good humour.\n\n—\n\nIf you could only take five things, clothes or otherwise, in a suitcase to an unknown holiday destination, what would you pack?\n\nA good book, a camera, a swim suit, sunglasses and my sun cream.\n\n—\n\nIf you were given the choice, right now, where would you go?\n\nTo Bali, I've never been there and it's always been a dream.\n\n—\n\nYou probably need to travel a lot for your work, whether it's near or far. Do you have any tips on how to travel light while still being prepared for all eventualities?\n\nUnfortunately, I really don't know how to travel light, so I would love some advice!\n\n—\n\nWhat is your favourite thing about Princesse tam tam? Why does this brand appeal to you?

Sisterhood?\n\nObviously diversity is very important!\n\n—\n\nHow would you describe your own personal style in three words?\n\nI change my style almost every day. I have all kinds of things in my wardrobe.\n\n—\n\nWhat provides you energy and drive on a daily basis?\n\nelling myself that nothing happens by chance and that life is an experience to be lived, energises me.\n\n—\n\nFor you, summer is synonymous with... ?\n\nSummer is synonymous with sunsets over the ocean below my house.\n\n—\n\nIf you could only take five things, clothes or otherwise, in a suitcase to an unknown holiday destination, what would you pack?\n\nA book, sun cream, my sunglasses, a notebook for writing and my film camera.\n\n—\n\nIf you were given the choice, right now, where would you go?\n\nCosta Rica.\n\n—\n\nYou probably need to travel a lot for your work, whether it's near or far.
