        "text": "Itâ€™s always good to see big retailers offering big discounts in a time of the year in which they make their big profits. Not everyone has the money (or the mental state, haha) to spend over $100 on a bra and a thong â€” and a good sale always helps those people get their hands on some high quality stuff tooâ€¦\n\nThis Figleaves sale is a pretty big one. Theyâ€™re throwing 40% off select sleepwear and lingerie from brands such as Elle Macpherson Intimates, Betsey Johnson Intimates, Princesse Tam Tam, Chantelle, Charnos, Felina, Diesel and Eberjeyâ€¦\n\nFigleaves Holiday Sale â€” Check it out!\n\nAt the click of your mouse, Figleaves.com brings you more than 40 different brands of sleepwear, ranging from sleek and sexy to cozy and cute, from high-end designers to nighttime basics!\n\nThe strength of Figlevaes.com has always been their huge stocklist, and their sleepwear stock is continuously growingâ€¦ Big names such as Eberjey, Elle Machperson intimates, Bodas, PJ Salvage, â€¦ but also a lot of smaller labels!\n\nNo images, just two links: FIGLEAVES UK and FIGLEAVES US Sleepwear!\n\nItâ€™s always great to discover new retailers, and especially when they stock some of the brands we love the most! The UK-based e-boutique La Femme Fatale Lingerie features luxury labels Beau Bra, Princesse Tam Tam, Charnos, Gossard and Fleur T â€” not too shabby!\n\nThe brand selection is obviously the strongest point of the store: theyâ€™re all luxurious labels that need no introduction and that are famous for their good value for money. Iâ€™m pretty much sold if a store has both Charnos and Beau Bra â€” so consider the brands approved.\n\nThe price tags are okay â€” theyâ€™re cheaper than letâ€™s say Figleaves for most of the shared items, so thatâ€™s never a bad deal!\n\nShipping is a great plus! La Femme Fatale does free shipping within the UK, and does free packing. Thatâ€™s always great â€” seeing as we hate to spend money on anything but the pieces! Off course, LFF also ships worldwide â€” yet not for free! ðŸ˜‰\n\nGood brand selection, good prices, free shipping â€” sounds like a winner. Let us know about your experiences on the forums, though!\n\nWeâ€™ve featured Liaison Dangereuse a few weeks ago (read all about them right here), and here they are again with 3 sexy new collection that were added to their lovely e-boutique: Autumn/Winter collections by Princesse Tam Tam, Rosapois and the beautiful AW collection by Mimi Holliday! You can check them all right here on the LD website, but seeing as the Rosapois label is new on The Lingerie Post, Iâ€™ve decided to pick photos from their range!\n\nI actually adore the pieces â€” very feminine, but all in warm and romantic winter-colors: it works. Price tags of around Ã¢â€šÂ¬50 for a bra,Ã¢â€šÂ¬25 for thong/panties â€” not too expensive.\n\nEnjoy the photo set â€” more Rosapois (and Liaison Dangereuse) to come soon â€” I promise!\n\nLiaison Dangereuse is a brand new online lingerie boutique â€” and even though theyâ€™re currently only available in German, theyâ€™re very much worth getting some attention on our blog seeing as they have an excellent brand selection and theyâ€™re planning on translating their website in the next few monthsâ€¦\n\nBrand Selection\n\nThe brand selection is awesome: Chantal Thomass, I.D. Sarrieri, Moontide, Princesse Tam Tam, Mimi Holliday, Pleasure State and Elise Aucouturier â€” all luxurious, high quality brands that arenâ€™t always easy to find on the net. Theyâ€™ll be adding Madame V to that list in august â€” something we can only applaud!\n\nPricing\n\nThis is Euro-pricing and even though thatâ€™s my home currency Iâ€™m not too used to comparing prices in Euro. After doing some calculating the prices look competitive, though! Donâ€™t expect cheap â€” these pieces just arenâ€™t. ðŸ˜‰\n\nSome teasers\n\nEnjoy these pretty photos â€” some of my favorites at Liaison Dangereuse.\n\nCheck them out â€” and let us know if you buy something, weâ€™re always interested in knowing how the shopping experience is at new shops!"
