        "text": "Paris Underneath it All\n\nWhy do French women, as the saying goes, feel so good in their skin? There are many light, lacy little reasons. Gully Wells follows the (silken) thread to Paris—and the city’s famed emporiums of fine lingerie\n\nWhat is it about French women that makes them so maddening? Not all of them, of course, but the ones—and I’ve known many—who linger in your memory. It’s hard to pin down, but I think it has to be related to their instinctive understanding of the aesthetics of pleasure. (The sad Anglo-Saxon concept of a “guilty pleasure” is incomprehensible to the French mind. If something gives you pleasure—whether it’s a cigarette, an affair, or an extravagant little quelque chose from Hermès—how would guilt fit into the equation?) Faire plaisir, to give pleasure, whether to oneself or to others, is so deeply embedded in the French cultural DNA and in the idea of la civilisation française that it can’t help but permeate every aspect of their lives.\n\nFaire plaisir is about knowing which Burgundy to use when cooking boeuf en daube and which to serve with it; it’s wearing perfume even if you’re home alone; it’s finding precisely the right white-silk shirt to go with narrow black jeans and Roger Vivier flats; it’s flirting without seeming to and knowing what to withhold and what to reveal. It’s the nonchalant way Anouk Aimée flips back her hair while walking on the beach with Jean-Louis Trintignant in A Man and a Woman, the way Carla Bruni wears Dior couture and records a song that, rumor has it, describes her husband, the president of La République, as “my drug.” It’s pouring yourself a glass of Veuve Clicquot while making dinner for your children, knowing where to find the best bûche de Noël in all of Paris; it’s Catherine Deneuve in Belle de Jour, dressed in impeccable Yves Saint Laurent, working as a hooker. It’s about luxe and calme mixed with just the right amount of volupté. And the worst of it is that French women seem to do all of this with an ineffable assurance which the rest of us can only dream of emulating but never perfecting. No wonder they drive us—and men—mad.\n\nLast summer, I happened to pick up a book called La Seduction, by the New York Times Paris correspondent Elaine Sciolino, and in among interviews with everyone from ex-president Jacques Chirac to Carla and her husband, Bernard-Henri Lévy, a pleasure-loving public intellectual (how very French!), to the impossibly stylish Inès de la Fressange and legendary chef Guy Savoy, I came across some intriguing statistics. Did you know that the Ipsos polling agency found out that ninety-one percent of French women and eighty-three percent of French men believe that lingerie is an important part of life? And that French women spend twenty percent of their clothing budget on these “important” scraps of fabric? I certainly didn’t. Tiens, alors! Maybe they’re onto something. And maybe the reason French women appear so irritatingly bien dans sa peau is that they happen to be wearing silk and lace next to that same soft, perfumed peau. And maybe I needed to take a trip to Paris and poke around in the nether regions of the inscrutable French psyche to try and find out why they are so obsessed with these insanely expensive, flimsy confections that will always remain hidden from the outside world.\n\nInside Carine Gilson’s boudoir-like boutique on the rue de Grenelle—twinkling chandeliers, creamy roses, touches of gold leaf, a white chaise longue—ethereal silk panties, bustiers, garter belts, slips, and bras seem to float in the air, barely attached to their padded satin hangers. I felt that if I so much as breathed on these blush-pink, café-au-lait, pale-yellow, and eau-de-nil enchantments—the same colors as the macaroons I’d seen that morning in the window of Ladurée—they would have fluttered, in slow motion, to the polished parquet floor. According to the other Carine (that would be Madame Roitfeld, the ex-editor of French Vogue), the Carine who was seated beside me on a dove-gray chair makes “the most refined lingerie in the world.” She uses silk from Lyon manufactured in a mill that Hermès also uses, lace from Chantilly, and seamstresses who sew each piece by hand in Gilson’s own atelier in Brussels. And should you feel the need, or desire, for “couture” underwear, everything can be made sur mesure as well. “I am absolutely fanatical about quality,” she says. No kidding.\n\nThe interesting thing about Carine Gilson’s designs is that although they are undeniably sexy and unashamedly erotic, they still manage to be the absolute antithesis of vulgarity. While some of the lingerie designers I met in Paris came dangerously close to crossing that dividing line—their more “exotic” pieces (a few in black leather, others with slits in certain places) seemed aimed at the heavy-breathing brigade—Carine inhabits another world entirely. A world where seduction is a subtle game played with wit, refinement, and panache, and always in whispers. The same magical world of elegant, and utterly French, eroticism that Fragonard conjured up so beautifully in his painting of the laughing girl on a swing who soars high up above her aristocratic admirer, allowing him—and us—a tantalizing glimpse of her frothy-white lace petticoats, the tops of her stockings, and most exciting of all, her pretty little foot as her pink satin slipper flies off into the air. It’s an image that was reprised by Toulouse-Lautrec when he portrayed working girls dancing the cancan in the altogether more raucous setting of the music halls of nineteenth-century Paris. Just allow men a fleeting peek under our skirts—it’s not new, it’s not complicated, but it still seems to work every time.\n\nA tantalizing tour of where to buy the best unmentionables Paris has to offer, inlcuding Fifi Chachnil, Le Bon Marché, and Princesse Tam Tam\n\nread more\n\nThat night I had dinner with some old friends in their apartment on Île de la Cité and found myself sitting next to a slightly wild-eyed photographer called Jean-Luc. Ever mindful of my journalistic mission, I quickly turned the conversation to what women wear when they take their clothes off—a subject he was more than eager to talk about. In fact, he never stopped.\n\n“It is all about anticipation and temptation, even before she undresses. I love imagining what she is wearing, something the rest of the world isn’t allowed to see. It is only for me—at least for that night. Beautiful lingerie is about the ornamentation of the object of desire, it’s about hiding and revealing and delaying the moment of truth.” He took a slurp of Sancerre and then set off on a meander down memory lane, back to the 1960s, “That was an extremely disturbing time for men. Stockings and garter belts disappeared—and with them that delicious little expanse of naked flesh at the top of a woman’s thigh—to be replaced by those abominable panty hose.” I nodded, full of sympathy. “But then the miniskirt arrived, so we were happy again!” What relief! On a practical and intellectual level, he understood that his two favorite treats couldn’t possibly be combined in one outfit—unless he restricted himself to dating the women who strut around the Bois de Boulogne after dark—but I could tell that he still wished they somehow could.\n\n“But you are from America, and I must ask you one question. Why do you put your breasts in these awful boîtes aux oeufs [egg cartons]?” It seemed that monsieur had had an unfortunate encounter with a lady in New York who was wearing one of those pre-formed, bulletproof bras from the Gap and, even worse, when he’d just about recovered from the shock, he’d been confronted by the abominable, impenetrable panty hose. The poor man was genuinely perplexed. It was beyond his comprehension why such a woman—“She was so beautiful, so soigné, so charming”—could have neglected this vital part of her wardrobe. Maybe she just liked feeling comfortable, I suggested, feebly. “Comfortable?” He snorted. “Is comfort more important than beauty and seduction?” Clearly not for a Frenchman.\n\nOr, I later discovered, not for at least one American man—André Leon Talley of Vogue, who, echoing Jean-Luc, told me, “Women in France approach style differently on every level. There is a reason they still wear garters and stockings. It’s because they suggest an interior life, a life of passion, love, and romance. Panty hose are a modern, utilitarian, quick-step method to dressing.”\n\nOver coffee and petits fours after dinner that same evening, I was introduced to a woman named Colette. Full of sparkle and with dark, glossy hair, she could have been any age between forty-nine and fifty-nine, and quite naturally I had to ask her what she was wearing under her cashmere sweater and perfectly fitted faded jeans. “Sabbia Rosa. Toujours Sabbia Rosa. I’ve been going there since she opened her shop more than thirty years ago.” We agreed to meet for lunch at a café the next day and then drop by Madame Rosa’s emporium of earthly delights.\n\nColette was waiting for me, seated at a round marble-topped table, chatting with one of the elderly waiters, clearly an old friend. “I always have the sandwich jambon here—the ham is from the Auvergne and the bread from Poilâne, the best baker in Paris, just down the street.” And who was I to disagree? Two ham sandwiches, two glasses of red wine, a pot of Dijon mustard, and we were on our way.\n\n“My addiction to Sabbia Rosa started when I was about thirty-five,” Colette told me. “Before that, I didn’t care so much. When you’re young and pretty you can get away with anything. In those days, none of my lingerie had as much success as forgetting to wear any at all,” she said, laughing. “But as you get older you have to pay more attention, take better care of yourself.” And like almost all the women I talked with in Paris, she wore beautiful lingerie mainly to please herself. “It just makes me feel good. But if it also pleases a man, tant mieux—all the better!”\n\nAn emerald-green satin bra trimmed with creamy Chantilly lace, a citrine satin bustier, flirty little ruby-red panties tied with bows at the side, gauzy sapphire-blue chemises—the softly lit window at Sabbia Rosa sparkled like an open jewel box, casting its seductive glow onto the gray, drizzly street. Inside, Sabbia was bustling about, helping an unseen, presumably unclothed, customer in one of the changing rooms compile a suitably seductive trousseau for her upcoming wedding.\n\n“Please look at this,” Sabbia said, holding out a lacy, floor-length, totally transparent, champagne-colored garment. “Think how beautiful this would look over a wedding dress”—then she lowered her voice to a whisper—“and even more beautiful later with nothing underneath.”\n\nAnd why, I asked Sabbia after her last customer had left and we were sitting down alone together, did she think that the exquisite things she designed and sold played such an important role in the French psyche?\n\n“It has always been part of our history and our culture,” she explained. “You have to remember that there is no Puritan tradition in France. We are Catholic, and the most wonderful thing about that religion is the concept of confession. You sin, you confess, and then . . . you sin again!” And who would ever wish to spoil life’s carnival of pleasures with pointless self-flagellation?\n\nThe word caché means hidden—in the sense that lingerie conceals, and reveals, at the same time; and also in the sense of a separate, secret life hidden from the world. For André Leon Talley, stockings and garters immediately suggest an interior life of romance and passion, and for Proust the idea of caché is summed up in his descriptions of Swann’s mistress, Odette, a courtesan who necessarily receives her gentlemen callers at home in her softly furnished, perfumed interior world: “The culminating point of her day was not when she dressed for the world, but when she undressed for a man.”\n\nCaché is also how Poupie Cadolle’s customers from the Persian Gulf spend most of their lives, except that under their shapeless burkas they are wearing the kind of underwear calculated to keep a man extremely happy. “These women have to be dedicated to pleasing their husbands,” Madame Cadolle said as she showed me around her atelier on the rue St-Honoré. A cheerful woman in her mid-sixties, with bottle-blond hair and a reassuringly ample figure, she is the fifth generation of her family to run the business, and although she has a small boutique around the corner on the rue Cambon, most of her work is couture. “The Russians and the Arabs, they are the most extravagant. The French are the most demanding—they will spend half an hour just choosing the lace trimming for a bra.” And the Americans? Like Sabbia Rosa and Jean-Luc, she was clearly baffled by their peculiar customs.\n\n“It’s taken me twenty years to understand what American women mean by ‘special occasions.’ They tell me that they have two sets of underwear: plain for everyday and a few prettier pieces for these strange special occasions. Incredible.” And if American women are odd, the men are even odder. “They sit in that chair, hidden behind the Herald Tribune, with zero interest in what their wives are choosing. And by the way, they always go for the most conservative designs—nude silk with hardly any lace. Then when it comes time to pay, it is the woman who produces her credit card! Can you imagine?”\n\nNot surprisingly, by contrast, “French men are connoisseurs. They understand quality, they love transparence and a well-fitted bustier—a pretty little cage for the breasts. And it is quite impossible to keep them sitting down. They jump up from the chair, wanting to look inside the changing room. Sometimes I have to be quite strict and tell them to please be patient.” And of course they always pay.\n\nLike my new friend Colette, Poupie agreed that as women get older and the flesh gets weaker, not to mention saggier, it is more important than ever to prop it up, push it out, squeeze it in, and wrap it up in distracting silk, ribbons, lace, and bows—something that Sophia Loren (at age sixty!) demonstrated quite alluringly in Robert Altman’s movie Prêt-à-Porter. Who can forget the scene where she entertains a pleasantly surprised Marcello Mastroianni in his bedroom, dressed in a taille de guêpe (wasp waist) black corset, stockings, and garter belt? (According to André Leon Talley, this wasn’t something the costume designers dreamed up; Sophia actually used to have her own corsets and waist cinchers made to measure at Dior.)\n\nAfter I said good-bye to Madame Cadolle, I decided to have a quick look inside her boutique around the corner and maybe, rather daringly, actually try on a few of her creations. I examined the rows of (mostly black, some white, the rest mainly red and purple) lingerie displayed inside the small, dimly lit space. A headless mannequin wearing a black bra that consisted of spaghetti straps, underwire, and not much else—in fact, nothing else—hung on the wall above the middle-aged woman who was standing behind the counter. Madame smiled, a bit wearily, and explained to me that only men—never women—bought this particular item. You don’t say.\n\nFinally, I chose a black lace bra just slightly less skimpy than the one on the wall, a black net thong with two saucy swansdown puffs hanging from ribbons on each side, and a see-through black-chiffon baby-doll cover-up. And then I disappeared into the changing room. Oh, dear. I’d been after the Sophia Loren effect but somehow ended up looking more like a desperate Sopranos housewife from New Jersey frantically trying to lure her faithless husband back into the marital boudoir. Even the addition of a pair of high-heeled mules, decorated with more swansdown puffs—Madame told me they matched the thong—did nothing to save the situation.\n\nTo cheer myself up, I set off down the rue St-Honoré in search of something sweet and soothing and soon found it in the form of a cylinder of deep, dark chocolate filled with crème anglaise that the girl in the pâtisserie told me was called le puits d’amour, the well of love. Mon Dieu, do they think of nothing else? I’d escaped from one well of love—or sex—and now here I was sinking into another. But at least this one made me feel better.\n\nA couple of blocks farther on, I stopped in front of a window full of confections every bit as sugary and spicy and decidedly nice as anything a master pâtissier could concoct. The late-nineteenth-century facade was covered in white-plaster rococo roses, bows, and swags of flowers—just like an over-the-top wedding cake. And inside it was all pink and cream, silk and satin, with sweet nothings dancing on padded hangers and displayed inside shocking-pink Lucite showcases. Chantal Thomass has been called the High Priestess of Lingerie, and dressed entirely in form-fitting black, with a Louise Brooks bob and bright-red lips, she had a sexy severity that would have suited the leader of an extremely chic cult. And a cult is just what she—and her designs—have become.\n\n“You know, when I was starting out thirty-four years ago, it was impossible to find manufacturers who knew how to work with the fine silks from Lyon and delicate lace from Calais that I use, so I contacted a company specializing in making lingerie for ladies of petite vertu [easy virtue], which turned out to be perfect.”\n\nBut now everything has changed: The manufacturers have got their act together, and women are thrilled to play the role of high-class ladies of the night—at least when they undress.\n\nAs I headed toward the door, I stopped, unable to resist taking a closer look at an exquisite black-silk bustier, laced up the back, that only Scarlett O’Hara (after a serious bout of bulimia) could possibly have fit into. But looking wasn’t enough; I needed to touch it and suddenly discovered that—oh no, oh yes—it was actually made of kidskin. And if that wasn’t guaranteed to take care of whatever vestiges of virtue a girl might still possess, I’m not sure what would.\n\nOn my last night, I had dinner alone, sitting at the bar of Joël Robuchon’s restaurant in the Hôtel Pont Royal. And there I met an American journalist who had been living in Paris for most of his life. “The thing about the French,” he told me, “is that they are just better at pleasure than we are.” The other thing, he added, is that Frenchmen understand, and appreciate, that plaisir comes in all shapes and sizes—and ages.\n\nThe moment he said that, I remembered a story Madame Cadolle had told me about one of her customers, a gentleman of a certain age who had been coming to her atelier regularly for almost forty years to have lingerie made for the ladies in his life. Faithful in his fashion, he always bought three identical sets: one for his (full-figured) wife and a set for each of his mistresses. According to Poupie, one of them was “très petite” and the other extremely tall and big-boned—“Ooh la la, she must have been an Amazon.” Except she wasn’t. A couple of months ago, when he’d appeared for his usual shopping spree, he finally—and quite happily—volunteered the truth. The Amazonian set was for him. “Chacun à son goût,” Madame had said to me, smiling."
