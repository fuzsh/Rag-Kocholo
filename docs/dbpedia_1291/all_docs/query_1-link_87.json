        "text": "Soon after the workshop’s founding, war and resistance force Lucien’s wife, Marie-Louise, to take the reins. Loved, respected, and unrepentantly hard-working, she uses her acumen and skill to forge close relationships with the tanners and taweries that supply her. Under her direction, orders for gloves begin to multiply. She builted the iconic bulding factory in the heart of Saint-Junien. It is at this moment that Agnelle makes its ascent.\n\nMarie-Louise’s daughter, Josie Le Royer, a vivacious seductress gifted with a creative and pragmatic bent, continues to innovate and pushes to expand Agnelle’s reach. Paris is her grand ambition. She gathers together the houses of haute couture – Christian Dior, Yves Saint Laurent, Landin…as well as the young creators Alaïa, Jean-Paul Gaultier, Thierry Mugler, Claude Montana, Jean-Charles de Castelbajac, Emanuel Ungaro, Christian Lacroix... Agnelle become the expert in gloves, a cristalization of savoir-faire and creativity, melds with luxury. At the same time, she opens up the market and offers, with her typical good sense, a more affordable line.\n\nJosie’s daughter, Sophie Grégoire begins her education in 1986 at the very heart of the label’s operations. Intuitive and committed to social justice, she proves as audacious as her forebears. While still maintaining the traditional artistry of her predecessors, which still results in products that transcend the demands of the high fashion labels with their delicateness and sensitivity, Sophie Grégoire opens a workshop in the Phillipines in 1988. The employees of this new workshop are trained by the artisans of Saint-Junien themselves. In adherence to the standards and quality of their Saint-Junien counterparts, their fine leather still comes from French tanneries and taweries.\n\nPurchased by American glovemaker Well Lamont in 1999, Agnelle is ultimately reacquired by Sophie Grégoire in 2001 and brought back into the family. Sophie brings her own ambition to Agnelle: an ambition to hone the science and art of glove design and manufacture and adapt it to contemporary fashion and technological advances in materials, all while fashioning her own distinct Agnelle label. Her persistence is rewarded: in 2010 she receives the Business Woman Veuve Clicquot Award; in 2011, she is a made a knight in the French National Order of the Legion of Honour; and in 2012, the Grand Prix KBL Richelieu de l’Entrepreneur de Valeurs.\n\nFounded in Saint-Junien, the glove shop on the Avenue de la République was built in 1955 by Marie-Louise Pourrichou.\n\nThe glove shop remains in Saint-Junien to this date, upholding the label’s original expertise and craftsmanship.\n\nIn order to preserve the traditional techniques of glove-making, Agnelle establishes a production unit in the Phillipines.\n\nUnder the direction of Saint-Junien and its workshops, this production unit has allowed for the safekeeping of techniques and arts threatened with disappearing through the transmission of old techniques while offering affordable.\n\nAgnelle works closely with the great fashion houses and ready to wear labels: Christian Dior, Balenciaga, Alaïa, Roger Vivier, Ralph Lauren, Lanvin, Marc Jacobs, Givenchy, Christopher Kane, Oscar de la Renta, Proenza Schouler, among others.\n\nThese collections adhere to the high standards of the Laboratoire des Matières and attest to the excellence of their craftsmanship and dynamic artistry, a bearer of history steered towards innovation.\n\nTwo years after her arrival at the head of the business, Sophie Grégoire proves visionary and opens a workshop in the Phillipines, while training employees in Saint-Junien.\n\nAgnelle begins work for Maud Luzon, Chevignon and Agnès B. This same year, Agnelle opens stands in the Galeries Lafayette and at Le Bon Marché.\n\nMarc Jacobs and Zilli will in turn join the list of houses working with Agnelle. Followed by Loewe, Celine and Lanvin. APC and Lacoste were added to the impressive catalogue of fashion collaborations.\n\nIn 2008, Agnelle exported its know-how to the United States, where Marc Jacobs, Rodarte, Ralph Lauren, Rag and Bone and Rick Owens joined the repertoire of companies working with Agnelle.\n\nIn 2013, Sophie Gregoire was awarded the Insignia of Chevalier in the National Order of the Legion of Honour.\n\nAgnelle signs a long series of collaborations with the younger generation: Anthony Vacarello, today artistic director of the House of Yves Saint Laurent, Johanna Senyk, winner of the Grand Prix de l'Adam with her brand Wanda Nylon, the illustrator from DEDE creating unique pieces by drawing on the gloves, and finally Louis-Gabriel Nouchi, finalist of the Prix d'Hyeres and a former student of La Cambre."
