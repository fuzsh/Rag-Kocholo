Her publications include articles on poetry, cinema, and adaptation; on the intersecting history of French perfume, medical writing, and fiction; and on theories and methods of language teaching. She is particularly interested in how language, film, literature, and culture interact and inform one-another. Her first book, The Art of Procrastination: Baudelaire’s Poetry in Prose (University of Delaware Press, 2007) explores how Baudelaire's prose poems tell (human/modern/literary) time, and how time and narrative tell the story of the experimental poème en prose genre and its poetics. She later edited the volume Approaches to Teaching Baudelaire’s Prose Poems (MLA Approaches to Teaching World Literature Series, 2017), where her article on flânerie shows twenty-first century digital rovers and nineteenth-century urban strollers crossing paths in the classroom and beyond. Professor Krueger has co-authored several books related to language learning through the discovery of literature, film, visual arts, and culture, including Mise en scène: Cinéma et Lecture (Pearson, 2006), Tâches d’encre (Cengage, 2017), and Perspectives on Teaching Language and Content (Yale UP, 2020). Her latest book, Perfume on the Page in Nineteenth-Century France (University of Toronto Press, 2023) examines a convergence of literature, medical writing, fashion, and social practices during the rise of modern French perfume culture. Her current research focuses on how artists and writers interacted with hypnotists, mediums, past-life regression, and spirit photography in fin-de-siècle France.\n\nAs a specialist in nineteenth-century studies who also worked many years as Language Program Director, Professor Krueger has always devoted much of her career to mentorship in teaching and research. She has directed graduate and undergraduate research on flânerie, women readers, women's fashion magazines, fiction, poetry, cinema, biography, and autobiography. Dedicated to helping students find their voices as writers and thinkers, Professor Krueger regularly designs new courses inspired by discussions with her students. She encourages students to nurture their individual talents through creative and multimedia projects that relate course material to interests outside the classroom. She has incorporated a great deal of technology in teaching, particularly in Hitchcock, Truffaut, and the French New Wave and Introduction to French CInema, which culminate in individual short film projects. Yet recently she has been drawn to “slow education,” allowing more time to engage with course materials in depth and making room for hand-written journals in courses that earn unofficial titles like “Slow Bovary.” As Director of the Undergraduate Program, she was able to consult with students reguarly to get their input on course offerings, events, and initiatives. She worked with undergraduate representatives to launch the department's first a peer-tutoring program and invited alumni speakers to network and discuss how French studies shaped their career paths.\n\nProfessor Krueger has also served as Director of Graduate Studies and Department Chair. Beyond UVA, she has held elected positions as AAUSC French section head and a member of the MLA Executive Committee Nineteenth-Century French Literature Division. She was Editor of the UK-based journal Dix-Neuf, where she is now a member of the Editorial Board. She explores her interests in olfaction, perfume, and miasmas as a research associate for l’Osmothèque, conservatoire des parfums and a member of the Odeuropa PastScent network.\n\nResearch Interests\n\nNineteenth-Century French literature and culture; the senses; olfaction; perfume and miasma; medical discourse and narrative fiction; material cutlure and literary production; French cinema and adaptation\n\nRepresentative Publications\n\nBooks\n\nPerfume on the Page in Nineteenth-Century France (University of Toronto Press, 2023)\n\nPerspectives on Teaching Language and Content.
