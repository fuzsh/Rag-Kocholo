        "text": "my flight has no wi-fi so it’s a great time to write you a letter processing some of my thoughts and ideas\n\ni realize from the symposium and josephine’s and josephine the importance of starting things and trying things and inventing and failing and trying again\n\nand in many ways this process of having a bookshop which is really just the process of starting and having an institution is so important so one can have a place to design, build, fail, innovate, engineer, share safely—like a science lab\n\nnot that individuals don’t have voices of course, but that when i was outside on the corner of broad and cecil b moore selling books or in front of the university of the arts selling books, very few saw that as noteworthy or important. no news articles lol\n\nsimilarly when i was a school teacher, working daily with youth who were called dropouts, using art and culture as a tool to get them to come to school and work on their GEDs, it went virtually unnoticed\n\nsame thing when i was living in an abandoned house trying to finish my degree with a small child\n\nbut i believe it was in the process of starting and maintaining an institution, a lab, that i found the confidence to speak in rooms that one i never knew existed or two assumed i had no place in and/or three i wasn’t invited to\n\nwhen i was selling books on the corner i was innovating—i created a place of beauty and community on a corner and sold books, sometimes more books than i sell at harriett’s or ida’s in a day, but also gave folk an open air place to congregate and chat and connect\n\nwhen i was helping young people pass their GEDs by sitting with them in the hospital after they’d been drugged, or standing on tables teaching them about ntzoke shange, or hosting community dinners so i knew they ate dinner, or creating a citywide amazing race so they could see their city, or creating an entrepreneurial incubator and giving them seed money to fund their ideas, i was engineering, thinking about what pieces were missing, connecting nontraditional dots, designing and failing and redesigning—but who cared?\n\nwhen i was writing the human rights curriculum for DC public schools and or conflict resolution curriculum for violence prevention, or racial reckoning curriculum for youth across the globe, i was just engineering —ideating, designing, implementing, failing, redesigning, rebuilding, over and over again…\n\nbut my own institution—untethered by the limitations imposed by predominately colonial-minded leadership, not having to beg to realize my ideas, accelerated my ability to ideate and enact with speed.\n\ni see this also in my other friends and colleagues who’ve had the experience of being able to start and run their own institutions and how much more social impact they’ve had not being under the boot of antiquated practices, antiquated leadership, antiquated belief systems, that tend to dominate many institutions and old regimes—even those who hire a DEI person or host an anti-racist training, change in those spaces is VERY difficult because the issues are built into the system, the design flaw is a part of the actual machine, it’s in the engine and to redesign those institutions would mean having to take them a part completely\n\nwithout the boot of the old regime on your neck, without the overseer watching, it’s easier to design and build and fail and redesign and rebuild at your own pace. that’s what allows one to follow their gut and play the game of what if… what if there was a bookshop that was also kinda like a monument and kinda like art gallery? what if instead of one brick and mortar we had two?? what if instead of brick and mortars we starting having literary art installations? what if universities made us their school bookstore? what if we set forth legislation to make the first federal holiday named for a woman? what if we all existed locally and globally? what if we took people who never left their neighborhoods out of the country on book trips? what if large institutions “adopted” smaller ones? what if Paris? what if Nairobi? what if we’ve been thinking too small? what if we’ve been living our entire lives in a cage (either self imposed or socially imposed) and what if we just got out?\n\nside note —no one bats an eye that amazon is a global institution, tesla is global, coca cola, kfc, mcdonald’s -global—but it’s like mind blowing when someone who looks like me or someone who comes from where i come from (the projects) creates work that’s global.\n\nlike i said to you earlier, i don’t want it to be shocking to see Blk girls from North Philly, Phillying up Paris, or Phillying up Nairobi, or Phillying up Mexico City, nor vice versa. i don’t want us waiting and waiting to see the world (and for the world to have to wait to see us) —that’s what Jo did, she allowed herself to be seen and heard —she opened that door so long ago —i’m sure she’s like just fly already\n\nso i flew—overnight—for 3 days—i’ve never hosted a symposium, i didn’t fully know all that it takes, but what if we designed one and built one and failed and redesigned and rebuilt it until we got it to look like how we wanted it to look and feel how we wanted it to feel and what if there were more spaces for that in the world\n\nbecause my professor, took that on with me as a project that i believe transformed us both and i don’t know if when i was in his class he could ever imagine all that would unfold from that brief interaction where he pushed me so hard as a writer and took me to gardens and made me read and excavate and analyze and write write write (i wrote an unpublished book in that class) that in a years time we’d be making history together at AUP, a university that has NEVER hosted a symposium dedicated to a woman who looks like you and has NEVER celebrated Blk women scholars, Blk women performers, Blk women media makers, and thinkers in this way—NEVER.\n\nAnd did we fail at somethings?\n\ndefinitely, the food (or lack there of was a total failure), but then i met jenea a Blk woman pastry chef who attended and agreed to cook next year, the bookshop lacking in books (which i tried to ship from the U.S. for hundreds of dollars and they still didn’t arrive in time was a failure—books across borders is hard hard hard)—i literally brought books in my carry on and clothes in my book bag—so now i know i need a european distributor and more used and rare more books\n\ntech failures, time failures, financial failures —at one point i couldn’t pay for my taxi cause my card wouldn’t work, me with these stupid fevers that i keep getting—health failure, but who said we can’t fail? what’s this silly insistence on Blk excellence or bust that weighs folk down and makes it hard to invent and innovate because fear of failure keeps folk from beginning or finishing asking or taking risks\n\ntech ventures get to fail all the time with millions of dollars of investment on the table, movies fail with million dollar budgets, governments fail everyday—don’t even get me started on the failures of the child welfare system, the health care system, the prison system, the mental health system, the education system…and they be failing with our money, then turn around and take more\n\nwhere is that grace for the social engineer? the small business innovator? the activists? the organizers? the educators? the artists?\n\nbecause after failure, if we do it right, there is the redesign, the rebuild, the retry\n\nso for our first time, i thought it was an awesome experience, i loved seeing the young folk physically build the shop in paris—40 minutes before the symposium was set to begin—because that’s when everything arrived, that’s who built harriett’s with me outside on the corner during the height of covid, thats who attended the protests with me and gave out books, that’s who sustains the work, it’s glorious to co-create with young minds who are full of energy.\n\ni loved seeing my friends, like Brian, present in an academic setting, though he’s used to giving tours and cabarets\n\ni loved having our matriarch, ms. sylvia come after 40 years of researching and writing and still she’s passing on history to young minds—40 years of dedication to sharing these stories about Blk women and Blk history, how could we ever repay her—all she wants is an english translation of her book\n\ni loved having josephine baker’s daughter, Marianne next to me, saying how much she missed her mother, how loving she was, how many people get her mother wrong, how she’d come back every year if we’d keep hosting—build the bookshop she insisted to me in a heavy french accent\n\nor young folk like Nia James presenting to other young folk like yo here’s an experimental thing i made where i let AI create a convo between Josephine Baker and James Baldwin—what do you think? and having folks question that and congratulate that\n\nand having a dancer in the middle of a symposium, Bakering all over people to live music\n\nor having a lifestyle fashionista say—here’s Baker as a Lifestyle—it’s ok to be Baker-esque—use the good plates, be your full self, enjoy the quality, take your time, connect at the boulangerie\n\nor having a scholar share where she wants to take her Baker research next\n\nhaving Blk music and Blk tradition take up space in places where we are typically told to keep quiet, be perfect, look but don’t touch, sit still, don’t disrupt, don’t make waves\n\nand then dinner with my french friends and expat friends and american friends and students and graduates\n\nthere were many parts of the design that worked and many parts that get to be reworked but in all, i feel the path with no beginning is worth beginning and like i’ve said to the great mothers—i’ll do my part and i trust they will do theirs—and they always do\n\nso glad you get to have paris and all these beautiful connections for your 50th birthday\n\nwith love\n\njeannine\n\nDear Collingswood Friends & Families—\n\nI am Jeannine A. Cook, the shopkeeper of Ida’s Bookshop at 734 Haddon Ave.\n\nOur bookshop celebrates women authors, artists, and activists under the guiding light of historic heroine, Ida B. Wells.\n\nMs. Ida was a turn-of-the-century author, artist, and activist who worked tirelessly on issues of community development—specifically focusing her career on ending lynching with the power of her pen.\n\nInspired by Ms. Ida, I write this letter to you with the power of my pen.\n\nOur shop has existed in Collingswood for three years this coming February and served thousands of books to local, national and even international families and friends from the Farmer’s Market to Clover Fest from Mayfair to the Book Fest—where I actually showed up on a horse to interview a horse jockey.\n\nNow in our third year and with increased pressure on small businesses, especially bookshops, we recognize that innovation is crucial for our continued existence.\n\nIn contrast to large corporations, small businesses contribute to the social fabric of communities, providing unique goods, services, and experiences while promoting self-sufficiency.\n\nWe even had a realtor bring a new family by to ensure them, “Ida’s Bookshop is just another example of sacred spaces that make starting a life in Collingswood special.”\n\nEmbracing our position as a local bookshop we ensure:\n\nthat books have a viable future in the lives of children like those we host on field trips and Mommy and Me visits;\n\nwealth circulates within the community as we hire local young people to operate the shops—including Aunye, Maya, Elijah, Brianna, Keiko, Serenity, Messiah, Jenesis and Asia;\n\nand we continue donations to local organizations like BookSmiles that deliver free books to children;\n\nhosting local and national authors like Jo Piazzo, Mecca Jamilah Sullivan, Sannii Crespina-flores, Christine Pride, Zach Wright, Shawn R. Jones, Anita Grace Brown, Seve Torres and Salamishah Tillet to name a few;\n\nhosting musicians from vibraphone to violin, literacy bands and djs to songbirds and drummers, choirs, a keyboard playing harmonica player who was only 17.\n\nThis pursuit of the “independent” in independent bookshop is not merely a financial endeavor but a means to choose how we want to strengthen the social fabric.\n\nSmall businesses often face an uphill battle against corporate giants and multi-million dollar developers, grappling with challenges like limited resources and intense competition. The struggle for survival and growth is not just economic but also a fight to preserve the uniqueness and character of local communities.\n\nTo address this issue, we started a bootstrapped crowdfunding campaign and event series called “Raise The Rent.” In response to our landlord’s decision to Raise the Rent, we are seeking $23,000 in community investment to pay the rent upfront for a year so we can strategize and plan a sustained future for Ida’s Bookshop within Collingswood without the additional stressors of making ends meet from month to month—our overall goal is to purchase a building in Collingswood and stick around for generations.\n\nQuiet as it’s kept, we have our eye on 566 Haddon Ave. but we’ve only just had initial conversations about what that could look like and what that journey would entail—but imagine a wellness center meets a bookshop cafe.\n\nMaybe??\n\nWhat we do see for sure is a future where collaboration between organizations and institutions will create sustainability. Remember we do this work in the face of book bans and a future that promises one or two large corporations could someday control the production and distribution of almost all books if we don’t decide otherwise now.\n\nIn parallels between book bans, economic injustice and historical lynching, it is essential to recognize the profound impact of both on intellectual freedom and human rights, echoing the sentiments of Ida B. Wells in her anti-lynching advocacy.\n\nJust as lynching was a violent tool used to suppress and control, book bans and bookshop closings operate as a subtle but equally insidious form of intellectual oppression. Both mechanisms aim to stifle dissent, erase perspectives, and maintain a status quo that perpetuates harm.\n\nIda B. Wells, through her courageous anti-lynching work, understood the power of knowledge in dismantling systemic oppression. Similarly, book bans restrict access to diverse narratives, limiting the ability to challenge prevailing ideologies. By acknowledging the parallel between these forms of oppression, we highlight the importance of preserving intellectual freedom and honoring the legacy of pioneers like Ida B. Wells who fought against such injustices.\n\nAnother analogy we see in our work is the parallel between renting and sharecropping. In the fundamental absence of ownership and control, we see the vulnerability that individuals face in these arrangements.\n\nIn both scenarios, tenants and sharecroppers lack true ownership of the land or property they inhabit. This absence of ownership translates into a limited ability to shape our destinies, make long-term investments, or build generational relationships. The control over crucial decisions often rests in the hands of landlords or landowners who often could care less about the daily goings on of the community where their tenants “work the land,” mirroring the power dynamics prevalent in sharecropping arrangements.\n\nEmphasizing this analogy is crucial in shedding light on the challenges faced by business owners without property ownership, underscoring the need for policies and initiatives that empower individuals to move beyond mere occupancy to ownership. By doing so, we address the root issues associated with both renting and sharecropping, advocating for a shift toward more equitable and empowering long term business development strategy.\n\nIn contrast to renting or sharecropping, owning a building in Collingswood provides a sense of permanence for Ida’s. It opens avenues for us to build generational relationships and foster economic stability that transcends immediate circumstances. Land ownership enables us to make long-term investments, engage in sustainable environmental practices, and establish a strong foundation.\n\nThis is why we are hosting design sessions that ask not just what your local bookshop can do for you, but also what you are can commit to doing for your local bookshop—from volunteering to landscaping from deliveries to authors chats, how do we sustain this institution together? Are you a contractor? A banker? A marketing guru? We need you.\n\nAt its core, community organizing brings people together, amplifying their collective voice to address shared concerns. Ida B. Wells, through her anti-lynching campaigns, showcased the transformative potential of communities united against injustice. By organizing and mobilizing, communities can effect change at both local and systemic levels.\n\nThis unity not only provides a platform for shared goals but also builds resilience in the face of challenges. Ida B. Wells demonstrated that through organized efforts, communities can challenge oppressive systems, demand justice, and bring about tangible transformation.\n\nCommunity organizing acts as a catalyst, empowering us all to actively participate in shaping our neighborhood’s destiny.\n\nIt is our hope that through this comprehensive approach, drawing on inspiration from our namesake Ida B. Wells, we can be an example of the change we wish to see in the world.\n\nBut like Ida said, “before the people can ACT, they must KNOW.”\n\nNow you know.\n\nThank you,\n\nJeannine A. Cook\n\nIda’s Bookshop\n\ninfo@idasbookshop.com\n\nI want to write about water. I want to write about never having seen it this way. A river that runs through a stage play. A river that characters dive into and emerge from. A river that ebbs with magic and flows with fortune telling, curving through time and space from a pre-Civil Rights era Mendocino County and continuing on at the McCarter Theater in Princeton, New Jersey until October 7th. This river is a requirement from playwright, Eisa Davis, who asks for just a few things in the stage directions of her Pulitzer nominated production, Bulrusher: oranges, apples, live guitar and water.\n\nThe McCarter Theater production of Bulrusher, directed by Nicole A. Watson, delivers on Davis’ requests in abundance, bringing the outside inside in droves. “Watch where you sit,” one women said to another in the lobby. “I heard you might get wet.”\n\n“I’d love to get to splashed,” I joked to myself in response to the 80 degree not-quite-end-of-Summer day.\n\nI had arrived early to watch people enter the theater, most commenting about the set design after pointing and sharing visceral ooohs and ahhs. “Honey, this set is genius,” said the man behind me. “It’s like a starring character,” said his wife. It is multilevel and multimodal, subtle yet complex, water birthed from the deep mind of scenic designer, Lawrence E. Moten III. What we see is the fourth iteration of his vision Moten later tells us in the after show chat. He’s giving us forests, woodlands, grass glades, and wet meadows–welcoming us, then submerging us, and transforming us, then lifting us back up for air. Moten reminds us to respect the healing power of water in all its forms whether it's in a bowl or a bay. If you only go to see the set design of Bulrusher, you will leave refreshed.\n\nHowever if you stay, and of course you should stay, then you get to meet your protagonist, Bulrusher (Jordan Tyson) a waterbearer, a wellspringer, a witch. She is a twist on the trope of the magical negro– very much magical, able to predict people’s futures through the water, but she is very much not any white man’s supportive sidekick–in fact she is the opposite–side kicking a white man all over the stage at one point. Tyson’s performance is crystal clear–she helps us to appreciate our anti-hero’s fish-out-of-waterness, while performing both in and out of the river with ease.\n\nBaby Bulrusher was abandoned in a basket on the very river that flows through the stage–(think Moses, think Romulus, think Sargon). Until the baby floats into the town of Boonville–a real-life place in Northern California with its own customs, and practices, and language–Bootling. Bootling is a local dialect with over 1000 secret words and phrases. It’s a Zora Neale Hurston-seque type play, where language is centered. Your playbill even comes with a translation guide for the “linguistically curious,” though the guide is not necessary to understand the production, it does help us to understand the people on 1950s Boonville.\n\nAll grown up now, but still searching for her source, Bulrusher, meaning belonging to the marsh, spends her time selling oranges and apples and hanging out at a brothel with Madame (Shyla Lefner), Logger (Jeorge Bennett Watson), Boy (Rob Kellogg) and her surrogate father, Schoolch (Jamie Laverdiere). Even among the sparkling ensemble of a cast, in my opinion Watson simply glistens.\n\nBulrusher is the only Black woman in the town of Boonville and she has never seen anyone who looks like her until Vera (Cyndii Johnson) arrives from Alabama as her mirror reflection. Vera is the gravitational force that shifts Bulrusher’s perspective on identity and love and race and family, creating a flood of emotion that challenges Bulrusher's place in the depths of Boonville – for better or worse.\n\nThere is definitely something in the water of Bulrusher. And though I did not get splashed like I wished, I did get baptized. As the theater emptied, I stayed seated to let the poetic prose wash over me. Like the beach, I need to see it again and again and be in it again and again—how could one ever go to the water just once. People all over the world know the incredible healing power of the lakes, the rivers, the oceans and the seas. A mysterious power that deserves to be protected and cherished and studied as there is still so much about water that we don’t understand. And when I finally did step out of the theater, it was raining—of course I was. And I didn’t have an umbrella—of course I didn’t, so I just walked in it. And got soaked by it. And gave thanks for water. Ase.\n\nI walk into Princeton University’s Berlind Theater on Mother’s Day and a painting of Ms. Josephine Baker hangs high above the blue-tinted stage. Ms. Baker never dances out with her long lanky legs and toothy smile, (like one would hope) but her presence is felt through that painting. She is the sun in the sky of the set illuminating the characters (and character flaws) in Pearl Cleage’s, Blues for an Alabama Sky.\n\nThe current production of the story is being directed by Nicole A. Watson with precision and grace. She channels Ms. Baker in her stage direction—creating a dance of methodical movements between actors and audiences.\n\nI am NOT surprised to see the painting of Ms. Josephine Baker. This is the last sign I need. I know folks think I am rude, but I have to do it. I pull out my phone. Turn the light all the way down and search for the contract from Fabienne in my email. I sign it with my finger. Our address will be 5 rue de Médicis if the creek don’t rise. Josephine’s Bookshop in Paris. I’ve done it. I press send. It’s real now, Ms. Josephine. It’s real. I put away my phone and watch the play.\n\nWe can almost hear Ms. Josephine, loud and “laughing like a free woman,” throughout this production which takes place in a 1930s Harlem tenement. She seems to know the answer to the question that all Cleage’s characters are asking–how do free women move? Is there a way out of bondage without running?\n\nYes. Expansion.\n\nThis story begins with Cotton Club singer Angel played by confident and charismatic, Crystal A. Dickinson, having just been fired from her job at a nightclub. Angel is down on her luck and her finances, like most in the throws of the Great Depression. Through Angel we meet her cast of close friends, Delia (Maya Jackson), an activist social worker, who is working with the church to organize a family-planning clinic; Sam (Stephen Conrad Moore), a doctor, who delivers babies at Harlem Hospital, and Guy (Kevin R. Free), Angel’s costume designing friend and caretaker, who is leading the charge for the group to follow Ms. Josephine Baker’s footsteps straight to Paris. “Ce va?”\n\nGuy is my favorite character, even though Kevin R. Free did some stumbling over lines, I think once he finds his flow, he’s going to spit fire into the role which will increase our emotional connection to him and Angel. Kevin R. Free is going to make audiences laugh more and cry more the longer he plays that role. He and Dickinson have great chemistry.\n\nGuy is the narrative’s creative. He is determined to stitch together a plan that gets him and Angel out of living off the scraps of a divested Harlem. His plan is to take his friend to see the glorious City of Lights on Ms. Josephine Baker’s dime, so Guy sleeplessly designs showstopping costumes for Ms. Josephine Baker. He sews while Angel flits about trying to become a singer. Guy’s plan appears to be working until Angel meets Leland Cunningham (Brandon St. Clair), a grieving Southern suitor from Alabama who just may hold the key to Angel’s financial freedom.\n\nWhat did those who became the intellectuals and artists of the Harlem Renaissance gain from migrating away from their lives in the South and heading up North? Folks like my grandfather got freedom from lynch mobs and sharecropping. Yes. But he lost his land rights, right?\n\nLikewise, what did those intellectuals and artists, like Josephine Baker of the Harlem Renaissance gain from leaving the United States for Paris? But also what did they lose? What is the cost of freedom—especially for women?\n\nAngel and Guy sit at the crux of this story about escaping, with differing approaches to how to free themselves from a spiraling social situation.\n\nThe playwright, Pearl Cleage, is many things that I hope to be someday. A novelist, a dramatist, an essayist, and a poet. She was raised in the Black Arts Movement and you can tell. She started telling stories when she was just two years old to her older sister. She’s alive to see her work done and redone time and time again. Blues for an Alabama Sky came into my life at the right moment, Ms. Cleage.\n\nI’m officially off to Paris to build Josephine’s Bookshop this summer and I hope you’ll join me physically or follow along online.\n\nAs you can see, Ms. Josephine Baker is speaking, and continues to remind us to “laugh like free woman.”\n\nHappy Mother’s Day.\n\ndon’t close your eyes\n\ndon’t let them fall\n\ndon’t let them fall or slump slump slump slump\n\ncarry them\n\ncatch them\n\ncatch them\n\ncarry them\n\nstretch them wide and jump jump jump jump\n\nOnce upon a time, in a far off land, Heather met James, James met Heather. James says he sees a light around Heather. They kiss. They marry. They conceive. Heather and James lay an egg—they name their egg Jeannine. And read their egg books by her dear Uncle Jimmy.\n\nThis is a fastforward. Jeannine hatches. She goes to university. “Yay! Jeannine.” Jeannine was supposed to come to France before her graduation, but the airport turned her away. A short finger pointing lady marked Jeannine’s passport with a lime green sticker, looked Jeannine up and down, and waved that finger no.\n\nNo. No. No.\n\n“Don't pee yourself, Jeannine. Don’t pee yourself, Jeannine,” Jeannine hummed under her breath to the tune of the shaking finger.\n\nJeannine’s bladder is a pussy. When it is scared, it runs.\n\nAt gate 53, Jeannine begs her bladder AND the finger pointing lady and the world to let her fly. “Please, please please let me fly,” she says, through her injured beak. “Please.”\n\nThey deny her pleas. Jeannine stands by the window soaking and sulking and watching the others fly by. “Auvoir, Jeannine,” they wave. “Auvoir.”\n\nThis is a flashback, in this flashback, snake ass fancy pants motherfuckers with deep wallets, and large apples and no faces invite Jeannine to apply for a so-called prestigious award that may help her fly. The fancy pants motherfuckers require Jeannine drop out of Drexel University to apply for their prestigious award. But it’s Jeannine’s last semester of her MFA program. The fancy pants award is almost $100,000 –enough to keep her book businesses and feed her baby chicks and pay for the damn MFA. Jeannine tells delightful Nomi, head of MFA, about the prestigious award.\n\nDelightful Nomi says Jeannine, don't be a small bird in a snake's garden.\n\nJeannine—still tempted by the snake with his fancy pants and deep wallet, drinks the nectar from the snake’s morherfucking apple. She compiles all her writings—her essays and articles, columns and stories, poems and prayers. Jeannine flutters through this garden of fancy pants motherfucking snakes and you know what?\n\nof course you know what!\n\nsnakes eat small birds!\n\nSo they opened their mouths and tried to swallow Jeannine whole. “Unfortunately after careful consideration you were not chosen for this fancy pants prestigious award we tempted you into applying for and made you drop out of school for and clipped your wings for.” So no degree. No award. Just a half eaten apple and half broken wings.\n\nAre you sad for Jeannine? Don’t be sad for Jeannine. Remember Jeannine is the protagonist.\n\nIn this story, someone finds wounded Jeannine. Wraps her wings in twine. Sprinkles them with fairy dust.\n\nIn this flashback, Jeannine goes back to school.\n\n“Yay, Jeannine.”\n\nSee Jeannine graduate.\n\nSee Jeannine give graduation speech.\n\nBut, Jeannine still cannot fly.\n\nAll she does is flap her wings.\n\nThis is a dialogue called when James Baldwin is your Uncle Jimmy. Every good story has dialogue, right? Can you say dialogue? Yes. Dialogue. Very good. Here is this story’s dialogue.\n\nRing. Ring. Ring.\n\n“Hey, Uncle Jimmy.”\n\n“Hey Neice. How ya been?“\n\n“Been ok, Uncle Jimmy.”\n\n“What ya been up to?”\n\n“Well Uncle, I Did Kelly, Did Oprah, Did Google, Did Vogue, Did New York Times. PBS. NBC. BBC. just like you said.”\n\n“Uhh huh and…?“\n\n“Hmm. Well I still don’t know how to fly?”\n\n“Flying is simple, Neice. Once you have wings. You use them.”\n\n“Uncle it is anything but easy,” Jeannine’s heart beat at 1260 beats per minute.\n\n“How bout this? You come to my house for the\n\nsummer? I have a bed for you and will teach you everything you need to know to fly.”\n\n“But Uncle Jimmy…”\n\n“We’ll discuss it when you get here, Niece.”\n\nJeannine arrives at the airport a second time and gets on her flight this time. Smiles at the finger pointing lady as she struts to seat 24 F this time. In just a few hours, Jeannine lands in a nest in Nice.\n\nBut Uncle Jimmy is not there they say. Uncle Jimmy is DEAD they say. He’s been dead for sometime. All he’s left behind for Jeannine are his books.\n\n“How can this be? Uncle Jimmy, this cannot be?”\n\nJeannine calls James. No answer.\n\nJeannine calls Heather. No answer.\n\nJeannine calls Nomi. No answer.\n\nJeannine calls those snake ass fancy pants motherfucking snakes. No answer.\n\nJeannine calls Uncle Jimmy. No answer.\n\nThis is a plot twist.\n\nCrying now as Jeannine sometimes does at the end of a story. She perches in a cafe window staring out at the Mediterranean Sea. A wind blows her book open to a note in the margin of the front page. “My dearest Jeannine, Go see Karen Karbo in Catalonia.”\n\nThis is an alliteration.\n\n“There you will find a group on an inexplicable concrete slab. Ask them to repeat after you and then you will fly to Paris.” -Signed Your Uncle Jimmy.\n\nthis is call and response. so please repeat after me.\n\ndon’t close your eyes\n\ndon’t let them fall\n\ndon’t let them fall or slump slump slump slump\n\ncarry them\n\ncatch them\n\ncatch them\n\ncarry them\n\nstretch them wide and jump jump jump jump\n\nAnd so she did.\n\nThis is the end.\n\nJeannine A. Cook\n\nI have so many reading comprehension quirks and grammar fuckedupnesses. I had to get a tutor my first year of college because professors were like, “we know you have something strong to say, but we can’t quite understand it.” Jack would mark my papers so red and read me for filth for all my dash marks. I wouldn’t know where to put commas and semicolons and shit so I’d just put a dash mark everywhere. All this while I just knew deep down I am a writer, I am a writer even if no one understand me. Jack was determined to get me together, which is why you can half way read what I’m writing right now, though I’m sure it’s filled with mistakes. And looking back from notebooks of stories, and endless games of make pretend, and having jazzy read to me by candlelight. From piddling through journalism in high school, and creative writing, and nearly failing AP English because I wanted to write about The Color Purple but I just struggled and struggled with how to take something so epic and synthesize it into small bites. And my teacher would be blown away to know that some day that same student grew up and met Alice Walker and interviewed her and got love from her. I’ve felt home here in this word world even when I didn’t fit in and in some ways still don’t. I know there’s something sacred for me in this space. And I know what stories do to me and for me and for others. I joined a writing group that was very much a support group. I took a class with Toby where we had to read a novel a week and then the next semester a play a week and and write a letter to her each these classes about what we read. I struggled. I’m not great on deadlines. But I lived for this class. It’s why I made it through the semester and why I woke up some mornings. I have pen pals. I write letters to. Some letters I am the Eagles 2022, some letters I am the Eagles 1936. At the same time my comprehension is wavy AF. I see things in texts that are sometimes not there. Or I miss things completely that are obvious. It’s such a contradiction in some ways that I have bookshops because I read very slow and I don’t memorize authors and I categorize in ways that only make sense to me and I have to read some passages over and over and over again for days. My mom, who is the opposite, was irritated with me once because she was like if I have to hear the first chapter of I Know Why The Caged Bird Sings again, Jeannine. And mind you I’m listening to Maya Angelou read it while I read along from the book because you have to hear her voice read and then you can hear it forever in your spirit. Again—because I have issues. Sometimes because I just admire the sheer beauty, sometimes because I am getting 3 or 4 different interpretations—sometimes because I have NO idea what’s being said. Like right now I’m reading a book about wool. Yes wool. I am not great with clocks and time. I’ve always had my head in the clouds. I write like a cloud hopping goose flying from thought to thought. If I could, I’d stop the clocks sometimes and just let folks catch up on all the stories we’ve missed out on. I bet it would help. Nomi said I’ll hold your hand until the day you complete this memoir even if it never comes out to the public. Now that’s love. So yea with all that I’m published here and there. Bookshops here and there. Interviewing authors here and there. Walking Baldwin’s footsteps here and there. Invited to libraries and collections here and there. I even gave the graduation speech when I got my MFA one year later than my cohort. So yes, it’s an understatement, but I do know why the caged bird sings—I think.\n\nC.O.B.S. MAGAZINE: Welcome to Women Innovators. We are elated to have writer, educator, and strategist Jeannine A. Cook. For the last 10 years, Jeannine has worked as a trusted writer for several startups, corporations, non-profits, influencers, and now herself. We will be talking to her about selling books, engaging communities, traveling the world, and her recognition. Can you please give us a little background about your upbringing?\n\nJEANNINE A COOK: I consider myself to be mixed. My mother is from a small island in the Caribbean, Trinidad, and my father is from Brooklyn. When I was small some family referred to us as coconuts and others called us yankees. When I was 4 or 5 we moved to Hampton Virginia from the projects in New York. When I was still in elementary school my mother lost her vision completely and my dad was commuting back and forth working in New York while we lived in Virginia. I think partially the stress of this led to him developing a terminal illness. So both my parents were different abled growing up yet they were both avid readers and thinkers. I call my dad an armchair historian and my mom was a theological scholar—she continued her studies even after she went blind having us read to her and write for her so she could finish. She was also a former educator and librarian. I think their love for books transferred to me and my sisters.\n\nC.O.B.S MAGAZINE: Can you share where your love of books comes from? Can you tell us about Ida’s Bookshop? Where did the name derive from? What kinds of books are you selling? What makes you stand out from other bookshops?\n\nJEANNINE A COOK: I think I answered a bit above. But Ida’s is my second bookstore. We opened officially about 18 months ago. So if she was a baby she’d just be learning to walk and talk. She is named for Ida B. Wells who is a historical heroine who spent most of her life railing against unjust aspects of the legal system and state sanctioned lynching. She was a self taught writer and educator who used the power of her pen to speak to heads of state both here and abroad. Our bookshop’s mission celebrates women authors, artists, and activists but to the exclusion of any one else as we have a wide variety of books and the ability to order in anything. Our bookshop is an immersive experience, you walk in and you’re in the middle of a book—right now the design is like The Color Purple by Alice Walker but we change it quarterly to a new design. We also host musical acts and poets and a Whiskey Writers Club. Our bookshop is just as much a community organizing hub as it is a store.\n\nC.O.B.S MAGAZINE: Before Ida’s Bookshop you opened up another bookshop in Fishtown right before the pandemic. It is said that Fishtown has been known as one of the most racists part of the city. Can you tell us the name of the bookshop? How did it feel as a Black woman to open up this bookshop in a town like Fishtown? What was the most challenging part?\n\nJEANNINE A COOK: Yes, before Ida’s I opened a bookshop named Harrietts after my guiding light historic heroine Harriett Tubman. I opened up Harrietts because it was a place that I really needed for myself to heal. It also fulfilled a need I saw in the city where less than 2% of businesses are owned by folks who identify as Blk women. I believe spaces like ours, like the Colored Girls Museum, like Franny Lou’s Porch, Trunc, French Toast Bites, and Freedom Apothecary have the amazing ability to transform neighborhoods and restore social pain points because you are talking about institutions that don’t have to reform themselves from the ills of systematic racism, you are talking about spaces that care about community from deep within, you are talking about spaces that have made it their mission to be a beacon of light. But the most challenging part is all of the things you don’t know when you begin. All of the red tape and certificates and fees and licenses and ways in which the state feels comfortable attempting to take from us while it has yet to repair the harm inflicted on our ancestors. Then there’s folks who believe we don’t have the right to be in certain neighborhoods because those neighborhoods have historically looked one way or got away with certain levels of bullshit because they were homogenous. And having to teach folks who are accustomed to being bullies not to fuck with you.\n\nC.O.B.S MAGAZINE: In November of 2021 you hosted a very special event for a well-known actor. Can you share who the actor was? How was the overall experience of hosting their event?\n\nJEANNINE A COOK: We hosted the book launch for Will Smith and it was a very powerful experience to have someone of his notoriety say he wanted to support our work and launch with us. We redid our shop completely for his book covered it in all white and speaking to the theme in his book about having a blank canvas. We also hosted an all women hip hop concert out front with a a dj and a graffiti artists and dancers. It was live!\n\nC.O.B.S MAGAZINE: Funding an organization takes a lot of blood, sweat, and tears. Self-financing is the way most entrepreneurs start up their companies. How difficult is the process to continue to generate funding to handle the overhead?\n\nJEANNINE A COOK: It is the job. The job is to do well while doing good and it’s the best job in the world to be able to do this under the guiding light of my ancestors and to be able to share stories with generations and to be a stand for literacy in this way. It’s not an easy job but its far easier than the work Harriett and Ida had to do for our people.\n\nC.O.B.S MAGAZINE: In your opinion how much do consumers count on physical bookstores when they can go online and order millions of books without having to go out? What purpose do you find physical bookstores serve within the communities? What does the future look like for independent bookstores like yours?\n\nJEANNINE A COOK: I think that stories have always and will always be central to the human experience. I do think especially after being quarantined people have a newfound respect for public spaces and for the opportunity to gather. I also recognize that in many ways bookshops act as secular sanctuaries where folks can fellowship and dialogue and disagree and question and express and those experiences are ultimately the perfect antithesis to loneliness which is one of the leading causes of many issues in our society. And what independent bookshops offer to a neighborhood is far different than what a chain offers. The experience is customized and community focused. I think folks know that bookshops serve many purposes direct and indirect and as the desire to ban books and ban ideas and ban empathy grows across the nation.\n\nC.O.B.S. MAGAZINE: You are leading the change to create a federal holiday for Harriet Tubman. Can you share how that process is going? Why is it important for individuals to recognize her contributions?\n\nJEANNINE A COOK: The process is slow and a bit annoying. What it is teaching me is that our government and civic engagement has purposefully become overly complicated, cumbersome, and not at all people friendly. It was nice for the bill to get accepted into congress, but I recently learned that many many many bills get shuffled around congress for decades—take reparations for instance or even the fact that the first antilynching bill was just signed almost 200 years after Ida campaigned for that. I realize that there is so much effort and money put into the “get out the vote” effort but average citizens have no idea how our government works and how much decisions are made on money and not the will of the people. Why aren’t the millions of dollars spent on elections spent on educating the public on how policy gets made or how a law gets passed or even more importantly how to get rid of laws that are no longer necessary or important. It’s like a big game and very very wealthy people are running that game with their money and it’s kind of disgusting. Because if I was very wealthy it would be very easy to buy our way into a federal holiday. So it is teaching me what NOT to do when it comes time to create a new system of government because we are watching the current one slowly fizzle out. It is important for folks to recognize Harriett’s contributions not so much because Harriett needs it, but because we get to be reminded that the same spirit that Harriett possessed is possible in our current time. That same spirit of defying the odds, of honoring your fellow human, of endearing sisterhood, of putting your all into your community is possible and it is needed. This woman said give me liberty or give me death. You don’t hear folks having that kind of conviction about freedom anymore, but Harriett was a human, anything she did we all could do. She was a master strategist and in many ways that’s what we need more of.\n\nC.O.B.S. MAGAZINE: You had the opportunity to facilitate art and social workshops with youth from 15 countries around the world. What were some of the countries you visited and what was your end goal for presenting these workshops?\n\nJEANNINE A COOK: I co-developed curriculum for the American Friends Service Committee on racism, colonialism, and imperialism. I was sent to Nairobi and the UK and on my own I developed curriculum in South Africa and France and Trinidad. I was a part of a team tasked with ensuring youth had tools to dismantle and subvert those -isms through storytelling.\n\nC.O.B.S. MAGAZINE: In addition to holding a Master’s Degree from The University of the Arts, you are also a Leeway Art and Transformation grantee and winner of several awards. Can you share some of the awards that you have been recognized for and which awards mean the most to you?\n\nJEANNINE A COOK: I am not really that into awards. It is nice, but I am more excited by actual shifts in culture and society and not so much the awards. I realize now that a lot of the awards are political and often folks are giving out awards simply because it benefits the organization giving the award and not so much the society. But I’ve gotten some cool ones and I am thankful. But I don’t need any recognition to do what I am doing, doing the work is more than enough reward for me.\n\nC.O.B.S MAGAZINE: What continues to be your daily driving force? Where do you see yourself in the next five years? Can you please share your website information and can you please provide your social media platforms? We wish you continuous success.\n\nJEANNINE A COOK: My driving force is curiosity. I am very interested in how things work and what to do when things don’t work. I am also driven by creativity. I love making and challenging myself and those around me to do what others say cannot be done. Finally I am driven by those who came before me. I see myself on the spectrum of freedom and that I am only doing my part on that spectrum and that spirit which travelled through Harriett and before Harriett in her mother and before her mother in Queen Nanny and before Queen Nanny in Neferttii and before her in Isis, I am a part of that tradition. In the next five years I see myself continuing to do what I’ve always done, telling stories, bringing people together, standing up for what I believe in, building spaces that are aesthetically stimulating, studying, writing, and creating something or another. Harriett’s and Ida’s Bookshop on all platforms.\n\nThank you! Ase.\n\nOn the front cover of the 1973 book, Climbing Ice by Yvon Chouinard, a minuscule climber, with a single rope, grips onto a translucent, icicle-covered mountainside. Perhaps this is a formation from a cryovolcano on the southern tip of Pluto in the year 2053. Perhaps Earth has lost the war on emissions to extreme weather and Yvon, the only human with a semblance of life, traverses a frozen slush eruption with the last irregular mountaineering chock.\n\nOr maybe this book cover is a snapshot of 1960s Yvon on the border between Argentina and Chile near El Chaltén village and Viedma Lake with the howling Patagonian wind at his neck as he climbs miles into the sky on the back of Cerro Ritz Roy.\n\nWhile we do not know exactly where the minuscule climber is coming from, or where he is going, what we do know is that he is not afraid to go it alone.\n\n“How you climb a mountain is more important than reaching the top,” Yvon whispers to himself if you listen closely. “If you focus on the process of climbing, you’ll end up on the summit,” he sages himself further up.\n\nLast week Yvon Chouinard, who has gone from mountain climbing outdoorsman to founder and majority owner of a billion dollar clothing brand, Patagonia, announced that he is ascending yet another insurmountable summit. According to the New York Times, “Rather than selling [Patagonia] or taking it public, Mr. Chouinard, his wife and two adult children have transferred their ownership of Patagonia, valued at about $3 billion, to a specially designed trust and a nonprofit organization. They were created to preserve the company’s independence and ensure that all of its profits — some $100 million a year — are used to combat climate change and protect undeveloped land around the globe.”\n\nPatagonia operates stores in 10+ countries around the globe as well as factories in 16 countries. Yvon is also the co-founder of 1% For The Planet, an alliance of businesses that contribute at least 1% of their annual revenues to environmental causes.\n\nYvon, some may say, has reached the peak. His data driven commitment to manufacturing Patagonia’s products with sustainable materials and practices made customers loyal. Yes, this was the more difficult way to build a company, but it is clear that Yvon is comfortable with taking the more challenging climb. He is at the pinnacle of Mt. American Dream—build a strong company for 40 years—check, make millions of dollars doing what you love—check, do some good in the world—check, then relax. Nope. Yvon is not done climbing.\n\nYou should know that although ice-climbing had been happening in cold weather climates since forever, it was Yvon in the late 60s who made it into a sport—innovating on equipment, defining new techniques, institutionalizing safety while teaching others to protect the earth in the process. Hundreds of climbers have followed him up seemingly impossible mountains and lived to tell the same story. “The impossible is possible.”\n\nWhat if, yet again, Yvon is inspiring his fellow climbers to innovate, define, institutionalize, and protect but with business? How thrilling would it be to watch the wealthy, (and not so wealthy), lenders, policy makers, entrepreneurs, and manufacturers turn sustainability into a sport worth gawking at. Imagine cheering on your favorite brands as they edge us all closer to a stabilized global temperature or climbing flag polls because your favorite manufacturer has hit net zero. Yes, full on parades for corporations that break free from plastics.\n\nIt is us, the dollar wielding cheerleaders, with the most control over who becomes a billion dollar company. Patagonia did not do this on its own of course. We decided we would support their climb because we trust Yvon’s ability.\n\nSimilarly it is us who decides who will be the next one up Mt. Kenya—and must agree that it won’t just be those who check the cliche box of having a reduce, reuse, recycle message on their websites. Cheerleaders are excited for true champions— those who are sharing the data, the stats, the evidence of their commitment to serving mother earth. It is us who must demand Patagonia-like action from companies and policymakers and when we demand that with our dollars, it’s what we will get.\n\nSome may read this and say well ice-climbing is a white man’s sport, Jeannine. You don’t see any brothers or sisters risking their lives up there on the side of Mt. Kirkjufell bolted to a massive boulder. Those climate change, glacier huggers all look the same, right? No. Wrong. Very wrong.\n\nThere are a number of smaller manufacturers, who don’t look like Yvon, but climb like he does. Manufacturers like Darrell Jobe of Vericool, who may not be giving away all of his Black Friday sales, but he is making sustainable, environmentally friendly packaging to replace Styrofoam. His workers are second chance citizens like himself returning home from prison. Let’s cheer Darrell and his 50 employees up Mt. American Dream.\n\nThere’s also folks like Karen Young from Oui the People, who estimates that 2 billion plastic razors end up in landfills every year, and the personal care industry in general is one of the largest producers of waste, so she’s changing that without a billion dollars in revenue. Let’s cheer Karen and her 64 employees up Mt. American Dream.\n\nThe Karens and Darrells of the world are working to protect the same planet as Yvon and they are doing so with far less resources—so a little cheering goes a long way.\n\nOr maybe we do nothing at all. We let the minuscule man on the cover of Climbing Ice, continue at it alone with a single rope, gripping onto a translucent rime of hard snow. We play our part in helping Earth lose the war on emissions and we let Yvon be the only human with a semblance of life, traversing a frozen slush eruption when the last remaining mountaineering chock breaks in two.\n\nMaybe the impossible is just impossible.\n\nBut maybe not."
