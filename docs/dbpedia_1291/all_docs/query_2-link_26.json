        "text": "12 Best Paris Stores & Boutiques to Buy Your Boudoir Lingerie\n\n“Do not be troubled for a language, cultivate your soul\n\nand she will show herself.”\n\n– Eugene Delacroix, French Romantic artist\n\nAs a boudoir photographer working in the stylish, romantic city of Paris, I have come to know all the superior brands of boudoir lingerie available here, the timeless classics right through to the daring, or even quirky ones, along with the best stores and boutiques where you can find these styles.\n\nYour choice of lingerie is one of the most important decisions you will make with regard to your boudoir photography session. To a degree, it directly influences the feel and look of each individual final print, and the overall appearance of the album as a whole.\n\nHaving the professional experience of photographing a wide range of different body types, skin tones and looks, I am more than happy to advise what would work best for you (and what wouldn’t). However, I happily understand that your personal preference is of paramount importance to your entire boudoir experience, and that is what counts – for both you and me.\n\nThe list of Paris lingerie stores and boutiques that are featured here is a reflection of this professional experience, and has been compiled with you in mind. It represents the superior brands available here, the collections that photograph really well, and all of which have an extensive range of styles, colors, fabrics and, most importantly, good, old-fashioned choice. The list itself is in alphabetical order, and it’s not meant to be extensive – rather, and quite simply, the best of what is here – which, in turn, represents some of the best and most stylish lingerie brands in the world.\n\n#1. Madame Sensuelle\n\nLocated just a few blocks from the Montparnasse tower, you will discover a marvelous shop that boasts an exquisite collection of lingerie. Each piece has been carefully selected and curated to offer only the best and most stunning options. If you’re seeking to make a statement during your boudoir photoshoot in Paris with an elegant selection of lingerie, I encourage you to visit this boutique. They offer bold colors, daring designs, and phenomenal robes. Additionally, the staff is incredibly friendly and accommodating. I highly recommend taking the time to explore their offering. Address: 99 Rue de Rennes, 75006 Paris, France.\n\n#2. Agent Provocateur\n\nRenowned for their eye-catching and sensual styles, Agent Provocateur is a global brand and supplier of lingerie, stylishly designed with luxury-feel fabrics. Originally, a British lingerie retailer founded in 1994 by Joseph Corré, the son of Viviene Westwood, and his then-wife, Serena Rees, Agent Provocateur now has stores all over the world, including the U.S., Russia, Dubai and Hong Kong, and you’ll find their Paris store here: Printemps Haussmann, 64 boulevard Haussmann; (33-1) 42-82-44-60.\n\n#3. Atelier Amour\n\nIf you are looking for something more daring and provocative than even classic lingerie, look no further than the playful, erotic styles of Atelier Amour. In late 2015, Rachel Bouchon put her 15 years’ lingerie experience into creating a new concept in erotic intimates. Her Atelier Amour brand has created a new erotic-chic range – clearly designed or the most passionate of lovers. Prepare to even be a little shocked at Les Rituelles, 6 rue Houdon; (+33 1) 84-20-20-24.\n\n#3. Aubade\n\nFounded way back in 1875 as a traditional girdle and corset maker, Aubade continues to be a famous, stylish and unique brand in Paris. Now more famously known for its beautifully designed and brightly-colored, high-end lingerie, with their printed motifs, Aubade’s ongoing and innovative advertising series “Lessons in Seduction” says all you need to know this about this clear Parisienne favorite. Their small and friendly boutique, located at 22 rue du Vieux Colombier; (+33-1) 45-48-16-62, and one of eight in Paris, has a friendly staff who are more than capable of professionally advising women on what would look good, as well as advising men on what to buy as a special gift.\n\nTo book your boudoir photoshoot in Paris, click here:\n\n#4. Cadolle\n\nStaying with the traditional theme, Herminie Cadolle is actually credited with inventing the bra in 1889, and so liberating women from the corset (it really can’t get any more traditional than that). Their little, red and gold-painted boutique at 4 rue Cambon; (+33-1) 42-60-94-22 continues to hold a place in the hearts of Parisienne women, and still sells stylish undergarments that mold your body beautifully into the perfect shape. For the higher-end bespoke version, simply go around the corner to the by-appointment-only Loft Couture at 255 rue St-Honoré; (+33-1) 42-60-94-94.\n\n#5. Carine Gilson\n\nCarine Gilson, a graduate of Fine Arts at the Antwerp Academy, is renowned for her exceptional lingerie designs, described on her website as “An Ethereal Temptation” – all are utterly gorgeous and completely, 100% handmade, using only the finest natural silks and French lace. Regarded as both refined and romantic in look and feel, the current collection features virtually transparent black nothings and peachy satins, with their delicate and lacy motifs. An ethereal temptation indeed. You can find them at: Le Bon Marché, 24 Rue de Sèvres, 75007, Paris.\n\n#6. Livy\n\nThis lingerie brand has truly mastered the art of creating the perfect balance between minimalistic and detailed designs. I am absolutely enamored with their collection, as it exudes elegance in every way. With multiple boutiques across Paris, you can find one located in Le Marais at 83 rue Vieille du Temple, 75003 Paris. For inquiries or further information, you can contact them at 01 42 78 65 36.\n\n#7. Les Baisers de Vénus\n\nTo be honest, I had some doubts about including this boutique in my list due to their underwhelming website. However, please don’t judge the quality of their products based on that alone. I assure you, they have an exceptional collection of carefully selected pieces. If you visit the boutique, you’re bound to find something fabulous to wear for your Paris boudoir photoshoot. They offer statement pieces, and the lovely lady named Claudine who works there will assist you. The boutique is located at 27 Rue Jean-Pierre Timbaud, 75011 Paris.\n\n#8. The Lace Atelier\n\nFamily-owned and only established in 2014, The Lace Atelier is the idea of Christine and Hélène, who met as children in primary school at Le Lycée Français. After their creative lives went in different directions, they finally reunited back in Paris, and together, they established The Lace Atelier, headquartered in the 8th arrondissement of Paris, to provide luxurious wedding day lingerie, and lace robes for their bridal clientele. Delicate fabrics, including French lace from their family-owned mills, as well as silks and chiffon, embody their lingerie. Find them it: Galleries Lafayette, the address is: 21 Bd Haussmann, 75009 Paris; (+33 1) 56-52-94-85.\n\n#9. CHICHI CASTELNANGO\n\nMake sure to make a stop at their exquisite boutique located in the heart of le Marais. Get ready to be captivated by their exquisite collection of delicate and alluring lingerie, guaranteed to make you look absolutely breathtaking during your boudoir photoshoot in Paris. The address you won’t want to miss is 37 Rue de Poitou, 75003 Paris. Trust me, stepping into this charming boutique will transport you to a world of elegance and allure. Don’t miss out on the opportunity to discover the perfect pieces that will enhance your beauty and make your photoshoot an unforgettable experience.\n\n#10. Princesse Tam Tam\n\nPrincesse Tam Tam’s is charmingly evocative of the 1950s retro look, and their lingerie and swimwear designs have been described as “young, contemporary, fun, and affordable:” They complement all their collections with ‘50s style high-waisted culottes, dainty boxers, and pointy bras, either in bright, plain colors or with the use of graphic prints.\n\nPrincesse Tam Tam’s creative source is Loumia Hiridjee, a young woman of Indian origin, born in Antananarivo, Madagascar, along with her sister – Shama Hiridjee. And if you think you’ve heard the name Princesse Tam Tam before, it is inspired by a film by Edmond T. Gréville, in which Joséphine Baker shows off in underwear. Find their wonderful boutique here: 4 rue de Sèvres; (+33 1) 45-48-27-49.\n\nParis is blessed with world-famous labels and designs – if you choose to purchase your lingerie here (as many clients do), please don’t do it at the last minute. In case of any issues, I also keep a range of amazing products at my Paris studio for you to purchase. These lingerie pieces are hand-picked and carefully chosen by myself – for their style, their look, and how well they actually photograph – an important consideration.\n\nIf you have any questions at all about what to wear for your boudoir photography session, or you wish to ask about something else entirely, no problem – please feel free to connect with me, and let’s make all of these wondrous things happen for you.\n\n– Gloria Villa"
