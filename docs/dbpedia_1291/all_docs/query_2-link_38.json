        "text": "It’s a beautiful time in beautiful Baltimore. Spring weather, flowers blooming, and singing birds. While some of you may have traveled far, my amazing eclipse adventure took place down the street in Druid Hill Park. Solo viewers were joined by parents with young children whose excitement for the event was barely controllable. Along with the ubiquitous viewing glasses, there were still plenty of homemade contraptions that undoubtedly not only protected eyes, but extended the science lessons of this awe inspiring event.\n\nApril is Month of the Young Child! An expansion of national celebration, Week of the Young Child, this month-long event recognizes the importance of the arts in early childhood education. Join Arts for Learning Maryland, the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra, Port Discovery Children's Museum, and over a dozen other partnering arts and early childhood organizations to participate in engaging, arts-based learning programs all month long! These partner organizations are hosting a Calendar of Events of early childhood programs taking place in Maryland throughout April.\n\nCongratulations to the 36 this year's finalists for the Baker Artist Awards who were selected from close to 700 artists Baker Artist Portfolio site!\n\nThe Finalists for the 2024 Baker Artist Awards are:\n\nVisual Arts: Shroeder Cherry, Katie O'Keefe, Sara Prigodich, Andrea Sherrill-Evans, Tony Shore, Stephen Towns\n\nInterdisciplinary: Selin Balci, Kelley Bell, Melissa Hyatt Foss, Phylicia Ghee, Bruce Willen, Pamela Woolford\n\nFilm/ Video: Albert Birney, Eric Cotten, Marnie Ellen Hertzler, Corrie Parks, Jimmy Joe Roche, Lynn Tomlinson\n\nWomen’s History Month has its roots in the first International Women's Day in 1911. In all these years since, we are still fighting for gender equality in pay, reproductive rights, self-determination, and against violence and prejudice. The effects of this inequality has the deepest impact on women of color. According to the Pew Research Center, the gender pay gap – the difference between the median earnings of men and women – has remained relatively flat in the United States over the past two decades. In 2022, U.S. women typically earned 82 cents for every dollar men earned.\n\nMarch has definitely come in like a lion with its blustery winds, making it a great time to make a kite and visit the wonderful cultural events and organizations around the region. Save the date for the 2024 Big Baltimore Kite Festival in Patterson Park on April 6th, organized by GBCA Member Creative Alliance.\n\nLet Your Voice Be Heard – Participate in the Baltimore Music CensusThe Baltimore Music Census will launch on March 4, 2024 and will last for six weeks [it’s now launched! https://21cc.jhu.edu/baltimore-music-census/]. What is the Baltimore Music Census, you ask? It is a community-led, voluntary survey that will gather the data needed to better understand the current needs of the Baltimore-area music community.\n\nThe Community Arts Grant, awarded by BOPA, supports the design and implementation of new, exterior wall mural projects sited in underserved communities of Baltimore City. The art projects must be free and open to the public and exist in outdoor, publicly accessible space. Grant applicants may request up to $19,000 in funding support. BOPA will seek approvals on behalf of selected finalists. Mural projects must be completed by June 30, 2024. The deadline for grant applications is March 18, 2024, at 11:59 p.m.\n\nWhew, I don’t know about you but the GBCA team is still on cloud nine from last week’s event, where we honored Kevin Brown with the inaugural Cultural Innovator Award. Follow this link to watch Kevin’s video interview.\n\nPlease join us on Wednesday, February 28, at 5:00 p.m. to celebrate and honor Kevin Brown (pictured here), Owner and Head Chef of Nancy by SNAC, with GBCA’s inaugural Cultural Innovator Award. Kevin is not only a fixture in Station North, but has a long and storied track record of innovation and dedication to the arts and people of Baltimore. To mark the occasion and fete Kevin in person, GBCA is hosting a special Black History Month Happy Hour, at the Motor House Showroom.\n\nCongratulations to the honorees of The Baltimore Sun’s 25 Black Marylanders to watch. We were particularly delighted to see friends of GBCA and the arts community included on the list. Bravo to: Teri Lee Freeman, Executive Director of GBCA member the Reginald F. Lewis Museum of Maryland African American History and Culture. Terri is also a former member of our Board of Directors. Joanne Martin, President and co-founder, The National Great Blacks in Wax Museum.\n\nGBCA is happy to honor new Baltimore arts sector leaders during Black History Month.\n\nJason Steer was recently welcomed as the new Executive Director of GBCA member Creative Alliance. With over two decades of experience, he is known for his commitment to community engagement, inclusivity, nurturing talent on and off stage, strategic program design, and partnership-building. He comes to Creative Alliance from the famed Apollo Theatre in New York where he served in several senior roles spanning programming, educational leadership, and youth engagement.\n\nHow can you possibly ignore an exhibition entitled Eyewinkers, Tumbleturds, and Candlebugs: The Art of Elizabeth Talford Scott? If you haven’t seen it yet (and even if you have), don’t miss the Elizabeth Talford Scott Community Celebration on Sunday, February 4.\n\nThe Baltimore Office of Promotion & The Arts (BOPA) announces the first round of applications for Artscape 2024. This year marks the 40th Anniversary of Charm City’s cherished free arts festival and we want to include as many people as possible in the celebration. An event the size and scope of Artscape has a lot of moving parts, so there are many ways to get involved both in the lead-up to and during the festival. Applications can be found at artscape.org/applications.\n\nAfter more than 100 hours of professional training from September through December, the Cohort 2024 Urban Arts Leadership Fellows are about to embark on the next phase of their journey: a six-month placement at one of this year’s amazing host organizations. It is my honor to announce the host organizations and placements for the 2024 Urban Arts Leadership Cohort.\n\nRhythm Ajanku, Baltimore Museum of Art\n\nProposal submission deadline: Wednesday, March 13, 2024\n\nNotification: Selected recipients will be notified by June 30, 2024\n\nProgram implementation period: October 1, 2024 - August 31, 2025\n\nIf you have experience, knowledge, and expertise working with students with disabilities pre-kindergarten through grade 12, you could become a VSA Program Site.\n\n\"Life's most persistent and urgent question is, 'What are you doing for others?'\" Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.\n\nI hope you spent time last weekend reflecting on and honoring the life and legacy of Rev. Dr. King. As we move forward in the new year, we hold the words of Dr. King in our hearts as a reminder of the importance of giving.\n\nThis weekend, Baltimore lost a music giant. Our dear friend Carl Grubbs died leaving behind an amazing legacy and countless contributions to the music and broader communities of our region. A jazz saxophonist with a distinguished career as a performer, composer, music educator and recording artist, Carl toured with his ensemble in major cities worldwide. Early in his career, he received extensive training from one of the music world’s greatest legends in jazz, John Coltrane.\n\nHappy 2024! It feels like we have turned the corner on the pandemic and are reclaiming and recognizing the many contributions that artists, creative workers, and organizations make to Baltimore City and the region. While there are challenges ahead, including in the State budget, there is so much to build upon.\n\nIn my crystal ball, 2024 will include:"
