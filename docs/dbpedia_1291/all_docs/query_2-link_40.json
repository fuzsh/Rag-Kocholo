        "text": "In 1906, Freda Josephine McDonald was born in Saint Louis Missouri. She was the daughter of a teenage mother and she was raised in part by her grandmother, who had had been born into slavery. As a very young girl, Josephine Baker worked as a domestic and she later told some pretty horrible stories about the mistreatments that she had been forced to suffer. There are also stories about her having had to live on the street in the Saint Louis slums, sleeping in cardboard shelters and scrounging for food in garbage cans while she earned small change by dancing on street-corners. At the age of eleven, she witnessed the terrifying race riots in East St. Louis, as mobs of vigilante whites roamed the city, murdering inhabitants and setting fire to buildings. \"One day,\" she wrote, \"I realized that I was living in a country where I was afraid as a black. It was a country only for whites. Not for blacks.\"\n\nEarly images and plot lines associated with Josephine Baker often relied on racial stereotypes that would be rejected today. For those who can speak French, Pap Ndiaye has some interesting takes on this issue. Ndiaye, who is now France’s Minister for Education, is also a very well-respected historian specializing in Black studies. During a 2019 podcast interview on France Culture radio, Ndiaye explained that he believed that Josephine Baker had actually worked to take control of the stereotypes that were part of her acts, dismissing and deriding them at the same time that she was exaggerating them. “It is this French colonial imaginary world which she will capture and which she will play with, obviously with many nods and much distance, because Josephine Baker is not someone to be fooled,” Mr. Ndiaye explains.\n\nNdiaye also underlines how important it is to remember how Baker must have felt when she arrived in France. In a 2021 interview with the AP, he points out that her new life in Paris allowed for radical changes for Baker: “When she arrived, she was first surprised like so many African Americans who settled in Paris at the same time ... at the absence of institutional racism. There was no segregation ... no lynching. There was the possibility to sit at a cafe and be served by a white waiter, the possibility to talk to white people, to have a romance with white people... That doesn’t mean that racism did not exist in France. But French racism has often been more subtle, not as brutal as the American forms of racism.”\n\nAfter the Nazi occupation of France began, Josephine Baker joined the resistance. Her star power gave her instant access to diplomatic and aristocratic parties and her friendship with Miki Sawada, the wife of the Japanese ambassador to France, also got her through a lot of doors without any problems. She would work to charm people as she always had, using the conversations to collect information on Vichy policies and German-troop movements, jotting down whatever she learned on notes that she would pin to her underwear (she knew that she was too famous for anyone to think of strip searching her.) She also managed to smuggle documents and information to French spies by writing information on invisible ink on her sheet music.\n\nAs an entertainer, Baker was still allowed to travel around Europe. In 1941, she and her entourage went on a tour through Spain to Lisbon and then on to Morocco, collecting information at the many parties she was invited to. She smuggled dozens of classified documents to British intelligence about German airfields, harbors and troop concentrations in the west coast of France.\n\nFor her incredible heroism, Josephine Baker was awarded the Resistance Medal by the French Committee of National Liberation, the Croix de Guerre by the French military, and she was named a Chevalier of the Légion d'honneur by General Charles de Gaulle.\n\nBelow is an excerpt from Josephine Baker’s speech on the March on Washington:\n\n“I am not a young woman now, friends. My life is behind me. There is not too much fire burning inside me. And before it goes out, I want you to use what is left to light that fire in you. So that you can carry on, and so that you can do those things that I have done. Then, when my fires have burned out, and I go where we all go someday, I can be happy.\n\nYou know I have always taken the rocky path. I never took the easy one, but as I get older, and as I knew I had the power and the strength, I took that rocky path, and I tried to smooth it out a little. I wanted to make it easier for you. I want you to have a chance at what I had. But I do not want you to have to run away to get it. And mothers and fathers, if it is too late for you, think of your children. Make it safe here so they do not have to run away, for I want for you and your children what I had.”\n\nAbove, an article from Jet Magazine highlighted Baker's trip to the USA to participate in the March on Washington.\n\nIn April of 1975, Josephine Baker opened a retrospective show at the Bobino in Paris, which looked back at her 50 years of incredible successes. Baker had not had a show in Paris since 1959—but as she told the press, “there’s no way I can finish my career somewhere else!” The sold-out opening night must have been incredible — among the stars in the audience that evening were Princess Grace, Alain Delon, Sophia Loren, Mick Jagger, Jeanne Moreau, Shirley Bassey, Diana Ross and Liza Minnelli. And, of course, Pierre Balmain also attended the premiere. The headlines were unanimous in their praise and the president of France, Valéry Giscard d'Estaing noted that Baker was owed “the gratitude of France, whose heart has so often beat in unison with hers."
