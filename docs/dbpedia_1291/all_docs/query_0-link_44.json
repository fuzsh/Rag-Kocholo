        "text": "Here are the 12 best French lingerie brands you definitely need to know about! Whether you’re looking to refresh your lingerie drawer or just want to spice up your lingerie game, in today’s article, I’ve gathered the best French lingerie brands that can help you do just that!\n\nFrance is renowned for its luxury lingerie sector, with many lingerie brands launched in the 50s and 60s. They are now known worldwide for their savoir-faire and their long tradition of making silk (from Lyon) and lace (from Calais). After all, it is not a coincidence that the English word “lingerie” is a word taken directly from the French language and refers to women’s underwear ;).\n\nSo, just in time for Valentine’s Day, keep scrolling below to see and shop the best French lingerie brands and upgrade your underwear drawer to a whole new level of French chicness :).\n\nI carefully select and personally love every product featured on Leonce Chenal. If you buy through my links, I may earn an affiliate commission at no extra cost to you. Merci for your support <3\n\n1. Etam\n\nEtam is one of my favorite French lingerie brands! A pioneer in run-resistant lingerie, Etam is known for its stretch lace, mix-and-match sets, and affordable pricing. The French label is the perfect mix of playfulness and elegance combined with the sexiness one would associate with French lingerie.\n\n2. Chantelle\n\nChantelle is an international creative studio based in Paris and a family-owned company designing lingerie since 1876. The Paris-based label has been creating innovative lingerie for over 140 years, with a strong focus on comfort and fit. Known for creating the first seamless bra with molded cups in 1972, Chantelle has grown to become a world leader in French lingerie.\n\nIts first factory in Epernay, France, is still in operation today, where a new generation of seamstresses use time-honored techniques. Combining its heritage of innovation with contemporary styling, the brand crafts perfectly fitted products.\n\n3. Passionata\n\nPassionata is the sister brand to Chantelle, and with that comes superb quality and stylish Parisienne design. Fresh, contemporary, and ever so flirty, Passionata is suitably seductive and provides exceptional fits. Passionata offers a wonderful range of stylish, sophisticated bras and a wide range of back and cup sizes. Matching briefs and shorties share the same qualities and perfectly complete your lingerie drawer.\n\n4. Lise Charmel\n\nLise Charmel is the definition of elegance in women’s lingerie. This is definitely one of my favorite French lingerie brands! The company is renowned for its exceptional savoir-faire and craftsmanship combined with innovative and artistic designs. The brand was born more than half a century ago in the cradle of luxury, driven by the constant search for beauty and extreme comfort in the heart of Lyon’s silk neighborhood.\n\n5. Simone Perele\n\nElegance, meticulous attention to detail, innovation, and comfort: Simone Perele‘s reputation is built on the qualities of French style that are embraced by women all over the world. Founded in Paris in 1948, Madame Simone Perele, an expert corset maker, had the vision to liberate women and design lingerie that embraced a woman’s natural shape. She quickly gained a reputation for breaking with tradition, creating lingerie dedicated to women’s desire to look beautiful yet also feel comfortable.\n\n6. Eres\n\nThe French lingerie brand Eres has been employing innovative fabrics and sculptural silhouettes to create its swimwear and lingerie collections since 1968. Founder Irène Leroux championed the use of Lycra, producing swimwear year-round and offering separates for women to mix and match. Eres considers every detail to create completely unique garments, exclusive colors, and cuts to work in harmony with the body’s natural movements.\n\n7. Aubade Paris\n\nCreated in 1875 by Doctor Bernard, a corset specialist, the brand Aubade Paris was founded in 1958 when panties and girdles were essential elements of women’s lingerie collections. This French lingerie brand is responsible for certain innovations that marked the history of lingerie: the first strapless bras, halter bras, and the legendary “Agrafe-Coeur.”\n\n8. Ysé\n\nYsé Paris is a French lingerie brand created by Bérengère Lehembre and Clara Blocman-Petit in 2012. The Parisian brand mainly makes lingerie and swimwear without padding, with the perfect fit on every cup to naturally enhance women’s shapes. Each piece is made from high-quality material, like Calais lace and Austrian embroidered tulle. I absolutely love Ysé! This label creates gorgeous, feminine, and affordable lacy bras and bottoms that perfectly embody the concept of Parisian style.\n\n9. LIVY\n\nAfter 12 years designing for Millennial-friendly underwear brand Undiz, Lisa Chavy, who is 38, decided in 2017 to cofound her own lingerie brand with Laurent Milchior (one of the three managers spearheading Etam Group).\n\nLIVY, a contraction of the designer’s first and last names, was designed to be a compromise between mass-market underwear brands and luxury labels. The Parisian label put the raw material at the heart of each creation in order to offer the most beautiful, unique, exceptional, and qualitative pieces possible (the vast majority of their laces are French, from Calais).\n\n10. Yasmine Eslami\n\nYasmine Eslami is the founder and designer of her eponymous lingerie line. Before launching Yasmine Eslami lingerie and swim in 2010, she worked with Vivienne Westwood in London, styled for a bunch of publications, and acted as Artistic Director of swimwear at Eres. The Parisian lingerie label focuses on comfortable, lightweight pieces that enhance women’s natural shape.\n\n11. Maison Lejaby\n\nMaison Lejaby is a French lingerie Maison that has cultivated expertise in corsetry and lingerie since 1930 through the know-how of its craft workshops in Lyon. While respecting traditions, the brand is always rewriting the definitions of high-quality lingerie with the finest materials, precision cuts, and masterful perfect fits.\n\nMaison Lejaby offers a lingerie wardrobe perfect for every occasion with Parisian allure, sensual elegance, and a bold, classic look. Their designers select beautiful materials from European suppliers who work with the most prestigious fashion houses.\n\n12. Princesse Tam Tam"
