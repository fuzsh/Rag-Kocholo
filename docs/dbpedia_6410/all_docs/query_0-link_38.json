        "text": "Post by melkathi on\n\nLast week HBO brought out a very interesting documentary named Hot Coffee.\n\nIt addresses the Tort-Reform, so could be of interest to our american forumites.\n\nYouTube Trailer:\n\nwww.youtube.com/watch?v=bBKRjxeQnT4\n\nI found out about it through the Jamie Leigh Jones facebook group...\n\nThough I think the film is worth sharing, let's do remember the no politics rule of most forums And as a good example, I am not posting any actual views on the Tort-Reform (though I am cheating I guess, since my views are obviosu as otherwise I wouldn't tell people about the documentary )\n\nPost by pax on\n\n@melkathi said:\n\nYeah I thought you'd think it would be about that. This is me tricking gamers into looking at something not game related\n\nOh, but it IS game related ... for those who understand a bit about how the Law works. Frivolous lawsuits are frivolous lawsuits, after all.\n\nAnd honestly, I'm surprised there haven't been MORE \"video games made me do it\" suits, not to mention \"video games made my Perfect Angel little boy not get straight A's in school (camera pans over unwashed, slovenly, bored- and/or drugged-looking highschool boy or girl)\" suits.\n\nPost by Zed Brightlander on\n\n@melkathi said:\n\nI'll just link to that California Law ruling since that is of real interest to gamers (not that the tort reform shouldn't be , but *shrug*)\n\nwww.joystiq.com/2011/06/27/analysis-what-todays-supreme-court-decision-means-to-us/\n\nKeep your damn hands of my torts. They are delicious just the way they are. ;D\n\nblog.cohangroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/tort-300x225.jpg\n\nWin or lose, the smart gaming companies understand the power of The Mother and will come up with some sort of labeling system to let parents know what it is that their child is begging them to buy for them. Both comic books and movies companies created their own self regulating systems and a set symbols to go with it to keep the consumer parents (the ones with the credit cards) happy.\n\nPost by pax on\n\n\"Will\", Zed?\n\nTry already have ... the ESRB video game ratings system has been lauded by the FTC as being THE single most-effective industry self-rating scheme in the U.S.\n\nFor example, based on a study run by the FTC for several years now, kids under 17 are less able to buy an M-rated game, than they are to be able to see an R-rated movie, or buy an R-rated DVD:\n\narstechnica.com/gaming/news/2010/09/harder-for-kids-to-buy-m-rated-video-game-than-see-r-rated-movie.ars"
