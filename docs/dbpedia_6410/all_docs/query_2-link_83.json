        "text": "Against this historical backdrop, Blood Diamond, set in Sierra Leone in 1999, tells the story of the intersecting lives of Danny Archer, an Anglo ex-mercenary from Zimbabwe, Solomon Vandy, a fisherman from Sierra Leone, and Maddy Bowen, a American reporter.\n\nThe film begins with an RUF raid of Solomon's village. Several of the rebel fighters firing AK-47's into the crowd of fleeing villagers are children. The RUF was notorious for using child soldiers, kidnapped from their families and trained as killers. The RUF used an estimated 10,000 child soldiers to wage its violent war.\n\nSolomon is captured and forced to work in an RUF diamond mine. Soon after, his elementary-school-aged son is also captured. Later he is shown at an RUF camp, being taught with a group of children his age to forget their families, pledge absolute loyalty to the RUF, fire weapons, and to kill without shame.\n\nAt the mine, Solomon discovers a remarkably large and valuable pink diamond and buries it for safekeeping. The Sierra Leone army launches a deadly air strike against the rebels and the survivors, including Solomon, are arrested and brought to a jail in the capital. Because of a diamond-smuggling deal gone wrong, Danny Archer ends up in the same jail and learns about Solomon's pink diamond. He arranges for Solomon's release, hoping to get the diamond for himself in return for helping Solomon to find his family. Archer then tracks down Maddy Bowen, an American journalist looking to do a story on blood diamonds, and promises to give her damning information about the world's leading diamond corporation if she helps him find Solomon's family.\n\nAfter many dramatic and violent twists and turns, Archer finally sides with Solomon against his evil boss, Solomon is reunited with his family, including his son, and Maddy gets her story. She and Solomon travel to the Kimberley Conference in South Africa, where representatives from major diamond trading and producing countries have gathered to discuss solutions to the blood diamond problem and where Solomon will give eyewitness testimony. This was a real conference that convened in May of 2000 and led to the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme, which was implemented in 2003. Diamonds with a Kimberley Process Certificate are guaranteed to be conflict-free.\n\nReaction to the Film\n\nThis action-packed Hollywood film with the star Leonardo Di Caprio was nominated for five Academy Awards, and has brought the issue of blood diamonds to a much wider audience across the world. It was released in the U.S. in December at the beginning of the holiday shopping season. Fearing that it would affect sales, the World Diamond Council spent $15 million on a public relations and education campaign, which started months before the movie came out.\n\nAccording to a National Public Radio (NPR) program in October 2006, the Diamond Council tried to persuade Blood Diamond's director, Edward Zwick, to add a disclaimer to the film that would cite the Kimberley process and note that Sierra Leone's civil war was long over. Zwick refused, and indeed, while the flow of blood diamonds has slowed, human rights groups say that this is more due to the ending of wars in Sierra Leone and Angola than to the Kimberley certification process. \"What I wanted to create in their [movie-goers'] minds is consciousness,\" said Zwick. \"A purchase of a diamond just has to be an informed purchase. I think after seeing this movie, people will feel it incumbent upon themselves to ask for a warranty, so as to guarantee the diamond theyâ€™re buying is not from a conflict zone.\"\n\nEthical Issues and Discussion Questions\n\n1. When Maddy Bowen accuses Danny Archer of helping to prolong the conflict in Sierra Leone by his smuggling activities, Archer says that the American appetite for inexpensive diamond jewelry is just as much to blame. How should responsibility be allocated?\n\nNow that there is a warranty system in place, it is easier for consumers to avoid buying conflict diamonds. If consumers are aware that the gems they are buying may be conflict diamonds, is there a moral difference between their actions and those of Danny Archer?\n\nWhat is the responsibility of diamond corporations and retailers to ensure that they are dealing with conflict-free diamonds?\n\nTo what extent should consumers be responsible for investigating their purchases before they buy? Is there a moral difference between buying blood diamonds and buying goods produced in sweat shops\n\nIn the future, KPCS may serve as a model for other international frameworks designed to prevent trade in natural resources that is used to finance terrorism and human rights abuses. Do you think that this can work for other industries where abuses exist? Discussing sweatshops in her Carnegie Council talk, Responsibility and Global Labor Justice, Iris Marion Young proposes what she considers a viable legal model of shared responsibility. Do you agree and if so, what are the ways that this can be implemented?\n\nThrough diplomacy, UN peacekeeping forces, and finally British reinforcements, the international community played an important role in ending the protracted, complex, and bloody civil war in Sierra Leone. What is the responsibility of the international community to intervene in countries such as Sierra Leone? What are the arguments for and against intervention in countries racked by violence and human rights abuses? When, if ever, is intervention justified, and who decides?\n\n2. Although the film may have raised consciousness for a while, the NPR program of 2006 quotes a retailer and a human rights activist who both agree that its effects will soon wear off. Do you agree? If so, how can these issues be kept alive?\n\nOutside Links\n\nBooks\n\nA Long Way Gone: Memoirs of a Boy Soldier Ishmael Beah (Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 2007) First-person account of a boy who becomes a soldier in Sierre Leone at the age of 12.\n\nArmies of the Young: Child Soldiers in War and Terrorism David M.
