My only real work experience was as a Waiter. I decided to go with a creative approach and do all I could to stand out. After cutting out Disney pictures, creating the speech bubbles, and heading to a photocopier shop, I sent it to the hiring managers 🫡 I got offered the job over 2000 other applicants! 🤯 To this day, I am still gobsmacked I got it. AND… I’m sorry to disappoint those asking what the role was like, but I didn’t take it… 🫣 I changed my mind and decided to go to university instead 👨🎓 I guess what I’m trying to say is, don’t be afraid to think outside the box and you might just get your dream job. Imagine if I had taken the job, my life might be looking very different right now 🤔 To everyone creating their CVs and applying to new roles, make sure to stand out from the crowd. What was your first CV like? #ceoinsights #founder #sme #leadership #entrepreneur"
