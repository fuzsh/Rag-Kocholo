        "text": "'My film is very simple,\" said Czech director Milos Forman when asked for the secret to the success of 1975's One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. His portrayal of life in a mental asylum and how it is turned upside down by a boisterous prisoner feigning madness wiped the floor at that year's Academy Awards. It took home all four of the senior Oscars: best picture, best director, best actress and best actor for Jack Nicholson in the role of disruptive rebel Randle P McMurphy.\n\nBritish director Oliver Parker points out that the film's simple parts add up to an incredibly sophisticated whole: \"On the surface, it's a fairly small story, pretty much all set within the small environment of that bloody asylum. It's incredibly understated and, considering the difficult subject matter, very light-footed. But what amazed me when I first saw it aged 14 was how many different ways it involved me: it's dramatic, it's scary, it's funny, it's moving, it's uplifting. It's a staggering piece of film-making.\"\n\nForman's film was based on the 1962 novel of the same name by Ken Kesey. Through the hallucinatory ruminations of its narrator - the mute Native American Chief Bromden - the book proposed that the mad were the only truly sane people within a society forced into compliance by a bureaucratic conspiracy. Kesey was adopted by the hippie movement as a prophet for the psychedelic age. But when Forman came to make the film, he played down the book's druggy connotations, replacing Kesey's nutty narrator with an objective narrative viewpoint and opting for a naturalistic approach. Kesey was furious, but Forman stood firm. \"I hate that whole 1960s drug free-association thing,\" he said in an interview at the time. \"That's fine in the book, which is stylised. But in the film the sky is real, the grass is real, the tree is real; the people had better be real too.\"\n\nNicholson's portrayal of \"Mac\", says Parker, is one of the all-time great \"real\" screen personas: \"It's one of those performances, like Brando in A Streetcar Named Desire, which just burns through the screen. Here into this desperate place comes this fantastic character - a dangerous free spirit. Through him, you see how the other inmates are being ground down by the system. Nicholson had an animal presence - he was the definition of star quality. As a young man, I was completely entranced by his character.\"\n\nOne of the main reasons that Nicholson is so effective, Parker says, is that Forman gives him time and space to perform. He cites the famous scene, after McMurphy has organised a debauched party for the inmates, when he is preparing to make his escape. \"Mac has set it up for one of the girls from the party to sleep with young Billy and he waits by an open window so he can leave with the girl as planned. There's this amazing shot where the movie grinds to a halt. We've been waiting for this moment and Forman just holds it up with this very grainy close-up. There's so much mystery in Nicholson's expression: it's at once completely empty of thought - he's knackered and drunk - and amazingly contemplative. It's an endless, mesmeric shot, but it's completely alive.\"\n\nTo a certain extent, Cuckoo's Nest was an early exercise in documentary-style film-making. It was filmed on location at a real residential psychiatric hospital and featured real patients in some of its scenes. The role of Doctor Spivey, the boss who must evaluate whether McMurphy's \"madness\" is simply a ruse to get out of prison labour, was played by Dr Dean Brooks, the actual head of the institution.\n\nMany of Forman's technical choices, Parker points out, were clearly made with realism in mind: \"I once went to see a friend in an asylum and Forman got that intensely depressing, stifling atmosphere totally right with his sound, that bloody elevator music they have to listen to, the grainy images, even the murky colours down those horrid corridors.\"\n\nA relatively young director, Parker has three major films under his belt: Othello, An Ideal Husband, and The Importance of Being Earnest, released next week. As adaptations of literary period classics, they are wildly different from Cuckoo's Nest in content, but Parker says he has taken valuable lessons from the film.\n\n\"I strive to achieve the same type of humanity in characterision. Look at Mac. He's a tough bastard, he's beaten people up and been accused of rape, but he's utterly sympathetic. It's a brave move, but this is a very brave film.\""
