Oliver Parker's 1995 film adaptation of Shakespeare's Othello was notable for casting Laurence Fishburne as the first black actor to play Othello in a major film production. Prior film adaptations had used white actors in blackface. The document discusses the history of Othello on film from its earliest silent film versions to more recent adaptations. It provides analysis of notable adaptations such as Orson Welles' 1952 version and Laurence Olivier's 1965 version. The bulk of the text focuses on analyzing Parker's 1995 adaptation starring Fishburne and its significance as the first to feature a black actor in the title role.",
