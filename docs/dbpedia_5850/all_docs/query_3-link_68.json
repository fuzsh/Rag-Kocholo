        "text": "Oliver Jackson Murphy, Jr. (Jack), died peacefully Friday April 12, 2024 at the SECU Jim & Betsy Bryan Hospice House in Pittsboro, NC.\n\nJack was born June 4, 1941, to the Rev. O.J. Murphy and wife Thelma Freeman in Knoxville, TN. He spent his middle and high school years in Hickory, NC where his father was pastor of Penelope Baptist Church. Jack received an A.A. Degree from Mars Hill Jr. College in 1961 and transferred to UNC-Chapel Hill where he received his B.A. Degree in 1963. He joined the US Air Force in 1963. Jack completed Officer Training School in 1963 and Navigation School in 1964. He achieved the rank of captain and was a navigator instructor in C-141 cargo planes from 1965 through 1968 and flew missions around the world. During these years he was stationed at Charleston’s Air Force Base in Charleston, SC. In August of 1963 he married Jane Morris.\n\nUpon leaving the Air Force, Jack and Jane moved to Jane’s hometown of Siler City NC.

He was a member of the Siler City Country Club, Loyal Order of the Moose Lodge, and served on a Chatham Hospital advisory board. Some of Jacks favorite times were spent at his beach place, watching his grandchildren play sports, and being with family. From childhood on Jack loved all animals especially the many cats and dogs that were family pets. Jack was a wonderful husband, loyal friend, and loving father. Left to cherish his life and memory are his wife of 59 years Jane; his two sons, Kenneth (wife Cadye), of Pittsboro NC and Mark (wife Dawn), of Siler City, NC; and four grandsons, Parker, Connor, Hunter, and Ryder.\n\nA visitation and funeral service will be held on Wednesday, April 17, 2024 at 11:00 AM with Rev.
