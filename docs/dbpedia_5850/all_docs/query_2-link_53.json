On 31 October 1775, he was in Capt. Ephraim Corey’s company in receipt of an ‘order for bounty coat or its equivalent in money dated Cambridge.’II\n\nOn 1 January 1776, he reenlisted serving in Capt. James Perry’s company, in Col. Paul Dudley Sargent’s regiment, for three months. He was ‘reported deserted’ on 19 April 1776. At this point is name drops off the Massachusetts rolls.III\n\nHis 28 March 1818 application for a U.S. Pension expands the knowledge of his service:\n\nthat he first enlisted in April AD 1775 for eight months in Capt [Oliver] Parker’s company & Colo [William] Prescott’s Regt of Massts troops & served through that campaign, was engaged in the Battle of Bunker Hill & at the expiration of his eight months viz in December 1775 he enlisted for one year at Cambridge in the Cont line, in Capt [William] Hull’s company & Colo [Charles] Webb’s Regt & at the expiration thereof he was enlisted again at Fishkill N. York for three years by Lieut. Smith but on account of his sickness he was about six months afterwards discharged from the service. In August 1777 he again enlisted into Capt [Jonathan] Wadsworth’s company & Col [Thaddeus] Cook’s Regt for three months & was wounded at the battle of Saratoga & having faithfully served out his time was honorably discharged...IV\n\nPrince was probably wounded in the first Battle of Saratoga on 19 September 1777, as his Captain was killed in that engagement.\n\nThe 1790 census of Hartford lists him as head in a household of three free people of color.V\n\nOn 26 August 1820, he had to reapply for his pension in order to prove need:\n\nPrince Hulls Inventory\n\n1 horse $5\n\n1 Waggon $1.50\n\n1 trunk 25 cents\n\n1 chest 25 cents\n\n2 tables 25 cents\n\n4 chairs 25 cents\n\n1 dish kettle 17 cents\n\n1 tea kettle 17 cents\n\n1 pot 25 cents\n\n1 spade 25 cents\n\n1 shovel 12 cents\n\n1 hoe 6 cents\n\n1 hammer 6 cents\n\n1 pair tongs 6 cents\n\n1 andiron 6 cents\n\n1 saw 12 cents\n\npots & mugs & dishes 15 cents\n\n1 jug & stone pot 10 cents\n\n-------------\n\n$8.57\n\nI am by occupation a laborer but unable to labor by reason of infirmity. I have a daughter who keeps my house....
