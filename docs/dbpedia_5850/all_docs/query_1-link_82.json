        "text": "On July 19th 1996 Skeen rushed into our world. It was a magical day as his twin, Oliver,was kind enough to join him. He was a happy and curious youngster. He craved knowledge and conversation. Playful, incredibly bright and energetic he was joyful for his early years. He attended Brebeuf Jesuit High School because, \" it's not a Catholic school\". He valued the academic rigor this Jesuit school provided. While at Brebeuf he joined the Debate team and went to Nationals twice before his senior year. He took many AP classes and entered Purdue University with over 25 credits. Purdue ended up as a poor fit and he moved to IUPUI where he studied Political Science and applied to Law School. After passing the Bar he took a position at Neighborhood Christian Legal Clinic where he worked on Housing Justice. He held his head high and proudly advocated for those in need and with little means. He soon joined and became active in the Democratic Socialists of America. In addition, he supported the students on the IU campus in Indianapolis protesting the brutal treatment of the Palestinians in Gaza and in no way condoned Hammas. Lastly, he was working with a housing reform group in hopes of leveling, if only a little, the field that so overwhelmingly favors commercial landlords. He was busy, building a community for him to serve and effecting causes and lives in meaningful ways.\n\nSkeen loved dogs, pets of all kinds really. But he loved dogs. They seemed like good medicine for him. Cooking and exploring foods was a great interest. He worked at a number of local restaurants including The Cake Bake Shop. He enjoyed preparing food for and challenging the palate of his family. He combined his interests in cooking with hiking and became a forager. In truth, he did this as a child and worried all of us. He relaxed while in the woods. Forest Bathing helped wash off some of the anxiety and sadness that sometimes covered his spirit. He fought depression for over a decade. Even while enjoying new friendships, romances and social justice legal successes, he held onto a deep sadness. His sense of humor, insight and intellect coupled with an invincible constitution kept him going until it was no longer invincible. He remains a joy and inspiration to his family and colleagues. He is survived in the hearts of his brother, Oliver MacKie, his mother, Rosie Bullard and his father, Palmer MacKie. and numerous cousins, aunts and uncles.\n\nAll attendees and or those who cannot attend the Celebration of Life are invited to join the family at Merrimac Club House (14828 Chamberlain Dr. Westfield, IN 46074) for food and drink and to continue the fellowship and stories."
