        "text": "Thandiwe Newton's husband cut a solitary figure today as speculation grew that he and his wife have split just days after she was allegedly sacked from her leading role in Magic Mike 3.\n\nThe A-list actress, 49, and film director Ol Parker, 52, reportedly parted, following claims that she had a heated argument with co-star Channing Tatum, amid growing concern around her behaviour.\n\nMr Parker, who has three children with the Hollywood star and who wrote and directed the 2018 musical film 'Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again' remained alone at their £1.5 million London home with the shutters down on each window, out of synch with neighbouring homes enjoying the Bank Holiday sunshine.\n\nThe movie man only ventured out to collect a DHF parcel delivery and was shoeless, unshaven and dressed in a grey T-shirt and jeans. He also had two rings in his left ear. Behind him in the front window for all to see was a neon lit sign which read 'Dream'.\n\nAsked about reports of his marriage split, the 52-year-old said: 'I don't want to say anything, thank you.'\n\nHe has been married to the BAFTA winning actress since 1998. The couple share three children, Ripley, 21, Nico, 17, and Booker, eight.\n\nEight weeks ago he completed directing his latest movie 'Ticket to Paradise' which stars George Clooney and Julia Roberts.\n\nMr Parker, who has less then 5000 Twitter followers compared to his wife's 178,000, posted the message: 'We just wrapped on 'Ticket to Paradise'.\n\n'I got lucky again with an extraordinary cast and crew. Beautiful people and times x.'\n\nMs Newton is said to be entering rehab in Arizona, according to reports\n\nColleagues have become increasingly worried about the actress, 49, with sources describing her as 'acting strange on set', 'always ranting and raving', and being 'very highly strung'.\n\nThere are now claims she is 'heading to rehab', according to Page Six, which reported a source as saying: 'Her apparent breakdown caused so much disruption, it became clear she couldn't play the role.\n\n'There is a lot going on in her personal life, she and her husband have separated. She seemed so stressed she even brought her two pet rabbits to her hotel for emotional support.'\n\nIn February, she came under fire for a 'cringey' and 'patronising' interview to promote the movie God's Country, during which she burst into tears as she apologised to 'darker-skinned actresses' for 'taking their roles'.\n\nIn the film she plays a grieving black professor who confronts two white hunters on her property. But Thandiwe told Sky News she considered not taking the role due to concerns about 'colourism'.\n\nBeginning to well up, the actress said she 'wanted to apologise every day to darker-skinned actresses'. She said: 'It's been very painful to have women who look like my mum feel like I'm not representing them. That I'm taking from them. Taking their men, taking their work, taking their truth. I didn't mean to.'\n\nThandiwe, who reverted to the African spelling of her name after previously going by 'Thandie', has been married to Ol Parker since 1998. The couple share three children, Ripley, 21, Nico, 17, and Booker, eight.\n\nMs Newton has been described as being 'very demanding' and behaving like an 'absolute diva' on the set of Magic Mike 3, according to one crew member.\n\n'Everyone on set found her challenging to work with,' they told The Sun. 'She's an absolute diva. I've watched her have a go at the first assistant director, her costume girl. She's always ranting and raving about something.'\n\nA spokesman claimed she stepped away from the film - to be replaced by Selma Hayek - because she needed to ‘deal with family matters’.\n\nBut it has been reported her position became ‘untenable’ after she fell out with co-star Channing Tatum, 41, on set in Paddington, west London.\n\nIt was claimed they had an ‘unimaginably vicious’ argument over Will Smith’s behaviour at the Oscars, when he slapped comedian Chris Rock on stage.\n\nAn unnamed crew member said: ‘They fell out over the debacle at the Oscars. I was on set... It was a tense exchange of words, but suddenly it escalated – Channing got into this car and he disappeared.’\n\nHowever, this account of events has not been corroborated by anyone else.\n\nAn insider added that she fired her UK agent of three decades as her US agent Gaby Morgerman flew in to try to help.\n\nGaby is considered one of the most powerful women in Hollywood, representing stars including Matthew McConaughey and Minnie Driver over her thirty year career at powerhouse agency William Morris.\n\nMs Newton has reportedly fired her UK team at London based agency Independent Talent Group in recent weeks.\n\nThe insider said of her next steps: 'Thandiwe's team wants her to go to rehab for mental health support.\n\nShe was supposed to leave immediately for a facility, they tried for a Malibu rehab, but they couldn't take her. Arrangements are now being made to go to a facility in Arizona, if she agrees to go.'\n\nA Warner Bros. Pictures spokesperson said: 'Thandiwe Newton has made the difficult decision to step away from the production of Warner Bros. Pictures' Magic Mike's Last Dance to deal with family matters.'\n\nThe statement came after insiders told The Sun that Thandiwe is planning on suing studio chiefs at Warner Bros over the incident.\n\nThe argument reportedly took place on location in Paddington.\n\nA source said: 'Channing Tatum is the producer and number one on set. Thandiwe Newton is the number two star. But 11 days into shooting and it's all over.\n\n'They fell out over the debacle at The Oscars. I was on set. I watched her and watched him. They were in and out of the house where we were filming having this confrontation.\n\n'After the row he just went, 'I am not working with her anymore'. Him being a producer, it's his movie, so she's off the movie.'"
