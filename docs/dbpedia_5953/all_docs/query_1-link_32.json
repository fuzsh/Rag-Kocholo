        "text": "It is no wonder that the author of \"Confessions of a Co-Ed,\" the current talking picture at the Paramount, should prefer to remain anonymous, for it is a most trivial and implausible story, although the scenes are nicely photographed and attractively staged.David Burton and Dudley Murphy are credited with the direction, which is nothing to arouse any great degree of enthusiasm. So far as the performances of the players are concerned, even Norman Foster, who gave such an able portrayal in the film of \"Up Pops the Devil,\" fails to make much of his rôle, that of Hal, one of the students at Stafford University. Others in the cast include Phillips Holmes, who appears as another student named Dan, and Sylvia Sidney and Claudia Dell, who play two co-eds, respectively known as Patricia and Peggy.It is a Hollywood conception of an educational institution, where, as usual, the students devote their whole time to discussing affairs of the heart, never for an instant revealing any inclination for work. Throughout this offering the affection between Dan and Patricia see-saws back and forth, with Peggy evincing a desire to capture Dan and Hal having a temporary period of bliss in the latter stages of the narrative as Patricia's husband.The dialogue is filled with \"hellos\" and halting lines, which are apt to provoke mirth when it is not intended. In the course of the events Dan is persuaded to go out for a ride with Peggy in Hal's car. They come to a halt at a spot that is out of bounds for the students, and when Dan is warned that a motorcycle policeman is coming down the road he and Peggy, realizing the seriousness of the situation, leap into the runabout and speed away, with the motorcycle policeman giving chase. This minion of the law finally skids and falls. Dan and Peggy leave the car in the road and hasten to their abodes.Through the fact that Peggy forgets her vanity case in the automobile it is a foregone conclusion that she will be expelled from the university. She is forced eventually to quit the college and Dan stays on, but after the holidays he is expelled also. Subsequently Hal marries Patricia, she believing that her intimacy with Dan is known to Hal. Then there is the little boy—Dan's child—who welcomes his real father as a man he likes when Dan returns from a three-year stay in South America.But no muddle is beyond the motion picture producer when he desires to give the audiences a happy ending, and the case of Patricia and Dan is no exception.Claudia Dell and Sylvia Sidney give a fairly good account of themselves in their roles. Mr. Holmes, like Mr. Foster, is handicapped by the lines and the peculiar behavior of the character.The stage contribution is \"College Rhythm,\" with Ethel Merman and Rudy Vallee.\n\nA College Romance.CONFESSIONS OF A CO-ED.

Bruce ColmanBritish International Pictures, of London, is sponsor for Alfred Hitchcock's pictorial version of John Galsworthy's estimable play, \"The Skin Game,\" which is now to be seen at the Little Carnegie Playhouse. Mr. Galsworthy's narrative is bound to enlist one's attention, but Mr. Hitchcock, who is responsible for the adaptation as well as the direction, cannot be said to have accomplished either task in a fashion the subject deserves, for in undergoing the studio operation the original work has been sapped of its persuasive drama.The vocal recording as reproduced yesterday is extremely uneven and virtually the only player who distinguishes himself is Edmund Gwenn, who impersonates the aggressive Lancashire parvenu, Hornblower.Several of the other players speak their lines too rapidly, with the consequence that during some of the interludes they might as well be conversing in Javanese as English. These poor scenes recall the fun Chaplin poked at talking pictures in his \"City Lights.\"C. V. France is disappointing as Hillcrist, head of the well-bred family who resent Hornblower's invasion of that section of the country where they have their Summer home. Mr. France is lifeless in his part, giving only a superficial conception of it.One of the best sequences in this production is that of an auction of a parcel of land, for which Hornblower and Hillcrist are bidding, Hillcrist having entrusted his bidding to a man named Dawker. Hornblower does his own bidding, until the end, when he outwits Hillcrist by having another individual speak for him. Hillcrist arranges with Dawker through Mrs. Hillcrist that when he blows his nose once it means to continue bidding, but that if he blows it twice it is a signal that he is no longer interested in the proceedings.The auctioneer is played quite well by Donald Frankau, who stresses the character's lack of manners.In order to spare the beauty of the surrounding country from Hornblower's proposed chimney pots and surface cars, Hillcrist stoops to conduct which he would never have countenanced before. He learns of a scandal connected with Hornblower's daughter-in-law and it is agreed that nothing will be said about it so long as Hornblower foregoes his destructive plans.Mr. Hitchcock's imagination is never particularly keen during this production, and frequently there are lengthy discourses between two characters without the slightest semblance of movement to the picture. Now and again this director has a fairly good idea, but it is never brilliant, and several of his scenes are not helped by too much footage being given to the exits of characters.Helen Hayes's performance as Mrs. Hillcrist is quite satisfactory. Jill Esmond and John Longden apparently need more experience in talking for the microphone. Edward Chapman, who figures as Dawker, is seldom effective in his acting.\n\nA Galsworthy Play.THE SKIN GAME, an adaptation of John Galsworthy's play; directed by Alfred Hitchcock; a British International Picture.

Ronald FrankauThe Warner-operated Strand is host to a Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer picture entitled \"Men Call It Love,\" the chances being that the lethargic seeker after warm-weather amusement will call it a number of things, none of them complimentary. The most reasonable designation is that it reduces the fashionable infidelities of Vincent Lawrence's play, \"Among the Married,\" to a slightly less than routine domestic drama in which the Hollywood formula for such matters rears its uninvited head in four out of every five sequences.Fresh from his triumphant march through \"The Front Page,\" Adolphe Menjou distributes cocktails and good cheer in lonely bedrooms and in general is the focal point for the confidences of more discontented wives than one harassed playboy would seem to have time for. The locale appears to be a smart country club somewhere in Westchester or Long Island, or perhaps it is Beverly Hills. Mr. Menjou prefaces his various indiscretions with an invitatation to play golf, which is only a manner of speaking because he never does manage to reach the green.A good deal of naïve chatter is bandied about with the cigarettes and drinks, and Mr. Menjou comes in for his share of it. To Leila Hyams, who has decided to spend the night at his apartment, he remarks, \"I'd feel a lot better if I knew where your husband was.\" As a matter of record, the young lady loves her husband, but she has detected him in the act of flirting with an erratic wife and, as she has already explained, \"You have killed my love for you.\"Her husband, represented by Norman Foster, doesn't care much one way or the other, because he only wants his wife to be happy. It all comes out right in the end because Mr. Foster is thoughtful enough to let Miss Hyams overhear him telling Mr. Menjou to take good care of his wife after they are divorced.\n\nFashionable Flirtations.MEN CALL IT LOVE.

Harry NorthrupExploding gasoline, crashing thunder and peals of merriment set off by pithy jokes are blended into a delightful German language film operetta being presented at the UFA-Cosmopolitan under the label \"Die Drei von der Tankstelle.\"As the up-to-date daughter of an indulgent and wealthy father, Lilian Harvey dominates the situation pretty effectively from the time she halts her expensive car at the gasoline station being run by three former \"gilded youth,\" until she wins the man of her choice, Willy, a selection no doubt approved by the women in the audience. For this excellent actor presents a fine figure of a man, especially in the near-serious moments when he rebukes Consul Cossmann for his upbringing of his daughter and where he resigns as general director of the chain of filling stations established by Lilian, with her father's money.Olga Tschechowa, as the experienced woman of the world aiding the vivacious and pretty Lilian in her schemes, lives up to her good reputation as an actress. Herren Karlweis and Ruehmann are worthy side-partners of Willy Fritsch. The others in the cast do satisfactory work, although Felix Bressart, whose acting in \"Die Privatsekretaerin\" is one of the outstanding features of that film comedy, has little chance to show his mettle.Herr Heymann has equipped this operetta story with pleasing melodies, which take the occasional bumps of the road with ease. Some of the airs, as for instance \"Darling, my Heart Sends You Greetings,\" will ring for a long time in the ears of listeners, as will the alluring tooting of the automobile horn with which the dashing Lilian is wont to announce her approach. Director Thiele has managed to make the tale fairly clear, even to those not understanding German, although a working knowledge of German adds materially to the enjoyment of the picture."
