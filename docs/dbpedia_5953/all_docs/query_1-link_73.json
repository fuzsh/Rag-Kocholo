        "text": "Hear what people are saying about this new production –\n\n“Wonderfully imaginative…This production of Bartok’s ‘Bluebeard’s Castle,’ is one of BLO’s most compelling in recent memory.\n\n“Anne Bogart has created a production that resonates sympathetically with the vivid, kaleidoscopic music of Bartok’s score.”\n\n“Excellent vocal performances are at the heart of the evening. Ryan McKinny [sang] a rare blend of dramatic force and subtlety. Naomi Louisa O’Connell sang with coolly gleaming tones and a well-honed sense of her character’s obsessive urge to reveal the Duke’s secrets.\n\n“Riveting…a night of music and theater brought into a kind of elusive accord…sets as its new standard.”\n\n– Boston Globe\n\nMarch 23, 2023\n\n“Breathtaking…a stunning mixture of choreography and song.”\n\n“…an electrifying, artistic happening…Worth dropping everything to secure a ticket. You’ll be sorry if you don’t.”\n\n“Sheer brilliance…There needs to be a new term coined for BLO’s current production: ‘opera’ doesn’t begin to describe the multi-sensorial experience provided by this inventive, exciting and unique installation event.”\n\n“Naomi Louisa O’Connell is iridescent and silver-throated; Ryan McKinny is commanding.”\n\n– Theatre Mirror\n\nMarch 23, 2023\n\n“I just love all the dramatic aspects of opera and I love the music and the drama coming together and I’ve been directing operas for years. What’s not to love about it? It’s grand and glorious and it tells fantastic stories.” – Anne Bogart\n\n– The Arts Fuse\n\nMarch 14, 2023\n\n“BLO returns to action with the peculiar pairing of Bartók’s harrowing masterpiece and four songs by Alma Mahler”\n\n– The Arts Fuse\n\nMarch 12, 2023\n\n“Bogart…is renowned for the musicality of her staging.”\n\n– Boston Globe\n\nFeb 28, 2023\n\n“Ryan McKinny & Naomi Louisa-O’Connell Lead Boston Lyric Opera’s Double Bill”\n\n– OperaWire\n\nFeb 17, 2023\n\n“Director Anne Bogart to Helm Bartók’s BLUEBEARD’S CASTLE at Boston Lyric Opera”\n\n– Broadway World\n\nFeb 14, 2023\n\n“Boston’s theater scene sizzles this season”\n\n– Boston Herald\n\nJan 22, 2023\n\n“Boston Lyric Opera To Present a New Production of Bluebeard’s Castle From Director Anne Bogart”\n\n– The Boston Sun\n\nDec. 22, 2022\n\nBLO Mid-Season Casting Announcement\n\n– Broadway World Boston\n\nDec 1, 2022\n\nAlma Mahler’s Four Songs and Bluebeard’s Castle\n\nThe following synopsis represents a brief literary summary of the original libretto for Béla Bartók’s Bluebeard’s Castle and its framing by Alma Mahler’s Four Songs. BLO’s production presents a new abstract reimagining of this story.\n\nSynopsis by: Allison Chu\n\nFrom the darkness of the woods, Judith emerges, singing of beauty and light. She meets Bluebeard, who has summoned her to his castle. She has come to live with him, leaving her family and home behind. Judith marvels at the castle’s darkness and gloom. Despite her fear, she proclaims her love for Bluebeard, hoping that her declaration will encourage him to allow light into his lair. As Bluebeard leads her deeper into the castle, she demands that the doors to seven rooms be opened to let in the sunshine. Bluebeard refuses, requesting that Judith love him without question. However, Judith is persistent, and eventually he relents.\n\nAt the first door, Judith discovers shackles, daggers, and weapons — instruments of a torture chamber. She notices that the walls are blood-stained but is not deterred from her desire to open all the doors. Bluebeard asks her if she is frightened, and she responds by requesting the keys to the other doors. The second reveals the armory, with piles of cruel arms and armor. As Judith opens the third door, she is delighted by the sight of gold and riches; it is the treasure chamber. The fourth door leads Judith to the garden, which is filled with flowers. However, her joy is interrupted as she realizes that the treasure and the flowers are stained with blood. The fifth door allows Bluebeard to show his kingdom to Judith. Bluebeard asks Judith to embrace him, but she makes no move; there are two more doors still to open.\n\nThe sixth door opens to a lake of tears, and Judith begins to understand Bluebeard’s secret. She stands before Bluebeard, asking about his past loves, but he merely repeats his request for her to love him without question. At the final door, Judith reveals his secret: the door hides Bluebeard’s former wives, now made immortal. There are three wives, one each for dawn, noon, and dusk; it is their blood that stained the castle and their tears that filled the lake. Judith is meant to be the wife of the night, and Bluebeard begins adorning her with jewelry. Horrified, she begs Bluebeard to stop, but she surrenders under the weight and takes her place among the other wives. In spite of her ordeal at Bluebeard’s castle, Judith goes on to sing again, retaining her sense of self and her romantic worldview.\n\nCONTENT WARNING\n\nBluebeard’s Castle | Four Songs is a psychological thriller and may not be suitable for all audiences. Throughout the show there are depictions of weaponry, armor and restraints, and blood. There are both implied and overt instances of violence including implied violence against women and the depiction of a murder. While not explicit, there are implied moments of intimacy between Judith and Bluebeard."
