        "text": "The success of Franz Lehár’s Die lustige Witwe was not only sensational and widespread, it was unpredicted – the play on which it is based had, after all, been around for over forty years. When it was being prepared for its first performance in Vienna, the manager of the Theater an der Wien, Wilhelm Karczag, exhibited little faith in its prospects. Its conquest of the stages of Europe and its appeal to the wider world was a possibility unforeseen. That is why it makes sense to name it as the foundation stone of the Silver Age of operetta. There may have been stage works of the time that had a longer continuous run in one country or another, but Die lustige Witwe had a cosmopolitan appeal that reached across borders. The most successful stage work in the UK in the first half of the twentieth century was Chu Chin Chow, but nowhere else in the world did it achieve anywhere near the same number of performances as did the West End production. In January 1908, London’s Daily Mail claimed that The Merry Widow had been performed 450 times in Vienna, 400 times in Berlin, 350 times in St Petersburg, 300 times in Copenhagen, and was currently playing every evening in Europe in nine languages. In the USA, five companies were presenting it, and ‘the rush for tickets at the New Amsterdam Theatre’ was likened to ‘the feverish crowding round the doors of a threatened bank’. Stan Czech, in his Lehár biography, claims that by 1910 it had been performed ‘around 18,000 times in ten languages on 154 American, 142 German, and 135 British stages’.\n\nAfter try-outs in several American cities, The Merry Widow opened at the New Amsterdam on Broadway on 21 October 1907, where its reception was seen by critics as an indication that audience standards were rising, an opinion that gave comfort to American operetta composers such as Reginald De Koven and Victor Herbert. So well known did the operetta become that a burlesque version was produced in January 1908 at the Weber and Fields Music Hall, New York. It used Lehár’s music, but had a new parodic script by George V. Hobart that cast Lulu Glaser as Fonia from Farsovia (rather than Sonia from Marsovia) and Joe Weber as the messenger Disch (instead of Nisch). Henry W. Savage, the manager of the New Amsterdam, granted permission for the parody, knowing that it would increase interest in his own production, which went on to enjoy a run of 416 performances.\n\nAnyone studying the reception of German operettas in the UK and USA is bound to recognize that the productions in the West End and on Broadway of The Merry Widow marked a distinctive new phase in operetta reception. Before The Merry Widow, the last German operetta to have a successful premiere in both London and New York was Carl Zeller’s Der Vogelhändler (produced first in Vienna in January 1891). It became The Tyrolean at the Casino, New York, in October 1891, and was given five performances in German at Drury Lane, London, four years later. Wiener Blut, an operetta of 1899 based on arrangements of the music of Johann Strauss Jr, was produced on Broadway as Vienna Life in early 1901, but had no outing in London. A much-revised version of Hugo Felix’s Berlin operetta Madame Sherry enjoyed modest success in London in 1903, but did not reach New York until 1910, when Felix’s music was replaced by that of Karl Hoschna.\n\nThe librettists of Wiener Blut were Victor Léon and Leo Stein, and in 1905 they were to gain further acclaim with their adaptation of Henri Meilhac’s L’Attaché d’ambassade as Die lustige Witwe. In December that year, set to music by Franz Lehár, it opened at the Theater an der Wien, and in May the following year was at the Berliner Theater. The year after, it was produced as The Merry Widow at Daly’s Theatre in London’s West End and, a few months later, was on Broadway. The English version by Basil Hood and Adrian Ross was used in both London and New York. George Edwardes’s West End production opened on 8 June 1907 and ran for a remarkable 778 performances. The actor-comedian George Graves, who played Baron Popoff in the operetta, looked back on the opening night in his autobiography of 1931, and declared: ‘Never have I known such wild enthusiasm as greeted this show.’ During and after the London run, The Merry Widow conquered the provinces, where it was performed at city theatres by the Edwardes touring companies and by what were known as ‘fit-up companies’ in Corn Exchanges, Town Halls, and other urban venues.\n\nThe massive success of The Merry Widow opened up a flourishing market for operettas from Vienna and Berlin. This was confirmed by the huge success of Straus’s The Chocolate Soldier in New York (1909) and London (1910). The stage works of Paul Lincke, who is credited as the founder of Berlin operetta with his one-act Die Spree-amazone of 1896, took time to travel. His ensemble song ‘Glühwürmchen’ from Lysistrata (1902) was familiar as an orchestral piece in London, and also featured in the Broadway show The Girl Behind the Counter (Talbot, 1907), but his operetta Frau Luna (1899), popular in Germany, was not produced in London until 1911 (as Castles in the Air, at the Scala Theatre ), and was not given at all in New York. In contrast, the Berlin operettas of Jean Gilbert were in demand in both London and New York. Other operettas – those of Victor Herbert excepted – were not doing well on Broadway following the success of The Merry Widow. Among the better, though unimpressive, statistics are: a run of 65 performances for Edward German’s Tom Jones at the Astor Theatre in late 1907, and 64 for Reginald De Koven’s Robin Hood at the New Amsterdam in 1912. John Philip Sousa’s The American Maid was given just 16 performances at the Broadway Theatre in 1913. Regular but short runs of Gilbert and Sullivan took place during 1910–13 at the Casino.\n\nWilliam Boosey comments that when he first went into publishing in the 1880s, French operetta was the dominant type, with Offenbach, Lecocq, Audran, and Planquette to the fore. Operetta from the German stage ousted the French variety after 1907, although the latter returned during the First World War, with performances of Cuvillier and Messager. This needs to be qualified, however, because Cuvillier’s biggest success in the West End was The Lilac Domino (1918), which originally had a German libretto, and Messager’s Monsieur Beaucaire (London, April 1919, New York, December 1919) was composed to an English book by Frederick Lonsdale, with lyrics by Adrian Ross. Cuvillier’s French operetta, Afgar, was produced at the Pavilion, London in 1919, and the Central Theatre, New York, in 1920. A reason Paris was failing in the new operetta market was given by the American book and lyric writer Harry B. Smith, who remarked after a visit in 1909: ‘The revue was the only kind of musical piece in evidence.’ Nevertheless, the operettas of Henri Christiné, Maurice Yvain, and Reynaldo Hahn, proved successful in Paris, despite a puzzling lack of international interest in them. The number of successful musical plays and operettas had, in fact, been declining in Paris after 1900. Between 1900 and 1914, 22.5 per cent of such pieces had runs of 100 performances or more in London, but only 5.7 per cent did so in Paris."
