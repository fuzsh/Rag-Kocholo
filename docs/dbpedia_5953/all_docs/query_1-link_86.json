        "text": "On the occasion of the 9 May 2024 staged premiere of the new 90 minute staged version of I Hear America Singing co-produced by Aria412 and the New Mercury Collective at the Rauh Studio Theater in Pittsburgh ten years to the day after the staged premiere of the show’s first 60 minute commercial incarnation, commissioned in 2013 by Skylight Opera Theater in Milwaukee, I’m taking a beat as author and director to get all this down before moving on to the next thing.\n\nA decade ago, the assignment was to create a musical revue that celebrated American song. I elected, instead of providing arrangements of various tunes with the usual between-song patter, to crawl into the mind of Robbie Doerfler, an aging Broadway composer struggling with a midlife crisis and a decade-long bout of writer’s block. What does a blocked composer do when they come up short? Variations, of course, which Robbie calls “recontextualizations” as he pages through not only the American songbook but the Lomax Collection, warming up gradually until, with the final songs of the show, he’s found his voice again and is, to his existential relief and his friends’ delight, composing “his own” music again.\n\nOnce strapped in to that musical conceit, I wrote a book that would consist of sequentially “closing circles.” Desperate for a personal and professional comeback, composer Robbie invites two graduate school friends instrumental in the launch of his once-promising career who’ve moved on in their lives back to New York where he hopes to revise and put on a backer’s audition for a new production of the show that made him famous that he hopes will both mend his malaise and their friendships. His friends, Rose and Roger, are the sort of couple that falls in and out of love seasonally; Robbie determines to bring them back together for good as he “mends” himself. As the show coalesced in Milwaukee, the core theme of music’s role as an engine not just of entertainment but of healing and bringing people together grew. The “artistic merry-go-round” postmodernist creative stance Robbie (in the play) and I (as composer of Robbie’s world) took in order to survive suited the theme and satisfied the producers.\n\nAs a composer, I can’t resist (as most chefs cannot resist asking their guest what ingredients they think may have been used in their entrée’s creation) divulging the songs that I used as touchstones for the score. They’re all treated musically with the sort of loving familiarity composers tend as a whole to show shared cultural artifacts, and often (if one isn’t acquainted intimately with how the original sounds) don’t really sound all that much like the public domain songs whose musical DNA they inherit.\n\nI began with a fairly straightforward arrangement of The Vacant Chair, a very popular song of composer George F. Root, with text by Henry S. Washburn composed in 1861. The second song took the first two bars of Burt Bacharach and Hal David’s song A House is Not a Home, recorded by Dionne Warwick in 1964 and featured in their Broadway show Promises, Promises and combined them with a duet written when I was fifteen for a musical called Together for a foray into mid-century American M.O.R. (It is always fun to see who in the audience visibly exhibits aesthetic PTSD when they hear 70s soft rock; in this case, it explicitly conveys the tone of Roger and Rose’s marriage and the cultural milieu in which it unfolded.) Next, I turned to the Navy Hymn (Eternal Father, Strong to Save), using the chord progression but overlaying a new tune. I had at the time just finished composing the opera Amelia for Seattle Opera, into the score of which I had threaded the Naval Hymn, so it was on my mind.\n\nHaving taken the chords from one well-known song and overlaying a new tune, I turned to John Philip Sousa’s 1894 classic march The Stars and Stripes Forever, rearranging it harmonically, adding lyrics, and having Rose sing the piccolo obbligato. Great fun. I then turned to what began as a \"crossover song” (part art song, part American Songbook vibe) from my own back catalogue, teasing it into its dramaturgical function as a deal breaker by adding new lyrics and counter-melodies to form the ensemble number called Our Love’s Absence.\n\nHaving spent a lot of time with the Appalachian folk ballad known by dozens of names, including Over Yondro while composing a long-lined passacaglia based on it for my violin concerto Songbook, I had lots of material left over, so the next song—a richly harmonized scena duet, scarcely touches on the original tune and chord progression, but retains the folk flavor of a ballad that has inspired literally hundreds of covers and recontextualizations. I then went to Lomax and dropped into my score some a capella verses from Rye Whisky, first recorded and released by Fiddlin' John Carson in 1926 to set up a song where I alternated lyrics attributed to former Confederate major James Innes Randolph overlaid on a tune derived from the Northern minstrel troupe stage song Joe Bowers with lyrics and melody drawn from the song The Picture Graved Into My Heart from the civil war song cycle Dear Youth, in which I set a letter of Hannah Ropes written on December 27, 1862 describing a dying soldier. (A lot to unpack, to be sure, but, sadly, still timely.)\n\nFor the 2024 revival and film, I pulled the next song from the original staged version of the show and inserted a brand new one called The Let Us Song which doesn’t owe any progenitors much of anything except that it is fast, fun, and a lighthearted answer to the Leonard Bernstein song Storyette H.M. from Songfest — the gimme, a repeated canonic fragment of the words “let us,” is silly, but earned. Bernstein’s setting of Gertrude Stein opens the door to my own Curtis Institute-era setting of Stein’s I am Rose which is redolent of … me, I guess, and then a (veddy-veddy serious) setting of Blake’s Sick Rose that I actually did compose as a graduate student at Juilliard. (Combining material of my own / my personal history with found material / American musical history was one of the many methods I employed to stay “on point” and to avoid veering into pastiche.)\n\nThe next scene is underpinned by my new treatment of When I Was Single, adapted from two versions of the Scottish Highlands children’s song recorded by Lomax in 1949 (Lomax, pp. 154-158). I turned then to a ridiculous setting I made of A.E. Houseman as a senior in high school called O, When I Was in Love With You (which is itself a sendup of Flanders and Swan) followed by a Mills Brothers-style vocal treatment (with new lyrics) of the folk song Old Bachelor (Lomax, pp. 354-355), recorded by Lomax in 1949, which I turned into a gay pride anthem for Robbie. (One of the pleasures of working with a singer/composer/conductor/pianist like Robert Frankenberry is the fact that, when he senses the direction I am going, he’ll “double down” if he can: he did so with the last verse of Bachelor, pulling it hard into a deliciously cringy 90s “popera” that makes an indelible impression.)\n\nI followed that with (And Then) I Let Him Go, an adaptation of Liza Jane, an Appalachian fiddle tune recorded by Lomax in 1937 (pp. 284-285). For the 2024 film and revival, I contributed a new song for Roger called To Stop Time, about alcoholism, with fresh, very-much-Hagen music and lyrics. (The dramaturgical strategy was to violently whiplash from the jazz hands tone of Bachelor to the gritty, “realistic” tone of my preferred brand of opera.) This is followed by Robbie’s “from the heart” eleven o’clock number I Believe in Song, which, in the chorus, uses the same descending chord progression (but my own tune, of course) as the Gershwin brothers’ 1924 popular standard The Man I Love from Lady Be Good and adds my own Kern-ian bridge and verse.\n\nAs an American composer born in 1961 I am a Latchkey child—a member of the first year of what is typically referred to as Generation X—sandwiched between the Millennials and the Boomers, my relationship to what constitutes “beautiful singing” has matured along lines parallel to my maturation as a person.\n\nAs a sixteen-year-old composer manque, I was enmeshed in the white-hot burn of the first four words of the poem. Singing was just that. I was taught to sing “correctly” and “well” in the Lutheran and Anglican choral traditions by superb chorus teachers, but I also grooved to (and appreciated the artistry of) “off the voice” folk singers, Bob Dylan, and the first generation of amplified rock musicians whose vocal training was often nil. By the time I landed in Madison, I was earning beer money plowing through the Twenty-Four Italian Songs and Arias with voice majors, having for years appreciated the exhilarating vocalisms of Cathy Berberian, the magnificently balanced tone of Barbara Streisand, the splendid phrasing of Frank Sinatra, the emotionally undeniable wisdom of Maria Callas, and the nuanced, Fellini-esque meta-authenticity of Peter Pears.\n\nTwo years later, studying with Ned, I learned (but was not taught) why Samuel Barber’s vocal writing was considered more “elegant” than Gian Carlo Menotti’s, and, with gently relentless reminders, encouraged to find Menotti’s vocal writing somehow “theatrical” in nature and therefore less refined. I had already accompanied many of Ned’s early, Billie-Holiday-meets-Francis-Poulenc songs (which I adored) and had begun to process why, when prominent “vocal coaches” were invited to coach Rorem or Barber, they usually chose Barber. But I was in the full flower of lines four and five, composing my first big opera, Shining Brow, and, from today’s standpoint, the vocal writing that I consciously emulated combined Benjamin Britten’s muscular modernism and Stephen Sondheim’s theatrical practicality.\n\nAge came to me “with equal grace” when I rejected the hierarchization that vocal partisans place on “singing styles.” I remember the moment. It was in Texas sometime during the 90s. I had been engaged to present a masterclass at a college that was producing one of my operas, and was coaching a young singer on a performance of Ned’s “Early in the Morning,” which I had been coached on by Ned a few times over the years with various singers. The delightful vocalist was crooning away at a moderately slow clip (I approved—after all, the Holiday factor, on which Ned doubled down when he sang his own music at the piano), finished, and it was time for me to speak up. I recalled that Ned — every single time I played it for him — always had two things to say: “play it faster, and don’t ‘sell’ it.” So, I told the singer the same thing, making it clear that the comment came from Ned, not me. The singer sang it again, faster, and without the Holiday vibe. It sounded more like the way Ned would have liked it; but it didn’t sound the way that singers like to sing it, and audiences, by and large, prefer to hear it. Behind me, in the back of the room, the singer’s teacher (or coach—I don’t recall which) nodded vigorously “no-no-no.”\n\nEver since, all “singing styles” have had, to me, “equal, grace, force, fascination.” I mix “singing styles” not only as an efficient way to help mainstream listeners to differentiate characters and to subvert the conception of what constitutes “class,” but to invite audience members with preconceived notions of what constitutes not just “good” and “bad” singing, but “good” and “bad” taste out of their intellectual and aesthetic complacence—to move them to embrace a broader conception of what constitutes “beautiful singing.”\n\nAlthough the difference between musical theater acting singers and operatic singing actors is not absolute, musical theater acting singers typically lean into characterization and operatic singing actors focus, because their audience requires it, on beauty of sound. A musical theater singer can be a Stanislavskian, or a Method actor, literally feeling the emotions that the character is experiencing, because their audience interprets their “getting choked up” as emotional authenticity.\n\nTo maintain proper alignment of the instrument, most opera singers are taught that they cannot risk allowing a Strasbergian remembrance of experience to get them literally verklempt. Consequently, Classical acting is their usual go-to, as it requires “sticking to the script,” which composers and conductors appreciate. The chamber musician in them cottons to the sort of finding of truth through ensemble building of the Meisner method. Authenticity through collective imagination allows the muscles to remain aligned, and the voice to emerge, physically “unaffected” by the emotion conveyed.\n\nSo, what’s the point? I don’t compose for the singers that I can afford, I write for the people singing. Sometimes I get it wrong. But I try to learn from the experience. Once I wrote a role for a Big Star who, in the practice room, sang the role for me as I wrote it for them, but—when they stepped on to the stage—reverted to the way they had sung the role before I had coached them. It was a heartbreaking moment, because I had given them material that would have changed the course of their career, paving the way to the character roles that would have continued to feed them artistically into their sixties, even seventies. But they had mouths to feed, management with which to contend, a public that had decided who they were. Singing is a brutal profession.\n\nNow I am at the “millions of suns” stage of my life as a vocal composer. Long as my stance has been that there is only singing that lands and singing that doesn’t, and that abstract “beauty of sound” is a precious thing, but it is not the Only Thing, I have come to feel a bit like Gusteau in Ratatouille, who feels that “everyone can cook.” No, I am not a gourmand; of course I can tell the difference. But I am drawn to authenticity above all. The rest is exquisite artifice. If I hear you sing, and I tell you that I think you sing beautifully, I mean it.\n\nIt was always time with David. He bent it; he warped it; he turned it around back on itself; he lived outside of it; he could practically stop it with music; in life, he ran with it until he ran out of it.\n\nThe day in March 2019 that my memoir was published and offered up to the crickets I put all my handwritten diaries—over thirty years’ worth of scribbling—into banker’s boxes and sealed them up. I traded the false specificity of reportage for the even more subjective truth of memory. Now I must pour, as Ned Rorem and his teacher Virgil Thomson used to, through the index of my book to fix events in time. I recall reading the words that I wrote about David to him over the telephone and asking whether he thought they were okay before sending off the manuscript. (He did.)\n\nSo, on this March 2024 morning I tried to find my letters to David (and his to me) and discovered that I’d have to move two portable air conditioners, a box fan, and two suitcases to get to the file drawer in the storage closet in which letters from all the D’s in my life ended up so I gave up. They’re in there—all the postcards with Mad Hatters and March Hares stamped on them, words jumping off the page limned in multiple colors (he always had a glass or peanut butter jar filled with different colored pens and pencils on his desk at whatever artist colony or home he was working) with little, crazy asides added in at the last moment. Anyone who received a letter from David knew they could expect an illuminated manuscript of sorts. He took time to write them. They were vibrant, gossipy, funny, and sweet. His communications were always labor-intensive; details mattered: sometimes a sentence would march on in blue ink and end with a single bright red exclamation point.\n\nSince I no longer particularly trust my own memory, I paged through my “Work Log and List of Themes,” a notebook I’ve kept since July 1976 (and which, ominously, is entirely filled up, with no more blank pages to accommodate new work—a nightmare scenario for someone as superstitious and obsessive as me), to determine which artist colonies (and when) David and I had had overlapping residencies over the years (since I always finished something and made note of where I was when I finished it) to fix some dates in advance of a chat with his biographer the other day. So, the chronology of this Mad March through Time is underpinned by the several vignettes that I included in my memoir and the (many more) exactly-dated marginalia (“Sang through this with DDT in the music room,” or “Bowings revised per DDT,” and the like.) from my “Work Log.”\n\nDavid and I overlapped several times during the 80s at the Virginia Center for the Creative Arts and MacDowell—always the four hands, me sight-reading through whatever song he was working on and ending up laughing with joy; him sightreading whatever song I was writing and me singing them. “Why do we have to write for singers?” he would ask, “We know they can sing it beautifully; but isn’t it more fun to hear someone who can’t sing perform it?” (I couldn’t help but notice that the thought had come to him after accompanying me.) In 1990, David was serving as composer-in-residence for the New York Philharmonic, and, although he never took credit, likely made possible my music’s debut with the Philharmonic—a piece called Common Ground, which had recently been awarded the Kennedy Center Friedheim Prize.\n\nWhen David went away on sabbatical during the 90s I’d teach for him at City University of New York. Composition lessons, of course; but also counterpoint and orchestration. I was also on the faculty of Bard College at the time (and for a couple of semesters, the Curtis Institute), and he enjoyed, I think, the fact that I, like him, didn’t consider myself an academic. “Teaching gives me physical pain, doesn’t it you?” he once asked as we packed his station wagon—he off to another colony, and me back to the Upper West Side and a semester of filling in for him. He was only partly serious. David could be a superb teacher. And when he went to artist colonies he—like me—always worked like a dog. We’d run into one another raiding the refrigerator either very, very late or very, very early—the only two “inmates” still awake and working and ask one another how it was going. “I can’t tell you or it will turn to shit,” I would say. And he would say, “I know. Hide the erasers.” If there was cheesecake or dessert of any sort to be had, we’d finish it together. Always, the next day, I’d be jogging it off; David would be pumping iron at the local gym. I sent him five or six of my students when it was their time to move on over the years and don’t regret it.\n\nTime together at the keyboard was something he shared with lots of other musicians, and I am sorry if I give the impression I was the only one who enjoyed the privilege. I loved him for the force of nature that was his talent, the grace with which he carried it, and the super-hard work that he did, year after year, to honor it. He modelled a working composer to me more than Ned or Virgil because he kept revising and improving everything. Like everyone who knew him, I am devasted by the irony that a man who exulted in the lifelong physicalizing of his music at the keyboard became afflicted with Parkinson’s Disease.\n\nDuring a visit to Sag Harbor in the mid 90s, I recall him playing the entirety of his opera Dum Dee Tweedle and experiencing more keenly than ever how his obsessive use of melodic and harmonic sequences (either telescoping them to run faster through diminution, or more slowly through extension or metric modulation) skewed one’s perception of time. My memory’s a little foggy, but I think that when he finished, I felt as though he had been playing for about forty minutes only to look at my watch to see that 90 had elapsed. Repetition was talismanic for him as a composer, I think; it could summon emotional lightness or darkness. If tonality was redemptive to him, then his compositional apotheosis came through such a profound compression of harmonic and melodic movement that it felt dissonant—Liszt on steroids.\n\nAlthough the difference between videographers and cinematographers is not absolute, typically, videographers focus on reportage and cinematographers focus on storytelling. One engages a videographer to document a family event, or to craft training videos, or to sell products, of course; but they also serve as photojournalists and moral witnesses—think of them as bodycams on the body politic. Videographers and their crews collaborate with documentary filmmakers to bring important, often dangerous stories to light.\n\nGuided by the director’s storyboards and / or the shooting script, cinematographers typically oversee a larger crew within a more sprawling collaborative ecosystem. As director of photography, they create and manage the artificially constructed super-reality in which the director’s story unfolds. Their bag of tricks includes optical effects during production, and computer-generated imagery in post, and they can make the inanest narrative material look, at least, as though a meaningful story is being told.\n\nThe Magical Realist story I told was set in a real world (or was it?) Italian bistro in Little Italy the night before the attack on the World Trade Center. Simultaneously, the bistro was a magical Underworld peopled by mythological figures—in this case, a violinist named Charon, a bartender named Orpheus, and a singer on the radio named Eurydice. I depicted the “real” world as having an undercurrent (see what I did there?) of magic or fantasy, along the lines of Toni Morrison’s Beloved in which Sethe is haunted by her daughter, or by the morality teleplays of Rod Serling’s Twilight Zone—but most like the gentle strain of it explored by the writers of shows like Northern Exposure.\n\nI was given the great learning opportunity with 9/10 to simultaneously direct (in a three-quarter thrust theatrical staging) a silver cast of graduate students at the Chicago College of Performing Arts while filming it with the gold cast of professionals (members of my New Mercury Collective) on location. While describing the highly enjoyable process of staging it theatrically is the stuff of a different essay, I can report that, in the theater, the collective reality built up by the ensemble was experienced from the audience’s point of view. For the live performance staging, I leaned into the traditional Music Theater tropes in it—highlighting the four “I was I am I want” arias and playing the drift into symbolism (when the characters pay Charon) like Chekhov—as a gentle heightening of poetic tone and a celebration of live theater’s call for communal experience.\n\nBy contrast, I directed the film as I had storyboarded it, from the “magical” point of view of Orfeo, the bartender—a role that I originally wrote for myself, but handed over to my assistant director, the gifted (and photogenic) composer / writer Cameron Dammann once production began. (I took on the more Hitchcockian role of Mors, proprietor of the Passaggio, and appear in the background periodically.)\n\nI was fortunate as author / director to collaborate with director of photography Talal Jabari, a filmmaker with several decades of experience. Together, we combined aspects of both videography and cinematography to the shooting of 9/10. The visual narrative’s “magical” context of the Ristorante Passaggio was provided by four stationary cameras operated by local Chicago technicians Aaron Gottl and Matthew Peckham, who also rode the levels on the live recording. Thus, the principal characters were audio-recorded and visually documented both in live performance and for insert safety/coverage shoots in medium and wide shots. As their emotions intensified, I used tight shots either forced in post or shot by Talal with a flycam. In other words: we took the onion of cinematography, added the celery of videography, added the carrot of my directorial stance; then sautéed them in the olive oil of live performance, and arrived at this project’s visual vocabulary.\n\n3. Coordinating Visual Language, Character, and Musical Structure\n\nEyes closed, I felt the tissue paper hugging my neck’s nape, the shawl nestled at my Adam’s apple, the occasional pressure of a single finger adjusting the angle of my head gently, but firmly, like a pianist giving an A. I smelled the orange spice opening of hand-mixed shaving cream, the sandalwood follow-up of hand soap, the tang of Barbicide, the masculine smell of Pinaud Clubman. The shears snipped in thoughtful bursts at a moderate walking tempo. Andante, I thought. “First I do the beard,” he said. “Yes,” I murmured, not opening my eyes.\n\nThere had as yet been no electric razor’s angry buzz, no rushed swipes of a “number two” doing the thinking—it had all been done by hand. It has been decades since I’d last heard the intimate, conversational cadence of old-fashioned barbering. It made me think of the rhythm of my mother’s work sounds as she sculpted me when I was a boy.\n\nPausing, he asked, “Will you check my work on your beard?” I opened my eyes, reached for my glasses, performed the universal male gesture of running my thumb down one cheek, the rest of my fingers down the other, and closing them, like a prayer, below my chin while turning my head left, then right. “Perfect,” I smiled, taking off my glasses and placing them back on the shelf beneath the enormous mirror.\n\nHis jacket was as white as his hair. About eighty, I thought. “I am finding this haircut oddly comforting,” I remarked. “That’s good,” he said. “Something about not using the razor.” “Ah,” he replied, “you noticed.” The silence for a few beats that feels so natural between a good barber or barkeep and his client. “It was not the way I was taught to cut hair, you see,” he explained. I closed my eyes again as he began trimming my sideburns.\n\nOn a hunch, I asked, “Where was that?” He stopped. “Palermo,” he said, quietly. “I learned to cut hair by apprenticing for six years in a barbershop there until, one day, my boss said, ‘now you are ready,’ gave me a pair of scissors, a manual clipper, straight razors, and a brush, and showed me the door.”\n\nI recalled my composer friend Norman Stumpf asking Ned Rorem during a lesson in the early eighties whether Ned thought that he was “ready” to begin his career, and Ned responding, “You’re ready whenever you decide that you are.” My barber performed the customary blessing of matching the length of my sideburns with his knuckles. “Italy,” I mused. “Yes,” he said, reading my mind, “it is a shame about Venezia. Have you been there?”\n\nThe waves of emotion, followed by a simple, “Yes, many times.” “I have been only once,” he replied. “I took my wife to La Fenice, do you know it?” “Indeed I do,” I smiled, answering, “Venice’s jewel. One of the peak experiences of my life was visiting Ricordi in Milano and seeing the various performance sets for Verdi and Puccini.” His scissors stopped. “Ah.” Intense, shared emotion. “The opera.”\n\nHe worked on in silence, struggling with what to do with the thinning fistful of my hair fecklessly splayed across the exposed scalp growing like the hole in the ozone layer. “When did you come to the States?” I asked. “I was 18. My father applied when I was 13. The U.S. government would only allow him to bring one other family member. He chose me. My grandfather had to put a thousand dollars in the bank in order to show that we would be supported if we didn’t get work.” “Did you?” I asked. The scissors stopped. “I have always worked,” he replied. “Me, too,” I said, quietly. “Yes,” he said.\n\n“You are a musician,” he observed, simply. “Of course,” I replied, gently. “My three sons all played instruments. They are in their fifties now. Music kept them out of trouble, and at home.” “Yes,” I replied, “that is good. You must be proud of them.” A caesura in which pictures were drawn down off the mirror. I pulled some snaps of my sons up on the phone. Silence. He reached for his tools. The smell of the talc, the pat-pat-pat as he worked it into my hair; the scraping of his comb; the slight twinge of pain as he hit a blemish.\n\nI thought of an astonishingly personal, cruel, intellectually shallow, and factually inaccurate review of my memoir onto which I had recently stumbled. I had already forgotten the critic’s name. Most kinds of writing don’t require any bravery—criticism least of all—but publishing a memoir is scary; it is one of the kinds of writing that requires courage. I found mine. My book wasn’t confessional—there were no surprises in it for people who knew me—but it was intended to be a work of art that would, in Cesar A. Cruz’s words, “comfort the disturbed and disturb the comfortable.” I had spent the first three months of 2019 finalizing the manuscript, and then correcting proofs, making an index, gathering permissions, choosing photos, and so forth. Sending off the final galleys to the publisher, I had thought of the story of the annoyed senior composer who, having just played a recording of her work for an impertinent student in a masterclass, responded to his glib vitriol with a mild, “Next time, you write it.”\n\nI thought of yesterday’s visit to the cardiologist, who, after examining the various diagnostic tests that had been run on my heart, said, “Your heart is getting larger.” When I smiled ruefully, he replied, “That’s not a good thing.” As I do every holiday season, I reminded myself that dealing with grief and depression is not a competition; neither should it be concealed or denied; there’s plenty of anguish to go around.\n\nI thought of my youngest, at the doctor’s office with his mother; my oldest, at school grappling with adolescence. The barber loosened the tissue paper at the nape of my neck and applied a little shaving cream. “Your boys are handsome,” I observed, handing him back the pictures as his straight razor scraped across my jugular. “We are lucky men, yes?” He accepted the snapshots, wiped my neck clean with a warm, wet cloth, spun the chair around and whipped the shawl from my shoulders. “So are yours,” he smiled, “and, yes, we are.”\n\nI looked at the barber’s honest work in the mirror; I took in the aging, soul-weary face of the man who looked back at me, and reached for a way forward. You are not Aschenbach, and he is not the hotel barber; this visit to your barber tells a profoundly different story. I nodded affirmatively to my reflection, and said, “Right, this is how a man does it.”\n\n“Now you are ready,” he said.\n\nLouis Krasner was the shortest person in the room, but he undoubtedly cast by far the longest shadow. The summer’s fellowship composers (of which I was one during summer 1985) arrayed themselves easily, thoughtlessly, like bolts of cloth, with the bodily flexibility available only to the young, over, and around sticks of furniture in the living room at Seranak—onetime home of Serge and Natalia Koussevitzky, and by that time, serving as a venue for the Tanglewood Festival. We were gathered for an oral history lesson (one he’d clearly presented before and would present again) from the person who had premiered not only Alban Berg’s, but also Arnold Schoenberg’s monumental violin concertos—a man not only present but literally instrumental in bringing about their existence.\n\nObserving as a child that my parents customarily inscribed the date and place that they had acquired books on the title page, I had long followed suit; so, I knew that the Universal study score of the Berg concerto I was holding had been purchased at Patelson’s (lamented emporium behind Carnegie Hall) on 18 April 1983, after a lesson with Lukas Foss, whose astonishment that I did not yet know the piece (there certainly was a lot that I didn’t know then that I know now—and I have learned the obvious fact that the more you know the less you know) transformed in a beat to wild enthusiasm and joy as he sat down without a score in front of him and played for me at the piano the climactic moment—the hochpunkt at measure 125 of the second movement—singing in his own octave the solo violin part.\n\nNobody had a cell phone back then, and I don’t think that it would have occurred to any one of us to bring a tape recorder. We were surrounded by history: Leon Kirchner was our teacher; Maurice Abravanel perambulated and dispensed wisdom every afternoon; John Adams listened to our music one afternoon before attending a rehearsal of his brand new Harmonielehre; Bernstein was due in a week or two and would listen to our music and spend the evening in this same room, cross-legged on the floor, talking about Art and the Bomb. Knowing that I was a witness to something important I pulled a ballpoint pen out and began to transcribe Louis’ words; the only paper at hand was my study score, so I wrote on that.\n\n“The Schoenberg concerto is certainly the equal of the Berg,” he began. “Though not as popular, even if it takes a hundred years, it will become the pride of violinists. The Berg, sentimental, with a requiem story, had everything going for it. The Schoenberg, when Stokowski finally programmed it, was rejected twice before being accepted. There was no fee involved; Stoki paid me out of his own pocket.”\n\n“Stoki,” he continued, “was the ‘Glamorous One,’ but he forced the check on me and made the subsequent performances possible of the Berg and Schoenberg concertos in the States. People should know that. Stoki was really the first performance of the Berg in the States—before Koussy. Mitropoulos was one of the greatest proponents of contemporary music. He would sleep for only four hours a night. He got his reward—by dying on the podium at La Scala.”\n\nI looked around. It was plain that we all knew that we were hearing something special. Louis had known Schoenberg, Webern, and Berg. He had been there. “These three men were complicated, but the period in which they lived was the fermentation of world calamity—in a way, we are still in that time. Webern was gentle, humble, frail (like Bartok)—very intense. About Webern all you could see were suspicious, blazing eyes. Devoted to his family—religious, with a family stretching back to the 1500s. I went with Webern from Vienna to Barcelona at a time when Berg died—December of 1936—I was in New York and involved with a new string quartet. I withdrew in order to play the Berg for the ISCM in Barcelona. I dropped everything and went to Vienna. Webern came and was to conduct it but withdrew. No one knew it but him. I said ‘let me go’ to Webern and they said, ‘No! He’s in too emotional a state’.”\n\n“Finally, I went to him and played through it with him. He finally relented. One ticket to Barcelona went through Germany. In Munich we got off the train and he bought me a beer. Back on the train he said, ‘so has anybody harmed you?’ He was so naive. And of course, we talked about it for the rest of the night after we’d gotten to Switzerland.”\n\nAt this point, he read a statement of Arnold Schoenberg, which he had translated himself: “We believed with sacrificial readiness in ideals once perceived and we never would/could have left these. Or given them up. Even if one had succeeded in misleading us. One must always think of us as Webern, Schoenberg, and Berg together.”\n\nPutting the paper down, Krasner continued in his own words, “Schoenberg had great reservations about Webern as he had been taken in by the Nazis. In 1938, just before the war, I got back to the US from Vienna; I was told that Schoenberg was looking for me. Schoenberg had written an effusive dedication to Webern and I lied when asked whether Webern had been taken in by the Nazis. Steuerman and Schoenberg knew I was lying, but I am glad that I lied…. The terrible torment one can suffer in such a situation—the political situation was terrible, the Fascists wanted to overthrow (putsch) the Socialists. The city of Vienna (Socialists) supported Webern-s music. These Socialists were not Communists. And all his friends—Jews, Gentiles alike—were still there. His daughters’ husbands were both high-ranking Nazis…. Think of the suffering of this sensitive man being torn between the supporters of his music and his family.”\n\n“I saw Webern several times after that and once I was playing the Schoenberg concerto and the 4 o’clock broadcast where the prime minister announced the German invasion of Austria and Austria’s capitulation. He said, ‘Get out as fast as you can!’ and I barely escaped.”\n\n“After the war, I went back to Schoenberg’s house in Vienna and heard about Webern’s life during the war. I was told about the self-torture and guilt he went through. He saw that it wasn’t like that Munich restaurant at all. In ’37, the Vienna Philharmonic was already [filled with] undercover Nazis. Klemperer programmed Berg and many refused to play. The concert with Klemperer came off because Rosé came and played concertmaster. As soon as it was over they left the stage, leaving me, Klemperer, and Rosé alone on stage. Webern was in this position during the war.”\n\n“Right after the Anschluss these men came with their armbands to rehearsals. All this Webern witnessed. Schoenberg’s son told me this—and his guilt (he hadn’t done anything) was terrible. When the Russians came into the city, Webern fled to Salzburg. Webern stepped out to light a cigarette during curfew and was shot…. Schoenberg’s son said that it was ‘suicide by a third hand.’ I see in that, for Webern, it was his redemption—when he was able to die by a bullet from the other side, he was freed.”\n\n“Webern did not go to Barcelona, Scherchen did. In London Webern did a very good job with me on the BBC who gave him as much rehearsal time as he needed. The three of them didn’t have a jealousy—I wish there were a better word—but when I got Schoenberg’s concerto he said, ‘This is no Berg concerto; this is much more difficult!’ I asked Webern when he would write a violin concerto but he didn’t get to it. I found a letter six years ago from Webern to me where he suggested beginning a solo violin sonata (which I had suggested). Part of my strength with these men was that I was not filled with awe and trepidation of them. I was too stupid to know better. So I said to Webern will you write me a solo piece?”\n\n“So, somewhere in Webern’s papers there may exist a solo sonata.”\n\nIn the center sits a white-haired man gazing intently out at the harlequins, his chin buried in his hand like Rodin’s Thinker. On the far right, the cradled impartial snout of a Sony a7siii camera eavesdrops. On the far left, a woman reclines in her chair, pinky to chin, coolly appraising the bespectacled, anguished man kneeling a few feet away. He’s gripping the back of a chair, looking down at the floor at something obscured from view by a table on which glittering glassware and the remains of an Italian meal float on a tablecloth whose pristine whiteness is blemished by the pale stain of a spilt glass of red wine.\n\nWhat Unseen Thing is he looking for? Why is he distraught? Standing behind and to the right of the Thinker, like a trio of angels in a Renaissance painting, two women flank a bearded man, their faces compassionate, filled with love as they witness from above the man’s distress. Between them and the kneeling man, seated at the table with the Thinker, a phlegmatic balding man presents his back to the kneeler; he looks purposefully towards the woman across the table from him who stares at the kneeling man with lips drawn in a line of what appears to be puzzled discomfort. Behind her sits a white-haired, bearded man in a tweed jacket who observes the scene with one hand set on the rail beside him as though about to strike a chord.\n\nTo his left a bald man and his wife share an unobstructed view of the cause of the kneeling man’s distress. She holds her menu and smiles sadly, gently, ruefully; he regards the kneeling man with the same seeming precognition and warm, clinical detachment a doctor does his patients. Someone with a bob of straight blonde hair entirely unaware of the scene unfolding behind her is seated very close to our point of view: her nearness causes our gaze to bounce to the mysterious blond woman furthest from us, standing directly behind and slightly to the left of the Thinker.\n\nShe is the last person we notice but in her familiar yet remote, otherworldly demeanor and in the placement of her hands she reveals the key to reading the tableaux: her hands are folded, indicating, as they do on Victorian gravestones, the relationship between the person who has died, and the loved ones left behind. She symbolizes loss, but also reunion in the next life.\n\nThe composition of this frame and the fact that it, like all the wide shots in 9/10: Love Before the Fall, can be read similarly, is a manifestation of how the thing was made. It was storyboarded, of course; so, when I blocked it I knew where people would be arrayed in the tableaus, what the cameras would see. But the magic emerged from knowingly taking the risk of placing specific audience members with varying degrees of comfort with live performance in a situation where they would be pulled between their spontaneous human response to guerilla theater and their knowledge that they would be captured on film. Beforehand, in my role as director, I gave them only the most rudimentary set of instructions about how to behave: “Don’t look at the cameras,” I advised them. “Feel free to eavesdrop but be discrete as you would in real life. Enjoy your meal.”\n\nI only obliquely revealed to the extras (who, after having gone through the process, earned the sobriquet “Anime al Passaggio”) that the violinist was Charon, the bartender was Orpheus, the restaurant the bardo, and that the four singing characters would ultimately be called upon to confront their feelings about death: I wanted to capture each diner’s unpremeditated anxiety as they realized that they were not only witnessing, but party to, a tragedy.\n\nI knew that, whatever their unscripted responses, I would protect them, the principle singers, and the narrative through compassionate editing. Over the course of nine months I memorized what each of the four stationary cameras, and what cinematographer had captured with his handheld camera. I was taught some hard truths during that time about how my work and the situation affected each person in the room.\n\nThat’s why the picture above is worth reading carefully. I will never be able to effectively describe how it felt to be in that restaurant, witnessing from within (I was the old gent in the tweed jacket) those fiercely committed actors live those difficult roles in real time before not just the souls in the room but the cameras. I will never have the language to describe how it felt to serve as author, director, and editor. I can attest only that the entire creative family built, with bravery, honesty, and commitment, the piece from the ground up. I will never be able to thank them all enough. We knew that the story we were telling was about four relatively ordinary New Yorkers out on the town on a night that we now see in retrospect was an epochal inflection point.\n\nEach actor, each crew member, each production team member, everyone, gave their best knowing that that our project was a humble offering not only of remembrance, but a prayer for peace and an exhortation to love. For what the kneeling man in the tableau was looking for was incorporeal—evidence of that which cannot be seen. All four characters were striving, within the magic realist context in which they were placed, to connect with one another. They were searching for faith. It was what the kneeling man was looking for, and what he reconnected with as, moments later, he threw himself into his lover’s arms and, with his comrades, walked into what would come next.\n\n“Even if we cannot remember the question,” I told the cast before the shoot, “we know that the answer must unequivocally be love, or we are doomed.” These thousand words about a picture are dedicated to everyone who helped bring 9/10: Love Before the Fall to life.\n\n“Dear Maestro,” dazzled, seven-year-old-Daron wrote to conductor Kenneth Schermerhorn, then music director of the Milwaukee Symphony. I bit the end of my pencil, wracked my brain for the perfect word: “Your performance last week was simply superfluous!” Decades later, over lunch, I asked Kenneth if he remembered the boy who couldn’t find a word big enough to described how impressed he was. As he shook his head, laughing, I marveled at how indispensible Kenneth had made himself to the Nashville Symphony, what a noble example of service his career represented. We laughed until we wept. Afterwards, we wiped our eyes, and sighed. I called him “an indispensible man.”\n\nWe raised our glasses. “To Art,” I began. “To Life,” he replied. “To the collision of the two,” I said. “Ah,” he sighed, smiling, “now there is where the trouble begins.” And, to that, we drank.\n\nAnd then, as one does, I fished for his opposite. I immediately thought of Eugene Onegin, perhaps the most famous “superfluous man.” The eponymous, Byronic hero of Alexander Pushkin’s magisterial novel — a man who had it all, squandered it, and lived to regret it. No arriviste he, Onegin was a man of substance, well-educated, with access to culture, power, and the easy cynical ennui of one who understands firsthand that power corrupts. Poor Onegin, and his generation of noble young 1840s Russian men — so like the young Ivy-educated Masters of the Universe with whom I rubbed elbows as a young composer in 1980s Manhattan!\n\n1879. Thomas Edison patented the light bulb. AT&T and Bell Telephone divided up telecommunications, creating the framework for todays’ information-driven world. One hundred years after the “shot heard round the world” in Concord, “A Doll’s House” opened in Copenhagen, and Henrik Ibsen’s Nora perpetrated the door slam heard round the world. Her proto-feminism was also embodied in the character of Tatyana, as brought to life by Tchaikovsky in his great opera based on Pushkin’s verse novel. Another woman struggling to be herself in a male-dominated society, Tatyana, once her heart has been broken, evolves from her youth as a romantic, empathetic introvert into a coolly glittering, wise, ruthless, mistress of society.\n\nTchaikovsky subtitled his work “an opera in lyrical scenes.” This was to highlight the fact that, in fashioning the libretto from Pushkin’s 389 stanzas in iambic tetrameter with Konstantin Shilovsky, Pushkin’s dialectic was so ironclad that it made it possible for them to excise all the narrative linking material in order to focus on the dramaturgical “hot spots,” the nuclear reactors powering the drama. This distillation to the story’s essential human drama is (or should be) the aim of every poet-librettist, since brevity is only his visa at the opera world’s border, and getting directly to the point (without drawing attention to oneself) is his passport to greatness.\n\nPushing the idea of art mirroring life, the “Pushkin Sonnet,” or “Onegin Stanza” form is itself a tightly restrictive scheme that strikingly manifests the binding structures of society, of “social convention.” Form—in this case the characters—mirrors function—their symbolic and dramatic transits. Only sixty years later, in “Wozzeck,” the wretched disconnect between society and its denizens are made achingly manifest in the music often going in one direction as the drama moves in another.) Pushkin’s rhyme scheme, comprised of alternating “female” and “male” rhymes, is a suave poetic correlative to the characters’ gender dance.\n\nHere’s one reading of the structure of Pushkin’s story, and of Tchaikovsky’s opera, a rough sketch of the interrelationships between characters and themes. It’s why I think the structure’s so—for lack of a better word—perfect.\n\nGranted, melody is but one of the strands that make up musical expression; further, what constitutes a beautiful, or even “memorable” tune, is in the ear of the beholder. Factor in that tastes change: we’re always swinging back and forth, pendulum-like, generation to generation, from romanticism to modernism, like drunks sobering up after a binge, staying sober, and relapsing. After Wagner’s hyper-emotional Tristan und Isolde comes Debussy’s emotionally cool Pelléas et Mélisande where most of the frank emotionalism (summoned up by his utilization of all the music elements at his disposal—harmonic and melodic tension and release, dynamics, texture) is in the orchestra and, in an opera about love, “Je t’aime” is sung as though spoken, and in silence.\n\nI recall for two reasons a composition seminar at Juilliard in fall 1985 at which I presented my String Quartet No. 1. Present were our teachers, Milton Babbitt, Elliott Carter, Vincent Persichetti, and David Diamond, as well as about twenty fellow graduate composition students. I remember it primarily because Diamond chewed me out afterwards for “trivializing my work.” I was genuinely surprised by the admonition at the time because I had trusted that the work’s sturdy craftsmanship would speak for itself; that my breezy, self-assured presentation of my musical analysis (I was proud of the fact that every note could be justified both through serial and tonal procedures) would be interpreted as simply unpretentious, and not anti-intellectual. I’m afraid that I never quite embraced David’s advice to “be more respectful of the excellence of your own work in public.”\n\nThe second takeaway I recall because it came from an unexpected source. Milton had raised only one point during the question-and-answer portion of the presentation: he had observed that, on the chalkboard behind me, I had mislabeled one of the pitches in my tone row. Chuckling, I had taken no offense, but rather had simply made the correction and sallied into my analysis. Observing my dressing down by the furious Diamond, he came up to me and said, “You know, Daron, it seems to me you pay mightily for that soaring tune in the finale. Maybe ask yourself why.”\n\nThe signal I was probably trying to send all those years ago in that seminar was that talent can and should present itself as “easy.” As an upper-class socialite once asked me in a green room, “Why else would we all call what you musicians do ‘playing’?” Of course, I was not giving our shared labor the respect it deserved, so David was correct. But Milton’s point is the one that stays with me now that age and the years have made David’s advice moot.\n\nThe “soaring tune” to which Milton referred had been the third, most “ironed-out” version of the rondo’s fugue subject. I had intended that it trigger something close to what Milton had felt. I had felt it when I wrote it, and I trusted myself enough to commit to it. So there it was, a big wet Dionysian kiss in the middle of my highbrow Apollonian string quartet. Milton knew that it took “courage” to share a good tune, and that the first thing that someone looking to put you in your place does is to call it derivative. Why do I feel even now as though tunes have to be “earned?” Raised Lutheran—and, like many composers of my generation, taught to temper tunes with just enough “abstract” wrong notes to keep them from really taking off—I’ve always wrestled with the “unearned” bliss of unabashed, emotionally-frank lyricism. Early on, during the 90s, a New York Times critic wrote of my first opera that I had “a gift for big, sweeping tunes;” thirty years later, another Times critic thought that my latest opera contained “too much lyricism.” Right.\n\nI thanked Milton for the observation and sort of forgot about the advice that had followed. But, watching my son row with his mates in a shell on the Hudson in the driving rain from the safety of my car this morning, I was reminded that even the bliss of rowing at dawn on the Hudson on a perfect day has got to be earned by also putting out when the weather is inclement.\n\nBack in the day, Ned Rorem’s primly modernist Air Music (a terrific piece in which “there’s not a tune you can hum-bum-bum-be-dum”) won a Pulitzer, while his Sunday Morning (closer to his heart, more effusively melodic) garnered more love than respect. Some composers might say that it takes more courage to dish out a “big tune” with “soaring horn calls” than it does to craft honorable, abstract pieces just tuneful enough not to rile anyone up. After all, the old conventional wisdom runs, pieces with “good tunes” belong on pops concerts. A highly-tuneful work on a major orchestra’s subscription season can provoke conductorial winks to the audience and players. Diamond accused me of “not enough self-criticism” when what he meant was that I shouldn’t indulge in writing memorable tunes. In Tim Robbins’ Cradle Will Rock gloss, John Cusak, portraying Nelson Rockefeller (in this scenario, the upper class baddie), pours money into abstract art with Sarandon (as the amoral art dealer Sarfatti) on his arm because Rubén Blades’ Rivera (the dangerous artist moving between classes) makes art that riles up working class folks. Cue the Blitzstein. Next on our show: was Modernism a State Department / CIA Psy-Op? I enjoy the off the rails nature of that sort of read, whether it is true or not.\n\nSo what’s a tune if you denature it? Parlando. Gian Carlo Menotti pointed out to me once that “recitative and parlando are just foreplay.” I recall attending a performance of Jack Beeson’s opera My Heart’s in the Highlands and growing steadily more irritated that every time he was about to really break out into a memorable tune he cut himself short. Laughing, Bernstein described this affliction as “Tuneus Interruptus.” When Burt Bacharach died a few weeks ago, I recalled Babbitt’s advice to “ask myself why” again. Bacharach’s tunes, seemingly bubble-gummy, are actually tricky to sing; it is the composer’s struggle to be both catchy and smart that gives them their zest. The quip that Peter Shaffer puts into Emperor Joseph II’s mouth in Amadeus that there are “too many notes” shifted in the 20th century to something more insidious: now one runs the risk of putting in “too many pretty notes.” (Even more recently, the vogue is to slam “too much functional harmony.” What is the phrase? In lean times the rich are overweight; in fat times they are lean?\n\nHoward Pollack’s biography of Samuel Barber describes beautifully—and rightly—the upper-class Main Line Philadelphia society into which he was born. Ned, born into a middle-class Chicago family, composed increasingly modernist music as he aged. Like Ned, I was born into the middle-American middle-class. Unlike Ned, I found the acquisition of a Mid-Atlantic compositional accent (the whole “abstract” thing where textures and colors take the place of tunes so that other, less confrontational, factors can come to the fore) and the role of arriviste beside the point, as I was steadfastly committed to the pursuit of emotional nakedness, regardless of … “taste.” The chimera of what constitutes “good taste” is often used to beat down perceived competitors—as if making art is a contest! “Ladies and gentlemen, in this corner, the boxer from Tin Pan Alley; in the other, the pugilist from Lincoln Center.”\n\nAn artist who labors to conceal his craft is, when successful, often described as an “effortless” melodist and derided as a “tunesmith” rather than as a composer. A “tunesmith” is a tradesman; a composer is an artist. In The Agony and the Ecstacy, novelist Irving Stone has testy Pope Julius shout up to Michelangelo, “When will you make an end?” The maestro snarls back, “When I am finished.” Crawford’s contempt as the dissolute patroness Helen for Garfield’s vulgar “striver” virtuoso violinist Paul in Humoresque, for all the delicious camp with which it is presented, is adroitly mixed by someone who had been around and seen a thing or two (playwrite Clifford Odets) with envy, self-loathing and lust. Artists move freely through classes, it is true; but we’re still servants at play; we are meant never, ever to forget who owns the house, and the way to the kitchen door. We’re still talking about how talent intersects with class, aren’t we, Milton? You old fox.\n\nA digression, perhaps, but it is important to mention that it isn’t just “melody” that comes in for the class-related slap down. I recall the casual contempt with which a colleague whose cultural reference points (and social aspirations) were shaped by their years at Harvard and Columbia dismissed the first movement of my Koto Concerto. Why? Because, for them, “serious” meant “saturating the chromatic” and I had, as a compositional challenge, based it entirely on a simple pentatonic pitch group. The brilliant composer David Rakowski has written hilariously about the various other self-imposed (!) creative hang-ups of our compositional generation here.\n\nWhen the American Academy gave me an Academy Award a few years ago, the citation noted that I was being honored for having “achieved my own voice.” Grateful as I was for the recognition, I admit that I was a little puzzled by the citation. Stephen Sondheim’s smart, tart lyric from Anyone Can Whistle came to mind: “What's hard is simple. / What's natural come hard.” I think my songs are harder to sing than they ought to be because I’m still —still! — after forty years, struggling to be “easier” to sing. What is in youth derided as “facile” is deemed later as “not self-critical enough.” (In need of more “wrong” notes?) Some composers have to fight to get there; others never give it a thought; but, one day, a composer ceases to care what colleagues and critics think. A mindful composer never stops caring about how the audience feels, though. Consequently, I still believe that anybody can, in fact, whistle; I believe in “peace, justice, and good tunes.”\n\nWhy? Because, in the final analysis, good tunes are the surest, most generous, most intimate way a composer has to share unconditional, unearned love with an audience. That’s why tunes move us so deeply; why they threaten some people, console others, and embarrass others. As Milton admonished me so long ago, “Maybe ask yourself why.”\n\nPacked one night in April 2022 into the 33’ x 22’ dining room of La Storia, an Italian restaurant in Chicago, were a pre-blocked cast of seven—one of whom played the violin; two were mute; and four who sang—and about thirty diners. Far from being “extras,” some were donors—”angels,” and some were simply souls —”anime,” if you like, who I told beforehand only that they were having dinner in a bistro in Little Italy on the evening of September 10th, 2001 and that an opera would unfold around them. I told them where the stationary coverage cameras were emplaced (and not to look directly into them), and to ignore the steady-cam operator (director of photography Talal Jabari) as he passed fluidly among them capturing closeups like a dancer carrying a fifty pound partner. I told them, “this is the opposite of dinner theater: feel free to eavesdrop.” Smiling, I then admonished them, “but you are New Yorkers, so you know how to give others their privacy.”\n\nSearching their faces, I revealed to the supers before the cameras rolled that their bartender was named Orfeo, and that the hostess was named Lulu; that the strolling violinist who would play periodically was named Charon, and that the woman singing on the radio was named Eurydice. A light chuckle from one of the guests, who recognized immediately that Orfeo worked here because this was as close as he could ever get to being with his wife again. A story told in another opera. Doubling down, I explained that I, a mishappen, portly Detective Columbo-like character in a tweed jacket instead of a raincoat, was the proprietor of the restaurant, which was called “Passaggio,” and my name was Mors. A glimmer of understanding in the eyes of those diners who had read the classics in high school.\n\nDuring the filming that ensued, some gathered gradually that the recurring Christina Rossetti lyric sung by Eurydice on the radio about a boatman and a pretty young passenger was about their current situation. Others only realized what was going on at the very end when, as the four friends came to terms with who the violinist was (and by doing so came to terms with their own deaths) left the restaurant, the transformation from bar to bardo was complete and a strangely mournful pre-recorded message repeated, again and again, “We’re sorry, but your call cannot be completed as dialed.”\n\nInto a setting as intentionally claustrophobic and in-your-face as a John Cassavetes film this Shakespearean “flight of angels” was comprised of people who either “knew” that they were in the bardo—human souls who were transitioning (or had just done so?) from one state of being to the next, like DeLillo’s falling man—or were there to observe the four singers’ transformation into not-so-distant cousins of Damiel and Cassiel, the angels from Wim Wenders’ Der Himmel über Berlin. (For those so-inclined, the link between Cassavetes and Wenders is Peter Falk, who portrays a fallen husband for the former, and himself as a fallen angel for the latter.) Who knows? There may be gods seated at the bar. Well, here at Passaggio, there actually are. But Charon will be paid in the end, and the Serling-esque surprise you feel in this Twilight Zone is all yours. In other words, the living sing; the dead do not.\n\n9/10: Love Before the Fall is a sequel to Orson Rehearsed, my operafilm about the final moments of Orson Welles’ life. Welles’ wildly creative mind dreamed up a bardo that filled the inside of an empty theater in which his dazzling intellect could come to terms with what was to come next. The four characters in 9/10 are ordinary people. Instead of a heart attack cutting their lives short, they will, the next day, die in the terrorist attack on the Twin Towers. Tony is a talented young chef at Windows on the World; his partner is Bibi, a soubrette from Los Angeles who waits tables there. Cory, a lawyer-turned-arbitrageur who “traded his shingle for a single” shares law offices with his partner Trina, an attorney with whom he fell in love when they were students at Stanford. After four arias during which each takes stock of their life, the men propose. When the women say yes, Cory realizes at once that they are “alive in a moment,” echoing Auden’s four solitary wartime drinkers in Age of Anxiety. They sing Dante’s line, “Remember tonight, for it is the start of everything.” Its promise of love as “a reward for persisting through life so long alone” is in sharp contrast to what happens next: Charon’s inevitable, entirely understandable, unsentimental demand for payment.\n\nThe shooting script and score of 9/10 were supported by a John Simon Guggenheim Fellowship. I staged it as a traditional opera with graduate students at the Chicago College of Performing Arts while simultaneously shooting the film on location with members of my New Mercury Collective. I am deeply grateful for the support of Rudy Marcozzi, dean at the time of CCPA, of Thomas Kernan, the present dean, and 534 Productions. The film is currently in post production and will be released to festivals on September 10th, 2023. Learn more.\n\nThe bit was in. I had spotted bliss—far off in the distance still, but real enough to enthrall. Fifteen years old, summer of 1976, body vibrating, ablaze with youth and hormones at the kitchen table at three in the morning with the radio on listening to Ron Cuzner’s overnight jazz show on WFMR and copying parts to Together, the musical I was writing for my friends.\n\nCuzner introduced the six-minute-long 1971 Polydor recording to his listeners as though disclosing classified information over whisky to a fellow agent in a smoky bar near Checkpoint Charlie. I remember the words clearly: “He hails from California. (beat of silence) Marlene Dietrich (again, the silence, to let the enormously important intelligence land) is reported to have (beat) loved him. He married a glamorous movie star (beat), Angie Dickinson. But he was a student of Milhaud, and Cowell (I knew who these guys were and was impressed) who, shall we say, went off the railswith the likes of (he paused, as though about to invoke a Holy Trinity) Warwick, Jones, and Alpert. This (Cuzner’s ultimate seal of approval) very cool orchestral work describes the moment you first see (long beat) her.”\n\nFive years earlier, my brother Kevin had brought the Columbia LP’s of Leonard Bernstein’s MASS home and I had scandalized my fellow ten-year-olds by playing “it was goddamn good” (listen to Alan Titus sing it here) in class at Linfield School to the horror of Principal Buege (pronounced “Biggy,” of course) and to the delight of my mother. (Kevin had provoked similar outrage by bringing Jesus Christ Superstar to school a year earlier.) But my mom also adored Ella Fitzgerald, Barbara Streisand, and Frank Sinatra—the exquisite Nelson Riddle arrangements of the Cole Porter songbook especially. I was immersed in the Beatles songbook, of course; I had read Twilight of the Gods, Wilfred Mellers’ terrific book about their songs, the previous summer. My brothers and I had wept in 1970 when the announcer introduced the first local broadcast of The Long and Winding Road on WOKY by revealing that the Beatles had decided to split up.\n\nIntuiting that something interesting was about to happen, I slipped a cassette in to tape it, missing the first few bars. I would listen to that recording of And the People Were With Her a hundred times that summer. I still have it.\n\nMy literature teacher, Diane Doerfler, knew that the one thing I was sure I was going to do was leave Wisconsin for the coast at the very first opportunity. Which coast was very much up in the air. My father favored the west coast: he recorded movie soundtracks by way of a jack he had installed on the back of our television. I’d spent a lot of time listening to dozens of them—particularly to Elmer Bernstein’s majestic Great Escape, Magnificent Seven, and To Kill a Mockingbird. Doerfler was in favor of the east coast: she had tossed me a copy (which I still have) of John Cheever’s collected short stories about life in the Hudson Valley and quipped, “Here. Read these. They will help.” (They did. Doerf was right; after decades in Manhattan, I now live in the Hudson Valley.)\n\nFrom the moment that And the People Were With Her (listen here as you read this piece) ended, my “Killer B’s” for the rest of summer 1975 became Beatles, Bernstein, and Bacharach and the west coast became a real contender. John Williams’ pealing orchestral main title to Star Wars in summer 1978 hit me like a hammer, and I was certain — according to my diaries — that I would move to Los Angeles and start work as an orchestrator, perhaps even graduate in time to scoring. The decision was made when mother sent my orchestral Suite for a Lonely City to Helen Coates and in return received a letter — a sort of unexpected musical golden ticket — from Leonard Bernstein which she would open a few feet away from where I was sitting. East it was.\n\nIn a few months, Kevin would put Britten’s Billy Budd on the record player, and my future as an opera composer would be set: Bacharach was supplanted by Britten. By the time I graduated high school, the earthy authenticity of Bartok supplanted the Beatles. College in Madison brought Homer Lambrecht’s influence; he introduced me to the Italianate suavity of Berio, and my musical trinity became Berio, Britten, and Bernstein. When I finally landed at Curtis, Lukas Foss got me into Stockhausen — a needed antidote to the polishing and professionalizing I was receiving in my lessons with Ned Rorem — and my world was turned inside out. I dedicated myself to Beethoven, Brahms, and Bach as far as the school and my peers were concerned — heaven knows I had enough to learn about that repertoire! — and holed up at the Free Library with Stockhausen and the eastern bloc modernists in the afternoons. Though I toyed with a career in LA during summer 1988, I ended up moving to Europe instead, returning to New York City for good in 1990.\n\nBeing a pianist and devotee of the American Songbook helps one to truly credit the subversive power of Bacharach’s music. Gershwin, Arlen, Kern, Rogers, Porter — the lot of them — were only a few years past. Like Bernstein, Bacharach’s chord choices could be deliciously “classical” (I hear the harmonic choices of Bill Evans), with modulations, shifting meters and phrase lengths. Some of his bridges (my favorite is the wandering and wonderful, take-that-Kern-and-Arlen bridge to A House is Not a Home — listen here) are pure bliss. Like Stephen Sondheim and Bernstein, his tunes could be tricky. But during his Warwick-Alpert years, I sense that something in him led him to craft surprisingly memorable (though, again, deceptively simple yet more than quirky and smart, I’d say inspired) tunes.\n\nI have read that Bacharach will be remembered compositionally as a transitional figure bridging the methods perfected by the 50s Brill Building bunch and rock and roll. Or maybe as the American Michel Legrand. Maybe, but I think that takeaway unfairly diminishes his accomplishment. He was a master of instrumental MOR. (“Middle-of-the-road,” a commercial radio format that includes “easy listening” and can even cover cool genres such as Shibuya-kei and show tunes and not so cool ones like Countrypolitan.) MOR makes musical snobs crazy—particularly when a gifted composer writes it. I love that. It’s subversive, and musical chauvinists just don’t get it.\n\nBacharach brilliantly subverted commercial music clichés and practices by marrying them (thereby freshening classical tropes and supercharging pop music tropes) to classical chops and compositional procedures not to accompany the dissipation of the valium and martini hazed Greatest Generation, but to underline their societal disillusionment. When James Coburn steps into William Daniels’ den (watch it here) in The President’s Analyst (1967) and Daniels’ character (a gun-toting “liberal”) flicks a switch, filling the room with “total sound,” the music supplied by Lalo Schifrin captured the essence of what I have described elsewhere as that which is “heard in the waiting room of a dentist’s office while awaiting a root canal.” It’s MOR, it’s the seamy underside of the American Dream, and it is glorious.\n\nWhen Cory, a 35 year old arbitrageur who works at the World Trade Center, arrives and lets rip with a big aria in my operafilm 9/10: Love Before the Fall, he’s characterized by the sort of virile Mike Post television theme (here, or here, or here) from the 70s-90s he’d have grown up with—who knows, maybe watching LA Law as a teenager was what inspired him to become a lawyer! When Bibi, a 21-year-old singer brought up in Los Angeles, remembers her childhood there, she swings into music that could have been lifted wholesale from Nikki (listen here). MOR had served as the background music to their suburban childhoods as much as shag carpeting had comforted their bare feet in the den—one on the east coast, the other on the west. It is my honor to characterize them with the music with which they would have identified. Editing the film, I’ve watched again and again (as only one strapped to a moviola must) as people in the room reacted with everything from delight to contempt to these musical moments, depending on who they think they are or what they think music ought to be.\n\nBacharach was who he was, and his honor — whether it be in South American Getaway (listen here, where he out swingles the Swingle Singers and puts a pin in Berio’s magnificent Sinfonia), or Pacific Coast Highway (listen here, from 1968) in which he captures the dread-filled determination to be carefree that I still picked up on while driving on it during the 90s to Stinson Beach — was to contextualize his time.\n\nTo me, though, the most incorruptible facet of Bacharach’s compositional gift remains the gleaming horizontality of his melodies from which the chords seem to hang like icicles from the eaves of an irregular roofline. Hal David’s lyrics were middlebrow — another thing that made the songs easier to digest than Sondheim’s — but heartfelt and soulful. I was never crazy for the collaborations with Bayer Sager. Elvis Costello’s verse — smart, dark, and probing, was a great foil for the late Bacharach as a songwriter. Bacharach set lyrics as an art song composer would poetry (or as Elton John treats Bernie Taupin’s words, though he is liable to override the lyrics entirely for the sake of a good hook or tune) — permitting the rhythm of the unevenly proportioned lyric lines to generate melodies more like those from an art song than a popular song.\n\nPerhaps, if he had been the sort of man who could have been contained by the eastern seaboard, he would not have toured with Dietrich, courted commercial success, or married Dickinson, or encountered his singer muse Warwick (his Leontyne?) and created I Say a Little Prayer (listen here to it as not just a love confection but as the cri de coeur of a woman whose boyfriend is in Vietnam and you get how his songs can be simultaneously winsome and wise) and a host of other great Motown-influenced gems. Maybe he would have surpassed Alec Wilder’s expectations and created a new American art song repertoire. Maybe he would have been America’s other Samuel Barber. Maybe he did. Maybe he was.\n\nWhen Thornton Wilder’s 1938 meta-theatrical triptych of portraits of American Life Our Town (which, no matter when it is staged, always takes place in 1938) was produced at the McCarter Theater in Princeton, twenty years had passed since the American Dream had been convulsed by the “War to End all War.” That which burns away any Rockwell-esque nostalgia and powers the drama of the play is the “Damoclesian sword” that was the rise of fascism and the impending outbreak of World War II—only months away. The audience was invited to grieve for the characters from the moment that they met the omniscient, fourth-wall-piercing character of the Stage Manager. It was in the air: Marc Blitzstein’s The Cradle Will Rock, (with Blitzstein and Orson Welles on stage essentially splitting the role that Wilder would transform into the Stage Manager for his Our Town) had electrified the American theater during summer 1937. Louise Talma (the only composer besides Hindemith to convince Wilder to pen a libretto, in German, no less—for her earnest, turgid Alcestiad—in the ’50s) told me at Yaddo during the ’90s that “Thornton certainly knew Marc’s opera. The Depression was winding down. We saw Hitler coming to power. People were mourning Good Old Days that never were.”[1]\n\nArguably, Wilder’s “continual dryness of tone”—as he described it in the introductory note to the 1938 “acting edition” of the play—found its ideal composer in Aaron Copland’s seminal 1940 musical score (dedicated to Leonard Bernstein) for the original film.[2] Copland, according to Vivian Perlis, stated, “For the film version, they were counting on the music to translate the transcendental aspects of the story. I tried for clean and clear sounds and in general used straightforward harmonies and rhythms that would project the serenity and sense of security of the story.” Rudolf Bing, then general manager of the Metropolitan Opera, approached Copland in 1951 with the idea of expanding his score into a full-length operatic version. Wilder, according to Perlis, quashed the idea, responding, “my texts ‘swear at’ music; they’re after totally different effects.”[3] What was required, as Wilder wrote in his introduction to the play was, “the New England understatement of sentiment, of surprise, of tragedy. A shyness about emotion ... a sharpening and distinctness of the voice.”\n\nFast forward. Wilder said no to many composers during his lifetime, though he did permit Jerry Herman and Michael Stewart to turn The Matchmaker into Hello Dolly and, in 1965, did grant rights to Leonard Bernstein, Betty Comden, and Adolph Green to adapt The Skin of Our Teeth into a musical. Musical theater collaborations are fickle—everything’s got to fall into place or the producers bolt and the soufflé falls. Everything didn’t, and the project collapsed. When Lenny returned to Wilder, seeking operatic rights, Wilder shut him down. We are the poorer for his decision.[4]\n\nI studied with composer Ned Rorem during the early ’80s while a student at the Curtis Institute, and served as his copyist for half a decade after that. I knew his music from the inside out, and I knew particularly well his short operas. Art song composer nonpareil, he and Kenward Elmslie had adapted August Strindberg’s Miss Julie in 1965 with mixed success, and many thought him not suited to the demands of large-scale lyric theater. But Ned persevered, and garnered universal praise from opera stalwarts when, in 1994, he returned to Miss Julie, trimming it into a “taut and persuasive” 90-minute one act, according to James Oestreich in the Times.[5]\n\nJ.D. (Sandy) McClatchy, the svelte poet, erudite editor, and versatile librettist for Little Nemo in Slumberland (Daron Hagen), Miss Lonelyhearts (Lowell Liebermann), 1984 (Lorin Maazel), Dolores Claiborne (Tobias Picker), and A Question of Taste (William Schuman) among others, and I met when translator William Weaver commissioned me to compose some songs in memory of James Merrill—Sandy was Merrill’s executor. I admired his libretti and told him so. He said that Tappan Wilder had agreed to loosen the bonds on the Our Town rights, and that he, Sandy, was looking for the right composer. How, he asked me, would I proceed if I took on the job? I don’t recall now what I said, but I do recall ending the conversation by saying, “You know, the man you’re looking for is really Ned Rorem. Ned’s Quakerism provides the proper emotional repose; his age the appropriate cultural reference points. Most importantly, he’s entirely secure in his own voice, and will be comfortable letting Wilder’s play take the lead.”\n\nI doubt that Sandy chose Ned because of what I said, but I knew then (and now) that I was right.Our Town the opera was premiered by Indiana University Opera Theater with student singers and orchestra on February 25, 2006. Its professional debut was at the Lake George Opera on July 1, 2006. Intended from the start to be a chamber opera, the orchestration is small, and the scoring is light and transparent throughout—consistent with a work best suited to young voices. The formal structure follows Wilder’s play closely. Minor deviations from the original play seem to have been made (the fleshing out of the role of Simon Stimson, the creation of choral numbers, for example) to provide opportunities for musicalization. Rorem moves in and out of speech and utilizes more elevated recitative (parlando) than in his previous theatrical works.\n\nPlaying through Ned’s first manuscript vocal score with Gilda Lyons shortly after he finished his first draft, we pounced upon the opportunity of giving the concert première of the (now classic) aria for Emily. (Notably, the opera’s only freestanding set piece.) In it, the ironic union of opposites that make the opera Our Town the immediate American classic that it is were on full display—economy of construction, absolute, unwavering resistance to unnecessary emotionalism, frankly open textures, wisps of Poulenc at his driest, and the sort of stunning Protestant hymns that only an atheistic alcoholic Quaker whose life partner was a church organist can pen. Everywhere in the music there is a sort of cool, self-contained regretfulness—the regret so central to the play’s initial impetus, a regret so intense as to border on dread—that perfectly underpins and undercuts the sentimentality of the portraits.\n\nRorem uses three compositional strategies to hold the opera together structurally, track the story’s narrative, and to keep his musical rhetoric coherent.\n\nFirst, he manifests Wilder’s “emotional shyness” with abrupt stylistic cross-cutting (in mid- thought, sometimes in mid-musical phrase) between Americana (Thomsonian faux-Protestant hymns, plush sustained cinematic strings, Copland-esque woodwind solos, Ivesian collages), transatlantic modernism (the tartly-scored “sting” chords, jagged, off-kilter ostinatos in close- canon, denatured melodic fragments in place of memorable tunes), and Gallic lyricism (rapturous string obbligatos, sudden snatches of emotionally-vibrant melody, Debussy-esque orchestration).\n\nSecond, throughout the opera, beginning in the background during the first moments as a woodwind obbligato like a nettlesome foreigner, is a “deedle-dum” figure that unmistakably evokes the falling motif associated with the doomed nuns in Poulenc’s Dialogues of the Carmelites[Fig. 5]. Rorem’s personal association with the motif inspired him to quote it in his own song, “For Poulenc” [Fig. 6], and, over the years, a dozen instrumental works, large and small. In the score of Our Town, it completes its transit (in Ned’s life as a composer and in his catalogue) in his characterization of Emily [Fig. 7].\n\nThe motif evolves inexorably over the course of the opera, generating tension the way that someone playing with their hair during a serious conversation is at first slightly distracting and, over time, enervating. It begins to take on a life of its own as the second act unfolds, the curling of melodies in the background behind the characters’ parlando turning in on themselves in an Ouroborus-like way, transforming the fragments into slowly unraveling ostinati that are both claustrophobic and comforting—like the family life Rorem’s music limns. Characters begin taking on the background ostinati and incorporating them into their parlando in odd melismatic passages that heighten words in a baroque fashion. As the second act closes and the young couple marry, the dread given us by the first acerbic chord of the opera returns, literally underscoring the fragility of their happiness. A violin solo gives another fleeting taste of sensual pleasure before Rorem snuffs it as, again, “too much” to close with an anything but comforting, dread-filled, Ives-ian mash-up of the “Mendelssohn Wedding March.”\n\nPedal points in the strings, quizzical quasi-chorales in the winds and brass, the “deedle-dum” curling wind obbligati, all return in the third act; the opera continues to unfold, but all the vocal lines are heightened above parlando (they’re taken closer to “song” and effusive tunefulness by making their tunes less abstract and more traditionally singable and giving the phrases more melismas) in a way that they weren’t in the first two acts. This “gradual emotional warming” manifests Ned’s third, and most subtle, strategy for giving the opera emotional depth, the character of Emily emotional verifiability, and the piece a satisfying emotional trajectory.\n\nThis is how he did it. Gradually, Rorem invests the chorus with more and more emotional warmth so that they—in death, but not in life—create the sort of musico-emotional landscape into which Emily can step. The apotheosis of the opera is, of course, Emily’s aria, wherein Rorem combines at proximity all the musical gestures laid out in the first two acts. In this, the “eleven o’clock” spot, he gives Emily the only unabashedly rapturous music in the opera, and on the most regretful sentiment: “Do any human beings ever realize life while they live it—every, every minute?” The composer’s self-control in finally allowing us to “feel” is masterful; the effect is devastating. His obvious identification with Emily, Poulenc, and the nuns is an astonishing personal revelation for a composer so famously public in his prose and yet so resolutely private in fact. Emily concludes, as Ned (a writer who eschews exclamation points and composer who famously hates repeating words, breaks his own rules) sums up a world-view, “That’s all human beings are. Blind!”\n\nOne afternoon in Chicago a composition student at Roosevelt University where I served for a spell as a member of the Artist Faculty asked me how to “cultivate his career.”\n\nI closed my eyes for a moment, listened to the radiator in the grand old Chicago Auditorium Theater Building clank, and realized with a start that the look on my face was probably pretty close to Marlon Brando’s in his final scene with Martin Sheen in Apocalypse Now. “Are you okay?” he asked. I rubbed my chest, sighed, and smiled.\n\n“Tell me about your value system,” I replied. “Are you a mindful individual? What are your goals as a person? How does making art manifest those goals? If you aren’t yet clear about those goals, then asking yourself what you want to be doing in five, ten, or twenty years is putting the cart before the horse just as surely as a child’s finger painting is precious, but it hasn’t the same intrinsic artistic value as a Da Vinci line drawing.”\n\n“I envy you your passion,” he replied. “So why did you look so pained when I asked about how to ‘cultivate my career?’”\n\n“One cultivates a garden, not a career,” I replied, warming to the subject. “Art doesn’t need Us, but we need Art. I, for example, am obsessively shy and private, yet, when I talk about Art, I feel only humility and passion. This is typical of people who are committed to something larger and more important than themselves and their personal actuation.”\n\n“But I want to be a ‘success’,” my young friend persisted. “How can I be one?”\n\n“Well, bearing in mind that only you can define what constitutes ‘success,’ I can tell you that you’re on the wrong track if you think that receiving and executing high profile prizes or commissions constitute anything but a limited sort of ‘success’—a fleeting, superficial kind. I’m all for ‘creating opportunities’ but that ‘cultivation’ must be in the service of a vision / project greater than simply piling on another ‘commission’ to write another piece: running around at top speed taking meetings and generating interest in your work that will evaporate the moment you stop hectoring people is the worst misunderstanding of what ‘cultivating’ people is, or at least ought to be.”\n\n“Success to me means people loving my music,” he said, a little hurt.\n\n“Now, there you’re on the right track,” I reassured him. “For me, connecting through music with other human beings is everything. If I can emotionally connect with one person in the room and move them to do good, I’ve made a start. People rarely ‘love’ a piece of serious music—it’s not a popularity contest, after all. But antagonizing people who’ve handed over precious moments of their lives to you is the height of arrogance and selfishness. Furthermore, simply pasting some sort of ‘socially relevant’ message on top of an otherwise abstract musical utterance (and all music is essentially abstract, whether one wants to admit it or not) does a disservice to the cause—whatever it is.”\n\n“You make ambition sound like a bad thing,” he said, quietly.\n\n“Not at all. I’m all for drive. Drive and, above all, resilience. Taking risks in your Art is the only sure way to generate rejection from certain quarters. And, since ‘rejection’ is about the only thing an Artist can really count on in the long run, learning how to tolerate it is critical. Artistic ambition is crucial; professional ambition is, in the long run, sort of a bore after one has figured out the relationship between their Art and the Marketplace. Profitable music isn’t better; it’s just more profitable.\n\n“Do you compose every day?” he challenged me.\n\n“Of course. I’m composing right now. The goal is to ‘become music,’ not Me. I achieved this through the acquisition of comprehensive musical technique and countless hours writing, practicing, reading, listening, and performing music and literature. People change, situations are fluid, money comes and goes. I’ve told people for two decades that all I want to do is to learn how to write a decent opera. I expect Anton Coppola, aged 103 and conducting his latest opera, feels the same way. That’s when the irony of the situation becomes the most bittersweet: just as you begin to figure out how its done, you’ve run out of time to do it. When people tell you that they know ‘how it’s done,’ or that they ‘know what they’re doing,’ you should take them at their word and distrust most of what they say, because they have stopped learning.”\n\n“Aaron Copland once wrote that he answered every letter within 24 hours and that that was a key to being a good professional,” he said.\n\n“What a good man he must have been,” I responded warmly. “Again, it’s a values thing: simply be kind to people. I have learned that, for me at least, figuring out which letters to ignore has been helpful. Turning things down. Knowing when to walk away. When to stop. Avoiding toxic situations. Letting people be who they are and not who I want them to be or to have been. In the end, being a composer is a vocation, not a career. We are both secular priests and simple entertainers who speak truth to power. Not for nothing did a certain real estate magnate belittle the ‘Queen of Soul’ as ‘someone who worked for him’ when she died. We exist as an antidote to people like that. That’s a calling worth cultivating.”\n\nI looked out the window at the El as it swept by and wondered if the young composer sitting in front of me had read Heart of Darkness or heard Brando’s line reading of “The horror.” I drew the music for the lovely piece he’d brought with him toward me, pulled my glasses down to the tip of my nose so that I could make out the notes, and his music filled my brain as I read. “So beautiful,” I said aloud. I scanned ahead. “So many trivial notation problems that you should clear up before this music goes on the stands. Now let’s talk about the difference between Power and Authority.”\n\nShortly after my memoir Duet with the Past was published more or less to crickets, a cardiologist informed me that I had aortic atresia, a congenital absence of the normal valvular opening from the left ventricle of the heart into the aorta. In my case, the valve wasn’t closing entirely, and was deteriorating, which meant that it would have to be replaced eventually. The news would have made for a great ending to the book, which began with a description of the infant death—due to the same condition—of my namesake. Instead, my narrative ended with a lyrical portrait of bourgeois family life—the story of a fine artist who ended up somewhere in the middle, raising sons, counting blessings and reconnecting with childhood values.\n\nA staccato scene in the doctor’s office followed by the Patient walking out into the parking lot, distractedly pawing at his sternum (as though that would tell him anything) with one hand while processing the news and in the process dropping his keys—an apt metaphor. Curtain. It would have been an effective, full-circle first act break for a tragicomic two act Off-Broadway musical—certainly suitable for an ending to my memoir. As Orson Welles observed in the unproduced screenplay, The Brass Ring, “If you want a happy ending, that depends, of course, on where you stop your story.” And yet.\n\nIn My Lost City, Fitzgerald wrote, “I once thought that there were no second acts in American lives, but there was certainly to be a second act to New York's boom days.” Indeed, traditional theater—and episodic television—give one five acts to skid to a halt. I had only begun sketching the treatment for Orson Rehearsed when Duet with the Past was published. I was aware that it would either serve as the beginning of a new act or as the postlude to a life torso.\n\nAn opera film about a polymath artist dying of a heart attack is obviously an artistic response to the heart disease diagnosis. Orson is postmodern in its disregard for outmoded conceptions of high and low art; it exists after elitism. It isn’t that the music is eclectic, it is that the idea of style is irrelevant. It is post stylistic. As the political tool of the Big Lie roared back into civic life, I expressed the dread I felt as a citizen and father by acknowledging the arbitrariness of traditional narrative, seeking Truth in a corkscrew fashion with the Möbius strip-like dramaturgy of Orson Rehearsed. There’s no happy ending, just death. The curtain falls; the hero simply dies; a solo piano plays a ragtime tune to an empty theater.\n\nLike a terrible vast caesura came the pandemic. The implosion / pulverization of what once constituted the “classical music world” accelerated as big institutions cancelled their seasons and musical careers simply stopped. Faith that it was all but an interval between acts seemed naive. Having finished the sixteen month process of editing the opera film of Orson, I released it into the independent film festival world and was astonished to find that particular scene vibrant and keenly anticipating a return to “normalcy.” Orson began gathering laurels, screenings, and growing legs before the audio recording was released on Naxos. It appeared that institutional support for digital visual content by necessity had increased, and a host of opera presenters, composers, and stage directors took up filmic projects. Companies realized that it costs less to film a new project and to stream it than it does to stage it in a small black box theater.\n\nOne obvious thing I have learned by publishing a memoir in middle age is that I don’t get to stop my story where I want to. This morning rain falls in heavy sheets of “white” noise and I sketch the treatment of my next opera film, 9/10. It is—despite the fact that it is set in a restaurant in Little Italy the night before the Twin Towers fell—about second acts, about what happens after the disaster. I am beginning to hear, tuning up in my imagination—very, very far off, and I could be mistaken—the primordial sound of an orchestra that doesn’t sound anything like the orchestra that I grew up loving.\n\nExperiencing 9/11, I remember feeling during the next few years that New Yorkers struggled to begin a new act. For me, it was a new narrative that I didn’t feel as though I wanted to be a part of, so I began to think about moving away. Now, as the pandemic begins to wind down, I sense neither the beginning of the end nor the end of the beginning, but the start of just another act.\n\nSo: I choose the beginning of my second act, choose my own post-disaster narrative—one in which the Patient stops pawing at his heart, picks up the keys, and hits the road again with renewed energy because of having committed to listening, defining his weaknesses, and learning.\n\nClick on the arrow below to watch the teaser for 9/10.\n\nI don’t remember presenting my music to a roomful of students at a community college on the west coast in December 1990. But I had a note this morning—thirty-two years later—from a young composer who was there. Composer and conductor Troy Peters had played him a cassette recording of Leonard Slatkin and the Saint Louis Symphony reading my orchestra piece Fresh Ayre (which became the first movement of my second symphony—long story) and it had, as the cliché goes, struck a chord with him: “Polychords,” he wrote, “A over E, then E over A, followed by the unadorned octave-doubled major-seventh melodic leap: E, D#, then a near-octatonic hexachord I couldn't justify using any of the scale types my freshman-level instruction had provided.”\n\nI remembered bringing it into a lesson with Joe Schwantner at Juilliard in fall 1986. He took the time to figure out the hexachords. “May I take this page home with me this week? I’d like to study it,” he said. I was floored. The next week he brought with him an array of numbers that told the theoretical story of what I had done during those first ten bars that humbled and dazzled me and changed my life. Ensued an exciting discussion of Schoenberg’s signature hexachord, and a fascinating ramble through the first few pages of Joe’s own Aftertones of Infinity.\n\nFour years after Joe had changed my life, I had paid it forward without knowing it for the young composer in Washington. Matthew 7:6 came to mind. Thirty-six years later, I remain moved by the profound act of faith (in teaching, in Art, in the aesthetic, and on and on) that Joe demonstrated in casting pearls before me.\n\nAccepting one’s role in the transitivity of teaching is both humbling and exhilarating. If one fetishizes the pearls one casts, as Oscar Levant quipped, teaching can devolve into “revealing openly known secrets.” If one doesn’t underline—if only a bit—the importance of the thing being taught, then one trivializes not just one’s role, but the tradition itself.\n\nBut what are the “pearls” being cast? Are they “artistic truths?” Whose truth? What kind is it? Small or large T? Objective? Normative? Subjective? Complex? Plato argued that fine art and poetry cannot impart truths because they do not give humankind access to the Forms. On the other hand, Aristotle defended poetry as a means of obtaining general knowledge about probable courses of human events. Picasso knew a thing or two about Art. He is supposed to have said that “art is a lie that makes us realize the truth.” The other day I watched Orson Welles’ witty documentary F for Fake and was grateful all over again for his reminder that “our songs will all be silenced, but what of it?” His answer (the one with which I agree, if you take my operafilm Orson Rehearsed at its word) is to “go on singing.” Go on casting pearls.\n\n“I share this with you with no expectation of a response,” wrote the man, now a respected colleague in mid-career. “I believe it's important to let those who've changed us for the better know of the role they played.”\n\nI tried, in Orson Rehearsed, to capture, as one generous and perceptive colleague observed about it, “the hallucinatory parabola of [an] almost mythological creature.” In truth, with a wink to the maestro, I know that I succeeded in creating something that gives back to the person viewing / hearing it exactly what they expected: surface beauty, if what they wanted to feel was clever at the creator’s expense. It is a work that grows deeper with repeated listenings / viewings. What’s required in accessing Orson Rehearsed, ironically, is faith—faith that the artist and his subject might have something more to say beneath the self-awareness that Art is, in most ways, a magic trick—a work about just that; a work about Process, about singing, about dying.\n\nCountless metric tons of seawater hurtled into and over las Cortinas, or curtains—named for the cascade the Pacific makes when it thunders over them and the slab-like shape of the volcanic rock formations themselves—thrusting out of the Nicaraguan shoreline south of Casares with the weight and sound of a doomed jet. It was the hour between dog and wolf, when the light parts the veil between day and night in a part of the world comprised of attracting opposites: priceless natural beauty and heartrending poverty; profound generosity and the expedience of necessity; life, and the other.\n\nI looked to the sun, a somniferous blob of mercurochrome, far out to sea. My sons—still my hearts outside of my body, aged six and ten—built a sandcastle in the surf a few feet from me with their friend, conscious of the place’s beauty, but still untouched by its menace. I reassured myself of their safety by observing that their mother and grandmother were close by.\n\nA swimmer who looked to be about twenty-two, slender, swarthy, and breathtakingly reckless, thrashed in a shallow, rocky posita at the base of the curtain of frozen lava on which hammered the deafening tide. He stroked piston-like, joylessly, against the incoming rollers, his arms pumping mindlessly in the confined space like a diaphragm providing air to a dying brain. When his head disappeared among the razor sharp outcroppings, I thought, he’s going to die, and commenced the mental calculus—distance from me to him, him to the rocks, boys to "
