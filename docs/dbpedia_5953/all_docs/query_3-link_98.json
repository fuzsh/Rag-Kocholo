        "text": "Although traditionally frothy romantic comedies are an easy way to chase away the Sunday scaries, there's nothing more warm and fuzzy than the best musical movies, complete with singalongs and high-energy dance numbers. Who doesn’t like feeling like the world is capable of bursting into song at any moment? Since Judy Garland sang sweetly about returning home in The Wizard of Oz (an absolute must-watch film), fans of feel-good movies have been hooked on the genre.\n\nThese days, musical movies can sometimes be hit or miss: For as many crazy, joyful, ridiculous-in-the-best-way films like Mamma Mia (don't worry, it's on here) that exist in the world, there are movies like whatever Cats was (definitely not on the list). But when it's good, it's spectacular. Modern artists have taken the form and played with it, so it doesn't necessarily have to sound and look like a play come to life. That's especially true of the past few years, which have seen icons including Lin-Manuel Miranda giving us some of their best work.\n\nFrom the most classic musicals to melodic 2000s movies to recent, underrated gems, this list has everything you could want as a musical fan. These timeless movies are the musicals you can turn on again and again. While we can guarantee these films will make you want to sing, not every musical is bright and cheery, so we've arranged this list by subgenre for whatever mood you may be in. Without further ado, here are 65 iconic musicals spanning over eight decades that are not to miss, featuring the most epic duets, dance sequences, and jazz hands of all time.\n\nBest Classic Musicals\n\n'All That Jazz' (1979)\n\nThis musical, co-written and directed by Bob Fosse, is inspired by his life and career as a dancer, choreographer, and director. It focuses on Fosse's attempt to edit his film Lenny while simultaneously directing and choreographing the 1975 Broadway musical Chicago, and the women trying to save him from himself. You can still see the impact of Fosse's work on modern dance.\n\nWATCH IT\n\n'An American in Paris' (1951)\n\nThis Gene Kelly classic tells the story of a former American soldier who remains in Paris after the war to become a painter (how romantic, right?) and falls for a local French girl. The duo becomes a love triangle, though, when a rich heiress starts to show interest in the painter on a more than professional level.\n\nWATCH IT\n\n'Annie' (1982)\n\nThe sun will come out tomorrow—and this legendary musical will remind you of that. Set in 1933 during The Great Depression, this musical tells the story of Little Orphan Annie, who lives in New York City and winds up being taken in by America's richest billionaire, Oliver Warbucks. If anything, you'll learn that you're never fully dressed without a smile.\n\nWATCH IT\n\n‘Bye Bye Birdie’ (1963)\n\nFans of pop, spectacle, teen movies, and the classics, will swoon over this 1963 musical. Led by an iconic cast of Janet Leigh, Ann-Margaret in her breakout role, and Dick Van Dyke in his first feature film, it’s a triple threat of talent. The charming comedy is inspired by Elvis Presley’s draft into the army, with the stand-in here being a teen idol named Conrad Birdie (Jesse Pearson). When it’s announced that he must report for service, a struggling songwriter (Van Dyke) comes up with a plan for him to sing one of his songs and kiss a random high school girl (Ann-Margaret) on national TV.\n\nWATCH IT\n\n'Cabaret' (1972)\n\nLiza Minnelli takes center stage in this musical film that put her on the map (it swept up eight Oscars in its day). She plays a young American cabaret singer performing at the Kit Kat Klub in Nazi-era Berlin who gets caught up in a love triangle with a British academic and a German playboy.\n\nWATCH IT\n\n'Fame' (1980)\n\nFollowing students in their time at the High School of Performing Arts in pursuit of—you guessed it—fame, the musical became a smash hit and a cult classic. It didn't shy away from depicting the trials and tribulations of success (and trying to make it in show biz), but the upbeat songs and gorgeous dance sequences are what make this film sing, pun intended.\n\nWATCH IT\n\n'Fiddler on the Roof' (1971)\n\nAdapted from the Broadway musical of the same name, this movie tells the iconic story of a father who tries to keep his five daughters in line with Jewish cultural traditions. He meets resistance and realizes how much his eldest daughters want to marry husbands outside the customs of their faith.\n\nWATCH IT\n\n'Funny Face' (1957)\n\nThis winning Audrey Hepburn and Fred Astaire combination sees a young librarian in Paris caught up in the throes of the colorful American fashion world when she's scouted by a top magazine editor and a famous fashion photographer.\n\nWATCH IT\n\n'Funny Girl' (1968)\n\nAh, Babs. Known for its big hit \"Don't Rain on My Parade,\" this comedic musical sees Barbara Streisand in her element as a budding vaudeville singer who works her way up to the big time on Broadway.\n\nWATCH IT\n\n'Grease' (1978)\n\nMovie musical fans are still hopelessly devoted to Grease. It's hard not to love this starcrossed lovers story set in a 1950s-era high school, with its hand-jivin melodies, outstanding cast, and iconic outfit changes: \"Tell me about it, stud.\"\n\nWATCH IT\n\n'Guys and Dolls' (1955)\n\nA phenomenal cast of Frank Sinatra, Marlon Brando, and Jean Simmons star in this film about a gambler (played by Sinatra) who needs to make money. He places a bet he thinks is foolproof: That his old acquaintance Sky Masterson (Marlon Brando) won't be able to get the saintly Sergeant Sarah Brown (Jean Simmons) to go on a date with him.\n\nWATCH IT\n\n'Little Shop of Horrors' (1986)\n\nIt's the musical that made you give your succulents a side-eye. Rick Moranis and Ellen Greene star in this hilarious movie about a geeky florist shop worker who discovers his Venus flytrap can speak. If you're afraid of going to the dentist, I'd skip this one. It'll only fuel your fears.\n\nWATCH IT\n\n'Mary Poppins' (1964)\n\nThe story of a magical nanny who can turn every chore into a game launched Julie Andrews into stardom and has since become one of Disney's most well-known stories. Full of catchy songs, lively dance numbers, and fun animation, this musical is one film that fully captures the magic of Disney.\n\nWATCH IT\n\n‘The Music Man’ (1962)\n\nOne visit to River City and you’ll understand why this is heralded as one of the most iconic movie musicals of all time. Robert Preston (who originated the titular leading role on Broadway) plays Harold Hill, a con man who scams small towns into creating marching bands by faking his musical expertise, seeing the fictional River City, Iowa as his next to bamboozle. It’s essentially the most Americana that the genre can come.\n\nWATCH IT\n\n'My Fair Lady' (1964)\n\nPrepare yourself to be completely charmed by Audrey Hepburn's Eliza Doolittle in this modern-day Cinderella story: a working class Cockney girl learns how to speak like a polished aristocrat and pass as a member of high society.\n\nWATCH IT\n\n'Oklahoma!' (1955)\n\nYou're probably familiar with this musical's most famous song, \"Oh, What a Beautiful Morning,\" composed by legendary duo Oscar Hammerstein II and Richard Rogers. The plot drew inspiration from the play Green Grow the Lilacs and involves a country girl caught in a love triangle between a farmhand and a cowboy. There's nothing quite like the movie adaptation.\n\nWATCH IT\n\n'Purple Rain' (1984)\n\nSpeaking of musical legends and their greatest hits: Prince stars in a movie loosely based on his life, in which The Kid escapes a bad home life through music. It's a vehicle for Prince to play songs like \"Purple Rain\" and \"When Doves Cry,\" and a lasting testament to the late legend.\n\nWATCH IT\n\n'Rocky Horror Picture Show' (1975)\n\nThe cult musical of all musicals, Rocky Horror Picture Show still inspires live renditions in local theaters that recreate the eerie happenings of Dr. Frankenfurter's mansion. In it, a wayward couple, Brad (Barry Bostwick) and Janet (Susan Sarandon), get stranded there for one freaky night.\n\nWATCH IT\n\n'Singin' in the Rain' (1952)\n\nKnown for its iconic dance scenes with umbrellas, this Gene Kelly film depicts the upheaval in the entertainment industry over the transition from silent films to \"talkies\" when two silent movie stars join the cast of a musical.\n\nWATCH IT\n\n'The Sound of Music' (1965)\n\nUnless you've been living under a rock, you probably already know what the hills are alive with (music, duh). The Von Trapp family singers and their idyllic life in the Austrian countryside with their winsome governess (clothes made out of curtains! whiskers on kittens!) captured the hearts of multiple generations. This film remains one of the most iconic musicals to date.\n\nWATCH IT\n\n'Stormy Weather (1943)'\n\nThis Black-led forties musical, about a Black ex-soldier (Bill “Bojangles” Robinson) rising to the top of showbiz in the post-WWI era, is full of iconic, showstopping musical numbers that have become legendary. Come for Lena Horne's gorgeous rendition of the titular song, and stay for Harold and Fayard Nicholas' acrobatic tap routine, which Fred Astaire considered \"the greatest dance number ever filmed.\"\n\nWATCH IT\n\n'The Umbrellas of Cherbourg' (1964)\n\nYet another umbrella-heavy song-and-dance musical, this bittersweet French film follows a young Catherine Deneuve, who works at a boutique selling umbrellas. She falls in love with a mechanic and gets pregnant, but has to move on without him when he gets drafted into the Algerian War.\n\nWATCH IT\n\n'West Side Story' (1961)\n\nThis love story for the ages tells the tale of Romeo and Juliet, but this time the couple is caught between two rival gangs: the Jets and the Sharks. A gang member falls in love with his rival's sister—played by It-girl of the day Natalie Wood—and trouble brews in the form of many elaborate dance scenes.\n\nWATCH IT\n\n'White Christmas' (1954)\n\nThis film popularized the version of \"White Christmas\" everyone knows, but it's also got a bunch more catchy, underrated tunes and not one but two romances. It was the highest-grossing musical ever at the time, and even though it's now very vintage, it makes for essential viewing during the cold weather.\n\nWATCH IT\n\n'Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory' (1971)\n\nIt's not just a meme: This strange, surreal, over-the-top movie also features a number of catchy songs. Gene Wilder has never been better as the wacky and kind of sadistic chocolate factory owner, and the songs about each selfish kid's nasty demise are beyond catchy.\n\nWATCH IT\n\n'The Wiz' (1979)\n\nThis late-70s musical puts a funky spin on the iconic plot of The Wizard of Oz, giving the classic musical a fun facelift. Starring music legend Diana Ross as Harlem schoolteacher Dorothy, The Wiz is a completely star-studded musical experience; Michael Jackson, Richard Pryor, and Lena Horne are just a few of other the notable cast members!\n\nWATCH IT\n\n'The Wizard of Oz' (1939)\n\nPerhaps the most famous musical ever, it transported audiences to the technicolor land of Oz, filled with flying monkeys, witches, and a wizard. Judy Garland plays a wayward girl trying to find her way home, accompanied by a medley of characters like the Lion, the Scarecrow, and the Tin Man.\n\nWATCH IT\n\nBest Dramatic Musicals\n\n'Burlesque' (2010)\n\nMaybe the \"small-town girl moves to the big city\" trope is a little tired, but we can forgive the cliche plot thanks to this musical's stacked cast and the incredible pipes of Christina Aguilera. She stars as Ali, the small-town girl who moves to L.A. and finds a home at the Burlesque Lounge. With Aguilera's voice and appearances from Cher, Stanley Tucci, Kristen Bell, and Eric Dane, it's worth the watch.\n\nWATCH IT\n\n‘The Color Purple’ (2023)\n\nMultiple stars of the Tony-winning revival of The Color Purple reprised their roles for the Oprah Winfrey-produced on-screen version of the musical interpretation of Alice Walker’s classic 1982 novel. Fantasia Barrino and Danielle Brooks took on Celie and Sofia, respectively, yet again—both nabbing Golden Globe nominations—while Taraji P. Henson portrayed Shug in this timeless tale about women’s resilience and sisterhood, set in rural Georgia in the early 1990s. Even as it examines Celie’s trauma and journey to independence, this film is vibrant, warm, and full of outstanding musical numbers.\n\nWATCH IT\n\n‘Dancer in the Dark’ (2000)\n\nBjörk gives one of the all-time best on-screen performances by a musician in Dance in the Dark. In this Lars Von Trier drama, she portrays Selma, a Czech immigrant and factory worker in Washington state saving money for an eye operation. As she copes with her impending loss of vision, musicals are her one escape. It’s a tragic film and Björk has alleged that she experienced harassment and difficulties in working with Von Trier, she’s a transfixing vision and more than deserved her Best Actress Award at Cannes in 2000.\n\nWATCH IT\n\n'Dreamgirls' (2006)\n\nYou'll remember this as the movie that launched Jennifer Hudson into international stardom, but it's so much more than that. Dreamgirls takes its inspiration from the history of Motown and The Supremes. The story follows a girl group known as The Dreams and their manipulative record executive. Plus, Beyoncé's in it, and we'll watch anything with Queen Bey.\n\nWATCH IT\n\n'The Greatest Showman' (2017)\n\nTaking its inspiration from the story of P. T. Barnum's creation of the circus and the lives of its star attractions, The Greatest Showman is truly a work of art. The songs are catchy earworms, enough to look past the many artistic licenses they take with Barnum's history. Try not to cry when Keala Settle sings \"This Is Me,\" I dare you.\n\nWATCH IT\n\n'Hamilton' (2020)\n\nTechnically this is a proshot of the Broadway production, but we couldn't not include it on this list. From start to finish, Lin-Manuel Miranda's smash hit show is a masterpiece in choreography, music, story, and costumes. Who knew history could be so entertaining?\n\nWATCH IT\n\n'In the Heights' (2021)\n\nLin-Manuel Miranda's hit Broadway musical gets the expansive, artistic film treatment thanks to John M. Chu (Crazy Rich Asians) directing. The joyous melodic energy of characters living in Washington Heights, from those dreaming of a better future to those who have made a life there, is infectious and deeply relatable. And if you're familiar with the musical, there are some additions and updates, including a new song.\n\nWATCH IT\n\n'Inside Llewyn Davis'\n\nInside Llewyn Davis leans more indie character study than a movie musical, but it's also one of the best depictions of what it means to be a struggling artist in an indifferent world. The titular folk singer is skillfully brought to life by then-newcomer Oscar Isaac, with the help of a haunting soundtrack produced by T Bone Burnett.\n\nWATCH IT\n\n'Les Miserables' (2012)\n\nKeep the Kleenex close at hand during this weepy French musical set in the 19th century. In it, an ex-convict named Jean Valjean (Hugh Jackman) takes in an orphan named Cosette after her mother dies. Valjean's former jailer, the police inspector Javert (Russell Crowe), continues to pursue him as France begins to split before the Paris Uprising of 1832.\n\nWATCH IT\n\n'Rocketman' (2019)\n\nThis film about the life of Elton John combines the best of a dramatic biopic and a classic movie musical, with the singer's legendary performances mixed with trippy scenes of a crowd floating as he plays at a club or a festival flash mob joining in on \"Saturday Night's Alright (For Fighting)\". It's one of the best musician life stories you'll see, even if you only know one or two of the Rocket Man's songs.\n\nWATCH IT\n\n'Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street' (2007)\n\nAdapted from the legendary stage play, Tim Burton's take is dark, unsettlingly, and entertaining as hell. Johnny Depp plays the titular demon barber hell-bent on getting revenge for the death of his wife, while Helena Bonham Carter delivers an equally captivating performance. With Burton's trademark visuals and music from Stephen Sondheim, a.k.a. one of musical theater's greatest composers ever, Sweeney Todd stands out in a great way.\n\nWATCH IT\n\n'tick, tick...Boom!' (2021)\n\nBefore he hit it big with the rock opera Rent, Jonathan Larson was a struggling playwright working in a dinner and dreading his 30th birthday. Based on Larson's autobiographical musical, this film nails the everyday chaos and existential dread of your mid-20s, and Andrew Garfield is a literal revelation (he shockingly had never done musical theater before this!). Prepare for the tears to flow on this one.\n\nWATCH IT\n\nBest Comedy Musicals\n\n'8 Women' (2002)\n\nIs this film completely ridiculous? Absolutely, but it's also a who's who of iconic French actresses having a ball in a twist on the classic murder mystery. The patriarch of a family is found dead, and one of eight women must have done it. Then it turns into a musical with a bunch of super-catchy songs.\n\nWATCH IT\n\n'Chicago' (2002)\n\nChicago's Velma Kelly and Roxie Hart are two of the most badass roles for women in Broadway history. Here, Catherine Zeta-Jones and Renee Zellweger play the jailhouse rivals in this larger-than-life musical about crime, fame, and revenge.\n\nWATCH IT\n\n'Everybody's Talking About Jamie' (2021)\n\nThis film is inspired by true events and originated on stage. High schooler Jamie New wants to be a drag queen but faces prejudice from classmates, his father, and society. Undeterred, he pushes on with the help of mentor Loco Chanelle (Richard E. Grant). The choreographed song and dance numbers, with Jamie becoming Mimi Me and finding his true self, are gorgeous.\n\nWATCH IT\n\n'Hairspray' (2007)\n\nThis feel-good comedy stars John Travolta and Nikki Blonsky in a story about a teen in the 1960s who loves to dance and wins a spot on a local TV show. The new role catapults her to stardom, and she tries to use her spotlight for good to encourage more diverse casting.\n\nWATCH IT\n\n'Hedwig and the Angry Inch' (2001)\n\nThere's never a dull moment in this rock musical from John Cameron Mitchell about a transgender punk performer. Trouble ensues when, on a tour of the U.S., Hedwig runs into a former flame who stole all of her songs.\n\nWATCH IT\n\n'Mamma Mia!' (2008)\n\nABBA fans, this one's for you! The film boasts a stellar ensemble cast of Meryl Streep, Amanda Seyfried, Colin Firth, Pierce Brosnan, and Christine Baranski. The plot follows a young future bride who invites three men to her upcoming wedding, with the hope of finding out which one is her father.\n\nWATCH IT\n\n'Mamma Mia 2: Here We Go Again' (2018)\n\nIf you liked the original Mamma Mia, there's more where that came from! Here We Go Again serves as both a prequel and a sequel, with the plot being set after the events of the first film, but featuring flashbacks to 1979, telling the story of Streep's character's arrival on the island of Kalokairi and the first time she meets her daughter Sophie's three possible fathers. It's the rare sequel that might be better than the original.\n\nWATCH IT\n\n'Pitch Perfect' (2012)\n\nOkay, yes, the film is technically about Anna Kendrick's Beca as the reluctant a cappella singer, but the true joy of this film is the artistry at work on screen. We catch a glimpse of singers and groups with killer harmonies, and the music celebrates that love and energy. There's a reason this spawned two (not as good) sequels.\n\nWATCH IT\n\n'Sing Street' (2016)\n\nA coming-of-age tale of a boy who forms a band to impress a girl—and then the band ends up being really, really good. It features remakes of classic songs from Sing Street, Hall & Oates, The Cure, and Duran Duran, as well as some gloriously OTT '80s fashion. What's not to love?\n\nWATCH IT\n\n'Sister Act 2: Back in the Habit' (1993)\n\nWe have nothing but love and respect for the first Sister Act (1992), but the sequel might be one of the best musical films of all time. Whoopi Goldberg reprises her role as lounge singer turned nun Sister Mary Clarence, this time helping St. Francis Academy stay open by turning her class of rowdy teenagers into a legit show choir, and a young Lauryn Hill also stars in the film as a moody student with powerhouse vocals. Let's not forget about the choir's incredible remix of \"Joyful, Joyful,\" which, is the most lit rendition of the Christmas classic ever made.\n\nWATCH IT\n\n'Weird: The Al Yankovic Story' (2022)\n\nEven if you're only slightly familiar with Yankovic's discography of pop-culture parody songs, this absurd biopic—featuring Daniel Radcliffe as the titular singer—is a wild, irreverent watch. Just remember that this movie is just a parody of a biopic: details of the artist's actual life have been wildly exaggerated.\n\nWATCH IT\n\nBest Romance Musicals\n\n'A Star Is Born' (2018)\n\nThe fourth (and arguably the best) remake of the 1937 film is co-written and directed by Bradley Cooper and stars none other than Lady Gaga. It's about a hard-drinking musician (Cooper) who discovers and falls in love with a young singer (Gaga), and her rise to stardom. Gaga is a force in this film, delivering a performance that will break your heart. This is not the most \"light-hearted\" fare, relative to others on this list, but the music is good enough to look past that. Check out content warnings beforehand if you don't know the plot.\n\nWATCH IT\n\n'Cinderella' (1997)\n\nThe classic story of Cinderella and her glass slipper has been told countless times, but it's not a stretch to say that the 1997 musical film is the single most important iteration of the fairytale ever. Starring Brandy as our heroine and Whitney Houston as her fairy godmother, Cinderella features one of the most diverse casts on the silver screen and marked the first time that Black girls everywhere were able to see themselves as princesses too.\n\nWATCH IT\n\n'La La Land' (2016)\n\nCreated as a \"modern musical\" by director Damien Chazelle, this L.A.-based, Oscar-winning film follows an aspiring actress (Emma Stone) and a traditionalist jazz musician (Ryan Gosling) as they struggle to hit the big time, but adorably hit it off instead.\n\nWATCH IT\n\n'The Last Five Years' (2014)\n\nA man and a woman tell the story of their marriage through two different timelines, with the husband's songs starting at the beginning and the wife's starting at their separation and going backward. This musical is more heart-wrenching than the lighter options, but Anna Kendrick and Jeremy Jordan's excellent performances will make you both laugh and sob.\n\nWATCH IT\n\n'Moulin Rouge' (2001)\n\nThis love-it-or-hate-it musical from director Baz Luhrmann reimagines popular songs from modern artists like Elton John and The Police, despite being set in early 19th-century bohemian Paris. The most beautiful courtesan at the Moulin Rouge dancehall (played by Nicole Kidman) and a poor writer (Ewan McGregor) fall in love but must keep their romance a secret or risk shutting down the cabaret.\n\nWATCH IT\n\n'Once' (2006)\n\nA street musician and a Czech immigrant make an unlikely pair in this indie-film-that-could, which nabbed several Oscars and launched a Broadway musical run. You won't find any overproduction or jazz hands in this sparse film, but the musical arrangements from Glen Hansard and Marketa Irglova are gorgeous and worth listening to in surround-sound.\n\nWATCH IT\n\n'Sunshine on Leith' (2013)\n\nA movie, based on a musical, based on a bunch of songs by The Proclaimers. This is the sweet story of two veterans who go home and deal with familial and romantic entanglements. An early vehicle for George Mackay, it's a tender film and filled with talented people. Just wait until the characters get to their rendition of \"I'm Gonna Be (500 Miles).\"\n\nWATCH IT\n\n'West Side Story (2021)'\n\nFor his modern remake of West Side Story, Steven Spielberg highlighted new elements of the original beloved story, adding historical context to the Jets' and Sharks' neighborhood, and rich backstories enriching the immigrant tale at the story's center. And like the original, it catapulted a new Maria and Anita (newcomer Rachel Zegler and Oscar winner Ariana DeBose) into superstardom.\n\nWATCH IT\n\nBest Family Musicals\n\n'Beauty and the Beast' (1991)\n\nIt's a tale as old as time. And one that never gets old. There have been many iterations of this story, but nothing quite lands as this adaptation from Disney's Golden Era. Disney's animated Beauty and the Beast film took home two Academy Awards for Best Original Song (for the song \"Beauty and the Beast\") and Best Original Score thanks to the genius composer, Alan Menken. With its spot-on songs and heartrending story, this Disney classic is worth a rewatch at any age.\n\nWATCH IT\n\n'Encanto' (2021)\n\nWhether you were a theater kid or not, a Disney animated film was probably your first movie musical, with the fun and heartfelt songs inspiring you to sing along. This more recent smash hit from the House of Mouse is about a young woman coming of age in a magical family in Colombia. It's a reminder that the love of these films goes far beyond childhood, and a great song can make you cheer or sob at any age (and even chart on Billboard!).\n\nWATCH IT\n\n'Enchanted' (2007)\n\nThis movie is part homage, part parody. Giselle (Amy Adams) is a Disney Princess who is ejected from the animated land of Andalasia into the live-action world of New York City, and, let us tell you, shenanigans ensue. Adams has great singing chops, and James Marsden is a true joy as a self-absorbed prince vying for Giselle's heart. Alan Menken and Stephen Schwartz's soundtrack is the best part.\n\nWATCH IT\n\n'High School Musical' (2006)\n\nThe year is 2006, and you and your friends are gathered in front of the television. Suddenly Zac Efron appears on the screen, and a scream erupts in the living room. Why? You're watching the premiere of High School Musical, that's why!\n\nThe Disney musical follows the journey of a popular jock who finds his love and his voice, much to the displeasure of his friends and family. HSM was so successful that it spawned two sequels and two spinoffs. And yes, we still know the choreography of \"We're All in This Together.\"\n\nWATCH IT\n\n'Into the Woods' (2014)\n\nBased on the legendary Broadway musical of the same name, Into The Woods intwines the plots of all of the best fairytales from your childhood—Little Red Riding Hood, Jack and the Beanstalk, Rapunzel, Cinderella, and several others—all in one big magical bow. This film features an ensemble cast of legendary actors like Meryl Streep, Emily Blunt, Chris Pine, Anna Kendrick, and James Corden. The fantasy comes to life in this gorgeously shot musical.\n\nWATCH IT\n\n‘Matilda the Musical’ (2022)\n\nRoald Dahl’s beloved character Matilda doesn’t just have telekinetic abilities in this adaptation of his 1988 children’s novel, she also sings and has killer dance moves. Just over a decade after the West End turned the story about a miraculous, young girl who’s misunderstood and mistreated by her parents into a stage show, it got the movie-musical treatment to magical results. It’s wildly playful, with inspired schoolyard choreography and a standout young ensemble. Plus, Emma Thompson seems to have a lot of fun making Ms.Trunchbull into a terrifying villain of her own.\n\nWATCH IT\n\n'The Muppets' (2011)\n\nA retooling of the beloved Henson characters (and an Oscar winner for Best Original Song), this stars Amy Adams and Jason Segal as the human counterparts to their fuzzy costars. Muppet fan (and Muppet himself) Walter must help Kermit & co. from the evil Tex Richman. Will they get the band back together and save Muppet Theater? Obviously, yes, but it's super fun getting there."
