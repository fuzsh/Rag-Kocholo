        "text": "by Sarah McDonie\n\nAct I\n\nPrisoners form lines to report their names, occupations, and residences to a Nazi guard. We hear moaning, shrieking, and sobbing. The prisoners gather and ask why they are there. They demand an answer.\n\nWe meet Anne Frank. Like the prisoners, she introduces herself. It’s Anne’s thirteenth birthday celebration—but the prisoners are still in view. Anne receives her diary. After she promises to confide everything to her new diary, the scene shifts to the Frank family’s arrival to the Secret Annex. Mr. and Mrs. Van Daan and their son, Peter, soon join them. To celebrate their safe arrival, the two families, and Miep, the Franks’ friend and helper while in hiding, toast to their futures. Anne and Margot show Peter his room. The prisoners return to the stage in greater numbers, and Anne comments that the Annex has gained another member: Alfred Dussel, a dentist. We soon join Mrs. Van Daan and Edith Frank in the kitchen preparing potatoes.\n\nWhen Anne goes to sleep that night, she has a vivid nightmare. The Westertoren clock’s ominous chiming accompanies unearthly sights and sounds of German guards and prisoners in Anne’s dream. Anne sees one of her school friends murdered in a concentration camp. She screams out, and her parents rush in to comfort her. Afterwards, Otto sits alone, lamenting that life has come to this. Edith joins him and encourages him to get some rest. They comfort each other, believing their daughters will survive the war. Sometime later, Anne is sitting at her desk, reporting on the latest happenings: news from the BBC, Mr. Van Daan is in a bad mood because of a cigarette shortage. She’s interrupted by her mother. Anne is annoyed. Anne is then left alone by the window. Looking out, she admires the green plants and trees.\n\nDussel is annoyed because he can’t find his cushion. He talks to Otto, blaming Anne for its disappearance. Edith comes to ask Anne if she is ok; Anne says it’s nothing sunshine can’t cure. She reflects alone about the physical and emotional changes she’s experiencing. We hear a scream from a hysterical Mrs. Van Daan: she’s furious because Mr. Van Daan insists that Miep sell her fur coat for money to buy cigarettes. Anne is at her desk, reflecting on the things she misses about normal life.\n\nThe act ends with Hanukkah celebrations in the Secret Annex and concentration camps, interspersed with the singing of drunk German guards. Anne declares that she still believes in the goodness of people. A sudden racket downstairs jolts the members of the Secret Annex: they are terrified that the police have found them. They are silent as the curtain falls.\n\nAct II\n\nWe return to the Secret Annex members, all frozen in the positions in which we last saw them.\n\nAnne and Peter talk alone in his room. The scene shifts to everyone singing the praises of the BBC as they discuss the Allied forces’ latest victories. But Otto shatters their optimism: what if Germany wins? Everyone exclaims that this can’t happen. Edith can’t find Anne; Anne is writing in her dairy. The relatively peaceful Annex gives way to the concentration camp once again, where we hear moaning and the recitation of names.\n\nThe Annex comes back into view. It’s time for Anne and Margot to have Latin lessons with their father. After their lesson, Anne runs off to see Peter. Anne asks Peter if he’s ever been kissed. News then comes over the radio from the BBC that the war is over in Rome. Everyone hopes that this is a sign that the war will soon be over in Holland, too. Anne sits in her quiet place and boldly draws back the curtain to look outside. She sees a wedding party walking down the street and wonders if she or Margot will ever marry. Edith sees her and scolds Anne for looking out the window during the day. She then asks Anne and Margot to help shell beans. Anne walks away, talking to herself; she’s convinced that she wants an extraordinary life, to live forever through her writing. Margot joins Anne, and they share a sisterly moment, talking of boys and the future.\n\nAnne goes back to writing. Otto walks in, accidentally interrupting her thoughts and encourages her to return to her pen and paper. Anne soon hears the entrance to the Annex open. Miep arrives with a special present for Anne: a pair of bright red, sequined pumps. Anne is delighted. As she learns to walk in heels, the other members of the Annex wander in to see what the noise is about. They all share a moment of imaginative play, celebrating Anne as their rising movie star.\n\nDisorder and darkness follow. The rooms are in disarray. The Gestapo has discovered the members of the Secret Annex. Sights and sounds of the concentration camp fill the stage. We see Anne among the prisoners, dirty and fragile. Pages from Anne’s diary fall from overhead, covering the stage. Prisoners aimlessly meander until, one by one, they disappear. Anne, too, is gone. All that remains are the pages of her diary.\n\nby Shulamit Ran\n\nAnne Frank: The Diary of a Young Girl was a book I first read in Hebrew—I think it was a gift I received on my Bat Mitzvah—and I have carried that inauspicious-looking, gray-covered volume with me through the decades that followed. There was nothing inauspicious about the content of the book, however! I was gripped by it, written as it was by a young teenage girl who, at the onset of the diary, was just barely older than me.\n\nGrowing up as a child in Israel, the book was by no means my first introduction to the difficult subject of the Holocaust, as it would be for so many of the tens of millions reading the book in its multiple translations to many different languages across the globe; because, as with so many of my generation and of the people I knew, many of my own family—a grandfather, two uncles, a young cousin, and many others, all of whom I never had the chance to know—perished in the Holocaust. But it was The Diary of Anne Frank that allowed me and countless others an intimate look into a life lost in a way I had never imagined before.\n\nOver the years, I have composed several works that in various ways have the Holocaust at their center, starting with O The Chimneys composed in 1969-70, and most recently in Glitter, Doom, Shards, Memory, my third string quartet, composed in 2012-13 for the Pacifica Quartet. But Anne Frank was not a topic I would have thought of in operatic terms. When the idea was first brought up to me (by Dennis Hanthorn, formerly general director of The Atlanta Opera), my first action was to approach librettist Charles Kondek, with whom I had a deeply meaningful prior collaboration on my first opera, Between Two Worlds (The Dybbuk). I knew that with him I could seriously explore how we might turn the diary into something that would be suitable for the operatic stage. We both shared the view that such an opera ought to be about Anne Frank and the unfolding of her story as depicted in her diary, but at the same time, bring into the opera a constant reminder of the outside, the horrific events taking place outside the cramped living quarters—the “Secret Annex”—where Anne and seven more people were hiding for two years before being discovered and sent to their deaths (Otto Frank, Anne’s father, being the sole survivor). We both sought to create an opera that would in some important way have two levels of action, thus placing Anne Frank’s story within its broader context.\n\nFrom the moment I made the decision that I would indeed create an opera that has the diary of Anne Frank at its center, I felt I had taken on a huge responsibility, and with responsibility comes risk. She, after all, had become such an incredible, larger-than-life, iconic figure for so many of us, her readers throughout the world. For a topic of this magnitude, I decided I would make full use of a large orchestra and a significant chorus in addition to the cast of nine principal singers. In our opera, Charles and I tried to show Anne as a young person of incredible imagination, exuberance, and wit—and a hugely gifted writer, of course—with an uncanny ability to comment on the world, on the people around her, on herself. She also can be seen as a visionary in terms of what she came to view, already at her young age, as her place in the world as a woman and her capacity as a writer. All that, and much, much more. And yet we wanted to show her as the real person that she was, not put her on a pedestal.\n\nMy opera has two acts that are structured into a succession of scenes (and I use the term “scene” very loosely here, as we are really talking of “situations,” large and small, or “focal points” that flow into one another) that have a large sweep to them, and some that are very intimate, almost chamber-music-like. It is through the use of the chorus that the larger context of this opera is created, the outside world that at all times is present and encroaching on the events inside the annex. Though closely based on the diary, neither the libretto nor the opera are intended to be a replication of the diary or attempt to follow a precise historical narrative. It is, first and far most, about the Anne Frank spirit and her humanity.\n\nFrom the first time I read it, three unforgettable words, a “bundle of contradictions,” have remained forever carved in my mind. Pkâ’at shel stirôt (פקעת של סתירות) is how I read it in Hebrew. These words appear on the last two entries of the diary, written by Anne on July 21 and August 1, 1944. In these words, Anne is describing herself with truly extraordinary psychological detail and insight. I remember reading this passage over and over, but also turning to the next page, refusing to believe that a next page was not to be had. Anne, of course, had no idea that this would be the last page of her diary. WE know where all of this was heading; SHE did not! And so it is up to us, the living, to preserve the memory, which I have tried to do in this opera.\n\nAcknowledgments from the Composer\n\nMany people and organizations deserve my heartfelt gratitude for enabling this opera to have been created and presented here today.\n\nOf that long list, special thanks must be expressed to Dennis Hanthorn, for lighting the flame in 2008; Maestro Arthur Fagen, who has been the opera’s guardian angel throughout; and Timothy Stebbins, for bringing it all together with grace and dedication.\n\nAnd finally, my opera could not have been created without the support—every day, at all times—of Avi Lotan, my beloved husband. I dedicate this opera to him.\n\n“Anne Frank and the Promise of Hope”\n\nby Crystal Manich\n\nAnne Frank’s story was known to me for decades. At age 12, I read her diary and was immediately moved by her remarkable strength given the circumstances of her life. Several years ago, I visited the annex in Amsterdam where she dwelled for two years, and her presence in my life became more profound. The idea of preserving her memory seemed necessary as a priority. We currently inhabit a world of misguided information, often done on purpose to mobilize factions and divide us, very much in the same way as was done in the Europe of World War II. When the opportunity arose for my taking on a world premiere of a theatrical representation of Anne’s experience, I jumped at what was the opportunity of a lifetime.\n\nThe most poignant aspect of my newfound journey with Anne Frank is the newfound profundity of the diary rereading it as an adult. As she writes, she questions whether her life will have any meaning. Little does she know that she is actively writing the most important document of the twentieth century. Her short life coupled with her very advanced writing, in which she pondered humanity as a whole, is an excellent source for us to review 80 years on. Of utmost importance, she questions the presence of hate in the world.\n\nThis production of the world premiere of Anne Frank was constructed to easily flow from scene to scene as we journey through the annex. A turntable allows us to experience an emotional passage of time as it revolves, creating a sense of entrapment and monotony. Surrounding the annex is a concentration camp, out of which walls are extracted and moved to create the annex itself. Video projections create a bridge to add psychological connection between the annex and the ever-present camp while also transporting us to various places that are expressed by Anne’s writing, whether implicit or explicit. The greater world outside looms large as the pressure of time builds within the annex.\n\nMy profound hope is that this representation of Anne will serve as a mere jumping off point for those who were unaware of her to now be unable to live without her for generations to come. We need Anne in our consciousness to cut through the darkness and provide the promise of hope.\n\nby Sarah McDonie\n\n(Musicology Ph.D. Candidate)\n\nWednesday, 5 April 1944\n\n“I know I can write. . . . I don’t want to live in vain like most people. I want to be useful or bring enjoyment to all people, even those I’ve never met. I want to go on living even after my death!”\n\nAnne Frank’s words are chilling in their foreshadowing yet warm in their affirmation of a fulfilling future. Since its publication in 1947, Anne Frank: The Diary of a Young Girl has been read by millions of people. Anne’s candid wit, humor, and, at times, piercing insight into the human condition continue to resonate with readers regardless of age. Themes of hope, resilience, and growing up connect us to Anne’s story. When we read Anne’s wish for immortality granted through authorship, we feel striking sadness knowing that her wish would be fulfilled—but not how she had hoped. After Anne and her family were arrested by the Nazi police on August 4, 1944, she was sent to the concentration camp Bergen-Belson, where she died of starvation and illness in the winter of 1945. But despite the trying circumstances of living in hiding leading up to her family’s arrest, Anne did not aggrandize or bemoan her situation. Instead, she chose to focus on everyday activities, objects, and feelings, and kept dreaming of her future. The Secret Annex—the upper levels of a pectin and spice factory where Anne and her family hid—may have been cramped, but its capacity for the varieties of human experience was boundless.\n\nAll this was told through the eyes of a young girl.\n\nWhen Margot, Anne’s older sister, received a call to join a Nazi work camp on July 5, 1942, their parents, Otto and Edith Frank, took immediate action. They had been preparing the hidden upper floors and attic of Otto’s business building into a long-term hiding place for over a year. The Frank family went into hiding on July 6, 1942, with the Van Pels family and Fritz Pfeffer joining them shortly after.\n\nBefore going into hiding, Anne received a diary for her thirteenth birthday. This is when we meet Anne in the opera. She thought her diary was the most beautiful present in the world. The birthday scene music is bouncy and cheerful. It features some of the most hummable melodies of the opera. Anne’s family and friends sing an enthusiastic “Happy, happy birthday girl!” again and again in celebration. As they tell Anne to fill her pockets with delicious birthday sweets “one after another,” the music hops from singer to singer, evoking the action of repeated candy stashing.\n\nAnne initially used her diary to write about daily life in the annex for her own enjoyment. But in the spring of 1944, she heard Gerrit Bolkestein, a member of the exiled Dutch government, send out a call during a London radio broadcast for personal accounts of life under German occupation. These were to be published after the war. Anne was inspired and quickly set about revising her existing diary entries while continuing to document her life in hiding.\n\nThe opera Anne Frank does not follow the diary’s content word-for-word. Instead, librettist Charles Kondek takes Anne’s diary as a starting point and foundation for this dramatic retelling of Anne’s story. Perhaps the most significant departure from the diary is the way the opera ends: in Bergen-Belson. Anne’s last entry is dated August 1, 1944, so we don’t have a firsthand account of her experience as a prisoner in the concentration camps. But this final scene is significant: we are not allowed the luxury of pretending that Anne Frank’s story ends happily.\n\nOne of the most striking features of this opera is its frequent layering of places and times. Scenes from the relative safety of the Secret Annex are put up against scenes from the Nazi death camps. An example of this is the Hanukkah celebration at the end of Act I. In a powerful show of resistance, the members of the Secret Annex share the stage with the prisoners, giving thanks in celebration of this important Jewish holiday. Shulamit Ran composed a beautiful new Hanukkah song specifically for this scene. This festive song creates a space of hope and determination for the Jewish people living a nightmare. German guards attempt to darken the scene with their drunken stumbling and boisterous singing, but they cannot overcome the light and love of the Hanukkah celebrants.\n\nThe harsh juxtaposition of life in the Secret Annex against life in the Nazi death camps is most apparent in the final two scenes of Act II. In Scene 12, the Franks’ friend Miep Gies visits the Secret Annex to surprise Anne with a sequined pair of red leather pumps. Anne’s delight with her present mirrors the joy she felt when she received her diary. The music becomes playful, mimicking Anne’s teetering steps as she learns to walk in heels. As Anne gains confidence, the music coalesces into a full-blown vaudeville number. The lightness of Anne’s dancing show tune is shattered immediately. Scene 13, the opera’s last, begins in chaos: tone clusters (thick blocks of notes that clash and blur) erupt from the accordion and the piano. Wails and groans from the prisoners fill the stage. The Frank and Van Pels families and Pfeffer are no longer protected by the annex’s walls. They are arrested and sent to a prisoner holding center before being sent off to different concentration camps. For Anne and her family, Shoal, meaning Holocaust, is at hand.\n\nWe see Anne one more time. She is ragged, cold, and fading. As the lights dim, Anne’s diary pages float to the floor. Anne is gone. Yet her words stand in testimony to what she and millions of others experienced, speaking to generations of people she would never meet. Yes, Anne is a writer. But more than that, she has become a voice for the voiceless, reminding us of the simultaneous horror and hope of the human condition.\n\nShulamit Ran’s music has been praised as “gloriously human,” “compelling not only for its white-hot emotional content, but for its intelligence and compositional clarity,” and “written with the same sense of humanity found in Mozart’s most profound opera arias or Mahler’s searching symphonies.” Ran began composing songs to Hebrew poetry at the age of seven in her native Israel. By nine, she was studying composition and piano with some of Israel’s most noted musicians, and within several years, was having her early works performed by professional musicians as well as orchestras. She continued her studies in the U.S., on scholarships from the Mannes College of Music and the America Israel Cultural Foundation. Winner of the 1991 Pulitzer Prize in music for her Symphony, she has been awarded most major honors given to composers in the U.S. Now the Andrew MacLeish Distinguished Service Professor Emerita at the University of Chicago Department of Music, where taught since 1973, she lists her late colleague and friend Ralph Shapey, with whom she also studied in 1977, as an important mentor. Ran’s music has been performed worldwide by leading ensembles, including the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, Philadelphia Orchestra, Cleveland Orchestra, Israel Philharmonic, New York Philharmonic, American Composers Orchestra, Mendelssohn, Brentano, Pacifica, Juilliard, and Spektral quartets, Chanticleer, and many others. Maestros Daniel Barenboim, Pierre Boulez, Christoph Von Dohnanyi, Gustavo Dudamel, Zubin Mehta, Yehudi Menhuin, Gary Bertini, David Shalon, and others have conducted her works. She served as composer-in-residence with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra between 1990 and 1997, and with Lyric Opera of Chicago in 1994-97, where her residency culminated in the premiere of her first opera, Between Two Worlds (The Dybbuk). The recipient of five honorary degrees, she is an elected member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. Among her numerous residencies were those at the American Academy in Rome and in festivals such as the Tanglewood Music Center, Aspen Institute, Marlboro Festival, Yellow Barn, Steans Institute at the Ravinia Festival, Wellesley Composers Conference, and many more.\n\nCharles Kondek’s first venture into musical theater was his one-act opera libretto Evol Spelled Backwards is Love. It premiered in Darmstadt, Germany, along with the small Mozart work Bastien und Bastienne. Kondek also directed, crisscrossing the new and old operas, earning rave reviews for both. Later, the Chicago Tribune in its review of The Fan, commissioned and produced by Lyric Opera of Chicago with a libretto by Kondek, called him “a shrewd man of the theater and this comic opera a blast of fresh air.” Nino Rota, composer for the three Godfather films, also wrote a delightful comic opera, The Italian Straw Hat. The opera’s English translation by Kondek was commissioned and produced by the Santa Fe Opera. The translation was later produced by the Camden Festival, London. He also wrote the libretto for Between Two Worlds, composed by Shulamit Ran, commissioned and produced by Lyric Opera of Chicago. Shortly after, the work was premiered in Bielefeld, Germany. More recently, Kondek is the recipient of the prestigious Marc Blitzstein Memorial Award in Music Theater presented by the American Academy of Arts and Letters. Of the four operas with the late Harold Blumenfeld, Seasons in Hell was called by the American Record Guide an “ingenious display of literary virtuosity.” The Cincinnati Enquirer called it “a fascinating coming together of words, music and imagery.” With composer Hugo Weisgall, Kondek wrote the grand historical drama Esther, commissioned and produced by New York City Opera at Lincoln Center and revived 10 years after the premiere. New York magazine called Esther “a work that can now be placed among the finest operas we have.” TIME magazine called Esther “a powerful evening of music-theater.” Noted critic Martin Bernheimer of the Los Angeles Times suggested Esther “may be a masterpiece.”\n\nArthur Fagen has been professor of orchestral conducting at the Jacobs School of Music since 2008. Additionally, he has been music director of the Atlanta Opera since 2010. He has conducted opera productions at the world’s most prestigious opera houses and music festivals. From 1998 to 2001, he was invited regularly as guest conductor at the Vienna State Opera, in addition to performances at the Metropolitan Opera, Staatsoper Berlin Deutsche Oper Berlin, Munich State Opera, and many more. On the concert podium, he has appeared with numerous internationally known orchestras. Fagen has an opera repertory of more than 75 works. He has served as principal conductor in Kassel and Brunswick, as chief conductor of the Flanders Opera of Antwerp and Ghent, as music director of the Queens Symphony Orchestra, and as a member of the conducting staff of Lyric Opera of Chicago. From 2002 to 2007, he was music director of the Dortmund Philharmonic Orchestra and the Dortmund Opera.
