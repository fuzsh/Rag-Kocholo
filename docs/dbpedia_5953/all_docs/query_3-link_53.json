        "text": "Check out my music:\n\nThe function of music in the movies is a very wide field.\n\nMusic can serve several purposes that are either important on the emotional side of the movie or help/enhance the storytelling. It is not only helpful but essential for any director/producer to keep the music in mind when planning/shooting the movie. For example collages that practically don’t work at all without film music can have a fantastic effect later with the appropriate music.\n\nYou can extend every function below by clicking on the arrow in order to read a description of this function.\n\nThe following list tries to be a comprehensive overview about possible functions of film music in a movie. Some functions overlap sometimes or some music serves several functions at other times.\n\nPlease consider joining me on Patreon for more educational material on film music, composition and orchestration.\n\n1. Commenting\n\nThis is a function that shouldn’t be overdone. Music can put a judgement on certain movie scenes, it can state that a certain battle scene is heroic, a certain dialogue is sad etc. In the early days of film music, the function of the music was most of the time to comment on the images. Nowadays we perceive this as an annoying redundancy most of the time but used cleverly it will help push the audience into the right direction.\n\nIn this clip the music creates a certain heroism for rather neutral images:\n\n2. Illustrating Movement\n\nAnother function that feels rather old fashioned and comedy. Accenting with the music every movement seen on screen is so-called mickey-mousing (coming from a scoring technique that was often used in Mickey Mouse cartoons). Hearing xylophone “plings” when someone raises his eyebrow etc. feels very cartoony however it can be great in slapstick moments and when done well even in dramatic situations.\n\nIn the following clip the music syncs up with motion in several occasions:\n\n3. Creating Plot Relationships\n\nThe use of so-called leitmotifs has been established by Richard Wagner in the opera and has often be used in film context since the early days of film music. Giving certain characters/situations/places thematic identities helps to connect certain plot points together. When the villian gets a theme and later we hear that theme again when somebody talks about a “stranger” we get a very clear hint of who that stranger might be. It doesn’t need to be that obvious for leitmotifs to work, of course. However, be warned to not overdo that technique. Not every supporting role needs a motif/theme and it can quickly feel very old fashioned when using this method extensively.\n\n4. Create Atmosphere\n\nThis is one of the strongest function of music in the movies. It can set the tone of the movie. Just by the way the score comes in for the first time in the movie makes it possible to know the genre and the “level of drama” of the movie. Of course exactly this really strong function can be used to create plot twists.\n\nThe intro of SILENCE OF THE LAMBS already sets the atmosphere for the entire movie in site of the visuals being rather neutral.\n\n7. Time/Period References\n\nMusic can also work very well to establish a certain time or period. Music that sounds very baroque will put us back into the 18th century but references can also be more subtle. Flashbacks over a few decades for for example can be very well supported by the musical style which adapts to the time portrayed in the movie and therefore makes the flashbacks more understandable.\n\n9. Manipulate\n\nOne of the functions of music that is and has been used quite a lot, even though it is not one of the most noble functions of music. Doubtful contents of a movie can be pushed into the “right” direction by music as it has been seen with lots of propaganda movies from all periods of times. However it can also be used very cleverly. For example when a character that is being portrayed as “the good guy” but actually is the villain. However in this case this fact will only be revealed at the end of the movie. Any moment before where the audience might get trapped into maybe thinking that he might be the evil guy, the music can jump in and manipulate in the way of working against these doubts.\n\n10. Alternate the Perception of Time\n\nThe perception of time is a fantastic playground for music. Just by altering the tempo of music, it can heavily push or drag any scene. Imagine a chase sequence where the music pushed with lots of tempo, exciting orchestration etc. compared to the same sequence with a calm, slow music. The latter one would almost feel like irreal but it would make the scene way less exciting. Same goes for any time perception. A scene where we see a person waiting which lasts only 30 seconds can be extended painfully in the perception by the music.\n\nIn this scene, the slow motion shots are being scored very excitingly giving this sequence the emotional importance:\n\n11. Imply a Sense of Space\n\nNot only the perception of time but also the perception of space can be influenced by the music. Using a very intimate piano+violin duo on a space science fiction movie might seem just as wrong as using a full symphony orchestra in a two character movie that’s taking place in a small flat. Also by the use of register (very deep sub bass or very high violin notes as opposed to music that plays mainly in the middle registers) can leave an impression of “size”.\n\nIn this dialogue scene, the music opens up the size of the underwater world by having a lonely flute line on top of rumbling basses/celli.\n\n12. Create Unreal Situations\n\nCharacterizing nightmares or situations of shock or being paralyzed can be done perfectly by the music. Anything that gives the feeling of not being real can be greatly enhanced by the music. Nightmares of characters can be made much more impressive with the right music.\n\nThis excerpt shows how music pushes the situation into a surreal atmosphere right from the beginning.\n\n13. Create Contradictions\n\nMusic that sounds like something that is not expected in a certain scene will create a feeling of “something is not right”. It works great for example on dialogues that are actually neutral from the content of what is being said. However having a really dark and sinister music under this scene will leave the impression that something will be happening, something might be wrong here.\n\nThis well known sequence from SCHINDLER’S LIST overlays the gruesome liquidation of the ghetto with a classical piano piece, creating the strongest musical contradicition possible.\n\n14. Parody\n\nMusic can influence very strongly whether we find a scene to be serious or laughable. It can use this ability to create fantastic parodies of characters or situations in the movie. One very simple example would be a character who pretends to be very evil and acts like this, however the music just gives him/her a quirky wannabe-evil march.\n\nIn this scene, the music sets some comedic parody moments:\n\n15. Physiological Conditioning\n\nMusic can also influence and stimulate our very basic emotions like fear and therefore evoke in a best case scenario every physiological consequence that comes with that emotion like racing heart, sweaty hands etc. Especially in the genre of horror and thriller, these effects are used extensively. A certain level of volume will make it impossible for the body and the conscious mind to detach from these emotions. Shock effects in scores/movies as well as terrifying buildups (cop sneaking in a dark basement – he’s approaching a corner – music gets louder and more terrifying etc.) are very common and work great, however quickly can feel like a cheap trick when used too often. It is also possible to influence into other emotional directions, which is more subtle and doesn’t have the obvious effect as fear etc.\n\nThis scene from INTERSTELLAR and its music create a strong sense of urgency, pushing the adrenaline:\n\n16. Implying Size Relations\n\nA little boy walking alone through a huge city is just a scene that might be very suitable for this use of film music. In this case the music can enlarge the visual differences between these things by giving the boy a little innocent flute motif on top of a very low, boiling music which might symbolize the huge city. In this way, things that can’t be seen like that on the screen can be set into relationship. If this little innocent boy from above might actually be a really brave, heroic person who has done or is about to do big things the music might set him into another “size” dimension to the city even though the images don’t reveal that yet.\n\n17. Psychologically Uniting the Audience\n\nOne of the most obvious case of such a function of music are national anthems whose function of course also is, to unite the “nation”. The same works in the music. Especially euphoric, heroic emotions can be used very effectively to get this collective emotion. Often, well known songs/music pieces can be used for that as they are easier accessable than music that the audience hears for the first time. However, even a very heroic score cue on top of a scene where the heroes of the movie walk through a crowd applauding a cheering at them after they fought the last big battle and won can create exactly this collective feeling of having been part of all that also with the audience.\n\nIn this scene the music unites the characters in the movie as well as the audience:\n\n18. Character Development\n\nMusic can help the audience to understand or develop character. For example, through listening to the song “When She Loved Me,” in Toy Story 2, the audience learns the sad story of the character “Jesse.”\n\nTrackbacks/Pingbacks"
