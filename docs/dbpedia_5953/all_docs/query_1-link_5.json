        "text": "Sir Arthur Sullivan's collaborations with librettists other than W. S. Gilbert have not weathered history well, although now and again they are revived as footnotes to the enduringly popular Gilbert and Sullivan canon. One of them, ''The Rose of Persia,'' resurfaced at a meeting of the Gilbert and Sullivan Society of New York, at CAMI Hall last Saturday evening.\n\n''The Rose of Persia,'' composed in 1899, was Sullivan's last finished opera and was the most successful of his post-Gilbert comedies. Its libretto, by Basil Hood, is in the Gilbert tradition, with situations set in exotic lands and based on compound mistaken identities, all described and resolved through clever word play.\n\nIt is, however, inescapably counterfeit Gilbert, well constructed but lacking a Gilbert libretto's brilliant sparks. And although Sullivan dressed the text in the jaunty, bright style for which he was famous, ''The Rose of Persia'' is unlikely to be mistaken for a great lost masterpiece.\n\nThe work is the story of Hassan, a merchant who prefers the company of beggars to that of rich people. His wife, Dancing Sunbeam, wants him declared insane by the priest Abdullah. But Abdullah certifies Hassan to be sane after Hassan signs a will leaving his riches to Abdullah, who plans to have Hassan executed.\n\nThe Sultana, Rose-in-Bloom, gets caught up in this when she and her slaves leave the palace in disguise. To avoid entanglements with the Sultan's retinue they hide in Hassan's house, but are discovered by Abdullah, who thereby finds the grounds for Hassan's execution. The Sultan is inclined to comply, but Hassan saves his skin (and the Sultana's) by meeting the Sultan's demand for a story with a happy ending: he offers an autobiographical sketch, making it impossible for the Sultan to execute him.\n\nWhat the Gilbert and Sullivan Society offered was not so much a performance as an unstaged read-through, conducted by Daniel Kravetz and accompanied on the piano by Andi Stryker-Rodda. The cast mixed professional singers with enthusiastic members of the society The best singers were Kate Egan, who sang with agility and humor as the Sultana; Kathleen Weber, who was Heart's Desire, a lovelorn slave; Stephen O'Brien, who was a smooth Hassan, and Richard Holmes and Michael Collins, who sang solidly as Abdullah and the Royal Executioner.\n\nThe operetta was preceded by the normal business of the society, including a sing-along of four songs from ''Iolanthe.'' The organization was founded in 1936 and attracted about 200 people on Saturday, enough to fill CAMI Hall."
