        "text": "TOP OF PAGE\n\nTuesday, March 31 at 7pm\n\nTHE TALES OF HOFFMAN – Digital Restoration\n\nDirected by Michael Powell, Emeric Pressburger (UK 1951) 138 min. DCP. With Moira Shearer, Robert Rounseville, Ludmilla Tchérina.\n\nPowell and Pressburger’s lush take on French composer Jacques Offenbach’s 1881 opera is an exhilarating marriage of cinema and opera: music, dance, color, light, and rhythm. The directors brought together an expert team for the production, among them Sir Thomas Beecham, who conducted the Royal Philharmonic; Moira Shearer, Ludmilla Tchérina, Robert Helpmann, and Léonide Massine, dancing principal roles along with choreographer Frederick Ashton; and cinematographer Christopher Challis, who roamed the sets with a liberated camera, freed from the usual demands of sync sound shooting (the film was entirely post-synchronized). Restored by The Film Foundation and the BFI National Archive in association with Studiocanal. A Rialto Pictures release. Introduced by Emily Martin, Visiting Assistant Professor of Music and Director of Bucknell Opera Workshop. Co-sponsored by Bucknell’s Music Department. Singers in the Bucknell Opera Workshop will perform songs from the opera downtown before the screening. More details will be announced on our website soon!\n\n“As intensely expressionistic as any film since Caligari, and at the same time a veritable nova of springtime élan, the movie inhabits a unique puppet-theater universe, and could seduce a eunuch. There’s just no describing this thing…” – Michael Atkinson, The Village Voice\n\nTOP OF PAGE\n\nTuesday, April 7 at 7pm\n\nTHE PRINCESS OF FRANCE- Director in Person!\n\nDirected by Matías Piñeiro (Argentina 2014) 70 min. DCP. With Julián Larquier, Agustina Muñoz, María Villar. Spanish with English subtitles. The latest of Piñeiro’s revisionist takes on Shakespeare imagines life imitating art when a Buenos Aires theatre company mounts a radio version of Love’s Labour’s Lost. The filmmaker’s familiar troupe of actors (last seen at the Campus Theatre in his international hit Viola) inhabit the roles of a young man returning from Mexico to rekindle his artistic pursuits and the five women with whom his past, present and future romantic entanglements intermingle. The lyricism of their flirtatious soliloquies fuses with the film’s fluid cinematography, the languages of theatre, literature and cinema melding into a spirited and knowing vision of love, desire, art, music and performance. Co-sponsored by the Bucknell Innovation Group (BIG).\n\n“Ever ready to take flight, [Piñeiro’s films] remain tethered to earth by the faces, bodies, and voices of the director’s wonderful stock company of Every(wo)man players; they’re playful without being frivolous, virtuosic without being showy, erotic without explicitness, transgressive without shock. … As The Princess of France attests, Piñeiro is one of the most exciting and accomplished filmmakers working today.” – Andrew Tracy, Cinema Scope\n\nTOP OF PAGE\n\nPLEASE NOTE TIME CHANGE – 7:30PM\n\nTuesday, April 14 at 7:30pm\n\nTHIRTEEN LAKES – Film Historian Scott MacDonald in Person!\n\nDirected by James Benning (U.S. 2005) 135 min. 16MM.\n\nFor four decades, James Benning has played a central role in the history of American independent cinema by offering rigorously structured, conceptually minimalist and gracefully wondrous meditations on the American landscape and its social and environmental histories. 13 Lakes presents as many bodies of water from across the United States – each chosen for its unique historical, ecological and geographical characteristics and offered to the viewer in static, 10-minute long shots. As an experience, the film is a seductive invitation to enter a richly nuanced and intimate contemplation of the mystery of the natural world. 13 Lakes was added to the National Registry in 2014. Co-sponsored by Bucknell’s Office of the Provost; Programs in Environmental Studies and Place Studies; and the Center for Sustainability and the Environment.\n\n“By the time the end credits identifying the lakes begin to roll, Benning has transformed his audience by modeling and demanding a more perceptually active sensual awareness of the world. This awareness argues that our culture’s tendency toward relentless distraction and hysterical consumption (and the latter’s planet-despoiling implications) need not be the inevitable product of modern life, and reminds us, as Thoreau reminded us in Walden, that slowing down and appreciating the moment-by-moment incarnation of the physical world can transform our sense of what we are and what we– as individuals and as a culture – need.” – Scott MacDonald, Artforum\n\nTOP OF PAGE\n\nTuesday, April 21 at 7pm\n\nDIVIDE IN CONCORD\n\nDirected by Kris Kaczor (U.S. 2014) 82 min. DCP. This tale of a “bottled water ban battle” follows the widely publicized efforts of Jean Hill, a local eighty-four year-old activist trying to stop the sale of single-serve plastic bottles in Concord, Massachusetts, site of the 1775 “shot heard round the world” that began a Revolution, and of Henry David Thoreau, father of environmentalism. In the 21st century, many Concord residents recycle, but chafe at the idea of being disallowed the freedom to decide what to buy. Chronicling Hill’s untiring crusade against her neighbors’ resistance to the ban – not to mention strong opposition from local merchants and the bottled water industry – Kaczor depicts the daily grind, the passion and the legislative hurdles of grassroots activism. Co-sponsored by Bucknell’s Center for Sustainability and the Environment.\n\nTOP OF PAGE\n\nTuesday, April 28 at 7pm – FREE FOR BUCKNELL STUDENTS\n\nTHE GRADUATE\n\nDirected by Mike Nichols (U.S. 1967) 105 min. DCP. With Dustin Hoffman, Anne Bancroft, Katherine Ross.\n\nBenjamin Braddock (Hoffman) graduates from college, moves back home and searches for direction, bouncing between an affair with the wife of his father’s partner (“Mrs. Robinson, you’re trying to seduce me…aren’t you?”) and her daughter, the woman of his dreams. The Graduate’s tale of restlessness and ennui, and its legendary Simon & Garfunkel soundtrack, was a generational milestone, and it remains a classic of the American screen – recommended viewing before commencement, Class of 2015!\n\n“The funniest American comedy of the year… Hoffman is so painfully awkward and ethical that we are forced to admit we would act pretty much as he does, even in his most extreme moments. Bancroft, in a tricky role, is magnificently sexy, shrewish, and self-possessed enough to make the seduction convincing… Benjamin’s acute honesty and embarrassment are so accurately drawn that we hardly know whether to laugh or to look inside ourselves.” – Roger Ebert"
