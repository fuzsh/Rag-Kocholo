        "text": "In Leroux's novel and most of its adaptations, Erik keeps up the pretense of being a ghost to control the Paris Opera House. At one point, he hears the voice of Christine Daa√©, a young soprano, and falls in love with her. He decides to teach her to sing, without showing himself, but at one point his feelings grow to obsession and he decides to show himself and try to make her love him back, only for her to reject him. In the end, he lets her go, but dies of a broken heart.\n\nThe character of Erik is based on rumors that Leroux said he had heard of an architect of the Palais Garnier, the actual name of the Paris Opera House, named Eric, who asked to be allowed to have an apartment underneath the building and live there, due to his disfigured face.\n\nIn the original novel, few details are given regarding Erik's past, although there is no shortage of hints and implications throughout the book. Erik himself laments the fact that his mother was horrified by his appearance and that his father, a master mason, never saw him. It is also revealed that \"Erik\" was not, in fact, his birth name, but one that was given or found \"by accident\", as Erik himself says in the novel. In the novel, Leroux sometimes calls him \"the man's voice;\" Erik also refers to himself as \"The Opera Ghost,\" \"The Angel of Music\" and attends a masquerade ball as the Red Death from Edgar Allan Poe's short story.\n\nMost of Erik's history is revealed by a mysterious figure, known through most of the novel as The Persian, or the Daroga, who had been a local police chief in Persia and who followed Erik to Paris; some of the rest is discussed in the novel's epilogue.\n\nErik is born in a small town outside of Rouen, France. Born hideously deformed, he is a \"subject of horror\" for his family and as a result, he runs away as a young boy and falls in with a band of Gypsies, making his living as an attraction in freak shows, where he is known as \"Le Mort Vivant\" (the living dead). During his time with the tribe, Erik becomes a great illusionist, magician and ventriloquist. His reputation for these skills and his unearthly singing voice spreads quickly, and one day a fur trader mentions him to the Shah of Persia. The Shah orders the Persian to fetch Erik and bring him to the palace.\n\nThe Shah-in-Shah commissions Erik, who proves himself a gifted architect, to construct an elaborate palace. The edifice is designed with so many trap doors and secret rooms that not even the slightest whisper could be considered private. The design itself carries sound to a myriad of hidden locations, so that one never knew who might be listening. At some point under the Shah's employment, Erik is also a political assassin, using a unique noose referred to as the Punjab Lasso.\n\nThe Persian dwells on the vague horrors that existed at Mazenderan rather than going in depth into the actual circumstances involved. The Shah, pleased with Erik's work and determined that no one else should have such a palace, orders Erik blinded. Thinking that Erik could still make another palace even without his eyesight, the Shah orders Erik's execution. It is only by the intervention of the Daroga (the Persian) that Erik escapes.\n\nErik then goes to Constantinople and is employed by its ruler, helping build certain edifices in the Yildiz-Kiosk, among other things. However, he has to leave the city for the same reason he left Mazenderan: he knows too much. He also seems to have traveled to Southeast Asia, since he claims to have learned to breathe underwater using a hollow reed from the \"Tonkin pirates.\"\n\nBy this time Erik is tired of his nomadic life and wants to \"live like everybody else\". For a time he works as a contractor, building \"ordinary houses with ordinary bricks\". He eventually bids on a contract to help with the construction of the Palais Garnier, commonly known as the Paris Opera House. Eventually his magical and musical nature takes over, and he builds a secret home for himself in the cellars.\n\nFalling in love with Christine Daae, he poses now as the Angel of Music, and she becomes his protege. In his isolation, Erik spends 20 years composing a piece entitled \"Don Juan Triumphant.\" In one chapter after he takes Christine to his lair, she asks him to play her a piece from his masterwork. He refuses and says, \"I will play you Mozart, if you like, which will only make you weep; but my Don Juan, Christine, burns.\" Eventually, after she has wrenched off his mask and saw his deformed face, he begins to play it. Christine says that at first it seemed to be \"one great awful sob,\" but then became alert to its nuances and power. Upon its completion, he originally plans to go to his bed (which is a coffin) and \"never wake up,\" but by the final chapters of the novel, Erik expresses his wish to marry Christine and live a comfortable bourgeois life after his work has been completed. He has stored a massive supply of gunpowder under the Opera, and, should she refuse his offer, plans to detonate it. When she acquiesces to his desires in order to save herself, her lover Raoul and the denizens of the Opera, he relents and allows her to leave with Raoul, content that she has let herself be kissed on the forehead once by him. Erik dies shortly thereafter, and Christine returns to the Opera to place a plain gold band he had given her on his finger. Leroux claims that a skeleton bearing such a ring was later unearthed in the Opera cellars.\n\nIn The Phantom of the Opera (1989), The Phantom of the Opera is the main antagonist of the 1989 film of the same name. Unlike his counterpart, who is portrayed in a much more sympathetic and tragic way, this phantom is an evil serial killer, who is much more evil and violent then the original phantom. He was portrayed by actor Robert Englund, who also played Freddy Krueger. HistoryThe Phantom's original name was Eric Destler. He was a young composer who was trying to write a new opera back in 1881. When he was practicing one day, he was approached by a man who told him he could make Eric's music as famous as Beethoven and Mozart. In return, however, Eric would have to sell his soul to Satan. Eric agrees. However, Satan only promised to make Eric's music famous, not Eric himself. The Devil mutilated Eric's face and told him that while people would love his music, no one could ever love Eric himself again. All the skin on Eric's face falls off, and Eric starts skinning people, so he can sew their skin on himself. PlotChristine Day lives in New York City in 1989. While trying to find a piece to perform at an opera audition, she finds a piece called Don Juan Triumphant by Eric Destler.\n\nWhile performing at her audition, she is knocked out and transported to London in 1881. Christine's identity changes mysteriously, she know is an opera singer who has no knowledge of her life in 1989. Meanwhile, The Phantom meets Christine in her dressing room and tells her that he is her \"angel\". He tells her he will teach her how to become one with the music. The Phantom does everything in his power to make Christine advance in her career. He kills a stagehand, and stores the corpse in the dressing room of the main actress of the show. She becomes so shocked she can't perform and Christine takes her place. The Phantom of the Opera (10 10) Movie CLIP - Not Forever!
