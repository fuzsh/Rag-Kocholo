        "text": "A CZAR IN MUFTI WOOS A naive shopgirl over a brimming stein of brew in a generic Viennese beer garden.\n\nThe stalwart Gaylord Ravenal seduces the dainty Magnolia to ''Only Make Believe'' on her moonlit Mississippi show boat. Rose Marie, a songbird on the lam in the Canadian wilds, finds her flinty heart dissolving to mush at the sound of the Indian Love Call, belted out by a Mountie whose facial expression is as changeless as the Rockies. This kind of delicious foolishness is a species of entertainment as endangered as the nitrate stock most of it was originally printed on. But starting this weekend, the film program at the Public Theater will resuscitate that much-maligned, occasionally-lamented genre, the movie operetta, in a monthlong series of more than 30 films.\n\nAlthough most of these movies date from the operetta's screen heyday, the 1930's, this series spans 60 years of film history, from the mid-20's to the 1983 film transcription of the Joseph Papp production of ''The Pirates of Penzance.'' And while the majority of the selections are theatrical works canned in Hollywood, there are imports as well - a trio of films from England, including Alfred Hitchcock's most atypical ''Waltzes From Vienna,'' the Weimar-era ''The Congress Dances,'' which manages to find fun in Metternich's Congress of Vienna, and the Gallic rarity ''Trois Valses,'' an irresistible showcase for France's premier prewar chanteuse, Yvonne Printemps. Particularly intriguing is a 1974 item entitled ''Singing on a Treadmill,'' from the gifted young Hungarian film maker Gyula Gazdag. Banned for a decade by government censors, it proves that in the right hands, even a genre as antiquated as the operetta can become positively subversive.\n\nAn enthusiastic commitment to this bygone form of entertainment might seem surprising, but Fabiano Canosa, program director at Film at the Public, feels these films are overdue for reassessment. ''We had never yet done a musical series at the Public,'' Mr. Canosa explains, ''and this seemed the perfect way to start. The operetta was really the first form of American popular music in the theater - some people would even refer to it as the dinosaur of the musical. These films haven't been widely available for so many years -most of them don't even show up on the Late Late Show. So we thought this was an ideal chance to introduce a new generation to this kind of movie, with beautiful prints seen the way they were first intended to be shown.'' For practical reasons, this series is less comprehensive than Mr. Canosa would have wished. The M-G-M studio output is emphasized in part due to L. B. Mayer's notorious predilection for hearts in waltz time but also because that studio's output has been preserved in pristine prints; the Universal library, comprising Deanna Durbin's vehicles and the early Lubitsch musicals made at Paramount, is largely unavailable.\n\nMoreover, Mr. Canosa has dubbed this program ''mostly operetta'' to fill it out with movies that don't quite fit the category. These include such films as ''One Night of Love'' (an operetta title if there ever was one), in which the Metropolitan diva Grace Moore sings excerpts from ''Madame Butterfly'' and ''Carmen,'' plus a pair of films from the 20's in which no one sings anything at all, being silent screen adaptations of famed operetta librettos - Ernst Lubitsch's ''Old Heidelberg,'' derived from ''The Student Prince,'' and Erich von Stroheim's ''Merry Widow.''\n\nBut then, the operetta form has always resisted precise definition, inhabiting that vague terrain between lyric opera and the more vernacular musical comedy. In his authoritative text, ''Operetta: A Theatrical History,'' Richard Traubner traces the birth of the true operetta to Paris in the mid-19th century, with the first theatrical triumphs of Jacques Offenbach. Mr. Traubner points out that unlike its forebear, the operetta comique, from the first, operetta was intended as popular entertainment, mounted for profit at commercial theaters in continuous runs, just like their musical-comedy progeny on Broadway or the West End in this century. * * *\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
