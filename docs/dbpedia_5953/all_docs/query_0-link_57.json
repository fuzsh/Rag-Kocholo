        "text": "Directors Tonya and Ryan McKinny in their program notes make the point that art is the opposite of war: art is about making connections and war is about destroying them. Silent Night is a marvelous work of art that makes a powerful statement about our commonality and how much we have to enjoy through peaceful coexistence, and how much to lose, when resorting to violence. Wolf Trap Opera’s production of it is creative, immersive, and impactful. This is a contemporary opera about the human heart, as are all operas I think, of a quality worthy of remaining in the repertoire, and more…a reminder of the past much needed today, even in August. In a world where people can embrace each other one day and shoot at each other the next, let the word go out - make art, not war…at the very least, don’t make war.\n\nThe Fan Experience: Performances of Silent Night were scheduled for August 9, 11, 15, and 17. in The Barns at Wolf Trap. The opera is sung in English, German, and French with English surtitles shown overhead. The performance lasted about 3 hours including a 20-minute intermission.\n\nThe pre-opera talk for this production was given one hour prior to the performance by Fight Director Casey Kaleba. He provided historical background for the opera and an interesting discussion on the challenges involved in staging fights and battles. This was an excellent lecture, though more info introducing the opera itself might have been helpful. An audio recording of “Silent Night” performed by the Minnesota Opera is available through retail and many music streaming services.\n\nThe Barns overall is an excellent venue for opera, intimate with good acoustics. Even the seats at the back and in the balcony are relatively close to the performers, but some of those in the very front and seats in the back on the floor lack a view of the surtitles. The floor seats are not tiered but those in the balcony are; some balcony seats are restricted view by structural posts. Food and beverages are available before the performances and during intermissions; drinks are allowed in the theater. During DC’s hot and humid summers, it has excellent air-conditioning. Parking is free, plentiful and is easy-in/easy-out.\n\nI hope I have conveyed to you that Santa Fe Opera’s production of Der Rosenkavalier is spectacular, even spectacular plus, with lovely singing, beautiful music, extraordinary staging, laugh out loud comedy, plus great emotional depth. The speaker at the pre-opera talk likened the Marschallin/Octavian coupling to Tristan and Isolde. The impetuosity of youth keeps me from going there, but my wife counters that our first true love can be very intense. Ok, but then Sophie comes along. I will grant that the last twenty minutes with the trio and then the duet of Octavian and Sophie is about as emotionally compelling as it gets, heavy with the conflict between what is desired and what must be.\n\nExcuse me, I see Cupid is beckoning you to attend. Are you game?\n\nThe Fan Experience: Santa Fe Opera scheduled performances of Der Rosenkavalier on July 20, 24, August 2, 8, 15. The opera is sung in German with subtitles in English and Spanish provided on individual screens on the backs of seats. The performance I attended on July 20 lasted four hours plus, including a 20 and a 35-minute intermission. During the long intermission as the final set was assembled on stage, SFO provided free coffee and tea for all attendees.\n\nMany attendees arrive early for the excellent opera talks one and two hours before the performance. The talk I attended for Der Rosenkavalier was provided by Oliver Prezant. Attending his insightful lecture, delivered in a humorous style, had me much better prepared to understand and enjoy the opera – highly recommended.\n\nThe Crosby Theatre of the Santa Fe Opera, which seats about 2,000 patrons is an open-air structure on each side and at the back of the stage. The design is modern and attractive. Sunsets and thunderstorms become part of the opera experience. See SFO’s detailed and helpful website for information on food/dining options available and for directions, and their performance schedule for the remainder of the summer.\n\nIn general, the SFO patrons were dressed in a casual style. There is a tailgating tradition at SFO, some astonishingly elegant. Bring a sweater or light jacket; Santa Fe is seven thousand feet above sea level; nights can be chilly even in July and August, and breezes flowing through the opera house can make it feel cooler.\n\nThere is a lot going on in this opera, and Director Newbury manages it well, keeping the focus on character development and illuminating the internal conflicts of the characters. The opera tells its story well; rather than repeating all scenes one after another, Mr. Newbury often has two or three scenes on stage at the same time with the spotlight shifting back and forth among them, sometimes with ensemble singing. This added to the cohesion of the storytelling and saved some time. Also, kudos to Scenic Designer Mimi Lien as well-designed sets were moved into and out of place with flowing, unobtrusive precision. Devario Simmons’ costumes clearly evoked the 1980s. Lighting Designer Japhy Weideman did well but was no match for the stunning visuals provided by the Jemez Mountains and clouds framing the lighting effects of a setting sun whenever the back panels of the stage were open; this beautifully scenic setting is a special benefit of attending Santa Fe Opera performances, transcendent once again.\n\nThe Righteous is powerful storytelling backed by beautiful music and singing. At the end of this powerful drama, the entire cast was on stage to sing a final prayer, the convergence demonstrating that all the changed, partially broken players were in the same group, the humans. I will be thinking about this world premiere for a long time to come.\n\nThe Fan Experience: Santa Fe Opera scheduled performances of The Righteous for July 13, 17, 26, 30. August 7, 13. The opera is sung in English with subtitles in English and Spanish provided on individual screens on the backs of seats. The performance I attended on July 17 lasted three hours and included a 25-minute intermission.\n\nThe Crosby Theatre of the Santa Fe Opera, which seats about 2,000 patrons is an open-air structure on each side and at the back of the stage. The design is modern and attractive. Sunsets and thunderstorms become part of the opera experience. See SFO’s detailed and helpful website for information on food/dining options available and for directions.\n\nSanta Fe Opera is located about five miles north of the city with easy access via highways 285/84 or a couple of backroads, if you are adventurous. As you move away from the heart of the city, you are quickly into the vast expanse of sky that New Mexico offers. The SFO program book includes this statement, “We acknowledge and pay deep respect to the people, elders, and ancestors – past, present, and future – of the Tesuque Pueblo whose beautiful lands have provided the stunning backdrop for our theatre and performances for over sixty years.”\n\nMany attendees arrive early for the excellent opera talks one and two hours before the performance. The talk I attended for The Righteous was provided by Oliver Prezant. Attending his insightful lecture, delivered in a humorous style, had me much better prepared to understand and enjoy the opera – highly recommended.\n\nThe tailgating tradition at SFO, some were astonishingly elegant, could not be observed this trip as it was raining when we got there. In general, the SFO patrons were dressed in a casual style. Bring a sweater or light jacket; Santa Fe is seven thousand feet above sea level; nights can be chilly even in July and August, and breezes flowing through the opera house can make it feel cooler.\n\nDr. Lind feels that a significant impact of Shakespeare’s words and storytelling is lost in this process. For SOT’s Macbeth, she sought to combine sections of Shakespeare’s words with sections of Verdi’s vocals and music holding on to the most critical parts of each. She stated, “My goal with Macbeth, as with all of the Shakespeare adaptations I arrange, is to keep to the original Shakespeare story as closely as I can while employing the enhancement of masterful opera composers’ works. Many opera composers cannibalize Shakespeare and add or take away characters. This serves the necessity of time, mostly, but sometimes it's to give an aria to someone or to wrap up a story more neatly in opera conventions. They mess up complex character arcs and leave out complete side plots or the most interesting speeches and couplets.\"\n\nShe mentioned several specific concerns with Macbeth: “Some things are best left unspoiled, like for instance, what I call Verdi's \"dudley do-right\" music of Malcolm coming in to save the day. That's not what Shakespeare wrote at all, he wrote Malcolm as a very young and untested soldier who needs Macduff, Ross and the Siwards to fight for him. He's hardly the heroic figure that Verdi portrays him to be in that music, and he does not fight Macbeth, but sends others. Macduff even has a tussle with him himself when Malcolm insensitively says: ‘let's get our revenge on that tyrant for killing your family’ without giving the poor man his moment of grief. In that way, Verdi's music for A la paterna mano is a brilliant addition, but it has to be coming out of the Shakespeare scene where he says I will do so like a man (take revenge,) but first, I must feel it like a man (meaning his grief.) Combining the two forces of Shakespeare and Verdi really gives you goosebumps and gets you right in the heart. Then there is something like Macbeth's Tomorrow and tomorrow speech. It's just so meaty in spoken word, adding music to it is gilding the lily!”\n\nAs I said, there was much to enjoy here; the mistakes in this “dress rehearsal” sort of became part of the fun. Alas, scheduling won’t permit, but I wish that I could see it again just for enjoyment. Dr. Lind calls this adaptation a jewel box opera; she has collected jewels from more than one source for a production. Indeed, she has, and for all she does, kudos to Dr. Lori Lind.\n\nThe Fan Experience: Performances of Shakespeare Opera Theatre’s Macbeth were scheduled for July 12, 13, and 14 at the St. Thomas Episcopal Church in McLean; additional performances were scheduled for July 20 and 21 at The Grace Episcopal Church in The Plains. The production’s dialog is in English and the vocals are in Italian with subtitles in English. The performance with Dr. Lind’s comments lasted about three hours, and the cast came out to mingle with attendees after the final applause. Given the difficulties noted in the text above, Dr. Lind offered attendees a free ticket to another performance or to another SOT production.\n\nShakespeare Opera Theatre performs classic works not by Shakespeare as well. Their next production will be another jewel box production, scheduled for December 6-15, titled La Vie de Bohéme, based of course on Puccini’s La Bohéme, which goes extremely well with the holiday season.\n\nSOT’s performances have more of a party atmosphere rather than the church service atmosphere of our major opera halls. I found little pretense with SOT; they readily own their limitations and still managed to engage us fully. Dress is “as you like it” and seating is at tables. Snacks and drinks are offered for sale which can be consumed before, during, or after performances. After a meal of Shakespeare, I frequently recall these words by Puck at the end of A Midsummer Night’s Dream:\n\nIf we shadows have offended\n\nThink but this and all is mended\n\nThat you have but slumbered here\n\nWhile these visions did appear\n\nAnd this weak and idle theme\n\nNo more yielding but a dream\n\nThe rub comes in Così fan tutte’s resolution found in classic productions. Don Alfonso’s cynicism is validated. Despina is disillusioned. The young lovers are resigned to marry, a troubling fate given what just transpired. This happy ending sits like a bit of undigested dinner in the stomachs of the audience. We are left hanging, with the future ahead not clear, and Mozart and Da Ponte never composed Così: the Sequel. But isn’t that ending as real or more real than Figaro’s love conquers all or Giovanni’s righteous resolution? Ms. Myslewski in her program note says this is a battle of the sexes where neither gender wins. Yes, but what is the war? I think Conductor Brandes and Director Rigazzi were on target in seeing the story as being about the loss of innocence. Isn’t the war the one taking place within ourselves, teaching us who we really are, more by defeats than victories? When our situation changes and challenges are confronted, what can we count on from others, or from ourselves, for that matter. The answers to those questions can be disillusioning and life changing. Così’s happy ending is not so happy and life goes on. While we are laughing, Mozart/Da Ponte have thrown us a curve. Where are our genuine selves among our wants, needs, ambitions, and societal rules? They place the ambiguities in our laps to take home; how do we deal with our failings? Perhaps, they intended to spread a message of the need for forgiveness given human frailty and inconsistency, but we are left wondering if these young people are going to be alright? Are we going to be alright? For me, along with the music and vocals, this is what makes Così fan tutte great and has me addicted. It’s always interesting to see what spin a new director will put on the ending. From here on, there will be spoilers.\n\nLet’s move on to the good stuff we can be happy with. First, there is Mozart’s music which is fabulous throughout the opera. The conductor for this production is Christine Brandes, formerly a performing soprano, who has turned her career completely to conducting. Her debut as a conductor was with the Seattle Opera in 2023. The Wolf Trap Opera Orchestra is chamber-sized, about 30 musicians placed in the small pit, with a harpsichordist and cellist, used for recitatives, placed outside the orchestra pit. The music features many solo instruments and small groupings in supporting singers and the mood of the scenes. I thought the relatively small size of the orchestra allowed me to hear and appreciate the different elements of Mozart’s composition more fully than I had in past. I always felt the playing was spot on, delightful really, and that the singers were well supported. I have to say I was impressed. Kudos to Maestro Brandes and thank you to the players. I also very much enjoyed the contributions of WTO’s Studio Artists, less experienced performers who served as an excellent chorus; kudos to Chorus Master Michelle Papenfuss. Mozart’s music is definitely one of the elements that keeps me returning.\n\nMozart provided all six singers with the opportunity to sing both beautiful solos and ensemble pieces that ranged from duets to sextets. I have always felt that Mozart was the champion of ensemble vocal composing, and Così is full of them. The six soloists are Filene Artists and all but one are returning artists. All of these young singers performed well both acting and singing. The role of Fiordiligi was sung by soprano Renée Richardson. She gave us a strong willed Fiordiligi who succumbed reluctantly and sang beautifully in her higher range, garnering applause for the opera’s best-known aria, “Como Scoglio” where Fiordiligi declares her resolve to remain faithful; she also showed an engaging lower range in several numbers. She sang a touching, “Per pietà, ben mio, perdona\" where she sings “pardon the error of a loving soul”. Ms. Richardson was well paired with mezzo-soprano Erin Wagner as Dorabella, who portrayed the more romantically adventurous sister convincingly. Her voice has an attractive timbre especially in the softer vocals, and her torment in “ah, Scotati…Smanie implacabili” conveyed the humor and pathos of the aria. Ms. Wagner is a new Filene Artist. Despina was played by mezzo-soprano Emily Treigle who was again a bit hammy, but an on-stage charmer and scene stealer. As she has done in the past for WTO, she sang well with a lovely voice.\n\nBTW, dramaturg Cori Ellison had the following statement in her program notes: “Ultimately, the men were in love with mere images of their fiancées and the women were in love with love.” Hmmm. That’s a tidy statement that allows us to nod and put this work of art away, case closed. Boys will be boys and girls will claim to love them anyway. But is it that simple? Was there really no genuine love felt by Fiordiligi who suffered so or by Ferrando who claimed he still loved Dorabella? Are members of a gender all like that? Così fan tutte…it’s complicated. Put your worry caps back on.\n\nThe Fan Experience: Performances of Così fan tutte were scheduled for June 21, 23, 27, and 29 in the Barns at Wolf Trap. The opera is sung in Italian with English libretto shown overhead. The performance lasted a little over 3.5 hours.\n\nFor this performance, the stage was extended out and around an opening for the orchestra pit. I was seated close to the stage and with this arrangement the volume of the orchestra was fine where I sat. The Barns is a relatively small theater. The advantage of this arrangement was that the performers could move out almost close enough to touch the audience. Most of the opening for the orchestra pit was netted in case anyone forgot where they were. Occasionally one could see Conductor Brandes’s hands waving at stage level out of the orchestra pit.\n\nThe Barns overall is an excellent venue for opera, intimate with good acoustics. Even the seats at the back and in the balcony are relatively close to the performers, but some of those in the very front and in the back on the floor lack a view of the supertitles. The floor seats are not tiered but those in the balcony are; some balcony seats are restricted view by structural posts. Food and beverages are available before the performances and during intermissions; drinks are allowed in the theater. During DC’s hot and humid summers, it has excellent air-conditioning. Parking is free, plentiful and is easy-in/easy-out.\n\nThe tale of this production is itself an interesting story. Turandot was written in 1924 by composer Giacomo Puccini with a libretto by Giuseppe Adami and Renato Simoni. Following his death, Puccini’s family commissioned his student Franco Alfano to compose new music for the ending based on Puccini’s sketches; the new music begins with the Calaf/Turandot confrontation following Liu’s demise and processional. When first performed in 1926, famous conductor Arturo Toscanini stopped where Puccini had left off and departed the stage in honor of his friend Puccini; subsequent performances included Alfano’s ending that uses the original libretto by Adami and Simoni. While other companies have massaged the ending, Alfano’s is the one that is still primarily produced today. At 100 years old, the opera has entered the public domain giving companies a freer hand in making changes. Opera Delaware will produce Turandot with its own new ending next week, with some tickets remaining.\n\nThe fairytale plot of Turandot is based on a commedia dell’arte play of Gozzi which is based on a Persian story. The opera tells the story of a Chinese Princess from long ago who required any suitor seeking her hand in marriage to correctly answer three riddles; there was a catch, the punishment for failure was death. Thirteen had tried and failed. Enter Prince Calaf who answers the riddles correctly. Turandot still resists but finally falls in love after a single, uninvited kiss from Calaf, who then reveals his name. Puccini was still struggling when he died to come up with an ending that satisfactorily made sense of Turandot’s turn around. My son, on experiencing the opera for the first time, said that only in opera can there be a love story about a mass murderer. Other concerns in modern day audiences have been its historical misrepresentations and concerns with the opera reinforcing prejudicial stereotypes of Asian people, and importantly its treatment of women. Personally, I have always viewed Turandot as a Grimm-like preposterous fairy tale where love conquers all in the end. The plot was far-fetched and not satisfying, but oh my goodness, the music and vocals were out of this world. Calaf’s aria “Nessun dorma” is perhaps the most famous in all of opera.\n\nWNO’s artistic director of the last fourteen years, Francesca Zambello, had never been happy with Turandot’s ending, and it has not been performed by WNO since 2009. With the opera entering the public domain, she decided to invest in and direct a new version. Working with composer Christopher Tin and librettist Susan Soon He Stanton, the decision was made to make the background story of the brutal nature of the warlord control of China in that period more apparent in the opera and to change the ending to make it more understandable that Turandot, rather than being heartless, had a heart hardened by events – from Ms. Zambello’s program note, “She rules as she has been ruled: with brutal tyranny.” To their credit, this new production and the new ending work. I suspect it will be adopted by many other opera companies, especially given its bottom line of success for WNO.\n\nThat said, far be it from me not to quibble as I meander through the issues. I grant that names of ministers - Ping, Pang, and Pong - has always made me wince at the racial overtones. However, they have provided the much-needed comic relief in this bloody tale. Comic relief is in short supply in WNO’s version. WNO’s calling them by their minister position name is accurate, but their portrayal as frustrated bureaucrats in a totalitarian regime was not that amusing. Plus, the inaccurate portrayal of China allowed designer Franco Zeffirelli to create, and audiences to enjoy, his fabulous staging that adds a measure of charm to the opera. In fact, I found WNO’s version to be rather dreary until the sure-footed female dancers in military outfits started dancing. Somehow, WNO does make the redemption of a woman who bumped off 13 suitors more acceptable, and it does have more of a feel-good ending. Let’s not forget that this is a fairy tale meant to convey a message overall. Fairy tales have the charm of letting you get the moral feel good without believing the story. Yes, if it also promulgates harmful messages, that needs to be addressed. So, on the measure, I contend that Washington National Opera’s 2024 Turandot is the better version, though improving the story alone would not make it so overall. We continue…\n\nFrancesca Zambello reliably gives great show; she is a Washington DC treasure. She and WNO general director Timothy O’Leary displayed bravery in moving this project forward. She noted in her pre-opera talk that this was Puccini’s largest effort in terms of people and staging involved – ten singers, ten dancers, a sixty-member adult chorus and a twenty-member children’s chorus, a 73-piece orchestra and a 14-piece off stage banda, in addition to creative staff for set design, costume design, hair and makeup, and production staff for staging. There were over 250 individuals involved in this production. I noted that at times the stage was as packed with performers as the sold-out theater was with audience members. Bravi to all and kudos for a well-deserved success!\n\nComposer Christopher Tin is a two-time Grammy award winner. Perhaps that gave him the courage to compose new music in juxtaposition to some of Puccini’s greatest when this is his first opera composition; for insight into his approach to this task, check out his Youtube video at this link. My hearing was that it was a job well done, interesting in orchestration, pleasing to the ear, and working well coupled to the vocals containing the new libretto. There is a video clip sample of the new ending at this link. Guest conductor Speranza Scappucci and the WNO Orchestra played the music of both Puccini and Tin beautifully, though a few times I would have preferred a bit more volume to match the power of the singers for this production. The new libretto by Susan Soon He Stanton, an award winning screenwriter for the HBO series, Succession, included some beautiful poetry working well with Mr. Tin’s music, though more direct in messaging than that of Adami and Simoni, in creating Turandot the Merciful. I especially liked Calaf pleading, “My love has broken everything except hope.” Then, by will and courage Turandot rises above her dark side and turns a brutal military regime into an open and fair-minded democracy through the redemptive power of love. Maybe it was a little over the top; as Turandot says to Calaf at one point, “Pretty words.” Yet, I accepted it because it is a fairytale, and I wanted to believe it, maybe I do believe it. In this version, it is Turandot who initiates the first kiss, but not until Calaf has risked his life by divulging his name. One line might have been better earlier in the scene: when Turandot hearing his name declares she has won and Calaf says, “I don’t have to lose for you to win”, there was a smattering of laughter from the audience in a highly dramatic moment. Let me restate that I liked the new libretto a lot.\n\nWNO’s staging of Turandot was updated from ancient China to something more mid-twentieh century China of a militaristic, authoritarian society. The set by Wilsin Chin was an oppressive contruction of frame and flooring that wrapped around and from top to bottom of the stage until the ending scene. The costumes by Linda Cho were mostly a serious grey both of the officials and the culturally mixed people in the courtyard who were stranded in Beijing after their prince’s head was chopped off. For me, the dancers with choreography by Jessica Lang and Kanji Segawa were a delight, a bit of pleasure in an unfun society. The movements of the performers and the flow of the story were well configured by Director Zambello, with her usual professional touches like having a follower brutally pushed back when trying to comfort the prince going to his execution and the placement of the guillotine scaffold against the backdrop of a full moon once the wrap around frame opens up at the final scene. Lighting design was by Amith Chandrashaker and projection design by S. Katy Tucker. Looking at photos to select for this blog report gave me a much higher appreciation for this work’s set, costume, lighting. and projection design than I had at the performance. They are exceptional.\n\nKudos to Washington National Opera for providing a much anticipated and rewarding night at the opera. The new production with a new ending successfully achieved its goals. After this one, you still may not like Princess Turandot, but you will understand her better, and the primary message of the opera, the redemptive power of love, comes through more clearly and thus, more powerfully in this version. Now the challenge rests with us, to apply that force in our own lives. One wonders what the ending might have been if Puccini had been given more time, likely striving for the same effect. Judged as entertainment, this and Alfano’s version were closer in merit, but in meeting opera’s goal of being a humanizing influence, WNO’s is the winner. For the record, my wife was even more enthusiastic about the new production and ending than I was and feels I should have used more superlatives in describing the performance. Sigh…\n\nThe Fan Experience: WNO scheduled performances of Turandot for May 11, 13, 17, 19, 22, 24, 25. Performances on May 24 and 25 will have a different cast. The opera is sung in Italian with English subtitles shown overhead. The performance lasts 2.5 hrs not including a 25 minute intermission. This is a new production with a world premiere ending and is a coproduction of WNO, Opèra de Montrèal, and Dallas Opera. May 11 was the WNO Gala performance of the opera. A pre-opera talk is available one hour before curtain time for ticket holders. While performances are sold out, some tickets get returned to the Kennedy Center which are then made available; try checking the website or calling the box office frequently if you wish to snag a ticket.\n\nParking in the Kennedy Center is typically plentiful at around $25 per day, with a small discount for Kennedy Center members when reserved ahead of the day. The Metro to Foggy Bottom and the free red Kennedy Center buses, from there to the Kennedy Center running every 15 minutes, are an excellent option. There is an advantage in getting there a bit early. KC frequently has multiple performances on its different stages overlapping that can create traffic jams.\n\nThere are snack stands in the main lobby, and on the Terrace level, the KC Café offers food cafeteria style at moderate prices; fine dining is available on the Terrace level in the Roof Terrace Restaurant. Food and drinks except water are not allowed inside the opera house, but you can purchase reusable capped containers with your drinks that you can take inside. Take the container back with you on your next KC visit to get a discount on your drink.\n\nIt's easy to understand why Les Fêtes de Thalie was huge success in its day, liberating to some degree a repressed society from strict entertainment rules, reminiscent I think of arrival of rock and roll in the America of the 1950s, i.e. the Ed Sullivan variety show on TV would not show Elvis below the waist, his gyrations offending many of the older set. I also agree with Momus that each element of opera-ballet, the music and singing, the story and poetry, and dance are gifts to its audience. It is also easy to see how such a work as Fêtes could be successful today in a time when we can sorely use some entertainments without sadness, especially if delivered with the extensive investigation, authenticity, the high quality of performers, charm, and delight of Opera Lafayette productions. Once again, OL has brought forward a mostly forgotten, but still worthy, work within a framework fully accessible to modern audiences. Bravo!\n\nThe Fan Experience: Opera Lafayette scheduled performances for Les Fêtes de Thalie on May 3 and 4 in the Terrace Theater of the Kennedy Center. The performance was about 2.5 hours including one intermission. The opera-ballet was performed in French with English subtitles shown overhead. Soprano Margot Rood was originally part of the cast but had to withdraw due to health reasons; her roles were sung by Paulina Francisco.\n\nOpera Lafayette is offering a printed program book for the season of Madame de Maintenon for a $5 charge; it includes expert essays for each of this season’s productions. An online version is available for free at this link. The pre-opera talk hosted by Ryan Brown and featuring a talk by music historian Professor Rebecca Harris-Warrick took place one hour before the performance. She worked with Opera Lafayette in planning this work and has a feature article in the program book. I searched in vain for a recording of the opera-ballet.\n\nAn OL fund raising gala is planned for May 7 in NYC and performances in NYC were scheduled for:\n\nOctober 26, 2023, Couperin Le Grand at the Kosciuszko Foundation\n\nMay 7, 2024, Les Fêtes de Thalie at Museo del Barrio\n\nMay 9, 2024, From Saint-Cyr to Cannons: Moreau and Handel’s Ester in St. Peter’s Church\n\nThis concert version was performed semi-staged in the regal ballroom of the Engineers Club with the stage at one end, reminiscent of its venue for the performance for the emperor. Semi-staged seemed almost full staged since the action takes place in a theater; the singers were in character with interacting and moving about the stage for comic effect. Director Claire Choquette did a masterful job keeping the action flowing and devising set ups for comic elements, particularly the ringside effects for the battle between the two sopranos. Much of the humor was slapstick, Chaplinesque in style. However, the transformations of the sopranos who discussed how they had come to sing opera were truly heart rending, as their motives for their behavior became clear. The final comments by Francine surely came directly from Ms. Cooke in emphasizing the singers’ involvement to seek fulfilment by becoming artists and their need for connection to the community they serve, and while challenging, it is worth it.\n\nBravo to Opera Baltimore for taking the risk of offering its audience something original, that deepened the understanding of all that they had shared over 15 years. I found it to be a humorous, heartwarming, and entertaining afternoon; I never once felt the urge to look at my iPhone. I was eager to see what was going to happen next.\n\nThe Fan Experience: The Impresario was performed in the Engineers Club on April 10, 12, and 14. The opera was performed in English with some arias performed in the original language; subtitles in English were shown. The performance with one intermission lasted close to 2.5 hours.\n\nDr. Aaron Ziegel, OB’s Scholar-in-Residence provides a pre-opera talk one hour before each performance. He also provides three or four one-hour, highly informative Zoom classes for ticket holders on each upcoming opera. This review was informed by his online lectures on The Impresario. These lectures are maintained and available online to all at this link.\n\nOpera Baltimore will soon be announcing its new season for 2024-2025 and is offering a 16th Season Preview Party on June 4.\n\nFrom a personal perspective, I hope the success the company is enjoying does not cause them to move completely away from the concert format. As I previously wrote, when first attending Baltimore Concert Opera performances, “The power of operatic voices is a thing to behold, especially engaged with them for an entire evening. It will surprise you when you encounter these voices up close for the first time. You’ve probably experienced the difference between hearing opera singers live in the major opera houses and hearing them on a recording and gotten a taste of the power and clarity of the live performance. Well, hearing them a few feet away takes that experience to yet another level.” It keeps me coming back.\n\nThe roles of Lisette and Prunier were sung by soprano Deanna Breiwick and tenor Jonathan Johnson, young singers who have performed at major opera houses around the US. Ms. Breiwick sang well and gave us a convincing cheeky maid with dashed aspirations and a winning heart. Mr. Johnson’s bright tenor displayed well in several arias and gave us a reasonably convincing poet, pretentious and exacting in love. Both of these young performers appear headed for greater things. Rambaldo was played by a now international opera star and a local favorite, baritone Javier Arrey whose voice adds color to any performance. He gave Magda’s companion, Rambaldo, a softer edge, more likable. I couldn’t help but wonder if the storyline would have been aided by having Mr. Arrey play Prunier and Mr. Johnson play Ruggero, giving us a more worldly wise Prunier and a more youthful lover for Magda to abandon. Playing Magda’s friends and adding to the fun were soprano Tess Ottinger, soprano Natalie Conte, and mezzo-soprano Melanie Ashkar.\n\nWith La Rondine, I feel Puccini provided the melodious music and the showcase roles for excellent singers to display their wares for this opera to be a hit, but in the end, had trouble knocking down the three-point shot to win the game, to return to my basketball analogy. For a “comic opera, lighter in nature”, I would have preferred a happy ending or at least one more bittersweet than bitter. That said, WCO with this cast, headed by Ms. Perez made for an exceptional performance.\n\nThe Fan Experience: Washington Concert Opera performances are typically one and done, and for me, are always a highlight of the opera season. La Rondine was performed on April 7 in Lisner Auditorium. The opera was performed in concert style and sung in Italian with English surtitles on an overhead screen.\n\nWCO has announced their productions for the 2024-2025 season which is expanded to three operas instead of their normal two: Puccini’s Manon Lescaut on November 24, Mozart’s La clemenza di Tito on March 1, and Verdi’s Luisa Miller on April 13. WCO Executive Director stated in her pre-opera comments that Lisner Auditorium would be upgrading their seats over the summer, more legroom for the orchestra section and more comfort for all.\n\nPeter Russell, General Director of Vocal Arts DC, presented a pre-opera talk and provided program notes. His talks are impressively detailed and informative.\n\nIn my experience, all the seats in Lisner Auditorium are fine for viewing the performance, but the sound is probably better towards the center of the auditorium. Parking on the street around the auditorium is catch as catch can; be sure to read the signs! Metro is two blocks away. WCO has a visitor web page with directions and parking info, helpful in finding nearby parking lots.\n\nThe remainder of the cast was mainly the highly talented Cafritz Young Artists and mezzo-soprano Taylor-Alexis Dupont who played the performer Celeste; all contributed handsomely. The three muses were played by Teresa Perrotta, Kresley Figueroa, and Cecilia McKinley. Jonathan Pierce Rhodes played the role of Priest and Justin Burgess the role of a local tough guy who made fun of Piquillo’s predicament. Standouts were Justin Burgess as Don Pedro the manager of the speakeasy and Sahel Salam, his partner in chicanery. I thought Mr. Salam showed a spark ready for a TV sitcom.\n\nI thoroughly enjoyed Songbird as over the top entertainment. It was fun just to see this cast and creative team at work. Not that it needed it, but in this step to the side of opera, Isabel Leonard moved her star even higher in the pantheon. In his program comments, WNO’s General Director stated, “As you know, we are trying to expand the horizons of how we produce opera, whether it be in content, casting, interpretation, or actual production”. Songbird has made me sit up and take notice. We are already promised a new ending in WNO’s Turandot coming up next. What new wrinkles might be coming in the 2024-2025 season?\n\nThe Fan Experience: Performances of Songbird in the Eisenhower Theater were scheduled for March 9, 11, 15, 17, 20, and 23. The libretto is mainly in English with French mixed in, and lyrics are shown on the overhead screen; run time was about 75 minutes with no intermission.\n\nWNO’s Turandot will run May 11, 13, 17, 19, 22, 24 and star Ewa Plonka as Turandot and Jonathan Burton as Calaf and will be directed with a new ending by Francesca Zambello. The 2024-2025 season has been announced at this link.\n\nParking in the Kennedy Center is typically plentiful at around $25 per day, with a small discount for Kennedy Center members when reserved ahead of the day. The Metro to Foggy Bottom and the free red Kennedy Center buses, from there to the Kennedy Center running every 15 minutes, are an excellent option. There is an advantage in getting there a bit early. KC frequently has multiple performances on its different stages overlapping that can create traffic jams.\n\nThere are snack stands in the main lobby, and on the Terrace level, the KC Café offers food cafeteria style at moderate prices; fine dining is available on the Terrace level in the Roof Terrace Restaurant. Food and drinks except water are not allowed inside the opera house, but you can purchase reusable capped containers with your drinks that you can take inside.\n\nDirector Ben Robinson developed this version of Elixir for Anchorage Opera’s production. In his message in the program notes, he stated that in adapting a classic opera to a new setting, he “wants to account for every musical nuance that the composer infuses into the piece.” I believe in that he was largely successful. Still, the updating was a two-edged sword. The plot line required a greater suspension of disbelief than the classic versioin, difficult to believe that a reserved television cameraman would be unable to come up with twenty bucks and moving to a nearby set carries less weight than being conscripted to go into the military. The set presenting a television sound stage with lights, cameras, and action worked convincingly; kudos to Scenic Designer Rochele Mac. Overall, it was a familiar setup for modern viewers raised on television. The overhead screen showing what a TV audience would be seeing added interest but was also a distraction. The building tension between the two would-be lovers needed focus and time to simmer to also bring the audience more deeply into the love story. I thought the pace supported the comedic aspects over the love story. The colorful costumes were fun and accented the light-heartedness of the opera; kudos to Costume Designer Kathryn Braden. The action was well-orchestrated by Director Robinson.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed the performance; it was colorful and fun, and I liked being able to view the story through a different lens. The music and the singing were wonderful. At the same time, I felt the nostalgia for the 80’s television had been substituted for the simple charm of the classic staging. It was great entertainment, but for me, the human poignancy got a little bit overshadowed in the shuffle and the love story less compelling. Also, I felt that Felice Romani’s dialog had been altered to the point that perhaps this version should be given a new name, maybe “Nemorino Loves Adina”, adapted from The Elixir of Love. Perhaps it would have worked better for me if I had not seen the classic version first. Nonetheless, it was an enjoyable afternoon, and Annapolis Opera continues to play above its weight in presenting fine arts entertainment to its community.\n\nThe Fan Experience: Performances of The Elixir of Love were scheduled for March 15 and 17 in the Maryland Hall for the Creative Arts . The opera was sung in Italian with supertitles in English shown on a screen over the stage; the performance ran about two and half hours, including one intermission. Parking at the Maryland Hall was free.\n\nThis was the last staged production of the season for Annapolis Opera, but two more events are scheduled:\n\nApril 14 – Voices of Our Time: Vocal Competition All Stars; tickets at this link.\n\nMay 5 – 36th Annual Annapolis Opera Vocal Competition; this is a free event. I personally recommend this one, some of the best singing you will hear and at a price that can’t be beat. You also get to vote on your favorites.\n\nOne production performed in 1689 gave her more than she bargained for. She persuaded the great playwright, Jean Racine, employed by the court, to write a play about the biblical story of Esther and called on the court master of music Jean-Baptiste Moreau, to write music suitable for the performance. In the story, Esther has been selected by Persian King Ahasuerus to be his queen, unaware she was Jewish. Her cousin Mordecai incurs the wrath of Prime Minister Haman by refusing to bow to him, only willing to bow down to God. Haman sets in motion a plan to annihilate all Jewish people. At Mordecai’s urging, Esther pleads with the king, revealing she is Jewish and exposing Haman’s intentions. Ahasuerus, remembering that Mordecai once saved him from an assassination plot, sides with his bride and orders Haman’s execution. The choice of this story seemed appropriate and safe, with a religious theme and an avoidance of sexual issues. Though experts assert the story is not backed by historical record, Esther is viewed as an important parable of God’s deliverance. Many in Louis XIV’s court also saw Madame de Maintenon reflected in Esther and Louis XIV in Ahasuerus, coincidence or not. OL’s edition of Moreau’s Esther was created by French Musicologist Anne Piéjus, who worked with Opera Lafayette on this production.\n\nThe schoolgirls at Saint-Cyr were trained in theater and acted in performances, a practice not allowed at other schools of the period. The court provided elaborate sets, costumes, jewelry, and musicians for the shows. Keep in mind that there was no age of consent in France at that time and young women, often still girls, married early. Also keep in mind that the acting in the performances was exciting and created feelings of personal empowerment for the girls, generally suppressed for young women of that day. Finally, consider that male courtiers were known for rakish behavior. What might have been predicted occurred; the performances became a scandalous affair, causing Madame de Maintenon to clamp down further. Her agenda to use the theater as social media of the day to promote her view of morality had backfired (see The Fan Experience section below for a note on an essay by Philip Kennicott relating that event to social media today and an essay by Benjamin Bernard on schools of that period offering an alternative to moral education by the church).\n\nFor the Handel section, three male singers joined the women featured in the Moreau section. The role of Haman was sung by bass-baritone Jonathan Woody (who also served as musical co-director of the program), that of Ahasuerus by tenor Jesse Darden, and tenor Patrick Kilbride was in the role of Tenor II. Interactive singing between some of the characters in the oratorio excerpts heightened the emotional appeal, such as the duets between Ms. Francisco as Esther and Mr. Darden as Ahasuerus. Handel’s music allowed more color by the singers and allowed more expression of emotion. Haman was given more prominence in Handel’s version for greater dramatic impact. Handel used music and vocals from another work of his for parts of Esther, which gave Haman the odd chore of singing about the merit of forgiveness at one point. The finale where the vocalists came together as the choir to sing, “The Lord our enemy has slain” was a fitting, strong finish with added emphasis from a trumpet. At several points in the oratorio, vocal and musical riffs reminded me of Handel’s The Messiah, and though OL’s small chorus had a gorgeous sound, I did find myself wishing for a much larger chorus. At one point, perhaps between excerpts, Mr. Taylor seemed to be jamming on the harpsichord. It might be fun to hear more of that. Each of the singers was a pleasure, and the musicians again delivered an impressive performance. Conductor Taylor was wise to place Handel’s Esther last in the program, though the limited excerpts from both Moreau and Handel left me wanting more.\n\nOnce again, my wife and I headed home from an Opera Lafayette performance feeling that we had experienced something not just enjoyable, but something special.\n\nThe Fan Experience: Opera Lafayette scheduled performances of “From Saint-Cyr to Cannons: Moreau and Handel’s Esther” for February 8 in the Kennedy Center and May 9 in St. Peter’s Church, NYC. The performance lasted an hour and a half, including one 15-minute intermission. Moreau vocals were in French and Handel’s in English; subtitles in English were shown for both. The program brought to mind for me the October 7 attack of Hamas on the people of Israel, but it was set and planned prior to that event. Soprano Margot Rood was originally cast as Soprano I and Esther but had to withdraw due to illness.\n\nOL’s 2023/2024 season will conclude on May 3, 4 with “Mouret’s Les Fêtes de Thalie” in the Kennedy Center and May 9 in the Museo del Barrio, NYC.\n\nThe program book, still online at this writing, contained informative program notes by musicologist Anne Piéjus, an excellent essay by Washington Post Art and Architecture critic Philip Kennicott drawing parallels between the French court’s reception of Esther and impacts of today’s social media, and an also excellent essay by music historian Benjamin Bernard who covered private school education at a contemporaneous boys school, Collège Mazarin, and the girls school at Saint-Cyr, Maison royae de Saint-Louis. In addition, they held two zoom meetings with creative staff to discuss these productions, Salon I and Salon II, still available online.\n\nOn a closing note, there is a 2000 film titled “Saint-Cyr” available for purchase, but only in French, that covers the personal history of Madame de Maintenon and the Esther performances. Because I had not seen the film, through OL, I asked their expert in the area, musicologist Anne Piéjus for comments on the historical accuracy of the film; she is Director of Research at the CNRS Institute for Research in Musicology. Many thanks to her for a detailed response. I have included her comments below, slightly edited to maintain the focus on the film. She has further piqued my interest in seeing the film and learning more:\n\n“Patricia Mazuy's film (2000) is based on the novel La Maison d'Esther, published in 1991 by actor Yves Dangerfield……another film about Saint-Cyr and Mme de Maintenon, L'allée du roi, made only 4 years earlier, by director Nina Compañez, is based on the magnificent novel L'allée du roi by historian Françoise Chandernagor….. Saint-Cyr is a pretty film, but it's a long way from reality. The sets at Caen Abbey are magnificent, and the story of the two little Normandy girls who speak poor French is fairly faithful to what we know about the linguistic unification sought at Saint-Cyr Theatre and music also helped them to learn French. The female characters, masters of their own destiny, are quite convincing.\n\nHowever, in my opinion, there is a distorted reading of the story……[re] Mme de Maintenon (a \"beautiful brunette\" poorly portrayed by Isabelle Huppert) and the institution: the highly sexualized and unhealthy sado-masochistic relationship between Mme de Maintenon and the teenage girls, a sort of tawdry retelling of a real health problem in the 18th century: the tuberculosis epidemic that killed many pupils and adults. In the same vein, the scene with Mme de Maintenon washing herself in the pond after having sex struck me as highly inappropriate. Apart from the fact that she was hated at court, she would never have risked losing her reputation by making love in the wild like a prostitute.\n\nThe episode of Iphigénie [in the movie] is a classic in the romance literature of Saint-Cyr, but it is false…..\n\nWhat remains is the effervescence of the young girls, the theatre that went to their heads, the rehearsals, the court audiences, and the marriage that took place after the performance, all of which are attested to in the archives and fairly well captured in the film…..” Now, if only the company will re-issue the film with English subtitles!\n\nThe brevity of the opera is perhaps an advantage but also a limitation. In particular, the powerful story of William Still’s brother sprang and ended too quickly. I would have liked to have gotten to know the characters in all the stories better; then the tears that had welled up in my eyes at the end would have been tears rolling down my cheeks through much of the opera.\n\nThe travesty of slavery in the U.S. is of course well known. Sanctuary Road allowed me to experience not only the fear, anxiety, and desperation of the slaves, but also the courage of the men and women forsaking their family and friends, risking their lives to be free, and to experience the beauty of those who bravely aided and abetted them, whites as well as people of color. All of this with such beautiful music and singing. This is an opera I would go see again; I only wish that Sanctuary Road was a mini-series. Sanctuary Road is a gem with star quality. We need more like this one, operas that not only take us to dark places but also show us the hope for deliverance from evil.\n\nThe Fan Experience: Performances of Sanctuary Road were scheduled for January 26, 28 in Norfolk, February 3, 4 in Fairfax, and February 9, 11 in Richmond. The opera is written and performed in English with English subtitles on screen projections. The opera lasted for one hour without an intermission. The George Mason University Center for the Performing Arts theater, located on the GMU campus, is moderate in size, offering seat prices in different ranges – the same being true for other venues.\n\nMany thanks to Virginia Opera for providing its audience with a variety of operas from different ages, including modern operas and for their theme of showcasing operas with connections to Virginia. VO’s next production this season will be Madama Butterfly in Norfolk on March 8, 9, 10 and Fairfax on 16, 17 and Richmond on 22, 24. See this link for details. VO also just announced their 2024-2025 season which will feature the premiere of a new opera, Virginia v. Loving, with music composed by none other than Damien Geter.\n\nI always recommend the online presentations, given by Joshua Borths, Virginia Opera’s scholar in residence, which originate about a month before the performances and remain online for viewing. Viewing in real time makes it possible to ask questions of Mr. Borths. The online video for Sanctuary Road, can be accessed at this link, where Mr. Borths focuses on the operatic aspects of the opera, leaving the associated history for the pre-opera talks.\n\nFor Sanctuary Road, the pre-opera talks feature distinguished experts in black history. The pre-opera talk in Fairfax was given by Dr. Spencer Crew, currently the Clarence J. Robinson Professor of History at George Mason University and Emeritus Director of the National Museum of African American History and the National Museum of American History. Dr. Crew gave an interesting and highly informative talk about the Underground Railroad.\n\nGood morning, composer and librettist teams. Your mission, if you choose to accept it, is to come up with 20-minute operas, complete with music, vocals, and storyline to be presented semi-staged, with Cafritz Young Artist singers accompanied by a chamber ensemble of musicians from the Washington National Opera in the Kennedy Center in one year. You will receive mentoring from an established conductor, composer, and librettist, among others, and you will be given access to the resources of WNO. This tape will self-destruct in 5-seconds. Phfft! Smoke appears.\n\nEach year Washington National Opera’s American Opera Initiative selects three composers and three librettists through a highly competitive process, pairs them in teams, and gives them this charge. Their new works are premiered at the Kennedy Center the following January. The results are so engaging and so much fun, one could view this as a party game, but these creative artists are dead serious. It’s what they do, the drama behind the drama.\n\nOne year is a short time frame to conceive, construct, and develop to stage ready form for any opera, especially for young creative staff still developing their skills and talents. There is also general agreement that writing a 20-minute opera can be more challenging than writing longer works: the introduction, development, and resolution of a problem must be done in 20 minutes, and keep in mind that it takes longer to sing thoughts than to verbalize them…the music must help to tell the story. The mentors are already established in their fields and the team members already have strong CVs, replete with accomplishments and awards. The composer/librettist teams are to be in attendance and come forward to be recognized with applause at the end of each performance along with the performers. I felt that the volume of artistic talent in the Terrace Theater on Friday night must have caused the sides of the building to bulge.\n\nI find WNO’s American Opera Initiative exciting and look forward each year to seeing what these creative artists will produce. I also greatly look forward to seeing operas with stories I can more readily identify with, that in addition to the universal themes associated with human motives and actions, we encounter familiar landscapes, including TikTok, microplastics, and cell phones. The relevance of these operas to life today never has to be argued. Also, the production of new opera is only one goal of the AOI program. Giving librettists and composers the opportunity to work with mentors and with conductors, musicians, singers, and creative staff provides a boost in developing careers in opera and theater. AOI mentors this year were Conductor David Bloom, Composer Kamala Sankaram, and Librettist Deborah Brevoort. This is a fun and exciting event that typically sells out. One other thing you will see in audiences for AOI performances that you rarely see in the opera houses is lots of young people.\n\nHere are comments on this year’s group of three:\n\nA Way Forward\n\nComposer - Laura Jobin-Acosta\n\nLibrettist - José G. Alba Rodríguez\n\nCharacters and Cafritz Singers:\n\nJulia – Kresley Figueroa\n\nHelena – Winona Martin\n\nGabriel – Sergio Martínez\n\nHairpiece featured Esther, a wigmaker, Ari, a gender-nonconforming stranger who approaches her to have a wig made, and Gale, a guy the stranger had an encounter with in a bar. All three are dealing with identity issues: Esther is veteran wig maker with failing eyesight near the end of her career, who finds her craft being replaced by machine-made wigs; the stranger is seeking validation, and the guy had just lost a husband the previous year. Composer Redmond and librettist Norman state: “They want the world to see them on their own terms. They want their dignity.” Again, the Cafritz singer/actors delivered strong performances; each created their own identity and made connection with the audience through their singing. In analogy to wig making, the composer/librettist team planned to have different threads of music interweaving to reflect the stories and themes being interwoven on stage. There certainly was a lot going on in the orchestra, but too small a sample to get an overall gauge on it. That said, I enjoyed the music and found it interesting in its coupling with the drama.\n\nThe director for the semi-staging of the operas was Chloe Treat who effectively used the few props to assist in telling the stories. The staging of Forever was clever and worked to enhance the comic elements. Costumes by Timm Burrow were well done to support the dramas, with special kudos for Tardigrade’s costume. The orchestra on the small Terrace Theater stage was seated to the left in the back. All three operas were conducted by Maestro David Bloom leading the thirteen piece chamber ensemble from the Washington National Opera Orchestra, and applause to them for their excellent tight knit playing for all three operas.\n\nLong live the American Opera Initiative! There is so much good going on in the AOI program, good for audiences and everyone involved, and for the future of American opera.\n\nThe Fan Experience: American Opera Initiative’s Three 20-Minute Operas were performed in two evening showings on Friday, January 19 in the Kennedy Center’s Terrace Theater. Even though written and performed in English, subtitles are shown on two small screens on either side of the stage, which might be challenging viewing near the back of the seating area.\n\nThe performances were essentially sold out well ahead of the date. One suspects a significant fraction of the audience is made up of family and friends of the creative staff and performers involved, which makes it more fun, but WNO might consider adding performances, with a matinee on a separate day.\n\nNote: Normally composers and librettists apply individually for the AOI program and are subsequently paired. Preformed teams can apply but both the composer and librettist must be selected individually to remain a team. The review and awards process is managed by AOI Program Director Christopher Cano and AOI Artistic Director Kelley Rourke.\n\nParking in the Kennedy Center is typically plentiful at around $25 per day, with a small discount for Kennedy Center members when reserved ahead of the day. The Metro to Foggy Bottom and the free red Kennedy Center buses, from there to the Kennedy Center running every 15 minutes, are an excellent option. There is an advantage in getting there a bit early. KC frequently has multiple performances on its different stages overlapping that can create traffic jams.\n\nThere are snack stands in the main lobby, and on the Terrace level, the KC Café offers food cafeteria style at moderate prices; fine dining is available on the Terrace level in the Roof Terrace Restaurant. Food and drinks except water are not allowed inside the opera house, but you can purchase reusable capped containers with your drinks that you can take inside.\n\nFor me, Wagnerian opera was an acquired taste, but once acquired it became a passion, though with a bitter taste. Wagner was both a great composer and, from all reports, a seriously flawed human being. His forte was composing operas, not symphonic works; he has eleven operas that are still performed today. He completed only one symphony, which was not well received. His desire was to create what he called musical dramas as “gesamtkunstwerk”, a theater package that included all art forms as a maxed out dramatic experience, with music being an active participant in the dramas. He popularized the concept of using leitmotifs or short musical themes to identify with people, places, objects, or ideas. His music in many of his operas has been redrafted with success for presentation as orchestral works. Given that my first love is opera and that the NSO performances are always a treat, I could not pass this one up, especially given the chance to hear Wagner’s music performed by an orchestra the size and quality of the National Symphony Orchestra. My expectations were high.\n\nThis history behind this performance bears mentioning. In 1987, the recording company Telarc persuaded the late, great conductor Lorin Maazel to make a condensed orchestral version of music from Richard Wagner’s the Ring Cycle (Der Ring des Nibelungen or The Ring of the Nibelung), a work consisting of four separate operas –\n\nDas Rheingold (or The Rhinegold),\n\nDie Walküre or (Valkyrie),\n\nSiegfried,\n\nDas Götterdämmerung or (Twilight of the Gods) –\n\na grouping which lasts over 16 hours in total. The plot-line from Norse mythology that runs through all four opera concerns a golden ring that gives the possessor god like power over everyone… but with the condition that they give up love; overall, the Ring is an engrossing and compelling drama about the destructive influence of power when not guided by love. Telarc had a confining stipulation for Maazel: the work had to come in under 75 minutes to fit on a single compact disc. Maestro Maazel’s effort that he labeled the “Ring without Words” stitched together musical highlights from the four operas, presented in the same order as the operas; his program came in around 70 minutes. The “Ring without Words”, which began as a studio recording, has enjoyed popularity as a concert piece, still performed occasionally today. This distillation offers music fans the chance to sample Wagner’s music without committing to 16 hours required to hear the operas. It so happens that NSO’s Music Director and Conductor Gianandrea Noseda has recently conducted the entire Ring Cycle and will do so again in May 2024 for the Zurich Opera House, where he holds the position of General Music Director. Now, it also happens that there was another concert scheduled for NSO’s season in the January 11, 12, and 13 slot, but the solo performer to appear canceled this past November. This confluence of need and competence enabled NSO to quickly fill the void with a quality and timely replacement. I don’t know how season ticket holders took the news, but the KC Concert Hall was mostly packed on Thursday evening.\n\nLet me be clear: my issues were with the program, not the performance thereof; this is great music by a great composer, assembled by a great conductor, and it was played with verve and beauty by a great orchestra led by a great conductor. All the elements were in place for a fine performance. In the beginning, the music of the Rhine entered slowly and swirled, engulfing the audience; the orchestra pushed the ride of the Valkyries out over the audience. Further along a clanking sound of a hammer fashioning a sword drifted out. Siegfried and Brunnhilde began their love affair. Finally, Brunnhilde makes a sacrifice to cleanse and offer hope once more. That was happening in my mind’s eye which was conjuring images from the operas. Certainly, it was beautiful music, sometimes in a slow encompassing pace, moving slowly and now and then surging with raging crescendos, sometimes with a wall of shimmering sound (I love Wagner’s use of horns). Individual sections of the orchestra took turns with the lead and even a lovely cello solo was offered.\n\nSo, what’s your problem, dude? Well, I looked forward to the opportunity to focus on hearing this music sans the singing and story, but I could not. One of my favorite moments in opera is the beginning of Das Rheingold when the swirling music of the Rhine rises as in a wave and the Rhine maidens break into song - it’s thrilling, but they weren’t there that night and the water simply moved on empty and alone. I tried to adjust, but more and more the moments of beauty seemed lonely and disjointed. I can only wonder what someone unfamiliar with the Ring Cycle heard. Were they enticed to attend the entire Ring Cycle, or will they think that its music that had its moments but is not worth 16 hours and the expense required? Based on what I heard that evening, I would be delighted to attend Noseda’s performances of the complete cycle with the Zurich Opera in May, or better yet, how about doing it again in the Kennedy Center. Francesca Zambello’s 2016 Ring was outstanding; it’s time for another round!\n\nPerhaps for me the experience was like having one potato chip when there are four varieties on the table, but it goes deeper, maybe like hearing four movements from Mozart symphonies without pause, where each movement came from a different Mozart symphony. Music elicits feelings or at least it shades feelings, but in a personal way, speaking to us in a language we can only understand subconsciously. Great composers like Mozart could compose ensemble arias where different individuals singing at the same time to the same tune were expressing very different feelings. The great opera composers became adept at using music to assign meaning to stretches of music that works for their dramas, and when we hear it in the opera, the meaning given to us becomes imprinted on our consciousness. That music becomes associated in our minds with those characters or places or ideas. I cannot hear the theme from the TV show “Have Gun, Will Travel” without seeing in my mind’s eye Paladin dressed in black, or hear Lara’s Theme without seeing fields of wind caressed flowers in Russia or hear “Do you hear the People Sing” from “Les Misérables” without sensing the patriotic pride of liberty, equality, and fraternity. Think of what you experience when you hear the musical theme from the movie, “Jaws”. Wagner refined that ability to create short snippets of music that became associated with characters or places or ideas that helped him tell his stories. Classical music also has an underlying order, even though it is something I cannot articulate. That order is why I most often feel calmed by classical music. However, in opera the meaning of the music has been assigned. Perhaps when I heard Maazel’s suite of opera music from the Ring Cycle played as an orchestral piece, those meanings, the music and the opera-assigned ones, clashed at transition points, and it felt chaotic, even though musically the transitions were relatively smooth. Perhaps, seventy minutes of these changes was too much for me to enjoy at one time. Or perhaps, like Scrooge I can hope that the ghost visiting me that night was just an undigested piece of potato (in my case peanut butter crackers).\n\nFinally, the performance by the National Symphony Orchestra led by Conductor Noseda was as strong as I anticipated, no problem there, but for whatever reason, the Ring without Words program did not work for me that night. For me, Maestro Maazel’s Ring suite of seventy minutes, at best, only made me long for the sweet sixteen hours of Wagner’s. Maybe for the Ring Cycle, I need the gesamtkunstwerk; I hope Ms. Zambello is listening.\n\nThe Fan Experience: Performances of “Ring without Words” were scheduled for January 11, 12, and 13 in the Concert Hall at the Kennedy Center. The work is intended to be performed continuously without interruption, though in Thursday’s performance, enthusiastic fans could not resist interrupting the performance a couple of times with applause.\n\nParking in the Kennedy Center is typically plentiful at around $25 per day, with a small discount for Kennedy Center members when reserved ahead of the day. The Metro to Foggy Bottom and the free red Kennedy Center buses, from there to the Kennedy Center running every 15 minutes, are an excellent option. There is an advantage in getting there a bit early. KC frequently has multiple performances on its different stages overlapping that can create traffic jams, even unexpected ones inside the Center. Thursday, the middle section of the Grand Foyer in front of the Opera House was squadroned off and only attendees for “Frozen” could enter that area, and they had to pass through metal detectors to enter.\n\nThere are snack stands in the main lobby, and on the Terrace level, the KC Café offers food cafeteria style at moderate prices; fine dining is available on the Terrace level in the Roof Terrace Restaurant. Food and drinks except water are not allowed inside the opera house, but you can purchase reusable containers with your drinks that you can take inside.\n\nHansel and Gretel’s popularity is not only due to its appeal as a fairy tale opera for children; it also offers a melodic, musically sophisticated score. Composer Humperdinck became friends with Richard Wagner and assisted him in a production of Parsifal at Bayreuth. Musicologists state that the music offers a Wagnerian range of colors and textures, with endless polyphonic variations on the folk melodies; they have even questioned whether the music is too rich just for a simple fairy tale opera. The piano accompaniment for this performance was supplied by SOT’s Associate Director and Conductor Dr. Lisa Bloy. The melodies and themes translated well for a production of Hansel and Gretel in a smaller venue. Ms. Bloy’s playing might have been more nuanced but her timing with the singers was impeccable. Time and again I marveled at how well they performed together.\n\nThe small performance hall for Hansel and Gretel had simple attractive, thematic sets: a cottage set, a forest set, and a candy house set for the different scenes; amusingly, Ms. Lind told the audience that we must ignore the sets not in use for the current scene; it was not a problem. The Bavarian styled costumes were a delight, though Gertrud’s lavish red gown, while lovely, was more fitting for a queen than an impoverished broom maker’s wife. This version of the opera was modified for the final scene where, in other versions, the children previously consumed by The Witch appear and are brought back to life. My difficulty deciphering sung text, even when sung in English, left me unclear whether that aspect had been addressed; my wife, who had not seen the opera before, thought the ending worked as presented. Regardless, it was a happy ending for all, even The Witch, and the audience was treated to a closing chorus by the ensemble.\n\nHansel and Gretel is based on a fairy tale that can be presented in many ways. The SOT presentation is mild in terms of scariness, played more for comedic effect. Still, children become lost (happiness endangered); children are threatened (innocence lost), and children save themselves (with a little divine intervention) and eventually are reunited with their grateful parents (oh, joy). All that coupled with great singing and music works for me, at Christmas or anytime.\n\nThe Fan Experience: Shakespeare Opera Theatre scheduled Hansel and Gretel performances for December 9 (matinee and evening) and 10 (matinee) at St. Thomas Episcopal Church, Mclean, and on December 16 (matinee and evening) at Grace Episcopal Church in The Plains, Virginia. The opera is sung in English without subtitles. SOT’s next production will be Verdi’s Macbeth in July.\n\nSOT’s performance had more of a party atmosphere rather than the church service atmosphere of our major opera halls. I found little pretense with SOT; they readily own their limitations and still managed to engage us fully. Dress is “as you like it” and seating is at tables. Thematic snacks and non-alcoholic drinks are offered for sale (I had the endless hot chocolate) which can be consumed before, during, or after performances. Children were not only encouraged to attend but Ms. Lind, in her opening remarks, stated not to worry if your children began to act like children, let them be children, and if any adults wanted to play with the toys and coloring books at the back, feel free. Autumn Grimes is SOT’s children’s helper and keeps the children engaged.\n\nI will close with a personal anecdote and just a wee bit of pontificating. The college I attended required attendance at church your first year. I fell in love with the choir which featured an outstanding soprano soloist. The second year I kept attending regularly, in all honesty, primarily to hear the choir. This was not the Mormon Tabernacle Choir, but this local choir provided some of my most cherished musical experiences, further enhanced by being part of a community. I worry that opera has lost much of its direct connection with people and the community contact has become too impersonal, especially as younger generations move increasingly online. Shakespeare Opera Theatre offers an old-time approach in a modern setting using professional quality singers. You might find it rewarding, and if you’d also like to rekindle that old flame of community connection, maybe bring a friend."
