        "text": "Phenomenology and Technology\n\nDecades later, building on Edmund Husserl, Martin Heidegger, in both Sein un Zeit (Being and Time) and \"The Question Concerning Technology,\" examined the emergent technological world of the mid-twentieth century. 6 For him, \"technology is a way of revealing\" because it is \"that which belongs to technē,\" which consists of the skills and practices of a craftsman—i.e. the work of hands—along with \"the arts of the mind and the fine arts. Thus, technē belongs to bringing-forth, to poiēsis; it is something poietic\" (Heidegger, 1977, p. 13). Written language is perhaps the most basic form of technology:\n\nWriting is a 'machine' to supplement both the fallible and limited nature of our memory (it stores information over time) and our bodies over space (it carries information over distances). So it's not so much that we humans made technology: technology also made us. As we write, so writing makes us. It is technology that allows us history, as a recorded past and so a present, and so, perhaps a future. So to think about technology, and changes in technology, is to think about the very core of what we, as a species, are and about how we are changing. As we change technology, we change ourselves (Eaglestone, 2013, p. 87).\n\nTechnology is thus not an invention that exists in isolation from its creators, but in a broader context of social currents, intellectual movements and cultural products. Mark Schubin has shown such bi-directional influence in his study of the relationship between technology and opera. 7\n\nTable 1.

Thus, written music represents not only a composer's creativity (bringing into existence something which has not existed in the form designated by an author), but also the result of a technological practice that encodes ideas in a transmissible form. Musicologists have largely accepted that scores are not the sole representative of a musical work, recognizing that writing music conceals the actual musical entity. Cook (2013) echoes this view, characterizing the actions of performers (reading a score and acting upon it) and listeners (engaging the aural results of performers' actions) as a \"slippage between two senses of 'expression'\" along a communicative chain from composer to listener (p. 31). The communicative chain, which Cook identifies as a longstanding characteristic of music in scholarly discourse, is necessary because whatever the composer has conceived remains hidden from others until its inscription for preservation or sharing. Even Rudolph Kolisch's assertion that \"the entire need for performance disappears if one can read music\", perhaps unintentionally, admits that musical notation conceals the thoughts of the composer (Cook, 2013, p. 8). This concealment occurs because, as philosopher Jacques Derrida's stipulated, \"Writing reduces the dimensions of presence in its sign\" (Derrida, 1974, p. 281). A musical score, as a written entity, reduces the ways in which one can encounter the presence of the musical work by forcing the encounter into the visual realm, thereby restricting engagement by other senses. The score enables the sounds of a musical entity (what Heidegger characterizes as that which presences) to come into (aural) appearance repeatedly, but is not itself the musical entity. 9\n\nJacques Derrida further expounds on this point, considering \"the epoch of logocentrism\" as \"a moment of the global effacement of the signifier [the written word]\" (Derrida, 1974, pp. 285-6). This effacement creates a mode of thinking in which \"one then believes one is protecting and exalting speech [by adherence to the written text], [but] one is only fascinated by a figure of the technē\" (Derrida, 1974, p. 286, emphasis added). Such fascination stems from Derrida's steadfast belief in Jean-Jacques Rousseau's assertion of two hundred years earlier: \"Writing is nothing but the representation of speech; it is bizarre that one gives more care to the determining of the image than to the object\" (Derrida, 1974, p. 27). In other words, written representations are not and cannot be the ideas that they represent. Similarly, speaking produces auditory phenomena representing the idea, rather than the idea itself, and is also a form of technē. Hermeneutic philosopher Hans Georg Gadamer reasserted a performance's status, arguing that the written component of an aesthetic entity lies in its ability to connect the past and present. 10\n\nGadamer's stipulation about written works also applies to musical practice. It implies that there is no inherent codependency or inherent important differentiation possible between a written score and the sounded notes: \"The fact that aesthetic being depends on being presented, then, does not imply some sort of deficiency, some lack of autonomous meaning. Rather, it [aesthetic being] belongs to its very essence. The spectator is an essential element in [what] we call aesthetic\" (Gadamer, 2014, p. 130). Gadamer goes so far as to claim that it is in performance, and not in the written score, that one encounters the musical work:\n\nThe performance of a play, like that of a ritual, cannot simply be detached from the play itself, as if it were something that is not part of its essential being, but is as subjective and fluid as the aesthetic experiences in which it is experienced. Rather, it is in the performance and only in it – as we see most clearly in the case of music – that we encounter the work itself…A drama only really exists when it is played, and ultimately, music must resound (Gadamer, 2014, p. 120).\n\nThis idea suggests that what is more important is the action of bringing a work into being, what I term \"opsicentrism,\" rather than the text of a work itself, unlike \"logocentrism,\" which preferences the written word as the primary embodiment of a musical work. 11 Sounded music, which implies the labor of producing the sound, rather than any other sensorial mode of it—written, imagined, physically felt—is thus the singular mode by which anyone can come closest to encountering the musical work itself. Nevertheless, strict adherence to Gadamer's constructs of opsicentrism and logocentrism produces an ultimately untenable binary, especially for texted music. Musical works consist then, at minimum, in their sounded phenomena, sung text (if present), and written score.\n\nOf course, the challenge with music is its evanescent temporality—its sounded and intangible existence ceases almost as soon as it comes into being. The ephemerality of a performed music entity requires something to continue to allow its ongoing realization. Each realization (performance) of a musical work is the revealing that brings it forth: poiēsis (Heidegger, 1977, p. 29). Gadamer (2014) asserts that \"[A work's] own original essence is always to be something different (even when [performed] in exactly the same way). It has its being only in becoming and return\" (p. 126). Clarke (2012) reminds his readers that \"Novelty and uniqueness…are central to that powerful and Romantic notion of creativity which still dominates our culture\" (p. 20). This reminder follows his description of pianists playing the same work, either in comparison with each other or against themselves individually. In other words, according to Nicholas Cook (2013), \"Music's communicative potential—its ability to enact openness to the other—…is built into practically all musical performance and listening\" (p. 412).\n\nMusical works, which, by their nature intersect again and again with audiences only in their coming into being or presencing (Anwesen) via the performers bringing-forth (Her-vor-bringen), are convincing testaments to humans' inability for exact mechanical reproduction (Heidegger, 1977, pp. 10-1). 12 Gadamer (2014) expands on music's Her-vor-bringen as evidenced in its occasionality: \"The work of art…experiences a continued determination of its meaning from the 'occasion' of its coming-to-presentation. This is seen most clearly in the performing arts, especially theater and music, which wait for the occasion in order to exist and define themselves…\" (p. 147). Acknowledging the viability of opsicentrism becomes an integral step in coming closer to encountering the musical work.\n\nRather than blindly accepting either logocentrism or opsicentrism and abandoning the other, however, I suggest a reinvestment in Heideggerian ideals for musical performance. Neither the score nor the performance contains the entire Wesen of the musical entity; thus, neither one constitutes that entity completely. Instead, both point to it, and the aesthetic being that is music is perhaps like a performance of music itself: intangible. Because the score endures, and is therefore (only) one embodiment of the Heideggerian Gestell of music, the score is the essencing of technology, the technē of the musical work. Gadamer's conception of every performance's uniqueness in relationship to the nature of a work reveals a prescient awareness of any performance history's inherent dynamism. For him, what is \"essential to dramatic or musical works, then, is that their performance at different times and on different occasions is, and must be, different…specifically occasional art forms determine [themselves] anew from occasion to occasion\" (Gadamer, 2014, pp. 147-8). Both a musical score and its realization belong to technē because they each point to the revealing of the musical work, which is poietic. Those who endeavor in either practice—i.e. in the pursuit of revealing by composition or performance—both exhibit and affirm how tangible practices link to intangible concepts. Heidegger (1977) reminds his audience that:\n\nHere was a time when it was not technology alone that bore the name technē. Once that revealing that brings forth truth into the splendor of radiant appearing also was called technē. Once there was a time when the bringing-forth of the true into the beautiful was called technē. And the poiēsis of the fine arts was also called technē (p. 34).\n\nMethodological Considerations\n\nThe present analysis further adapts the hierarchical Time Scape technique of tempo tracking, developed by CHARM, as the tool for operatic analysis. By incorporating textual underlays with Time Scapes, this method facilitates understanding of temporal-textual emphasis and aspects/elements of performers' creative processes. How singers deliver the text in the context of the musical structure provides valuable insight into the kind of character they portray. While Daniel Leech-Wilkinson (2007) has also analyzed singers' expressivity in relation to sung text of Schubert's lied \"Die jenge Nonne\", his approach focused on individual moments or phrases and durations of the entire song without extended consideration of connections between them. Scape plotting is useful for capturing both surface-level details and the overall hierarchical structure simultaneously while also enabling examination of the connections that Leech-Wilkinson's foundational work did not cover.\n\nTo create the scape plots, beat tapping and tempo calculation (to the following beat) using Sonic Visualiser provided the basic data for use in this study. For Giordani's performance, the process was to extract the digital audio from the commercially available DVD, then enter and adjust beat markers with onset detection. For Gruber's performance, which is not commercially available, data generation followed a process I designed to accommodate legal restrictions on archival material: 1) annotation of a score while listening, 2) tapping beats on a second listening, 3) comparing tap track and recording on a third listening while making further annotations for subsequent listening, 4) listening and tapping with new information, 5) repeating steps 3-4 until creation of a tap track reflecting beat placement, and 6) upload file into Sonic Visualiser for placement, onset detection, and tempo calculation (Neumann, 2016b, p. 50). I then used his tempo data in CHARM's web-based Scape Plot Generator tool to create the Time Scapes in this study (http://www.mazurka.org.uk/software/online/scape/).\n\nSince Time Scapes form the basis of the following analysis, an overview of reading them with the overlay in use here is necessary. Four elements nuance the understanding of these Time Scapes. First, color coding reflects basic relationships to the overall average, or global, tempo of a performance; yellow, orange, and red are progressively faster than average (green), while blue indigo and violet are progressively slower. Second, a structural overlay indicates approximate divisions of surface (beat-to-beat tempo relationships), mid-ground (phrasal connections) and background (global tempo). Third, a tempo contour graph and linear trend line respectively indicate precise tempo values of the surface level and reflect the overall pacing tendencies within the performance, while the final and perhaps most critical element, the textual underlay, reveals a performance's unique temporal-textual emphases.\n\nStructural analysis of the tempo hierarchy in relationship to the text is necessary for understanding the temporal-textual emphases hierarchy and its possible ramifications for dramatic interpretation. Examination of the surface level—the bottom third of each Time Scape—reveals how singers' deviations from the global tempo have the effect of accentuating or understating different elements of the text. A performance's temporal-textual emphases can align with a score's indications or result from performer decisions alone. On their own, each surface-level emphasis highlights individual words or phrases. For example, if one spends more time delivering the word \"amore\" than the word \"colore,\" then the word \"amore\" receives a greater temporal-textual emphasis, suggesting the speaker's designation that it is the more important word. Surface level deviations from the global tempo have the same effect, whether the cause of the performed effect is based in notation or in aural phenomena. On their own, each of these surface-level emphases highlights individual words, but when their emphasis crosses another one in a higher (or deeper) structural level, a structural crossing links the two words.\n\nThe middle third of each Time Scape reflects the structural mid-ground of a performance, and in this space temporally-based connections between non-neighboring parts of the text can emerge. Such links are evident when extensions of homogenous color from surface level events intersect in a deeper structural level. Not only do these structural crossings further substantiate each performance's uniqueness, but, moreover, their respective hierarchical levels reflect a hierarchy of textual connections. For example, the emphases added in the following line changes what it communicates as most important to a reader; \"The blue cow jumped over the purple moon\" stresses the unorthodox coloring of the sentence's modified subject and object on the surface, but in a deeper level, it connects these two components, so perhaps the sentence is about imaginative color schemes. Alternatively, \"The blue cow jumped over the purple moon\" stresses the cow jumping, already a rare occurrence, but by connecting this temporal emphasis to the moon's color, perhaps the reason for the cow's odd behavior is that purple evokes such a strong reaction.\n\nUnderstandably, this hierarchical structure depends largely on the imposed ordering of text and music by composers and librettists—here Puccini, Giuseppe Adami and Renato Simoni. As previous research has established (at CHARM and elsewhere), however, performer decisions contribute greatly to variations in hierarchical tempo structures. While it may be possible to discern such connections in listening alone, they generally become more difficult to discern as one moves higher in the structure, and the longer the passage of music to which one listens. The top third of each Time Scape is predominantly green, unless there are connections between parts of the text at the beginning and end of an excerpt, or a moment-specific tempo modification strong enough to occupy an organizational space in the hierarchy. As these extensions cross at higher levels of a performance's tempo hierarchy, their importance in the overall structure for what they link increases.\n\nMost tempo modulations in the present study are ritardandos, resulting from notated and non-notated fermatas, tenutos, and other note-specific articulation marks. Combined with Puccini's well-documented obsession with tempo and pacing, these distinct modulations in relationship to text delivery form the rationale for hierarchical analysis of textual connections based on temporal emphasis. This performance and performer centric view is not to give preference to these aspects over a score, libretto, staging, etc., but only to focus on their part of the aforementioned dialogic relationship in the continual creation of operatic works. In the following graphs—the central components of the analysis here undertaken—the temporal-textual emphases result largely from the varying applications of tempo rubato, and also from Puccini's notated metric and beat structure.\n\nEach case study presented here followed the same analytical protocol: 1) analysis of temporal-textual emphases with the preceding method, which enabled the 2) formation of a hypothesis about its performer's interpretation, 3) interview with each singer to apprehend their unique understanding of and motivations for their characters in the musical moments this project analyzed, 4) share hypothesis/conclusion drawn from Time Scape and temporal-textual emphasis analyses, and 5) confirm veracity of empirical findings against performer characterization. In each case, my hypothesis matched how Gruber and Giordani described their respective interpretations. 16 Confirming such hypotheses via interview, as in the present study, or other secondary sources makes this approach useful for interrogating performers' creative processes both within a performance and across performances in the context of the performance history of an operatic work.\n\nAndréa Gruber: Turandot as Charade, 29 January 2005\n\nTurandot's entrance aria, 'In questa Reggia' and the ensuing riddle scene form the crux of both her character and the opera's dramatic arc. In this aria, Turandot explains her riddles and the ostensibly severe consequence of failing to answer them – her desire for vengeance on behalf of her ancestress Lou-o-Ling, as Table 2 illustrates. 17 Taken at her word, Turandot is bloodthirsty, vengeful, and cruel. According to Andréa Gruber (2015), both Birgit Nilsson's icy, steely timbre and dominance of the role on the stage throughout the 1960s solidified these traits as Turandot's true nature in the imagination of audiences. 18\n\nThe Time Scape in Figure 1 represents Andréa Gruber's performance as Turandot on 29 January 2005. Here, tempo modifications reflect the musical structure of the aria: twenty bars of 2/4 marked molto lento with 46 quarter notes per minute and covering beats 1-41, sixty-eight bars of 4/8 interspersed with three bars of 2/8, with indications of lento and 66 eighth notes per minute for beats 41-111, and finally twenty-two bars of 4/4 marked largamente with 56 quarter notes per minute over beats 113-199. In this analysis, the 2/8 and 4/8 measures were analyzed based on quarter note equivalency in order to accommodate limitations of accounting for meter shifts in audio files in Sonic Visualiser.\n\nMuch of the tempo hierarchy in Gruber's performance is similar to the other eighteen performances of this aria at the Metropolitan Opera between 1960 and 2009. 19 Unlike for Birgit Nilsson in 1961 (top left in Figure 1) or Maria Guleghina in 2009 (middle left in Figure 1), the higher-level structure of Gruber's large-scale slower-than-global-tempo section (b. 41-113) does not extend to the left edge of the graph in a significant manner. This feature is the result of Gruber's comparatively quicker tempi through the aria's introductory text (b. 1-41) in relationship to her performance's global tempo, as the lack of surface-level green in this section indicates. The leftward extensions touching the edge of Nilsson's and Guleghina's Time Scapes result from beats 111-113––where their onstage Turandots each emphasize Lo-u-Ling's scream and death. These emphases project a greater importance in communicating Lo-u-Ling's victimhood, perhaps suggesting a motivation substantially predicated upon vengeance. The absence of this extension for Gruber's performance insinuates that retribution is not an all-consuming impetus for her Turandot's riddles (which take place in the ensuing scene). Analysis of all recorded performances of 'In questa Reggia' at the Met reveals that the extension in question is also present at the left edge of the time scapes for Birgit Nilsson's performances in 1962, 1966, 1970, as well as for Marion Lippert (1969), Ingrid Bjoner (1974), Elinor Ross (1974), Eva Marton (March and April 1987), Ghena Dimitrova (1988, 1996), Gwyneth Jones (1990, 1992, 1995), and Adrienne Duggar (2003). This subtle difference in structural features unique to Gruber's performances results in a dramatically distinct narrative alteration from other Turandots at the Met.\n\nTable 2. Text and Translation of 'In questa Reggia' Turandot\n\nIn questa reggia, or son mill'anni e mille,\n\nun grido disperato risonò.\n\nE quel grido, traverso stirpe e\n\nstirpe\n\nqui nell'anima mia si rifugiò!\n\nPrincipessa Lou-Ling,\n\nava dolce e serena che regnavi\n\nnel tuo cupo silenzio in gioia pura,\n\ne sfidasti inflessibile e sicura\n\nl'aspro dominio, oggi rivivi in me!

Il regno vinto!\n\nE Lou-Ling, la mia ava, trascinata\n\nda un uomo come te, come te straniero,\n\nlà nella notte atroce\n\ndove si spense la sua fresca voce! Turandot (like something remote)\n\nStill, in the time that everyone remembers,\n\nThere was alarm, and terror in the rumble of\n\narms!\n\nThe kingdom defeated!

Turandot\n\nO Princes who in long caravans\n\nFrom every part of the world\n\nCome here to try your fate,\n\nI avenge upon you, upon you that purity,\n\nThat cry and that death!\n\nThat cry and that death!\n\nNo one will ever possess me!

Turandot\n\nNo, no!\n\n[The riddles are three, the death is one! Il Principe Ignoto\n\nGli enigmi sono tre, una è la vita!] The Unknown Prince\n\nThe riddles are three, one the life!]\n\nThe most striking higher-level features in this performance's tempo hierarchy are the structural crossings resulting from the extension of Turandot naming Lo-u-Ling intersecting two others, both involving Calaf. The first crossing for the \"Lo-u-Ling\" extension emanates from the prince's first interjection in this aria, 'No! No! Gli enigmi sono tre, una è la vita!' (b. 173-180). The second extension originates at Calaf's and Turandot's dual ascent wherein they challenge each other (b. 181-188). These are the highest significant structural crossings in this tempo hierarchy, and the tempo-textual emphasis they highlight points to the crux of Gruber's interpretation of this role. \"She thinks she is Lo-u-Ling, but this is an effect of her being only thirteen, just becoming sexually aware, and really pissed off at her father for trying to control her and marry her off. I think he is the one who makes her do the riddles. So, the anger is there, but it's not some sense of real and righteous anger over Lo-u-Ling\" (Gruber, 2015).\n\nThe libretto indicates that Turandot seeks revenge on all men for the travesty inflicted on Lo-u-Ling, but the surface meaning of the text does not reflect the complexity necessary for Gruber's preferred characterization. In her view, Turandot is a coming-of-age thirteen-year-old who is a pawn in her father's game of suitors, riddles, and beheadings. Believing Lo-u-Ling is reborn in her or that she is Lo-u-Ling provides a two-fold escape for Turandot—one from her father's domination of her will and actions (which explains part of Turandot's identifying with her ancestress), and the other from her burgeoning sexuality, which she has no way to control. Also for Gruber, Turandot knows from the moment she sees Calaf that he is different from all previous suitors, who Gruber imagines as motivated by the allure of the power coming from a royal marriage and the prospect of satiating their respective sexual appetites. Gruber (2015) highlights this recognition about Calaf as the precipitating factor in Turandot's Act III tearful confession, wherein the character exclaims: \"My first tears, yes stranger. When you arrived, I felt with anguish the fateful thrill of destiny, but I trembled for you! There was in your eyes the light of heroes!\". 20\n\nUnder these circumstances, the links extending from Calaf's outbursts indicate his awareness of Turandot's situation and his confidence that he will free her from her present bondage. Singers who approach Calaf in this way are the most dramatically convincing for Gruber (2015), while those following a more stereotypical solely selfishly motivated archetype for Calaf present interesting challenges in onstage chemistry: \"Calaf as only a sexual conqueror limits how Turandot (and I as Turandot) can interact with him from this aria onward in the opera. The riddles can be so many things: seductive, angry, cat and mouse, among others\" (Gruber, 2015). Because Gruber looks to Act III's tearful admission as the fundamental dynamic between Calaf and Turandot, she cannot conceive of \"In questa Reggia\" as an angst-ridden cry for help to Calaf, whose very \"ascent to the gong at the end of Act I and ascent to answer the riddles in Act II leaves [Turandot] shaking\" (Gruber, 2015). In the aria's climactic parallel octaves with simultaneous and contradictory texts about three riddles equaling one death or one life, Calaf senses Turandot's trepidation (which she masks with her death threats) about a life different from the one she knows. Gruber (2015) summarizes this moment: \"Calaf knows he can break the spell of Turandot's release-by-obsession by outsmarting her father and arousing her erotic love.\" Such a detail emerging in the tempo hierarchy and temporal-textual emphasis of Gruber's performance demonstrates, as it does also with Marcello Giordani's performances, both a spectrum of nuances in musical and dramatic practice that range from minute to profound, and the applicability of this methodology to better understanding the creative process. Being able to connect singers' dramatic interpretations to their onstage musical behaviors in this manner represents perhaps the most significant contribution to this vein of inquiry.\n\nMarcello Giordani: Breaking Stereotypes of Calaf, 7 November 2009\n\n'NON PIANGERE, LIÙ!'\n\n'Non piangere, Liù!' is Calaf's response to Liù's expressed concern ('Signore, ascolta!') over his stated intent to answer Turandot's riddles. The aria's text bears a wide array of dramatic interpretations. On one hand, it can be a tender response to Liù's worry; alternatively, it seeks only to provide continued care for Timur (Calaf's father) in the event of Calaf's death, thereby using Liù to assure such an outcome. The social classes of Calaf (the exiled Prince of Tartary) and Liù (a slave in the royal household), the gender roles and social places of men and women as Puccini was writing Turandot, and Puccini's problematic relationships with women provide a strong, yet unsavory to modern tastes, archetype. Herein, the prince's order of concerns might be: 1) add Turandot to his list of conquests, 2) ensure ongoing caregiving for Timur, and maybe 3) console Liù in her moment of distress. Other interpretations of the plot development likely include some mixture of the foregoing priorities; like with Gruber's uniqueness in \"In questa Reggia,\" most performances at the Metropolitan Opera for 1961 – 2009 exhibit less focus on Liù via temporal-textual emphasis, with Marcello Giordani a notable exception. 21\n\nFigure 2 offers a view of the temporal hierarchy and temporal-textual emphases in Giordani's interpretation on 07 November 2009. On the surface, Giordani delivers the opening words and 'dolce mia fanciulla' (emphasis added) slower than the global tempo (beats 4-9, 19-21, respectively). He provides Calaf's explanation that Timur may be alone in the world at dawn at a mildly-to-moderately quicker than average tempo before slowing significantly to exhort Liù to 'portalo via con te' (beats 41-4). Giordani's Calaf urges Liù to focus, following her interjection, with a significant slowing at 'questo, questo' (beats 61-5). The greatest temporal emphasis in Giordani's performance builds on this moment, as Calaf re-addresses and re-characterizes the slave girl as 'mia povera Liù' with the 'piccolo cuore,' which is perhaps unsurprising, as Puccini's markings include an espressivo (beats 66-72). Giordani's subsequent stringendo reminds Liù that her heart does not falter and asks her to plead for Timur (beats 72-84). Following this surge towards the melodic climax, Giordani's Calaf places Liù's attention on Timur, and emphasizes the need to do so through his observation of the fermata Puccini placed at the repetition of 'che non sorride più' (beat 85).\n\nTable 3. Text and Translation of 'Non piangere, Liù!' Il Principe Ignoto (avvicinandosele, con commozione)\n\nNon piangere, Liù!\n\nse in un lontano giorno\n\nio t'ho sorriso\n\nper quel sorriso, dolce mia fanciulla\n\nm'ascolta: il tuo Signore\n\nsarà, domani, forse, solo al mondo\n\nNon lo lasciare, portalo via con te! The Unknown Prince (approaching her, with emotion)\n\nDon't cry, Liù!\n\nIf on one far-off day\n\nI smiled at you,\n\nFor that smile, my sweet girl,\n\nListen to me: your Lord\n\nwill be, tomorrow, perhaps alone in the world…\n\nDo not leave him, take him away with you! Liù\n\nNoi morrem sulla strada dell'esilio! Liù\n\nWe'll die on the road of exile! Timur\n\nNoi morrem! Timur\n\nWe'll die! Il Principe Ignoto\n\nDell'esilio addolcisci a lui le strade\n\nQuesto…questo, o mia povera Liù,\n\nal tuo piccolo cuore che non cade\n\nchiede colui che non sorride più…\n\nChe non sorride più! The Unknown Prince\n\nMake gentle the roads of exile for him\n\nThis…this…Oh, my poor Liù,\n\nOf your little heart that doesn't fail\n\nHe asks who smiles no more…\n\nWho smiles no more!\n\nSeveral features of the tempo hierarchy in this performance are noteworthy. First, and most striking, are the heights to which extensions from the most significant stringendo and ritardando extend. More interestingly, they do not actually cross, offering only a projected or implied intersection almost in the middle of the triangle, as the lines in Figure 2 indicate. That they do not cross establishes the temporally and structurally significant independence of two specific points as the primary components of this performance's identity. The first results from Giordani's pushing the tempo through his initial explanation to Liù (which is his concern for Timur) and the second from his slowing at Calaf's re-focusing on Liù's identity. If either extension was absent, then the remaining temporal feature would dominate the hierarchy of Giordani's performance, along with its text. Moreover, Giordani's temporal link of 'Non piangere, Liù' (beats 4-6) and 'dolce mia fanciulla' (beats 19-21) highlights both his characterization of Liù and Calaf's concern for her and Timur. 22 Citing his perception of Calaf's understanding of the need to care for father and slave, Giordani indicated that his interpretation in this moment generally tends to be Calaf's focus on everyone as individuals, \"like God,\" and that this universal concern offers at least a shadow of connection amongst the characters 23: \"He looks out for everyone, because Turandot's cruelty upsets him, because he knows suffering and exile\" (Giordani, 2013).\n\nFurthermore, the blue and indigo shading along the right edge of the graph are increasingly higher structural projections from 'O mia povera Liù' (triangle, emanating from beats 66-71), Liù's 'sulla strada dell'esilio' (rectangle, emanating from beats 50-52), and 'portalo via con te' (square, emanating from beats 40-43), respectively. These extensions all cross with the subtle upward projection from the fermata emphasizing Timur's inability to smile anymore (beat 85). That the highest structural significance comes from the crossing with 'portalo via con te' suggests that one possible underlying or subconscious focus in Giordani's performance was a greater concern for Timur than for Liù, which would correspond to his royal station in society. At the very least, in concluding Act I on this occasion, Giordani's Calaf showed concern for the well-being of everyone surrounding him in ancient Peking, and, convinced by a glimpse of Turandot in her legendary beauty, that the means to creating a healthier society is to help the Princess understand that she can give in to love and preserve her identity.\n\n'NESSUN DORMA'\n\n'Nessun dorma!' is perhaps Puccini's best-known tenor aria, owing both to its iconic musical features, and to its crossover success. Its text is ostensibly one of the more selfish expressions in Turandot, if not the entirety of Puccini's output. One way to read it is that Calaf cares nothing for anything but himself, daring not just Turandot, but the very setting in which, and objects (stars) to which, he offers his soliloquy. Such a reading is not out of place considering the cultural sphere from which this work emerged – one in which women had limited agency. Giordani's version however, is a unique re-imagining of a Puccinian tenor archetype.\n\nTable 4. Text and Translation of 'Nessun dorma!' Il Principe Ignoto\n\nNessun dorma! Nessun dorma…!\n\nTu pure, o Principessa,\n\nnella tua fredda stanza,\n\nguardi le stelle\n\nche tremano d'amore e di speranza!\n\nMa il mio mistero è chiuso in me,\n\nil nome mio nessun saprà!\n\nNo, no, sulla tua bocca lo dirò\n\nquando la luce splenderà!\n\nEd il mio bacio scioglierà il silenzio\n\nche ti fa mia…! The Unknown Prince\n\nLet no one sleep! Let no one sleep!\n\nYou too, O Princess,\n\nIn your cold room,\n\nare looking at the stars\n\nThat tremble with love and with hope!\n\nBut my mystery is locked in me,\n\nNo one will know my name!\n\nNo, no, upon your mouth I'll say it\n\nwhen the light shines.\n\nAnd my kiss will break the silence\n\nthat makes you mine…! Voci di Donne (misteriose e lontane)\n\nIl nome suo nessun saprà!…\n\ne noi dovrem, ahime, morir! Women's Voices (mysterious and remote)\n\nNo one shall know his name!\n\nAnd we must, alas, die! Il Principe Ignoto\n\nDilegua, o notte…! Tramontate, stelle!\n\nTramontate, stelle!\n\nAll'alba vincerò! Vincerò! Vincerò! The Unknown Prince\n\nDissolve, o night…! Set, stars!\n\nSet, stars!\n\nAt dawn I'll win! I'll win! I'll win!\n\nBy the time Act III arrives, Giordani's Calaf has patiently listened to Turandot's defense of her hatred of man, successfully answered each of her three riddles, asserted that he does not want her against her will, but instead aflame with love, and even offered an 'out' to Turandot: discover his name by dawn and he will surrender his life. Unlike stereotypes for fin de siècle tenors as being only sexually supercharged on their most innocuous days or otherwise being outright sexual predators, Giordani's Calaf appears to be a genuinely decent human being by modern standards. Analysis of the temporal-textual emphases in his performance of \"Nessun dorma!\" supports such a characterization.\n\nFigure 3 is the Time Scape for Marcello Giordani's performance of 'Nessun dorma!'. In it, various nested links of text are clear. First, the extension from the slowing throughout the initial address to the Princess (the line emanating from beat 18), which is very similar to Franco Corelli's 1961 version under Leopold Stokowski's baton, forms a link with the extension resulting from the slowing at the first syllable of 'splenderà!' (the line emanating up and left from beat 62). 24 This latter extension also forms an implied link with the stringendo Giordani and Nelsons employed between the first and second phrase of Turandot's most famous motive (beats 43-48), which temporally de-emphasizes Calaf's secret, and by extension, his power over Turandot and interest in making her a conquest. There is also a link between the ritardando on 'splenderà!' (line emanating up and right from beat 62), the ritardandos of Calaf's proclamation that Turandot's silence will make her his ('che ti fa mia!' beat 78-82), and the chorus's interjection about their anticipated collective fate (beat 83 – 96), highlighted by the larger oval in Figure 3. Extensions from each of these moments form links of varying intensities with the first and third of the threefold climactic iterations of \"Vincerò!\" (squares at beats 106-9 and 120).\n\nThe highest structural crossings between Calaf's opening lines and 'vincerò!' are common among performances of 'Nessun dorma!' at the Metropolitan Opera, implying that the overarching textual and dramatic point of this aria is to show, at the very least, Calaf's confidence, however individual performers choose to nuance it. Giordani's inclusion of the crowd's voice in the temporal hierarchy, however, is unique to his performance, and reinforces the conclusions drawn about his Calaf in the foregoing analysis of 'Non piangere, Liù.\" Had Giordani's temporal-textual emphases not drawn the crowd into the performance's hierarchy, his character's view of the situation would appear less sympathetic to them, and suggest a more insistent and ardently-focused motivation.\n\nThe distinct nesting of temporal-textual emphases in Giordani's performance suggests that these moments, if considered in increasing hierarchical order, share a commonality of effect. 25 The commonality of their effect—that Calaf will win Turandot's heart and hand in marriage—suggests the possibility of a commonality of motivation. In other words, Giordani's performance evokes a structure in which Calaf addresses everyone's concerns through his love for all, thereby embodying Giordani's interpretation of Calaf's state of being at the aria's point in the opera's dramatic arc. For him, \"He loves everyone, because at this point, he is love\" (2013). 26 Love in its truest, self-sacrificial sense is the motivation Giordani attempts to project in his performances as Calaf. This is also what makes Liù's death more moving for him as a singer, both as an actor preparing to portray a character, and then acting as that character. In Giordani's view, this also makes Liù's death a genuine turning point for Turandot, as the princess sees someone die for no personal benefit (2013). Giordani's frequent characterizations of his view of Calaf's embodiment of love as \"like God's,\" challenges longstanding assertions the tenor at this point is a sexually motivated, autobiographical projection of Puccini's younger self. 27"
