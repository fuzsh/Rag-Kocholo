Born on May 30, 1912, in New York City, Stein grew up in the Bronx and attended City College of New York. After graduating, he worked as a social worker and then as a writer for the Army Air Force during World War II. Stein began his career in theater as a writer for radio and television in the 1940s and 1950s, but it was his work on Broadway that earned him the most acclaim. His first Broadway credit was as a co-writer on the musical Plain and Fancy in 1955, but it was his collaboration with composer Jerry Bock and lyricist Sheldon Harnick on Fiddler on the Roof that established him as a major force in the theater world. Fiddler on the Roof, which opened on Broadway in 1964, tells the story of Tevye, a Jewish milkman in early 20th-century Russia, and his struggles to maintain his traditions in the face of changing times. The show was a critical and commercial success, running for over 3,000 performances and winning nine Tony Awards, including Best Musical. Stein's book for the show, which was based on the stories of Sholem Aleichem, is widely regarded as one of the greatest in the history of musical theater. Stein went on to collaborate with Bock and Harnick on several more musicals, including The Apple Tree and She Loves Me. He also wrote the book for Zorba, a musical adaptation of the novel Zorba the Greek, which opened on Broadway in 1968 and starred Anthony Quinn. Although Zorba was not as successful as Fiddler, it received positive reviews and has since become a cult favorite among musical theater enthusiasts. In addition to his work on Broadway, Stein wrote for television and film. He wrote the screenplay for the 1971 film adaptation of Fiddler on the Roof, which was directed by Norman Jewison and starred Topol as Tevye. He also wrote for the television series Mister Peepers and The Phil Silvers Show. Stein continued to work in the theater throughout his life, writing plays and musicals up until his death in 2010 at the age of 98. His other notable works include Enter Laughing, a play based on the semi-autobiographical novel by Carl Reiner, and Rags, a musical about Jewish immigrants on the Lower East Side of Manhattan. Stein was known for his wit and his ability to capture the human experience in his writing. In a 2001 interview with The New York Times, he said, \"I think the theater is a way of expressing what's going on in the world and what's going on in people's hearts. It's a way of communicating on a very deep level, and that's what I've always tried to do with my work.\" Stein's contributions to the world of musical theater have been recognized with numerous awards and honors. He was inducted into the American Theater Hall of Fame in 1994, and in 2008, the Tony Awards honored him with a Lifetime Achievement Award. His legacy lives on through his timeless works, which continue to be performed and beloved by audiences around the world.\n\nJERRY BOCK\n\n(Composer) Born into a Jewish family in New Haven, Connecticut, and raised in Flushing, Queens, New York, Bock studied the piano as a child. While a student at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, he wrote the musical Big As Life, which toured the state and enjoyed a run in Chicago. After graduation, he spent three summers at the Tamiment Playhouse in the Poconos and wrote for early television revues with lyricist Larry Holofcener. One of their songs, the three-part \"The Story of Alice,\" was performed by the Chad Mitchell Trio on their Blowin' in the Wind album of 1962.\n\nSHELDON HARNICK\n\n(Lyricist) was born in Chicago in 1924. Following his service in World War II, he earned a Bachelor of Music Degree at Northwestern University, majoring in violin. After working as a professional musician in and around Chicago, he moved to New York in 1950 to pursue a career in the musical theater. Harnick’s first song for a Broadway show was the hilarious “Boston Beguine” for New Faces of 1952. He then contributed songs to the revues Two’s Company (starring Bette Davis), John Murray Anderson’s Almanac and The Littlest Revue. His collaboration with composer Jerry Bock produced such Broadway classics as Fiorello! (1959): Pulitzer Prize, Tony Award; Tenderloin (1960); She Loves Me (1963): Grammy Award; Fiddler on the Roof (1964) Tony Award; The Apple Tree (1966) and The Rothschilds (1970). Other collaborations include A Christmas Carol with Michel Legrand (1981); Rex with Richard Rodgers (1976); A Wonderful Life with Joe Raposo (1986) and The Phantom Tollbooth with Arnold Black (1995). For Dragons and Malpractice Makes Perfect, he provided book lyrics and music. He has written songs for the films The Heartbreak Kid (1972) and Blame It On Rio (1984), both with music by Cy Coleman; and Aaron’s Magic Village (1995) with Michel Legrand.\n\nJEROME ROBBINS\n\n(Original Choreographer) Born on October 11, 1918 in New York, New York, Jerome Robbins went on to become a dancer and celebrated choreographer, earning raves for his ballet debut piece “Fancy Free.” He eventually served as director and/or choreographer on a number of musicals destined to become classics, including The King and I, West Side Story, Gypsy and Fiddler on the Roof. Robbins won an Oscar for his directorial efforts on the film version of West Side Story, and later focused on creating ballets for the stage. He died on July 29, 1998.\n\nMusic Theatre International (MTI)\n\nis one of the world's leading theatrical licensing agencies, granting theatres from around the world the rights to perform the greatest selection of musicals from Broadway and beyond.
