        "text": "Back by Popular Demand\n\nI received so much positive feedback about a previous piece that was posted last year entitled “Opera Goes to Hollywood” that I decided to write a follow-up sequel.\n\nI call it “Hollywood Goes to the Opera.” It follows the same general pattern and style as the earlier one — that is, it establishes the rationale of why movie studios should both stay in and out of the operatic arena, while touching upon the various aspects of this most over-looked of movie sub-genres.\n\nThese additional episodes never made it to the original piece, either because of time constraints or lack of available space. With that said, I hope to make amends with this latest post. I also hope you enjoy these extra morsels as much as I enjoyed researching and writing them.\n\nBiopics Galore\n\nTo quote a phrase from Ripley, “believe it or not” there are dozens of screen biographies of struggling composers, classical musicians, artists, producers and famous opera stars out there, along with their tragically (uh, let’s say “operatically”) inclined lives in-and-out of the theater. It’s no wonder, then, that some of these so-called “efforts” have wound up on the cinematic scrap heap as nothing more than expensive soap duds for the screen, i.e., real celluloid “clunkers,” in the jargon of the time.\n\nSome of the most well-known of these losers include the film “biography” (and I use that term loosely) of our old friend, American soprano Grace Moore. The movie, So This is Love (1953), starring Kathryn Grayson (Kiss Me Kate, Toast of New Orleans) and a pre-talk-show Merv Griffin, is a perfect case in point. The sight of a blonde, flapper-era Grayson is too much to take. And in case you were wondering, Merv is absolutely dreadful in it (no wonder he switched careers by venturing forth into TV Land!).\n\nNext up is the sudser to end all sudsers: Interrupted Melody from 1955, about the star-crossed life of Australian dramatic soprano Marjorie Lawrence, who was cut down in the prime of life by polio, as played by Eleanor Parker, who is about as Australian as Justin Bieber. The film co-stars Canadian Glenn Ford (very good, in fact) as her husband and a pre-007 Roger Moore (duh … not so good). On the soundtrack is the voluminous singing voice of real-life soprano Eileen Farrell, along with a few less familiar names from the period: tenors William Olvis, Rudolf Petrak, and Armand Tokatyan, and diva Marcella Reale. Get out your handkerchiefs for this one, folks. You’re going to need them!\n\nOn the male side of the equation, we have the aforementioned The Great Caruso (1951) with Mario Lanza as the Great One; Tonight We Sing (1953), the musical life of famed impresario Sol Hurok starring David Wayne, who looked nothing at all like Hurok, with opera stars Jan Peerce and Roberta Peters, joined by Italian basso Ezio Pinza as Russian basso Feodor Chaliapin(!), in scenes from Act IV of Gounod’s Faust; and a monstrously fictionalized account of composer Johann Strauss Jr.’s life, called The Great Waltz (1938), with a sparkling star turn by the dazzling coloratura Miliza Korjus (she’s also quite attractive).\n\nAnd then we have the execrable Song Without End from 1960, which purports to describe the amorous affairs of composer and concert pianist Franz Liszt. Featuring an uncomfortably bewigged Dirk Bogarde (who was gay), as Liszt, in his U.S. film debut, and French actress Capucine (who was bisexual) in her first-ever screen appearance, as Princess Caroline, his main love interest. Along with master violinist Niccolo Paganini, Liszt was acknowledged as classical music’s first rock star. About the only thing Liszt had in common with opera, though, was his fiendishly difficult piano transcriptions and heroic championing of the music of Richard Wagner (performed by studio contract player Lyndon Brook), in a scene in which young Liszt is rehearsing the Pilgrim’s Chorus from Tannhäuser. Wagner is given far too short a shrift, and very little screen time, in the troubled and much revised script.\n\nOne of the more unusual Italian-made biopics (of which there are legion) is the risible Laugh Pagliacci (1948), starring Alida Valli and Paul Hoerbiger, Carlo Romano as the composer Ruggiero Leoncavallo, and baby-faced tenor Beniamino Gigli as the singer Morelli. Gigli doubles as the tragic clown Canio in the presentation of the opera proper. It’s based on the famous story (now discredited by most scholars, I’ll have you know) of how Leoncavallo came to write the opera we know today. Who said biopics had to be based on facts?\n\nVerdi, Vidi, Vinci\n\nHouse of Ricordi (1955) is another Mediterranean import about the world renowned music-publishing firm, founded by Giulio Ricordi. Signor Ricordi rubbed elbows with some of the era’s greatest artists, including Verdi, Wagner and Puccini, as well as Brazilian composer Carlos Gomes.\n\nDirected by Carmine Gallone, a past veteran of many an operatic endeavor, it starred Elisa Cegani as Giuseppina Strepponi (Verdi’s mistress), Andrea Checchi as Ricordi, Gabriele Ferzetti as Giacomo Puccini, Fosco Giachetti as Giuseppe Verdi, Nadia Gray as soprano Giulia Grisi, and Fausto Tozzi as librettist Arrigo Boito. With the peerless voices of Tito Gobbi, Mario del Monaco, Renata Tebaldi, Giulio Neri, and Gianni Poggi, this one is given over to the joys of la bella musica italiana.\n\nSpeaking of Verdi, how can we possibly overlook one of the starriest vehicles this side of La Scala: the movie Verdi, the King of Melody, from two years prior (1953), starring Pierre Cressoy (egad, a Frenchman!) as Verdi, and featuring Gaby André (another Frenchie!!), Anna Maria Ferrero, Mario del Monaco as tenor Francesco Tamagno (creator of the title role in Verdi’s masterpiece, Otello), and Gobbi again, playing French baritone Victor Maurel (as Iago). Oh, well … good help was hard to come by, I guess. The director was Raffaello Matarazzo, if that’s any consolation.\n\nCoincidentally, both Gallone and Giachetti were the director and star of an earlier biographical picture about composer Giuseppe Verdi (1938). On the upside, this version featured our rotund friend Signor Gigli as the creator of the role of the Duke of Mantua in Rigoletto — you know, the fellow that gets to sing that familiar aria, “La donna é mobile.” On the downside, it was commissioned by Benito Mussolini’s Fascist regime, which Gigli had been closely associated with throughout Il Duce’s reign — by all accounts, a rather unholy alliance and much to the tenor’s detriment.\n\nNot to be left out of the running, sexy screen idol Gina Lollobrigida was a frequent guest artist in a number of opera-related features. One of Lollobrigida’s more, shall we say, “superior” efforts along this line was her portrayal of the notorious diva Lina Cavalieri in an Italian production of Beautiful but Dangerous (La Donna Più Bella Del Mondo, 1955). Her leading-men were the hammy Vittorio Gassman and stalwart Robert Alda, with tenor Gino Sinimberghi and the voice of Del Monaco. Helmed by an American, Robert Z. Leonard, it was photographed by Mario Bava, who went on to become the Italian horror-movie king and was credited as both writer and director of such “classic” fright flicks as Black Sabbath (1963), Planet of the Vampires (1965) and Baron Blood (1972). So tell me about the opera …\n\nReturning to Stateside, take a gander at Deep in My Heart (1954), the story of operetta composer Sigmund Romberg, with tight-lipped José Ferrer as Herr Romberg, Merle Oberon as Dorothy Donnelly, Walter Pidgeon as Broadway theater baron J.J. Shubert, Paul Henreid as the Great Ziegfeld, and Wagnerian dramatic soprano Helen Traubel in the role of Anna Mueller. This one had the makings of an epic, but sadly ‘twas not to be. It was directed by Stanley Donen (why Donen was chosen for this assignment is anybody’s guess). The film’s biggest claim to fame, however, was a rare screen number, “Dancing Around,” which featured Singin’ in the Rain’s Gene Kelly and his hoofer brother Fred — the only time the two siblings appeared together on film.\n\nFor a change of pace, early in his opera career the Spanish tenor Alfredo Kraus (by way of the Canary Islands) starred in, and supplied the voice for, the legendary Julian Gayarré, in the eponymously titled Gayarré (1958), with Luz Marquez, Adriano Dominguez, Pastor Serrador, and Antonio Riquelme, directed by Domingo Vilademat. Strangely enough, almost 30 years later another Spaniard, the Barcelona-born José Carreras (Josep in the Catalan spelling), also made a film in which he played the same character, Gayarré. It was titled Romanza Final (The Final Romance, 1985). The less said about that title, the better.\n\nHere’s a film that’s never been theatrically released (not is this country, anyway), about the early career of fiery conductor Arturo Toscanini. Young Toscanini (1988) was directed by Italian auteur Franco Zeffirelli (Romeo and Juliet, The Taming of the Shrew, Endless Love) and included an all-star cast of C. Thomas Howell as the titular maestro, Elizabeth Taylor as soprano Nadia Bulichoff (based on a real character), and John Rhys-Davies (of the Indiana Jones and Lord of the Ring series) as an opera director, along with Sophie Ward, Franco Nero as Claudio Toscanini, Jean-Pierre Cassel, tenor Carlo Bergonzi as Signor Bertini, and French actor Philippe Noiret (what, still another Frenchman?) as Brazilian Emperor Dom Pedro II (oh, that makes sense …). How a Frenchman, speaking Italian and dubbed into English, can play a Brazilian emperor is beyond my comprehension, but that’s filmdom for you.\n\nThe highlight of this picture is the 1886 performance of the Triumphal Scene from Verdi’s Aida, a re-enactment of Toscanini’s last minute substitution and salvaging of the performance, at the Imperial Theater in Rio de Janeiro. Taylor’s halting of the production midway through the Second Act with a grandstanding speech about the evils of slavery is pure fiction — and not very convincingly done, at that. Still, Liz does look every inch the pampered prima donna. Considering Zeffirelli’s international reputation in the realm of opera and film, his incompetence in the direction of this turkey remains a cause célèbre. It’s a great, big white elephant, a fascinating curiosity piece in the director’s oeuvre.\n\nBut the most outlandish example of the genre has to be Ken Russell’s half-baked 1970 realization of the sex life of ballet and opera composer Peter Ilyich Tchaikovsky. Called The Music Lovers, and starring the former Dr. Kildare of sixties television fame, a stone-faced Richard Chamberlin, as Tchaikovsky, this purported “biography” is a pitiable mess of a movie. Take, for instance, the extreme close-ups, whereby every bead of sweat and spittle can be spotted and lovingly savored on-screen — how gross.\n\nThe premise behind this work sports the dubious logic that the latent homosexual composer (played by a latent homosexual actor, no doubt!) was driven mad by his inability to truly “satisfy” his long-suffering wife Nina, played to the pathological hilt by the young and lonely Glenda Jackson, who had previously perfected the art of lunacy in Sir Peter Brook’s film adaptation of the play Marat/Sade from 1967.\n\nThe ending is a real hoot, in which the forlorn Tchaikovsky commits suicide by drinking a choleric glass of water. He’s then dropped into a tub of boiling bath water in order to “cure” his disease-ridden, sore-covered body. About the only saving grace this pathetic excuse for a motion picture offers is the composer’s sublime music, conducted on the soundtrack by André Previn and performed by the London Symphony Orchestra. Take a bow, maestro.\n\nNights at the Opera\n\nA second category of Hollywood hokum features an over-abundance of operatic scenes interspersed within a dramatic framework. Perhaps the most celebrated of these is Milos Forman’s delightful Amadeus (1984), adapted by Sir Peter Shaffer from his successful stage play, which presents numerous excerpts from Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart’s The Abduction from the Seraglio, The Marriage of Figaro, Don Giovanni, and The Magic Flute. It gave viewers the erroneous impression that opera was Mozart’s primary focus, which it definitely was not.\n\nIn point of fact, “Wolfie,” as he’s known in the film, was Europe’s most prolific provider of chamber and concert works, as well as symphonies, chorales, church music, salon pieces, piano concertos and other solo instrumental music — you name it. But I do agree with director Forman that operas work better on the screen than mere orchestral accompaniment.\n\nAlthough the plot of John Schlesinger’s Marathon Man (1976), which is based on William Goldman’s novel of the same name (Goldman also wrote the screenplay), has nothing whatsoever to do with opera, there is a fascinating episode connected with this film. It’s the scene at the Paris Opera house, where the aria, “Dors, o citê perverse” (“Sleep, oh perverse place”) from Massenet’s Herodiade, is tellingly sung by French-Canadian bass Joseph Rouleau. After this stirring ode is delivered, lanky CIA agent Roy Scheider, who is back in his Paris apartment (and in his underwear, with the Eiffel Tower prominently displayed), is garrotted from behind by an Oriental-looking assassin. That’s one way to get out your operatic frustrations!\n\nThere are more examples from among literally hundreds of films that not only use operatic arias and/or ensembles to divert one’s attention away from the stale story line, but also feature dozens of unusual concert venues, including in film noir — see Billy Wilder’s The Lost Weekend (1945), where the famous Brindisi (or “drinking song”) from La Traviata helps to move the plot along — and the ever-popular gangster genre.\n\nOne of the best is Francis Ford Coppola’s The Godfather, Part III (1990), which uses Mascagni’s Cavalleria Rusticana as the vehicle for Michael Corleone’s son, Anthony’s operatic debut in Sicily. Played by Al Pacino and Franc d’Ambrosio, respectively, it’s an unsubtle backdrop to the all-too-plentiful vendettas dished out in the film’s finale, where (Spoiler alert: Beware!!!) his younger sister Mary (played by Coppola’s daughter Sofia, who went on to a directing career of her own) is killed in a shootout outside the opera house. No bows there …\n\nAnother such act of gratuitous violence is perpetrated in Brian de Palma’s The Untouchables (1987), starring Kevin Costner and Oscar-winner Sean Connery, which features a scene with the very non-operatic Robert De Niro as notorious Chicago gangster Al Capone, weeping uncontrollably at a tenor’s rendition of “Vesti la giubba” from Pagliacci. In the same instant, he’s being notified that someone he wanted murdered was given the coup de grace. The tenor’s voice belongs to that of the young Mario del Monaco from an early 1950s recording of the complete opera performed by the members of Accademia di Santa Cecilia of Rome, conducted by Alberto Erede. Heck, I should know! I owned that same recording.\n\nKings of Comedy\n\nShifting gears and genres for the moment, Norman Jewison’s wonderful comedy Moonstruck (1987) is about the operatic-like life of two families, and the spinster daughter Loretta (played by Cher, of all people) of one of them who happens to fall in love with the younger brother (Ronny, played by Nicolas Cage) of her fiancé (a rather lily-livered Danny Aiello as a Mama’s boy, if you can believe that).\n\nThe story is told amid the background of an actual performance of Puccini’s La Bohème, which was filmed live from the stage of the Metropolitan Opera House at Lincoln Center in Manhattan. The recording used on the soundtrack is the old London/Decca one, conducted by Tullio Serafin, with Renata Tebaldi as Mimì, Carlo Bergonzi as Rodolfo, Ettore Bastianini as Marcello, Gianna d’Angelo as Musetta, and Cesare Siepi as Colline.\n\nThere’s a marvelous scene in which Ronny invites Loretta to his apartment at 3 a.m. in order to keep her from freezing to death, all to the tune of Rodolfo’s aria “Che gelida manina,” (“Your tiny hand so cold”), a very apropos selection. The whole film is of this caliber, and boasts an understated comic performance by none other than Feodor Chaliapin Jr., the great singer’s son.\n\nThe sinister-looking Signor Chaliapin Jr. also made an eerie guest appearance with Sean Connery and Christian Slater in 1986’s The Name of the Rose, directed by Jean-Jacques Annaud and adapted from the book by Umberto Eco. Junior’s well-nigh devilish countenance in that piece conjures up images of one of his father’s most famous stage roles, that of Satan in Boïto’s opera Mefistofele.\n\nWho could forget another whimsical comedy, the lovable Pretty Woman (1990) with Julia Roberts and Richard Gere as a modern-day Violetta and Alfredo, in which Verdi’s La Traviata figures prominently in the plot; or Meeting Venus (1991), with Glenn Close (voice dubbed by Kiri Te Kanawa) and Niels Arestrup (dubbed by tenor Rene Kollo), about a multinational production of Wagner’s Tannhäuser and the romantic complications that ensue; or the so-called comedy So Fine (1981) with Ryan O’Neal, Mariangela Melato and former James Bond villain Richard Kiel, in which the main shtick was to trash Verdi’s Otello (no, no, anything but that!).\n\nSpeaking of trashing, how about the 1935 classic A Night at the Opera, with its frenzied finale in which the stalwart Allan Jones and the lovely Kitty Carlisle attempt to sing the “Miserere” from Il Trovatore, over the overripe antics of the zany Marx Brothers. Carlisle gets to sing Nedda’s “Ballatella” from Pagliacci early on in the proceedings. Laugh, clown, laugh …\n\nThere are many other prime examples of operatic excerpts in the movies, some more extensive than others, i.e., My Geisha (1962), starring Shirley MacLaine and Yves Montand with Robert Cummings as Lt. Benjamin Franklin Pinkerton, incorporating whole sections from Madama Butterfly; even the ersatz remake of Shakespeare’s A Midsummer Night’s Dream (1999), which was updated to nineteenth-century Tuscany, Italy, used extensive vocal and orchestral music from the rich scores of Puccini, Donizetti and Verdi on the soundtrack. Mamma mia, that’s-a spicy meat-a-ball!!!\n\n(To be continued…)\n\nCopyright © 2013 by Josmar F. Lopes\n\nOrpheus in the Underworld\n\nIn 1959, almost two years after she had officially left the concert platform, Brazilian soprano Bidu Sayão returned from her self-imposed retirement to participate in the recording of a new work entitled A Floresta do Amazonas (“Forest of the Amazon”), written by her close friend and fellow compatriot, the staggeringly prolific Heitor Villa-Lobos.\n\nIt was a vigorous, soul-stirring piece cobbled together from the scattered remnants of his stillborn Hollywood film score for the movie Green Mansions.\n\nBut despite the presence of Brazil’s greatest living classical composer and his favorite native songbird, the album failed to catch fire with fans and quickly went out of print. Villa-Lobos himself was to pass away on November 17, a few short months after the recording was completed.\n\nFor her part, Bidu would never again step into a gramophone studio, nor would she perform before a live paying audience for the remainder of her life.\n\nIn that same year, the revitalized Brazilian motion picture industry — soon to be known as the Cinema Novo (“New Wave”) movement — would test its fledgling wings by becoming the proud beneficiary of a more exceptional multi-cultural event: the worldwide release of French director Marcel Camus’ production of Orfeu Negro, or Black Orpheus, as contemporary English-speaking audiences would come to know it, a movie based on the musical play Orfeu da Conceição (“Orpheus of the Conception Hills”) penned by carioca poet Vinicius de Moraes.\n\nA multi-award winner and surprise international hit, the film’s extraordinarily influential soundtrack, co-written by musicians Luiz Bonfá and Antonio Carlos Jobim, with an able assist from lyricist Moraes, would help launch the coming bossa nova invasion of the early to middle sixties.\n\nThe sultry new sounds that this style of world music actively came to encompass would give an entirely fresh and original slant to the much-maligned term “modern classical music,” literally transforming guitarist Bonfá, the shy piano-playing Jobim, and his hard-living partner, Vinicius, into latter-day Franz Schuberts for their unique songwriting skills.\n\nTheir historic collaboration would sweep Música Popular Brasileira, or MPB for short, into a whole other musical realm, permanently changing the face and focus of jazz and other forms of popular entertainment for years to come.\n\nWhile this was all well and good for the pop and tourist trades, where did it leave the opera? What would happen to the four-hundred-year-old art form in Brazil, now that its feasibility had been suddenly called into question?\n\nIn an earlier posting (“Sadness Has No End” — A Testament to Black Orpheus and the Partnership That Started It All), we found that in 1960 the country’s capital underwent a dramatic changeover from the old Portuguese-dominated cultural center of Rio de Janeiro to the modern, Oscar Niemeyer-designed city of Brasília.\n\nAs an unfortunate consequence of this radical move, Brazil’s major theaters and government-sponsored opera houses were relegated to a perpetual state of penury, if not outright impoverishment.\n\nOpera, as it had been presented and performed in the land of Carnival and samba, was in danger of going the way of the dinosaur. It was gradually being pushed aside to make way for the seductive young charms of the sensuous new kid on the block, the statuesque “Girl from Ipanema.”\n\nGoing on the Record\n\nWith extinction unavoidably looming, there simply had to exist a more practical method for preserving the rich cultural heritage (or what little of it there was) of the Brazilian national opera — not to mention the outstanding creative contributions of so many of its finest proponents — before this cataclysmic event would come to pass.\n\nThe only way this could be done was through the medium of recordings — ironically, the self-same technology that was threatening to displace opera’s intellectual prominence in the first place.\n\nWhy threatening? Had not Bidu Sayão, Heitor Villa-Lobos, Camargo Guarnieri, Francisco Mignone, and dozens of other classical artists before them, committed their best-known interpretations to long-playing disc? Had not the prized theatrical works of Carlos Gomes, Alberto Nepomuceno, and Henrique Oswald been given the deluxe three-record treatment by the major international record labels?\n\nHardly, is the brutally honest response to those queries. While even at the zenith of her European and American operatic career, Bidu Sayão had left only a comparable handful of recorded extracts from her most popular stage parts, with very little in the way of complete works preserved on LP.\n\nHer only commercially available full-length opera recording, made in 1947, was a version on Columbia of Puccini’s La Bohème, with colleagues Richard Tucker, Frank Valentino, Mimi Benzell, Salvatore Baccaloni, and the Orchestra and Chorus of the Metropolitan Opera, conducted by Giuseppe Antonicelli. The album was re-released a few years ago on compact disc by Sony Masterworks. It was a fine, even nostalgic production, but paled in comparison to the classic renditions presided over by Arturo Toscanini, Thomas Beecham, and Tullio Serafin.\n\nAnother of Bidu’s signature roles, that of Norina in Donizetti’s Don Pasquale, was launched into the market only via a private, off-the-air transcription from 1940, and featured Baccaloni, Valentino, and tenor Nino Martini in the leads, with Gennaro Papi as the conductor.\n\nMuch later, the Met itself would issue two wonderful live-broadcast performances from the forties as lavish gift sets for its contributors: the first, from the 1940 revival of The Marriage of Figaro, starred the ever-bewitching Bidu as Susanna, with Italian matinee idol Ezio Pinza as her Figaro; the second, from a 1947 production of Gounod’s Roméo et Juliette, had Swedish tenor Jussi Bjoerling’s impassioned Roméo serenading the sparkling soprano’s Juliette.\n\nBjoerling, who appeared as the lecherous Duke of Mantua, shared the spotlight with Bidu’s “innocent, sheltered girl” depiction of Gilda, in a belated Naxos release of Verdi’s Rigoletto, another Met Opera radio broadcast from December 1945 that also boasted the powerhouse baritone of Leonard Warren. The soprano was appropriately lauded for her application of “small touches” to this part “that made for unforgettable portrayals” overall.\n\nBut as far as satisfying consumers with her thoroughly rounded and much-admired assumptions of Violetta, Gilda, Lucia, Manon, Mélisande, Micaela, or even Rosina, record companies looked to other, more “familiar” voices to fill the Brazilian singer’s shoes — Licia Albanese, Erna Berger, Lily Pons, Victoria de Los Angeles, and Lucine Amara — familiar, that is, to New York record-buying audiences.\n\nIn truth, the rationale for this decision was quite logical: as regrettable as it may have been for her legion of loyal followers, the closing portion of Bidu’s career with the Met and other leading opera houses had coincided with the advent of 33 1/3 long-playing records, occurring sometime around the years 1948-49.\n\nBy the same token, the initial releases of an exciting newcomer named Maria Callas — first on Italian Fonit-Cetra, then at England’s Columbia-EMI/Angel Records — had spurred renewed interest in the once neglected bel canto repertoire, as did the recitals of early-period Verdi, on Decca/London, by the superb lirico spinto Renata Tebaldi, her main rival in the opera house.\n\nCommencing in the 1950s, these two aspiring performers began to record the standard soprano parts (Tosca, Mimì, Violetta, the two Leonoras, Aida, Butterfly, Gioconda, et al.) over an impressive ten-year span. In doing so, they joined with another dominant vocal personality of the time, the Czech diva Zinka Milanov, who had previously signed with RCA Victor, in the hopes of giving the paying public a solid run for their operatic money.\n\nCallas, Tebaldi, and Milanov. This phenomenal recording triumvirate — accompanied by their usual stage-partners Giuseppe Di Stefano, Mario Del Monaco, and Jussi Bjoerling — proved to be a potent combination for millions of record buyers in North America and elsewhere. Their standing in the classical-music world, however, would make it extremely difficult for past operatic luminaries, such as the diminutive Bidu Sayão, to successfully compete with on any conceivable basis.\n\nShunned in the early fifties by an intransigent Met Opera management, poor under-represented Bidu was left holding the empty album cover, as it were, by this intolerable state of recorded affairs — a disappointing casualty in the complete opera-album wars.\n\nLuckily for collectors, her varied interpretations of Brazilian folk tunes; art songs from France, Portugal, and Spain; arias from Italian, French, and Brazilian opera; and lyrical Brazilian and French showpieces, written or arranged for her by Villa-Lobos, Hernani Braga, Barroso Neto, Reynaldo Hahn, and others, have been meticulously restored by Sony, with all of the selections having undergone miraculous sonic transformations; enhancements that have contributed enormously to their shelf-life as well as to their future enjoyment.\n\nGirl of the Golden West and Other Oddities\n\nThe not-so subtle shifting of musical tastes in the 1960s from the classical to the pop arena — with pop steadily encroaching upon opera and, irrevocably, gaining the upper hand — was uppermost in the minds of record owners and producers, and clearly reflected in the preferences of the album-buying public of that period, both in Brazil and in the United States.\n\nThe times were indeed a-changing, as evidenced by the increased attention being paid to native performers Tom Jobim, João Gilberto, Luiz Bonfá, Astrud Gilberto, Baden Powell, Sérgio Mendes, Oscar Castro-Neves, Bola Sete, and their work, by a plethora of entranced American players, among them guitarist Charlie Byrd, saxophonists Stan Getz and Gerry Mulligan, flutist Herbie Mann, trumpeter Dizzy Gillespie, and pianist Vince Guaraldi.\n\nPointing the way toward this newly expansive musical plain, bossa nova, samba, and, to a lesser extent, other varieties of MPB experienced a near-cosmic explosion on North American airwaves and in record shops not seen since the days of Carmen Miranda, almost to the point of over-saturating the imported music mart all too quickly, and too soon, according to some critical ears.\n\nNevertheless, once firmly committed to this unalterable path, Brazil’s homegrown talent (and, more importantly, her audiences) would never again go back to the way things were — the notoriously volatile Brazilian economy would surely see to that, never allowing for the majority of its citizens the experience of such First-World amenities as regular concert-going, the purchasing of vast quantities of classical music albums, the attending of live opera performances, or the listening of long-playing records made famous by native-born classical artists.\n\nIn fairness, though, it must also be added that the U.S. record industry was experiencing many of the same trials and tribulations with respect to the marketing and selling of the classical-music repertoire as Brazil had, only on a more calculated scale.\n\nOnce most of the standard works were more than adequately represented on vinyl, record companies had nowhere else to go except to engage in a treasure hunt for rare and undiscovered “jewels” that might still have gone unnoticed in some obscure corner of the unrecorded repertory.\n\nA perfect illustration of this was the concurrent 1958 release of two competing versions of composer Giacomo Puccini’s Italian-American “spaghetti Western,” the opera La Fanciulla del West (“The Girl of the Golden West”), based on playwright David Belasco’s turn-of-the-century stage spectacular.\n\nAt the time, this infrequently performed work — more a provocative, whole-tone experiment by the renowned Tuscan melodist than a true successor to his previous Belasco influence, Madama Butterfly — had been given an inferior rendering on Cetra of a 1950 radio broadcast from Italy’s Radiotelevisione Italiana (RAI) network, with an even more ineffectual roster of unknowns doing it a disservice.\n\nIt cried out for a modern, technologically advanced production, with a cast of equally distinguished stature to promote it; but instead of one new stereophonic recording, EMI and Decca treated a reticent buying public to two.\n\nThe full story behind these differing releases need not be retold here, but let it suffice that EMI’s project was originally to have featured an exceptional all-star lineup to include the divine Maria Callas, leading man Franco Corelli (three years before his Met debut), and the veteran Tito Gobbi, with the full forces of Teatro alla Scala of Milan, under the firm direction of Lovro von Matačič.\n\nWhat finally emerged from these sessions was a disquieting blend of substitute singers: alongside famed Swedish-born Wagnerian, Birgit Nilsson — herself a last-minute replacement for the departed Callas — EMI enlisted the aid of the all but unheard-of João Gibin, a barrel-chested Brazilian tenor who later changed his name to the more Italianate-sounding “Giovanni,” in place of the formerly announced Corelli; while second-stringer Andrea Mongelli subbed for Gobbi, another ideal cast member to have been dropped from the proceedings.\n\nIn volume three of the book Opera On Record, reviewer Edward Greenfield went on to blithely praise Gibin’s “beautiful shading of tone and dynamic” and his “very distinctive timbre,” which were welcome but decidedly unexpected compliments, given the tidal wave of sound registered by that titan of the turntable, tenor Mario Del Monaco, on the rival Decca set.\n\nIn spite of this lone favorable assessment, negative criticism of the whole misguided EMI venture doomed the album to back-order oblivion. It was sadly prophetic, too, of the complicated course Brazilian opera singers would inevitably take with regard to their own future lack of stability in the post-bossa nova period.\n\nIncidentally, nothing further in the way of commercial recordings was ever forthcoming from Gibin, only a few sporadic appearances in the States, including a debut at San Francisco’s War Memorial Opera House in the middle-sixties, followed a few years later (on June 20, 1972) by a solitary Metropolitan Opera assignment as Radamès in Aida.\n\nApart from Bidu, the only other Brazilian-born, classical vocal artists to be captured by the microphones with any degree of consistency over the years have been, coincidentally enough, three lyric baritones.\n\nAn exceptionally versatile artist, with a “pure, limpid tone and a gorgeously pliant natural instrument,” the darkly handsome Paulo Fortes made his operatic debut, in 1945, as Germont in La Traviata, at the Teatro Municipal in his native Rio de Janeiro.\n\nFor the next half-century, Fortes would enjoy an immensely diversified entertainment career, appearing with many of the major stars of the day (Callas, Tebaldi, Gobbi, Di Stefano, Del Monaco, Gigli, and so forth), as well as performing on radio, in television, and in the movies.\n\nHe sang throughout most of Latin America, even traveling abroad to Italy and Portugal, but preferred to stay close to his home base in Rio. In fact, prior to his death, at age 69, on January 10, 1997, Fortes held the house record for making the most appearances at the Municipal of any artist that had ever sung there. He created the leads in Villa-Lobos’ opera Izaht, as well as in two late works by Francisco Mignone: as Francisco Gomes da Silva in O Chalaça (1972), and Vidigal in O Sargento de Milícias (1978).\n\nHis sole complete opera recording, however, was a live September 1977 “private” version of Gomes’ Salvator Rosa that came late in his career. It was released on the Brazilian Master Class label. He also recorded a number of vocal recitals, none of which are currently available. What remains are some absolutely delightful excerpts of his marvelous Gianni Schicchi on YouTube, in a 1976 performance of Puccini’s one-act comedy staged at Rio’s Teatro São Caetano. Fortes’ ringing voice and superb Italian diction are reminiscent of a young Giuseppe Taddei, while his thespian mannerisms mimic that of the late Tito Gobbi, a leading exponent of the role.\n\nA close contemporary of his was Lourival Braga, who proved as equally adept at portraying scoundrels on the stage as Fortes had been, in particular such colorful baritone rogues as Amonasro, Barnaba, Count di Luna, Scarpia, Tonio, and Don Carlo, among others.\n\nAlthough there is scant biographical information about him — he was born in 1921, made his debut as the elder Germont in 1949, and died in 1978 — Braga left behind several distinguished examples of his work, including a classic Il Guarany, which this author owned at one time, performed in the original Italian, with tenor Manrico Patassini as Peri and soprano Niza de Castro Tank as Cecília, along with the same composer’s Lo Schiavo; both were from 1959 and made in Brazil by Chantecler.\n\nA live 1970 performance of Guarany at Rio’s Teatro Municipal, conducted by Santiago Guerra and starring tenor Assis Pacheco, with Braga again as the villain Gonzalez, was recently reissued in CD format by Master Class. Heavily cut and in mono, it is primarily of historical interest to fans.\n\nA trio of thrice-familiar Puccini operas, made in Bulgaria, of all places, for the budget company Frequenz — one of Tosca with soprano Raina Kabaivanska, tenor Nazzareno Antinori, and conductor Gabriele Bellini; another of Madama Butterfly, again with Kabaivanska, Antinori, and Bellini; and a third of Manon Lescaut with the same team — co-starred Brazilian baritone Nelson Portella, a favorite with European audiences of the seventies and eighties.\n\nThe possessor of a warm and mellifluous singing voice, Portella’s parts in these frequently performed soprano showcases, while still fairly involving dramatically, could hardly be termed as true operatic tours de force. Opposite the splendid recorded competition (and there were many to contend with and choose from, to be certain), the vocally lightweight Portella came off as a dependable but dull routiner, an also-ran before he ever left the starting gate.\n\nPlenty of Pop Stars\n\nSo where had Brazil’s myriad opera talents migrated to all these years? Why were there so few classically trained performers around to fill the empty stage left vacant by the departure of that prima donna par excellence and quintessential role model, Bidu Sayão, from the international opera scene?\n\nOne possible explanation may lie within the pop field itself. As irreconcilable as it might seem to us today, Brazilian power vocalists of the 1940s to the 1960s typically personified the penchant for over-the-top delivery that was so strongly in vogue at the time: they were considered the ne plus ultra of the Latinate style of pop singing much favored in South America’s largest country — at least, until the arrival of bossa nova and MPB.\n\nAmong female interpreters of this type were the legendary Dalva de Oliveira, the creamy-voiced Ângela Maria, and the earth-toned Eliseth Cardoso, three individual stylists who could be construed as direct descendants of the vocal tradition previously set down for them by French chanteuse Edith Piaf, and American jazz-pop specialists Judy Garland, Billie Holiday, and Sarah Vaughan. Impressively moving artists in their own right, they epitomized the raw brand of this emotional, all-or-nothing approach to popular song that had so imbued Brazil’s version of the hit parade.\n\nOn the distaff side, there was (from an earlier generation) the lyrically trained Vicente Celestino, followed, in my own time, by Agnaldo Rayol and Agnaldo Timóteo, three charismatic male performers who possessed powerful tenor-like voices, with all the requisite richness and passion necessary for full-throated vocalizing of the operatic kind.\n\nOne of them, Agnaldo Timóteo, was widely acclaimed for two solid hits from the sixties, the romantic “Meu grito” (“My Cry,” R. Carlos-E. Carlos) and the tender “Mamãe” (Gall-Aznavour), a sweetly sentimental paean to Brazilian mothers everywhere. The other, Agnaldo Rayol, with his fluffy, pompadour hairstyle and choirboy good looks, physically resembled the once fashionable African American pop crooner Johnny Mathis.\n\nMathis, it should be noted, had once taken up serious vocal studies near the start of his career, but abandoned his operatic pursuits in the mid-fifties in favor of the more lucrative song sphere. His smooth-as-silk ballad style became instantly recognizable through the liberal use of head tone and falsetto; whereas Rayol’s more robust sound can best be defined as having a cutting edge to it, what in Italian is often referred to as squillo (pronounced SKWEE-lo, and not to be confused with esquilo, the Portuguese word for “squirrel”).\n\nSquillo is a term used to identify the visceral, penetrating ring in the upper-middle to top-third of the male tenor voice, a somewhat indefinable trait not all members of that voice category can lay claim to. Ideally, Rayol had this quality in spades. Why he chose the popular song route over a possible career on the operatic stage, after having been blessed with such a remarkable, God-given endowment, is not immediately clear. That he had the right equipment in his larynx, however, is absolutely without argument.\n\nLike Frank Sinatra and Tony Bennett before him, two immortal American artists who went through numerous ups-and-downs in their long musical pathways, Agnaldo Rayol had a late-blooming vocal resurgence, characterized by his warbling of the trenchant main theme to the hugely successful soap opera Terra Nostra, “Tormento d’amore” (Viana), sung as a duet with Welsh singing star Charlotte Church.\n\nTheir 1998 Italian-language recording of the number was an unparalleled cultural phenomenon in Brazil, and became, undeniably, Rayol’s most financially prosperous pop foray in years, resurrecting his sagging singing career at a relatively late stage in his professional life.\n\nIt also sounded in eerie imitation of an earlier 1996 Euro-pop confection, “Con te partirò/Time to Say Goodbye” (Quarantotto-Sartori), recorded jointly by tenor Andrea Bocelli and soprano Sarah Brightman. That trite tune spirited the blind Bocelli to the top of the crossover charts, where he has encountered substantial media coverage ever since, however debatable (or unmerited) that may be.\n\nThis was not the first time that an Italian popular song had heightened Brazilian awareness of this crowd-pleasing musical sub-genre.\n\nA major event of 30 years prior, one that did much to signal the final transition over into the pop-music world — and nearly single-handedly derailed the classical “gravy train” in the country, once and for all — was the participation, in the 1968 San Remo Song Festival, by Jovem Guarda (“The Young Guard”) emblem and Brazilian pop sensation, singer and songwriter-turned-TV host Roberto Carlos Braga.\n\nA former radio balladeer, who rose to fame with such ersatz song titles as “É proibido fumar” (“Smoking Not Allowed”), “Quero que vá pro inferno” (“Let it All to Go to Hell”), “Mexerico da Candinha,” and others, Roberto, along with his sound-alike co-host and songwriting partner, Erasmo Carlos (no relation), were inspired, as many of their generation had been, by the sixties pop sounds of The Beatles, The Dave Clark Five, Gerry and the Pacemakers, and other British Invasion groups (known as iê-iê-iê, or “yeah-yeah-yeah” music, in Brazil).\n\nRoberto’s winning entry, “Canzone per te” (“A Song for You”), a sappily written love ballad by Italian composer-performer Sergio Endrigo, was a Neapolitan-inspired romanza aimed squarely at Brazilian youths’ recurring obsession with italianità and the obviously partisan Mediterranean judges of the contest.\n\nAt that fortuitous moment, O Rei Roberto proved that he could deliver the finished goods as well as, if not better than, most of the mediocre talents that had comprised that year’s list of song candidates, thus securing for himself (in Brazil, anyway) the perennial and undisputed title of “The King” of pop music — Elvis Presley and Michael Jackson aside.\n\nThe Brazilian Ratings Battle\n\nAs it eventually played out, the real struggle for audience attention had already begun to be waged on Brazilian television during the mid-1960s in the form of live televised song festivals, but with a slightly different twist: it was not to be a battle against opera or classical music at all, but between the burgeoning Brazilian rock and MPB factions.\n\nThis openly competitive situation,* brought about by the rivalry of these two popular entertainment forms, quickly led to their becoming a regular weekly feature on TV Excelsior and TV Record, the two major networks of the time.\n\nStrangely enough, this same type of domestic programming has even permeated the popular culture of American television of late, what with the recent rebirth of song “contests” recycled as reality shows (with the prime-time mega-hits American Idol, The X Factor, America’s Got Talent and The Voice leading the way) ruling much of the TV-ratings game.\n\nIn Caetano Veloso’s candid look at the era, Tropical Truth: A Story of Music and Revolution in Brazil, the all-consuming, all-pervasive influence that was exerted on promoters, performers, and viewing public alike by this new and highly attractive musical format was convincingly depicted by the Bahian singer-songwriter in surprisingly matter-of-fact fashion:\n\n“After this [1965] festival, producers at the other broadcasting company were also more receptive, and initiated a kind of programming that would transform television as much as music. The idea of song competitions had been borrowed from the San Remo Festival in Italy, but in Brazil, after the success of the first one, it was to acquire different characteristics and carry a different sort of weight. Elis Regina’s performance [of the song ‘Arrastão’] had shown the owners of TV Record how broadly appealing MPB could be with the Brazilian public, the scope of its potential audience as well as prestige… MPB started to be taken seriously in Brazil, in every sense: from the specifically musical aspects to the literary and the political, there was an aura of mission connected to the songs.”\n\nAs a result of this sudden flush with success, fast-rising pop-rock artists of every stripe and persuasion, including the aforementioned Roberto and Erasmo Carlos, Wanderley Cardoso, Wilson Simonal, Elis Regina, Jair Rodrigues, Wanderléa, Chico Buarque, Jerry Adriani, Renato e Seus Blue-Caps, The Fevers, Os Incríveis (“The Incredibles”), and Ronnie Von; to be followed later by Gilberto Gil, Rita Lee and Os Mutantes, Edu Lobo, Caetano Veloso, Maria Bethânia, Gal Costa, and Tom Zé; in addition to Italian pop favorites Rita Pavone, Gigliola Cinquetti, Gianni Morandi, Massimo Ranieri, and others, would reign supreme (for a time) as the “New Young Guards” of the living room.\n\nIn the same, inexplicable manner that Carnival and samba had meshed into a feverish, tropical goulash of colorful rhythmic delights, Brazilian rock and popular song had somehow come to terms, and agreed to peacefully “coexist,” in that genuinely affecting way the Brazilian people seem to have of ingesting non-native musical forms. And, most intriguingly, of turning out lush, finger-snapping works of deceptively simple structure, despite the presence of so much political and economic turmoil, particularly during the military years of the mid-sixties to early eighties.\n\nAlthough opera (and by that, we mean Italian, French, and German opera) had thrived in a few isolated corners of the country — invariably contracted out to visiting artists, foreign conductors, and outside production interests — it would continue to be systematically clobbered into the back-pages of the obituary section by the envious demigods of Brazilian popular music, once they grabbed hold of the entertainment headlines.\n\nAnd they still refuse to let go, as witnessed by the disastrous decline in new and complete opera recordings and by the rapid slimming down of the classical-recorded repertoire by the prime international record companies.\n\nCopyright © 2012 by Josmar F. Lopes\n\n* Nelson Motta, who was one of dozens of qualified participants, described it as “a veritable musical war. Debated passionately on street corners and in bars, in drug stores and in funeral parlors, Brazilian music, young guard or not, was the topic of the moment at the beginning of 1966.”\n\nHOW THE WORLD’S GREATEST TENOR\n\nBECAME ITS BEST-LOVED CULTURAL ICON\n\nLuciano Pavarotti. Say it with me: “Lu-cia-no Pa-va-rotti.” Even his name flows trippingly off the tongue. Ah, to be blessed with his wonderful talent! I could go on for hours about the art of one of the world’s greatest tenors. I’ve decided instead to let the subject speak for himself — or, in Pavarotti’s case, sing — although there will be a fair amount of discoursing along the way.\n\nYou see, I have a personal stake in this overview of the life and career of the late Italian tenor, in that my own passion for opera evolved just as Pavarotti was coming to prominence in the late 1960s to early 1970s. Although I never saw him on stage, I have heard and seen many of his performances on the radio and through recordings and television. But make no mistake: Luciano Pavarotti was a fabulously talented pop star and much admired — and imitated — opera singer of the first rank.\n\nBut how could that be? How could a balding, six-foot-tall, 300-pound-plus, middle-aged male with a scraggly beard, emoting in a strange, impenetrable tongue, reach the absolute pinnacle of international super-stardom? Surely Pavarotti wasn’t the first classically-trained artist to have crossed over into the pop realm, nor would he be the last. He was just the most famous. But how did he do it? I hope to be able to answer that question.\n\nElixir of Love\n\nLet’s begin by discussing Donizetti’s 1832 comic opera, L’Elisir d’Amore or “The Elixir of Love” — specifically the second act aria, “Una furtiva lagrima” (“A furtive tear”), sung by the lead character Nemorino. This was the perfect part for Pavarotti. In fact, it was one of his best stage roles: that of a naïve young farmer, a country bumpkin-type — not too bright but not too dumb, either — from the sticks of la bella Italia, much like the great man himself.\n\nTo convey Nemorino’s shyness, Luciano used his enormous bulk to his advantage in generating sympathy for this fellow. With superb comic timing, he played the character straight, as a big, warmhearted teddy bear of a guy hopelessly in love with Adina, the most popular girl in town. (He would pick the most popular girl as the object of his affection!)\n\nNear the middle of the act, the eligible lasses of the village all crowd around a stunned and clueless Nemorino. Unbeknown to our hero, his rich uncle has just died and left him a small fortune — which explains the female throng’s sudden interest in him. Nemorino thinks his attraction has something to do with the magic elixir he recently purchased from a traveling quack doctor (in reality, it’s a cheap bottle of Bordeaux wine). But as the girls shamelessly flirt about him, Nemorino catches sight of Adina gazing sadly over her shoulder. Out of the corner of her eye, he sees a tear well up and run down her face.\n\nWith this, the poor man is left alone to muse over what he’s just witnessed. Finally he cries out, “Ah, she loves me, yes, she loves me. I see it now. Oh, heaven, if I could die right now I would not ask for more.”\n\nPavarotti wrings every ounce of pathos from this piece. His easygoing demeanor, crystal-clear diction, and unforced delivery are perfect examples of what is termed bel canto, or “beautiful singing,” at its best, a style once popular in nineteenth-century opera that became the essence of this tenor’s art.\n\nNeedless to say, Nemorino wins the day (and the girl), and all ends happily for them. Indeed, Pavarotti earned repeated praise for this part every time he performed it — and with good reason.\n\nRise to Fame\n\nThe story of Luciano Pavarotti’s rise to international renown is very much the story of Italian opera and song, and of American mass culture and crossover entertainment, as we’ve come to accept it, from the 1970s onward.\n\nDuring his long professional career Pavarotti sang most everything an Italian tenor could conceivably sing, and a whole lot more besides: from the intricate bel canto masterworks, to his rare forays into Mozart territory; from the major roles of the master Verdi, to the best of the Puccini repertoire. With one notable exception (Donizetti’s Daughter of the Regiment), he sang almost exclusively in his native Italian.\n\nOn the debit side, Luciano tackled lead parts he probably had no business attempting in the first place — for example, Verdi’s Otello, in an ill-fated outing with the Chicago Symphony; the same composer’s Don Carlo, for which he was roundly booed at Milan’s La Scala Opera; Leoncavallo’s Pagliacci and Giordano’s Andrea Chénier, works that were much too heavy for his naturally lyric tone, while studiously avoiding more rewarding roles he undoubtedly would have excelled in, in particular Gounod’s Faust and Meyerbeer’s Les Huguenots.\n\nHe appeared on numerous late-night talk shows, in dozens of magazine ads and TV commercials — most famously for American Express. “Do you know me?” was the catchphrase at the time; after that well-placed marketing ploy aired in prime time, who didn’t know who Luciano was?\n\nHe sang on the radio and in live television broadcasts, recorded a variety of operas and song recitals, in addition to giving numerous charity benefits, wherein he shared the limelight with such iconic pop figures as Sting, Bono, Elton John, Michael Bolton, Cyndi Lauper, Eric Clapton, Andrea Bocelli, Zucchero, and many, many others.\n\nHe even tried breaking into mainstream Hollywood with the 1982 feature Yes, Giorgio, a bold move engineered by his then-manager and brain-trust, Herbert Breslin, a part allegedly “tailor-made” for the tenor’s talents.\n\nWhat was so unusual about that? Why, from the early silent and sound periods to the postwar boom era, and beyond, many of opera’s stellar attractions have tried to make a go at a motion picture career: remember Geraldine Farrar, Lawrence Tibbett, and Grace Moore? How about Lily Pons, Lauritz Melchior, Nelson Eddy, Jeanette MacDonald, Risë Stevens, and Ezio Pinza?\n\nThe most memorable of them all was Mario Lanza, whose volcanic personality, temperamental “prima donna” antics, and huge box-office drawing power Pavarotti soon began to emulate — for better and (usually) for worse.\n\nUpon seeing the finished product, most critics and reviewers shook their heads in disbelief at the banality of Yes, Giorgio: “No, Luciano,” was the negative cry, as they scolded him in unison for his efforts. The film was supposed to have mirrored the happy-go-lucky, jet-set lifestyle of a famous opera star (talk about typecasting!), who falls in love with a throat specialist (actress Kathryn Harrold) after almost losing his voice.\n\nAbout the only thing this bomb lost was the studio’s money. As a result, it turned out to be the biggest flop of Pavarotti’s 40+-year career. Still, whatever Luciano did for his art, and wherever he went, the fans were sure to follow. Like an Italian Pied Piper, Pavarotti set the standard for performing in the most exotic of locales, becoming the very model of a modern, major opera star of his day: from the concert hall to the sporting arena, he always gave them their money’s worth, whether it was at New York’s Great Lawn and Madison Square Garden, or London’s Hyde Park; the Baths at Caracalla, Paris’ Eiffel Tower, or Beijing’s Forbidden City.\n\nSpeaking of Beijing, it was said that while en route to that distant, faraway land Pavarotti took along entire sets of cooking utensils, pots, pans, fresh fruits and vegetables, all sorts of meat and an untold number of homemade dishes, all on the unsubstantiated rumor of how miserable the eating and living conditions were there. After a while, most of the food had to be thrown away. A pity!\n\nNotwithstanding the constant travel, the temper tantrums, the petty jealousies and feuds among rivals, and the pressures of a classical-music career — oh, and don’t forget the occasional fling with the ladies — Luciano’s voice held up remarkably well under the circumstances, and usually rang out with its customary brilliance and warmth, especially in its highest reaches. Not for nothing was he crowned, “King of the High C’s,” by journalists.\n\nThree Tenors Franchise\n\nWhile not a particularly large instrument per se, it possessed the requisite carrying power and “ping” needed to be heard in the farthest reaches of the auditorium. He had no trouble at all being heard at Caracalla, what with all the microphones and camera equipment lying about, when, in July of 1990, on the eve of the World Cup Soccer Finals in Rome, The Three Tenors franchise was formally launched.\n\nThis was a financially lucrative endeavor that paired the “King” with his two main rivals: the Spanish-born Plácido Domingo and younger colleague José Carreras. It was Carreras who, after recovering from a five-year battle with cancer, hit upon the innovative idea of doing a benefit concert for his leukemia foundation.\n\nWith a billion and a half viewers worldwide, it was the most-watched classical-music program in history. In addition, the subsequent compact disc made of the much-hyped media event became the best-selling classical album of all time. Bravo, Luciano!\n\nThis desire to branch out into uncharted vocal waters (and be all-things to all-people) was characteristic of Pavarotti’s eagerness to please his public, as well as to satisfy his own conscious need to be adored — this, despite the tenor’s repeated assurances that he was only trying to bring the operatic art form to the vast, untapped masses longing to hear the master sing.\n\nIt’s safe to say that no artist since the great Enrico Caruso had done more to popularize Italian opera and song than Luciano had, with Lanza running a close second.\n\nMany suspected that, at this point in his career, he was only in it for the money. John von Rhein, music critic for the Chicago Tribune, put the matter into perspective with the following assertion: “When [Pavarotti] extended his trademark white handkerchief to the legions of enraptured fans who packed his concerts, it seemed as if he were embracing the world, assuring every listener he was singing just for them. He drank in their fervent applause as if it were mother’s milk.”\n\nI couldn’t have said it better myself.\n\nHumble Origins\n\nFor all his fame and notoriety, near or away from the concert platform, the charismatic primo tenore did not start out in life with the notion of conquering the world of grand opera. Oh, no. In fact, it’s almost a cliché to say that he came from real life, humble origins.\n\nHe was born in the Northern Italian city of Modena, on October 12, 1935 — Columbus Day, to be exact, a national holiday. He would later serve as Grand Marshall for New York’s Columbus Day Parade, leading the procession on horseback and draped in his country’s national flag.\n\nHis father, Fernando, was a baker by profession, who sang in the town’s amateur choral group. He was blessed with a high, resonant voice, which many in the city came to believe found its way to his son, Luciano’s, golden throat. Pavarotti at first trained as an elementary school teacher before settling upon a full-time singing career. Like any red-blooded, Italian native son, he loved soccer and harbored an unfulfilled ambition of one day becoming a professional athlete.\n\nWhen that failed to materialize — no doubt due to his inability to turn away generous helpings of the local cuisine — he turned instead to selling insurance to make ends meet, before taking up his musical studies with former tenor Arrigo Pola in his hometown, then moving on to vocal coach Ettore Campogalliani, who also taught his childhood friend, the soprano Mirella Freni.\n\nPavarotti’s professional stage debut occurred on April 29, 1961, as Rodolfo in Puccini’s La Bohème, at the Teatro Reggio Emilia. This was a good choice for the tenor, in that he continued to rely on this role as his frequent calling card and “good luck” piece throughout the early portion of his career.\n\nThe opera itself is a paean to young love. It follows the time-tested, tried-and-true formula of boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy gets girl — girl dies. As cartoon character Bugs Bunny once astutely observed, “Well, what did you expect in an opera? A happy ending?” One of Puccini’s own librettists, Giuseppe Giacosa, characterized the melodious four-act work as, “All poetry and no plot, while Tosca,” the opera that immediately followed Bohème, “is all plot and no poetry.” There’s a great deal of truth to that statement.\n\nNevertheless, it was good enough to serve as the premiere showcase for the first of the Live From the Met series of telecasts, broadcast on Public Television, in March 1977, which Pavarotti played a historic part in. A trivia note: more people watched La Bohème on TV that one night than had seen the opera on stage in the entirety of its 80-year existence — so much for the power of the medium.\n\nThis little tidbit of information was not lost on Luciano, who made a conscious effort thereafter to use television and the infant CD and home video market to advance his newfound celebrity status — a wise move on his part.\n\nBefore that groundbreaking event took shape, he had taken the lovesick poet Rodolfo all over the operatic world. Most of his initial appearances in Europe, South America, and the U.S. were in this one role, including his official Metropolitan Opera debut, on November 23, 1968 — coincidentally, within a few short weeks of a certain Señor Plácido Domingo’s first appearances there. These two supremely gifted individuals would go on to form a friendly rivalry of sorts — well, not always so friendly.\n\nBoy Gets High on C\n\nGetting back to La Bohème, where most tenors ran aground in this challenging work, due to its high-lying vocal range, Pavarotti wallowed in it: his voice opens up gloriously the higher up it goes. A good illustration of this is the aria, “Che gelida manina” (“Your little hand so cold”). At its climax, Luciano takes a full-voiced high C easily and quite comfortably, holding on to the note for dear life but with enough breath left over to complete the phrase.\n\nListen to how Rodolfo, the “boy” in this case, manages to convey his romantic sentiments to Mimì, the “girl,” in such a heartfelt, straightforward, and unassuming manner. The technique employed is known as parlando, or “speaking” the lines of the piece, and is as much a part of the tenor’s own natural way with words as it was the composer’s exceptional ear for expressing everyday conversation in song.\n\nBut as good as it was, Pavarotti made an even bigger splash over at London’s Covent Garden, and especially at the Metropolitan Opera House, in the 1972 production of The Daughter of the Regiment, the one with the nine high C’s. Try doing that on a regular basis!\n\nIn his tell-all book, The King and I, manager Herbert Breslin noted that, as physically big as Luciano was back then — and he only got bigger over time — he was still able to cavort about the stage with complete abandon. Dressed up to resemble an enormous toy soldier, he was as engaging “in character” as he was out of it.\n\nHe had to do something to stand out from the crowd. He was, after all, competing against a veritable who’s-who of opera’s biggest and brightest talents. Two of the very best, Australian soprano Joan Sutherland, his co-star in Daughter of the Regiment, and her husband, conductor Richard Bonynge, along with mezzo Marilyn Horne and soprano Beverly Sills, formed the major contingent of the bel canto revival at the Met and elsewhere.\n\nIt was around 1965, during a fourteen-week “down under” tour of Australia, that Pavarotti started to make a name for himself by his close association with the couple. Legend has it they were enticed not only by his beautiful sound, but by his imposing height: being close to six-feet herself (in her high-heel shoes, of course) Dame Joan was tired of tenors a foot shorter than she was. She wanted a partner who could stare down into her eyes instead of up into her neck. She took one look at Luciano, and he was hired on the spot.\n\nIt’s a shame he didn’t stick with bel canto, though, for he was such a natural fit for that long dormant form. Instead, he opted to branch out into more accessible projects in order to accommodate the vast majority of patrons still clamoring to see him.\n\nThat’s not to say he did not meet with continued success in his chosen field. Quite the contrary, he became a winning interpreter of the Verdi canon — most notably, as the womanizing Duke of Mantua in Rigoletto; the kindhearted Gustavo in Un Ballo in Maschera; the heroic Manrico in Il Trovatore, which, if memory serves me, has a few forceful high C’s of its own; and the title character in Ernani.\n\nHis most frequent assignment after Rodolfo and Nemorino was that of the painter Mario Cavaradossi in Puccini’s “shabby little shocker,” Tosca. He not only repeated it a total of 60 times at the Met alone, he made all his farewell appearances in it, the last of which took place on March 13, 2004.\n\nThat date was the unfortunate culmination of the final phase of his once illustrious career, the so-called era of self-indulgence: that of the cork-died hair and painted-on eyebrows; the inability, or just plain laziness, to learn new roles; the last-minute cancellations; the struggles with his weight; the heavy use of cue cards to bolster his faulty memory; the highly publicized battles with ex-wife Adua; the marriage to his former secretary Nicoletta, a woman 35 years his junior; the assorted physical ailments, that took their inevitable toll on his health and well-being, ending in knee and hip replacement surgery; and so on, and so forth.\n\nAs Rodolfo once marked the beginning of his good fortune, Cavaradossi now marked the end of it, most presciently at Lyric Opera of Chicago: in 1989, after canceling over half of his scheduled appearances there, the tenor was dropped from the cast, as well as being declared persona non grata at the house, a bad omen indeed. Pavarotti took it all in stride, commenting afterwards, “I was as unlucky for Chicago as Chicago was for me.”\n\nEnd of the Rainbow\n\nHe tried doing it again, at the Metropolitan of all places, in a series of benefit performances penciled in for May 2002. The role? You guessed it: Cavaradossi. His excuse? The common cold, only this time the Met’s management had an ace up its sleeve: they had secretly flown in their latest tenor discovery, the 33-year-old Sicilian sensation, Salvatore Licitra (who passed away himself, on September 5, 2011, from a tragic motorcycle accident), in case Luciano decided to cancel the engagement.\n\nTrue to form, Pavarotti pulled out, and the local press had a field day with news of the non-event: “Fat Man Won’t Sing,” went the headlines! Diving for cover went the Met’s general manager, Joseph Volpe. Two years later, both Volpe and the Fat Man agreed to make peace with each other, as Luciano finally sang his last in the role that got him into all the trouble in the first place: Cavaradossi!\n\nOnly now, because of the physical limitations imposed on his movements, his late-career re-assumptions of the role were fairly static ones. Whatever the director, producer, or prompter, had in mind for the singer to do, photographs from that period show an all-but immovable Pavarotti practically glued to the furniture.\n\nHe was helped, to and fro, by numerous “unseen” hands throughout; in Act II of the opera, where Cavaradossi is arrested, brought in, questioned, then tortured in an adjoining room, it seemed easy for the tenor to get away with being carried about the stage by an army of able-bodied assistants — it was all part of the show, wasn’t it?\n\nIn the last act, however, Cavaradossi is awaiting his execution by firing squad. He reminisces about seeing Tosca for the last time and bids farewell to his love in the melancholy air, “E lucevan le stelle” (“And the stars were brightly shining”).\n\nThe most telling aspect of his reverie is the last line: “And never have I loved life so much!” We could say the same about Pavarotti: in spite of all that he had been through those last years, never had he loved his life as much as he did then.\n\nOn September 6, 2007, a golden voice was silenced forever, as the sad news was transmitted over the world’s airwaves: tenor Luciano Pavarotti, at age 71, had passed away from complications brought on by pancreatic cancer. We mourned his death, but celebrated his life. He won our hearts and moved us with his talent and charm; his joie de vivre and embrace of all humanity; his virtues and his faults; his triumphs and his failures.\n\nIn the 1982 film Yes, Giorgio, surely a failure of titanic proportions if ever there was one, Pavarotti ended the flick with what was later to become his signature tune, the aria “Nessun dorma” (“No one shall sleep”) from the opera Turandot, Puccini’s last, unfinished masterpiece.\n\nThe story goes that, at the opera’s gala premiere at La Scala, conductor Arturo Toscanini, a personal friend of the composer — and no slouch himself when it came to promoting classical music in this country — upon reaching the point in the drama that Puccini stopped writing, turned to the audience and said, in a voice choked with emotion: “It was here that the Maestro laid down his pen.”\n\nIt seems appropriate now that we finish this account of the life and career of Luciano Pavarotti with Prince Calàf’s heroic song of triumph, the final phrases of which ring out, in rising tones: “Vincerò! Vincerò!” – “I shall win! I shall succeed!” And you know what? I believe he did.\n\nSo who put the “pop” in Pavarotti? He did, of course, by just being himself. And how did the world’s greatest tenor become its best-loved cultural icon? By doing the thing he loved best: by singing everything and everywhere. He truly was all-things to all-people. And the best thing to happen to the art of Italian song since pizza. ♫\n\nCopyright (c) 2010 by Josmar F. Lopes\n\nMario Lanza was dressed to the nines as Enrico Caruso, one of the world’s greatest and most beloved opera stars — and a lifelong tenor idol. Lanza was fulfilling his childhood dream of making a film biography of the great man’s life for MGM Studios. It was to be called, appropriately enough, The Great Caruso. But if Mario had had his way, it would have been titled The Great Lanza.\n\nAs the conductor nodded for him to proceed, Lanza opened his million-dollar throat and proceeded to bawl out the aria, “Celeste Aida,” at the top of his lungs, capping the romantic piece off with a loud and protracted final B-flat.\n\nNever mind that the work’s composer, Giuseppe Verdi, marked the high note to be taken softly; never mind that the film’s script, supposedly based on Dorothy Caruso’s 1945 biography of her late husband, was a complete and utter fiction, replete with numerous fabrications concerning the tenor’s life and career on and off the stage; and never mind, too, that there was no audience present to wildly applaud Lanza’s self-indulgence and lack of musical taste.\n\nWhat mattered most to Lanza was that his legion of fans would soon be going to their neighborhood movie theaters to see the world’s most famous “opera” star make good on his boast that he was, without question, Caruso’s heir apparent — if not on the stage, then in the cinema.\n\nEven though he was probably the best known classical-music artist to appear in motion pictures, Mario Lanza was the least “operatic” opera tenor ever to have graced the silver screen. Not that it ever prevented him from becoming one of Hollywood’s starriest attractions, as well as a bringer of highbrow entertainment to the unenlightened masses. It helped that he was an established pop idol who sold millions of hit records all over the world.\n\nRemarkably, even during the silent-film era, opera on the screen was a widely accepted form of diversion, rivaling the Western, slapstick comedy, and serious melodrama in popularity and appeal. This may strike modern-day viewers as a bit of an oxymoron (given that most silent films had voice track to speak of), but that was the attitude back then, in the burgeoning days of silent cinema where sight was more precious than sound.\n\nWith the advent of the all-talking, all-singing motion picture, opera and classical music, together with popular songs, musical comedy, dance-hall numbers, and all manner of variety acts — the proverbial “dog and pony” shows of yore — became increasingly heard as well as seen.\n\nTheater, the Absurd\n\nBefore silent films, the only acting available to the paying public was in the legitimate theater and along the well-traveled vaudeville route, which stretched from the predominantly Jewish “borscht belt” in upstate New York to the hundreds of small-town gathering halls and recreation centers blanketed across the continental United States.\n\nOpera, for better or worse, was a regular part of musical life in just about every one of these whistle-stop stages, mostly throughout the latter part of the nineteenth and into the early-twentieth centuries. Wherever there was a rough and ready theater available, one could typically find opera coexisting nearby.\n\nThus, a long-established performance tradition of opera had already been established just as the fledgling film industry began making its way across the country. The logical leap from stage to screen, and from music drama to movie melodrama, seemed not only plausible but well-nigh inevitable.\n\nAs a result, opera singers became frequent participants in a fairly large number of modest film productions. But despite their appearances in either silent or sound form, these artists’ acting abilities tended to mirror those of the legitimate stage in terms of melodramatic content and style.\n\nAnd nothing could be more incongruous to moviegoers than to have opera performed within the structural confines of celluloid (or nitrate, as the case may be). For opera, as an art form, is by its nature a thoroughly theatrical endeavor. It demands — no, it insists — upon the presence of a live audience to be fully effective and appreciated.\n\nNevertheless, both silent and sound films starring famous opera singers in scenes, acts, arias, concerts, and ensembles were a common occurrence — a case of the art transcending the medium in which it originated. Often, it was the only way for audiences to enjoy opera performances. For many, it would be their first, if not only, exposure to this singular entertainment form.\n\nOn a personal note, opera is a subject I am well versed in. As well I should be, after almost 50+ years of listening to it on the radio and in recordings, seeing it performed on the stage, and watching it on television and on DVD/Blu-ray Disc. What has always attracted me about this under-appreciated but most fascinating of cinematic sub-genres, however, is the singing, in addition to the incredibly larger-than-life personalities who gave their all in helping to shape it.\n\nBut talk is cheap, as they say, and the proof is always in the pudding (or singing). So now, without further ado, let the curtain be raised on “Opera Goes to Hollywood.” Please enjoy the show! Oh, and no talking during the performance. Thank you!\n\nEarly Silent Offerings\n\nThere is some controversy among historians and scholars as to which piece of film was the first to feature an operatic performance.\n\nClearly, it’s difficult to count a thirty-second clip of Carmencita, a Thomas Edison-produced short made in 1894, of an actress performing the Habañera; or a brief two-minute showing of Donizetti’s Daughter of the Regiment, made in New York around the year 1898, as the first of these pioneering efforts. All the same, they both share the honor of being the earliest of such historical records.\n\nAn hour-long silent version of Gounod’s opera Faust appeared a few years later, and is more likely the first “full length” operatic film treatment. Shown in 1907, Faust incorporated a rudimentary form of pre-recorded, synchronized sound that, if eyewitnesses from that era can be deemed reliable sources, proved quite a novelty around the turn of the century.\n\nOther, more elaborate productions soon followed, some with live orchestral accompaniment, others with simultaneous vocal arrangements added to live screenings. In fact, many of these projects were built around the personal magnetism, or “star quality,” of the individual performers involved.\n\nInterestingly, some singers’ acting abilities actually complemented their silent screen images, while others no doubt detracted from them, most likely due to their lack of the most elementary of thespian skills.\n\nTwo of the best examples of the latter were the ones that starred the twentieth-century’s leading opera figure, Neapolitan tenor Enrico Caruso. The first, My Cousin, was made in 1918, and the second, The Splendid Romance, a year later. They came fairly late in Caruso’s career and did nothing in the way of furthering this extraordinary artist’s already cemented reputation. They might even have detracted from and caused a few cracks in his established legacy.\n\nMy Cousin proved such a dismal flop that his second feature went unreleased. It was one of the great man’s relatively few missteps in an otherwise stellar singing career.\n\nIncidentally, it is his voice the dog Nipper happens to be listening to in the world-famous His Master’s Voice advertisements of the period. But the failure of so celebrated a stage figure as Caruso led to doubts as to the merits of the whole inflated enterprise from its very inception.\n\nWoman’s Work is Never Done\n\nA few years before the tenor’s ill-fated film foray, his frequent partner on the stage, American soprano Geraldine Farrar, had shown her colleagues how it could be done. Her own silent-screen debut occurred in a movie version of Carmen (1915), based not on Georges Bizet’s tragedy but on the original Prosper Mérimée novella.\n\nIt was directed by movie mogul Cecil B. DeMille, who brought out Farrar’s beauty, charm, flirtatious nature, and beguiling presence — so much so that it captured the fancy of movie fans. The crafty DeMille’s insistence on absolute realism throughout, which included a live, onscreen bull fight (the first to be staged in Los Angeles in many a year), made the film a runaway hit.\n\nFarrar worked on five more features for the demanding Mr. DeMille, including one of Joan the Woman (1916), a very theatrical retelling of the story of the Maid of Orleans, Joan of Arc, and the first of the director’s religious pictures. But the bulk of her studio output was unrelated to opera. She left Hollywood for good in 1920.\n\nAll things being equal, it was Farrar’s stunning success in motion pictures that inspired Caruso to attempt a screen sojourn of his own. Still, the pleasures and pitfalls of a career in moviedom left many a hit-or-miss affair for singers great and small.\n\nNot to be outdone, producer Samuel Goldwyn secured the services of another great soprano of the period, the Scottish-born Mary Garden, for the then-staggering sum of US $10,000 dollars a week. She committed one of her most memorable stage roles to film, that of Massenet’s exotic courtesan Thaïs, in 1917.\n\nThough she was without doubt Farrar’s chief rival on the stage, Garden was unable to score a bulls-eye with discriminating audiences, despite interest in the venture from the Vatican itself. She gave the genre one last try, in the unsuccessful The Splendid Singer (1918), and then promptly bid farewell to Hollywood for the stage.\n\nAnother beauty from that bygone era — one equally renowned for her amorous affairs and for her scantily-clad revues with the Paris Folies-Bergère — was the gorgeous Italian diva Lina Cavalieri, who participated in a British-made Manon Lescaut in 1914, with her third husband, Metropolitan Opera tenor Lucien Muratore.\n\nAdapted for the screen from the Abbé Prévost novel about the desirable young French coquette, it was the first of several productions Ms. Cavalieri starred in prior to 1921. Despite her obvious good looks and seductive charm, her lack of acting talent forced Cavalieri to abandon the cinema for the remainder of her career.\n\nA rather offbeat 1915 production of Madame Butterfly starred, of all people, America’s sweetheart Mary Pickford (she of the waif-like golden curls), appallingly miscast as the Japanese geisha girl, Cio-Cio San. Because of copyright infringement laws, the film followed the original John Luther Long story instead of the composer’s more familiar setting.\n\nThere are many such examples of both the fortuitous and the egregious nature of opera stars in the silent era. Perhaps the most telling of these took place in French director Abel Gance’s massive six-hour historical epic Napoleon, released in 1927. Ever the creative visionary, Gance relied on the effective casting of Russian tenor Alexander Koubitzky as the revolutionary firebrand, Georges-Jacques Danton.\n\nThe rightness of his choice bore fruit in the great scene where Danton leads the seven hundred “bloodthirsty” extras at the Club des Cordeliers in an overly exuberant rendition of the French national anthem, La Marseillaise. The emotional content of this scene proved all the more powerful, given Koubitzky’s stirring delivery of the song and the active involvement of all concerned — done, oddly enough, without the benefit of sound.\n\nThe Lion Sings Tonight\n\nSpearheading the no less frequently plowed field of operetta was the scandalously opulent, and staggeringly over-budgeted, MGM production of Franz Lehár’s The Merry Widow (1925). It boasted a bizarre combination of actress Mae Murray with the elegant John Gilbert, one of the screen’s most passionate lovers (next to Rudolph Valentino, of course).\n\nAt the helm was Viennese actor-director Erich von Stroheim, once billed as “The Man You Love to Hate,” and for good reason. The frequent clashes between the martinet director, his female lead, and MGM’s head of production, boy wonder Irving Thalberg, led to Stroheim’s walking off the set on a number of occasions, and to his eventual banishment from La-La-Land for his wanton wastefulness.\n\nThese backstage machinations did not prevent the film from becoming a massive hit with the public (if not the critics), despite the obvious lack of operatic talent. It was an interesting reversal of the commonly held notion that female divas, not their directors and producers, were the “prima donnas” of the art form.\n\nThe studio followed this up with a silent version of La Bohème (1926), which became an even more potent box-office draw. It brought to the screen the delicate and fragile Mimi of the lovely Lillian Gish, in her highly-publicized MGM film debut. Her co-star in this project was the ever-dashing John Gilbert (in one of his most “overripe” assumptions) as the poet Rodolphe.\n\nAgain, due to copyright infringement issues, the photoplay was based not on the popular Puccini work but on the stories found in Henri Murger’s book, Scènes de la vie de bohème (“Scenes of Bohemian Life”), the same source Puccini’s librettists had used for their successful stage version.\n\nGish was singled out for her fine screen work. Indeed, her heart-rending death scene was particularly poignant. With comedian Edward Everett Horton as Colline (a musician in this version), Renée Adorée as Musette, and Gino Corrado (Hollywood’s perpetual Italian waiter) as the painter Marcel, and directed in sumptuous fashion by King Vidor, La Bohème left mascara stains on just about every cheek — a five-handkerchief tearjerker if there ever was one.\n\nBasso Cantante\n\nThe Adventures of Don Quixote (1933), an early sound production, starred yet another famous singer from the halcyon days of the gramophone era: the Russian émigré bass Feodor (sometimes written as Fyodor) Chaliapin.\n\nBut unlike his contemporary Caruso before him (who passed away in 1921), the formidable Chaliapin was nearing the end of his operatic career when he was lured out of retirement for a chance to capture for posterity his striking persona in one his most vibrant stage portraits.\n\nSurprisingly, this Don Quixote was not the Massenet version of the story, which Chaliapin had premiered in some 20 years prior, but a more faithful rendering of Miguel de Cervantes’ great novel (filmed in simultaneous French, English, and German-language versions) by Czech-born director G.W. Pabst (Pandora’s Box), with music by Frenchman Jacques Ibert.\n\nChaliapin even got to deliver four new songs composed especially for the film, which introduced viewers to his mellifluous yet elongated vocal style.\n\nThe moving finale has the bass intoning a final adieu to his loyal friend, the put-upon Sancho Panza (played by George Robey), as the pages of Cervantes’ huge tome miraculously reappear after having been thrown into the flames by the Spanish Inquisition.\n\nTenors, We Have Tenors\n\nWith the European community thriving as a cultural magnet for international talent, opera stars (in other words, tenors in particular) continued to dominate musical films in the period between the two world wars.\n\nThese films served to introduce a bevy of lyrical voices to the silver screen. Among the many productions released were sweetly sentimental trifles from pudgy Italian sensation Beniamino Gigli: Forever Yours (1937), with Joan Gardner and Hugh Wakefield, directed by Zoltan Korda and Stanley Irving; and Solo per te (1938), with fellow opera stars Maria Cebotari and Michael Bohnen.\n\nThere were marvelously musical ones from Austrian operetta king Richard Tauber, who appeared in a number of German and British-made quickie features during the thirties: Das Land des Lächelns (“The Land of Smiles”) from 1930; Blossom Time and April Romance, both 1934.\n\nPolish tenor Jan Kiepura was another favorite who enjoyed a high degree of popularity away from the proscenium. He appeared frequently with his wife, soprano Marta Eggerth, in many a European-style production, among them The City of Song (1931), Tell Me Tonight (1932), My Song for You (1933), My Heart is Calling (1934), Give Us This Night and Thank You Madame (1936), and The Charm of La Bohème (1937), yet another version of Puccini’s poetic opera.\n\nAnd Italian troubadour Nino Martini made his mark first in England, then in Hollywood, with several low-budget items, among them The Gay Desperado (1936), co-starring Ida Lupino and Leo Carrillo (The Cisco Kid), wherein he got to sing the lovely “The World is Mine Tonight,” a dead-ringer for Puccini’s “O mio babbino caro” from Gianni Schicchi. It was directed by the stylish Rouben Mamoulian; and Music for Madame (1937), with Joan Fontaine and lantern-jawed Alan Mowbray.\n\nMartini’s acting style was, to put it mildly, straight out of the Chico Marx School of Ersatz Italian. He succeeded only in perpetuating the stereotype of the dimwitted foreigner who stumbles onto the American dream through dumb luck and his own latent musical talent. You could say that Martini was the Forrest Gump of his generation.\n\nMoving to our own shores, Hollywood can boast of the wavy-haired presence and stalwart tenor voice of the late, great Allan Jones, the son of a Pennsylvania coal miner.\n\nJones’ first appearances were on the Broadway stage before embarking on a movie career, where he made many delightful musical films. Some of the more rambunctious were with the Marx Brothers, especially A Night at the Opera (1935), where he served as Kitty Carlisle’s love interest and sang the gorgeous musical number, “Alone”; and A Day at the Races (1937).\n\nHe went on to team with comics Bud Abbott and Lou Costello in their hastily thrown together screen debut, One Night in the Tropics (1940). In between, Jones co-starred in the sound version of Rudolf Friml’s Rose Marie (1935) with Jeanette MacDonald and Nelson Eddy; the excellent Universal sound remake of Jerome Kern’s Show Boat (1936) opposite Irene Dunne, Paul Robeson and Helen Morgan, who recreated her Miss Julie; and one his best roles ever, opposite MacDonald again, in The Firefly (1937), directed by Robert Z. Leonard. Movie audiences got to hear Jones sing the number “Donkey Serenade,” which became closely identified with him throughout his career.\n\nHe continued to appear in countless musicals of the period, including The Great Victor Herbert (1939), the Rodgers & Hart production of The Boys from Syracuse (1940), Moonlight in Havana (1942), and various others.\n\nHe dropped out of sight after the war’s conclusion, only to resurface in the mid-sixties in two disappointing film duds: the humdrum Western Stage to Thunder Rock (1964), and the mediocre teen musical A Swingin’ Summer (1965).\n\nMajor Female Attractions\n\nThankfully, tenors were not the only talents to attain celebrity status on the screen. Women opera stars were also part of the vogue. Two of the best loved were the blonde Tennessee-born soprano Grace Moore, and the diminutive French singing sensation Lily Pons.\n\nMoore, too, began on Broadway; only later on did she migrate to the stage of the Metropolitan Opera before Hollywood beckoned. She made several pictures for MGM, where she was initially teamed with another budding young screen talent, the baritone Lawrence Tibbett, in a lavish version of New Moon (1930), set in pre-revolutionary Czarist Russia instead of the original eighteenth-century New Orleans.\n\nThe studio’s production head, wonder boy Irving Thalberg, became increasingly distressed over Moore’s expanding waste line, so he allowed her MGM contract to expire. This would not be the last time that august studio would get into a haggle over such a “weighty” issue (vide tenor Mario Lanza below).\n\nMoore was eventually picked up by Columbia Pictures where she went on to do her best work, even earning an Oscar nomination for her film, One Night of Love (1934). Her other features included Love Me Forever (1935) and I’ll Take Romance (1937). She was even invited to participate in Abel Gance’s film of Gustave Charpentier’s opera, Louise (1938), with the leading French tenor of the day, the thrilling Georges Thill. It was to be her last screen appearance. She perished in a plane crash over Denmark, in 1947, while on tour in Europe.\n\nDuring the height of Moore’s popularity and fame, RKO Pictures decided to tout the petite coloratura Lily Pons as their answer to the perky American. Unfortunately for RKO (and for Pons), her movie roles were mostly mediocre efforts. They included I Dream Too Much (1935), That Girl from Paris and Hitting a New High, both from 1937.\n\nPons was never able to captivate movie audiences with her acting as she had in the theater with her warbling. She made one more screen appearance, in the concert film Carnegie Hall (1947), singing Rachmaninoff’s Vocalise and the “Bell Song” from Delibes’ Lakmé, before calling it a night.\n\nIn France, the popularity of vivacious music hall actress and chanteuse Yvonne Printemps (née Wigniolle, near Paris) helped launch her European film career. She appeared in several beautifully mounted productions, many of which capitalized on her captivating stage charm and classically trained voice. A real find, for once!\n\nSome of her films were operatic in theme if not in substance; for example, La Dame aux Camélias (1934) based on Verdi’s La Traviata, and Adrienne Lecouvreur (1938) after Francesco Cilea’s opera Adriana Lecouvreur. Her other major successes included Les Trois Valses (1938) and La Valse de Paris (1948), a screen biography of famed Opéra-Comique composer, Jacques Offenbach (highly fictionalized, of course), co-starring her longtime lover, actor Pierre Fresnay (The Grand Illusion).\n\nThere’s a typically farcical scene onstage where Printemps sings the romantic ditty “Dites-lui,” from La Grande Duchesse de Gerolstein, directly at first to a Turkish caliph, then to the Russian czar and his son. The czar tosses a bouquet, which happens to land on the podium where Offenbach is conducting his work. Offenbach throws it onto the stage just in time for Printemps to snatch it up and blow kisses in the direction of the czar’s box. Charmante, charmante!\n\nDespite several return trips to the States, Printemps never achieved the kind of meteoric rise in North America as she had in France and Europe. She remained an attractive performer nonetheless, with an effervescent screen presence.\n\nLess successful was New Yorker Mary Ellis, who started at the top and worked her way down to the bottom. She debuted at the Metropolitan Opera, continuing on to the Broadway stage and eventually to Paramount Studios, where she made several unsuccessful attempts at challenging the reign of Grace Moore and Jeanette MacDonald.\n\nEllis left filmdom for England, where she continued to appear on the London stage, and on British television, for years thereafter. She died on January 30, 2003 at the ripe old age of 105 (no thanks to Hollywood).\n\nA Baritone Lover’s Delight\n\nA gifted actor and charismatic stage performer in his own right was the American baritone Lawrence Tibbett (the son of a San Francisco deputy sheriff, believe it or not), previously mentioned in connection with Grace Moore.\n\nSimilar to what had happened to the multi-talented Moore, Tibbett earned an Academy Award nomination as best actor in his very first film outing: The Rogue Song (1930), rather loosely based on Léhar’s operetta Gypsy Love. It was the first Technicolor talkie, and featured the comic duo of (wonder of wonders) Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy, with direction by stage and screen star Lionel Barrymore, a fanatical opera buff.\n\nFilm preservation being what it was, the work has been all-but lost. Outside of a few stills and a brutally savaged European cut, relatively little remains of Rogue Song to document Tibbett’s magnetic ability to hold an audience spellbound. Fortunately, he did leave numerous 78 rpm’s of songs, scenes and arias, voiced in that still-glorious golden timbre of his. A star of the first magnitude!\n\nTibbett’s other MGM output never matched his propitious screen debut. They include the aforementioned New Moon (1930), with colleague Grace Moore, The Prodigal and The Cuban Love Song, with Mexican spitfire Lupe Velez (both 1931), his last for the studio. His works for other studios included Metropolitan (1935) and Under Your Spell (1936).\n\nSadly diminished vocal resources, augmented by heavy drinking, led to later disillusionment with his singing career. Tibbett died in poverty in 1960 after a long battle with alcoholism — a tragic end to a superb artist.\n\nAnother great singing-actor of the stage, who gravitated more to the movies than to the operatic stage, was American bass-baritone Paul Robeson. His impeccable athletic skills (Rutgers University) and academic credentials (Columbia University Law School) should have guaranteed him a comfortable living, but did not because of his skin color and leftist-leaning attitudes.\n\nRobeson was popular in both Europe and New York, and made a few memorable appearances in the cinema. Among his best was an adaptation of Eugene O’Neill’s The Emperor Jones (1933), Sanders of the River (1935), Joe in Show Boat (his most famous role), King Solomon’s Mines (1937), and Tales of Manhattan (1942).\n\nThe song, “Ole Man River,” from the Jerome Kern-Oscar Hammerstein II work, became a theme of resistance for Robeson. He would sing the number at many of his concerts, often changing or adapting the lyrics to fit the times or the venue.\n\nRobeson became a political activist for social causes in the late thirties, and was involved in many domestic and international movements for peace, racial equality and better working conditions for the poor and oppressed. His liberal political stance and constant contacts with Communist Russia, however, earned him the enmity of the U.S. State Department.\n\nHe never appeared in opera, but his natural cello-like voice had the quality and resonance of a truly one-of-a-kind instrument. Robeson enjoyed working in films, and frequently said that it afforded him a more natural and relaxed way of singing, freeing him up from the worry of having to pump his voice up for volume in order to be heard.\n\nSome of his other films included Jericho (also known as Dark Sands, 1937) and The Proud Valley (1940). Robeson remains an enigmatic figure, full of unrealized potential. What a fabulous Sarastro in Mozart’s The Magic Flute or Mussorgsky’s Boris Godunov he would have made!\n\nEnchanted Evenings\n\nAlready at the end of an imposing operatic career, Italian basso Ezio Pinza made a huge splash on Broadway in 1949, alongside the ebullient Mary Martin, in the hit Rodgers & Hammerstein musical South Pacific. He also starred in Fanny in 1954, this time opposite Florence Henderson (The Brady Bunch).\n\nIn Pinza’s autobiography, he recalled the incredible difficulty he had in memorizing his lines (remember, he was a non-native English speaker) due to constant changes to the book by the producers and the other, more experienced cast members, a normal practice in the theater. As he was a completely self-taught artist incapable of reading music, Pinza suffered greatly as a result of his inability to keep up with the cast.\n\nThat issue aside, he helped to popularize South Pacific’s most romantic number “Some Enchanted Evening,” which completely revitalized his stage career. It also served as a springboard to a relatively brief dalliance with the silver screen.\n\nPinza was a casting director’s dream: he always managed to appear self-possessed as well as suave and sophisticated, a sort of elder Latin statesman with matinee-idol good looks, graying hair, and a wandering eye for the ladies — a personality not too far from his own.\n\nHis two major film contributions, Mr. Imperium with the platinum blonde Lana Turner, and Strictly Dishonorable (both 1951), were strictly minor affairs, while an earlier cameo role as himself, in Carnegie Hall (1947), was decidedly better, as was his later guest shot in Tonight We Sing (1953), the film biography of impresario Sol Hurok (David Wayne). In this one, he played the cantankerous Russian basso Feodor Chaliapin, albeit with a distinctly Italianate touch and accent.\n\nPinza’s untimely death in 1957 forced Twentieth Century-Fox to look for a senior singing actor of the same exalted caliber who could play Emile de Becque in director Joshua Logan’s film version of South Pacific (1958). The studio thought it had found the perfect type in romantic leading man Rossano Brazzi, who turned out to have the same chiseled features, mild Mediterranean temperament, and salt-and-pepper coif as the debonair Signor Pinza.\n\nDespite the ready-made appearance, it became aurally apparent that Brazzi couldn’t carry a tune, much to the producers’ chagrin. Whereby American-born Metropolitan Opera bass Giorgio Tozzi was hastily recruited to supply the actor’s singing voice. Why Tozzi, who was appearing opposite Mary Martin at the time — and in the same South Pacific musical – was not hired on-the-spot for the role remains an impenetrable mystery.\n\nEven more irksome to Tozzi was the fact that Rossano Brazzi later claimed to have actually sung most of his role, with only a few high notes doctored in for good measure. Nothing could be further from the truth.\n\nToast of Tinsel Town\n\nIt was in the late 1940s that Philadelphia-born Mario Lanza (real name Alfred Arnold Coccozza) came to the forefront as the reigning king of celluloid opera performers and reasserted the dominance of the tenor in motion pictures.\n\nVirtually all of his movie roles were variations on his own highly extroverted (and exceedingly volatile) screen personality, displayed to perfect “prima donna” perfection in MGM’s That Midnight Kiss (1949), wherein his role as a singing truck driver all-but guaranteed his success; and The Toast of New Orleans (1950), both with the long-suffering Kathryn Grayson.\n\nIn the aptly named Toast, the boorish Mr. Lanza has a grand old time as Grayson’s singing partner in the Act I finale to Madama Butterfly, which ends up as more of a wrestling match than a love duet. He shared many an off-screen temper tantrum with his leading lady; in fact, there was no love lost between these two artists.\n\nOther Lanza productions included Because You’re Mine (1952), with the opera-loving Sgt. James Whitmore singing an excerpt from Verdi’s Il Trovatore; The Student Prince (voice only/1954), Serenade (1956), The Seven Hills of Rome (1958), and For the First Time (1959).\n\nThe enormous girth that sprouted around Lanza’s waist, which he had brought to the studio prior to filming Sigmund Romberg’s The Student Prince (1954), resulted in his suspension from the production. Only his sterling vocals remain intact on the soundtrack, mouthed in uncomfortably stilted fashion by the stiff-as-a-board Edmund Purdom. Ann Blyth was his main love interest.\n\nBlyth previously co-starred with Lanza in The Great Caruso (1951), playing the part of his dutiful wife Dorothy. That film was noteworthy for its abundance of opera excerpts, in addition to being packed to the rafters with opera luminaries, among them sopranos Dorothy Kirsten and Jarmila Novotna, mezzo Blanche Thebom, baritone Giuseppe Valdengo, soprano Lucine Amara, basso Nicola Moscona, and coloratura Marina Koshetz, all of them regulars wi"
