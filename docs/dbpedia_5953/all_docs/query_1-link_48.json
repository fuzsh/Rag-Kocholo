        "text": "Understanding Opera\n\nOne of the most common things we hear from folks who are unfamiliar with opera is that they don't feel they understand it. We get that — how could a 200-year-old story performed entirely in a loudly-sung foreign language appeal to our modern pop-music sensibilities?\n\nArt is an expression of humanity\n\nSome of the most famous operas are many tens, even hundreds, of years old, but it was written by real people who lived rich, full lives and experienced the same range of human emotion we experience today, just in a different environment. The magic of opera is that it expresses what often goes unexpressed — the grand vastness of what we feel inside. Is it normal to sing a glorious ten-minute declaration of love while literally dying of consumption? No, but the actions of the character aren't the point, rather the expression of what the character is feeling is the true focus of the scene. If you were dying of consumption with the person you love most by your side, we'd gather that you would be feeling a desire to express that love more grandly than you could possibly describe in your weakened final breaths. Opera combines some of history's most eloquent text with the universal language of music to surpass physical reality and give us a glimpse into the inner world each of its characters' experiences, mirrored by our own complex lives as human beings. That was true at the time as it is true today, and what a cool thing it is to have something as intangible-yet-real as human emotion preserved for the ages, adapted in new ways, and offered the chance to be expressed to you.\n\nThe languages of opera\n\nOpera has been written in many languages, from English to French to German to Italian, Russian, Czech, even Klingon. The problem is, you may not speak English, French, German, Italian, Klingon... and while we believe the staging and music can communicate more than you might expect, we also want you to enjoy the experience as much as we do, and even we don't fluently speak every opera language!\n\nThis is why we do our best to help you enjoy your experience and minimize that barrier for you:\n\nReady To Test Your New Knowledge?"
