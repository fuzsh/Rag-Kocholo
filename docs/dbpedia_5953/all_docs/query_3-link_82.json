        "text": "Adaptation films are films that take a story from one medium and either adapt it to the screen or, in the case of film remakes, remake a new re-imagining of the film. There can be one or several adaptations of a single story.The transition between mediums often requires or benefits from major changes in plot, detail, or themes. One of the stories that has the most creative interpretations is the 1910 Gaston Leroux novel The Phantom of the Opera. Phantom is a particularly interesting example of the adaptation genre because its various film adaptations throughout the years have differed so wildly in story and theme. Although the character of the Phantom is an instantly recognizable icon in pop culture, very few people are familiar with any actual adaptations of the story besides the Andrew Lloyd Webber musical or perhaps the 1925 silent film with Lon Chaney. In this exhibit, I’d like to display how the same basic story can lend itself to incredibly varied final products based off of the needs of the genre that a particular adaptation belongs to or the audience that that film has to appease, specifically in regards to changes made in the plot and how the character of The Phantom is portrayed.\n\nI have chosen the six versions that I believe best represent the range of this story: the classic 1925 silent film, the 1943 version starring Claude Rains and Suzanna Foster, the 1974 film Phantom of the Paradise that is loosely based off of the Leroux novel, the 1987 cartoon version, 1989 version starring Robert Englund, and the 2004 film adaptation of the Andrew Lloyd Webber musical. These versions represent, respectively: silent horror films, the “Romantic” drama that is the basic form of the majority of film versions of Phantom, rock opera, cartoons, 80s slasher films, and musicals.\n\nComparing the differences in the plot requires a quick summary of the original book. The basic plot revolves around the Phantom, a man who calls himself Erik. He is a crazed musical genius who is deformed from birth and lives out his days hiding in the cellars of the Paris Opera house while “haunting” the theater above and extorting money out of the manager/s. He falls in love with the young singer Christine, and begins to give her voice lessons, posing as “the Angel of Music”/the ghost of her father. When Christine falls in love with the young Vicomte Raoul de Chagney, the Phantom is very unhappy. Meanwhile, Christine’s professional rival Carlotta is attempting to usurp Christine’s 15 minutes of fame, with the help of the two managers of the Opera. In an attempt to discourage the management from casting Carlotta in future roles, the Phantom crashes the Opera’s chandelier during a performance and kidnaps Christine, but she is released a few weeks later after the romantic trio-Raoul, Christine, and the Phantom, attend a masquerade with the young lovers dressed as black and white dominoes and the Phantom dressed as Red Death. Christine and Raoul get secretly engaged, unaware that the Phantom finds out about their plans to run away together. The night before this is to happen, Christine performs one last time at the Opera but is captured again by the Phantom. With the assistance of The Persian, an old acquaintance Erik, Raoul is led down to the cellars to find Christine. The men are captured and put into a mirrored torture chamber. The Phantom gives Christine a choice: she can turn a small scorpion statue to signify that she will marry the Phantom and everyone else will go free, or she can turn the grasshopper and blow up the entire opera house. Christine instead gives him a kiss, the first of his life. This show of kindness convinces the Phantom to let everyone including Christine go. Supposedly, the Phantom dies of a broken heart shortly after and is buried in the cellars.\n\nMost if not all versions contain the same basic elements: a masked man called the Phantom, a young singer that he has feelings for, the setting of the Opera House. Beyond that, there are some elements that are likely to be in versions but may not necessarily be in the majority of them: The Raoul character or any of the minor characters such as Carlotta or the managers are as likely to be there as not, and the chandelier crash or rooftop love scene is often omitted. Finally, there are many elements that are omitted from almost all if not every single one of the film adaptations, such as the character of the Persian or the scene with the grasshopper and the scorpion.\n\nOne of the elements that is always present in one form or another is the Phantom’s disfigurement. In the book, this is a deformity that Erik has from birth that essentially makes him look like a living corpse. This includes cracked yellow skin, a scarcity of hair, sunken yellow eyes, a gaunt face and body, and the absence of his nose and most of his lips.\n\nWhile the vast majority of the Phantoms do have a facial disfigurement, the severity and nature of this disfigurement ranges wildly. The skeleton-like appearance of the Phantom in the novel is practically impossible to emulate due to the restrictions of makeup and the human face as a template. Because of this, many versions change the deformity into a burn from fire or chemicals, which are much easier to recreate with makeup and allow the storyteller to add another facet to the character’s background. On top of this change in the nature of the disfigurement, very few versions have the deformity cover the entirety of the face due to the effect this has on audiences’ perception of the character and the performance of the actor.\n\n1925 Silent film starring Lon Chaney\n\n1943 version starring Claude Rains\n\n1974 film Phantom of the Paradise\n\n1988 cartoon version\n\n1989 version starring Robert Englund"
