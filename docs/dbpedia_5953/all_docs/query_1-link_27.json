Why or why not? What might have contributed to scholars\n\nmaking such a statement?\n\n3) How is film more accessible to a general audience? Is this positive or\n\nnegative? In what ways?\n\n4) What stereotypes are apparent in this film? In what ways, if any, does this film\n\nattempt to break out of stereotypes?\n\n5) Are there characters and/or scenes in this film that remind you of yourself or\n\nyour experiences? Why?\n\nAfter you've watched\n\n1) Which character in the film can you identify with the most? Why? Which\n\ncharacter in the film can you identify with the least? Why?\n\n2) In your opinion, does this film offer a realistic depiction of high school or\n\ncollege? Why or why not?\n\n3) In what ways is this film a reflection of its time? If the film is set before its\n\nrelease date, how is the time it was made reflected in the script?\n\n4) What specifically in the film makes this a \"coming of age\" movie? Could it fall\n\ninto another category? Can you create a category for this film?\n\n5) Do you believe this film promotes a positive or negative image of students?\n\nWhy?\n\n6) Imagine you were watching this film as your mother or father, and then answer\n\nthe following question: Does this film promote a positive or negative image of\n\nstudents? Why? Have your answers changed from the way you answered\n\nquestion 5? If so, speculate about the reasons.\n\nSome possibilities for writing"
