Subgenres should play a meaningful part in the overarching plot/setting/medium of the title -- more information on these available in our keywords guidelines.\n\nGenres are ordered alphabetically on IMDb. Short, Animation, Documentary genres are the only exceptions to this and will override the alphabetical display.\n\nGuidelines\n\nObjective vs Subjective\n\nObjective Genres are not influenced by personal feelings or opinions in considering and representing facts. Objective genres are hard coded to the set rules of our guidelines. Subjective Genres are common in most modern films and may be influenced by viewer opinions, interpretations, points of view, emotions, and judgement.\n\nGenre Definitions\n\nGenres for episodic series\n\nHow to\n\nLike most other types of information, Genres can be submitted to titles via the Edit page button at the bottom of the title page.\n\nTracking your contribution"
