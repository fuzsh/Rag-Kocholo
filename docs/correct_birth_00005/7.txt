20 Forthlin Road, Liverpool, Sir Paul McCartney’s childhood home, is considered by many to be the birthplace of the Beatles, where Paul and John Lennon wrote and rehearsed some of their earliest hits. The McCartneys moved there in 1955, and when the family moved out it was immediately redecorated to deter souvenir hunters.

When the Trust took on the house in 1995 they set about recreating the look and style from the time Paul and his family lived there - but downstairs in the living room there’s still one feature that curator Katie Taylor and house manager Michelle Yunque haven’t yet been able to restore: a key section of wallpaper. Luckily for Katie, she has a very good record of exactly what the paper looked like in the form of photos taken by a former resident - Paul’s younger brother, and photographer, Mike.

Meanwhile, in the smallest room in the house, the upstairs toilet, wall paintings conservator Tobit Curteis is starting an unusual assignment…

A few miles away in the centre of Liverpool, one of the Trust’s largest 20th century collections is under threat. 59 Rodney Street is a four-storey Georgian town house that was once the home and studio of one of Britain’s most significant photographers, Edward Chambré Hardman. Best known for his Liverpool cityscapes, Hardman’s day-to-day work was portraiture. He lived and worked in the house for over 40 years and left a vast collection of around 100,000 prints and negatives that need cataloguing and cleaning.
