        "text": "“ Whilst we weren't a poor family, we weren't rich by any means, so we never had a car, or a television till the coronation in 1953. I was the first one in the family to buy a car with my Beatle earnings. My mum, a nurse, road a bike. „ “ We used to have wanking sessions when we were young at Nigel Whalley's house in Woolton. We'd stay overnight and we'd all sit in armchairs and we'd put all the lights out and being teenage pubescent boys we'd all wank. What we used to do, someone would say, 'Brigitte Bardot.' 'Oooh!' that would keep everyone on par, then somebody, probably John, would say, 'Winston Churchill.' 'Oh no!' and it would completely ruin everyone's concentration. „"
