        "text": "The McCartney's childhood home will be home to music once again\n\nPaul McCartney's brother has shared how life in a Liverpool suburb helped shape the Beatles.\n\nPerformer and visual artist Mike McCartney grew up alongside brother Paul in 20 Forthlin Road, Liverpool- and the address has since become iconic. The 78-year-old explained how growing up on the terraced street helped lead to the formation of the famous quartet - with John Lennon and Paul McCartney penning some of the Beatles biggest hits in the home, such as ‘I Saw Her Standing There’ wrote in school books on the front room floor.\n\n‌\n\nThe McCartney family moved to the address in 1956, and shortly after, mum Mary died of breast cancer. In an interview with the ECHO, Mike explained how this event, and tough life on Forthlin Road helped shape his career, as well as that of brother Paul.\n\nREAD MORE: Paul McCartney shares his favourite Beatles song and it may not be what you expect\n\nHe said: \"It was a warm family home, not as warm as it would have been with a mum around. We lived here when he had no money and no hope- certainly hope in showbusiness.\"\n\n‌\n\nLiverpool Echo Icon\n\nSign up to FREE email alerts from ECHO Daily News\n\nWe use your sign-up to provide content in ways you’ve consented to and improve our understanding of you.

He shared this with his children as they grew up.\n\nMike added: \"Dad was poor, he had choices: to steal- but this would lead to prison, or to gamble, but he enjoyed playing music in the Jim Max band. When mum died it was hard but he always had thoughts of the band, he bought me a banjo and Paul a guitar- a Spanish guitar I called it, and we had a drum kit that fell off the back of a lorry.\"\n\n‌\n\nMike had ambitions of becoming a big musician himself, acting as a drummer in band The Quarrymen in their early days- but a hand injury in scout camp meant playing the drums was impossible. His career as a photographer soon took off- with his pictures going global, including being featured in the Smithsonian in Washington D.C.\n\nMike said: \"We slowly evolved out of nothing, I had art in huge places, and my brother Paul didn't do too badly for himself.\"\n\n20 Forthlin Road is set to come alive with music once again as The National Trust, who have owned the building since 1992, will work with Mike and Pete Paphides to help scout unsigned musical talent as part of the 'Forthlin Sessions'.\n\n‌\n\nHilary McGrady, National Trust Director General, said: “What the Beatles did was inspire a generation to feel free to be creative, regardless of who or where they were. Much of that started at 20 Forthlin Road with the songs that were written under this roof.\n\n\"It’s a pleasure to care for the Beatles’ childhood homes and to use the story of what happened there to continue this legacy. Our places don’t have to be stuck in time; they’re here to keep sparking creativity, dreams, and new ideas. We can’t wait to hear how what happened at 20 Forthlin Road inspired and keeps on inspiring the nation”.\n\nTo find out more about 20 Forthlin Road, how to apply to play at ‘The Forthlin Sessions’ or how to share what the creativity sparked there has meant to you, please visit www.nationaltrust.org.uk/features/bringing-live-music-back-to-the-birthplace-of-the-beatles or @nationaltrust #TheForthlinSessions.\n\n‌\n\nREAD MORE: George Harrison's childhood home turned into Airbnb for Beatles fans"
