        "text": "Are you the kind of person that gets seriously inspired by your surroundings? Well, places don’t get more inspiring than this. Paul McCartney’s childhood home in Liverpool is opening up as a space for budding musicians to write and perform.\n\nThe former Beatle grew up at 20 Forthlin Road in Liverpool, a Grade II-listed house now owned by the National Trust. It was at Forthlin that Macca and John Lennon forged their legendary songwriting partnership, writing hits like ‘Love Me Do’, ‘I Saw Her Standing There’ and ‘When I’m Sixty-Four’.\n\nThe initiative is called the Forthlin Sessions, and it’ll see the address opened up for unsigned artists for one day only. It’s backed by Paul’s brother Mike McCartney, who also grew up in the house and who will have some say over which artists get to use the space.\n\nThe sessions will take place on June 17, but the opportunity goes beyond simply the chance to write and perform at Forthlin. Performances will also be broadcast on the National Trust’s YouTube accounts, and selected musicians will also receive a free six-month mentoring course from the Liverpool Institute for Performing Arts (which was co-founded by Macca).\n\nIf you’re interested in getting involved, you can find out more on the official website. Applications close on April 30.\n\nAlternatively, if you’re interested in visiting 20 Forthlin Road but aren’t a musician, the National Trust organises combined tours of the house and John Lennon’s childhood home (251 Menlove Avenue). Find out more about those here."
