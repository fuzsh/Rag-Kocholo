        "text": "Background\n\nSir Paul McCartney was born in Liverpool to a middle-class family. His father, James McCartney, was a volunteer firefighter during World War II, and military service made him miss McCartney’s birth. After the war, his father worked as a salesman for the cotton merchants A.Hannay and Co. Mary Patricia, McCartney’s mother, worked as a nurse. His siblings are Peter and Ruth. McCartney attended Stockton Wood Road Primary School for two years (1947 to 1949) till it became overcrowded. He then transferred to Joseph Williams Junior School and finished at Liverpool Institute.\n\nWhen McCartney was 14, his father gifted him a trumpet, which he later traded for an acoustic guitar. McCartney wrote his first song, ‘I Lost My Little Girl,’ after his father advised him to become a musician. The next year, McCartney met John Lennon and his band ― The Quarrymen. Soon after, Lennon appreciated McCartney’s talent and invited him to join the band.\n\nBy 1960, they had tried different names before settling for The Beatles in August. In 1961, the band recorded professionally for the first time and caught Brian Epstein’s attention. Epstein became their manager and largely contributed to the group’s success. Lennon left the group in 1969. McCartney left in 1970 and filed a suit to dissolve the band. The band was legally dissolved on January 9, 1975, and members decided to pursue solo careers."
