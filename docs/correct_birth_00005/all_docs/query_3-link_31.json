        "text": "As it is the 70th anniversary of VE Day I thought I would write a piece about the impact being born during World War Two may (or may not have) had on John, Paul, George and Ringo. There are brief references to this at the beginning of the Anthology TV series and ‘Living in the Material World’. The inspiration for writing this post was firstly the photo of two year old George at the VE Day party on Arnold Grove and secondly a recent re-viewing of the excellent ‘World at War’ series.\n\nFirstly to say that this post owes a massive debt to Mark Lewisohn and his magnificent ‘All the year – Tune in’ where I found all the information this post is based on.\n\nThe first question to ask is ‘What did you do in the war Daddy?’. Lewisohn points out that Alf Lennon (Merchant Sea Man), Harry Harrison (Bus conductor) and Richard Starkey (cake maker) were not drafted into the British Army as they were in reserved occupations and that James McCartney was not drafted because his hearing issues. However James McCartney served as a fire watcher and fire man during the war (which was a highly hazardous job) and Lewisohn believes Harry Harrison may have served with the Home Guard.\n\nAs a Merchant Sea Man, Alf Lennon may have very well served on the mainly perilous Atlantic Convoys that brought supplies from the USA to Britain. Around 32,000 merchant sea farers from Britain were killed during World War Two, a mortality rate of one in three.\n\nBoth Ringo and John were conceived during the period of what is termed ‘The Phoney War;’ (September 1939-May 1940 – although the people of Finland and Norway would have disagreed!) before Britain came under direct attack from Nazi Germany. However the time of Ringo’s birth on 7 July 1940, France had fallen and Britain expected to be invaded any day. The proposed German land invasion ( ‘Operation Sea- Lion’) never came due to Britain establishing control over its airspace during the ‘Battle of Britain’ (July-October 1940), but German bombings of British cities (The Blitz) began in later August 1940. As a major port, Liverpool was a major target for German bombers and indeed it was the second most bombed place in the UK after London during the Blitz. You can read further details here.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_Blitz\n\nLewisohn gives the date of the first air raid on Liverpool as August 17, 1940, and relates a story about Ringo and this first air raid. Apparently in the confusion of this first raid, Elsie Starkey failed to notice that when she had taken shelter, she was holding baby Richard upside down! Ringo relates a jokey comment Elsie made in the Anthology series and book that because he was born World War Two began. While obviously affectionately meant it reveals the fraught and perilous days Ringo was born into, when the reality of the war and what it would entail hit the British people. Ringo notes in the ‘Anthology’ book that Dingle, the area where he grew up in, was a particular target for bombing. This was due to it’s location near the Liverpool docks.\n\nBy the time John was born on 9 October 1940, Liverpool had been sustained heavy bombing for almost two months, and would continue to be so until May 1941. Lewisohn in the course of researching ‘’All the years- Tune in’ discovered that John had not in fact been born during an air raid (as legend would have it). But this legend tells a truth that John was born during a very dark hour for the people of Liverpool. Indeed, of all the Beatles, World War Two would have the deepest impact on John (more of which anon). And of course he got his middle name from Winston Churchill.\n\nHowever it was an air raid that may have brought James McCartney and Mary Mohin together. Lewisohn points out that James and Mary knew each other, but it was not until they were required to take shelter together during an air raid while Mary was visiting Florrie McCartney (James mother and Paul’s grandmother) that their courtship took off, and the atmosphere of the war may have sealed the deal. James and Mary were married on 15 April 1941. Lewisohn also points out that James lost his job at the Liverpool Cotton Exchange in early 1941 when the UK cotton trade was nationalised (as many industries were during the war). He found work at Napier’s Engineering Works, which produced munitions. James would return to the cotton trade after the war. The air raids on Liverpool diminished after May 1941 as Germany turned its attention to attacking the USSR, and the last air raid on Liverpool was on 10 January 1942. Lewisohn points out that by late 1941 the air raids had died down enough for James and Mary felt able to start a family, with Paul being born on 18 June 1942, and Michael McCartney being born in January 1944.\n\nLewisohn reports that the Harrison children (I assume these were Louise and Harry as Peter was still a baby) were evacuated to North Wales during the Liverpool blitz but were back at 12 Arnold Grove by 24/25 February 1943. Most of the explanations for why there is confusion as to the exact date and time of George’s birth involve war time keeping and the war time blackout conditions. Thanks to Andrea at thateventuality for this!\n\nThe war would not just bring couples such as James and Mary McCartney together, it would also divide couples like Julia and Alf Lennon as well. The Lennon’s marriage would not survive the war. In the aftermath of the collapse of the Lennon’s marriage, John would go to live with his aunt Mini and uncle George Smith.\n\nThe war in Europe ended on 8 May 1945, with Liverpool joining in the celebrations. John and Ringo were both four years old and Paul and George were both two years old. Lewisohn gives an account of young Ringo and George attending V.E. Day parties. George actually recalls attending this party in the ‘Anthology’ book (although he does not say it was a V.E. Day party) and describes the photo of himself at the party that appears at the beginning of ‘Living in the Material World’ and in the ‘George Harrison : Living in the Material World’ book.\n\nDue to their young age John, Paul, George and Ringo would not have any real memories of the war -Ringo confirms he has no memories of the war in the Anthology book. However they would have grown up with the reality of the war around them. They certainly grew up with the post war austerity and rationing- food rationing only ended in the UK in 1954. The musician (and cheese producer!) Alex James put forward the theory in a 2011 interview that George was thin because of the effects of being a child during food rationing\n\nhttp://www.newstatesman.com/music/2011/06/interview-food-cheese-nice\n\nThe National Health Service was founded in 1946, and a young Richard Starkey would need it services almost immediately, falling dangerously ill with peritonitis in 1947, and later requiring an extended period of care for tuberculous in his teens.\n\nAll four Beatles would grow up in a city which had a large amount of war damage, with bombed out building remaining part of the city for many years after the war. There is a photo in the Anthology book of George playing on a bomb site as a child. As an example, St Lukes’s, a church in central Liverpool was bombed out during the war remains in the same condition as it was when it was bombed on 6 May 1941. (As an aside I had a couple of great nights there watching ‘A hard’s day’s night’ and ‘Yellow submarine’ a couple of years ago).\n\nhttp://www.stlukeliverpool.co.uk/\n\nAll four Beatles would have grown up around veterans of the war with stories of what happened. and George recalls in ‘I, me, mine’ that many of his teachers at the Liverpool Institute were war veterans who may have not been best qualified for teaching. This along with the culture of post war militarism (there was still conscription in the UK in the 1950’s with compulsory military service which Lewisohn notes the Beatles just about escaped having to do) alienated him from the education system. Indeed all four Beatles latched onto Rock and Roll as it offered glamour, rebellion, and a youthful, different outlook on the world, providing an alternative to the conservative, staid culture of post war Britain.\n\nBut the story does not end there. The city of Hamburg would play a vital role in the Beatles story. Hamburg underwent major bombing over several days and nights in July-August 1943 (Operation Gommorrah) amongst other allied bombing raids. It is estimated 40,000 people died in Hamburg during this bombing campaign. It is important to remember that when the Beatles arrived in Hamburg it was only 15 years since the end of World War 2. If you think that is just under 15 years since the September 11 attacks this gives you an idea of how little time had passed after the end of the war when the Beatles arrived in Hamburg.\n\nBut the Beatles quickly became friends with three Germans- Klaus Voormann, Astrid Kirchherr and Jürgen Vollmer. All three had an interest in French culture, obviously as a reaction to Germany’s recent past. However when they encountered the Beatles they were immediately won over by their energy and music. The friendships (which would be life long) testify that in both Britain and Germany the younger generation wanted to build a new more warmer relationship between the countries and move away from the past and not havae preconceptions about each other. Indeed, as we know love bloomed between Stuart and Astrid\n\nHowever, some in Britain were still determined to hold on to past resentments. Mark Lewisohn gives a heartbreaking account of the appalling treatment Astrid Kirrcher received at the hands of Stuart Sutcliffe’s family, particularly his mother Millie after Stuart’s death just because she is German in ‘All the years- Tune in’.\n\nThere is one member of the Beatles immediate circle who is a World War Two veteran. This is of course George Martin who served in the Royal Navy between 1943-1947 although he did not see combat\n\nBut of course there would be one legacy of World War Two that would be life changing for the Beatles. It would be the children of the post war ‘Baby Boom’ who would provide them with a fan base of millions."
