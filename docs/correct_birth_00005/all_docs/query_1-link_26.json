        "text": "Where did Paul McCartney grow up?\n\nHe was born James Paul McCartney on June 18, 1942 in Walton Hospital, Liverpool.\n\nThe hospital was where his mother, Mary Patricia, was practising as a nurse. His father, James 'Jim' McCartney, was absent from his son's birth, due to his work as a volunteer firefighter during World War II.\n\nHe also has one younger brother named Michael, and a stepsister, Ruth.\n\nHe was baptised in their mother's Catholic faith, despite their father being a former Protestant, who had turned agnostic.\n\nPaul McCartney went to Stockton Wood Road Primary School in Speke from 1947 to 1949, when he transferred to Joseph Williams Junior School in Belle Vale.\n\nIn 1953, with only three others out of 90, Paul passed the 11-Plus exam, meaning he then went to the Liverpool Institute, a grammar school.\n\nA year later, he met schoolmate George Harrison on the bus, and they quickly became friends.\n\nWhen he was 14, his mother died of an embolism. This helped his later connection with John Lennon, whose mother Julia, had died when he was 17.\n\nHow did Paul McCartney get into music?\n\nPaul McCartney's father was a trumpet player and pianist, and kept an upright piano in the family's front room. He encouraged his sons to also be musical.\n\nHe received a trumpet from his father for his 14th birthday, but he later traded it for a £15 Framus Zenith acoustic guitar. He found it tricky to play guitar right-handed, but after noticing a poster of Slim Whitman and realising that he played left-handed, he reversed the order of his strings.\n\nHe wrote his first song, 'I Lost My Little Girl', on that guitar, and composed another tune that would later become 'When I'm Sixty-Four' on the piano.\n\n'Long Tall Sally' was the first song McCartney performed in public, at a Butlin's talent competition.\n\nWhen did he join The Beatles?\n\nAged 15 in July 1957, McCartney met John Lennon and his band, the Quarrymen, at the St Peter's Church Hall fête in Woolton.\n\nThe Quarrymen mostly rock and roll and skiffle music. McCartney was soon asked to join as a rhythm guitarist.\n\nGeorge Harrison joined in 1958 as lead guitarist, followed by Lennon's school friend Stuart Sutcliffe on bass, in 1960.\n\nAfter trying several names, they chose The Beatles in August 1960, and signed drummer Pete Best before a residency in Hamburg, Germany.\n\nWithin a few years, and with the arrival of Ringo Starr, the Fab Four quickly became the biggest stars on the planet, selling over 800 million records worldwide.\n\nWhen did he create Wings?\n\nPaul McCartney & WINGS - Live And Let Die\n\nAfter the Beatles broke up in 1970, he released a self-titled solo album.\n\nA year later, he collaborated with wife Linda and drummer Denny Seiwell on a second album, Ram.\n\nEx-Moody Blues guitarist Denny Laine then joined the McCartneys and Seiwell to form the band Wings.\n\nMcCartney later said: \"Wings were always a difficult idea. Any group having to follow [the Beatles] success would have a hard job. I found myself in that very position. However, it was a choice between going on or finishing, and I loved music too much to think of stopping.\"\n\nWhat are his biggest solo songs?\n\nPaul McCartney - Maybe I'm Amazed\n\nAmong Sir Paul McCartney's most famous solo songs (not counting Wings) include:\n\n- Maybe I'm Amazed\n\n- Wonderful Christmastime\n\n- Waterfalls\n\n- Ebony and Ivory (with Stevie Wonder)\n\n- The Girl is Mine (with Michael Jackson)\n\n- Say Say Say (with Michael Jackson)\n\n- We All Stand Together\n\n- Pipes of Peace\n\nWhat is Paul McCartney's net worth?\n\nSir Paul McCartney is one of the wealthiest musicians in the world, with an estimated net worth of $1.2 billion.\n\nAs well as his interest in Apple Corps and MPL Communications, he owns a large music publishing catalogue, with access to over 25,000 copyrights, such as the rights to the musicals Guys and Dolls, A Chorus Line, Annie and Grease.\n\nWho has Paul McCartney been married to and how many children does he have?\n\nSir Paul first married Linda Eastman, a photographer for several rock groups. Despite first liking John, she quickly realised she preferred Paul.\n\nThey first met in 1967 at a Georgie Fame concert at The Bag O'Nails club. Paul later said: \"The night Linda and I met, I spotted her across a crowded club, and although I would normally have been nervous chatting her up, I realised I had to. Pushiness worked for me that night!\"\n\nThe couple married in 1969, and they had four children together: Linda's daughter Heather (legally adopted by Paul), Mary, Stella and James.\n\nThey stayed married until Linda's death from breast cancer aged 56 in 1998.\n\nIn 2002, McCartney married Heather Mills, a former model and anti-landmines campaigner. They had a child, Beatrice Milly. They split in 2006, and divorced in 2008.\n\nHe then married New York-based Nancy Shevell in a civil ceremony in London in October 2011. The couple had been together since November 2007. She is vice-president of a transportation conglomerate which owns New England Motor Freight."
