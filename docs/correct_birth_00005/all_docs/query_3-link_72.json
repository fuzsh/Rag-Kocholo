        "text": "Paul McCartney refuses to “Let It Be.”\n\nIn June, the 82-year-old former Beatle announced he’s adding another leg to his ongoing ‘Got Back Tour’ that started in the U.S. back in spring 2022.\n\nThis time around, the Rock and Roll Hall of Famer will perform at huge venues in South America and Europe.\n\nGiven his advanced age, it should be a no-brainer that these concerts are an absolute must for any Beatles fan who has seen Macca live on their bucket list.\n\nSurprisingly though, you won’t have to “give all your money” in order to catch Sir Paul live this year.\n\nAt the time of publication, our team found some tickets going for as low as $87 USD before fees on Vivid Seats for a show in Sao Paulo, Brazil.\n\nOther shows with seats available online can be found for just $89 before fees.\n\nWant to plan a trip to “Get Back” with Paul?\n\nWe’ve got everything you need to know and more about the upcoming international leg of Paul McCartney’s ‘Got Back Tour’ below.\n\nAll prices listed above are subject to fluctuation.\n\nPaul McCartney tour schedule 2024\n\nA complete calendar including all upcoming tour dates, venues, and links to the cheapest tickets available can be found here:\n\n(Note: The New York Post confirmed all above prices at the publication time. All prices are in US dollars, subject to fluctuation and, if it isn’t noted, will include additional fees at checkout.)\n\nVivid Seats is a verified secondary market ticketing platform, and prices may be higher or lower than face value, depending on demand.\n\nThey offer a 100% buyer guarantee that states your transaction will be safe and secure and your tickets will be delivered prior to the event.\n\nNeed to know more about Vivid Seats? You can find an article from their team about why the company is legit here.\n\nRingo Starr tour\n\nMacca isn’t the only Fab Four member on the road this year.\n\nFellow former Beatle Ringo Starr is also pounding the pavement once again. The only difference is Ringo is taking his All Starr Band to venues all over the U.S. instead of overseas.\n\nIf you want to see him live, you can find his complete 2024 tour schedule below.\n\nPaul McCartney set list\n\nThe last McCartney’s ‘Got Back Tour’ gig took place back in December 2023.\n\nAnd, although he’s getting up there in years, he’s showing no signs of slowing down when it comes to his live shows. In fact, at one Brazil show, he performed a whopping 36 songs.\n\nFor a closer look, here’s what Paul took to the stage that evening in Rio de Janeiro, courtesy of Set List FM:\n\n01.) “Can’t Buy Me Love” (The Beatles song)\n\n02.) “Junior’s Farm” (Wings song)\n\n03.) “Letting Go” (Wings song)\n\n04.) “She’s a Woman” (The Beatles song)\n\n05.) “Got to Get You Into My Life” (The Beatles song)\n\n06.) “Come On to Me”\n\n07.) “Let Me Roll It” (Wings song)\n\n08.) “Getting Better” (The Beatles song)\n\n09.) “Let ‘Em In” (Wings song)\n\n10.) “Nineteen Hundred and Eighty-Five” (Wings song)\n\n11.) “Maybe I’m Amazed”\n\n12.) “My Valentine”\n\n13.) “I’ve Just Seen a Face” (The Beatles song)\n\n14.) “In Spite of All the Danger” (The Quarrymen song)\n\n15.) “Love Me Do” (The Beatles song)\n\n16.) “Dance Tonight”\n\n17.) “Blackbird” (The Beatles song)\n\n18.) “Here Today”\n\n19.) “New”\n\n20.) “Lady Madonna” (The Beatles song)\n\n21.) “Jet” (Wings song)\n\n22.) “Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite!” (The Beatles song)\n\n23.) “Something” (The Beatles song) (Dedicated to George Harrison)\n\n24.) “Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da” (The Beatles song)\n\n25.) “Band on the Run” (Wings song)\n\n26.) “Get Back” (The Beatles song)\n\n27.) “Let It Be” (The Beatles song)\n\n28.) “Live and Let Die” (Wings song)\n\n29.) “Hey Jude” (The Beatles song)\n\nEncore\n\n30.) “I’ve Got a Feeling” (The Beatles song)\n\n31.) “Birthday” (The Beatles song)\n\n32.) “Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band (Reprise)” (The Beatles song)\n\n33.) “Helter Skelter” (The Beatles song)\n\n34.) “Golden Slumbers” (The Beatles song)\n\n35.) “Carry That Weight” (The Beatles song)\n\n36.) “The End” (The Beatles song)\n\nPaul McCartney new music\n\nIn addition to the tour announcement, McCartney just dropped the long lost 1974 b-sides and rarities album “One Hand Clapping” featuring unheard versions of Wings classics like “Jet” and “Maybe I’m Amazed” as well as a few goofy re-imaginings of Beatles tunes “Let It Be” and “The Long And Winding Road.”\n\nPitchfork claimed the sprawling album “is the photo-negative counterpart to ‘Get Back’: Instead of capturing the casual genius of pulling future classics out of thin air, it showcases McCartney’s willingness to rough up and rearrange his songbook.”\n\nClassic rockers on tour in 2024\n\nMany AARP card-carrying icons will take the stage this year and next.\n\nHere are just five of our favorite acts you won’t want to miss live in the near future.\n\n• Aerosmith\n\n• Peter Frampton\n\n• Bob Dylan with Robert Plant and Willie Nelson\n\n• Electric Light Orchestra\n\n• Justin Hayward of The Moody Blues\n\nNeed more ’60s and ’70s hitmakers in your life?
