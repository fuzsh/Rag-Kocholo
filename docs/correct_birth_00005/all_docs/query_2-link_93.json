        "text": "Born in Liverpool in 1942, Paul McCartney was raised in the city and educated at the Liverpool Institute. Since writing his first song at 14, McCartney has dreamed and dared to be different. He now lives in England.\n\nPaul’s output has been impossibly prolific and singularly influential crossing many different genres. Paul changed the world forever with The Beatles before going on to continue to push boundaries and make music history with his group Wings and as a solo artist. His most recent solo (and 18th) studio album McCartney III secured the UK Album Chart’s festive Number 1 spot in 2020, furthering his lead as the UK’s most successful album act of all time.\n\nIn November 2021 Paul released his book, THE LYRICS: 1956 to the Present, recounting his life and art through the prism of 154 songs from all stages of his career – from his earliest boyhood compositions through the legendary decade of The Beatles, to Wings and his solo albums to the present. The LYRICS hit Number One on the New York Times Best Seller list, and was named the 2021 Book Of The Year by Barnes & Noble.\n\nAn 18-time Grammy winner and recipient of The Recording Academy’s Lifetime Achievement and Trustees Awards, McCartney’s list of international accolades reads like no other as well as being recognised for decades of philanthropic activities.\n\nEqually renowned for his live performances as he is for his song-writing Paul set the world record for largest paying concert attendance – 184,000 people – in Rio De Janerio in 1990. A freeman of The City Of Liverpool and Lead Patron of The Liverpool Institute Of Performing Arts, Paul McCartney was appointed Fellow of The Royal College of Music in 1995 by The Prince Of Wales. In 1996 Paul McCartney was knighted by H.M. The Queen for his services to music, and in 2017 he was made a Companion Of Honour in the Queen’s Birthday Honours list."
