        "text": "Paul McCartney\n\nFull Name: James Paul McCartney\n\nProfession: Musician and Beatle\n\nBiography: McCartney grew up in Liverpool, and was introduced to future song-writing partner John Lennon aged 15 by mutual friend Ivan Vaughan. McCartney joined Lennon's skiffle band, the Quarrymen.\n\nAfter several personnel changes, the group became a quartet, with McCartney switching to bass guitar, sharing vocal duties. Renamed the Beatles in 1960, they had their first hit 'Love Me Do' in 1963. The group went on to dominate 1960s pop music worldwide. Lennon-McCartney was the agreed upon songwriting credit, although after some years they began writing songs without each other.\n\nIn addition to the bass, Paul also sometimes played guitar, piano, and drums on recordings.\n\nMcCartney was the first to publicly announce his split from the group in 1970, (although Lennon had already privately done so). He went on to form the band Wings in the 1970s, which include his wife Linda. The group toured extensively and had many hit records, Their most popular album was \"Band On The Run\".\n\nA prolific songwriter, McCartney has released the most solo material of any of the Beatles. His range of work, although primarily pop-rock, (26 studio albums and 9 live sets to date) also includes avant-garde musique concrète, film soundtracks, and classical music (including orchestral works, oratorios, and a ballet score). He continues to actively record and tour.\n\nMcCartney has written or co-written 32 songs #1 songs, and sold over 25 million records. Including work with and without the Beatles, he has won 18 Grammy Awards and an Academy Award. He is a two-time inductee of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame (in 1988, with the Beatles, and in 1999 as a solo performer). He was granted a British knighthood in 1997 for services to music.\n\nOutside of music, he has occasionally acted, painted, and written children's books.
