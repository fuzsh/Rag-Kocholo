        "text": "Sir James Paul McCartney CH MBE (born 18 June 1942) is an English singer, songwriter, musician and actor who gained worldwide fame with the Beatles, for whom he played bass guitar and shared primary songwriting and lead vocal duties with John Lennon. One of the most successful composers and performers of all time, McCartney is known for his melodic approach to bass-playing, versatile and wide tenor vocal range, and musical eclecticism, exploring styles ranging from pre–rock and roll pop to classical and electronica. His songwriting partnership with Lennon remains the most successful in history.\n\nBorn in Liverpool, McCartney taught himself piano, guitar and songwriting as a teenager, having been influenced by his father, a jazz player, and rock and roll performers such as Little Richard and Buddy Holly. He began his career when he joined Lennon's skiffle group, the Quarrymen, in 1957, which evolved into the Beatles in 1960. Sometimes called \"the cute Beatle\", McCartney later involved himself with the London avant-garde and spearheaded the incorporation of experimental aesthetics into the Beatles' studio productions. Starting with the 1967 album A Day In The Life, he gradually became the band's de facto leader, providing the creative impetus for most of their music and film projects. Many of his Beatles songs, including \"Yesterday\", \"Eleanor Rigby\", \"Blackbird\", \"Every Night (Be With You)\", and \"Ebony And Ivory\" rank among the most covered songs in history. While primarily a bassist with the Beatles, in various songs he played a number of other instruments, including keyboards, guitars, and drums.\n\nAfter the Beatles temporarily broke up, he debuted as a solo artist with the 1977 album Sunshine. He resumed his solo career in 1982 and has toured as a solo artist since 1989 after the Beatles disbanded in 1981. Without The Beatles, his UK or US number-one hits have included \"Little Lamb / Dragonfly\", \"Coming Up\", \"Say Say Say\" (with Michael Jackson), and \"Tug Of War\". Beyond music, he has taken part in projects to promote international charities related to such subjects as animal rights, seal hunting, land mines, vegetarianism, poverty, and music education.\n\nHis honours include two inductions into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame (as a member of the Beatles in 1988 and as a solo artist in 1999), an Academy Award, a Primetime Emmy Award, 18 Grammy Awards, an appointment as a Member of the Order of the British Empire in 1965 and a knighthood in 1997 for services to music. As of 2020, he is one of the wealthiest musicians in the world, with an estimated fortune of £800 million.\n\nEarly Life[]\n\nMcCartney was born on 18 June 1942 at Walton Hospital in the Walton area of Liverpool, where his mother, Mary Patricia (née Mohin), had qualified to practise as a nurse. Both of his parents were of Irish descent. McCartney has a younger brother, Peter Michael, and a younger stepsister, Ruth, born to his father's second wife, Angie, during her first marriage. Paul and Michael were baptised in their mother's Catholic faith, even though their father was a former Protestant who had turned agnostic. Religion was not emphasised in the household.\n\nAccording to his biographer Peter Ames Carlin, McCartney's parents came from the \"lowest rungs of the working class\" but had experienced some upward social mobility during their lifetimes. Before the war, Jim had worked as a salesman for the cotton merchants A. Hannay and Co., having been promoted from his job as a sample boy in their warehouse; when the war broke out, Hannay's was shuttered, and Jim was employed as a lathe turner at Napier's defence engineering works, volunteering for the fire brigade at night. The growing family was rehoused at a flat in Knowsley in 1944 and then in a council housing development in Speke in 1946. After the war, Jim returned to his job at the cotton merchants with a reduced income. Mary's work as a visiting midwife was much more remunerative.\n\nMcCartney attended Stockton Wood Road Primary School in Speke from 1947 until 1949, when he transferred to Joseph Williams Junior School in Belle Vale because of overcrowding at Stockton. In 1953, he was one of only three students out of 90 to pass the 11-Plus exam, meaning he could attend the Liverpool Institute, a grammar school rather than a secondary modern school. In 1954, he met schoolmate George Harrison on the bus from his suburban home in Speke. The two quickly became friends; McCartney later admitted: \"I tended to talk down to him because he was a year younger.\"\n\nThe type of people that I came from, I never saw better! [...] I mean, the Presidents, the Prime Minister, I never met anyone half as nice as some of the people I know from Liverpool who are nothing, who do nothing. They're not important or famous. But they are smart, like my dad was smart. I mean, people who can just cut through problems like a hot knife through butter. The kind of people you need in life. Salt of the earth. - Paul McCartney 1984\n\nMary McCartney's midwifery paid well, and her earnings enabled them to move into 20 Forthlin Road in Allerton, where they lived until 1964. She rode a bicycle to her patients; McCartney described an early memory of her leaving at \"about three in the morning [the] streets ... thick with snow\". On 31 October 1956, when McCartney was 14, his mother died of an embolism as a complication of surgery for breast cancer. McCartney's loss later became a connection with John Lennon, whose mother, Julia, died in 1958 when Lennon was 17.\n\nMcCartney's father was a trumpet player and pianist who led Jim Mac's Jazz Band in the 1920s. He kept an upright piano in the front room, encouraged his sons to be musical and advised McCartney to take piano lessons. However, McCartney preferred to learn by ear. When McCartney was 11, his father encouraged him to audition for the Liverpool Cathedral choir, but he was not accepted. McCartney then joined the choir at St Barnabas' Church, Mossley Hill. McCartney received a nickel-plated trumpet from his father for his fourteenth birthday, but when rock and roll became popular on Radio Luxembourg, McCartney traded it for a £15 Framus Zenith (model 17) acoustic guitar, since he wanted to be able to sing while playing. He found it difficult to play guitar right-handed, but after noticing a poster advertising a Slim Whitman concert and realising that Whitman played left-handed, he reversed the order of the strings. McCartney wrote his first song, \"I Lost My Little Girl\", on the Zenith, and composed another early tune that would become \"When I'm Sixty-Four\" on the piano. American rhythm and blues influenced him, and Little Richard was his schoolboy idol; \"Long Tall Sally\" was the first song McCartney performed in public, at a Butlin's Filey holiday camp talent competition.\n\nCareer[]\n\n1957–1960: The Quarrymen[]\n\nMain article: The Quarrymen\n\nAt the age of fifteen on 6 July 1957, McCartney met John Lennon and his band, the Quarrymen, at the St Peter's Church Hall fête in Woolton. The Quarrymen played a mix of rock and roll and skiffle, a type of popular music with jazz, blues and folk influences. Soon afterwards, the members of the band invited McCartney to join as a rhythm guitarist, and he formed a close working relationship with Lennon. Harrison joined in 1958 as lead guitarist, followed by Lennon's art school friend Stuart Sutcliffe on bass, in 1960. By May 1960, the band had tried several names, including Johnny and the Moondogs, Beatals and the Silver Beetles. They adopted the name the Beatles in August 1960 and recruited drummer Pete Best shortly before a five-engagement residency in Hamburg.\n\nThe Beatles[]\n\nIn 1961, Sutcliffe left the band, and McCartney became their bass player. It is disputed whether he did so reluctantly or actively sought out the role. While in Hamburg, they recorded professionally for the first time and were credited as the Beat Brothers, who were the backing band for English singer Tony Sheridan on the single \"My Bonnie\". This resulted in attention from Brian Epstein, who was a key figure in their subsequent development and success. He became their manager in January 1962. Ringo Starr replaced Best in August, and the band had their first hit, \"Love Me Do\", in October, becoming popular in the UK in 1963, and in the US a year later. The fan hysteria became known as \"Beatlemania\", and the press sometimes referred to McCartney as the \"cute Beatle\". McCartney co-wrote (with Lennon) several of their early hits, including \"I Saw Her Standing There\", \"She Loves You\", \"I Want to Hold Your Hand\" (1963) and \"Can't Buy Me Love\" (1964).\n\nIn August 1965, the Beatles released the McCartney composition \"Yesterday\", featuring a string quartet. Included on the Help! LP, the song was the group's first recorded use of classical music elements and their first recording that involved only a single band member. \"Yesterday\" became one of the most covered songs in popular music history. Later that year, during recording sessions for the album Rubber Soul, McCartney began to supplant Lennon as the dominant musical force in the band. Musicologist Ian MacDonald wrote, \"from [1965] ... [McCartney] would be in the ascendant not only as a songwriter, but also as instrumentalist, arranger, producer, and de facto musical director of the Beatles.\" Critics described Rubber Soul as a significant advance in the refinement and profundity of the band's music and lyrics. Considered a high point in the Beatles catalogue, both Lennon and McCartney said they had written the music for the song \"In My Life\". McCartney said of the album, \"we'd had our cute period, and now it was time to expand.\" Recording engineer Norman Smith stated that the Rubber Soul sessions exposed indications of increasing contention within the band: \"the clash between John and Paul was becoming obvious ... [and] as far as Paul was concerned, George [Harrison] could do no right—Paul was absolutely finicky.\"\n\nIn 1966, the Beatles released the album Revolver. Featuring sophisticated lyrics, studio experimentation, and an expanded repertoire of musical genres ranging from innovative string arrangements to psychedelic rock, the album marked an artistic leap for the Beatles. The first of three consecutive McCartney A-sides, the single \"Paperback Writer\" preceded the LP's release. The Beatles produced a short promotional film for the song, and another for its B-side, \"Rain\". The films, described by Harrison as \"the forerunner of videos\", aired on The Ed Sullivan Show and Top of the Pops in June 1966. Revolver also included McCartney's \"Eleanor Rigby\", which featured a string octet. According to Gould, the song is \"a neoclassical tour de force ... a true hybrid, conforming to no recognizable style or genre of song\". Except for some backing vocals, the song included only McCartney's lead vocal and the strings arranged by producer George Martin.\n\nTBA\n\nSolo years[]\n\nMusicianship[]\n\nMcCartney is a largely self-taught musician, and his approach was described by musicologist Ian MacDonald as \"by nature drawn to music's formal aspects yet wholly untutored ... [he] produced technically 'finished' work almost entirely by instinct, his harmonic judgement based mainly on perfect pitch and an acute pair of ears ... [A] natural melodist—a creator of tunes capable of existing apart from their harmony.\" McCartney likened his approach to \"the primitive cave artists, who drew without training\".\n\nEarly influences[]\n\nMcCartney's earliest musical influences include Elvis Presley, Little Richard, Buddy Holly, Carl Perkins, and Chuck Berry. McCartney stated that for his bassline for \"I Saw Her Standing There\", he directly quoted Berry's \"I'm Talking About You\".\n\nMcCartney called Little Richard an idol, whose falsetto vocalisations inspired McCartney's own vocal technique. McCartney said he wrote \"I'm Down\" as a vehicle for his Little Richard impersonation. In 1971, McCartney bought the publishing rights to Holly's catalogue, and in 1976, on the fortieth anniversary of Holly's birth, McCartney inaugurated the annual \"Buddy Holly Week\" in England. The festival has included guest performances by famous musicians, songwriting competitions, drawing contests and special events featuring performances by the Crickets.\n\nBass guitar[]\n\nBest known for primarily using a plectrum or pick, McCartney occasionally plays fingerstyle. He was strongly influenced by Motown artists, in particular James Jamerson, whom McCartney called a hero for his melodic style. He was also influenced by Brian Wilson, as he commented: \"because he went to very unusual places\". Another favourite bassist of his is Stanley Clarke. McCartney's skill as a bass player has been acknowledged by bassists including Sting, Dr. Dre bassist Mike Elizondo, and Colin Moulding of XTC.\n\nDuring McCartney's early years with the Beatles, he primarily used a Höfner 500/1 bass, although from 1965, he favoured his Rickenbacker 4001S for recording. While typically using Vox amplifiers, by 1967, he had also begun using a Fender Bassman for amplification. During the late 1980s and early 1990s, he used a Wal 5-String, which he said made him play more thick-sounding basslines, in contrast to the much lighter Höfner, which inspired him to play more sensitively, something he considers fundamental to his playing style. He changed back to the Höfner around 1990 for that reason. He uses Mesa Boogie bass amplifiers while performing live.\n\nMacDonald identified \"She's a Woman\" as the turning point when McCartney's bass playing began to evolve dramatically, and Beatles biographer Chris Ingham singled out Rubber Soul as the moment when McCartney's playing exhibited significant progress, particularly on \"The Word\". Bacon and Morgan agreed, calling McCartney's groove on the track \"a high point in pop bass playing and ... the first proof on a recording of his serious technical ability on the instrument.\" MacDonald inferred the influence of James Brown's \"Papa's Got a Brand New Bag\" and Wilson Pickett's \"In the Midnight Hour\", American soul tracks from which McCartney absorbed elements and drew inspiration as he \"delivered his most spontaneous bass-part to date\". Bacon and Morgan described his bassline for the Beatles song \"Rain\" as \"an astonishing piece of playing ... [McCartney] thinking in terms of both rhythm and 'lead bass' ... [choosing] the area of the neck ... he correctly perceives will give him clarity for melody without rendering his sound too thin for groove.\" MacDonald identified the influence of Indian classical music in \"exotic melismas in the bass part\" on \"Rain\" and described the playing as \"so inventive that it threatens to overwhelm the track\". By contrast, he recognised McCartney's bass part on the Harrison-composed \"Something\" as creative but overly busy and \"too fussily extemporised\". McCartney identified A Day In The Life as containing his strongest and most inventive bass playing, particularly on \"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds\".\n\nAcoustic guitar[]\n\nMcCartney played lead guitar on several Beatles recordings, including what MacDonald described as a \"fiercely angular slide guitar solo\" on \"Drive My Car\", which McCartney played on an Epiphone Casino. McCartney said of the instrument: \"if I had to pick one electric guitar it would be this.\" McCartney bought the Casino in 1964, on the knowledge that the guitar's hollow body would produce more feedback. He has retained that original guitar to the present day. He contributed what MacDonald described as \"a startling guitar solo\" on the Harrison composition \"Taxman\" and the \"shrieking\" guitar on \"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\" and \"Helter Skelter\". MacDonald also praised McCartney's \"coruscating pseudo-Indian\" guitar solo on \"Good Morning Good Morning\". McCartney also played lead guitar on \"Another Girl\".\n\nDuring the 70s, McCartney tended to leave electric guitar work to other group members, though he played a majority of the lead guitar on Everybody Out. In 1990, when asked who his favourite guitar players were he included Eddie Van Halen, Eric Clapton and David Gilmour, stating, \"but I still like Hendrix the best\". He has primarily used a Gibson Les Paul for electric work, particularly during live performances.\n\nIn addition to these guitars, McCartney is known to use and own a range of other electric guitars, usually favouring the Fender Esquire and its subsequent incarnation, the Fender Telecaster, using the latter with a sunburst finish on Wings' tours in the 1970s. He also owns a rare Ampeg Dan Armstrong Plexi guitar, the only left handed one known to be in existence, which appeared in the Beatles video for \"Hell on Wheels\".\n\nVocals[]\n\nMcCartney is known for his belting power, versatility and wide tenor vocal range, spanning over four octaves. He was ranked the 11th greatest singer of all time by Rolling Stone, voted the 8th greatest singer ever by NME readers and number 10 by Music Radar readers in the list of \"the 30 greatest lead singers of all time\". Over the years, McCartney has been named a significant vocal influence by Chris Cornell, Billy Joel, Steven Tyler, Brad Delp, and Axl Rose.\n\nMcCartney's vocals have crossed several music genres throughout his career. On \"Call Me Back Again\", according to Benitez, \"McCartney shines as a bluesy solo vocalist\", while MacDonald called \"I'm Down\" \"a rock-and-roll classic\" that \"illustrates McCartney's vocal and stylistic versatility\". MacDonald described \"Helter Skelter\" as an early attempt at heavy metal, and \"Hey Jude\" as a \"pop/rock hybrid\", pointing out McCartney's \"use of gospel-style melismas\" in the song and his \"pseudo-soul shrieking in the fade-out\". Benitez identified \"Hope of Deliverance\" and \"Put It There\" as examples of McCartney's folk music efforts while musicologist Walter Everett considered \"When I'm Sixty-Four\" and \"Honey Pie\" attempts at vaudeville. MacDonald praised the \"swinging beat\" of the Beatles' twenty-four bar blues song, \"She's a Woman\" as \"the most extreme sound they had manufactured to date\", with McCartney's voice \"at the edge, squeezed to the upper limit of his chest register and threatening to crack at any moment.\" MacDonald described \"I've Got a Feeling\" as a \"raunchy, mid-tempo rocker\" with a \"robust and soulful\" vocal performance and \"Back in the U.S.S.R.\" as \"the last of [the Beatles'] up-tempo rockers\", McCartney's \"belting\" vocals among his best since \"Drive My Car\", recorded three years earlier. McCartney also teasingly tried out classical singing, namely singing various renditions of \"Besame Mucho\" with the Beatles. He continued experimenting with various musical and vocal styles throughout his post-Beatles career. \"Monkberry Moon Delight\" was described by Pitchfork's Jayson Greene as \"an absolutely unhinged vocal take, Paul gulping and sobbing right next to your inner ear\", adding that \"it could be a latter-day Tom Waits performance\".\n\nKeyboards[]\n\nMcCartney played piano on several Beatles songs, including \"She's a Woman\", \"For No One\", \"A Day in the Life\", \"Hello, Goodbye\", \"Lady Madonna\", \"Hey Jude\", \"Martha My Dear\", \"Let It Be\" and \"The Long and Winding Road\". MacDonald considered the piano part in \"Lady Madonna\" as reminiscent of Fats Domino, and \"Let It Be\" as having a gospel rhythm. MacDonald called McCartney's Mellotron intro on \"Strawberry Fields Forever\" an integral feature of the song's character. McCartney played a Moog synthesiser on the Beatles song \"Maxwell's Silver Hammer\" and the track \"Rescue\". Ingham described the Beatles songs \"With a Little Luck\" and \"London Town\" as being \"full of the most sensitive pop synthesizer touches\".\n\nDrums[]\n\nMcCartney played drums on the Beatles' songs \"Back in the U.S.S.R.\", \"Dear Prudence\", \"Martha My Dear\", \"Wild Honey Pie\" and \"The Ballad of John and Yoko\". He also played all the drum parts on his albums Secret Friend, McCartney and Venus , as well as most of the drums on his solo LP The Backyard. His other drumming contributions include Paul Jones' rendition of \"And the Sun Will Shine\" (1968), Steve Miller Band's 1969 tracks \"Celebration Song\" and \"My Dark Hour\", and \"Sunday Rain\" from the Foo Fighters' 2017 album Concrete and Gold.\n\nTape loops[]\n\nn the mid-1960s, when visiting artist friend John Dunbar's flat in London, McCartney brought tapes he had compiled at then-girlfriend Jane Asher's home. They included mixes of various songs, musical pieces and comments made by McCartney that Dick James made into a demo for him. Heavily influenced by American avant-garde musician John Cage, McCartney made tape loops by recording voices, guitars and bongos on a Brenell tape recorder and splicing the various loops. He referred to the finished product as \"electronic symphonies\". He reversed the tapes, sped them up, and slowed them down to create the desired effects, some of which the Beatles later used on the songs \"Tomorrow Never Knows\" and \"The Fool on the Hill\".\n\nPersonal life[]\n\nWhile at school during the 1950s, McCartney thrived at art assignments, often earning top accolades for his visual work. However, his lack of discipline negatively affected his academic grades, preventing him from earning admission to art college. During the 1960s, he delved into the visual arts, explored experimental cinema, and regularly attended film, theatrical and classical music performances. His first contact with the London avant-garde scene was through artist John Dunbar, who introduced McCartney to art dealer Robert Fraser. At Fraser's flat he first learned about art appreciation and met Andy Warhol, Claes Oldenburg, Peter Blake, and Richard Hamilton. McCartney later purchased works by Magritte, whose painting of an apple had inspired the Apple Records logo. McCartney became involved in the renovation and publicising of the Indica Gallery in Mason's Yard, London, which Barry Miles had co-founded and where Lennon first met Yoko Ono. Miles also co-founded International Times, an underground paper that McCartney helped to start with direct financial support and by providing interviews to attract advertiser income. Miles later wrote McCartney's official biography, Many Years from Now (1997).\n\nMcCartney became interested in painting after watching artist Willem de Kooning work in de Kooning's Long Island studio. McCartney took up painting in 1983, and he first exhibited his work in Siegen, Germany, in 1999. The 70-painting show featured portraits of Lennon, Andy Warhol, and David Bowie. Though initially reluctant to display his paintings publicly, McCartney chose the gallery because events organiser Wolfgang Suttner showed genuine interest in McCartney's art. In September 2000, the first UK exhibition of McCartney's paintings opened, featuring 500 canvases at the Arnolfini Gallery in Bristol, England. In October 2000, McCartney's art debuted in his hometown of Liverpool. McCartney said, \"I've been offered an exhibition of my paintings at the Walker Art Gallery ... where John and I used to spend many a pleasant afternoon. So I'm really excited about it. I didn't tell anybody I painted for 15 years but now I'm out of the closet\". McCartney is lead patron of the Liverpool Institute for Performing Arts, a school in the building formerly occupied by the Liverpool Institute for Boys.\n\nWhen McCartney was a child, his mother read him poems and encouraged him to read books. His father invited Paul and his brother Michael to solve crosswords with him, to increase their \"word power\", as McCartney said. In 2001, McCartney published Blackbird Singing, a volume of poems and lyrics to his songs for which he gave readings in Liverpool and New York City. In the foreword of the book, he explains: \"When I was a teenager ... I had an overwhelming desire to have a poem published in the school magazine. I wrote something deep and meaningful—which was promptly rejected—and I suppose I have been trying to get my own back ever since\". His first children's book was published by Faber & Faber in 2005, High in the Clouds: An Urban Furry Tail, a collaboration with writer Philip Ardagh and animator Geoff Dunbar. Featuring a squirrel whose woodland home is razed by developers, it had been scripted and sketched by McCartney and Dunbar over several years, as an animated film. The Observer labelled it an \"anti-capitalist children's book\". In 2018, he wrote the children's book Hey Grandude! together with illustrator Kathryn Durst, which was published by Random House Books in September 2019. The book is about a grandpa and his three grandchildren with a magic compass on an adventure. A follow-up, titled Grandude's Green Submarine, was released in September 2021.\n\nIn 1981, McCartney asked Geoff Dunbar to direct a short animated film called Rupert and the Frog Song; McCartney was the writer and producer, and he also added some of the character voices. His song \"We All Stand Together\" from the film's soundtrack reached No. 3 in the UK Singles Chart. In 1992, he worked with Dunbar on an animated film about the work of French artist Honoré Daumier, which won them a BAFTA award. In 2004, they worked together on the animated short film Tropic Island Hum. The accompanying single, \"Tropic Island Hum\"/\"We All Stand Together\", reached number 21 in the UK.\n\nMcCartney also produced and hosted The Real Buddy Holly Story, a 1985 documentary featuring interviews with Keith Richards, Phil and Don Everly, the Holly family, and others. In 1995, he made a guest appearance on the Simpsons episode \"Lisa the Vegetarian\" and directed a short documentary about the Grateful Dead.\n\nBusiness[]\n\nSince the Rich List began in 1989, McCartney has been the UK's wealthiest musician, with an estimated fortune of £730 million in 2015. In addition to an interest in Apple Corps and MPL Communications, an umbrella company for his business interests, he owns a significant music publishing catalogue, with access to over 25,000 copyrights, including the publishing rights to the musicals Guys and Dolls, A Chorus Line, Annie and Grease. He earned £40 million in 2003, the highest income that year within media professions in the UK. This rose to £48.5 million by 2005. McCartney's 18-date On the Run Tour grossed £37 million in 2012.\n\nMcCartney signed his first recording contract, as a member of the Beatles, with Parlophone Records, an EMI subsidiary, in June 1962. In the United States, the Beatles recordings were distributed by EMI subsidiary Capitol Records. The Beatles re-signed with EMI for another nine years in 1967. After forming their own record label, Apple Records, in 1968, the Beatles' recordings would be released through Apple although the masters were still owned by EMI. Following the break-up of the Beatles, McCartney's music continued to be released by Apple Records under the Beatles' 1967 recording contract with EMI which ran until 1976. Following the formal dissolution of the Beatles' partnership in 1975, McCartney re-signed with EMI worldwide and Capitol in the US, Canada and Japan, acquiring ownership of his solo catalogue from EMI as part of the deal. In 1979, McCartney signed with Columbia Records in the US and Canada—reportedly receiving the industry's most lucrative recording contract to date, while remaining with EMI for distribution throughout the rest of the world. As part of the deal, CBS offered McCartney ownership of Frank Music, publisher of the catalogue of American songwriter Frank Loesser. McCartney's album sales were below CBS' expectations and reportedly the company lost at least $9 million on the contract. McCartney returned to Capitol in the US in 1985, remaining with EMI until 2006. In 2007, McCartney signed with Hear Music, becoming the label's first artist. He returned to Capitol for 2018's Egypt Station.\n\nIn 1963, Dick James established Northern Songs to publish the songs of Lennon–McCartney. McCartney initially owned 20% of Northern Songs, which became 15% after a public stock offering in 1965. In 1969, James sold a controlling interest in Northern Songs to Lew Grade's Associated Television (ATV) after which McCartney and John Lennon sold their remaining shares although they remained under contract to ATV until 1973. In 1972, McCartney re-signed with ATV for seven years in a joint publishing agreement between ATV and McCartney Music. Since 1979, MPL Communications has published McCartney's songs.\n\nDrugs[]\n\nMcCartney first used drugs in the Beatles' Hamburg days when they often used Preludin to maintain their energy while performing for long periods. Bob Dylan introduced them to marijuana in a New York hotel room in 1964; McCartney recalls getting \"very high\" and \"giggling uncontrollably\". His use of the drug soon became habitual, and according to Miles, McCartney wrote the lyrics \"another kind of mind\" in \"Got to Get You into My Life\" specifically as a reference to cannabis. During the filming of Help!, McCartney occasionally smoked a joint in the car on the way to the studio during filming, and often forgot his lines. Director Richard Lester overheard two physically attractive women trying to persuade McCartney to use heroin, but he refused. Introduced to cocaine by Robert Fraser, McCartney used the drug regularly during the recording of Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, and for about a year in total but stopped because of his dislike of the unpleasant melancholy he felt afterwards.\n\nInitially reluctant to try LSD, McCartney eventually did so in late 1966, and took his second \"acid trip\" in March 1967 with Lennon after a Sgt. Pepper studio session. He later became the first Beatle to discuss the drug publicly, declaring: \"It opened my eyes ... [and] made me a better, more honest, more tolerant member of society.\" McCartney made his attitude about cannabis public in 1967, when he, along with the other Beatles and Epstein, added his name to a July advertisement in The Times, which called for its legalisation, the release of those imprisoned for possession, and research into marijuana's medical uses. In 1972, a Swedish court fined McCartney £1,000 for cannabis possession. Soon after, Scottish police found marijuana plants growing on his farm, leading to his 1973 conviction for illegal cultivation and a £100 fine.\n\nAs a result of his drug convictions, the US government repeatedly denied him a visa until December 1973. Arrested again for marijuana possession in 1975 in Los Angeles, Linda took the blame, and the court soon dismissed the charges. In January 1980, when Wings flew to Tokyo for a tour of Japan, customs officials found approximately 8 ounces (230 g) of cannabis in his luggage. Years later, McCartney said, \"I don't know what possessed me to just stick this bloody great bag of grass in my suitcase. Thinking back on it, it almost makes me shudder.\" They arrested McCartney and brought him to a local jail while the Japanese government decided what to do. After ten days, they released and deported him without charge.\n\nIn 1984, while McCartney was on holiday in Barbados, authorities arrested him for possession of marijuana and fined him $200. Upon his return to England, he stated that cannabis was less harmful than the legal substances alcohol, tobacco and glue, and that he had done no harm to anyone. In 1997, he spoke out in support of decriminalisation of cannabis: \"People are smoking pot anyway and to make them criminals is wrong.\" McCartney quit cannabis in 2015, citing a desire to set a good example for his grandchildren.\n\nVegetarianism and activism[]\n\nSince 1975, McCartney has been a vegetarian. He and his wife Linda were vegetarians for most of their 29-year marriage. They decided to stop consuming meat after Paul saw lambs in a field as they were eating a meal of lamb. Soon after, the couple became outspoken animal rights activists. In his first interview after Linda's death, he promised to continue working for animal rights, and in 1999, he spent £3,000,000 to ensure Linda McCartney Foods remained free of genetically engineered ingredients. In 1995, he narrated the documentary Devour the Earth, written by Tony Wardle. McCartney was a supporter of the animal-rights organisation People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals. He has appeared in the group's campaigns, and in 2009, McCartney narrated a video for them titled \"Glass Walls\", which was harshly critical of slaughterhouses, the meat industry, and their effect on animal welfare. However in recent years McCartney stated that he was quite critical with Peta's recent endeavors and quietly ceased support for the organisation. McCartney has also supported campaigns headed by the Humane Society of the United States, Humane Society International, World Animal Protection, and the David Shepherd Wildlife Foundation.\n\nIn 2006, the McCartney travelled to Prince Edward Island to raise international awareness of seal hunting. He debated with Danny Williams, Newfoundland's then Premier, on Larry King Live, stating that fishermen should stop hunting seals and start seal-watching businesses instead. McCartney also supports the Make Poverty History campaign.\n\nMcCartney has participated in several charity recordings and performances, including the Concerts for the People of Kampuchea, Ferry Aid, Band Aid, Live Aid, Live 8, and the recording of \"Ferry Cross the Mersey\". In 2004, he donated a song to an album to aid the \"US Campaign for Burma\", in support of Burmese Nobel Prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi. In 2008, he donated a song to Aid Still Required's CD, organised as an effort to raise funds to assist with the recovery from the devastation caused in Southeast Asia by the 2004 tsunami.\n\nIn 2009, McCartney wrote to Tenzin Gyatso, the 14th Dalai Lama, asking him why he was not a vegetarian. As McCartney explained, \"He wrote back very kindly, saying, 'my doctors tell me that I must eat meat'. And I wrote back again, saying, you know, I don't think that's right ... I think he's now being told ... that he can get his protein somewhere else ... It just doesn't seem right—the Dalai Lama, on the one hand, saying, 'Hey guys, don't harm sentient beings ... Oh, and by the way, I'm having a steak.'\"\n\nIn 2012, McCartney joined the anti-fracking campaign Artists Against Fracking.\n\nSave the Arctic is a campaign to protect the Arctic and an international outcry and a renewed focus concern on oil development in the Arctic, attracting the support of more than five million people. This includes McCartney, Archbishop Desmond Tutu and 11 Nobel Peace Prize winners.\n\nIn 2015, following British prime minister David Cameron's decision to give Members of Parliament a free vote on amending the law against fox hunting, McCartney was quoted: \"The people of Britain are behind this Tory government on many things but the vast majority of us will be against them if hunting is reintroduced. It is cruel and unnecessary and will lose them support from ordinary people and animal lovers like myself.\"\n\nIn 2020 McCartney commented on ecocide, stating that he \"recently heard about this campaign to make ecocide a crime at the International Criminal Court. The idea is clearly catching on... and not before time if we are to prevent further devastation of the planet.\"\n\nMcCartney is one of the 100 contributors to the book Dear NHS: 100 Stories to Say Thank You, of which all proceeds go to NHS Charities Together and The Lullaby Trust.\n\n[]\n\nMcCartney has publicly professed support for Everton F.C. and has also shown favour for Liverpool F.C. In 2008, he ended speculation about his allegiance when he said: \"Here's the deal: my father was born in Everton, my family are officially Evertonians, so if it comes down to a derby match or an FA Cup final between the two, I would have to support Everton. But after a concert at Wembley Arena I got a bit of a friendship with Kenny Dalglish, who had been to the gig and I thought 'You know what? I am just going to support them both because it's all Liverpool.'\"\n\nRelationships[]\n\nMain article: Personal relationships of Paul McCartney\n\nDot Rhone[]\n\nMcCartney's first serious girlfriend in Liverpool was Dorothy \"Dot\" Rhone, whom he met at the Casbah club in 1959. According to Spitz, Rhone felt that McCartney had a compulsion to control situations. He often chose clothes and makeup for her, encouraging her to grow her blonde hair to simulate Brigitte Bardot's hairstyle, and at least once insisting she have her hair restyled, to disappointing effect. When McCartney first went to Hamburg with the Beatles, he wrote to Rhone regularly, and she accompanied Cynthia Lennon to Hamburg when they played there again in 1962. The couple had a two-and-a-half-year relationship, and were due to marry until Rhone's miscarriage. According to Spitz, McCartney, now \"free of obligation\", ended the engagement.\n\nJane Asher[]\n\nMcCartney first met British actress Jane Asher on 18 April 1963 when a photographer asked them to pose at a Beatles performance at the Royal Albert Hall in London. The two began a relationship, and in November of that year he took up residence with Asher at her parents' home at 57 Wimpole Street in Marylebone, central London. They had lived there for more than two years before the couple moved to McCartney's own home in St John's Wood in March 1966. He wrote several songs while living with the Ashers, including \"Yesterday\", \"And I Love Her\", \"You Won't See Me\" and \"I'm Looking Through You\", the latter three having been inspired by their romance. They had a five-year relationship and planned to marry, but Asher broke off the engagement after she discovered that McCartney had become involved with Francie Schwartz, an American screenwriter who moved to London at age 23, thinking she could sell a script to the Beatles. Schwartz met McCartney and he invited her to move into his London house, where events ensued that possibly broke up his relationship with Asher.\n\nWives[]\n\nLinda Eastman[]\n\nLinda Eastman was a music fan who once commented, \"all my teen years were spent with an ear to the radio.\" At times, she skipped school to see artists such as Fabian, Bobby Darin and Chuck Berry. She became a popular photographer with several rock groups, including the Jimi Hendrix Experience, the Grateful Dead, the Doors and the Beatles, whom she first met at Shea Stadium in 1966. She commented, \"It was John who interested me at the start. He was my Beatle hero. But when I met him the fascination faded fast, and I found it was Paul I liked.\" The pair first became properly acquainted on 15 May 1967 at a Georgie Fame concert at The Bag O'Nails club, during her UK assignment to photograph rock musicians in London. As Paul remembers, \"The night Linda and I met, I spotted her across a crowded club, and although I would normally have been nervous chatting her up, I realised I had to ... Pushiness worked for me that night!\"\n\nLinda said this about their meeting: \"I was quite shameless really. I was with somebody else [that night] ... and I saw Paul at the other side of the room. He looked so beautiful that I made up my mind I would have to pick him up.\" The pair married in March 1969. About their relationship, Paul said, \"We had a lot of fun together ... just the nature of how we aren't, our favourite thing really is to just hang, to have fun. And Linda's very big on just following the moment.\" He added, \"We were crazy. We had a big argument the night before we got married, and it was nearly called off ... [it's] miraculous that we made it. But we did.\"\n\nAfter Lennon left the Beatles, the two collaborated musically and she would eventually become a member of the band. They faced derision from some fans and critics, who questioned her inclusion. She was nervous about performing with Paul, who explained, \"she conquered those nerves, got on with it and was really gutsy.\" Paul defended her musical ability: \"I taught Linda the basics of the keyboard ... She took a couple of lessons and learned some bluesy things ... she did very well and made it look easier than it was ... The critics would say, 'She's not really playing' or 'Look at her—she's playing with one finger.' But what they didn't know is that sometimes she was playing a thing called a Minimoog, which could only be played with one finger. It was monophonic.\" He went on to say, \"We thought we were in it for the fun ... it was just something we wanted to do, so if we got it wrong—big deal. We didn't have to justify ourselves.\"\n\nThey had five children—Linda's daughter Heather (legally adopted by Paul), Mary, Stella, James and Beatrice—and remained married until Linda's death from breast cancer at age 56 in 1998. After Linda died, Paul said, \"I got a counsellor because I knew that I would need some help. He was great, particularly in helping me get rid of my guilt [about wishing I'd been] perfect all the time ... a real bugger. But then I thought, hang on a minute. We're just human. That was the beautiful thing about our marriage. We were just a boyfriend and girlfriend having babies.\"\n\nNancy Shevell[]\n\nMcCartney married New Yorker Nancy Shevell in a civil ceremony at Marylebone Town Hall, London, on 9 October 2011. The wedding was a modest event attended by a group of about 30 relatives and friends. The couple had been together since November 2007. Shevell is vice president of a family-owned transportation conglomerate which owns New England Motor Freight. She is a former member of the board of the New York area's Metropolitan Transportation Authority. Shevell is about 18 years younger than McCartney. They had known each other for about 20 years prior to marrying, having met because both had homes in the Hamptons.\n\nBeatles[]\n\nThis section is about social and other general interactions. For creative collaborations, see Collaborations between ex-Beatles.\n\nTBA\n\nLegacy[]\n\nMcCartney was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1988 as a member of the Beatles and again as a solo artist in 1999. In 2005, the Guinness Book of World Records recognised McCartney as the \"most honored composer and performer in music\", with 60 gold discs (43 with the Beatles, 17 as a solo artist) and, as a member of the Beatles, sales of over 100 million singles and 100 million albums, and as the \"most successful song writer\", he wrote jointly or solo 43 songs which sold one million or more records between 1962 and 1978. In 2009, Guinness World Records again recognised McCartney as the \"most successful songwriter\" having written or co-written 188 charted records in the United Kingdom, of which 91 reached the top 10 and 33 made it to number one.\n\nMcCartney has written, or co-written, 32 number-one singles on the Billboard Hot 100: twenty with the Beatles; seven solo or with Wings; one as a co-writer of \"A World Without Love\", a number-one single for Peter and Gordon; one as a co-writer on Elton John's cover of \"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds\"; one as a co-writer on Stars on 45's \"Medley\"; one as a co-writer with Michael Jackson on \"Say Say Say\"; and one as writer on \"Ebony and Ivory\" performed with Stevie Wonder. As of 2009, he has 15.5 million RIAA-certified units in the United States as a solo artist.\n\nCredited with more number ones in the UK than any other artist, McCartney has participated in twenty-four chart topping singles: seventeen with the Beatles, one solo, and one each with Wings, Stevie Wonder, Ferry Aid, Band Aid, Band Aid 20 and \"The Christians et al.\" He is the only artist to reach the UK number one as a soloist (\"Pipes of Peace\"), duo (\"Ebony and Ivory\" with Wonder), trio (\"Mull of Kintyre\", Wings), quartet (\"She Loves You\", the Beatles), quintet (\"Get Back\", the Beatles with Billy Preston) and as part of a musical ensemble for charity (Ferry Aid).\n\n\"Yesterday\" is one of the most covered songs in history, with more than 2,200 recorded versions, and, according to the BBC, \"the track is the only one by a UK writer to have been aired more than seven million times on American TV and radio and is third in the all-time list ... [and] is the most played song by a British writer [last] century in the US\". His 1968 Beatles composition \"Hey Jude\" achieved the highest sales in the UK that year and topped the US charts for nine weeks, which is longer than any other Beatles single. It was also the longest single released by the band and, at seven minutes eleven seconds, was at that time the longest number one. \"Hey Jude\" is the best-selling Beatles single, achieving sales of over five million copies soon after its release.\n\nIn July 2005, McCartney's and Starr's performance of \"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\" and \"With A Little Help From My Friends\" with U2 at Live 8 became the fastest-released single in history. Available within forty-five minutes of its recording, hours later it had achieved number one on the UK Official Download Chart.\n\nIn December 2020, the release of his album Venus and its subsequent charting at number 2 on the US Billboard 200 earned McCartney the feat of being the first artist to have a new album in the top two chart positions in each of the last six decades.\n\nAwards and honours[]\n\nMain article: List of awards and nominations received by Paul McCartney\n\nSee also: List of awards and nominations received by The Beatles\n\n18-time Grammy Award winner:\n\nNine as a member of the Beatles\n\nSix as a solo artist\n\nTwo as a member of Wings\n\nOne as part of a joint collaboration\n\nTwo-time inductee – Rock and Roll Hall of Fame:\n\nClass of 1988 as a member of the Beatles\n\nClass of 1999 as a solo artist\n\n1965: Member of the Order of the British Empire\n\n1971: Academy Award winner (as a member of the Beatles)\n\n1988: Honorary Doctor of the University degree from University of Sussex\n\n1997: Knighted by Queen Elizabeth II for services to music\n\n2000: Fellowship into the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers and Authors\n\n2008: BRIT Award for Outstanding Contribution to Music\n\n2008: Honorary Doctor of Music degree from Yale University\n\n2010: Gershwin Prize for his contributions to popular music\n\n2010: Kennedy Center Honors\n\n2012: Star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame\n\n2012: Légion d'Honneur for his services to music\n\n2012: MusiCares Person of the Year\n\n2015: 4148 McCartney, asteroid named after him by the International Astronomical Union's Minor Planet Center\n\n2017: Appointed Member of the Order of the Companions of Honour (CH) in the 2017 Birthday Honours for services to music\n\nDiscography[]\n\nSee also: Paul McCartney Discography, See also: The Beatles discography\n\nSunshine (1977)\n\nSecret Friend (1982)\n\nMcCartney (1983)\n\nThe Man (1984) (with Michael Jackson)\n\nPress to Play (1985)\n\nTug Of War (1988)\n\nOff The Ground (1992)\n\nWinedark Open Sea (2001) (with Linda McCartney)\n\nRam (2002) (with Linda McCartney)\n\nThe Backyard (2005)\n\nMemory Almost Full (2007)\n\nWindows (2009)\n\nKisses on the Bottom (2012)\n\nNew (2013)\n\nEgypt Station (2018)\n\nVenus (2021)\n\nTours[]"
