        "text": "A Beatles fan with deep pockets has the chance to snap up a key item of memorabilia: Paul McCartney’s former childhood home. The three-up two-down terrace in Liverpool will go under the hammer on 26 February, with a guide price of £100,000. And appropriately enough, the auction is taking place at the Cavern Club, Liverpool.\n\nMcCartney has described the mid-terrace property at 72 Western Avenue in Speke, Liverpool, as “the first house I remember”, although it is one of several houses the young musician lived in with his parents Jim and Mary while growing up. Their later home at 20 Forthlin Road, where McCartney’s musical career first began, is now owned by the National Trust.\n\nThe estate agents handling the sale said it would appeal to “any keen Beatles enthusiast wishing to own a significant part of Paul McCartney’s history in the form of a well presented family home”.\n\nStephen Giddins, regional sales director of selling agent Entwistle Green, said: “The Beatles, arguably one the biggest bands of all time, still attract thousands of visitors to Liverpool each year, so to get the opportunity to offer for sale Paul McCartney’s childhood home is very exciting.\n\n“Taking into consideration the location, the property itself and the background, we expect a lot of interest locally and internationally and would urge all interested parties to register their details as soon as possible to ensure they don’t miss out on this rare opportunity.”\n\nThe property has two receptions, three bedrooms and gardens both front and back, and is on sale for a guide price of £100,000 plus. The agents said this was not out of line with prices in the area, and the auction would determine if buyers were willing to pay a premium for a piece of McCartney history.\n\nIn 2013, John Lennon’s childhood home at 9 Newcastle Road sold at auction for £480,000 – more than three times its guide price – and in 2014 George Harrison’s home at 25 Upton Green went for £156,000."
