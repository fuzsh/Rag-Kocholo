        "text": "Fourteen years ago, I stood on an arena floor in Denver as Paul McCartney walked onto the stage and played the first chords of \"Hello, Goodbye.\" The next three hours made for the best concert I had ever seen up until that point.\n\nThere were more great memories – a front-row seat in Omaha with my wife, another show in the beautiful confines of Wrigley Field after a 10-hour drive to Chicago, and two years later with an upper-deck seat at Target Field, where I got to share the experience with my two 7-year-old boys. From Fargo to Kansas City, McCartney's concerts have been my ticket to ride to nine cities for nine shows.\n\nThis summer we'll get the chance of welcoming the Beatle to Sioux Falls on May 2. Who ever thought that was possible?\n\nAnd now that we have a few weeks to let that soak in, here is what you can expect when McCartney steps foot in the Denny Sanford Premier Center:\n\nLong and winding setlist: The 73-year-old doesn't act his age. Get ready for 35-40 songs spanning more than 2.5 hours. While his band takes a break, McCartney doesn't, except for two planned encores. He also doesn't take a sip of water – at least in front of the audience.\n\nRock show: The show will likely start with a well-known rocker, followed by a few more up-tempo songs until he gets to song six or seven. At that point, McCartney will head over to the piano for a few songs before he picks up his guitar again for an acoustic set, some with a full band and some on his own. He'll play the piano again, this time of the psychedelic variety from the \"Magical Mystery Tour,\" and switch to guitar again before a couple more piano songs lead in to the first encore. He'll have two encores with 3-4 songs each, for most of which he'll be on guitar.\n\nThe Beatles years: Since he started touring regularly again in 2002, the set list has been geared heavily toward songs from The Beatles' days. Expect two-thirds of the set list to cover his work with the band in the 1960s. The other third will be solo songs, primarily from the 1970s, with a couple songs from his new album thrown in. For fans who just want to hear the hits, you'll be happy. For die-hards who would prefer more obscure songs, don't count on it.\n\nOpener: There will be no opening act in the traditional sense, as there is not going to be a band or musician that plays before McCartney. On his most recent tours, he has had a DJ sample his songs to a video collage with photos and clips of McCartney through the years.\n\nHis band: McCartney has had the same touring band since 2002. There are guitarists Brian Ray and Rusty Anderson, keyboardist Wix Wickens (who plays orchestra parts on his piano) and drummer Abe Laboriel Jr., who provides a lot of entertainment with a passionate and intense performance from the back stage.\n\nThe stage: It's a new tour, so a few tweaks are possible, but expect McCartney to be front and center on the square stage surrounded by Ray and Anderson to his left and right, respectively. In the past, there have been two large video screens in the back to the left and right of the stage with a wider board across the length of the stage behind the drummer. That screen mostly displays graphics and animations, while the two vertical boards show the performers and occasionally fans.\n\nSurprises: Generally the set list is the same from night to night, but McCartney has been known to play a few surprise songs in certain places. For instance, he has played \"Kansas City\" in Kansas City before and \"It's So Easy\" in Lubbock, Texas, the birthplace of Buddy Holly. Could McCartney play \"Rocky Raccoon\" in Sioux Falls? The song makes mention of the \"black mountain hills of Dakota.\" It's one of the few McCartney-written Beatles songs he has never played live before. It's possible.\n\nStanding room only: It could be different in Sioux Falls, but my experience is that the first 20-30 rows on the floor stand. So if you don't want to stand for the entire show, I wouldn't suggest getting tickets on the floor.\n\nHello, Goodbye: If you've seen McCartney once or twice before, you'll notice some familiar stories. There isn't a lot of spontaneity from one show to the next, including his interactions with the audience, although at some gigs, he will read some of the best signs that he sees in the crowd. If I had to estimate, McCartney will interact with the audience about 5-7 times during the show, which includes extended bits of talking between songs. Most of the time there will be 5-6 songs played before he tells a story, and most of those stories include how songs were written or recollections of his Beatles days.\n\nWant really close tickets? Get your wallet out: You could be the first in line or the first online to buy tickets when they go on sale to the general public, but that won’t mean you will get front-row or close-to-the stage seats. The best seats are given out in the “VIP package,” which includes access to a 10-plus song exclusive soundcheck before the show, a vegetarian meal and some tour goodies. It’s spendy, however, $1,500 for the first few rows and $2,000 for a front-row package, at least on past tours. Other seats on the floor cost $250 with the cheapest tickets for the upper deck costing $60.\n\nWhat will he play? If you want to be surprised, don't read on. Since this is a new tour, McCartney is going to mix up the set list from when he last played in the U.S. during the \"Out There\" tour in 2015. But it's almost a lock to say he will play these songs, which have been a consistent part of the setlist since 2002. They are: \"Band on the Run,\" \"Let It Be,\" \"Hey Jude,\" \"Live and Let Die,\" (complete with fireworks) \"Yesterday,\" \"The Long and Winding Road,\" \"Back In the U.S.S.R.\" \"Eleanor Rigby\" and \"Let Me Roll It (from his 1973 album, \"Band on the Run.\" And for the most part, McCartney will stay very true to the original arrangements.\n\nTributes: Similarly, two songs that McCartney plays in honor of the late John Lennon and George Harrison will also likely be on the setlist. McCartney, alone on stage with an acoustic guitar, has played \"Here Today\" for the past decade. The song was a tribute to Lennon after he was murdered in 1980. It's on Paul's 1982 album, \"Tug of War.\" McCartney gets out the ukelele for his tribute to George, playing solo on stage to Harrison's \"Something\" before the full band starts to join him halfway through the song. It's \"Something\" as you've never heard it before. The upcoming tour could also bring a tribute to George Martin, the Beatles' producer who died Tuesday.\n\nWhat won't he play? McCartney was a member of The Beatles, but that doesn't mean that all of the band's songs are on the table. McCartney is not likely to play songs he did not write or sing lead on, so that excludes \"Come Together,\" \"While My Guitar Gently Weeps,\" \"In My Life\" and many others.\n\nSouth Dakota Pride: When McCartney and his band come back on stage after an encore, he'll be carrying a United States flag. Another band member will have a South Dakota flag in his hands and Wickens will have a British flag.\n\nYou might get lucky: 11 years ago, I had front-row seats (before they started the VIP packages) and caught McCartney's attention with my British flag that said \"McCartney '05\" on it. During the show, he gave me and my wife the patented thumbs up. At the end of the concert, he walked directly over to us and asked for the flag. He signed it, and we have a memento that we will cherish forever. He typically signs a couple of items after each performance, but you have to be close and catch his attention. McCartney seems to thrive on people who are really into the show – dancing, singing, holding signs. So if you are close enough and want \"Abbey Road\" signed, bring it. You never know.\n\nIs it worth it? Paul McCartney tickets are among the most expensive for acts touring today. The closest floor seats will run you $250, with other seats $167, $101 and upper deck $60. If you like the Beatles and McCartney, however, you can't go wrong. He puts on a long show, the production value is on a class all of its own and the songs are legendary. Most people who see McCartney come out saying it's the best concert they've ever been to.\n\nODDS AND ENDS\n\nTour merchandise: There will be plenty of items to choose from, especially if you like T-shirts. There will be a program available, which is typically well-designed with interesting articles and good photos for $30, plus other trinkets that you probably want but don't really need."
