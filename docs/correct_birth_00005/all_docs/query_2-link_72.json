        "text": "As Beatlemania was transforming rock ânâ roll from passing teen fad to permanent pop-cultural movement, Paul McCartney (born in Liverpool in 1942) became the driving force behind the bandâs rapid, dramatic maturation. In just two years, he had graduated from the Little Richard worship of 1963âs âI Saw Her Standing Thereâ to the exquisite orchestral balladry of âYesterdayââa shift that intensified the contrast between McCartney and his increasingly acerbic songwriting partner, John Lennon. But as The Beatlesâ entered their late-â60s experimental phaseâduring which Lennonâs avant-garde impulses came to the foreâMcCartneyâs traditionalism constituted its own form of radicalism. Within the bandâs psychedelic milieu, his embrace of pre-rock forms, like classical (âEleanor Rigbyâ) and English music-hall serenades (âWhen Iâm Sixty-Fourâ), felt no less surreal than The Beatles' use of tape-loop freak-outs and sitar drones. (And this is to say nothing of Paul's sublime bass playing, which elevated the four-string from rhythmic undercurrent to melodic focal point.) His post-Beatles albums have proven equally uncanny and influential: 1971âs art-folk opus Ram provided the lo-fi schematic for future generations of DIY home-recording artists, while the arena-rattling roar of âJet,â from McCartney's subsequent band Wingsâ 1973 LP Band on the Run, shows why heâs become a muse to hard rockers such as Dave Grohl. And by continually collaborating with the hitmakers of the dayâfrom Michael Jackson in the 1980s to Rihanna and Kanye West in the 2010sâhe has remained a voracious pop omnivore, as connected to music's past as its future."
