But there was music and inspiration. They were saying, ‘If we can make our dreams come true, so can you.’”\n\nCelia Richardson, from the National Trust, said:\n\n“We know from talking to people who visit 20 Forthlin Road that the music sparked there has had a massive impact on peoples’ lives over the years.\n\n“We want the stories of the places we care for to keep inspiring creativity among new generations and we can’t wait to see this next chapter in the Forthlin Road story.”\n\nThe Forthlin Sessions will be played on June 17 and broadcast online."
