        "text": "20 Forthlin Road was the childhood home of Paul McCartney and his brother Mike, and was also the location where McCartney and John Lennon wrote hits including \"I Saw Her Standing There\", \"Love Me Do\", \"I’ll Follow The Sun\" and more.\n\nYesterday (5 April), The National Trust, who now own the home, announced the launch of The Forthlin Sessions, which will see unsigned UK artists aged 18 or over given the opportunity to write and perform music in the legendary space.\n\nAccording to The National Trust, they will work with Mike McCartney and Pete Paphides and the Liverpool Institute of Performing Arts (LIPA) to choose the unsigned artists who will take part in The Forthlin Sessions, which will be \"recorded and publicised, offering vital opportunities for new musical talent to reach audiences.\" The unsigned artists chosen to take part will be given the opportunity to write a new song \"inspired by the Beatles' legacy\", and perform it in McCartney's old living room in June.\n\nHilary McGrady, National Trust Director General, said, \"What the Beatles did was inspire a generation to feel free to be creative, regardless of who or where they were. Much of that started at 20 Forthlin Road with the songs that were written under this roof. It’s a pleasure to care for the Beatles’ childhood homes and to use the story of what happened there to continue this legacy. Our places don’t have to be stuck in time; they’re here to keep sparking creativity, dreams, and new ideas. We can’t wait to hear how what happened at 20 Forthlin Road inspired and keeps on inspiring the nation.\""
