        "text": "In a press release accompanying his first solo album, McCartney, Paul stated that the record’s themes were “home, family and love\" – three words that clearly meant a lot to him at the time as a new father and husband getting used to family life in Scotland.\n\nThese themes have remained present in much of Paul’s work over the years, suggesting they are just as relevant to him now as they were in 1970. Whether Paul is singing about his desire to build a home with his loved ones (‘Looking for a home in the heart of the country’) or describing the beginning of a new relationship (‘Then she appeared, a love so fine, my valentine’), his sentiment remains that ‘love isn’t silly at all’!\n\nSo, with Valentine’s Day right around the corner, we thought this question from Twitter might bring out Paul’s romantic side…\n\nPaulMcCartney.com: What do you consider your ‘role’ as a father and a husband?\n\nPaul: I would say that being a father and being a husband are two completely different things. As far as being a dad is concerned, I’ve always just tried to give my kids a bit of guidance, if they seem to need it - but that was mainly when they were younger. Now that they are older, they’re guiding me! They don’t need so much guidance these days but if there’s ever a problem, I’m very happy to be the guy they come to. So, that’s largely the thing of being a dad. You’re just there to help, and I suppose have fun with - we do have a lot of fun. Now they’re older we can have a drink together, for instance!\n\nWhen it comes to being a husband… I see it as just trying to be good to my wife Nancy and trying to be considerate and romantic. I completely overdo Valentine’s Day! I mean, there’s not just one card, there are cards hidden around the room, and sometimes things even spill into the next day - it’s completely silly. If there’s an excuse to have some fun, I overdo it! At Christmas, I go crazy with the tree lights and fairy lights - totally overdo it.\n\nI try to be helpful as a husband too. If there’s a problem, I like to be the guy that will lend some strength to it. I’m always very happy to be the person Nancy relies on, and to be her strength when she goes through tough times. I am very proud, in fact, to be ‘The Guy’ there. And I know she is grateful. So, that’s my role as a husband: it’s to be the strength and the romance at the same time. I don’t think I consciously chose to be that way. It’s just how I do things.\n\nWell, that certainly puts our Valentine Day’s plans to shame – we’d been planning just one day of celebrations! What’s your favourite love song by Paul? If you’re struggling to pick a place to start, we recommend trying out the Love EP – listen here."
