        "text": "Paul McCartney has been here, there and everywhere since the Beatles made him an international superstar more than 50 years ago.\n\nWell, almost everywhere. One place that he had managed to avoid was his childhood home in the Liverpool suburb of Allerton, but Sir Paul recently made the trek back. And, of course, he entertained a little with a Beatles classic, according to the Daily Mail.\n\nMcCartney’s nostalgic return was filmed for a segment for “The Late Late Show with James Corden.” The last time he visited this spot was in 1964, as The Beatles were achieving international superstardom.\n\nMcCartney had previously explained why he was in no rush to visit the three-bedroom house that he shared with his father, mother and younger brother Michael. “I don’t know whether I will be a little worried that it’ll be too nostalgic or whether there will be a sadness about it that I don’t associate with it at the moment. But I think I will one of these days,” he had said.\n\nThe family moved in 1955 into the home at 20 Forthlin Ave., which is now owned by the National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty. McCartney’s mother, Mary, died of breast cancer the following year at the age of 47.\n\nMcCartney had previously said Mary had wanted the family to move from “bad area into a slightly posh area, so perhaps some of the posh might rub off on us.”\n\nFollowing his success with the Beatles, McCartney purchased an even posher home for his father, James, across the Mersey on The Wirral.\n\nDuring his visit, McCartney, 75, tinkered on the piano in the front room and broke into an impromptu rendition of “When I’m Sixty-four.”\n\n“There was a coach-load of tourists outside, just as there is every day, and suddenly Sir Paul looked out of the window and waved to them. They couldn’t believe it,” said tour guide Kevin Buckley."
