Thanks for joining me on my birthday. I am so grateful to you all for helping me promote Peace & Love. I want to give special thanks to all the Peace & Love Ambassadors - we are in 34 countries!\n\n“Thanks for doing it - and I gotta thank all the fans, peace & love - just join me in your mind, or on the bus or wherever you are on the 7th of the 7th just go Peace & Love at Noon your local time.”\n\nMeanwhile, Sir Paul McCartney and the estates of John Lennon and George Harrison have paid tribute to Ringo on his birthday.\n\nAdditionally, George Harrison’s estate shared a quote from the Quiet Beatle on Ringo.\n\nIt read: “‘If I play a song to Ringo, I don’t need to say to him, ‘I want it to go like this’, I just play it and he joins in... he just gets his sticks and he just does it and it sounds just like Ringo and he can hold the rock steady all day long.’ George\n\n“Happy Birthday Ringo! We have made a donation to the Lotus Foundation. Carry on the good work. Love you. Have a great day.”"
