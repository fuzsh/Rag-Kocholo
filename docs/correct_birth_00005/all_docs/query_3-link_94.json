        "text": "EDITOR'S NOTE: To celebrate Billy Joel, Mark Rivera and the rest of the band's final concert and his 150th overall show on July 25 at the legendary Madison Square Garden, we are republishing this feature from April 3, 2023 on Mark Rivera and his amazing career that spans over 50 years.\n\nMark Rivera, a veteran sideman of the highest order, knows the grind better than most.\n\nAfter a night of relentless gigging across New York City, he trudges wearily up six flights of stairs, yearning for the solace of his bed. But in the tumult of his exhaustion, the phone rings—a summons that sparks his relentless pursuit of musical fulfillment. That's the life of a sideman—the unsung heroes who live to perform, irrespective of stage size or audience scale.\n\nHe continues to tour the world as a member of Billy Joel's band, a post he's held for four decades and countless live shows, including shows with the likes of Paul McCartney, Tony Bennett and so many others. Yet, amidst the glitz and glamour of the music industry, Rivera remains grounded—a testament to the ethos of the sideman.\n\nFrom his iconic collaborations with Sam and Dave to decades steering Ringo Starr’s All Starr Band, his saxophone has graced monumental tracks like Peter Gabriel's \"Sledgehammer\" and Foreigner's \"Urgent.\" Rivera's journey, chronicled in his recent memoir \"Sideman: In Pursuit of the Next Gig,\" resonates with tales of resilience and the unyielding passion that propels him from one iconic stage to the next.\n\nIn conversation, Rivera reflects on the dichotomy of the sideman's role—essential yet often overlooked.\n\nThe term sideman for me is a double-edged sword,” Mark muses, recounting moments of both validation and vulnerability in a career adorned with legendary encounters. “I was a side person, so I was not a star, but I take great pride in being a sideman. When I told John Oates (from Hall & Oates) that I was leaving to go back with Billy and there was going to be another tour, I said ‘I’m sorry but I have to tell you and Daryl (Hall) that I’m going back out with Billy.’ And he said ‘I totally understand. You’re just a sideman.’ It kind of hurt because what he was saying was that I was very replaceable. But in the case of Ringo (Starr), being a sideman was the most powerful thing I could have been because when I finally went to those rehearsals, I was ready. I was ready to be in that band.\n\nSIDEMAN\n\nHis dedication to his craft and diplomacy, bridging divides and maintaining harmony, underscores his stature as a consummate professional.\n\nRivera's journey into the world of saxophone began with a serendipitous discovery that would shape his musical trajectory.\n\nGrowing up in the vibrant musical landscape of Brooklyn, New York, Rivera found himself drawn to the soulful sounds echoing through the streets. At the age of nine, his Uncle Vinny realized that Mark had perfect pitch when he'd sing along to songs while watching The Three Stooges. That paved the way for Uncle Vinny to teach him the saxophone.\n\nInspired by the raw emotion and improvisational freedom of jazz legends like Charlie Parker and Sonny Rollins, Rivera honed his craft with unwavering dedication, practicing tirelessly to master the instrument's nuances and expressive potential. This early passion laid the foundation for Rivera's future as a sought-after saxophonist, propelling him onto stages around the world and into the annals of rock 'n' roll history with artists like Billy Joel and Foreigner.\n\nThe narrative of Rivera's ascent intertwines with the broader tapestry of music history, where sidemen like him are the backbone of countless monumental acts. From the Eagles' genesis as Linda Ronstadt’s backing band to Toto's Grammy sweep, these artists—once in the shadows—emerged as icons in their own right.\n\nFor Rivera, every gig is a testament to both resilience and aspiration.\n\nYou never know how you'll get your next gig,\" he reflects, acknowledging the volatility inherent in his chosen path. “I mean it’s not an easy life. You’re always working towards that next gig and doing what you can to pay the rent. I mean I’ve been to the point where I had to remortgage my house.\n\nIt's a reality he's navigated with grit, weathering setbacks and seizing opportunities with equal fervor.\n\nMark Rivera's journey is not just a chronicle of gigs and recordings; it's a testament to the spirit of perseverance and passion that defines the unsung heroes of music—the sidemen who make magic happen, one note at a time.\n\nMEETING WITH MUTT\n\nMark Rivera's rock and roll odyssey took a thrilling turn when he aligned with Foreigner, the powerhouse band renowned for their anthemic hits and magnetic stage presence. It was a journey fueled by a friendship that blossomed into a pivotal collaboration years later.\n\nAfter touring with Sam & Dave in '74 and narrowly escaping a bandmate's fury, Rivera found himself in '75 joining forces with Tycoon, a rising band that caught the eye of major labels, including Clive Davis of Arista Records. Davis, with his keen eye for talent, signed them up but insisted on the band using a new producer, the unfamiliar Mutt Lange.\n\n\"Who the hell is Mutt Lange?\" the band wondered collectively, unaware of the future titan of rock production.\n\nThough Tycoon's debut album in '79, featuring the hit \"Such a Woman,\" didn't catapult them to stardom, Rivera's bond with Mutt Lange would soon prove priceless.\n\nIt all began with a pivotal phone call after a breathless climb up six flights of stairs after a night of relentless playing in a New York club. Rivera picked up, hearing the unmistakable voice: \"Hello, Markus. It's Mutt.\"\n\nRenowned for his work with AC/DC and Def Leppard, Lange recognized Rivera's talent, inviting him to Electric Ladyland Studios to contribute to Foreigner's groundbreaking album \"4.\" For Rivera, this session wasn't just another gig—it was a chance to etch his name in rock history alongside a band celebrated for their arena-rock anthems and soaring melodies.\n\n\"That,\" Rivera reflected in his memoir, \"was my initiation into the big leagues.\"\n\nThe phone call changed everything.\n\n\"Needless to say,\" Rivera chuckled, \"I was downstairs and in a cab before the receiver hit the cradle.\"\n\nAt Electric Ladyland, Rivera's saxophone added a new dimension to Foreigner's sound, blending seamlessly with the band's trademark guitars and Lou Gramm's distinctive vocals. His contributions on tracks like \"Urgent\" and \"Waiting for a Girl Like You\" elevated the album to new heights, showcasing his ability to inject soul and passion into every note. Collaborating with Lange proved to be a revelation for Rivera, who found himself not only performing but also learning from one of the industry's most visionary producers, setting the stage for future musical endeavors that would shape his career.\n\nFirst and foremost, Mick Jones and Lou Gramm are two of the most amazing songwriters in rock and roll,\" he said. \"There's no doubt about it The opportunities that they let me be a part of were just amazing. (Bass player) Rick Wills, who was a sideman himself, playing with (Peter Frampton) and a bunch of other bands, took me under his wing. They all did. It was a magical time for me.\n\nStepping into the hallowed confines of the studio, Mutt Lange queued up Foreigner’s latest, \"Urgent,\" and the air crackled with anticipation. As recounted in his candid memoir, the unmistakable hook of the track struck a chord with him immediately, prompting Mutt to turn to him with simple instructions. And as he says in his book, \"I'm being asked to somehow make the track even better.\"\n\nJunior Walker had already been earmarked for the song’s centerpiece solo, yet Mutt had a specific ask of Rivera: \"something coming out of the first and second chorus. Just a hook to tie it all together.” With that cryptic directive in mind, Rivera embarked on a sonic journey all his own, guided by instinct and the pulse of the music coursing through his veins.\n\nHours later, as the last echoes of Rivera's saxophone reverberated in the studio, a hush fell over the room. Mutt, Mick, and Lou exchanged knowing glances, their faces lighting up with genuine admiration. Rivera, recalling the moment with vivid clarity, shared in his memoir that he had simply \"played what was resonating in my bones.\"\n\nWhat ensued was nothing short of magic.\n\nI’d obviously passed the audition with Foreigner, and I don’t know if it was the following day or whatever but the next thing I knew, I was in the vocal booth helping them cut the background vocals,\" Rivera said in his biography. \"Mutt had said something like, 'Oh, and by the way, Mark’s a killer singer.' And that’s all it took.\n\nNot only did Rivera contribute to Foreigner's biggest selling album ever, but he was immediately asked to join them on the road.\n\nON THE ROAD WITH FOREIGNER\n\nStepping into the role of saxophonist and adding his signature backing vocals, Rivera brought a fresh dynamic to Foreigner’s powerhouse sound. His tenure with the band marked a period of creative synergy and musical exploration, as he seamlessly integrated his talents into their chart-topping repertoire.\n\nFor Rivera, joining Foreigner was more than just another gig; it was an opportunity to contribute to some of rock’s most enduring hits. His saxophone solo on \"Urgent,\" a standout track from their multi-platinum album \"4,\" remains a defining moment in his career and a highlight of the band’s live shows. Rivera’s ability to blend soulful melodies with rock edge added a new dimension to Foreigner’s live performances, captivating audiences worldwide and solidifying his reputation as a virtuoso sideman.\n\nTouring with Foreigner thrust Rivera into the whirlwind of rock stardom, where nights were spent on stage in front of thousands of fans, and days were a blur of travel and anticipation. His experiences on the road, chronicled with candor and humor in his memoir \"Sideman: In Pursuit of the Next Gig,\" offer a glimpse into the highs and lows of life as a touring musician. From the adrenaline rush of performing in arenas to the camaraderie forged with bandmates behind the scenes, Rivera’s journey with Foreigner epitomizes the thrill and sacrifice inherent in the pursuit of musical excellence.\n\nRivera's initiation into the whirlwind world of rock 'n' roll touring took an unexpected turn during his time with Foreigner, when he encountered the infamous minibar for the first time. That encounter with the minibar proved to be a costly lesson in the realities of life on the road.\n\n\"Mini bar takes your bonus and just crushes it,\" Rivera laughs.\n\nIn Rivera's rock 'n' roll odyssey, this particular episode would eventually morph into a comedic yarn. It was the summer of '81, and he found himself thrust into the whirlwind world of touring with Foreigner, his first taste of the big leagues. However, this newfound glory came with an unexpected caveat: a trail of seemingly complimentary bottles of refreshments that adorned the countertops of every posh European hotel they graced.\n\nLittle did Rivera know, those enticing bottles of liquid refreshment weren't quite the gratis treats he'd assumed them to be. As he soon discovered, each indulgence came with a not-so-subtle addition to his tab. What initially seemed like a perk of the rock star lifestyle turned out to be a lesson in the fine print of touring economics—one that left him chuckling at his rookie misadventures and scrambling for ways to reconcile those inadvertently accrued charges amidst the fervor of the road.\n\nI swear Chris, I would take these bottles. They were probably 16-ounce bottles and they were like $80,\" he said. \"I'm like, oh, in Europe they give you champagne. Thanks a lot. I thought it was free, but I found out real quick after the tour was over when I get the bill. It gives you an idea how green I was. Everything comes at a price. I mean the tour is over and they say they want to give me a bonus. I asked where was the rest of the bonus, they said it was in the minibar.\n\nBeyond the stage, Rivera’s collaboration with Foreigner left an indelible mark on rock history, influencing a generation of musicians and fans alike. His contributions to their live shows were not merely instrumental but pivotal, enhancing the band’s sonic palette and reaffirming his status as a linchpin in the rock and roll machine.\n\nToday, as Rivera continues to tour and share his musical prowess with audiences worldwide, his time with Foreigner stands as a testament to the enduring power of music to unite and inspire.\n\nJOINING BILLY’S BAND\n\nIn his vivid recollection penned within the pages of his memoir, Mark Rivera recounts a pivotal moment in his career—an audition that would shape his musical journey alongside Billy Joel.\n\nDoug Stegmeyer, then Billy’s bassist and musical director, handed Mark a cassette with a directive clear as day: \"Go home. Listen to ‘Just the Way You Are,’ ‘Only the Good Die Young,’ and ‘Say Goodbye to Hollywood.’ And learn the background vocals.\"\n\nArmed with this assignment, Mark entered the audition poised to impress.\n\nWe closed the set with 'Just the Way You Are.' I thought I had nailed it, but Billy stopped us right after the solo,\" Mark reminisced in his memoir. \"He walked over, looked at me with those warm eyes, and said, 'Come here.' Pulling me in close, he kissed me on the cheek and said, 'As long as you want a spot in my band, you got it.'\n\nWith those words, Mark Rivera secured his place among Joel's musical family.\n\nReflecting on his journey, Mark contrasted the tight-knit camaraderie of Billy Joel's band with his experience touring with Foreigner.\n\nComing off the road with Foreigner, it was just the four of us. They were the band,\" Mark mused. \"But with Billy's band, it felt like a true family. We were all so connected—me, Bobby Mayo, may he rest in peace, providing backing vocals and keyboard textures. It was a whole different world.\n\nRivera’s journey from auditions and tours to becoming an integral part of Billy Joel’s band underscores not only his musical prowess but also the transformative power of finding a true musical home—one where collaboration, respect, and familial bonds reign supreme. His narrative, etched in the annals of rock and roll history, serves as a testament to the enduring spirit of artistic kinship and the pursuit of musical excellence.\n\nRivera's inaugural tour with Billy Joel in 1982 on the Nylon Curtain Tour marked a transformative chapter in his storied career, capturing the essence of rock 'n' roll's dynamic energy and the intimate artistry of Joel's iconic performances.\n\nJoining Billy Joel on that first tour was like stepping into a whirlwind of musical brilliance and pure energy,\" he said. \"It wasn't just a tour, it was an amazing family. I am the only person left from that iteration. It think that is a testament to the enduring bond we've forged through music and friendship.\n\nJoining Joel's band as a versatile saxophonist and vocalist, Rivera seamlessly integrated his soulful sound into the fabric of Joel's timeless hits, from the anthemic \"Piano Man\" to the poignant \"New York State of Mind.\" Onstage, Rivera's presence was electric, his saxophone solos weaving effortlessly through Joel's melodic tapestries, while his backing vocals added depth and resonance to each performance.\n\nIt was a baptism by fire into the world of stadium rock, where Rivera's musical prowess and infectious stage presence endeared him to audiences worldwide, solidifying his place as a vital member of Billy Joel's legendary ensemble.\n\nBut this tour wasn't filled with all the frills or excesses that he had experienced on the Foreigner tour. He remembers Thanksgiving during that first tour and how much Billy showed he loved his band.\n\nSo on this particular flight, I was flying with my wife Sandra, who came out with me,\" he said. \"So we didn't have this big banquet like you'd expect. And here comes Billy with a small cardboard box asking 'What would you have, Mrs. Rivera? Can I interest you in a turkey sandwich? And you, sir, you'll have turkey as well. ' I mean Billy's a star and he's coming back with leftover turkey sandwiches. But that told me that he was mindful of what he had, as far as his band, and that he appreciated us. I've always seen Billy as a guy who appreciates, and loves his band.\n\nAs Joel's trusted saxophonist and backing vocalist, Rivera has been a fixture on Joel's global tours throughout the years, captivating audiences across continents.\n\nOne of the most memorable chapters in Rivera's journey with Billy Joel includes their groundbreaking tour of Russia, a historic event that resonated deeply with fans and cultural observers alike.\n\nAmidst the political and cultural shifts of the late 1980s, Rivera and Joel's performances in Moscow and Leningrad (now St. Petersburg) symbolized the power of music to bridge divides and unite audiences across borders. Rivera's contributions during this pivotal tour underscored his role not only as a musician but as a cultural ambassador, leaving an indelible mark on the landscape of international rock music.\n\nAnother landmark for Rivera was Billy Joel's historic residency at Madison Square Garden, which stands as a testament to his unparalleled musical legacy and enduring appeal.\n\nPerforming monthly at the iconic venue for over a decade, Joel captivated audiences with his timeless hits and magnetic stage presence. Rivera played an instrumental role in shaping the sound and energy of these legendary performances. His versatile talents on saxophone, guitar, and vocals added depth and richness to Joel's songs, elevating each concert to an unforgettable experience.\n\nWell Billy once said that as long as they keep putting asses in seats I'll keep playing,\" he said. \"And I think he figured maybe 20 shows, 30 shows, 40 shows, but it just kept going. It is tremendous. Madison Square Garden. There is nothing like it. Nothing at all. It is the most prestigious venue in the world. Everybody wants to play the Garden. I never get tired of walking on that stage in the Garden. It will always be home for us.\n\nTogether with Joel, Rivera shared in the magic of connecting with fans from across the globe, creating cherished memories and solidifying their place in the annals of music history. Their collaboration at Madison Square Garden not only marked a milestone in Joel's career but also exemplified the power of live music to unite and inspire audiences worldwide.\n\nHELLO RINGO\n\nBeyond Joel’s band, Rivera’s resume reads like a who’s who of rock royalty.\n\nFrom his collaboration with Peter Gabriel on the groundbreaking album \"So,\" where his saxophone elevated tracks like \"Sledgehammer\" and \"Big Time,\" to his memorable contributions to many Foreigner hit songs, Rivera’s versatility and adaptability shone brightly in every project he touched.\n\nBut it was a call in 1995 from a former Beatle that would give Rivera a new musical direction, literally.\n\nRivera's entry into Ringo Starr's All Starr Band marked a significant chapter in his illustrious career, solidifying his reputation not only as a versatile musician but also as a capable musical director.\n\nInitially joining as a saxophonist and vocalist, Rivera quickly impressed Ringo with his ability to seamlessly integrate into the ensemble's dynamic lineup of rock royalty. His tenure took a transformative turn when he assumed the role of musical director, a position that underscored his deep understanding of performance dynamics and his knack for orchestrating cohesive, memorable shows.\n\nAs musical director, Rivera's influence extends far beyond his instrumental prowess; he plays a pivotal role in shaping the band's sonic identity and live performances. From curating setlists that blend Starr's timeless Beatles classics with the diverse solo catalogues of his bandmates to guiding rehearsals with precision and finesse, Rivera's leadership ensures each All Starr Band tour is a captivating journey through rock history.\n\nThe term sideman can have a very negative connotation, but in this certain circumstance working with Ringo, my being a sideman was the most powerful thing I could have,\" he said. \"I had learned all those songs in the past , so by the time I went to rehearsals, I was ready to be in that band. I think that one of the most important things in being a musical director is the ability to communicate. So when I was with all these giants, I felt really incredibly comfortable. So I guess that sideman place was where I was born to live.\n\nHis dual role as a trusted collaborator and creative force behind the scenes underscores his commitment to honoring the legacy of rock icons while injecting fresh energy into every note played onstage.\n\nIn Mark Rivera's memoir, the rock 'n' roll journey unfolds like a symphony of highs, lows, and unforgettable encounters with the legends of music.
