        "text": "(born 1942). As a member of the Beatles, Paul McCartney wrote and performed songs that revitalized popular and critical interest in rock and roll. After the group broke up, he further secured his importance in music history through his work with Wings and as a solo artist.\n\nJames Paul McCartney was born on June 18, 1942, in Liverpool, England. He learned to play the piano by ear in his youth and bought his first guitar as a teenager. He joined the Quarrymen in 1956 and began writing songs with the group’s founder, John Lennon. The band, which changed names several times, signed a recording contract in 1962 as the Beatles. McCartney served primarily as a bassist and vocalist, singing the lead on “Yesterday” (1965), “Penny Lane” (1967), “Hey Jude” (1968), and many others.\n\nLennon and McCartney wrote most of the group’s material, including its first single, “Love Me Do” (1962); its first British chart-topper, “Please Please Me” (1963); and the 1966 Grammy award winner for best song, “Michelle.” In the later years of the Beatles, many songs were written by one or the other, but they upheld their original agreement to attach both names to all compositions.\n\nThe Beatles won an Academy award for best original song score for Let It Be (1970), their last film before disbanding. That same year, the solo effort McCartney was released, featuring the song “Maybe I’m Amazed.” In 1971, McCartney collaborated with his wife, Linda (born Linda Louise Eastman, Sept. 24, 1942, Scarsdale, N.Y.; died April 17, 1998, Tucson, Ariz.), on Ram. The two went on to found the group Wings, which recorded the hit songs “My Love” (1973), “Listen to What the Man Said” (1975), “Silly Love Songs” (1976), and “With a Little Luck” (1978). Wings won a 1974 Grammy for best pop vocal performance by a duo or group for “Band on the Run.” With Wings collaborator Denny Laine, McCartney wrote “Mull of Kintyre” (1977), the first single ever to sell 2 million copies in Britain. A retrospective of the group’s work entitled Wingspan: Hits and History was released in 2001.\n\nMcCartney returned to a solo career with albums such as McCartney II (1980), Press to Play (1986), Flowers in the Dirt (1989), Off the Ground (1993), and Flaming Pie (1997). Other projects included recording duets with Stevie Wonder (“Ebony and Ivory,” 1982) and Michael Jackson (“The Girl Is Mine,” 1982, and “Say Say Say,” 1983), scripting and starring in the musical film Give My Regards to Broad Street (1984), and writing the classical work Liverpool Oratorio (1991).\n\nDuring the course of his career, McCartney was honored with many awards. In addition to the numerous Grammy awards he received for his work with the Beatles and with Wings, McCartney received a lifetime achievement award from the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences in 1990. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame twice—in 1988, with the other Beatles, and in 1999 as a solo artist. In 1997 he was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II."
