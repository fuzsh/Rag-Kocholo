        "text": "Biography\n\nJames Paul McCartney was born on June 18, 1942, in Liverpool. His father was also named James, and his mother was Mary. Soon, another son was born, Mike (whose actual name is Peter). The family had probably the best relationship of all the young Beatles' families. But on October 31, 1956, Mary died of breast cancer. Paul's immediate reaction was: \"What will we do without her money?\" He was kidding, of course. He wrote his first song then, \"I Lost My Little Girl,\" and devoted his life to music.\n\nHe wrote many hits for the Beatles, including \"Hey Jude,\" \"Let it Be,\" and others. After the Beatles, he released two solo albums, one with Linda. He then formed Wings, a band that should simply be considered Paul, Linda, Denny Laine, and a backing band, for the band went through so many line-ups. Wings broke up in 1980.\n\nPaul released a few albums in the mid-80s, with little quality or success. In 1989, his Flowers in the Dirt came out, and he embarked on a world tour.\n\nSadly, in April 1998, his wife of almost 30 years, Linda, passed away of the same disease that killed his mother, breast cancer. He soon found love in model Heather Mills, who he married June 11, 2002."
