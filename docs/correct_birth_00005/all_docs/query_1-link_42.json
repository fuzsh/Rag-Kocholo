Click to download the free sample version Download sample\n\nTable of Contents\n\nPaul McCartney is a singer-songwriter, and former member of the legendary band, the Beatles. He is also a well-known performer and one of the most successful soloists who remains active in the music industry today.\n\nSee the fact file below for more information on Paul McCartney or alternatively, you can download our 35-page Paul McCartney worksheet pack to utilise within the classroom or home environment.\n\nKey Facts & Information\n\nEarly Life\n\nJames Paul McCartney, or more popularly known as Paul McCartney, was born on June 18, 1942, in Liverpool, England, at Walton Hospital, where his mother had qualified as a maternity nurse.\n\nPaul was the eldest child of Mary Patricia and James McCartney.\n\nHe has a younger brother named Peter Michael and a step-sister, Ruth.\n\nHis father, a cotton merchant, a trumpet player, and a pianist, encouraged Paul to study music, but Paul preferred to learn to play instruments by ear.\n\nFrom 1947–1949, he attended Stockton Wood Road Primary School and then transferred to Joseph Williams Junior School.\n\nHe entered the Liverpool Institute grammar school in 1953 as he was one of only three of 90 students who passed the 11-Plus exam.\n\nAfter a year, he met and became good friends with his schoolmate George Harrison who later became his bandmate.\n\nPaul’s mother died when he was just 14 due to a complication after surgery for breast cancer.\n\nPaul had auditioned for the Liverpool Cathedral choir but was not accepted.\n\nHowever, he was able to join the St. Barnabas’ Church choir.\n\nWhen rock and roll became a popular music genre, he exchanged the nickel-plated trumpet he had received from his father for an acoustic guitar as he wanted to sing while playing the instrument.\n\nAt first, it was difficult for him to play the guitar right-handed, but inspired by a Slim Whitman concert poster that showed he was left-handed, he reversed the strings on his instrument.\n\nDuring the 1950s, Paul McCartney excelled in his art assignments, earning him recognition for his works, but his academic record was affected due to his lack of discipline; thereby, hindering him from entering an art school.\n\nMarriage\n\nPaul McCartney had prior relationships before marrying his wife, Linda Eastman.\n\nHe had a two-and-a-half-year relationship with Dot Rhone and a five-year relationship with Jane Asher.\n\nLinda Eastman was Paul’s first wife.\n\nShe was a popular photographer with various rock bands.\n\nShe met the Beatles in 1966 at Shea Stadium and was initially a fan of John Lennon.\n\nOn May 15, 1967, Linda and Paul were first formally introduced at The Bag O’ Nails club during a George Fame concert.\n\nIn March 1969, they married and had four children, namely Heather (who was Linda’s daughter adopted by Paul), Mary (named after Paul’s mother), Stella (named after Linda’s grandmother), and their youngest, James.\n\nThe couple lived a vegetarian life and were animal rights activists.\n\nHowever, Linda died in 1998 due to breast cancer, and Paul had to seek help from a counselor to cope with his loss.\n\nPaul McCartney remarried in 2002 to former model Heather Mills. They separated in April 2006 and divorced in March 2008.\n\nThey had a daughter named Beatrice Milly.\n\nHeather was an active anti-landmine campaigner, and during their married life, Paul joined her campaigns.\n\nOn October 9, 2011, Paul married his third wife, Nancy Shevell, in a civil and intimate wedding.\n\nNancy Shevell works in the transportation industry, being the vice president of the Shevell Group and was a former board member of the New York’s Metropolitan Transportation Authority.\n\nShe was 18 years younger than Paul and had known him for several years since both owned houses in the Hamptons.\n\nHumanitarian Works\n\nPaul and Linda were both animal-rights supporters, and upon her death, Paul continued to join and support different animal-rights campaigns and organizations.\n\nWith him joining Heather Mills in her anti-landmine campaigns, Paul became a patron of Adopt-A-Minefield.\n\nPaul actively joined various campaigns; he was also an advocate for providing the needs of children with diseases and disorders, and he supported the eradication of poverty.\n\nApart from the campaigns that Paul supported, he participated in charity events, benefit concerts and donated his songs and sales to different causes.\n\nCareer\n\nPaul McCartney idolized Little Richard, and he loved the American rhythm and blues music genre that influenced his music.\n\nHis music was also inspired by artists like Elvis Presley, Buddy Holly, Carl Perkins, and Chuck Berry.\n\nHis first written and guitar-composed song was “I Lost My Little Girl;” he also created “When I’m Sixty Four” for the piano.\n\nHe joined a talent contest at Butlin’s Filey Holiday Camp and performed “Long Tall Sally” in his first-ever public performance.\n\nJohn Lennon and his band named the Quarryman first met Paul McCartney on July 6, 1957, and had soon invited Paul to become their rhythm guitarist.\n\nJohn and Paul developed a close working relationship and close friendship, as they both empathized with the untimely death of their mothers.\n\nIn 1958, George Harrison also joined the band as lead guitarist and Stuart Sutcliffe in 1960 as bassist.\n\nThey had come up with many different band names until August 1960, when they settled with the “Beatles.”\n\nIn the same year, Pete Best also joined them as a drummer.\n\nShortly after, Stuart Sutcliffe left the band to pursue his art career, and although he was hesitant, Paul McCartney replaced him.\n\nWhen they performed as a backup band for one of Tony Sheridan’s songs, they caught the attention of Brian Epstein.\n\nIn January 1962, he started managing them under the EMI- Parlophone label.\n\nTheir drummer, Pete Best, was known for his looks rather than his talent.\n\nUnambitious enough, the band decided to replace him with a permanent member, Ringo Starr, who used to be his stand-in drummer.\n\nPaul and John were the songwriters of the group.\n\nFrom October 1962 to May 1970, the two had published about 180 songs.\n\nDuring the years that the Beatles was active, they released hit songs such as “Love Me Do,” “I Saw Her Standing There,” “She Loves You,” “I Want to Hold Your Hand,” and “Can’t Buy Me Love,” which were all co-written by John and Paul.\n\nTheir fans rapidly increased and their hysteria became known as Beatlemania.\n\nThey also released Paul’s composition “Yesterday,” which is one of the most covered songs in music history.\n\nHowever, with their increasing popularity, the group also faced misunderstandings, and there was a growing feud between John and Paul.\n\nDespite their differences, they continued performing as a group.\n\nMusic produced by the Beatles was not limited to ballads and love songs; they also released songs from other genres, which featured on their 1966 album “Revolver.”\n\nTheir last live show was also in 1966, but they continued making albums and music.\n\nThe death of their manager, Brian Epstein, in August 1966 left the band anxious about their career and their future.\n\nPaul McCartney filled in the position as manager and acting leader of the band.\n\nThe band produced a film entitled “Magical Mystery Tour” that Paul mainly directed.\n\nThe soundtrack received praise, but unfortunately, the film received critical responses from the public.\n\nAn animated film of the Beatles based on Paul’s 1966 composition “Yellow Submarine” was also released, but unlike their former songs, the popularity of the music from this film was short-lived.\n\nDespite the band’s success, the feud among the members continued causing a lapse in their relationship.\n\nThe famous album “Abbey Road” was the last one they released.\n\nUpon the disbandment of the Beatles, Paul McCartney became depressed, and his wife was there to help him; he made a come-back as a soloist.\n\nHis first album, “McCartney,” released in 1970, gained so much popularity that it became a top-selling album in the U.S.\n\nHis second album, “Ram”, also became a hit album after the release of “McCartney.”\n\nHe formed the band Wings together with Linda McCartney, Denny Laine, Denny Seiwell, and Henry McCullough.\n\nTheir first concert performance was at the University of Nottingham in 1972.\n\nIn the 1970s, the Wings concert tour became the best-selling pop act beating Elton John’s record.\n\nOver time, the members changed, but Wings remained successful and achieved several accomplishments.\n\nIn 1981, Paul decided to take a new music career path and eventually disbanded when Denny Laine quit due to issues about royalties and salaries.\n\nPaul McCartney continued performing solo with several opportunities to showcase and expand his musical abilities and talent.\n\nPaul had the chance to collaborate with many notable musicians such as Stevie Wonder and Michael Jackson, performed in concerts, wrote and co-wrote several compositions, released more songs, starred in a musical and even ventured into orchestral music.\n\nPaul took a four-year hiatus in his solo career to complete Apple’s “Beatles Anthology” with George Harrison, Ringo Starr, and George Martin.\n\nHe continued releasing albums, performing unannounced at his late wife’s concert tribute, “Concert for Linda.”\n\nPaul is famous as a versatile artist and for his ability to play different instruments and create chart-topping songs despite being unable to read music or understand musical theory.\n\nPaul McCartney remains an active solo performer who has an exceptional influence in the music industry.\n\nArt\n\nIn 1983, Paul began studying painting and held an exhibition in 1999 in Siegen Germany featuring portraits of John Lennon, Andy Warhol, and David Bowie.\n\nHe also wrote and published books such as “Blackbird Singing” (Faber & Faber), “High in the Clouds: An Urban Furry Tail,” “The Observer,” and “Hey Grandude!”\n\nHe produced, directed, and hosted various shows such as “Rupert and the Frog Song” and “Tropic Island Hum,” “The Real Buddy Holly Story,” and “Grateful Dead.”\n\nDrug Abuse\n\nThe members of the Beatles were said to use drugs during their performances to keep their energy high when they were performing for long hours.\n\nPaul took various drugs and became the first member to discuss the issue with the public.\n\nHe was fined a couple of times and arrested for drug possession.\n\nHe was also convicted for illegal cultivation because he grew marijuana plants on his farm.\n\nIn 2015, he quit cannabis because he wanted to become an example for his grandchildren.\n\nJohn Lennon and Paul McCartney\n\nIn 1980, upon the death of John Lennon, Paul McCartney was mobbed by reporters when he was leaving the recording studio.\n\nReporters asked him for his reaction, to which he replied, “It’s a drag.”\n\nHe received criticism for his response but explained himself by saying that he meant no disrespect and that he was just unable to express his feelings due to shock and sadness.\n\nPaul McCartney could only cry on the evening of John Lennon’s passing, and he also mentioned that his death brought fear to the former members of the Beatles.\n\nIn 1981, Paul joined George Harrison’s tribute to John Lennon and sang “All Those Years Ago” as a backup with Ringo Starr playing the drums.\n\nPaul also released a song in 1982 entitled “Here Today,” a tribute song to his and John’s friendship.\n\nAchievements\n\nPaul McCartney garnered various awards and achievements throughout his career as a soloist and member of the Beatles.\n\nTwo of his achievements include being admitted to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and being listed twice in the “Guinness Book of Records” as the most honored composer and performer in music and as the most successful songwriter.\n\nHis songs were always chart-toppers, and some of his most notable recognitions include: a knighthood from Queen Elizabeth II and Legion d’Honneur for services in music, gaining a star in the Hollywood Walk of fame, being presented an Honorary Fellowship of the Royal College of Music by Prince Charles, and appointed as a Member of the Order of the British Empire.\n\nPaul McCartney Worksheets\n\nThis is a fantastic bundle that includes everything you need to know about Paul McCartney across 35 in-depth pages.
