        "text": "The former Walton Hospital site, the birthplace of The Beatles’ Sir Paul McCartney, could be turned into homes and an Aldi supermarket under new plans to regenerate the site.\n\nAldi has notified local residents that it plans to build a new store on the 4.75-hectare site along with a residential development that would allow fans of the Beatles to live at the birthplace of the Liverpool icon. Plans for the homes have not been released but a public consultation into the scheme will be launched next week for local residents to have their say.\n\nThe former Walton Hospital on Rice Lane, where Sir Paul was born and where his mother, Mary, worked as a nurse, was demolished in 2011 to make way for a new £25m mental health facility. However, adjacent land to the facility has been earmarked for homes, with planning permission for 137 new homes approved in 2012.\n\nA new application is expected for the site once the public consultation is complete.\n\nSir Paul was born in the hospital in 1942 but the facility closed its doors in 2011 after several services were moved to nearby facility, The Walton Centre. The landmarks occupied by the Beatles during their early lives and career have proved popular with homeowners before, with Sir Paul’s childhood home sold for £150,000 in just six minutes at an auction this year."
