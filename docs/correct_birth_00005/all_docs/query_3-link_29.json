        "text": "Who’s the guy with Jersey connections helping Paul McCartney write his new autobiography, “The Lyrics: 1956 to the Present”?\n\nIt’s Pulitzer Prize-winning poet Paul Muldoon, a native of Ireland and long-time Princeton-area resident. Muldoon is the editor and contributes the introduction to “The Lyrics,” which recounts McCartney's “life and art through the prism of 154 songs from all stages of his career – from his earliest boyhood compositions through the legendary decade of the Beatles, to Wings and his solo albums to the present,” according to McCartney’s rep.\n\nMuldoon is a professor at Princeton University who invited the Beatle to his “How to Write a Song” class.\n\n“Based on conversations I had with Paul McCartney over a five-year period, these commentaries are as close to an autobiography as we may ever come,” said Muldoon in a statement. “His insights into his own artistic process confirm a notion at which we had but guessed — that Paul McCartney is a major literary figure who draws upon, and extends, the long tradition of poetry in English.”\n\n“More often than I can count, I’ve been asked if I would write an autobiography, but the time has never been right,” said McCartney in a statement. “The one thing I’ve always managed to do, whether at home or on the road, is to write new songs. I know that some people, when they get to a certain age, like to go to a diary to recall day-to-day events from the past, but I have no such notebooks. What I do have are my songs, hundreds of them, which I’ve learned serve much the same purpose. And these songs span my entire life.”\n\nMore: Paul McCartney sighting: An 'awesome' moment with a Beatle on Main Street in Metuchen\n\nMore: Paul McCartney sings Beatles classic at Jersey City party\n\nMore: Disciple of Soul Marc Ribler of Asbury Park enlists Little Steven to co-produce new album\n\nMuldoon’s rocker creds include writing lyrics for the Handsome Family and with the late Warren Zevon. The song “My Ride’s Here,” by Muldoon and Zevon, has been performed by another Jersey songwriter of note, Bruce Springsteen.\n\nMuldoon, who now lives in New York state, has been bringing the jams to Jersey venues for the last decade or so with bands like Rackett, Wayside Shrines and Rogue Oliphant. His collaborators include Chris Harford, a renowned singer-songwriter from Princeton, and Ray Kubian, New Brunswick drummer extraordinaire, who’s played with the Naughty Clouds, Electric Six, the Dean Ween Group, Mars Needs Women and more.\n\nMcCartney has been as regular in New Jersey in the last few years. He was spotted taking pictures in downtown Metuchen in February 2020. His wife, Nancy Shevell, is an Edison native, the township that surrounds Metuchen. Her family owned the Elizabeth-based New England Motor Freight trucking company for several decades.\n\nAlso in Jersey, the rocker sang “I Saw Her Standing There” at the Hudson House in Jersey City in November 2019 at a New England Motor Freight party and he, Shevell and his in-laws had dinner at Jimmy’s Italian Restaurant in Asbury Park in 2017.\n\nIn 2010, the couple attended the annual Rutgers Chabad National Founders Dinner at the Hyatt in New Brunswick. Shevell’s father was one of the night’s honorees.\n\nMcCartney was also a regular at the New England Motor Freight holiday parties at the company’s headquarters in Elizabeth.\n\nThe memoir is nearly 1,000 pages and the list price is $100. It's due in November.\n\nSubscribe to app.com for the latest on the Jersey music scene.\n\nChris Jordan, a Jersey Shore native, covers entertainment and features for the USA Today Network New Jersey.
