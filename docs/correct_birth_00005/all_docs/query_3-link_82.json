        "text": "Paul McCartney, the legendary musician and member of The Beatles, will present photographs from his personal collection in an exhibition at the Brooklyn Museum opening this spring. The exhibition, titled “Paul McCartney Photographs 1963–64: Eyes of the Storm,” will showcase over 250 photographs, documenting the early years of The Beatles during the Beatlemania era. The show is scheduled to run from May 3rd to August 18th.\n\nOriginally shown at the National Portrait Gallery in London last October, the exhibition features photographs taken by McCartney during The Beatles’s first tour in 1963–64. These images—accompanied by video clips and other archival materials—provide an intimate look at the band’s rapid rise to fame. Specifically, it traces The Beatles’s path from their first performances in London in March 1963 to their appearance on the Ed Sullivan Show in February 1964.\n\n“Since first arriving in New York in February 1964, Paul McCartney has built a strong, everlasting connection to the city,” said Catherine Futter, director of curatorial affairs and senior curator of decorative arts at the Brooklyn Museum. “His vibrant photographs from The Beatles’s first visit capture the energy of the city, the excitement of the American fans, and the frenzy of the band’s status as celebrities. Yet the images also record The Beatles’s fun and delight with each other. Through McCartney’s lens, we feel the intensity of being at the center of such extraordinary events.”\n\nCurated by McCartney himself, along with Rosie Broadley, senior curator at for the National Portrait Gallery, and Sarah Brown, the photographic curator of his music publishing business MPL Communications, the exhibition will also serve as a historical archive. It offers a glimpse into the personal moments McCartney shared with John Lennon, George Harrison, and Ringo Starr."
