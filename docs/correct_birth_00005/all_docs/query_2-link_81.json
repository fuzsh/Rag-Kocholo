        "text": "Biography\n\nPaul McCartney was born on June 18th 1942. He grew up with a Irish Catholic dad and an English Protestant mom.\n\nSir Paul McCartney is a key figure in contemporary culture as a singer, composer, poet, writer, artist, humanitarian, entrepreneur, and holder of more than 3 thousand copyrights. He is in the \"Guinness Book of World Records\" for most records sold, most #1s (shared), most covered song, \"Yesterday\" largest paid audience for a solo concert (350,000 people, in 1989, in Brazil). He is considered one of the most successful entertainers of all time.\n\nHe plays the bass, guitar, piano, drums, the keyboard, the ukulele and the mandolin.The genres he performs are rock, psychedelic rock, experimental rock, rock and roll, pop, hard rock and classical music. He joined the Beatles through some friends of John Lennon and joined his first band the Quarrymen. Paul later introduced George Harrison. The first instruments he learned to play were the piano and the trumpet and later he got a guitar. Paul couldn't read music but he memorized tunes and was left handed so he flipped his instrument around. When the Beatles split up he made a successful solo career with his band called the Wings. Aside from the Beatles and the Wings he associated with bands such as the Fireman, the Quarrymen, Linda McCartney, Denny Lane and Michael Jackson. To this day Paul McCartney still performs music at his rather old age.\n\nComics\n\nThe Beatles have appeared in many various comic books and those comic books have become very rare. Most Beatles fanatics strive to collect some or all of these rare issues.\n\nIn 1969, Gold Key/Western Publishing published a movie comic called Beatles: Yellow Submarine based off their movie of the name \"Yellow Submarine\". The art was done by Jose Delbo and it was written by Paul S. Newman and is 64 pages long. This is probably one of the more notable one of their comic books, as it was written based of their movie.\n\nIn 2010, Paul McCartney is written into The Beatles Experience, a complete history and biography of the Beatles. The information for this was meticulously researched and taken from thousands of interviews and pictures. Mike Sagara and Stuart Immonen ink the pages of this book, and cover the Beatles' lives from their birth to past their breakup. A timeline is featured on each page and shows the events of their lives in chronological order. Paul McCartney and the other three Beatles have their lives written in extreme detail and the book includes an encyclopedia background and footnotes detailing related events happening in the world at that time."
