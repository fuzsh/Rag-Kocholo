        "text": "Click Here: Photos from Paul McCartney on the Hollywood Walk of Fame\n\nLOS ANGELES – On Feb. 9, 1964, The Beatles appeared on “The Ed Sullivan Show” for the first time, sending a nation already gripped by Beatlemania to unprecedented levels as more than 70 million American men, women and children tuned in.\n\nA week later, “I Want to Hold Your Hand” hit the top of the Billboard singles chart as the 45s were flying off the shelves at a rate of 10,000 an hour – and that was just in New York City.\n\nForty-eight years later to the day, Beatle Paul McCartney, still a potent force on the sales charts, and who remains one of the hottest live acts in music, finally got his star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame before hundreds of enraptured fans. In Hollywood on Thursday, Beatlemania lived again.\n\nMcCartney’s management team and the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce that oversees the Walk of Fame worked for years to get a date when he’d be available to publically unveil his star in front of the iconic stack of records-shaped Capitol Records building on Vine Avenue next to the stars of his fellow Beatles, John Lennon, Ringo Starr, and George Harrison.\n\nIt worked out because McCartney is in town for various Grammy functions. He’s being feted as its MusiCares Person of the Year tonight at a gala dinner at the Los Angeles Convention Center, and he’ll be performing during Sunday’s televised Grammy Awards. Also, he’s promoting his collection of his versions of favorite songs he grew up loving in Liverpool, “Kisses on the Bottom,” his first new studio album in five years.\n\nMcCartney, appearing considerably younger than his 69 years with his dyed hair longer than it has been in several years, looked casual in blue jeans, blue shirt, black comfy shoes & black jacket, and looking cool behind a pair of shades. He arrived with wife Nancy and musician son James.\n\nWith his friends Joe Walsh of the Eagles and former ELO and Traveling Wilbury Jeff Lynne standing with him, the 69-year-old Beatle’s pal, Neil Young, addressed the throng, saying, “Paul’s craft and his heart is at the top of its game. It’s his soul that comes out in his music that makes me feel so good.”\n\nOf the honor, McCartney, the most successful songwriter and performer in music history, gave credit to his fellow Beatles before telling the crowd, “Way back in history, back in Liverpool, when we were kids listening to Buddy Holly, I would never have thought that I’d be getting a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. That was an impossible thing to happen. But, here we are today, and it’s happening.”\n\nThe event drew McCartney and Beatles fans of all ages. Rachel Pinckney, 38, of South Pasadena, didn’t want to miss this. “It’s very exciting,” she said. “I know this will be a memorable moment.”\n\nForty-six-year-old Daniel Saavedra of Monrovia is a lifelong Beatlemaniac. “I’ve been a Beatles fan since I was a young teenager,” he said. Saavedra brought his 16-year-old son, Matt, who, he said, was also a longtime fan of the Fab Four. “Being here for this is a life-changing experience,” Matt said. “The Beatles have been a big factor in my life since I was two years old.”\n\nComing to the star unveiling was a no-brainer for 20-year-old Beatles lover Cathy Vasquez of Pasadena. She simply said, “Paul is my favorite Beatle.”"
