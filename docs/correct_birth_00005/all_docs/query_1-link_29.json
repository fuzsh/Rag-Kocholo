        "text": "Paul Mccartney Biography\n\nEnglish singer, songwriter, and musician Sir James Paul McCartney rose to international prominence as the co-lead vocalist, co-composer, and bassist for the Beatles. One of the greatest writers and performers of all time, he is renowned for his melodic bass playing, wide vocal range in the tenor range, and musical eclecticism, which includes influences like classical music and electronica as well as pre-rock ‘n’ roll pop. His songwriting collaboration with John Lennon continues to be the most popular in history.\n\nJames McCartney was conceived on June 18, 1942, at Walton Hospital in Liverpool’s Walton neighborhood. As a teenager, McCartney taught himself to play the piano, the guitar, and write songs after being inspired by his jazz musician father and rock and roll artists like Little Richard and Buddy Holly. On the Zenith, McCartney wrote his first song, “I Lost My Little Girl,” and on the piano, he created another early composition that would become “When I’m Sixty-Four.” Little Richard, an American rhythm and blues musician, was an influence on him as a young boy. McCartney’s first public performance of “Long Tall Sally” was at a talent competition for Butlin’s Filey summer camp.\n\nHe started his career in 1957 when he joined John Lennon’s skiffle band, the Quarrymen, which later became the Beatles in 1960. McCartney, sometimes referred to as “the cute Beatle,” eventually became associated with the London avant-garde and led the charge to include experimental aesthetics into the Beatles’ studio recordings. He progressively ascended to the position of de facto band leader beginning with the 1967 release of Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band, serving as the catalyst for the majority of the group’s musical and cinematic endeavors. His tunes by the Beatles, including “And I Love Her,” “Yesterday,” “Eleanor Rigby,” and “Blackbird,” are among the most covered songs in music history.\n\nHe made his solo debut with the 1970 release McCartney, and with Denny Laine and his first wife Linda, he founded the band Wings. Wings, under McCartney’s direction, was one of the most popular bands of the 1970s, with more than a dozen songs and albums that reached the top 10 worldwide. In 1980, he started up again, and since 1989, he has been on the road performing solo. His UK or US number-one singles without Wings include “Uncle Albert/Admiral Halsey” (with Linda), “Coming Up”, “Pipes of Peace”, “Ebony and Ivory” (featuring Stevie Wonder), and “Say Say Say” (with Michael Jackson). Aside from music, he has contributed to initiatives to support international charities focused on issues including animal rights, land mines, vegetarianism, poverty, and music education.\n\nMcCartney had 25.5 million RIAA-certified units sold in the US as of 2009 and has written or co-authored 32 songs that have peaked at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100. His accolades include two inductions into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame (as a member of the Beatles in 1988 and as a solo artist in 1999), an Academy Award, 18 Grammy Awards, a designation as a Member of the Order of the British Empire in 1965, and a knighthood for services to music in 1997. He also received an Academy Award and an appointment to the Order of the British Empire in 1965. He is one of the richest musicians in the world as of 2020, according to estimates that put his net worth at £800 million.\n\nPaul Mccartney Discography\n\nTop Videos\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nHow Many Number 1 Songs Does Paul Mccartney Have?\n\nPaul McCartney has had 32 Number 1 songs on the Billboard Hot 100 chart.\n\nWhat Is Paul Mccartney’S Best Selling Album?\n\nPaul McCartney’s best selling album is “Band on the Run” which was released in 1973.
