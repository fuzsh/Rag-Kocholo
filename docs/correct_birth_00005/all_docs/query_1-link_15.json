        "text": "The initiative has been set up by Paul and his brother\n\nBefore they were famous, Paul McCartney and John Lennon spent many hours in Paul's childhood home playing music and the house has become known as the birthplace of The Beatles. Now up and coming musicians will get to use the space to work on their own music as part of a new initiative.\n\nThe music legend has opened his former home with the hope that it will inspire unsigned artists while providing them with a space to write and perform.\n\nNamed after the house's location at 20 Forthlin Road in Liverpool, the exciting new programme is called The Forthlin Sessions. Although it has been many years since Paul lived there, the site still holds special significance for The Beatles fans, and was a place of inspiration and creativity. Paul and John created many songs together in that house including 'When I'm 64' and 'I Saw Her Standing There'.\n\nIt has been owned by the National Trust since 1995 and became a listed building in 2012.\n\nThe initiative is also backed by Paul's brother Mike, and he will be involved in choosing artists to get involved in the project.\n\nSpeaking to Sky News, Mike opened up about bringing people into his childhood home: \"This house to me, is a house of hope. And I hope it will be for the young people that come through the doors.\n\n\"I think it’s a brilliant idea, inviting young people to this house and giving them the opportunity of doing the same as us, coming from nothing and seeing where it takes them.”\n\nHe also reflected on hearing Paul and John practice together: “I would be in the other room learning photography, but whilst I’m doing all that I could hear guitar noises coming from this room.\n\n\"In there were what turned out to be two of the world’s greatest songwriters, McCartney and Lennon. They were rehearsing from a school book on the floor, that’s why this house is so unique.”\n\nTake a look through these musician's childhood homes:\n\nPaul McCartney is set to take to the stage this June as he has been confirmed as the headline act at Glastonbury 2022. The last time he played at the venue was 2004, and it was a massive performance full of Wings and Beatles hits.\n\nNow Read:\n\nPaul McCartney reveals what it was like taking his kids on tour\n\nPaul McCartney explains why he will no longer sign autographs\n\nRingo Starr and Paul McCartney recall their last meeting with George Harrison\n\nHow to listen to Greatest Hits Radio:\n\nListen to Greatest Hits Radio on the free Rayo app, online or on your DAB digital radio. You can also listen on your smart speaker by saying “Play Greatest Hits Radio”."
