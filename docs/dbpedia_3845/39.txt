In the United States Army, a medical brigade (MED BDE) is a unit providing command and control for assigned or attached medical units at Corps level. One MED BDE is typically assigned to one Army Corps and a typical Headquarters and Headquarters Detachment (HHD) for a MED BDE consists of about 65 personnel.[1]

Operations[]

A MED BDE tasks and organizes its medical assets on the battlefield. It plans Health Service Support (HSS) operations and oversees logistical operations for the groupâ€™s units. It serves as a radio control net for group units and performs medical regulation between group units. It also coordinates external support for group units.
