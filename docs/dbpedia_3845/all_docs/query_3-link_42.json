        "text": "What was a Field Ambulance?\n\nThe Field Ambulance was a mobile front line medical unit (it was not a vehicle), manned by troops of the Royal Army Medical Corps. Most Field Ambulances came under command of a Division, and each had special responsibility for the care of casualties of one of the Brigades of the Division. The theoretical capacity of the Field Ambulance was 150 casualties, but in battle many would need to deal with very much greater numbers. The Field Ambulance was responsible for establishing and operating a number of points along the casualty evacuation chain, from the Bearer Relay Posts which were up to 600 yards behind the Regimental Aid Posts in the front line, taking casualties rearwards through an Advanced Dressing Station (ADS) to the Main Dressing Station (MDS). It also provided a Walking Wounded Collecting Station, as well as various rest areas and local sick rooms. The Field Ambulances would usually establish 1 ADS per Brigade, and 1 MDS for the Division.\n\nImperial War Museum image Q4257. The official caption for this photograph is “an Advanced Dressing Station near Ginchy, September 1916” but the accuracy of this is doubtful. The exposed position, stretchers and cans of water suggest that it may be a stretcher bearer relay post situated between the front line and the ADS, which although often improvised in terms of its location and construction was a more substantial and better equipped post than shown here.\n\nComposition and organisation\n\nWhen it was at full strength a Field Ambulance was composed of 10 officers and 224 men. It was divided into three Sections. In turn, those Sections had Stretcher Bearer and Tented subsections. RAMC officers and men did not carry weapons or ammunition.\n\n“A” Section:\n\n65 in total\n\n1 Lieutenant-Colonel, in command of the Ambulance and A Section\n\n1 Captain or Lieutenant in command of Stretcher Bearer subsection\n\n1 Sergeant and 1 Corporal\n\n1 Bugler\n\n3 Privates (wagon orderlies) and 36 Privates (bearers)\n\n1 Captain or Lieutenant in command of Tent subsection\n\n1 Quartermaster, 1 Sergeant-Major, 2 Sergeants, 2 Corporals\n\n15 Privates (including a cook, a washerman and 2 orderlies)\n\nThis is “A Section” of 129 Field Ambulance ‘somewhere in Flanders’. Author’s collection.\n\n“B” and “C” Sections:\n\n128 in total\n\n1 Captain or Lieutenant in command of Stretcher Bearer subsection\n\n1 Sergeant and 1 Corporal\n\n1 Bugler\n\n2 Privates (wagon orderlies) and 36 Privates (bearers)\n\n1 Major, Captain or Lieutenant in command of Tent subsection\n\n1 Quartermaster, 1 Sergeant-Major, 4 Sergeants, 2 Corporals\n\n13 Privates (including a cook, a washerman and 2 orderlies)\n\nAttached\n\n“A” Section also had a Sergeant, 10 Drivers and 4 officers batmen attached from the Army Service Corps.\n\n“B” and “C” Sections each had a Sergeant, 9 Drivers and 3 batmen attached.\n\nA driver of the Army Service Corps was attached for duties with the cooks wagon.\n\nSanitary Section A Sanitary Section of the Royal Army Medical Corps (consisting of a Lieutenant or Second-Lieutenant, 2 Sergeants, 2 Corporals, 20 Privates and 1 batman) was added to each Division in early 1915. Its job was to maintain as far as possible clean water supplies, cooking facilities and billets, de-lousing stations and similar facilities. The Sanitary Sections were withdrawn from Divisions and came under Corps or Army control from March 1917 onwards. Transport As with all other units, the Field Ambulances relied heavily on horses for transport and had an establishment of 14 riding and 52 draught and pack horses. They worked the 23 wagons, 3 water carts, 3 forage carts, 6 General Service wagons, 10 ambulance wagons and the cooks wagon. The Field Ambulance also had a single bicycle. By the end of 1914, each Field Ambulance also included 7 motor ambulance vehicles. A workshop to maintain them was added to the Division, although in 1916 it was absorbed in the Divisional Supply Column.\n\nThe work of the Field Ambulances\n\nThanks to the war diary of 56 Field Ambulance RAMC we have an insight into the tasks undertaken by the men of the Ambulance. On 12 January 1916, when at Daours, the men were organised into the following parties:\n\n8 wards, in two blocks of 4 each with a Sergeant Wardmaster and Corporal Assistant Wardmaster for each block.\n\n33 men acting as nursing orderlies or general duty orderlies, including 7 men on night shift, in the wards.\n\n5 men on pack store duties.\n\n6 on rifle and kit cleaning.\n\n3 men on hospital fatigues.\n\n3 men on patients bath house duties.\n\n6 men on RAMC men’s cookhouse and 3 on mens dining hall.\n\n5 on patient’s cookhouse, 4 on canteen, 3 on patients dining room.\n\n3 on billet cleaning.\n\n4 in the dispensary.\n\n6 in the wash house.\n\n7 on sanitary squad.\n\n4 at bathing establishment.\n\n9 in drying room.\n\n4 in quartermaster’s stores.\n\n2 white washers.\n\n1 in the ablution room.\n\n1 fumigator.\n\n1 in the cleaning yard.\n\n2 bootmakers.\n\n1 horsed ambulance driver.\n\n1 tailor.\n\n1 barber.\n\n2 men at the ASC Refilling Point.\n\n3 water cart orderlies.\n\n5 loaders.\n\n1 sick officer’s cook and 1 orderly, same.\n\n5 permanent police squad.\n\n2 in sergeant’s mess.\n\n8 in officer’s mess.\n\n11 men not detailed\n\nThe Field Ambulances\n\nField Ambulance Great War history Remarks 1st 1st Division 2nd 3rd 1st Division Aug 14 – Aug 15 then Guards Division to Nov 18 4th 2nd Division Aug 14 – Aug 15 then Guards Division to Nov 18 5th 2nd Division 6th 2nd Division 7th 3rd Division 7th British Lahore Division 8th 3rd Division 8th British Lahore Division 9th 3rd Division Aug 14 – Aug 15 then Guards Division to Nov 18 10th 4th Division 11th 4th Division 12th 4th Division 13th 5th Division 14th 5th Division 15th 5th Division 16th 6th Division 17th 6th Division 18th 6th Division 19th Originally attached to 19th Brigade;
