        "text": "Agartala, Tripura, 1st of August, 2024 : On prior intelligence input regarding a major infiltration attempt on 1st August 2024 , a special operation was planned and a zero line patrol was sent ahead of the fence in area of BOP Mangroli in Pansisagar Sector. At about 1520 Hrs, Zero line patrolling party observed 20-25 Bangladeshi Infiltrators trying to cross over into the Indian territory in area of BOP Mangroli in Kailashar District, Tripura using the thick forest cover. BSF party which was already observing their movement, challenged them and tried to stop them. But the Bangladeshi nationals didnâ€™t pay any heed and thereafter 01 PAG and 01 Stun grenade were fired to deter the Infiltrators.\n\nOn this infiltrators got aggressive and attacked BSF patrolling party with sharp edged weapons and stones. Sensing imminent danger to life and property 02 round of 5.56 Insas was fired by BSF patrolling party. Meanwhile additional troops also rushed towards the site from BOP Mangroli. On being encircled by alert BSF troops, the Infiltrators escaped back to Bangladesh territory taking advantage of the forest cover and wild growth. Timely action by BSF could prevent a major infiltration attempt.\n\nAbout The Author"
