        "text": "It's Safety Tuesday! Someone cranked up the oven here in South Texas, so make sure you are staying hydrated and cool. Keep an eye on your battle buddy, and if you're with your family, keep an eye on the children and elderly; they can be more susceptible to extreme heat. More info: https://lnkd.in/g2Ecn2AQ #HeatSafety #TexasHeatWave #KnowTheSigns #HeatIllness\n\nLet's hear it for our team representing MEDCoE at the TRADOC Best Squad competition this week!

He discussed the importance of the program, their goals, and why it's important that keep in touch with Soldiers who have transitioned to retired life.

Maj. Allison Sternberg from the Office of the Commandant, Program Director and US Army lead for the Pharmacy Technician Training Program at MEDCoE for being selected to serve as the Uniformed Services University Faculty Senate. Dr. Mauricio Jimenez, Assoc. Professor at the Army-Baylor University Graduate Program in Health and Business Administration received his Master Instructor Badge after completing over 480 hours of course instruction at a superior level. The Army-Baylor program was recently ranked 12 out of 90 national programs by US News and World Reports. Congratulations to Maj. Sternberg and Dr. Jimenez!\n\n#MEDCoE's MEDVID TV unveiled a new mobile production and broadcast studio that features state-of-the-art technology. The new mobile studio is housed inside a commercial cargo van and is more than just a replacement for the previous twenty-two-year-old video production truck that had limited and outdated gear and was prone to mechanical and electrical breakdowns. The new studio has a smaller footprint and is fully self-contained and climate-controlled, making it capable of being deployed almost anywhere accessible by road. It's equipped with four Panasonic cameras capable of recording in full 4K quality featuring advanced camera connectivity, each connected to the van via 500 feet of fiber which provides power to the cameras, enables two-way communication between the cameras and the van, and allows advanced camera control for color matching from the technician in the vehicle.
