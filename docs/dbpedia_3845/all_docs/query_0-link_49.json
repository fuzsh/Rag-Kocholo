        "text": "The Veteran's Stories :\n\nPreserving their Story\n\nFor over 30 years I have collected military items, but it took a while for me to realize the real important part of this collection, and this undertaking.\n\nAfter my cousin returned home from Iraq in 1992, I listened to his stories and realized that those memories, those experiences, are what is important. I wanted to try to record those memories and experiences. I wanted to be able to share that information, and try to understand better what they went through.\n\nOn this page, I'm going to share with you the stories of the men and women that wore the uniform. I am hoping to try to help people understand the sacrifice of the veteran, and what they did that makes them deserving of our honor.\n\nThe stories that I will share with you on this site, have been approved by the veteran, or their family for sharing with you all. I have tried to be as complete as possible in telling their stories. Some of them may change as time progresses, and I am able to find and gather more information.\n\nI will continue to add more stories as I complete them. This may take a while, as currently I have over 100 of them to do. But as I complete them, and the final document is approved to be posted, I will have them available on this site, so please be patient.\n\nStories are divided by era in which they served. Each individual's story is listed, followed by Branch of Service, and followed by the unit they served in below.
