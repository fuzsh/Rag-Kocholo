        "text": "Army Medicine soldiers assigned to the U.S. Army Medical Center of Excellence, or MEDCoE, graduated from Advanced Individual Training, or AIT, as fully qualified 68W Combat Medics Aug. 3 at Joint Base San Antonio-Fort Sam Houston, Texas.\n\nThe 68W Combat Medics, the second-largest Military Occupational Specialty, or MOS, in the U.S. Army, have been at JBSA-Fort Sam Houston for 16 weeks of medic training, immediately following their Basic Combat Training. To graduate, the soldier medics underwent difficult training assessing their proficiency in both emergency medical treatment and combat trauma care, culminating in an eight-day field exercise to test those skills under simulated combat conditions.\n\nWith more than 200 soldiers graduating in formation on JBSA-Fort Sam Houston’s main post parade field, nearly 250 friends and family able to attend in person, and another 300 watching virtually, the Aug. 3 graduation was a milestone: the first large-scale, outdoor open graduation hosted by the command since the 2019 Coronavirus, or COVID-19, pandemic began.\n\nUp until a few weeks ago, it was uncertain if these medics would get the honor of marking their achievement with a formal ceremony in front of their loved ones. During the early days of the pandemic on March 13, 2020, Maj. Gen. Dennis LeMaster, MEDCoE commanding general, suspended all public graduations to help limit community spread of the virus and protect the training pipeline of the Army’s medical soldiers.\n\nLeMaster says he is proud, not only of MEDCoE leaders and planners who helped set the conditions to enable in-person graduations, but he is also proud of the hundreds of soldiers and their families who have supported, and adhered to, the necessary protective measures that are in place.\n\n“Once we got the conditions right it was a pretty easy decision,” LeMaster said of his decision to allow the graduations for now. “We had to make sure all of the right protocols were in place and that soldiers and their families were committed to following those protocols.”"
