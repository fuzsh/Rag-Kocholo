        "text": "Veteran's of the 212th Military Police Company (Sentry Dog), we need your assistance to obtain official documents, information, personal stories, and photographs for your history website. If you would like to assist in preserving the proud history of your units Vietnam tour, please click on the Email Link of any page to contact Tom Watson (History Project & Website Manager).\n\nYour historical contributions and comments are always welcomed and appreciated on this website.\n\nTo eliminate duplication of materials and information, the 212th MP Company (Sentry Dog) Long Binh Post Detachment pages have been incorporated into this company timeline page. Specific activities relative to it are identified with- HQ Long Binh or Long Binh Detachment-P. In addition, all page links, linked photographs and their Email links have been reformatted and updated. The same process, with the exception of some dated photographs (most will still be maintained in their respective detachment pages), has been done with the textual timeline history of all the other 212th company detachments.\n\nIf you have any questions about this process please feel free to direct them to the History Project and Website Manager via the Email Link at the top of this page.\n\nLong Binh was commonly referred to as LBJ, for \"Long Binh Junction,\" which is really what it was to start with in 1965 and early 1966. An undistinguished area of rice paddies, orchards and rubber trees where several main roadways met just a few miles to the east of Bien Hoa City. Later the acronym LBJ (Long Binh Jail) would become the nickname for the USARV Stockade.\n\nThe first detachment billets and kennels were tents, which eventually gave way to wooden framed structures. The tall trees in the area provided much needed shade from the relentless heat and sun. Not long after the wooden buildings began to be replaced.\n\n10 March, Long Binh Detachment-P MG W. D. Rossen, Chief of Staff, MACV conducted an inspection of the repairs and security upgrades and adjustments made at the 3rd Ordnance Ammunition Supply Depot since the 4 February Viet Cong attack of the installation. Upon completion of the inspection, MG Rossen briefed GEN William C. Westmoreland, Commanding General, MACV; the briefing was laudatory of the installations and security components efforts and progress in making the requested changes.\n\nHQ, 3rd Ordnance Battalion, HQ 1st Logistical Command [Long Binh Post] provided operational control, while company provided interior perimeter security with sentry dog handler teams, and watchtower staffing was provided by D Company, 52nd Infantry [95th MP Battalion], with exterior security outside the perimeter provided by a platoon of ambush teams from C Company, 720th MP Battalion.\n\n30 March MG C. W. Eifler Commanding, HQ, 1st Logistical Command, forwarded GEN Westmorelands commendatory remarks about the progress with the upgrades at the 3rd Ordnance Ammunition Supply Depot to HQ, 18th MP Brigade, along with his complementary comments to the brigades subordinate units that were involved, ie. 95th MP Battalion: D Company, 52nd Infantry, 720th MP Battalion: Charlie Company and 212th MP Company (Sentry Dog).\n\nMG Eifler stated that, Your immediate response to the requirements of this command [USARV] proved that the combat Military Policeman is always prepared to provide timely and effective assistance under any circumstances. Especially noteworthy was the efficient and highly professional performance of duty by members of the 720th MP Battalion, Company D, 52nd Infantry [95th MP Battalion], and the 212th MP Company (SD). I wish to express my appreciation and congratulations to appropriate members of your command for a job well done.\"\n\nDuring the same period the Headquarters, 18th MP Brigade submitted a complete unit history of the company to the Department Of The Army, Washington, D.C.\n\nSubmitted a request recommending the company be awarded the Meritorious Unit Commendation based upon its past service in the Republic of Vietnam.\n\nMade arrangements with the 3rd Region TMA to airlift all sentry dogs, handlers, and dog food by special mission to prevent the previously experienced delays of shipping by regular cargo methods.\n\nAnnounced that approval was received for delivery of ten AN/PRT-4 and AN/PRR-9 radios for the company handlers operations. Reviewed a deployment concept plan submitted by the company for future planning purposes in the event another sentry dog company was to deploy to the theater.\n\nReviewed plans submitted by the company upon a directive from G-3 USARV, for a cantonment large enough to house the company headquarters personnel, sentry dog kennels and sanitation facility in anticipation of a future move [Operation MOOSE] to Long Binh Post.\n\nExact Date Unknown, HQ Long Binh, Ban Me Thuot, & Phan Rang Detachments The issuance of the ten AN/PRT-4 (transmitter set) and AN/PRR-9 (receiving set) radios for the company handlers was initially delayed due to crystal problems. Once the issue was corrected twenty-five of the sets were immediately issued to the company on a trial and test basis in the detachments at Long Binh Post, Ban Me Thuot and Phan Rang. Initial comments on the radios were favorable, and the company was instructed to submit periodic reports on their operation to the Brigade S3.\n\nTo correct the problem each handler was issued a second sling to extend the length of the original sling allowing the rifle to be slung diagonally over the body thus allowing the handler to use both his hands for using the radio and still maintaining control of his K9. The extended sling also acted as a support when firing the rifle with one hand, which the handler may desire to do it the situation dictates that his K9 should not be released.\n\nExact Date Unknown, HQ Detachment Under the command of CPT James Reily the 212th moved its 1st Platoon and Headquarters from the Pershing Field Military Police Compound in Saigon, Capital Military District, Gia Dinh Province, III Corps Tactical Zone to Long Binh Post, Bien Hoa Province, III Corps Tactical Zone. The 1st Platoon and HQ consisted of approximately 90 men.\n\nPersonal Reflection \"During that period in 1967 the company consisted of approximately 230 men and 190 K-9s, all German Shepherds. Of that number a special squad of Scout Dog Teams was developed consisting of five specially trained handlers and K-9s. They also had eight Veterinary Technicians and one was assigned to each detachment. Serious cases of K-9 illness or injuries wre sent to Saigon.\n\nThe company maintained a total of eight detachments, two in the north in I & II Corps and six in the south in III & IV Corps. The number of teams for staffing at each detachment depended on the mission. A team consisted of one handler and one K9.\n\nThe III Corps Detachments were, 1st Platoon & Company HQ, approximately ninety men, at Long Binh Post with a squad detachment at Bearcat. The Long Binh Post assignments were perimeter security at the 3rd Ordnance Ammunition Depot, and Scout Dog Unit to assist the 720th MP Battalion counterinsurgency - pacification mission in their Tactical Area of Responsibility (TAOR).\n\nAcross the road was a small hill [Hill-23] that overlooked the compound to the north and the tactical area of responsibility of the 720th MP Battalion to the south. One of my first acts was to go to the 89th MP Group commander and request that the hill be graded flat. The request was denied as the Vietnamese government indicated that the hill had religious significance [part of a Buddhist monastery grounds] and would not permit its destruction.\" CPT [COL Ret.] James T. Roberts, Jr. Commanding Officer, 212th MP Company, 89th MP Group, 18th MP Brigade, Vietnam, November 1967 to June 1968.\n\n29 November, 1000 hours CPT Steven J. Vass, the new 720th MP Battalion S-3, chaired a meeting for all company officers and operations sergeants regarding the utilization of the new Scout Dog Teams being provided by the 212th MP Company (Sentry Dog). The meeting was to insure that all companies that had missions in the TAOR had a common understanding of how to request the teams, their capabilities and limitations, and protective measures to be taken when the dogs were tracking. The teams would prove to be a very valuable addition to the counterinsurgency mission.\n\nPersonal Reflection I was one of the two original scout dog handlers with the 212th at Long Binh. We received our dogs and trained with the 199th. Infantry Brigade [Camp Frenzell-Jones]. SP/4 Jim Kelly was the other handler.\n\nMy scout dogs name was Prince, and we received our training in 1967 and we were both sentry dog handles at the Long Binh [3rd Ordnance] ammo dump prior to this. We did patrols throughout the Bien Hoa area and set up nighttime ambushes on a regular basis working with different platoons of the 720th. SP/4 Roger W. Fauver, 212th MP Company (Sentry Dog), Scout Dog Unit, 95th & 720th MP Battalion's, 1967-1968.\n\nPersonal Reflection \"The end of December found me in Vinh Long with SP/4 Danny Conyers, my driver and a third MP riding as shotgun. My mission was to persuade the airfield commander to allow our dog handlers to work the perimeter. The layout was that the garrison buildings were grouped next to the main national highway [Highway-4] with the helicopters and their revetments between the buildings and the airstrip.\n\nI took the hint. Things were about to happen if HQ MACV had made that decision. We were about fifty kilometers from Saigon and had to use the national Highway-4 that connected Vinh Long with Can Tho with Saigon to get back to Long Binh. Although it was in the afternoon, we felt we could get into Saigon before dusk.\n\nThe detachment sergeant and I discussed his needs and we left for the ferry crossing northwest of Vinh Long. At that point, I realized how vulnerable we were. We were the only U.S. military vehicle on the road, on the ferry, and beyond. SP/4 Conyers hit the gas as we drove off the crowded ferry. About half way to Can Tho, we were fired upon from a tree line as we left one of the small villages along the route. To make it more surreal, we drove through an ARVN armored attack that was crossing Highway-4. It was going from southeast to northwest. To our left beyond the far wood line, there was smoke rising from an air strike. From Can Tho north, to and through Saigon it was quiet with no visible activity.” CPT [COL Ret.] James T. Roberts, Jr. Commanding Officer, 212th MP Company, 89th MP Group, 18th MP Brigade, Vietnam, November 1967 to June 1968."
