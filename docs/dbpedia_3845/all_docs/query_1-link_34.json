        "text": "This healthcare treatment facility has earned the Gold Seal of Approval from The Joint Commission, a nationally recognized healthcare accreditation organization. Click the Gold Seal to see The Joint Commission's Quality Report for Landstuhl Regional Medical Center and its outlying health clinics in Germany, Belgium and Italy.\n\nIn an effort to be as transparent as possible, This Army Health Clinic, in coordination with the Military Health System, is voluntarily making several quality and safety measures public. For U.S. civilian healthcare systems, participation is voluntary. Therefore you might not be able to find the same measures published by some state-side facilities.\n\nSee how we're doing\n\nCompare Military Health System hospitals and clinics\n\nFlu Vaccinations\n\nInfluenza is a highly contagious viral infection. There are three main antigen types of influenza: types A, B, and C. Influenza type A causes moderate to severe illness and affects all age groups. Type A can infect both humans and animals. The notion that influenza type B generally causes milder disease than type A has been recently challenged and is more fatal in children. Type B mainly infects humans. Influenza type C only causes mild respiratory illness. Influenza activity peaks from December to March in the Northern Hemisphere.\n\nInfluenza is transmitted from person to person mainly when an infected person coughs or sneezes. Transmission can also occur from direct contact with respiratory secretions, such as when touching surfaces contaminated with influenza virus and then touching the eyes, nose, or mouth, or from indirect contact with droplets from coughs or sneezes. Transmission can occur from the day before symptoms begin until about 5 days after symptoms begin in adults, or up to 10 days or more after symptoms begin in children.\n\nAbout 50% of infected persons will develop \"classic\" influenza disease. This is characterized by the abrupt onset of fever, muscle pain, sore throat, nonproductive cough, runny nose, and headache. These symptoms generally last from 2 to 3 days. However, some people may experience a loss of strength or energy for several weeks. In addition, some people may develop complications, such as pneumonia.\n\nSource: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\n\nRequired documents:\n\nDHA Form 116: Pediatric and Adult Influenza Screening and Immunization Documentation\n\nA form for screening both children and adults for contraindications to receiving influenza vaccine. (v5, August 2023)\n\n!!! DOD ID number for Patient receiving immunization (Not of the Sponsor) !!!"
