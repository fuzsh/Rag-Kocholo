        "text": "Scottish prince\n\nHenry of Scotland (Eanric mac Dabíd, 1114 – 12 June 1152 ) was heir apparent to the Kingdom of Alba. He was also the 3rd Earl of Northumbria and the 3rd Earl of Huntingdon. He was the son of King David I of Scotland and Queen Maud, 2nd Countess of Huntingdon.\n\nDavid I of Scotland, Henry's father, invaded England in 1136. His army was met by Stephen of Blois at Carlisle. Instead of battle, there was a negotiated settlement that included Henry performing homage to Stephen for Carlisle and the Earldom of Huntingdon. Henry's journey to Stephen's court for Easter (1136) was met with resentment, including an accusation of treason, which brought about his return at his father's insistence.\n\nAfter another invasion by his father, Henry was finally invested with the Earldom of Northumberland in 1139. Later in the year, Henry met with Stephen at Nottingham, where he was also reinvested with Carlisle and Cumberland. Henry then paid homage to Stephen for his earldom.\n\nHenry's inclusion into King Stephen's inner circle was highlighted by his arranged marriage to Ada de Warenne. This marriage secured Henry's place within Stephen's kingdom. Following Stephen's capture by forces of Empress Matilda, Henry held the Earldom of Northumberland as a Scottish fief.\n\nEarl Henry, as sometimes named, son and heir of King David I of Scotland, had been in poor health throughout the 1140s. He died suddenly on 12 June 1152. His death occurred in either Newcastle or Roxburgh, both located in those areas of Northumbria which he and his father had attached to the Scots crown in the period of English weakness after the death of Henry I of England. Unlike in the case of the English king, who had been left without legitimate male descendants in the wreck of the White Ship, there was no succession crisis. This was because Earl Henry had left behind three sons to carry forward the lineage of his father.[8]\n\nOn Henry's death, the Huntingdon earldom passed to his half-brother Simon II de Senlis.\n\nIn 1139, Henry married Ada de Warenne, the daughter of William de Warenne, 2nd Earl of Surrey (died 1138), and Elizabeth of Vermandois, daughter of Hugh of Vermandois. Their children (in an approximate order of birth) were:\n\nMalcolm IV of Scotland (1141–1165)\n\nWilliam I of Scotland (c. 1142–1214)\n\nAda of Huntingdon (died 1206), married in 1161 Floris III, Count of Holland.\n\nMargaret of Huntingdon (died 1201)\n\nDavid of Scotland, 8th Earl of Huntingdon (1152–1219)\n\nMatilda (or Maud) of Huntingdon, died unmarried in 1152.\n\nMarjorie of Huntingdon, married Gille Críst, Earl of Angus.[9][10]\n\nBarlow, Professor Frank, The Feudal Kingdom of England 1012 - 1216, London,1955, tree opposite p. 288.\n\nBurke, John & John Bernard, The Royal Families of England, Scotland, and Wales, with their Descendants, Sovereigns and Subjects, London, 1851, vol. 2, p. xlvii and pedigree XXIX.\n\nDunbar, Sir Archibald H., Bt., Scottish Kings, a Revised Chronology of Scottish History, 1005 - 1625, Edinburgh, 1899, pp. 64–65.\n\nEverard, Judith; Jones, Michael C.
