        "text": "Henry Frederick Stuart seemed destined to become one of the most powerful and influential kings in history but his name is now almost unknown.\n\nHenry was the heir to James VI of Scotland, who became the king of England and Ireland when his son was just nine years old.\n\nThe young prince was brought up by strict governors to be the perfect example of a Renaissance Protestant monarch and was looked on to secure the Stuart dynasty for generations.\n\nBut the course of history was changed by a swim in the Thames when Henry was only 18.\n\nPrepared for the role\n\nHenry Stuart's life spanned an extraordinary period in British history.\n\nThe Union of the Crowns, the Gunpowder Plot, colonial expansion and the age of Shakespeare were just some of the more notable episodes.\n\nHenry was schooled to display all the outward signs of kingship, with his father even writing a book to advise him on his role - Basilikon Doron.\n\nHowever, when King James died it was Henry's younger brother Charles who took the throne and eventually led England into the turmoil of the Civil War.\n\nTurbulent times\n\nA BBC Scotland documentary - The Best King We Never Had - looks at the life of the man who could have been England's Henry IX (His grandmother Mary, Queen of Scots was the great-niece of Henry VIII).\n\nHe was born in Stirling Castle in 1594 and, as the first child of James and his Danish wife Anne, Henry was celebrated as guaranteeing the succession of the Stuart bloodline.\n\nThe slaughter of the Scottish Reformation was just a generation away and James VI had become the first Protestant monarch of Scotland.\n\nThe country was still divided though and many Catholics longed for a return to the old faith.\n\nRelations with England were also tense.\n\nOnly seven years before Henry's birth, England's Tudor queen, Elizabeth, executed her cousin Mary, Queen of Scots.\n\nEnforced separation\n\nKing James believed Henry needed to be kept safe and, at just days old, he was taken from his mother and fostered into the care of the Mar family.\n\nThey were the hereditary keepers of Stirling Castle and historically the guardians of Scottish princes.\n\nQueen Anne took this enforced separation bitterly and the Mars became her sworn enemies.\n\nHistorical consultant Sarah Fraser says: \"Anne is a heartbroken, grieving mother and she set her will on getting him back.\"\n\nHenry bore the weight of great expectations and was brought up in an intense atmosphere with a governor and tutors chosen by his father.\n\nThe men responsible saw themselves as preparing a Protestant king who could eventually take over from Elizabeth, uniting the thrones of England and Scotland and being a bulwark against other religions.\n\nIn March 1603, Elizabeth died and signalled that James was to be her successor.\n\nThe king's intention was to quit Scotland with his queen and take up the English throne as soon as possible, leaving Henry in the continued custody of the Mar family.\n\nAnne, who was pregnant, delayed her journey to London and used James's absence to get her child back.\n\n\"No sooner has the dust settled behind James's disappearing hooves than Anne comes galloping to Stirling and demands her son,\" says Ms Fraser.\n\n\"She has waited 10 years. Ten years of Henry being this rope in a dynastic political war.\n\n\"They try to deny her but you cannot deny 'the Queen's majesty in an interesting condition'.\n\n\"She goes ballistic. She beats her belly and starts to bleed, inducing a miscarriage.\"\n\nProtestant future\n\nThe family's journey to London was halted by the plague and it took nine months before it was considered safe enough for the precious young prince to be allowed to travel into London.\n\nWhen King James finally arrived he enjoyed a honeymoon period but the question of religion soon began to cause problems.\n\nJames angered Puritans by keeping the Anglican Church as the state religion and Catholics feared his Protestant upbringing would bring more punishment for them.\n\nWhen Guy Fawkes tried to blow up the opening of parliament on 5 November 1605, he wanted to \"blow back the beggarly Scots to their native mountains\" - and that included the young Prince Henry as well as his father.\n\nHenry was 11 by this time and he became obsessively interested in military skills to help him defend the Protestant faith.\n\nBy 1610, when he was 16, Parliament gave its consent for Henry's investiture as Prince of Wales.\n\nIt was a quasi-Coronation, costing the equivalent of £10m in today's money, that displayed Henry's rising power and status.\n\nHe continued to boost the image of himself as a great Renaissance prince, employing agents to seek out treasures to adorn his court.\n\nHe bought up whole collections of works of art, coins, books, antiquaries and sculpture, many of which are kept in Windsor Castle.\n\nHenry also backed a bid to establish an overseas colony on the North American coast.\n\nThe settlement was established in Virginia at a place named Henricus.\n\nProtestant cause\n\nAcross Europe, Protestants saw Henry as \"the coming man,\" says Sarah Fraser.\n\nShe says there was pressure from Europe for Henry to go on a crusade and lead the Evangelical Union of Protestant states.\n\nThey were worried that Spain was reviving and it wanted to \"re-Catholicise Europe\", she says.\n\nHenry longed for his father to intervene in the religious politics of Europe for the Protestant cause but James was a peacemaker with no appetite for war.\n\nAnd then in October 1612 tragedy struck.\n\nAt the age of 18, the man who had been prepared for kingship all his life was taken ill after a swim in the Thames near Richmond.\n\nHis symptoms suggest he had water-borne typhoid fever.\n\nOn his death, the whole nation went into shock and thousands of people lined the streets to watch the funeral procession to Westminster.\n\nIt was too much for his parents, who could not bear to attend.\n\nHenry's legacy\n\n\"Henry is put in with his granny, Mary Queen of Scots,\" she says.\n\nJames dismantled Henry's legacy as far as he could, moving away from the radical and puritan Protestantism of his son.\n\nCharles eventually inherited the throne 13 years later, having had little of the preparation Henry had for the role.\n\nHis reign ended with the English Civil War and the king being executed, sparking a century of tumult and conflict.\n\nIt is one of history's unanswerable questions: 'What if Henry had been king instead?\""
