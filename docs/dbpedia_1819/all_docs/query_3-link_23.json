The peace turns out to be considerably shorter than \"perpetual\".\n\n8 August 1503: A \"Treaty of Perpetual Peace\" with England is followed by the marriage between James IV and Margaret Tudor, eldest daughter of Henry VII of England at Holyrood.

She would become the Queen Consort of King James V, mother of Mary, Queen of Scots, and Regent of Scotland.\n\nMay 1524: Following a coup d'Ã©tat, the Duke of Albany returns to France with his supporting troops.
