        "text": "So much for a catchy title! Before we begin I need to admit that Robin Hood is my all time hero. My father used to read me the tale of Robin Hood, at my request, again and again. I visited Nottingham when I was seven and was disappointed with the castle in the way that only a seven-year-old can be. I was expecting Hollywood turrets, battlements and assorted drawbridges. Even worse, so far as fair Nottingham was concerned, what the bombing raids of Luftwaffe didn’t destroy, the city planners had mangled. I can still remember my Dad going round the one way system getting progressively more irritated. Things only really got better when we arrived in Sherwood Forest and we went in search of the Major Oak. But enough of my personal history – just be aware that I have a not altogether unbiased viewpoint as to whether Robin existed or not.\n\nLegend, film versions at any rate, places Robin Hood and his merry band firmly in the reign of Good King Richard and Bad King John. Other versions place him in the reign of Henry III, possibly dying with Simon de Montfort at the Battle of Evesham.\n\nIn some respects it doesn’t really matter. The fact is that The Lyttell Geste of Robin Hood was set in print by William Caxton. This is a version of an oral tradition that must have been handed down over the generations. And here its worth a moment’s digression. If we look at the ballads of the border reivers such as the tale of Kinmont Willie it is possible to see where history has become embroidered by the needs of a good story and the formula of the ballad. There’s also a little bit of a hint that Sir Walter Scott may have tidied the whole thing up somewhat. It is possible to see a sixteenth century historical event turning into a story. The same, perhaps, can be said for Robin Hood excepting the fact that there isn’t anywhere near as much paper based evidence for Robin Hood as there is for William Armstrong of Kinmont who took for himself rather than anyone else irrelevant of the wealth of his victims but still seems to have managed to stay one step ahead of the law. And yes, Sir Walter Scott did embroider the Robin Hood story – who could forget Ivanhoe?\n\nThere is, however, a faint trace of a historical paper trail for the man in green. The Court Rolls of the Manor of Wakefield; the Contrarient Rolls of King Edward II and the Household Expenses Account of Edward II reveal an archer by the name of Robin Hood. The key thing is though, not whether he existed or was fabricated by disgruntled over-taxed peasants, but that he became a national hero – and was sung about in English. Robin reflects the fact that during the Plantagenet period the English were beginning to get a sense of themselves as a nation. In part, this was because King John lost his continental empire and was forced to concentrate on England – not that the barons were terribly grateful for the favour. The accession of Henry III, the first child monarch in English history, saw a time of some weakness for the monarchy and the reissue of Magna Carta; the concept of shared power (well shared if you were a baron); a rising group of free men and a somewhat fairer legal system. It is perhaps not surprising then that Robin’s story should be associated with a period in history when the English were beginning to evolve as a nation.\n\nOf course, the Black Death killing one-third of the British population between 1349-50 helped matters along rather nicely as the English-speaking hoi-poloi suddenly found that they had more economic clout than previously but the fact that English was reinstated in schools that same year, although the universities of Oxford and Cambridge continued to use Latin, reflects the growing importance of the English language and the changing perspectives of the ruling classes. They were beginning to see themselves as English rather than Norman. In 1362 English replaced French as the language of law by the Statutes of Pleading but records continued to be kept in Latin and English was used in Parliament for the first time.\n\nNow if you don’t mind, I’m off to re-watch Errol Flynn being heroic in the green wood. If you want to find out more about the history of Edwinstowe where Robin Hood is supposed to have married Maid Marian, click on the image at the beginning. It will take you to an article I wrote and had published a couple of years ago. You might be surprised to discover that even Henry II gets in on the act as well.\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nCastle building began with the Normans – motte and bailey affairs – or in straight forward terms a huge pile of earth topped off with a wooden crown of wall and keep. The aim was to dominate the landscape and afford themselves protection (keeping their fingers firmly crossed that no one turned up with the equivalent of an early medieval box of matches).\n\nThe key to Cumberland is Carlisle Castle which was begun by William Rufus during the eleventh century. It’s history reflects the political upheavals of the medieval period as well as the fact that the border between England and Scotland was sometimes apt to shift quite dramatically!\n\nIn 1122 Henry I ordered that it should be strengthened with stone. By the time of his death it was still unfinished and making the most of the civil war between Stephen and Matilda, King David of Scotland moved into Carlisle and finished the building. He died in Carlisle Castle in 1135. Carlisle was regained by the English.\n\nHenry II commanded that there should be further strengthening which was just as well because William the Lion of Scotland attacked Carlisle twice with a large force in an attempt to regain the territory that his brother had lost.\n\nKing John stayed in the castle on several different occasions reflecting the fact that having lost his continental possessions he was the first Plantagenet king who really turned his attention to the north and the northern English barons – it wasn’t a happy relationship leading as it did to rebellion and for a time Carlisle ending up in the hands of the Scottish again – the town made no resistance to Alexander III but the castle garrison did. It fell to the Scottish because miners sapped the south curtain wall. The Scots also bombarded it with missiles but when John died in 1216 the Scots withdrew. The fact that the roof of the castle needed repair by the mid thirteenth century demonstrates that the borders did undergo a period of peace.\n\nThat all changed with the death of Alexander III. Edward I visited Carlisle many times, eventually dying at Burgh-By-Sands on his way to yet another campaign against the Scots. The next two hundred and fifty years were pretty turbulent if you happened to live on the border and this is reflected once again in the Castle’s history.\n\nJuly 1315 – Robert Bruce besieges Carlisle but it is ably defended by Sir Andrew Harclay who tried to establish peace but got himself hung, drawn and quartered for his efforts.\n\nIt was during this period of increased militarization that Hexham Goal was built and also Thirlwall Castle which used dressed stone from a rather large nearby wall… It is situated near the Tyne-Irthing Gap a way used by Scottish raiders so its strategic position is immediately obvious. Some miles down the road, Aydon Castle turned from being a manor house into a fortified manor with its own barmkin wall.\n\nIn fact, those who could fortify their dwellings did so on both sides of the borders. Peles or peel towers dot the border region and the Eden Valley. They were not built to stop raiders they were built to keep families and their livestock safe during incursions. They tend to be rectangular with a barrel-vaulted basement and two further stories above including a roof with a beacon to summon help. The Vicar at Corbridge had his own pele tower and there’s one in the grounds of Carlisle Cathedral. In other locations churches included fortified protection for local villagers in their design creating a landscape of romantic looking ruins today but which reflect the difficulties of living on the border until the two kingdoms came under the rule of one monarch.\n\nBastle Houses are very similar to peels but built on a smaller scale – they tended to be owned by better off tenant farmers. Most of them were built in the Sixteenth Century and lie within 15 miles of the border.\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading..."
