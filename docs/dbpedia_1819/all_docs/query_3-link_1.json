        "text": "Scottish monarchs until 1707\n\nThis article is about Scottish monarchs until 1707. For British monarchs since the Union of Scotland and England in 1707, see List of British monarchs. For legendary ones, see Legendary kings of Scotland.\n\nThe monarch of Scotland was the head of state of the Kingdom of Scotland. According to tradition, Kenneth I MacAlpin (Cináed mac Ailpín) was the founder and first King of the Kingdom of Scotland (although he never held the title historically, being King of the Picts instead).[a]\n\nThe Kingdom of the Picts just became known as the Kingdom of Alba in Scottish Gaelic, which later became known in Scots and English as Scotland; the terms are retained in both languages to this day. By the late 11th century at the very latest, Scottish kings were using the term rex Scottorum, or King of Scots, to refer to themselves in Latin. The Kingdom of Scotland was merged with the Kingdom of England to form a single Kingdom of Great Britain in 1707. Thus, Queen Anne became the last monarch of the ancient kingdoms of Scotland and England and the first of Great Britain, although the kingdoms had shared a monarch since 1603 (see Union of the Crowns). Her uncle Charles II was the last monarch to be crowned in Scotland, at Scone in 1651. He had a second coronation in England ten years later.\n\nWilliam I – James VI\n\nJames VI – James VII\n\nWilliam II and Mary II\n\nWilliam II\n\nAnne\n\nThe reign of Kenneth MacAlpin begins what is often called the House of Alpin, an entirely modern concept. The descendants of Kenneth MacAlpin were divided into two branches; the crown would alternate between the two, the death of a king from one branch often hastened by war or assassination by a pretender from the other. Malcolm II was the last king of the House of Alpin; in his reign, he successfully crushed all opposition to him and, having no sons, was able to pass the crown to his daughter's son, Duncan I, who inaugurated the House of Dunkeld.\n\nModern English name\n\n(Modern Gaelic name)\n\n(Medieval Gaelic name)\n\nReign Epithet Title Dynastic status Kenneth I MacAlpin[2]\n\n(Coinneach mac Ailpein)\n\n(Cináed mac Ailpín / Ciniod m.

The House of Dunkeld was therefore closely related to the House of Alpin.

Macbeth was a cousin of Duncan and was a maternal grandson of Malcolm II.

The dynastic feuds did not end there: on Malcolm III's death in battle, his brother Donald III, known as \"Bán\", claimed the throne, expelling Malcolm III's sons from Scotland. A civil war in the family ensued, with Donald III and Malcolm III's son Edmund opposed by Malcolm III's English-backed sons, led first by Duncan II and then by Edgar. Edgar triumphed, sending his uncle and brother to monasteries. After the reign of David I, the Scottish throne was passed according to rules of primogeniture, moving from father to son, or where not possible, brother to brother. Alexander III was the last ruler from the house of Dunkeld, and having no sons, the throne was inherited by his granddaughter Margaret, Maid of Norway.\n\nModern English name\n\n(Modern Gaelic name)\n\n(Medieval Gaelic name)\n\nReign Epithet Title Marriage(s) Dynastic status Malcolm III[37]\n\n(Maol Chaluim mac Dhonnchaidh)\n\n(Máel Coluim mac Donnchada)\n\n1058–1093 Cenn Mór (\"Canmore\")\n\n\"Great Chief\"[38] Rí Alban / Scottorum basileus Ingibiorg Finnsdottir\n\nthree sons\n\nMargaret of Wessex\n\n1070\n\neight children Son of Duncan I Donald III[39]\n\n(Dòmhnall mac Dhonnchaidh)\n\n(Domnall mac Donnchada)\n\n1093–1097 Bán,\n\n\"the Fair\" Rí Alban Unknown\n\nat least one daughter Duncan II[40]\n\n(Donnchadh mac Mhaoil Chaluim)\n\n(Donnchad mac Maíl Choluim)\n\n1094 Rí Alban / Rex Scottorum Ethelreda of Northumbria\n\none son Son of Malcolm III Edgar[41]\n\n(Eagar mac Mhaoil Chaluim)\n\n(Étgar mac Maíl Choluim)\n\n1097–1107 Probus,\n\n\"the Valiant\"[42] None Alexander I[43]\n\n(Alasdair mac Mhaoil Chaluim)\n\n(Alaxandair mac Maíl Choluim)\n\n1107–1124 \"the Fierce\"[44] Sybilla of Normandy\n\nno children David I[45]\n\n(Dàibhidh mac Mhaoil Chaluim)\n\n(Dabíd mac Maíl Choluim)\n\n1124–1153 \"the Saint\"[46] Maud, Countess of Huntingdon\n\n1113\n\nfour children Malcolm IV[47]\n\n(Maol Chaluim mac Eanraig)\n\n(Máel Coluim mac Eanric)\n\n1153–1165 Virgo\n\n\"the Maiden\"\n\n-\n\nCenn Mór,\n\n\"Great Chief\"[38] None Grandson of David I William I\n\n(Uilleam mac Eanraig)\n\n(Uilliam mac Eanric)\n\n1165–1214 \"the Lion\"\n\n-\n\nGarbh,\n\n\"the Rough\"[48] Ermengarde de Beaumont\n\nWoodstock Palace, Oxford, England\n\n5 September 1186\n\nfour children Alexander II[49]\n\n(Alasdair mac Uilleim)\n\n(Alaxandair mac Uilliam)\n\n1214–1249 Joan of England\n\nYork Minster, England\n\n21 June 1221\n\nno children\n\nMarie de Coucy\n\nRoxburgh\n\n15 May 1239\n\none son Son of William I Alexander III[50]\n\n(Alasdair mac Alasdair)\n\n(Alaxandair mac Alaxandair)\n\n1249–1286 Margaret of England\n\nYork Minster, England\n\n25 December 1251\n\nthree children\n\nYolande de Dreux\n\nJedburgh Abbey\n\n15 October 1285\n\nno children Son of Alexander II\n\nSee also: House of Sverre\n\nMargaret, Maid of Norway inherited the throne in 1286, but died in 1290 in Orkney on her way to be crowned. During her absence, Scotland was ruled by a set of guardians. After her death, Scotland entered a period of interregnum, where 13 contenders fought for the throne and ultimately, John Balliol succeeded.\n\nThe status of Margaret, as a Scottish monarch is debated by historians. She was never crowned, and her contemporaries in Scotland described her as \"queen\" very rarely, referring to her instead as Scotland's \"lady\", \"heir\", or \"lady and heir\". On the other hand, documents issued from late 1286 no longer refer to the \"king whosoever he may be\", indicating that the throne may have been regarded as already occupied by Margaret. In modern historiography she is nearly unanimously called \"queen\", and reference books give 19 March 1286, the date of Alexander III's death, as the start of her reign.\n\nName Birth Death Dynastic status Margaret[53]\n\nthe Maid of Norway\n\n1286–1290 c.

Alexander's only surviving descendant was his granddaughter Margaret, Maid of Norway, a young child, who inherited the throne in 1286. A set of guardians were appointed to rule Scotland in her absence since she was living in Norway where her father Eric II was king. She was finally sent to Scotland in 1290 but died before arriving in Scotland. The next king of Scots was not determined until completion of an arbitration in 1292.\n\nSee also: House of Balliol\n\nThe death of Margaret of Norway began a two-year interregnum in Scotland caused by a succession crisis. With her death, the descent of William I became extinct and there was no obvious heir. Thirteen candidates presented themselves; the most prominent were John Balliol, great-grandson of William I's younger brother David of Huntingdon, and Robert de Brus, 5th Lord of Annandale, grandson of David of Huntingdon. The Scottish magnates invited Edward I of England to arbitrate the claims. He did so but forced the Scots to swear allegiance to him as overlord. Eventually, it was decided that John Balliol should become king. He proved weak and incapable and, in 1296, was forced to abdicate by Edward I who then attempted to annex Scotland into the Kingdom of England.\n\nName Portrait Birth Marriage(s) Death Dynastic status John Balliol[54]\n\nToom Tabard (\"Empty Cloak\")\n\n(Iain Balliol)\n\n1292–1296 c. 1249 Isabella de Warenne\n\n9 February 1281\n\nat least one son\n\nc. 25 November 1314\n\nPicardy, France\n\ngreat-great-great-grandson of King David I\n\n(election)\n\nJohn Balliol abdicated in March 1296. That same month Edward I invaded Scotland. The second set of guardians were appointed under Edward I who ruled from 1296 to 1306, until the election of Robert the Bruce as the king of Scotland.\n\nSee also: Clan Bruce\n\nFor ten years, Scotland had no king. The Scots, however, refused to tolerate English rule. First William Wallace and Andrew Moray, then John Comyn, and finally Robert the Bruce (the grandson of the 1292 competitor, Robert de Brus, 5th Lord of Annandale who in turn was the grandson of David of Huntingdon, younger brother of William I) fought against the English. Bruce and his supporters had murdered their rival to the throne of Scotland, John Comyn, Lord of Badenoch, on 10 February 1306 at Greyfriars Church in Dumfries. Shortly after in 1306, Robert was crowned King of Scots at Scone. Robert Bruce was then hunted down for his crime of murder, and subsequently, he escaped to the outskirt islands, leaving the country completely leaderless, and the English invaded once again. Bruce returned a year later and gained support for his cause. His energy, and the corresponding replacement of the vigorous Edward I with his weaker son Edward II in 1307, allowed Scotland to free itself from English rule. At the Battle of Bannockburn in 1314, the Scots routed the English, and by 1328 the English had agreed by treaty to accept Scottish independence. Robert's son, David, acceded to the throne as a child. The English renewed their war with Scotland, and David was forced to flee the kingdom by Edward Balliol, son of King John, who managed to get himself crowned (1332–1356) and to give away Scotland's southern counties to England before being driven out again. David spent much of his life in exile, first in freedom with his ally, France, and then in prison in England. He was only able to return to Scotland in 1357. Upon his death, childless, in 1371, the House of Bruce came to an end.\n\nName Portrait Birth Marriage(s) Death Dynastic status Robert I[55]\n\nthe Bruce\n\n(Raibeart a Briuis)\n\n1306–1329 11 July 1274\n\nTurnberry Castle\n\nson of Robert de Brus, 6th Lord of Annandale and Marjorie, Countess of Carrick[56] Isabella of Mar\n\n1295\n\none daughter\n\nElizabeth de Burgh\n\nWrittle, Essex, England\n\n1302\n\nfour children 7 June 1329\n\nManor of Cardross\n\naged 54 great-great-great-great-grandson of King David I\n\n(election) David II[57]\n\n(Dàibhidh Bruis)\n\n1329–1371 5 March 1324\n\nDunfermline Abbey\n\nson of Robert I and Elizabeth de Burgh Joan of England\n\nBerwick-upon-Tweed\n\n17 July 1328\n\nno children\n\nMargaret Drummond\n\nInchmurdach, Fife\n\n20 February 1364\n\nno children 22 February 1371\n\nEdinburgh Castle\n\naged 46 son of Robert I (primogeniture)\n\nEdward Balliol was the son of King John Balliol, who had himself ruled for four years following his election in the Great Cause. Following his abdication, John Balliol lived out his life in obscurity in Picardy, France. During the minority of David II, Edward Balliol seized the opportunity to assert his claim to the throne, and backed by the English, he defeated the forces of David's regency and was himself crowned king at Scone in 1332. He was quickly defeated by loyalist forces and sent back to England. With English support, he would mount two more attempts to seize the throne again, in 1333 and 1335, each time his actual control of the throne was brief before being sent back to England, for the last time in 1336. When David returned from exile in 1341 to rule in his own right, Edward lost most of his support. When David II was captured in battle in 1346, Edward made one last attempt to seize the throne for himself but had little support and the campaign fizzled before it gained much traction. In 1356 he renounced all claims to the throne.\n\nName Portrait Birth Marriage(s) Death Claim Edward Balliol[58]\n\n1332–1356\n\nIn opposition to David II 1283\n\nSon of John Balliol and Isabella de Warenne None 1367\n\nDoncaster, England\n\naged 83–84 Son of John Balliol, candidate of the English to replace the exiled David II\n\nSee also: House of Stuart and Clan Stewart\n\nRobert the Stewart was a grandson of Robert I by the latter's daughter, Marjorie. Having been born in 1316, he was older than his uncle, David II. Consequently, he was at his accession a middle-aged man, already 55, and unable to reign vigorously, a problem also faced by his son Robert III, who also ascended in middle age at 53 in 1390, and suffered lasting damage in a horse-riding accident. These two were followed by a series of regencies, caused by the youth of the succeeding five boy kings. Consequently, the Stewart era saw periods of royal inertia, during which the nobles usurped power from the crown, followed by periods of personal rule by the monarch, during which he or she would attempt to address the issues created by their minority and the long-term effects of previous reigns. Governing Scotland became increasingly difficult, as the powerful nobility became increasingly intractable. James I's attempts to curb the disorder of the realm ended in his assassination. James III was killed in a civil war between himself and the nobility, led by his son. When James IV, who had governed sternly and suppressed the aristocrats, died in the Battle of Flodden, his wife Margaret Tudor, who had been nominated regent for their young son James V, was unseated by noble feuding, and James V's wife, Mary of Guise, succeeded in ruling Scotland during the regency for her young daughter Mary I only by dividing and conquering the noble factions, distributing French bribes with a liberal hand. Finally, Mary I, the daughter of James V, found herself unable to govern Scotland faced with the surliness of the aristocracy and the intransigence of the population, who favored Calvinism and disapproved of her Catholicism. She was forced to abdicate, and fled to England, where she was imprisoned in various castles and manor houses for eighteen years and finally executed for treason against the English queen Elizabeth I. Upon her abdication, her son, fathered by Henry, Lord Darnley, a junior member of the Stewart family, became King as James VI.\n\nJames VI became King of England and Ireland as James I in 1603 when his cousin Elizabeth I died. Thereafter, although the two crowns of England and Scotland remained separate, the monarchy was based chiefly in England. Charles I, James's son, found himself faced with the Civil War. The resultant conflict lasted eight years and ended in his execution. The English Parliament then decreed their monarchy to be at an end. The Scots Parliament, after some deliberation, broke their links with England and declared that Charles II, son, and heir of Charles I, would become King. He ruled until 1651 when the armies of Oliver Cromwell occupied Scotland and drove him into exile.\n\nName Portrait Birth Marriage(s) Death Dynastic status Robert II[59]\n\nthe Stewart\n\n(Raibeart II Stiùbhairt)\n\n1371–1390 2 March 1316\n\nPaisley Abbey\n\nson of Walter Stewart, 6th High Steward of Scotland and Marjorie Bruce Elizabeth Mure\n\n1336 (uncertain canonicity)\n\n1349 (with Papal dispensation)\n\nten children\n\nEuphemia de Ross\n\n2 May 1355\n\nfour children 19 April 1390\n\nDundonald Castle\n\naged 74 grandson of Robert I through his daughter\n\n(primogeniture) Robert III[60]\n\n(born John Stewart)\n\nthe Lame King\n\n(Raibeart III Stiùbhairt, An Righ Bhacaigh)\n\n1390–1406 c. 1337\n\nunknown\n\nson of Robert II and Elizabeth Mure Anabella Drummond\n\n1367\n\nseven children 4 April 1406\n\nRothesay Castle\n\naged about 69 son of Robert II (primogeniture) James I[61]\n\n(Seumas I Stiùbhairt)\n\n1406–1437 late July 1394\n\nDunfermline Abbey\n\nson of Robert III and Anabella Drummond Joan Beaufort\n\nSouthwark Cathedral\n\n2 February 1424\n\neight children 21 February 1437\n\nChurch of the Friars Preachers of Blessed Virgin and Saint Dominic at Perth\n\naged about 42 (assassinated) son of Robert III (primogeniture) James II[62]\n\nFiery Face\n\n(Seumas II Stiùbhairt)\n\n1437–1460 16 October 1430\n\nHolyrood Abbey\n\nson of James I and Joan Beaufort Mary of Guelders\n\nHolyrood Abbey\n\n3 July 1449\n\nseven children 3 August 1460\n\nRoxburgh Castle\n\naged 29 son of James I (primogeniture) James III[63]\n\n(Seumas III Stiùbhairt)\n\n1460–1488 10 July 1451\n\nStirling Castle or St Andrews Castle\n\nson of James II and Mary of Guelders Margaret of Denmark\n\nHolyrood Abbey\n\n13 July 1469\n\nthree children 11 June 1488\n\nSauchie Burn\n\naged 36 son of James II (primogeniture) James IV[64]\n\n(Seumas IV Stiùbhairt)\n\n1488–1513 17 March 1473\n\nStirling Castle\n\nson of James III and Margaret of Denmark Margaret Tudor\n\nHolyrood Abbey\n\n8 August 1503\n\nsix children 9 September 1513\n\nFlodden Field, Northumberland, England\n\naged 40 son of James III (primogeniture) James V[65]\n\n(Seumas V Stiùbhairt)\n\n1513–1542 15 April 1512\n\nLinlithgow Palace\n\nson of James IV and Margaret Tudor Madeleine of Valois\n\nNotre Dame Cathedral, Paris, France\n\n1 January 1537\n\nno children\n\nMary of Guise\n\nNotre Dame Cathedral, Paris, France\n\n18 May 1538\n\nthree children 14 December 1542\n\nFalkland Palace\n\naged 30 son of James IV (primogeniture) Mary I[66]\n\n(Màiri Stiùbhairt)\n\n1542–1567 8 December 1542\n\nLinlithgow Palace\n\ndaughter of James V and Mary of Guise François II, King of France\n\n24 April 1558\n\nno children\n\nHenry Stuart, Lord Darnley\n\nPalace of Holyroodhouse, Edinburgh\n\n9 July 1565\n\none child\n\nJames Hepburn, 4th Earl of Bothwell\n\nPalace of Holyroodhouse\n\n15 May 1567\n\nno children 8 February 1587\n\nFotheringhay Castle, Northamptonshire, England\n\naged 44 (executed) daughter of James V (cognatic primogeniture) James VI[67]\n\n(Seumas VI Stiùbhairt)\n\n1567–1625 19 June 1566\n\nEdinburgh Castle\n\nson of Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley and Mary I Anne of Denmark\n\nOld Bishop's Palace, Oslo, Norway\n\n23 November 1589\n\nseven children 27 March 1625\n\nTheobalds House, Hertfordshire, England\n\naged 58 son of Mary I (primogeniture) Charles I[68]\n\n(Teàrlach I Stiùbhairt)\n\n1625–1649 19 November 1600\n\nDunfermline Palace\n\nson of James VI and Anne of Denmark Henrietta Maria of France\n\nSt Augustine's Church, Canterbury, England\n\n13 June 1625\n\nnine children 30 January 1649\n\nPalace of Whitehall, Westminster, England\n\naged 48 (executed) son of James VI (primogeniture) Charles II[69]\n\n(Teàrlach II Stiùbhairt)\n\n1649–1651 29 May 1630\n\nSt James's Palace, Westminster, England\n\nson of Charles I and Henrietta Maria of France Catherine of Braganza\n\nPortsmouth, England\n\n14 May 1662\n\nno children 6 February 1685\n\nPalace of Whitehall\n\naged 54 son of Charles I (primogeniture)\n\nMain article: Scotland under the Commonwealth\n\nWith the Scottish Restoration, the Stuarts became Kings of Scotland once more but Scotland's rights were not respected. During the reign of Charles II, the Scottish Parliament was dissolved and James was appointed Governor of Scotland. James II himself became James VII in 1685. His Catholicism was not tolerated, and he was driven out of England after three years. In his place came his daughter Mary and her husband William of Orange, the ruler of the Dutch Republic. The two were accepted as monarchs of Scotland after a period of deliberation by the Scottish Parliament and ruled together as William II and Mary II.\n\nAn attempt to establish a Scottish colonial empire through the Darien Scheme, in rivalry to that of England, failed, leaving the Scottish nobles who financed the venture for their profit bankrupt. This coincided with the accession of Queen Anne, daughter of James VII. Anne had multiple children but none of these survived her, leaving as her heir her half-brother, James, then living in exile in France. The English favored the Protestant Sophia of Hanover (a granddaughter of James VI) as heir. Many Scots preferred Prince James, who as a Stuart was a Scot by ancestry, and threatened to break the Union of Crowns between England and Scotland by choosing him for themselves. To preserve the union, the English elaborated a plan whereby the two Kingdoms of Scotland and England would merge into a single Kingdom, the Kingdom of Great Britain, ruled by a common monarch, and with a single Parliament. Both national parliaments agreed to this (the Scots albeit reluctantly, motivated primarily by the national finances), and some subterfuge as a total majority of signatories were needed to ratify the Scottish parliament's assent, bribes, and payments. Thereafter, although monarchs continued to rule over the nation of Scotland, they did so first as monarchs of Great Britain, and from 1801 of the United Kingdom.\n\nName Portrait Birth Marriage(s) Death Claim Charles II[69]\n\n(Teàrlach II Stiùbhairt)\n\n1660–1685 29 May 1630\n\nSt James's Palace\n\nSon of Charles I and Henrietta Maria of France Catherine of Braganza\n\nPortsmouth, England\n\n14 May 1662\n\nNo children 6 February 1685\n\nPalace of Whitehall\n\nAged 54 Son of Charles I (primogeniture) James VII[70]\n\n(Seumas VII Stiùbhairt)\n\n1685–1688 14 October 1633\n\nSt James's Palace\n\nSon of Charles I and Henrietta Maria of France Anne Hyde\n\nThe Strand, London, England\n\n3 September 1660\n\nEight childrenMary of Modena\n\nDover, England\n\n21 November 1673\n\nSeven children 16 September 1701\n\nChâteau de Saint-Germain-en-Laye, France\n\nAged 67 Mary II[71]\n\n(Màiri II Stiùbhairt)\n\n1689–1694 30 April 1662\n\nSt James's Palace, England\n\nDaughter of James VII (II of England) and Anne Hyde St James's Palace\n\n4 November 1677\n\nNo children.

The Acts joined the Kingdom of England and the Kingdom of Scotland to form a united Kingdom of Great Britain.[73]\n\nScotland and England had shared a common monarch since the Union of the Crowns in 1603 when the Scottish king James VI succeeded to the English throne. Although described as a Union of Crowns, before the Acts of Union of 1707, the crowns of the two separate kingdoms had rested on the same head. Three unsuccessful attempts (in 1606, 1667, and 1689) were made to unite the two kingdoms by Acts of Parliament, but it was not until the early 18th century that the idea had the will of both political establishments to succeed, thereby bringing the two separate states together under a single parliament as well as a single monarch.\n\nMain article: Jacobite succession\n\nJames VII continued to claim the thrones of England, Scotland, and Ireland. When he died in 1701, his son James inherited his father's claims and called himself James VIII of Scotland and III of England and Ireland. He would continue to do so all his life, even after the Kingdoms of England and Scotland were ended by their merging as the Kingdom of Great Britain. In 1715, a year after the death of his half-sister, Queen Anne, and the accession of their cousin George of Hanover, James landed in Scotland and attempted to claim the throne. He failed and was forced to flee back to the Continent. A second attempt by his son Charles, on behalf of his father, in 1745–6, also failed. Both James's children died without legitimate issue, bringing the Stuart family to an end.\n\n\"James VIII\", also known as The Old Pretender, son of James VII, was claimant from 1701 until he died in 1766.\n\n\"Charles III\", also known as The Young Pretender and often called Bonnie Prince Charlie, son of James VIII, was claimant from his father's death until his death in 1788 without legitimate issue.\n\n\"Henry I\", brother of Charles III and youngest son of James VIII. Died unmarried in 1807.\n\nAfter 1807, the Jacobite claims passed first to the House of Savoy (1807–1840), then to the Modenese branch of the House of Habsburg-Lorraine (1840–1919), and finally to the House of Wittelsbach (since 1919). The current heir is Franz, Duke of Bavaria. Neither he nor any of his predecessors since 1807 have pursued their claim.\n\nIn 1971, Ugandan President Idi Amin proclaimed himself to be the uncrowned king of Scotland,[74] although this claim gained no international recognition.\n\nThe Scottish coronation oath sworn by James VI, Charles I, and Charles II and approved by the Parliament of Scotland in 1567:\n\nI, N.N., promise faithfully, in the presence of the eternal, my God, that I, enduring the whole Course of my Life, shall serve the same Eternal, my God, to the utmost of my Power, accordingly as he required in his most Holy Word, revealed and contained in the New and Old Testament; and according to the same Word shall maintain the true Religion of Jesus Christ, the preaching of his Holy Word, and due and right administration of his Sacraments, now received and practised within this Realm; and shall abolish and oppose all false Religion contrary to the same; and shall rule the People committed to my Charge, according to the Will and Command of God, revealed in his foresaid Word, and according to the lovable Laws and Constitutions received in this Realm, in no way repugnant to the said Word of the Eternal, my God; and shall procure to my utmost to the Kirk of God and whole Christian people true and perfect Peace in all times coming; the Rights and Rents, with all just privileges of the Crown of Scotland, I shall preserve and keep inviolate, neither shall I transfer nor alienate the same; I shall forbid and repress in all Estates and all Degrees theft, Oppression and all kind of Wrong; in all Judgements, I shall command and procure that Justice and Equity be kept to all creatures without exception, as he be merciful to me and you that is the Lord and Father of all Mercies; and out of all my lands and empire I shall be careful to root out all Heresy and Enemies to the true Worship of God, that shall be convicted by the true Kirk of God of the foresaid Crimes; and these Things above-written I faithfully affirm by my solemn Oath.\n\nThe coronation oath sworn by William II, Mary II and Anne was approved by the Parliament of Scotland on 18 April 1689.[75] The oath was as follows:\n\nWE William and Mary, King and Queen of Scotland, faithfully promise and swear, by this our solemn Oath, in presence of the Eternal God, that during the whole Course of our Life we will serve the same Eternal God, to the uttermost of our Power, according as he has required in his most Holy Word, revealed and contained in the New and Old Testament; and according to the same Word shall maintain the true Religion of Christ Jesus, the preaching of his Holy Word, and the due and right Ministration of the Sacraments, now received and preached within the Realm of Scotland; and shall abolish and gainstand all false Religion contrary to the same, and shall rule the People committed to our Charge, according to the Will and Command of God, revealed in his aforesaid Word, and according to the laudable Laws and Constitutions received in this Realm, no ways repugnant to the said Word of the Eternal God; and shall procure, to the utmost of our power, to the Kirk of God, and whole Christian People, true and perfect Peace in all time coming.
