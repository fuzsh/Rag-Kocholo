        "text": "Brothers Malcom and William were the two kings that ascended following the death of their grandfather David I. Their father was Henry, the Earl of Huntingdon and Northumbria, one of David's children.\n\nMalcolm IV\n\nQuick Facts:\n\nBorn: 1141\n\nDied: 1165\n\nReign: 1153-1165\n\nParents: Henry Earl of Huntingdon and Northumbria and Ada de Warrene\n\nPredecessor: David I\n\nSuccessor: William I\n\nSpouse: None\n\nRoyal House: Dunkeld\n\nMalcolm IV was only 11 when he was made heir and would also die young, only living until the age of 24. He was known throughout his reign as Malcom the Maiden, which may suggest a weakness, however he was recorded as being someone who had an interest in knighthood and warfare. He was however plagued with ill health for his whole life and died unmarried, leaving his younger brother to succeed him.\n\nAs a new and young king, Malcom IV faced threats from all angles. In Scotland, his relative William Fitz Duncan was the noble’s preferred king and he also received opposition from the descendants of Alexander I’s illegitimate son. Other rulers also had their eyes on Scotland, including Henry II, the King of England, and the Earl of Orkney. His first opposition came from family rivals, however, their support soon dwindled.\n\nAs well as being king of Scots, Malcolm also inherited the Earldom of Northumbria, which was granted to his brother William and had been won during the Anarchy. Though his by right, Henry II refused to allow Malcolm to keep his lands in England or William to remain the Earl of Northumbria, instead creating the Earldom of Huntingdon, which was given to Malcolm. From here onwards, he would have a difficult relationship with the King of England. At times they were allies, including in 1159 when Malcolm joined Henry in France where the pair fought at the siege of Toulouse and where he received his knighthood.\n\nHe would be taken ill in 1163 while paying homage to Henry in Doncaster. He was betrothed at the time, but died before the marriage could take place. It is believed that he was suffering from Paget’s disease. While some historians say he had the makings of a fine king, he was too young, too inexperienced and served too short a reign for anyone to make a definitive decision on this.\n\nWilliam I\n\nKnown as William the Lion, William I has the second longest reign in Scottish history, spanning 49 years.\n\nQuick Facts:\n\nBorn: 1142\n\nDied: 1214\n\nReign: 1165-1214\n\nParents: Henry, Earl of Huntingdon and Northumbria and Ada de Warrene\n\nPredecessor: Malcom IV\n\nSuccessor: Alexander II\n\nSpouse: Ermengrade de Beaumont\n\nChildren: Margaret, Countess of Kent; Isabella, Countess of Norfolk; Alexander II of Scotland and Majorie, Countess of Pembroke.\n\nRoyal House: Dunkeld\n\nAt the age of 10, William’s father died and his brother was made heir presumptive to the Scottish throne, which was held by his grandfather. He was named Earl of Northumbria, however, this was removed from him by Henry II of England. His brother, Malcom IV did not spend long on the throne, dying in his twenties without issue. William was named heir and was crowned on Christmas Eve 1165, in contrast to his brother, he was headstrong and healthy and was an effective monarch who spent much of his time trying to regain control of Northumbria from Henry II.\n\nAfter his accession to the throne, William spent time in the court of the English king quarrelling with Henry before making an alliance with France, which led to the Battle of Alnwick. During the battle, William was captured and held at Northampton before being moved to Normandy, while Henry occupied his lands in Scotland. In order to regain his kingdom and secure his release, William had to acknowledge Henry as his superior and pay for the cost of the English army occupying Scotland. He was released and swore fealty to Henry in 1175 at York Castle.\n\nThe terms of his release triggered a revolt in Galloway. William personally led a force northwards and established a series of castles, regaining his land and deterring the Earls of Orkney from expanding south. The treaty remained in place for the next fifteen years until King Richard the Lionheart agreed to terminate it in return for funds to go on crusade. From here onwards, William was able to reassert his authority and put down any insurrection bringing more territory under the crown. He did attempt to buy back Northumbria from the English, but was rejected, as Richard did not want any castles to be built within the land.\n\nUnder William, the Scots regained their independence, but it was not an easy relationship with their neighbours in England, especially after Richard’s brother, King John, attempted to overthrow him. William was known to throw himself into government with energy and diligence, extending the policies of his grandfather, David I.\n\nHe died of natural causes aged 72, his son Alexander II then succeeded him as king."
