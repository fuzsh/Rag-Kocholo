        "text": "The King of France, Louis VII, annulled his marriage to Eleanor of Aquitaine in 1152, as no male heir could be produced. Henry and Eleanor married the same year, expanding Henry's territory further. So much so in fact, that Henry ruled more land than his overlord, Louis VII of France!\n\nEleanor of Aquitaine was a powerful woman, and one of the wealthiest women in Europe. She inherited the Duchy of Aquitaine from her father, William X, in 1137. Later on in her marriage to King Henry II, she would prove to be a force to be reckoned with, and would not take second place to any mistresses of the king!\n\nAccession to the English Throne\n\nIn 1153, Henry invaded England with a small army, and with gathering Angevin support he tried to conquer the north of England. However, a truce was formed with King Stephen much to the outrage of Eustace, Stephen's son. Shortly after, Eustace died suddenly and Stephen had no choice but to accept Henry's accession to the throne of England. King Henry II now ruled over England and most of France.\n\nKing Henry II the Castle Breaker\n\nThe first agenda on Henry's list as king, was to re-establish royal authority and complete dominance, over the powerful Anglo-Norman barons. These barons had been doing as the please, pretty much, during King Stephen's reign and the Anarchy civil war. Creating their own realms within the kingdom, and ruling as they please. This, in the eyes of King Henry II, had to be stopped. Henry set about destroying all unlicensed castles across England, tearing down and slighting so many, that the king would become known as the 'Castle Breaker'.\n\nThe next task on his list, was to regain his lost territories in Northumbria and Cumbria, from Malcolm IV of Scotland; and secure vassalage from the princes in Wales. These were successful campaigns, and a few years after King Henry II's accession to throne, England was stable. Henry could now afford to travel extensively throughout his territories in England and France, spending most of his time in the latter. His lands would flourish under his control, and Henry was secure in the knowledge that he had the backing of Pope Adrian IV (an Englishman, born Nicholas Breakspear), who fully recognised Henry's kingship and his authority over Ireland.\n\nKing Henry II establishes Assizes of Clarendon and Northampton\n\nLawlessness and land ownership entitlement was a big problem during this time, and something that needed controlling. Land owners leaving the country for extended periods on Crusades, would return to find squatters taking up home in their castles and houses. Mercenaries left over from the civil war, who no longer had lords to pay them, would begin spates of robbery and violence.\n\nIn 1166, King Henry II set about to improve procedures relating to common law, in the Assize of Clarendon, to address these issues. At the royal hunting lodge of Clarendon, Henry and his lords established the first trial by jury, consisting of 12 men in each hundred and 4 men in each township. The jury would be responsible for naming any criminal suspected of serious crimes in their area, including robbery and murder. Usually amputating a foot was the punishment, however execution was also used for more serious crimes. However, this led to some miscarriages of justice, where accusers would wrongly accuse defendants of crimes they perhaps did not commit.\n\nIn 1176, the assizes were updated with the Assize of Northampton. Forgery, counterfeiting and arson where now included in the list of crimes, and punishment could be the amputation of a hand too. Furthermore, the Assize of Northampton appointed six groups of justices to tour the country. Their role was to uphold the rights of land owners, making the possession of land guaranteed by law. This allowed judges to recover lost lands for their returning true owners. These assizes managed to transfer power from local barons to the royal court and judges.\n\nKing Henry II and the Murder of Thomas Becket\n\nKing Henry II was growing increasingly concerned over the Church's power and dominance. Henry, who was renowned for his ability to control and establish order under his command, found that he could not do so with the Church, and in particular his once friend, Thomas Becket. Thomas Becket was the Archbishop of Canterbury, and held significant power.\n\nHenry, who was cracking down on lawlessness, had delivered the Constitutions of Clarendon to the church, for them to sign and approve. The Constitution was an attempt to curb the Church's power and the extent of Papal authority in England. Restoring the judicial systems back to the royal court, just as they were during the reign of Henry's grandfather, King Henry I. One of the laws in the Constitution was that all priests would have to be tried in a royal court, under a royal judge, if they had committed a crime. Before this law, they would have been tried by a bishop instead.\n\nThomas Becket refused to accept and sign this new law. King Henry II was outraged, and a heated argument followed at the great council in Northampton Castle, in 1164. Thomas Becket and his family were forced into exile, and fled England, remaining in exile for six years. During the six years, the Pope acted as an intermediary between King Henry II and Thomas Becket. Becket, at one point, threatened to excommunicate England, but the Pope voted for a more diplomatic solution."
