His succession was guaranteed. The problem with Henry is that he was immensly popular in both Englands and France at the time, and as he has most of Northern France under his control and unless Stephen manages to ensure his son to the succession Henry will still be the main contender to the throne of England.\n\nYou would actually have to butterfly Henry away completely before 1150.\n\nBesides from the obvious reason, that a foreign monarch who also holds lands as a vassal in your realm can be difficult and even annoying, Henry II of England certainly knew that, because he held that position in France , were there other reasons for Henry II to deprive William from that title?\n\nD. not think that the success of William the Lion in securing Northumbria could butterfly Henry II away.

Hell, i don't even want to think of it too much. Love Henry II and all those Plantagenets.\n\nBesides from the obvious reason, that a foreign monarch who also holds lands as a vassal in your realm can be difficult and even annoying, Henry II of England certainly knew that, because he held that position in France , were there other reasons for Henry II to deprive William from that title?\n\nWell i have no idea why William even got the title and why he was kicked off, not much information on it i'd say.\n\nThat's what the OP states.\n\nPractically i think that that is impossible. Hell, i don't even want to think of it too much. Love Henry II and all those Plantagenets.\n\nLol well im not that sure they could hold it for that long unless England gets more distracted with other things and maybe Scots kings start to go down to be based around Northumbria more if they keep it.\n\nWell i have no idea why William even got the title and why he was kicked off, not much information on it i'd say.\n\nI know that William the Lion inherited the title from his brother Henry of Scotland and that it was king David of Scotland, who 'convinced' king Stephan of England to grant the title to Henry of Scotland, who was a grandson and heir of a previous earl of Northumbria.\n\nHowever I still don't know why William the Lion lost that title.\n\nWilliam had to give it up to Henry II in 1157. Something about paying Homage to lands in England. Given that Northumbria is always an boundary issue between England and Scotland it was probably inevitable. I actually think that Henry installed William as the heir to the Earldom of Northumberland after, though only for a little while before it was officially given to the Percy family.\n\nIt really depends on how strong or unified Scotland is at the time. If they can enforce the claim or not to northumbria is dependent on this. If there was a weaker English King, then yes, i would suspect that the territory would remain in scottish hands.\n\nBut would it be in Scottish hands? The king of Scotland would have been earl of Northumbria (and Huntingdon) in England in the same way as king Henry II of England was duke of Normandy and count of Anjou in France.\n\nPretty much, he would be an English vassal for his English holdings, while being a sovereign king in Scotland.\n\nThat scottish have always claimed that territory. He may be a scottish vassal of the English King, but still, with the OP states that if you butterfly away Henry II as king, and he is replaced with, hypothetically, Stephen's son, who for all we know could be incompetent, and considering the situation at the time with the war between Matilda and Stephen, they could successfully conquer Northumbria and actually take it away from the English."
