Some earlier monarchs may have used badges but there is no certain evidence of systematic use. It is conjectured that a lion was the badge of Henry l and Henry ll may have borne two lions as arms. At a later date lions became the arms of the Duchy of Normandy and these have been assigned as ares to William l, ll, Henry l & ll. Stephen appears to have used a centaur as a badge.\n\nJohn K. Bromilow, Okehampton United Kingdom\n\nThe reason is that the lion was thought to be the animal that best personify qualities of 'Britishness' ....Strength, courage, dignity, pride etc. They presumably didn't think any native animals had the necessary qualities.\n\nPhil, Miton UK\n\nThe lion (red on yellow background) is the symbol of Scotland. Three lions are the symbol for England. It has nothing to do with 'Britishness' or British characteristics, as Britishness did not exist as a concept when these badges were adopted. Other medieval kingdoms had similar badges. Denmark had three lions too.\n\nR Tanner, Dunino Fife\n\nActually, I believe the Lion had nothing to do with the Normans - it became associated with the royal family after the marriage of Eleanor of Aquitaine to Henry II. The Lion derived from the coat of arms of the Duchy of Aquitaine - Eleanor's family. Naturally, of course, the Lion as a symbol of British \"pride\" and might was forever identified with Eleanor's irascible, irresponsible but fearless son, Richard I the Lionheart.\n\nNick, London England\n\nIf anyone have brains they will know that the lion is an African animal. There is more that they are not saying. But everyone knows that the queen family have African blood.\n\nSha sha, Brooklyn new york United states\n\nI wonder how the \"English\" emblem resonates with the religious concept of Christ being called \"The Lion of Judah\" in the New Testament.\n\nTimothy , secaucus U.S.\n\nMaybe the Romans brought a lion or two over, but very few British people would know the animal until later, I think. Nick, from London - Richard 'Coeur de Lion' was a Norman. That's why he was in France so much, using English soldiers to fight for his French lands.\n\nChris , Burnley, UK\n\nAdd your answer"
