        "text": "1.Origin\n\nRoyal emblems depicting lions were first used by Danish Vikings, and Germanic Saxons around the 5th century. They were re-interpreted in a Christian context in the western kingdoms of Gaul and Northern Italy.\n\nThe lion represents: majesty, strength, courage, justice and military might.\n\nIn almost every culture the lion was also present. Hittites, Assyrians, Babylonians, Persian and many early islamic cultures. It’s not hard to understand, after all the lioness is a dedicated mother and ruthless hunter, the male lion a majestic animal that defends his pride with fury. A good role model for early civilisations.\n\nIronically, lions did actually roam the UK but died out in the UK around 14,000 years ago. Their extinction coincides with the point humans were getting into farming as the ice retreated from northern hemispheres. The lions on coat of arms or shields represent all that make lions seem so mighty.\n\nRichard I (AKA Richard the Lionheart, 1157 - 1199) first great seal shows one lion rampant (standing). The seal only depicts half Richard’s shield, as he is facing sideways, making it likely there was a second lion on the other half of the shield facing the first lion, probably fighting with it.\n\nRichard I clearly liked lions far more than he did England, which he barely visited, spending most of his time fighting in the crusades and in France.\n\nDuring his reign as king (1189) he introduced three lions passant as the royal arms. The three lions is thought to represent Richard I's principal three positions as King of the English, Duke of Normandy, and Duke of Aquitaine.\n\nThe blazon of the arms of Plantagenet is: “Gules, three lions passant guardant in pale or armed and langued azure” ie: three identical gold lions with blue tongues and claws, walking past but facing the observer, arranged in a column on a red background”.\n\nAlthough the blue tongue and claws is not cited in many blazons, they are historically a distinguishing feature of the arms of England.\n\nThis coat of arms has not altered since it took a fixed form in the reign of Richard I of England, the second Plantagenet king.\n\nAfter the Union of the Crowns in 1603, when the Kingdom of England and the Kingdom of Scotland entered a personal union, the arms of England and Scotland were marshalled (combined) in what has now become the royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom.\n\nThe three lions shield can be seen today on the England football team kit and is recognised around the world."
