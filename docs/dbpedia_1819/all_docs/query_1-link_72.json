        "text": "The Catholic Church dominated with its mix of\n\nA. Roman imperialism\n\nB. Christian ethics\n\nBook 2: Chapter 11: Growth Amid Turmoil -- pp. 130-145\n\nIn the midst of William IIs rule, and his attempt to consolidate and hold power, came the crusades. His brother, Robert, in Normandy went to the crusade. In 1095 Pope Urban II called for crusaders against the Muslims, and especially the Turks in the east.\n\nHenry, the third son of William, consolidated rule and made peace with the Saxons by marriage. He awaited his brother Roberts return from the crusades since Robert still held Normandy.\n\nBetween 1100 and 1105 Henry:\n\nDefeated Robert\n\nTook control of Normandy\n\nBrought the Saxons into government and the fold of the crown.\n\nHenry consolidated his power and became defender to the people against older practices.\n\nAfter Henry died there was great turmoil and several years of civil war.\n\nHenrys daughter, Maud fought for the crown, and her son, Henry Plantagenet married Eleanor of Acquitaine. Thus Henry had ½ of France as well as all of England.\n\nI might note that my own family history goes back to the time when Maud was briefly Queen of England. Her caterer (which I presume means main cook) was a directl line grandfather of mine some 30+ generations removed.\n\nBook 2: Chapter 12: Henry Plantagenet -- pp. 146-157\n\nHenry IIs regime was an important era:\n\nHe united England, Scotland and Ireland.\n\nThere was consolidation of royal power.\n\nHe developed a central royal power to replace the feudal system.\n\nHe established English common law to replace Roman law.\n\nHe limited the Churchs civil power, but it remained a Catholic land.\n\nThomas Becket was Henrys most trusted friend and counselor. The church and state each had an area of power and Henry appointed Becket as Archbishop of Canterbury.\n\nHowever, as archbishop Becket challenged Henry and was driven abroad. Henry advanced his own son as king and seeming made peace with Becket who returned to England, but revised the coronation. Henry was furious and had some of his minions kill Becket.\n\nThis ultimately brought Henry down. He finally made peace with Rome, but Rome kept an independent religious authority all the way until the Reformation.\n\nEventually Henry died in 1189 at the hands of his rebelling sons.\n\nBook 2: Chapter 13: The English Common Law  pp. 158-165\n\nHenry IIs most important contribution was the English Constitution and development of English Common Law.\n\nThis was a slow change over 35 years of rule. Slowly he replaced trial by battle and other means to trial by jury. Early on these juries were not the modern sort where the jurors didnt know the case or people, but the opposite. It was a jury of people who actually knew the people and the case itself. Slowly the custom of royal courts became institutionalized. Out of the period a law of the land developed.\n\nBook 2: Chapter 14: Coeur de Lion  pp. 166-177.\n\nIn 1187 Salidins Moslem army took Jerusalem. Henry II died and his son, Richard I took over. He ruled for 10 years but only visited England twice and that only for a few months. He was a warrior.\n\nIn 1190 he went on crusade. His mother, Eleanor of Aquitane oversaw England.\n\nIn 1193 Richard finally set out for home but was captured and held in Germany. William Longchamp, a bishop, cared for Richards England. Prince John, Richards brother, was opposed to his brother Richard.\n\nIn March 1194 Richard arrived back in London, but soon returned to France to hold his lands there and died of a wound in 1199.\n\nBook 2  Chapter 15. Magna Carta.  pp. 177-189\n\nAfter Richard died John became King of England. He had quite contradictory qualities:\n\nRuthless\n\nCrafty\n\nCapable\n\nAt times even generous\n\nChurchill argues:\n\nMoreover, when the long tally is added it will be seen that the British nation and the English-speaking world owe far more to the vices of John than to the labours of virtuous sovereigns; for it was through the union of many forces against him that the most famous milestone of our rights and freedom was in fact set up.\n\nBy 1204 John had lost all his French lands and retired to England.\n\nIn 1205 John faced a crisis:\n\nHe lost Normandy and now only held England.\n\nHis mother, Eleanor, died and many in England only respected her and not John.\n\nHubert Walter died. He was a popular governor for the Plantagenets for the past 10 years.\n\nThere were serious problems with the church.\n\nJohn faced several years of battle with Rome and the rising power of a French alliance with the Vatican which brought John to a desperate situation.\n\nIn what Churchill describes as a brilliant stroke of government John capitulated to the Pope and England became part of the Holy Roman with the Pope making John his vassal in charge of England. John got everything he wanted, and even the French armies could not invade.\n\nIn 1215 John and the Archbishop solved their problems of his revolt with the Articles of Barons: setting out a real law not dependent upon the kings fiat. This was the basis of the later Magna Carta.\n\nJohn wanted out of the agreement, but soon died. It continued in effect, but not formally recognized for another 200 years. Later Stuarts made it official. While it wasnt a detailed list of rules, it does limit the kings power.\n\nBook 2: Chapter 16: On the Anvil pp. 189-200\n\n1216 brought about the boy king, Henry II. He began his 56 years of rule when just a young boy. There was a great deal of trouble in Henrys middle years caused by his own love of foreigners, especially the French, and his giving power and wealth to them.\n\nBook 2: Chapter 17: Mother of Parliaments -- pp. 200-208\n\nThere was a commission of reform in 1258-59. This formed a parliament to work with the king. It had two roles:\n\nEstablish policy.\n\nHandle legislation and administration.\n\nSimon de Montfort rose to power leading a Community of Bachelors of England, a group of middle class folks. Further a Parliament was established.\n\nEventually this resulted in Civil War which de Montforts forces won in 1264. In 1265 de Montfort himself was killed but the movement lived on.\n\nBook 2:  Chapter 18: King Edward I  pp 208-227.\n\nEdward came to power at age 33. He was a capable ruler and a general. He tried to balance the powers of:\n\nChurch\n\nBarons\n\nKing\n\nPeople\n\nWe must find out what is ours and due to us, and others what is theirs and due to them.\n\nThere was a consolidation  the main term used for this new development:\n\nThe framework and policies of the nation, which we have seen shaping themselves with many fluctuations now set and hardened into a form which, surviving the tragedies of the Black Death, The Hundred Years War with France, and the War of the Roses, endured for the remainder of the Middle Ages, and some of them longer.\n\nEdward did oversee an opposition to Jews, mainly moneylenders, which lead to a four century ban of Jews in England.\n\nAt the same time the development of the long-bow in Wales led to the most powerful weapon of the time.\n\nBefore he died Edward did finally defeat the Scots and bring them into the union. His tomb at Westminster reads: Here lies Edward I, the Hammer of the Scots. Keep troth.\n\nBook 2: Chapter 19: Bannockburn -- pp. 227-234\n\nScotchman Robert Bruce beat back Edward IIs forces at Bannockburn. A stunning defeat.\n\nMore and more power was in the hands of government officials and less decided by martial power.\n\nEdwards wife, Isabella, went back to France and with Prince Edward (only 14) she raised a coup against Edward II and took over.\n\nBook 2: Chapter 20: Scotland and Ireland -- pp. 234-243\n\nRobert Bruces son was a weak king. His rule terminated in establishing the Stuart line, but not all of Scotland accepted them.\n\nHatred of the English was the mark of a good Scot. Though discontented nobles might accept English help and English pay, the common people were resolute in their refusal to bow to English rule in any form. The memory of Bannockburn kept a series of notable defeats at the hand of the English from breeding despair or thought of surrender.\n\nThe Stuarts, James I, II, III couldnt secure Scotland.\n\nFrom late 1100s Anglo-Normans tried to subdue Ireland to England.\n\nIreland had many individual kings (more like tribal leaders) and no central power.\n\nIrelands long anti-Vatican Catholic Church centered in monasteries and restricted Rome and England.\n\nBut Ireland had no central power to successfully resist Anglo-Norman incursions, most led by Welsh who then settle in Ireland permanently.\n\nThe old Irish people and later Norman-Irish were like two totally different people.\n\nTwo races dwelt in uneasy balance, and the division between them was sharpened when a Parliament of Ireland evolved towards the end of the thirteenth century. Form this body the native Irish were excluded; it was a Parliament in Ireland of the English only.\n\nWhile this battle continued to rage the new Anglo-Irish became intermarried with native Irish and saw themselves as more Irish than English.\n\nBy Tudor times, especially Henry VIIIs Reformation, Ireland was open to reconquest. It was totally un-English.\n\nBOOK 2: CHAPTER 21: THE LONG-BOW, pp. 243-258\n\nAt this time the nature of war was changed by the long-bow:\n\nThe power of the long-bow and the skill of the bowmen had developed to a point where even the finest mail was no certain protection. At two hundred and fifty yards the arrow hail produced effects never reached again by infantry missiles at such a range until the American civil war.\n\nThis brought commoners, especially archers, importantly into war.\n\nIn 1337 the 100 Years War began. For England it was first rooted in the wool trade in Flanders. There were great early victories for the English.\n\nBook 2: Chapter 22  The Black Death pp. 258-266.\n\nThe plague entered Europe though the Crimea, and in the course of twenty years destroyed at least one-third the entire population.\n\nAfter the plague the arrival of gunpowder changed warfare in Europe, especially in the early 15th century.\n\nThe Hundred Years War came to a sort of standstill since neither side could win decisively. However, as a matter of expediency great concessions were made during this period that affected Parliaments, especially the House of Commons.\n\nThe concession made by Edward III to the Commons mark a decisive stage. He consented that all aids should be granted only in Parliament. He accepted the formal drafts of the Commons collective petitions as the parliamentary bases for suture statues, and by the time of his death it was recognized that the Commons had assumed a leading part in the granting of taxes and the presentation of petitions.\n\nIn the late 1370s Wyclif led a movement against Rome and its power in England\n\nBook Three: The End of the Feudal Age\n\nBook 3: Chapter 23: King Richard II and the Social Revolt -- pp. 268-285.\n\nWyclif, an Oxford preacher opposed oppression of the underclass especially concerning church-held lands. He failed in his day, but set in motion much of what later developed in the Reformation.\n\nBy 1388 Richard II was beaten and broken but not deposed. But, by 1389, at age 23 he took back full control of the crown.\n\nRichard was working toward full control of England for the crown.\n\nHe fostered and led the Irish expedition\n\nHe established peace with France so there was no war.\n\nHowever, by July 1399 with Richard in Ireland Henry returned from exile to challenge him. Richard soon was forced to submit and Henry IV became king.\n\nBook 3: Chapter 24: The Usurpation of Henry Bolingbroke -- pp. 286-292.\n\nHenrys claim to the throne was denied by France. He himself leaned strongly toward a constitutional monarch. Pressed by everyone on all sides, but especially Scotland and Wales, Henry ceded much power to Parliament.\n\nHe died in 1413. His 13 year rule was quite mixed.\n\nBook 3: Chapter 25: The Empire of Henry V  pp. 292-301.\n\nHenry V was king at age 26. In 1415 he led his army into France on the side of the king of Burgundy. Then, in 1420 French King Charles VI recognized Henry as heir to France and Regent as long as Charles lived.\n\nHenry was of the house of Lancaster, and his claim to the throne was a bit iffy.\n\nHe was more deeply loved by his subjects than any King has been in England. Under him the English armies gained an ascendancy which for centuries was never seen again.\n\nBut Churchill believes he greatly erred with his ambitions in France and his brutal response to the Lollards in England of whom Churchill says:\n\nWe can see that the Lollards were regarded not only as heretics but as what we should now call Christian Communists.\"\n\nBook 3: Chapter 26: Joan of Arc  pp. 302-309.\n\nIn 1429 Orleans was under siege by the English. Joan of Arc rose to help Orleans. With her appeal that she was singled out by God to lead the French several great victories occurred, but she ran into trouble:\n\nIt became clear that she served God rather than the Church, and France rather than the Orleans party.\"\n\nShe was put to death in 1431 and the war then went very much against the English.\n\nBook 3: Chapter 27: York and Lancaster  pp. 310-322.\n\nIn 1431 Henry VI was just 10. He wasnt very bright and the nobles were in ascendency in relation to the king. When he finally wanted to marry at the age of 23 the House of York challenged his right to the throne, claiming they had a better claim. Churchill sees the better strength of the argument was actually on the side of York:\n\nIn these conditions the character of Richard of York deserves close study. He was a virtuous law-respecting, slow-moving, and highly competent prince. Every office entrusted to him by the Lancastrian regime had been ably and faithfully discharged. He had given good service. He would have been content with the government of Calais and what was left of France, but being deprived of this for the sake of Somerset he accepted the government of Ireland. Not only did he subdue part of that island, but in the very process he won the goodwill of the Irish people. Thus we see on the one side a weak King with a defective title in the hands of personages discredited by national disaster, and now with blood-guilt upon them, and on the other an upright and wise administrator supported by a nation-wide party and with some superior title to crown.\n\nIn 1450 the Duke of York came home from Ireland to Wales. By 1452 he marched into London.\n\nHowever, by1454 Henry had both recovered from his metal illness and had a son who could claim the throne by blood-right.\n\nBook 3: Chapter 28: The War of the Roses  pp. 322-335.\n\nThe red rose was the Lancaster family, ironically center in the city of York!\n\nThe white rose was the York family.\n\nFrom 1456-1459 there was an uneasy truce among the various families which disputed the legitimate line toward the crown. However by March 1461 King Edward IV, of the York family, was proclaimed king. By 1464 there was war between the two families, the famous War of the Roses.\n\nBook Three: Chapter 29: The Adventures of Edward IV  pp. 335-351.\n\nEdward was a 22 year old warrior when he took over. He tended to allow others to rule and he played and partied:\n\nLet Warwick and Northumberland and other anxious lords carry the burden of State, and let the King be merry. For a while this suited all parties. The victors divided the spoils; the king had his amusements, and his lords their power and policy.\n\nIn 1464 the king married Elizabeth Woodville who was much below his station in life. Troubles followed since there were again worries about legitimate claims to the throne, so the King sought union with Burgundy, but not France. The war flamed up.\n\nIn 1471 there was a seemingly decisive and crushing victory for the whites, the York line. Edward IV was then supreme. In 1478, to further insure his claim to the crown he had his brother, Clarence, killed, but the king himself died in 1483.\n\nBook 3: Chapter 30: Richard III  pp. 351-368  end of this volume.\n\nEdward died leaving a queen, but she was not accepted by many. Thus the old war between the Lancasters and York flamed up again. Most of the Yorks who could possibly claim the throne were dead. However, the queen did have two sons, and the queen was currently ruling.\n\nThus there were really no serious York candidates, but the Lancaster family also had no strong male candidate for king, so they went to the Tudor family which also had claim to the throne. Richard III became king.\n\nThough risings and conspiracies continued throughout the next reign the strife of the Red and the White Rose had in the main come to an end. Neither won. A solution was reached in which the survivors of both causes could be reconciled. The marriage of Richmond with the adaptable princess Elizabeth produced a Tudor line, in which both Yorkists and Lancastrians had a share. The revengeful ghosts of two mangled generations were laid for ever. Richards death also ended the Plantagenet line.\"\n\nChurchill closes this section of his history by situating the future and summing up the past. He claims this section of Englands history coincides with the end of the Middle Ages:\n\nThe stir of the Renaissance, the storm of the Reformation, hurled their new problems on the bewildered but also reinspired mortals of the new age up which England entered under the guidance of the wise, sad, careful monarch who inaugurated the Tudor dictatorship as King Henry VII.\n\nBob Corbett corbetre@webster.edu\n\nBACK TO BOOK REVIEWS\n\nBecoming Reading Thinking Journals\n\nHOME"
