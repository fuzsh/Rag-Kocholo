        "text": "Since the reign of Henry VIII sixteen Kings have ruled. In the same time period, only six Queens have ruled in their own right. This difference dates back to the ancient laws of inheritance where sons take precedence over daughters. This meant that sons would always inherit the throne and become Kings even if their sisters were older. Only when there are no living sons would a daughter inherit the throne. However, there have been many times when Parliament has changed the laws of succession.\n\nThis online display will look at how Parliament has played a role in determining the inheritance and succession of female monarchs for 513 years from the reign of Henry VIII to Queen Elizabeth II and the often dramatic circumstances surrounding this.\n\nDuring most of this 513-year period women did not have equal rights to men including owning and inheriting property, voting in elections and access to education. The women that did rule as Queens were doing so in male-dominated spaces. Having a female ruler was therefore at odds with the traditional gender dynamic. This might explain why some of our Queens are the most iconic of the monarchs with their reigns being immortalised in popular culture.\n\nThe six Queens we will be looking at today are Mary I, Elizabeth I, Mary II, Anne, Victoria and Elizabeth II. This tale about Queens starts with a King, specifically Henry VIII.\n\nLady Jane Grey and Mary I\n\nFollowing the death of Henry VIII, Edward VI became king. At the time of accession Edward VI was only nine years old and was often sick. His reign was dominated by nobles using the young King to strengthen their own positions.\n\nThe Duke of Northumberland persuaded the sickly Edward VI to name Lady Jane Grey as his heir just before his death on 6 July 1553, cutting out the rightful heir under the 1543 Act, Mary. As one of Henry VIII's great-nieces, Lady Jane was a genuine claimant to the throne but behind Mary and Elizabeth in the line of succession. Northumberland then married Lady Jane to his own son, Lord Guilford Dudley.\n\nEdward VI, Oil painting by Richard Burchett\n\nÂ© UK Parliament, WOA 3196 heritagecollections.parliament.uk\n\nThe Treason Act 1547 made it high treason to interrupt the line of succession to the throne established by the Act of Succession. Edward VI meant to bypass this Act in his \"Devise for the Succession\", issued as letters patent on 21 June 1553, in which he named Lady Jane Grey as his successor.\n\nMary however had not only the 1547 Treason Act and the Third Succession Act on her side but also widespread support.\n\nJane was quickly toppled only nine days after Edwardâs death, her own father even abandoning her cause. She was later executed with her husband. She is sometimes known as the nine day Queen but was never crowned so is not included as one of our Queens in this story.\n\nTreason Act 1547\n\nParliamentary Archives\n\nHL/PO/PU/1/1547/1E6n12\n\nMary I is considered to be Englandâs first uncontested female monarch. She reigned for five years over a country increasingly divided over the Protestant Reformation. Her initial ruling council was a mix of Protestants and Catholics. As her reign progressed Mary I soon moved from simply reversing her fatherâs and Edwardâs anti-Catholic policies to actively persecuting Protestants. In 1555 she revived Englandâs heresy laws and began burning offenders at the stake. Protestants have called her Bloody Mary as a result.\n\nWhen Mary I inherited the throne, she was unmarried and childless. It became a priority to have a child as her Catholic successor as opposed to her Protestant half-sister Elizabeth. Mary I married Philip of Spain in 1554. Philip was a Roman Catholic and the match was unpopular with Parliament. for this reason. Furthermore, they were worried about England becoming a satellite of Spain.\n\nParliament passed the Act for the Marriage of Queen Mary to Philip of Spain to define and limit Philipâs role. For example, Acts of Parliament were to be dated with both their names (with Philip's preceding Mary's as deemed proper for husband and wife), and Parliament was to be called under the joint authority of the couple. The Act stated that King Philip would take part in governing Mary's realms while most authority was reserved for Mary. Although King Philip was to co-reign with his wife, the Act prohibited him from appointing foreigners to any offices, from taking his wife or any of their future children outside her realm, or from claiming the crown for himself should he outlive Mary.\n\nMary I died in 1558, she had no children so her half-sister Elizabeth inherited the throne. Elizabeth I became Englandâs second female monarch."
