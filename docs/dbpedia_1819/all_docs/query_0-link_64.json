He was also the 3rd Earl of Northumberland and the 3rd Earl of the Honour of Huntingdon and Northampton.\n\nHe was the son of King David I of Scotland and Maud, 2nd Countess of Huntingdon. His maternal grandparents were Waltheof, Earl of Northumbria and Huntingdon, (beheaded 1075) and his spouse Judith of Lens.\n\nHenry was named after his uncle, King Henry I of England who had married his paternal aunt Edith of Scotland (the name Edith gallicised as Matilda after becoming Queen consort in 1100). He had three sons, two of whom became King of Scotland, and a third whose descendants were to prove critical in the later days of the Scottish royal house. He also had three daughters.\n\nHis eldest son became King of Scots as Malcolm IV in 1153. Henry's second son became king in 1165 on the death of his brother, reigning as William I. Both in their turn inherited the title of Earl of Huntingdon. His third son, David also became Earl of Huntingdon. It is from the 8th Earl that all Kings of Scotland after Margaret, Maid of Norway claim descent.\n\nOn Henry's death, the Earldom passed to his half-brother Simon II de Senlis.\n\n[edit] FamilyHenry married Ada de Warenne, the daughter of William de Warenne, 2nd Earl of Surrey (died 1138), and Elizabeth of Vermandois, daughter of Hugh of Vermandois, The Great.\n\nAda of Huntingdon (1139â1206), married in 1161, Floris III, Count of Holland.\n\nMargaret of Huntingdon (1145â1201)\n\nMarried [1] in 1160 Conan IV, Duke of Brittany, (died 1171)\n\nMarried [2] Humphrey III de Bohun, Lord of Trowbridge.\n\nMalcolm IV of Scotland.\n\nWilliam I of Scotland.\n\nDavid of Scotland, 8th Earl of Huntingdon.\n\nMatilda of Huntingdon, born and died 1152.\n\nMarjorie of Huntingdon, married Gille CrÃ­st, Earl of Angus.\n\nNote on Wife: Ada + of WARENNE\n\nAda de Warenne (or Adeline de Varenne) (c. 1120â1178) was the Anglo-Norman wife of Henry of Scotland, Earl of Northumbria and Earl of Huntingdon. She was the daughter of William de Warenne, 2nd Earl of Surrey by Elizabeth of Vermandois, and a great-granddaughter of Henry I of France. She became mother to two Kings of Scots, Malcolm the Maiden and William the Lion.\n\nAda and Henry were married in England in 1139.[1] They had six children:\n\nMalcolm IV, King of Scots.\n\nWilliam the Lion, King of Scots\n\nMargaret of Huntingdon married 1) Conan IV, Duke of Brittany and 2) Humphrey III de Bohun.\n\nDavid of Scotland, Earl of Huntingdon married Mathilda (Maud) of Chester. Through their daughter, Isobel, they were the direct ancestors of the renowned Scottish King, Robert the Bruce.\n\nMatilda of Huntingdon, born and died 1152.\n\nMarjorie of Huntingdon, married Gille CrÃ­st, Earl of Angus.\n\nAs part of her marriage settlement, the new Countess Ada was granted the privileges of Haddington, amongst others in East Lothian. Previously the seat of a thanage Haddington is said to be the first Royal burgh in Scotland, created by Countess Ada's father-in-law, David I of Scotland, who held it along with the church and a mill.[2]\n\nIn close succession both her husband and King David died, in 1152 and 1153 respectively. Following the death of Henry, who was buried at Kelso Abbey, King David arranged for his grandson to succeed him, and at Scone on May 27, 1153, the twelve year old was declared Malcolm IV, King of Scots. Following his coronation, Malcolm installed his brother William as Earl of Northumbria (although this county was \"restored\" to King Henry II of England by Malcolm in 1157 [3]), and the young dowager-Countess retired to her lands at Haddington.\n\nOn Thursday December 9, 1165 [4] King Malcolm died at the age of 25 without issue. His mother had at that time been attempting to arrange a marriage between him and Constance, daughter of Conan III, Duke of Brittany, but Malcolm died before the wedding could be celebrated.[5] One of Ada's daughters, Margaret, was married twice:\n\n(1) 1160, Conan IV, Duke of Brittany, Earl of Richmond (d.1171)\n\n(2) Humphrey III de Bohun of Trowbridge, Wiltshire, Hereditary Constable of England.[6]\n\nFollowing his brother's death Ada's younger son William became King of Scots at the age of twenty two. William the Lion was to become the longest serving King of Scots until the Union of the Crowns in 1603.\n\n[edit] Church patronessReligious houses were established in Haddington at an early date. They came to include the Blackfriars (who came into Scotland in 1219) and most notably the Church of the Greyfriars, or Minorites (came into Scotland in the reign of Alexander II), which would become famous as \"Lucerna Laudoniae\"- The Lamp of Lothian, the toft of land upon which it stands being granted by King David I of Scotland to the Prior of St. Andrews (to whom the patronage of the church of Haddington belonged). David I also granted to the monks of Dunfermline \"unam mansuram\" in Haddington, as well as to the monks of Haddington a full toft \"in burgo meo de Hadintun, free of all custom and service.\"[7]\n\nAda devoted her time to good works, improving the lot of the Church at Haddington, where she resided. Countess Ada gave lands to the south and west of the River Tyne near to the only crossing of the river for miles, to found a Convent of Cistercian Nuns (\"white nuns\" [8]) dedicated to St. Mary, in what was to become the separate Burgh of Nungate, the extant remains are still to be seen in the ruined parish church of St. Martin. The nunnery she endowed with the lands of Begbie, at Garvald and Keith Marischal amongst other temporal lands. Miller, however, states that she only \"founded and richly endowed a nunnery at the Abbey of Haddington\" and that \"Haddington, as demesne of the Crown, reverted to her son William the Lion upon her death\".[2]\n\n[edit] Haddington seatAccording to inscriptions within the town of Haddington, Countess Ada's residence was located near the present day County buildings and Sheriff Court. Countess Ada died in 1178 [9] and is thought to be buried locally. Her remaining dower-lands were brought back into the Royal desmesne and William the Lion's wife, Ermengarde de Beaumont, is said to have taken to her bed in Countess Ada's house to bear the future Alexander II. Miller states that when the future King was born in Haddington in 1198 it took place \"in the palace of Haddington\".[10]\n\nSources\n\n1Charles Cawley, \"Kings of Scotland\"."
