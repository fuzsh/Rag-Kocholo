XXIV.\n\nOf Henry II. and by what Methods he would have settled that Homage upon himself and his Heirs, and of the true Form of this Ho∣mage.\n\nHEnry II. received Homage from Mal∣colm Prince of Scotland, according to you Mr. Holinshed, for the Kingdom of Scot∣land; and that he was present with the King of England in the War against the King of France, you take as an unanswerable Argu∣ment, that our League with France was dis∣solv'd by Osbright, and never renewed again. If you had writ simply, without any Additi∣on, that Malcolm had perform'd Homage, it might have been born with; for seeing Mal∣colm enjoyed four large Provinces in Eng∣land, viz. Cumberland, Northumberland, West∣moreland and Huntington, which he did then hold of the English in Fee, what wonder if he perform'd Homage for them? And there∣fore I beseech the candid Reader that he would forbear giving Judgment for a little while, because the Hinge of the Controversy turns wholly upon this Henry II. and Ed∣ward I. and if I be not mistaken, the Truth\n\ndescription Page 285\n\nof the Question will easily appear from the English Annals themselves. We will there∣fore divide the Reign of this Henry II. into two Periods, viz. into that before his taking William King of Scotland Prisoner, and that after. As to the first you write, Mr. Holin∣shed, that Malcolm King of Scots perform'd Homage for the Kingdom of Scotland: But in truth, this smells of excessive Boldness and Impudence, to commit those things to wri∣ting, which may be refuted out of other Writers; and indeed we do all of us owe Thanks to your Hoveden, and to Savil, who lately took care to have him printed, be∣cause they have lighted a Torch to guide us in this Controversy; whereas we should have otherwise been in the Dark.\n\nHoveden then, Mr. Holinshed, does plainly give you and all other English Writers, if there be any who agree with you, the Lie His Words are these;\n\nThat same Year Malcolm King of Scots met the King of England at Chester, and did him Ho••age in the same Manner as his Grand-father perform'd it to old K. Henry II. with a Sal∣vo as to all his own Dignities.\n\nThis is the true Form of the Homage which was always paid to the Kings of England by those of Scotland; in which their own Dignities are manifestly excepted. Now the King of Scots\n\ndescription Page 286\n\nhad no other Dignities but Scotland, which was preserv'd safe and entire in this Homage. Neither was this only true as to Malcolm, says Hoveden, but also as to his Grand-father and Predecessors; and therefore if any Man enquire after the Form of Homage paid by Constantine to Athelstan, it necessarily follows that the same was perform'd with a Salvo to the Royal Dignity: And so the Homage was perform'd to the Conqueror and Henry I. with a Salvo to the Royal Authority, as will ap∣pear more plainly afterwards in our William and your Richard, that you may perceive I deal fairly with you: So that the first part of your Assertion evanishes; and you are certainly a very hair-brain'd Fellow, and one who lies at catch for other Mens Fame, see∣ing you are not asham'd to assert what you cannot prove. That Malcolm accompanied Henry into France, we don't deny; but that he took Arms against the King of France, is false: Nor could Malcolm avoid the Suspici∣on of his Subjects notwithstanding; for when he returned Home, the Scots being highly enraged because they thought that he had carried Arms against the King of France his Ally, they besieged him until such time as he clear'd himself of that Crime; and ac∣quainted them, that having gone to London to perform Homage, he was compell'd by\n\ndescription Page 287\n\nForce to accompany the King of England in∣to 〈◊〉〈◊〉; and so he 〈◊〉〈◊〉 the 〈◊〉〈◊〉 of Scotland. You see then that your Argument from the Breach of the French League, falls to the ground. But this you 〈◊〉〈◊〉 pass'd over in Silence, that when our K. 〈◊〉〈◊〉 conferred the Honour of Knight∣hood upon Henry, that the said Henry did swear solemnly and in express Terms, that he would never redemand Cumberland, 〈◊〉〈◊〉, Westmoreland nor Huntington, which David did then possess in England. My Author is 〈◊〉〈◊〉; and from hence we may easily gather not only that this great Prince was guilty of violating his solemn Oath, but that the King of Scots did at that time enjoy large Dominions in England; for which he ow'd Homage, and not for the Kingdom of Scotland, as you do wilfully dream, Mr. Holin••••ed. What you write of Henry the Second's having adjudg'd the four Dominions above mentioned, to the Crown of England, because of Malcolm's Rebellion, was never as••erted by any but your self; or if otherwise, tell us when, by what Methods, or in what Place did this Rebellion happen: But so it is ordered by Nature, that when a Man delights in an Error, he falls into an in∣finite number of others for the defence of that; and to render the first Lie probable,\n\ndescription Page 288\n\nhe is not afraid to make two or three more: And thus one Error, like a teeming Sow, brings forth abundance of others. As to the Sentence of Adjudication I think nothing strange; for how many times were Norman∣dy, Aquitain, and the rest of the English Pro∣vinces, which they hold in Fee, adjudg'd to the Crown of France by the Senate of Paris? and yet they were never restored until the English were drove thence by force of Arms. It's certain that the English themselves con∣fess that K. Henry did at that time violate his Oath; and when the same was told him to his Face by William King of Scots, he had no∣thing to say in excuse of himself, but that he could not bear with such a Diminution of his Kingdom: An excellent Way indeed of eluding his Oath. Now if any of our Kings had been guilty of such a Crime, how strangely would you have insulted over us as Perfidious, Perjur'd, and Enemies to Man∣kind, and whatever else your paultry Cho∣ler could have suggested; as you are not a∣sham'd to treat us on much slighter Occasi∣ons? And in truth, if we go through all the Kings of England one by one, to the time of Henry VII. there's not one of them whom we shall not find guilty of breaking their Oaths, even you your self being Witness in your History Mr. Holinshed; but you cannot\n\ndescription Page 289\n\nperceive the Bunch on your own Back. That we may return to the Sentence of 〈◊〉〈◊〉, it might perhaps be easily put in Execution in Hu••tington, which is a Mid∣land Country, and far remote from the Bor∣ders of Scotland; but as for Cumberland, Northumberland and Westmoreland, which William of Newbrigs owns to have been pos∣sessed then by the King of Scots, as his pro∣per Right, the Execution was not so easy because they were bordering Countries: and although the English Inhabitants did favour the King of England, they were not reduced under the Dominion of England for an hundred Years after that; for the King of Scots withheld them by Force, as the 〈◊〉〈◊〉 did Normandy, Anjou, Poic••ou, Aqui∣•••• &c. which were frequently adjudg'd to the Crown of France. Any Man who has a Mind to see what your Writers have left on Record concerning this Matter, may easily perceive it at one view; for when the King of Scots demanded the Restitution of those Countries by his Ambassadors, but in vain, Po••••dore says, he sought to right himself by his Arms: and we shall prove from that same Polidore, and the rest of your Histori∣ans, that Huntington remain'd in the Posses∣sion of the Scots until the time of Edward the first, who took it from Iohn Baliol; so\n\ndescription Page 290\n\nthat while you rage against us, you quite forget what you ought to say. Nay, West∣minster takes notice of the Exchange betwixt King William and King Henry II. in 1157; for he says, that the King of Scots restored Carlisle and Bamburgh Castle, with the County of La••don, and that Henry restored the County of Huntington to him: and yet Mr. Holinshed, you are not ashamed, so you can but reproach us on every side, to say. that this County was never restored; for you are so prodigal of your Faith, that you believed those things would never be read by any of our Countrymen. Yea, Matthew Paris writes, that after William was set at Liberty, viz. in 1185, the Earl of Hunting∣ton being dead without Issue, that Henry the second gave that County with its Appurte∣nances to William King of Scots; so little do your Writers agree amongst themselves, and you, Mr. Holinshed, dissent from all of them. So much for Malcom's Homage.\n\nYou will have it that William King of Scots did Homage for his Kingdom, but Po∣lidore and most of the rest do only make mention of the Homage without any Ad∣dition, and some do say that it was for the Kingdom of Scotland. That I may recon∣cile your Writers amongst themselves, we will divide the Reign of this William, as we\n\ndescription Page 291\n\ndid formerly that of your Henry, into two Periods, viz. that before his being made Pri∣soner by the English, and that after. The Form of Homage that he perform'd whilst 〈◊〉〈◊〉 ••reeman, is threefold, as may be seen in 〈◊〉〈◊〉 and Matthew Paris; the first thus, William did Homage to King Richard, in the 〈◊〉〈◊〉 manner as his Brother Malcolm perform'd 〈◊〉〈◊〉 and how that was, we have said already, 〈◊〉〈◊〉 with a Salvo to all his own Dignities: The second thus, That William paid Homage to John his King with a Proviso, to secure his 〈◊〉〈◊〉 Right: The third is thus, as mentioned by Matthew Paris, That Willam did Homage 〈◊〉〈◊〉 the King of England for his Privileges in England. All which Forms center in one, viz. That this Homage was perform'd with a Salvo 〈◊〉〈◊〉 Royal Dignity, and only in Right of those Lands which the King of Scots held in Eng∣land; so that it's certain from your own 〈◊〉〈◊〉, that there was no Homage per∣form'd by King William for the Kingdom of 〈◊〉〈◊〉 while he was at Liberty: and how 〈…〉〈…〉 Fealty does extend which has a Sal∣vo 〈◊〉〈◊〉 or Ordine suo, is shewed by Mat∣thew Paris, in the Oath of Fealty which Richard Prior of Dover took, when he was 〈◊〉〈◊〉 Archbishop of Canterbury, viz. he 〈◊〉〈◊〉 Fealty to the King with a Salvo for those of his Order, i.e. with a Proviso for the\n\ndescription Page 292\n\nEcclesiastical Liberty. But the Truth o•• the Matter of Fact as to this Homage, is to be found in Polidore thus: When William, say the English Historians, had sworn Fealty to Henry for the Counties of Huntington Cumberland and Westmoreland, he hop'd by this Obsequiousness, to have also 〈◊〉〈◊〉 ob∣tain'd the County of Northumberland; 〈◊〉〈◊〉 finding that the King of England invented causes of Delay, he return'd Home very angry, with a Design to recover his Right by Arms, (which are always just and neces∣sary, when Right cannot be obtain'd with∣out them) and when William had tried 〈◊〉〈◊〉 to recover his Due by Intreaties and all fair Means from Henry, who was a hand and covetous Prince, he ravaged all Northumberland; and having sent out his 〈◊〉〈◊〉 to plunder the Country, as he was re∣turning Home by way of Alnwick accom∣panied only with sixty Horse, he fell into an Ambush, (for our Princes were always more gallant than cautious or provident) and being taken, was treated in a barbarous inhumane Manner, carried to Henry with his Feet tied under the Horse's Belly, and kept in very harsh Custody for ten whole Years, though Matthew Paris writes, that he was defeated in a pitch'd Battel and that so great a Multitude of those Scots Pis∣mires\n\ndescription Page 293\n\nwere slain, as cannot be numbred; just as in another Place, he says, that we wage Wa•• like Women! But neither could the bearness of Blood, nor the Merits of 〈◊〉〈◊〉 his Grandfather, who expos'd himself so often to defend Henry's Dignity, prevail any thing in favour of William. And here you say, Mr. Holinshed, that he was oblig'd to part with Huntington, Cumberland and Nor∣thumberland, for his Ransom; from which it is apparent, that he was not only then in Possession of Huntington, but also of Cum∣berland and Northumberland, which you af∣firm to have been taken from him a little before; for he recovered Northumberland from Henry the Son, as is witness'd by Hove∣den: Therefore it is certain that the King of Scots did always owe Homage for Gum∣berland and Northumberland, which over∣turns all your former Arguments.\n\nBut you think this an invincible Argu∣ment to prove your vain Babling, viz. that King William offered a Cloak, a Saddle and lance, at the High Altar in York-Minster, in Token of Homage. But pray, Mr. Ho∣linshed, could not he offer those things with∣out professing himself a Subject to the King of England, or what reference has that Ob∣lation to the Fealty or Superiority of Scot∣land? But every corrupt Judg, says Horace,\n\ndescription Page 294\n\nis a bad enquirer into the Truth. Lewis King of France offer'd at the Tomb of Tho∣mus the Martyr, (as he is call'd by Hoveden) a very large and valuable Golden Cup, and gave for the use of the Monks who serv'd there, 100 Vessels of Wine for ever, to be received at Poysy in France every Year at the sole Charge of the King of France, with an immunity from all Taxes, for whatever was bought for the use of the said Monks in France; must Lewis therefore be said to have paid Homage to the King of England because of this Oblation? So much for the time which preceded William's being made Prisoner. You add amongst other Condi∣tions of his Ransom, Mr. Holinshed, that William promised that he and his Successors should hold the Kingdom of Scotland in Fee of the King of England for ever. I shall not deny the matter of Fact, which is at∣tested by so many English Historians, the Tenour of the Charter or Indenture being also exhibited by Hoveden, Matthew Paris and others, whereby William in express Terms, without any Circumlocution or ge∣neral Clause, confesses, that he acknowledg∣es the King of England his Liege Lord for the Kingdom of Scotland; but I must say, that it was not only contrary to all Law, but Humanity it self, to require of a Man who\n\ndescription Page 295\n\nwas not his own Master, but a Captive, and at that time a Subject of England, an ac∣knowledgment of Superiority over Scotland. Let the Law of Nations plead for us, for all Kingdoms agree in this, that there lies a Claim of Restitution against all Actions ex∣torted by Violence and Force: or let us have the Benefit of the English Law at least, according to the Answer of William Brivier, one of King Henry the 3d's Counsellors, to the Archbishop of Canterbury; and the Ba∣rons when they demanded a Confirmation of their Liberties by the King, viz. That the Liberties which they sought, ought not to be observ'd in Law, because they were extorted by Violence. And therefore the Scots who serv'd under Charles the seventh then Dauphin of France, were altogether in the right in their Answer to King Iames I. (whom Henry V. of England had taken at Sea, contrary to the Faith of a Truce, and carried with him to France, that he might command the Scots to quit the French Service) viz. That they did not acknowledg him for King, so long as he was in the Power of their Ene∣mies; and therefore would not obey his Commands seeing they were not his Subjects. For other wise he being at that time a Subject of England, they did reasonably infer, that they must also become such if they\n\ndescription Page 296\n\nacknow∣ledg'd him for their Liege Lord. Certainly he who is in the Power of an Enemy, or detain'd Captive, may easily be compell'd to do any thing; but the Laws allow him this relief, that being once at Liberty, he is not oblig'd to perform what he promis'd a∣gainst his Will, and therefore whatever was done, said or promis'd by King William then in the Power of his Enemies, detain'd so many Years in strict Custody, and having no Hopes of redeeming himself otherwise, is accounted 〈◊〉〈◊〉 and void in Law; and seeing Princes 〈◊〉〈◊〉 but seldom go to Law with one another, there's no need of a Declara∣tory (to use the Law-Phrase) to make this void in Law. What if Richard King of England, when he was detain'd Captive by Leopold D••ke of Austria, subjected the Crown of England so as to hold in Homage of the 〈◊〉〈◊〉 Duke; must that Homage be therefore accounted Legal, and the King∣dom of England subject to Austria? But that the English may be sensible what In∣conveniences they run themselves into by this Argument' the same Hoveden writes, that this very Richard who was for his Mag∣nani••••ty call'd coeur de Lion, i. e. Lion's Heart, when he was sold by Leopold to the Emperor Henry, and saw no other way of delivering himself from his Captivity, he did\n\ndescription Page 297\n\ndivest himself of the Crown of England, de∣liver it to the Emperor as Universal Mo∣narch, and invested him with his Hat, and the Emperor did straightway, as was agreed on or commun'd before hand in the Presence of the Peers of Germany and England, restore him the foresaid Kingdom of England, to be held of him the said Emperor, on an Annual Tribute of 5000 l. Sterlin, and thereupon he invested Richard with a double Crown of Gold; but the said Emperor did afterwards on his Death-bed quit Claim the said Ri∣chard and his Heirs of those and all other Agreements.\n\nLet those two Princes William and Ri∣chard, and their Actions while Captives be compar'd, and we shall find that one Egg is not more like another, for both of them in their Captivity subjected their Kingdoms to the Power of another: but it's perhaps more dishonourable on Richard's part, who promis'd to pay 5000 l. Sterlin annually as a Tribute; and both of them being at Li∣berty, obtain'd a Remission of this Homage which was extorted by Violence, either from the Lords themselves, or their Heirs. In Richard's Case there was the Emperor's Investiture, in William's none: therefore the English must either be very partial in their own Case, or acknowledg the same thing\n\ndescription Page 298\n\nagainst themselves, which they object against us, viz. That the King of England did sometime pay Homage to the Emperor for the Kingdom of England, as I made it ap∣pear before in the Comparison betwixt our Constantine and Ethelred King of England, Constantine having only made a Surrender, (if it be true what the English say concern∣ing him) but it is certain that Ethelred did reign precariously under Sueno; so that they can find nothing in our William, but what they may find in their own Richard: For as to Henry II. the Subject of the present Dis∣pute, no Body did ever esteem him a good Man, for the few Vertues that he had were exceeded, or at least equall'd by his Vices; and being unmindful of the Oath which he had sworn to our David his Uncle, never to redemand Cumberland, Northumberland and Westmoreland, he sought by all manner of ways, that is, by Force and Fraud, to seize them as the King of France did the English Fees which they held beyond-Sea; for that's a Fault natural to most Kings, that they en∣deavour to enlarge their Dominions right or wrong. But this did not pass unpunish'd in Henry, for on his Death-Bed he curs'd himself and his Childen, and the Day of his Birth; nor could he ever be prevail'd on by the Bishops to absolve his Children from\n\ndescription Page 299\n\nthat Curse, though they did inculcate how much he hazarded his Salvation thereby, But his Son Richard made an intire Restitu∣tion to King William, renounced those Con∣fessions that had been extorted from him, and declared the Kingdom of Scotland free from Homage for all time coming, having ex∣pressly testify'd, that the Homage which was perform'd by his Brother Malcolm and his Predecessors, were only for the Dignities or Privileges which they held in England: and Richard did mightily exceed his Father in Vertue; for Hoveden says, that he did very much enlarge his Father's good Deeds, and diminish'd his evil Ones; those whom his Father disinherited, he restored to their Anti∣ent Rights, whom his Father banish'd he re∣call'd, whom his Father imprison'd he let go free, and those on whom his Father did in∣flict several Punishments unjustly, the Son did cherish and refresh. Let us also hear Hoveden's words concerning the renouncing of this Homage, for he liv'd very near those times . William King of Scots came to Canterbury to the King of England in De∣cember, and did Homage for the Dignities which he was to enjoy in England, (mark those words for his Dignities in England) as Mal∣colm his Brother had enjoy'd them, and King Richard restor'd to him the Castles of Rox∣burgh\n\ndescription Page 300\n\nand Berwick free from all Claims by himself and the Kings of England for ever, and did at the same time quit claim the King∣dom of Scotland from all Allegiance and Sub∣jection to the Crown of England: and for this Restitution of his Castles, and quit claiming the Kingdom of Scotland from all Fealty and Allegiance; and in consideration of King Ri∣chard's Charter to be had thereupon, William King of Scots gave him 10000 Marks, and then Richard made him a Charter in this Form, the Tenor of which I thought fit to insert, because Hoveden is not in every Body's Hand, and that the Truth of this whole Contro∣versy will appear from the same.\n\nRichard, by the Grace of God King of England, Duke of Normandy and A∣quitain, and Count of Anjou. To all Archbishops, Bishops, Abbots, Earls and Barons, Judges and Sheriffs, and to all his Servants and faithful Subjects of Eng∣land, Greeting. Be it known, that we have restored unto our most dear Kinsman William, by the same Grace King of Scots, his Castles of Roxburgh and Berwick, as his own Hereditary Right, and to be pos∣sessed by him and his Heirs for ever. We do moreover quit him from all Agree∣ments and Covenants, which our Father\n\ndescription Page 301\n\nof happy Memory, Henry King of Eng∣land extorted from him by new Charters and his imprisonment, so as he perform intirely and fully to us whatever Malcolm King of Scots his Brother did, or of Right was obliged to do to our Predecessors; and we shall do unto him whatever our Predecessors did, or of Right were ob∣liged to do to the said Malcalm, viz. as to his safe Conduct, coming to, return∣ing from, or staying in our Court, and in all Procurations, Liberties, Dignities, and Honours of Right due unto him, as shall be agreed on by four of our Peers chosen by the said King William, and four of his Peers chosen by us: and if any of our Sub∣jects have incroach'd upon the Borders or Marches of the Kingdom of Scotland, since the Imprisonment of the said King William, without Judgment, it is our Will, that they be intirely restored, and reduc'd to that same State they were in before his Imprisonment. Moreover, as to the Lands which he ought to hold in England, whether in Demain or Fee, viz. in the County of Huntington, and any where else, that he and his Heirs for ever do enjoy them in as full and ample man∣ner as Malcolm possessed, or ought to have possessed them▪ except that the said Mal∣colm\n\ndescription Page 302\n\nor his Heirs did afterwards let out a∣ny part in Fee; and if so, that the Ser∣vices of those Fees shall belong to him and his Heirs; and if our Father gave any thing to the foresaid William king of Scotland, it is our Will that the same be ratified and established. We have also restored unto him the Allegiances (Lige∣antias,) Homages and Charters which our Lord and Father extorted from him by his Captivity; and if any other happen to be found or retain'd through forgetfulness, we command, that they shall be of no Force nor Effect. But he becomes our Liege Man for all those Lands for which his Predecessors became the Liege Men of our Predecessors, and hath sworn Fealty to us and our Heirs. Witness these Pre∣sents.\n\nMatthew Paris subjoins these following Words to the same sense,\n\nWilliam King of Scots did Homage to Richard King of England for his Privileges in England, and Richard restored unto him the Castles of Roxburgh and Berwick, and in conside∣ration of the Restitution of those Castles, the quit claiming of the Kingdom of Scot∣land from Homage, and the Confirmati∣on of his Charter, the said King of Scots gave to the King of England 10000 Marks in Money.\n\ndescription Page 303\n\nNow do not those two Forms of Homage, the one for his Dignities, and the other for his Privileges in England, make it evident to all Men, that the Fealty which the King of Scots swore to the King of England, was only for the Dignities and Privileges which he held in England. But you say, Mr. Holin∣shed, that those Monuments are still in the Custody of the English: For my part I don't believe it; for though your Faith be a Pro∣stitute, or that at least you do assert this up∣on another Man's Credit, yet I look upon those Peers of England, and K. Richard, who says he restored them, to be hor••est and good Men. So that I give you your choice, whe∣ther you had rather that you your self should be accused of Falshood, or your Country∣men of Perjury: for if you have them not when you say you have them, you are guilty of writing a Falshood; but if you really have them, you charge your Country-men with Perjury; when both here, and in the Peace which was agreed on betwixt Edward III. and David Bruce, the King and Peers of England declared upon Oath, that all those Monuments which contain'd any Subjection of Scotland, were faithfully resto∣red; as you your self do also write: And Richard himself confesses that he had re∣turn'd that Charter or Indenture, which K. William had made during his Captivity,\n\ndescription Page 304\n\nto hold the Crown of Scotland in Fee of the Crown of England; and if any other Monu∣ments be retain'd through Forgetfulness they are to be esteem'd void and null Don't you see Mr. Holinshed, what Snares you have brought your self into? As to what concerns those four Castles, they were delivered as Pledges▪ so that on paiment of the Money they were restored. But you say, that the Scots will never be able to prove that the Money was paid. It cannot indeed be easily proved at such an Interval of time, yet the Presctintion of so many Ages takes away all Right of Demand; and the Restitution of the four Castles which were laid in pledg, give ground to presume that the Debt was paid. The Testimony of Robert Mountain which you adduce, is to: no purpose. By these it's as clear as the Sun shine, that there were two Homages perform'd by William; one for the Kingdom of Scotland, which was extorted by Force from him while he was a Prisoner, and is therefore called a New Charter, because there was no such Charter for Homage for the Kingdom of Scotland before that: And I pray you, Mr. Holinshed, what need was there of a New Charter of Homage for Scotland, if there had been any old one? Or what need was there to pro∣vide for that afresh, which you say was suf∣ficiently provided for from the first Original\n\ndescription Page 305\n\nof England? And as to those Lands which he had in England, whether in Demain or in Fee, viz. in the County of Huntington, (which according to you, was lately taken from him, and never restored) K. Richard says in plain terms, that\n\nK. William and his Heirs shall for ever possess them in as am∣ple manner as Malcolm did or ought to have possess'd them; and if his Father granted any thing to K. William, he ratifi∣ed and confirm'd the same: And declares, that he restores all those Allegiances and Charters which Henry extorted from him during his Captivity.\n\nSo that there cannot be a more express Renunciation in Law, than the Restitution of the Obligation by the Creditor to the Debtor; and if it should fall out that any others hapned to be found, or were retain'd through Forgetfulness, the King declares them void and null; reserving however, the Homage of those Lands for which William's Ancestors were Liege-men to his Ancestors.\n\nFor the better understanding of the Clause in this Charter, which is conceived in those Words; As to his safe Conduct, coming to, returning from, or staying in our Court: We must know that it relates to a Controversy betwixt the King of England and King of Scotland, as Prince of Cumberland, Northum∣land and Westmoreland, concerning the Pre∣rogative\n\ndescription Page 306\n\nof the King of England's Court; and whether the King of Scots, because he was his Vasial, ought to appear in the same. The King of Scots denied that he ought to appear in Person at that Court which was held without the Limits of his Fee. The King of England insisted on it, that he ought to appear where-ever he held his Court. The Controversy was decided by the Feudal Law thus; That the Vassal is not obliged to appear in the Court of his Lord, with∣out the Bounds of his Fee, but at his Lord's Charge; and therefore it was transacted, that as often as the King of Scots should be call'd to the King of England's Court, it should be at the King of England's Expence; and that the King of Scots should be receiv'd on the Borders of England by the Nobility of England, viz. one Bishop, one Earl, some Lords and some Knights; who should also attend him back again to his own Borders at the King of England's Charges, who was to allow the King of Scots 5 l. Sterlin per diem for his own Expence. That would seem but a small sum now, though it was then very great, as will appear, if we examine the old Accounts of the English Exchequer. Those things I have touch'd before, and should not insist any further on the Decisi∣on of this Controversy, but that Holinshed's Sawciness is to be quell'd; and that I am\n\ndescription Page 307\n\nforc'd to it by the violent Extortion of that same Homage from us by Edward I. seeing nothing can be said in more plain and ex∣cess Terms than this Charter of Richard's: and indeed it's a Wonder, considering how they strain'd their Wits to the utmost to ••ften this Calumny of Homage upon us, that ever they should have printed Hoveden, or Ma••ew of Paris, who do so expresly and plainly affirm, that this Homage for Scot∣land was violently extorted from K. William 〈◊〉〈◊〉 Henry III. and afterwards remitted by Richard, and that the Homage was only per∣form'd for our Possessions in England. They should have at least curtail'd something which, as I have already hinted, is very fami∣••ar to them, that such an evident Solution of this Controversy might not have been 〈◊〉〈◊〉 in their own Historians: and now, 〈◊〉〈◊〉 the Dormice in the Fable, they are cast 〈◊〉〈◊〉 their own Judgment. But to the rest of 〈◊〉〈◊〉 Objections.\n\nAs to the petty Kings of Galloway, who as you will have it, perform'd Homage to 〈◊〉〈◊〉 if there were nothing else in your whole ••ork to accuse you of Folly and Falshood, his alone is sufficient to make you be hiss'd out of all good Mens Company; for every 〈◊〉〈◊〉 knows that Galloway is none of the 〈◊〉〈◊〉 nor largest Counties in Scotland. Yet\n\ndescription Page 308\n\nyou have first dignified the same with the Title of a Kingdom, and now with that of 〈◊〉〈◊〉 Principality, that so your Country-men may reap the more Glory from a Trifle. If the Princes of Galloway perform'd Homage to any other than their immediate Lord, they committed a very great Absurdity; for Ho∣mage is only due to the immediate Lord although he acknowledg another for his Su∣periour. This then is altogether 〈◊〉〈◊〉 concerning Galloway, which is a Country no•• far from the Borders; for being Rebels to their own Prince, they fled to the King o•• England, and offer'd or perform'd Homage that by his Assistance they might be able 〈◊〉〈◊〉 sustain the Shock of their own King's Indig∣nation: For the King of England was never wanting in his Design, right or wrong, 〈◊〉〈◊〉 lay Claim to any part of Scotland, how little soever, as belonging to him. But the Inha∣bitants of Galloway having pacified their own Prince, did quickly return to their Duty But what's all this to the Superiority over the Kingdom of Scotland? Is it not plain that you endeavour to attain that by foolish Arguments, which you can never do by solid Reason? Cooper, another of your Historians says that this Henry II. did much enlarge the Bounds of his Kingdom; having added Scotland, and all the Islands thereunto. Which"
