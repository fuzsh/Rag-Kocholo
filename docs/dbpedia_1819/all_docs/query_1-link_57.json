        "text": "Midlands Feature - The Movie Succession to the Throne\n\nHaving recently started watching the historical television drama The Tudors (yes, I know it’s not a movie but stick with me on this) I thoroughly enjoyed its mash-up of sex, murder, beheadings and political and religious themes. The fascinating mix of war, melodrama and a splattering of camp, the high production values make this a series well worth catching if you’re interested in Henry VIII and British royal history in general.\n\nBut it got me thinking. As a fan of Cate Blanchett, a viewer could easily do a watch of her brilliant turn as Henry’s daughter Elizabeth in both Elizabeth (1998) and its follow up The Golden Age (2007) as a kind of quasi-sequel. The films continue the political machinations from the time and show another reign of an infamous monarch.\n\nSo coming back to the Midlands, with its swathes of picturesque countryside and regal-like manors and houses, the region even has connections to movies covering monarchs. Haddon Hall in Bakewell was used as Hatfield House in Elizabeth. Henry’s story is also covered in The Other Boleyn Girl (2008) by Justin Chadwick, which starred Scarlett Johansson & Natalie Portman as Mary Boleyn and sister Anne Boleyn. Parts of this film were also shot in the region at Dovedale in Castleton and Haddon Hall, as well as at North Lees Hall. Finally, Belvoir Castle in Leicester is home to the Duke of Rutland & seen in Young Victoria (2009).\n\nBut if you could follow one dramatisation of a monarch’s reign with another, could you do them all? By that I mean can we follow the entire line of succession using movies (and a few TV shows)? Well, my self-imposed challenge was accepted and the results are below. There have been 66 monarchs of England and Britain spread over a period of 1500 years. Many of the productions are about succession so there’s a lot of overlap between multiple films, but I gave myself just one 'get out' by starting the list AFTER the Saxon Kings. So we begin the list at the infamous date of 1066.\n\nThat said, for the Saxon period you can do worse than checking out the 1969 epic Alfred the Great and we begin our full lineage after the death of Harold II and the beginning of the Norman period.\n\nNORMAN KINGS\n\nWILLIAM I (The Conqueror) 1066- 1087 Guillaume, la jeunesse du conquérant (2015)\n\nWILLIAM II (Rufus) 1087- 1100 Blood Royal: William the Conqueror (1990 TV adaptation)\n\nHENRY I 1100-1135 The Pillars of the Earth (2010 miniseries)\n\nSTEPHEN 1135-1154 Cadfael (1994)\n\nPLANTAGENET KINGS\n\nHENRY II 1154-1189 The Lion in Winter (1968)\n\nRICHARD I (The Lionheart) 1189 – 1199 Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves (1991)\n\nJOHN 1199 -1216 Ironclad (2011)\n\nHENRY III 1216 -1272 Becket (1964)\n\nEDWARD I 1272 – 1307 Braveheart (1995)\n\nEDWARD II 1307 – deposed 1327 Edward II (1991)\n\nEDWARD III 1327 – 1377 The Dark Avenger (1955)\n\nRICHARD II 1377 – deposed 1399 Richard II (2012)\n\nHOUSE OF LANCASTER\n\nHENRY IV 1399 – 1413 Chimes at Midnight (1965)\n\nHENRY V 1413 – 1422 Henry V (1944) & Henry V (1989) - both classic adaptations\n\nHENRY VI 1422 – deposed 1461 Beginning of the Wars of the Roses Tower of London (1939)\n\nHOUSE OF YORK\n\nEDWARD IV 1461- 1483 The White Queen (2013 TV)\n\nEDWARD V 1483 – 1483 Richard III (2008)\n\nRICHARD III 1483 – 1485 End of the Wars of the Roses Richard III (1995)\n\nTHE TUDORS\n\nHENRY VII 1485 – 1509 Looking For Richard (1996)\n\nHENRY VIII 1509 – 1547 Carry on Henry (1971) & The Tudors (2007)\n\nEDWARD VI 1547 – 1553 Well, Edward VI is the basis for the Prince & the Pauper and so the best version of that is clearly Trading Places (1983). For a more traditional take check Tudor Rose (1936)\n\nLADY JANE (9 Days Queen) Lady Jane (1986)\n\nMARY I (Bloody Mary) 1553 – 1558 The Other Boleyn Girl (2008)\n\nELIZABETH I 1558-1603\n\nThere are so many films and productions featuring The Virgin Queen but for some of the best check out Elizabeth (1998) and its sequel The Golden Age (2007), Shakespeare in Love (1998) and Anonymous (2011).\n\nTHE STUARTS\n\nJAMES I and VI of Scotland 1603 -1625 Gunpowder, Treason & Plot (2004 TV)\n\nCHARLES 1 1625 – 1649 English Civil War The Devil's Whore (2008 TV)\n\nTHE COMMONWEALTH - declared May 19th 1649\n\nOLIVER CROMWELL, Lord Protector 1653 – 1658 Cromwell (1970)\n\nRICHARD CROMWELL, Lord Protector 1658 – 1659 To Kill A King (2003)\n\nTHE RESTORATION\n\nCHARLES II 1660 – 1685 Restoration\n\nJAMES II and VII of Scotland 1685 – 1688 England My England (1995)\n\nWILLIAM III 1689 – 1702 The League of Gentlemen Apocalypse (2005)\n\nMARY II 1689 – 1694 Orlando (1992)\n\nANNE 1702 – 1714 The First Churchills (1969 TV)\n\nTHE HANOVARIANS\n\nGEORGE I 1714 -1727 The Iron Glove (1954)\n\nGEORGE II 1727 – 1760 Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides (2011)\n\nGEORGE III 1760 – 1820 The Madness of King George (1994)\n\nGEORGE IV 1820 – 1830 Beau Brummell (1954)\n\nWILLIAM IV 1830 – 1837 The Young Victoria (2009)\n\nVICTORIA 1837 – 1901 Mrs. Brown (1997)\n\nHOUSE OF SAXE-COBURG AND GOTHA\n\nEDWARD VII 1901 – 1910 Victoria and Abdul (2017)"
