This year will be filled with excitement, fun, and lots of learning. Your child will be given the tools and the opportunities to really explore knowledge. I believe that learning can be an enjoyable journey, where in the end we can all grow and develop a true love of wisdom and discover our strengths and passions.\n\nI value open communication between school and home. I will keep in contact with you regarding your child's academic gains and/or struggles. If I have any concerns, I will contact you immediately. Moreover, if you feel there is a concern, please contact me as soon as possible. Together you and I can work to ensure that your child is successful.\n\nI know we are going to have a FABULOUS year! If you need anything, please feel free to contact me.\n\nDear Students,\n\nWelcome to 5th grade! We are going to have a great time this year getting to know each other and learning many exciting new things. Because you are getting older, you will be given more responsibilities that will allow you to do more than before. Please talk to me when you have something to share, when you don't understand, or when you're upset. What you have to say is important to me, and I will be here to listen.\n\nI am looking forward to getting to know you very well this year. I want to know what helps you learn, how you like to learn new things, and your opinions. We are going to have a wonderful time this year!\n\nAbout the Teacher\n\nMy name is Mr. David Parks. I completed my Bachelor degree at Mississippi State University in August 1998. I hold a Bachelor of Science in Elementary Education. I am going into my 26th year of teaching. All of my years of teaching have been at Luther Branson Elementary School. I believe this accomplishment is a true blessing because one of my desires growing up is to give back to my community. I am currently the fifth grade math, science, and social studies teacher. I taught fourth grade my first year, third grade my second year, and fifth grade the rest of my years of teaching. I have been blessed to earn the following honors and recognitions during my professional teaching career:\n\nVEX IQ CHALLENGE Teacher of the Year Award, 2021-2022\n\nLuther Branson Elementary School Teacher of the Year Award, 2017 - 2018\n\nMadison County School District Elementary Teacher of the Year Award, 2013 - 2014\n\nLuther Branson Elementary School Teacher of the Year Award, 2013 - 2014\n\nHonor in Excellence Teaching Award, 2013 (100 Black Men)\n\nMetro Teacher Recognition Honoree Award, 2010\n\nLuther Branson Elementary School Teacher of the Year Award, 2002 - 2003"
