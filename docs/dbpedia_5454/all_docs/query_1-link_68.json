        "text": "the john muir exhibit - people - john muir genealogy - john muir exhibit\n\nJohn Muir (1838-1914) Genealogy\n\n\"I heartily congratulate you on your good scotch name. To be born of Scotch parents is a great blessing. Muir is rather a common name in Scotland and whether we are nearly related or not I don't know: but to be Scotch at all and related to the heather moorland or Muirlands is a grand fortune.\"\n\n- John Muir - letter to Mrs. Muir Webster, December 15, 1906.\n\nAncestors, Siblings, Spouse, and Descendants\n\nSee also:\n\nJohn Muir's Gravesite\n\nJohn Muir's Scottish Ancestry: Muir Clan or Gordon Clan? by Harold Wood\n\nDaniel Muir Family Tree - Descendants of John Muir's father, Daniel Muir, from WikiTree (offsite link)\n\nFor in-depth genealogical research, we recommend using one of the numerous genealogy websites such as Ancestry.com, FamilySearch, MyHeritage or WikiTree. The University of Pacific Muiriana Collection section of the John Muir Papers contains some genealogical information as well. This page only covers the naturalist John Muir and his immediate descendants. You will need to use a more robust search engine to study the descendants of his siblings (who are only briefly mentioned here), or of his maternal or paternal grandparents. Notably, this kind of research can be complicated because \"Muir\" is a rather common surname, especially in former British colonies like USA, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, etc. not to mention Scotland and England. Finally, most of Muir's living descendants do not share his surname.\n\nAncestors of John Muir\n\nJohn Muir's Paternal Grandparents\n\nJohn Muir - of Crawfordjohn, Lanarkshire, Scotland\n\nSarah Higgs Muir, - from Manchester, England\n\nJohn Muir's Maternal Grandparents\n\nDavid Gilrye (shortened from Gilderoy)- came to Dunbar from Northumberland, England\n\nMargaret Hay Gilrye - of Coldstream\n\nJohn Muir's Parents\n\nDaniel Muir, father (1804-October 6, 1885) b. Manchester, England. m. Ann Gilrye 1833 in Dunbar, Scotland. d. 1885 Kansas City, Missouri, U.S.A.. Daniel Muir had a sister, Mary, born in 1793, who married Hamilton Blakely (or Blackley). It appears Mary and Hamilton also emigrated from Scotland to the U.S., and settled near Portage close to her brother Daniel Muir, and had at least one son named Daniel Muir Blackley who was John Muir's first cousin.\n\nSee also:\n\nDaniel Muir Gravesite\n\nDaniel Muir Obituary by John Muir.\n\nAnn Gilrye, mother (March 17, 1813 - June 22, 1896) Ann Gilrye Muir had only one sister Margaret, who survived childhood from among her 9 siblings, and who was married to Captain John Rae.

Robert Hanna founded a clothing company, Range of Light, based on the principles of John Muir. See Range of Light on YouTube. See interviews in Legacy of Muir Lives on in Great-Great Grandson (Sacramento Bee, June 5, 2015), Muir relative encourages local effort to save Alhambra Hills (Martinez Gazette, April 15, 2014); A fresh heir in the Muir wilderness, (Los Angeles Times, January 10, 2012); Hetch Hetchy - Parkleaders.com (December 23, 2014); The Life and Legacy of John Muir, (Radio Interview of Robert Hanna by Capital Public Radio, February 24, 2016). Hanna is also the driving force behind a resolution, introduced Thursday, April 21, 2016 in the California state legislature, that would rename as Buffalo Soldier Memorial Highway a stretch of road at the south entrance of Yosemite National Park. As the precursors to national park rangers and backcountry rangers, and as attendants during the ground-breaking meetings between President Theodore Roosevelt and John Muir in Yosemite Valley, the Buffalo Soldiers helped set the stage, it can be argued, for the establishment of a system of U.S. national parks. Hanna's appreciation of their story is just one of his efforts to provide a bridge between national parks and communities of color. Together with the great-great grandson of Theodore Roosevelt, Robert Hanna has written prominently in defense of our national parklands, see, e.g.. Despoiling Our National Parks Betrays our Democracy (Newsweek, December 19, 2017). He recently led a successful effort to designate part of California highway 120 in Yosemite as the Chiuru Obata Great Nature Memorial Highway. (Rafu Shimpo, Los Angeles Japanese Daily News (9/16/21).

Michael has lived with multiple sclerosis since he was 15 years old. Refusing to be daunted by the relentless course of his disease, Muir believes in challenging the limits of disability. Muir credits his active life working horses and in nature with keeping him strong. He founded and is the Director of \"Access Adventure: Challenging the Limits of Disability\"\n\nwww.access-adventure.org which has as its goal: to provide wilderness and open space access for people with disabilities using innovative, accessible horse-drawn carriages. In 2003, Michael re-traced John Muir's 1,000 mile walk to the gulf via horse-drawn carriage, to demonstrate that wilderness journeys are accessible to those with disabilities.\n\nHelen Lillian MUIR (1886 - 1964) b.

Although some sources state that he later changed name to Wayne Muir, his son Michael Funk states that his father never changed his name (Personal Communication, February 9, 2005).

In 2000, Walter told an interviewer that he had every book written by his famous grandfather and many written about him by other authors. He told the interviewer, \"The more I study him and the things he did, the more amazed I am. He had the most incredible way of describing things, in words I wouldn't even think of.\"\n\nEarl GUY (b.
