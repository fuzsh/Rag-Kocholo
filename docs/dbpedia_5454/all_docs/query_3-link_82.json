        "text": "About Dr. David Park\n\nDr. Park found his calling into healthcare by following his passion for helping people. While in dental school, he knew oral and maxillofacial surgery was the career path he was meant to be on and finds that treating patients is deeply rewarding. He feels honored to serve his local community and make a difference in his patients’ lives.\n\nDr. Park’s patient-forward philosophy allows his patients to feel welcome and comfortable at California Oral Surgery & Dental Implant Center. Instead of simply treating a patient’s condition, he takes the time to get to know them as a person. He is always happy to answer any questions and address concerns and receives the greatest joy when his patients can smile from the results of their oral surgery experience.\n\nEducation\n\nDr. Park graduated from La Sierra University with a degree in Biochemistry in 2000 before attending dental school at Loma Linda University.\n\nResidency\n\nDr. Park completed his residency at Loma Linda University and, as the first person to graduate with DDS and MD there, was a pioneer for their program.\n\nPersonal Life and Interests\n\nWhen he is not treating patients, Dr. Park loves to indulge his sense of adventure by enjoying the great outdoors. His hobbies include snowboarding, skiing and scuba diving, and has even tried flying. A sports fan, he can also be found cheering on his favorite team, the Lakers."
