        "text": "Investigating & Confirming the Authenticity & Attributions of Works of Art believed to be by:\n\nDavid Park\n\nAmerican\n\n(1911 â 1960)\n\nBay Area Figurative Movement - Abstract Expressionism\n\nÂ\n\nÂ David Park paintings fetch exceptional values today at auction and some, as will be seen from the examples set out below, considerably outstrip their auction estimates, rising into the millions of dollars.\n\nÂ But with all successful artists whose works achieve such high monetary values, this is open to both historically incorrect attributions honestly made and also to abuse. This occurs by deliberately misascribing a work to an artists hand, primarily as a device to deceive potential buyers. But there is also a more straightforward form of deception that we often encounter in investigating the authenticity of a work of art and this is something that is all too common and an enterprise that has been carried out for centuries.\n\nThis simplest of frauds is undertaken by the addition of a forged signature or monogram to an otherwise similar work of age, usually of a similar type, form or subject, but actually created by an anonymous follower of the artist it claims to be by.\n\nÂ\n\nÂ It is very important to understand the terminology used in describing a work of art for sale at auction, as this drastically alters the possible sale value result. Equally, in terms of the possibility of confirming the legitimacy of a work of art, or underpinning an attribution,Â either to the artist, or someone just painting like him, is a formal task we can certainly assist you with and advise upon.\n\nÂ\n\nÂ As a specialist fine art consultancy conducting art authenticity and attribution investigations internationally, we have been confidentially serving both private individuals and corporate clients from all over the world for well over 45 years, from our bases in Europe, the UK and north America.\n\nIn so doing, we have investigated the authenticity of both single works of art and complete collections for clients. Conducted in-depth authentication and legitimacy investigations and directed full academic and forensic applications. Researching the origins of works of art, from different geographical regions, genres and from all eras. We also scrutinize and conduct research necessary to verify the provenance and ownership lineage as a matter of due diligence.\n\nÂ\n\nÂ We are able to assist and advise you in all fine art related matters, particularly issues relating to the investigation of the legitimacy and attributions of American fine art, including the works of David Park, his direct circle and any other work of art that you need assistance or advice with.\n\nSome examples associated with his name appear below simply as comparative illustrations.\n\n*No inference is made, nor is it intended as to the question of their legitimacy here. Moreover they are an across the board, representational view of the differing types of works of art that have, are, or may in the future be offered and advertised for sale at auction internationally in the public domain that you may need specialist advise\n\nThe duration and the direction of any authenticity investigation or inquiry into an attribution of a work of art, will inevitably vary from project to project. But there are clear and very well defined expert professional formalities, responsibilities and areas of scrutiny that we can formally assist you with. These include:\n\nAuthentication: Authentification: Conducting comprehensive investigations and in depth research into a work of art, with a view to establishing a correct, complete and formally recognized certification. One absolutely upheld by the appropriate, legally acknowledged and internationally sanctioned authority, body or given expert on that artist. Directing detailed and complicated inquiries, with multilingual capability, including any international academic research and forensic applications that are required.\n\nAttribution: Identifying and confirming the identity of a previously anonymous artist, studio or workshop from which a work of art most likely originated. Including the re-examination and investigation of a previous attribution which may be incorrect, or the scrutiny of an attribution that has been formally questioned or is currently formally doubted.\n\nConfirmation: Undertaking research and investigations into the legitimacy of the provenance, history and prior ownership of a work of art and establishing its accuracy and own legitimacy.\n\nScrutiny: Examen minutieux: Identifying fake or faux works of art and forgeries, including any false supportive accompanying documentation and determining works of art which may be studio or later copies, or previously given, incorrect attributions.\n\nProsecution: Poursuite: Investigating alleged art fraud and forgery and assisting and advising those who are currently, or may be considering litigating or prosecuting the fact. This includes colleagues who are legal professionals and individual private clients.\n\nAttention: Conducting all fine art related due diligence and duty of care inquiries. Including safe prepurchase or sale related audits and assisting clients in consolidating well balanced future family distribution.\n\nAppraisal: Évaluation - Valuations and condition reports.\n\nStep one in the Art Authentication and Attribution process.\n\nThe Pre-Authentication Assessment\n\nWe strongly advise clients before embarking on a full investigation of legitimacy or an artist or studio attribution inquiry, that it is always wise to engage us to undertake an impartial preliminary assessment conducted first. One made to balance any issues that may be present that could make the longer term exercise unviable.\n\nThis is a professional advisory service that we provide, based upon the images you supply, the full details of work of arts acquisition, its history and provenance as is known to you, along with sight of any documentation, previous research or analysis that you may have had formerly conducted on it. You should then have a far better understanding of both the prospects or any pitfalls we might face, before making a decision.\n\nThis is a logical and cost effective professional review and advisory for which there is a modest set fee.\n\nOur FAQ section covers this in more detail.\n\nFAQs\n\nCONTACT US\n\nCONTACTEZ NOUS\n\nWe will respond to you promptly.\n\n* ABOUT A WORK OF ARTS DESCRIPTOR AND ITS TERMINOLOGY *\n\nAs if in this case as if they were defining the works of the artist;\n\nDavid Park (1911-1960) American\n\n*It is very important to clearly understand the general auction terms that are widely used in a published descriptor and to be cautious of works that may just be created in the 'manner of' the artist, or those which could be variants of the artists works of art that 'bear an applied signature' or monogram.\n\nÂ Where the name, David Park (1911-1960) is given with the first name/s and surname of the artist, usually cited as, David Park . including the dates to be specific, then in their qualified and professional opinion, they are in no doubt, it is a genuine and authentic item and one painted by that specific artist. This is usually fully qualified by its inclusion in any catalogue raissone, or by the guarantee of the opinion given by appropriate and internationally recognized expert authority on that artist.\n\nÂ When David Park (1911-1960) is the term used, or it is similarly defined as Attrib. to ' [abbreviated,] or Attribue, or ascribed to, then in their opinion it is 'probably' a work by the artist, at least in part. But... there is no guarantee. It is only an opinion that it 'possibly' may be by the artist.\n\nÂ But if the term David Park (1911-1960) - circle of, entourage, or âCircle of â David Park . is specifically used, then in their opinion, it is a work only of the period of the artist, but showing their influence. Or by someone closely associated with the artist, BUT not necessarily by their pupil or student.\n\nÂ When the name is given thus; Painted in the âStyle of or âFollower of David Park (1911-1960) is used, this means that in their opinion it is a work of art executed only in the artistâs way, in their 'style', but not necessarily by a pupil. Yet it may be a contemporary, or nearly a contemporary of the artist.\n\nÂ If the phrase in the âManner of David Park is used or is definedâ¦.â then in their opinion it is also only a work painted in the style of the artist, but of a later date and definitely not by the artist as named.\n\nÂ When the term âAfterâ¦. David Park \"; is the term used, then in their opinion it is a copy (made at any date) of an authentic and original work by the artist. This also applies to prints made 'after' an original work of art either by the artist or another artist/ printmaker.\n\nÂ Signed - David Park ; âDatedâ¦.â or âInscribed â Then in their opinion the work has been signed/dated/or inscribed by that specific artist. The addition of a question mark ? however, indicates a strong element of doubt.\n\nÂ When the term 'Bears signature', is used or the name, David Park is specified followed by the words; \"With signature â¦.â, or âWith date â¦.â or âWith ......inscriptionâ¦.â or âBears signature of David Park . / date / or inscriptionâ Then in 'their opinion,' either the signature / date / or inscription is spurious, forged or has been added by someone else other than the artist.\n\nÂ\n\nÂ\n\nWe can assist and advise you in all fine art related matters."
