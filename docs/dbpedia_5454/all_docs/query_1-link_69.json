        "text": "I don‚Äôt think your husband not liking it means there‚Äôs hate for the name! I like it. Works v well with Jonathan.\n\nHow about Alexander or Benjamin?\n\nDavid is a family name for us, two family members are David, another one a version of this and my DS middle name is also David. It‚Äôs a good name!\n\nBut like anything won‚Äôt suit everyone\n\nIs it because of the Royale Family? They used to say, Baby David in such a wet way!\n\nWhen I hear David I picture a middle aged man not a baby. I know it's strange it's just like Gary, I can't picture a baby named Gary either.\n\nJonathan is a beautiful name so im sure you'll find something lovely to go with it.\n\nDavid was the most common name at our wedding and is the most common name at my company. It‚Äôs a really good name! Just it‚Äôs also an incredibly common name and most people know more than one - so your David would be ‚ÄúBaby David‚Äù or ‚ÄúDavid Surname‚Äù or whatever to everyone.\n\nIt's not like Gary at all, David is a classic just not fashionable at the moment.\n\nWeren't David and Jonathan intensly close friends in the Bible?\n\nDb is David, it's my mum's favourite name of all time. She says she knew from a little girl she would have a David. I think it's great.\n\nWell, It might come back in 10 years. The fact that David and Linda are being discussed even as possibilities that most people shoot down, that alone means that these names will come back but not yet\n\nI like David but not Dave.\n\nI know two David‚Äôs that don‚Äôt like being called Dave (and tell everyone this when they introduce themselves) and yet people still insist on calling them it.\n\nI like it pronounced as Dah-vid, but I realise it would be a very hard work in the U.K. to stick to that.\n\nYes, sorry I should of said, both sides of the family are not keen on David either but I‚Äôve not been put off! I‚Äôve also just Googled Jonathan and David and found the biblical link which is fabulous (annoyingly üò´)\n\nThank you for your suggestions so far. Really like Alexander and Edward although conscious of Jonathan and Edward =Jedward ‚Ä¶\n\nThank you for your suggestions so far. Really like Alexander and Edward although conscious of Jonathan and Edward =Jedward ‚Ä¶\n\nOh, I wouldn't worry about that. They won't be a thing in a couple of years. And it's really not obvious."
