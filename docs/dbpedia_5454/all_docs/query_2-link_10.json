        "text": "Career\n\nHe was elected to the Senate in November 2008, prior to which he had served in the Nevada Assembly since 1996. Educated at the University of New Hampshire, Parks served in the United States Air Force between 1967 and 1971, and was stationed at Nellis Air Force Base in Las Vegas. A former assistant director of Clark County\"s Regional Transportation Commission, he was first appointed to the Paradise Town Advisory Board in 1991 and served three terms.\n\nHe was elected the board\"s chairman in 1992 and served in that role until his election to the State Assembly in November 1996.\n\nHe was re-elected comfortably in 1998 and 2000. Challenger Parks\" name was removed from the ballot when it became apparent that he was not a resident of Clark County, nor indeed of Nevada.\n\nHe was not a candidate for re-election to the Assembly in 2008 but instead ran for the Nevada Senate in the 7th district, seeking to succeed Dina Titus who mounted a successful bid for Congress. Three Democrats and three Republicans filed for the seat.\n\nIn the primary election held on August 12, 2008, he faced a well-funded opponent but prevailed easily, winning 71 percent of the vote in a three-way race.\n\nHe faced Republican Lindsay Nicole Madsen in the November general election, winning easily. He garnered 68% of the vote to her 32%. In 2010, he ran to succeed Rory Reid on the Clark County Commission, losing the Democratic primary election to Mary Beth Scow by just 91 votes.\n\nHe was appointed to the Governor's Statewide Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Advisory Task Force in 1987 (serving until 1994) and again in 2002 (still serving).\n\nElectoral history\n\nDavid Parks was elected in 1996 to serve in the Nevada State Assembly in Clark District 41."
