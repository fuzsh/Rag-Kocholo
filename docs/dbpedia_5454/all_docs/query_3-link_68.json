        "meta_description": "David Park, the college’s Webster Atwell-Class of 1921 Professor of Physics, emeritus, passed away Jan. 19 at the age of 92. In addition to teaching generations of students during his 40 years at Williams, he was the author of dozens of scientific papers as well as eight books, the last of which, The Grand Contraption, a history of cosmology, was published when he was 86 years old. In a message to the Williams community, President Adam Falk described Park as “a familiar and comfortable presence, whose sharp wit and warm heart enlivened every encounter, however brief.” Among Park’s survivors are four children, including Paul Park, Williams lecturer in English, and Jessica Park, a mail clerk at the college.
