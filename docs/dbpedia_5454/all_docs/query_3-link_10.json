        "text": "David M. Park is a former affiliate of Arturo Braga. After his capture, he became an informant for the Federal Bureau of Investigation.\n\nBiography\n\nCriminal Involvement\n\nAt some point, he joined the Braga Cartel, where he organized auction races to hired street racers to deliver shipments of heroin and other drugs internationally for Arturo Braga.\n\nFast & Furious\n\nDominic Toretto tracked down Park through a mutual acquaintance as he attempted to find the owner of a car running nitromethane that seemingly killed Letty Ortiz. He broke into Park's apartment and held him out of the window in an attempt to find the boss. Unbeknownst to Dom, Brian O'Conner was also tracking Park for the FBI and found him through his choice in car: a 2000 Nissan Silvia S15 Spec-R. Brian arrived at the apartment whilst Dom was there, and Dom lets Park go after being given information about Arturo Braga and Fenix Calderon. Brian then took Park in for questioning and was able to get Brian a spot in the race to join Braga's cartel as a driver.\n\nCharacteristics\n\nPersonality\n\nPark upholds a tough attitude to those who cross paths with but in reality is easily scared, as seen when Dom holds him out of a window and threatens to drop him to the ground.\n\nRelationships\n\nAllies\n\nArturo Braga\n\nFenix Calderon â€ \n\nEnemies\n\nDominic Toretto\n\nBrian O'Conner\n\nFederal Bureau of Investigation\n\nPenning\n\nSophie Trinh\n\nMichael Stasiak\n\nTrivia\n\nRon Yuan's screaming when he is being held out of the window is genuine as he is afraid of heights.\n\nVehicles Driven"
