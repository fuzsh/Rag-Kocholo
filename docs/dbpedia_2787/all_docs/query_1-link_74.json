        "text": "This paper explores the possibilities of examining four of Jim Jarmusch’s films (Stranger than Paradise, Down by Law, Dead Man and Ghost Dog) from the perspectives of various postmodern philosophies. It places Jarmusch’s opus within the larger frame of modern and postmodern cinema employing the theory of Jean-François Lyotard. Philosophies of Nietzsche, Baudrillard, Foucault and Heidegger are used to analyze several aspects of these films. However, the main focus is on a psychoanalytic approach relying on theories of Jacques Lacan and Slavoj Žižek. Thus, Stranger than Paradise is explained through the concepts of big Other and the repressed Other. Down by Law is seen as a quest for the Other which is “deprived of its Otherness”. Dead Man is a Heideggerian Exploration of the Being whose Beckettian character resonates with neurotic anxiety and childhood trauma. The ancient mythology in Ghost Dog concludes the discussion of the Other with mechanisms of condensation and projection, and with an attempt to find a religious solution to postmodern skepticism and relativism.\n\nFreak Scenes explores the increased licensing of indie music and representation of indie music cultures within American independent cinema since the 1980s. Indie music has, since the 2000s, become highlighted in some indie films as an attraction, but this book probes how the appeal of indie music stretches back to the late 1970s, when punk music made its impact on filmmaking. Sexton looks at a range of issues where indie music and indie film intersect, including commercial concerns, the growth of niche marketing, the increased employment of popular music in cinema and questions of authenticity, as well as the fraught tensions between commercial and artistic concerns. Case studies include: sonic authorship and indie music, representations of punk and indie scenes on screen, and an exploration of how racial and gender issues inform the representation and reception of indie cultures on film. Included are table of contents and proofs of the introduction.\n\nJim Jarmusch´s objective has been clear from the start of his filmmaking career. He has never had any desire to be a part of mainstream cinema or make films for any specific kind of audience. Concerned primarily with intimacy, character exploration, urban settings and cultural clashes, his narrative has always unfolded itself in an unpredictable manner. In interviews he has stated how he sees the United States through the eyes of a foreigner, and that his ambition is to create a new kind of cinematic narrative moulded by his three major influences: the world cinema of Europe, Japan and Hollywood. This vision is very contrasting, a reflection of Jarmusch himself. Always working on the margins of the film industry, the filmmaker has still managed to maintain a steady production of niche films of great value, independence, minimalism, and wry humour. His bold and dominant style continues making significant contributions to independent cinema. This research paper’s aim is to unfold the cinematographic work of film director, producer and author, Jim Jarmusch, in an attempt to understand narrative films from a different perspective. Even though Jarmusch has been the object of much popularity and visibility among the independent film niche, little academic research has been carried out by scholars regarding his philosophy, narrative, thematic and stylistic preferences. Most assessment of his work has been done by film critics and a few scholarly articles have been published, although mostly in languages other than English (German and Italian). Jarmusch´s figure is worthy of approaching from an academic standpoint, not only as an independent author director-producer who has successfully fought to stay on the margin of the mainstream film industry, but also as an attempt to analyse his narrative as a new form of storytelling in the contemporary cinematographic world. The filmmaker’s unique role as director and author makes a compelling case to study. His active role in writing and directing all of his feature films, as well as working closely alongside cinematographers and editors while carefully selecting and casting his characters, choosing the main locations, and raising the funds for his film projects, convert Jarmusch into a virtually unique contemporary filmmaker and comprise an added value to his already recognized authorial credentials. Keywords: Jim Jarmusch, independent films, narrative, postmodernism\n\nThis paper explores the implications of urban gentrification in the 1990s and 2000s on the development of the American indie cinema. I argue that these implications have been far ranging, such that we are able to speak of a ‘cinema of gentrification’ during this time period. Using Michel Gondry's Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (2004) and Marc Webb's (500) Days of Summer (2009) as representative examples, I show how the films of this cinema developed a vexed relationship with the city and with urban life. In particular, I contend, we can productively read Wes Anderson's The Royal Tenenbaums (2001) through the prism of gentrification. Following from Michel de Certeau, Neil Smith and others, I argue that Anderson's representation of the city in Tenenbaums marks a break within the history of city cinema, as it denies the social and cultural logics of urban identity by instead reducing city space to mere location."
