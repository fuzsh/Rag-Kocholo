        "text": "Many view the Western as a genre of the past. Which is both warranted and, frankly, altogether untrue. Of course Westerns had much more appeal in the early 20th century, both from an entertainment perspective (the action and adventure, the genre’s mythical quality) and as a reflection of the United States’ changing societal landscape (expansion and settlement in the Old West, post-war optimism). Naturally, changing tastes and cultural shifts led to a decline in interest in the genre—but not outright exclusion. In recent years, we’ve seen important Westerns from the likes of Quentin Tarantino (Django Unchained, The Hateful Eight) and Martin Scorsese (Killers of the Flower Moon) dominate the zeitgeist. Of all the United States’ contributions to the art form, Westerns have had the largest impact on world cinema, influencing filmmakers from Akira Kurosawa to Sergio Leone, from Lucio Fulci to Wong Kar-wai.\n\nThe Western is such a staple of American cinema that it seems a monumental, perhaps impossible task to identify the “best” contributions to the genre. Nevertheless, that’s just what this list aims to do. Not only will it discuss the most important pieces of the Western genre’s history, but I will personally be ranking the 25 best Westerns I’ve ever seen. Next to film noir, the Western is my favorite genre. Side by side, I find both styles of cinema to be fascinating reflections of the United States’ changing cultural 20th century tides. The mythic qualities of the best Westerns feel transcendent — and when you watch a great Western, it’s unlike anything else you’ll experience in cinema. So I will do my best to honor this timeless genre as I rank what I believe to be the best Westerns of all time.\n\nTypes Of Western Movies\n\nBefore we get to the best of the best, we need to identify what even makes a Western a Western—a basic definition of the genre, as well as all the subgenres that have stemmed from it.\n\nWhat Is A Western?\n\nWesterns are primarily defined through their setting and themes, but there’s an added stylistic flair that provides a fabled feel. Typically, Westerns are set in the American frontier during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Key elements of the genre’s settings and characters include rugged landscapes, frontier towns, cowboys, Native Americans, lawmen and outlaws. The themes often revolve around the struggle between civilization and wilderness, an unquenchable thirst for justice and revenge, the tension between individualism and community. These are all staples of normal stories, but there’s a natural mythical quality to the genre that gives these age-old storytelling aspects a refreshing, wistful, sometimes haunting feel. The Western genre encapsulates the spirit of the American frontier, characterized by its stark moral landscapes and a sense of untamed adventure that parallels the philosophical quandaries these characters navigate.\n\nWestern Subgenres\n\nWestern films are diverse, encompassing several subgenres that highlight different aspects of the frontier experience. Here’s a brief overview of all the most prevalent subgenres:\n\nClassic Westerns are very traditional with explicit, overtly defined protagonists and antagonists, precise moral dichotomies and straightforward, tidy narratives. Iconic examples include John Ford’s Stagecoach (1939), Fred Zinnerman’s High Noon (1952) and Budd Boetticher’s “Ranown Western” series (The Tall T (1957), Ride Lonesome (1959), Comanche Station (1960)). Classic Westerns emphasize themes of law and order, often featuring sheriffs, bounty hunters and gunslingers facing off in dusty towns. These stories typically take place in one of two distinct settings: within a small township divided by politics and class, or out on the open terrain where it’s every man for himself.\n\nSpaghetti Westerns originated in Italy and offered a grittier, more stylized take on the genre. Directors like Sergio Leone redefined Westerns with his irreverent films, especially with his Dollars Trilogy: A Fistful of Dollars (1964), A Few Dollars More (1965) and The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (1966), as did Sergio Corbucci with movies like Django (1966) and The Great Silence (1968). These movies less concerned with the traditional stoic camerawork and straightforward storytelling that consumes Classic Westerns, actively embracing morally ambiguous characters, intricate plots and dramatic cinematography. Their movies are often accompanied by iconic scores (from composers like Ennio Morricone).\n\nNeo-Westerns, a.k.a. Post-Westerns or Urban Westerns, bring the themes and aesthetics of traditional Westerns into contemporary settings with modernized narratives. Technically, Neo-Westerns have existed for decades, as successive generations of filmmakers have brought the traditional Western into their respecitve modern eras. On the other side of the tropes that dominated Classic Westerns, these Post-Westerns explore the lasting impact of the frontier ethos, often featuring complex characters that reflect modern moral dilemmas. Examples include Joel and Ethan Coen’s No Country for Old Men (2007), Denis Villeneuve’s Sicario (2015) and David Mackenzie’s Hell or High Water (2016), where the landscapes and struggles reflect how the challenges and conflicts of the old West continue to resonate today.\n\nAcid Westerns prefer to color outside the lines stylistically, blending the traditional, metaphorical elements of Classic Westerns that served as commentaries on culture with surreal, psychedelic twists. This approach allows Acid Westerns to delve into the sorts of existential and philosophical themes that dominate Classic Westerns in decidedly avant-garde form, creating a dreamlike or hallucinatory atmosphere. Alejandro Jodorowsky's El Topo, Alex Cox’s Walker and Jim Jarmusch's Dead Man are quintessential Acid Westerns, offering unconventional narratives that completely subvert genre expectations.\n\nMeat Pie Westerns are the Australian equivalent of the Classic Western that originated in the United States, transposing the themes and aesthetics of the genre to the Outback. Ned Kelly (1970), Mad Max (1979) and The Proposition (2005) are notable examples, featuring stark, unforgiving landscapes and narratives centered around survival and lawlessness. These films often explore themes of colonialism, identity and the harshness of the Australian frontier.\n\nThe Greatest Western Movies\n\nNow that we’ve gotten a better understanding of the genre and all of its tangential elements, it’s time to rank the best Westerns ever. Before we get to that list, let’s reflect on the most successful Westerns of all time, as well as the filmmakers and actors who most defined the genre.\n\nTechnically, the highest-grossing Western of all time is Quentin Tarantino’s Django Unchained, which pulled in $449.8 million back in 2012. Just behind is Kevin Costner’s Dances With Wolves, which made $424.2 million in 1990 (when adjusting for inflation, the film’s domestic gross jumps from $184.2 million to $399.7 million, which, at the time of this article’s publishing, is the 155th best performance ever). The next top performers were released in the 2010s decade: The Lone Ranger ($260 million), the True Grit remake ($252.2 million) and Rango ($245.7 million).\n\nThere are certain actors that became the most famous faces of the genre over the years, including John Wayne (who appeared in many other Westerns not featured on this list, such as Stagecoach and Red River), Clint Eastwood (The Outlaw Josey Wales, High Planes Drifters), Randolph Scott (7 Men from Now, The Walking Hills), James Stewart (Destry Rides Again, How the West Was Won) and Gary Cooper (Vera Cruz, The Westerner).\n\nThe filmmakers that most defined the genre were John Ford (who directed many Westerns not featured on this list, like My Darling Clementine and Fort Apache), Delmer Daves (3:10 to Yuma, Broken Arrow), Anthony Mann (Bend of the River, The Far Country) and Budd Boetticher (Buchanan Rides Alone, Decision at Sundown).\n\nAnd now it’s time for my list — the Westerns I believe stand above the rest. Along with some honorable mentions, you’ll find 50 different movies that I personally consider to be the “best.” Please keep in mind that this list is purely subjective, merely a reflection of my personal tastes. I prefer the Classic Western formula, so you’ll notice a lack of Spaghetti and Meat Pie Westerns (which is why we’ll give the best of those subgenres special mentions at the end of this article). This list also doesn’t mention several famous Westerns that would appear on many other lists, including classic movies like The Magnificent Seven and The Treasure of the Sierra Madre, or contemporary films like The Power of the Dog or Tombstone.\n\nNeedless to say, there’s a healthy library of Westerns available. So whether you’re a newbie to Westerns or an expert of the genre, hopefully this list can provide you with either some guidance or some reflection regarding a wonderful genre that’s largely been lost to time.\n\n25. The Last Sunset (1961)\n\nRobert Aldrich loved to jump between genres, with Westerns being one of his favorite, resulting in beloved films like Vera Cruz and Ulzana’s Raid. But, in my opinion, his best contribution to the genre was The Last Sunset. The fugitive gunslinger Brendan O'Malley joins a cattle drive to evade capture in this underrated flick, only to find himself entangled in a love triangle and a web of loyalty and betrayal (in many ways similar to the famous Western Jubal). The film features standout performances from greats like Kirk Douglas, Rock Hudson and Dorothy Malone — all veterans of the genre who knew how to navigate the Western formula and play their parts perfectly. Aldrich, who directed about half a dozen westerns in total, brought his signature flair for narrative subversion to The Last Sunset, giving the film the kind of psychological depth expected of his characters and palpable emotional layers from which his actors happily fed. The movie’s exploration of personal redemption and tragic destiny, coupled with unnerving atmospheric tension, sets the film apart from more traditional Westerns.\n\nHere’s where you can stream The Last Sunset.\n\n24. Gunman’s Walk (1958)\n\nA story focused on the generational conflict and the destructive nature of pride and arrogance, Gunman’s Walk centers on a powerful rancher and his two sons. Genre star Van Heflin (who starred in several famous Westerns, like Shane and 3:10 to Yuma) delivers a commanding performance as the domineering father, while Tab Hunter goes toe-to-toe with him as his rebellious son. Directed by Phil Karlson, who also tackled Westerns like A Time for Killing and Thunderhoof, Gunman’s Walk is praised for its disciplined, assured handling of familial strife that reflects the generational divide of the time, and the rancid moral decay that hung over it. Its nuanced portrayal of toxic masculinity and the breakdown of traditional family values provides a compelling and thought-provoking story that, by today’s Neo-Western standards, has strongly stood the test of time. The film is filled with tension that, no matter how quiet, leaves you completely unsettled — especially during the story’s memorable closing moments.\n\nHere’s where you can stream Gunman’s Walk.\n\n23. Will Penny (1967)\n\nThe “aging cowboy” is a common trope of the Western genre that you’ll find throughout this list. It’s a perfect structure for a genre that aims to examine a country that’s constantly progressing and evolving from its past. In Will Penny, our aging cowboy is the titular Will Penny, who finds solace in a remote cabin with a widow and her young son after being injured and left for dead. Charlton Heston, who starred in many Westerns over the years, including Tombstone, The Big Country and Major Dundee, delivers an arresting performance as Will, supported by two greats, Joan Hackett and Donald Pleasence. Directed by Tom Gries, who directed the Westerns Breakheart Pass and 100 Rifles, the well-revered and highly influential Will Penny has always been lauded for its realistic portrayal of cowboy life and sensitive character development. The film's focus on the gritty realities of frontier living and the emotional struggles of its title character offers a refreshing and introspective take on the genre, paving the way for later revisionist Westerns.\n\nHere’s where you can stream Will Penny.\n\n22. No Country for Old Men (2007)\n\nIt’s no secret that the Coen brothers were enamored with the Western genre. From straightforward Westerns, like their True Grit remake and The Ballad of Buster Scruggs, to films that were clearly influenced by the genre, like Blood Simple and Fargo, it’s been fascinating to watch how the famed directors toyed with the Western formula. But most people would agree: their best Western came out in 2007. Possibly the greatest movie in a year filled with incredible films, No Country for Old Men tells the story of Llewelyn Moss, who stumbles upon a drug deal gone wrong and takes a suitcase of money, setting off a deadly chase with a relentless hitman and a weary sheriff. Starring Josh Brolin, Javier Bardem (who won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor) and Tommy Lee Jones, what many people consider to be the greatest Neo-Western ever made rightfully won Best Picture at the Academy Awards. Directed by the Joel and Ethan Coen, who each took home an Oscar for Best Director, No Country for Old Men stands as an important contribution to Neo-Westerns, lauded for its bleak portrayal of fate and morality, of greed and detachment, of generational trauma. The film's tension-filled atmosphere and philosophical undertones make it a standout in modern film.\n\nHere’s where you can stream No Country for Old Men.\n\n21. El Topo (1970)\n\nThe great Alejandro Jodorowsky, who directed experimental classics like The Holy Mountain and Santa Sangre, made his one and only contribution to the Western genre with El Topo. Flaunting the sort of philosophical architecture that permeated his films, this surreal, avant-garde Western follows a mysterious gunfighter on a quest for enlightenment. Directed by and starring Jodorowsky, the film blends the director’s signature mysticism and philosophy with countercultural themes that collectively challenges traditional Western conventions, resulting in a meta take on the Classic Western’s exploration of American ideals. Its striking visual style, combining psychedelic imagery with stark desert landscapes, and its unconventional narrative structure make El Topo a unique entry in the genre’s canon. The film's exploration of spiritual awakening and existential dilemmas has led to a cult following (one that I’m personally happy to be part of), solidifying its place as a groundbreaking work in both Western and avant-garde cinema.\n\nHere’s where you can stream El Topo.\n\n20. The Furies (1950)\n\nThis isn’t the only time Anthony Mann will appear on this list. In addition to directing two of our honorable mentions, Winchester ‘73 and The Naked Spur, Mann directed this ahead-of-its-time Western that explores a feminist plight for autonomy. The Furies centers on an intense power struggle between a strong-willed daughter and her domineering father over their sprawling ranch. The film features Barbara Stanwyck (perhaps the greatest actress who ever lived, who starred in nearly a dozen Westerns, including Forty Guns and Union Pacific), Wendell Corey (The Rainmaker, The Wild North) and Walter Huston (The Treasure of the Sierra Madre, Duel in the Sun), whose powerful performances do all the heavy lifting in this high-drama tale that teeters on the edge of melodrama. Long celebrated by film critics for its psychological depth and complex characters that candidly offer social commentary, The Furies stands out for its at-the-time bold narrative and the intense familial conflict.\n\nHere’s where you can stream The Furies.\n\n19. The Bravados (1958)\n\nThis is the first but certainly not the final appearance for Henry King on this list, a director who didn’t dabble in the Western genre too often but certainly made two movies that counted. And one of those flicks was the highly underrated The Bravados, which follows Jim Douglass, a man seeking revenge on the outlaws who murdered his wife. Starring Gregory Peck (one of the genre’s most prolific stars, starring in gems like Yellow Sky and The Yearling), the film is noted for being one of the darkest, most psychologically challenging Westerns of its time. Peck's portrayal of Douglass carries a special sort of depth thanks to his stoic, iconic presence, making his journey of vengeance and redemption feel overwhelmingly heavy and penetrating. The film’s atmospheric tension and striking shot selection from all-time great cinematographer Leon Shamroy makes the world of The Bravados feel mystical and dreamlike, resulting in a thought-provoking story that directly challenges what’s expected of a Western.\n\nHere’s where you can stream The Bravados.\n\n18. The Searchers (1956)\n\nWe’ve finally reached the one, the only John Ford — inarguably the greatest contributor to the Western canon. And while The Searchers is his only film to appear on my Top 25, several of its other films (such as classics like The Man Who Shot Liberty Vance, Stagecoach and My Darling Clementine) cannot be denied as staples of the genre. My personal favorite of his filmography, The Searchers, is a landmark Western that follows Ethan Edwards, a Civil War veteran on a relentless quest to find his kidnapped niece. Starring the actor who also happens to be the face of the entire Western genre, John Wayne (Rio Bravo, Red River), as well as Jeffrey Hunter and Vera Miles, the film is celebrated for its sweeping cinematography of the West, its compelling, interweaving characters and its exploration of the storied racial tensions in America. Wayne's portrayal of Edwards is both iconic and nuanced, revealing a deeply absorbing character driven by obsession, haunted by his past. The film's rich visuals and its examination of revenge and redemption have made it a defining work of art.\n\nHere’s where you can stream The Searchers.\n\n17. Dead Man (1995)\n\nIt’s funny to think that Johnny Depp starred in two of the highest grossing Westerns of all time, Rango and The Lone Ranger — two decidedly mainstream films that seem the antithesis to Depp’s one and only remaining contribution to the genre, a black-and-white Acid Western that slowly navigates through a muddy philosophical haze and sulks through the tedium of the everyday. Dead Man is a modern Western that tells the story of William Blake, an accountant who becomes a fugitive after a deadly confrontation. Directed by Jim Jarmusch, who never directed another Western but is known for movies that center on similarly meandering souls like Stranger Than Paradise and Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai, and starring Gary Farmer and Crispin Glover, Dead Man is praised for Jarmusch’s trademark poetic narrative and director of photography Robby Müller’s striking cinematography, as well as its unique blend of mysticism and existential themes. The film stands out for its unconventional approach and artistic vision, with Jarmusch's minimalist style and Neil Young's haunting score creating an evocative mood and feel.\n\nHere’s where you can stream Dead Man.\n\n16. Bad Day at Black Rock (1955)\n\nJohn Sturges had a fine career directing tough-and-gritty action films like The Great Escape and The Eagle Has Landed, but his most significant contributions came in the Western genre. And arguably his greatest Western was Bad Day at Black Rock, which centers on a mysterious stranger who arrives in a small desert town and uncovers a dark secret. Directed by Sturges, whose most significant additions to the Western canon included The Magnificent Seven, Gunfight at the O.K. Corral and Joe Kidd, and featuring historically treasured actors like Spencer Tracy, Robert Ryan and Walter Brennan, Bad Day at Black Rock is acclaimed for its tautly suspenseful, tightly contained narrative, with several strong performances driving its psychological contemplations. Tracy's portrayal of the determined outsider brings a quiet intensity to the film, while Sturges' direction effortlessly blends elements of film noir and Western.\n\nHere’s where you can stream Bad Day at Black Rock.\n\n15. Jubal (1956)\n\nDelmer Daves built quite the legacy in Hollywood, thriving specifically in the film noir genre with cinematic treasures like Dark Passage and The Red House. But he is best known for his work in the Western arena, and many would argue that Jubal was his best turn. This melodramatic story reimagines Shakespeare's Othello in the rugged landscape of the American West, where the rise of a ranch hand triggers jealousy and betrayal. Featuring the unassailable lead Glenn Ford (who enjoyed a rich career in Westerns, including 3:10 to Yuma, Cowboy and The Violent Men), as well as great character performances from Ernest Borgnine (The Wild Bunch, Johnny Guitar) and Rod Steiger (Duck, You Sucker, Oklahoma!), Jubal thrives on its rich and chaotic character development and intense melodramatic tension throughout. The interplay between honor, jealousy and redemption weaves a narrative that elevates the film above its genre peers despite its small, contained story.\n\nHere’s where you can stream Jubal.\n\n14. Giant (1956)\n\nTypically, your average Western tells a small, tightly controlled story. There are one or two main settings, and a small cast of characters you spend just a few days with. That’s what sets apart Giant, an epic saga that charts the tumultuous journey of a Texas ranching family over several decades, dissecting themes of wealth, power and racial tensions that play out much differently from your average Western in such a decidedly sweeping format. Directed by George Stevens (who directed the famous Western Shane as well as other classics like A Place in the Sun and Swing Time) and starring Elizabeth Taylor, Rock Hudson (the star of many Westerns, including Bend of the River and The Last Sunset) and James Dean, Giant is a grand tapestry of American life, unmatched by any other Western when observing its ambitious scale, its award-worthy performances and its timeless social commentary. Clocking in at 3 hours and 21 minutes, Giant requires your full commitment — and yes, in the end, it is worth it.\n\nHere’s where you can stream Giant.\n\n13. Comanche Station (1960)\n\nOf all the Westerns that populated Hollywood during the genre’s heyday in the 1950s and 1960s, none (in my opinion) stand above those crafted by director Budd Boetticher. Several of these films he put together are part of what’s known as the Ranown Cycle, named after actor Randolph Scott (who starred in the films from this series) producer Harry Joe Brown’s production company. For these movies, Boetticher worked with screenwriters Burt Kennedy and Charles Lang to make classics like Buchanan Rides Alone, The Tall T, Decision at Sundown — and, of course, Comanche Station. In this deeply philosophical tale, a lone cowboy's mission to rescue a woman from Comanche captors becomes a treacherous, seemingly unwinnable journey of survival and honor. Starring Scott, who starred in several Westerns outside the Ranown Cycle (like Ride the High Country and Western Union), as well as Nancy Gates and Claude Akins, Comanche Station is a masterclass in minimalist storytelling, characterized by keeping the narrative tight yet penetrating, cinematographer Charles Lawton Jr.’s haunting compositions and a strong emphasis on characters that hauntingly reflect the human experience.\n\nHere’s where you can stream Comanche Station.\n\n12. The Hateful Eight (2015)\n\nCall me crazy, but I’ve never been a gigantic fan of Django Unchained. Don’t get me wrong: it’s a quality film that features some top-notch acting. But when I think about all the best traits of true Westerns, a genre I love, I get much more excited about Quentin Tarntino’s other Western, The Hateful Eight — a film that, bizarrely, is considered one of the director’s lesser works. Obviously, I disagree. This homage to Classic Westerns that flaunts a biting modern brand of bloody fun brings together eight strangers in a post-Civil War Wyoming cabin during a blizzard, leading to much suspense and several violent confrontations. Featuring an ensemble cast that includes Samuel L. Jackson, Kurt Russell and Jennifer Jason Leigh, the film that gave legendary composer Ennio Morricone his only Oscar is a testament to Tarantino's flair for sharp dialogue and slow-burn tension. The confined setting forces the director to exercise his bold, flamboyant style in new and exciting ways, creating for an immersive experience that, in my opinion, hasn’t been matched by any other Western from the past 20 years.\n\nHere’s where you can stream The Hateful Eight.\n\n11. Dances With Wolves (1990)\n\nKevin Costner has made waves with his upcoming Horizon film series — an ambitious four-film project that explores the expanding American West both pre- and post-Civil War. Long before Horizon, however, Costner both starred in Westerns (from Silverado to Let Him Go) and directed them (Open Range). But by far his most famous Western, which he both directed and starred in, was the Best Picture winner Dances With Wolves. This landmark film tells the story of a Union Army lieutenant who forges a deep bond with a Lakota tribe, learning their ways and joining their struggle for survival. The film, for which Costner won Best Director at the Academy Awards, is celebrated for its beautiful shots of the American landscape and its honest, heartfelt narrative that never feels forced or out of touch. Its portrayal of Native American life and critique of Manifest Destiny offer a humanistic perspective that’s rare in not just modern Westerns, but Westerns period.\n\nHere’s where you can stream Dances With Wolves.\n\n10. The Gunfighter (1950)\n\nThere are usually two kinds of Westerns: ones that take place on the open plane, and ones where the protagonist rides into a town and must navigate its politics. For the latter category, there was perhaps no film more ahead of its time than The Gunfighter, which balances several different stories and character journeys at once over the course of a single, defining, wildly climactic day. This classic from Henry King, who already appeared on this list for The Bravados, delves into the life of an aging outlaw seeking redemption while being hunted by younger gunslingers eager for notoriety. Starring Gregory Peck (also a member of King’s The Bravados), The Gunfighter prospers from a top-notch script that chirps along like clockwork and a career-defining performance from its lead. The film’s sympathetic portrayal of a flawed man trying to fix his life combined with its exploration of the relentless passage of time provides a poignant, reflective take on the kinds of characters that typically populate the Western genre.\n\nHere’s where you can stream The Gunfighter.\n\n9. True Grit (1969)\n\nOf all the actors in Hollywood that could’ve pulled off a remake of True Grit, Jeff Bridges was the man. He brought a perfect mix of grizzled bravura and sensitive introspection to the legendary character Rooster Cogburn — a role originally defined by the Western’s biggest star, John Wayne. And as much as I like the remake, it doesn’t come close to touching the original. True Grit follows a young girl who enlists a grizzled U.S. Marshal to avenge her father’s murder. Directed by Henry Hathaway, who gave us Westerns like How the West Was Won, Nevada Smith and The Sons of Katie Elder, and starring Wayne (whose portrayal of Rooster Cogburn earned him an Academy Award) and Kim Darby, the film is celebrated for its immortal, engaging story and its lovable, unforgettable characters. Wayne’s tough yet endearing marshal brings humor and heart to the film, while the narrative’s blend of adventure, justice and personal growth solidifies True Grit’s place in the Western pantheon.\n\nHere’s where you can stream True Grit.\n\n8. Johnny Guitar (1954)\n\nNicholas Ray wasn’t exactly known for his Westerns, as he was more famous for his tales of young rebellion (Rebel Without a Cause, They Live By Night) and film noirs (In a Lonely Place, On Dangerous Ground). But he did make one renowned entry into the canon that not only took the typical Western narrative to new dramatic heights but also featured a rare strong female lead. Johnny Guitar is an audacious departure from the conventional Western, centered on Vienna, a resilient saloon owner in a desolate desert town, who confronts hostility from the local populace and the vindictive Emma Small. The arrival of gunslinger Johnny Guitar, Vienna's former lover, ignites the simmering tensions, leading to a violent showdown. Starring the illustrious Joan Crawford (more well known for her award-winning dramatic roles in films like Mildred Pierce) and Sterling Hayden (who starred in Westerns like Terror in a Texas Town and Valerie), Johnny Guitar is a testament to bold, unconventional storytelling that pushed the genre to reflect upon itself and expand its offerings.\n\nHere’s where you can stream Johnny Guitar.\n\n7. The Hanging Tree (1959)\n\nWe’ve already discussed Delmer Daves, who gave us classic Westerns like 3:10 to Yuma and Jubal, but we haven’t mentioned one of the genre’s most undoubted stars: Gary Cooper. And those two collaborated for one of the most underrated Westerns ever released. The Hanging Tree centers on a frontier doctor with a mysterious past who becomes involved in the lives of a mining community, especially a woman left for dead after a stagecoach robbery. Starring Cooper (who performed in Westerns like High Noon, Vera Cruz and The Westerner), Maria Schell and Karl Malden, the film is noted for its intense psychological probing into small-town politics as well as its revolving cast of complex characters. Cooper’s touching portrayal of the enigmatic doctor adds layers of intrigue and moral ambiguity, bringing a touch of sadness to a genre constantly trying to exhibit a macho presence. The final shot of The Hanging Tree is one that haunts me to this day — the perfect culmination of the film’s exploration of guilt and self-forgiveness.\n\nHere’s where you can stream The Hanging Tree.\n\n6. Walker (1987)\n\nThis entry is probably the most adventurous I get on this list, as Walker is neither a traditional take on Westerns nor considered to be one of the genre’s greats. But when it comes to Acid Westerns that push the boundaries of the genre, there’s simply nothing better in my opinion. Walker is a biographical Western depicting the exploits of William Walker, an American mercenary who briefly ruled Nicaragua in the mid-19th century. Directed by Alex Cox (who took on a couple other offbeat Westerns) and starring Ed Harris (who had never starred in a Western prior to this picture), the film blends historical events with contemporary political commentary through its satirical tone and anachronistic elements. Harris’s intense performance and Cox’s bold direction create a provocative and overtly stylistic experience that critiques American imperialism and adventurism. In the end, Walker’s dark humor and irreverent attitude offers a sharp critique, making it a distinctive addition to the Western oeuvre.\n\nHere’s where you can stream Walker.\n\n5. McCabe & Mrs. Miller (1971)\n\nIf I were alive in 1971, then I would have lost my mind when I learned that the unequalled director Robert Altman was filming a Western starring Warren Beatty and Julie Christie. The languid pacing, the overlapping dialogue, the satiric look at American values — these are all staples of Altman’s cinema, and they’re all prevalent in McCabe & Mrs. Miller. Possibly the most unique take on the Classic Western on this list, this 1971 film revisionist tale follows a gambler and a prostitute who join forces to run a brothel in a small mining town, only to face threats from larger corporate interests. The film has long been praised for Altman’s typical atmospheric cinematography and improvisational dialogue, as well as Leonard Cohen’s haunting musical contributions. The director’s deconstruction of Western tropes, combined with the film’s melancholic tone and rich characterizations, provides a gritty and realistic portrayal of frontier life.\n\nHere’s where you can stream McCabe & Mrs. Miller.\n\n4. Man of the West (1958)\n\nWhile The Furies was a less-than-conventional take on Westerns for Anthony Mann, the director made several definitive versions of the classic formula. But films like Winchester ‘73 and The Naked Spur separated themselves from the pack thanks to the director’s tremendous eye for finding poetry in the desolate Western landscape — and Man of the West is the best film he ever delivered. This classic tells the story of a reformed outlaw who must confront his violent past when stranded in a remote town with his former gang. Starring Gary Cooper, a genre superstar who also starred in Westerns like Distant Drums and Garden of Evil, Man of the West is noted for its psychological intensity and striking visuals. Cooper’s portrayal of Mann’s favorite subject, the tortured antihero, adds depth to the familiar Western narrative, while Mann’s masterful direction constantly emphasizes the moral complexities and harsh realities of frontier life. This film displays everything Westerns are capable of achieving.\n\nHere’s where you can stream Man of the West.\n\n3. Unforgiven (1992)\n\nIt is crazy that we’ve made it this far in the list without mentioning one of Clint Eastwood’s movies. But that’s all going to change with this entry... and the next one. First, we’ll start with the greatest movie Eastwood ever directed: Unforgiven. Released in 1992, this revisionist Western follows a retired gunslinger who takes on one last job to avenge an injustice, all the while grappling with his violent past and the moral consequences of his actions. Directed by and starring Eastwood (he won the Oscar for both Best Director and Best Picture that year), along with Gene Hackman, Morgan Freeman and Richard Harris, the film is acclaimed for its gritty realism, its engaging and troublesome characters and its deconstruction of Western mythology. Eastwood’s portrayal of the aging outlaw and Hackman’s Oscar-winning performance as the ruthless sheriff creates such a unique tension for the “aging cowboy” trope prevalent in many Westerns. Unforgiven had a profound impact on the genre, as it challenged traditional notions of heroism and justice that have long been a crucial component of Eastwood’s career. It remains a fascinating movie that only gets better with age.\n\nHere’s where you can stream Unforgiven.\n\n2. The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (1966)\n\nYes, Clint Eastwood is back, this time in what many consider to definitively to be the greatest Western of all time — and it’s hard to argue. The Good, the Bad and the Ugly represented everything that Spaghetti Westerns — a genre obsessed with close-ups of ambiguous anti-heroes, with slow-paced action sequences amidst bloody tales of revenge, with grim and cynical tones bleeding from the bleak and harsh landscapes — were capable of. This film from the Spaghetti Western’s biggest champion, Sergio Leone, follows three gunslingers competing to find a buried fortune hiding within the chaos of the American Civil War. Also starring Lee Van Cleef and Eli Wallach to fill out the three storied lead roles alongside Eastwood, the film is renowned for its epic scope, it’s iconic score by Ennio Morricone, and it’s innovative cinematography from the legendary Tonino Delli Colli. Leone’s incredible directorial turn cemented this film as a cornerstone of the Western genre.\n\nHere’s where you can stream The Good, the Bad and the Ugly.\n\n1. Ride Lonesome (1959)\n\nAs much as I love Westerns, I can’t help but feel I’m always chasing to find one that’s as good as Ride Lonesome. The depth of its characters’ struggles and the weight of their plights, the efficiency of its storytelling (the movie clocks in at a breezy 73 minutes), the effortless and impossibly beautiful navigation of the bare, bleak, undeniably towering American West — it’s astonishing to witness such a simple tale extract such profound beauty and insight about what it means to be human. Ride Lonesome tells the story of a bounty hunter who captures an outlaw, only to be pursued by the outlaw’s gang and haunted by his own past. Directed by Budd Boetticher (in my opinion, the greatest Western director) and starring Randolph Scott (the greatest star of Westerns), Ride Lonesome is the ultimate Western because of how delicately and profoundly it explores thematic tropes of the genre — how we find meaning and catharsis in an ever-changing and ever-expanding world, how we engage with the frighteningly boundless American landscape, how we discover hope and foster connection despite an overwhelming feeling of waywardness and isolation. Ride Lonesome is a reflection on not just the American experience, but the human experience.
