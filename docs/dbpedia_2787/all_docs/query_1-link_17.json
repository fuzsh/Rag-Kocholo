        "text": "Hello everyone, I am writing this complete guide on how to become an independent filmmaker because I feel like this is something I should have read when I first started out. This is, in other words, a manual I want to give to myself 10 years ago if I could travel back in time.\n\nThis will be a wall of text, but for those of you who have the patience and are willing to read all the way through, you should have a better understanding of what it takes to become a filmmaker and how the whole process works from beginning to end.\n\nI am not a “guru” and these instructions should not steer you away from your path if you have already found success or have a solid business model. This guide is from my own personal experience and the information presented here could be inaccurate or obsolete in a few years, depending on many different factors in the ever changing independent film world. With that disclaimer out of the way let’s get to it!\n\nI personally believe filmmaking can be divided into 2 categories. The first is “Serious” filmmaking and the second is “Popcorn” filmmaking. Both have their pros and cons. This guide will concentrate more on Popcorn filmmaking because that is the path I have chosen. I will digress here and there and talk more about serious filmmaking for those interested in going down that path but the main subject of this guide is on how to produce and distribute entertaining popcorn short films at the no budget level. ($50-$2000)\n\nWhat is Serious filmmaking? “Serious” in my opinion consists of non-genre films, mainly pure dramas and period dramas, non-narrative, avant-garde & experimental filmmaking. If you wish to go down this path, then know that this is the more expensive, difficult, longer & slower path. However the rewards can be very huge if you have the fire in you to become the next Terence Malick or Barry Jenkins as you will be very well respected and seen as a serious storyteller and win many awards. These filmmakers also have the opportunities to do blockbusters such as Chloé Zhao and Cary Joji Fukunaga, while pure popcorn filmmakers rarely enter this exclusive space and are not as respected by film critics.\n\nWhat is Popcorn filmmaking? Popcorn films in my opinion, are high concept, genre films with a clear simple narrative that can be summarized in one powerful sentence, aka Logline. These are the type of stories that resonate with a global audience and have the potential to go viral online. This is also a highly competitive space but it is also where most legends such as David F. Sandberg (lights out, Shazam), Andrés Muschietti (mama, It) & James Wan (Saw, Aquaman) got their big break.\n\nFilmmaking is one of the most expensive art forms in the world. The sooner you realize that 99.999% of short films don’t make any money, the quicker you can decide which of these 2 paths you want to take. Short films are a huge investment in your career and time. You are building a portfolio and also playing the lottery to see if one of your stories goes viral (popcorn) or gets critical acclaim (serious).\n\nThe myth of the “overnight sensation” glosses over how many of these successful filmmakers we worship have at one point struggled like us and made dozens of short films that were never released or shown to a wide audience. For every Tarantino there are thousands who gave up and never reached their full potential.\n\nAnother disclaimer I want to point out is that filmmaking is a full-time commitment. You are committing at least a decade or more of your life to becoming a starving artist. For most people this will mean losing their 20s and seeing their friends drive cars, buy houses, have children , etc. Is that the path you want to take? If filmmaking is truly your passion then it will be an easy yes. I have seen over the years many talented filmmakers who have given up because they have taken full time jobs or lost their passion, this is the death sentence. If you don’t have a family that supports and invests in your career then you will need to get a part-time job to make ends meet, but the moment you take on another full-time career, your filmmaking dreams will be secondary and non-existent. Another trap you can fall into is if you become a full-time music video director or full-time employee at a rental or post house, so while you are working in the entertainment industry, you won’t have time to become a narrative filmmaker.\n\nOK, so how do we make MANY short films and minimize costs & risks i.e. how do we not go broke and in debt within a year?\n\nAccording to a PHD study by Dr J.T. Velikovsky, Ph.D, titled StoryAltiy (do read his blog, very good info) the cheapest movies to make that gets the most viewers are horror films by writer-hyphenates. This is very important.\n\nI will start with explaining writer-hyphenates. A filmmaker is a visual storyteller. So in that sense your greatest asset, is your ability to tell a good story. All the legends, Tarantino, Rodriguez, Cameron, Nolan etc all started out as writer-hyphenates. That means you need to be able to write screenplays. If you are a director, producer or actor that requires the help of a writer and their ideas to create art, then you don’t have a voice and won’t stand out in the overcrowded space of low budget visual entertainment.\n\nWriting is the cheapest art, and yet it is the hardest of all filmmaking skills to master. To make a good popcorn flix and stand out amongst the crowd, you either need a very powerful concept or a very emotional story that resonates with the audience or better yet both!\n\nNow I believe writing is not something that can be taught, it can only be honed through years of experience but I can part with tips and knowledge that I find most useful through years of scouring youtube for tips and tricks.\n\nBy far the biggest mistake, filmmakers make, is that they confuse a situation for a story. Writing and filming a good situation can open the door for you as evidence by short films such as Lights Out, Mama, and Panic Attack, but these legends would not have the opportunity to direct Hollywood movies if they had not mastered the craft of telling a story. Go read Lights Out treatment for example. If David F. Sandberg was not able to write that treatment, Lights Outs would at worst, not get made or at best, the idea would have been bought and he would maybe get a story credit but have no further involvement.\n\nWhat is a story? A story is a situation that propels the protagonist to find inner change. This internal change, the hero’s journey, whether positive (star wars) or negative (requiem for a dream) is what gives your story a moral and a thematic statement which is a subjective answer you present at the end of the story. This statement is not the absolute truth but gives the audience food for thought that propels ordinary situations into myths. Example Star Wars Episode 3: Did Anakin (tragic hero) kill all those people to save his love, or was is for greed? Your goal as a popcorn filmmaker is to create myths that can be turned into new franchise blockbusters.\n\nNow to start writing a story you need a powerful concept. A concept can be summarized as a logline. A very powerful 1 sentence, that will hook your audience and make them want to watch your film. A logline should consist of the protagonist, the conflict (what they must do/what is stopping them) and the reason for it (what is at stake?)\n\nExample: A desperate junkie must rob his father’s drug store so he can go cross country with his girlfriend to meet his dying mother.\n\nThis logline tells us everything we need to know about the story. It could be a dark comedy-heist-road movie, there are two antagonists, his father, who is preventing him from getting the money, and his girlfriend who probably fuels his bad drug habits and his dying mother which is what’s at stake.\n\nWith a powerful concept it is time to put it into a structure. The most popular structure is the 3-act structure. This structure can be seen in countless movies, and the worldwide audience is so accustomed to it that if you do not follow this structure, then most viewers will think you didn’t “nail” the story or something feels off. In essence, the 3-act structure is the beginning middle and end with multiple turning points (big and small situations where the protagonist can’t turn back and must go forward). Google 3 act structure and put them up on your wall. Drill it into your head. 2 of the best ones are by Blake Snyder and Michael Hauge.\n\nThe 3-act structure is there to give you a narrative line you can work with. Some of my favorite films, El Topo, Too old to die young and Memento do not follow the typical Hollywood 3 act structure, but these Auteurs have complete mastery and understanding of beginning, middle and ending that they know how to bend the rules and create compelling narratives that the audience can easily follow.\n\nThe 3 act structure is the physical conflict your hero must overcome but there is also an internal conflict you must tell. This is where the Hero’s journey/arc comes in. The most popular one today is Dan Harmon’s story circle, based on Joseph Campbell’s The Hero’s Journey. This structure fits best with Mythological hero stories such as Luke Skywalker, Frodo, Bilbo etc but there are different types of arcs you can use. Example Flat arc (cat in the hat), Disillusionment arc ( Thin red line), Fall arc (star wars prequels) Corruption arc (Godfather) etc. Google for more arcs and details.\n\nNow if you are a beginner popcorn filmmaker who has done less than 3 short films, these story tools should be studied and honed but your best bet is probably writing a powerful situation with a very strong concept where the main character doesn’t go through a change. Why? Because your best bet is to start with 5 minute or shorter short films, preferably at least 3 before doing longer shorts. If you can hold the audience’s attention for 5 minutes then you can expand and create more complex stories and scale up to 10, 15 then 30 and finally feature length. If you are a serious filmmaker then drama requires internal change so you do need to implement a character arc and see if you can fit that within the 5 minute time frame.\n\nLast words about writing, at any time during the filmmaking process, you should constantly have a minimum of 5 loglines in your incubator that you are constantly developing. This is so that you have a good concept ready to go and develop once you are in postproduction on your latest film. That way you won’t have an unproductive moment in your quarterly schedule. Treat your company and career as a startup. If you only have one concept and it flops what happens?\n\nOk enough about writing. Let’s talk about Horror. Why are horror films the most viral genre? Horror films are the most viral because they are the cheapest to make and presents a narrative that resonates with all cultures worldwide. Horror taps into our primal fears of life & death. A good horror film will reach a wider audience than a difficult drama story that is very culture specific or dealing with taboo topics many cultures are not ready to face yet.\n\nWith the over-saturation of visual media, the few ways to stand out is if you have a name talent attached to your project. A short film with Brad Pitt or Meryl Streep will have a built in audience, and will receive free press but the chances of you or me attaching big names are 0%. Horror is one of the few genres that doesn’t require a big name actor to go viral, other genres could include sci-fi and fantasy to some extent but those genres require heavy visual effects, elaborate costumes and set pieces that is outside the budget for most independent filmmakers. I am not forcing you to create horror short films but if you want to survive as a filmmaker and constantly create, you need to make the cheapest movie possible with the widest audience possible. The quicker you realize short films are a loss leader and that you are playing with your own money and time the quicker you will understand that film is an art but also a business. Your main goal is to get views on your films and build an established brand so that big money can finance your more ambitious projects.\n\nNow for the serious filmmakers, you have a difficult story to and you don’t want to “dumb it down” by turning it into a genre film. What can you do? My suggestion is you go to filmfreeway and filter out to only free ($0) festival submission fees and see what type of films they are looking for. You will quickly get a sense of what type of stories the industry deems important that they are willing to watch submissions for free. Usually these themes revolve around environment, water shortage, immigration issues, cultural integration, LGBT, feminism and also animation. So if you have a powerful dramatic story to tell, try to see if you can fit in within these themes. If you are a member of the LGBT community or have multiple female or LGBT filmmakers in Above-the-line positions such as director and producer then, the doors will open for financing through government grants and private grants that support equality and change. In other words this path is a team effort and the more powerful friends you have, the higher chance you will succeed as a serious filmmaker.\n\nOK back to popcorn. Now that you have a completed script how do you make the film? As previously stated, the best bet for a long and sustainable career in the independent world is if you become an Auteur. Writer-hyphenate is a must, but the more you can do the stronger your vision will be, the cheaper your production costs will be and the less reliance you will have on others. Example: you have a cinematographer who dropped out last minute, what now, scrap the film? Beg and pay someone else even more money to work on your film in a desperate last minute call? NO! This is not sustainable and a terrible business plan.\n\nYou need to be able to direct actors, operate camera, light, produce, edit, color grade, sound edit & mix and create visual effects all by yourself. Yes. This is crazy. This takes years of practice and skills. How do you do this? If you have parents who can support you and you are still young, early 20s, I suggest you go to a film school, and a good one if you can afford it. Film school gives you practical experience and access to all equipments and mentors. If you do go to film school then don’t be the kid that only wants to direct. Everyone wants to direct, but if all you can do is talk to actors but you know nothing about sound, editing or camera lighting then you won’t become an Auteur, unless you have a deep trust fund and can afford to hire professional crews to bring your vision to life.\n\nA common counter argument is don’t go to filmschool save that $10K-40K and make your own movie! I guarantee you if you’ve only watched youtube tutorials and never been on a film set and you blow all that money on one passion project, you will make a stinker.\n\nSide note: The only position I would spend money on is the production sound mixer as they are the hardest to find and you can’t operate both camera and sound unless you do dry takes but that will double the length of your schedule. Today 2022, there is a $600 investment known as zoom F6, this field recorder allows your actors to scream or whisper and you will still have good sound without clipping or terrible noise. With the F6 and a reasonable microphone like rode ntg3; total cost around $1000, you will have the ability to give this equipment to non-filmmaking friends and family and have them help you out on set. Yes, this is a big investment but it will pay off if you are planning on making filmmaking your career, see this as the total cost of 10 days of hiring a professional production sound mixer who owns their own equipment.\n\nAnother way to gain experience is through the music video route. Music videos are constantly made and super ultra competitive. It is the race to the bottom to see who can do it for the least amount of money or for free. As a beginner, you should beg every single musician in your area to do their music video for free. That way you can learn how to operate the camera, experiment with lighting and apply the knowledge you got from free youtube videos or film school on your own set."
