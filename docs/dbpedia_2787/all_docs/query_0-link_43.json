        "text": "Arrow Videoâs August films include a brilliantly original American indie comedy, a pair of out-there arthouse masterworks, a rediscovered 70s horror creepfest, a terrifying Korean ghost story, and definitive, collectable editions of an awe-inspiring science fiction blockbuster. The releases will come in limited edition packaging, with beautiful new artwork, pristine restorations giving the films a new lease of life, brand new expert commentaries and feature-length documentaries, reversible sleeves, as well as goodies including fold-out posters, art cards, books and illustrated booklets.\n\nFirst in August,Â Arrow Video presentsÂ the mind-blowing 'acid-western'Â El Topo, which shocked and bedazzled audiences upon its controversial original release, single-handedly inventing the American midnight movie phenomenon.Â August also sees the release of Jodorowsky’s most ambitious film,Â The Holy Mountain. The scandal of the 1973 Cannes Film Festival, this is a sprawling phantasmagoria of sacrilegious visual excess and existential yearning. Then Arrow releasesÂ The Sergio Martino Collection, three of the finest giallos from one of Italian cinema’s most celebrated and prolific filmmakers:Â The Case of the Scorpion’s Tail,Â Your Vice is a Locked Room and Only I Have the Key, andÂ The Suspicious Death of a Minor. Next in August,Â Welcome to the DollhouseÂ collides withÂ Napoleon DynamiteÂ â with an added dose of the endlessly quotable dialogue ofÂ HeathersÂ â inÂ Dinner in AmericaÂ â a DIY love letter to being authentically yourself, finding your voice, and being punk AF.\n\nNext up isÂ A Tale of Two SistersÂ â director Kim Jee-woon (A Bittersweet Life, I Saw The Devil) made his international reputation with this richly conceived, stylishly shot, and genuinely scary chiller, one of the key films of the Korean New Wave. Blind BeastÂ is a grotesque portrait of the bizarre relationship between a blind sculptor and his captive muse, adapted from a short story from Japan’s foremost master of the macabre, Edogawa Rampo (Horrors of Malformed Men, The Black Lizard, Caterpillar). More horror in August, this time with a small rural town and a family of outsiders, both trapped in the demonic grip ofâ¦Â The Brotherhood of Satan.Your video shelves will be groaning for mercy by the end of August, as Arrow releases four editions ofÂ Dune â as well as the Limited Edition Blu-ray, there will also be a Limited Edition UHD version, and two Zavvi Exclusive SteelBooks. Finally in August, Dario Argento’sÂ The Cat O’ Nine Tails: following the success of his debut feature,Â The Bird with the Crystal Plumage, distributor Titanus tasked writer/director Dario Argento with delivering a follow-up in short order.\n\nEL TOPO (Mexico 1970) | Blu-ray | 2 August 2021 | Â£24.99\n\nA mind-blowing 'acid-western' which shocked and bedazzled audiences upon its controversial original release, El Topo single-handedly invented the American midnight movie phenomenon...\n\nJodorowsky's most violent and notorious film sees the director play 'The Mole' of the title: a black-clad. master gunfighter. In the first half, El Topo journeys across the desert dreamscape with his young son (Brontis Jodorowsky) to duel with four sharp-shooting Zen masters, who each bestow a Great Lesson before they die. In the second half, El Topo becomes the guru of a subterranean tribe of deformed outcasts who he must liberate from depraved cultists in a neighbouring town.\n\nA countercultural masterpiece which ingeniously combines iconic Americana symbolism with Jodorowsky's own idiosyncratic surrealist aesthetic, El Topo is an incredible journey through nightmarish violence, mind-bending mysticism and awe-inspiring imagery.

Finally, The Suspicious Death of a Minor combines giallo and crime thriller tropes as undercover cop Paolo pursues the Milanese criminal outfit responsible for the brutal murder of an underage prostitute, but finds himself up against a killer-for-hire who’s bumping off witnesses before they have a chance to talk.\n\nFeaturing sensational casts of genre stalwarts, including Edwige Fenech, George Hilton, Anita Strindberg and Luigi Pistilli, with scripts by giallo master Ernesto Gastaldi and sensuous scores by maestro Bruno Nicolai, this is an essential collection for any Italian cult cinema fan.\n\nSPECIAL EDITION BLU-RAY CONTENTS:\n\nThree films from Sergio Martino: The Case of the Scorpion's Tail, Your Vice is a Locked Room and Only I Have the Key, and The Suspicious Death of a Minor, restored in 2K from the original camera negative\n\nHigh Definition Blu-ray (1080p) presentation for all filmsÂ\n\nOriginal uncompressed mono Italian and English audio tracksÂ\n\nOptional English subtitles for Italian audio and English subtitles for the deaf and hard of hearing for English audio\n\nNewly commissioned artwork by Marc Schoenbach\n\nTHE CASE OF THE SCORPION'S TAIL:\n\nAudio commentary with writer Ernesto Gastaldi, moderated by filmmaker Federico Caddeo (in Italian with English subtitles)Â\n\nUnder the Sign of the Scorpion â an interview with star George Hilton\n\nThe Scorpion Tales â an interview with director Sergio MartinoÂ\n\nJet Set Giallo â an analysis Sergio Martino’s films by Mikel J.

Her kidnapper introduces himself as Michio (Eiji Funakoshi), a blind sculptor whom she had witnessed previously at an exhibition in which she featured intently caressing a statue of her naked torso. Michio announces his intention of using her to sculpt the perfect female form. At first defiant, she eventually succumbs to his intense fixation on her body and finds herself drawn into his sightless world, in which touch is everything.\n\nBlind Beast is a masterpiece of erotic horror that explores the all-encompassing and overwhelming relationship between the artist and his art and the obsessive closed world that the artist inhabits, with maestro director Yasuzo Masumura (Giants and Toys, Irezumi) conjuring up a hallucinogenic dreamworld in which sensual and creative urges combine with a feverish intensity.Â\n\nSPECIAL EDITION BLU-RAY CONTENTS:\n\nHigh Definition Blu-ray (1080p) presentation\n\nOriginal uncompressed Japanese mono audio\n\nOptional English subtitles\n\nBrand new audio commentary by Asian cinema scholar Earl Jackson\n\nNewly filmed introduction by Japanese cinema expert Tony RaynsÂ\n\nBlind Beast: Masumura the Supersensualist, a brand new visual essay by Japanese literature and visual studies scholar Seth JacobowitzÂ\n\nOriginal TrailerÂ\n\nImage GalleryÂ\n\nReversible sleeve featuring original and newly commissioned artwork by Tony StellaÂ\n\nFIRST PRESSING ONLY: Illustrated booklet featuring new writing by Virginie SÃ©lavy\n\nTHE BROTHERHOOD OF SATAN (USA 1971) | Blu-ray | 30 August 2021 | Â£24.99\n\nA small rural town and a family of outsiders, both trapped in the demonic grip ofâ¦ The Brotherhood of Satan!\n\nRecently widowed Ben, his glamourous girlfriend Nicky and his small daughter K.T. are on a road trip across the Southwest, which comes to a screeching halt when they witness an accident. Heading to the nearby isolated desert town of Hillsboro to report it to the Sheriff (played by L.Q. Jones), they are met with a hostile reaction from the locals, who are gripped by paranoia and fear due to a series of gruesome deaths, as well as the mysterious disappearance of eleven of the community’s children. As the bodies continue to pile up around them, Ben and his family find themselves joining the sheriff, a local priest and the town’s enigmatic physician Doc Duncan (Strother Martin, Cool Hand Luke) in the midst of a mystery that points towards a deadly satanic cult...\n\nProduced by Alvy Moore and L.Q. Jones, a veteran character actor best known for his work with Sam Peckinpah, The Brotherhood of Satan is an atmospheric and chilling tale of terror that provides a crucial missing link between Rosemary’s Baby (1968) and The Devil’s Rain (1975) in the cycle of turn-of-the-seventies shockers involving sinister devil-worshipping cults lurking within the dark shadows of modern-day America.\n\nSPECIAL EDITION BLU-RAY CONTENTS:\n\nHigh Definition Blu-ray (1080p) presentation\n\nOriginal uncompressed mono audio\n\nOptional English subtitles\n\nBrand new audio commentary by writers Kim Newman and Sean HoganÂ\n\nSatanic Panic: How the 1970s Conjured the Brotherhood of Satan, a brand new visual essay by David FlintÂ\n\nThe Children of Satan, exclusive new interview with actors Jonathan Erickson Eisley and Alyson MooreÂ\n\nOriginal Trailers and TV and Radio Spots\n\nImage GalleryÂ\n\nReversible sleeve featuring original and newly commissioned artwork by Richard Wells\n\nFIRST PRESSING ONLY: Illustrated booklet featuring new writing by Johnny Mains and Brad Stevens\n\nDUNE (USA | Mexico 1984) | Limited Edition Blu-ray / Limited Edition UHD | 30 August 2021 | Â£29.99 (Blu-ray) / Â£34.99 (UHD)\n\nFollowing a notorious aborted attempt by Alejandro Jodorowsky in the 1970s, Frank Herbert’s bestselling sci-fi epic Dune finally made it to the big screen as the third film by emerging surrealist wunderkind David Lynch, featuring an all-star cast that includes several of Lynch’s regular collaborators.\n\nThe year is 10,191, and four planets are embroiled in a secret plot to wrest control of the Spice Melange, the most precious substance in the universe and found only on the planet Arrakis. A feud between two powerful dynasties, House Atreides and House Harkonnen, is manipulated from afar by ruling powers that conspire to keep their grip on the spice. As the two families clash on Arrakis, Duke Atreides’ son Paul (Kyle MacLachlan, in his screen debut) finds himself at the centre of an intergalactic war and an ancient prophecy that could change the galaxy forever.\n\nThough its initial reception ensured that Lynch largely eschewed mainstream filmmaking for the rest of his career, Dune has since been rightly re-evaluated as one of the most startlingly original and visionary science fiction films of the 1980s.

The resulting film, granted a greatly enhanced budget and heralded in its US marketing campaign as “nine times more suspenseful” than its predecessor, was The Cat O’ Nine Tails.\n\nWhen a break-in occurs at a secretive genetics institute, blind puzzle-maker Franco ArnÃ² (Karl Malden, Patton, One-Eyed Jacks), who overheard an attempt to blackmail one of the institute’s scientists shortly before the robbery, teams up with intrepid reporter Carlo Giordani (James Franciscus, Beneath the Planet of the Apes) to crack the case. But before long the bodies begin to pile up and the two amateur sleuths find their own lives imperilled in their search for the truth. And worse still, Lori (Cinzia De Carolis, Cannibal Apocalypse), Franco’s young niece, may also be in killer’s sightsâ¦\n\nThis second entry in the so-called “Animal Trilogy” found Argento further refining his distinctive style and cementing his reputation as the master of the giallo thriller. Co-starring Catherine Spaak (Il Sorpasso) and Rada Rassimov (Baron Blood), and featuring another nerve-jangling score by the great Ennio Morricone (The Bird with the Crystal Plumage, The Good, The Bad and the Ugly), The Cat O’ Nine Tails remains one of Argento’s most suspenseful and underrated films.\n\n4K ULTRA HD BLU-RAY LIMITED EDITION CONTENTS:"
