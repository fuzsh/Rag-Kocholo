        "text": "From Apocalypse Now to Suspiria and The Exorcist, the 15 Most Visionary Films of the 1970s\n\nHow to watch: Stream clips on YouTube.\n\nValerie and Her Week of Wonders (1970) and Suspiria (1977)\n\nHow to watch: Stream via Metrograph at Home.\n\nApocalypse Now (1979)\n\nEven after the rising popularity of the American anti-war movement, by the beginning of the 1970s Hollywood studios were still dedicated to producing mostly elegiac Second World War movies like Patton and Tora! Tora! Tora!, which focused on America’s victorious defeat of the Axis powers. The tribulations of Vietnam, however, remained a delicate subject that few major studios would touch until well into the decade. Films like Go Tell the Spartans, Coming Home, and The Deer Hunter, sometimes referred to as “vetsploitation,” were the first in a string of war movies to present the extreme carnage and crushing aftermath of deployment to Vietnam. Francis Ford Coppola’s Apocalypse Now, however, was an entirely different animal. Neither a realistic portrayal of the battleground nor a romanticized melodrama of the soldier’s return, Apocalypse Now is a Dantesque tour through the underworld of human folly. Coppola famously used a dog-eared copy of Joseph Conrad’s novella Heart of Darkness as a guide during filming, inspired by the 19th-century tale of an steamer captain’s search for a trader who had gone mad and become a warlord in the Congo. Coppola’s brutal imagery of napalm strikes, beheadings, hackings, and animal sacrifice immersed the viewer in an almost hallucinatory vision of war that most closely mimicked the experiences of the real thing. Decades later, the director claimed the film was not explicitly anti-war because of its celebratory images of violence, which had been co-opted by the pro-war crowd. But there are few other films before or since that have revealed the sheer physical barbarity and psychotropic horror of warfare.\n\nHow to watch: Stream on Apple TV, Prime Video, or YouTube."
