        "text": "Join us for a candid conversation with Anaïs Taracena, director and producer of El Silencio del Topo (The Silence of the Mole, 2021), the award-winning documentary about a journalist who infiltrated the brutal and repressive government of Guatemala in the 1970s. Taracena, a self-trained filmmaker who studied political science, spent 6 years making the film. Despite a lack of sales agent and festival consultant interest, Taracena constructed her own documentary A-list film festival run (Sheffield, IDFA, Hot Docs) and specifically targeted audiences in countries with recent civil wars (Dokufest, Jeonju).\n\nOpen only to filmmakers, this event will give behind-the-scenes access to the business and craft of filmmaking from Anais’ perspective as a first-time filmmaker in Central America. In particular, this session will delve into specific situations such as misunderstandings in international development labs regarding the unique Guatemalan political context, challenges of building trust with participants within a culture of silence, and gathering archival materials outside of formal institutions.\n\nThis event is free and open only to filmmakers. El Silencio del Topo will be available for registrants to view one week before and one week after the event.\n\nAbout the Getting Real Fellowship\n\nThe Getting Real Fellowship seeks to spotlight emerging and mid-career documentary professionals who have inspired visions that will benefit their communities and the field at large.\n\nAfter attending Getting Real, the fellows spend the next year programming workshops and discussions inspired by their time at the conference."
