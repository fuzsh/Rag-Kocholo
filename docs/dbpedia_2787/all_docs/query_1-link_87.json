        "text": "Today I Watched George Englund’s Zachariah (1971)\n\nThere is an independent spirit that permeates the Acid Western genre, it has never been a true movement and thus the inspirations of the film makers contributing to it are wide ranging and diverse. The element of Zachariah that really makes it stand out is its theme of peace; the western genre is largely typified by violence, cynicism and a certain emotional aggressiveness that has been passed down to the majority of Acid Westerns as well. So Zachariah’s themes of peace and tranquility really make it stand out even in a subgenre as diverse as this.\n\nThe Zachariah of the title is a young rancher who receives a gun through mail-order in the hopes of becoming a gunfighter with his best friend Matthew. While they find some success, Zach continues to feel discontent and he sets out to find inner peace on his own. While this plot could be taken in some dark directions Zachariah opts to keep everything light and fun, which isn’t to say it lacks maturity, it still explores its themes with incredible insight.\n\nOne important aspect of Zachariah that must be mentioned is the music; Rock and Roll permeates this film in attitude, score, and in a large number of creative anachronisms throughout. While it is not quite a musical it certainly is a music movie as much of the plot hinges on these music numbers and they help develop a lot of the themes. It is this rock attitude that gives Zachariah its stamp of Acid Western and when combined with its carefree yet mindful attitude it becomes an incredibly fun film. 5/5\n\nToday I Watched Robert Downey’s Greaser’s Palace (1972)\n\nGreaser’s Palace would defy categorization if were not for the tag of Acid Western, it transplants a passion play into the desperate times of the frontier in a perplexingly lackadaisical manner. This is not to say it is a bad film as this is certainly an intentional stylistic choice. The effect it has on the film is to lend it a very natural feel, almost like the actions are being improvised.\n\nThe film is essentially a series of vignettes assembled along the loose guidelines of a Passion narrative. These vignettes run the gamut of tone and emotion, from disturbing to comedic, and Downey struggles to tie them together cohesively. Greaser’s Palace is the story of a man named Jesse who, like Jesus, can walk on water and heal the sick. Jesse is on a trip to Jerusalem to become an actor and along the way comes to a town run by the mildly nefarious Mr. Greaser. But this all implies there is some kind of greater plot which there really is not in this film.\n\nI mentioned this film’s lackadaisical manner earlier and it bears repeating. Without much tension or plot the film opts to show a great deal of mundane action, walking to and fro and the like. This works to the film’s advantage though as the natural feel of the movement offsets the limited nature of the setting in a very surreal manner.\n\nGreaser’s Palace is a difficult film to review because of how little it cares to explain itself. The film’s inconsistent narrative is incredibly enigmatic but its humour and wit shine through. Greaser’s Palace is similar to El Topo in that it is so personal, and it has many fascinating images to digest. 4/5\n\nToday I watched Monte Hellman’s The Shooting (1966)\n\nThe Shooting is considered by many as the first film, chronologically, to display the Acid Western Ethos and like all Acid Westerns it is a singular and unique film. I have seen the term Kafkaesque thrown around a lot when describing this film and that is a very apt term to use, the film’s minimalist experimentation and deconstruction of the Quest have that particular cynicism and nightmarish tone reminiscent of the German writer. The story concerns one Mr. Gashade, a frontiersman hired by a mysterious woman to track someone into the desert with the intention of cold murder.\n\nMonte Hellman directs the film with an expert hand; he uses every tool available to him to bring this bleak narrative to life. The natural lighting is harsh but used with such expert technique that it almost seems like he trucked a whole kit out to the desert. His shot composition can be unsettling but also adds to the verisimilitude of the setting. With such a minimalist story the actors become much more important, small cues in body language and facial tics speak volumes about a character when unnatural exposition is done away with. And the cast here all do a great job embodying their characters; Jack Nicholson is particularly striking as a merciless killer.\n\nThis is an incredible movie, but a quiet one. Hellman does not try to shock or overwhelm the audience, instead he lets the story evolve naturally without pomp and ceremony. The philosophical musings present are likewise toned down, creating a sense of vacancy that perfectly matches the desert surrounding and takes the heroes journey to a very dark place indeed. 5/5\n\nToday I watched Jan Kuonen’s Blueberry (2004)\n\nBlueberry is a very popular comic in France, originally created by artist Jean Giraud and writer Jean-Michel Charlier. This film adaptation, along with El Topo, demonstrates how the Acid Western ethos can manifest itself when a foreign artist finds inspiration in the myth of the west and it’s more surreal and spiritual aspects. Blueberry the film tells the story of Mike Blueberry, played by Vincent Cassel, a spiritual marshal who must do battle with the demons of his past.\n\nIt is interesting to see an acid western with more modern sensibilities and it is in its normalcy that Blueberry becomes very strange. The plot is a rather slow burn, which feels fairly by the numbers, it slowly builds in psychedelia as the shamanic themes begin to assert themselves. The main indicator early on is the disorienting cinematography and editing, it can be very hard to follow the action and that seems wholly intentional.\n\nThe failing of Blueberry can also be found in its assumed normalcy, the opening story hooks feel disconnected by the highly spiritual finale. The star studded cast also serves to distract and harms the film more than helps it. That being said once this film gets to the climactic psychedelic event, it becomes quite entrancing; the drug trip scenes are very authentic and unsettling. So while Blueberry is by no means perfect, it is interesting to see this modern take on the Acid Western ideology. 3/5\n\nToday I watched Alejandro Jodorowsky’s El Topo (1970)\n\nEl Topo is perhaps the most psychedelic Acid Western and one of the most psychedelic films period. Jodorowsky’s approach to cinema is incredibly idiosyncratic, at once blasphemous and reverent, exploitive and philosophical, personal and universal. Jodorowsky also plays the titulat El Topo, a merciless gunfighter clad in black on an allegorical quest for enlightenment. In El Topo the west is transformed into a fantastical and allegorical place that has been largely divorced of its American origins.\n\nThis film explores many themes as it follows El Topo’s existential journeys; it touches on fatherhood, slavery, sexuality, and justice among numerous other concepts. It is the film’s intensely personal nature that allows it to handle this diversity of ideas, as it follows one man’s journey through life it is only natural for such numerous themes to crop up. Jodorowsky has a seemingly encyclopedic knowledge of symbolism which he combines with a strong understanding of pantomime to tell much of this story. This has the effect of making the film rather difficult to comprehend and I think only Jodorowsky himself fully understands it.\n\nJodorowsky is very interested by the artifice of film, he always tries to preserve the artifice of his work because he does not want his audience to forget that they are watching a film and thus he hopes they will appreciate it fully as a film. This philosophy leads to some seriously surreal films and El Topo is one of the most out there, this unique perspective has made the film a classic, hailed by some as the first “Midnight Movie” and having an influence all across the world of cinema. El Topo wholly deserves this reputation, it is extreme and personal in a way that most films will never dare to be and that makes it essential cinema. 5/5\n\nToday I watched Jim Jarmusch’s Dead Man (1995)\n\nDead Man was the first film to be called an ‘Acid Western’ and can be seen as a template to compare other prospective entries to the genre. I find this rather interesting as Dead Man is certainly not the first film to fit this style, yet it was the first time anyone had noticed this undercurrent of counter-cultural, surreal film making. Jim Jarmusch is one of America’s most popular and important independant film makers, his films are typified by a naturally flowing narrative, a minimalist approach to cinematography, and a laconic wit.\n\nDead Man tells the story of William Blake, played by the very fitting Johnny Depp, who heads out west following a job opportunity and ends up on the run with a price on his head. Blake meets a Native American by the name of Nobody who steals most of this film with an incredible performance from Gary Farmer. The film unfolds without much hurry, creating a meditative space where the themes can really come to life.\n\nDead Man weaves many of these themes together with incredible effectiveness. On the one hand it has all the trappings of a deconstructionist western, poking fun at the stereotypes and de-mythologizing the west, while also holding deeper poetic musings on death, passing, and life. The film’s haunting imagery and expressive score, composed by the legendary Neil Young, create an atmosphere that evokes this idea of passing on perfectly. Jarmusch also makes heavy use of cultural references. The character of William Blake is mistaken for the poet of the same name and the film expresses some interest in cultural exchange, ideas Jarmusch would explore more fully in his next film Ghost Dog.\n\nThis is a rather incredible movie, Jarmusch weaves a fascinatingly bleak image of the wild west that seems more dream than reality. His west is a purgatory for the lost, wayward souls driven out by civilization. The way he subverts stereotypes and explores the tropes and conventions of a genre without imitating them is masterful film making. Dead Man leaves no wonder in my mind as to why it led to the uncovering of this genre, it simply excites wonder and imagination. 5/5\n\nToday in Acid Western Week I watched Alex Cox’ Walker (1987)\n\nIn the eighties America was embroiled in what is known as the Contra affair; while this was happening an intrepid filmmaker by the name of Alex Cox was making a movie about William Walker, an American mercenary turned Nicaraguan dictator. This was obviously not a coincidence and is a perfect demonstration of the radical and political side of the Acid Western. Walker is a film of brazen statements which are presented with an irreverent attitude, this can work in the film’s favour but may rub some the wrong way.\n\nEd Harris plays the titular Walker, a man obsessed with American manifest destiny, a philosophy this movie wastes no time to vilify and mock. Cox chooses a rather interesting approach to the story telling, he treats his subject with an incredible amount of disrespect. This can come off as rather puerile but it is all in service of avoiding one of the major failings of many other films like this, the accidental glorification of imperialism and warfare. I think that the technique works quite well, it paints the imperialist as an impotent loser, a megalomaniac, and anything but ‘cool.’ This irreverence combines with a steady stream of anachronisms to really illustrate the point and show the horrendous truth behind imperialism and exceptionalism.\n\nWalker, like many Acid Westerns, stretches the idea of the Western genre. Ed Harris is brilliant in his portrayal of Walker and his sociopathic personality can be quite frightening. If I have one bad thing to say about the film it is that it pushes its political agenda perhaps a little too strongly and some of its use of newsreel footage at the end struck me as somewhat exploitative. But aside from these issues I find Walker to be an incredibly inventive and entertaining film. It manages to be funny and disturbing in equal measure and was certainly ahead of its time in its irreverent political mockery. 4/5\n\nOne month ago I did a series of reviews showcasing Japanese director Takashi Miike, So let’s make a monthly theme week a tradition. The second full week of a month shall be a theme week; this ‘theme’ could be a look at a director’s work, at a specific genre, or similar related aspects among seven films. This week our theme is the cult genre of ‘Acid Westerns.’\n\nSo what is an Acid Western? Well the term itself comes from fellow critic Jonathan Rosenbaum in a review for the Jim Jarmusch film Dead Man. Rosenbaum’s use of the term caught on and has come to represent a certain rare breed of western films which combines the counter cultural ideologies of the sixties and seventies with the blood soaked desolation of the Spaghetti Western. Mysticism also has a large role in many of these films, the wastelands of the wild west are a perfect backdrop for these quests of spiritual self discovery. So without further ado let us get to the films!"
