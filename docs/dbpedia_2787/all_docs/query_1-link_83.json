This was a book that I found accidentally in a council library. Weirdly, I was in that library too, at that time, because of a cascade of other accidents. I had no place to go. I knew nothing about Jodorowsky. Weirdly, though I would eventually develop deep reservations about the philosophy, applying some Jodorowskian tricks and hacks to my life, I am in much better shape — mentally, artistically, and otherwise — than I have ever been before."
