        "text": "Program Manager Mark Anastasio leads this virtual seminar on the darkly funny and terrifying werewolf classic.\n\nRegister Here\n\nHow will this work?\n\nWhen you register for this virtual education seminar, the program will be presented in three parts.\n\nAt least one week before the seminar, you'll receive an email with a link to watch a pre-taped lecture, to view before the film at your convenience. Please make sure to check your spam folder for this link before emailing our support team.\n\nThen, you can go off and watch the film on your own. Please note, the Coolidge is not able to provide the film ourselves, but you can find out where to rent and/or stream it here.\n\nMake sure you watch the film before the discussion, which will take place on Thursday, October 15 at 8pm EST over Zoom. Before the discussion, you can submit questions for the instructor here. You'll also have the opportunity to submit questions during the discussion!\n\nHave any technical questions? Visit our FAQ page here.\n\nAbout the Speaker\n\nA lifelong cinephile, Mark landed in Boston and immediately fell in love with the Coolidge Corner Theatre during a midnite screening of Alejandro Jodorowsky’s El Topo. His mind was blown, and he knew he had to do anything within his power to keep the Coolidge weird. Wielding his completely unsafe knowledge of genre films, he was appointed to the position of Program Manager. Mark’s many duties at the theatre include: programming, promoting, and pulling off the Coolidge After Midnite film series, curating the Annual Halloween Horror Movie Marathon, and co-programming the Coolidge's various repertory signature film series. In 2014 the Boston Society of Film Critics awarded the Coolidge After Midnite a special commendation \"for its idiosyncratic programming and remaining dedicated to 35mm exhibition\". Boston’s NPR station has said of him, “It’s an understatement to say that Mark Anastasio knows horror movies. This guy knows horror movies the way Ted Williams knew hitting and Stephen Hawking knows physics.” Mark has served as a juror for film festivals such as Independent Film Festival of Boston and the Boston Underground Film Festival. He has been a featured speaker on the subject of midnite movies at the Arthouse Convergence, and has written for numerous film sites, horror zines, and has even tweeted once or twice. Mark can be found on stage at the Coolidge each week introducing something strange and wonderful."
