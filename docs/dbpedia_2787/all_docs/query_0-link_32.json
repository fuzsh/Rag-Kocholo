        "text": "This week is Ben Barenholtz’ birthday.\n\nWe’d like to celebrate by running 2 pieces on his amazing wonderful life.\n\nThis is his public bio, which in itself, tells of a rich wonderful career in film.\n\nIn the next days we’ll publish his amazing memoir of his European childhood when he narrowly escaped from the hands of Jew killers during the War.\n\nI personally owe Ben a lot. When I was producing some years back Ben was working for Almi and bought an indie film I produced ‘Home Free All’ by Director\n\nStewart Bird for that company. The money from that deal paid our investors and took us out of a deep financial hole. I am always grateful to Ben for his\n\nvision and belief in us then.\n\nNow for his professional bio -\n\nBiography for Ben Barenholtz\n\nBirth Name Benjamin Barenholtz\n\nMini Biography\n\nAs an exhibitor, distributor, and producer, Ben Barenholtz has\n\nbeen a key presence in the independent film scene since the late 1960s,\n\nwhen he opened\n\nthe Elgin Cinema in New York City.\n\nBarenholtz secured his first job in the film business when he\n\nbecame assistant manager of the RKO Bushwick Theater in Brooklyn in\n\n1958. From 1966–68 he\n\nmanaged and lived in the Village Theater, which ultimately\n\nbecame the Filmore East. At the Village Theater Barenholtz provided a\n\nhome for the\n\ncounterculture, with appearances by Timothy Leary, Stokley\n\nCarmichael, Rap Brown, and Paul Krasner. Some of the first meetings of\n\nthe anti-Vietnam War\n\nmovement, including the Poets Against Vietnam, were held at the\n\nVillage Theater. It was also a major music venue, with performances by\n\nThe Who, Cream,\n\nLeonard Cohen, John Coltrane, Ornette Coleman, Nina Simone and\n\nmany others.\n\nIn 1968 he opened the Elgin Cinema. The theater became the\n\nworld’s most innovative specialty and revival house, relaunching the\n\nfilms of Buster Keaton\n\nand D.W. Griffith, running a variety of independent films by\n\nyoung American directors, and screening cult, underground, and\n\nexperimental films for the\n\nemerging countercultural audience. The films of Stan Brakhage,\n\nJack Smith, Maya Deren, Kenneth Anger, Jonas Mekas, and Andy Warhol, as\n\nwell as early\n\nworks by Jonathan Demme and Martin Scorsese, all played at the\n\nElgin.\n\nBarenholtz also developed new ways of screening movies. He started screening dance and opera films on Saturday and Sunday mornings. He created the “All\n\nNight Show” — movies started at midnight and ended at dawn. Most notably, Barenholtz originated the “Midnight Movie” in 1970 with Alexander\n\nJodorowsky’s El Topo, which ran for 6 months, 7 days a week, to sold out audiences.\n\nThe film was eventually bought by John Lennon. El Topo was followed\n\nat midnight by John Waters’ Pink Flamingoes and Perry Henzell’s The Harder They Come.\n\nBarenholtz formed the specialty distributor Libra Films in 1972.\n\nThe\n\nfirst film Libra distributed was a revival of Jean-Pierre Melville’s\n\nLes Enfants\n\nTerrible, followed by Claude Chabrol’s Just Before Nightfall,\n\nand Jean-Charles Tacchella’s Cousin, Cousine, which became one of the\n\nlargest grossing\n\nforeign films in the US and was nominated for 3 Academy Awards.\n\nLibra also launched and distributed, among others, George Romero’s\n\nMartin, John Sayles’\n\nfirst feature Return of the Secaucus Seven, David Lynch’s first\n\nfeature Eraserhead, Karen Arthur’s first feature Legacy, Earl Mack’s\n\nfirst feature\n\nChildren of Theater Street, and Peter Gothar’s first feature\n\nTime Stands Still.\n\nBarenholtz sold Libra Films to the Almi Group in 1982, but\n\nstayed with the company to become the President of Libra-Cinema 5 Films.\n\nIn 1984 he left\n\nAlmi and joined with Ted and Jim Pedas to form Circle Releasing.\n\nAmong the films released by Circle were Yoshimitsu Morita’s The Family\n\nGame, Guy\n\nMaddin’s first feature Tales From the Gimli Hospital, Vincent\n\nWard’s The Navigator, John Woo’s The Killer, Catherine Breillat’s 36\n\nFillette, DeWitt\n\nSage’s first feature Pavarotti In China, Alain Cavalier’s\n\nTherese, and Blood Simple, the first film by Joel and Ethan Coen.\n\nHis involvement in film production began with Wynn Chamberlain’s\n\nBrand X and George Romero’s Martin. He continued working with the Coens\n\non the\n\nproduction of Raising Arizona, and as executive producer of\n\nMiller’s Crossing and Barton Fink, which won the Palme d’Or at the 1991\n\nCannes Film\n\nFestival, as well as awards for Best Director and Best Actor.\n\nThis was the first and last time the three top honors have all gone to\n\nthe same film at\n\nCannes.\n\nBarenholtz went on to produce George Romero’s Bruiser, J Todd Anderson’s The Naked Man, Adek Drabinski’s Cheat, executive-produced Gregory Hines’\n\ndirectorial debut Bleeding Hearts and Ulu Grossbard’s Georgia, which earned an Academy Award nomination for Mare Winningham. He served as co-executive\n\nproducer of Darren Aronofsky’s Requiem for a Dream, which earned Ellen Burstyn an Academy Award nomination for Best Actress in 2000.\n\nBarenholtz appeared in the documentary The Hicks in Hollywood, had a bit role in Liquid Sky, and appeared as a zombie in Romero’s classic Dawn of the\n\nDead. He was the main subject of Stuart Samuels’ 2005 documentary Midnight Movies: From the Margin to the Mainstream.\n\nBarenholtz directed his first feature, Music Inn, a documentary about the famed jazz venue.\n\nBarenholtz was the producer of Jamie Greenberg’s feature film Stags.\n\nIn 2012, Barenholtz produced Suzuya Bobo’s first feature Family Games.\n\nBarenholtz has recently completed directing and post production on Wakaliwood the Documentary, which was shot entirely in Kampala, Uganda. The film\n\nwill be released in 2013.\n\nHe is now developing two feature fiction films which begin production in 2013.\n\nIMDb Mini Biography By: Ben Barenholtz"
