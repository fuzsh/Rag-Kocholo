        "text": "ONE of the most success ful films now playing in New York hasn't even opened here yet. That is, officially. It's a Mexi can film called “El Topo” (The Mole) and it's a two hour‐plus, surreal fantasy, which, since New Year's, has been playing midnight shows (1 A.M. on Fridays and Sat urdays) at the Elgin Theater, on Eighth Avenue near 19th Street. With a handful of re views in the underground press and none to speak of in the straight press, the film has been attracting capacity audiences, many of whose members are apparently re peaters who come back to turn on and to be turned on.\n\nThe film's local sponsor, Douglas Films, and the man agement of the Elgin have done practically no formal advertising. When they are extravagant, they add to the regular Elgin ads the tagline: “‘El Topo’ at midnight.” Even so, there has become attached to “El Topo” the sort of multi‐leveled chic that makes it a required ex perience for the experience collecting young, and that has, on a couple of occasions, I'm told, practically emptied Elaine's at that point in the evening when the more aged merrymakers face the alter natives of either going home or getting into fights at the bar.\n\nClearly, all of this is the result of extraordinary word of‐mouth, that mysterious phenomenon that once turned “Abie's Irish Rose” into one of the greatest hits the Amer ican theater has ever known and that, more recently, transformed “Airport” into the biggest money‐making movie of 1970. “El Topo” is by way of being this year's underground “Airport,” the sort of film that appears to render film criticism super fluous—which always sounds like a swell idea until I see the film that is supposed to score this cultural break through. “El Topo” is no ex ception, and when I saw it early one recent Saturday morning, I was about equally torn between my wonder at the uncritical' reverence with which the Elgin audience re ceived the film, and my im pulse to say something loud and rude.\n\nI must admit at this point that I approached the movie with mixed emotions. After all, I had just read the re view by Steven Fuller in Changes, in which he said, among other things, that: “‘El Topo’ is a masterpiece as much as it is a testament to one man's genius in this decaying world, Director (Alexandro) Jodorowsky has implanted deliberately almost every conceivable symbol system known to intellectual man. … Each man reads what he wants to into the film. A. J. Webberman reads Dylan and revolutionary poli tics into it, as he does into everything. The reviewer from Rolling Stone reads his own ineptitude into the film by his inability to use his eyes. … “\n\nI certainly didn't want to read my own ineptitude in the movie, nor was I exactly keen on seeing some kind of reflection of my mind's weaknesses. Glenn O'Brien, in the Village Voice, had said: “(Jodorowsky's) art is too violent for the most vio lent nation in history. The hero is too proud, too self conscious, and asks too many questions. But it is this very repulsion that ‘El Topo’ eli cits, this confusion that it reveals in weak minds, which makes it a work of cinematic cruelty, a weapon of spiritual revolution. … “\n\nHas “El Topo” really ren dered film criticism superflu ous, or is it spawning a kind of fascistic film criticism that hopes to strong‐arm the op position with suggestions of reflected ineptitude and con fused minds?\n\nI'd hazard the guess that a certain amount of the pro criticism, and of the pro‐au dience reaction generally, is itself the result of calculated intellectual intimidation with in the film itself, which has four acts subtitled “Genesis,” “Prophets,” “Psalms” and “Apocalypse.” Now no movie that has the surface sheen of one of Sergio Leone's super ior, made‐in‐Almeira West erns (and at least three‐times as much simulated blood and cruelty) can easily be de scribed as meaningless when its first act is Genesis. That, at least, seems to be the name of this game. It is not enough, however, to say that because every man can road into a movie what he wants, the movie is an artis tic meta‐experience. One might just as well isolate Nathan's, on the corner of Broadway and 43d Street, and invite the rest of us to take a trip on our various, totally subjective responses to the sights of spilt clam chowder and coagulating mustard and the smells of hot dogs com ing down to room tempera ture.\n\nAt this point, I suppose, I should backtrack to describe “El Topo,” which was writ ten, directed and co‐produced by Jodorowsky, who also plays its title role. El Topo is a mythic gunman who looks very much like Clint East wood's Man With No Name, but whose barrenly beau tiful desert landscape seems to have been borrowed from Fellini and stocked with images—such as the one of a bandit sucking on the toe of a lady's slipper—used earlier and better by Buñuel. Jodo rowsky is, I'm told, a Chil ean, in his early forties, who has had considerable success as a stage director in Mexico City and whose first film, “Fando and Lis,” an adapta tion of the Arrabal play, was released here last year. I somehow missed “Fando and Lis,” but the last paragraph of Roger Greenspun's review of that film could also apply to Jodorowsky's latest effort: “For all of its invocations of theater of cruelty, ‘Fando and Lis’ hardly ever scares up anything stronger than un pleasant whimsy.”\n\nIt isn't that “El Topo” is not about anything, but rather that it's about too much. Inventorying it is like sorting out the contents of a turkey buzzard's stomach: there is very little that's not there, but nothing much has been digested. To start with we are told—by a title card —that the mole spends its life burrowing tunnels up wards towards the sun, and that, when he sees the sun, he is often blinded. As moles are blinded, so once were Icarus's wings melted—and we are off into the sort of movie that is so full of sym bology that we appreciate oc casional, fleeting views of plain old landscapes with nothing in them. There is, after a while, only so much that nothing can mean.\n\nIn Genesis, El Topo rides a black stallion across the desert with his small nak ed son hanging on behind him. They come upon a vil lage whose citizens have been massacred by bandits and El Topo sets out to take revenge on the gang, which is led by a colonel who is probably God. God is event ually castrated by El Topo, His Son. In Prophets, El Topo, who has abandoned his son to the monks, and is now ac companied by Woman more evil than Eve, undergoes a series of epic trials in his quest for knowledge, physical perfection and spiritual sal vation. He succeeds in each through deception and mur der, then he dies (is it in “Psalms”?), only to be resur rected in Apocalypse, for an other series of adventures that lead back to the begin ning of the film.\n\nGod, original sin, Cathol icism, Zen, Lao‐tse, Christ, the conventions of movie Westerns, Ulysses and his Odyssey, aphorisms (“My butterfly net is stronger than your gun.” “Perfection is to get lost”)—they're all there, in a movie that is all guts (quite literally) but that has no body to give the guts par ticular shape or function. The movie has no life of its own. Jodorowsky is not interesting or inventive enough as a film maker to restructure reality, as, say, Buñuel does in his surreal classic, “L'Age D'Or.” He simply enumerates, cata logs, and I can believe Ful ler's rather awed statement in his review in Changes that Jodorowsky's library “con tains thousands of volumes covering every imaginable subject and literary period.” He could be the William Randolph Hearst of the movie intellect and “El Topo” his rather grotesque, ego‐salving San Simeon.\n\nMuch has been made of Jodorowsky's excessive cruel ties, as if the depiction of a world soaked in crimson paint, and in which faces dis integrate before our eyes in all sorts of fancy photograph ic effects, had some sort of cleansing effect (“a spiritual revolution,” O'Brien calls it). The fundamental effect, how ever, is one of elaborate, ex pensive movie mechanics. How does lie do it!\n\nA number of underground critics have compared “El Topo” to “Satyricon,” which is natural enough, I guess, since Jodorowsky outdoes Fellini in his fondness for freaks —pinheads, amputees, humpbacks, and the like—but because the movie is without fundamental order it never succeeds in becoming any thing more than a high class sideshow. Instead of the theater of cruelty, we have an amateur theatrical of the absurd. It is also, for all of its violence, rather prim and passionless, which is partially obscured by the director's fancy camerawork. However, it's his use of things like zooms and stately pans, and his fondness for Busby Ber keley‐like overhead shots, that deny Jodorowsky's real inter est. in “almost every conceiv able symbol system known to intellectual man.” It's as if he didn't trust the austerity of his vision (as Buñuel does) and felt compelled to hoke it up.\n\nThe movie isn't all bad. There are a few genuinely funny and terrifying mo ments, such as one sequence in which four bandits set out to rape four, not exactly pure monks. Then, also, the Mexi can Government apparently would like to disown the film on the grounds that it's anti‐Catholic. It was invited to compete at the Cannes Festival, now in progress, but the Mexican authorities re portedly refused to sanction its official showing, as a re sult of which it is being ex hibited at the festival unof ficially.\n\nI have the feeling that the Mexican authorities are a little like the members of the Elgin audience with whom I saw the film. I was amazed when, at the end of the screening, there was so little audience response. I would have assumed that a film with this much underground repu tation would have prompted cheers. There was some des ultory applause, but most of the people around me seemed to want to lie told whether it was good or bad, if not what it really meant. It's difficult, especially at three o'clock in the morning, to admit that you've been conned. Instead, like all those people who were taken in by the Duke and the Dauphin and their Royal Nonesuch, the audi ences march out of the Elgin and urge their friends to go. It would be a terrible mis take, I suspect, to show the movie earlier hour."
