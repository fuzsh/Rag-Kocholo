        "text": "Having survived certain death by the Nazis Ben lived life as if he was playing with house money. Most of us weren’t aware he was a Holocaust survivor until just a few years ago. What we did know is that he had come of age in Brooklyn when Brooklyn was not the “nice” place it is now.\n\nEarly on he spent time as Willem de Kooning’s carpenter and caroused with many of the Abstract Expressionists. He also hung out with James Baldwin, was responsible for getting Herbert Shelby’s novel Last Exit To Brooklyn published, staged Leonard Cohen’s first public performance, invented the midnight movie, was the primary discoverer of the Coen brothers, David Lynch, John Waters, Alejandro Jodoworsky, Guy Madden, John Woo, among others and he directed his first feature film when he was 80!\n\nBen lived and died under his own terms. Success and failure didn’t matter much to him. What was important was integrity, curiosity, and most of all honesty. We often thought of him as the most interesting man in the world, like the beer ad on TV. Women wanted to be with him (boy, did they ever!), but so did men. It was fun being around him. He was the least full of shit person we ever knew.\n\nSo, although we are sad Ben is no longer here, we appreciate the time we spent together, the wisdom and fun he shared with everyone lucky enough to know him and we celebrate his life.\n\nL’Chaim!\n\nWe would also like to express our deepest gratitude to the people who watched over and took care of our friend Ben in his final days — Chloé Reisen, Ava Farber and particularly Lukas Cermak and his wife Zuzana. We will forever be in your debt."
