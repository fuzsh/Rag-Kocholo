        "text": "So a relatively short post here today, mainly just to share a couple of thoughts I had. I was at my usual haunt last night – the BFI Southbank (some of you who read these posts might be detecting a running theme!) – seeing Chilean director Alexandro Jodorowsky’s midnight movie classic – the ultraviolet surrealist western El Topo (1970) currently showing as part of the BFI’s Punk Cinema season and in which a black leatherclad Gunslinger and (initially) his son (or so we are led to believe) cross a bleak, unforgiving (frequently Beckettian) landscape in search of enlightenment, four extrovert gunfighters and their ‘Colonel’ in order to avenge the bloody massacre of a Mexican village. This constitutes roughly the first third of the film and it was at the end of this section the distinct similarities between Jodorowsky’s film and AMC’s mega hit The Walking Dead (TWD) began to strike me.\n\nOk, so TWD is a modern tv drama about the human fallout of a zombie apocalypse rooted in the comic book tradition and far from the high art/modernist/countrtcultural/avant garde traditions that are the foundations of Jodorowsky’s film; El Topo is a film that defies easy categorisation : exploitation, high art, a genre film – western, horror, surrealism, part samurai film, slapstick comedy, religious drama in which its director happily crams in old and New Testament Christianity, Buddhism and Taoism, pagan worship and Nietschiean philosophy as well as Beckettian and Artaudian existentialism, absurdism and cruelty (to name but a few) .\n\nAt the outset the similarities between the two texts seem minimal, however looking a bit further gives cause to rethink. First of all, let’s consider TWD’s two central characters, ex Sherrif Rick Grimes and his son Carl who travel a desolate wasteland in a picaresque fashion. Carl dons Rick’s wide brimmed Sherrif’s hat and in the wake of the death of his mother must learn to put away childish things. At the start of El Topo The Gunslinger (El Topo – the Mole – in the opening titles we see the mole claws his way to the surface in search of light only to have his eyes burned by it) makes his young son bury his first toy and a picture of the mother in the sand, symbolically burying the images of childhood. Shortly after as they travel through the charnel horror of the village massacre (huge pools of blood, men hanging like meat in a barn, bodies strewn across the ground, disemboweled and decaying animals), The Gunslinger hands his son the gun in order to finish off a dying man, completing both his journey to manhood and the facilitating the ellipses of the narrative which becomes apparent at the end when, after reuniting with his father (who has become akin to a Buddhist monk and who self0immolates in the manner of those monks in Vietnam who set themselves alight in protest) dons the black leather garb from the first half of the film and rides off into the sunset with his father’s woman and baby son in tow. In TWD young Carl Grimes undergoes a similar experience / right of passage in putting down the undead body of his father’s best friend Shane.\n\nIn terms of imagery there is also a striking similarity between Carl and the Gunslinger’s son – they both sport wide brimmed hats and (eventually) don the mantle of the father (literally and metaphorically).\n\nRick is also a gunslinger and, in fact, guns play a vital role in TWD (their obvious role as defense against the undead hordes not withstanding) – they tie the film to range of genre conventions, not least the Western where guns are used to forge a path through a new land and defend frontiers – weapons are part of the identity of individual characters – they denote Rick’s authority as father, law keeper, maker and enforcer and (in the opinion of this writer) tie the show to the somewhat problematic idea that guns can be justified to preserve or create a civilised society ( the uncivilised eschew the use of guns – opting instead to be head or utilise barbed wire covered baseball bats – with the exception of Michonne’s katanas ). Hence TWD, pursues a fairly conservative agenda.\n\nRick is also a grizzled, bearded gunslinger in a desolate blood drenched wasteland, a warrior who travels with son in tow, a son who adopts the identity of the father. While TWD may lack the fevered religion, searched for enlightenment and zen / spirituality of El Topo (in which in one scene towards the end of the film a church congregation worship the gun through a game a Russian Roulette – it’s an object of religious fetishisation),\n\nHowever Rick’s and the Gunslinger’s journey are not dissimilar – despite the casts of exotic characters both remain isolated in the wasted landscape. Both his and the Gunslinger’s personas and their father/son relations ships may also be filtered through the samurai / ronin tradition (samurai swords play a significant role in both texts) and parallels may be made between both and the Babycart mythos. There is no discernable end to their journeys, they are cyclical, destined to be continued by the sons.\n\nSo just to conclude this brief collection of thoughts, if we make the argument that El Topo is an unsung forbear of TWD then can we make the argument that the series exceeds its comic book origins by engaging the traditions of serious art as well as exploitation cinema? It’s also worth noting that towards the end of El Topo when the cripples, dwarves, inbreds and deformed characters are freed from their subterranean prison by the gunslinger (now monk/beggar) they career down the town’s street as horde of undead-like characters (here the film knowingly engages the emergent zombie genre/exploitation cinema of the late 1960s).\n\nAnyway just a few thoughts which I aim to develop.\n\nHere is the link to the BFI Punk Season\n\nhttp://www.bfi.org.uk/punk\n\nSummer 2016 really does appear to be the Summer of Stan. In May, Leicester De Montfort University held a major international conference and retrospective exhibition (containing props and production items from A Clockwork Orange, The Shining -the famous notebooks on display as well as Jack’s dressing gown!, Eyes Wide Shut and Full Metal Jacket – all borrowed from the Kubrick Archive (University of the Arts, Elephant, London) around Kubrick’s work, organised by Professor Ian Hunter and PhD candidate James Fenwick. Here were gathered some of the world’s leading academics in the field of Kubrick studies and a great number of new and brilliant writers and researchers cutting new critical paths of understanding through Kubrick’s cinema (what’s the collective noun for a group of Kubrick scholars? answers on a postcard or in the comment box below..)\n\nIn attendance was none other than Jan Harlan, Kubrick’s brother in law and producer who had worked closely with the man since The Shining in 1980 right up to Kubrick’s death and who continues to act as custodian to Kubrick’s legacy. Those in attendance were privileged witnesses to Harlan breaking the news that Kubrick’s abandoned passion project Napoleon is finally being made in the form of a HBO TV series. How this might work remains to be seen, as too will how much of it will cleave to Kubrick’s own vision for the project but it’ll be interesting to see. During this keynote speech Jan Harlan suggested that had Kubrick survived into the 21st century (he passed through the starfield and into the infinite in 1999, a few days after completing Eyes Wide Shut) then he would have gravitated towards the medium of television drama anyway, something he already had a keen interest in and a space he was keen to experiment with. It’s fascinating to think what Kubrick would have made of the renaissance in global TV drama and the ever close bond, the increasingly shared space, of film and TV and what his contribution to the evolving form of TV drama would have been\n\nAnother major retrospective, Stanley Kubrick, The Exhbition (http://www.stanleykubrick.de/en/ausstellungstour-exhibition-on-tour/) is currently coming to the end of a world tour (which has sadly excluded the UK) at the Contemporary Jewish Museum in San Francisco, while here in the UK, the exhibition Daydreaming with Stanley Kubrick (https://www.somersethouse.org.uk/visual-arts/daydreaming-with-stanley-kubrick #Dreamkubrick) comes to an end on August 24th (I will discuss it in more detail in another post). As part of their outdoor screening season, Somerset House are showing a surprise Kubrick film (voted for by the public) to be revealed on the night .\n\nKubrick at the BFI\n\nIn the meantime there has been a magnificent digital restoration and nationwide re-release of Kubrick’s most verdant film, Barry Lyndon (1975). I caught the opening night, at the end of July, at the BFI Southbank (where it is currently playing) and upon approaching the box office to collect my ticket it suddenly struck me that the National Film Theatre, set amid the concrete brutalist architecture of London’s Southbank, with the cavernous space of its entrance hall; the vastness of the NFT1 with it’s red velvet decour; its minimalism and functionality, is the perfect place to watch Kubrick as it IS a Kubrickian space: a cinematic space perfectly designed for and built around the showing of films, a cathedral to the moving image.\n\n(photos from BFI Website)\n\nKubrick’s films obsess around the functionality of space and the relationship between man and the architectural structures (physical, political, social, sexual) he creates for himself: The emptiness of the Overlook Hotel in The Shining with it’s impossible interior architecture, deserted, haunted corridors – an architectural manifestation of Jack’s mind which Wendy and Danny must navigate and escape; the imposing brutalist architecture of the Ludovico institute in Clockwork Orange, where Alex is given his ‘treatment’ and it’s coding of state power and authority ; the circularity (another theme of Kubrick’s films) of the war room in Strangelove (‘You can’t fight in here – this is the war room!’) where the US president, the military and the Russians futilely go round in circles; the palatial opulence, grandiosity and decadence of Ziegler’s house in Eyes Wide Shut – a monument to greed, self-entitlement and arrogance; the spaceship in 2001.\n\nWatching Barry Lyndon in NFT1 is a fascinating experience as here is a film that eschews the visual minimalism of Kubrick’s other films (it was made between A Clockwork Orange (1971) and The Shining (1980) – which seem apposite to this particular cinema – in favor of naturally lit images of the 18th century English landscape composed as if from the brush of Constable or Gainsborough; interior images of Hogarthian excess and leisure.\n\n(Yahoo Images)\n\nI find Lyndon fascinating as Kubrick is not just adapting Thackery’s novel but also adapting the visual style of 18th century British art. He recognises this artistic milieu as an inherently cinematic form before the existence of cinema, and more than this, there are clear sympathies between this style of are and Kubrick’s own visual style. In viewing a painting by Constable, for instance, are eyes are drawn to the anonymous isloated, miniature, characters within the naturally lit spacious panoramas of the English landscape. As viewers we are invited to imagine their stories. These are also images where space and architecture play an important role and embedded within are denoted comments upon the political and social structures of the time (Salisbury Cathedral From the Meadows, 1831, for instance, comments on the relationship between church and state and their power over the agrarian industry of England as the manor houses and cathedral, set next two each other and brought into proximity under the rainbow – a blessed union – tower over the landworker and peasantry in the foreground).\n\nFamously Hogarth’s satirical, moralistic and socially observant engravings (Marriage A La Mode, 1745 is something of an influence on Barry Lyndon), expose a narrative over a series of frames – a clear progenitor of cinematic story telling.\n\nSitting in the auditorium of NFT1 watching the film I was struck by the climactic duel in the barn (a real barn in Glastonbury which is available to visit) – yet again another example of man made structure in Kubrick’s work – a huge cathedral like (gothic) space within which the characters are dwarfed – and I could not help but draw parallels in my mind between the architecture of the space on screen and the experience of sitting, watching the film, within such a cavernous space of light and image.\n\n(Yahoo Images)\n\nStanley Kubrick, Cinephile\n\nDuring August and September the BFI Southbank will be showing both Paths of Glory (1957) and Spartacus (1960) as part of the upcoming Kirk Douglas Season as well as a dedicated mini Kubrick season, Stanley Kubrick, Cinephile in which 6 of the films (A Clockwork Orange, Dr Strangelove, 2001: A Space Odyssey, Eyes Wide Shut, The Shining and Full Metal Jacket) will be screened alongside a body of films admired by and influential on Kubrick – The Godfather, La Belle et La Bete, Rashomon, Bridge on the River Kwai, 8 1/2 to name a few. It’s an interesting idea and one which I think could also be used with other director retrospectives (imagine a a similar approach taken to a Martin Scorsese season or the recent Spielberg season – where undoubtedly some of Kubrick’s own work would have appeared too).\n\nConclusion: Why Kubrick?\n\nSo why the spike in interest in Kubrick’s work? Well in part, the director would have turned 88 on July 25th but much more than that Kubrick’s work provides a way in to so much of what we see in both film and television today (lets face it, interest in Kubrick’s cinema has never really diminished) . His visual and architectural style and tropes: the slow track or dolly, the reverse zoom, the dwarfing and isolating sense of scale have become (consciously or unconsciously) part of the lexicon or vernacular of (post) modern post millenial visual culture. The current exhibition at Somerset House Daydreaming with Stanley Kubrick, curated by James Lavelle from UNKLE, is testament to the impact Kubrick has had on the visual arts (not just cinema) and will be discussed in a later blogpost / article.\n\nKubrick has a distinct presence in modern visual culture – we may call it a ‘Post Kubrick’culture (Stephen Spielberg’s work shares a lot of the spatial concerns of Kubrick’s cinema – this is particularly evident in his post 2000 work. I am currently working on a project looking at both Kubrick’s plans for A.I Artificial Intelligence vs Spielberg’s version). In a society obsessed with space and the legitimacy of space (online, physical, social) and it’s organisation and in which, by virtue of social media, the internet etc, we are ever more connected yet are becoming increasingly distant from each other Kubrick’s cinema only increases in relevance. In Kubrick’s films humanity is reduced within the cavernous spaces it builds for itself. In a coming blog post I will be exploring the nature of the ‘post-Kubrickian’ (as will a comparative discussion of both Kubrick and his contemporary, Ken Russell).\n\nNicholas Winding-Refn’s recent masterpiece The Neon Demon contained more Kubrickian shots and shot composition than an average Kubrick film; there are constant visual references to Kubrick’s work in the recent Amazon online TV drama Mr Robot; the recent series American Horror Story: Hotel has clear homages to Kubrick, so too in Alejandro Innaritu’s dystopian 2015 film Birdman, a film over which Kubrick looms large as the steady-cam roves the isolated backstage corridors and architecture of a Broadway theatre a la The Shining, and the main character (played by Michael Keaton) becomes increasingly withdrawn isolated from those around him. Below are a selection of comparative images between Birdman and Eyes Wide Shut. Note the ‘Kubrick stare’ on Keaton’s face; the use of lighting and mise en scene in the Jazz bar scene in EWS, the newspaper stand sequence and the image from Innaritu’s film.\n\nI also recently noticed the following meme posted by Nick Fugazzy on the Stanley Kubrick Appreciation Society Facebook page (https://www.facebook.com/groups/TSKAS/):\n\n(A Trump Rally in Dallas – Kubrickian space. Trump himself, in person, is dwarved by the space but his presence and image dominates the crowd via the screen image above them – he and the architecture of the arena become one)\n\nKubrick’s work has only become more politically and socially prescient. In a world in which architecture is becoming more spacious and socially determined and in which we are increasingly isolated from each other, Kubrick’s work makes us re-assess our relationship with and proximity to those around us."
