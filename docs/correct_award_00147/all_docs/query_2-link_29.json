        "text": "(1914–98). The Mexican poet and diplomat Octavio Paz became one of the chief literary figures of the Western Hemisphere in the years after World War II. In addition to his volumes of poetry, he published philosophical essays and literary criticism.\n\nPaz was born in Mexico City to a Spanish mother and a Mexican father on March 31, 1914. The family had been ruined financially by the Mexican Revolution. After attending a Roman Catholic school he went to the University of Mexico. While at the university he published his first book of poetry, Forest Moon, in 1933. On a visit to Spain in 1937, he wrote Beneath Your Clear Shadow and Other Poems, which showed him to be a poet of great promise. Later publications include The Sun Stone (1957), The Violent Condition (1958), East Slope (1971), and Sister Juana Inés of the Cross, or the Cheaters of the Faith (1982).\n\nFrom 1962 until 1968 Paz served as Mexico’s ambassador to India. He resigned in protest over his country’s brutal treatment of student rebels in 1968. He then taught briefly at Cambridge University in England and at Harvard University in the United States. Among his prose works are Conjunctions and Disjunctions (1969) and The Other Mexico (1972), which explains his reasons for resigning the ambassadorship. In 1990 Paz won the Nobel prize for literature, becoming the first Mexican writer to do so. He died in Mexico City on April 19, 1998."
