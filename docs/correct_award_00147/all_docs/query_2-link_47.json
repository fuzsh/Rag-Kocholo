        "text": "January 21, 2024\n\nThis was my first time reading Octavio Paz, and some pages into the poems I knew it wouldn't be my last. If I have any say about it, at least. I began reading these poems as a return to a tradition I put to myself, marking the end of a year and opening a new one reading poetry.\n\nSo, 65 years worth of poetry selected and collected in this edition. The first poem was published when the writer was seventeen; the last poem when he was eighty two, just two years before his death, and I think this collection is an adequate representation of his work.\n\nFrom the earlier of poems, throughout his writing, and to the later poems, Paz was fixated on the same subjects: nature, time, life, spirituality (meaning the curious and exploratory seeking and openness to possibilities, rather than the narrow and rigid set-in-stone dogmas), language, sensuality, and people. I've decided to include a few poems that I think encapsulate the feeling and essence of the poetry, as I believe his words speak more for and of his work than anyone else's can.\n\nAmong his earlier poems, this one named “Garden”:\n\nClouds adrift, sleepwalking continents,\n\nnations with no substance, no weight,\n\ngeographies drawn by the sun\n\nand erased by the wind.\n\nFour walls of adobe. Bougainvillea:\n\nmy eyes bathe in its peaceful flames.\n\nThe wind moves through leaves of\n\nexaltation\n\nand bended knees of grass.\n\nThe heliotrope with purple steps\n\ncrosses over, enveloped in its aroma.\n\nThere is a prophet: the ash tree,\n\nand a contemplative: the pine.\n\nThe garden is small, the sky immense.\n\nLush survivor amid my rubble:\n\nin my eyes you see yourself, touch yourself,\n\nknow yourself in me and in me think of\n\nyourself,\n\nin me you last and in me you vanish.\n\nOn sensuality, this poem named “Two Bodies”:\n\nTwo Bodies face to face\n\nare at times two waves\n\nand night is the ocean.\n\nTwo bodies face to face\n\nare at times two stones\n\nand night the desert.\n\nTwo bodies face to face\n\nare at times roots\n\nin the night entangled.\n\nTwo bodies face to face\n\nare at times knives\n\nand the night lightning.\n\nTwo bodies face to face\n\nare two stars that fall\n\nin an empty sky.\n\nTogether with this poem “Wind, Water, Stone” expressing, even in translation, the euphony in Paz’s poetry:\n\nWater hollows stone,\n\nwind scatters water,\n\nstone stops the wind.\n\nWater, wind, stone.\n\nWind carves stone,\n\nstone’s a cup of water,\n\nwater escapes and is wind.\n\nStone, wind, water.\n\nWind sings in its whirling,\n\nwater murmurs going by,\n\nunmoving stone keeps still.\n\nWind, water, stone.\n\nEach is another and no other:\n\nthey go by and vanish\n\nin their empty names:\n\nwater, stone, wind.\n\nOf life, from “Response and Reconciliation”, Paz’s last published poem:\n\nAh life! Does no one answer?\n\nHis words rolled, bolts of lightning\n\netched\n\nin years that were boulders and now are mist.\n\nLife never answers.\n\nIt has no ears and doesn’t hear us;\n\nit doesn’t speak, it has no tongue.\n\nIt neither goes nor stays:\n\nwe are the ones who speak,\n\nthe ones who go,\n\nwhile we hear from echo to echo, year to\n\nyear,\n\nour words rolling through a tunnel with\n\nno end.\n\nThat which we call life\n\nhears itself within us, speaks with our\n\ntongues,\n\nand through us, knows itself.\n\nAs we portray it, we become its mirror,\n\nwe invent it.\n\nAn invention of an invention: it creates\n\nus\n\nwithout knowing what it has created,\n\nwe are an accident that thinks.\n\nIt is a creature of reflections\n\nwe create by thinking,\n\nand it hurls itself into fictitious abysses.\n\nThe depths, the transparencies\n\nwhere it floats or sinks: not life, but its\n\nidea.\n\nIt is always on the other side and is\n\nalways other,\n\nhas a thousand bodies and none,\n\nnever moves and never stops,\n\nit is born to die, and is born at death.\n\nFinally, of reconciliation with death and existence, the universe and the unknown, from the third part of the same poem:\n\nAnd while I say what I say\n\ntime and space fall dizzyingly,\n\nrestlessly. They fall in themselves.\n\nMan and the galaxy return to silence.\n\nDoes it matter? Yes—but it doesn’t\n\nmatter:\n\nwe know that silence is music and that\n\nwe are a chord in this concert.\n\nI'll stop here as there are too many poems I'd like to share, some too long, like the wondrous “The City” (which Paz dedicated to the translator of this collection, Eliot Weinberger) which refuses to be splintered and shared in bits, but which I highly recommend reading as a whole.\n\nWistfulness suffuse these poems, the self dissolves as Paz opens himself to himself and all else around him. It is a remarkable achievement, this work; the words, in their music and longing, imprint themselves on the reader long after reading. Octavio Paz in an interview stated, “The poem is a response to an ancient question and a reconciliation with our earthly fate.” And if there are poems that prove this statement right, Paz’s are surely placed at the very top.\n\nNovember 12, 2015\n\nI was blown away and I fell in love!\n\nThe poetry was rich and caressed my heart!\n\nAugust 1, 2020\n\nBeautifully written poetry. The way Paz physically structures his poems adds so much to my understanding and the rhythm of them. Even in translation, the way his words flow is moving. The extended metaphors mixed with historical allusions and calls back to mythology. It's very difficult to review poetry because of how much emotion is involved. Suffice to say this- I read through this entire book only at night, and I blasted Ludovico Einaudi the entire time because I was so deep in my feelings.\n\nNovember 28, 2015\n\nMy high school IB history teacher was extremely passionate about history, so much that he would give out extra packages of notes on various events and figures associated with the time period we were studying that we most likely didn’t need to know. I remember Octavio Paz figuring in one of them, and remember hearing our teacher praise him as a poet all of us should read at least once in our lives. When my university professor spent half a class talking about Paz and how he related to Mexican history, talking as well about his father, the famous diplomat, and other figures like Pancho Villa and Madeiro, I was the only one in class who knew who and what he was talking about. I was extremely glad to finally be giving Paz’s work a read, and hoped I would be as impressed as my history teacher promise.\n\nAnd indeed I was. Although I had to read large, though still selective, chunks of poems from the book, I felt I got a good sense of where Paz was coming from, how he wrote, and what he focused on. There is an incredibly soothing feeling to his poems, even when they take a turn for the bittersweet and sometimes even terrifying. He really is a word master. The stars, sun, and moon always find their way into his poems, as well as the irresistibly romantic and sensual way in which he talks about women. “A Tale of Two Gardens” was particularly worth mentioning in that regard. Sometimes the thread of thought got lost behind the beautiful writing, while at other times the mass of references would become slightly overbearing due to lack of knowledge, but even in these cases, a couple extra reads always helped. Even if I still didn’t understand everything Paz was referring to or talking about, the melodic hum of his words got to me every time.\n\nPaz deserves all the praise he gets, and is worth studying today, tomorrow, and for years to come. There is a timeless quality to his work, as well as strong, focus referrals to historical events and various figures, both real and not. This collection works well as both an introduction to his work as well as serving as a general collection to a reader who is familiar with the work already. I will probably be referring to this specific version again in the future when I’ll be revisiting Paz’s work.\n\nRead\n\nDecember 15, 2016\n\nFavorite:\n\nPiedras sueltas\n\n1\n\nFlor\n\nEl grito, el pico, el diente, los aullidos,\n\nla nada carnicera y su barullo,\n\nante esta simple flor se desvanecen.\n\n2\n\nDama\n\nTodas las noches baja al pozo\n\ny a la mañana reaparece\n\ncon un nuevo reptil entre los brazos.\n\n3\n\nBiografía\n\nNo lo que pudo ser:\n\nes lo que fue.\n\nY lo que fue, está muerto.\n\n4\n\nCampanas en la noche\n\nOlas de sombra\n\nmojan mi pensamiento\n\n-y no lo apagan.\n\n5\n\nAnte la puerta\n\nGentes, palabras, gentes.\n\nDudé un instante:\n\nla luna arriba, sola.\n\n6\n\nVisión\n\nMe vi cerrar los ojos;\n\nespacio, espacio\n\ndonde estoy y no estoy.\n\n7\n\nPaisaje\n\nLos insectos atareados,\n\nlos caballos color de sol,\n\nlos burros color de nube,\n\nlas nubes, rocas enormes que no pesan,\n\nlos montes como cielos desplomados,\n\nla manada de árboles bebiendo en el arroyo,\n\ntodos están ahí, dichosos en su estar,\n\nfrente a nosotros que no estamos,\n\ncomidos por la rabia, por el odio,\n\npor el amor comidos, por la muerte.\n\n8\n\nAnalfabeto\n\nAlcé la cara al cielo,\n\nInmensa piedra de gastadas letras:\n\nNada me revelaron las estrellas.\n\nJanuary 19, 2020\n\n\"Life never answers.\n\nIt has no ears and doesn’t hear us;\n\nit doesn’t speak, it has no tongue.\n\nIt neither goes nor stays:\n\nwe are the ones who speak,\n\nthe ones who go,\n\nwhile we hear from echo to echo, year to year,\n\nour words rolling through a tunnel with no end.\"\n\n-- from “Response and Reconciliation”\n\n\"The night insists,\n\nthe night touches my forehead,\n\ntouches my thoughts.\n\nWhat does it want ?\"\n\n-- from “San Ildefonso nocturne”\n\n\"I am in a room abandoned by language\n\nYou are in another identical room\n\nOr we both are\n\non a street your glance has depopulated\n\nThe world\n\nimperceptibly comes apart\n\nMemory\n\ndecayed beneath our feet\n\nI am stopped in the middle of this\n\nunwritten line.\"\n\n-- from “Trowbridge Street”\n\n\"My words watch me from the puddle\n\nof my memory.\"\n\n-- from “A draft of shadows”\n\nAugust 22, 2019\n\nMy God, this collection is unreal. Some of the most exquisite, erotic, miraculous verses I've ever read. Don't let the size deter you.

Fucking poetry! <3\n\n“If a poem hasn't ripped apart your soul; you haven't experienced poetry.”\n\nEdgar Allan Poe\n\nJanuary 13, 2021\n\nThis is a review on the translation, not Paz’s poetry (which is often incredible, in its original language).\n\nBeing fluent in Spanish, I am disappointed by the choices made by the various translators included in this edition. Blatant errors in pronoun translations, incorrectly translated metaphors that exist in both languages (which makes this worse)... in short, if these are the best translations we have of Octavio Paz’s poetry, we need to hurry back to the drawing board. This is unacceptable.\n\nImagine someone translating “the pen is mightier than the sword” to “la pluma es mad poderosa que la espada,” and then that being translated back to English as “the feather is more powerful than the sword.”\n\nThe “powerful” is acceptable; the “feather” is downright ridiculous. And yet, that is what you will find here.\n\nPoetry is not like a memoir; it must be very thoughtfully translated, or not at all.\n\nJuly 30, 2017\n\nAbsolutey brilliant. Octavio Paz is one the great poets of the twentieth century, in any language. He even comes close to Neruda, if that's possible. Few poets have written more beautiful verses about time. His images and metaphors leave me in stunning bewilderment.\n\nFebruary 20, 2019\n\nSimply stunning, moving, exquisite. When a friend first told me of Paz'z diverse background, I was doubtful of how well poetry could be woven in. But then he bought me a book of Paz'z poems as a gift. His imagery and diction makes one wish for literary level Spanish speaking skills.\n\nDecember 21, 2020\n\nknocked off a star for a bit of repetitiveness but overall these were extraordinary and some quite literally left me breathless\n\nMarch 31, 2024\n\n\"…what memories, what imprisoned desires\n\nignite the…flames in your skin?\"\n\nsublime, transcendental & perfect.\n\nFebruary 3, 2019\n\nIt is testament to the small world that the poet inhabited that the translator of this work actually has a poem dedicated to him. I do not think that everyone will appreciate a book like this one, with almost six hundred pages of poems, some of them quite experimental in their design and their use of white space and in the way that they could be put together, but as someone who is fond of reading poetry it is clear that the poetry here makes it easy to understand why it was that Octavio Paz won the Nobel Prize for literature. As a poet, the author shares some clear ideological commitments that make him an obvious choice for awards ceremonies like this one, and even as someone who does not share the various commitments of the poet, there is still a lot to appreciate here. If I have read some poets I enjoy more, I have read a great many I enjoy less. If that seems tepid praise for a book I really enjoyed reading, it is because what I found to be most inspirational and enjoyable about this book is not something that I think will be conveyed to all readers.\n\nIn terms of its scope, this book is truly a large one. Many \"best of\" books end up being very short, but this one gives full scope to the immensity of the author's poetic output. The poems included here were written over a span of about six decades or so. We begin with a few poems which are appropriately called \"First Poems\" from 1931-1940 that introduce the author's concern with identity, night, games, creation, and death, for example. After that comes a few poems written from 1941 to 1948 that include the moving and dark \"Epitaph For A Poet\" which points at the dishonesty of much poetic enterprise, the author's included. Then there follows selections from Eagle Or Sun from 1949 to 1950 that look to the author's own Mexican context as a source of inspiration. Selections from four volumes of poetry from 1948 to 1957 demonstrate the author's interest in stones and ruins as well as the sensuality of woman to this most sensual of poets, culminating in the lengthy poem \"Sunstone\" from the book of that title. From this point onward the poems become increasingly experimental in nature, some of them short and equivocal, some of them possible of being rearranged in many fashions, and a great many of them (especially from \"East Slope\") examining Eastern thought and religion and contemporary society's interest in the East.\n\nOver and over again in these poems the poet returns to a familiar set of narrow concerns. Of particular interest to me as a reader was the way that the author seems to have had an immense fear of imprisonment. Why is this the case? Did the poet feel that his creative spirit was imprisoned in a physical body of considerable limitations? Did he feel that his political views threatened him with imprisonment in corrupt and dictatorial regimes (by no means an unreasonable fear for many poets and other creative people)? Did he feel that his own cultural and personal background was a sort of prison? It is hard to say for sure, but the author returned over and over again to the issue of imprisonment, including imprisonment in a castle, to allow the reader to see how the fear and reality of imprisonment and confinement shaped his poetic sense and his longing for some sort of freedom. Whether or not one agrees with the author's approach--and I do not agree with all of it myself, this work does demonstrate both the consistency as well as the variety of the poet's art over the course of a long and productive life of creation.\n\nMarch 10, 2024\n\nUnveiling Octavio Paz: A Review of \"The Poems of Octavio Paz\"\n\n\"The Poems of Octavio Paz,\" edited and translated by Eliot Weinberger, is a comprehensive collection showcasing the vast and profound work of Nobel Prize-winning Mexican poet Octavio Paz. This hefty volume, spanning Paz's entire career, offers a captivating exploration of love, solitude, history, and the human condition.\n\nPaz's poems delve into a rich tapestry of themes. He explores the complexities of love and desire, often with a sensual and surrealist touch. Loneliness and solitude are also recurring motifs, reflecting Paz's philosophical contemplations on existence.\n\nThe collection further showcases Paz's engagement with history and politics. He grapples with Mexico's identity and the legacy of colonialism, while also weaving in universal themes of oppression and freedom.\n\nThe success of this collection hinges on Eliot Weinberger's masterful translations. He captures the essence of Paz's imagery and metaphors, ensuring the poems resonate with English-speaking readers.\n\n\"The Poems of Octavio Paz\" is a monumental work and a must-read for anyone interested in 20th-century poetry and Latin American literature. Paz's masterful use of language, exploration of profound themes, and engagement with history make this collection a rewarding journey. However, the extensive volume and complexity might be better suited for dedicated poetry readers or those with some prior knowledge of Paz's work.\n\nSeptember 10, 2017\n\nPoems full of language that sings and that nudges perception out of its daily rounds. Here is a part of a favorite.\n\nÓyeme como quien oye llover,\n\nni atenta ni distraída,\n\npasos leves, llovizna,\n\nagua que es aire, aire que es tiempo\n\nel día no acaba de irse,\n\nla noche no llega todavía,\n\nfiguraciones de la niebla\n\nal doblar la esquina,\n\nfiguraciones del tiempo\n\nen el recodo de esta pausa,\n\nóyeme como quien oye llover,\n\nsin oírme, oyendo lo que digo\n\ncon los ojos abiertos hacia adentro,\n\ndormida con los cinco sentidos despiertos,\n\nllueve, pasos leves, rumor de sílabas,\n\naire y agua, palabras que no pesan:\n\nlo que fuimos y somos,\n\nlos días y los años, este instante,\n\ntiempo sin peso, pesadumbre enorme,\n\nListen to me as one listens to the rain,\n\nnot attentive, not distracted,\n\nlight footsteps, thin drizzle,\n\nwater that is air, air that is time,\n\nthe day is still leaving,\n\nthe night has yet to arrive,\n\nfigurations of mist\n\nat the turn of the corner,\n\nfigurations of time\n\nat the bend in this pause,\n\nlisten to me as one listens to the rain,\n\nwithout listening, hear what I say\n\nwith eyes open inward, asleep\n\nwith all five senses awake,\n\nit's raining, light footsteps, a murmur of syllables,\n\nair and water, words with no weight:\n\nwhat we are and are,\n\nthe days and years, this moment,\n\nweightless time and heavy sorrow,\n\nJuly 23, 2019\n\nOctavio Paz was born in Mexico City on March 31, 1914, the same city where he died in 1998, at age eighty-four. Starting to publish his first poems while still a teenager he was quickly recognised and his great success culminated in his receiving the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1990.\n\nThe book 'The Poems of Octavio Paz' assembles his most important poems from his early to his last years. The poems reflect his travels, his life, his love for nature and people, but ever so often is just a shadow of time, a diving into a ephemeral moment where you are here, but also there, not yet left, but already arrived, walking without moving. Paz' writing is brilliant, colourful, rich, a firework of emotions.\n\nOctavio Paz is one of my favourite poets, his poems feed my soul.\n\nMay 18, 2019\n\nNever read Paz before this but this collections seems to be a good introduction to his works. Lots of the poems have a mysterious and eerie tone yet one feels they understand what is being said, even if the words don't make sense.\n\nFebruary 13, 2021\n\nPor alguna razón me gusta más cómo se leen sus poemas en inglés.\n\nMis favoritos en español:\n\nOtoño\n\nUn día se pierde\n\nEl mismo tiempo\n\nEscritura\n\nDecir: hacer\n\nUn viento llamado Bob Rauschenberg\n\nComo quien oye llover\n\nCarta de creencia\n\nApril 2, 2023\n\nWow...the poems of Ocavio Paz are electrically beautiful.\n\nI did not have time to finish this collection...it is overdue and I have to bring it back to the library...but what I was able to read was some of the most beautiful poetry I've ever read."
