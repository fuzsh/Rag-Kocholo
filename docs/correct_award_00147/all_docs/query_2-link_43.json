        "text": "Mexico is living a time of joy. The country is celebrating the centennial of Octavio Paz’s birthday today. To commemorate the event, the government, politicians and intellectuals are organizing special events, including book presentations of his work, a postal stamp and lottery ticket with his likeness, a grand intellectual summit (“Octavio Paz and the World of the XXI Century”), public readings of his poems in the main plaza outside the Senate building, and free distribution of an anthology of his work to middle school students.\n\nWhy is Mexico devoting so much effort and economic resources to celebrate the birth of a poet? Why is Paz able to create such an excitement and consensus behind his name?\n\nIn a monotheistic Mexico, Paz is a cultural god. In the church of Mexican intellectual life, Paz stands at the top of the hierarchy. Of course, there are saints like Enrique Krauze, Carlos Fuentes, Carlos Monsiváis and others, but Paz does not have equals. In Mexico, people worship his name and work without even having read his poems, essays and books. When Paz died in 1998, thousands gathered outside the Palace of Fine Arts in Mexico City to pay tribute to their national deity.\n\nSeveral reasons explain why Paz still commands the respect and admiration of the country. First, he was able to convey in his writing important aspects of the life and culture of Mexico. Second, he was a truly Mexican transnational intellectual, a thinker who transcended localism, navigating the world to understand the character of the Mexican. Third, he was a pluralist in what was, in his lifetime, an authoritarian country. Fourth, he produced exquisite culture in a poorly educated country. And, finally, he was a courageous man who condemned abuses of authority when denunciation was often repressed by the government. For this and much more, Paz is not only respected but venerated.\n\nPaz is an intellectual who is highly functional for the Mexican government. His Nobel Prize in Literature in 1990, an expression of his worldwide reputation as a poet and thinker, make him an exquisite export product. In a country immersed in problems of violence, security, poverty and drug trafficking, Paz emerges as the other Mexico, the one to be admired. He is not the Mexico of violence but of beautiful poems, not of drugs but of deep reflections, not of corruption but of independent thinking. In the current historical context, celebrating Paz is not only a duty but also a political imperative.\n\nThe work of Paz is not only relevant for contemporary Mexico but also for the United States and the rest of the world. In his ambition to understand Mexico, Paz became a keen observer of American culture and politics. For Paz, the U.S. is a future-oriented society — but one whose founding principles of freedom and equality are in permanent conflict. The contradiction is manifested, Paz believed, in the tendency to ignore non-dominant ethnic groups in American society, “foreign bodies within American culture.”\n\nFor Paz, the old-school pachuco-style immigrant to the U.S., with his flamboyant zoot suits and fedoras, is one of these foreign bodies. The pachuco is isolated — not a Mexican or an American. The pachuco lives in a permanent contradiction, rejecting Mexico yet refusing to blend into America. He has a hard time adapting to a society that rejects him.\n\nOctavio Paz, as Enrique Krauze once expressed, was a poet, a lover of words. This universal man represents the best of Mexico, and Mexico is happy to celebrate the centennial of his birth. In modern times, Mexico needs not only to celebrate but also to scrutinize the words of Paz. Quite probably, we will find clues in his words that will help us understand these Mexican Cloudy Times.\n\nJesus Velasco is a specialist in U.S.-Mexican relations at Tarleton State University and may be contacted at gvelasco@tarleton.edu."
