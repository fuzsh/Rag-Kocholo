        "text": "By SHEILA RULE\n\nSTOCKHOLM -- Octavio Paz, a writer of vivid surrealistic verse and penetrating social essays, won the Nobel Prize in Literature today, becoming the first Mexican writer to win literature's highest award.\n\nOctavio Paz, a writer of vivid surrealistic verse and penetrating social essays, won the Nobel Prize in Literature today, becoming the first Mexican writer to win literature's highest award.\n\nThe Swedish Academy of Letters said in its formal announcement that Mr. Paz had won the award ''for impassioned writing with wide horizons, characterized by sensuous intelligence and humanistic integrity.''\n\nThe academy said Mr. Paz's poetry consisted ''to a very great extent of writing both with and about words'' and that in his ''surrealistically inspired thought, the words are endowed in this way with new, changeable and richer meanings.'' The academy quoted a 1976 poem in which Mr. Paz was seen as articulating his literary stance:\n\nBetween what I see and what I say\n\nBetween what I say and what I keep silent\n\nBetween what I keep silent and what I dream\n\nBetween what I dream and what I forget:\n\nPoetry\n\nThe 76-year-old Mr. Paz, an influential political commentator often attacked by Marxists and nationalists, is probably best known for his many essays. In one major work, ''The Labyrinth of Solitude,'' published in 1950, he offered an analysis of modern Mexico and the Mexican personality in which he described his fellow countrymen as instinctive nihilists who hide behind masks of solitude and ceremoniousness.\n\nPublished as Teen-Ager\n\nMr. Paz published his first collection of poetry while a teen-ager. Still active as a writer and critic, he has founded and edited several magazines and has been publishing a literary monthly called Vuelta, which means return, since 1976. He also served as Mexico's Ambassador to France, Switzerland, Japan and India before resigning from the diplomatic service in 1968 after the Mexico City police fired at young demonstrators protesting Government repression of student activists and spending on the Mexico Olympics.\n\nDescribing himself as a ''disillusioned leftist,'' Mr. Paz has since the late 1970's led a personal crusade against what he perceives as a threat of Soviet and Cuban intervention in Latin America. He has also devoted himself to writing and lecturing, in particular at Harvard, where he received an honorary doctorate in 1980.\n\nThis year's Nobel Prize carries a cash award of about $700,000. The formal presentation for Nobel laureates from all fields is Dec. 10. Mr. Paz, whose distinctive verse has broad appeal and has been well received by critics internationally, has long been mentioned by Swedish publishers and cultural editors as a front-runner for the award. Prof. Sture Allen, who is the secretary of the Swedish Academy and who announced the selection of Mr. Paz, said that the poet had been a finalist for several years. 5 Finalists Out of 150 Writers A total of 150 writers were nominated this year, Mr. Allen said, and five were finalists. In keeping with the academy's tradition of secrecy, he declined to identify the others. But members of literary circles here said that perennial candidates included Carlos Fuentes, another Mexican writer; Nadine Gordimer, the South African writer; V. S. Naipaul, the novelist, who was born in Trinidad and lives in Britain; Milan Kundera, the Czechoslovak novelist; Max Frisch, the Swiss playwright, and Mario Vargas Llosa, the Peruvian writer.\n\nThe academy, an assembly of Swedish authors and academics, selects Nobel winners by consensus. This year's decision by the academy, some of whose past choices have been criticized as obscure, was greeted with enthusiasm by publishers and literary critics who gathered to hear the announcement in a room of the academy in the Stock Exchange building in the Old Town.\n\nMr. Allen said that the selection of Mr. Paz fit the academy's pattern of trying to encompass varying styles, languages and cultures with the award but that the will of Alfred Nobel, who established the prize, stipulated that the award should be ''given to the best writers, irrespective of whether they are Scandinavian, Mexican, Nigerian or Australian.'' Several Latin American writers have won the prize, the most recent being Gabriel Garcia Marquez, the Colombian writer who won in 1982. Last year's prize went to a Spanish-language writer, Camilo Jose Cela.\n\nSome members of Sweden's literary community said they had hoped that a woman would receive this year's award. The last time the prize went to a woman was in 1966, when Nelly Sachs, a writer who was born in Germany and lived in Sweden until her death, shared it with Shmuel Yosef Agnon, an Israeli writer. Asked if the academy was ''macho,'' Mr. Allen said that ''good, prominent female writers'' had been seriously considered and that he hoped a woman would be selected in the near future. He estimated that one-seventh of this year's nominees were women.\n\n'Union of Cultures'\n\nMr. Paz was born in 1914 in Mexico City. His mother was Spanish, from Andalusia, and his father, a lawyer and politician, was Indian and Spanish. The poet, the academy said, ''embodies this union of cultures - it is in his blood.''\n\nMr. Paz's grandfather was a public official with liberal ideals and a novelist who was one of the first to write sympathetically about Mexico's Indian population. Mr. Paz's love of literature flowered in his grandfather's extensive library and it was the poet's father who planted the seeds of the commitment to social reform found in Mr. Paz's writing.\n\nMr. Paz was greatly influenced by the Spanish Civil War, which he witnessed in Madrid. After returning to Mexico in 1938, he became a founder of the journal Taller (Workshop) and exerted strong influence on contemporary literature as one of its contributors. In 1943, he traveled to the United States as a recipient of a Guggenheim award. In 1981, he was awarded the Cervantes Prize, the most important award in the Spanish-speaking world. The following year he received the prestigious Neustadt Prize."
