        "text": "Award\n\n1990 Nobel Prize in LiteratureOctavio Paz LozanoDate\n\n11 October 1990 ( ) (announcement)\n\n10 December 1990\n\n(ceremony)\n\nLocationStockholm, SwedenPresented bySwedish AcademyFirst awarded1901WebsiteOfficial website\n\n← 1989 · Nobel Prize in Literature · 1991 →\n\nThe 1990 Nobel Prize in Literature was awarded to the Mexican poet and essayist Octavio Paz (1914–1998) \"for impassioned writing with wide horizons, characterized by sensuous intelligence and humanistic integrity.\"[1] He is the only recipient of the Nobel Prize in Literature from Mexico.[2][3]\n\nLaureate[edit]\n\nMain article: Octavio Paz\n\nOne of the best known works by Octavio Paz is El laberinto de la soledad (\"The Labyrinth of Solitude\", 1950), a collection of essays in which he analyzes Mexican history and culture. Paz has solely released poetry volumes up to this time including Piedra de Sol (\"Sunstone\", 1957). He started a number of literary publications, such as Vuelta and El hijo pródigo. Marxism, surrealism, existentialism, Buddhism, and Hinduism were just a few of the philosophies that had an impact on him. Love and sexuality were major topics in his later works. His works include the poetry collections Águila o sol? (\"Eagle or Sun?\", 1951), La Estación Violenta (\"The Violent Season\", 1956) and El Arco y la Lira (\"The Bow and The Lyre\", 1956).[4][5]\n\nNominations[edit]\n\nAt the prize announcement in October 1990, Sture Allén permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, revealed that there were 150 candidates for the prize in 1990, 25 of them women.[6] Octavio Paz had been a candidate for the prize throughout the 1980s.[6] Literary circles believed that among the nominees for that year were the perennial candidates such as Carlos Fuentes, another Mexican writer; Nadine Gordimer, a South African writer (awarded the following year); V. S. Naipaul, a Trinidad-born novelist who lives in Britain (awarded in 2001); Milan Kundera, a Czech novelist exiled in France; Max Frisch, a Swiss playwright; and Mario Vargas Llosa, a Peruvian writer (awarded in 2010).[2]\n\nReactions[edit]\n\nOctavio Paz had been expected to receive the award for years.[7] Paz himself said: \"I was surprised because I didn't expect the prize. One or two years ago I knew I was a candidate, but this time, no. I didn't have the slightest idea, so I was doubly surprised.\"[6]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n[edit]"
