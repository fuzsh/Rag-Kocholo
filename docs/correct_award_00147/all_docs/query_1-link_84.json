On his father’s side, his grandfather was a prominent liberal intellectual and one of the first authors to write a novel with an expressly Indian theme. Thanks to his grandfather’s extensive library, Paz came into early contact with literature.\n\nPaz began to write at an early age, and at the age of 23, he travelled to Valencia, Spain, to participate in the Second International Congress of Anti-Fascist Writers. Upon his return to Mexico in 1938, he became one of the founders of the journal, 'Taller' (Workshop), a magazine which signaled the emergence of a new generation of writers in Mexico as well as a new literary sensibility. During his lifetime, besides writing many novels, Paz founded two important magazines dedicated to the arts and politics: 'Plural' (1971-1976) and 'Vuelta' (1976-1998). In 1980, he was named honorary doctor at Harvard. \n\nPaz's poetic corpus is nourished by the belief that poetry constitutes “the secret religion of the modern age.” 30 years ago, Paz was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature \"for impassioned writing with wide horizons, characterized by sensuous intelligence and humanistic integrity\".\n\nWho will be awarded the Literature Prize this year? Find out on 8 October 2020. \n\nPhoto from the Nobel Foundation archive.\n.\n.\n.\n#NobelPrize #Nobel #literature #writer #author #write #read #books #book #poetry #poet #poetry #Mexico\".",
