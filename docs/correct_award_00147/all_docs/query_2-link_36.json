        "text": "Octavio Paz was an iconic 20th-century poet from Mexico. He has become one of the most iconic poets to come out of Latin America and has inspired many literary figures and would take inspiration from artists from all disciplines. A number of his poems were based on works from others, such as Marcel Duchamp and Robert Rauschenberg.\n\nEarly Life\n\nOctavio Paz was born in Mexico City, Mexico, in March of 1914. He grew up in the wake of the Mexican Civil War, which had a significant impact on his family’s finances. Nonetheless, he had continual access to his grandfather’s library, who was a prominent liberal intellectual. The books exposed him to both Mexican and European literature, and he developed an early passion for writers such as Juan Ramón Jiménez. Paz’s first poems were published when he was a teenager, around 1931. His love for the creation of poems would build over the coming years. It was only two years later that he published a book of early poems, Luna Silvestre, (or “Wild Moon”), his first collection of poems. For a teen to already be publishing works is astounding.\n\nPaz would spend time in both the United States and Spain during his early life, which exposed him to a mix of Modernist and Surrealist poetry. He would spend time in different cities throughout his life, locating to Berkeley, California, and New York City.\n\nEarly Career\n\nPaz was educated at a Roman Catholic school and then later at the University of Mexico. When he was twenty-three, he left university, where he was studying law, to work at a school for disadvantaged children in Mérida. It was around this period of time that he began composing one of his better-known volumes, Entre la piedra y la flor or, Between the Stone and the Flower. The volume explores the everyday lives of Mexican peasants who suffer under the landlords for whom they work. It wasn’t published until 1941.\n\nIn 1937, he visited Spain where he was deeply influenced by the Spanish Civil War. He wrote the collection, Bajo tu clara sombra y otros poemas, (or Beneath Your Clear Shadow and Other Poems), in reaction to what he experienced. This book was the one that first drew the public’s attention to his writing. When Paz returned to Mexico, he began work editing literary reviews and would focus his energy on topics such as the arts and politics. These include Taller and El hijo pródigo.\n\nDiplomatic Service\n\nIn 1943, he received a Guggenheim fellowship and studied at the University of California at Berkeley. He and the Paz family spent two years in San Francisco until 1945. He then worked for the Mexican diplomatic service and traveled to Paris. It was around this time he published El Laberinto de la Soledad (or “The Labyrinth of Solitude”). Over the next decade, he spent time in India, Tokyo, and Geneva. One of his greatest poems was written upon his return to Mexico, ‘Piedra de sol’ (or “Sunstone”).\n\nPaz would further his diplomatic career in 1962 by traveling to India and becoming Mexico’s ambassador. However, he would resign only six years later. This was because of his involvement in a protest against the government forces for their role in the massacre of student demonstrators in Mexico City.\n\nLater Life\n\nIn 1965, he was married, and a few years later, he founded the magazine Plural. The later part of his life saw him serve as the Simón Bolívar Professor at Cambridge University and A. D. White Professor-at-Large at Cornell University. Before his death, he won the Jerusalem Prize for literature and then later the Nobel Prize in 1990. Octavio Paz died of cancer in April of 1998.\n\nOctavio Paz has left a lasting legacy throughout the literary world and has garnered critical acclaim to this day. Critics such as Eliot Weinberger have praised his love for words and works that are always in perpetual motion. Paz himself was known for his excellent perspectives on other poetry, as he produced a number of essays and literary criticism. He would also dedicate his works to some of his influences. An example of this is Paz’s examination of Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz, a seventeenth-century New Spain nun and poetess.\n\nFamous Poems\n\nOctavio Paz’s poetry was prolific, and he was responsible for a wide array of works. Here are some of his most famous poems:\n\n‘Piedra del sol‘ (Sun Stone)\n\n‘Epitaph for an Old Woman‘\n\n‘In Her Splendor Islanded‘\n\nInfluences\n\nLike many great poets before him, Octavio Paz has taken inspiration from a number of iconic poets such as Walt Whitman and André Breton. He has also gone on to inspire a long line of literary figures, such as Cristina Peri Rossi, José Emilio Pacheco, Octavio Armand, Juan Gelman, Margo Glantz, Sylvia Plath, Allen Ginsberg, and Seamus Heaney."
