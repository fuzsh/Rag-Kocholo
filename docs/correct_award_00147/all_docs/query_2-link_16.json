        "text": "MEXICO CITY &#151; Poet and philosopher Octavio Paz, who probed the contradictions of the Mexican soul through prose and verse that lost him many friends and won him a Nobel Prize, has died after a long illness. He was 84.Mexican news reports said Paz died late Sunday at his home in the Mexico City neighborhood of Coyoacan.<br><br><br><br>Paz had been sick for years with what he called a \"long and wretched\" illness. In November, after a European news agency prematurely reported his death, Paz called a television station to joke: \"It pains me that those who insist on killing me are in such a hurry.\"<br><br><br><br>Using a clear and simple writing style that broke with Mexico\\'s Baroque literary traditions, Paz explored the Mexican psyche, including the contradiction between its Indian and Spanish roots.<br><br><br><br>Mexico, Paz said in December, is \"a sunny country, a nation where the sun abounds, a prodigious sun, but also a dark and black country. This duality has me preoccupied since I was a child.\"<br><br><br><br>He still is best known for two of his earlier works: the book-length essay The Labyrinth of Solitude and the poem Sun Stone.Paz won the Miguel Cervantes Prize, Spain\\'s most prestigious award, in 1982. In 1987, he was given the T.S. Eliot Award in Chicago. And three years after that, he captured the Nobel Prize for literature.<br><br><br><br>"
