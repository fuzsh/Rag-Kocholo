Here at last is the first retrospective collection of Paz&#39;s poetry to span his entire writing career, from the first published poem, at age seventeen, to his magnificent last poem; the whole is assiduously edited and translated by acclaimed essayist Eliot Weinberger -- who has been translating Paz for over forty years -- with additional translations by several poet-luminaries. This edition includes many poems that have never been translated into English before, new translations based on Paz&#39;s final revisions, and a brilliant capsule biography of Paz by Weinberger, as well as notes on the poems in Paz&#39;s own words, taken from various interviews he gave throughout his life.",
