        "text": "Mexican poet, writer, and diplomat, who received the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1990. With Pablo Neruda and César Vallejo, Octavio Paz was one of the several Latin American poets whose work had wide international impact. Although many of Paz's poems have a regular meter and rhyme scheme, he also experimented with the form. Among his most famous poems is Piedra de sol (1957, Sunstone), referring to the planet Venus, a symbol of sun and water in Aztec folklore, but Goddess of love in Western mythology. The poems, which unite nature and love, were modelled on the ancient Aztec calendar stone.\n\nI travel my way through galleries of sound,\n\nI flow among echoing presences,\n\nI cross transparencies as though I were blind,\n\na reflection erases me, I'm born in another,\n\noh forest of pillars that are enchanted,\n\nthrough arches of light I travel into\n\nthe corridors of a diaphanous fall\n\n(from 'Sunstone,' in Collected Poems of Octavio Paz, edited and translated by Eliot Weinberger, A New Directions Book, 1991, p. 5)\n\nOctavio Paz was born in Mexico City, the son of Octavio Paz Solórzano and Josefina Lozano, born in Andalucía, Spain. His grandfather, Ireneo Paz, was a novelist and journalist – he had a library which contained twelve thousand books – who defended the rights of the indigenous peoples. At the time when Paz was born, the Mexican revolution was at its height. His father, a lawyer, was an ardent supporter of the legendary Emiliano Zapata (1879-1919) and served as his secretary. Looking back to this chaotic period, Paz said: \"The Revolution was a sudden immersion of Mexico in herown being, from which she brought back up, almost blindly, the essentials of a new kind of state. (The Labyrinth of Solitude: Life and Thought in Mexico, translated by Lysander Kemp, Grove Press, 1961, p. 148)\n\nIn 1916 Octavio Paz Solórzano went to Texas to do Zapatista propaganda without much success. When Zapata was driven into retreat and assassinated, the family lived in exile in the United States for a short time. Paz grew up on the outskirts of Mexico City. From early on, he had an appetite for reading. Three books affected him deeply: T. S. Eliot's The Waste Land (1922), Saint-John Perse's Anabase (1930) and André Breton's L'Amour fou (1937). ('Paz, Octavio,' in World Authors 1950-1970, edited by John Wakeman, 1975, p. 1122) At the age of nineteen, Paz published his first collection of poems, Luna silvestre (1933). Paz studied law and literature at the National University, but did not take his degree.\n\nFrom his youth Paz's ambition was to be a poet. Encouraged by Pablo Neruda, Paz started to write; eventually he published over 40 books. In 1937 Paz married Elena Garro; they divorced in 1959. During the Spanish Civil War, Paz participated there in a congress of anti-fascist writers. He tried to volunteer the International Brigades in 1937, but as he said in an interview, \"instead they thought I would be more useful in Mexico to the Republicans by publishing their cause. I returned to Mexico and collaborated with El Popular.\" (Mexico’s Mandarins: Crafting a Power Elite for the Twenty-First Century by Roderic Ai Camp, 2002, p. 117)\n\nHis experiences in Spain, where he met among others André Malraux, André Gide, and Ilya Ehrenburg, Paz recorded in the collection Bajo tu clara sombra(1937). The leftist overtones reflected the cause of the Republican side. Paz remained unyielding in his defence of freedom of expression and democracy, but his political views changed over time. From the 1940s he started to use Surrealistic images. Influenced by André Breton he experimented with automatic writing. However, Paz's expression was never uncontrolled.\n\nDisgusted with Stalinism, Paz had rejected the Left by the time the Cold War began. Language became Paz's central concern; he called writers the \"guardians of language.\" \"I think that for intellectuals, politics has replaced ideology and to some extent religion,\" Paz once said. (New York Times, 11.6.1994) With this attitude he departed from such leading Latin American writers as Pablo Neruda and Gabriel García Márquez, both sharp political critics. Neruda never abandoned his faith in Communism – Paz accused him of being contaminated with politics – and García Marquez defended the Cuban Revolution. Paz maintained his intellectual independence and adopted an utopian vision of social harmony: \"The world will order itself according to the values of poetry, liberty and communion, or it will fall\". ('Mentalist Poetics, the Quest, 'Fiesta' and Other Motifs' by Jason Wilson, in Octavio Paz, edited and with an introduction by Harold Bloom, Chelsea House Publishers, 2002, p. 54)\n\nPaz often warned about Soviet and Cuban intervention in Latin America and his friendship with Gabriel García Marquez and Neruda partly fell apart because of different political views. In 1976 Paz wrote: \"Between what I see and what I say / Between what I say and what I keep silent / Between what I keep silent and what I dream / Between what I dream and what I forget: / Poetry\". (from 'Between what I see and what I say . . . ,' in A Tree Within by Octavio Paz, translated by Eliot Weinberger, 1988, p. 5)\n\nIn the late 1930s and in the 1940s Paz worked as a journalist. He founded and edited several important literary reviews, including Taller (1938-41) and El hijo pródigo, which introduced such diverse writers as Eliot, Lautréamont, and John Donne into Spanish. In 1941 he co-edited Laurel, an influential anthology of Spanis-language poetry. At the beginning of the 1940s, Paz received a Guggenheim fellowship for travel and studies at the University of Berkley.\n\nAfter WW II Paz joined the Mexican Diplomatic Corps. He spent six happy years in Paris. \"My superiors had forgotten me, and I secretly thanked them,\" he later said. (In Light in India by Octavio Paz, translated from the Spanish by Eliot Weinberger, p. 1995, p. 3) He was devastated to leave his friends and the city, but continued his career in Japan, the United States, and India, serving also as Mexico's representative to UNESCO. While in India, he met and married Marie-José Tramini, saying that it was the most important thing that had happened to him after being born.\n\nBy 1957, when The Sun Stone appeared, Paz had been publishing poetry for twenty-six years. In 1968 Paz resigned his diplomatic post in protest over the massacre of students at Plaza Tlateloco in Mexico City in October, before the Olympic Games. Probably over 300 died. Paz became a strong critic of the hegemony of the Partido Revolucionario Institutional (PRI).\n\nBefore moving back to Mexico, where he started to explore his childhood and youth in his poetry, Paz spent his time mostly at British and American universities. Pasado en claro (1975) and Vuelta (1976) drew from autobiographical material. In 'San Ildefonso Nocturne' Paz looked ironically into the past and asked what has happened to those who wanted to \"set the world right.\" Politically he had already turned to support liberal democracy and free-market economics.\n\nFrom 1968 to 1970 Paz was a visiting professor of Spanish American Literature at the universities of Texas, Austin, Pittsburgh and Pennsylvania. He was the Simón Bolívar Professor of Latin American Studies (1970) and Fellow of Churchill College (1970-71), and Charles Eliot Norton Professor of Poetry at Harvard University, Cambridge (1971-72). Paz was editor of the Plural, and from 1976 he edited the Vuelta, which published works by numerous writers and intellectuals from different parts of Latin America. In 1982 he won the prestigious Neustadt Prize. Paz's collected poems (1957-87), in Spanish and English, came out in 1988. Octavio Paz died on April 19, 1998, at the age of 84.\n\nPaz had early adopted influences from Marxism, surrealism, existentialism, Buddhism, Hinduism, French and Anglo-American modernism. However, by the time of the Nobel prize, he had become a conservative; he also defended the contra wars in Nicaragua. Many of Paz's later poems are based on paintings by such artists as Joan Miró, Marcel Duchamp, Antoni Tapies, Robert Rauschenberg, and Roberto Matta. In Salamandra (1962) Paz used innovations of French Cubism. His writing often dealt with opposites, passion and reason, society and the individual, word and meaning. \"The poetic image is an embrace of opposite realities, and rhyme a copulations of sounds; poetry eroticizes language and the world, because its operation is erotic to begin with,\" Paz argued. (The Double Flame: Love and Eroticism, translated from the Spanish by Helen Lane, Harcourt Brace & Company, p. 3)\n\nAs an essayist Paz dealt with such issues as Aztec art, Tantric Buddhism, Mexican politics, neo-platonic philosophy, economic reform, avant-garde poetry, structuralist anthropology, utopian socialism, the dissident movement in the Soviet Union, sexuality and eroticism. El laberinto de la soledad (1950, The Labyrinth of Solitude: Life and Thought in Mexico) is considered one of the most influential studies of life, Mexican character and thought. In Los Angeles Paz noted, that although Mexicans in the streets wear the same clothes and speak the same language as the other inhabitants, they feel ashamed of their origin. \"What distinguishes them, I think, is their furtive, restless air: they act like persons who are wearing disguises, who are afraid of a stranger's look because it could strip them and leave them stark naked. When you talk with them, you observe that their sensibilities are like a pendulum, but a pendulum that has lost its reason and swings violently and erratically back and forth.\" (Ibid., p. 13) According to the author, his countrymen are instinctive nihilists who hide behind masks of solitude. They do not know who they are and they are suspicious of others because they are suspicious of themselves. The book-length essay from a psycho-mythic perspective deeply influenced Mexican writers, particularly Carlos Fuentes.\n\nPaz expressed his scorn for Western feeling of cultural superiority in Children of the Mire: Modern Poetry from Romanticism to the Avant-garde (1974), in which he said: \"Every time the Europeans and their North American descendants have encountered other cultures and civilizations, the have called them backward. . . . The Western world has identified itself with change and time, ad there is no modernity other than of the West. There are hardly any barbarians, Infidels or Gentiles left; rather, the new Heathen Dogs can be counted in the millions, but they are called \"underdeveloped peoples.\"\" (Ibid., translated by Rachel Phillips, Harvard University Press, 1974, p. 20)\n\nAlthough Paz was known as a supporter of the neo-liberal economic policies, he criticized the weaknesses of liberal democracy in Tiempo nublado (1983), La otra voz (1990) and Itinerario (1993), in which he lamenred that modern society was plagued by \"cult of money, abysmal inequalities, fierce selfishness, uniformity of tastes, opinions, consciences.\" ('Paz, Pri, and Progress: Octavio Paz's Political, Economic and Literary Struggle to Inspire Reform in Twentieth-Century Mexico' by D. Gene Pace, Essays in Economic & Business History, Volume XXI, 2003, p. 64)\n\nPaz's numerous essays on Hispanic and French poetry include El arco y la lira (The Bow and the Lyre 1956), Los hijos del limo (Children of the Mire 1974), and Marcel Duchamp (1968). In Essays on Mexican Art (1993) Paz dealt with pre-Columbian art, its \"otherness\" manifested in massive blocks of carved stone. He also contemplated on the secret of Rufino Tamayo's paintings, and examined critically Frieda Kahlo's self-portraits. \"The true artist is the one who says no even when he says yes,\" Paz once stated.
