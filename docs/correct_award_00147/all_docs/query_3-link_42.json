        "text": "Octavio Paz, one of Mexico's greatest poets and writers who won the Nobel prize for literature, died Sunday, official news agency Notimex said Monday. He was 84.\n\nA prolific writer whose literary career began when he was only 17, Paz's distinctive surrealistic verse had broad appeal and had been well-received by critics internationally. He won the Nobel prize in 1990.\"Mexico has lost its greatest thinker and poet. It is an irreparable loss for contemporary thought and culture, not only for Latin America but for the whole world,\" President Ernesto Zedillo was quoted as saying by Notimex.\n\n\"This will make all Mexicans sad, and I know that all Mexicans will unite in a heartfelt and sincere homage for the life and work of Octavio Paz,\" said Zedillo.\n\nThe Mexican leader was speaking to reporters on the presidential airplane while flying back from a 34-nation Summit of the Americas meeting in Santiago, Chile.\n\nNational broadcaster Televisa said Zedillo was told of Paz's death shortly after midnight.\n\nPaz had been seriously ill with cancer and was seldom seen in public, but he continued to edit the literary magazine he founded, called Vuelta.\n\nIn addition to poems, Paz had written extensively on politics, history, art and cultural issues concerning Mexico and the world.\n\n\"He is practically obligatory reading in Mexico and probably better known as an essayist, but if he is such a good essayist it's because he has the prose of a poet,\" writer Carlos Monsivais told Reuters recently.\n\nBorn in Mexico City on March 31, 1914, Paz attended the National University of Mexico before going abroad to pursue a career as a diplomat while writing poetry and essays in his spare time.\n\nHe resigned as an ambassador in 1968 after the Oct. 2 \"Tlatelolco massacre,\" when Mexico City police fired at youths protesting against a wide range of issues including government repression of student activists.\n\nSince the late 1970s, in a move that made him unpopular with some Latin American intellectuals, Paz led a personal crusade against what he perceived as the threat of Soviet and Cuban intervention in Latin America."
