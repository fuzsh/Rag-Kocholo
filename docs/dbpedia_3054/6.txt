Give a certificate of benefactor

Often we are puzzled with the question of what to present to colleagues, friends and loved ones. It is especially difficult to choose a gift for those who have "everything". Therefore, nowadays it is more and more common to give intangible things, and emotions that will be remembered for a long time. Now you can present a good deed as well!

Izgelek Foundation launches a program of gift certificates, where you can make any person the author of a charitable donation to seriously ill children and adults. On his holiday, he will give a sick child a chance to be healthy and join a good cause.

How does it work?

You make a donation to our wards on behalf of the birthday person /newly-weds etc. and contact us. We are preparing a personalized charity certificate, its design and text of congratulations will be developed taking into account your wishes and the theme of the anniversary. All you have to do is print it out and hand it over!

A sample text:

Please accept our sincere gratitude for your contribution to charity! The transfer made on your behalf on the Day of your birth to the Charity Fund "Izgelek" will change the fate of seriously ill children for the better. Thank you!
