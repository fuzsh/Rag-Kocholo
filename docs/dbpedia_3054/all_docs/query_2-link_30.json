        "text": "President - Academician Lunin Valery Vasilyevich\n\nDean - corresponding member Kalmykov Stepan Nikolaevich\n\nChemistry as a scientific discipline appeared at Moscow University in the first year of its existence. The founder of the university M.V. Lomonosov, a great scientist, poet and artist, was also one of the best chemists of his time. The Department of Chemistry appeared at the Faculty of Medicine shortly after the formation of Moscow University in 1755. Many generations of Russian chemists, who entered the history of world science, studied and taught at the Faculty of Chemistry of Moscow State University.\n\nToday, the faculty includes 17 departments and 1 interdepartmental laboratory, which represent all modern areas of chemical science and relevant specializations, in which highly qualified chemists are trained.\n\nDepartments of the Faculty of Chemistry:\n\nPhysical Chemistry (Head of the Department - Academician of the Russian Academy of Sciences V.V. Lunin);\n\n(head of the department - professor A.V. Shevelkov);\n\n(acting head of the department - Professor M.A. Proskurnin);\n\n(Head of the Department - Professor V.G. Nenaidenko);\n\nMedical Chemistry and Fine Organic Synthesis (Head of the Department - Professor E.R. Milaeva);\n\n(Head of the Department - Corresponding Member of the Russian Academy of Sciences S.D. Varfolomeev);\n\n(Head of the Department - Corresponding Member of the Russian Academy of Sciences E.V. Antipov);\n\nChemistry of Natural Compounds (Head of the Department - Academician of the Russian Academy of Sciences O.A. Dontsova);\n\nchemical technology and new materials (head of the department - professor V.V. Avdeev);\n\nChemistry of Petroleum and Organic Catalysis (Head of the Department - Professor E.A. Karakhanov);\n\nchemical kinetics (head of the department - professor M.Ya. Melnikov);\n\nmacromolecular compounds (head of the department - corresponding member of the Russian Academy of Sciences A.A. Yaroslavov);\n\n(Head of the Department - Corresponding Member of the Russian Academy of Sciences S.N. Kalmykov);\n\ngeneral chemistry (head of the department - professor S.F. Dunaev);\n\nlaser chemistry (head of the department - professor A.V. Stolyarov);\n\ncolloid chemistry (head of the department - professor V.G. Sergeev);\n\nFundamental Foundations of Chemistry (Head of the Department - Academician of the Russian Academy of Sciences M.P. Egorov).\n\nThe Interdepartmental Laboratory of Computational Methods in Chemistry is headed by Associate Professor V.S. Lyutsarev.\n\nThe faculty has more than 1800 employees, including 9 academicians and 17 corresponding members of the Russian Academy of Sciences, more than three hundred and fifty teachers and about 700 researchers. More than 1200 students and about 300 graduate students study at the faculty.\n\nThe faculty trains broad-profile chemists in all areas of modern chemistry, taking into account the latest scientific trends, including those related to the production of new materials and drugs, scientific activities in the field of resource-saving and nanotechnologies. In addition, members of the Faculty of Chemistry teach chemistry at a number of other faculties of the Moscow State University, as well as in the branches of the Moscow State University in Baku (Republic of Azerbaijan), in Dushanbe (Republic of Tajikistan) and the joint University of MSU-FPI in Shenzhen (People's Republic of China). ). The high qualification of graduates of the Faculty of Chemistry is also due to the fact that from the first year each student is involved in scientific work, participates in projects and conferences on relevant topics.\n\nInternational connections, excellent teaching staff, a unique atmosphere that you feel from the first minutes of being a student, a place where you want to return every day - all this is the Faculty of Chemistry.\n\nRegardless of the future specialization, all students study general fundamental disciplines during the first 3 years. These are: higher mathematics, physics, a foreign language, humanitarian subjects and, of course, basic chemical disciplines. Up to 40% of the study time is allocated for the study of chemical disciplines in the curriculum, which is divided approximately equally between theoretical classes and laboratory work. Considerable attention is paid to fundamental physical and mathematical training. Up to 20% of the study time is devoted to the study of higher mathematics, applied mathematics, general and theoretical physics, which is almost twice as much as in any other chemical universities in the country.\n\nGraduates of the faculty, as well as graduates of other universities, can continue their studies in the faculty's master's program in several programs, including the recently opened direction \"Chemical Technology\". The term of study in the master's program is 2 years. Graduates of the faculty who have good and excellent grades for all the years of study and have shown an inclination for research work have the opportunity to continue their studies in the graduate school of the faculty.\n\nWe want to see talented young people who are passionate about the ideas of chemistry as our students. To do this, the faculty has created a network of \"sponsored\" schools, lyceums, gymnasiums, in which classes are conducted according to a special university program.\n\nIn order to attract talented young people to MSU, since 1993, the Faculty has been conducting a preliminary selection of the most talented students through Olympiads, not only from Moscow schools, but also from urban and rural schools throughout Russia, and even from the former republics of the Soviet Union.\n\nThe faculty is waiting for talented, gifted and daring young people who are eager to benefit the Fatherland and continue the glory of Russian science.\n\nMore information about the faculty:\n\n-- [ Page 1 ] --\n\nMoscow, 2008\n\nLBC 74.58 Approved\n\nX 350 RISO Organizing Committee\n\nanniversary meeting\n\nISBN 1755-1953-58\n\n50 years.

Fedorov, edited by V.A. Sadovnichy He is Ours! He is the first!\n\nLet's glorify the University He is Moscow!\n\nIn the days of celebrations, in the days of victories, Who managed to show the world, Not without reason near the walls of the Kremlin \"What can his own Platons He was born, so that for a long time And fast-witted Newtons To acquire unfading glory, the Russian land to give birth.\" Rightfully owned by the Pets of Sparrow Hills.\n\nAnd, proving that Knowledge is power, Let us glorify the gift of Elizabeth, Who fulfilled Peter's precepts, Forever in the history of Russia, Her Majesty's decree, Brilliant left a mark For centuries, exalted the State, Sciences, accomplishments and discoveries, So that Lomonosov and Shuvalov The minds of talented abode In deeds lived among us, Moscow University, Lived among us in deeds. University of Moscow.\n\nThe role and importance of Moscow University in the history of national science, education and culture can hardly be overestimated. Moscow University became the first Russian institution of higher education that laid the foundations of public education, created numerous domestic scientific schools, and brought up the brightest cultural figures. The names of A.S. Pushkin, M.Yu. Lermontov, F.I. Tyutcheva, A.P. Chekhov, A.N. Ostrovsky, I.A. Goncharova. The pride of Russian natural science is the achievements of A.N. Kolmogorova, P.S. Alexandrova, N.D. Zelinsky, A.N. Nesmeyanov, N.N. Semyonova, L.D. Landau, P.L. Kapitsa. Philosophers, mathematicians, physicists, chemists - representatives of all fields of knowledge - wove brilliant works into the outline of the history of Moscow University, which largely predetermined the further development of science. Schools created by university scientists still adequately represent our country in the international arena.\n\nRector of Moscow State University, Academician V.A. Sadovnichiy THE THREE WHALE OF RUSSIAN CHEMISTRY Alexander Mikhailovich Dmitry Ivanovich Butlerov Mendeleev (1828-1886) (1834-1907) Vladimir Vasilievich Markovnikov (1837-1904) Chemistry Department of Moscow State University The Faculty of Chemistry of Moscow State University is the largest center of chemical education and science. For 75 years since the founding of the faculty, about 17,000 students have been trained in it (including foreign students and those who studied at the evening department);\n\nabout 15,500 of them completed their studies in full. The evening department that existed at the Faculty of Chemistry in the mid-1950s - 1960s was completed by 1208 students.\n\nAbout 5,400 people studied in full-time postgraduate studies at the Faculty of Chemistry. Since the beginning of the training of foreign specialists in 1948 (until 2004), people (students, graduate students and interns) graduated from the Faculty of Chemistry from 65 countries, including England, Bulgaria, Vietnam, Germany, Egypt, India, Italy, China, Korea, Cuba , Mongolia, UAE, Poland, Romania, USA, etc.\n\nThe knowledge and opportunities that graduates of the Faculty of Chemistry possess today are truly enormous. In order to draw the attention of novice chemists to the inadmissibility of using the acquired knowledge to the detriment of a person (for example, for the synthesis of drugs, chemical weapons, poisons and other dangerous substances), since 2000, at the initiative of the Dean of the Faculty of Chemistry of Moscow State University, Academician V.V. Lunin introduced the Chemist's Oath for students. Its text was approved at a meeting of the Chemistry Council of the UMO of Russian Universities on June 27, 2000.\n\nCHEMIST'S Oath Accepting with deep gratitude the knowledge bestowed on me and comprehending the secrets of chemical science, I swear on the names of Mikhail Vasilievich Lomonosov, Dmitry Ivanovich Mendeleev, Alexander Mikhailovich Butlerov and all our Teachers:\n\nthroughout my life not to darken the honor of the chemical brotherhood, which I now join.\n\nDo not use your knowledge to the detriment of Man, Nature, the Fatherland and the Alma mater who raised me, do not prepare and sell secret means and do not give a deadly or forbidden means to the one who asks.\n\nI promise to fulfill this oath unquestioningly. May this give me happiness in life, success in my affairs and glory for all eternity!\n\nWhoever breaks it or takes a false oath, may he be rejected by our entire community and buried in oblivion for all time.\n\nI swear! I swear! I swear!\n\nCurrently, this oath is pronounced by first-year students of all chemical departments of state classical universities in Russia at the solemn ceremony of presenting student cards.\n\nDEANS OF OUR TIME Alexandra Vasilievna Novosyolova Claudia Vasilievna Topchieva (1900-1986), Dean 1949-55 (1911-1985), Dean 1955- Sergei Mikhailovich Skuratov (1905-1968), Dean 1960- Ivan Fomich Lutsenko Ilya Vasilyevich Berezin (1913-1993 ), Dean 1962-69 (1923-1987), Dean 1969 - Yuri Yakovlevich Kuzyakov Valery Vasilyevich Lunin (b. 1932), Dean 1981-92 (b. 1940), Dean from 1992 to the present Looking into the future (Moscow, 27 August 1953) Faculty of Chemistry, Moscow State University, November 1953.\n\nThe first graduate of the Faculty of Chemistry of Moscow State University on the Lenin Hills 1953 - 1958 Anna Yulyevna Alybina After graduating from the Faculty of Chemistry of Moscow State University (Department of Petroleum Chemistry), I worked for two years in the laboratory of polymers of the Institute of Economics of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR under Academician V.V. Korshak, and then entered the graduate school of the Faculty of Chemistry and in 1964 she defended her Ph.D. thesis at her native Department of Petroleum Chemistry.\n\nFrom 1964 to 1978 I worked at the Institute of Organic Chemistry of the USSR Academy of Sciences in the Laboratory of Polymer Chemistry with Corresponding Member of the Russian Academy of Sciences V.A. Ponomarenko, and then moved in 1978 to work at the All-Union Scientific and Technical Information Center of the State Committee for Science and Technology (VNTICentre), where she worked first as a senior and then as a leading researcher in the department for analyzing scientific and technical information until her retirement in 1991. This was an interesting job. I prepared reviews jointly with the Scientific Councils of the USSR Academy of Sciences in the series \"Polymers in Medicine\" and \"Food Resources\". I have more than 40 scientific papers. My husband, a senior researcher at the Institute of Atomic Energy.\n\nI.V. Kurchatov, died in 2003. Daughter and son-in-law are graphic artists. Both graduated from the Polygraphic Institute. The grandson is a student at MIEM. Currently, I work \"in free mode\" - translating patents.\n\nHobbies: music, literature, visual arts, travel (traveled to 25 countries).\n\nAminov Telman Gazizovich Entered the Faculty of Chemistry of Moscow State University in 1953 and immediately plunged headlong into the amazing atmosphere of science and social life of those years. These were the years when the country almost healed the wounds caused by the war, and we were young, active, full of hope and ... love. And now, years and decades later, at each meeting of classmates, the memories of that time come to life with renewed vigor, exciting and reopening spiritual wounds. The first such wound was the reorganization of our student groups and parting with the guys who became close and almost family ... What then? And then there were postgraduate studies at the departments of inorganic and physical chemistry and work at the Institute of General and Inorganic Chemistry.\n\nN.S. Kurnakov of the Academy of Sciences, where he defended his doctoral dissertation on the magnetic properties of complex chromium chalcogenides.\n\nIt is interesting that this year, when it is 50 years since our graduation from Moscow State University, the city of Ufa celebrated the 100th anniversary of the birth of my mother, Zainab Biisheva, the first national writer of the Republic of Bashkortostan. These numbers - 50 and 100 - do not seem to contain anything special, but their significance sometimes seems huge, given the brevity of the human life given to us.\n\nAminov Telman Gazizovich, Academician of the Russian Academy of Natural Sciences, Doctor of Chemical Sciences, Professor, Leading Researcher at the Institute of General and Inorganic Chemistry of the Russian Academy of Sciences.

From 1943 to a year he studied at Moscow school No. 69, studied in a chemical circle at the Chemistry Faculty of Moscow State University (1951 - 53).\n\nAfter graduating from the Faculty of Chemistry of Moscow State University in February 1959, he went to work at the Institute of Chemical Physics of the Russian Academy of Sciences in the laboratory of V.I. Goldansky as a junior research fellow. In a year he defended his PhD thesis. Since 1964, he continued to work in the branch of this laboratory at the Institute of Chemical Physics of the Russian Academy of Sciences as a senior researcher. In 1974 he defended his doctoral dissertation.\n\nIn 1974, a laboratory of cryochemistry and radiation chemistry was organized from a group of employees. Until November 2003, he was the head of this laboratory, where fundamental research was carried out to study the mechanisms of cryochemical processes, which led to the discovery of reactions occurring near absolute zero temperatures.\n\nI have a son and a granddaughter.\n\nIgor died on January 4, 2009 Bezus Arkady Belozerov Rudolf Alexandrovich Born in 1935 in Veliky Ustyug, Vologda Oblast.\n\nAfter graduating from high school with a gold medal, he entered the Chemistry Department of Moscow State University. In 1958 he defended his thesis \"The study of polymorphism under pressure of two substances KNO3 and AgI\"\n\nat the Department of Physics and Chemistry of Ultrahigh Pressures. The study used the X-ray diffraction method of analysis.\n\nFrom 1958 to 1995, he worked as an analytical chemist at the Central Plant Laboratory at the Dolgoprudny Chemical Plant for Fine Organic Synthesis.\n\nHe developed methods for the analysis of color film chemicals using classical, oscillographic, alternating current polarography, anodic voltammetry on a platinum electrode, and since 1990 - liquid chromatography. In 1975, he completed advanced training courses on the study of methods for planning experiments. From 1976 to 1985 he studied (on his own) Japanese. In 1984-85 he translated Japanese patents on basic organic synthesis at RZhKhim.\n\nIn d, considering wonderful integer relations like 33 +43 +53 = 63;\n\n13 + 63 + 83 = 93 etc. as a three-dimensional analogue of the Pythagorean theorem, found a way to approximate the construction of the fourth number from the first three.\n\nPrincipal vegetarian since 1961. For 37 years of work at the plant, he has never been on sick leave.\n\nBelokopytov Victor Pavlovich (02/24/1936 - 06/19/2008) I was born in the city of Essentuki on February 24, 1936. Mother Evgenia Sergeevna Shevtsova was born in 1908 in the city of\n\nEssentuki. She died in 1997 in Moscow. Father Belokopytov Pavel Ivanovich was born in 1913 in the city of Belokopytov.\n\nStavropol. In 1941 he was drafted into the Red Army. Nothing more is known about the father.\n\nIn 1953, I graduated from the male secondary school No. 2 in Stavropol with a silver medal and entered the Chemistry Faculty of Moscow State University. From 1958 to 1971 he worked as a junior researcher at the NIFHI named after. L.Ya. Karpov.\n\nSpecialized in the field of electrochemistry. In 1969\n\ndefended his thesis for the degree of candidate of chemical sciences. Honorary chemist of the USSR, awarded the bronze medal of VDNKh.\n\nSince 1971, he worked in the Special Design Bureau for Electrochemistry, first as the head of the electrochemical research sector, and then as an adviser to the general director.\n\nMarried twice. The first wife is classmate Kuznetsova Elena Alexandrovna - a senior researcher at the Institute of Pharmacology of the Russian Academy of Medical Sciences.\n\nSon, Alexander (he is 50 years old) graduated from Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology. Currently working in the field of computer technology. He has also been married twice. Has two daughters (27 and 19 years old) and a grandson (one year old). The second wife, Bazhenova Lyudmila Vasilievna, is currently a pensioner.\n\nHe has two daughters from his second marriage, aged 26 and 27. They both graduated from MISI, economists, now they work in their specialty.\n\nVictor managed to celebrate the anniversary of the course with us. Nothing foreshadowed his quick death. We will always remember him as one of the best athletes of Moscow State University (master of sports in sambo), as a cheerful and sympathetic friend. Excellent chemist.\n\nBelyaev Anatoly Vasilyevich In the enrollment of first-year students of the Chemistry Department of Moscow State University in 1953, there were more than three hundred of us. We were all children of wartime, and each drank his share of hardship. For me, a young man from the wilderness of the steppe between the rivers Khopra and Don, acquaintance with Moscow made a stunning impression. Fortunately, it was short-lived, because, according to the rules that existed at that time, the owners of gold and silver medals did not take entrance exams, but only passed an interview, a medical examination and filled out a long questionnaire, the answers to some questions of which baffled us. For example, \"did you serve in the White Army?\". What to write? So write - “I didn’t serve in the White Army”, or “what did my parents do before 1917?”. There were also more insidious questions: \"Do you have any relatives abroad?\"\n\nThese questions were frightening, but, be that as it may, having completed all the procedures, I happily rushed to \"freedom, to the pampas.\" The rest of the summer flew by in serene idleness, overshadowed only by the news that more than half of my classmates failed to overcome the barrier of competitive exams this year.\n\nIn August, I received a notice of enrollment in the first year of the Faculty of Chemistry of Moscow State University with the provision of a hostel. The latter was decisive for many, because the financial capabilities of most families did not allow solving the “housing problem” in any other way.\n\nFor this reason, many young men of my generation entered military schools. On the advice of the “experienced”, I went to Moscow a few days before the appointed time. Mokhovaya explained to me that the check-in at the \"Student's House\" would begin on August 30 and was sent to Stromynka. There I met a young man from Nizhny Tagil, S.V. Larionov, now Doctor of Chemistry, professor, laureate of the State Prize, with whom I have been walking side by side through life for 52 years.\n\nThe next day we went to the Lenin Hills to see the University where we were to study. The main building made an indelible impression, but it was impossible to approach it: portable wooden fences were guarded by policemen, and several columns of people dressed in something gray, accompanied by soldiers in blue-topped caps and with rifles at the ready, passed through the territory between them and the building. Then we were told that at that time prisoners were being taken out of the territory of the University, by whose labor the building was built to a large extent.\n\nCheck-in to the room on the eighth floor of Zone G went exceptionally smoothly. I am still amazed at the organizational clarity with which this large-scale action went: no confusion, no delays, no fuss. The level of domestic comfort is unthinkable: everything is thought out and executed to the smallest detail. For five years we lived as students were supposed to live under communism.\n\nIn April 1954, preparations began for the All-Union parade of athletes.\n\nResponsibilities are small: one - two training sessions a day, monthly fees and the parade itself in early August. And, of course, discipline. In exchange - coupons for free food, two tracksuits and a badge. There were even benefits: those who wished were allowed to move the spring session to autumn. Due to family circumstances, I did not take advantage of this opportunity, which I did not regret in the future. I passed the session perfectly, and for the entire period of study I never retaken a single exam and did not receive any grades other than fives. Worthy of respect was the rule instituted at the University and followed strictly: even a single triple deprive a graduate of the right to receive a diploma with honors, which happened to me.\n\nWe are extremely lucky with the teaching staff. As I now understand, it was the golden elite of the old school. Inorganic chemistry was read by V.I.\n\nSpitsyn, analytical - I.P. Alimarin, organic - A.N. Nesmeyanov, colloid - P.A. Rebinder, all academicians, physical - Ya.I. Gerasimov, corresponding member And the point here is not in titles and ranks, but in the personalities of these truly outstanding scientists. President of the Academy of Sciences A.N. Nesmeyanov read his course once a week for a year and a half. For all the time there were only two episodes that violated this order. For the first time, Alexander Nikolaevich apologetically announced that he was being sent on a business trip to the FRG, and O.A. would give a lecture or two for him. Reutov. The second time he was 20 minutes late for the start of the lecture, he went into the audience angry, apologized and began to read. As it turned out later, there was terrible ice in Moscow, the cars literally could not move, huge traffic jams formed. Today I see with bitterness how holders of academic titles and even ordinary professors go on business trips that are insignificant in their meaning, and even worse - on pleasure cruises, and I think, what can they teach today's students?\n\nAt the final lecture by A.N. Nesmeyanov, one of the \"advanced\" fellow students sent a note with the question \"how do you feel about the theory of resonance and mesomerism?\". Unlike, for example, P.A. Rebindera Alexander Nikolaevich did not look artistic at the chair, he was rather phlegmatic, but then he changed: temperamentally, for more than two hours without a break, he set out to us the essence of the problem, its strengths and weaknesses, arguments and counter-arguments of opponents;\n\nit was a completely different person. As I later found out from my organic friends, the reason for this transformation was a question that concerned a taboo topic. The thing is that the pogrom of geneticists in our country is known to many educated people, but a similar pogrom of chemists under the slogan of criticizing the theory of resonance and mesomerism is known not even to every professional chemist, but to A.N.\n\nNesmeyanov was one of her last defenders.\n\nWell-equipped training laboratories, excellently trained and friendly technical staff - all this contributed to the development of the chosen profession. A few years later, I unexpectedly received confirmation of the decisive role of the workshop in the preparation of a chemist from the first dean of NSU B.O. Olondets;\n\nmajoring in mathematics. I taught a course and conducted a workshop with geologists, and two careless guys exhausted all the required attempts to pass the test. In a conversation with me about the fate of these guys, Boris Osipovich gently remarked: “I understand that one can become a chemist only in a laboratory, but these are geologists,” and thereby persuaded me to decide to give the guys one last chance.\n\nWorking with hands in the laboratory - what could be more attractive in the life of a chemist? I happened to see academician I.I. Chernyaeva, in a dressing gown conjuring over another synthesis together with his graduate student N.N. Zheligovskaya (Krasovskaya), with whom I subsequently developed good relations on the basis of the chemistry of platinum metals.\n\nThe guardian angel of all diplomats of the laboratory of salt equilibrium, then still a member. corr. A.V. Novosyolova often conducted the first experiments herself before handing them over to any of the graduate students for further research. He was an amazing person: she remembered not only the names and surnames of all the graduate students who passed through her laboratory, but she knew who, where, who works, what successes he had achieved, and even what kind of family he had.\n\nSubsequently, during her visit to Novosibirsk, I and my classmate Yu. Dyadin showed her Akademgorodok, and in the evening in her room a conversation took place about our problems in the field of semiconductors, and I blurted out out of passion: “these physicists need little!” She, looking reproachfully at me, objected: “Tolya, this is not for physicists, but the country needs it.” I blushed deeply, realizing that I had froze stupidity. She also owns a subtle statement about meaningless directives from above: \"Sometimes we are forced to do work that is humiliating for a chemist.\" In the first year of our studies, she was the dean of the faculty and unexpectedly left this post. Many years later, I learned from her former graduate student O.N. Breusov, that the reason for her resignation was her proposal to reduce the number of teaching hours on the basics of Marxism-Leninism in the first year of the Faculty of Chemistry. In her office there would be a huge desk, a soft sofa and a chair, the rest of the place was occupied by two chemical tables, a draft and several laboratory stools. She was assisted in the experiments by a personal laboratory assistant. How different all this is from the offices of most modern scientists, in which these rooms resemble the offices of mediocre managers rather than the laboratory of a scientist.\n\nEven short-term communication with people like our teachers at Moscow State University, and subsequent pedagogical activity at Novosibirsk State University strengthened my conviction in the correctness of the thought expressed by someone - the main thing is not what they teach, but who teaches and how.\n\nLow bow to the professors and lecturers of the Moscow University.\n\nBerdnikova Maria Pavlovna I was born on February 2, 1935 in the Southern Urals in Bashkiria in the village of Shafranovo. The resort \"Shafranovo\" was known as the all-Union koumiss clinic.\n\nThe dry climate and the beauty of the foothills of the Urals - all this had a beneficial effect on the sick:\n\nGroves and hills are spread around here, those that are more beautiful We have not seen ...\n\nAfter graduating from the railway school, in 1953 she entered the Chemistry Faculty of Moscow State University. I have the brightest memories of my student years. I still remember trips to the collective farm in the Mozhaisk district, participation in the sports parade on August 7, 1954 at the Dynamo stadium, the procession of our column of athletes along Red Square on May 1, wonderful propaganda trips and hikes with friends around Moscow.\n\nI am especially grateful to Mark Perelson and those Muscovites who organized trips to theaters and museums for us, visitors.\n\nAfter graduating from Moscow State University and postgraduate studies at Nesmeyanovskaya, she got a job at a defense enterprise in the town of Dzerzhinsky near Kapotnya. She was engaged in the development of armor coatings and technologies for their application to TRT charges. Such charges for the Grad and Uragan installations were processed with my direct participation at the plants in Perm, Sterlitamak and Krasnoyarsk.\n\nShe studied chess (2nd category), went to tournaments around Moscow.\n\nNow I'm retired. I take care of the garden and the great-grandchildren of my late sister, whom I love and consider family. I still love travel.\n\nAt one time, my husband and I traveled by car throughout the Caucasus, Crimea, Moldova, Ukraine, and the Baltic states. They got to the Kungur caves near Perm, flew three times to Central Asia, were in Issyk-Kul visiting Rosita Sarybaeva.\n\nNow it's not as easy as it used to be. And after retirement, I have already visited (relatives help with money) Egypt, Turkey, Israel, Jordan, the Maldives, Thailand, Hungary. In Prague, she was visiting Nina Martinkova. Now I dream of traveling around Europe by bus.\n\nI regularly meet with classmates - Shiryaev, Fira Buranaeva, Lena Boreskova, Galya Kalenchuk, Nina Martinkova (when she comes to Moscow), Alla Vaskovskaya, and others.\n\nWith love for our course, MASHA BERDNIKOVA Yuri Adolfovich Berlin (February 2, 1936 – November 23, 2001) Immediately after graduating from the Faculty of Chemistry, Yu.A.\n\nMM. Shemyakin and Yu.A. Ovchinnikov).\n\nHere he went a glorious path: candidate of sciences (1961), doctor of chemical sciences (1971), professor (1992), head of the laboratory of gene expression mechanisms in 1997). Yu.A. Berlin is the author of more than 160 scientific papers, he prepared 16 PhDs, conducted a large scientific and organizational work, was a member of the editorial board and editor of the English version of the journal Bioorganic Chemistry.\n\nScientific interests Yu.A. Berlin were associated with the chemistry of antibiotics and nucleic acids, as well as with genetic engineering. In the 1960s, he established the structure of the complex natural antibiotic olivomycin. He was actively involved in the study of several new antibiotics and the creation of a fundamental monograph on the chemistry of antibiotics. He was one of the first in our country in the 1970s to start work on genetic engineering. His works on targeted chemical and chemical-enzymatic gene synthesis are widely known. He elucidated the structural foundations of the mechanism of formation of a number of transduced bacteriophages, the structure of recognition sites and the features of the functioning of several restriction endonucleases, the nature and distribution of mutations. Leading to such hereditary diseases.\n\nLike thalassemia, cystic fibrosis, sickle cell anemia and phenylketonuria. He synthesized the genes for yeast valine tRNA, interleukin-1 and its receptor antagonist, developed new fluorescent labels for modifying oligonucleotides, and obtained conjugates based on them.\n\nYura Berlin was a brilliant versatile educated and very enthusiastic scientist, an excellent energetic organizer, a bright and fascinating interlocutor, a connoisseur of literature and art, a polyglot.\n\nHe radiated optimism and kindness. We will always remember his sincerity and responsiveness, gentle humor.\n\nBobrov Lev Viktorovich Born on March 24, 1935. I am one of those graduates of the Faculty of Chemistry of Moscow State University who betrayed the good old chemistry. At first (in 1959 - 1962) he was a junior researcher at the Laboratory of Surface Phenomena at the Institute of Physical Chemistry of the USSR Academy of Sciences (IFKhAN).\n\nIn 1962 - 1967 - worked as a literary worker (who replaced in this position a former classmate of a fellow student, also a renegade Kostrov Vladimir Andreevich), then became the head.\n\nDepartment of Chemistry in the editorial office of the journal \"Technology - Youth\". In 1967 - 1974 - head. Department of Science and Technology and member of the editorial board of the monthly magazine (digest) APN \"Sputnik\". In 1975 - 1984 - still in the APN - the head of the united editorial office of the digest, later - the united editorial office of culture of the Main Editorial Board of Centralized Materials, then - the columnist of the GRTSM. In 1984 - 1988 - Columnist in the editorial office of the weekly APN \"Globus\". In 1988 - 1991 - again the observer of the GRTSM. In 1991 - 1997 - outside the APN - columnist, head. department and member of the editorial board of the weekly \"Voice of the Motherland\" of the International Association \"Motherland\". B - 2004 - Columnist on education, science, culture in the editorial office of the private publication \"Pedagogical Bulletin\". From 2004 to the present - freelance work in the editorial offices of Moscow magazines and publishing houses.\n\nHe began to indulge in journalism in his student years (my father and mother are journalists). Worked for editorial staff from 1962 to 2004. Author of dozens of books and hundreds of articles, essays, and interviews. Specialization - first, the popularization of chemistry, then more widely - science and technology, then even more widely - culture and education.\n\nMarital status - a widower since 1996. The first and only wife was Plakhotnikova Margarita Petrovna (1936 - 1996), a teacher with a higher education. Without exaggeration - a golden woman. He lived with her for 36 happy years. Our only offspring Vladimir Bobrov (born in 1961) is a graduate of the Moscow Institute of Radio Electronics and Automation (MIREA). Worked and works successfully as an electronics engineer and manager. He did not change the original, again free of charge, education.\n\nHowever, occasionally he pees, as if following in the footsteps of his father, grandfather and grandmother, appears in the press as a journalist (with a historiographic bias). A man without fools, sensible.\n\nFor a long time a stubborn scribe. Recently married, lives in Mytishchi with his missus.\n\nIt often happens with my wife, alone in a two-room apartment. We listen to music together (my son is a cool lover and connoisseur of jazz), watch videos and CDs.\n\nHe helps his retired father not only financially. Advises me on the part of non-problematic interaction with a home personal computer.\n\nP.S. I am a solid Bolshevik: I belong to the majority of our people in the national, social, sexual sense. On the other hand, I am a Menshevik:\n\nI belong to that minority of graduates of our chemical faculty, which was made up of renegades like me. Among the latter are such remarkable and outstanding people as Shabanov Alexander Alexandrovich, KOSTROV Vladimir Andreevich, ORLOV Vladislav Mikhailovich...\n\nBogatyrev Vladimir Lvovich (02/20/1935 - 05/11/2002) Born in the Perm region, graduated from school in Volgograd;\n\nback in the 8th grade, he drew a high-rise building on his diary and said that he would be a student at Moscow State University.\n\nYears of study at the Faculty of Chemistry of Moscow State University - 1953 - (special group of radiochemists).\n\nSince 1959 - an employee of the INH. A.V.\n\nNikolaev SB RAS (senior lab., postgraduate student, junior researcher)\n\ncollaborator, art. scientific collaborator, head laboratory, deputy\n\ndirector). He combined scientific work with pedagogical work (Departments of Inorganic Chemistry and Radiochemistry of FEN NGU;\n\nrecently professor of the natural sciences department of the Siberian University of Consumer Cooperatives. Several Ph.D. theses were defended under his supervision.\n\nAreas of scientific interests - the study of ion-exchange resins as a special type of chemical reagents;\n\nhigh-purity substances;\n\ninclusion connections;\n\ndirectional crystallization. He had grants under the programs \"Zeolites of Russia\", \"Mineral Raw Materials\", a grant from the Soros Foundation.\n\nHe has about 200 publications, including articles in leading domestic scientific journals, 8 certificates of authorship, 6 monographs (three of them - in co-authorship), Textbook for university students.\n\nHe was a member of special councils for defense (Inkh SB RAS, KemGU);\n\nmember of the Section of the Scientific Council for Chromatography of the Russian Academy of Sciences;\n\nFor 25 years he was the scientific editor of the All-Union bibliographic index “Extraction. Ion exchange. Member of the Chemical Society. DI. Mendeleev;\n\nwas awarded the Kurnakov N.S. medal. (1978).\n\nActively participated in public life (chairman of the local committee, secretary of the party organization of the Institute), for which he was awarded Certificates of Honor.\n\nVeteran of Labor, Honored Veteran of the Siberian Branch of the USSR Academy of Sciences.\n\nDaughter is a graduate of FEN NSU, Ph.D. chem. Sciences, lives in England);\n\ngrandson and granddaughter.\n\nHe was a fisherman, a motorist, a gardener.\n\nBogdanov Aleksey Alekseevich In his first year, under the influence of his beloved teacher Natalya Sergeevna, Tamm decided to become an inorganic. I came to my senses in my second year. And, since he loved organic chemistry and biology since childhood, he went to the laboratory of protein chemistry (in those days it was not at all that prestigious).\n\nLucky twice. Firstly, I got to Mikhail Alekseevich Prokofiev, an excellent scientist and person, thanks to whom he became who he is. Secondly, he began to study molecular biology (there was expanse for chemists in it), probably the most romantic and, in general, the main science of the second half of the 20th century.\n\nWhen they graduated from the Faculty of Chemistry in 1958, M.A. hired me as a senior laboratory assistant. Lucky again - in 1965 M.A. Prokofiev turned the Laboratory of Protein Chemistry into the Department of Chemistry of Natural Compounds (which I have been in charge of for a little over twenty years). We moved to a new building (laboratory building \"A\" of Moscow State University) and there we actually merged with the future university Institute of Physical and Chemical Biology, deputy. director of science whom I have been working since 1969.\n\nThanks to these changes, by the age of thirty I managed to form my own laboratory. We deal with nucleic acids, proteins and, most of all, ribosomes. These are such molecular machines, which are full in every living cell. They synthesize all cellular proteins. And since there are more than a hundred thousand atoms in each ribosome, more than one generation of those who will come after us will understand the mechanism of their work.\n\nSo, 50 years of work at Moscow State University + 5 years of study. I started teaching in September 1958 and I still can't stop (although it's long overdue).\n\nOf the overseas countries, he spent most of his time in the USA (in the 1960s and 1980s, he spent two semesters on a “postdoc” internship and three semesters as a visiting professor). In the \"difficult nineties\" he collaborated a lot with colleagues from West Berlin.\n\nI have been a member of the Russian Academy of Sciences for about 25 years (a full member since 1994).\n\nBogdanov Gennady Nikolaevich A native of the city of Bryansk (05/25/1934). Working in the laboratory of organometallic compounds at O.A. Reutov, graduated with honors from the Faculty of Chemistry in 1958.\n\nand entered the \"Nesmeyanov Postgraduate School\" at the Institute of Chemical Physics (ICP). Under the leadership of N.M. Emanuel, whom I consider my teacher in science and mentor in life, defended his Ph.D. thesis on the chemistry of antitumor antioxidants.\n\nIn 1962 he was sent to the Chernogolovsky branch of the IHF. Our team is special - a superstate, no one has seen such a potion:\n\nChemBioMedPhysOncoCyberMat is the creation of N.M.\n\nEmanuel.\n\nI married my classmate Lyusya Sergeeva, who became my only love for life.\n\nSoon Natasha was born to us, and we got our first apartment. Lucy defended her dissertation on enzymatic diagnosis of peptic ulcer. I was switched to the study of the kinetic patterns of the growth of experimental tumors and free radical mechanisms of action of stable nitroxyl radicals and anthracycline antibiotics.\n\nA few years later I got a laboratory. EPR spectroscopy of metabolically active paramagnetic centers in organs and tissues, which differ in the rate of proliferation and degree of differentiation, has become a new area of ​​my scientific interests.\n\nHe was always loaded with scientific, organizational and social work. He was permanently deputy to N.M. Emanuel in the Department of Kinetics of Chemical and Biological Processes of ICP. He was twice elected a deputy of the City Council of Noginsk.\n\nThe second daughter, Julia, was born. I love children, supporting them in their studies and hobbies.\n\nNatasha has mastered the line of master of sports in rhythmic gymnastics. Julia excelled in poetry and music. With an interval of 8 years, both became students of the Faculty of Chemistry of Moscow State University. Defended.\n\nNatasha is a laureate of the European Young Scientists Award. Yulia twice received a scholarship from the President of the Russian Federation. They are raising our four granddaughters in their families.\n\nI consider my most important contribution to science to be participation in the discovery of the phenomenon of the occurrence and development of secondary necrosis in gunshot wounds (diploma No. 09/08/1982). This predetermined the creation of new methods for assessing the traumatogenic potential of injuring projectiles of penetrating and behind-the-barrier action, due to the mechanochemical formation of free radicals and the initiation of membrane pathology processes by them by the type of oxidative stress. On this basis, medicinal composites have been created to prevent the formation of secondary necrosis and highly effective treatment of gunshot wounds. The evidence base for this discovery is set out in the monograph: “Gunshot wound: physical-chemical and medical-biological aspects”, M. “Nauka”, 2002.\n\nThe dossier of my scientific works contains more than 200 journal articles, 12 patents, reports at domestic and international forums, as well as 14 registered scientific reports. Recently, several publications have been published with my participation, devoted to the membranotropic stereospecific properties of fullerene amino acid derivatives. There are many students among my co-authors, 10 of whom successfully defended their Ph.D. dissertations.\n\nBoguslavsky Leonid Isaakovich Born November 14, 1935 in Moscow. He graduated from school with a gold medal in 1953 and entered the Faculty of Chemistry of Moscow State University.\n\nHe specialized in electrochemistry. The correctness of this choice for myself, I constantly questioned.\n\nI always felt like I didn't know much. As a result, I asked permission to attend lectures at the Faculty of Physics, which I did. I was lucky to meet like-minded people in my strange aspirations to expand the horizon of knowledge. These were Pavel Zakharov, Valentin Zvolinsky and Boris Zaitsev. They became my lifelong friends. And here in zone “G” I learned the lessons of true friendship and altruism. In 1958 he was distributed to the Institute of Electrochemistry of the USSR Academy of Sciences, where he worked for 30 years (until 1988), having gone from st. laboratory assistant to leading researcher. Academician A.N. Frumkin was and remains for me a moral example of a scientist, whom I tried to follow under all circumstances.\n\nUnder my supervision, 12 scientists defended their Ph.D. dissertations in the field of electrochemistry and biophysics. One of them, Yu.A. Shchipunov, became a corresponding member of the Russian Academy of Sciences, which I am proud of. I have authored about 180 articles, two books and a number of reviews. The main ideas developed in these works are devoted to two topics. The first - surface phenomena and the mechanism of conduction in polymeric organic semiconductors - is reflected in a joint monograph with A.V. Vannikov \"Organic semiconductors and biopolymers\". The second one is biophysical, where different types of phase boundaries, injection phenomena at these boundaries during the occurrence of redox processes are studied, and the role of the latter in biological membranes and their models is discussed. This direction is presented in the monograph \"Bioelectrophysical phenomena and the phase boundary\".\n\nIn 1989 he emigrated to the USA. First he worked as a senior scientist at the Brookhaven National Laboratory in the state of New York, then at the Moltech Corporation, a research company specializing in biosensors and lithium-sulfur batteries. It was based at Stony Brook University and then, from 1995, at the Arizona State University Industrial Park on the premises of IBM's Tusan affiliate.\n\nHere I had to deal with many sections of physical and chemical research, which are usually included in Research and Development: chemical analysis in the research and development of amperometric enzyme electrodes for the determination of glucose, neurotransmitters, triglycerides, a luminescent sensor for heavy metals. Li-Sulfur battery. Electrochemical diagnostics, characterization of the cathode and anode using scanning electron microscopy and confocal optical microscopy. Materials science is a technique for processing supercritical CO2.\n\nDevelopment of pH-sensitive sol-gel nanocomposites for the production of light guides, enzyme electrode nanosensors.\n\nWhile working in the company, he collaborated with universities. While the company was located in the state of New York, with professors from the Department of Chemistry and the Department of Physiology and Biophysics of Stony Brook University. As a research associate, I could have students for experimental work. As an adjunct professor, he gave lectures for students on \"Electrochemistry of membranes\" and \"Enzymatic electrodes in electroanalysis\". When the company moved to Tusan, he worked at the Optical Center of the University of Arizona. I had to write grants to get money for research. I have several patents.\n\nSince I felt the desire and strength to continue working, in 2005 I turned to Professor V.P. Zvolinsky, who accepted me to the Department of Environmental Monitoring and Forecasting of the Peoples' Friendship University of Russia as a professor.\n\nSuch, in brief, is my story, which would be incomplete if I did not mention here that I have a wife, two daughters, and three grandchildren.\n\nBokovoi Alik Bolesov Ivan Grigoryevich After graduating from the university in 1958, he entered the postgraduate course at the Institute of Chemistry of Natural Compounds of the USSR Academy of Sciences, where he worked in the laboratory of Academician M.M. Shemyakin on the synthesis of analogues of the antibiotic tetracycline. He defended his Ph.D. thesis in 1963 and in 1964 was invited to the Moscow State University in the laboratory of Professor R.Ya. Levina. In 1975 he defended his doctoral dissertation, since 1990 he has been a professor at the Department of Organic Chemistry.\n\nMy main research is aimed at creating simple and accessible building blocks, including chiral ones, suitable for use in selective and efficient synthesis of theoretically interesting and practically important compounds;\n\nto identify the key steps in the mechanisms of known and new reactions. Among them are (a) the development of general schemes for the synthesis of cyclopropanes and cyclopropenes;\n\n(b) detection of new chemo- and stereoselective (1+2)-, (3+2)- and (4+2)-cycloadditions of cyclopropenes;\n\n(c) development of simple and efficient methods for the preparation of (1R)- and (1S)-2,2-dibromocyclopropanecarboxylic acids, their 1-methyl analogues and other functional derivatives of cyclopropane, as well as 1,3-disubstituted cyclopropenes as starting compounds for the synthesis of many valuable natural biologically active substances;\n\n(d) discovery of new reactions of 2 acyloxymethyl- and 2-acyl-aminomethyl-1,1-dibromocyclopropanes with methyllithium, which proceed through the stage of diastereo- and enantioselective bromine-lithium exchange and subsequent 1,4-acyl migration;\n\n(e) detection of effective enantioselective insertions of chiral cyclopropylidenes into CH bonds, accompanied by asymmetric induction;\n\n(f) synthesis of natural (2S, 3R, 4S)-methanoproline, other biologically active compounds and their analogues;\n\n(g) development of mild efficient and selective partial and complete hydrodehalogenation of di- and polyhalocyclopropanes in reaction with alkylmagnesium bromides and catalytic amounts of titanium compounds;\n\n(h) identification of key steps in the radical mechanism of hydrodehalogenation of halocyclopropanes using Grignard reagents and TiX4 compounds;\n\n(i) synthesis of a new class of organometallic compounds - organo-gold complexes of the cyclopropane series;\n\n(j) stereo-, regio- and enantioselective ene reactions of cyclopropenes, accompanied by multiple asymmetric induction and of interest, for example, for the synthesis of polycyclopropanes as practically important biologically active compounds, etc.;\n\n(k) stereochemical criteria for assigning the configuration of 1,2-disubstituted cyclopropanes based on 13C NMR data;\n\n(l) highly efficient and selective methods for the generation of cyclopropyl radicals, -anions, and -carbenes from gem-dibromocyclopropanes, their functional derivatives, and organometallic reagents.\n\nTrained at Columbia University in the laboratory of Professor N. Turro (New York, USA, 1971-72 acad.);\n\nin 1986 he worked on an exchange program at the University of New York (SUNY-Albany, 4 months) and at Columbia University (New York, USA, months) as a Visiting Scholar. At the invitation of the Royal Chemical Society of Great Britain, he worked for 8 months at the University of Wales (Bangor) in the laboratory of Professor Byrd in 1993. Research was supported by Russian (Universities of Russia, RFBR) and international (INTAS, Copernicus) funds. In 1998 and 1999 he participated in the work of the European seminar on problems of organic chemistry for postgraduate students and students of EU universities (Socrates Intensive Courses).\n\nAt various stages of this work, his wife Iraida actively participated in it. Daughters Tatyana and Valentina, grandchildren Nikolay, Lily and Peter.\n\nBoreskova Elena Georgievna I was born in Odessa on April 16 in the city of Odessa. School years were spent moving from Batumi to Petropavlovsk-on-Kamchatka.\n\nIn 1958 she graduated from our faculty, she did her diploma in the laboratory of chemical kinetics and with Claudia Vasilievna Topchieva.\n\nFor the first two years after graduation, she worked at the Institute of Physical Chemistry of the Academy of Sciences of the Soviet Socialist Republic, and then fled to graduate school in her own laboratory to the unforgettable Claudia Vasilievna. Her laboratory has remained dear and close not only to me, but also to everyone who left it for the rest of my life.\n\nShe defended her dissertation in 1965. After graduate school, she worked at the NIFKhI M.L.Ya. Karpov. And after retirement, I began a “different life”, but it no longer has anything to do with the Faculty of Chemistry.\n\nWas married, widowed. I have two sons, named after their grandfathers Alexei and George. They did not follow in the footsteps of their ancestors. The elder graduated from the faculty of the VMK at Moscow State University and teaches. The youngest graduated from the Energy Institute. They gave me 3 grandchildren. The eldest Katya is already a student, Vitya is in the class, and with the younger Sasha I am now in the second grade.\n\nBorisenko Irina Vasilievna After graduating from the University, two years later, I started working at the Faculty of Chemistry in the laboratory of adsorption and gas chromatography. Then in 1968 she moved to work at the Department of Physical, Colloidal and Radiation Chemistry at the Institute of Oil and Gas (now University) named after. THEM. Gubkin, where she worked until 1993.\n\nSince the formation of the Moscow City Duma since 1994, she worked there as an assistant to a deputy. She mainly collaborated with liberal deputies. Recently - with a graduate of the Faculty of Chemistry D.I.\n\nKataev. Now, on a voluntary basis, I am a member of the Expert Council on Housing Policy of the Moscow Government. The Council is headed by S.S.\n\nMitrokhin (APPLE).\n\nBochkarev Vsevolod Nikolaevich (1937 - 1999) Milestones of the path:\n\nBorn on June 1, 1937. After graduating from the Faculty of Chemistry (with honors) from 1959 to 1962 - junior researcher at the Institute of Chemistry of Natural Compounds (IHPS), 1962 - 1965. - post-graduate student of IHPS, 1965 - defended his thesis on mass spectrometry of depsipeptides, 1965 - 1969. – junior researcher IHPS, - 1976 - Senior Researcher of GNIIKhTEOS, 1975 - Doctoral dissertation defense on mass spectrometry of organosilicon compounds, 1976 - 1999. - Head of the laboratory GNIIKhTEOS. He has a son and 1 daughter. “He does not need catalogs, atlases and reference books. He keeps all the spectra and numbers in his huge memory” (from an opponent’s review at the defense of his doctoral dissertation).\n\nHe hasn't been with us for a long time. But we, his friends, never got used to the idea of ​​it. He continues to live among us and for us. Only, apparently, he left for another business trip or is busy with business. That's why he doesn't call. But sometimes, it seems that a familiar figure flashed in the crowd. Flickered and dissolved in it. And then suddenly, in the middle of the night, the phone will ring, and a slightly hoarsely familiar voice will say: “Old man, I'm sorry, you like the last joke about the homeless ... Two from the rescue service are raising a half-dead homeless man under the fence.\n\nThey ask him what his name is. He answers - Rabinovich. The rescuer tells his partner that this, apparently, cannot be taken to the clinic alive. He got so drunk that he no longer remembers his real name. I just called Vitka Lifshits and told him this. You should have heard how he rolled with laughter! Realizing that from the position of Sevka Bochkarev and our mutual close friend Vitka Lifshitz, who is exactly through the “f”, the homeless Rabinovich is absolutely impossible, I also begin to laugh at this ridiculous tragicomic situation. And then I wake up from the grumbling of my wife, who, in very polite, and even more offensive terms, reminds me that it is already close to dawn, when all decent people are sleeping peacefully, and that it is time for some to learn to observe moderation in drinking.\n\nBochkarev did not know how to observe moderation in anything. In fact, he was completely incompetent. Therefore, he lives in our memory as the personification of many qualities in all their fullness and limit. Rare qualities, now almost forgotten or ridiculous. For all the unbridled and dashing nature, Bochkarev was exceptionally reliable. You could always rely on him. He was always ready to give everything to a friend. He gave, gave generously.\n\nDolgov never asked. He, like that armored train, stood \"on the siding\" for all of us.\n\nThey turned to him at the most difficult moment. And there was no rejection. Hearing about trouble or need, he was the first to rush to help without a call. I remember that we were going together on a serious winter trip to the Subpolar Urals. It didn’t work out for him, he didn’t manage to go on a campaign. On the eve of departure in the evening he showed up to me with a bundle. Then Yura Chapovsky, aka Chapa, wrote about this:\n\nBut instead of Seva Bochkarev, his high fur boots went on a campaign. In them, Ustynyuk, almost healthy, Started his route from Inta ...\n\nAnd Sevka brought these double high boots from Norilsk and valued them very much. But someone told him about my problems, and he immediately brought them himself without any requests or persuasion. Not legs, but the soul, these high boots warmed all of us, the participants in this difficult campaign.\n\nBochkarev had some special inviolable reserve of mental and physical strength inside, a special energy that was released at the most necessary moment. On Kola in winter it was difficult to climb all day long with a large load. The temperature dropped sharply.\n\nThe mercury-thallium thermometer, designed for -45, froze and burst. Even edged alpine skis were not kept on the hard crust. As luck would have it, not a single “dry land” was visible in the entire district to lay down a node. Then Sevka noticed a huge dry pine tree in the undergrowth on a gentle slope. God knows how we managed to fill up this colossus with our frail, poorly set saw, which was then dubbed the nickname \"jigsaw\". It was possible because Sevka encouraged everyone, persuaded, urged, cursed all the time, while, replacing each other every two or three minutes, we sawed her with the last of our strength. This saved us, because the temperature was already below -50. Returning to Moscow, I recalled this episode many times. He recalled how Zhenya Machigin sawed with the last of his strength, closing his eyes, and then he could not open them - his eyelashes were frozen. He remembered how vodka in a flask turned into a viscous jelly. And then this story relied on paper by itself in the form of poetry. And I sent it on a piece of paper to Sevka on his birthday, Children's Day on June 1 and the \"national holiday\" of our course. A week later he called: “Old man! Got. Touched. I remember.\n\nGod! That was cold! Everything in my pants froze to a crystal ringing. I thought it would never thaw ... ”So only he could say briefly and accurately. This is his style. Here, for example, is a typical telegram of his birthday greetings to his friend-neighbor Chechkin:\n\n\"Congratulations, I wish, I press.\"\n\nFive or six years have passed. He called one day: “Old man, I rummaged through the whole lair, but I can’t find your poems about the fire. Listen, write the words again. Here I want to bring the youth to the tundra. Convincing teaching aids are needed.” I was not up to the fires then, because I ended up in the hospital with an ulcer. But recently, while cleaning out my Augean stables, I stumbled upon an old folder, and in it these leaves. Poems, of course, of a very dubious quality, but for me and for him, and for many of our friends, are very dear.\n\nThat's all that's left for us A mountain of coals under gray ash And yesterday evening it was all A mighty trunk in brown bark...\n\nThe saw wheezed for a whole hour Gnawing it with difficulty And yellow resinous sawdust We were beaten in the face Like a current of warm blood.\n\nHow hard are the last efforts The last struggle with the giant The steel strip has already passed through the body But proud and straight he stood to the end Then he suddenly shuddered, groaned With the last terrible cry he announced the district He fell helplessly and hopelessly Spreading his broken arms And the heavy sound of falling As a shot woke up the taiga And the caps of snow rained down from neighboring pines Like their last gift, like clods of Cemetery earth And in the frosty air for a long time hung a cloud of silver snowflakes .....\n\nThen all of us, frozen and angry Like dogs, barking with axes, Pounced on the warm trunk We beat off the hands-boughs Divided the body into three parts And putting the pieces in the node We lit the fire ....\n\nAt first, he timidly ran through the moss, Licked the bark and rumbled uterine, Then he pounced, And breathing hotly in our faces, Sang a solemn song, Danced, outrageous with sheaves of sonorous sparks ...\n\nWe were saved And the icy dusk of the night With her iron claws In an instant parted before us White-toothed smiles flashed Mugs filled with fragrant tea Perun was gratified as a victim He feasted all night And his mercy lasted until the morning From his feast remained A mountain of coals under gray ash But memory until still keeps the warmth of the fire, friends smiles, their shoulders pressed tightly against each other, and faith in the long journey ahead.\n\nYu. Ustynyuk Bochkareva (Plichko) Galina Petrovna IN AND. Lenin, where she defended her dissertation. She worked with great passion. Created heat-conducting potting compounds for electrical blocks used in space technology. The difficulty was that these blocks had to retain all their properties under strong vibrations. It seems that everything worked out. I worked in this field for 35 years, and then the doctors forbade me to work further in chemistry. I had to retire for health reasons in 1993.\n\nEven while studying at the Faculty of Chemistry, she loved to travel. She went on foot, on skis, rode horses and camels, in cars and on motor ships. She visited all parts of the country - in the mountains in the Caucasus, in the Baltic States, in Ukraine, rafted along the Yenisei, traveled around the Far East (Komsomolsk-on-Amur, Khabarovsk, Sov. Gavan, Sakhalin, Vladivostok). But the most interesting journey was on an icebreaker across the Arctic Ocean: Arkhangelsk, Murmansk, Vaygach Island, Dixon Island, the mouth of the Yenisei, Norilsk). She also visited abroad - Poland, Romania, Bulgaria, East Germany, Egypt, Turkey, Canada.\n\nFrom artistic gymnastics (1 category) there was a habit to be in motion all the time.\n\nIn summer - walks in the forest, in winter - in the parks. I love going to the theatre.\n\nCurrently I am fond of giving - I grow flowers in a swamp, I go for mushrooms.\n\nShe missed our meeting on June 1 for a good reason - she flew to Toronto for her granddaughter's wedding. It just happened on June 1st. Son Alexei runs a laboratory at the University of Toronto. Grandson Tikhon and granddaughter Anastasia graduated from universities in Canada.\n\nAnd great-granddaughter Alice is already a year old.\n\nI wish all classmates good luck in everything, a lot of joy in life and health of course.\n\nMy phone is 464-66-78.\n\nShe graduated from school in Kamchatka, in the city of Petropavlovsk.\n\nIn 1953 she entered the Faculty of Chemistry of Moscow State University and graduated in 1958. It was not easy to study. It was especially pressing that 95% of my classmates are gold medalists and most of them are males;\n\nate physical education in the first courses. She defended her diploma at the Department of Protein under the guidance of Doctor of Science M. M. Botvinnik. Admitted to the Nesmeyanovskaya postgraduate school, where she received additional training in biological sciences: DNA, RNA and animal biochemistry. She defended her dissertation for the title of KhN in 1966.\n\nBut, despite the load, she managed to start a family - a husband and a son. It was then that independent scientific work began in VILAR. The work seemed very easy - cardiac glycosides in the plant world of the West Siberian lowland. Two years later, she went to work at the All-Russian Research Institute Syntezbelok, where she worked until 1972. The theme is protein from oil. It turned out that the analysis of the quality of the finished protein product is a dangerous thing if you find residual hydrocarbons in the finished product. I decided that my work here, although dangerous, is too simple. On a voluntary basis, she began working at the All-Russian Research Institute for Blood Transfusion with the blood of leukemia patients on the subject of the SEV “Restrictases ...” using isotopes;\n\nreceived results that can be interpreted as a viral lesion of the hematopoietic system of such patients. But she did not dare to work further:\n\nviruses, radioactivity, and my family has a second small child. So, finally, I came to work at the Moscow Medical Institute. THEM.\n\nI was born in the village of Lopukhovka, Penza Region, in a family that, on the part of my mother Nina Konstantinovna, had in its roots in the pre-revolutionary period the prayer book of grandfather Ilya, the headman of the local church, and on the part of father Pyotr Gerasimovich, grandfather Fyodor, about whom there was a completely reliable legend, as he crushed the bear with his bare hands. They passed on fanatical diligence to all their descendants. From us, three children (brother, sister and me), parents demanded the absolute fulfillment of all orders. Preparing for a test, an exam, was no excuse for not weeding, watering the garden, or ironing the laundry.\n\nI learned to read from the newspapers that covered one room of our house. From here I still have an inexhaustible keen interest in political news and books about the politicians of my childhood. I sincerely believed that the happy future we will soon enter - communism - needs literate, highly educated people. Before school, we moved to our father's house in Penza, that is, in a closed town near Penza. His father worked as a driver, his mother worked at a factory. I have always studied well. Finished school with one B.\n\nSomewhere in the eighth grade, I developed a keen interest in chemistry. The school course was not enough for me. By all means I got the institute's books. I remember how delighted I was with Academician A.N. Nesmeyanov's textbook for students in organic chemistry. How could I have imagined that, years later, I would be doing my Ph.D. thesis under his guidance?! Of course, I successfully participated in district and regional olympiads in chemistry, physics, and mathematics.\n\nWhere to go - there was no doubt. And so, in 1971, after graduating from school, my father and I came to Moscow to apply for the Chemistry Department of Moscow State University. After successfully passing the exams, I was enrolled among the students of the best university in the country. The second building of the Moscow State University hostel on Lomonosovsky Prospekt, where students - chemists and historians lived, became my second home. With classmates Sergei Eremin and Nikolai Sivov, with whom we lived in the same room (both now doctors of chemical sciences), we have maintained friendship for life. My classmate Tatyana Polyakova became my wife in her fifth year. But for the first three courses, my heart was occupied only by chemistry, and even on weekends, going to an extra ticket to the Bolshoi and Maly theaters.\n\nA bright, memorable event not only for me, but also for all my friends was the potato harvest at the beginning of the second year, when we harvested potatoes in the Mozhaisk region near the famous Borodino field. The collective farm foreman, whom everyone called Uncle Kolya-Communism for his talkativeness and love for this subject, as well as his elderly, toothless horse Nightingale, inspired us, upon returning to Moscow, to publish a wall newspaper in the hostel in our room, \"The Precepts of the Nightingale Horse.\"\n\nLectures on inorganic chemistry by Academician V.I. Spitsin, in mathematics - by Professor L.A. Tumarkin and in other disciplines I attended without a single pass. Viktor Ivanovich's lectures were a celebration of chemistry for me. Professor L.A. Tumarkin at the beginning of each lecture took my notebook with the words: \"So, where did we stop?\" I always sat in the front row at the table next to the lecturer and was invisible to the control. There was a controversy about this. Already before the first session, the curator of the course approached me and said something like this: \"I have never seen you at lectures. I think that you are unlikely to be able to pass the session.\" I passed the first session with A's.\n\nI took inorganic chemistry to a lecturer, academician Viktor Ivanovich Spitsin, who usually did not take exams himself, but used to take part in this process, choosing with the help of teachers only one student for an answer and a long conversation about chemistry. I was that student. Then many were interested in the details of this event. The impression turned out to be so strong that I was always one of the first in the group to take all subsequent exams in this and other sessions.\n\nWhile still at school, I read the book \"The Third Chemistry\" about organometallics. Therefore, immediately after passing the first session, Serezha Eremin and I went to look for a laboratory of organometallic chemistry. The search was carried out according to the inscriptions on the cabinets standing in the corridors, where it was indicated which room and which laboratory the cabinet and its contents belonged to. So we got to the laboratory, which was headed by Academician A.N. Nesmeyanov. Professor E.G. Perevalova was his deputy.\n\nMy first patrons were graduate students A.N. Nesmeyanova Tatyana Valentinovna Baukova (now Doctor of Science) and Dmitry Anatolyevich Leminovsky (Professor of Moscow State University). I learned experimental skills from them and did my first work in the field of gold organics. I wrote my thesis on the topic \"Chemistry of organoniobium compounds\". In 1976, having received a diploma with honors, I entered graduate school at the Faculty of Chemistry of Moscow State University. The dissertation was a continuation of my thesis. Academician A.N. Nesmeyanov was the official leader. Dima Leminovsky, Candidate of Chemical Sciences, was my direct consultant on many scientific issues at the time. I am very grateful to fate that I had the good fortune to communicate with such bright personalities. In the spring of 1979, I participated in the competition of scientific works of graduate chemists at Moscow State University, where I won first place. At the same time, Academician A.N. Nesmeyanov made an attempt to leave me to work at Moscow State University after completing my postgraduate studies. Alexander Nikolaevich wrote a letter to the Moscow City Council with a request to allocate an apartment to a nonresident graduate student, a positive decision had already been made. But the subsequent accident with me and the death of the academician prevented the implementation of these plans.\n\nI was already preparing to defend my Ph.D. thesis, but the unexpected happened. In the laboratory, for unknown reasons, there was an explosion under draft. By a fatal accident, I was in the room and with severe burns was sent to the burn center in Moscow. With special gratitude, I remember all the employees of the Laboratory of Chemistry of Organometallic Compounds, who looked after me around the clock in the hospital: these are Dima Leminovsky, and Serezha Eremin, and Tanya Baukova, and Volodya Daineko, and Vitya Dyadchenko, and Kira Ivanovna Grandberg, and many others. Emilia Georgievna Perevalova, as my wife recalls, helped to get scarce, life-saving medicines, which were occasionally delivered by plane from Switzerland.\n\nThe day of foundation of the Faculty of Chemistry of the Moscow State University named after M.V. Lomonosov is considered October 1, 1929. Of course, chemistry was taught here before - since 1760 at the medical and since 1804 at the physics and mathematics faculties. Back in the 19th century, the main department of chemistry, the departments of technical chemistry, agronomic chemistry, and medical chemistry were created at the Imperial Moscow University. In the first years of Soviet power, great importance was attached to the study of chemistry, and new laboratories were opened at the University, postgraduate studies were organized. In the educational buildings of Moscow State University named after M.V. Lomonosov on Mokhovaya Street, it was getting crowded.\n\n1913: http://oldmos.ru/old/photo/view/104784\n\nAfter the end of the war, it was time to think about building a palace for \"the most advanced socialist science in the world.\" In 1948, it was decided to build a university campus on the Lenin Hills, Lev Rudnev was appointed chief architect. Heavy equipment moved along the streets of the surrounding villages, and barracks for workers appeared on wastelands.\n\nConstruction was carried out day and night, during earthworks in winter, the frozen soil was crushed by explosions. Five railway lines were laid directly to the buildings for the transportation of steel frame parts (this is over 70,000 tons of metal) and other cargo. The construction of all university buildings required 14 million bricks.\n\nThe technical design and general estimate for the construction of the Moscow State University complex was approved by Joseph Stalin, and Lavrenty Beria supervised the project, using the labor of several thousand prisoners in the construction. In particular, the building of the Faculty of Chemistry was erected by the organization of the camp type of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the USSR - SU 560. With such close attention from the \"party and government\", the university was commissioned by the autumn of 1953. On September 1, \"the symbol of the great concern of the Communist Party, the government and all our people for the young people of the Soviet country\" opened its doors.\n\nThe buildings of the university campus were built almost simultaneously, in the middle plan - the Faculty of Chemistry, it began to be built at the end of 1949.\n\n1950-1953: http://oldmos.ru/old/photo/view/199\n\nOne of the final scenes of the cult movie was filmed not near some military academy, but at the entrance to the chemistry department. 1970, frame from the film \"Officers\": http://oldmos.ru/old/photo/view/69422\n\nAt the main entrance there are two monuments - to Dmitry Mendeleev and Alexander Butlerov\n\nDmitry Ivanovich Mendeleev (1834-1907) - Russian encyclopedic scientist: chemist, physical chemist, physicist, metrologist, economist, technologist, geologist, meteorologist, teacher, aeronaut, instrument maker. Professor at St. Petersburg University. Among the most famous discoveries is the periodic law of chemical elements, one of the fundamental laws of the universe.\n\nAlexander Mikhailovich Butlerov (1828-1886) - Russian chemist, creator of the theory of the chemical structure of organic substances, founder of the \"Butlerov school\" of Russian chemists, beekeeper and lepidopterist, public figure, rector of the Imperial Kazan University in 1860-1863.\n\nThe modern address of the faculty is indicated as \"Moscow, Leninskiye Gory, 1, building 3\". Such a street was not found on the map; Leninsky Gory refers to the microdistrict in which all university buildings are located. The Faculty of Chemistry includes several buildings located on the campus. Let's look into the main, five-story building of the Faculty of Chemistry, where the interiors, furniture and equipment of the 1950s have been preserved.\n\nIn the photo: young chemists study the Belousov-Zhabotinsky vibrational reaction. This is a class of chemical reactions occurring in an oscillatory mode, in which some reaction parameters (color, concentration of components, temperature) change periodically, forming a complex spatio-temporal structure of the reaction medium. The reaction was discovered by Boris Belousov in 1951, and is still being studied by many scientists and groups of various scientific disciplines around the world. Students carry out the reaction of oxidation of malonic acid with bromate in the presence of vanadium as a catalyst and iron tris-phenanthrolinate as a color-forming component. Changes when mixing reagents were noticeable even to an amateur in chemistry - the solution in the saucer changed colors from red to blue and back to red.\n\nCurrently, the staff of the Faculty of Chemistry http://www.chem.msu.su/ is more than 1800 employees, including 315 professors, associate professors, senior lecturers, assistants, more than 800 researchers, about 700 engineers, technicians and laboratory assistants.\n\nThe faculty includes 16 departments, which represent all modern areas of chemical science and relevant specializations, in which highly qualified chemists are trained:\n\nAnalytical Chemistry\n\ncolloid chemistry\n\ninorganic chemistry\n\norganic chemistry\n\nphysical chemistry\n\nPetroleum Chemistry and Organic Catalysis\n\nIn English\n\nChemical kinetics\n\nChemical Enzymology\n\nmacromolecular compounds\n\nlaser chemistry\n\nGeneral Chemistry\n\nRadiochemistry\n\nChemistry of natural compounds\n\nChemical technology and new materials\n\nElectrochemistry\n\nDuring the first years of study, students study basic fundamental disciplines, as well as engage in scientific work on the basis of the departments of the faculty. The remaining time of training is devoted to specialization in the chosen direction and the completion of a thesis.\n\nDuring the construction of the chemical faculty building, hollow reinforced concrete beams were used as load-bearing structures, into which ventilation pipes, plumbing, and electrical wiring for numerous laboratories were laid. Entering the building of the Faculty of Chemistry, you immediately understand that you did not make a mistake with the address, it seems that the hoods work, but the smell is specific.\n\nThis hood became a decorative element, initially the system functioned from engines under the fountains, but for twenty years they have not been working.\n\nIn addition to dozens of laboratories and study rooms, the building has three large auditoriums: Large, North and South.\n\nEquipment and interior details for Moscow State University were supplied by more than 500 enterprises from all the republics of the USSR. This plafond is made in Riga. The original wooden cladding has also been preserved in the corridors.\n\nYou can have lunch in the dining room on the second floor, and below the grocery store \"Alchemist\"\n\n-- [ Page 1 ] --\n\nOur home is chemistry classes\n\nschool №171\n\n30th anniversary of the work of chemical classes\n\ndedicated\n\nFaculty of Chemistry, Moscow State University M.V.

O.Afanasiev Order of the Dean of the Faculty of Chemistry of Moscow State University named after M.V.Lomonosov, Academician of the Russian Academy of Sciences V.V.LUNIN September 2004 marks the 30th anniversary of the work of the chemical lyceum classes of school No. 171, which are constantly patronized by our faculty. The work of the chemistry classes of school No. 171 has become a notable event in chemistry education not only in Moscow, but throughout our country. Over the years, classes have successfully completed more than students, many of them became students of Moscow State University. M.V. Lomonosov, our faculty. Among the graduates of chemical classes are laureates of prestigious scientific awards, candidates and doctors of sciences.\n\nMore than 20 graduates of chemical classes have become members of our faculty and are successfully working on it.\n\nTeachers leading classes in chemistry classes have developed unique programs for studying chemistry, other natural sciences and mathematics, they have created a number of textbooks and teaching aids for studying chemistry in high school. The experience of the work of the chemical classes of school No. 171 was repeatedly reported in Moscow and central newspapers, it is covered in a number of publications on the pages of educational and methodological journals. The high level of education of students in chemical classes all these years has been successfully combined at school with good educational work aimed at ensuring that each graduate of the school has strong moral principles, a sense of responsibility for their work to our entire country.\n\nIn connection with the anniversary of the work of chemical classes, I congratulate all graduates and students of these classes, the director of school No. 171 and all its teachers, the team of teachers of the Faculty of Chemistry, leading classes in the chemical classes of the school and wish everyone good health and great creative success in the difficult task of educating new generations chemists.\n\nFor many years of fruitful work with students of chemistry classes, I express my gratitude to the director of the school Lidia Petrovna Karpenko, teachers Belyaev Valery Yuryevich, Gorlenko Irina Vasilievna, Gudkova Irina Lvovna, Deich Nina Sergeevna, Dolgov Vadim Abramovich, Zhiganova Larisa Petrovna, Lapko Olga Yurievna, Romanova Natalia Alexandrovna, Samoilova Galina Alexandrovna, Sokolov Yuri Gennadievich, Spirina Natalya Vladimirovna, Timoshina Irina Vasilievna, as well as teachers and employees of the Faculty of Chemistry Berdonosov Sergey Serafimovich, Grigoriev Andrey Nikolaevich, Morozov Igor Viktorovich, Zhirov Alexander Ivanovich, Churanov Sergey Sergeyevich, Likhomanova Tamara Ivanovna, Sosonyuk Sergey Evgenyuk Kovalsky Kirill Alekseevich, Prokhorova Galina Vasilievna, Rumyantsev Alexander Yuryevich.\n\nIn connection with the 30th anniversary of the work of the chemical classes, created on the basis of school No. 171 by the Faculty of Chemistry of Moscow State University in 1974, I congratulate all the faculty members and teachers who provide a high level of education for students over all the years of study.\n\nI express my special gratitude to the Dean of the Faculty of Chemistry of Moscow State University Academician Lunin Valery Vasilyevich, the Deputy Deans Professor Kuzmenko Nikolai Egorovich, Associate Professor Shtepe Viktor Ivanovich, as well as the permanent head of chemical classes Berdonosov Sergey Serafimovich.\n\nThe main person in the school is the teacher, so I express my gratitude to the teachers of the school, who provide a high level of teaching and education in the lyceum chemistry classes of future Russian scientists:\n\nTo teachers of the Russian language and literature Samoilova G.A., Timoshina I.V., Spirina N.V., Lapko O.Yu.\n\nTeachers of mathematics Belyaev V.Yu., Sokolov Yu.G., Romanova N.A.\n\nTo the teacher of physics Dolgov V.A.;\n\nBiology teacher L.P. Zhiganova;\n\nTo the deputy directors of the school, Deutsch N.S. and Gudkova I.L.\n\nI express my gratitude for the fruitful cooperation to the teachers of the Faculty of Chemistry of Moscow State University Grigoriev A.N., Morozov A.N., Churanov S.S., Likhomanova T.I., Sosonyuk S.V.\n\nAt the beginning of the now distant 1974, the idea of ​​organizing chemical classes at some secondary school arose at the Faculty of Chemistry of Moscow State University. Most likely, its author (or, at least, one of the main co-authors) was an excellent scientist and organizer Ilya Vasilievich Berezin, in those years - the dean of our faculty. One of the main reasons that caused such a decision was the realization in the second half of the 20th century of M.V. Lomonosov's plan on the inseparability of secondary and higher education.\n\nThe idea of ​​organizing chemical classes was supported by Corresponding Member. Academy of Sciences of the USSR Professor M.A. Prokofiev (at that time - the Minister of Education of the USSR, as well as the head of the Department of Chemistry of Natural Compounds of the Faculty of Chemistry of Moscow State University) and in the Moscow City Department of Public Education.\n\nWhen creating chemical classes, the following goals were pursued:\n\n1. To attract talented youth of Moscow to chemistry. It was assumed that the graduates of these classes in the future would become not just students of the Faculty of Chemistry of Moscow State University and other chemical universities in Moscow, but would be informal leaders among students, setting an example of good work, dedication to scientific work in the departments.\n\n2. Check the possibilities and advantages of early specialization in chemistry for secondary school students.\n\n3. Create a program of in-depth study of chemistry in secondary school, which, on the one hand, allows students to form a strong interest in chemistry, and, on the other hand, does not repeat what is studied in the 1st and subsequent courses of chemical universities. To develop teaching aids for students of chemistry classes, which in the future could be useful not only for them, but also for students from other schools in our country who study chemistry in depth or simply show interest in studying science at school.\n\nThe pragmatic task that the organization of such classes was supposed to help solve was the following.\n\nAt that time, there was a strict mandatory distribution of faculty graduates to work. Students who had a Moscow residence permit were snapped up like freshly baked pies; the Military Industrial Commission, the Presidium of the USSR Academy of Sciences, and other high authorities took part in their distribution to work.\n\nIt is clear that with all this, no one provided them with housing in Moscow. The same students who did not have a Moscow residence permit were supposed to receive referrals to various regions of the country, and the host organization was supposed to provide them with housing (at least a room in a hostel). There were difficulties with housing in many places, so applications for such students became less and less every year, and the distribution of non-resident graduates was a constant headache for the faculty.\n\nMeanwhile, among the inhabitants of Moscow, chemistry was gradually losing popularity, and the number of applicants (especially applicants well prepared in chemistry, mathematics, physics) was constantly decreasing.\n\nThe task of the organized classes was, firstly, to prepare a certain number of Muscovite applicants well for the Faculty of Chemistry and, secondly, to improve the general level of training of graduates of Moscow secondary schools in chemistry and other subjects. Of course, it was assumed that teaching in chemistry classes would be completely free and accessible to everyone.\n\nThe Academic Council of the Faculty of Chemistry made an appropriate decision to organize chemical classes at the Faculty on the basis of the Moscow secondary school, and appointed Vladimir Mikhailovich Fedoseev responsible from the Faculty for their work. We chose a school. She turned out to be school number 171. Firstly, it is located in the center of Moscow, near the Frunzenskaya metro station (the school's address is 2nd Frunzenskaya Street, 7A). Secondly, the school was headed by Galina Alexandrovna Rostotskaya. She herself was a very good teacher of chemistry (several graduates of the school were already studying at the faculty) and managed to create a team of excellent teachers at the school, among which one can note the teacher of Russian language and literature Galina Alexandrovna Samoilova (she still works at the school), the teacher of mathematics Grigory Aronovich Yastrebenetsky (he was the only teacher - a member of the editorial board of the journal \"Mathematics at School\"), physics teacher Tamara Moiseevna Lozovskaya and many others.\n\nFaculty members spoke about the plan for organizing chemistry classes at the Moscow Olympiad, spoke on the radio, and used other methods of campaigning among future students. Recruitment was carried out in the 9th grade;\n\nit was assumed that the school would have two classes: the ninth and the tenth graduation. More than 70 people wished to study in the ninth grade, of which about half were selected during interviews.\n\nSeptember 1974 began ... At the faculty of the competition, there were no people who wanted to work practically for free at school, alas. Somewhere on September 10, V.M. Fedoseev turned to me with an unexpected request “to help out the faculty and conduct classes at school for half a year - the chemistry class was recruited, but there are no chemistry classes in it yet.” Well, how not to help out the native faculty! So in mid-September 1974 I ended up at school. Since 1975, I have been entrusted with the duty not only to teach chemistry lessons at school, but also to be responsible from the faculty for organizing the work of these classes.\n\nIt must be said that both the school director and many teachers at first met the “chemists” (both students and teachers), to put it mildly, with caution (which, of course, is quite natural). Years of work of chemical classes passed, until the school stopped dividing students into “ours”\n\nand \"chemists\" and began to treat \"chemists\" not only as the real pride of the school, but simply as their own, \"native\" students.\n\nThe director of the school, Honored Teacher of the Russian Federation Lidiya Petrovna Karpenko pays great attention to the entire work of chemical classes (she, in my opinion, remembers the names and surnames of all chemistry students who have been studying in chemical classes for the last 15 years), her deputy for scientific work, Ph.D. mat. Sciences Valery Yuryevich Belyaev, directors of studies Irina Lvovna Gudkova, Galina Aleksandrovna Samoilova and Nina Sergeevna Deich. The chemistry class was taught in the past and is currently being taught by really excellent teachers. In addition to those mentioned above, I would like to mention here the teacher of mathematics Ekaterina Mikhailovna Sidorova, the teacher of history Zoya Alekseevna Vasilyeva, the teacher of English Alexei Nikolaevich Zachariades (in those years, he, the son of the leader of the Greek communists who were in Greece in the deep underground, had the pseudonym Nikolaev).\n\nMany teachers who worked in chemistry classes received a grant from the D. Soros Foundation (S.S. Churanov, A.G. Osetrov, N.S. Deich, I.L. Golovina, Yu.G. Sokolov, V.A. Dolgov ), T.M. Lozovskaya - a grant from the honored teacher of this foundation, and this, first of all, means a high appreciation of their work by the students themselves!\n\nThe truly maternal concern for chemistry students is shown by the teachers whom the school trusts to be class teachers in chemistry classes. In recent years, these are teachers of mathematics and physics N.A. Romanova, V.A. Dolgov, Yu.G. Sokolov. Over the past three years, teachers of mathematics, physics and biology V.Yu. Belyaev, V.A. Dolgov, L.P. Zhiganova N.A. Romanova, Yu.G. Sokolov received grants from the Moscow government for successful work at school.\n\nWhen organizing the work of chemical classes, it was decided that teachers of the Faculty of Chemistry of Moscow State University named after M.V. M.V. Lomonosov, who have a relatively long experience in teaching. Over the past 30 years, a large number of excellent teachers and faculty researchers have worked at the school. Among them are associate professors Sergey Sergeevich Churanov, Andrey Nikolaevich Grigoriev, Natalya Alexandrovna Dobrynina, Viktor Prokhorovich Dyadchenko, Alexander Ivanovich Zhirov, Igor Viktorovich Morozov, Galina Demyanovna Brykina, Galina Vasilievna Prokhorova, senior lecturer Galina Nikolaevna Kupriyanova, professor Nikolai Vadimovich Lukashev, researcher Irina Vasilievna Tatyanina, senior researcher Nadezhda Borisovna Kazennova and many, many others. These are really the best teachers of our faculty. Many of them graduated from school with a gold medal, and the Faculty of Chemistry of Moscow State University - with N.V. Lukashov, N.A. Dobrynina, G.N. Kupriyanova and others). Of great importance in improving the mathematical culture of students in the graduating class were mathematics classes, which for many years were held in the evenings by the senior scientific collaborator. faculty candidate of physical and mathematical sciences Vladimir Konstantinovich Belnov.\n\nSince it turned out to be very difficult and expensive to organize laboratories for conducting practical classes in chemistry in the building of school No. 171 (fume hoods, compressed air, gas, etc. are needed), students have been doing practical work in the educational laboratories of the corresponding departments of the Faculty of Chemistry for all the years . Here, a great load lies on the departments of inorganic, organic and analytical chemistry, which constantly pay great attention to the work in their educational laboratories of students of school No. 171. I would like to thank with all my heart the heads of these departments, Academicians Yu.D. Tretyakov, N.S. Zefirov and Yu.A. schools. The high level of compliance with safety regulations in the laboratories of the faculty by students, the good organization of the work of workshops is evidenced, for example, by the fact that during the entire period of work of chemical classes in the workshops there was not a single serious accident.\n\nMany prominent specialists of the Faculty of Chemistry of Moscow State University (Professors N.E. Kuzmenko, L.I. Martynenko, T.N. Shekhovtsova, V.M. Potapov, Yu .S.Shabarov, associate professor V.F.Shevelkov and others). The program was repeatedly discussed at the methodological commissions of the departments of inorganic, organic and analytical chemistry, at the methodological commission of the faculty. Academicians of the Russian Academy of Sciences V.A. Lunin, Yu.A. Zolotov, A.M. Kutepov, Academician of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR V.A. Legasov, Corr. RAS G.A. Yagodin and many others. The high level of the program and training of chemical students in these classes was repeatedly noted by both domestic and foreign experts in the field of chemical education. Among them we can note such luminaries of chemical education as L.A. Tsvetkov and P.A. Gloriozov, who repeatedly took an active part in taking the final exam in chemistry at school No. 171.\n\nThe dean's office of the faculty has paid and continues to pay great attention to the work of the classes over the years. I would especially like to note the invaluable help that was provided to the chemistry classes of school No. 171 by associate professor Vladimir Fedorovich Shevelkov (at the time when he was the deputy dean of our faculty for academic work) and has been provided for the last 10 years by the dean of the faculty academician Valery Vasilievich Lunin, his deputies Professor Nikolai Egorovich Kuzmenko and Associate Professor Viktor Ivanovich Shtepa. Their care and support is constantly felt by everyone who works in the chemical classes of school No. 171.\n\nSince 1995, at school No. 171, in addition to the 10th and 11th chemical classes, the 9th chemical class has also been opened. The recognition of the high efficiency of the work of these classes was their transformation into lyceum chemistry classes. Since then, the dedication on October 19 of new students of chemical classes to lyceum students has become traditional. Lyceum classes have their own anthem, in which I personally like the following verses:\n\nWe were born to make a fairy tale come true And make this reality a reality.\n\nThrough the centuries, science will become dust, And our cause will live forever ....\n\nOur sharp gaze pierces every atom, Our sensitive scent recognizes ethylene.\n\nAnd no matter how much they ask us at home, We will leave with honor from any problems ... Hopes were placed on us, And we must justify them.\n\nAfter all, we, lyceum students of Russia, are a worthy change of the country!\n\nDuring the existence of chemical classes, about 100 students graduated from them. Among them were winners of the World Chemistry Olympiad (K. Butakov, 1983, gold medal; A. Churakov, 1985, silver medal;\n\nA. Zinin, 1988, bronze medal; A. Granovsky, 1988, bronze medal;\n\nA. Smirnov, 1992, bronze medal), winners and prize-winners of chemical Olympiads of our country at all levels: All-Union, Russian, Mendeleev, Soros, Moscow city and district. students graduated from school with a gold medal (D.P. Krutko, N.V. Porodenko, K.Yu. Evdokimov, L.Yu. Shvekhheimer, I.M. Dobkina, A.N. Molokanov, K.A. Butakov, T N. Murashova, Yu.V. Smirnov, O.V. Polyakova), with A.V. Churakov, A.A. Vertegel, A.A. Granovsky, K.V. .A.Smirnov, G.I.Kudryashova, A.S.Golubeva, A.E.Voronkov, Yu.M.Ivanova, P.A.Zosimova, A.S.Kalyuzhnaya, A.S.Morozov, N.Yu .Yanul, D.A. Silakov).\n\nMore than 700 students became students of the Faculty of Chemistry of Moscow State University.\n\nM.V. Lomonosov, Russian Chemical-Technological University.\n\nD.I. Mendeleev, other higher chemical educational institutions in Moscow.\n\nuniversity education have successfully worked and are working at various departments of the Faculty of Chemistry of Moscow State University: head. lab. professor O.A.Dontsova, senior researcher D.P. Krutko, researcher N.S. Gulyukina, researcher T.A. Kuznetsova, researcher G.I.Nikonov, senior research assistant M.K.Beklemishev, researcher K.V.Oskolok, researcher P.S.

Kutsenok and others.\n\nTo date, about 100 graduates of chemical classes have become candidates of chemical or technical sciences, several graduates have defended doctoral dissertations.\n\nScientific meetings of students of chemical classes with scientists of the faculty have become traditional. These meetings were attended by Academician of the Russian Academy of Sciences S.I. Volfkovich, corresponding member. RAS I.V.Melikhov, professors E.P.Ageev, E.V.Antipov, L.T.Bugaen"
