        "text": "In This Article\n\nOrigin, Meaning, And History Of Zainab\n\nThe name Zainab is of Arabic origin and means ‘beautiful plant’ or ‘fragrant.’ In Islam religion, this name is closely associated with the prophet Muhammad, as several important women in his life were named Zaynab, including his wives, daughter, and granddaughter.\n\nThe name has deep connections with the Quran. Zainab bint Muhammad was the eldest daughter of Prophet Muhammad and Khadijah. She married her maternal cousin, Abu al-As ibn al-Rabi, before December 610 and converted to Islam soon after Muhammad declared himself a prophet. However, the Quraysh pressured Abu al-As to divorce Zainab, but he refused to do so. Despite Abu al-As’s reluctance to convert to Islam, Zainab continued to live with him in Mecca while other Muslims migrated to Medina. This highlights the challenges early Muslims faced and the importance of perseverance in the face of adversity, while also emphasizing the value placed on family ties in Arab culture at the time. Zaynab and Zeinab are the spelling variations of the name.\n\nThe name is borne by several notable individuals. Zainab Shamsuna Ahmed is the Minister of Finance, Budget, and National Planning in Nigeria.
