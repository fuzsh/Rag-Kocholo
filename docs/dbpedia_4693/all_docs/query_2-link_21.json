        "text": "Danny Abshire is spryly skipping, leaping and tiny-step trotting across his “running lab” in downtown Boulder.\n\n“Think tall, now fall forward,” he says.\n\nThe two ladies sporting Abshire’s revisionist Newton Running sneakers bound across the lab, their well-worn Asics piled beneath a fluorescent display of Newtons.\n\n“It’s like your whole body feels different,” says Lorie Reeh , 49. “I feel like I’m 50 pounds lighter.”\n\n“I can’t even hear my feet landing,” says Reeh’s sister Wendie Henderson .\n\nAbshire nods knowingly, grinning as he adds two more converts to the Newton revolution and his “natural running” movement.\n\n“These ladies are trying to retool their form. They are tired of getting hurt,” he says. “We are trying to get people to rewire their body.”\n\nFor the past 15 years, Abshire has been designing a sneaker that demands a different way of running. He launched Newton’s patented design in 2007, merging lightweight materials with a level profile and external lugs under the forefoot. The shoes encourage wearers to abandon the traditional heel-strike stride for a more shuffling, balanced gait with feet level to the ground.\n\nThe lugs, when weighted, slide into chambers under the forefoot, absorbing impact and, employing its namesake Sir Isaac Newton’s laws of motion, spring back. That dynamic spring makes Newtons “like a mini trampoline,” Abshire says, assisting the “natural elastic recoil of human muscles” and requiring less energy to move faster.\n\nAbshire’s lab features dissected sneakers from the biggest brands in running, revealing how the nearly 40-year trend of adding cushion to the heel has impacted running technique. Some of the shoes have more than an inch of foam in the heel, lifting the back of the foot 25 millimeters or more over the the forefoot. Newtons elevate the heel a mere 2 millimeters above the forefoot.\n\n“I don’t want to blame them, but they just didn’t see how their design was going to affect how people move,” says Abshire, whose 2010 book “Natural Running: The Simple Path to Stronger, Healthier Running” details how traditional sneaker design has ultimately created a heel-first stride that is slow and prone to injury.\n\nCombing a new running technique with innovative technology has Abshire and his partner, Newton chief executive Jerry Lee, sparking the reformation of running. In 2007, the duo moved 30,000 pairs of shoes, priced from $155 to $175, through their website and booths at triathlons. This year, they’ll sell 200,000.\n\nLast year, Newton saw sales climb 27 percent, making it the second fastest growing shoemaker among the top 10 specialty running shoe brands, according to Boulder’s Leisure Trends Group’s RetailTrak.\n\n“Over the past four years Newton has displayed impressive velocity at run specialty,” said Elisabeth Stahura, a retail analyst with Leisure Trends. “Its running shoes posted strong double- or triple-digit growth each year, easily outpacing growth in the running shoe category as a whole.”\n\nRunning shoes sold in specialty retails stores stirred $525 million in sales in 2011, up 6 percent from 2010. The top 10 brands, which include Newton, accounted for 98 percent of those sales.\n\nLast year Newton-shod triathlete Craig Alexander secured his third victory at the Ironman World Championship in Hawaii, setting a course record and becoming the oldest athlete — at age 38 — to ever win the world championship title. On the wall of the Newton Running Lab, a poster signed by Newton-sponsored Olympian Zola Budd reads “thanks for the best shoes ever.”\n\nNewton’s unique design and Abshire’s passion last year drew the eye of Paul Fireman, who brought Reebok to the U.S. in the late 1970s with $60 sneakers that were the most expensive on the market at the time. Now chairman of Boston-based Fireman Capital Partners after selling Reebok to Adidas in 2006 for $3.8 billion, Fireman last year injected $20 million into Newton.\n\nDennis Baldwin, the former chief marketing officer for Reebok whose Breakaway Partners worked with Fireman in the Newton deal, said many people in the running shoe business have been watching Abshire and Lee in recent years.\n\n“They had come an amazingly long way with very little resources,” said Baldwin, noting that his team’s investment includes experts who are helping Newton upgrade material sourcing and quality in Asia. “These guys had the tools and our investment was about giving them some horsepower and connections to push forward.”\n\nLee said he and Abshire chose Fireman from several potential investors based on his success at building Reebok into an empire.\n\n“He was able to take a company and scale it up, which is one of the tougher things to do in a business,” Lee said.\n\nThe investment, which gives Fireman a minority stake, enables Newton to expand its sales team, grow its marketing and keep a steadier stock of sneakers for immediate sales, Abshire said. The cash fueled new hiring that pushed Newton’s staff to 52, up from five in 2007. A wider array of shoes for 2012 includes new designs, some at lower prices.\n\nThe investment marks a validating win for Abshire and Lee, who first acquired patents in 2003. During Newton’s intensive development, Abshire and Lee were close to signing a deal that would sell the proprietary design to Adidas.\n\n“I think we made the right decision to create our own company and our own identity and our own brand,” Lee said. “We are on track and we feel very good about where we are and what we’ve accomplished.”"
