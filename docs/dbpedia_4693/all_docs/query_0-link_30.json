Our mission has always been to support the performance of athletes, and with an unparalleled focus on quality and craftsmanship, we’ve come to set the standard for comfort and fit in an industry all too often driven by hype. We’re incredibly proud of our history and how far we’ve come, but companies don’t thrive for over a century by being content. Whether it’s setting a new style trend, retooling our manufacturing process, or building a new state-of-the-art headquarters, we pursue innovation with a spirit of fearless independence. As the only privately held major footwear company in the world, we’re free to do things our way, pushing limits and testing boundaries as we continually reimagine what could be. After all, the status quo isn’t static. But doing things our way wouldn’t mean much if we weren’t also doing them the right way. We invest in our associates as they invest in us, and as we move forward, we make a point of giving back, supporting communities around us through ambitious philanthropic efforts and involvement programs. We are a company that cares, and our culture is one of integrity and teamwork where together we become greater than the sum of our parts.\n\nWebsite\n\nhttp://www.newbalance.com\n\nExternal link for New Balance\n\nIndustry\n\nSporting Goods Manufacturing\n\nCompany size\n\n5,001-10,000 employees\n\nHeadquarters\n\nBrighton, MA\n\nType\n\nPrivately Held\n\nFounded\n\n1906\n\nSpecialties\n\nRunning & Outdoor, Training, Lifestyle, Lacrosse, Tennis & Court, Kids, Apparel, Baseball, Track & Field, Soccer, Skateboarding, Softball, Golf, Cycling, and Hiking"
