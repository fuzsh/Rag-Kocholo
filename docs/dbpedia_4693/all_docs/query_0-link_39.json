        "text": "As CEO of Kamylon, Chuck has been a hands-on leader in all phases of the firm’s development. He designed its proactive origination system and investment processes, and he recruited partners with whom he established Kamylon’s continuous improvement system. Chuck has served as a teacher, mentor, and coach for the entire Kamylon team, from summer interns to junior partners. He’s guided all of the firm’s investments. On the management side, Chuck has served as Chair of every board of every company Kamylon has held; he has served as CEO of one; and he has maintained direct relationships with all of its portfolio CEOs, working as a valuable strategic thought partner and leadership advisor.\n\nDuring the two decades leading up to Kamylon, Chuck was involved in the investment of over $350 million of equity in more than 40 businesses. Prior to founding Kamylon, he was a General Partner and Executive Vice President of Falconhead Capital, manager of the Sports Capital Funds that invested at the nexus of media and sports, and other leisure and lifestyle industries. Before joining Falconhead, Chuck was a Principal at Veronis, Suhler, Stevenson, a $3 billion private equity firm dedicated to the media, communications, and information industries. He began his investment management career with Summit Partners in Boston, a leading private equity firm, with more than $23 billion of capital under management.\n\nChuck graduated cum laude with an AB in religion and philosophy from Harvard, and he holds an MTS from Harvard Divinity School and an MBA from Harvard Business School.\n\nLelon still finds refuge in writing and in reading philosophy and theology. He and his wife escape to bachata class, though their Czech instructor wishes they’d try a new dance, since it’s been two years.\n\nStephen is a passionate “servant leader” with a lengthy track record of helping LargeLocal companies through challenging transformational stages on their growth paths. As a former military officer and Lean Six Sigma Master Blackbelt, Stephen is particularly adept at building strong management teams, cultivating performance cultures, and institutionalizing the best practices that allow smaller companies to scale profitably.\n\nSince joining Kamylon in 2008, Stephen has held both direct and indirect support roles with portfolio companies, including 3 stints as a CEO. Prior to Kamylon, he served as Executive Director and Vice President of Operations at 3D Systems Inc. (NYSE:DDD), where, over his 6-year tenure, he helped grow it into the dominant player in the 3D Printing industry. Earlier career stops included 2-years leading Performance Improvement at the packaging firm Sealed Air Corp (NYSE: SEE) and 4-years as a project manager with McKinsey & Company. Stephen began his professional career as an officer in the U.S. Coast Guard, where he held key Operations management positions and, as a helicopter search and rescue pilot, saved more than 190 lives, earning 14 awards/medals for leadership and heroism.\n\nGoing way, way back, “Stevie” had his first taste of entrepreneurship when he and a friend started up a commercial lobstering company as pre-teens. Unfortunately, his lack of vision led him to prematurely sell his half (of what grew into a very lucrative enterprise) when he left for college. He has since been on a mission to collect as much material as possible for his planned retirement gig: hosting a podcast to be titled “All the dumb business mistakes I’ve made and what I learned from them, so that you won’t have to.”\n\nStephen received his undergraduate degree from the U.S. Coast Guard Academy, his aviation wings from U.S. Navy Flight School, and his MBA from the London Business School.\n\nOutside of work, Stephen is best known as a retired tri-athlete, retired MMA enthusiast, retired rock climber, semi-retired surfer — and very, very non-retired father of two teenage “theatre-nerd” daughters. When not in the office, he can usually be found either engaged in thespian-parent activities, along with his spouse, Jessica (e.g. practicing lines from Shakespeare or constructing elaborate sets), or hiding from the world whilst on walkabouts with his two mutt dogs.\n\nTom has been with Kamylon Holdings for over 8 years. He first started with the firm as a deal origination associate, where he quickly distinguished himself and within two years was promoted to lead all the firm’s deal origination efforts. As Kamylon’s Director of Origination, he personally trained hundreds of new interns and associates in its structured approach to searching for attractive proprietary deals. Under his guidance, Kamylon’s origination team made direct contact with literally tens of thousands of potential acquisition targets and had meaningful preliminary discussions with thousands of potential deal opportunities. Tom transitioned to a deal execution role in 2016 and has since led several successful acquisitions for the firm. In addition to his deal execution responsibilities, he has been active in the management of select portfolio companies and is currently serving on the Board of Directors for two of Kamylon’s holdings.\n\nAs a successful entrepreneur himself, Tom is the embodiment of Kamylon’s mantra, “investors who think like managers and managers who think like investors.” Tom founded and led his first company, a successful website development and graphic design business, while still in college and has continued to scratch his entrepreneurial itch “on the side.” Taking a page from Kamylon’s highly successful roll-up in the bow-hunting industry, Tom most recently co-founded a consumer products company that provides high quality products to another “passion” industry, the equestrian community.\n\nIn his free time, Tom and his wife frequently escape the city for the laid back, outdoorsy atmosphere of the Lakes Region in New Hampshire. He also spends far too much time at the gym, desperately trying to cling to the glory of his collegiate basketball days.\n\nTom graduated with a B.A in Business Management from Babson College with dual degrees in Finance and Accounting. He is an Alumni Admission Representative for his alma mater, Phillips Andover Academy, and enjoys giving back to his local community."
