        "text": "​\n\nThe experience of other rail trails indicates the proximity to a rail trail has no impact or actually increases the value and marketability of adjacent property.\n\nAccording an analysis conducted by the University of Delaware:\n\n“The majority of studies indicate that the presence of a bike path/trail either increases property values and ease of sale slightly or has no effect. Studies have shown that neighbors of many bike paths/trails feel that the quality of life of their neighborhood has been improved, that the trails were a good use of open space, and in the case of abandoned railways were an improvement from before the trails went in.” Source: “Project Report for Property Value/Desirability Effects of Bike Paths Adjacent to Residential Areas,” prepared for Delaware Center For Transportation and The State of Delaware Department of Transportation, November 2006.\n\nA study published in 2006 on home prices near two trails in Massachusetts, the Minuteman Bikeway and the Nashua River Trail, found that homes near these rail trails sold at 99.3% of the list price as compared to 98.1% of the list price for other homes sold in these towns. The study also found that homes near the rail trails sold in an average of 29.3 days as compared to 50.4 days for other homes.
