        "text": "We are not able to ship to any countries where we have an exclusive distribution partner. Please use our International Distributor page to find your nearest distributor. If you do not have a retailer in your country, we are able to ship to you directly, however, you will be responsible for the cost of international shipping plus any additional duties or taxes when the package clears Customs. Please send a note to our International Sales point person with your order confirmation number if you have placed an order to be shipped internationally confirming you agree to pay these additional fees. Please note International shipments are not eligible for our return policy, at most we can only extend credit in these circumstances. No order is eligible for refund or credit in instances where duty and tax are the responsibility of the customer. All return shipping charges are the obligation of the customer, and shipping, duty, and other charges are not refundable, nor eligible for credit. And Newton cannot be held responsible for an order once it has departed US borders.\n\nWe recommend choosing your Newton based on several factors.\n\nYour foot type\n\nHow comfortable you are with a midfoot technique\n\nIf you have ever worn Newtons before\n\nPrimary use for the shoes\n\nIf you have questions about which model is best for you, send us a message here and we will do our best to match you up with your Newton soulmate!\n\nYou can! We offer two models that work well as both a walking and running shoe as they offer good cushion on both the heel and the midfoot. One model is the Fate that is a neutral shoe and the other is the Kismet which is a stability model for inward pronation support.\n\nThe Fate and Kismet have a responsive cushioning system as the lugs on the ball of the foot are actually based on a hollow chamber with an elastic membrane that will give the midfoot cushioning a slightly firmer and more responsive feel. On both of these models the lugs are beveled and articulated to help rock you forward to hit that “sweet spot” on the ball of the foot. With good cushion on both the heel and midfoot and a less aggressive 4.5 mm heel to toe drop, the Fate/Kismet offer a responsive yet cushioned ride that make them a great option for walking as well as running.\n\nBoth of these models offer good full-foot cushion and support so it is really a matter of which one feels best for you.\n\nWe recommend basing your size off of your current running shoes. Measure if you have a full thumbs width of space from the top of your longest toe to the end of the shoe. If you have that much room, stay in the same size for your Newtons.\n\nOur shoes run true to athletic sizing so most runners stick with the size that they typically wear in an athletic shoe, but occasionally some will move up a half size. If you're having trouble deciding between 2 sizes always start off ordering the larger! Many people underestimate the proper amount of room you need in the toebox and too tight a fit can really affect your happiness in the shoe.\n\nNewton Running shoes are designed to show wear from the outside-in and your unique wear pattern can give you great feedback about your form and technique. Flip over your shoes and take a look!\n\nIdeally, you should see most of the wear centered on the front third of the lugs under the ball of your foot and little friction wear on the heel or toe of the shoes.\n\nFor more information on your wear patterns, check out our customer corner video.\n\nAs you transition to your Newtons you can continue to rotate them with your more traditional running shoes. When starting out, we recommend using your Newtons for 10-15 minutes at a time and your other shoes for the rest of the mileage you want to log as this will help you adjust to the more level platform and unique technology in our shoes. You'll notice that the more you're in your Newtons, the less you will want to be in your old shoes!\n\nPOP stands for Point of Power and refers to the different types of cushioning and level of responsiveness in our different models. This is the “sweet spot” in the shoes.\n\nPOP 1 refers to our most responsive lug platform. The POP 1 platform will have isolated and squared-off lugs based on an elastic membrane and hollow chamber to give you the most responsive ball of the foot platform. Found in our Gravity, Motion and Distance models, the POP 1 platform is designed to give you a highly responsive and dynamic ride.\n\nOur POP 2 platform will feature the same elastic membrane and hollow chamber like the POP 1 platform but with rounded and articulated lugs to help guide you onto the sweet spot on the ball of the foot. Found in our Fate and Kismet models, the POP 2 platform will still offer a great responsive feel, but with a slightly more relaxed ride due to the beveled lugs.\n\nWe offer all customers who purchase directly from us in the United States a 30-day no-questions asked return and exchange policy. This means you can run outside in your shoes and make sure that you love them. If not, just let us know, as we cover the cost of shipping on any returns or exchanges within this 30-day window. Apparel must be unworn with tags still intact in order to be returned for a refund. Requests for refunds and exchanges must be submitted within the 30 day window, contact us if you have issues outside of that and we'll be happy to see what we can do. If Newton determines, in it's sole discretion, that there have been irregularities or abuse in any regard, Newton can discontinue any/all policies for identified customers.\n\nThis policy applies only to orders shipping within the United States, please contact Customer Service to find out more about international policies and please note that free shipping is only available for US customers. See Return Policy, and Terms and Conditions for more information.\n\nUS orders are shipped via Fed Ex and UPS, our standard/free shipping option is generally FedEx Ground or USPS.\n\n*In the event that we fulfill an item from our Boulder warehouse that is shipping to Canada, the order will be shipped via best available option to us and subject to a $10 flat rate shipping fee due to customs and duty costs.\n\n*Please note, we are currently not able to ship to some regions of Canada but if you encounter problems let us know and we will see what we can do to accommodate.\n\n*Due to high cost of shipping, we are unable to ship orders that only contain Apparel/Gear to Canada.

Orders placed during the week after 11 am EST will ship the following day.\n\nOrders placed on Saturday/Sunday will generally ship the following Monday regardless of method.\n\nBut generally to be safest we suggest accounting for 1-2 day processing time before package goes into transit.\n\n*Please note, any orders shipping to Canada are subject to a $10 flat rate shipping fee, and must include a pair of shoes.\n\nExpedited orders placed before 3pm MST during weekdays (Monday-Friday) will generally ship same day, orders placed Saturday/Sunday generally ship on Monday aligning with carrier practices.\n\nExpedited shipping options include UPS Three Business Day Select, UPS Second Business Day Air, and UPS Next Day Air. These expedited shipping options are only available for orders shipped within the United States.\n\nPlease note that the day that you place your order does not factor into the shipping time and that the shipping time refers to business days as UPS does not deliver on Saturday or Sunday. Any order placed after 4:00 p.m. will ship the following day.

It will appear on your statement as a 'pending charge' and is usually for a dollar more than the original purchase amount.\n\nWe do not charge your credit card until your item(s) have been shipped.\n\nIf your order has been split into multiple shipments, we will only collect payment on the portion of your order that has shipped.\n\nPlease review your shipment notification email for details on the amount actually charged to your credit card.\n\nIf you wish to remove the authorization, please contact your credit card's issuing bank.\n\nThe Newton Running Human Rights Production Standards reflect the relevant covenants of the International Labor Organization, input from human rights organizations and academia, and our own experience.
