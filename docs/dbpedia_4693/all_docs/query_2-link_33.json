        "text": "Newton Running has named Stephen Gartside as president of the technical running footwear company. Gartside will run the day-to-day global operations of Newton Running and work closely with Newtons founders, Danny Abshire and Jerry Lee.\n\nFounded in Boulder, CO in 2007, Newton Running shoes use patented technology inspired by Sir Isaac Newtons elemental laws of motion.\n\n“Newton Running is poised for explosive success and growth in the next few years,” states Jerry Lee, CEO of Newton Running. “Stephens background in sales and marketing and his business leadership experience, combined with his passion for running and endurance sports, make him the ideal person to captain our team at Newton.”\n\nGartside comments, “I believe Newton has created a unique product in a big market. The product focus on forefoot/mid-foot running, and patented technology on energy return combined allows people to run faster. That was my own personal experience in the shoes.”\n\nGartside has more than 20 years of experience directing sales and marketing teams for AT&T and Evolving Systems, a Colorado-based software company. From 2003 to 2007, Gartside served as the CEO for Evolving Systems and oversaw the companys expansion to become a global supplier of solutions to the wireless industry.\n\nIn his new role, Gartside plans to expand management skills sets. “We are building a well-rounded team of dedicated employees prepared to take on the challenges of being a small player in a market dominated by a small number of larger companies. When you are a new company and you offer a different approach to building a successful product in an established market, its nice to bring thinking from various markets and disciplines to your team. My job is to build a focus and lead a great team. In some cases Newton may take a different approach to innovate, build, promote and sell products.”\n\nGartside is a life-long endurance athlete who has completed an Ironman and over two dozen marathons. Gartside has a Bachelor of Science in marketing from the University of Texas at Austin. As a competitor, Gartside has personal experience with Newton Running.\n\n“I first tried Newton Running shoes last year and immediately became a convert,” notes Gartside. “Working at Newton is a unique chance to combine my professional career with a personal passion for running. I believe Newton has created a unique product in a big market. The product focus on forefoot/mid-foot running, and patented technology on energy return combined allows people to run faster. That was my own personal experience in the shoes. The following that Newton Running already has in the triathlete segment is impressive. I believe Newton Running has a great opportunity to similarly penetrate the more general endurance running segment. Im thrilled about the opportunity to lead Newton Runnings expansion into a global performance running shoe brand.”\n\nNewton Running has named Stephen Gartside as president of the technical running footwear company.Gartside will run the day-to-day global operations of Newton Running and work closely with Newtons founders, Danny Abshire and Jerry Lee.\n\nFounded in Boulder, CO in 2007, Newton Running shoes use patented technology inspired by Sir Isaac Newtons elemental laws of motion.\n\n“Newton Running is poised for explosive success and growth in the next few years,” states Jerry Lee, CEO of Newton Running. “Stephens background in sales and marketing and his business leadership experience, combined with his passion for running and endurance sports, make him the ideal person to captain our team at Newton.”\n\nGartside comments, “I believe Newton has created a unique product in a big market.
