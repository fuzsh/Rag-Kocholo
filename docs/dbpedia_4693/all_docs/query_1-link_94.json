        "text": "On Friday, Apple Computer Inc. will take the wraps off its first entry into what its chairman, John Sculley, predicts will be a $3.5 trillion industry combining entertainment, communications and computing with digital technology.\n\nDubbed Newton, the pocket-size, pen-based computer is the first completely new product introduced by Apple since the Macintosh in 1984, and the first created since the departure of Steven P. Jobs, the co-founder.\n\nNewton combines electronic calendar, card index, note-taking and telecommunications functions and will be the first in a line of \"personal digital assistants\" from a new business unit at Apple, called \"personal interactive electronics,\" or Apple PIE. No Prototype to Show Yet\n\nBut people who go to the Consumer Electronics Show in Chicago, where Apple will make its announcement, will not see a finished product, or even a working prototype. Apple will show a videotape about Newton and demonstrate the new device's software running on a Macintosh. At a press briefing earlier this week, Apple also showed a nonworking black plastic mock-up described as a \"concept model of a class of device that might be made using Newton technology.\"\n\nPaul Saffo, an industry consultant with the Institute for the Future in Menlo Park, Calif., said, \"This is a gutsy move into unexplored territory.\"\n\nAnalysts who have seen Newton like it, and welcome Apple's entry in a new business, but they also question the size of the potential market for a personal organizer priced close to $1,000. If Newton remains little more than a more elegant version of Sharp's Wizard pocket organizer, the market will be small, they say. On the other hand, if Newton can harness digital technology for nonusers of computers, the potential market is huge.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
