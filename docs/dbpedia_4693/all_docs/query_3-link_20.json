        "text": "Newton Running Shoes are designed to promote the discovery of your best running form. All Newton models offer the benefits of forefoot cushioning of Newton's patented Action/Reaction technology. With the assistance of Newton Running Shoes, running should feel easier and your feet will feel at one with the ground. The end result of Newton technology is efficient, intuitive and relaxed running. Newton Running shoes will promote a change in running form. Your feet will sense the ground faster and the shoes are designed to strike the ground under the forefoot which will get you on and off the ground quicker. This should decrease impact and result in greater forward propulsion."
