        "text": "This entry was posted on October 3, 2012 by admin.\n\nAt Abbadabba’s, we carry a huge selection of “good-form” running shoes. Many of our top running shoe picks (and yours!) are from Newton. Due to your feedback, we’ve expanded our Newton selection even more.\n\nHere’s a small sampling of our in-stock Newton styles and colors:\n\nNewton styles and colors vary by location. Our largest selection of Newton shoes is in our Buckhead and East Cobb stores.\n\nHighlights from the Newton Summit\n\nOur founder and president, Janice “Abbadabba” Abernethy and our Director of Store Operations, Christine Porter, just returned from the Newton Summit in Boulder, Colorado where they learned even more about the benefits of Newton running shoes.\n\nNewton is not your average shoe company. It is owned and operated by happy people who are runners...people who are working to build a product line that will heighten the experience of each step taken, whether walking or running. They are 100% committed to this.\n\nDuring the Summit, Janice and Christine:\n\nheard about the traditions and innovations of the company\n\nwere introduced to new product\n\nparticipated in running form clinics followed by guided runs to help each individual better their running form\n\nlistened to doctors speak in depth about the biomechanics of running the the importance of shoe design as we stand, walk, and run\n\nJanice noted that “The summit was the most upbeat, positive energy-filled seminar I have ever attended. I am proud to be a part of their mission and we usher in the Newton campaign, \"Hello better.”\n\nChristine Completes Chicago Half-Marathon!\n\nIn fact, Christine, our Director of Store Operations, has been so inspired by her Newtons that she began running herself and just completed the Chicago Half-Marathon. Congratulations Christine!\n\nAfter the race, Christine commented that, “Newtons technology made running the half marathon a little less stressful on my legs and body. It made the last 4 miles seem like the first 2 miles. Then to top it off, the fun colors made me feel fast!”\n\nNewton Natural Running Form Clinics"
