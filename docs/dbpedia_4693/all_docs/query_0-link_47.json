        "text": "In 1916, a group of area residents met to discuss the creation of a country club. This group purchased a scenic local farm, and work soon began on the 9 hole golf course called Sussex County Country Club. The original farmhouse was renovated to serve as a clubhouse for the members. Although there have been several renovations and additions throughout the years, the original farmhouse is the core of our current clubhouse.\n\nThe Sussex County Country Club was closed during the Second World War. In 1946, the Sussex County Country Club was reincorporated as Newton Country Club and over the years developed into the facility that we have today. Construction of the back nine began in the mid 1960s and opened for play in 1969. Improvements to the golf course and the club’s facilities have been steadily made for the past 100+ years of Newton Country Club’s existence.\n\nNewton Country Club Dress Code\n\nGolf Course & Practice Facilities Dress Code\n\nThe following dress requirements are applicable to all members, guests, and children.

In order to avoid potentially embarrassing situations, members are responsible for ensuring their guests and juniors always adhere to the dress code.\n\nMen - Permitted\n\nSleeved golf or sport shirts with collar.
