The company attributed the shutdown on the failure to recover the plants' \"basic operating costs\" in the most recent MISO (Midcontinent Independent System Operator) electricity auction.[1]\n\nIn September 2020, Vistra Energy said unit 1 of the power station will retire by the end of 2027.[2]\n\nEmissions Data\n\n2006 CO2 Emissions: 7,943,291 tons\n\n2006 SO2 Emissions: 20,922 tons\n\n2006 SO2 Emissions per MWh:\n\n2006 NOx Emissions: 4,748 tons\n\n2005 Mercury Emissions: 463 lb.\n\nCoal Waste Sites\n\nNewton Power Station Primary Ash Pond\n\nNewton Power Station Secondary Ash Pond\n\nOwnership\n\nThe plant was owned by Ameren. In 2013 Ameren sold five of its coal plants, including Newton, to Dynegy. Dynegy has indicated they want Ameren Illinois to switch into the PJM, so Dynegy plants could sell their power in the higher-paying PJM capacity market. Or alternately, Dynegy would like to see MISO change the structure of its capacity market, including with auctions that look farther in the future than the current setup. Either way, Dynegy would likely get significantly higher payments for capacity promises from its Illinois power plants.[3]\n\nOn April 9, 2018, Texas-based Vistra Energy, the parent company for TXU Energy and Luminant, announced it had completed its merger with Dynegy. Vistra Energy will be the name of the combined company moving forward.[4]\n\nPollution controls\n\nUnder a deal brokered with state officials, Ameren agreed to curb mercury emissions and reduce smog- and soot-forming sulfur dioxide emissions at its coal plants (including Newton) by 2015, in line with updated EPA regulations. In September 2012 the Illinois Pollution Control Board unanimously granted Ameren a five-year reprieve from upgrading Newton's pollution controls, as Ameren said upgrading the facility would be too costly for the company and would force Ameren to shutter at least two of its other coal plants and lay off hundreds of workers.[5]\n\nDeath and disease attributable to fine particle pollution from Newton power station\n\nIn 2010, Abt Associates issued a study commissioned by the Clean Air Task Force, a nonprofit research and advocacy organization, quantifying the deaths and other health effects attributable to fine particle pollution from coal-fired power plants.[6] Fine particle pollution consists of a complex mixture of soot, heavy metals, sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen oxides. Among these particles, the most dangerous are those less than 2.5 microns in diameter, which are so tiny that they can evade the lung's natural defenses, enter the bloodstream, and be transported to vital organs. Impacts are especially severe among the elderly, children, and those with respiratory disease. The study found that over 13,000 deaths and tens of thousands of cases of chronic bronchitis, acute bronchitis, asthma, congestive heart failure, acute myocardial infarction, dysrhythmia, ischemic heart disease, chronic lung disease, and pneumonia each year are attributable to fine particle pollution from U.S. coal plant emissions. These deaths and illnesses are major examples of coal's external costs, i.e. uncompensated harms inflicted upon the public at large. Low-income and minority populations are disproportionately impacted as well, due to the tendency of companies to avoid locating power plants upwind of affluent communities. To monetize the health impact of fine particle pollution from each coal plant, Abt assigned a value of $7,300,000 to each 2010 mortality, based on a range of government and private studies. Valuations of illnesses ranged from $52 for an asthma episode to $440,000 for a case of chronic bronchitis.[7]\n\nTable 1: Death and disease attributable to fine particle pollution from Newton power station\n\nType of Impact Annual Incidence Valuation Deaths 28 $200,000,000 Heart attacks 42 $4,600,000 Asthma attacks 460 $24,000 Hospital admissions 19 $460,000 Chronic bronchitis 17 $7,400,000 Asthma ER visits 29 $11,000\n\nSource: \"Find Your Risk from Power Plant Pollution,\" Clean Air Task Force interactive table, accessed March 2011\n\nArticles and Resources\n\nReferences\n\nAdditional data"
