        "text": "Jerry Lee became a pioneer of the running shoe world in 2007, when he co-founded Newton Running. Known for their colorful designs and revolutionary technology, Newton paved the way for boutique running shoe companies to compete with big name brands on both the professional and recreational running scenes.\n\nJerry kicks off our conversation by telling me how he discovered running after quitting smoking and moving to Boulder, CO. After working in the Boulder real estate landscape for over 25 years, Jerry tapped into his passion for running by designing a shoe that mimicked the sensation of barefoot running. And thus, Newton Running was born.\n\nWe talk about the evolution of the Newton brand—from promoting it at IRONMAN® expos to becoming a well-rounded, highly marketable shoe for all runners.. Jerry also shares his commitment to sustainability, and Newton’s proud label as a certified B Corporation.\n\nIn this episode, you will hear advice on how to buy the right running shoe for you, tips for new runners, the value of an entrepreneurial mindset, and finding your passion.\n\nCONNECT\n\nNewton Running on Instagram, Facebook or YouTube\n\nMarniOnTheMove Instagram, Facebook, or LinkedIn\n\nMarni Salup on Instagram and Spotify\n\nSUBSCRIBE\n\nSign up for our weekly newsletter, The Download for Marni on the Move updates, exclusive offers, invites to events, and exciting news!\n\nTRAIN\n\nMeet me on Zwift, Strava, or Peloton\n\nOFFERS\n\nTake control of your health and wellness journey with InsideTracker, the ultra-personalized nutrition platform that analyzes your blood, DNA, and lifestyle to help you optimize your body from the inside out.
