        "text": "While school buses are some of the safest vehicles on the road, the greatest danger for children riding buses is traveling to and from the bus stop and getting on and off the bus.\n\nYellow flashing lights on a school bus indicate the bus is preparing to stop, and red flashing lights signify cars must come to a complete stop on both sides of the street to allow for children to cross. Motorists should be alert for students walking in the street, especially near school bus stops and always come to a complete stop when the bus displays flashing red lights.\n\nSchool Bus Drivers have a blind spot of approximately 15 feet around a bus, which can be a difficult concept for younger children to understand. Parents are encouraged to talk with their children about school bus safety and the following tips can help start the conversation.\n\nStay alert. Don’t listen to music, text or play games on a mobile device while walking to the stop.\n\nFollow traffic signals and laws. Cross the street at corners, using traffic signals and crosswalks. Until age 10, children should cross the street with an adult. Never run into the street or cross between parked cars.\n\nLeave early. Be at the bus stop at least five minutes before the bus is scheduled to arrive. Early arrival prevents children from running across a street to catch the bus as it pulls away from the stop.\n\nStand back. When the bus approaches, stand at least three big steps away from the curb, and line up away from the street. Avoid the driver’s blind spot.\n\nStand still. Wait until the bus completely stops, the door opens and the driver says it is okay before entering the bus. Do the same for exiting the bus. Be careful that clothing with drawstrings and book bags with straps don't get caught in handrails or doors.\n\nNever walk behind the bus. Children should walk where the driver can see the child and the child can see the driver. Walk at least 10 big steps in front of the bus.\n\nWatch for motorists. Even though motorists are required to stop when a bus is making pickups or drop-offs, make sure children look both ways before crossing the street.\n\nTogether, we can keep our children safe.\n\nUSD 373 Transportation Guidelines\n\nThese guidelines can also be found in student handbooks.\n\nOur first priority is transporting students to and from school safely. With that in mind, the cooperation of everyone involved is needed. Please read the following guidelines to your children and if there are any questions, please call Sheila Zwahlen, Director of Transportation, at 316.284.6505 or 316.284.6506.\n\nThe driver is in charge of the pupils and the bus. Students must obey the driver promptly and respectfully.\n\nStudents are to scan their ID cards when entering and exiting the bus.\n\nPassengers must be on time; we have schedules to keep and cannot wait for those who are tardy. Please call 284.6505 or 6506 if not riding.\n\nPassengers must conduct themselves in a safe manner while waiting for the bus.\n\nNever stand in the roadway.\n\nStand single file in an orderly manner and board in like manner.\n\nPlease do not move toward the bus until the service door is opened. The bus will stop at least 6 ft. from the nearest student. If a student must cross the road, the student should check traffic, then make eye contact with the driver or watch for the driver's signal to cross.\n\nDo not board a bus unless the driver is present.\n\nThe driver will assign a seat to each passenger. If the driver gives permission, the student may change seats only when the bus has come to a stop.\n\nAny damage to the bus is to be reported immediately to the driver, this includes seats that have been cut. Students will be charged for any damage to school property.\n\nWhen disembarking remember the *Danger Zones* and cross ten feet in front of the bus. Observe the directions of the driver; look to be sure no traffic is approaching from either direction. If not crossing the road, move clear of the bus immediately and stay clear. NEVER CROSS BEHIND THE BUS.\n\nWhen loading at Chisholm, stay behind the yellow line for your safety.\n\nStudents are advised to listen to their home radio station for storm warnings and should not attempt to reach school when so forewarned. (Unsafe conditions include heavy snows, floods, extreme wind-chill.)\n\nNo rider shall be allowed to disembark at any designated bus stop other than their assigned stop without prior notification. Notification must be made by a phone call or by email.\n\nNon-qualified riders must obtain prior approval to ride any route.\n\nGlass containers, live animals, pets, balls, bats, balloons, skate boards, or weapons are NOT allowed. If seating arrangements do not allow room for large items, other arrangements need to be made for transporting. (i.e. pillows, sleeping bags, instruments, and fundraiser items).\n\nPASSENGER CONDUCT\n\nPassengers shall:\n\no Remain seated while the bus is in motion.\n\no Remain quiet when approaching a railroad crossing in order for the bus driver to listen for a train.\n\no Use low conversational volume while the bus is in motion. Unnecessary conversation with the driver is prohibited.\n\no Not throw anything out of the bus windows.\n\no Keep the bus clean and sanitary at all times.\n\no Keep their hands, arms, head and feet inside the bus at all times.\n\no Keep the aisle free of feet, backpacks, musical instruments, etc.\n\no Not open, eat, and/or drink anything while on the bus.\n\no Never tamper with the controls or the equipment on the bus.\n\no Not fight or scuffle on the bus or at the bus stop.\n\no Not smoke, vape, possess liquor or illegal drugs while on the bus.\n\no Not endanger the safety of others, or commit acts of vandalism, swear, or use obscene language,\n\nunacceptable signs, or commit moral offenses while waiting for or riding on the bus.\n\nPassengers who fail to follow the above expectations of the USD 373 Transportation Guidelines may receive a bus referral. Consequences are as follows:\n\nFirst Violation – Warning with a report sent to parents.\n\nSecond Violation – 3 day suspension from riding any bus.\n\nThird Violation – 10 day suspension from riding any bus.\n\nFourth Violation – Suspension from riding any bus for the semester.\n\nFifth Violation – Expulsion from riding any bus for the remainder of the school year.\n\nStudents who receive a referral will be off both route and activity buses for the specified time of the referral.\n\nBOE Apprvd 3/12/18\n\nRev. & Apprvd 5/14/18"
