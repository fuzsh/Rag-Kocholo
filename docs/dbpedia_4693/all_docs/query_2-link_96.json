        "text": "Newton Running\n\nAll models of Newton Running shoes offer the forefoot cushioning benefits of their patented Newton Action/Reaction Technology™.\n\nNewton offers both stability and neutral models; your foot type will identify which model is right for you.\n\nNewton Running shoes are designed to inspire you to run stronger and better every day. From a social run to a 5K to a marathon and beyond, Newton shoes will move you with our highly responsive cushioning and ground feel that protects and connects you with every step. Our patented design is built on a more level-to-the-ground platform - like your feet - to support and strengthen your natural motion. Our shoes are light and, we're not ashamed to say, they look fabulous too. Newton running starts with a forward lean and continues with shorter, quicker strides as you land level. Done properly, running feels almost effortless and your feet seem to barely touch the ground. The end result is a run that feels more efficient, intuitive, relaxed, natural and less stressful. HELLO BETTER."
