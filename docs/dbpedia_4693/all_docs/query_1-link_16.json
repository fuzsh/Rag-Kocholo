        "text": "Christoph Janz founder of Point Nine has a knack for spotting winners early. He was the first investor in Zendesk and a tiny (at the time) Canadian company named Clio. He introduced me to Clio - Cloud-Based Legal Technology founder Jack Newton back in 2009. It is amazing to see how far Jack and Clio have come since that time. Clio is now the clear leader in its market. With over 1,000 employees, we will someday (soon, perhaps…) see Jack ring the bell and take this company public. Jack is this week’s guest on The Startup CEO Show. We covered a lot of ground in this discussion: ✅ Jack's playbook for vertical market software. ✅ How he has grown and developed himself to lead a company with over 1,000 employees. ✅ How he transitioned from being venture-backed to having private equity investors. ✅ What it takes to go public now. He's almost 17 years in and has no signs of stopping. This is a special company with a special leader. I hope you check out my discussion with him. Are you a startup CEO? Tune into the latest episode of The Startup CEO Show Check out this episode:\n\nI sat down with Esther Romanoff on my podcast Prodcircle this week for an enlightening discussion on fundraising and venture capital. I had a privilege of hosting her co founder Jeremy Barr on the pod too. Amazing duo. Drawing from her extensive finance background in trading, accounting, dealmaking, and running her own VC firm, Esther provided fantastic insights for aspiring entrepreneurs and startup employees. We covered a wide array of topics highly relevant to early stage founders, including: - Equity dynamics between co-founders and early employees - Common pitch deck mistakes and red flags - The evolution of funding stages and how VCs differentiate rounds - What makes a good advisor vs just a fancy name - Key metrics and milestones startups should focus on - Evaluating product-market fit - Reasons companies fail to scale With open and honest perspectives, Esther shared knowledge that would take founders years to learn through first-hand experience. This conversation contains a wealth of practical learnings on building a startup, crafting a compelling story, identifying product-market fit, and executing successful fundraising. I highly recommend all founders, startup employees, and venture capital interested folks listen to this episode to shortcut your journey. You can find the full discussion the comments.\n\nAnother episode is out on Once Upon A Startup!!

To arm startup founders like you with actionable advice straight from the trenches of entrepreneurship. In our first episode, I had the pleasure of interviewing Brad Messer, co-founder of Structure AI.

Key takeaways from the interview: 📌 Brett shares valuable advice for startup founders, emphasizing the importance of niche focus, risk adjustment, and continuous learning. 📌 Brad underscores the importance of market research and real customer feedback. Before scaling, ensure your idea resonates with your target audience. 📌 He also discusses the dynamics of balancing personal and business finances and the critical role of market validation for successful entrepreneurship. 📌 Be strategic with your resources. Brad suggests considering alternatives like pay-for-performance to minimize equity dilution. 📌 Constantly facing new problems is a sign of growth. Don’t shy away from them—embrace them as opportunities to learn and advance. Brad’s journey from a corporate professional to a successful startup founder is a testament to resilience and strategic thinking.

I love talking to experienced entrepreneurs who have seen companies through all stages of growth. I met Mark S. McNally when I invested in Nobody Studios, which is on a mission to launch 100 startups in 5 years. 100 startups? That seems crazy, but talking to Mark, I knew he’d be the one to pull this off. Mark has experience leading multiple companies from infancy through successful IPOs and bringing visionary products to market across various industries. When we chatted on the podcast, he told me about his 3 fundamental pillars that can make an entrepreneurial journey a success: 1️⃣ Obsess Over Real Problems Success starts by identifying genuine unmet needs and building solutions that directly solve tangible problems people face. While it sounds basic, Mark emphasized that without this customer-centric foundation, you simply won't create an enduring, successful business. 2️⃣ Cultivate a Fearless Founder Culture At Nobody Studios, Mark intentionally nurtures an environment where founders feel empowered to boldly experiment, learn from failures, pivot swiftly, and even let go of ideas when needed - free from stigma. Undying passion and deep domain mastery are non-negotiables. 3️⃣ Crystallize Your Strategic Intent As companies scale, maintaining laser-focus alignment on the strategic vision becomes make-or-break. Mark shared learnings from Airbnb's Brian Chesky on over-communicating intent, reorganizing structures seamlessly, and fostering an almost \"militaristic\" coherence across teams. Whether just starting out or an established founder, you’re going to love this conversation on how to build innovative, high-growth companies positioned for long-term success.
