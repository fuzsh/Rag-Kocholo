        "text": "Why Rapt Media?\n\nNewton Running was looking for a way to show multiple customer storylines in one package, and Rapt Mediaâs multiple-path interactive video platform allowed Newton Running to do just that. Rapt Mediaâs architecture made it possible for customers to self-select the content that applied to them and follow one of those journeys to find the right shoe.\n\nNewton Runningâs creative director, Jake Marty, liked the visual-first aspect of Rapt Mediaâs platform. âIt was nice to build on a visual setting to facilitate a non-linear interactive video build,â Marty said. He also said the user interface for uploading and changing styling was straight forward for what he thought would be a complex process.\n\nAnother reason Newton Running partnered with Rapt Media is for the data Rapt Mediaâs platform could provide. Newton Running liked the shopper insights the experience provided (stability vs. neutral shoes, for example), which the company sees as an opportunity for informing future product development and marketing."
