        "text": "Product: Newton Running Energy NR\n\nCost: $119.00 USD\n\nI‚Äôm no stranger to Newton Running shoes, in fact I‚Äôve been running in these bright little beauties for a number of years now, and have more Newtons in my shoe closet than I do high heels. When they announced that they were releasing the Energy NR‚Äôs, I was stoked to get my feet in them and put them to the test!\n\nSo let‚Äôs get down to the specs. The Energy NR‚Äôs are marketed as a ‚Äúguidance trainer‚Äù and are aimed toward people who are transitioning from a traditional running to Newtons, and also for existing Newton runners who are looking to get that light, responsive ride that we love. The shoes weighs in at a light 7.0 oz, which is slightly heavier than my trusty Distance shoes, which come in at 6.8 oz and the heel-to-toe drop is 6mm. The upper is made of breathable, open air mesh, the outersole is a combo of high-density rubber with a carbon rubber heel and the midsole has the signature Newton Action/Reaction technology and high-rebound EVA.\n\nMy thoughts on this new kid on the block? Right off the bat, I love that these shoes have a less intimidating 5-Lug system compared to the more traditional Newtons which boast a prominent 4-Lug system that for newcomers to the Newton family could view as being very intimidating. The 5-lug system extends all the way across the width of my foot, giving me a more secure feeling, compared to the 4-lug system. The flatter, 5-lug system also makes them a much more comfortable shoe for walking around in. I also really love how soft and comfortable these shoes feel, they‚Äôre like wearing pillows on your feet! When I first put them on I was instantly comfortable, these shoes are by far the cushiest/softest shoes I own. Even though they are such a soft shoe, they are designed to give you a nice responsive pop when you strike the ground in the mid-foot/forefoot area. In my mind, this is a perfect combo of a soft shoe to carry you through long distances and a responsive shoe to help you out on your speed work. Another big plus for me is the upper, it‚Äôs nice and breathable allowing tons of air circulation, it‚Äôs soft enough to wear sockless and has enough give to accommodate my wide forefoot and sexy bunion. Meow! All around a solid shoe!\n\nAs much as I love this shoe I did have an issue with it, an issue which I know others who have tried the Energy NR also had, which was heel slippage! No matter what I tried in the way of lacing technique, and using all of the eyelets, I couldn‚Äôt seem to lock my heel in the shoe. The issue bothers me most when I‚Äôm walking and not so much when I‚Äôm running, but either way, it‚Äôs a problem. I found that pulling the insoles out, which also decreases your heel-to-toe drop, made a HUGE difference. No more heel slippage! YAY!\n\nOverall I‚Äôm a big fan of this shoe, so much so, that it‚Äôs been my go-to road shoe over the past couple of months, I‚Äôve been able to increase my road speed in them and I also PR‚Äôd my half-marathon distance in them. I think they are a fantastic shoe for both existing Newton runners and those who are already mid-foot/forefoot runners wishing to transition into Newtons without the big price tag of other Newts. I can easily say that these will be my shoe of choice for my next road race, even beating out my Distance‚Äôs that I‚Äôve been going steady with for years! üòâ\n\nHave you guys tried out Newtons yet? If so, what‚Äôs your favorite model? If not, what are you currently running in?\n\nxoxo, MLL\n\nLIKED:\n\ncomfort, love that soft ride\n\nbreathability\n\ncost, a great shoe for a great price\n\nDISLIKED:\n\nslippy heel cup!\n\nQUALITY: 4.5/5\n\nCOMFORT:4/5\n\nPRICE: 4/5\n\nAPPEARANCE: 4/5\n\nTOTAL: 16.5/20\n\nxoxo, MLL\n\nEnergy NR shoes provided by Newton Running for review."
