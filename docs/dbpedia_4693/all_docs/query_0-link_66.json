        "text": "According to recent data from the city of Boston, 18,709 woman-owned businesses employ 26,209 people in the city. These women are shaping industries, redefining entrepreneurship, and changing the status quo—in Boston and beyond. Below, meet some of Boston’s female leaders you should know.\n\nMary Alsobrook\n\nLa Bonne Maison\n\nNewton, MA | 617-923-1131 | labonnemaison.com\n\nFounded in 1980, La Bonne Maison was led by Dianne Hartman and Chef Linda Marino. Specializing in private parties, weddings, mitzvahs, and corporate gatherings, the catering company gained a loyal client base with chef-driven cuisine and impeccable service. In 2015, Marino’s daughter Mary Alsobrook and husband Victor became the new leaders of LBM. “We’re taking the company forward with a fresh take on globally inspired fare and a beverage program featuring craft cocktails and organic wines,” says Alsobrook. Growing up in the business, Alsobrook played many different roles, from dishwasher to event manager. She believes understanding all positions is important to great leadership. “I knew I wanted to have my own business and I’m honored to continue the legacy started by my mother,” she says. Moving back to Boston from California, Alsobrook says her eyes and taste buds were opened by collaborating with chefs, restaurateurs, and mixologists. “We’re proud to serve Boston because it’s always been a city with a sophisticated palate and entertainment appreciation,” she says. After 35 years, LBM has moved to a new commercial kitchen, office, and tasting room in Newton.\n\nFranny Andahazy\n\nPBD Events\n\nAvon, MA | 781-848-1665 | pbd-events.com\n\nFranny Andahazy founded PBD in 1985 as an all-female events company specialized in creating props for social events. In the past 33 years, it has evolved tremendously to include a full-service carpentry and print shop, a rental warehouse, and a design office, making it one of the largest and most innovative event companies in New England. Today, PBD serves clients ranging from Reebok to the Red Sox Foundation. As an artist with a background in technical theater, Andahazy saw that themed events were coming to the East Coast from California and saw an opportunity to carve out a niche here in the Boston region. “I was trained to see the big picture, design large spaces, and create themes,” says Andahazy, who also owns a gallery. “Art is my world, whether I’m painting, curating, or designing for events.” Andahazy is inspired by women who go against the grain of societal expectations, from painters Mary Cassatt and Georgia 0’Keefe, who became as famous as their male contemporaries, to Gloria Steinem, who speaks out for women everywhere. “Women should always live with a fearless attitude,” she says. “I tell my daughters the possibilities are as broad as your imagination.”\n\nVeronica Armstrong\n\nLovepop\n\nBoston, MA | 802-488-4335 | lovepop.com\n\nAs the general manager of Lovepop Weddings, Veronica Armstrong says she draws inspiration from customers. “People openly share the most private details of their lives because their unique love story matters,” she says. “We make wedding stationery that is a reflection of the meaningful bond couples share.” Armstrong says her Dominican parents instilled in her an insane work ethic. “The sacrifices they and countless other immigrants have made in the pursuit of better lives for their families are a constant source of motivation for me,” she says.\n\nRebecca Berry, Ellen Anelone & Regan Shields Ives\n\nFinegold Alexander Architects\n\nBoston, MA | 617-227-9272 | faainc.com\n\nFounded in 1961, Finegold Alexander Architects led the way in the early preservation movement, establishing national standards for saving important structures. Today, the Massachusetts SDO-certified Women Business Enterprise embraces the early principles of the firm in its contemporary approach to design for preservation, adaptive use, and new buildings. Rebecca Berry, Ellen Anselone, and Regan Shields Ives actively contribute to improving the lives of people and their communities.\n\nJulie Brown\n\nJB|BD\n\nWinchester, MA | 617-331-5723 | juliebrownbd.com\n\n“Business development isn’t a new concept,” says JB|BD founder Julie Brown. “However, my method of simultaneously consulting with multiple firms and capitalizing on synergies between those firms is unique.” Starting in 2016, Brown became a leader in her field and created a platform to inspire others. She assists clients via tactical introductions, market visibility, and relationship building. JB|BD offers keynote speaking engagements, workshops, and a video series to help viewers overcome networking fears.\n\nBrooke Carroll & Elaine Peterson\n\nLark Fine Foods\n\nEssex, MA | 978-768-0012 | larkfinefoods.com\n\nLark Fine Foods was founded in 2008 and has evolved from a home-based specialty food business to a full-scale commercial baking facility in Essex. At its inception, Lark had one cookie, the Cha-Cha, with limited distribution in Cape Ann. Today, they have 12 cookies in their Cookies for Grown-Ups line, with nationwide distribution to multiple retail channels. Lark’s private label business has also expanded over the past decade and they’re excited to launch a new product line of savory biscuit crackers this fall. “We often heed Eleanor Roosevelt’s famous advice to ‘do one thing every day that scares you,’” says co-owner Brooke Carroll, who purchased Lark in 2015. “Owning your own business is both invigorating and terrifying. Deciding which lever to pull and when, and learning from your mistakes, yields untold satisfaction and breeds confidence to move forward.”\n\nLaura J. Cervizzi, P.C.\n\nCervizzi & Associates\n\nBoston, North Reading, and Beverly, MA | 978-276-0777 | cervizzilaw.com\n\nFounded in 2002, Cervizzi & Associates is a family law firm concentrating in divorce and family law, including child custody, child support, alimony, mediation, parental rights, grandparents’ rights, restraining orders, prenuptial and postnuptial agreements, adoption, cohabitation agreements, and reproductive law. Laura Cervizzi always wanted to be an attorney, and left the demands of a large Boston firm to open her own practice. She says the switch allowed her to be more present in her children’s lives without sacrificing her career goals. Today, Cervizzi brings more than 25 years of experience practicing law, and has been recognized as a distinguished family law practitioner concentrating in domestic relations. “The firm has evolved to where it is today because of the compassion and unparalleled attention we give to our clients that are going through a difficult time,” says Cervizzi. The all-female team of attorneys represents both men and women with hands-on guidance, and believes that both parents’ rights are equally important. “My clients inspire me with their courage,” says Cervizzi. “Nobody wants a divorce, and the strength they show during the difficult process is inspirational.”\n\nKristin Chambers\n\nDA Luxury Travel\n\nBoston, MA | 508-228-6307 | daluxurytravel.com\n\nKristin Chambers founded DA Luxury Travel in 2007 when mass-market online travel sites were saturating the internet. She saw this as an opportune time to redefine the traditional concept of “travel agency” and bring her clients to the next level by offering immersive, tailored travel design and total exclusivity. Focusing on the luxury market and Boston’s most discerning travelers, DA Luxury Travel caters to clients seeking the human connection in the planning process, and leverages her 16 years’ of luxury travel design experience and industry relationships to create exclusive, personalized itineraries catered to one’s specific interests and style. Bespoke travel design is a natural fit for Kristin due to her passion for learning about other cultures, her ability to forge strong relationships with hospitality partners around the world, and her desire to please clients. “Whether it’s working with a colleague in the Africa or Italy, it’s this constant positive energy from like-minded, passionate colleagues and flow of ideas from an array of cultures that keeps me in love with this industry, and opening these exclusive opportunities up for clients,” says Chambers.\n\nCheryl Clarkson\n\nSkinHealth, Inc.\n\nBoston and Wellesley Hills, MA | 617-267-7546 | skinhealthcenters.com\n\nCheryl Clarkson started SkinHealth as a line of high-quality sunscreen products in 1999 after melanoma took her sister’s life. Clarkson made it her mission to protect others in her honor. SkinHealth Centers has since evolved into two full medical spas with physician services such as Botox and fillers, CoolSculpting and body contouring, cosmetic laser services, and hair restoration. Their advanced skin care division is top-notch, winning Boston’s best facial many times. SkinHealth isn’t just our name, Clarkson says. “It’s our passion and in everything we do.”\n\nJane Deery\n\nPGR Media\n\nBoston, MA | 617-502-8400 | pgrmedia.com\n\nPGR Media is an integrated media planning agency specializing in premium fashion and retail brands with category experience in finance, healthcare, education, and travel. Founded by Pattie Garrahy Robertson in 1986, Jane Deery acquired the company in 2008 and has seen double-digit growth in the last decade. “From the beginning, PGR operated as a media-consulting firm that went beyond traditional agency roles by becoming part of our clients’ marketing teams,” says Deery. “Being independent cultivates an entrepreneurial spirit among employees, and this energy drives innovation. Agility and openness to change have allowed us to transform, stay modern, and serve our clients’ diversified needs.” Deery says she draws inspiration from her upbringing and that her team shares a similar mindset. “My parents instilled in me the value of determination,” she says. “I’m drawn to people who share that same drive and enjoy the hustle. We all strive to be great for our families, to give that credit back where it’s due, and to pay it forward—especially to the younger generation of PGR: our future leaders.”\n\nJoanne DiFrancesco\n\nJDCommunications, INC.\n\nBoston, MA | 781-828-0323 | jdcomm.biz\n\nSince 2001 JDCommunications, Inc. has created award-winning marketing/PR strategies to help businesses in the home and lifestyle industries tell their story. Several years ago JDC became family-owned when Joanne’s daughters joined the company after successful careers in PR and finance in NYC. Nicole and Sarah have brought a fresh perspective to the dynamic all-women JDC team and have been instrumental in growing the firm’s services to include events and social media management.\n\nCollette Divitto\n\nCollettey’s\n\nBoston, MA | 857-264-1697 | colletteys.com\n\nAs someone living with a disability, Collette Divitto was inspired to create Collettey’s Cookies in 2016 after struggling to find a paying job. In the last two years, she’s shipped more than 200,000 cookies throughout the U.S. The mission of Collettey’s Cookies is to create jobs for people with disabilities and change public perception to show how capable and talented this population truly is.

Under the leadership of President Helen Drinan, Simmons has stayed true to this original mission, remaining committed to educating and empowering women undergraduate students, while engaging both professional women and men through nationally recognized graduate programs in healthcare, social work, and library information science. Drinan was a successful early adopter of online education, has diversified the school’s sources of revenue, and is committed to operating with financial discipline. As a result, Simmons is thriving. The inspiration with which she has led the university comes from both her background in corporate management and her commitment to gender equity, higher education, and women’s leadership. “We continue to be guided by our core values,” she says. “Putting our students first, preparing them for their life’s work, crossing boundaries to create opportunities, and making a collective investment in our community, on campus, and in the world.”\n\nSantina Giannino\n\nStage It For Success\n\nBraintree, MA | 617-571-3803 | stageitforsuccess.com\n\nGrowing up in Sicily, Santina Giannino always had a passion for interiors and fashion coupled with a strong business sense that, in time, translated into an ability to successfully establish and manage her own business. She took a leap in January of 2016, leaving a successful career in IT and marketing to found Stage It for Success, where she puts her interior design skills to use by staging homes in a way that appeals to the most buyers and gives the best first impression. After she got certified as an accredited staging professional and a certified interior decorator, Giannino hit the ground running, immediately calling, emailing, and cold calling local real estate agencies to establish strong relationships with a network of realtors. “I get my inspiration from hard-working people around me that show commitment and integrity,” Giannino says. “My teenage daughter influences my outlook on life and I strive to be a strong role model and show her that through hard work and passion, women can be happy and successful.” Giannino has settled with her family in the Boston area—where her father was born—and now considers the city home. “In the past three years, the city has embraced the staging industry,” Giannino says.\n\nLaura Elizabeth Gibbs\n\nGibbs & Heinle, LLP\n\nWellesley Hills, MA | 781-371-4940 | gibbsheinle.com\n\nIn 2016, after 16 years of practicing law at large firms in Boston, Laura Elizabeth Gibbs created Gibbs & Heinle, a firm focused exclusively on family law. Gibbs calls G&H one of her proudest professional achievements. “My entrepreneurial and independent spirit inspired me to open my own law firm, allowing me to practice what I love; mentor and learn from younger attorneys; and, be a strong role model for my daughter,” says Gibbs. “I’ve never been happier professionally.”\n\nLauren Goldberg\n\nKP Law, P.C.\n\nBoston, MA | 617-556-0007 | k-plaw.com\n\nIn 2013, Lauren Goldberg was elected as the first managing attorney at KP Law, P.C. after it was purchased from the founders by shareholders. The firm provides municipalities from Williamstown to Provincetown with excellent legal services at a truly affordable price. “We help our clients navigate complex laws while they take on the responsibility of local governance, often helping them lead the way on important challenging issues,” says Goldberg. The daughter of a Boston University Law graduate, Goldberg’s father had high hopes that she, too, would become a lawyer. After working in the State Public Records and Elections Division, Goldberg says it was an easy leap to KP Law. “Later, when a chance came to buy the firm and take a leadership role, I didn’t hesitate,” she says. Goldberg is inspired by her clients, public servants, and volunteers who work so hard for the benefit of all. She’s proud to represent her home state of Massachusetts and share the city of Boston with her three boys. “Massachusetts is who I am,” Goldberg says. “I’ve lived here my whole life. Boston is the best location for our business, central to clients, located off of major highways and easily reached by public transportation.”\n\nLisa Greenberg\n\nLisa A.

Now rebranded as G2O Spa + Salon, Hampers has overseen their Back Bay expansion, a 17,000-square-foot urban day spa resort that includes a cutting-edge hair salon, a guided virtual meditation room, and Boston’s only Himalayan salt cave. A tax lawyer by profession, Hampers was recruited as the assistant secretary of commerce under President George H.W. Bush, stimulating economic growth by encouraging policies that helped small businesses thrive. Now a small business owner herself, Hampers is inspired by her husband, children, and late friend Noel DiCaprio, a Connecticut salon owner who offered sage counsel until her death from breast cancer. Hampers says she’s also been fortunate to be able to surround herself with loyal, capable associates who are committed to enhancing people’s lives. “The secret to success is to find the type of business that you can be passionate about,” says Hampers. “I can take part in really making a difference in people’s lives, both physically and mentally, by introducing them to the lifetime benefits of the spa lifestyle.”\n\nLisa Jones\n\nAmundi Pioneer Asset Management USA, Inc.\n\nBoston, MA | 617-425-7923 | amundipioneer.com\n\nAmundi Pioneer was founded in Boston in 1928, and was one of the first mutual fund companies in the U.S. They have been located at 60 State Street for many decades and have gone through two ownership changes in the last 18 years.

As CEO and president of the U.S. and Americas for Amundi, Lisa Jones oversees a team of about 500 who manage approximately $90 billion out of Boston and Durham, NC, for clients globally. Jones has a degree in economics from Trinity College, and was drawn to the investment industry by the pace, relevance, and drive of the people she met in the field. Early on, she gravitated toward the “buy side,” wanting to understand portfolio management and the client-centricity of the business.

Operating as an investment banking firm, the business has evolved into a boutique firm that is consistently ranked among the top agencies in Boston.

She and her sister managed to make the decks level, even though the deck beams embedded in the foundation by another builder were not. From that early start in construction, Lawson detoured into a more traditional business career, but about 15 years later returned to her first love—buildings and design. She initially had her own small construction company but moved to S+H Construction 10 years ago as a project manager. In that capacity, she worked on projects ranging from small porches, collaboratively designed with the homeowner, to multi-million-dollar renovations. A few years ago, Lawson initiated and implemented S+H’s transition to digital project management and budget tracking, and she has worked on operations since. In June of 2016, Lawson purchased the award-winning firm from founders Alex Slive and Doug Hanna and is carrying on S+H’s proud build tradition. “Design is all about elevating the human experience and bringing beauty to the world,” Lawson says. “What could be better than that?”\n\nJacqui Lewis\n\nAudley Travel\n\nBoston, MA | 617-223-4528 | audleytravel.com\n\nJacqui Lewis first launched her own travel company from her dorm room.

As an entrepreneur, she saw the opportunity was too good to miss, so she came out of early retirement and accepted the lead role in expanding Audley to the North American market. Lewis knows from her own travel experience how much other companies can miss the mark. During a 10-day excursion, she skipped two of her scheduled days from lack of interest. “I essentially threw 20 percent of what I paid out the window,” she says. “That is the beauty of Audley. It is getting what you would like, how and when you would like it, and it is all curated by our specialists.” Offering travel to more than 90 destinations around the world, Audley pairs each client with a country specialist who has extensive firsthand knowledge of their region. Together, they create a day-by-day itinerary with seamless transfers, excellent guides, immersive excursions, and hand-picked accommodation.\n\nKristen Mansharamani\n\nTorit Montessori\n\n300 Cambridge Street, Boston | 617-523-4000 | toritschool.org\n\nTorit Montessori, founded by Kristen Mansharamani, is celebrating its 10th birthday with a present to themselves—an inspiring new facility at 300 Cambridge Street on Beacon Hill optimized for 175 Elementary students, in addition to ongoing operations at 45 Province Street for early childhood. Facility expansion is merely a means to fulfilling Torit’s ongoing goal. Since 2008, Mansharamani, through Torit, has been committed to educating the “whole child.” Steps outside Torit’s doors at 300 Cambridge are opportunities to educate students “hands-on” in history, philosophy, literature and even futuristic ethics of artificial intelligence or genetic activism. Sound mind/sound body is practiced along the gorgeous Esplanade. Under Mansharamani’s direction, Torit partners extensively to ensure curriculum is culled from current experts. Being in Boston makes partnerships a success. Boston also renders it easy to make history—and the students’ place in it—come alive. “It is too frequent that society and schools forget that math, reading, and writing are mere means, not ends,” Mansharamani says. “Education is an ability to think, be humbled, and ‘know what you don’t know.’”\n\nDarlene Murphy\n\nWellesley Asset Management\n\nWellesley, MA | 781-416-4000 | wellesleyassetmanagement.com\n\nDarlene Murphy formed Wellesley Asset Management with her partner, Greg Miller, in 1991 to help investors with money they inherited, earned, or saved.
