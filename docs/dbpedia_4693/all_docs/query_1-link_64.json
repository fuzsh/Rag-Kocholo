        "text": "What is your current role in health care?\n\n“I am currently the managing director of field operations at ChenMed. My role is to lead a team of operations directors who coach and develop our center directors to be successful in running their business.”\n\nWhat stands out as a favorite memory during your time as an MHA student?\n\n“I really loved the opportunities to bond with my classmates, we had an awesome class. I think we all got along really well. We did a lot of the group projects, as well as bonded informally on weekends. Even still to this day, I’m talking to quite a few of my classmates. I think the other thing that stands out to me was the awesome professors we had. The operations and problem-solving classes were great opportunities to learn about different organizations.”\n\nHow has the MHA Program helped prepare you for your career?\n\n“Both of the problem-solving courses stand out. I’ve used and dusted off my problem-solving packet many times in my career. I remember one role where I was the regional manager of clinical operations at an organization in Southern California and we had to create a leadership development course. I used the problem-solving method to be able to figure out how to do that and get the right research questions. I think the other thing that I’ve really taken from the program is the skills that we learned in operations and data analysis.”\n\nWhat challenges and opportunities will healthcare leaders encounter in the next 5-15 years? What skills will leaders need to be successful in light of these challenges and opportunities?\n\n“One of the things that I notice is that value-based care and shifting from volume to value is going to only become increasingly prevalent, and organizations are going to need to grow and scale with this in mind. I think that alignment and figuring out how to make value-based care work operationally is the big challenge of our generation. What I’ve learned in my career thus far is that a lot of the challenges that healthcare leaders have faced are the same things we’re still facing right now, such as providing quality care and a great culture. I think that the other main problem that we always have to figure out as leaders is how do we manage our employees effectively and provide a great work experience for them while improving their careers and growing them as individuals.\n\nProblem-solving is a crucial skill you need as a leader. Another skill is effective communication, knowing how people respond and what motivates them. The last thing is the courage to do what is right even during challenging times.”\n\nIf you could give one piece of advice to a current student, what would it be?\n\n“I would tell every student to not be afraid to pursue their passion, and just because classmates are interested in something, that doesn’t mean it has to be your path. And it’s okay to be different and to find a path that you feel is right for you.”\n\nWhy is your class the best class ever?\n\n“We had a big class and great relationships with one another. We connected instantly and almost everybody in the class worked well together and had a good time. This created a good environment and culture for us as students.”"
