        "meta_description": "In 2011, Cam Newton hit the football scene running as the No. 1 pick in the NFL Draft that year. As previously shared by AFROTECH, the former Carolina Panthers quarterback signed a four-year $22 million contract during his rookie season with the team. What’s more, he had a signing bonus of more than $14 million. Newton previously described the period as providing “the most money that I’ve ever seen.”",

        "text": "“Football’s contracts was always gonna be what it was, but when you talk about everything outside of football — or even investing sort of to speak — these are the things that I was really trying to find out,” Newton shared on the podcast. “Like, is this a good deal versus is this a bad deal?”\n\nHe continued, “And that led me to understanding like, ‘Yo, I got a business mind. How can I start hiring people to take my vision and execute it?’ And I wanted to put language in place that they are protected as well as my business is protected.”\n\n“Full transparency, I put as much as I possibly could in there,” he revealed. “They capped me at a quarter mil’…I tried to invest more, and then, a couple of years ago, I get an email and it’s like, ‘UFC has just been bought out. We’re gonna cash you out for it.'”\n\nNewton says that the investment made him over $1 million.\n\n“I was just talking to one of my business partners in logistics and I was like, ‘Bro, I honestly could live off of $20,000 a month…When you think about seven children, providing for two different households — I have two baby mothers — those are my responsibilities,” Newton said on “Assets Over Liabilities.”\n\nHe added, “I’m lucky to have a pulling cycle that I can pull from and live comfortably without fellowship.”"
