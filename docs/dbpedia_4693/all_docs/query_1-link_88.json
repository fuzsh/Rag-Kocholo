        "text": "Newton City Councilor Rick Lipof has entered the race for the Middlesex 12th District House seat.\n\nState Rep. Ruth Balser announced a few months ago that she plans to retire when her term ends. She’s represented the district, which includes parts of Newton and Brookline, for 25 years.\n\n“I am excited to announce my candidacy for State Representative for Newton and Brookline—both special places for us all,” Lipof wrote in an announcement Sunday night. “My wife and I raised our two daughters here, and I own a small business in town. There is a significant need for a State Representative who will continue to provide bold and effective leadership for our region—delivering resources to our communities, playing a significant role in the writing and passage of legislation, and providing responsive constituent services.”\n\nLipof was raised in Newton, one of five children of Newton Alderman Michael Lipof and Rabbi Emily Lipof (who was the first woman to be ordained in a major Jewish congregation). He graduated from Newton South High School in 1983 and earned his bachelor’s degree from the University of Wisconsin-Madison.\n\nLipof followed in his father’s footsteps and has been a member of the City Council since 1996, when that legislative body was still the Board of Aldermen, and he served as that legislative body’s vice president for four years. He was also chair of the Land Use Committee, Public Safety & Transportation Committee and Real Property Re-Use Committee.\n\nHe’s focused much of his attention on environmental sustainability, protecting green space and funding the city’s schools.\n\n“As State Representative, I will work to advance our priorities and tackle our greatest challenges — investing in public education, protecting the environment, tackling the affordability crisis, standing up for reproductive rights, and focusing on transportation. I will also lead State efforts on combating the rise in anti-Semitism and all forms of hate that have no place in our communities,” Lipof continued.\n\nLipof has owned a real estate appraisal and consulting firm in Newton for 33 years. He’s been a member of the Newton Election Commission and Angino/Newton Farm Commission and serves on the executive Board at Temple Beth Avodah.\n\nHe and his wife, Janice, have two adult daughters, Sydney and Jennifer, and a Cavapoo, Cody.\n\nSo far, Lipof will face two opponents in the Democratic primary: Former City Councilor Greg Schwartz and current City Councilor Bill Humphrey are also running for the Middlesex 12th seat."
