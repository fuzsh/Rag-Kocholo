United States:\n\n“The Supreme Court’s ruling to grant extraordinary immunity for sitting presidents is the most dangerous decision for democracy of our time. This erosion of democracy expands executive authority to give sitting US presidents the powers of a king — which is exactly what our republic was established to avoid.\n\n“According to the Court’s own words, the US Supreme Court is ‘charged with ensuring the American people the promise of equal justice under law.’ With this decision, the court has taken yet another step to dissolve democracy and abandon the American people, elevating the seat of president above the law.\n\n“Our country is at an existential crossroads, and voters must make a critical decision about the direction of our nation. The League will continue to do our part by providing nonpartisan election information for voters at VOTE411.org, empowering voters to send a clear message about the future we want. We urge American voters to turn up and turn out in November to ensure our democracy reflects the will of the people.”\n\nOn June 10, 2024, members gathered at The Social for our Annual Meeting.
