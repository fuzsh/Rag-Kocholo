        "text": "Introduction\n\nResulting in part from the immigration of Chinese writers and film-makers to France, the field of French-Chinese Studies or Franco-Chinese Studies, also called Sino-French Studies to capture the vast array of Sinophone countries, is multidirectional and even more multidisciplinary than that suggests. For instance, chef Adeline Grattard’s Paris restaurant Yam’Tcha embodies the marriage of French and Chinese ingredients and methods. French born and raised, Grattard gravitated to China and Chinese cuisine, reversing the direction of the immigration of mainland figures such as Ying Chen, François Cheng, Dai Sijie, Gao Xingjian and Shan Sa to France, and reflecting the broad disciplinary scope of Sino-French arts. Grattard partners personally and professionally with Hong Konger husband Chi-wah Chan, a tea sommelier who complements her culinary artistry (Figure 1). Unlike Chinese writers who have settled in France, she brought her unique blend of French and Chinese flavours home to France after two years in Hong Kong. True to the plurality of the francophone and the sinophone and to the hybridity of foodways, Grattard’s cuisine, like Sino-French literature, cinema and visual art, is multifaceted rather than binary. I will show this hybridity through analysis of episode 3 of Chef’s Table: France (), which is devoted to her, as well as through my own interviews with her and with Chan and on-site research at their pair of establishments named Yam’Tcha (the more casual eatery or “boutique” and the more upscale “restaurant”). Yam’Tcha entails not just a marriage between two individuals and two culinary traditions, but one which also opens up beyond those dualities. Adeline Grattard’s cuisine makes a strong case for the inclusion of culinary art and food studies in the burgeoning field of Sino-French Studies.\n\nTerroir and Culinary Exoticism\n\nIn Word of Mouth (), Priscilla Parkhurst Ferguson, a sociologist renowned for her work on French cuisine, notes that “in the markedly mobile food world of the twenty-first century, no culinary country operates on its own, if it ever did” (). As Ferguson’s statement suggests, the circulation of food is hardly new. However, the hybridization processes of contemporary globalization, such as technologies of communication and advances in transportation, have led to the “crossing and overlapping of foodspheres”, as food semiotician Simona Stano notes in Eating the Other (). The result is culinary mixing, or métissage culinaire, as Françoise Sabban calls it.\n\nAdeline Grattard’s culinary art, which crosses over most evidently between France and China, encompasses terroir and exoticism, which seem to be contrasting terms, as the former relates to the local and the latter entails the distant. Deriving from the word terre, meaning “land”, terroir informs Grattard’s creations, as we will see below. As anthropologist and chef Amy B. Trubek notes, “In France, terroir is often associated with racines, or roots, a person’s history with a certain place … Soil and roots create the basis for French cuisine as well” (). Although terroir is a French tradition, Trubek argues that it transcends France: “when it comes to the idea that quality of flavor is linked to locally based, small-scale production that pays attention to natural conditions, I wonder if the French have captured and bottled, so to speak, a powerful dimension of taste more broadly defined” (). It is also worth noting that, as Ferguson points out aptly, the definition of “local” is highly contested, particularly in light of the capacity for fast exportation of products in the twenty-first century (). For instance, Ferguson relates the example of fish flown into Manhattan, which is not “of local origin”. However, given the speed with which it can be delivered, one might argue, as the importer does, that it may as well be ().\n\nSeemingly opposed to terroir, culinary exoticism, which the contact between French and Chinese cuisines may engage, entails distance. In his seminal early nineteenth-century essay, French polymath Victor Segalen considered exoticism as an acknowledgement of diversity. According to Segalen, “la sensation d’exotisme … n’est d’autre que la notion du differént; la perception du Divers; la connaissance que quelque chose n’est pas soi-même” (). Decades later, scholars treating the exotic, whether in relation to food or more generally, retain Segalen’s focus on difference. Philosopher Lisa Heldke, author of the monograph Exotic Appetites: Ruminations of a Food Adventurer (2003), states in a subsequent piece on authenticity and culinary travel, “That which is new to us is taken to equal ‘exotic’” (). Comparatist Olivia Khoo defines the exotic as “that which is different and strange (‘foreign’), yet fascinating because of its peculiarity” ().\n\nRecent work on exoticism echoes Segalen’s essay as well as harking back to Edward Said’s groundbreaking late 1970s concept of Orientalism, according to sociologists Josée Johnston and Shyon Baumann. Indeed, Johnston and Baumann claim that, “The foodie’s quest for new and exotic foods cannot be fully understood without reference to Said’s classic work” (). Said’s Orientalism entails the dichotomy between the “East” and the “West”, with the privileging of the latter (). This dynamic maps onto culinary exoticism in terms of what Johnston and Baumann describe as the empowered westerner’s desire to “explore and possess the unknown Other” (). When “Western adventurer” seeks out the food of marginalized cultures, as is most often the case for a “foodie”, according to the pair of sociologists, this desire takes the form of culinary exoticism (). However, key to the present study is Johnston and Baumann’s point that culinary exoticism is twofold: although it may entail “neo-colonial Othering”, it does not always do so (). By contrast, Said’s Orientalism, much critiqued for its essentializing of westerners as well as easterners and for its consideration of the corresponding hemispheres as static rather than evolving constructs, by definition entails the “positional superiority of the Occident” over the “Orient” (). Harking back to Segalen’s attempt to strip exoticism of its “cheap finery”, its clichéd palm trees, camels and black skins (), culinary exoticism may take a more positive turn. Shifting away from the self/other dichotomy even in Segalen’s more positive conception of exoticism, culinary cosmopolitanism, which Johnston and Baumann discuss in the context of culinary exoticism, moves away from binaries and may “facilitate meaningful cultural exchange” (). As they state, “Culinary cosmopolitanism pushes foodies beyond the world of nationally bound cuisine, and embraces both the possibility and also the reality that ideas, people, and their cultural artifacts move more fluidly across borders in the globalization era” (). Despite the potential Orientalist pitfalls of culinary exoticism, both it and culinary cosmopolitanism have the virtue of tending to “challenge hierarchies privileging European cuisine, and particularly French food, above all else” through its “valuation of exotic foods” ().\n\nIf “culinary isolationism is particularly unrealistic” today for “foodies”, according to Johnston and Baumann (), twenty-first-century chefs would seem equally if not particularly drawn to culinary cross-over, even though that was not always the case, notably in France (). Distinct from the “foodie adventurer” who engages in culinary tourism, a chef who travels or lives and trains beyond national, cultural and culinary boundaries reflects what Khoo refers to as the “collapsed distances of globalization” which account for her “Chinese exotic” (). Such life experiences shape the work of chefs in a more informed manner than the culinary tourism of a non-professional. Like renowned Franco-Chinese author and film-maker Dai Sijie, who claims the label of “cultural métis” (qtd. in ), chef Grattard identifies strongly with France, Hong Kong and China and has co-created a mixed family. Her expansive culinary art transcends not only French borders, but also the boundaries of France and Hong Kong or even China. Grattard’s cuisine d’autrice goes beyond national culinary traditions.\n\nMy focus not only on Grattard and her tea sommelier husband Chi-wah Chan’s Yam’tcha venues but also on the episode of Netflix’s Chef’s Table: France devoted to them reflects the importance of representing culinary art as well as creating it. In 2014, Ferguson, an expert on French cuisine, noted “The explosion of food talk in the past twenty-five years – in articles, blogs, and televisions shows, cookbooks and memoirs, films and, yes, scholarly studies” (). Even though her list comprises visual as well as verbal sources, Ferguson emphasizes the latter, or talking about food, as reflected in the title of the book in question, Word of Mouth. Similarly, Sabban supports Pascale Ory’s claim in Le discours gastronomique français des origines à nos jours that “il n’est pas de gastronomie sans discours qui l’accompagne” (). In calling for a semiotics of food, Stano shifts the attention to visual as well as verbal signification (). Returning to Ferguson’s referencing of not only articles, blogs, cookbooks, memoirs and scholarly studies, but also television shows and films, I underscore the role of visual media in disseminating not only cuisine but also food culture. Sabban argues that “l’art de la bonne chère n’acquiert pas la réputation nécessaire à sa diffusion, et il reste confiné au groupe des heureux mangeurs qui en font l’expérience”. Although Grattard by no means aimed to spread the word about Yam’Tcha, the Netflix episode indeed had that effect, to the point where it became difficult to secure a reservation at the starred venue (interview 28 Nov. 2017), I suggest that the Michelin star and Netflix episode helped make Adeline Grattard’s name, despite her modesty and lack of interest in celebrity. Netflix and the media more generally have the power to disseminate the little-known phenomenon of Franco-Chinese aesthetic and cultural interplay, which has more generally taken a turn towards the visual in the last decade, as Rosalind Silvester and Guillaume Thouroude point out, and specifically in the context of culinary art.\n\nVariations on a Theme\n\nBoth Yam’Tcha and Chef’s Table comprise variations on a theme. The central Parisian restaurant opened in 2009 in a narrow, stone-walled space accommodating up to twenty guests on the rue Sauval in Les Halles, the central Paris neighbourhood which, until 1973, housed the historic market made famous by Zola’s novel, Le ventre de Paris. When the quickly earned Michelin star (2010) increased demand beyond the already full house (Grattard interview 28 Nov. 2017), Grattard and Chan rehoused the restaurant around the corner on the rue Saint-Honoré, repurposing the original locale for the “Yam’Tcha Boutique”, a more casual drop-in bao- and tea-focused establishment. Grattard’s culinary art shapes the restaurant and the boutique alike, as Chan’s expertise in tea benefits both venues (Figure 2). The on-site labour is divided, Grattard helming the restaurant and Chan taking charge of the boutique, with teams at each locale. The “Yam’Tcha” in the name of the couple’s first two venues evokes the Cantonese “yum cha”, referring to what is called “dim sum” in the United States. Lai’Tcha, Grattard and Chan’s third venue, offers a variation on Yam’Tcha. Designating “milk tea”, Lai’Tcha is a self-proclaimed “traiteur chinois”, a Chinese “delicatessen” or take-out venue, as indicated on the Yam’Tcha website (www.yamtcha.com). The more relevant point here is that Lai’Tcha includes distinctly mainland Chinese dishes such as “Chengdu dumplings” but expands beyond the Chinese offerings of the pair of Yam’Tcha venues towards Southeast Asian dishes such as “nems,” as Vietnamese egg rolls are known in French, as well as Singapore vegetables. As Grattard herself put it months before the venue opened, Lai’Tcha is “moins ciblé chinois – plus Asie du Sud Est” (interview 28 Nov. 2017).\n\nLike the triad of Grattard and Chan’s venues, Netflix’s Chef’s Table documentary series offers variations on a theme. David Gelb, director of the documentary Jiro: Dreams of Sushi (2011), directs some of the episodes. However, Andrew Fried, whose production company Boardwalk Pictures created the Chef’s Table series, helms the Adeline Grattard episode. Chef’s Table, the first made-for-Netflix docuseries, according to , has garnered numerous awards. Each episode of the six-season run of Chef’s Table thus far, renewed for an additional two seasons, features a chef and the story of their culinary art (). Released between Volume 2 (2016) and Volume 3 (2017) of the main Chef’s Table series, Chef’s Table: France is a one-season 2016 limited series comprising four episodes, the third of which is devoted to Adeline Grattard. The importance of the series format lies in the formulaic elements of the episodes, such as the brief title sequence one or two minutes into each one. The title sequences of the Chef’s Table episodes share the music of contemporary British-German composer Max Richter, but not the images seen in Chef’s Table: France. The latter’s four episodes have identical title sequences of the chefs in this quartet of documentaries and their work. The repetition and uniformity across the episodes contrast Grattard’s spontaneous, recipe-free cheffing and her cuisine métissée, which we will explore below, as opposed to the more French-focused cuisine of the three other French chefs (Alain Passard, Alexandre Couillon and Michel Troisgros), who are all male.\n\nIronically, in the soundtrack for episode 3 of Chef’s Table: France, as in that of the other episodes, European classical music helps dramatize the cinematic representation of Grattard’s culinary métissage or mixing of Chinese, French and other ingredients, tools and methods and cultures across a putative East–West divide. The dissonance between the “western” music and the auteur cuisine transcending the French–Chinese binary makes the case for a move beyond European classics and East–West dualities in the contemporary transnational context. In the title sequence of all four episodes, an image of the Eiffel Tower, a flash shot of the most iconic French monument, small but with its lights flashing, acts as a foil to Grattard’s cuisine, which is métissée, not French. Ironically, the Eiffel Tower serves to counter contemporary culinary mixing or transnationalism, not to affirm Frenchness. The monument also appears illuminated against not only the Paris cityscape but also ominous clouds, the darkness of which reflects the flaws of the Michelin paradigm, while François Simon offers a verbal critique of it, simultaneously. In the next shot, the clouds disappear as Simon introduces his statement that Michelin is stuck in the twentieth century. The Eiffel Tower functions as a relic of the past. Meanwhile, Grattard’s award-winning cheffing represents the twenty-first century. Like her marriage to Chi-wah Chan, Adeline Grattard embodies what Simon calls a “histoire de cœur entre France et Hong Kong” (). Nothing about Grattard or her cooking is as strictly western as the music for the episode devoted to her. This might be explained at least in part by its inclusion in the Chef’s Table: France series. Even if, as suggests and to the limited series’s credit, “Chef’s Table: France seems determined to disrupt the art of French cooking, focusing on chefs who are subverting the country’s traditions in their own distinct ways”, Grattard is alone among the four French chefs to unsettle French gastronomy by inflecting it with Chinese culinary art.\n\nThe Vivaldi-like music accompanying the title images is actually Richter’s “Winter”, a re-composition of part of Vivaldi’s Four Seasons. The musical credits for episode 3, devoted to Grattard, feature the work of Czech composer Bedrich Smetana, German composers Beethoven and Robert Schumann, and Polish-born French immigrant Frédéric Chopin. The classical, Romantic and modernist music dramatizes the segment with distinctly European tones. By contrast, Grattard’s culinary art transcends the alleged East–West binary harking back to Said’s Orientalism. The opening sequences of the Chef’s Table: France episode 3 are set in Hong Kong, a quintessentially cosmopolitan, global city state handed back to mainland China by the British only a quarter century ago. The first shot offers a view of a visually and sonically lively narrow street of Kowloon, the “Chinese side” of the city state, flanked by old apartment buildings with store signs in Chinese characters on the ground floor, and featuring a couple more modern skyscrapers in the background. Cars outnumber pedestrians and the diagonal perspective of a single oncoming bus, recalling the Lumière Brothers’ Arrivée d’un train (Arrival of a Train, 1895), creates a sense of depth, evoking the richness of the exterior Hong Kong Chinese locale.\n\nTransporting Tea and Cuisine\n\nWith the shift to an interior, the focus turns to tea, from a Hong Kong perspective in terms of the source, type, wares and service, including Chan’s expertise. At this early point of the documentary, the chef remains the focal point through which we learn about the tea sommelier. A cut takes us to the interior of the LockCha Tea House and a back view of Grattard, shoulders up, facing and approaching the wares on display on open shelves. Another cut moves into a series of close-ups featuring teacups in terra cotta and porcelain decorated with Chinese visual motifs, then a duo of Pu-erh (aged, smoked) tea cakes sitting side by side, reflecting the partnership between Grattard and Chi-wah Chan. The opening voice-over is Grattard’s, but Chan and his area of expertise are the subject: “Mon mari Chi-wah, c’est lui à 100% qui sélectionne les thés et achète le matériel pour le restaurant”. Grattard takes control of the narrative through her voice-over just as she takes charge of the cuisine of the couple’s restaurants. Visuals of the chef and the tea sommelier seated side by side, sipping the tea served by Wing Chi Ip, the founder of LockCha Tea House, accompany her voice-over. This sequence marries image and sound (dialogue), paralleling the couple’s culinary and personal partnership, and the blending of French and Chinese “notes” (Grattard interview 28 Nov. 2017). Introducing the Grattard episode through tea suggests notably that transcultural exchange entails a crucial component of the culinary, writ large to encompass food, drink and, last but certainly not least, the interpersonal interactions involved in their creation.\n\nSituating the opening of this episode of Chef’s Table: France in Hong Kong and placing Hong Konger Chan alongside his French wife establishes the transcultural dimension of Grattard’s culinary art, while pointing out cultural differences impacting the culinary experience of consumption immediately thereafter. From Hong Kong, where the crew spent several days with Grattard and Chan, and specifically inside the tea shop, Grattard notes the power of tea: “ça rend dingue, c’est magnifique” (). Grattard stresses that tea has mind-altering effects, inducing intoxication: “on est complètement défoncé”, she says not once, but twice. She describes the physical sensations of shaking, head spinning and heart pounding, due to the caffeine (théïne). For our purposes, the relevant point is that although caffeine affects the tea drinker in Paris as in Hong Kong, presumably, the site-specific experience goes beyond this ingredient or any other. The shot of Grattard describing the effects of tea drinking cuts to an image of the camera panning up her body from behind, as she walks on a dark street in Paris. The camera stops at a low angle, still capturing the chef’s image from below, empowering her. After a quick cut, she appears frontally, saying, “c’est quelque chose qui est très dur à reproduire à Paris”. The slow-motion effect introduced at this point conjures up cinematically the magical experience of inebriation that she aims to reproduce in Paris despite the challenges of overcoming cultural difference, which makes the Hong Kong tea-drinking experience unique. Grattard walking in slow motion also contrasts the fast-motion of the images of the subsequent title credits, uniform in sound and image across the four episodes of the Chef’s Table: France mini-series. The fast-motion images are also synchronized with the fast-paced violin music from Richter’s “Winter” accompanying the setting of the white-clothed table and subsequent quick succession of shots in each episode of Chef’s Table: France. Although the same title images are used for all four episodes, several feature a pan or a plate spinning around, echoing Grattard’s description of the “tête qui tourne” from drinking tea.\n\nWalter Benjamin’s concept of the “aura” helps explain the challenge if not the impossibility of creating the identical experience when serving and consuming tea in different cultural and geographic contexts. Benjamin defines the “aura” as “that which withers in the age of mechanical reproduction”, since “the technique of reproduction detaches the reproduced object from the domain of tradition”, which erases a “unique existence” (). Thus, for instance, painting distinguishes the original from the copy, in part due to the place where the work of art is displayed. Similarly, the site where tea is grown, prepared and served, encompassing factors such as history, culture and ambiance, precludes exact reproduction in another context, making it more akin to translation than imitation. The ineffable, tantamount to Benjamin’s aura, defies reproduction. Grattard notes that when she lived in Hong Kong, humidity, which influences taste, made her realize why Hong Kongers consume soup, tofu and “dried things”. The chef notably uses the word “reproduce” as opposed to the word “translate”. However, she also acknowledges the difficulty of reproducing the effect of tea drinking, which might be extrapolated to eating Chinese food or specifically Cantonese food, the regional cuisine of Hong Kong and parts of adjacent southern China, such as Guangzhou, formerly known as “Canton”. Grattard also further qualifies her comment by stressing that she will “try” to reproduce it, underscoring the challenge (). Notably, in Chinese culture and history, imitation is highly valued. Ultimately, though, in her restaurant(s), she innovates boldly rather than reproduces.\n\nComplicating the strictly Chinese teas, serving them in Paris, alongside Grattard’s cuisine, reflects the two primary cuisines and cultures with which she identifies and which the restaurant combines: French and Chinese. In the option for tea or wine pairing, the expected duality between Chinese teas and French wines is partly upheld. As a tea drinker who had already enjoyed sommelier Chan’s finely curated, brewed and poured teas seated at the long shared table at the Boutique Yam’Tcha around the corner when I lunched there on 27 September 2017, I opted for the tea pairing at the restaurant. All four pours were Chinese teas, upholding the “national purity” of the tea pairing, and reflecting Chan’s focus and expertise. Chan refuses to satisfy requests for sugar for clients seeking to sweeten their tea (interview 17 Sept. 2017). The teas reflected diversity of type rather than diversity of national origins: from the aged, smoked, Pu Erh tea accompanying the first course; to the Shuixian, an oolong rock tea from the Wuyi Mountains in Fujian province; to the “Misty Cloud” green; and, finally, the Fujian black accompanying the dessert. By contrast, though France is certainly as reputed for its wines as China is for its teas, the wine pairings split evenly between French (a white from the Loire Valley and a dessert red from the Pyrénées) and varietals (a Sicilian red, a Port) from other European nations (Italy, Portugal). Yam’Tcha does not hesitate to complicate the French–Chinese binary that provides its point of origin, be it through drink or food, or to cross borders of all kinds, including national boundaries. One might presume that tea pairing aligns with the Chinese dimension while wine pairing is French. However, offering a tea pairing for each course of a high-end restaurant meal is original and innovative, not Chinese.\n\nThe Exotic “Other”\n\nUnlike the writers, graphic novelists and visual artists discussed in this volume, Grattard was born and raised in France to French parents. From Dijon, she learned to appreciate tastes and flavours from the garden which her parents still cultivate, growing their own produce in the Burgundy countryside, as she states in the Chef’s Table episode. As a child, she spent Sundays picking and pitting cherries (). She also enjoyed pretending to do a television cooking show, following recipes, something she later veered away from. Grattard recalls fondly that as a little girl, she organized herbs and other products on the table with a red-chequered tablecloth which, I would add, is quintessentially French. As a child, she aspired to be a surgeon, then at university studied to be a German teacher but, lacking motivation, shifted her sights on culinary school. She trained at the École Ferrandi, a renowned French culinary school, where she learned traditional techniques such as julienne, découpes and taillages and, alternating with classroom study, interned at Michelin-starred restaurants ().\n\nGrattard admits her “goût d’exotisme” (). This penchant explains her attraction to Chinese culture and cuisines, which differ from French ones and are thus “exotic”, in Segalen’s aforementioned positive sense emphasizing difference. Reflecting on her fascination with China, Grattard states, “même si j’ai vécu en France, j’avais une attirance énorme pour la Chine”. I would question the “même si” in Grattard’s comment, since the attraction is precisely for the Other. Answering his own question, Joshua David Stein considers Grattard’s version of exoticism positive, as I would agree: “At what point does the fetishization of the other transcend exotisme into a true and genuine appreciation? The answer is, as the episode makes clear, at Yam’Tcha, where Grattard wraps French and Chinese culinary traditions one within the other.” She eliminates the distance by connecting with Hong Kongers and Chinese people in Hong Kong, France and beyond, and learning about cooking, generally in one fell swoop: her aunt and Chinese uncle’s garden in London educated her about Chinese ingredients; and her Hong Konger future husband provoked her attention through his focus on the culinary, his farmers’ market shopping and his cooking (for instance, steaming fish) ().\n\nThe Chef’s Table: France episode conveys Grattard’s passion for China, through what I am calling the Asian inflection of her internships, her post-culinary school apprenticeships in Hong Kong and the influence of Hong Kongers in her life. Grattard veered away from traditional French paradigms through an internship with chef Pascal Barbot, who combines French and Japanese cuisines, a more common juxtaposition than French and Chinese cuisines both in France and in the US. As Barbot put it, “L’Asie fait partie de sa culture. Vraiment, c’est son identité” (). Barbot invokes the entire continent of Asia whereas Grattard’s life experiences and cuisine connect her specifically to Hong Kong and to Chinese culture and cuisine, the former small and dense, the latter vast and highly populated. However, Barbot’s Franco-Japanese cuisine, featured at his Michelin-starred restaurant Astrance, located in Paris’s posh sixteenth arrondissement, explains his reference to all-encompassing “Asia”. His role as Grattard’s mentor contributed to her expertise, despite the distinction between the Asian dimensions of their cuisines (Japanese and Chinese, respectively).\n\nWhereas writers such as François Cheng, Dai Sijie and Shan Sa left China for France and did not go back, Grattard left France for Hong Kong, but only temporarily. Nevertheless, “Chineseness” in many forms infuses her life and her cuisine. Like those Chinese literary figures’ writing in their new home country, Grattard’s life is métissée, a French term for “mixed”, as I will explain further below. Her life entails a commitment to sharing her passion and Chinese culinary expertise in France. Grattard’s engagement with China and Chinese cuisine extends beyond two years in Hong Kong, both before and after, permeating her life and gastronomy in ongoing fashion. Although she is French, her identity and life experience are Chinese as well.\n\nCuisine d’autrice\n\nGrattard’s cuisine, which falls under the aegis of cuisine d’autrice, to borrow and feminize the term cuisine d’auteur used by Barbot in the Chef’s Table episode, transcends the Sino-French or even the Franco-Chinese. André Bazin’s conception of the film-maker as auteur, harking back to the French New Wave (1959–65), which began officially just after his death in 1958, applies to chef Grattard, whose cuisine bears her personal stamp. Be it the creation of a culinary artist or a film-maker, an auteur’s work entails the “facteur personnel comme critère de référence” (). Bazin critiques favouring films which are privileged because one can “lire, en filigraine” the auteur’s “blason” (). One dimension of the auteur theory that applies to Adeline Grattard’s culinary art and to cuisine in general is the elevated status of the culinary autrice, as opposed to a cook or even a chef. Further, the personal permeates the work, as Barbot’s assessment of Yam’Tcha in the Netflix episode reflects: “au restaurant Yam’Tcha … on a vraiment l’influence … on sent l’histoire, ses enfants, son vécu, son experience” (). For instance, chef Grattard’s boules de crème LinYi, rice dough enveloping whipped cream with fresh fruit, is named after her children’s nanny, who helped with the recipe (Figure 3). Le Monde food critic François Simon, the first expert to appear in the documentary, said that Yam’Tcha Restaurant’s “particularité” led him to make an exception to his commitment as a restaurant reviewer not to talk about restaurants outside of his writing (). Indeed, the episode upholds what Simon views as a critic’s obligatory invisibility by speaking but not appearing fully on camera. His hands are shown in close-up; he appears from head to waist, but blurred; and we see his lips moving, in profile, as he speaks. Notably, Simon pays no attention to the French or Chinese ingredients or methods in Grattard’s cuisine. Instead, he focuses on what he deems the uniqueness of Yam’Tcha, Adeline Grattard’s personal stamp, her culinary signature, which he seems to consider beyond words, ineffable.\n\nAs opposed to adhering to a national culinary tradition or even two, Grattard’s methods and resulting cuisine are intuitive. This approach helps account for the personal stamp. In her cooking, Grattard emphasizes Cantonese cuisine, due to her Hong Kong connections and experiences. However, pigeonholing Grattard’s gastronomic creations is inappropriate, since she has a masterful repertoire across regional cuisines, including the fiery concoctions for which Sichuan province, one of the four major culinary regions in China, is celebrated. In Chef’s Table, Barbot refers to her mixing of “le bon canard français” with a “Sichuanese sauce” and her aubergine sichuanaise features a spicy sauce as well.\n\nIn the spirit of the French New Wave film-makers, with a feminine inflection to the masculinist movement, Grattard, as a culinary autrice, rejects recipes. With its jazz score and jump cuts, Jean-Luc Godard’s 1959 début À bout de souffle (Breathless) exemplifies the improvisation of French New Wave auteurs (). Similarly, Grattard emphasizes that recipes are not used in Yam’Tcha’s kitchen since they render cuisine, “figée, tétanisée”. The chef recalls the pressure of recognizing François Simon among the clientele at the restaurant’s 2009 opening night and figuring out what she would serve that very evening (). Expressing vitality, Grattard’s cuisine resonates with the “living bread” of the character, Kang, the mentor of apprentice baker Wu Pao Chun in Taiwanese film-maker Lin Cheng-sheng’s 2013 biopic, 27°C: Loaf Rock. As the protagonist expresses both romantic love (for his childhood sweetheart Mei) and filial love (for his mother) through red bean buns and longan bread, chef Grattard espouses cooking with the heart (). She privileges “le feeling”, deeming experimentation worth the risks it entails, to avoid static, lifeless cuisine ().\n\nA concept which resonates with cuisine d’autrice is Ferguson’s “haute food,” which captures the spirit of Grattard’s culinary art. Ferguson suggests that in the twentieth century,\n\nThanks to the unprecedented availability of foodstuffs from all over the world, the consequent sophistication about food, and the relentless push for innovation, reinvention has become the rule. The singular and the exceptional, contemporary culture tells us, are very good things indeed. ()\n\nAs opposed to haute cuisine, which embodies tradition, haute food, as Ferguson conceives it, “jettisons convention” and underscores innovation (). Like what I am calling cuisine d’autrice, Ferguson’s haute food amplifies the role of the chef, who becomes a “higher culinary authority … creating a meal that realizes his vision (and we are typically dealing with men)” (). It is perhaps precisely because Adeline Grattard isn’t a “typical” (i.e. male) chef that her vision hardly evokes authority. Nevertheless, haute food elevates the chef, allowing her to make choices that typically lie with the customer or guest (). Indeed, whereas Ferguson discusses haute food chefs’ “small touches … off the menu” such as amuse-bouches and tasting menus (), chef Grattard offers only a tasting meal at Yam’Tcha Restaurant. That is, there is no menu at all; it’s all chef’s creation and thus chef’s choice.\n\nCulinary Métissage\n\nThe Chef’s Table episode devoted to Grattard reveals that both she and Chi-wah Chan were drawn to the other’s culture and cuisine before they met. Grattard’s passion for China resulted not only from its “otherness”, which may be said of many countries from the vantage point of France, but also more precisely from the influence of her aunt’s Chinese husband. Thus, a balance between the exotic (Other) and the familiar (family) joined forces to instil in Grattard a passion for China. Similarly, Chan, who grew up in a large, poor Hong Kong family (interview 17 Sept. 2017), was drawn to France, where he moved and then encountered Grattard at an equestrian competition in Normandy (). According to Grattard in Chef’s Table, Chan impressed her as a man who cared about the culinary, as exemplified in his food acquisition at marchés and cooking, as noted above. Their partnership opened the door for innovative, cross-cultural culinary mixing in their trio of Paris restaurants. Grattard and Chan’s coupling led to her living and learning in Hong Kong, where she worked as a chef de cuisine. First, she went to Hong Kong solo, then she was joined by her husband, who served as her linguistic and cultural translator. Grattard’s cuisine métissée, to invoke Sabban’s term to refer to food which blends national traditions (), reflects their life as a Franco-Hong Kong couple and then as a mixed family, including their three children as of 2017, residing in Paris. As Grattard put it, the cuisine is “métissée … comme la famille – ça illustre notre vie; empruntée aux deux cultures et deux physiques” (). In her piece “Remarques sur la cuisine, la gastronomie et le métissage,” Sabban refers to métissage culinaire as “étant elle-même une opération de mélange des ingrédients … souvent de leur cuisson pour les mélanger encore plus intimement” (). Sabban continues, “elle [la cuisine] est le creuset par excellence d’un métissage” (). Considering métissage the process and result of one culture or civilization’s influence on another, Sabban underscores that “le métissage” must comprise “un mélange dont il est impossible de dissocier les parties” ().\n\nThe Stilton cheese and Amarena cherry bao, the signature steamed bun that Grattard describes and makes in the Chef’s Table episode and which is featured at the Boutique, exemplifies the blending of inseparable parts characterizing her cuisine. The cheese-and-cherry bao not only goes beyond a blending of French and Chinese foodstuffs, but transcends these two countries as sources of ingredients. In the Chef’s Table: France episode, Grattard describes the search for a less “boring” option than the French baguette for Yam’Tcha Restaurant, yielding the idea of the steamed bao, which she calls “pure Hong Kong”. Further reflecting her leaning towards Chinese culinary options and creations, Grattard refuses to westernize the Asian elements of her culinary offerings at Yam’Tcha, already partly western. For instance, in French fashion, the people at the table closest to mine at the restaurant asked for bread to accompany the roast duck (canard rôti) main dish. I heard the server respond politely, “On n’a pas de pain dans la maison”. Grattard told me that crust (croûte) cannot be found in “the house”, because it does not align with her culinary vision for Yam’Tcha (interview 28 Nov. 2017). Baos are the bread of the house. The Michelin-starred restaurant offered the plain bao as a grace note to the multi-course lunch on my visit. This bao shares one principal feature of baguettes: it lacks a filling. By contrast, like typical Hong Kong baos, the buns Grattard creates are true to their name. Bao denotes “bag”. The above-mentioned signature bao, listed on the boutique’s menu and, the day I lunched at the restaurant, offered there as well, envelopes melted cheese and Amarena cherries. Biting into the bun, one consumes the steamed dough and the filling simultaneously, blurring the boundary between exterior and interior. Yam’Tcha’s signature bao also fails to follow the division between Chinese container and French filling because Stilton is a quintessentially English cheese, hailing from Derbyshire, Leicestershire and Nottinghamshire (). Further deconstructing the opposition between Chinese outside and French inside, the buns are made from type 45 French wheat flour. The resulting multiplicity makes sense given Hong Kong’s hybridity as a cosmopolitan, global city state. Hong Kong’s “Chinese” cuisine is Cantonese; “Chinese” is a vast and thus almost meaningless descriptor of food.\n\nAdditional baos of chef Grattard’s devising also have fillings derived from national culinary traditions other than French and Chinese. One might argue that the Basque pork with Sichuan-style aubergine bao (Figure 4) combines French meat with a vegetable cooked in a Chinese regional style. In a video, Grattard demonstrates the process of making the Sichuan-style aubergine coupled with Basque pork. The Basque pork extends the parameters of France to its border with Spain; the Basque country has its own regional cuisine. French food, like Chinese cuisine, is regional and multifaceted. Preparing the aubergine entails using a wok (after steaming in a pot), thus comprising both Chinese equipment and ingredients; namely: Chinese aubergine as well as Sambal, a Southeast Asian hot sauce; oyster sauce, black soy beans, ginger, garlic and, principally, Sichuan pepper. Although most of the ingredients are Chinese, Grattard invokes her French training when she cuts the ginger julienne-style. Given the importance of accessibility and the local, she uses several French ingredients, including fresh pink garlic from Lautrec, which is certified and protected and comes from the Tarn département of southern France, in the Midi-Pyrénées (). The sweet dessert bao features not French chocolate but Dominican dark chocolate (Figure 5) from the Caribbean; the Dominican Republic is situated on the island of Hispaniola which it shares with Haiti. Chef Grattard makes no effort to balance the French and Chinese dimensions of her cuisine. Instead, she designs her dishes intuitively, in the process foregrounding those two culinary realms because they reflect her life: where she lives (past and present), whom and where she loves.\n\nGrattard brings together French and Chinese cuisines, as well as the respective cultures that the cuisines reflect and help create. However, each of these countries offers myriad regional cuisines, as chef Alvin Leung of Hong Kong’s Michelin-starred Bo Innovation says in relation to China (). In the Chef’s Table: France episode, shots of Grattard and Chan shopping for a bamboo steamer among other Chinese kitchen ware at the Tuck Chong Sum Kee Steam company illustrate Leung’s statement that Grattard “took all the techniques of Chinese cuisine”. Leung continues by adding that she “applies [Chinese techniques] to beautiful French products: fish, cheese, chicken, foie gras”. A series of close-ups such as an image of fish in a bamboo steamer and the chef cooking them accompanies the soundtrack. Leung’s division between Chinese techniques and French ingredients oversimplifies Grattard’s more nuanced blending. The subtlety of her cuisine makes it difficult to distinguish between what Grattard calls the “notes françaises” and the “notes chinoises” (interview 28 Nov. 2017). However, as Chan suggests, her mixing is more instinctual; the (tea) sommelier thus rejects the term “fusion”, which he characterizes as bringing something into one culinary tradition from outside (interview 17 Sept. 2017). Despite the typically hyphenated form, the Sino-French, alternatively the Franco-Chinese, transcends binaries, be they geopolitical, aesthetic or, in the case of the culinary, gustatory as well as cultural and national, since food is about far more than taste and even the senses.\n\nGrattard describes her cooking as “cuisine française avec des touches chinoises” (interview 28 Nov. 2017). She embraces the “Franco-Chinese” label, but her cuisine focuses on those two culinary traditions without excluding others. Cristina Bowerman, who heads the Michelin-starred Glass Hostaria in Rome, described feeling “suspended between France and China” when she ate Grattard’s aubergines with duck at a Lugano culinary event. She also noted that Grattard “takes you for a walk around the world yet with the slow speed of a carriage, not the violent rapidity of an airplane. The flavours of all the cultures she touches pass in front of you slowly in a soft and sometimes intangible alternation so much so it’s hard to identify the borders” (). I underscore the blurriness of these borders. Grattard’s cuisine does not so much entail a journey from France to China or vice versa, but a suspension in between; a walk not from Hong Kong to Paris but, even more ambitiously, “around the world”. Chef Grattard herself evokes the liminality of her cuisine, its in-betweenness, to describe her cooking and the couple’s restaurants: “c’est un peu l’histoire de notre vie, parce que c’est entre la France, c’est entre Hong Kong” ().\n\nThis type of culinary métissage is, in Grattard’s own compelling assessment, feminine. Indeed, we might call it cuisine féminine, a concept inspired by Hélène Cixous’s “écriture féminine” and, in turn, by Agnès Varda’s “cinécriture”. In Vérane Frédiani’s important 2016 documentary À la recherche des chefs femmes (), devoted to female chefs in the male-dominated restaurant industry, Grattard downplays the idea that being a woman affects the work of a chef negatively, creating obstacles. Indeed, she affirms the advantages of cuisine féminine, which results, she suggests in Frédiani’s documentary, from women’s capacity to multitask. Even combining numerous ingredients and methods, as does her own culinary art, cuisine féminine is more harmonious than men’s cooking, which juxtaposes or slices (“trancher”), proceeding thing by thing (“chose par chose”). Grattard’s theory and praxis of cuisine féminine resonates with Sabban’s above-mentioned conception of culinary métissage (), which cannot be reduced to its parts, in the way that the cooking of male chefs can, according to Grattard ().\n\n“Meal Thinking”\n\nSome of the dishes served when I ate at Yam’Tcha Restaurant seemed to combine the two predominant influences in Grattard’s life, the French and the Chinese, in clearly discernible parts. However, such dichotomies do not really hold firm when subjected to scrutiny. Starting at the culmination of the meal, I mistook the dessert course’s black sesame cake (gâteau à la graine de sésame noir) for flourless chocolate cake from a distance (Figure 6) as a “westerner” (a chocolate-appreciating US scholar spending a sabbatical in France). However, the sesame seeds of the dessert’s name reflect the “Chineseness” of this ingredient and flavouring: sesame probably originated in Asia (or East Africa) and Chinese people have utilized sesame seeds for at least 5,000 years. The accompanying raspberries, grown in Chouzé-sur-Loire and figs from Solliès, in the Provence-Alpes-Côte d’Azur region, according to restaurant manager Yoann Gregory, are both French-sourced fruits. Thus, we might be tempted to call the fruit French and the black sesame “Chinese”, but of course, gâteau, or cake, is quite French, if not more generally western. Thus, we have an occidental “form” with a more Chinese flavour, but even that is stretching the point, since sesame seeds are utilized in the West, for instance on bagels and other breads. The foie gras, although a French speciality, was served with Savagnin grapes grown in the Jura (mountains) and with French (trompette) mushrooms, or “false truffles” (Figure 7). However, shiitake mushrooms join the trompettes to create diversity of origins, cultures and tastes. Shiitakes are grown in China, as well as other East Asian countries, complicating the monolingualism perhaps suggested by their Japanese name (see ).\n\nDespite my analysis of the provenance of ingredients and the cultural and national contexts of cooking methods, echoing Cristina Bowerman’s reaction to Adeline Grattard’s cooking, I was so transported by my meal at Yam’Tcha that I indulged in the pleasure of the entire experience, delaying the work of analysis until afterwards. Such an approach is consistent with what Michelle T. King calls “meal-thinking” as opposed to “menu thinking” (). Even more than me and my work, Grattard and Yam’Tcha discourage menu thinking, or what King calls specious debates about “which dishes do or do not, can or cannot, should or should not qualify as representing a given nation on its notional national menu” (), since there is no printed (or digital) menu presented to guests at the restaurant. The written version of the menu that restaurant manager Yoann Gregory sent to me for research purposes was transmitted to me after the meal because, consistent with the above-mentioned rejection of recipes, Grattard improvises a series of courses not simply each day but two meals on a given day, inspired by the fresh, quality ingredients available. On site, the servers announce each dish as it arrives at the table. The post-visit research menu featured French products such as Challans duck, which is not surprising since it is “local”, a requirement for cuisine of such high quality. Named after Challans, the town in the Vendée region from where it hails, about 275 miles from Paris, and also known as the “Capitale du canard”, Challans duck even has an IGP or indication géographique protégée and earned its claim to fame at the celebrated Tour d’Argent restaurant in Paris. However, even the seemingly quintessentially French ducks are of mixed origins: at least according to legend, in about 1650, the Challans duck was born of a cross between wild ducks and ducks imported from Holland (). Even if the legend is just that and the Challans duck is locally sourced today, this species evokes the globally celebrated signature of China’s capital, in its earlier Romanized form, Peking Duck, whose name reflects the provenance of the dish as well as the animal. Like the Challans duck, blood sausage, the second main ingredient in the same dish, along with roasted tomatoes and peppers, is of French origin, but related to a similar sausage made from animal blood in Chinese and Taiwanese culinary repertoires (Figure 8).\n\nBeyond Food\n\nIt is almost a truism that food is not just about ingredients and methods, the gustatory or even the olfactory and the visual (presentation, colour). Yam’Tcha’s priority is cuisine and those who frequent the establishment to consume it, the clientele reflecting its crossing of national boundaries. According to Grattard, patrons are Parisian, American, Italian, Swedish and a mix of Asians and non-Asians (interview 28 Nov. 2017). Parisians and tourists appeared to be dining there on 28 September 2017, as far as I could glean, with the Netflix episode accounting for an increase in tourists. Chan noted that Hong Kongers come to the Yam’Tcha Boutique to drink milk tea and to eat (interview 17 Sept. 2017). Setting the stage – or the table – for a culinary experience, Grattard says, place settings, as well as décor and architecture, or “le feeling” that they create, the ambiance, contributes to the cross-cultural culinary experience (interview 28 Nov. 2017).\n\nYam’Tcha restaurant’s plating and table settings are simple and elegant, while its interior design is subtle, in good taste, modern. Consistent with the décor, its cuisine is neither clearly Chinese nor obviously French. Ceiling lights take the form of Asian-style lanterns. Plating is individual, according to French or western protocol as opposed to the Chinese paradigm of shared dishes. Utensils are adapted to each course. After opening the meal with amuse-bouches accompanied by chopsticks, a fork on the left and a spoon and chopsticks on the right frame the appetizer plate of foie gras and mushroom, as seen in Figure 7. We must be careful not to fall into the trap that Roland Barthes succumbed to when, in Empire of Signs, he considered chopsticks to constitute the only “Asian utensils” (). Today, nearly a half century later, this is blatantly false, as in many Asian countries, including China and Taiwan, chopsticks and forks are both options, contingent upon the food in question (and the context or venue, household or restaurant).\n\nCollaborative Art\n\nLike cinema, culinary art is collaborative, requiring teamwork, with the significant exception of cooking by and for oneself. Similarly, despite the case of solo-authored literary works such as novels by Chinese immigrants to France writing in French, Sino-French artistic creation is particularly conducive to collaboration, given the potential for cross-cultural sharing of expertise, as in the case of Grattard and Chan. Through her apprenticeships and collaborations, Grattard has become an expert, akin to Fuchsia Dunlop, a chef, food writer and the first westerner to study Sichuan cooking in Chengdu. Although Grattard plays the lead role as chef, Yam’Tcha constitutes a Franco-Chinese or Franco-Cantonese “co-production”. In that sense, Grattard and Chan’s collection of venues recalls the partnerships responsible for other Franco-Chinese creations. Belgian cartoonist Hergé and Chinese artist and “native informant” Chang Tchong-ren, a Shanghainese who studied art in Belgium in the 1930s, co-created the Tintin story Le lotus bleu—although Hergé took the lead and got credit for the work. In the 1950s, shifting to the medium of film, Roger Pigaut collaborated with Chinese screenwriter and adapter Wang Kia-Yi for the children’s feature film Le cerf-volant du bout du monde, often credited as the first Franco-Chinese co-production ().\n\nThe strategy of the collaboration of French artists with Asian counterparts is a fruitful one. Grattard joined forces with chef Niki Nakayama and her sous-chef (and wife) Carole Iida Nakayama, who run the Los Angeles Michelin-starred Japanese Kaiseki restaurant n/naka for a December 2019 dinner event. Such collaboration embodies the benefits of collaboration and the border-crossing inclinations of both the culinary and the Sino-French (). Although the term Sino-French clearly does not evoke the Japanese dimension of this collaboration, from the perspective of Grattard, her connection with chef Nakayama reflects the expansive tendency of the Sino-French, in this case broadening it to the Franco-Asian and even beyond to the United States, given Nakayama’s Los Angeles home base and culinary influence. Like Grattard, Nakayama, who went to culinary school, travelled to East Asia (Japan), returned home (to Los Angeles) to open a restaurant and was featured on season 1, episode 4 of Chef’s Table (). Chefs Grattard and (Niki) Nakayama share values and visions: the prioritization of food over all else in their restaurants, sourcing of local ingredients and integrity about them, Michelin stars and an Andrew Fried directed Chef’s Table episode devoted to them. The trio of Grattard and the Nakayamas planned to “combine Grattard’s French interpretation of Chinese food with n/naka’s Japanese cuisine while following the kaiseki format of cooking” (). The Los Angeles culinary event reflects the tendency of the Sino-French to transcend the binary, the reach extended by collaboration – in the case of this culinary celebration, between and among France, the United States, China, Japan and beyond.\n\nGrattard’s gravitation to (and beyond) Chinese cuisine reflects the broad disciplinary scope of Sino-French cultural productions. Resulting partly from the immigration of Chinese writers and film-makers to France, the field of Francophone-Chinese or Sino-French Studies is multidirectional and even more multidisciplinary than the focus on literature, cinema and even the visual arts suggests. Cuisine or culinary art constitutes cultural production and as the concept of “foodways” reflects, food circulates, making culinary arts a particularly transcultural production. Meanwhile, the academic field of food studies is burgeoning. Franco-Chinese cuisine belongs among the aesthetic objects and cultural texts of Sino-French Studies."
