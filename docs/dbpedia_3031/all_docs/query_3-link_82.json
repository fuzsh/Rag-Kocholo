        "text": "LOS ANGELES – James Franco’s next big movie is the Disney extravaganza “Oz: The Great and Powerful,” due March 8, and the Mouseketeers have been working hard to establish him in marketing materials as a family-friendly leading man.\n\nSundance apparently didn’t get the memo. Festival programmers on Thursday unveiled another section of their lineup – drip, drip, drip – and Mr. Franco explores sadomasochistic sex in two films.\n\nThe actor-filmmaker tackles the gay variety in “Interior. Leather Bar.” To avoid an X rating, it was rumored that 40 minutes were cut from the 1980 film “Cruising,” and Mr. Franco’s film sets out to reimagine what was lost. “Kink” is a documentary, produced by Mr. Franco and directed by Christina Voros, that looks at “the sprawling porn production facilities of Kink.com.”\n\nSundance is slated to announce films in its high-profile Premieres section on Monday. If “Lovelace,” a drama about the porn star Linda Lovelace, makes the cut, Mr. Franco, who plays Hugh Hefner in that film, will have three sex-themed movies in Park City in January.\n\n“Interior. Leather Bar” and “Kink” are selections in Sundance’s experimental New Frontier and racy Midnight programs. Other notable entries include GJ Echternkamp’s “Virtually Heroes,” about characters in a “Call of Duty”-style video game; two horror movies that explore country roads and small towns – “In Fear” and “The Rambler”; and “Charlie Victor Romeo” a documentary in which actors act out black box recordings of planes that have crashed.\n\nBelow are Sundance’s full 2013 Midnight and New Frontier programs, along with the lineup for Spotlight, a section devoted to movies that have already played other festivals:\n\nPARK CITY AT MIDNIGHT\n\nAss Backwards (Director: Chris Nelson, Screenwriters: June Diane Raphael, Casey Wilson) — Loveable losers Kate and Chloe take a road trip back to their hometown to claim the beauty-pageant crown that eluded them as children, only to discover what really counts: friendship.\n\nHell Baby (Directors and screenwriters: Robert Ben Garant, Thomas Lennon) — An expectant couple moves into the most haunted fixer-upper in New Orleans, a house with a demonic curse.
