        "text": "John Crowley, Brooklyn\n\nColm Toibin’s coming-of-age novel Brooklyn about a young woman who travels from her home in Ireland to Brooklyn in the early 1950s, won the UK and Ireland’s prestigious Costa Book Award 2009 and was longlisted for the Man Booker prize in the same year. Irish director John Crowley took on the challenge of directing Nick Hornby’s adapted screenplay of the beloved book, and is rewarded with a world premiere in Sundance this month.\n\n“It feels like a really important story to have told, and before anyone judges it, this is absolutely the film I set out to make,” he says.\n\n“All my luck came at once when I received the phone call from Wildgaze Films asking me if I wanted to direct this,” continues Crowley. “I first read Colm’s book several years ago, and just loved it. Then getting to read Nick Hornby’s script — it was truly a beautiful adaptation, making it easy to envision how it could be brought to life.”\n\nCurtain call\n\nCrowley is well known in the theatre world — in particular his acclaimed version of Martin McDonagh’s The Pillowman that played in London and New York. To cinephiles, he is known for his earlier films including black-comedy crime caper Intermission and Bafta-winning drama Boy A, starring a then-unknown Andrew Garfield.\n\nThough prolific, as his résumé suggests, Crowley admits putting Brooklyn on screen was no small feat. “I felt the pressure. It’s just one of those things when you take on a well-known literary piece of work,” he says. “I had never worked on an adaptation like this before, and I wanted to make sure the novel wasn’t lost on the big screen.”\n\nThe Ireland-UK-Canada co-production warranted a complicated shooting schedule that saw three weeks in Ireland, four weeks in Montreal (doubling as Brooklyn) and two days in New York.\n\nWhile Crowley had worked on bigger budgets, such as terrorist thriller Closed Circuit, he reveals the sheer scale and ambition of what he and the production team were trying to achieve on Brooklyn was challenging and exciting.\n\nRather than emulating an old-fashioned 1950s period film, Crowley brought on board cinematographer Yves Bélanger, who shot Dallas Buyers Club, to help create a visual style that was contemporary and immediate. A broad colour palette helped to depict the different locations, while tight framing was used to show shifting perspectives.\n\nEllis Lacey — the woman who is pushed into leaving her small-town roots in Ireland for Brooklyn — was initially to be played by Rooney Mara, but scheduling conflicts opened the door to Saoirse Ronan, whose lead performance is described by Crowley as “one of the most defining performances of her career”.\n\nThe director likens working with the cast — which includes Domhnall Gleeson Emory Cohen, Jim Broadbent and Julie Walters — to an archaeologist chipping away to find something special, something he claims was much easier because of the material’s emotional density.\n\n“We all can relate to that feeling of moving to a place that feels unfamiliar, but when you return home, you look different and they look different,” says Crowley. “This to me is what makes the story so universal — everyone at some point has been in a state of exile.”\n\nTiffany Pritchard\n\nFrancois Delisle, Chorus\n\n“I think living means coming to grips with loss, with mourning loved ones as well as ideas,” says Francois Delisle. “Whether we like it or not, life and death are connected in our very being.”\n\nThe connection is palpable in Chorus, the Montreal director’s World Cinema Dramatic Competition entry that sees him return to Sundance after The Meteor premiered at the festival in 2013.\n\nIn Chorus, Fanny Mallette and Sébastien Ricard play estranged parents who reunite in Montreal after the body of their son surfaces 10 years after his kidnap by a paedophile.\n\nNeither parent is particularly likeable in the film and Delisle’s fierce artistic integrity manifests itself in a robust defence of his approach to telling the story. “I don’t really care if they’re likeable or not,” he says. “What interests me is the human experience that a work of art can bring to people who are exposed to it. I put all my energy, from the scriptwriting to the final edit, into making sure the film has that effect.\n\n“It’s about being straightforward with myself and with others. From that point on, everything that makes up the film — characters, dialogue, images, etc — falls into place, I wouldn’t say easily, but pretty organically.”\n\nIn a similar vein Delisle rejects the notion an empathetic depiction of the paedophile character is in any way brave.\n\n“He’s a human being, like you or me. There’s nothing brave about approaching him without judgment and going beyond cliché.\n\n“We’re bombarded with sexual, racial and ideological stereotypes that condition our way of seeing life and other humans. It keeps us confined to our niches where the last thing we want is to be confronted.”\n\nDelisle says the killer embodies the dark place “we all have inside us”, and says it is his job to show this.\n\nThe $1.7m Chorus shot in Montreal in February 2013 and derives much of its haunting, almost dreamlike tone from the black-and-white imagery.\n\n“I saw monochromatic images when I started writing,” Delisle says. “But it only came together once I’d finished the writing process. A collection of photos by Mark Steinmetz was the spark. I found the film’s moods through his images. Black and white helps get to the root of things.\n\n“The story, which is not even loosely inspired by true events, is intended to be a kind of questioning or artistic one-on-one with death and life at the same time.”\n\nJeremy Kay\n\nGerard Barrett, Glassland\n\nGrowing up in rural Ireland, Gerard Barrett was inspired to write the script for Glassland after moving to Dublin following his graduation from university. On arrival, he was struck by a new family dynamic — kids parenting their parents.\n\n“Mothers and fathers, battling addiction, were falling on their kids to pick up the pieces; a complete role reversal. It was terribly sad. It was wearing the freshness of youth away from them,” says Barrett, a Screen LA Star of Tomorrow in 2014.\n\nGlassland tells the story of a young cabdriver (Jack Reynor) who is pushed deeper into Dublin’s criminal underworld in an attempt to save his alcoholic mother (Toni Collette).\n\nDespite the dark premise, Barrett views the film as a tribute to his parents. “They’ve always been there for me. If you can say that about your parents, you’re lucky and should appreciate them.\n\n“I wanted to make people — especially young adults in their mid-twenties, my own age — appreciate what they have.”\n\nLeading lights\n\nCasting the leads went without a hitch. Barrett met Reynor on the festival circuit while the former was screening his debut Pilgrim Hill and Reynor was touring with What Richard Did. “We signed with the same agency on the same day and from there we linked up. I told him about my next project and I knew he was perfect for the role,” Barrett says.\n\nAs a longtime fan of Collette, Barrett was thrilled when the opportunity presented itself to send her the script. “She called me out of the blue and said if I would have her, she would love to play the part. I thank her so much for taking a chance on a 25-year-old Irish kid she’d never met,” he says. The film is produced by Element Pictures with support from the Irish Film Board. It also stars Will Poulter and Michael Smiley.\n\nGlassland shot in January 2014 over 16 smooth days. “We even finished early on the final day,” Barrett recalls.\n\nShooting by day, Barrett would edit at home in the evening and screen footage for cast and crew the following morning. Two days after the film wrapped, Reynor and cinematographer Piers McGrail watched the first cut. Six weeks later, Glassland was complete.\n\nBarrett was on his family farm when he learned the film had been accepted to Sundance. “I took a beat and let it sink in. My parents were the first people I told, and how apt. They aren’t the biggest movie-goers — it’s just a different generation that grew up in a part of Ireland where going to the pictures was not a thing. So it was a major moment to tell them. Magical. And then my father said, ‘What’s Sundance?’”\n\nElbert Wyche"
