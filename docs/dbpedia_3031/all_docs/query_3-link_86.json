        "text": "In the second day of announcements for its 2013 programme, the Sundance Film Festival has added the Australian feature project Coral: Rekindling Venus, written and directed by Australian installation artist Lynette Wallworth and produced by John Maynard. (See details below; pictured). It will be presented as part of New Frontier, the festival's section devoted to independent/experimental/multimedia art.\n\nIt somehow seems fitting that Alice Englert, Jane Campion's daughter, should be in one of the festival's films, given that Maynard had been the producer of Campion's early gems, Sweetie and . Englert, who so impressed alongside Elle Fanning in Sally Potter's Ginger & Rosa at the recent Toronto Film Festival, has a starring role in the U.K. film In Fear, directed and written by Jeremy Lovering. The film is part of the Park City at Midnight section, which includes horror, comedy and anything that's a little weird or adventurous. All world premieres, the films have been designed to keep audiences awake. Englert, in fact, has three films in the can and will first be seen here in the February release, .\n\nIn today's announcements, sexual themes continue with the porn documentary kink, directed by Christina Voros and produced by James Franco, who has two films in the programme. Franco also takes the helm together with Travis Mathews to create Interior. Leather Bar, which includes a speculative recreation of gay S&M footage that was cut from William Friedkin's controversial 1980 film Cruising starring Al Pacino.\n\nSpotlight, the third section announced, includes a selection of the programmers' favourite films, which had screened at previous festivals–and may get lost in the mix.

Pulse Index records the heart rates and fingerprints of participants and exhibits them in a beautiful Fibonacci pattern. Place your finger into the custom-made sensor, and your fingerprint appears on the largest cell of the display, pulsating to your heartbeat. Your print then travels down the sequence to join those of all the others who have visited the room, immersing the community space with the radiant glow of the human touch.\n\nWhat's He Building in There?\n\nArtists: Klip Collective\n\nRicardo Rivera and the Klip Collective transform the entire front of the New Frontier venue into an interactive, 3-D projection-mapped parable, inspired by the Tom Waits song.

Use the X-ray flashlight to peek at what he is up to."
