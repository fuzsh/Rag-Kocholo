        "text": "The international channels unit of AMC Networks has acquired The Strongest Man and four other films from this year’s Park City gathering it was announced early Monday morning. The Kenny Riches directed comedy plus Christmas, Again, the Italian Chlorine and the Canadian pics Chorus and The Amina Profile will all debut exclusively on Sundance Channel Global this spring. No details of the financial arrangements for the acquisitions are known at this time.\n\n“Our international footprint has grown exponentially and we believe this is intrinsically connected to our outstanding line-up of first-window original programming, resulting in increased demand from operators and viewers alike,” said Bruce Tuchman, President of AMC Global and Sundance Channel Global today. “The Sundance Film Festival is the ultimate purveyor of high quality top independent films and we are incredibly excited to share these five new exclusive films with worldwide audiences.”\n\nChlorine, Christmas, Again and The Strongest Man were picked up for all international territories where Sundance Channel is broadcast. The Francois Delisle directed Chorus has been acquired for Asia, Eastern Europe, Dutch Benelux, Iberia, Latin America, the Middle East and North Africa markets. The docu The Amina Profile will be seen in France, French-speaking Benelux and Iberia.\n\nThrough AMC Networks International, Sundance Channel Global’s programming is seen in more than 140 countries and territories worldwide."
