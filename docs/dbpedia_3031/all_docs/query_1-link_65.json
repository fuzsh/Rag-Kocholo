Delisle, descendant de Louis Delisle. http://www.familledupontdelisle.com/famille/\n\nBiography\n\nLouis Delisle migrated from France to New France.\n\nBirth\n\nDate: 11 APR 1645\n\nPlace: Dampierre-en-Bray, Haute-Normandie, Seine-Maritime, France\n\nDeath\n\nDate: 10 SEP 1693\n\nPlace: Hôtel-Dieu de Québec, Québec, Canada, Nouvelle-France\n\nLOUIS DELISLE was born April 11, 1645 in Dampierre-en-Bray (Seine-Maritime), Haute-Normandie, France, and died September 10, 1693 in Hôtel-Dieu de Québec, Quebec city.\n\nHe married LOUISE DES GRANGES October 15, 1669 in Quebec City, daughter of DENIS DESGRANGES and MARGUERITE ST. BRICE. She was born 1648 in Montmorency, ev.Paris, France (Fille du Roi), and died November 11, 1721 in St-François-de-Sales parish, Neuville, QC. --- Translated from L'Ancetre, article by Roch Delisle\n\nOriginally from Dampierre-en- Bray in Normandy, Louis was the son of Charles Delisle & Marguerite Petit, married about 1629, perhaps at Gournay, which became officially Gournay-en-Bray. He was the grandson of Nicolas Delisle, spouse of Jeanne... and father of at least 5 children, the last three baptized at Dampierre.\n\nLouis was the next to last of a family of ten children and the youngest of three boys. Like his brothers & sisters he was baptized at Dampiere the 11 april 1645. The nobleman Louis Godart, priest, parish priest of Dampierre was his godfather and Renée Sanglier, his godmother.\n\nThe tenth child of Charles' family was born posthumously. That daughter was baptized, 10 February 1647, under the name of Catherine. Louis lost his father at two years of age. He was the only one of his family to settle in Canada.\n\nLouis Delisle left for Canada in 1665 at age 20 as a soldier with the Carignan-Salières Regiment.\n\nThe first known presence of Louis Delisle in Canada is revealed to us by the concession of a property of two arpents of frontage that Jean-Francois Bourdon (attorney-general & member of Council) gave him the 20th of March 1667, in the seigneurie of Dombourg. Nicolas Dupont de Neuville acquired that seigneurie in 1680 and changed the name to Neuville. That concession granted to Louis & to 43 others in Dombourg the same day by Bourdon is inscribed in the repertoire of the notary Romain Becquet.\n\nAt the time of his first voyage the 20 May 1668, Monseigneur François de Laval administered the sacrament of confirmation to 66 adults at fort St-Louis on the Richelieu. Among those confirmed are Jacques de Chambly, commander of the fort & Valentin Frappier de Beauregard. Among the other 64, military for the most part, is the ancestor Louis. In the register where these confirmations are reported, it reads: \"De L'Isle, Louis, of the diocese of Rouen\"\n\nBy private action on 11 April 1669, Antoine Tapin, censitaire of the seigneur of Dombourg since 1663 (Becquet), & Louis Delisle exchanged their concessions of land. The latter, however, would have to pay in cash to Tapin 225 livres plus 100 sols. On the 20 May 1669, he fulfilled his obligation. That Louis was able to pay so soon is surprising at first: but not so astonishing if one assumes that censitaire was military with the royal troops, who chose to settle in this country. The soldiers who settled received their choice of 100 livres or 50 livres & supplies for a year. Officers received more.\n\nThe summer of 1669 is finished & since 11 April, Louis is in his 28th year. That year an impressive number of King's daughters set sail for Quebec. The majority of them were directed to the settlement of Quebec, where the largest population was located. Louis went to Quebec to make contact with the daughters still free & to make a choice. On the 29th of September, he made a first contract of marriage with Marie Petit (Duquet), a contract which was annulled by mutual consent the next day. A second contract, with the same notary, was made the 30th of the same month with Louise des Granges (S. Desgranges), who had also annulled a contract which she had made with Pierre Senat (Duquet).\n\nThe first extract from the contract between Louis Delisle & Louise des Granges \"...are present in the persons of Louis Delisle son of Charles Delisle & of Margueritte Petit his father & mother of the parish of Dompierre Archevesche of Rouen on the one part & Louise desgranges daughter of Denys Desgranges & Margueritte Jouanne her father & mother of the parish of St-Brisse of Paris on the other part...\"\n\nIs it Louis who said Dompierre instead of Dampierre? Or was it the notary who heard wrong?\n\nA second extract: \"And the future spouses admitted & confessed that the future wife was bringing with her to the union, the sum of four hundred livres, comprised of the sum of fifty livres given her by his majesty, then the sum of two hundred livres to take part in the union and the sum of two hundred livres will go out naturally & properly to her & her progeny.\n\nThen the third: \"...done & accepted at Quebec in the home of lady Bourdon the 30th of Sept. 1669 in the presence of Charles Terrien and Martin Gueudon witnesses and the future partners promised not to write or sign any other ordinance.\n\nThe 15th of Oct 1669, at the church of Notre-Dame of Quebec, six censitaires of Dombourg married King's daughters. Leonard Faucher with Marie Damoys, Robert Senat to Marie Attanville, Jean Lepicq to Francoise Millot, Jean De L'Astre to Marie Lefebvre, Antoine Bordeleau to Pierrette Halier and Louis Delisle to Louise DesGranges. Jean-Francois Bourdon, their seigneur, was one of their witnesses. Louis Delisle was witness for Jean De L'Astre and Antoine Bordeleau. The marriage of Louis & Louise revealed that they were both orphaned of father & mother.\n\nMarriage extract \"The 15th day of the month of October of the year 1669; after the engagement and the publication of two bans of marriage between Louys de L'Isle of Dombourg, son of the late Charles de L'Isle & the deceased Marguerite Petit, his father & mother of the parish of Dampierre, Arch. of Rouen on the one part; & Louyse des Granges, daughter of the deceased Denys des Granges & Marguerite Jouanne her father & mother of the parish of Saint-Brice, Arch. of Paris on the other part; Monsieur L'Evesque having given them dispensation of the 3rd ban & not having found any impediment, I undersigned cure of that church parish have solemnly married them & have given them the Nuptial benediction according to the form prescribed by the holy church in the presence of Valentin Frapier Sieur of Beauregard Lieutenant of the Sieur de Chambly; of Jean Francois Bourdon sieur of Dombourg & of Antoine Bordeleau, Witnesses. H. de Bernieres\"\n\nWith the census of 1681, in Neuville, Delisle had a rifle, seven animals with horns and twenty arpents of ground in culture. Louise Desgranges is then 33 years old.\n\nAt the end of October 1691, Jean Aide-Créquy, husband of Catherine Angélique Delisle, acquires a farm in Champigny, close to the line of the seigneury of DesMaures, with the back of the road of the Cap-Rouge.\n\nSeptember 7, 1693, Louis Delisle, his wife and their daughter Catherine-Angelica resell this ground in the name of their son-in-law and husband absent from the country.\n\nWhen Louis Delisle sells the farm of Jean Aide-Crequy, notary Genaple wrote: \"Louis Delisle of the seigneurie of Neuville, on his sickbed in the house of the Sieur Pierre Villeneuve, on Demeules street, healthy however of spirit and Judgement as it appeared to us and the named witnesses, And Louise of the barns \".... People of the area of the capital, when it was possible, were getting brought to the Hospital to obtain care or to die in dignity. At the age of 48 years, Louis is transported to the Hospital, a few days before his death. On September 10, 1693, there he expires.\n\nLouise Desgranges lived more than 28 years after the death of her husband, she was buried in the cemetery of Neuville, Tuesday November 11th, 1721, aged approximately 73 years\n\nChildren of LOUIS DELISLE and LOUISE DES GRANGES:\n\ni.
