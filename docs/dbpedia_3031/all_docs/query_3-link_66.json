        "text": "As their loss has become a defining point of their identity, so does their isolation. They may still be capable of love, but love no longer has the power to sustain their survival.\n\nFull Review | Nov 21, 2023\n\nA festering beauty of a film slowly reveals itself in this bleak but uplifting black-and-white study of grief from Quebeçois director François Delisle, an acutely aware portrait of a relationship after the unimaginable.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 4/5 | Apr 4, 2019\n\nIt's a delicate balance. The mood is heavy and could easily tip to the side of melodrama, but Delisle keeps his cool by keeping emotional breakdowns to a minimum.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 3.5/5 | Mar 6, 2015\n\nIt's a long, dark road to that catharsis, but it's worth the journey to get there. I won't easily forget \"Chorus\" - its currents run too deep.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 3.5/4 | Jan 28, 2015"
