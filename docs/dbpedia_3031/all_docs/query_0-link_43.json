        "text": "PARIS– U.S. and Canadian auds will get a snapshot of Gaul’s rising filmmakers and talent during the second edition of the Young French Cinema Program, an initiative put together by French promo org Unifrance Films, the French embassy and Telefilm Canada.\n\nThe lineup of the upcoming Young French Cinema Program includes Jean-Charles Hue’s “Eat your Bones,” which world-premiered at Cannes’ Directors’ Fortnight, Ossama Mohammed and Wiam Simav Bedirxan’s “Silvered Water,” which premiered in Cannes’ Special Screenings, Antoine Barraud’s Berlin-premiering “Portrait of the Artist” and Alix Delaporte “The Last Hammer Blow,” which bowed at Venice. The program will also play an indie Quebecois film, “Chorus,” directed by François Delisle.\n\nThe selected movies – most of which have premiered in one of the top North American festivals in 2015 — will screen at U.S. and Canadian theaters, universities and nonprofit orgs. Since the initiative is sponsored by Ymagis Group, movies will be presented in DCP quality on Ymagis’ CineConductor, an online platform for content management.\n\nThe aim is to “showcase a young generation of filmmakers with a global vision and a superior capacity to combine cultural influences and create innovative styles and stories,” said Unifrance, the Paris-based institution presided by Jean-Paul Salomé and managed by Isabelle Giordano.\n\nThe U.S. remains a key market for Gallic films’ exports and the org has been striving to engage younger American moviegoers, encouraging them to discover and develop a taste for a diversity of French films.\n\nEach feature film in the upcoming program is available for a $300-booking fee that covers up to two screenings per film, while shorts are available to theaters free of charge. The initiative allows theaters to organize Young French Cinema screenings at their convenience, as well as apply for travel grants from Unifrance to have the directors or actors fly to the U.S. in order present their movies and participate in masterclasses.\n\nThe first edition of Young French Cinema hosted 53 screenings across 11 different locations in North America since last March. Thierry de Peretti, the helmer of “Apaches” went to Puerto Rico to present his film and host a masterclass at the University of San Juan, while Sophie Letourneur, the director of “Macaroni and Cheese” (“Les coquillettes”) did the same in Los Angeles and Chicago.\n\nHere’s the lineup of feature films:\n\n“40-Love” (“Terre battue”), Stéphane Demoustier\n\n“Challat of Tunis” (“Le Challat de Tunis”), Kaouther Ben Hania\n\n“Eat your Bones” (“Mange tes morts”), Jean-Charles Hue\n\n“Astragal” (“L’Astragale”) by Brigitte Sy\n\n“Portrait of the Artist” (“Le Dos Rouge”), Antoine Barraud\n\n“Sense of Humor” (“Le Sens de l’humour”), Marilyne Canto\n\n“Silvered Water” (“Eau argentée, Syrie autoportrait”), Ossama Mohammed, Wiam Simav Bedirxan\n\n“Story of Judas” (“Histoire de Judas”), Rabah Ameur-Zaïmeche\n\n“The Last Hammer Blow” (“Le Dernier coup de marteau”), Alix Delaporte\n\n“Vincent” (“Vincent n’a pas d’écailles”), Thomas Salvador\n\n“Young Tiger” (“Bébé Tigre”), Cyprien Vial\n\n“Chorus,” François Delisle\n\nShort films:\n\n“Ne parlez pas d’amour,” Hadrien Bichet\n\n“Errance,” Peter Dourountzis\n\n“Ses souffles,” Just Philippot\n\n“One, Two, Tree,” Yulia Aronova\n\n“Uncanny Valley,” Paul Wenninger\n\n“Maman(s),” Maïmouna Doucouré\n\n“Ni vu ni connu,” Lyes Salem\n\n“A Rebours,” Frédéric Mermoud"
