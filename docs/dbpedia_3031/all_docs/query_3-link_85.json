Working with virtual reality and new gaming technologies, these artists, filmmakers, journalists, media scientists, game designers and creative technologists present a peek at the dawn of a bold new cinematic world, through an unprecedented exploration of the most basic state of being.”\n\nIn addition to those announced today, films in the U.S. and World Competitions and NEXT <=> sections have been announced.
