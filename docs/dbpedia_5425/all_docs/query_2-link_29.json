The event will be held at the Italian Heritage Center on Sunday, April 28 (6:00 pm) in Portland, Maine.\n\nBoth standouts in competition, in the community and in the classroom, Scott and Ritmo will address their peers individually.

Wirths often wrote about the overachiever, the person small in stature who made a big difference, stories of the heart, people who made a real difference and was an inspirational leader. Each year the award is given to a student-athlete who best fulfills that narrative.\n\nA record 17 student-athletes were nominated for the Wirths Memorial Award from 10 Husky teams: field hockey's Hannah Banks (Belfast, Maine), Brooke Carson (Bryant Pond, Maine/Oxford Hills), and Kiklis; men's soccer's Jack Brady (Jensen Beach, Fla.), women's basketball's Campbell Doughty (Ashland, Va./Hanover), and Liz Cote (Conway, N.H./Kennett), softball's Madi Day (Otisfield, Maine/Oxford Hills) and Hannah Shields (Buckfield, Maine), baseball's Lucas Francis (Lisbon, Maine/Lisbon Falls), women's soccer and lacrosse's Kiaya Gatchell (Portland, Maine/Deering), women's soccer's Aly Veilleux (Manchester, N.H./Manchester Memorial), men's ice hockey's Tanner McClure (Buxton, Maine/Bonny Eagle) and Ritmo, women's ice hockey's Haley McKim (Moncton, New Brunswick/Mount Academy) and Maddy Young (Westford, Vermont/Essex), and men's track & field's Ethan Shain (Sanford, Maine) and Jack Pecoraro (Westbrook, Maine).\n\nThe Kimberly M.

Eighty-eight of USM's ~450 student-athletes who participate in one or more of the University's 22 Division III intercollegiate teams will be honored during the evening.\n\nProudly embracing the NCAA Division III philosophy, Huskies' Athletics places the highest priority on the overall quality of the educational experience and on the successful completion of all students' academic programs, maintaining an environment in which a student-athlete's athletic activities are conducted as an integral part of the student-athlete's educational experience. USM Athletics achieves this through the five key developmental areas: Academic Achievement, Athletic Performance, Personal Development, Career Development and Service to Community. Twenty-nine majors are represented by the Huskies' senior student-athletes with pursuits ranging from Studio Art to Social Behavioral Sciences, to Physics and Media Studies, and from Nursing to Mechanical Engineering.\n\nCollectively, the Huskies' ~450 student-athletes have an outstanding 3.23 grade point average and earlier this academic year a record 256 student-athletes were recognized this year as William B. Wise Scholar-Athletes. Each of the Huskies' 22 intercollegiate programs has representation among the 256 student-athletes that were honored.\n\n–cac–\n\nPlayers Mentioned\n\nEthan Rudnicki\n\n6' 1\"\n\nJunior\n\nMaggie Brock\n\n5' 2\"\n\nSenior\n\nJordan Cote\n\n5' 7\"\n\nSenior\n\n#1 Julianna Kiklis\n\nGK\n\n5' 8\"\n\nFifth Year\n\n#6 Hannah Banks\n\nF/M\n\n5' 3\"\n\nSenior\n\n#10 Hanni Johnson\n\nD\n\n5' 5\"\n\nJunior\n\n#11 Brooke Carson\n\nF\n\n5' 6\"\n\nSenior\n\n#14 Mary Keef\n\nM\n\n5' 5\"\n\nSenior\n\n#10 Aly Veilleux\n\nM\n\n5' 3\"\n\nJunior\n\n#20 Jack Brady\n\nM\n\n5' 7\"\n\nFreshman"
