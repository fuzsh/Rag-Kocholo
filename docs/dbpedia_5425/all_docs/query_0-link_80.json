        "text": "Page 177 →Notes\n\nIntroduction\n\n1. An outstanding exception is Lisa Jackson-Schebetta’s essay about how the coaction of race with the Spanish Civil War played out through Robeson and Ferrer. For more on “stealth Latinos” in American performance, see Brian Eugenio Herrera’s Latin Numbers.\n\n2. Samuel Sillen, “Paul Robeson’s Othello (1943),” Shakespeare in America: An Anthology from the Revolution to Now, ed. James Shapiro, New York: Library of America, 2014, 451–58, 457.\n\n3. In the United Kingdom, the 1923 Cymbeline at Birmingham Rep was the first major production in modern dress, and the 1938 Hamlet at the Old Vic starring Alec Guinness followed. It would be another few decades before Peter Brooks’s now legendary avant-garde A Midsummer Night’s Dream (1970) at the Royal Shakespeare Company, with a set consisting only of a white box and with numerous clowning techniques as well.\n\n4. In its first season in 1965, the Spanish Mobile Theater featured two plays by Spanish playwright Federico García Lorca, La Zapatera Prodigiosa (The Shoemaker’s Prodigious Wife) and Retablillo de Don Cristóbal (The Puppet Play of Don Cristobal), both performed in their original Spanish and directed by Osvaldo Riofrancos.\n\n5. Riofrancos had a repertory company, Primer Theatero en Español, that would make headlines the following year for performing at a club on the Lower East Side where “the privileged can’t get in.” See “Affluent Barred from Youth Club; Lower East Side Project Gives Poor a Theater,” New York Times, April 6, 1964. Dr. Riofrancos was dean of the School of Drama at the North Carolina School of the Arts and often directed for Papp.\n\n6. Juliá was to become the preeminent Latinx Shakespearean actor of his time, performing to great acclaim on both stage and screen in his decades-long career, but at this point he was still mostly an unknown. The year after this first experience in a Papp production, he recited a poem at a Puerto Rican poetry reading at the Delacorte and subsequently found himself cast by Papp as Demetrius in Titus Andronicus in 1967. But Juliá was still struggling financially after that, and he telephoned Papp to ask for a job. Papp made Juliá the house Page 178 →manager for Papp’s Naked Hamlet (see chapter 4) in 1968 (after Sheen left). Juliá’s career would take off in 1971 when he starred as Proteus in the John Guare / Mel Shapiro / Galt MacDermott musical Two Gentlemen of Verona.\n\n7. Mildred C. Kuner, “The New York Shakespeare Festival, 1966,” Shakespeare Quarterly, 17, no. 4 (Autumn 1966): 419–21, 421.\n\n8. “Proclamation of the State of New York Executive Chamber,” July 13, 1989, New York Public Library, Billy Rose Theatre Division (hereafter NYPL).\n\n9. In 1979 he played the role opposite Richard Dreyfuss as Iago, and in 1991 he starred opposite Christopher Walken as Iago; in both stagings he wore dark makeup to play the Moor.\n\n10. Other early intersections of Shakespeare and Latinidad did not survive funding challenges as well. These include the San Francisco performance group Luminarias, which staged the first all-Latinx The Winter’s Tale (1997) and disbanded shortly thereafter. Also, the New York–based Latino Shakespeare Company (2006), started by Alberto Bonilla and Roy Arias, “just kind of fizzled away.” They were unable to attain grant money because they were not performing a play with a Latinx theme. Alberto Bonilla, personal interview, March 25, 2014.\n\n11.

See Alan Pelaez Lopez, “The X in Latinx Is a Wound, Not a Trend,” ColorBloq, September 2018, https://www.colorbloq.org/article/the-x-in-latinx-is-a-wound-not-a-trend; Rachel Hatzipanagos, “‘Latinx’: An Offense to the Spanish Language or a Nod to Inclusion?,” Washington Post, September 14, 2018, https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2018/09/14/latinx-an-offense-to-the-spanish-language-or-a-nod-to-inclusion/. Merriam-Webster added “Latinx” to its dictionary in 2018. To note, while many also prefer terms based on region such as “Tejano,” heritage such as “Chicano,” or hyphenated terms such as “Nicaraguan-American,” a larger ethnic category, no matter what it is called, remains prominent colloquially and for government purposes.\n\n13. Douglas Lanier, Shakespeare and Modern Popular Culture, Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2002. 9.\n\n14. See Carla Della Gatta, “Shakespeare, Race, and ‘Other’ Englishes: The Q Brothers’ Othello: The Remix,” Shakespeare Survey, 71 (2018): 74–87; Alexa Huang, “What Country, Friends, Is This? Touring Shakespeares, Agency, and Efficacy in Theatre Historiography,” Theatre Survey, 54 (2013): 51–85.\n\n15. The World Shakespeare Festival (WSF) was hosted by the Royal Shakespeare Company and offered twenty-nine productions throughout the United Kingdom, eleven by the RSC, six by the RSC in collaboration with international Page 179 →theater groups, four by other British groups, and the remaining eight by international companies.\n\n16. In Toni Morrison’s Desdemona at the Barbican, Desdemona’s speeches were given in a spoken-word style of delivery, in contrast to Rokia Traoré’s voicing of the Black characters (including Othello, his mother, and his first wife). The absent Othello’s Blackness came through the Black African female voice and body, and a white American woman voiced and embodied the character of Desdemona. The Q Brothers’ Othello: The Remix at the Globe did not stage a biracial couple; actors played Emilia and Bianca, but Desdemona was portrayed only through the sound of her singing voice, prerecorded and played offstage. The RSC and Wooster Group joint production of Troilus and Cressida turned the warring Greeks and Trojans into British soldiers and Native Americans, respectively, with the Woosters donning redface makeup, muscular bodysuits, and using film and auditory tracks to reinscribe the sound of the Native American accent they attempted to portray. Will Tuckett’s all-British production of West Side Story in Newcastle reset the action to a vague setting, but the dialogue, lyrics, and ethnic slurs remained. The Jets put on a New York accent, and most of the Sharks attempted a pan-Spanish inflection in their speech that could not be described as specific to New Yorkers or to Puerto Ricans.\n\n17. I shift between “Latinx culture” and “Latinx cultures” as a reminder that identity terms homogenize and unite diverse peoples within one category.\n\n18. Cardenio went largely unnoticed by academics until Charles Hamilton’s 1994 book, William Shakespeare and John Fletcher: “Cardenio” or “The Second Maiden’s Tragedy”, attempted to prove through Hamilton’s knowledge of paleography that The Second Maiden’s Tragedy was in fact the missing Cardenio. A brief scholarly debate ensued, with a reading hosted by Professor Hugh Richmond at University of California, Berkeley, in the 1990s to debate if the script were really Shakespeare’s. Academics soon came to agreement that Hamilton’s claims were not valid, and Cardenio slipped back into hiding for almost another decade.\n\n19. Gary Taylor’s version had several read-throughs beginning in 2006, followed by stagings in 2009 in New Zealand and in 2012 in Indiana. Stephen Greenblatt cowrote an entirely new play with playwright Charles Mee that opened at the Boston ART in 2008, and it was followed by an international adaptation project that prompted new work from playwrights in ten countries. Bernard Richards’s version was staged in the United Kingdom in 2009, Ben Bartolone’s version in New York in 2010 and 2011, Hudson Shakespeare’s version in 2012, plus a number of productions of Double Falsehood during this period.\n\n20. For scholarly interest in Cardenio, see Roger Chartier, “Cardenio” between Cervantes and Shakespeare: The Story of a Lost Play, Cambridge: Polity, 2013; BarbaraPage 180 → Fuchs, The Poetics of Piracy, Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 2013; David Carnegie and Gary Taylor, eds., The Quest for “Cardenio,” Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2012; Terri Bourus and Gary Taylor, eds., The Creation and Re-creation of “Cardenio”: Performing Shakespeare, Transforming Cervantes, New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2013; and Arden Shakespeare’s publication of Double Falsehood, 2010.\n\n21. Neruda’s translation garners attention because of his fame, but his translation is not the most widely circulated or performed; as of 2012, Juan Cariola and Luis Astrana Marín are more popular in Chile. Paula Baldwin Lind, “Chilean Translations of Shakespeare: Do They Constitute a National Shakespeare Canon?,” Tradução em Revista, 12, no. 1 (2012): 61–80, 66. The Neruda translation would also greatly influence subsequent Latinx Shakespearean productions of Romeo and Juliet in the United States, as it was used in its entirety or for the Spanish-language portions of the production at Joe Papp’s short-lived Spanish Mobile Theater (1965), productions at Repertorio Español in New York (1979), Teatro Brava in Tempe (2004), the Florida State University (2005) production in chapter 2, New Brunswick Theater Festival in New Jersey (2010), Miami Dade County Auditorium (2016), the staged reading starring Daniel José Molina (Romeo from chapter 3) as Romeo through the Public’s Spanish Mobile Theater for its revival (2016), and Teatro Español en Mad Cow in Miami (2018).\n\n22. The only exception was the casting of Cuban American actor Frankie J. Alvarez in Ben Bartolone’s 2010 The Tragedie of Cardenio in New York. Bartolone’s adaptation ran again the following year but with another (non-Latinx) actor in the lead role.\n\n23.

Reid cites the French Joseph Ernest Renan, French Alfred Fouillée, French Argentine Paul-François Groussac, and Argentine Vicente Gregorio Quesada (pseudonym Domingo Pantoja), along with Darío, as possible influences for Rodó.

The Caliban trope appears in works from Aimé Césaire’s 1969 postcolonial play Une Tempête to Jamaica Kincaid’s 1985 novel Annie John, Richard Rodriguez’s 1982 influential autobiography Hunger of Memory, and as a character in Marvel comics, where Caliban is an albino mutant who speaks of himself in the third person. For how appropriations and adaptations work through the Caliban-Prospero-Ariel triangulation, see Thomas Cartelli, Repositioning Shakespeare: National Formations, Postcolonial Appropriations, New York: Routledge, 1999, 114–16.\n\n29. Despite these nuanced adaptations, The Tempest does not recur in the history of Latinx Shakespeares due to its problematic depiction of Caliban, who is native to the island and associated with the Caribbean, and therefore typically considered Latinx and/or Indigenous. The twenty-first century has seen several plays based on Caliban’s mother Sycorax as means to decenter the triangulation of Prospero-Caliban-Ariel. See Carla Della Gatta, “The Island Belongs to Sycorax: Decolonial Feminist Storytelling and The Tempest,” Women and Power Symposium, Shakespeare’s Globe, December 2021.\n\n30. “Vilma Silva on Shakespeare’s Work,” Oregon Public Broadcast, season 10, episode 1001, video clip, October 18, 2015, Opb.org; emphasis added.\n\n31. “Vilma Silva on Shakespeare’s Work.”\n\n32.

Falocco’s essay is an exemplary model of how revisiting the constructs of historical racial categories sheds light on those of today, and how methods for performing the Other, from dark makeup to foreign actor status to language to a villain role, have changed little in nearly 150 years.\n\n35.

According to a 2018 Pew Research poll, “While 61% of Hispanic immigrants in the US are Spanish dominant (and another 32% are bilingual), the share who are Spanish dominant drops to 6% among second-generation Hispanics and to less than 1% among third or higher generation Hispanics.” Mark Hugo Lopez, Jens Manuel Krogstad, and Antonio Flores, “Most Hispanic Parents Speak Spanish to Their Children, but This Is Less the Case in Later Immigrant Generations,” Pew Research, April 2, 2018, Pewresearch.org\n\n40.

Most of the Spanish translations used in Latinx Shakespeares are from Latin America (such as the popular Neruda Romeo y Julieta) or translated by Latinx artists for the productions and plays. US-based theater has a history fundamentally different from the tradition in Mexico of using translations from Spain. For more on translations used for Mexican productions, see Alfredo Michel Modenessi, “Of Shadows and Stones: Revering and Translating ‘the Word’ Shakespeare in Mexico,” Shakespeare Survey, 54 (2001): 152–64.\n\n46.

Some Latinx Shakespeares from this period include Romeo and Juliet riffs such as TEATRX’s Balcony Scene in Quarantine, Elaine Romero’s Wetback, which had a reading during the monthlong RomeroFest celebration, and the Public Theater’s audio play of Romeo y Julieta. Others include Del Shakes’s Twelfth Night, and Merced Shakespearefest’s Ricardo II.\n\n54. Even The Guardian reported on her heritage and her “Spanish lilt” in a press conference in 1967.

I was cast as a male—Tybalt in fact—because I was taller than everyone else in the group.

Theater by Latinx practitioners predates Valdez, but this is the starting point for modern and contemporary Latinx theater. Immediately following was the establishment of International Arts Relations (INTAR) in 1966 and the Puerto Rican Traveling Theatre (PRTT) in New York in 1967. In 1971, El Teatro Nacional de Aztlán (TENAZ) became the first network of theaters for Latinos. Repertorio Español opened in New York in 1971, GALA Hispanic Theatre in Washington, DC, in 1976, Thalia Hispanic Theater in Queens in 1977, and Teatro Avante in Miami in 1979.\n\n61.

The Latinx Theatre Commons was never an affinity space, and from the start it exemplified this type of community-building. It began with Latinx artists who formulated ideas for convenings and initiatives, and HowlRound, a theater organization that was also taking shape at the time and led by non-Latinx practitioners, provided the infrastructure.\n\n63.

There is an important and ongoing conversation about the relationship of Shakespeare’s plays to adaptations and appropriations. For a sampling of these arguments, see Christy Desmet and Robert Sawyer, eds., Shakespeare and Appropriation, New York: Routledge, 1999, on appropriation, Graham Holderness, Tales from Shakespeare: Creative Collisions. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2014, on “collisions,” Matthew Kozusko, “Beyond Appropriation: Teaching Shakespeare with Accidental Echoes in Film,” The Routledge Handbook or Shakespeare and Global Appropriation, ed. Christy Desmet, Sujata Iyengar, and Miriam Jacobson, New York: Routledge, 2020, 217–26, on “accidental echoes,” and Valerie M. Fazel and Louise Geddes, “Introduction: Bound in a Nutshell—Shakespeare’s Vibrant Matter.” Variable Objects: Shakespeare and Speculative Appropriation, Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2021, 1–18, on networks.\n\n72. This includes cultural adaptation (adapting for another culture), linguistic adaptation (or translation, which is a form of adaptation), appropriation (extending the characters or themes to a new story), and productions that integrate Latinidad as a concept for the show.\n\n73. The Guthrie’s 1969 staging of Julius Caesar had Latin American motifs. A Fidel Castro-like character appeared in a production of Caesar at the American Page 185 →Shakespeare Company in Stratford, Connecticut, in 1979, and the 1989 production of The Two Gentlemen of Verona at Shakespeare Festival Dallas. An Oliver North-like character was in the 1988 staging of Coriolanus at the Old Globe, and a vague Latin American setting was the framework for Julius Caesar at the Philadelphia Drama Guild in 1988. These cultural adaptations were not without real-life consequences. During the run of John Briggs’s Julio Cesar, produced at Florida Shakespeare in 1986, a planned publicity stunt in which the actor playing Castro/Cesar would be driven through Little Havana had to be canceled since several local leaders feared that people would think it was real, and feared for the actor’s life.

The four creators and multiple scholars Page 186 →report different working titles for the project, from East Side Story to Gangway to Romeo. Whether in the original concept the male was Jewish and the female Catholic or the opposite is also contested.\n\n6. “Telling the Story behind the Story behind West Side Story.” LA Times Blogs, Los Angeles Times Media Group, February 27, 2012, https://latimesblogs.latimes.com/culturemonster/2012/02/west-side-story-inspiration.html. According to the Los Angeles Times in 2012, the newspaper clipping that inspired Laurents and Robbins to change the story to Puerto Ricans narrated this: “Two young Hispanic men fought outside a dance at a community hall in 1955. One of them died” (“Telling the Story”). Laurents recalls the article entitled “Six Jailed in Fight Death,” about a street fight in San Bernardino, but this article ran a year later than Laurents’s account of reading it (“Telling the Story”).\n\n7. For all the stock that Laurents (writer) and Robbins (choreographer) placed in the notion of a culturally or ethnically rooted divide, composer Leonard Bernstein saw the presence of warring sides as “much less important than the bigger idea of making a musical that tells a tragic story in musical comedy terms, using only musical comedy techniques, never falling into the ‘operatic’ trap.” Nigel Simeone, Leonard Bernstein: West Side Story, Farnham, Surrey: Ashgate, 2009, 17. This hybrid genre of tragedy in a musical comedy form thus also furthered the affective quality of division.\n\n8. In the Heights was written by Quiara Alegría Hudes, with music by Lin-Manuel Miranda. It had a workshop in 2005 in Connecticut, went Off-Broadway in 2007, and to Broadway in 2008. The 2015 musical Hamilton (book and music by Miranda) solidified new possibilities for casting and representation on Broadway.\n\n9.

Crawford withdrew from the show before its premiere and was replaced by Robert E. Griffith and Hal Prince. Sondheim said, “[Cheryl Crawford] said the essential reason she was withdrawing from the show was, she wanted us to explain why these kids were the way they were. We are making a poetic interpretation of a social situation, but she wanted it to be more realistic” (606). Laurents also said, “I have a letter from her saying she wanted to see how the neighborhood changes from immigrant Jews to Puerto Ricans to blacks” (607). Then Robbins said, “My version of Cheryl’s withdrawal is very simple: she couldn’t raise the money” (607).\n\n10.

Alberto Sandoval-Sánchez, José, Can You See? Latinos On and Off Broadway, Madison: University of Wisconsin Press, 1999, addresses both the musical and film in his deconstructive analysis to establish how the (Puerto Rican) Sharks pose a threat to the spatial ownership of the (white) Jets. Frances Negrón-Muntaner, “Feeling Pretty: West Side Story and Puerto Rican Identity Discourses.” Social Text, 18, no. 2 (2000): 83–106, levels several critiques of the film’s depiction of Latinx, as well as commentary on how the Jewish and queer origins of the musical (and its creators) affect the portrayal of the Sharks. Regarding the film, Ernesto Acevedo-Muñoz, West Side Story as Cinema: The Making and Impact of an American Masterpiece, Lawrence: University Press of Kansas, 2013, argues that it offers a harsher view of the Jets than the Sharks, Deborah Paredez, “‘Queer For Uncle Sam’: Anita’s Latina Diva citizenship in West Side Story,” Latino Studies, 12, no. 3 (2014): 332–52, attends to Rita Moreno’s Anita as a feminist and queer performance of the “affective ambiente central to Latina/o assertions of cultural citizenship” (333), Brian Eugenio Herrera, Latin Numbers: Playing Latino in Twentieth-Century U.S. Popular Performance, Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press, 2015, examines the changes for the screen that heighten racist tropes applied to the Sharks, and Lauren Davine, “‘Could We Not Dye It Red at Least?’: Color and Race in West Side Story,” Journal of Popular Film and Television 44, no. 3 (2016): 139–49, analyzes the use of color as part of racist tropes.\n\n17.

Bob Fosse, whose choreographicPage 188 → career began in the 1950s, would contribute greatly to this shift in his famous musicals in the 1960s.\n\n24. Similarly, Maria is absent from “America,” the Sharks girls’ greatest song-and-dance number, and her only all-girls’ number is in the scene in which she sings “I Feel Pretty.” Tony and Maria dance together once, during the “Somewhere” ballet, which is placed outside the “reality” of the musical and is from a dance style that was associated with the feminine.\n\n25.

It eliminated de facto discrimination in the form of quotas against southern and eastern Europeans, as well as Asians. Instead, it “gave preference to professionals with skills in short supply” and those with relatives who were US citizens.\n\n27. In 1950, the three racial categories on the census were White, Black, or Other. In 1960, census takers were instructed to record people from Puerto Rico and Mexico, as well as other persons of Latinx descent, as White, unless they were visibly either Indigenous or Black. In 1970, a 5 percent sample of households was asked to indicate whether they were “of Spanish Origin.” Hispanic (now Hispanic/Latino) identity was finally included as a census question in 1980, when it was added as an ethnicity question, separate from race. More recently, in 2013, the Census Bureau announced that it was considering including Hispanic as a racial (rather than ethnic) category for the 2020 census (Krogstad), but this change was not implemented.

Arellano writes, “Many blacks, of course, have naturally kinky hair, so at some point over the centuries, chino became an ethnicon (a term meant to comment on an ethnic group’s prominent cultural characteristic that become popular shorthand for said characteristic) for both ‘black person’ and ‘curly.’”\n\n43. Laurents, “West Side Story,” 199.\n\n44. In the original Broadway run, only one other male Shark, Toro, was played by a Latinx actor: Erne Castaldo (who understudied Chino and played the role on the national tour). In the film, Mexican actor Rudy Del Campo played Shark “Del Campo.” Along with Chita Rivera and Rita Moreno as Anita, on Broadway and in the film respectively, these were the only Latinx in the casts.\n\n45. Shakespeare, Romeo, I.i.8.\n\n46. In Eric Minton’s documentation of over fifteen hundred professional Shakespeare productions (75 percent of them in the United States) from 2011 to 2016, Romeo and Juliet was second only to A Midsummer Night’s Dream. But Romeo and Juliet comprised less than 6 percent of productions. See Eric Minton, Page 190 →“Ranking the Bard’s Plays by Stage Popularity,” Shakespeareances.com, October 13, 2017, http://www.shakespeareances.com/dialogues/commentary/Bard_Board_Popularity-171012.html\n\n47. In total, only four plays by Latinx playwrights made it to Broadway before the twenty-first century (all of which came after West Side Story): Short Eyes by Miguel Piñero (1974), Zoot Suit by Luis Valdez (1978), Cuba and His Teddy Bear by Reynaldo Povod (1986), and Freak, the one-man show by John Leguizamo (1988). Also, in 1966, María Irene Fornés debuted a play, The Office (dir. Jerome Robbins), that closed after nine previews.\n\n48. The United States does not have a national reading requirement for secondary education, but Common Core requirements stipulate that high school students are assigned at minimum one Shakespeare play. In 2013, scholar Jonathan Burton surveyed four hundred high school teachers nationwide and determined that Romeo and Juliet was taught “in roughly 93% of all ninth grade classes.” Jonathan Burton, “Shakespeare in Liberal Arts Education,” Rock Magazine, Whittier College, Fall 2013, https://issuu.com/whittiercollege/docs/13-116_wc_f13_mag_final_printer_fil\n\n49. The facility of the play as an ensemble piece even affected Pablo Neruda’s now-famous translation (see introduction). Neruda originally wanted to translate Othello, but it was felt that there was not a Chilean actor with the capacity for the title role. See David Schidlowsky, Neruda y Su Tiempo: Las Furias y Las Pena, vol. 2: 1950–1973, Santiago de Chile: RIL, 2008, 1092.\n\n50. Paz also problematically connects his notion of isolation as key to the contemporary Mexican psyche; he argues that the legacy of colonization left Mexicans with a feeling of loneliness due to not being either purely Spanish (European) or Indigenous. That said, social scientists have begun to utilize the construct of fatalismo to adjust mental and physical health services for Latinx, arguing that cultural differences need to be accounted for in order to make treatments effective. See Luis M. Añez et al., “Application of Cultural Constructs in the Care of First Generation Latino Clients in a Community Mental Health Setting,” Journal of Psychiatric Practice, 2, no. 4: 221–30; and American Psychological Association Office on AIDS, Resource Guide for Adapting SISTA for Latinas, American Psychological Association, accessed July 2015, https://hiv.rutgers.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/SISTA_Latina_Resource_Guide.pdf\n\n51. Scholar Robert Sawyer has made a similar connection of the feeling of loneliness in both Shakespeare and the laments of country music. See also Yolanda Broyles-González on ranchera music. Gustavo Arellano examines the mournful singer Morrissey’s large following in Mexico, as is evidenced in such Mexican Morrissey cover bands as Mex Moz. Arellano argues that the themes of Morrissey’s music and persona relate to a feeling of isolation due to his northern English, working-class, and nondescript gender identity, through emotional music. See Gustavo Arellano, ¡Ask a Mexican!, New York: Scribner, 2007.\n\nPage 191 →52. The role of Bernardo was first played by a Latino only in 1980, with Puerto Rican dancer and actor Héctor Jaime Mercado. Bernardo was also performed by Venezuelan George Akram in 2009. In the 2020 Ivo Van Hove production, he was played by Amar Ramasar, who is of Puerto Rican and Indo-Trinidadian descent, and in the 2021 film by David Alvarez, who is Cuban-Canadian.\n\n53. Moreno was the only Puerto Rican in the film’s cast. She would later become the second Latinx actor, and also second Puerto Rican, to win an Oscar (Best Supporting Actress, West Side Story). The first was José Ferrer (who played Iago to Paul Robeson’s Othello onstage; see introduction), for his work in Cyrano de Bergerac in 1950.\n\n54.

Laurents’s partner had seen a Spanish-language production in Colombia and reported back to Laurents that the language had transformed the show; the Sharks were the heroes and the Jets were the villains. Not accounting for the important role that a Spanish-dominant country played in this change in dynamic, Laurents translated this concept onto his new Broadway production.\n\n63. In Puerto Rico in 1942, Spanish was taught in grades 1–2, English was a subject in grades 3–8, and English was primary (with Spanish as a subject) in grades 9–12. In 1947, Puerto Rico passed a bill for all-Spanish education, but President Truman vetoed it. From 1949 to the present, Spanish has been the Page 192 →“medium of instruction at all levels with English as mandatory subject.” See Alicia Pousada, “Being Bilingual in Puerto Rico,” 2011, accessed October 1, 2021, http://aliciapousada.weebly.com/uploads/1/0/0/2/10020146/being_bilingual_in_puerto_rico2.pdf\n\n64.

Sondheim insisted that the translation adhere to strict rules regarding the need for rhyme and pacing when sung, constraining the ability for textual translation to contribute significantly to cultural translation. Sondheim instructed Miranda that the lyrics had to rhyme for the English listener. Ultimately, the production rested on the idea that the rhyming of the lyrics outweighed a straightforward linguistic translation of the original lines.\n\n66.

Producing a bilingual show on Broadway is nearly unheard of, and it was felt that audiences were not yet prepared for this convention. Stuart Hecht writes: “Broadway’s commercialism makes [the musical genre] generally slow to change, hesitant to get too far ahead of its audience’s tastes or beliefs for fear of losing paying customers.” See Stuart J.

Chino’s asexuality is all the more evident in contrast to Maria’s virginal readiness for sex. Tony and Maria meet in a pseudo-private space underneath the bleachers where she instigates through dance and makes an aggressive first move on Tony so much that he is taken aback. The next morning, she moves in sync to the music as she covers up the evidence that she has had a (yet unconsummated) illicit visit with Tony on the fire escape. At the end of “One Hand, One Heart,” she says suggestively to Tony, “Come see me tonight,” and they consummate their love.\n\n96. “When Tony reacts to Maria’s kiss, he says, ‘You just caught me by surprise is all. I’m a by the book type, so,’ to which Maria responds, ‘By the book?’ . . . And when they part on the fire escape, she calls him back. Maria says, ‘I forgot why I call you,’ and Tony replies, ‘I’ll wait till you remember.’” Della Gatta, “West Side Story.” See Shakespeare, Romeo, I.iv.221 and II.ii.212–13, respectively.\n\n97.

It also satisfies this desire for a modern audience, updating Shakespeare’s play through contemporary acting methods and storytelling styles. Aspects of Method acting based on Konstantin Stanislavsky’s principles were interpreted, and misinterpreted, by his American successors such as Stella Adler, Sanford Meisner, Lee Strasberg, and others. Laurents said, “Like [producer] Hal [Prince], Jerry [Robbins] had been a George Abbott disciple. For West Side Story, he switched to Stanislavsky: he was going to direct the first Method musical.” See Arthur Laurents, Original Story By: A Memoir of Broadway and Hollywood, New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 2000, 357.\n\n99. The title of West Side Story in Spanish is Amor sin Barreras, or “Love without Borders.” In translation, the “and” is nonexistent as well, and the title connotes that division can be surmounted by one thing: love.\n\n100. Because of West Side Story’s influence as a musical, and an excessive aural soundscape as germane to theatrical depictions of Latinidad, oftentimes the cultural-linguistic divide manifests in the Shakespeare films addressed here through the musical soundtrack. Although Zeffirelli and Luhrmann did not direct “musical” versions of Romeo and Juliet, the musical scores were key to the success of their films (much as with West Side Story), both of which include Latina-inflected Juliets (in the casting of Hussey in the former and the affective ethnicity of the Capulets in the latter). The Love Theme from Zeffirelli “was issued as a single from the soundtrack album that accompanied the film’s release.” Robert Shaughnessy, “Romeo and Juliet: The Rock and Roll Years,” Remaking Shakespeare: Performances across Media, Genres and Cultures, ed. Pascale Aebischer, Edward J. Esche, and Nigel Wheale, New York: Palgrave Macmillan, Page 195 →2003, 172–89, 185.

Similar to how Olivia Hussey’s fair skin and blue eyes do not adhere to visual generalizations of Latin Americans, Mexican actor Rodrigo Escandón Cesarman, who played the little boy, has also been perceived to be white (non-Latinx / Latin American). Ruben Espinosa writes, “When he [Tybalt] finally draws his pistol, he aims it not at the nearby Montagues, but instead at a well-dressed, fair-skinned young boy, whose eyes, the close-up shot makes clear, are as blue as can be. Through this act, Tybalt, played by Columbian [sic] American actor John Leguizamo, stands as a threat not only to the white Montagues, but—as a Latino—to all white people” (48). Such colorism-based misidentifications reinforce a generic and homogeneous idea of Latinx and Latin American peoples.

The adaptation used the Pablo Neruda translation (see introduction) for the Spanish portions. About one-quarter of the production was in Spanish, including some of Romeo’s monologues. Antonio Ocampo-Guzmán, telephone interview, November 21, 2011. Trained in Linklater Voice / Freeing the Natural Voice, Ocampo-Guzmán realized that a primary challenge that bilingual actors have is that acting methods are monolingual. He later became the first person to translate the Linklater method into Spanish, and he trains Spanish-speaking and bilingual Linklater coaches.\n\n2. The actress playing Juliet was Nicaraguan, Romeo was Cuban American, and Lady Montesco was from Central America. According to Ocampo-Guzmán, Lady Montesco had a “bit darker complexion, Lord Montesco and Romeo were Cuban but looked white, Juliet looked more Italian” (telephone interview). The actor playing Benvolio was Central American and the actor playing Samson was Mexican; both spoke a “textbook Spanish” (telephone interview).\n\n3.

Ocampo-Guzman, “My Own Private Shakespeare,” 129.\n\n7. Older translations can provide a greater cohesion with Shakespeare’s English, so much that they can sound temporally similar. For example, a bilingual reviewer of Shakespeare on the Rocks’ 2015 Romeo y Julieta misidentified the 1872 translation by Matías de Velasco y Rojas as “Renaissance Spanish.” Estefania Seyffert, “Romeo and Julieta Opens Door to Future Bilingual Productions in the Borderlands,” Borderzine, December 10, 2015, https://borderzine.com/2015/12/romeo-and-julieta-opens-door-to-future-bilingual-productions-in-the-borderlands/.

Switching between languages may include forms of bilingualism, interlingualism, languaging, code-switching, or more. “Bilingualism implies moving from one language code to another, while interlingualism implies the constant tension of two (or more) languages at once.” Martha J. Cutter, Lost and Found in Translation: Contemporary Ethnic American Writing and the Politics of Language Diversity, Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 2005, 177. Code-switching, or shifting between languages, takes many forms of language play. Code-switching includes intrasentential switching, the repetition of phrases in another language; extrasentential switching, the completion of a thought in a different language than the beginning of the line; and tag-like switches, intermixing within one phrase. Languaging is the “thinking and writing between languages.” Walter Mignolo, Local Histories / Global Designs: Coloniality, Subaltern Knowledges, and Border Thinking, Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2000, 226.

Laird Williamson, “Director’s Notes,” program for Romeo and Juliet, Ashland: Oregon Shakespeare Festival, 2012. Katherine Gillen and Adrianna M. Santos misread this comment of Williamson’s to claim that the production was “complicit with Spanish fantasy narratives,” but it refers to the flashback/dream of the Nurse, which was made clear and explicit in performance and detailed in the archival theater ephemera. See Gillen and Santos, “Borderlands Shakespeare,” 565–67.\n\n48.

Gillen and Santos strangely categorize this production as set in “Borderlands spaces” though there is nothing to indicate a borderlands epistemology in the dramaturgy or script, nor a geographical adjacency to what is now the US-Mexico border; the wide geography of Alta California crossed seven (or 14 percent of) contemporary states in the United States.\n\n50.

Mercutio sang the lyrics, “Maria, La Pastora,” and the Nurse joined him for “mató a su michito.” The popular story of La Pastora shifted in music from a romance to a ballad, with lyrics changing over time and region from Latin America to Alta California.

More recently, rhetorician Victor Villanueva expresses a similar notion: “The indigenous, Latinxs, and Latin Americans of this hemisphere really do not have a decolonial option—in that we are subject to English or to Spanish, subject to racism, subject to world trade in what is essentially an oligopoly, and the like. Yet we cannot simply throw up our hands.” Victor Villanueva, “Foreword,” Decolonizing Rhetoric and Composition Studies: New Keywords for Theory and Pedagogy, eds. Iris D. Ruiz and Raúl Sánchez, v–viii. New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2016, vii. For more on the many theorizations of decoloniality, see Amanda M.

While oftentimes these terms are used interchangeably, and scholars around the world define them differently, “decoloniality” is a way of thinking positioned against Western domination, “decolonialism” argues that colonial power structures remain in regions that are no longer colonized, and to “decolonize” is to liberate people (or a curriculum) from dominating forces, assumptions, and values.\n\n22. David Crystal, “Early Interest in Shakespearean Original Pronunciation,” Language and History, 56, no. 1, (May 2013): 5–17, 15. Received Pronunciation (RP) or the “Queen’s English” is a standardized speech method dating back to the nineteenth century. The BBC adopted the accent as its broadcasting standard in 1922, and it was used in education and for Shakespearean performance in the United Kingdom throughout the twentieth century.\n\n23.

The production was staged the same year as the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1968, more commonly known as the “Fair Housing Act.” It was also the year that the Chicago street gang the Young Lords reformed to model themselves after the Black Panther Party. The New York chapter of the Young Lords would be founded in July 1969.\n\n27. Joseph Papp, “For Program,” typewritten notes, n.d., NYPL.\n\n28. Sheen has intermittently embraced acting in Spanish. In 2016, he starred in the film The Vessel (dir. Julio Quintana). The film was shot entirely in both Spanish and English, so there was no need for subtitles. It is set in an unnamed Latin American country and was filmed in Puerto Rico. Sheen spoke the Spanish for his part well enough, and any flatness in his accent could be considered in character for his role as a visiting American.\n\n29.

Ramon was described by one scholar as “this Jose-Jimenez portion of Hamlet.” Traci, “Joseph Papp’s Happening,” 77. Traci’s reference invokes both an insult and a perceived threat in society. José Jiménez was a comical and later considered derogatory character played by comedian Bill Dana. Dana was Page 210 →Hungarian-Jewish, and his Bolivian Jiménez gained popularity in the 1960s and appeared on several variety shows. José Jiménez was also the name of the leader of the Young Lords; in 1968, after Jiménez served time in jail and read the work of Malcolm X and Martin Luther King Jr., he publicly announced that he would reform the Young Lords to be modeled as a human rights group after the Black Panther Party, with whom they would later form the Rainbow Coalition along with the Young Patriots Organization, and soon after several other organizations.

Papp met Piñero in 1973 and in 1974 produced his play, Short Eyes, which became the first play written by a Puerto Rican to appear on Broadway.

Hamlet (Dan Donohoe) spoke most of the Ghost’s lines, leaving the audience without the full translation.

Half of Hamlet’s famous soliloquies remained in the play, and they were abbreviated to make room for Papp’s contemporary dialogue and plenty of pantomime, circus, and musical bits. “O, that this too too solid flesh” (I.ii.), and “O, what a rogue and peasant slave am I!” (II.ii.) were delivered by Sheen as Hamlet (sans accent). For “What a piece of work is man” (II.ii), Hamlet removed his Ramon clothes to deliver the speech, without accent.\n\n38. Papp, William Shakespeare’s “Naked” Hamlet, 147.\n\n39.
