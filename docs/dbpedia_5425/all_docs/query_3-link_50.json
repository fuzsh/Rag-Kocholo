Why it is that Lawrence Exeter has lived all these years at the top without anyone questioning his story? Quite easily the most idolized man in Hollywood, yet no one knows anything about him and how he arrived there. Only the closest to the family know the secrets of his life and they are\n\nOrson Welles was passionate about film. By the young age of 25, he had directed, produced, and starred in what is today considered by most to be the greatest movie ever made, Citizen Kane. About a year later, Welles began work on his next film project, The Magnificent Ambersons. Based on the novel of the same name by Booth Tarkington, The Magnificent Ambersons tells the story of a falling aristocratic family in a\n\nJoseph Jefferson’s career consist of quite a collection works , that powerfully but positively impacted the entertainment industry during his time. Joseph Jefferson was one of the greatest in his field during his lifetime and is still respected today by some for his great works, appearances, and contributions to the entertainment industry.

He led a great successful life leaving behind an extraordinary legacy behind as this paper will go in depth about. To explain not only his personal family life, including both him growing up and the family he was the head of. It’ll also focus on the wonderful contributions\n\n​Since the beginning of cinema, the world has been introduced to many types of films, genres, and actors that influence how cinema is today. In the ever changing world of cinema, there will always be role models that actors and directors look up to for inspiration. As viewers, it’s important that we feel emotion throughout the production. There have been many actors and directors that have caused such a high impact and influence in the world of film, that it’s hard to forget them in years to come. One of the many popular actors/directors described is Clint Eastwood. Eastwood has been more influential than many people think. Eastwood has helped expand and inspire the world of cinema to what is it today.\n\nAs one writer puts it, “As an actor, he (Eastwood) does not waste words; as a director, he does not waste images.” Eastwood was intimidated by acting at first, saying, “I thought I was an absolute clod. It looked pretty good but I thought, “If that is acting, then I am in trouble.” His first successful television series, Rawhide, ran for seven years and was the last show to be filmed exclusively in black and white, which was a major success for Eastwood. Eastwood made his mark as a successful actor in the years ahead, which not only increased his self-confidence but also led him to the world of directing. In 1968, Eastwood created Malpaso Productions, which was his own film production company and in 1972, he was appointed by President Nixon into the National Council of Arts. In 1979, Eastwood was named the only actor to be in the box office Top Ten for an entire decade. By 1985, Clint Eastwood was on the cover of the New York Times Magazine. It is impossible to limit Eastwood’s success to one specific fact due to the length of his career which is why it is important to give credit where credit is due, to his greatest\n\nSpencer Tracy was a major star of Hollywood’s Golden Age. In the span of his 37-year screen career, he won two out of the nine Academy Awards he was nominated for. In 1930, he had a lead performance in The Last Mile, which caught Hollywood’s attention. Tracy signed with Fox Film Corporation and within his five years and 25 films with Fox, remained unknown to the public. He then joined Hollywood’s much acclaimed studio, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, with which his career thrived with a series of hit films. He won an Oscar for Captains Courageous and Boys Town and became a top star at the studio. In the duration of his career, Tracy appeared in 75 films and was known among his peers as one of the screen’s greatest actors. He was ranked as one of the top\n\nMany students are in one shape or form familiar with the work of the American writer, Nathaniel Hawthorne (1804-1864.) Much of his very influential themes have in one way or another been incorporated in movies that are now popular among teenagers for example the movie starring Emma Stone, “Easy A.” (Gluck) This particular movie has a reference to one of Hawthorne’s most well-known and read books “The Scarlet Letter.” It has been proven that a more recent trend among teenagers is that they are no longer reading as many books as they were in decades prior, this includes reading for classes in school and for pleasure at home. (Alter) The former book reading has been replaced by movie viewing and screenwriters see this as an opportunity in order to import some educational information from which the viewers can benefit from. “The Scarlett Letter” has several references to Puritan religion that Hawthorne grew up knowing well. (Gollin) This leads to the question to which extent and whether or not Hawthorne was influenced by his life events when writing his many novels?\n\nThe genre of fantasy was changed and impacted by Hans Christian Anderson and his writings. He played a major role in the literary world in the 1800s. He introduced new ideas to the genre, and gave a new twist on old styles. Anderson left a legacy in the world of fairy tales, and his works are still purchased and enjoyed today. One of his most famous and prominent works include The Little Mermaid. This book epitomizes Andersons unique and fantastical writing style; while still influencing writers as well as readers still today.\n\nFranz Kafka is a Jewish, German writer born in the late 19th century (1883) in Prague and is well-known amongst the figures of 20th century literature. His most famous works include The Metamorphisis, The Castle, Amerika and the book I read, The Trial. All of these works define Kakfa’s writing as writing that focuses on existential security, understanding, absurdity, and nihilism. Franz Kafka was born into a middle-class, but was not exempt from extreme tragedy. He had three sisters, and by the time he was 6, both his younger brothers had died in their early childhood. Kafka also didn’t have a healthy relationship with his parents, especially his father. His mom wasn’t very educated and didn’t share the amount of passion her son had for being a writer. But his father was far worse, he controlled the household and was very restrictive for Kakfa’s passion for art and writing. Kakfa seems to mirror this personal experience in many of his novels, for example, in The Trial, the Court is so powerful and oppressing that K. is completely helpless, The Castle also has the same type of entity that mirrors Kafka’s father and the tyrannical component of his personality.\n\nCharlie Chaplin was a very important British comedian, director, writer, and composer in the entertainment industry during the 1920’s. He was born on April 16, 1889, in London, England. Both of his parents were both in the entertainment industry, which would reflect how he became apart of the entertainment industry, too. When he was 12, he would play the role as a paperboy in the show, “Sherlock Holmes.” This would be his first ever stage show. After this, he would realize what he wanted to do, and that was to become a comedian in vaudeville, which would also take him to the United States in 1910 as a featured actor with the Fred Karno Repertoire Company. This would be the start of a career that would last and be famous for it, too. As being part of the Karno troupe, he would get his first tastes of America. He would also immediately grab the attention of Americans through his sketch named, “A Night in an English Music Hall.”\n\nIn Oscar Wilde’s “ The Uncensored Picture of Dorian Gray”, Dorian Gray’s character is a highly influenced young man who is unable to maintain a stable relationship. It is shown that he destroys every relationship he has, by pushing his partners to a mental breaking point. However, in the book it is evident that Dorian lived in an unstable home, growing up, with a psychologically and verbally abusive uncle. Due to the lack of love and reoccurring abuse Dorian faced as a child, it has influenced him to destroy every relationship in which he was becoming emotionally attached to because he is afraid of getting hurt again.\n\nCharlie Chaplin was a world famous film star, director, and producer throughout the 1900s who lived an incredible life and found varying levels of success throughout his career. As one of the film pioneers, he helped to shape the film industry during the early 1900s and paved the way for other artists to follow him. While his career was filled with controversy, he remains a legend in the film industry and his works are still respected and loved by many audiences. Charlie Chaplin produced an incredible legacy, one that is easy to see through his background and life history, his lengthy career in film, and the historical context in which he worked.\n\nA tramp, a gentleman, a poet, a dreamer, a lonely fellow, a great humanitarian, always hopeful of romance and adventure, Charlie Chaplin gave more than immense to the film industry by his weird tips and tricks of directing the movie and his hotshots. His bravo skills in acting and his passion for his work made his iconic figure of “Charlie Chaplin” from Charles Chaplin (who is a lesser known guy apparently). He believed in human values and was against the concept of war. He being an aficionado of black humour, made a tragic comedy ‘The Great Dictator’ (1940) and went on to two other war driven comedies, ‘Shoulder Arms’ (1918)"
