But it also intrigued me, reminding me of the tragedy of Orson.\n\nFor anyone that knows, Orson Welles was an old filmmaker, radio host, who was obsessed with food, however, he was also deeply obsessed with Shakespeare and Tragedy, as the two go hand in hand.\n\nThe parallelism of Welles and Shakespeare are like bread and butter, they both complement each other equally. It is hard to say why Welles’s life was so tragic. In some cases it could’ve been from misfortune, in others he could’ve brought it on himself. Whatever it was, Shakespeare's tragedies were relatable and enhanced his tragic life."
