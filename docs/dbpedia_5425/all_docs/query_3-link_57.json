        "text": "Letters, postcards, diaries and doodles from a teenage Orson Welles, along with unpublished scripts of his many incomplete projects from the ’50s and ’60s, have been acquired by the University of Michigan. The items, which came from his youngest daughter, Beatrice Welles, add to the already extensive trove of Welles memorabilia that the university holds as part of its Screen Arts Mavericks & Makers collection.\n\nThe new acquisitions include heavily annotated scripts for well-known films like “Chimes at Midnight” and “The Immortal Story.” But also in the archive are screenplays that scholars and fans of Welles, who died in 1985, had heard about but never seen, from his many, many projects that didn’t reach the screen. Among them, scripts for “Ulysses,” “The Unthinking Lobster” and “Operation Cinderella.” There’s also a script for “Fountain of Youth,” the pilot for a television series for Desilu Productions; the pilot made it to the air and won a Peabody but the series was never produced.\n\n“He hated anything scholarly,” she said.\n\nBut the University of Michigan’s collection was already impressive, thanks to extensive donations from, among others, Chris Wilson, the son of Richard Wilson, Welles’s longtime associate. “When I saw what they had, I thought this is the place to add to, and hopefully people will follow suit,” Ms. Welles said. “With what I have given them, it’s probably the best collection in the world.”\n\nTwo years ago, the university bought, for an undisclosed sum, eight boxes of papers from Oja Kodar, a Croatian actress who was Welles’s partner and lover during the last years of his life.\n\n“And gosh, what a ship this is!,” young Welles wrote. “They speak of floating hotels in reference to liners, but this is more.”\n\nThe university’s acquisition comes weeks after the production team working to complete Welles’s unfinished final project, “The Other Side of the Wind,” announced that it had teamed up with Netflix, and was on track, after years of fits and starts, to at last finish the picture."
