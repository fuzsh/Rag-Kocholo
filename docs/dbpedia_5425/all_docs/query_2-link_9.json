        "text": "Van Beuzekom's performance illuminates the triumph and tragedies of an enigmatic genius, in an intimate setting\n\nBy Michael C. Moore Mmoore@Kitsapsun.Com 360-792-9218\n\nREVIEW\n\n'rosebud: the lives of orson welles'\n\nWho: Paradise Theatre School\n\nWhat: One-man show by Mark Jenkins, performed by Erik Van Beuzekom\n\nWhere: Mount Baker Block, Studio 36 (211 Taylor St.), Port Townsend\n\nWhen: Through Sept. 29; 5 p.m. Sept. 21 and 22, 8 p.m. Sept. 28 and 29\n\nTickets: $15\n\nInformation: 360-643-3493, theparadisetheatreschool.org, 360.838-3006, brownpapertickets.com\n\nOrson Welles, in your face\n\nPORT TOWNSEND — In \"Rosebud: The Lives of Orson Welles,\" Erik Van Beuzekom plays a larger-than-life character in a smaller-than-necessary venue.\n\nMore people should, and will, want to see Van Beuzekom's superb performance in Mark Jenkins' one-man chronicle of the life of the enigmatic Renaissance Man-wunderkind who gave us \"War of the Worlds\" and \"Citizen Kane,\" and whose mystery still revolves around his ability to be so very good at so many things, so early in his life.\n\nBut seats are limited in the little studio (David Noble's Noble Arts space) down the street from the Rose Theatre in downtown Port Townsend, where Van Beuzekom is inhabiting Welles for two more weekends (through Sept. 29) before the displaced show (the actor and his wife and director Pattie Miles Van Beuzekom) are involved in a rebuilding and repermitting process for their Paradise Theatre School digs, which \"Rosebud\" will help to fund, as will a planned December run at Seattle's West of Lenin theater, and possibly other to-be-announced dates). There would've been the same problem in their snug Chimacum home, though: Welles was such an intriguing creative force; Jenkins' play about him so well written and constructed; and Van Beuzekom's portrayal of him so convincing, that sold-out rooms should be the norm.\n\nAnyone who's seen Van Beuzekom perform in Paradise productions — from Iago in \"Othello\" to Johnny in Pattie's own noir drama, \"Blood Orange Bakersfield\" — know he can go bigger than life. And that's an absolute necessity in portraying Welles, the actor-writer-director and jack-of-all-trades who was good at everything, but perhaps best at rubbing his peers the wrong way. Of his own childhood, when his precociousness and array of talents earned him acclaim and scrutiny from the age of 3, he tells the audience, \"I was unmatched in the annals of babyhood,\" but then asks, \"Do you have any idea what all this adulation does to an impressionable child? He begins to believe it and ... he becomes a pain in the ass.\"\n\nHis baritone alternately whispering and booming and his look changing from the cocky young Welles to the disillusioned fat man who was crushed by the public's dismissal and his own self-loathing in the later stages of his career (he died in 1985, at 70), Van Beuzekom narrates Welles' life, his triumphs and tragedies, opening portals to the man's genius and his flaws.\n\n\"Dad invented car lamps,\" he says of his father, Richard Hodgdon Head Welles, while recalling his privileged but damaging childhood, \"about the time cars needed lamps. And then he drank himself to death as a form of self-congratulation.\"\n\nDuring the nearly two-hour show (with a 15-minute interval), Van Beuzekom is in constant speech and motion, re-enacting a snippet of \"War of the Worlds,\" discussing the mystery of \"Rosebud,\" recounting his first meeting with Rita Hayworth and his constant battles with the Hollywood studio establishment and eventually the government at the height of its anti-Communist witch-hunting.\n\nIt is a gargantuan task, and Van Beuzokom handles it all — even the part where he dons a grotesque fat suit to portray the fading Welles, using eat and drink to substitute for the gratifications he was no longer allowed to pursue on other stages.\n\nThe transformation is gradual, but still stunning. It is a melancholy, trodden-upon Welles in attendance for much of the second act.\n\n\"Falstaff and Hal; we all play both roles during our lifetimes,\" he says at one point, gesturing at his ample girth and conceding that he has moved from his Henry IV persona to the overindulgent Falstaff.\n\nVan Beuzekom's portrayal is no revelation — he's a wonderful actor. But the scrip does contain several eye-openers, and some of \"Welles'\" topics of conversation pertain way more to present-day issues than one might think possible. At one point he recalls President Franklin D. Roosevelt, \"in his wisdom, deciding to put people back to work, even the actors and the artists.\" His eyes twinkle miscieviously as he says it, and one can't help but think of Obama's Jobs Act, languishing in a quagmired Congress for more than a year.\n\nThe monologue is sharp and funny. He refers to William Randolph Hearst, on whom he partially based his Charles Foster Kane, as \"the man who did for newspapers what Stalin did for the camping holiday in Siberia.\" But the shows hinges on Van Beuzekom's credibility, and he never wavers. He is by turns charming, hilarious and chilling — never moreso than in the telling of Welles' meeting with an enraged Hearst after \"Citizen Kane\" was released, which led to a boycott of Welles in Hollywood.\n\nFor more mature playgoers, \"Rosebud\" is a chance to relive the phenomena of Welles, from the years when he seemed to be ahead of the curve in all things to his last days, when he scraped for jobs in order to keep his glass filled and the dessert tray in easy reach.\n\nFor others, it's a chance to learn a little something — about Welles, about fame, about human nature, and about history.\n\nEither way, it's an evening of theater not to be missed."
