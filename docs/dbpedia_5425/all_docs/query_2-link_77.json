        "text": "One of the reasons I love my friend Cathy Hoke is that she has this really incredible ability to reframe things in a way that make them doable. Tackle-able. Last week, we were chatting about self-care, and I admitted to her what I admitted on LinkedIn last week: that I felt like I was always waiting to \"do\" self-care until I had a block of time. As always, Cathy flipped it on me. \"What could you do with 30 minutes?\" she said. \"Um...nothing?\" I joked. But I know the truth: there's a TON I can do in a half hour. Sit in a chair out in the sun. Read a few chapters of a book. Water my plants (hey, for me that IS self-care!). Journal. Watch the birds. Annoy my cat (also self-care). Actually eat lunch without looking at my phone. The list goes on and on. This afternoon, I decided to test the 30-Minute Self-Care Theory. There's a You-Pick flower patch 10 minutes from my house. Could I drive there, pick a bouquet, and get back home in 30 minutes? Yes. Yes I could. Again, it's a good reminder that there's never going to be a perfect time for self-care. You gotta make time. And it's even better when there's a bouquet of flowers at the end of that 30 minutes. ‚ù§Ô∏è\n\nThis is my first summer that I'm trying to grow (and let's be honest, keep alive) something other than flowers and plants, and the irony of gardening is something that I can't help but relate back to business ownership. Sometimes, you have a clear plan with what exactly you're looking to cultivate. You buy the seeds, you research the best practices for growth, and you diligently nourish the plants until they bloom. Case in point: these tomatoes and sweet peppers. And then there are the times that you don't plan. In fact, you don't even know something's growing until you walk outside to refill your bird feeders and realize that a bunch of rogue sunflower seeds have translated into a patch of slightly wonky, yet completely recognizable sunflowers in an unexpected place. I've gotta say: I love both parts of being an entrepreneur. The plans that come to fruition with care and diligence, and the happy accidents.\n\nWhen I start working with ghostwriting clients, one of the questions I always ask is, \"Who are 1-2 people in your life or your network that are always making you think differently?\" I ask this question for a simple reason: getting started with sharing your own expertise and perspectives can be overwhelming, especially if you've really never given it much thought. One of the best ways you can start forging your own path‚Äîwhether it's posting on LinkedIn or identifying what you'd like to speak on a stage about‚Äîis to take a look at the paths of others. In my experience, doing this helps with the overwhelm. It gives you something to react to. It helps to be able to bump up against something and say, \"Do I agree with this? Do I disagree? What's my take?\" Per usual, I've got a list, but the person that really does this for me is Sarah Greesonbach. I've been in Sarah's orbit for awhile, but I think I truly fell in love with her when she started gaming the \"Top Voice\" questions on LinkedIn by writing the most hilarious answers. She was the first one in my network who actively said, \"This is dumb, and I'm going to have some fun with it.\" It reinforced that it was okay for me to feel the exact same way. I've never told her this (but I guess I'm telling her now...hi, Sarah!) but her posts and honesty have given me permission to be transparent and unrelenting in my own opinions. Your turn: Who are the people in your life or network that are always making you think differently?\n\nA few weeks ago, I saw a post from Amy Blain. She relayed a story about how she had been buried under a pile of work, had a jam-packed calendar, a to-do list a mile long, and an excess of overwhelm and exhaustion. She made a choice that went against every instinct in her body‚Äîto step away from all of it and attend a nature retreat being offered by Amanda Nowak. Like Amy, I have a \"don't stop, keep going\" mentality. I have this story I've told myself every since I started working at 22 years old: If I stop, I'll fall behind. What I've been learning lately, though, is if I DON'T stop, I'll fall behind. So I've stopped \"waiting\" for self-care to fit perfectly into my schedule. Because when summer's over, I'm not going to remember all the meetings I had or the tasks I dutifully crossed off my to-do list with my favorite trusty pink highlighter. I'm going to remember the sunset boat rides on our '87 Cobalt, the dinners with friends, the antique shopping adventures with my mom, and the ripening of the first tomatoes I've ever grown. ü•∞ (PS: Amanda, the next time you have one of your retreats, I am SO there.)\n\nWhile traveling back to Door County from Minneapolis for a family funeral a few weeks ago, I attempted to work in the passenger seat while my husband drove us home. It only took about 10 minutes before I started to feel queasy, and had to shut my laptop. Turns out I can't work in a moving car. Who knew? I was annoyed. I had banked on being able to work on the way home to catch up on some things. I had missed two full days of work and felt overwhelmed and behind the 8-ball. Two things I HATE feeling. All the same, I regretted these words the moment they came out of my mouth. \"ARGH. Why does life always have to get in the way of work?!?\" I didn't even have to look at my husband to see the look on his face. The funeral was for my husband's uncle. He had passed away after a long illness, and it had been a tough (and yet therapeutic) two days of remembering him and spending time with family. \"I am SO sorry. That was so, SO uncalled for. I'm just so overwhelmed. I feel like I'm missing all these deadlines and I'll never be able to catch up.\" \"I understand. It just hurts to hear you say that. Because life is SO much more important than any deadline you have. We're still here. We get to keep living our lives for however long we have.\" He's right, obviously. And I know he's right. Ever since we had that conversation, I've been thinking about it. How my metrics for success have always been work-related, but never life-related. I don't have any grand lesson or way to neatly tie up this post. All I know is that I never want to say that sentence out loud again. I want to work, not work to live. A huge shout-out to my husband for making me realize that I want to do life differently. Here's us, doing a little living this week. ‚ù§Ô∏è\n\nA reminder that our next episode of \"Don't Feed The Freelancers\" is tomorrow, and it's going to be a good one. Why? Because we're talking all about client red flags‚Äîboth the ones you can pick up on before you start working with someone, and...the ones you learn the hard way. üôÉ Rochelle and I will be chatting about: üö© A few of Rochelle's and my personal experiences with difficult clients, and how it helped them hone their \"red flag radar\" üö© Signs that a client or a situation might veer into red flag territory üö© How to address challenges and tricky situations with clients that start giving off the red flag vibe üö© How to use your learnings to establish boundaries and determine your future client roster üö©The exact tips and tricks we use to make a TRILLION DOLLARS A YEAR. (Put that last one in to see if anyone's paying attention üòÇ) RSVP here: https://lnkd.in/dtR8VRNy\n\nOkay, full transparency time: I SUCK at responding to comments on LinkedIn. And this isn't a great thing to \"suck\" at, especially if you view LinkedIn as a way to build community and you want people to engage with your content. I'm honestly not sure why I'm so bad at commenting. I'm on LinkedIn all the time. I could easily reply to the comments I get. And yet, I'm always telling myself, \"I'll do it later.\" Later inevitably never comes, and all the people that took the time to leave a thoughtful comment are probably like, \"Mel, get your stuff together.\" That's something I'm actively working to improve, so I'm making a deal with y'all. This week, I'm going to respond to EVERY comment I get on a LinkedIn post. I want to make commenting a habit, just like I've made posting a habit. Your turn: what's something that you're actively looking to improve on, and what are you learning through the improvement process?"
