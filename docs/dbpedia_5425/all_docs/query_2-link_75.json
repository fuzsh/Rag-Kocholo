They were presented at an awards luncheon as part of the Best Bank Expo at the MGM Springfield.\n\nThe prestigious Banking Choice Awards are presented by American Business Media and Customer Experience Solutions LLC. Unlike typical “popularity contests,” these awards are given based on interviews with hundreds of thousands of banking customers in a double-blind format. No financial institutions are involved in collecting the data, which is then used to create the highly respected Banking Benchmarks. Customer Experience Solutions is the recognized leader in measuring and tracking customer experience for banking institutions.\n\nVincent M. Valvo, president and CEO of American Business Media, said, “Customers can choose to bank wherever they want. The Banking Choice Awards determine which banks do it best.”\n\nSugar River Bank, located in Newport, NH, won the Bronze award for Community Contribution in New Hampshire.\n\nEarning the Community Contribution award is significant because it’s based on input from people who are not customers of those institutions. “Unlike the other categories, this is a rating by prospects (non- customers) of each bank. So, to win top prize, banks had to not only make strong contributions to their local areas, but they also had to get the word out about that contribution,” Paul said. “The winners in this category are not only great contributors but are also great marketers as well. You can see from the diversity of top performers that massive marketing spend does not always translate into prospects’ minds, but very strategic spend does. This is how a smaller bank can compete with and sometimes outperform much bigger banks.”\n\nMark Pitkin, President & CEO of Sugar River Bank, said “I am so pleased and proud that the bank won in the Community Contribution category as it demonstrates how much we care for the communities we live and work in. As a local, hometown bank this is critical to our mission.”\n\nSugar River Bank Announces Employee’s Recent Graduations\n\nNewport, NH – Sugar River Bank is pleased to announce the recent graduations of two employees from the New England School for Financial Studies at Babson Executive Conference Center in Wellesley, MA.\n\nJeannine Everitt, Senior Accountant, joined the Bank in 2016. She previously worked at the Evans Group in Enfield, NH, as their senior staff accountant. Ms. Everitt graduated from Franklin Pierce College with a Bachelor’s degree in Accounting. She resides in Goshen with her husband and daughter.\n\nJillian Cummings, Executive Assistant/Commercial Credit Analyst, joined the Bank in 2015. She previously worked as a credit analyst for Mascoma Savings Bank. Ms. Cummings graduated from Roger Williams University with a Bachelor’s degree in Finance. Ms. Cummings resides in New London with her husband and twin sons.\n\nMark Pitkin, President and CEO, stated that “Sugar River Bank is proud of Jeannine and Jillian for achieving this accomplishment! The two-year program is very rigorous and we thank each of them for taking time out of their busy lives to successfully complete all requirements. The newly acquired knowledge and skills of both dedicated team members strengthens the Bank’s mission and its commitment to superior customer service.”\n\nAbove: Jillian Hurd and Jeannine Everitt\n\nSugar River Bank announces New Branch Manager for Main Office in Newport and new Vice President/IT Officer.\n\nNewport, NH – Sugar River Bank is pleased to announce Rhonda Rollins as the new Branch Manager of their Newport office.\n\nSugar River Bank recently hired Rhonda Rollins as the Branch Manager in Grantham where she worked for the past year and a half.
