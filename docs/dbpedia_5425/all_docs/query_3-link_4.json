        "text": "His father, Richard Head Welles, was a well-to-do inventor, his mother, Beatrice (Ives) Welles, a beautiful concert pianist; Orson Welles was gifted in many arts (magic, piano, painting) as a child. When his mother died in 1924 (when he was nine) he traveled the world with his father. He was orphaned at 15 after his father's death in 1930 and became the ward of Dr. Maurice Bernstein of Chicago. In 1931, he graduated from the Todd School in Woodstock, Illinois. He turned down college offers for a sketching tour of Ireland. He tried unsuccessfully to enter the London and Broadway stages, traveling some more in Morocco and Spain, where he fought in the bullring.\n\nRecommendations by Thornton Wilder and Alexander Woollcott got him into Katharine Cornell's road company, with which he made his New York debut as Tybalt in 1934. The same year, he married, directed his first short, and appeared on radio for the first time. He began working with John Houseman and formed the Mercury Theatre with him in 1937. In 1938, they produced \"The Mercury Theatre on the Air\", famous for its broadcast version of \"The War of the Worlds\" (intended as a Halloween prank). His first film to be seen by the public was Citizen Kane (1941), a commercial failure losing RKO $150,000, but regarded by many as the best film ever made. Many of his subsequent films were commercial failures and he exiled himself to Europe in 1948.\n\nIn 1956, he directed Im Zeichen des BÃ¶sen (1958); it failed in the United States but won a prize at the 1958 Brussels World's Fair. In 1975, in spite of all his box-office failures, he received the American Film Institute's Lifetime Achievement Award, and in 1984, the Directors Guild of America awarded him its highest honor, the D.W. Griffith Award. His reputation as a filmmaker steadily climbed thereafter.\n\nOrson was already famous as a boy wonder when he directed and starred in his first film - Citizen Kane (1941) - at the age of 26. Since his1938 radio version of The War of the Worlds spread nationwide panic theatre, radio, stage and eventually television magnified the legend of the Faustian showman and flawed genius which would continue beyond his death in 1986 with a disputed legacy of uncompleted films. His problems with Holywood began early The Magnificent Ambersons (1942) which was cut by a third while Welles was in Brazil filming a documentary - It's All True - which was abandoned. To restore his reputation he allowed Journey Into Fear (1943) to be directed by an associate and tamely followed the rules on The Stranger (1946), Delirium returned with The Lady From Shanghai (1948) co starring his then wife Rita Hayworth. That same year saw Macbeth the first of three powerful Shakespeare films then his memorable Harry Lime in The Third Man. Othello was made over several years in between acting jobs as was Confidential Report (aka Mr Arkadin) with particularly chosen actors. Don Quixote begun in 1955 remained unfinished. Touch of Evil (1958) was a last experience of Hollywood before he returned to odd acting roles and production in Europe. An adaption of The Trial (1962) benefited from substantial European funding while Chimes at Midnight (1966) followed a stage production. French television funded The Immortal Story (1968) and in1973 he produced F for Fake. His last completed film retraced his past glories with Othello (1978) but there were some 60 appearances in other films culminating in The Muppet Movie (1979) and after his death Someone to Love (1988)"
