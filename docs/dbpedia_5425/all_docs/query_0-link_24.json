Orson Welles (1915-1985) was an American actor, director, writer and producer best known for his innovative work in theater, radio, and film. Some of his most famous works include his 1938 radio adaptation of The War of the Worlds which caused widespread panic, and the 1941 film Citizen Kane which is consistently ranked as one of the greatest films ever made. Throughout his career, Welles pushed creative boundaries in his use of techniques like deep focus shots and unusual camera angles, but often struggled for creative control in Hollywood's studio system. He is widely considered one of the most influential directors in cinema history.",
