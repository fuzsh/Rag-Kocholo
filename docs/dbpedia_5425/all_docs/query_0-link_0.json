He married Beatrice Ives in 1903, in Chicago. The couple had two sons including Orson Wells.\n\nIn an interview with Dick Cavett in 1970, Orson Wells spoke of his father:[1]\n\nMy father lived in Peking for quite a long time and I spent five or six years there.... and he stayed in Peking just because the living was easy there. He liked to live au prince - in a very grand way ... He was born with a lot of bread and cast it on the waters and it failed to return; the only way he could really live it up was in Peking where you could have 400 servants and give dinner parties with gold plate and have columns of ice with trees of orchids frozen into them. For a mere pittance - relatively speaking. And that's what brought us to Peking.\n\nHe died in Chicago, in 1930, at the age of 58. Several of his documents, in his older years, add the middle name Hodgdon, however, his birth certificate and his World War I Draft Registration card (written in his own hand) list only the middle name, his mother’s maiden name, Head.\n\nFact: Burial in Green Ridge Cemetery , Kenosha, Kenosha County, Wisconsin, USA\n\nThe Cook County, Illinois, Marriages Index, 1871-1920 shows the marriage date as 21 Nov 1903.\n\nSources\n\n↑ Orson Welles Interview [The Dick Cavett Show], 17:18 - 17:57 min: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NTOSevzp4w\n\nRichard Head Welles (1872-1930) on Find A Grave: Memorial #44258881 retrieved 04 May 2020\n\n1880 United States Federal Census; 1910 United States Federal Census\n\n\"United States Census, 1920,\" database with images, FamilySearch (https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:MJQH-Y1C : accessed 1 May 2020), George O Wells in household of Richard H Wells, Chicago Ward 21, Cook (Chicago), Illinois, United States; citing ED 1158, sheet 1A, line 43, family 13, NARA microfilm publication T625 (Washington D.C.: National Archives and Records Administration, 1992), roll 331; FHL microfilm 1,820,331.\n\nCook County, Illinois, Marriages Index, 1871-1920\n\nIllinois, Deaths and Stillbirths Index, 1916-1947\n\nU.S., Find A Grave Index, 1600s-Current\n\nU.S., World War I Draft Registration Cards, 1917-1918\n\nWeb: Wisconsin, Find A Grave Index, 1836-2012\n\nWisconsin, State Censuses, 1895 and 1905\n\nCook County, Illinois, Marriages Index, 1871-1920\n\nThis week's featured connections are Acadians: Richard is 17 degrees from Joseph Broussard, 17 degrees from Louis Hebert, 19 degrees from Antonine Maillet, 17 degrees from Roméo LeBlanc, 18 degrees from Aubin-Edmond Arsenault, 19 degrees from Louis Robichaud, 20 degrees from Cleoma Falcon, 21 degrees from Rhéal Cormier, 20 degrees from Jack Kerouac, 20 degrees from Maurice Richard, 21 degrees from Ron Guidry and 22 degrees from Beyoncé Knowles-Carter on our single family tree.
