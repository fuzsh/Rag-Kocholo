        "text": "While the universe of film, TV, radio, and music stars glitters with stories of people who made good after childhoods in which they were underrated or underappreciated, their potential not recognized, Orson Welles was early recognized as a comet that would blaze a dazzling trail.\n\n“The word genius was whispered into my ear, the first thing I ever heard while I was still mewling in my crib,” Welles told biographer Barbara Leaming. He began mewling on May 16, 1915, christened George Orson Welles, the child of Dick and Beatrice.\n\nA head wound suffered by the young Orson brought a doctor named Maurice Bernstein into the Welles’ home. The doctor immediately sprouted the opinion that the boy was a prodigy, a genius in the making. He began calling him Pookles and Orson developed the nickname Dadda for Dr. Bernstein as the two of them began a mentor-student relationship.\n\nDadda initiated a young Orson into a group of adults in Chicago’s music scene, which convened at the home of critic Ned Moore. Orson learned, as young as five or six, to mingle like an adult, and was told that like him mother he’d be a musician.\n\nBut he first saw the stage as an actor, playing roles in productions of Samson and Delilah and Madame Butterfly.\n\nThe careful cultivation from his mother and from Dadda--who had an all-too-close relationship with Beatrice before and after the latter’s separation from Orson’s father--took a sharp turn in 1924, when Beatrice died of acute atrophy of the liver.\n\nOrson spent several months over the next year traveling the globe with his father.\n\nEventually, after the initial shock from his mother’s death and a time of adjustment, Orson was enrolled in the Todd School in Woodstock, Illinois. There, he dived headlong into acting, writing and directing plays. He played the classic roles of Richard III, Marc Antony, and Cassius, and once, according to Orson Welles by Barbara Leaming, “both Androcles and the Lion.”\n\nAt Todd, Orson developed a style as a confident, talented, slightly flamboyant over-achiever, but one who was admired more than he enjoyed many intimate friendships. He was openly fawned over by the school’s headmaster, Roger “Skipper” Hill, and his classmates noticed.\n\nOne of them, Hascy Tarbox, told Leaming, “Orson would’ve been better off if he hadn’t had so much adulation, and he’d had to play ball with the rest of the world.”\n\nHowever easy life really was on Welles, it was about to get tougher. At the age of fifteen, he lost his second parent, when his father died in a hotel fire.\n\nWhile Welles had traveled with his father after the death of his mother, this time he went it alone, striking out for Ireland. There, he made it to Dublin’s Gate Theatre, where he auditioned for Hilton Edwards and Micheal MacLiammoir, winning the role of the Duke in Jew Suss.\n\nHis character made his entrance into the production disheveled, hair askew, having raped Jew Suss’s daughter. Though it was a small role, it won acclaim for Welles, including a glowing notice from The New York Times. A confident, brash eighteen-year-old, Welles had momentum and every reason to believe he was on the cusp of a stellar acting career.\n\nHe nabbed other roles in productions at The Gate, including those in The Dead Ride Fast, The Archdupe, Death Takes a Holiday, and Hamlet.\n\nHe returned to Todd and to various drama-oriented projects, but a more formative experience came in Morocco. There, Orson met a curator at a Dutch museum with whom he was able to tag along for a brief stay at the palace of Thami el Glaoui, Pasha of Marrakesh. It was the scene of dancing, music, feasting, and the favors of royal concubines.\n\nHowever, it was back in the states where Orson made the acquaintance of now-noted playwright Thornton Wilder. Wilder put the young thespian in touch with Guthrie McClintic and Katharine Cornell, who were assembling a cast of characters for a lengthy theatrical tour. One performance of Romeo and Juliet garnered for Orson the praise of the Chicago Tribune: “He reads the Queen Mab speech with merry flourishes, and he plunges into the duel scene with a fine fury of swordsmanship.”\n\nThus, Welles was poised and ready to break into true stardom.\n\nSources\n\nLeaming, Barbara.

It is made all the more poignant by the personal, wistful turn the discussion takes. Dressed in a Navy blue jacket with a sky blue shirt and an ascot, Welles says that not long ago he’d begun thinking he was 70 when really only 69, meaning that he’d given himself an extra year. He told Griffin that he experienced “certain parts of every day that are joyous,” continuing, “I’m not essentially a happy person, but I have all kinds of joy.” On the difference between the two, he said, “joy is a great big electrical experience, but happiness is...a warthog can be happy.” He died in the early morning, slumped over his typewriter, of a heart attack. He’d been, as in life, working on a script for one of his crammed schedule of projects. It was a script for a TV show tentatively titled “Orson Welles Solo.” Welles was cremated and a stark funeral was hastily arran\n\nOrson Welles 1984\n\nWhile Orson Welles never acted in or produced any version of George Orwell’s Novel 1984 , he is associated with the work because of the similarity in named. Some people think Orville Wright invented really good popcorn, or that Bill Cosby sang “White Christmas.” This is the same phenomenon. However, there’s no reason not to know what Welles was doing in 1984. It was the year in which he voiced the lead chipmunk in a film called Enchanted Journey . He also played a supportive role (Klingsor) in Where is Parsifal ? a film that holds the distinction of bringing together Tony Curtis and Erik Estrada. For Orson Welles, 1984 was not the highlight of his career, but I’d guess that for Welles, Orwell’s 1984 was a great read.\n\nOrson Welles: Introduction\n\nBest known as the director of Citizen Kane and for the radio broadcast of H.G. Wells 's \"War of the Worlds,\" Orson Welles was a polymath who excelled as an actor, writer, director, and producer on radio, film, and television. In fact, his reach went so far as television commercials, and by the end of his life, he was a household name for his Paul Masson wine commercials (\"we will sell no wine before its time.\") Welles was the director of (in addition to Citizen Kane ) The Magnificent Ambersons, The Lady From Shanghai , Touch of Evil, and Chimes At Midnight. In addition to playing major roles in some of these films, he also starred in the classic The Third Man and has more than a hundred screen acting credits to his name. Orson Welles began his career on stage, directing plays under the Federal Theatre Project and then with his company Mercury Theatre. He took the Mercury Theatre to the Air , becoming a radio celeb with broadcasts of productions of va"
