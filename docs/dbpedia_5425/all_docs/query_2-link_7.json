        "text": "Ancestors Descendants\n\nProfile last modified 27 Jun 2024 | Created 3 Oct 2014\n\nThis page has been accessed 11,131 times.\n\nBiography\n\nOrson Welles is Notable.\n\nOrson Welles was an American actor, director, writer, and producer who worked in theater, radio and film. He is considered one of the greatest directors of film.[1]\n\nGeorge Orson Welles was born May 6, 1915, in Kenosha, Wisconsin, son of Richard Head Welles, an inventor and manufacturer, and Beatrice Ives Welles, a theatre enthusiast. He was named after his paternal great-grandfather, influential Kenosha attorney Orson S. Head and his brother George Head.[2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9][10][11]\n\nOrson's acting debut came at the innocent age of 2, in an opera production of Madame Butterfly. Orson's mother died when he was only six, so he spent his younger years with his father, travelling the world. His only formal education came at the age of ten, when he spent five years at the Todd School in Woodstock, Illinois, where his love of theatre was fed and encouraged by headmaster, Roger Hill. Upon finishing there at age 16, he traveled the world again, acting where he could and gaining popularity, often concealing his age in order to get jobs.[1]\n\nOnce Orson returned stateside, he started his Broadway career, courtesy of Katharine Cornell. Much like the rest of his career, his reception was hot and cold-some loved how large his presence was on stage, and others found him to hog the spotlight. While pursuing his Broadway work, Orson supplemented his income with radio performances, including the voice of the wizard, \"The Shadow\".[1]\n\nOrson was an innovator and master of the theatrical world. During his years on the radio, he was so convincing in his presentation that he frightened a nation into thinking an actual Martian invasion was happening in New Jersey. Despite his genius, his films were often disliked by critics, and his erratic behavior off-screen earned him a negative reputation.[1]\n\nHis film and theatre productions were approached from new vantage points, often controversially like facist presentation of Julius Caesar for The Mercury Theater, which disbanded in 1939 and later his all-black cast of MacBeth. Orson took his creativity to the West Coast, putting together his Mercury production company. One of his best known roles was in the film he also wrote and directed, Citizen Kane, widely considered one of the greatest films of all time, though it did not gain many accolades until years later. In fact, it seems that many believe critics were too harsh to many during the middle of the twentieth century, and chief among those wronged was Welles.[1]\n\nOrson spent much of his adult life around Europe, first in Spain for many years, then in Italy and Morocco, acting as he was able, and producing films here and there. He was discouraged and troubled with money after the failure of his film, \"Around The World in 80 Days\", which he had funded substantially himself.[1]\n\nOrson was a large man, standing 6'2\" and weighing over 200 pounds, with a personality that was just as large, as well as brash. His flat feet kept him from serving in the Army during World War II, but he was able to tour as a magician to buoy troop moral. His act included sawing Marlene Dietrich in half.[1]\n\nOrson's first marriage was to Virginia Nicholson, and ended in divorce. They had one son together, Christopher.[1]\n\nOrson's second wife was his costar from his movie, \"The Lady From Shanghai\", Rita Hayworth. They were married in 1943 and divorced not long after the movie was released in 1948. They had one daughter together, Rebecca.[1]\n\nOrson's third wife was Paola Mori, an Italian actress who co-starred with him in his film, \"Mr. Arkadian\". They were married in 1955 and had one daughter together, Beatrice.[1][2]\n\nOrson died October 10, 1985 in Los Angeles, California of a heart attack. He was buried in Chapel of the Pines, Hollywood, California.[1][2][3][12][13]\n\nAwards and honors\n\n1933: Stage production of \"Twelfth Night\" for the Todd School for Boys received first prize from the Chicago Drama League after competition at the Century of Progress Exposition of 1933 Chicago World's Fair.\n\n1942: \"Citizen Kane\" was nominated for numerous prizes at the 1941 Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Director and Best Actor in a Leading Role.

I feel foolish, really foolish. ... I made piece of film and said that I was in Spain, and thanked them.\"\n\n1975: Given the American Film Institute Lifetime Achievement Award.[1]\n\n1976: Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word or Non-Musical Album for \"Great American Documents\", shared with Helen Hayes, Henry Fonda and James Earl Jones.\n\n1978: Presented with the Los Angeles Film Critics Association Career Achievement Award.\n\n1979: Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word or Non-Musical Album for the original motion picture soundtrack for \"Citizen Kane\".\n\n1979: Inducted into the National Radio Hall of Fame.\n\n1982: In Paris on February 23rd, presented with the Order of Commander of the Légion d'honneur, the highest civilian decoration in France, by President François Mitterrand.\n\n1982: Nominated for Best Supporting Actor in a Motion Picture at the Golden Globe Awards for his role in \"Butterfly\", the same role that had him nominated for the Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Supporting Actor, won by Ed McMahon in the same film, which also won the award for Worst Picture.\n\n1982: Won a Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Recording for his role on \"Donovan's Brain\".\n\n1983: Made a member of the Académie des Beaux-Arts.\n\n1983: Awarded a Fellowship of the British Film Institute in 1983.\n\n1984: Presented the D.

These other Welles films were nominated for the AFI list: \"The Magnificent Ambersons\" (1942, director/producer/screenwriter); \"The Third Man\" (1949, actor); \"Touch of Evil\" (1958, actor/director/screenwriter); and \"A Man for All Seasons\" (1966, actor).\n\n1999: Ranked as the 16th Greatest Male Star of All Time by The American Film Institute.\n\n2002: A highly divergent genus of Hawaiian spiders Orsonwelles is named in his honor.\n\n2008: A statue of Welles is sculpted by Oja Kodar and erected in the city of Split.\n\n2013: On February 10, the Woodstock Opera House in Woodstock, Illinois, dedicated its stage to Welles, honoring the site of his American debut as a professional theatre director.\n\nSources\n\n↑ 1.00 1.01 1.02 1.03 1.04 1.05 1.06 1.07 1.08 1.09 1.10 1.11 1.12 Orson Welles Is Dead At 70; Innovator of Film and Stage, New York Times, 11 Oct 1985.
