        "text": "George Orson Welles (/ˈwɛlz/; May 6, 1915 – October 10, 1985) was an American actor, director, writer and producer who worked in theater, radio and film.\n\nSpouse(s)\n\nVirginia Nicolson\n\n(married 1934–1940)\n\nRita Hayworth\n\n(married 1943–1947)\n\nPaola Mori\n\n(married 1955–1985)\n\nPartner(s)\n\nDolores del Río (1938–41)\n\nOja Kodar (1966–85)\n\nChildrenChristopher Welles Feder\n\nMichael Lindsay-Hogg\n\nRebecca Welles Manning (1944–2004)\n\nBeatrice Welles\n\nParents\n\nRichard Hodgdon Head Welles\n\nBeatrice Ives Welles\n\nAwards\n\n1941 Best Writing (Original Screenplay) for Citizen Kane\n\n1970 Academy Honorary Award\n\nHe is best remembered for his innovative work in all three media: in theatre, most notably Caesar (1937), a groundbreaking Broadway adaptation of Julius Caesar; in radio, the debut of the Mercury Theatre, whose The War of the Worlds (1938), is one of the most famous broadcasts in the history of radio; and in film,Citizen Kane (1941), consistently ranked as one of the all-time greatest films.\n\nAfter directing a number of high-profile productions in his early twenties, including an innovative adaptation of Macbeth and The Cradle Will Rock, Welles found national and international fame as the director and narrator of a 1938 radio adaptation of H. G. Wells' novel The War of the Worlds performed for the radio anthology series The Mercury Theatre on the Air. It reportedly caused widespread panic when listeners thought that an invasion by extraterrestrial beings was occurring. Although some claim these reports of panic were mostly false and overstated, they rocketed Welles to notoriety.\n\nHis first film was Citizen Kane (1941), which he co-wrote, produced, directed, and starred in as Charles Foster Kane. Welles was an outsider to the studio system and directed only 13 full-length films in his career. While he struggled for creative control from the major film studios, his films were heavily edited and others remained unreleased. His distinctive directorial style featured layered and nonlinear narrative forms, innovative uses of lighting such as chiaroscuro, unusual camera angles, sound techniques borrowed from radio, deep focus shots, and long takes. He has been praised as a major creative force and as \"the ultimate auteur.\" Welles followed up Citizen Kane with critically acclaimed films, including The Magnificent Ambersons in 1942 and Touch of Evil in 1958.\n\nIn 2002, Welles was voted the greatest film director of all time in two British Film Institute polls among directors and critics, and a wide survey of critical consensus, best-of lists, and historical retrospectives calls him the most acclaimed director of all time. Well known for his baritone voice, Welles was a well-regarded actor and was voted number 16 in AFI's 100 Years... 100 Stars list of the greatest American film actors of all time. He was a celebrated Shakespearean stage actor and an accomplished magician, starring in troop variety shows in the war years.\n\nEarly life\n\nGeorge Orson Welles was born May 6, 1915, in Kenosha, Wisconsin, son of Richard Hodgdon Head Welles (b. 1873, Missouri, d. December 28, 1930, Chicago, Illinois) and Beatrice (née Ives; b. 1882 or 1883, Springfield, Illinois, d. May 10, 1924, Chicago). He was named after his paternal great-grandfather, influential Kenosha attorney Orson S. Head, and his brother George Head, and was raised Roman Catholic.\n\nDespite his family's affluence, Welles encountered hardship in childhood. His parents separated and moved to Chicago in 1919. His father, who made a fortune as the inventor of a popular bicycle lamp, became an alcoholic and stopped working. Welles's mother, a concert pianist, played during lectures by Dudley Crafts Watson at the Chicago Art Institute to support her son and herself; the oldest Welles boy, \"Dickie\", was institutionalized at an early age because he had learning difficulties. Beatrice died of hepatitis in a Chicago hospital May 10, 1924, at the age of 43, just after Welles's ninth birthday.\n\nAfter his mother's death Welles ceased pursuing music. He was taken in by Dudley Crafts Watson and lived with the family at Watson's family home, \"Trillium Dell\", on Marshman Avenue in Highland Park, Illinois. At the age of ten Orson, with Watson's third daughter, Marjorie (of the same age), ran away from home. They were found a week later, singing and dancing for money on a street corner in Milwaukee.\n\nOn September 15, 1926, Welles entered the Todd School for Boys, an expensive independent school in Woodstock, Illinois, that his older brother had attended for ten years until he was expelled for misbehavior. At Todd School Welles came under the influence of Roger Hill, a teacher who was later Todd's headmaster. Hill provided Welles with an ad hoc educational environment that proved invaluable to his creative experience, allowing Welles to concentrate on subjects that interested him. Welles performed and staged theatrical experiments and productions there.\n\nOn December 28, 1930, when Welles was 15, his father died at the age of 58, alone in a hotel in Chicago. His will left it to Orson to name his guardian. When Roger Hill declined, Welles chose Maurice Bernstein, a Chicago physician who had been a friend to his parents.\n\nFollowing graduation from Todd in May 1931, Welles was awarded a scholarship to Harvard University. Rather than enrolling, he chose travel. Later, he studied for a time at the Art Institute of Chicago. He returned a number of times to Woodstock to direct his alma mater's student productions.\n\nPersonal life\n\nRelationships and family\n\nOrson Welles and Chicago-born actress and socialite Virginia Nicolson (1916–1996) were married November 14, 1934. The couple divorced February 1, 1940.\n\nWelles fell in love with Mexican actress Dolores del Río, ten years his senior, with whom he was involved between 1938 and 1942. They acted together in the movie Journey into Fear (1943) but the affair ended soon after filming ended. Rebecca Welles, the daughter of Welles and Hayworth, met Del Rio in 1954 and said, \"My father considered her the great love of his life … She was a living legend in the history of my family\".\n\nWelles married Rita Hayworth in 1943. The couple became estranged by 1946 – Welles blamed Hayworth for making unfounded accusations of infidelity, and after he was turned out of the marital bed he then actually started to have affairs, which in turn prompted Hayworth to have affairs of her own. They briefly reconciled in 1947 during the making of The Lady from Shanghai, before finally separating. In 1948 Hayworth filed for divorce, her reason to the press being, \"I can't take his genius any more.\" During his last interview and only five hours before his death, Welles answered Merv Griffin's suggestive comment \"But one of your wives—oh, I have envied you so many years for Rita Hayworth\", by calling her \"one of the dearest and sweetest women that ever lived\" and saying that he was \"lucky enough to have been with her longer than any of the other men in her life.\"\n\nIn 1955, Welles married actress Paola Mori (née Countess Paola di Girifalco), an Italian aristocrat who starred as Raina Arkadin in his 1955 film, Mr. Arkadin. The couple had embarked on a passionate affair, and after she became pregnant they were married at her parents' insistence. They were wed in London May 8, 1955, and never divorced.\n\nCroatian-born actress Oja Kodar became Welles's longtime companion both personally and professionally from 1966 onwards, and they lived together for some of the last 19 years of his life. They first met in Zagreb in 1962, while Welles was filming The Trial, and embarked on a passionate, short-lived affair which ended when Paola Mori had a cancer scare and Welles returned to his wife. Kodar assumed Welles had left for good, and Welles hired a private detective to track down Kodar, to no avail. Three years passed, and Kodar was by then living in Paris and in a relationship with a struggling young actor. When they saw a press feature that Welles was in Paris, the young actor persuaded a reluctant Kodar to use her influence with Welles to get him a job. When she telephoned him, Welles immediately rushed to her hotel room, broke down the door, and pulled out a small metal box from his jacket. It contained a love letter to her. He had been carrying it every day for the last three years, in case he might meet her again one day.\n\nWith the passing years, Welles's domestic arrangements became more complicated. From 1966 he always maintained at least two separate homes, one with Kodar, the other with Mori and their daughter Beatrice. In the 1960s and 1970s, he shared houses just outside Paris and Madrid with Kodar. Although British tabloids reported his affair with Kodar as early as 1969 (which was a factor in his moving permanently to the United States in 1970), both Mori and Beatrice remained oblivious as to Kodar's existence until 1984. Welles set up a home with Mori and Beatrice in the United States (first in Sedona, then in Las Vegas), ostensibly because the climate would be good for his asthma. But while they lived in Las Vegas, he spent most of his time in Los Angeles, where he openly shared a house with Kodar. When Mori found out about Kodar in 1984, she threw him out of their Las Vegas house, and she and Beatrice did not see him for the last year of his life, although they still talked regularly on the telephone.\n\nThis situation had serious ramifications for the copyright status of his work after his death. Welles left Kodar his Los Angeles home and the rights to his unfinished films, and turned the rest over to Mori. Mori contended that she should have been left everything, and a year after Welles's death, Mori and Kodar finally agreed on the settlement of his will. On the way to their meeting to sign the papers, however, Mori was killed in a car accident in August 1986. Mori's half of the estate was inherited by Beatrice, who refused to come to an arrangement with Kodar, who she blames for undermining her parents' marriage. Legal wranglings between the two have persisted for over 25 years, leading to complex ongoing legal battles over who owns his unfinished films.\n\nWelles had three daughters from his marriages: Christopher Welles Feder (born March 27, 1938, with Virginia Nicolson); Rebecca Welles Manning (December 17, 1944 – October 14, 2004, with Rita Hayworth); and Beatrice Welles (born November 13, 1955, with Paola Mori). His only known son, British director Michael Lindsay-Hogg (Sir Michael Lindsay-Hogg, 5th baronet, born May 5, 1940), is from Welles's affair with Irish actress Geraldine Fitzgerald, then the wife of Sir Edward Lindsay-Hogg, 4th baronet. Although Hogg knew Welles sporadically and occasionally worked as his assistant, and had long been rumoured to be his son given their strong physical resemblance, he refused to believe such rumours until he eventually took a paternity test in 2010. In her autobiography, In My Father's Shadow, Feder wrote about being a childhood friend and neighbor of Lindsay-Hogg's and always suspecting he might be her half-brother.\n\nAfter the death of Rebecca Welles Manning, a man named Marc McKerrow was revealed to be her biological son, and therefore the direct descendant of Orson Welles and Rita Hayworth. McKerrow's reactions to the revelation and his meeting with Oja Kodar are documented in the 2008 film Prodigal Sons. McKerrow died June 18, 2010.\n\nDespite an urban legend promoted by Welles himself, he was not related to Abraham Lincoln's wartime Secretary of the Navy, Gideon Welles. The myth dates back to 1944 when, bantering with Lucille Ball on The Orson Welles Almanac before an audience of U.S. Navy service members, Welles says, \"my great-granduncle was Gideon Welles, Secretary of the Navy in Lincoln's cabinet\". In a 1970 TV interview on The Dick Cavett Show, Welles refers to Gideon Welles as his great-grandfather. As presented by Charles Higham in a genealogical chart that introduces his 1985 biography of Welles, Orson Welles's father was Richard Head Welles, son of Richard Jones Welles (born Wells), son of Henry Hill Wells (who had an uncle named Gideon Wells), son of William Hill Wells, son of Richard Wells (1734–1801).\n\nWelles is related to Charles Head (1899–1951), first husband of costume designer Edith Head (1897–1981). They are direct descendants of Henry Head (1647–1716), who emigrated to America before 1683 and settled in Little Compton, Rhode Island.\n\nPhysical characteristics\n\nWelles reached a height of six feet at the age of 14. Peter Noble's biography describes him as \"a magnificent figure of a man, over six feet tall, handsome, with flashing eyes and a gloriously resonant speaking-voice\" According to a 1941 physical exam taken when he was 26, Welles was 6 feet (180 cm) tall and weighed 218 pounds (99 kg). His eyes were brown. Other sources cite that he was 6 feet 4 inches (193 cm) tall, but the slates from costume tests made during the 1940s show him as 6 feet 1 inch (185 cm). Welles gained a significant amount of weight in his 40s, eventually rendering him morbidly obese, at one point weighing nearly 400 pounds (180 kg). The weight gain may have caused him to appear slightly shorter than his actual height. His obesity was severe to the point that it restricted his ability to travel, aggravated other health conditions, including his asthma, and even required him to go on a diet in order to play the famously portly character Sir John Falstaff. Some have attributed his over-eating and drinking to depression over his marginalization by the Hollywood system.\n\nReligious beliefs\n\nIn April 1982, Merv Griffin interviewed Welles and asked about his religious beliefs. Welles replied, \"I try to be a Christian. I don't pray really, because I don't want to bore God.\"\n\nIn 1941, Welles sought the approval of church leaders including Bishop Fulton Sheen for a turn-of-the-century retelling of the life of Christ. He scouted locations in Baja California and Mexico with Perry Ferguson and Gregg Toland, and wrote a screenplay with dialogue from the Gospels of Mark, Matthew and Luke. \"Every word in the film was to be from the Bible — no original dialogue, but done as a sort of American primative,\" Welles said, \"set in the frontier country in the last century.\" The unrealized project was revisited by Welles in the 1950s when he wrote a second screenplay, to be filmed in Egypt. This film, too, was not made.\n\nHe narrated the Christian documentary The Late, Great Planet Earth as well as the 1961 Biblical film about the life of Christ, King of Kings.\n\nPolitics\n\nWelles was politically active from the beginning of his career. He remained aligned with the left throughout his life, and always defined his political orientation as \"progressive\". He was a strong supporter of Franklin D. Roosevelt and the New Deal, and often spoke out on radio in support of progressive politics. He campaigned heavily for Roosevelt in the 1944 election. For several years, he wrote a newspaper column on political issues and considered running for the U.S. Senate in 1946, representing his home state of Wisconsin (a seat that was ultimately won by Joseph McCarthy). In 1970, Welles narrated (but did not write) a satirical political record on the administration of President Richard Nixon titled The Begatting of the President. He was also an early and outspoken critic of American racism and the practice of segregation.\n\nIn the 2006 book, Whatever Happened to Orson Welles?, writer Joseph McBride made several controversial claims about Welles. Though Welles said otherwise during his lifetime, McBride claimed Welles left America in the late 1940s to escape McCarthyism and the Hollywood blacklist. McBride also claimed, in spite of the sexual content of Welles's contemporary work (F for Fake and the unfinished Other Side of the Wind which contained an explicit – for the time – sex scene involving Oja Kodar), that Welles was extremely puritanical about sex based on his comment to Peter Bogdanovich that The Last Picture Show was \"a dirty movie\".\n\nWelles once told Cahiers du cinéma about sex in film, \"In my opinion, there are two things that can absolutely not be carried to the screen: the realistic presentation of the sexual act and praying to God.\"\n\nDeath and funeral\n\nOn October 10, 1985, Welles appeared on his final interview on The Merv Griffin Show. He died five hours later of a heart attack at his home in the Hollywood area of Los Angeles, California. He was found on his bedroom floor, having worked into the early morning typing notes for a project at UCLA that was to begin shooting the next day. His death came on the same day as that of his Battle of Neretva co-star, Yul Brynner. He was cremated two days later.\n\nWelles's funeral was the subject of some disagreement among his family. It was handled by his widow Paola Mori, who had not seen him since she had thrown him out of their family home a year earlier, and his youngest daughter, Beatrice Welles. Mori would die the following year at age 57. On the pretext that \"Daddy left no money for funerals or anything else\", Beatrice planned for it to be \"a simple affair\", which intentionally excluded \"Hollywood types\". Welles's eldest daughter, Chris, has written of her horror at arriving in \"a slum\" district of downtown Los Angeles and finding that the funeral took place in a building that \"looked more like a hot sheets motel than a funeral home\", and that the funeral was booked in a small, bare, sparsely furnished shabby back room, which \"had the look of a cheap motel room\" and had no music or flowers. No ministers, speakers, or ceremony had been organized, and so the mourners sat in silence by Welles's cremated remains until his 90-year-old former teacher and mentor, Roger Hill, gave an impromptu eulogy. Paola Mori had refused to allow most of Welles's friends to attend, limiting the mourners to nine: herself, Welles's three daughters, Roger Hill, three of Welles's friends (Gary Graver, Prince Alessandro Tasca di Cuto, and Greg Garrison), and the doctor who had signed Welles's death certificate. Welles's companion for the last 20 years, Oja Kodar, was not invited, nor were his ex-wives. Regarding the proceedings, Hill exclaimed, at the funeral, \"This is awful! Awful!\" Hill took particular exception to Welles's having been cremated to save money, because \"Orson never wanted to be cremated. He hated the whole idea of cremation. Thank God he doesn't know what they did to him!\"\n\nWelles's cremated remains were taken to Ronda, Spain, where they were buried in an old well covered by flowers, within the rural property of a long-time friend, retired bullfighter Antonio Ordóñez.\n\n***"
