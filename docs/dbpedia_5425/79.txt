Biography

Richard was born in 1872, in St. Joseph, Missouri, to Richard and Mary Head Welles. He married Beatrice Ives in 1903, in Chicago. The couple had two sons including Orson Wells.

In an interview with Dick Cavett in 1970, Orson Wells spoke of his father:[1]

My father lived in Peking for quite a long time and I spent five or six years there.... and he stayed in Peking just because the living was easy there. He liked to live au prince - in a very grand way ... He was born with a lot of bread and cast it on the waters and it failed to return; the only way he could really live it up was in Peking where you could have 400 servants and give dinner parties with gold plate and have columns of ice with trees of orchids frozen into them. For a mere pittance - relatively speaking. And that's what brought us to Peking.

He died in Chicago, in 1930, at the age of 58. Several of his documents, in his older years, add the middle name Hodgdon, however, his birth certificate and his World War I Draft Registration card (written in his own hand) list only the middle name, his mother’s maiden name, Head.

Fact: Burial in Green Ridge Cemetery , Kenosha, Kenosha County, Wisconsin, USA
