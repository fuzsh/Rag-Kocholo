        "text": "Grouse Creek Solar Power Information & Peak Sun Hours\n\nSolar Green Energy Summary for Grouse Creek, Utah\n\nLattitude: 41.7094\n\nSunlight\n\nFixed Tilt Sunlight Hours: 6.9 hours per day\n\n1-Axis Tilt Sunlight Hours: 8.1 hours per day\n\n2-Axis Tilt Sunlight Hours: 8.7 hours per day\n\nPeak sun hours is arguably the most important number to consider before installing your solar panels. Unlike total sun hours, peak sun hours are calculated by looking at the amount of sunlight hours in a 24 hour period that is strong enough to be absorb by a solar panel. One way to imagine peak sun hours is to think about a solar powered calculator you owned in school. If you covered the solar panel with your finger, or tried to use the calculator in the dark, the calculator would not work. As you slowly exposed the calculator to light the calculator would eventually turn on and be usable. The same is true with peak sun hours; these are the hours that your solar panels receive enough sunlight to work. Looking at the average peak sunlight hours of 6.9 per day can help you determine the amount of solar panels you need to install to power your home or business in Grouse Creek, Utah.\n\nThe equator has a latitude of zero while Grouse Creek has a latitude of 41.7. Any city located on the equator will receive the most sunlight throughout the year because the sunlight arrives at a perpendicular 90 degree angle to the earth at the equator. The further you are from the equator the more your daily sunlight hours can vary.\n\nThere are a few ways to increase average peak sun hours per year for your solar power system. One way is to use a tracking mount solar panel instead of a fixed tilt solar panel. A 1-axis mount will track the sun throughout the sky from sunrise to sunset, giving your panel a more efficient facing direction towards the sun throughout the day. A 2-axis solar panel will track the sun in the sky throughout the day, but also change and follow the angle of the sun in the sky throughout the year. Both of these axis system solar panels will produce higher average peak sun hours than a fixed solar panel.\n\nClimate in your geographical region is a major factor that will influence average peak sun hours per year. If you live in a region that does not have a lot of completely sunny days, then cloud coverage will greatly influence solar insolation on any given day. Mountains and trees may also contribute to lower solar insolation if they block the sun from your panels at any given point of the day.\n\nWe can use previous years of data to estimate the amount of peak sun hours in Grouse Creek. A fixed tilt mount for example will receive 6.9 average hours per day. For more efficiency for your system in Grouse Creek you could use a 1-axis tracking mount and increase your daily peak sun average to 8.1 hours, or even further with a 2-axis panel to get an average of 8.7 hours.\n\nSolar Businesses in Grouse Creek, Utah\n\nBe the first to hear about the latest green energy news, technology and offers.\n\n[mc4wp_form id=\"2942\"]\n\nBy providing your email you consent to receiving occasional promotional emails & newsletters.\n\nNo Spam.
