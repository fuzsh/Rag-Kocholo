        "text": "2\n\nInnovation and Accommodation\n\nThe Legal Status of Women in Territorial Utah, 1850–1896\n\nLisa Madsen Pearson and Carol Cornwall Madsen\n\nThe story of the legal status of women in territorial Utah (1850–96) weaves together three historical strands: the expansion of women’s legal rights nationally, the liberalizing tendencies of frontier development, and most important, the necessity of protecting Mormon control and practices, including plural marriage, and ultimately defending them against the counter measures of the federal government. While influenced to varying degrees by the first two developments in American history, the third most clearly defined the focus of early Utah territorial law with respect to women.\n\nCreating territorial law to support Mormon ideology and practice, particularly by providing a legal identity for plural wives and their children within the framework of American jurisprudence, required innovative and imaginative measures by Utah lawmakers. Polygamy (the popular name) or polygny (the technically correct term for marriage between a man and multiple wives) was a basic tenet of Mormonism. By any name, it was a system of female enslavement, according to its critics and was designated an illegal practice after 1862 by federal decree. According to its defenders, it was a God-given commandment that should have been protected as a free exercise of religion by the U.S. Constitution. Paradoxically, this system forced a consciousness of women’s legal rights by Utah’s territorial legislature and put Utah in the vanguard of efforts to improve the legal status of women.\n\nSome of these innovative measures, however, were casualties of the escalating assertion of federal power, aimed at destroying polygamy and Mormon political hegemony in the territory. The process of accommodation that followed federal anti-polygamy legislation eventually led to the discontinuation of the practice by the Mormon Church and opened the way to statehood. It also removed any recognition of legal rights of plural wives; but in some other areas of the law, the legal advances experienced by Utah women survived the transition to statehood.\n\nTHE NATIONAL STRUGGLE FOR WOMAN’S RIGHTS\n\nIn the first half of the nineteenth century, women’s legal status was still defined in large measure by common law, a form of British jurisprudence transported to the American colonies. While some of its provisions were dropped in transit, the principle of “coverture” remained intact.1 Under the doctrine of coverture, upon marriage a woman’s “very being or legal existence [was] suspended during the marriage or at least incorporated or consolidated into that of the husband,” according to William Blackstone, the seventeenth-century compiler of the common law.2\n\nBecause under the law a husband and wife were considered one person (and that person was the husband), they could not testify for or against each other in court. Furthermore, married women were denied such civil rights as the right to sue or be sued in their own name or keep any judgment recovered on their behalf, to manage or control their real property, to own personal property, to keep their wages, or to make a contract or will. Nor could they act as independent legal guardians of their children.3\n\nIn exchange for the surrender of her legal identity and her property to her husband, the common law granted a married woman two rights: the right of support (to be fed, clothed, and sheltered) and the right of dower (a right to the income and use of one-third of the real estate that her husband owned during the marriage if she survived him). She received no protected interest in her husband’s personal property, including that which originally belonged to her. In practice, some of the harsh consequences of the common law were ameliorated by (1) prenuptial contracts which reserved property rights to the wife, often in lieu of her dower interest; (2) trust arrangements which gave a third-party trustee legal title to property to hold for the wife; (3) court settlements of the wife’s property on the husband only after some provision was made for the wife; and (4) the doctrine of feme sole where women widowed or abandoned by their husbands were given power to act as if they were single or where women who ran mercantile establishments were given power to act independently with respect to their businesses.4 Nevertheless, the consequences of coverture were far-reaching for the majority of women.\n\nThe common law thus reflected cultural assumptions about male and female relationships in society as well as in marriage. Women were under the control and protection of men, and the law recognized the husband as the sole legal representative of a family, particularly in the public realm. Blackstone acknowledged the disabilities which the wife lived under but claimed that they “were for the most part intended for her protection and benefit; so great a favourite is the female sex of the law.”5\n\nInstrumental in eroding the harsh effects of the common law on women was the rising importance of state and territorial legislatures. The common law was a collection of legal precedents, distilled and compiled in Blackstone’s Commentaries. Legislatures, however, created and formulated laws, sometimes paralleling and sometimes differing with common-law precedents. Women’s emergence from the common-law “legal fiction,” or legal construct, of marital unity began primarily with state legislation, notably the passage of Married Women Property Acts, beginning in 1835, which granted women the right to their own property.6 Initially, the rationale for the Married Women’s Property Acts was not economic equity or relief of women’s economic dependence. Rather, they reflected the “male response to such major economic dislocations as panics and depressions,” according to historian Joan Hoff. Land transfers and business transactions were also facilitated by these acts, which could help support the family economy by protecting married women’s assets from the husband’s creditors during periods of personal or general economic depression.7\n\nBut after these first acts were passed, women began to actively campaign for such reform in their own behalf. One consequence of these acts, according to some legal historians, lay in demonstrating the effectiveness of statutory revision on the state or territorial level as a major instrument of legal change for women. By 1865 twenty-nine states had property acts that modified, in varying degrees, the common-law doctrine of coverture.8 Throughout the rest of the nineteenth century, these acts would be amended and enlarged in varying degrees to include essential aspects of women’s economic independence. This relatively quiet feminist success in altering the law, which accompanied the economic rationale for change, provided impetus to the movement for greater political rights that followed the close of the Civil War.9\n\nTHE LIBERALIZING EFFECT OF THE WEST\n\nA further national trend that affected the development of Utah law for women was the protracted struggle for woman suffrage—most successful in the western United States. Political reform followed immediately on the heels of domestic legal reform, and the two soon became intertwined. Among the grievances listed in the “Declaration of Sentiments,” drawn up by Elizabeth Cady Stanton and presented to the first women’s rights convention held in Seneca Falls, New York, July 1848, was not only the lack of women’s legal identity but also denial of the vote.10 Political reform proved to be far more challenging, divisive, and controversial, however, than legal change, since it impinged even more directly on the dicta of coverture.\n\nFollowing the Civil War, the drive toward equal political rights began in earnest. The national campaign kept the issue before the national conscience and found its initial success in the West, where the expansiveness of its lands and resources matched the breadth of its attitudes and vision. While Congress debated the question of granting suffrage to the territories “as an experiment,” both Wyoming and Utah territories passed statutes enfranchising their women, Wyoming in 1869 and Utah in 1870. Both acts reenforced the ability of legislative means to effect legal change for women. Well before the 1920 passage of the Nineteenth Amendment granting all U.S. women the vote, thirteen western states had enfranchised their women. In addition to Wyoming, they were Colorado (1893), and Utah and Idaho (1896) at statehood. (See also chap. 11.)\n\nThis adventurous and entrepreneurial spirit of western settlers, along with the endless promises the West offered, conspired to soften the social and legal restrictions on women dominant in Eastern society. The initial absence of a formal judiciary allowed local justice to rule in many areas. Legal practices based on the common law were suspended or transformed as the natural and social characteristics of the various western territories dictated a unique application and development of the law. The scarcity of women, the interdependence so essential during the frontier period, the physical labor required to establish homes and communities that of necessity ignored traditional gendered divisions of labor, and the homesteading laws that allowed women to own and develop property in their own names, all contributed. Western women came to enjoy more legal rights, greater political power, and more employment opportunities much earlier than their Eastern counterparts. All of these factors were also appealing motivations for female migration.11\n\nTHE DEVELOPMENT OF UTAH LAW\n\nThough influenced by these national developments, Utah responded to an even stronger social force shaping the legal and political status of women in the territory. Settled by Mormon pioneers and populated largely by Mormons during the nineteenth century, Utah was an anomaly among the states and territories. Driven out of their former settlements in the East and Midwest, Mormons hoped to establish a spiritual kingdom of their own making in the pristine West. Their mission was to establish “the kingdom of God” on earth in preparation of the Second Coming of Jesus Christ under the direction of their prophet, at that time (1847), Brigham Young. He was their spiritual head but also their economic and political leader. His spiritual and secular leadership blurred the line between the temporal and the eternal. “We are trying to establish the Kingdom of God on the earth,” he declared, “to which really and properly everything that pertains to men [and women]—their feelings, their faith, their affections, their desires, and every act of their lives—belong, that they may be ruled by it spiritually and temporally.”12 With this overriding mission, the spiritual equality of men and women, a concept that underlay their theology, translated in many respects to various forms of social equality.13 While the prevailing notion of “separate spheres” for men and women constituted a type of ideal division of labor in Mormon Utah, the exigencies of their mission rendered the boundaries between the two extremely permeable. Even the parameters of what constituted the “public sphere” underwent considerable transformation in Mormon practice, as women assumed numerous economic, professional, and community responsibilities individually or as members of their local Relief Society. Establishing the territory of Utah did not fit the settlement pattern that prevailed elsewhere in the West, being founded on a religious rather than an entrepreneurial base.\n\nAdded to this distinguishing feature were the communal fervor of Mormons, the solidarity of their interests, their united commitment to the faith, and their shared distrust of the federal government that resulted from its failure to intervene when Mormons were forced repeatedly from their homes and communities before settling in Utah. From the beginning, all of these peculiarities made other Americans suspect Mormon loyalty to the government.\n\nBut nothing could match the opprobrium that followed the public announcement of the LDS Church’s practice of plural marriage in 1852. This religious practice formed the basis for an innovative departure from the common law to protect its adherents and, in many respects, aligned it with the national movement for women’s rights. The basis for law in Utah was established the day Brigham Young entered Salt Lake Valley in 1847. As that first exploratory pioneer company met together, Mormon Apostle Wilford Woodruff recorded that, among other principles Young announced, “the ten commandments and the Christian ethics were practically proclaimed to be in force.”14 The statutory form of these principles closely paralleled those of the Mormon ecclesiastical court system which the pioneers had used during their sojourn in Winter Quarters, Nebraska, on the trek to Utah. It was no great change to establish them in Utah.15\n\nThe first Legislative Assembly in Utah met in 1849 and sent a memorial to Congress to recognize the provisional “State of Deseret.” Congress rejected that first appeal and Utah became subject to a Congressional organic act giving it territorial status and providing its governing law two years later. Within the general framework of that law, the new territorial legislature adopted the enactments passed previously by the “State of Deseret.”16\n\nWhen the first federally appointed officials arrived in Utah, the conflict with the federal government began. “Their [Mormon] judicial economy,” Utah writer Edward Tullidge wrote, “was after the pattern of the New Testament rather than Blackstone. It was this that made the Mormon rule so obnoxious to the federal judges and Gentile [non-Mormon] lawyers.”17 Throughout the territorial period, that contest influenced the development of law in a variety of ways. Congress had the power to review and approve or disapprove laws as well as enact legislation for the territory,18 and federally appointed territorial judges interpreted and applied laws passed by the territorial legislature.19 Consequently, Utah jurisprudence often represented a compilation of unique legal expedients and innovations designed to sustain Mormon practices and doctrines carefully constructed to fit within federal guidelines.\n\nA primary point of conflict centered on the jurisdiction of the federal and local courts. The Mormon legislature granted unusual legal powers to county probate courts presided over by local officers. Besides conducting matters relating to estates, guardianship of minors, and divorces, the territorial legislature also granted probate courts jurisdiction over all civil and criminal cases and the drawing of jury lists. It created the locally filled offices of territorial marshal and territorial attorney with powers paralleling those of their federal counterparts. Later, the legislature extended their power by giving the probate courts the same original jurisdiction as the federally governed district courts.20 Many litigants, particularly Mormons, took their cases to the probate courts rather than before the federally appointed judge of the district court. The effect was to displace the federally appointed courts with a judiciary under local control. The probate courts thus provided an alternative legal system and allowed Mormons to appear in locally administered and thus more sympathetic courts.21 Moreover, the Mormon ecclesiastical court system entertained a wide variety of civil suits, thus offering a second locally governed legal avenue to church members. Concerned that the probate courts gave extensive judicial power to the LDS Church and, in effect, thwarted the prosecution of polygamists, Congress reacted by placing the judiciary firmly under federal control. The Poland Act of 1874 stripped the probate courts of all civil, criminal, and chancery (equity) jurisdiction and transferred to federal officials the duties of the territorial attorney general and marshal. It also gave federal judges wide latitude in the selection of jurors.22 Probate courts were restricted to matters of estates, guardianship, and divorce.\n\nA second point of discord was Utah Territory’s effort to reject the common law. In 1852 Brigham Young declared: “We have not adopted the common law of England, nor any other general law of old countries, any further than the extending over us the constitutional laws of the United States by Congress, has produced that effect.”23 This disclaimer took statutory form in 1853: “All questions of law, the meaning of writings other than laws, and the admissibility of testimony shall be decided by the Court: and no laws nor parts of laws shall be read, argued, cited or adopted in any court, during any trial, except those enacted by the Governor and Legislative Assembly of this Territory, and those passed by the Congress of the United States when applicable; and no report, decision or doings of any Court shall be read, argued, cited or adopted as precedent in any trial.”24\n\nIn 1874 the chief justice of the Utah Supreme Court, James McKean, expressed his incredulity at the legislative attempt to exclude from Utah the authority of Coke, Blackstone, Mansfield, Kent, Story and Marshall (authors of widely used treatises which compiled cases involving the common law in certain areas of the law). “What can be said?” he queried. “Language fails properly to characterize such legislation.”25 Despite the 1842 statute, the applicability of the common law was recognized in a variety of local court cases beginning in 1855. In 1889 the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the common law operated in Utah by virtue of the Organic Act, which declared in section 9 that the courts of the Territory possessed “chancery as well as common law jurisdiction.” It was also operative as a result of the territorial legislature’s enactment of a statute in 1852, which provided that all courts should have “law and equity jurisdiction.”26\n\nThe third and most persistent Mormon-federal conflict focused on polygamy.27 The need to provide legal protection for plural wives generated several legal advances for women. Congress responded with legislation to abolish the practice, however, beginning with the Morrill Act in 1862, followed by the Poland Act in 1874, the Edmunds Law in 1882, and the Edmunds-Tucker Law in 1887.28 The severity of the last, with even more crushing measures promised, led to an accommodation by LDS Church President Wilford Woodruff, who issued a manifesto in 1890 withdrawing public support for new plural marriages and advising members to abide by the laws of the land. The civil and criminal sanctions and disabilities imposed by these federal laws substantially altered the legal status of Utah’s women, especially plural wives and their children.29\n\nThese three social forces were instrumental in shaping Utah law in the nineteenth century and had long-range influence on how the law related to women. The national trend toward women’s rights along with the more innovative attitude of western lawmakers is clearly discernible in the development of domestic law in Utah during this period. But the impact of the struggle to assert a Constitutional right against escalating federal intervention had a far more perceptible and pervasive effect than the first two. Utah’s bumpy ride to statehood left its innovative measures far behind as it accommodated itself to the expectations of becoming the forty-third state in the Union.\n\nMARRIAGE AND DIVORCE LAWS\n\nThe lack of legislation regulating marriage and Utah’s lenient divorce law (1852), provoked major political and legal controversy and clearly demonstrated the influence of Mormon beliefs on the formulation of Utah law. The first territorial legislature in 1852 authorized officers of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- day Saints “to solemnize marriage” and required that “a registry of marriages” be kept in every branch or stake [ecclesiastical units] of the church.30 For Mormons, marriage was a religious covenant properly solemnized only by ecclesiastical authority and enduring beyond the deaths of the partners. Therefore, the legislature made no provision for the civil recording of marriages nor did it pass any other regulatory measures. As a result, the only documentation of the numerous marriages civilly or ecclesiastically during most of Utah’s territorial period appears in the personal records of judges and justices of the peace, church records, diaries and journals, and temple sealing [marriage] records.31 Federally appointed governors exhorted the legislatures in 1872, 1874, 1876, and 1878 to pass statutory provisions regulating marriage, but none was adopted until 1887.32\n\nThe Mormon-dominated territorial legislature did not enact a civil marriage law, not only because of the Mormon concept that only LDS marital rites were binding, but also because of the need to avoid public records of plural marriages, especially after passage of the Morrill Act (1862), criminalizing bigamy. The force of this act stemmed from Congress’s power to regulate marriage in the territories as legislatures did in the states.33 It had no provisions for enforcement, however. Not until passage of the far more stringent anti-polygamy Edmunds-Tucker Act in 1887, which provided for the certification of marriages, did the territorial legislature enact a parallel marriage statute outlawing polygamy and requiring the registration of all marriages, including the names of the parties, and the officiator, to be filed with the probate court.34\n\nIn contrast to its failure to enact a marriage law, the first legislative assembly in 1852 established a liberal divorce law, which, paradoxically, appeared to permit the easy dissolution of marriage by a religious community committed to the sanctity and eternity of marriage.35 The Utah law allowed anyone who was or “wished to become” a resident of Utah to invoke the jurisdiction of the court. This act was influenced both by Utah’s location in the West and by a basic premise of Mormon theology. During this period, the Western population was rapidly increasing with migrants, especially in Utah. Moreover, the amount of mobility between the western territories begged the question of what constituted residency. With the constant influx of new settlers and frequent change of domicile, a long period of residency was impractical for many reasons and often worked hardship for new westerners seeking legal separation from spouses unwilling to join them.36\n\nThe traditional grounds for divorce were impotency, adultery, desertion, habitual drunkenness, felony conviction, and abusive treatment. Significantly, the Utah statute added a seventh cause: “when it shall be made to appear to the satisfaction and conviction of the court, that the parties cannot live in peace and union together and that their welfare requires a separation.”37 Only six other states and territories had a similar law.38 The circumstances giving rise to these lenient statutes, however, differed in each jurisdiction and particularly in Utah.\n\nUtah’s divorce statute gave legal force to a social and religious principle that governed divorce in LDS Church courts. Mormons valued social unity and harmony, qualities that family life was meant to exemplify and foster. Divorce provided a way to remove a source of social contention and permitted the innocent party to remarry and ideally create a more harmonious and peaceful family relationship.39 Thus, divorce for Mormons did not “destroy” home and family but was in reality a safety valve, a means of preserving the institution of the family by dissolving those alliances that abused its peace and harmony.\n\nMoreover, since civil marriage ceremonies were neither eternally binding nor valid in the eyes of the church, divorce was merely a rhetorical exercise in compliance with the demands of a temporal legal system. Marriage was a religious covenant, its eternal duration entirely dependent on the faith and commitment of the marital partners. Spiritually, it would have no force if either partner disregarded the covenants he or she had made. As early as 1842, according to diarist John D. Lee, Mormon prophet Joseph Smith declared that couples “were married to each other only by their own covenants, and if their marriage relations had not been productive of blessings and peace, and they felt it oppressive to remain together, they were at liberty to make their own choice, much as if they had not been married. ... It was a sin for people to live together and raise and beget children in alienation from each other.”40\n\nIn 1861 Brigham Young acknowledged the desire of couples to have tangible evidence of their separation. In a ruling that clearly favored women, he announced: “When a woman becomes alienated in her feelings and affections from her husband, it is then his duty to give her a bill [of divorcement] and set her free.” In other words, to live together without natural affection from whatever cause was a violation of the marriage covenant. Moreover, if a man proved to be an “unworthy” husband and father, according to Young, he automatically forfeited his marriage covenants, and his wife or wives were “free from him without a bill of divorcement.”41 Young issued divorce certificates only reluctantly, complaining, “You might as well ask me for a piece of blank paper.” He charged husbands whose wives requested a divorce ten dollars, not for his services, he said, but for their “foolishness.”42 In Mormon terms, marriage ideally endured only on the basis of mutual affection and righteous behavior and was automatically dissolved when either partner failed to meet his or her religious commitments. This position had, needless to say, numerous practical problems—hence the development of written certificates of divorce.\n\nMore than two thousand extant bills of divorce, granted by Brigham Young and his successor, John Taylor, provide evidence that women, particularly those in plural marriages, were not bound in relationships that proved undesirable, contrary to the assertions of anti-polygamists. Though the records do not indicate, it can be assumed that most of the applicants were plural wives dissolving their marriages through ecclesiastical courts.43 This easy access to divorce, either through probate or ecclesiastical courts, coupled with the liberal attitude toward the dissolution of unharmonious marriages, stood in marked contrast to the conservative views of marriage and divorce that dominated American society in the nineteenth century.44 In fact, for some Mormon critics, it was as undesirable as polygamy. While divorce has never been treated as a desirable social institution in American life, it was the only remedy for women legally bound to dissolute, abusive, and irresponsible husbands. And for disillusioned plural wives, it offered ready escape. A Deseret News article explained: “Polygamy would be considered a system of bondage, if women desiring to sever their relations with a husband having other wives, were refused the liberty they might demand.”45\n\nDespite this apparent permissiveness toward divorce, Brigham Young and other church leaders consistently advised against it, admonishing couples to overlook personality flaws and other personal irritations. Nevertheless, while urging husbands to be more patient and long-suffering, Young seldom refused a woman who expressed dissatisfaction with her husband. A letter to Frederick Kesler explains Young’s position. “Your wife Abigail called upon me, stated her feelings and requested a bill [of divorce], which under the circumstances we thought proper to grant her, as is usual when a woman insists upon one.” He also made other statements expressing this preferential status of wives in divorce actions: “When women tease for a divorce, and are determined to have one what can be done better than to give them one?” Or “I should feel a little ashamed to require a wife to ask me twice for a bill of divorce, or to refuse signing and paying for it at once.” Or “If the brethren were but a small part as anxious, diligent and prompt in this particular [acceding to divorce] as they are in having women sealed to them, it would prevent much needless annoyance and perplexity to the sisters.” Grievances ranged from “an abusive tongue” to desertion.46\n\nChurch divorces for first wives were not accepted by the civil courts as legal, nor could plural wives appeal to the civil courts for the termination of their marriages. Since Mormon bishops presided over many of the county probate courts, the jurisdiction of the bishops’ ecclesiastical courts and the civil probate courts was sometimes invoked incorrectly. First wives occasionally obtained divorces in church courts, and some plural wives received divorces in probate courts, causing them later legal difficulties.47 A noted jurisdictional dispute involved John R. Park, first president of the University of Utah and first state superintendent of public instruction. Park married Annie F. Armitage in 1872 on her supposed deathbed in a church marriage, which was considered legal at that time; but when she unexpectedly recovered, the couple, evidently changing their minds, decided to obtain a church divorce, which was not legally recognized. While Park never remarried, Armitage, on the basis of her church divorce, married William Hilton in 1875 and gave birth to ten children. At Park’s demise in 1900, Armitage successfully sued for a dower interest in Park’s property, claiming her right as his widow, since she had been his only wife and since their church divorce was not recognized by the court.48 Legal readjustment of such marital relationships continued well into the twentieth century.\n\nAn unforeseen result of Utah’s lenient divorce statute occurred after the completion of the transcontinental railroad in 1869. Eastern lawyers used the liberal residency and grounds provisions to obtain quick and easy divorces for their clients. In the eight years between 1869 and 1877, Utah’s civil divorces increased from 75 in one year to as many as 914 in 1877, while the general population had slightly less than doubled. Nearly all of these divorces were initiated by nonresidents.49\n\nThe federally appointed governor, George W. Emery, strongly urged the legislature to amend the divorce laws in 1876; but the legislature did not act until after a grand jury investigation in 1877 and another appeal by Emery in 1878.50 Divorces dropped to 122 that year. Although Mormon ecclesiastical courts continued to grant divorce for incompatibility, civil law could no longer embrace a religious concept too liberal for prevailing social norms and policies. Once again Mormon theology and practice met and were forced to yield to federal authority. Mormon legal theory, however, continued to focus on the quality of the marital relationship rather than the institution of marriage itself, putting Utah on the liberal side of this nationally debated social issue.51 Though even more controversial than woman suffrage, liberalizing divorce laws was on the agenda of many social activists of this time.52\n\nCUSTODY AND GUARDIANSHIP\n\nThe common-law approach to guardianship vested custody and guardianship rights exclusively in fathers. Children were considered dependents entitled to support but were also essentially the property of their fathers, who were entitled to their children’s services and wages.53 Early Utah territorial law likewise affirmed that the father was the guardian of his minor children during their lifetimes and had the power to appoint another guardian upon his death. Thus, mothers became guardians only if their husbands became incapacitated, appointed them guardians, or died without appointing another guardian.54 In the case of divorce, common law also awarded custody to the father.55\n\nThe first law in Utah, however, recognized that women could be awarded custody of children when the legislature granted probate courts authority to make provision for maintaining the wife and children who were placed in her custody. The law further allowed for the divorcing parties to mutually agree on the disposition of the children; children age ten or older could designate their choice of custodial parent.56\n\nIf a minor child owned property that did not derive from either parent, the courts were empowered to appoint a guardian to manage the property. No express preference was statutorily conferred upon fathers. Rather, the law provided that either the mother or father (or other adult) could be appointed and that children over fourteen could select the guardian.57\n\nUtah law was consistent with early attempts in other jurisdictions nationally to accord greater custody rights to women. These changes were influenced in part by the reform efforts of women’s rights advocates. The 1848 Seneca Falls “Declaration of Sentiments” described the male-authored laws of custody and guardianship as being in total disregard of the “happiness of women” and kept these issues at the forefront of the women’s rights campaign. Nineteenth-century ideology assigned the proper sphere of women to the home and defined their primary role as motherhood, a view that contributed in some instances to the judicial acceptance of expanded legal rights for women within the home. Finally, the emergence of the role of the courts as arbiters and protectors of the “best interests of the child” led to an erosion of the paternal custody rights and an increase in maternal ones. The power shifted away from husbands and fathers, not directly to women, however, but to the state. While the law did begin to recognize women’s legal capacity for custody and guardianship, the ability to enjoy those rights still depended on a discretionary determination by a male-dominated judicial system.58\n\nUtah’s unique family situation—where one man fathered many children with multiple wives—however, clearly necessitated some circumvention of the common-law decree on guardianship. When Isaiah Cox of St. George moved to Mexico to escape federal prosecution, his plural wife, Martha Cragun Cox, became, in effect, the primary guardian of her children. She taught school to provide for them, while her young sons assisted by carrying the mail. Their wages became Martha’s to control.59 Without paternal influence, sometimes for years at a time, plural wives were thrust into decision-making roles regarding their children. In some cases, plural wives’ situations were tantamount to divorce since they lived apart from their husbands throughout their married lives, often in separate cities, and frequently received little or no maintenance from them. They were in fact, if not in law, the primary guardians of their children. Moreover, a plural wife would sometimes give one of her children to a childless sister-wife to rear, a decision between the women rather than by the father. The reality of life in Mormon society obviated the rule of common law and its assumptions about parent-child relationships.\n\nPROPERTY RIGHTS: CONTROL OF REAL ESTATE AND WILLS\n\nWhen the Mormon pioneers first arrived in the Salt Lake Valley, they surveyed the area and divided it into lots, which were distributed at a drawing. Forty-one women were allocated lots in that initial distribution. Some were single, some were widowed, some were plural wives, and some were married but were considered “heads of households” because their husbands were away with the Mormon Battalion, then on its way to California, or serving church missions.60\n\nFederal land laws successfully sought to encourage female migration to the West by allowing women land ownership rights beginning with the Oregon Donation Act of 1850.61 Passage of the federal Homestead Act of 1862 entitled the “head of a family” to obtain title to 160 acres by living on the land for five years and improving it. If the original settler died, his widow or his or her heirs could continue in possession and make the claim.62 The Townsite Act of 1867 gave city dwellers the means to obtain title to property within the boundaries of cities and towns by filing and establishing their right to it.63 Not until 1868 were federal land laws extended to Utah, with a federal land office following the next year.\n\nThe combined property laws had a unique effect in practice in Utah. While married women generally were not able to make claims under the Homestead or Townsite Acts, because most of them were not “heads of families” or the primary “occupant,” married women who were de facto heads of families or the main adult occupant apparently made such claims successfully, giving them legal control of the property. For example, Orson Pratt and his first wife, Sarah Marinda Bates Pratt, occupied a lot in Salt Lake City for some time prior to 1861 and made improvements on it. They moved to St. George and Brigham Young took possession. Sarah returned in the winter of 1867–68, and Young relinquished possession. She resided on the property with her children, with little or no aid from her husband and with no agreement, express or implied, to pay rent to Young. When the time came to file claims under the Townsite Act, both she and Young sought title. The court held that, though she was married, as head of the household and actual occupant of the land, Sarah Pratt was entitled to the deed.64\n\nThe property claims of plural wives did not go unchallenged, however. In 1879, the acting secretary of the Interior Department denied a plural wife’s homestead claim. His decision asserted that plural wives were, to all intents and purposes, subject to the control and governance of their husbands. If all plural wives made claims under the homestead laws, he asserted, a husband could gain control of multiple tracts. His ruling apparently gave no weight to the 1872 passage in Utah of the Married Person’s Property Act giving women control of their own property, nor did it recognize that many plural wives were independent heads of households. That the practice was extensive enough to elicit notoriety is suggested by a critical article by Schuyler Colfax published in the Chicago Advance, December 22, 1881: “Nor should these surplus wives be allowed to claim land as the ‘head of a family’ to help enrich their husbands,—a right denied to legal wives anywhere. ... Such a practice holds out a premium in power and in possession to polygamy as against law abiding citizens.”65 Though Utah’s property laws mirrored those elsewhere, in Utah they carried implications beyond their original intent.\n\nOnce “legal” ownership of land was possible, the same social imperative which led to the passage of married women’s property acts in other jurisdictions motivated passage of “An Act Concerning the Property Rights of Married Persons” by the Utah legislature in 1872.66 The law provided “that all property owned by either spouse before marriage, and that acquired afterwards by gift, bequest, devise or descent with the rents, issues and profits thereof, is that separate property of that spouse by whom the same is owned or acquired and separate property owned and acquired as specified above may be held, managed, controlled, transferred and in any manner disposed of by the spouse so owning or acquiring it, without any limitation or restriction by reason of marriage.”67\n\nThis statute, similar to married women’s property acts in other states, represented a departure from the common law by allowing married women to keep their personal property and to control their real property. It took another quarter century before all states recognized married women’s right to their property.\n\nBut there was still resistance. Conservative legislators in several states interpreted married women’s property acts as undermining the institution of marriage and the concept of marital unity. Some of the earliest acts entitled women to hold their own property but not to use it by conveying it in any way. Such provisions, they assumed, would assist husbands acting on behalf of or together with their wives.68 During the 1895 convention to draft the constitution for the state of Utah, the debate on this issue demonstrated ambiguity in defining the act’s intent as well as its extent. Delegate Charles S. Varian, representing one point of view, proclaimed himself “in favor ... of incorporating in this Constitution a recognition of the community system ... which enables the wife to participate equally with the husband in all the earnings and accretions derived by either of them during the marriage.”69 Under the community property system, developed in states and territories of Spanish heritage, each spouse retained ownership of his or her property owned before marriage. All money and property acquired during the marriage was jointly owned, although the husband enjoyed the right of sole management and control. Upon the husband’s death or divorce, the wife received one-half interest. It thus went beyond the provisions of the Utah Married Person’s Property Act by giving women joint ownership of property acquired by either marital partner. This measure was too liberal for the delegates, who rejected it.\n\nOn the other end of the spectrum was Representative William Howard, described by a colleague as “a man too much married [who] wished to take away some of the liberties of women.” He proposed that the constitution provide that a woman could sell, devise or mortgage her separate property but that “such sale, or alienation ... shall not be valid, without the signature of her husband to the same.” That amendment met only laughter and failed for lack of a second. The delegates were clearly no longer bound to the principle of coverture. The final draft of Utah’s constitution gave women rights over their separate property but stopped short of including control over marital property or earnings.\n\nThe Married Person’s Property Act of 1872, which allowed women to “transfer” or “dispose of” their own property “in any manner,” seemed to include the power to dispose of property by will.70 In an atypical response to the “liberating” features of the Married Person’s Property Act, the legislature passed an act in 1876 providing that a married woman could not dispose of her property by will without her husband’s consent.71 Its intent may have been to protect a husband’s interest in the property of his wife, especially if he were a polygamist. Governor George W. Emery did not sign the bill because he found it inconsistent with both the Married Person’s Property Act and with national progress in this area. The legislature reconsidered and within months passed a law that allowed a married woman to dispose of her separate estate by will.72 While Utah was already progressive in passing a Married Person’s Property Act, this extension of its provisions reflected national goals in women’s legal rights.\n\nWomen’s right to control their property by will not only effectively challenged the underlying premise of coverture but contributed to the growing legal independence of women as well as to their individual wealth. As more states adopted Married Women’s Property Laws, women’s financial holdings grew proportionately throughout the century.73 Women’s wills thus provide some measurement of the extent of their individual wealth and the control they exercised over it. In Utah, for example, plural wife Elizabeth Hoagland Cannon used this newly clarified legal right by willing all her property to her husband but requested that he use it to rear and educate her children and that upon his death he assign her property or the equivalent to her children and heirs so that, in her words, “said children and heirs may stand upon the same footing as my said beloved husband’s other children and heirs and not suffer any loss because I have bequeathed to him ... all the property, real and personal, which I possess.”74 This property included an inheritance from her father and gifts from her husband, including stock in ZCMI (a church-owned cooperative retail store in Salt Lake City), the Deseret National Bank, the Provo Woolen Factory, Salt Lake City Railroad Company, and some real estate.\n\nLike Elizabeth Cannon, Eudora Shaugnessey, in 1889, bequeathed her property to her husband in trust for the support, maintenance, and education of her children, and provided that each child was to receive his or her share of the estate when reaching the age of majority.75 In 1894, Jane McKay Smith executed a will which appointed two of her children as trustees and directed them to sell one parcel of her property and to use the proceeds to build a house on another lot for the use of her husband and unmarried children, the husband to have the use and benefit of the house (including the right to lease it) for his lifetime. The property then passed to her daughter.76 These women had extensive land and stock holdings whereas many other women had only small sums of money and a few personal effects to bequeath.\n\nRather than to their children, some women chose to leave their small inheritances to friends, their church, or to charities. Sophie Ramzell’s will in 1876 bequeathed to “her sisters in the faith,” Margaret Blyth, $100; Olivia Rosengreen, $100 and her “steam box”; Maria Lagergran, $100 and her “black worsted dress”; Julie Sophie Weinerholm, $100; Sarah P. Heywood, her “black silk dress,” all as “tokens of remembrance.” In addition, she bequeathed $200 to the Trustee-in-Trust of the Church for the temple in St. George, $200 for the temple in Salt Lake City, and all the rest, including land, buildings, notes, mortgages or furniture, to George Q. Cannon, a member of the LDS First Presidency.77 In 1881, Sarah Cunningham willed to her niece all her wearing apparel and keepsakes, to the Female Relief Society her house and lot, “to assist the poor,” and the rest to her bishop to “dispose of as proper.”78 Lydia Blinde’s will of 1890 left what appeared to be all her household property to Emma Elizabeth Wilson: one “feather bed weight,” three quilts, three comforters, four pillows, a cookstove, furniture, one side board, one eight-day clock, one carpet, one leaf table, a sewing machine, pictures, household furniture and dishes, books, clothes, and garden tools.79\n\nHowever small the bequest, women clearly enjoyed designating the beneficiaries of their own property, a legal development that also provided historical insight into women’s individual wealth, their personal and household possessions, and their relationship to family, friends, and community. Women’s right to control their own property became a necessary corollary to the growing economic independence of women nationally throughout the nineteenth century and reflected not only changing economic realities but social attitudes as well.\n\nRIGHT TO SUE OR BE SUED\n\nThe Utah Married Person’s Property Act also allowed married women to sue or be sued in their own names.80 However, the 1884 Code of Civil Procedure required that a married woman’s husband be joined in suit except “when the action concerns her separate property or her right or claim to the homestead property, ... when the action is between herself and her husband, ... or when she is living separate and apart from her husband by reason of his desertion of her, or by agreement in writing entered into between them.”81\n\nHusbands and wives did in fact bring suit together in cases which concerned only the wife. In Oliphant v. Fox, Mrs. Oliphant, who had recently married Mr. Oliphant, sued her former husband, Mr. Fox, to modify the divorce action which gave Fox custody of some of the children. In fact, all the children had chosen to live with Mr. and Mrs. Oliphant, and the Oliphants sued for more support.82 This was but one of a number of cases in which husband and wives sued together to recover for injuries sustained by the wife.83\n\nA few territorial statutes gave women specific rights in certain classes of cases. For example, one territorial statute granted a married woman the right to “institute and maintain, in her own name, a suit [on a bond posted by persons licensed to manufacture, dispense, or sell liquor] for all damages sustained by herself and children, or either, on account of the [liquor] traffic, and the money when collected, [was to] be paid over for the use of herself and children, or either.”84 Wrongful death actions for the loss of a child could be brought only by the father, however, unless he had died or deserted the family.85 In either of those cases, the mother could sue for the seduction of a minor daughter, and an unmarried woman could sue her seducer in her own behalf.86\n\nIn the right to sue or be sued, Utah law cases resembled those in other states with Married Women’s Property Acts. Through a series of amendments to the basic property acts, married women gradually acquired a legal identity independent of their husbands and important to their concurrent claims to independent political representation.\n\nINHERITANCE LAWS\n\nThroughout the territorial period, the inheritance rights of wives, especially plural wives, had a stormy history under inheritance laws. A review of local court proceedings shows that many estates went to the widow and minor heirs by virtue of statutes which reserved homestead and personal property for their benefit. An 1852 law provided that the homestead (the home occupied by the family) was to be set apart for their benefit despite will provisions to the contrary or creditors’ claims (both during life and upon death). The homestead exemption laws (not to be confused with the federal homestead legislation which regulated grants of public land to those who lived on and improved it for a specified period of time) were a unique American legislative innovation of the early nineteenth century. Like the bankruptcy laws of the same period and the later Married Women’s Property Acts, these laws were aimed at preserving family financial stability by insulating the basic properties that a family needed to survive from imprudent financial actions by the head of the family.87\n\nInitially, no specific dollar amount of the real estate was designated, but the law did outline specific items of personal property to be reserved for the use of the head of the household, or upon his death for the widow and children such as clothing, furniture, tools of trade, livestock, household effects, farm implements, and sewing machines.88 Later enactments allowed the court to award the family additional funds from the estate, but provided that, if the widow had a sufficient, independent maintenance, the homestead would go to the minor children.89 Under the 1852 law, the widow had only a life interest in the use of the property, her share passing to the children on her death.90 In 1888 the law was amended to give the widow absolute ownership of all the homestead property if there were no children or one half the property if there were.91\n\nIn the early territorial period, these provisions were applied to both the legal and plural wives; and the whole estate was often set aside for their use as a result. The welfare of plural wives and their children had prompted the passage of these provisions. For example, when William Nixon died intestate, the court ordered that a house then under construction be completed and set aside as the homestead for two of the wives to occupy and that a third wife be given a homestead interest in the house she occupied. In addition, the court awarded amounts for the support and maintenance of all the wives and their children.92 At J. M. Woolley’s death, his estate was divided, giving one wife, Maria, and her six children the homestead on which she resided, worth $3,000, and additional property including cows, stoves, buffalo robe, dishes, beds, linens, all worth an additional $1,000, and $500 in additional personal property. Another wife, Anna Woolley, who apparently had no children, did not have a home or the necessary furnishings for housekeeping. The administrators were ordered to purchase a cooking stove and other essential furniture for her and to provide for her support and maintenance.93\n\nIn later enactments, the homestead was limited to a specific value ($1,000 which was later raised to $1,500) plus additional support for the wife and each child.94 Where property remained in the estate after the homestead allowance was awarded and there was no will, the laws of intestacy determined the distribution of the balance of the estate. Possibly in recognition of the legal challenge posed by multiple wives, in 1852 the territorial legislature enacted a somewhat ambiguous law providing for the estate of a husband who died intestate:\n\nIf there be other property remaining after the liabilities of the estate are liquidated, then it shall, in the absence of other arrangements by will, descend in equal shares to his children or their heirs; one share to such heirs through the mother of such children, if she shall survive him, during the natural life, or during her widowhood; or if he has had more than one wife who either died or survived in lawful wedlock, it shall be equally divided between the living and the heirs of those who are dead, such heirs taking by right of representation.95\n\nUnder this law a monogamous wife shared equally with her children. In Cain Heirs v. Young, the court held that the widow took “a child’s part during her life or widowhood” which then descended to the children. In that case there were two children who each took a one-third interest immediately and one-half reversionary interest in the widow’s one-third interest.96 It is not clear whether the statute meant to cover cases where the decedent had more than one wife simultaneously, as in polygamy, or simply consecutively. Nor does the term “survived in lawful wedlock” necessarily specify the first wife, rather than the plural wife, since the Morrill Act outlawing such marriages had not yet been enacted. Nevertheless, no territorial court cases appear to have granted plural wives property under this statute.\n\nBoth church courts and individual informal arrangements, however, attempted to equalize the claims of all surviving wives and children, as in the case of Mary Ann Maughan of Cache Valley, the first of Peter Maughan’s plural wives. When her husband died intestate, she selected local leaders to handle the settlement. She was not entirely happy with the decision, however: “January 1872. I chose G. L. Farrell and Francis Gunnell to assist in settling the estate. The Brethren thought it best for all to share alike, so [plural wife] Lissy’s little boy 2 ½ years was awarded just as much as I was.”97\n\nA separate provision of the 1852 law, however, allowed “illegitimate children and their mothers” to inherit from the father, whether acknowledged by him or not, if it could be demonstrated that he was the father.98 Cases later in the territorial period suggest that the probate courts elected to include plural families under this provision, so worded as to pass Congressional scrutiny while covering the justifiable if illegal claims of plural families.\n\nIn 1872, ten years after passage of the Morrill Act, a plural wife’s right to inherit under the second provision of the 1852 statute was challenged. In the case of Chapman v. Handley, the probate court had denied any distribution from the estate of George Handley to his second wife, Sarah Chapman, and her children, ruling that the Utah statute was nullified by the Morrill Act, which made bigamy a crime and invalidated all laws which “establish, support, maintain, shield or countenance polygamy.”99 The Utah Supreme Court agreed, and plural wives and their children were left unprovided for by intestacy laws. They became dependent on the largesse of the first or legal wife or the willingness of all parties to allow ecclesiastical leaders to distribute the property. Like other cases where first wives were unwilling to share their inheritance, the plural wives of Francis Gunnell experienced economic hardship when the husband died intestate. Gunnell’s plural wife Emma “wept uncontrollably for now she would have to stay in a little one-room cabin with her five children,” according to a granddaughter. “She and Jane [another plural wife] were left nothing, not being recognized by law as a wife. Everything was left to the first living wife, Esther, except some property which was divided among the children.”100 To avoid this situation, Anne Leischman, aware of the precarious financial position that her father’s second wife would face at his death, urged him to make a will. “My mother would come in all right if he dies for a home and things,” she explained, “but Aunt Betsy would only be treated as a child. ... She can’t write a check, she can’t sign a deed, she can’t do anything.”101\n\nIn 1876 Governor Emery urged the legislature to require that the father acknowledge illegitimate heirs before they inherit to avoid the possibility of fraudulent claims.102 The legislature added the suggested provision to the statute while reluctantly removing any inheritance rights of mothers of illegitimate children. One year after the Chapman v. Handley decision, the issue of the inheritance rights of children of polygamous unions was again raised in Cope v. Cope, a case that went all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court. Four years after the Edmunds-Tucker Act reinforced anti-polygamy measures and one year after LDS Church President Wilford Woodruff issued his manifesto suspending the authorized performance of new plural marriages, the Supreme Court ruled that the legislature was free to provide for illegitimate children to inherit from their mother, father or both since it was “unjust to visit the sins of the parents on the heads of the children.”103 The Court disagreed with the determination of the Utah Supreme Court that the Morrill Act, which invalidated laws that supported polygamy, applied to this statute which provided inheritance rights for offspring of polygamous unions. The Court noted that subsequent federal anti-polygamy legislation had been particularly solicitous of the rights of children of polygamy, specifically legitimating any such offspring born before 1883104 and expressly disallowing inheritance rights only of illegitimate children born twelve months after passage of the Edmunds-Tucker Act in 1887. This act provided that\n\nthe laws enacted by the legislative assembly of the Territory of Utah which provide for or recognize the capacity of illegitimate children to inherit, or to be entitled to any distributive share in the estate of the father of any such illegitimate child, are hereby disapproved and annulled; and no illegitimate child shall hereafter be entitled to inherit from his or her father, or to receive any distribute share in the estate of his or her father: Provided, That this section shall not apply to any illegitimate child born within twelve months after the passage of this act, nor to any child made legitimate by the seventh section of the [Edmunds] act.105\n\nDespite the legislature’s initial attempt to provide legal protection for plural wives, these later legislative and judicial decisions annulled their efforts. Intestate husbands thus left their plural wives in straitened economic circumstances. The only legal safeguard for plural wives was a will.\n\nOccasionally some husbands designated their wives as guardians of their property but often only until their children reached maturity. For example, in 1874 John Proctor left his wives their respective homes and lands only until their youngest child reached the age of sixteen, when the property was to be sold and the proceeds divided as he specified.106 Some men, however, entrusted full control of their estates to their surviving wives. John McDonald gave his wife a lifetime interest in his property for her own use and that of her daughters and the right to designate the distribution of the property to the daughters after her death with the provision that she eliminate from her will any daughter who married a non-Mormon.107 Albert Merrill, with little to leave behind, willed his lot and house to his first wife but reserved the two back rooms for his second wife.108\n\nAt common law, if a husband either disinherited his wife or disposed of all his property in some other way, the common law right of dower, or one-third interest in his real property, protected her. In Utah, however, prohibiting dower was necessary to avoid the impracticability or even impossibility of granting multiple one-third dower interests to plural wives. While granting married women the right to control their own property, the Utah Married Person’s Property Act of 1872 formally disallowed dower in property settlements. Monogamous marriages were thus seriously affected. Absence of dower effectively diminished a legal wife’s claim by withdrawing her contingent, prospective interest in one third of her husband’s property during his lifetime, which he could not transfer away without her consent, and granting her only an equal share with all of her husband’s direct heirs at his death. While non-Mormons complained, Mormon wives declared that dower was a form of “vassalage” and a “relic of the old common law” and claimed that the property rights granted women were far more progressive and reflective of social and economic change.109 After signing the legislation, however, Governor George L. Woods reconsidered and urged the legislature to repeal it at the next session.110 The legislature did not. One polygamy critic, U.S. Vice-President Schuyler Colfax, after visiting Utah, argued: “The right of dower which has been abolished by the Utah legislature (so as to render a polygamous wife slavishly dependent on the husband’s favor for any share of his property after his death for herself or her children) should be reenacted by national legislation and carefully guarded for the legal wife, who, in polygamy is not the favorite as a general rule. This would greatly discourage women from marrying a polygamist.”111\n\nIn 1887 the federal government entered the controversy over the dower. Despite a growing national trend to rescind dower, passage of the antipolygamy Edmunds-Tucker Law that year reinstated in Utah a dower interest for married women in all of their deceased husband’s land held any time during the marriage.112 Five years later Utah legislation provided rules for claiming dower, and for releasing dower interests, and created a cause of action for the wrongful withholding of dower property.113 Court cases addressed various aspects of the right of dower, including the inability of plural wives to claim dower even when the first wife had died.114 The court ruled essentially that “once a plural wife, always an unlawful plural wife.”115 The dower right became part of Utah law in 1896 when the first Utah state legislature enacted a dower provision which mirrored the language of the Edmunds-Tucker Act.116\n\nBy the end of the territorial period, because Utah was in the forefront of the homestead exemption movement and construed the right rather generously along with the federal ruling to reinstate dower rights, monogamous wives in Utah enjoyed greater protections than most women in the country. The restrictions on inheritance of polygamous children that were imposed by the final, most drastic piece of anti-polygamy legislation, the Edmunds-Tucker Act, were removed upon statehood. Plural wives, however, were left without any legal protection if not provided for by will.\n\nWOMEN IN NON-DOMESTIC WORK\n\nDespite the prevailing cultural value of domesticity, Brigham Young enunciated a progressive view of women in the trades and professions. For example, in 1869 he issued a call to women to expand their social usefulness:\n\nWe have sisters here who, if they had the privilege of studying, would make just as good mathematicians or accountants as any man; and we think they ought to have the privilege to study these branches of knowledge that they may develop the powers with which they are endowed. We believe that women are useful, not only to sweep houses, wash dishes, make beds, and raise babies, but that they should stand behind the counter, study law or physic, or become good bookkeepers and be able to do the business in any counting house, and all this to enlarge their sphere of usefulness for the benefit of society at large.117\n\nOut of necessity or by choice, women acted on this invitation and found employment in a variety of professions. As noted by Elizabeth Kane, wife of Brigham Young’s friend, Thomas L. Kane, during a visit to Utah in 1872: “They close no career on a woman in Utah by which she can earn a living.”118 Because of polygamy, widowhood, and their husbands’ missionary service, many women acted as heads of their households, including the role of breadwinner for themselves and their children—and, not infrequently, for their husbands as well. Some did so in traditional ways: domestic service, sewing, millinery, and managing boarding houses. Less traditional occupations in which Utah women were employed included typesetting and printing, bookkeeping, clerking, and accounting. Some women became telegraph operators, nurses, and midwives, and doctors. In the area of vocational choice, Utah was in advance of many other states and territories, including actively finding ways to train women in their chosen field.119 Even the field of law was open to women, although such progressivism is ironic, considering Mormon distrust of lawyers during the early territorial period.120 It was this very disdain for professional lawyers that opened the door for women to enter the legal profession.\n\nTo avoid the necessity of requiring licensed lawyers to protect one’s legal interest when challenged, the 1852 legislature provided another route for litigating cases, a statute that appeared to allow women as well as men to act as their own legal counsel or to choose any person, male or female, of good moral character to represent them.121 While a few courageous women were struggling to assert their admission to various state bars elsewhere, largely unsuccessfully, Utah’s provision, which allowed men and women to act not only in their own behalf but also as counsel for others, was markedly advanced. Although the provision was seldom invoked by women, in 1874 a Provo woman, Martha Jane Coray, may have assisted a sick friend in a legal capacity during several days of court hearings in a custody suit.122 She was at least an active participant in the case. To further protect individuals from exorbitant legal fees, the same act prohibited attorneys from compelling payment through the courts.\n\nDespite these provisions for non-professional legal service and an early denigration of the profession, there were attorneys in Utah territory, including women. Rather than legal expertise or academic credentials, admission to the Utah bar was based on good moral character, a favorable report of an examining committee, or admission to practice in the highest courts of other states or territories:\n\nApplicants for admission to practice as attorneys and counselors of this court, shall be admitted on proof, presented at the time of applications, of good moral character, and on the favorable report of an examining Committee appointed for that purpose; or on the production of a certificate or proof of previous admission to practice in the highest Court of any State or other Territory of the United States. A person admitted to practice in this Court shall be entitled to practice in all Courts of this Territory.123\n\nIn 1872, Utah formally admitted two women to the bar: Phoebe Couzins, a graduate of the Washington University Law School in Missouri, who had previously been admitted to practice in Missouri state and federal courts and in the Arkansas state court but had been denied admission by several other state bars; and Georgiana Snow, daughter of Zerubbabel Snow, a former attorney general of Utah Territory, who had clerked in her father’s law office for three years. In welcoming Couzins and Snow “as sisters at the bar,” the court expressed an unusually favorable view of the prospect of having women members of the bar: “It has been said by a learned writer that law is the refinement of reasoning. Perhaps it is natural to infer that those who have the most refinement ought to be very clear, perhaps intuitive reasoners. Certainly no gentleman of this bar would deny that, in social life, woman’s influence is refining and elevating. May we not hope that the honorable profession of the law be made even more honorable by the admission of women to the bar?”\n\nAnd in welcoming Miss Snow the court stated: “It may be pertinent for the court to remark that Miss Snow will find in Utah an ample field for the exercise of her professional talent. ... The fact that she has long resided here, and that she is the daughter of a lawyer, will be of great service to her, giving her much advantage over strangers who come here, and especially in listening to the complaints of her own sex.”124\n\nFar from being impediments to this traditionally male profession, Judge James B. McKean, chief justice of Utah, asserted, their womanly characteristics would prove advantageous. Myra Bradwell of Illinois, however, found those same characteristics grounds for denying her entry into law. In 1869, after studying law in her husband’s office, she applied for admission to the Illinois Bar. Denied admission, Bradwell carried her case to the U.S. Supreme Court. When the Court finally heard her case in 1873, it ruled against her, declaring, among other reasons, that “the natural and proper timidity and delicacy which belong to the female sex evidently unfits it for many of the occupations of civil life.” Viewing the legal profession as outside the domain of women’s “natural sphere,” it declared that “the constitution of the family organization, which is founded in the divine ordinance, as well as in the nature of things, indicates the domestic sphere as that which properly belongs to the domain and function of womanhood.”125 This attitude prevailed in the majority of states and territories, although this strong bastion of male dominance was beginning to fall through the agitation and determination of women activists. Mormon women concurred with this social norm, but they also created a uniquely female public domain that intersected philosophically with the private and expanded their opportunities for non-domestic activities. Moreover, though Utah’s rationale behind its approach to the legal profession did not result from female agitation, it put Utah in the vanguard of states to remove this impediment to women’s vocational rights.\n\nHowever, the admission of Couzins and Snow did not herald a surge of female lawyers in Utah Territory. Both women eventually left Utah and proved to be ineffective role models for other women in that profession although both became politically active. But in 1892, Utah territory admitted Josephine Kellogg of Provo to the bar, and records show that several other Utah women studied law before the turn of the century, although no evidence is available that they were admitted to the bar.126\n\nJURY DUTY\n\nIn Wyoming, a woman suffrage statute was passed a month before Utah’s, which also allowed women to sit on juries, As soon as Wyoming women began acting in that capacity, however, men organized to take away that right, and it was not restored until the 1940s.127 Unlike the Wyoming law, Utah’s first woman suffrage law, passed in 1870, did not expressly cover the public duty of jury service or the right to hold public office. Before that time women did not sit on juries in the territory, although the law was less than clear in excluding them. Utah’s first general code of civil procedure provided that if either party requested a jury, the court should issue an order to the proper officer requiring him to summon for that purpose, not less than three nor more than twelve “judicious persons,” which suggests the possibility of including women.128 However, the code of criminal procedure enacted in the same session required grand juries of “judicious men.”129 Despite the gender-neutral wording of the civil statute, there is no evidence that women ever served on juries in civil cases nor sought to do so. All enactments concerning petit, grand, and special juries expressly required men, although some women occasionally served on coroners’ juries.130 After the Civil War, Utah’s jury statutes were amended to omit the “free” and “white” requirements, but the “male” requirement remained.131\n\nA case in which the defendant claimed that the exclusion of members of his religion from the jury was a denial of equal protection illustrates the prevailing interpretation of “a jury of one’s peers” of particular importance to women. In pointing out the illogic of the defendant’s argument, the court stated: “The correctness of this theory is contradicted by every day’s experience. Women are not allowed to sit on juries; are they thereby denied the equal protection of the laws?”132 Many women, like Susan B. Anthony, would have answered, “Yes!” In 1872, following a suggestion by the National Woman Suffrage Association, women were urged “to apply for registration” and if that failed to bring suit in order “to secure general and judicial recognition” of their cause. Their plan was to test the Fourteenth Amendment in relation to women’s right to vote, who were U.S. citizens. Anthony and fifteen of her friends in Rochester, New York, succeeded in voting but were thereafter arrested for violating the Enforcement Act. Anthony promptly sued. Before the verdict was delivered the judge gave Anthony opportunity to speak. She responded with a lengthy diatribe against the discriminatory legal system which denied her a jury of her peers, since no women were in the jury box. Though she lost her case, the judge imposed neither a fine nor imprisonment.133\n\nIn many states, jury service was tied to voter status, and women hoped that the opportunity to serve on juries would follow the grant of suffrage. In the decade prior to passage of national suffrage for women by the Nineteenth Amendment in 1920, Washington, Kansas, California, New York, and Michigan gave women the right to serve on juries along with voting rights. Most other states, however, did not.134\n\nWhile many men and women slowly accommodated themselves to the notion of women in the political realm, jury service still appeared to be more appropriately and exclusively a male duty.\n\nEven in those states where jury service was allowed, exemption provisions led to curtailment of women’s presence in the jury box. As late as 1961, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld a state’s power to automatically exempt women from jury service.135\n\nA defendant’s right to have a jury drawn from a pool that included women was not recognized until 1975, and the practice of using peremptory challenges to exclude female jurors on the basis of gender was not ruled unconstitutional until 1994. Indeed for most women in the United States, the right to be considered for jury service was not fully vouchsafed until the last decade of the twentieth century.136\n\nThe right to serve on juries became an issue for Utah women after statehood in 1896. Although the state constitution allowed women all civil and political rights and privileges, this provision was at first not construed to include jury service.137 The point was debated and passed in the first state legislative session in January 1896. Utah thus became the first state to have a permanent statute that allowed women to serve as jurors. However, Utah women could also claim exemption from doing so. Utah’s first governor, Heber M. Wells, so indicated in his 1902 report on the effectiveness of woman suffrage in Utah, published in Susan B. Anthony’s History of Woman Suffrage: “One of the bugaboos of the opposition [to woman suffrage] was that women would be compelled to sit on juries. Not a single instance of the kind has happened in the State, for the reason that women are never summoned; the law simply exempts them, but does not exclude them.”138\n\nPOLITICAL RIGHTS\n\nThe national suffrage movement, Utah’s location in the more liberal West, Mormon interests, and federal authority all converged when the Utah’s territorial legislature granted Utah women the right to vote in 1870. During the 1860s, Congress introduced several bills extending the franchise to women of the various territories, partly as an experiment in female suffrage, as an inducement to female migration to the West, and as a mean of eradicating polygamy in Utah. Since plural wives were particularly oppressed, it was reasoned, suffrage in Utah territory would help elevate them by giving them the political power to remove the source of their oppression.139\n\nWhen Congressional attempts at woman suffrage legislation failed, Utah’s delegate, William H. Hooper, embraced the idea of suffrage for Utah women as a means of countering the image of subjugated Mormon women while also enhancing Mormon political unity. There was little fear that women would use the vote as a tool to outlaw polygamy since they were as committed to the principle as LDS men. In fact, in a show of unity, a number of LDS women, responding to a particularly punitive anti-polygamy congressional proposal, planned a general woman’s rally for January 1870. Declaring that it was time to “rise up ... and speak for ourselves,” they also drafted a resolution to “demand” from Acting Governor S. A. Mann “the right of franchise” and planned to send two women to Washington, D.C., to plead their case before lawmakers.140 As matters turned out, it became unnecessary for them to act on either resolution. The territorial legislature granted them the right to vote just weeks later, and various business associations throughout the country decried the harsh economic restraints and political ramifications of the proposed bill.141 The pressure of Hooper’s recommendation, the favorable attitude toward woman suffrage of church leaders, positive articles in the Deseret News, and adoption of woman suffrage in nearby Wyoming a few weeks earlier all contributed to a favorable outcome in Utah. To cap these persuasive developments, Mormon women’s bold initiative in mounting a rally in defense of plural marriage influenced the legislature to return a unanimous vote to enfranchise women. In the prolonged absence of the newly appointed governor, Mann reluctantly signed the act on February 12, 1870.142 National suffragists were delighted, Congress surprised, and federal officials in Utah alarmed.\n\nAlthough enfranchisement did not expressly confer the right to hold office, Mary Cook ran for Salt Lake County Superintendent of Common Schools in 1874 and her sister Ida was elected Superintendent of Schools in Cache County in 1877. Both women, however, were ruled ineligible.143 In 1878, women attended caucuses of the Mormon People’s Party for the first time, and three women were elected delegates to the county convention. At that convention, Emmeline B. Wells, editor of the Woman’s Exponent, was nominated for county treasurer. When it was again determined that the statute did not allow a woman to hold office, women began a two-year campaign to amend the law. The first attempt in 1878 failed. A second effort in 1880 passed the legislature but the federally appointed governor refused to sign the bill.144 In commiserating with Utah women, Susan B. Anthony lamented the “utter hopelessness of making any changes. ... Men have so long had absolute control,” she continued, “that every activity of woman to shape matters in the primary meetings and nominating conventions is still deemed an intrusion on her part.”145 Emmeline B. Wells, a strong proponent of the bill, quickly retorted. In Utah, she said, “every office open to woman, she has been allowed to occupy,” including membership on nominating committees. As delegates to county and territorial conventions, women have always “been most politely treated, invited to speak, and express opinion.” Failure to amend the law to include the right to hold office, she wrote, cannot be laid at the feet of the Mormon legislature, but solely at the door of the federally appointed governor, who had “refused to extend the courtesy of his signature.”146 Women made no further attempts to achieve the right to hold elective office until statehood.\n\nIn 1878, almost simultaneously with the drive to extend women’s political rights, a group of disaffected and non-Mormon women organized the Anti-Polygamy Society. One of the society’s first acts was to draw up a memorial to President Rutherford B. Hayes denouncing polygamy and urging the repeal of woman suffrage in Utah. Mormon women countered with a second mass rally and their own memorial affirming their constitutional right to the free exercise of their religion.147 The Anti-Polygamy Society, however, caught the interest of many national moral reform associations dedicated to stamping out immoral practices, among which they included polygamy, and proved to be a formidable national force in publicizing the practice and creating public opinion against it.\n\nLocal efforts to disfranchise Mormon women climaxed in 1880, when members of the non-Mormon Liberal party challenged the validity of the 1870 law giving women the vote. They filed suit for a writ of mandamus to compel the voting registrar in Salt Lake County to strike the names of all women from the registration list. Their challenge was based on the claim that the act was discriminatory because the 1859 act enfranchising male voters required them to be taxpayers while the 1870 act contained no such requirement for women. In addition, men were required to be citizens but women who were only wives or daughters of citizens (and not citizens themselves) were eligible to vote. The large number of immigrant converts to Mormonism made the provision particularly relevant. The defense argued that the court had no jurisdiction and that the complaint did not state a cause of action. The court affirmed its jurisdiction but denied the mandamus, ruling that this writ was capable only of compelling a person to do what the law as enacted required him to do, not to prevent a person from following the law or compel him to act contrary to the law.148 Letters and telegrams of congratulations to the women of Utah poured in from suffragists throughout the country.\n\nIn Lyman v. Martin, decided the next year, the validity of the act granting women voting rights was again challenged on the same basis. In that case, a candidate sued to have election results publicly announced by officials who had refused to do so because they claimed the election law was void. Rather than voiding the statute giving women the vote, however, the court ruled that the taxpayer requirement for men should be stricken. It also held that the act perhaps permitted a female noncitizen to register and that other territorial statutes requiring voters to be citizens applied to women as well.149 Several other unsuccessful local attempts to disfranchise Utah women followed, but suffrage was left intact.150\n\nWhere local court action was unable to rescind women’s right to vote, federal legislation succeeded. The Edmunds Act of 1882 denied suffrage to all participants in plural marriage and empowered a federally appointed Utah Commission with control of elections. In Murphy v. Ramsey, the plaintiffs contested the constitutionality of a “test oath” requiring voters to declare whether they were then practicing or ever had practiced plural marriage. In 1885 the case reached the U.S. Supreme Court, which held that the retroactive sweep of the oath was beyond the commission’s power but upheld the disfranchisement of those currently practicing polygamy. Two of the plaintiffs, both women and both married to polygamists, were thus allowed to vote, since the husband of one had died before passage of the Edmunds Act, and the other had separated from her husband since its passage. The court required that the prospective voter be evaluated on the basis of his or her status at the time of registration.151 Thus non-Mormon and Mormon women who did not practice polygamy or no longer practiced it (widowed, divorced, separated, deserted) were still entitled to vote—but only temporarily. The Edmunds-Tucker Act, which Congress passed in 1887, the most sweeping of all anti-polygamy bills, disfranchised all Utah women. Thus, the 1870 gratuitous offering of suffrage to Utah women, which had met a pressing religious need, had now, like other laws associated with polygamy, also bowed to federal intervention. Many non-Mormon women living in Utah willingly relinquished the franchise, their aversion to polygamy being stronger than their appreciation of the vote.\n\nThe final chapter in the story of woman suffrage in Utah concerns the effort of Mormon women and a few other Utah suffragists to regain the vote. After Mormon Church president Wilford Woodruff issued his manifesto in 1890, counseling church members to obey the law of the land and withdrawing support for new plural marriages, the forty-year wait for statehood gradually drew to a close. Presidential pardons and a general amnesty in 1891 by outgoing President Benjamin Harrison restored some of the rights of citizenship cancelled by the Edmunds-Tucker Law. A second amnesty in 1893 by Grover Cleveland restored the franchise to polygamist males but not to women. Utah women had already organized to regain suffrage, however, in anticipation of statehood. They were therefore ready to mount an extensive grassroots effort to secure a commitment of support from both political parties when the Constitutional Convention met in March 1895.152 Once the delegates were elected, however, and the Convention convened, the status of woman suffrage became uncertain.\n\nAn unexpected debate on the issue lasted twelve days, a fifth of the time allotted for the entire Convention. One prominent delegate, B. H. Roberts, a Democrat from Davis County and a member of the third-tier General Authorities (First Council of Seventy, just below the First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve), persuasively argued first, that woman suffrage might elicit a negative reaction in Congress and jeopardize passage of the constitution, and second, that as voters or office holders, women lost their womanliness. Other delegates tended to agree with one or the other of these arguments. A compromise, to which many delegates agreed, was to submit the woman suffrage clause to the voters separately from the constitution. However, despite the numerous petitions favoring separate submission and the eloquent oratory of Roberts, pro-suffrage delegates Orson F. Whitney and Franklin S. Richards were more persuasive. The delegates finally passed the woman suffrage proposal, as did the voters at the ratification election, and Utah’s women once again enjoyed the vote. Riding on its coattails was a broad affirmation of equality of rights for women: “The rights of the citizens of the State of Utah to vote and hold office shall not be denied or abridged on account of sex. Both male and female citizens of this State shall enjoy equally all civil, political and religious rights and privileges.”153\n\nA further twist in the history of woman suffrage in Utah occurred after the close of the Constitutional Convention. Ambiguity in the language of the Enabling Act, which permitted Utah to apply for statehood, raised the possibility that women might be eligible to vote at the ratification election in November 1895. Franklin S. Richards, a convention delegate, proposed that they do so but it was never brought before the assembly. Thus, the intent of the Enabling Act had to be judicially decided. Sarah E. Anderson of Ogden, Utah, agreed to be party to a test case. In July, two months after adjournment of the Constitutional Convention, Anderson attempted to register and was denied. She sued and was issued a writ of mandate against the registrar of voters, Charles Tyree, who appealed to the Utah Supreme Court.\n\nWhile awaiting the court’s decision, both Democrats and Republicans wooed women to their parties. The Republicans went so far as to put the names of three women on their ballot, holding to the assumption that they would be legally entitled to hold office by the time they were installed in January of the following year. Though the District Court had ruled in favor of Sarah E. Anderson, the Utah Supreme Court ruled against her appeal. The qualifications designed by the Enabling Act (male, citizen, twenty-one or over), it ruled, were in force for the November election and the provision in the Utah Constitution making women qualified voters could have no effect until the constitution was ratified and Utah was a state.154 Public pressure forced the women to withdraw at that point; but the next year, legally empowered to vote and hold office, Utah women helped to elect Martha Hughes Cannon as the first woman state senator in the United States, and two other women, Sarah E. Anderson of Ogden and Eurithe K. LaBarthe, as state representatives, along with several other women as county recorders.155 And so, after a tumultuous half-century, the longest territorial period of any state in the United States, came to a close, and Utah entered the Union as the forty-third state and the third state to grant its women the right to vote.\n\nWith Wilford Woodruff’s 1890 Manifesto against polygamy and the 1896 grant of statehood, the Mormon experiment in legislating support of what came to be an illegal practice became irrelevant. The umbrella of the Constitutional guarantee of freedom of religion, which Mormons had always claimed, failed to protect them from the storms of public outrage and federal prosecution. For nearly half a century the Mormon Church had held tenaciously to a religious practice at odds with the country’s social norms, using the law to protect that practice. The resulting zigzag course of law-making in nineteenth-century Utah also reflected the looser gender boundaries resulting from the expanding women’s rights movement and the freer Western social environment of which it was a part. In the process, it advanced a consciousness of women’s need for a separate legal and political identity, moving Utah women into the forefront of the movement for equal rights. By the time of statehood, however, other Utah laws and its judicial system were generally harmonious with more traditional American jurisprudence. There were clear jurisdictional boundaries between the district and probate courts, and Mormon ecclesiastical courts heard fewer domestic and civil disputes, confining themselves to traditional ecclesiastical matters.\n\nFor nearly fifty years, territorial Utah served as a study of the interplay of law and the community of interests it serves. To achieve statehood, Utah had to acknowledge the broader community of which it was a reluctant part by eliminating the offending practice of plural marriage as well as those laws designed to protect it. Utah began the territorial period with a statutory disassociation from the common law and public disdain for the legal profession. Yet its dominant institution, the Mormon Church, found itself drawn ineluctably into a protracted legal battle with the federal government, ironically dependent on the legal profession to defend its interests. In that legal struggle, the women of Utah, both Mormon and non-Mormon, found their legal status constantly in flux. Plural wives were ultimately the losers. Following statehood, a time of enormous legal readjustment, they continued to face legal discrimination as they attempted to press mainly unsuccessful claims for legal protection. But Utah entered statehood bringing with it a number of legal and political entitlements to women, including the right to vote, hold elective office, practice law, serve on juries, and other advances still unavailable to women in the majority of states. The half-century struggle had its rewards. Perhaps the major legal insight culled from Utah’s territorial experience is how the law can serve as an instrument of social innovation, even as it serves as a tool of social conformity.\n\nNOTES\n\n1.

Early nineteenth-century feminists used Blackstone and the strictures of the common law in their unmodified form as a symbol of the inequalities that women experienced. The 1848 “Declaration of Sentiments” drafted at the first woman’s rights convention in Seneca Falls, New York, included the inability of married women to hold property and control their wages as one of the grievances enumerated.

Blackstone, Commentaries on the Law of England, 1:355. Johnston, “Sex and Property: The Common Law Tradition, the Law School Curriculum, and Developments Toward Equality,” 1033–83, discusses four rationales for the common-law status of married women, none of which fully accounts for it: (1) the biblical ideal that husband and wife become one flesh may justify the merger of identities but does not justify women’s subordinate status; (2) the theory of a husband’s guardianship of his wife is invalid because the law is inconsistent in its treatment of women as the weaker sex, and single women do not fall under this rationale; (3) marriage as a contract does not hold, given the uniformity of results in each marriage arrangement and the lack of free bargaining power; (4) the practical need for final authority to resolve disputes does not necessarily require that the husband have all power. In business partnerships, management and decision-making powers are shared.\n\n6. Hoff, Law, Gender and Injustice, 120–128, 87–90. Initially, removal of legal disabilities dominated the arguments of the early feminists; and while twenty-nine states had passed some form of married women’s property legislation by 1865, it was in many cases limited and narrowly interpreted. Legal historians have traced the continuity of traditional judicial attitudes in New York and elsewhere, especially in appellate decisions, despite the passage of married women’s property acts.\n\n7.
