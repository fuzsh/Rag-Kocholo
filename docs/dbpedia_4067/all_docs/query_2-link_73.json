        "text": "Standard I Standard II Standard III Standard IV Standard V\n\nStudents will understand how the exploration and colonization of North America transformed human history.\n\nField Trips\n\nObjective 1:\n\nDescribe and explain the growth and development of the early American colonies.\n\nActivities\n\nMake a Globe\n\nIn this unit students will develop map making skills, learn new vocabulary words by creating a globe, and finally, map out routes taken by early explorers.\n\nThe globe can be made the traditional paper machÃ© way, or for a quicker faster way, made by using a punch ball found at most dollar stores, or at Oriental Trading Company. To create the globe, inflate the punch ball to desired size. When globe has been created, students will divide the globe into different hemispheres (labeling as they go). They will then create and label latitude and longitude lines, starting with the Prime Meridian and Equator. To do this, have students cut a piece of string to go completely around the globe, leaving about an inch on each end from which to work with. Cover the string with chalk, tighten the string around the globe, gently flip it onto the balloon to create a temporary line. Then trace the temporary line with a permanent marker. After latitude and longitude lines have been drawn and labeled, students will trace the seven continents on the globe. (To make this easier, the teacher might want to cut out continent shapes from cardstock to be used for tracing). After the globe is completed, students will develop a historical understanding of the early explorers by researching and tracing these explorerâs routes on the globe. Latitude and Longitude Objects\n\nGive each student a map with longitude and latitude grids. Have one or two students bring an object from somewhere in the world each day. The student has to look up the longitude and latitude of where their object is from. The student tells the class the objectâs longitude and latitude and the class has to find the location on their map and mark it. Itâs a great review for longitude and latitude!\n\nLesson Plans\n\nMaps Through Time\n\nIn this activity students will analyze explorers' maps and put them in chronologically order.

leaders.\n\nAssess how the Revolutionary War changed the way people thought about their own rights.\n\nExplain how the winning of the war set in motion a need for a new government that would serve the needs of the new states.\n\nStudents will understand the rights and responsibilities guaranteed in the United States Constitution and Bill of Rights.\n\nField Trips\n\nObjective 1:\n\nAssess the underlying principles of the US Constitution as the framework for the United States' form of government, a compound constitutional republic.\n\nLesson Plans\n\nHow a Bill Becomes a Law\n\nAfter completing several activities students will be able to explain how a bill becomes a law.\n\nIndicators:\n\nRecognize ideas from documents used to develop the Constitution (e.g. Magna Carta, Iroquois Confederacy, Articles of Confederation, Virginia Plan).\n\nAnalyze goals outlined in the Preamble.\n\nDistinguish between the role of the Legislative, Executive, and Judicial branches of the government.\n\nExplain the process of passing a law.\n\nDescribe the concept of checks and balances.\n\nDiscover the basis for the patriotic and citizenship traditions we have today (i.e. Pledge of Allegiance, flag etiquette, voting).\n\nObjective 2:\n\nAssess how the US Constitution has been amended and interpreted over time, and the impact these amendments have had on the rights and responsibilities of citizens of the United States.\n\nLesson Plans\n\nBill of Rights\n\nStudents will investigate one of the amendments to the Constitution to find out how it was important for the time, how it protects citizens and how it applies to our current needs.\n\nIndicators:\n\nExplain the significance of the Bill of Rights.\n\nIdentify how the rights of selected groups have changed and how the Constitution reflects those changes (e.g. women, enslaved people).\n\nAnalyze the impact of the Constitution on their lives today (e.g. freedom of religion, speech, press, assembly, petition).\n\nStudents will understand that the 19th century was a time of incredible change for the United States, including geographic expansion, constitutional crisis, and economic growth.\n\nField Trips\n\nObjective 1:\n\nInvestigate the significant events during Americaâs expansion and the roles people played.\n\nLesson Plans\n\nThe Trail of Tears and the Forced Relocation of the Cherokee Nation\n\nThis National Park Service lesson plan commemorates the removal of the Cherokee and the paths that 17 Cherokee detachments followed westward. It also promotes a greater awareness of the Trail's legacy and the effects of the United States' policy of American Indian removal not only on the Cherokee, but also on other tribes, primarily the Chickasaw, Choctaw, Creek, and Seminole.\n\nHistory Detectives 5th Grade Standard IV Object. 1\n\nStudents will use primary source materials to investigate significant events in American History of the 19th Century.\n\nIndicators:\n\nIdentify key reasons why people move and the traits necessary for survival.\n\nExamine causes and consequences of important events in the United States expansion (e.g. Louisiana Purchase, Lewis and Clark expedition, treaties with American Indians, Homestead Act, Trail of Tears, California Gold Rush).\n\nCompare the trails that were important during westward expansion (e.g. Oregon, Mormon, Spanish, California).\n\nAssess the impact of expansion on native inhabitants of the west.\n\nObjective 2:\n\nAssess the geographic, cultural, political, and economic divisions between regions that contributed to the Civil War.\n\nLesson Plans\n\nHistory Detectives 5th Grade Standard IV Object. 2\n\nStudents will use primary source materials to investigate the economy, physical geography, and cultural aspects of the Northern States and the Southern States prior to the Civil War.\n\nIndicators:\n\nDescribe the impact of physical geography on the cultures of the northern and southern regions (e.g. industrial resources, agriculture, climate).\n\nCompare how cultural and economic differences of the North and South led to tensions.\n\nIdentify the range of individual responses to the growing political conflicts between the North and South (e.g. states rights advocates, abolitionists, slaveholders, enslaved people).\n\nObjective 3:\n\nEvaluate the course of events of the Civil War and its impact both immediate and long-term.\n\nLesson Plans\n\nHistory Detectives 5th Grade Standard IV Object. 3\n\nStudents will use primary source materials to investigate significant historical events during the American Civil War.\n\nIndicators:\n\nIdentify the key ideas, events, and leaders of the Civil War using primary sources (e.g. Gettysburg Address, Emancipation Proclamation, news accounts, photographic records, diaries).\n\nContrast the impact of the war on individuals in various regions (e.g. North, South, West).\n\nExplain how the Civil War helped forge ideas of national identity.\n\nExamine the difficulties of reconciliation within the nation.\n\nObjective 4:\n\nUnderstand the impact of major economic forces at work in the post-Civil War.\n\nLesson Plans\n\nHistory Detectives 5th Grade\n\nStudents will use primary source materials to investigate significant events in Post-Civil War American History of the 19th Century.\n\nIndicators:\n\nAssess how the free-market system in the United States serves as an engine of change and innovation.\n\nDescribe the wide-ranging impact of the Industrial Revolution (e.g. inventions, industries, innovations).\n\nEvaluate the roles new immigrants played in the economy of this time.\n\nStudents will address the causes, consequences and implications of the emergence of the United States as a world power.\n\nField Trips\n\nObjective 1:\n\nDescribe the role of the United States during World War I, The Great Depression, and World War II.\n\nLesson Plans\n\nImpact of World War I on the United States\n\nAfter reading about World War I, students will decide which event had the most impact on the United States.\n\nIndicators:\n\nReview the impact of World War I on the United States.\n\nSummarize the consequences of the Great Depression on the United States (e.g. mass migration, the New Deal).\n\nAnalyze how the United Statesâ involvement in World War II led to its emergence as a superpower.\n\nObjective 2:\n\nAssess the impact of social and political movements in recent United States history.\n\nLesson Plans\n\nSocial Movements of the 20th Century\n\nStudents will select a social or political movement of the 20th century (e.g. woman's movement, civil rights movement) to research and share what they learned with their classmates.\n\nIndicators:\n\nIdentify major social movements of the 20th century (e.g. the womenâs movement, the civil rights movement, child labor reforms).\n\nIdentify leaders of social and political movements\n\nObjective 3:\n\nEvaluate the role of the United States as a world power.\n\nIndicators:\n\nAssess differing points of view on the role of the US as a world power (e.g. influencing the spread of democracy, supporting the rule of law, advocating human rights, promoting environmental stewardship).\n\nIdentify a current issue facing the world and propose a role the United States could play in being part of a solution (e.g. genocide, child labor, civil rights, education, public health, environmental protections, suffrage, economic disparities)."
