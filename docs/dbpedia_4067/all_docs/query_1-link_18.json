        "text": "Heber City Solar Power Information & Peak Sun Hours\n\nSolar Green Energy Summary for Heber City, Utah\n\nLattitude: 40.5069\n\nSunlight\n\nFixed Tilt Sunlight Hours: 5.7 hours per day\n\n1-Axis Tilt Sunlight Hours: 8.2 hours per day\n\n2-Axis Tilt Sunlight Hours: 8.3 hours per day\n\nIf you put your solar powered math calculator in your backpack it will turn off from the lack of sunlight needed to power the device. As you slowly open your backpack and begin to let sunlight in, the calculator will eventually turn on when the amount of sunlight is enough to power the calculator. Similarly, peak sun hours refer to the hours of they day where the sunlight is strong enough to power a solar panel. This is different from total sunlight hours, which is simply the amount of hours in a day when there is any sunlight.\n\nIf you open the newspaper in the morning or watch the weather channel on the news you can get an accurate prediction of sunrise and sunset each day for Heber City. However, still knowing that the latitude of Heber City is 40.5 can be a helpful number for your solar panel setup and planning. The closer your latitude is to zero the closer you are to the equator. At the equator you find the most consistent total sunlight hours throughout any given day of the year. As your latitude increases you can see larger discrepancies of daily sunlight hours during the year. For example, having very long summer days and very short and dark winter days\n\nThe sun moves through the sky during the day, and changes positions in the sky throughout the year as the seasons change. A fixed solar panel remains fixed in position during this movement. So, although it is effective in capturing sunlight, a 1-axis or 2-axis panel can be more efficient. A 1-axis panel tracks the sun's movement throughout the day from sunrise to sunset. In addition to that, the 2-axis panel also accounts for the movement throughout the year.\n\nThe sun is a great ball of gas that rises and sets every day that the earth rotates while in orbit around the sun. Barring any major disasters this is a very predictable occurance every day. Latitude helps predict this even more, narrowing it down to the minute for sunrise and sunset. But some things arenâ€™t as predictable that will greatly influence the efficiency of solar panels. Weather and cloud coverage for example can greatly diminish peak sun hours on any given day. Thick storm clouds will block a high percentage of the sun's rays, resulting in lower output of your solar panels. Weather needs to be factored into deciding when to use your system, or how much output one expects to get.\n\nWe can use previous years of data to estimate the amount of peak sun hours in Heber City. A fixed tilt mount for example will receive 5.7 average hours per day. For more efficiency for your system in Heber City you could use a 1-axis tracking mount and increase your daily peak sun average to 8.2 hours, or even further with a 2-axis panel to get an average of 8.3 hours.\n\nSolar Businesses in Heber City, Utah\n\nBe the first to hear about the latest green energy news, technology and offers.\n\n[mc4wp_form id=\"2942\"]\n\nBy providing your email you consent to receiving occasional promotional emails & newsletters.\n\nNo Spam.
