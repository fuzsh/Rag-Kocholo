The lowest chance of overcast or mostly cloudy conditions is 23% on September 10.\n\nThe clearest day of the month is September 10, with clear, mostly clear, or partly cloudy conditions 77% of the time.\n\nFor reference, on February 29, the cloudiest day of the year, the chance of overcast or mostly cloudy conditions is 53%, while on September 10, the clearest day of the year, the chance of clear, mostly clear, or partly cloudy skies is 77%.\n\nCloud Cover Categories in September in Heber City\n\n0% clear 20% mostly clear 40% partly cloudy 60% mostly cloudy 80% overcast 100%\n\nPrecipitation\n\nA wet day is one with at least 0.04 inches of liquid or liquid-equivalent precipitation. In Heber City, the chance of a wet day over the course of September is essentially constant, remaining around 19% throughout.\n\nFor reference, the year's highest daily chance of a wet day is 25% on April 27, and its lowest chance is 11% on June 27.\n\nRainfall\n\nTo show variation within the month and not just the monthly total, we show the rainfall accumulated over a sliding 31-day period centered around each day.\n\nThe average sliding 31-day rainfall during September in Heber City is gradually increasing, starting the month at 1.1 inches, when it rarely exceeds 2.0 inches or falls below 0.3 inches, and ending the month at 1.4 inches, when it rarely exceeds 2.7 inches or falls below 0.2 inches.\n\nThe highest average 31-day accumulation is 1.4 inches on September 28.\n\nSun\n\nOver the course of September in Heber City, the length of the day is rapidly decreasing. From the start to the end of the month, the length of the day decreases by 1 hour, 16 minutes, implying an average daily decrease of 2 minutes, 38 seconds, and weekly decrease of 18 minutes, 27 seconds.\n\nThe shortest day of the month is September 30, with 11 hours, 47 minutes of daylight and the longest day is September 1, with 13 hours, 3 minutes of daylight.\n\nThe earliest sunrise of the month in Heber City is 6:53 AM on September 1 and the latest sunrise is 28 minutes later at 7:21 AM on September 30.\n\nThe latest sunset is 7:56 PM on September 1 and the earliest sunset is 48 minutes earlier at 7:08 PM on September 30.\n\nDaylight saving time is observed in Heber City during 2024, but it neither starts nor ends during September, so the entire month is in standard time.\n\nFor reference, on June 20, the longest day of the year, the Sun rises at 5:55 AM and sets 15 hours, 4 minutes later, at 8:59 PM, while on December 21, the shortest day of the year, it rises at 7:45 AM and sets 9 hours, 17 minutes later, at 5:02 PM.\n\nThe figure below presents a compact representation of the sun's elevation (the angle of the sun above the horizon) and azimuth (its compass bearing) for every hour of every day in the reporting period. The horizontal axis is the day of the year and the vertical axis is the hour of the day. For a given day and hour of that day, the background color indicates the azimuth of the sun at that moment.

Lower dew points feel drier and higher dew points feel more humid. Unlike temperature, which typically varies significantly between night and day, dew point tends to change more slowly, so while the temperature may drop at night, a muggy day is typically followed by a muggy night.\n\nThe chance that a given day will be muggy in Heber City is essentially constant during September, remaining around 0% throughout.\n\nFor reference, on August 2, the muggiest day of the year, there are muggy conditions 0% of the time, while on January 1, the least muggy day of the year, there are muggy conditions 0% of the time.\n\nWind\n\nThis section discusses the wide-area hourly average wind vector (speed and direction) at 10 meters above the ground. The wind experienced at any given location is highly dependent on local topography and other factors, and instantaneous wind speed and direction vary more widely than hourly averages.\n\nThe average hourly wind speed in Heber City is essentially constant during September, remaining around 5.0 miles per hour throughout.\n\nFor reference, on March 29, the windiest day of the year, the daily average wind speed is 6.0 miles per hour, while on August 2, the calmest day of the year, the daily average wind speed is 4.7 miles per hour.\n\nThe highest daily average wind speed during September is 5.0 miles per hour on September 12.\n\nThe wind direction in Heber City during September is predominantly out of the south from September 1 to September 17 and the west from September 17 to September 30.\n\nWind Direction in September in Heber City\n\nnortheastsouthwest\n\nGrowing Season\n\nDefinitions of the growing season vary throughout the world, but for the purposes of this report, we define it as the longest continuous period of non-freezing temperatures (≥ 32Â°F) in the year (the calendar year in the Northern Hemisphere, or from July 1 until June 30 in the Southern Hemisphere).\n\nThe growing season in Heber City typically lasts for 5.0 months (155 days), from around May 5 to around October 7, rarely starting before April 13 or after May 24, and rarely ending before September 17 or after October 30.\n\nThe month of September in Heber City is more likely than not fully within the growing season, with the chance that a given day is in the growing season rapidly decreasing from 100% to 66% over the course of the month.\n\nTime Spent in Various Temperature Bands and the Growing Season in September in Heber City\n\nfrigid 15Â°F freezing 32Â°F very cold 45Â°F cold 55Â°F cool 65Â°F comfortable 75Â°F warm 85Â°F hot 95Â°F sweltering\n\nGrowing degree days are a measure of yearly heat accumulation used to predict plant and animal development, and defined as the integral of warmth above a base temperature, discarding any excess above a maximum temperature. In this report, we use a base of 50Â°F and a cap of 86Â°F.\n\nThe average accumulated growing degree days in Heber City are increasing during September, increasing by 304Â°F, from 1,946Â°F to 2,250Â°F, over the course of the month.\n\nSolar Energy\n\nThis section discusses the total daily incident shortwave solar energy reaching the surface of the ground over a wide area, taking full account of seasonal variations in the length of the day, the elevation of the Sun above the horizon, and absorption by clouds and other atmospheric constituents. Shortwave radiation includes visible light and ultraviolet radiation.\n\nThe average daily incident shortwave solar energy in Heber City is decreasing during September, falling by 1.3 kWh, from 6.4 kWh to 5.1 kWh, over the course of the month.\n\nAverage Daily Incident Shortwave Solar Energy in September in Heber City\n\nTopography\n\nFor the purposes of this report, the geographical coordinates of Heber City are 40.507 deg latitude, -111.413 deg longitude, and 5,597 ft elevation.\n\nThe topography within 2 miles of Heber City contains significant variations in elevation, with a maximum elevation change of 502 feet and an average elevation above sea level of 5,634 feet. Within 10 miles contains significant variations in elevation (5,430 feet). Within 50 miles also contains extreme variations in elevation (11,785 feet).\n\nThe area within 2 miles of Heber City is covered by cropland (76%) and shrubs (13%), within 10 miles by shrubs (56%) and trees (26%), and within 50 miles by shrubs (48%) and trees (32%).\n\nData Sources\n\nThis report illustrates the typical weather in Heber City, based on a statistical analysis of historical hourly weather reports and model reconstructions from January 1, 1980 to December 31, 2016.\n\nTemperature and Dew Point\n\nThere are 5 weather stations near enough to contribute to our estimation of the temperature and dew point in Heber City.\n\nFor each station, the records are corrected for the elevation difference between that station and Heber City according to the International Standard Atmosphere , and by the relative change present in the MERRA-2 satellite-era reanalysis between the two locations.\n\nThe estimated value at Heber City is computed as the weighted average of the individual contributions from each station, with weights proportional to the inverse of the distance between Heber City and a given station.\n\nThe stations contributing to this reconstruction are:\n\nProvo Municipal Airport (KPVU, 39%, 26 mi, southwest, -1,102 ft elevation change)\n\nSalt Lake City International Airport (KSLC, 26%, 35 mi, northwest, -1,375 ft elevation change)\n\nEvanston-Uinta County Burns Field (KEVW, 15%, 57 mi, north, 1,565 ft elevation change)\n\nCarbon County Airport (KPUC, 12%, 71 mi, southeast, 322 ft elevation change)\n\nVernal Regional Airport (KVEL, 7%, 100 mi, east, -328 ft elevation change)\n\nTo get a sense of how much these sources agree with each other, you can view a comparison of Heber City and the stations that contribute to our estimates of its temperature history and climate. Please note that each source's contribution is adjusted for elevation and the relative change present in the MERRA-2 data.\n\nOther Data\n\nAll data relating to the Sun's position (e.g., sunrise and sunset) are computed using astronomical formulas from the book, Astronomical Algorithms 2nd Edition , by Jean Meeus.\n\nAll other weather data, including cloud cover, precipitation, wind speed and direction, and solar flux, come from NASA's MERRA-2 Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis . This reanalysis combines a variety of wide-area measurements in a state-of-the-art global meteorological model to reconstruct the hourly history of weather throughout the world on a 50-kilometer grid.\n\nLand Use data comes from the Global Land Cover SHARE database , published by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations.\n\nElevation data comes from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) , published by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.\n\nNames, locations, and time zones of places and some airports come from the GeoNames Geographical Database .\n\nTime zones for airports and weather stations are provided by AskGeo.com .\n\nMaps are © OpenStreetMap contributors.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nThe information on this site is provided as is, without any assurances as to its accuracy or suitability for any purpose. Weather data is prone to errors, outages, and other defects. We assume no responsibility for any decisions made on the basis of the content presented on this site.\n\nWe draw particular cautious attention to our reliance on the MERRA-2 model-based reconstructions for a number of important data series. While having the tremendous advantages of temporal and spatial completeness, these reconstructions: (1) are based on computer models that may have model-based errors, (2) are coarsely sampled on a 50 km grid and are therefore unable to reconstruct the local variations of many microclimates, and (3) have particular difficulty with the weather in some coastal areas, especially small islands.\n\nWe further caution that our travel scores are only as good as the data that underpin them, that weather conditions at any given location and time are unpredictable and variable, and that the definition of the scores reflects a particular set of preferences that may not agree with those of any particular reader.\n\nPlease review our full terms contained on our Terms of Service page."
