Visibility deteriorates as the sky gets brighter.\n\nJupiter rise and set in Heber City\n\nView before sunrise.\n\nJupiter can best be seen in the hours just before sunrise. Visibility deteriorates as the sky gets brighter.\n\nSaturn rise and set in Heber City\n\nMost of the night until sunrise.\n\nSaturn is visible during most of the night, but it is best viewed in the early morning hours and until sunrise.\n\nUranus rise and set in Heber City\n\nView before sunrise. Bring binoculars.\n\nUranus can best be seen in the hours just before sunrise. Visibility deteriorates as the sky gets brighter. You may need binoculars.\n\nNeptune rise and set in Heber City\n\nMost of the night until sunrise. Use binoculars.\n\nNeptune is visible during most of the night, but it is best viewed in the early morning hours and until sunrise. Very faint, use binoculars."
