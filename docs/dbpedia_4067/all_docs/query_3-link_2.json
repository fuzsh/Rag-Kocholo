From the tippy top of the state down to its bootylicious bottom, you can view and interact with our maps to learn about all the multitudinous things to do in Utah.\n\nOr spend some coin and buy a real-life Utah map for the street cred. Whatever you need to help plan your trip to national parks and monuments, state parks, and major cities in Utah\n\nWasatch North Region\n\nEverything here feels tucked away. Just like you hide the good cookies on the top shelf, Utah keeps some of its best alpine adventures hidden all the way up north.\n\nExpect bucolic farmland around Logan, uncrowded locals-only ski resorts, and a giant secret freshwater Caribbean.\n\nKey Locations\n\nBear Lake\n\nLogan\n\nBeaver Mountain, Cherry Peak, Snowbasin, Powder Mountain, Nordic Valley Ski Resorts\n\nHyrum Lake State Park\n\nEast Canyon State Park\n\nWeber State University & Utah State University\n\nFind out how to get there, what to see, and where to stay. ->\n\nWasatch Front Region\n\nThree counties. Four percent of the state. Two-thirds of its population. But “this is(n’t just) the place” for people watching.\n\nThe Wasatch Front transitions gracefully from skiable, bikeable mountains to metropolitan conveniences. One minute you’re carb-loading at a restaurant on Main Street. A few minutes later, you’re literally on a mountain trail or sailing on the largest saltwater lake in the Western Hemisphere.\n\nKey Locations\n\nGreat Salt Lake State Park\n\nSalt Lake City\n\nProvo\n\nAlta, Brighton, Snowbird, Solitude, Sundance Ski Resorts\n\nTemple Square\n\nSLC International Airport\n\nAntelope Island State Park​\n\nFind out how to get there, what to see, and where to stay. ->\n\nWasatch Back Region\n\nThis is what rich people from Hollywood think Utah looks like.\n\nMove east from Park City’s resorts and celebrity interlopers and you’ll see the region stays beautifully green and blue in Wasatch Back reservoirs and on the north face of the Uintas.\n\nHike, bike, ski, boat, fish, 4x4, or (watch someone else) ride a bull in northern Utah’s version of the wild west.\n\nKey Locations\n\nPark City Mountain & Deer Valley Ski Resorts\n\nPark City\n\nHeber City\n\nDeer Creek, Jordanelle, Rockport, Echo & Strawberry Reservoirs\n\nHeber Valley Railroad\n\nUtah Olympic Park\n\nUinta Mountains\n\n​Find out how to get there, what to see, and where to stay. ->\n\nUnder the Notch Region\n\nWhere the blues and greens of the Rocky Mountains meet the reds, oranges, pinks, and yellows of the Colorado Plateau — Flaming Gorge isn't even trying not to show off — plus the oil, canyons, and fossils of Dinosaurland just outside Vernal. It's no wonder John Wesley Powell wanted to visit.\n\nKey Locations\n\nFlaming Gorge\n\nVernal\n\nDinosaur National Monument\n\nGreen River\n\nStarvation, Steinaker & Red Fleet Reservoirs\n\n​Find out how to get there, what to see, and where to stay. ->\n\nThe Holey Land\n\nWelcome to The Holey Land, sacred ground for hikers, bikers, off-roaders and river rats. This is where the Colorado Plateau really goes for it, from weird bumps and bulges in the Swell to implausible sandstone sculptures around the Green and Colorado Rivers.\n\nDon’t tell anyone about it. They wouldn’t believe you anyway.\n\nKey Locations\n\nArches National Park\n\nMoab\n\nCanyonlands National Park\n\nCapitol Reef National Park\n\nMoab\n\nGoblin Valley State Park\n\nSan Rafael Swell\n\nDead Horse Point State Park\n\n​Find out how to get there, what to see, and where to stay. ->\n\nATV Country\n\nIs ATV Country the heart of Utah or the gut? We think it’s the heart, pumping adrenaline through its labyrinthine veins.\n\nThe Arapeen and Paiute ATV trail system twists and turns its way across hundreds of thousands of acres of national forests, over mountains and through meadows. Alpine lakes and natural hot springs freckle the evergreen and aspen face.\n\nBring your fishing pole ​and y​our bathing suit.\n\nKey Locations\n\nYuba State Park\n\nRichfield\n\nArapeen ATV Trail\n\nPaiute ATV Trail\n\nSevier River\n\nMarysvale\n\nFishlake National Forest\n\nManti-La Sal National Forest\n\nFremont Indian State Park and Museum\n\n​Find out how to get there, what to see, and where to stay. ->\n\nWest Desert Region\n\nSometimes you just want to load your truck with water, gasoline, and sandwiches and put a little distance between yourself and the rest of humanity.\n\nSatisfy your soul’s itch for solitude in the mettle-testing mountains of the West Desert (and pop over to Great Basin National Park while you’re out … even though it technically sits across the Utah border).\n\nKey Locations\n\nGreat Basin National Park\n\nBeaver\n\nDelta\n\nTushar Mountains\n\nLittle Sahara Recreation Area\n\nEagle Point Ski Resort\n\nSevier Lake\n\nDeep Creek Mountains\n\nFind out how to get there, what to see, and where to stay. ->\n\nRed Rock Region\n\nUtah’s bottom-left (aka the Persian Golf, aka Retirement Desert, aka Virtuous Vegas) sits at the nexus of the Great Basin, the Colorado Plateau, and the Mojave Desert.\n\nIt ranges from hot and low (Beaver Dam Wash is 2,180’) to snowy Brian Head Peak (11,300’).

You may have heard of it.\n\nKey Locations\n\nZion National Park\n\nSt. George\n\nCedar Breaks National Monument\n\nSnow Canyon State Park\n\nBrian Head Ski Resort\n\nFind out how to get there, what to see, and where to stay. ->\n\nUtah's Outback Region\n\nVying with its neighbors to the north and east for Remotest in UtahTM. Kanab (pop. 5k) is the biggest city and the hub for all the state and national parks, monuments, etc.\n\nThe area is also known for its concentration of drop-your-jaw, suck-in-your-gut slot canyons.\n\nKey Locations\n\nLake Powell\n\nKanab\n\nGrand Staircase-Escalante National Monument\n\nBryce Canyon National Park\n\nGrand Canyon National Park\n\nHighway 12\n\nFind out how to get there, what to see, and where to stay. ->\n\nMonument Corner Region\n\nMonument Corner covers nine percent of the state, 0.5% of its population — but that’s due to a shortage of water, not scenery.\n\nResidents are almost outnumbered by four national monuments, a national park, and a handful of state parks and museums. And it’s all within a few hours’ drive of the historic city of Blanding.\n\nKey Locations\n\nMonument Valley\n\nBlanding\n\nCanyonlands National Park\n\nBears Ears\n\nHovenweep National Monument\n\nFour Corners\n\nCliff dwellings\n\nFind out how to get there, what to see, and where to stay. ->"
