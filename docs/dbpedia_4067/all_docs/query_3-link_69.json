        "text": "Share with your crew\n\nUtah is the winter wonderland to beat them all. A true bucket list destination, there’s breathtaking scenery to enjoy around every corner, plenty of ski resorts to choose from, and – the best part – plenty of powder snow to play in.\n\nif you’ve been contemplating a ski and snowboard adventure that ticks all the boxes, bring Utah to the top of the list.\n\nHere are 10 reasons why we adore it, and why you will too.\n\n1. Greatest Snow on Earth – really\n\nUtah is so confident about the quality of their snow, they trademarked it. They’ve been scientifically proven to have The Greatest Snow on Earth®.\n\nEach season sees over 13 metres of light, dry, fluffy, blower powder every year, with a record-breaking 23 metres falling over the recent 2022-23 Northern Hemisphere season.\n\n2. Easy accessibility\n\nUtah is easily accessible from Australia. Connect directly to Salt Lake City International Airport by flying via Los Angeles or San Francisco.\n\nOnce you arrive in town, there are no less than 10 resorts within an hour’s drive of the city. If you’re in a serious rush to stretch those legs after a long flight, you can even be on the slopes in as little as 30 minutes.\n\n3. Experience Salt Lake City\n\nDon’t go rushing out of town too quickly. As the capital of Utah, Salt Lake City is the perfect urban basecamp for skiers and snowboarders who want to combine adventure with their city delights.\n\nExplore the rich history and culture of the area at museums and galleries, sample delicious cuisine at local restaurants, or enjoy a night out on a brewery tour. When not discovering the nearby ski resorts, you can go snowmobiling, snowshoeing, ice skating, or even take a hot air balloon ride.\n\n4. Take advantage of the Ski Super Pass\n\nFor those who want to experience multiple resorts, Salt Lake Ski Super Pass is one of the best deals to be found in the ski world. Explore Alta, Snowbird, Brighton and Solitude with the one pass, which can be customised based on your length of stay.\n\nEach resort has its unique features and terrain, from Alta’s steep chutes and deep powder to Brighton’s family-friendly runs and terrain parks. You’ll also get discounts at the rental shop, along with free transportation on ski buses and the TRAX light rail.\n\n5. Ski the biggest resort in the USA\n\nPark City Mountain is home to a massive 7,300 acres of terrain, offering over 330 trails, 43 lifts and six terrain parks, and clocking it in as the biggest ski resort in the country.\n\nIt’s also on the doorstep of Park City, one of the ski towns that put ski towns on the map. With a historic main street that offers 140 dining options and famous Banksy street art, this is the place to wander and see what you discover. Plus it’s a mere 35 minutes from Salt Lake City International Airport.\n\n6. Enjoy the powder at Snowbird and Alta\n\nSnowbird and Alta are neighbouring ski resorts in Little Cottonwood Canyon, known for its snowfall. With 13 metres of snow each year, this is the place to find deep powder. And with different terrain on offer at each, you’ll just have to ski both – Alta is known for cruisy beginner and intermediate terrain, while Snowbird boasts narrower, steeper canyons in the mix.\n\n7. Discover Powder Mountain\n\nWhile you’ll rarely see a lift line at most resorts in Utah, Powder Mountain is even better than most. With the lift ticket numbers capped to 1500 per day, it’ll feel like you have the entire mountain to yourself – and what a mountain it is.\n\nThe views are incredible, the terrain is varied for all levels, the lift tickets are well-priced and the most experienced skiers of the family can supercharge their day with snowcat-assisted laps up to the expert terrain off Lightning Ridge or Raintree.\n\n8. Take in the views of Brian Head\n\nBrian Head is one of the most unique experiences to be enjoyed in Utah, with deep, red rocks scattered among the pristine white snow, thanks to the resort’s location just 90 minutes from the famous Zion and Bryce Canyon National Parks.\n\nBeyond skiing, you’ll also find snowmobiling, ice skating and snowshoeing here. And just five minutes away is the International Dark Sky Park Cedar Breaks National Monument, making for a unique night skiing experience as the stars twinkle overhead.\n\n9. Go luxe in Deer Valley\n\nIf you’re following the luxury crowd, Deer Valley is located in Park City, and known for the extra little touches – including ski valets, free hot chocolates, and ski-in ski-out après at the Stein Eriksen Lodge or special yurts. They even serve complimentary s’mores by the fire pits every afternoon at Montage Deer Valley, with a variety of toppings available.\n\nAs for the skiing, it also happens to be world-class, with 2000 acres of terrain, six bowls and 103 runs accessed by 21 chairlifts.\n\n10. Adventure through Heber Valley\n\nLess than 30 minutes from Park City, there’s Heber Valley, former site of the 2002 Winter Olympics biathlon and cross-country ski events.\n\nIt’s now become a stomping ground for family-friendly adventures, offering snowshoeing, snowmobiling, skiing, and ice fishing, plus hand-carved ice castles which are created every year by a variety of ice artists.\n\nReady to discover Utah for yourself?\n\nFrom luxury resorts to budget-friendly hotels, there are plenty of accommodation options in Utah, and now’s the time to book for the best deals.\n\nMogul Ski World has a variety of Early Bird Specials, including our pick: stay 7 nights and save 10% at the luxury Snowpine Lodge in Alta, with ski-in/ski-out access and complimentary shuttle services to Snowbird Resort. From $7140 for travel dates in January 2024.\n\nFor other Early Bird Specials and to book your 23/24 snow holiday to Utah, reach out to the snow travel experts at Mogul Ski World.\n\nYou can also RSVP for their International Snow Travel Show on May 23, where you can learn more about skiing and snowboarding in Utah and other amazing destinations around the world.
