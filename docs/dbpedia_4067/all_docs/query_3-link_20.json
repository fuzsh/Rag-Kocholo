        "text": "Where to Paddle Board in Utah\n\nMountainous, rough and ready – Utah is known for its deserts and sand dunes, luscious pine forests in mountain valleys. But what about water spaces for an epic paddle board session?\n\nBryce Canyon and Arches National Park may be famous for hiking and mountain biking, but let’s turn the attention to the idyllic and undiscovered lakes and rivers, perfect for paddle boarding.\n\nYes, that’s right. Even landlocked Utah has some of the most beautiful places to paddle board!\n\nImagine discovering breathtaking destinations in nature with almost no crowds. Well, that dream is a reality when you paddle board Utah. There are so many incredible places to paddle board in Utah just outside Salt Lake City, and further afield too.\n\nWith a similar landscape to Colorado and Arizona, paddle boarding just over the state border in Utah makes sense. Lake Powell is the most well-known spot in the Beehive State, but trust us, there are plenty more to paddle. So make sure you add these picturesque water spots to your paddle boarding hitlist!\n\nPaddle Boarding Northern Utah\n\nMountains, lakes, and reservoirs. Native American heritage and Utah's biggest cities. Northern Utah is often referred to as the “Mormon Country” and is a great place to set up base camp for great outdoor adventures.\n\nGreat Salt Lake\n\nNamed after Utah’s capital, Salt Lake City, is the largest salt lake in the Western Hemisphere. Great Salt Lake is the perfect place for beginners to learn how to paddle board. It’s calm and sheltered, providing the best conditions for finding balance and practicing technique.\n\nGreat Salt Lake is also one of the most beautiful places to paddle board in Utah. As the name suggests, there is a high concentration of salt in the water – far more than in the ocean. This gives an even greater buoyancy and also creates a unique surface for reflecting light.\n\nNature lovers and anyone looking for a romantic paddle boarding session should hit up Great Salt Lake at sunset for the most incredible light show. The colors in the water are unreal!\n\nTop tip: always remember to wash your SUP gear thoroughly after paddling here to avoid the salt causing damage to seams and materials.\n\nPineview Reservoir\n\nCalling all SUP fishing lovers! Grab your rods and cast a line over at Pineview Reservoir. These waters are insanely fertile with the elusive tiger muskie, small and largemouth bass, bluegill, perch and crappie, rainbows, browns, cutthroat, and tiger trout, among others.\n\nStart paddling in the early morning for the best conditions and to avoid the afternoon winds. There are a number of sandy beaches along the reservoir that are ideal to launch a stand up paddle board from.\n\nTo make the most out of the flat water and peaceful landscapes, use a SUP anchor to secure your position in the water. You’ll also need to get yourself a reliable and resourceful fishing life jacket for the trip.\n\nOther Northern Utah Spots For Paddle Boarding\n\nCheck out these equally amazing places for paddle boarding in Northern Utah:\n\nBear Lake – turquoise waters, rich in minerals, family friendly sandy beaches on the shore\n\nCausey Reservoir– near to Huntsville on the South Fork of the Ogden River, nestled in a steep valley terrain\n\nTony Grove Lake – beautiful alpine lake, easy hiking trails, and breathtaking flowers in July and August\n\nBountiful Lake– great for afternoon picnics and family fun\n\nPaddle Boarding North East Utah\n\nRemote and rural. North East Utah is a high-wilderness terrain, most of which is more than a mile above sea level. But, that doesn’t mean there aren’t epic bodies of water to discover by stand up paddle board.\n\nProvo River\n\nProvo River is a popular swim spot in Utah. It sets course from the Uinta Mountains at Wall Lake and runs about 71 miles southwest to Utah Lake at the city of Provo, Utah. But we’re just going to focus on the lower section of the river.\n\nAccess the water from Deer Creek Dam and paddle down for approximately 6 miles, taking 1.5 hours, to exit at Vivian Park. You’ll come across small rapids and gentle whitewater. Obviously these sections can become more difficult after heavy rainfall.\n\nThis spot is best left to the more experienced paddlers who can handle choppy conditions and fast-moving currents. Provo River has a rocky riverbed.\n\nSo, we also recommend using inflatable paddle boards with a strong and durable military-grade PVC bottom to withstand being bashed on rough terrain. The GILI Adventure Inflatable Paddle Board is ideal for taking on adventures down Provo River!\n\nJordanelle Reservoir\n\nLocated 40-minutes out of Salt Lake City by car is Jordanelle Reservoir. This is a popular choice for water sports enthusiasts and weekend getaways from the city. Maybe hit this spot up mid-week if you want some less crowded paddling.\n\nThe reservoir is a 10.5-mile-long body of water that can get busy with boats, jet-skis, and other paddle boarders in peak seasons. So if you’re a beginner still learning the ropes, just be wary of your surroundings and keep your safety as a number one priority.\n\nMornings lend to calmer waters, and less of a crowd. We highly recommend taking your pup for a SUP paddle here. Just imagine, gliding along the peaceful waters of Jordanelle Reservoir with your best friend onboard with you… It doesn’t get much better than that!\n\nMirror Lake\n\nMirror Lake is one of Utah’s most dreamy destinations. With the Uinta Mountains in the backdrop, rising 10,050 feet, this lake is an epic spot for weekends of adventures. Pack the SUP and your hiking gear – you’re in for a real treat here!\n\nAs the name suggests, surrounding mountains and pine forests are reflected on the water like a mirror. Without a doubt, this is one of the most breathtaking places to paddle board Utah. So remember to bring a camera with you!\n\nFishing is also allowed here, so be sure to pack your fishing iSUP . You’ll find various species of trout in the water including rainbow, brook, and tiger.\n\nTo make the most out of Mirror Lake, opt for an inflatable paddle board. The portability and freedom will make this adventure so much easier. Hike up through the forest, inflate lakeside, and hit the Mirror Lake water.\n\nOther North East Utah Spots To Check Out\n\nIt doesn’t stop there.

The average water temperature is 75ºF – refreshing if you fall in on the warmer summer days.\n\nThis state park is close to Provo airport.
