The Les Paul Studio 2016 HP combines classic LP sound and looks with modern Gibson technology. Two humbuckers with attitude team up with a premium carved maple top and mahogany body to give you that fat, syrupy roar and sustain for weeks. The modern Soloist neck profile sets a wider playing foundation, perfect for fast playing and frantic fretwork. From Jimmy Page to Slash, generations of guitarists have relied on the Les Paul to deliver their musical message - deliver yours with the Gibson Les Paul Studio 2016 HP solid body electric guitar. The original tuners have been replaced with Grover locking tuners. In good shape with minor player wear on the body and headstock and buckle rash.
