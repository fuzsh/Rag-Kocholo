        "text": "The entire Gibson name in itself is some big elitist thing, so if you're going to buy one, you better get the best. The Studio is to Gibson like the Boxster is to Porsche. For all the posers who buy a Porsche just so they can say they drive one.\n\nI'm only joking. Or am I?!\n\nIf you're going to drop 7-800 I'd probably look at the Agile guitars. They seem to be well respected. I'd probably buy these before a Gibson. In fact, the only Les Paul I want is a Les Paul Custom Lite. They were from the late 80s, a thin les paul, and came in this amazing pink color too. But they usually go from like $1600-2000\n\nCheck out some of these\n\nAgile AL-3200 LPB at RondoMusic.com\n\nAgile AL-3000 2TS Flame Top at RondoMusic.com\n\nI would buy the agile and then put in some new pickups. Just think of it this way... if Gibson is charging a 'reasonable' price for one of their guitars, it must be a piece of crap.\n\nIf you're going to drop 7-800 I'd probably look at the Agile guitars. They seem to be well respected. I'd probably buy these before a Gibson.\n\nI'm confused. Let's assume you can find a LP studio for around $700 on sale (Not unreasonable considering they go for 800 on Musician's Friend). Why would you want to spend $550 on a cheaply made chinese imitation? The thing about Agile guitars is that they're going to need some work put into them to make them great, as with all chinese made guitars. Gibson makes great guitars, and they're all USA made. There are no foreign Gibsons. There are foreign Epiphones, but all \"Gibsons\" are USA made. I've read reviews about Agile guitars and most seem to indicate that the guitars are \"ok\" for the money, but nothing to shout to the sky about. Gibson also stands behind their products. I bought a cheap Epiphone that was on sale a few years back, and when I discovered that a few frets were off, Gibson paid for a tech to do a fret level, dress, and polish. That's between $100-200 of work on a guitar I got on sale for $180. When is the last time you heard of Fender paying for someone to do a level, dress, and polish on a Squier?\n\nMate theres nothing wrong with LP Studios, but if you want a Gibson Les Paul at a 1/4 of the cost have a look at the Orville By Gibsons, I have just bought 2 from Japan, I put in a set Of Callibrated Bare Knuckle \"The Mules\" in the Honey Burst, and Bare Knuckle Riff Raff in the Bridge, and The Mule in the neck in the Cherry Burst, plus replaced the Electronics, now I have 2 beautiful Guitars as good as any R8 Gibson Les Paul.\n\nOrville by Gibson\n\nOrville by Gibson were the Japanese manufactured Gibson Les Paul, fully approved and authorised by Gibson USA. The Japanese made guitar was actually a closer copy of the 1959 LP than the Gibson USA guitar being produced at that time.\n\nThe Japanese models usually had a long tenon like the 1959 LP's, the US Standard version did not.\n\nThe vast majority of ObG's were made at the Fuji-gen or Terada factory,\n\nThe Orville by Gibson Les Paul Reissue series (LPR ) 1993-1994, were the top of the range Japanese produced Gibsons, they all have stock Gibson USA electrics and pickups, nitrocellulose laquer finishes, blank truss rod covers and fret edge binding, and were only made from late 1992 to early 1995, they also tend to have the fattest necks of all the ObG's. These are rare, and the ObG Reissue flametops are even rarer.\n\nThe Orville by Gibson Les Paul Standard series (LPS) 1988-1993, do not have fret edge binding and have \"Standard\" on the truss rod cover,..but are otherwise identical to the ObG reissues.\n\nThere are some ObG LPS models which were produced in very limited numbers, like the 54 LP (stoptail and P90's), and some Limited Edition runs of (usually) 50 guitars like the LP TV Yellow Junior. There were also a number of limited run series made for large Japanese guitar shops, such as Yamano, these can be spotted by the lack of a pickguard hole as they were ordered with the pickguards off, and are sometimes, but not always, solid flame tops, and one very limited run features solid Flametops, and a one piece back.\n\nThe Limited Edition Guitars usually came with their own hardcase, but all other ObG's were sold with a ObG gigbag, and so as a result ObG Original Hardcases are very rare.\n\nMost of the ObG flametops are laminate, but there are some solid flametop guitars, these are extremely rare.\n\nMost ObG flametops are usually quite understated, and any ObG with a highly flamed or quilted top (the LPQ models) are unusual, and normally veneer. There are some LPQ solid quilted models but again very rare. There were no Orville by Gibson Photo-flame tops.\n\nOrville by Gibson's used the premium wood available to the luthiers.\n\nOrville's have Japanese electrics and Orville P.A.F type pickups, (which are very nice) they are finished in poly not nitro, some Orvilles were issued with Photo-flametops, and K serial numbers were in a different factory to Fuji-gen. its now generally agreed that these were the Terada factory\n\nMost Orville by Gibson and Orville guitars have the long neck tenon which is faithful to the \"holy grail\" 1959 Gibson Les Paul (which is what all these guitars were trying to replicate).\n\nFrom early in 1995, Orville by Gibson was discontinued, and in 1998 Orvilles were rebranded as Epiphone by Gibson (Japan).\n\nThese were only produced for 2 years up to 2000, the Japanese Epiphone's are really Orville's with a different headstock inlay.\n\nThere were no replacements for the Orville by Gibson models, and as such these are becoming very sought after.\n\nSOL Guitars\n\nwww.solguitars.net\n\nI'm confused.

When is the last time you heard of Fender paying for someone to do a level, dress, and polish on a Squier?\n\nI picked up one of Agiles from Rondo, and must say the quality IMO is right up there for a knock off. They are Korean made.\n\nThe only issue I had was some fret buzz at the 14th fret which was taken care of locally with a fret level and polish\n\n(which Kurt at Rondo re embursed me for)\n\nThats an interesting statement. What makes it interesting is that Gibsons in my view and with one or two exceptions are very much yesterday's news when it comes to guitars. I'm saying this as a 40-year gibson owner. Their headstock and heel designs are just lousy, to put it gently. Every time I pick up my SG I'm afraid I'm going to break the darned thing. No guitar should treat you that way.\n\nb.\n\nI agree about that being interesting. The problem occurs much more on Gibsons than it does on Epiphones too--funny that the Chinese Epiphones seem to be much closer to getting it \"right\".\n\nThis reminds me though, the other day while walking around at my local Guitar Center I spotted in their clearance section an Epiphone Les Paul Studio in Alpine White sitting on a stand on the floor. The first thing I noticed about it was a crack all the way across the back of the neck at the base of the headstock. GC knocked a whopping $30 off the price for that. I paid nearly the same price several months back for a Les Paul Studio Deluxe, and mine is the next model up in the Epi LP line and it is pristine.\n\nI agree about that being interesting.

While the Luthier was looking it over we started discussing the issue with Gibson construction in general and headstocks in particular. As it happened he was working on a PRS custom 24 that had taken a ballistic trip from one end of the stage to the other for some obscure reason known only to its owner, landing on the headstock. Believe it or not, the neck, although separated from the body, was intact and I had a chance to inspect the heel joint from the inside. Way deeper than any Gibson i've ever seen. This impact would have completely destroyed a Gibson, with this guitar it was a relatively straightforward neck reset.\n\nI came away from this lesson understanding how much stronger PRS is than Gibson, which is less of a statement on the quality of PRS than how far behind Gibson is from the rest of the world.\n\nB.\n\ni think they are cool and good value. they dont look quite as classy without the binding and without the flame top, but if you want a solid color its not as much a problem.\n\ni like the feel of binding, but my main issue is that i just dont like the 490r/498r combo. the only guitar that has them that i have knowingly played and liked is the faded sg. i dont know why i like that and not the les paul....maybe the body mass creates a little more mud? idk. maybe i just played the sg through a better amp...cant remember. i just know that i dont like those pickups, dont know enough about it to say if a maple top effects the sound that much, and otherwise think they look and play really nice."
