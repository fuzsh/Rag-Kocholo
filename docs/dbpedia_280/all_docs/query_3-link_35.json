        "text": "Django & Les Paul –\n\nHow High the Moon\n\nI 1st heard Django Reinhardt in 1935 when I was in Chicago on the Radio. In those days, we used to have to buy the Records for the Station ourselves. So my friend Harry Zimmerman went over to get the Records one day & he came back and said, “I want you to sit down, because I’ve got 2-Players I want you to hear.”\n\nIt was Django Reinhardt, Stephane Grappelli. I just about went into shock; I’d never heard anything so great – & I didn’t realise he was doing all this with only a couple of Fret fingers!\n\nThen around 1946 I was playing at the Paramount Theatre in New York, and the Stagehand yelled up to the Dressing Room, “There’s a fellow named Django Reinhardt here to see you.” So I said, “Send him up & send Jesus with him” you know, I thought it was a joke. He came upstairs with Johnny Smith & of course I was very surprised. I considered him the greatest Guitar Player around. Django asked for a Pick, so I reached in my pocket & gave him a choice of a whole bunch. He made me feel good, because he picked out the Les Paul Pick & I doubt that he knew it was mine. Johnny Smith grabbed one of my spare Guitars & they started to Jam, and I heard Django play for the 1st time in person. I was very honoured & pleased to have him in the Dressing Room there, playing it. It was a little hard for us to communicate, but we got along fairly well between all of us, we managed to figure out who was saying what.\n\nLater I saw Django on the same Trip with Duke Ellington, in Cleveland Ohio. Throughout his whole Tour, he hadn’t brought his Guitar, so he was playing an Electric Gibson ES-300, and it didn’t do him justice like his own Acoustic Selmer Maccaferri.\n\nThe Paramount Theatre on Times Square opened on 16th November 1926. Today, only the Lobby remains, now gutted, with the Auditorium demolished. Paramount Theatre Lobby was modelled after the Paris Opera House with white marble columns, Balustrades and an opening arms Grand Staircase. Inside, drapes were red velvet, the rugs were a similar red. The Theatre also had a Grand Organ, and an Orchestra Pit that rose up to the Stage level. The ceilings were fresco & gilt. The railings were brass, and the seats plush. There were Greek Statues & Busts in wall niches. The rest rooms & waiting rooms were as grand as any Cathedral. In the main Lobby there was an enormous crystal chandelier. Over the years, many of the top Stars performed there, including Benny Goodman, Harry James, Gene Krupa, Glenn Miller, Frank Sinatra and dozens of the era’s Luminaries. After years of showing movies & shows, the Paramount Theatre was closed on 4th August 1964 with Alan Ladd in “The Carpetbaggers“. The Auditorium was demolished and the entrance & lobby areas were gutted to make way for office & retail space.\n\nThe Paramount Theatre was in a separate building sandwiched between the Paramount Building and the Headquarters of The New York Times, located at 229 West 43rd Street. The Theatre Entrance & Marquee were on the Broadway side of the Paramount Building. After passing through a small lobby, patrons emerged into the Grand Hall, a sumptuous Lobby modelled after the Paris Opera and located on the 43rd Street end of the Theatre building. Measuring 150ft long by 45ft wide by 50ft high, the Grand Hall had a gold domed ceiling that was supported by massive white marble Columns; from the centre of the Dome hung a bronze & crystal Chandelier. At the West end of the Hall was an elegant marble Staircase that widened as it ascended to the Mezzanine landings; behind the stairs were elevators to all levels of the Theatre. By day, the Grand Hall was flooded with sunlight from a tremendous glass window along the street side, while at night it was illuminated by hundreds of sparkling electric lights. For those waiting to enter the Theatre, a special Amplification system brought music of the Stage, Organ & Orchestra into the Grand Hall. Overlooking the Grand Hall was the Music Room where patrons could be entertained with Concerts by a String Orchestra & Artists. From theLlobby, one could enter the Hall of Nations to view a collection of 37 stones collected from various parts of the world, and a bronze Bust of Thomas A Edison, the Inventor. In the Basement was a Lounge known and furnished as the Elizabethan Room; from this room one could enter the College Room (men’s smoking), the Chinoiserie (ladies’ smoking), and the Venetian Room (ladies’ cosmetics). Other public rooms were the Peacock Alley, the Club Room, the Hunting Room, the Jade Room, the Powder Box, the Marie Antoinette Room, and the Colonial & Empire Rooms.\n\nThe Paramount Theatre Auditorium was the 1st Movie Palace in New York City designed in the “Chicago Style” with opulent French Renaissance interiors, as compared to the restrained neoclassical Adam & Empire styles employed by Theatre Architect Thomas W Lamb for the nearby Strand, Capitol & Loew’s State Theatres. The Auditorium was decorated with a colour scheme of ivory, rose-red & turquoise blue. Indirect lighting in 3 colours was installed around the Proscenium Facia, Organ Grille Frames, the soffit of the Balcony, and the main Ceiling, supplemented by bronze crystal fixtures that hung from the Ceiling along the side walls. The Orchestra Pit, designed to hold 70 players, could be raised and lowered on an elevator, and its platform could be automatically rolled onto the Stage. The Organ Console was on its own elevator at the left side of the Orchestra Pit.\n\nDespite its 3,664-seats, the Auditorium was quite narrow & had only 4-Sections of Seats on the Main Floor, with additional Seating in the Mezzanine Boxes & Balcony. The narrow stage opening proved to be problematic over the years: when the wide-screen era arrived, some of the Proscenium had to be removed to accommodate the larger Screen.\n\nHow did you meet Django Reinhardt?\n\n“I was at the Paramount Theatre, and the doorman downstairs yelled out: ‘Les, you have a visitor down here, name of Django Reinhardt.’ I thought he was kidding me, so I yelled back, ‘Well, send up Jesus Christ and a case of Beer!’ Then in walked Django, who didn’t speak a word of English. I had a couple of Guitars in the room, so we just started playing together. We played very similar, which makes it easy for one Guitarist to know what the other is doing.\n\n“He was Touring with Duke Ellington and I was with Fred Waring, so our paths often crossed. Django would come over & we’d talk mostly about the people we learned from. He learned from an old Spanish Gypsy fellow who hung around the fire at the encampments where he spent most of his youth, and he developed his down-stroking style.”\n\nLes – When he got back home to Paris, he began to change his Style, because he heard our way of playing over here. He even started playing my Choruses & those of other Guitarists here in the States. I told him he should never copy us, because we were Copying him! Django had Recorded a Copy of my version of “Brazil” and also “How High The Moon.” But he was totally confused with the Electric Guitar; it was a real opponent to him, because he used a very stiff Pick & was a down-Picker.\n\nThen in 1951, I landed in Paris and found Stephane Grappelli playing Piano in a little Bar. Stephane said, “If you find Django I’ll be surprised, because I haven’t seen him in 2-yrs.” So I gave $40.00, 2-$20.00 bills, to 2 Cab-drivers but I tore them in half. I said, “You get the other half when you find Django.” The next morning, Django called me from South France, & he was there the next day with me. We went to a Music Store & jammed & he picked out a Selmer Maccaferri Guitar for me with an Amplifier & a Pick-up. He told me he was very depressed. He’d gone down to the Gypsy Camp to fish & goof off, because the people were not accepting him. The Club Owners would say, “I’ll hire you for $5 Tonight, but the 1st time you leave that Nelody you’re going to be right out in the Street.” So I talked him into playing again.\n\nWere you close?\n\n“I loved him as a Person & as a Player. We were very good friends, but we actually talked more than we Jammed. During the War, he Recorded from Europe & I Recorded from the States. It’s a shame that we never sat in a Recording Studio together, it really is.”\n\nWho would you say were the Greatest Musicians that you ever played with?\n\n“I’d say Django & Art Tatum. I lived with Art. He was the King… He had so much Technique. Sometimes I’d see him Play & I had to walk out of the Club – he was just too much. I couldn’t digest that much goodness. Django was spectacular. He had this incredible, natural fire & a heart of Gold. He had this Technique, but he played with Soul too. I believe Django represented the biggest change in our times in terms of Guitar Playing.\n\nYou advised him not to switch from Acoustic to Electric Guitar, didn’t you?\n\n“The biggest mistake Django made was not coming over to the States with his own Musicians. In fact, he didn’t even bring a Guitar or a Pick, because he thought they would have better things here. When he played with Ellington’s Band, they did not play the right kind of Rhythm for him. He decided to change from Acoustic to Electric when he got back from the States in 1946. I advised him not to do it. He would have been better off staying with his own unique style than trying to compete with Bebop. The truth is, Django didn’t know what he had.\n\nThe last time I saw Django alive, we were riding in the back seat of a Taxi & he tapped me on the shoulder and asked me if I could read Music. I said, no, I didn’t, and he laughed ’till he was crying & said, “Well, I can’t read either. I don’t even know what a C is; I just play them.” I talked to Django at length about his Fingers. And they were open wounds. He’d soften them with Powder. ‘Till the day he died, those Wounds never healed. When he got depressed he’d ask me, “Am I good?” I said, “I think you’re the Greatest.” “Well, why is it I’m not accepted?” He couldn’t understand why. I told him, “When I was in Chicago, I got a Violin, a Bass, and another Guitarist, and proceeded to copy Django Reinhardt & Stephane Grappelli; I idolise you so much.” I Ranked Django then & I Rank him now, like [Pianist] Art Tatum & [Tenor Saxophonists] Lester Young & Coleman Hawkins, all the Greats. When they died, they just closed the Coffin; they just took it with them. They are probably the Masters & always will be. Though today we find many more talented Guitar Players, we still don’t find any greater Guitar Players than the Master. Oscar Peterson can become so Great on the Piano, but he still talks about Art Tatum as being Greater.\n\nIn the early-50s, Epiphone’s former Champion and favorite late-night Tinkerer Les Paul became a household name with Television & Radio shows & chart-topping hits; all played with his Signature Gibson. But long before that, back in 1939, Les had developed his famous “Log” prototype – arguably the 1st-ever Solidbody Electric Spanish Guitar – at the Epiphone Factory, using some Epiphone Parts, including a Neck. Later, to make it more aesthetically palatable to his Audience, he added “Wings” from an Epiphone Archtop Body that had been sawn in half & attached to either side of the solid Pine Batten Centre Section.\n\nLes had taken this design to Gibson’s Ted McCarty as early as 1941, but it wasn’t until Fender brought the Esquire & Broadcaster to Market in 1950 that McCarty made Les Paul Gibson’s 1st Solidbody Electric Guitar endorser. Still, there’s an argument that the 1st-ever Solidbody Electric Guitar as we know it today was an Epiphone Instrument and that the Log’s Design was a precursor to the Gibson ES-335 & its 4″ square Centrerblock Construction – detachable chambers on both sides\n\nToday, with Guitar players who are real Superstars, one will have the Technique but no Feeling, one can pick Fast but can’t play Slow, the other is Slow but doesn’t have any Speed, another won’t have the fire of Django. Reindhardt’s probably the only one who had most of this together. If you stop and think, when we were kids we had a choice of only Eddie Lang, Dick McDonough & Carl Kress (Below) & then the air got very thin there wasn’t anybody around. Nowadays there are a Million Guitar players & the calibre has improved, but the Geniuses still remain few – Guitarists who can make the Instrument talk. You can turn on the washing machine if you want to hear Technical things. It’s hard to beat a Rhythm Master, but it has no feeling. The 3rd time I went to Paris to see Django, he had just died. His wife had None of his Records, no Phonograph, no Running water, No Electricity, nothing!\n\nSo we went out & Bought a Gravestone for him & clothes for her & a Phonograph & all the Recordings of Django we could find. Then I asked her if it was okay for me to get her some money & she said she’d be very happy. So I called a Publishing Firm & the Record Companies, and said, “Look, I’m taking over his Catalogue & we want to send in an Accountant to check it out.” This scared a lot of them right out of their Shoes. They made a Settlement for $10,000 with his Wife.\n\nI was only around Django some 4 different times, but each time we spent a lot of time together – days & weeks. He was a very sweet man; he loved to laugh. We were very close and had a great admiration for each other.\n\nLes Paul pioneered the development of Multitrack Recording & is credited with having invented the 1st 8-Track Tape Recorder & the Technique of Overdubbing. Paul bought the 1st Ampex 8-track Recorder in 1957. Rein Narma built a custom 8-channel mixing Console for him. The mixing Board included in-line Equalization & Vibrato effects. He named the Recorder “The Octopus” & the Mixing Console “The Monster“. The name “Octopus” was inspired by Comedian W C Fields who was the 1st person Paul played his multi-tracked Guitar experiments to. “He came to my Garage to make a little Record (in 1946),” Les recalled. “I played him the acetate of ‘Lover‘ that I’d done. When he heard it, he said, ‘My boy, you sound like an Octopus.” Les Paul Trio – Dark Eyes\n\nW C. Fields recorded monologues with music over 60 years ago & who better to accompany the genius of enunciation than that Master of the Guitar – Les Paul? Someone wanted to get Fields on Wax if it was the last thing he did -& it was. In 1936, The Great Man had health problems that left him with radio as his only option, delighting fans with his unique voice & cadence. He eventually was well enough to make movies again, but by 1946 alcohol & aging had sent him to a Sanitorium.\n\nHoping to keep his Spirits up (no, not spiritus fermenti), Fields’ friend Bill Morrow arranged for a visit to Les Paul’s new home recording studio. On a hot day in July, hobbling on a cane, and wearing shoes split open to ease the pain in his badly swollen feet, Fields made his appearance. He eyed the way Les Paul was fiddling around amid Double-track Equipment & Control Boards & called him an “Octopus.” Paul was amused & named his new machine OCT, short for Octopus. Soon after, the recording Genius expanded his Studio to include a true “Octopus,” a pioneering 8-track Tape Recorder.\n\nFields drank some Booze & Squinted at the familiar lines he’d performed on Radio, but his deteriorating eyesight & very pickled gray matter, made Recording impossible. The lines had to be literally re-written, LARGE, on a Set of Cards, so he could handle the strain. Uncle Bill’s Sight-reading errors could be funny in front of an Audience, but not on Disc. On Radio, he once delivered a Boozy version of “The Temperance Lecture” fumbling “Pocket-Picking School” into “Picket-Pocking School.” The line “I stumbled across a case of Bourbon,” got mangled enough for him to chuckle & say “I stumbled across that…” Thanks to the Huge cards, Fields was able to get through the Session, one that was such a dim memory that Les Paul couldn’t recall who the Pianist was on “Temperance Lecture,” or the names of the Actor and Actress who helped out in the “Day I Drank a Glass of Water” Sketch (for which he ad-libbed Guitar accompaniment).\n\nThe most exhaustive recent Biography of Fields, by James Curtis (2003) digs up a lot of obscure information on Fields, but there are some errors, or at least, some fuzzy recollections, including Les Paul “strumming the Guitar” on “The Temperance Lecture,” when the background was Piano. Guitar was only on “The Day I Drank a Glass of Water.” Curtis doesn’t mention the two supporting players in that routine. Curtis did affirm that Les Paul handled all the Recording & “Set the Level, dropped the needle down, ran back into the Studio & started to Record” because “Nobody else was Engineering that day.”"
