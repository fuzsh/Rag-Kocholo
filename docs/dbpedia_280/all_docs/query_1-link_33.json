        "text": "Description\n\nEpiphone and Trivium’s Matt Heafy present the Ltd. Ed. Matt Heafy Les Paul Custom and the Ltd. Ed. Matt Heafy Les Paul Custom-7 seven-string, two new and totally killer original takes on the world famous Les Paul. Designed in close collaboration with Matt Heafy, each Ltd. Ed. Matt Heafy Les Paul Custom reflects Heafy’s distinctive approach to guitar, which has earned him and Trivium scores of dedicated fans around the world. Trivium’s records have sold over a million copies worldwide. Check out a Trivium performance and you’ll see why. The rule books on how-to-play a Les Paul go right out the window when Heafy plugs in and his revolutionary use of an LP Custom seven-string is a breakthrough in contemporary metal and hard rock. Now, Matt Heafy joins an illustrious group of Epiphone artists like Slash, Frank Iero, Joe Bonamassa, and Zakk Wylde with the introduction of two signature models, the Epiphone Ltd. Ed. Matt Heafy Les Paul Custom and the Ltd. Ed. Matt Heafy Les Paul Custom-7.\n\nComfortable SlimTaper Profile\n\nThe smooth mahogany neck is designed with a classic 1960s SlimTaper neck profile, featuring a comfortable ‘’D’’ shape to provide an enhanced playing experience. Originally introduced and made famous by many 1960s era, Kalamazoo-made, Gibson and Epiphone guitars, the profile is designed with the perfect thickness for a stable neck and a comfortably, speedy performance. The neck is coupled with a white phenolic fingerboard, offering an incredibly sleek feel perfect for bends and slides.\n\nLockTone Tune-O-Matic Bridge\n\nTune-O-Matic bridges are an extremely popular fixed bridge type due to their stability, reliability, comfortable playing position, and impressive sustain. Unlike other systems that require tools to adjust and remove, the LockTone bridge automatically locks the tune-o-matic and the stopbar onto their posts for added security and improved sustain. Overall, this modern innovation will provide optimum reliability and ease-of-play, perfect for gigging musicians.\n\nEMG 85\n\nThe 85 is one of EMGs first pickups and is the slightly more sophisticated and well rounded half of its famous brother, the 81. Featuring close aperture coils loaded with Alnico V magnets, the 85 is a powerful guitar pickup with exceptional tone and versatility. The Alnico magnets of this model provide a muscular growl and smooth lead tones enabling you to play everything from the blues to the most extreme metal. Although often used in the neck position, make no mistake, the EMG 85 sounds great as a bridge humbucker thanks to its exceptional smoothness and soul. This pickup pairs well with just about every other EMG humbucker.\n\nEMG 81\n\nOne of the most popular EMG’s, the 81 is the one that started a revolution. Utilizing powerful ceramic magnets and close aperture coils, the tone was designed with detailed intensity, incredible amounts of high end cut, and fluid sustain. Traditionally used in the bridge position of your guitar, this humbucking pickup will make your leads slice right through even the densest mix. When used in both neck and bridge positions the sound can only be described as blistering.\n\nMATT HEAFY\n\nMatthew Kiichi Heafy is a Japanese-born American musician best known as the guitarist and lead vocalist for the American heavy metal band Trivium. Heafy is also the lead vocalist for the band Capharnaum, along with Trivium’s former producer Jason Suecof. He is also an avid gamer and practitioner of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. Heafy streams daily on his Twitch channel matthewkheafy playing video games, doing guitar clinics, vocal warm ups and showcasing his Brazilian jiu-jitsu classes."
