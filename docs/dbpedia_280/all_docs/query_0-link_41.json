        "text": "A 1981 Gibson Les Paul Custom that once belonged to Les Paul himself has been listed on Reverb.\n\nThe guitar – which currently boasts an asking price of £11,000/$13,953 – features a mahogany body, three-piece maple neck with a set neck design and unorthodox 22-fret maple fingerboard, as well as a stopbar tailpiece and a double-humbucker pickup configuration.\n\nREAD MORE: John Mayer dusts off famed black Fender Strat for the first time in four years\n\nFurther specs include a 24.75” scale length, 1.6875” nut width, 12” fretboard radius and a weight of 5.16kg.\n\nAdditionally, the guitar comes with a new unused black pickguard with the original cellophane still on.\n\nAs Reverb explains, in the summer of 2012, this guitar, along with several other instruments and pieces of studio gear owned by Les Paul, were sold by auction house Julien’s. Other pieces of equipment in the lot included a 1951 Fender Nocaster, 1927 Gibson L-5, and a 16-track API console.\n\nTo find out more, or if you’re fortunate enough to be in a position to place a bid, head to Reverb.\n\nReverb continues to be a bountiful place for those looking to get their hands on gear used by their heroes.\n\nBack in July, Muse announced plans to sell a trove of their used gear on the online marketplace, featuring a collection of nearly 100 instruments, combo amps, effects pedals and more."
