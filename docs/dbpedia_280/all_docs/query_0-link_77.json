        "text": "I heard he got his Phoenix back after it was lost in a plane crash , he thought it had burned up , but someone got it and never returned it until years later , I think Gibson rebuilt it for him.\n\nYes, that's very true. He has told that story in many, many interviews. He had previously worked with Tom Holmes on pickups while the Phenix was missing. And while Gibson worked to get it playable for him again, he put Tom's pickups in it, and they're still in it today, according to some interviews he has given.\n\nThis is the story of the guitar from Peter's own YouTube channel.\n\nI’m not a tone chaser, nor do I try to emulate my geetar hero’s, but I have accumulated a couple signature geetars…\n\nSometimes I wasn’t even sure who the artist was/is but the guitar has the features I want…\n\nI didn’t realize how many I have/have had…\n\nwhat do you have tucked away?\n\nFirst and foremost I have a Yngwie Malmsteen strat, I am really not a fan of strats, but this one is too cool not to have..\n\none of my most favorite and most played geetars.. Joe Strummer Tele\n\nBonamassa Firebird..\n\nJeff Beck unofficial sig models..\n\n89 Charvel Spectrum..\n\nJackson SLX4 (spectrum replica)\n\n93 strat plus (no longer own) not a strat fan..\n\nJoan Jett Olympic… just love DC geetars..\n\nJared James Nichols LP and the Gibson BFG was inspired by a Gary Moore sig model.. didn’t know who JJN was when I decided to get one… I know who Gary Moore is..\n\nI no longer have these…\n\nJustin Meldal-Johnsen Mustang bass.. not a 7ender bass fan..\n\nSting Signature Precision Bass, again, not a fan of 7ender style basses, but this one made me appreciate the single coil pbass pickup..\n\nFrank Iero Wilshire, I have always wanted a Wilshire, but prefer the early version with the shorter top horn… another instance of not knowing who the artist is/was\n\nBuck Owens tele, and a custom job inspired by it\n\nBonamassa Amos, didnt gel with it and sold it to a friend\n\nTony Franklin Pbass, probably the finest built instrument I have ever held, but don’t get along with 7enders…\n\nGreat thread! Signature models are not my thing; however, if I were to get one, this would be it:\n\nLPCAxALRby--epiphone-alex-lifeson-les-paul-custom-axcess-electric-guitar-ruby\n\nAlex is my favorite guitar player and this one seems quite well made and versatile. Needless to say, I should have purchased the Gibson version when it came out, because the prices are now absurd:\n\nGibson Custom Shop Alex Lifeson Les Paul Axcess | Reverb\n\nThe Gibson Les Paul Axcess Alex Lifeson is a Custom Shop model built to the specs of the Rush guitarist. It features push-pull volume pots and a Floyd Rose style tremolo with exposed humbuckers. The nitrocellulose finish comes in either Royal Crimson or Viceroy Brown Sunburst. The first 25 o...\n\nBut, if I were to get one of these two guitars, my preference would be for the Epiphone, rather than the Gibson. Why? Well, I'm not really a guitar collector; the ones in my stable are the ones used regularly. I wouldn't want to get a guitar just to hang on the wall. These are meant to be played! So the Epiphone would be a rehearsal and gigging guitar, not just a pretty face...\n\nYes, that's very true. He has told that story in many, many interviews. He had previously worked with Tom Holmes on pickups while the Phenix was missing. And while Gibson worked to get it playable for him again, he put Tom's pickups in it, and they're still in it today, according to some interviews he has given.\n\nThis is the story of the guitar from Peter's own YouTube channel.\n\nI heard he uses the standard set-H450-H455 -Alnico 2-in the neck and bridge, and he uses Toms A4-H453, in the middle position.\n\nI had a 59 Burst replica made 9 years ago, and the H450-H455 pickups, will never come out. Ive got 2 more sets that have never been installed, and just got back on Toms waiting list again. 1 year wait. 1st time I waited 20 months, because Tom almost died, and wound very few pickups during that time.\n\nHe used to wind an H453 set, upon request. I think they are something like 7.4k, and both have the same reading. I just may see if he will still wind a set of those, when my # comes up.\n\nGary Moore, also helped Tom work on those pickups, as did Billy Gibbons. Gary Moore, was Toms best friend, is what Tom told me.\n\nGarys Custom Shop Les Paul, had Toms H450-H455, installed from Gibson.\n\nI heard he uses the standard set-H450-H455 -Alnico 2-in the neck and bridge, and he uses Toms A4-H453, in the middle position.\n\nI had a 59 Burst replica made 9 years ago, and the H450-H455 pickups, will never come out.

I have my Frampton with the same H450/H453/H455 set Peter uses, unpotted. I have a beautiful LP Standard T Fireburst with H450/H455 as well. I've thought about ordering more, but haven't.\n\nI also have two Classic Custom's, a 2011 and 2012. They have the '57 Classic's set. They're from before Gibson deviated from Tom's original design he did for them. They are fantastic themselves. So, technically, I would say, I have four Gibson Les Paul's with Tom's pickups. Love them all."
