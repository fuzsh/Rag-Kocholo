        "text": "I'm buying a gibson les paul custom black beauty 1959, and im searching the names of some guitarists that played this instrument on album or concert.\n\nI want to hear the tone on a album studio and in concert.\n\nor if someone owns one , give me your opinions\n\nThanks\n\nNeil Young's famous \"Old Black\" is a Gibson Les Paul. Originally gold and owned by Jim Messina, it was painted black at some point.\n\nBut getting to Neil Young's tone would be complicated:\n\nNeil Young's Equipment »\n\nI prefer him on Gretsch White Falcon used much more rarely (see intro to Ohio). Very low brow description but I prefer my Neil Young guitar on the crunchier side.\n\nJerry Garcia - Very early on.\n\nKeith Richards - '69 tour at times, and off and on at other times.\n\nJimmy Page - Before it got stolen. It was his go to studio guitar before Zeppelin. Gibson made a Page signature guitar of this stolen guitar.\n\nEnjoy your new guitar!\n\nJerry Garcia played one in 67-68, more info here:\n\nJerry Garcia's Goldtop »\n\nIt seems he played it on the \"Two from the Vault\" release, which is a great example of the Dead during their 'hard rock' period. Evidently there was a 3 pickup version as well.\n\nHis best tones were from his modified strat, but the LP custom is not a bad sound.\n\nNot only is that a Les Paul, but it's likely a '57, '58, or '59 sunburst. Looks like a retrofitted pickup in the neck position, possibly a DiMarzio of some sort...either that or the original silver pickup covers were removed...\n\nHopefully, you can play this Les Paul before you buy it...I'm assuming you are going at least 10 or 15 grand in for this baby...\n\nA true '59 is bound to have great tone (re: LEGENDARY TONE), but some Les Pauls don't sound like all of the others. It's a gamble. A Black Beauty might sound different than a '59 'burst Les Paul Standard. You never know until you play it. Here's a video of a sweet '59 BB:\n\nNeil's Les Paul is '53, I believe. Originally a gold top, someone painted it black before it found it's way to Neil in the late '60s. With all of the repair work, it's a 'Frankenstein' of a Les Paul...but that tone..."
