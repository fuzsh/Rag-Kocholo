        "text": "A good question. The only \"younger\" guitarist I remember ist Rich Robinson of the Black Crowes. Although he plays Fender Strat and Tele, he`s mostly seen with a Les Paul or Zemaitis.\n\nMaybe there would be a lot more Les Paul players, if SRV or Hendrix would have played them. Perhaps there will be more players if the message has spread that new LP`s are chambered and don`t weight more than a Strat. ;-)\n\nSad thing...these people have a far higher profile than most of the guitar players mentioned in this thread...\n\nBut out of those, only Madonna actually plays her guitar live, that's the really scary part. The Jonas Bros. don't even have their instruments plugged into anything and when they do, they aren't tuned up. The backing band plays their music.\n\nA good question. The only \"younger\" guitarist I remember ist Rich Robinson of the Black Crowes. Although he plays Fender Strat and Tele, he`s mostly seen with a Les Paul or Zemaitis.\n\nMaybe there would be a lot more Les Paul players, if SRV or Hendrix would have played them. Perhaps there will be more players if the message has spread that new LP`s are chambered and don`t weight more than a Strat. ;-)\n\nits all about the price. I have friends that dont even bother looking at gibson because of that factor alone. you could get a nice strat for about 700/800\n\nwhat kind of tuners are those?\n\nThose are the stock machine heads. They had a crank that flipped out of the end of the tuning button that you could use for faster restringing. When you weren't using them they flipped closed and fit into the end of the tuning key button. He just has his all flipped out in the photo. They were quite trick but I am guessing that they became expensive to produce at the time when you could pick up a cheap plastic stringwinder fro next to nothing.\n\nBut out of those, only Madonna actually plays her guitar live, that's the really scary part. The Jonas Bros. don't even have their instruments plugged into anything and when they do, they aren't tuned up. The backing band plays their music.\n\nSad...but true. But, that's pop music for ya.\n\nEither way.....the problem with most of these guitar players is that as far as mods go, or just general knowledge of who they are, it's sketchy at best, and non-existent at worse.\n\nOn an earlier post...I still think JP is \"the man\", followed by the Rev...and here's why....\n\nAs badass as Doug Aldrich is (as an example)...do you hear a lot of aspiring guitar players discourse \"Aldrich tone?\" Or..wanting to sound like \"Doug Aldrich\"? Or do you get more questions in here about guys trying to get that Page tone? Or do the Page mod? Or, get Gibbons's tone?\n\nI see a lot more of that...even over Slash, or Buckethead, or whatever. And it's multi-generational. He's still the dude that rocks the '59 that everyone wants to sound like.\n\nJP's still the man.\n\nwhat about Marc Ford? not so young... but he keeps doing a good work\n\nSame deal. I've yet to see a thread with anyone asking how to get \"Marc Ford\" tone....\n\nRay Toro & Frank Iero from \"My Chemical Romance\"\n\nSame deal there as well.\n\nThe whole thing about \"carrying the flag\"...\n\nYou have a tone with the Gibson that other people want to COPY...and not just a few people. If you're in that boat, and Gibson's talkin' to ya, then you're probably carrying the flag at that point.\n\nOtherwise?\n\nYou're just playin' one of their guitars.\n\nJust sayin'"
