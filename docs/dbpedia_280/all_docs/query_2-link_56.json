        "text": "The Gibson Les Paul Studio is for the discerning player who is after that iconic Les Paul sound, but isn't concerned with extra frills. Elegant, simple and with an incredible sound, the Les Paul Studio is a fantastic choice.\n\nThe Gibson Les Paul Studio features solid Mahogany, set neck construction, dual humbuckers and pairs of volume and tone controls. It drops the figured Maple top and binding to leave a guitar that is elegant yet utilitarian in appearance. As a result, lots of hard rock and metal guitarists prefer the 'raw power' aesthetic of the Les Paul Studio over the decorative beauty of the Les Paul Standard.\n\nOur Gibson Les Paul Studio guitars come included with a guitar bag.\n\nWhy Should I Choose Gibson Les Paul Studio?"
