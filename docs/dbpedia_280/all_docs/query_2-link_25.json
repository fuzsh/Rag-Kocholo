        "text": "So I ordered mine for £569 instead of £899 from DV247.com. Mines finished in a nice trans wine red nitro. Mines a 2015 model\n\nThe neck is very fast, slightly fatter than I was expecting but I think it is the nicest feeling neck I've played and fits my hand perfectly though the fret board is very wide but after 10 miniutes it feels great especially for bends. The nitro can get kinda sticky on the neck when playing for a long time like 2-3hours. The maple cap has a very nice grain to it and has a slight flame on some parts and others has the nice grain of maple. A very nice top.\n\nThe zero fret brass nut is a very nice feature, I reallly like it though haven't adjusted it because the action out the box was perfect and nice and low. The only thing that wasn't set up nicely was the pick ups. Far too close to the strings and just made everything sound abit muddy and crunchy and not very good really. I have lowered both pick ups and damn they sound excellent. really great sounding pick ups.\n\nThe guitar has a fair weight to it, not sure if it is heavier than my Epiphone Les Paul Custom or not but its pretty heavy none the less. the guitar has excellent sustain and is nice and loud when playing unplugged and has a very nice unplugged tone too which is always something to look out for as its a good pointer to how good a guitar will sound plugged in.\n\nThe case is extremely nice and the handle is set over the body so when carrying it the case sits flat and doesnt try to learn towards the ground which I personally love. the G force robot tuner thing is actually really good. not my type of thing but it is very accurate so I'm unsure if I'll put some klusons on or just leave it as is.\n\nThe strings are 10-46s which are far too light for me (I play 11-52s on les pauls) I'll change them when I can be bothered. This is the first every gibson I have owned and I was worried I'd get a bad one as I was unable to try it in person but this is perfect for and is probably the nicest feeling guitar I've ever played. I highly recommend it. I don't think theres anything I don't like other than the PCB electronics which I'm going to get done by a Gibson dealer because I would rather get it done professionally for a change"
