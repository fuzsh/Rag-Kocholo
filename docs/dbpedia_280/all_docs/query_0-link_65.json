        "text": "Trigger warning // self harm mention , alcohol, cigarettes\n\nAfter two hours of listening to Gerard like he was hypnotized in the studio, it was time for Frank to leave the studio. Since it was their last rehearsal before the concert, they played all the songs they were going to play at least twice without a break. On their latest song, Frank couldn't stand not smoking for hours and went outside the studio to smoke a cigarette. His ears were ringing, but he felt great. Shivering in the cold, he smoked his cigarette quickly, then extinguished it, putting the butt in his pocket because he couldn't find a trash can to throw it away. He already felt guilty enough about the environment for smoking, he didn't want to throw garbage on the floor. Feeling dizzy from smoking too fast and really shaking, he hurried back into the studio. Just as Frank opened the door, everyone was suddenly heading towards the door to get out.\n\n\"Are we leaving?\" Frank asked, putting his hands in his pockets to keep them from getting even colder.\n\n\"Soon, Gerard wanted to play some piano.\" Ray rolled his eyes and stepped outside, lighting his cigarette. Frank didn't want to smoke, nor did he want to stand outside. He timidly entered the studio and saw Gerard sitting at the piano, tapping the keys lightly. Frank sat back on the amp without approaching him, he didn't want to disturb him. He didn't understand why everyone was going out and Ray was rolling his eyes, Gerard was playing so well. This might have been the only thing Tucker was wrong about Gerard. Gerard was transferring his emotions through such beautiful music that he literally turned the songs into lively, soulful individuals. Frank soon realized what Gerard was playing, it was the soundtrack for Schindler's List . It was one of Frank's favorite movies, a song he loved to play on the guitar as well. He tried to remember the last time he played guitar, he hadn't had it since graduating high school. He tried to play the classical guitar in every spare lesson with the sheet music he could find in the music room of the school. He and his music teacher didn't like each other very much, nobody liked Frank very much, but he still didn't mind that Frank came to play the guitar from time to time. Schindler's List was the only classical piece he managed to play from start to finish. He wanted to learn because he was very impressed by the movie, but he wasn't very fond of classical music. He tried to play punk as much as he could with the classical guitar. The fast chords and the rebellious lyrics had something that touched Frank's heart. No matter how many songs and bands he listened to, his interest in punk did not decrease at all.\n\nGerard hadn't even noticed Frank, or so Frank thought. He continued to play without raising his head, Frank's eyes were on Ray's guitar. A black Gibson Les Paul, Frank always loved blues guitars even though he played punk. It was a heavy guitar as far as he knew, a perfect fit for someone as strong as Ray. It was shiny, and the strings were clean. Ray must have been taking good care of his guitar.\n\n\"Do you know how to play?\" Gerard had asked Frank before he stopped playing the piano, and Frank looked up, startled. He must have been staring at the guitar for so long that even Gerard must have noticed.\n\n\"A little.\"\n\n\"Accompany me.\"\n\n\"What?\" Frank was nervous, he hadn't played with anyone, and he wasn't sure he wanted that first person to be Gerard. Gerard looked up, staring at Frank without stopping playing. Frank shyly stood up, frightened to pick up Ray's guitar. After turning on the amp, he pulled up a chair and sat next to Gerard, he had never played guitar while standing and Ray's guitar was really heavy. He had never played an electric guitar in his life, it would take some getting used to since the frets were a little different from the classical guitar. He shifted his watchful gaze to Gerard's hands, and began to play, looking at what note he was playing on the piano. Frank was playing the violin in the song, while Gerard was playing chords that matched the notes Frank played. Getting used to the guitar took a little longer than he thought, the strings seemed to melt between his fingers. Ray's guitar was great, and the tone he set for his guitar on the pedal was also beautiful. It was the most emotional part of the song, but also the hardest part for Frank. In that part of the song where the violin officially cried, the whole orchestra stepped back and gave the stage to the violin, and the violin spoke all its art... Gerard stopped looking at his piano and started to watch Frank's hands. Frank was already nervous, now thoroughly excited, but at the same time relaxed. It was great to make music with Gerard. Frank held out the last note, and Gerard finished the song by making tiny note walks over the last chord he struck on the piano. When the song was over, Frank looked at Gerard, unsure of what to say, a small smile on was Gerard's face. Frank lowered his head without saying a word, feeling great."
