        "text": "Ok, mates...\n\nyou all probably know of my Lester addiction.\n\nI have what I consider my main guitar, the Epiphone Les Paul Standard honeyburst, a 2010 one. Suits me just fine, I use it for most anything, home studies, rehearsals with my band, jams, etc. I must say I'm quite fond of it.\n\nWell, I just crossed a Gibson Les Paul Studio 2014 honeyburst for a VERY good price.\n\nI mean a VERY good bang for the buck (and I've seen and touched the guitar and the papers, it's legit and sold at a nice music store).\n\nI'd normally have bought it first and asked questions later, but right now I just got home and ate dinner without it, because... ...it's a 2014.\n\nDamn, what's with their team this year anyway??? It seems that they1ve decided to make a \"carnival dress\" Les Paul. I don't really dig the 120th anniversary 12th fret inlay, even less the maple neck (which they left unpainted, it is definitely odd, like a strat neck on a gibson les paul)... Those black speed knobs and the dark coloured pickguard and pup rings do put me off as well.\n\nI don't judge guitars for their looks, nor books for their covers, but this is a bit different: the Les Paul is an iconic instrument, not only for what it sounds, but also for its premium finishes and details, and this 2014 one doesn't quite match the traditions.\n\nOk, the bottomline: Yes, I am willing to buy a Gibson Studio (the les paul standard is costing within a range of U$ 7,000 - U$ 13,000, it's punk!), for I am laying seriously with a band. But on the other hand if I am to pay the money, I'd rather get it as nice as it can be, I mean, an old fashioned sunburst studio with everything quite plain... You see, I already own a very beautiful les paul (the epi standard) and it would be a bit odd if I didn't like the gibson studio as much.\n\nSo, has anyone here tested one of these 2014 les pauls yet? How do they sound with that maple neck and weight relief holes plus a set of classic 490r 490t pups? I could use opinions on that before I can make my mind.\n\nYeah, just had enough thought about it. Won't buy it.\n\nI won't pay gibson price for just a pair of 490s.\n\nThe mahogany is much too carved up for weight relief (ok I know les pauls are heavy, but their tone doesn't come for free) and idk about that maple neck, although it looks like some 70s LPs...\n\nDude, I'll tell you what: my Epi may be a bit muddier, idk, but it's a Les Paul.\n\nNow I can answer the jurassic question: are Epiphones real Les Pauls? Well, the good old Epiphone Les Paul Standard sure looks like one. It is a mahogany body, mahogany neck (to hell if the mahogany variety is honduran, african, asian or from Mars) with a pair of alnico humbuckers, grover tuners and top hat knobs.\n\nThat Gibson is too strange. I'm sure it's good, but I don't know if I'd feel the \"les paul mojo\" from it.\n\nI have a 2012 Gibson SG with a maple neck, and I like it a lot.\n\nMine's a silverburst. So the neck is painted black. It gives a fine snappy sound, very SG to my ear. The maple neck is VERY stable, tuning wise, and seems a good\n\ninnovation.\n\nSo I don't think it makes much difference, that neck will likely add something to the\n\ntone of a Les Paul... and really the only question is if you like it or not. I don't own a Les Paul, but I've been tempted by the Studio model... sorely tempted. I saw one for sale used in a music store, and took it down and played it and almost bought it right then. But I resisted, and went home and dreamed about it that night. I came back in a day or two to get it... and of course it was gone. I liked the plain look of it, and the burstbuckers it had sounded great to me. ah well...\n\nI'm not a Les Paul guy. So I'm only mildly interested in the issues people have with them. If I bought one, it would very likely be this:\n\nEpiphone Les Paul Tribute Plus Electric Guitar | Musician's Friend\n\nThis one's got it all, and for a great price. I'd buy a used one and get it set up by a\n\ngreat luthier I know, Dave Collins.\n\nTo me, it comes down to your music. If you can play well, then a $600 Epiphone Lester won't hurt you at all, especially if it's set up properly. If you can't play well, then a $6000 Gibson Lester won't help you much. It will help a little. *shrugs\n\nI bet I've tried at least a dozen LP's over the years, and never found the first one I loved. A few I liked, but no love.... The one pictured above to me looks super cool. It's different, and that I like. What's it feel like though? Close your eyes, and play. Does it lure you in? If so, buy it. If not, PASS! You'll be trying to get rid of it if it doesn't fit you. I've tried to force myself into playing a LP, but so far, no luck. One day, the right one will land in my hands, and it'll be mine, regardless of the headstock."
