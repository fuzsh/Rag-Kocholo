        "text": "Very nice looking guitar I must admit.\n\nBut no tone knob? Hmm hmm hmm...\n\nWhile not a tone knob in the traditional sense, the copy from the press site seems to indicate that there are a lot of tonal possibilities:\n\nAbout the VariTone: The VariToneTM uses a six-way rotary switch which engages 5 pre-set notch filters and a bypass. In position one, the VariToneTM is completely bypassed. As you rotate the rotary switch into positions 2-6, the center frequency of the notch filter shifts from around 1.9kHz down to 130Hz, providing a player with a wide tonal palette unavailable on most other instruments. Positions 2 through 4 offer tonal shaping while still maintaining great clarity.* But keep turning and you&#8217;ll find Positions 5 and 6 shape-shift the Alnico ClassicTM Humbuckers into a single-coil style pickup but without the thin quack usually associated with traditional single coil pickups. Add it all up and between the 6-position VariToneTM circuit and the 3-position toggle switch, you have 18 unique tones available.\n\nFor anyone who's interested, here it is in action\n\nFunny, I actually already have the exact same Planet Waves strap that Iero has on his guitar there.\n\nWhat happened to pansy again? Wasn't there neck issues with it?\n\nBasically he fvcked it up at a gig, and it apparently cannot be used again. I find this sort of hard to believe since I saw a pic of it after the accident and it looked fine.\n\nI think that eventually someone (maybe Frank himself) came out and said that he did it and not a tech.\n\nI can't remember either, I mean that guitar must of went thru a lot considering its when they were on warped tour with probably not the best transportation conditions. I haven't bought a new guitar in awhile, but whenever this hits i'll be picking it up\n\nI tried the price quote just for the heck of it (though I'm in the U.S.A.) and it sent an email telling me that they can't find me in their customer records.\n\nAnyone on the other side of the pond try it?"
