        "text": "The traditional all-Mahogany construction remains intact with Gibson's Les Paul Studio guitars, producing the rich tones that people come to expect from LPs. Equipped with high-output 498T and 490R pickups, these instruments are well-suited for raunchy overdrive. Just engage their push-pull coil-tap functions, though, and you'll attain convincing single-coil tones that sound crystal-clear with clean amp settings."
