        "text": "My '64 actually started out as that, except Cherry Red. I acquired it from a cousin, at a time when there was nothing viewed as \"vintage\", merely 2nd hand and old. These days, it would have been conceived of as \"relic'd\" but back then it was simply chipped. I stripped the finish and painted it..several times. Sadly, my attempts to get the paint still left in the grain has never been quite successful, so I've left it bare. The original dog-ear P90 was given to singer-songwriter-player Marshall Crenshaw, when we met in 1982. I've had a variety of pickup complements over the years, sometimes one, sometimes 2, and sometimes even 3. The electronics have been redone lord knows how many times, and sometimes around 1978 or so, I attempted a refret with heavy-gauge frets to try and stabilize the neck and provide a little more sustain. The current pickups are a MIghty MIte P90 (meh) and a DIY neck pickup with slightly narrower polepiece spacing to compensate for the narrower neck.\n\nIt came with one of these vibrolas, but no arm to wiggle it. I may have noted in another thread that I've been in search of an arm for the unit, but to no avail. When I was in Gruhn's a decade back, I saw a cluster of early '60s Epis and none of the units with vibrolas had the arms or the bracket for the arm that you see on the left. I asked the clerk if they had been removed for security purposes,and he replied \"Nope, they came in that way\". I guess arms falling off was a common problem, and not unique to mine or my cousin's behaviour. Mine is like the one at the bottom, with the bar sticking out and no bracket. I've made one attempt to machine a bracket but it had insufficient grip, Luckily I have more aluminum to work with and will keep attempting. Happily, a variety of arms will actually work with the unit. The bracket itself seems to be the critical element.\n\nI have a BIgsby B5 unit just sitting around and have installed it on the Coronet in past, but it throws the weight balance off, so something smaller and lighter, like this VBM-1-2 vibrola would provide a bit of pitch wiggle and suitable weight.\n\nReading up a bit more on the Frank Iero model, the electronics are intriguing. I hadn't realized it had a built-in kill switch, and that the 6-way rotary was a Vari-tone."
