        "text": "The Gibson Les Paul has stood the test of time as the most recognizable and successful signature guitar model.\n\nThe single-cut, solid body guitar came around as the first era of Rock & Roll was just beginning. Its inventor Lester Polsfuss (Les Paul) became better remembered for his contribution of an instrument than for his Hall of Fame music career after he teamed up with Gibson in 1952.\n\nGibson Les Paul Guitars\n\nGibson’s official website honors its creator and his impact on modern and historical music.\n\n“His legacy endures through each carefully crafted signature model guitar— igniting the imagination, inspiration and innovation of players across the globe.”\n\nModern versions of the guitar include some creative new innovations like lightweight material and other features that help guitarists’ comfortability.\n\nHowever, original models from the 1950s and 1960s now sell at incredible prices as vintage collectable items as a tribute to some of the best rockers in history.\n\nLegendary GLP Guitarists\n\nA long list of Rock & Roll legends have played the GLP at one point or another during their performance careers.\n\nIt’s tough to picture any of Led Zeppelin’s best moments without images flashing through your brain of Jimmy Page holding the iconic model guitar.\n\nLegendary bands like ZZ Top, Rush, Guns N’ Roses, and the Allman Brothers Band have prominently featured artists playing the Gibson Les Paul. Eric Clapton used it with continued success in stints with multiple bands.\n\nBob Marley added some variety by using it during a career that helped shape the reggae genre. In addition, Billie Joe Armstrong has helped the GLP continue its legacy into the modern era during a long run as the front man for Green Day.\n\nPeter Green of Fleetwood Mac, Randy Rhoads of Quiet Riot, and Tom Scholz of Boston helped popularize the Gibson Les Paul throughout the last 70 years, and six Rock & Roll giants have grown it into an unmistakable and iconic brand."
