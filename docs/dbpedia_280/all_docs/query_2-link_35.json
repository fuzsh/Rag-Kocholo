What's Gibson's secret? A major part of the Les Paul's tonewood recipe is the fusion of a maple top on a mahogany body. This combination is largely responsible for the legendary Les Paul sound - as well the LP's reputation for being rather heavy. But fear not! Modern weight relief has been scientifically applied to the Les Paul Studio - giving you all the sustain, without the pain. Now you can play marathon gigs without next-day visits to the chiropractor. The Gibson Les Paul Studio - it's what rock dreams are made of.\n\n'60s Slim Taper neck profile for smooth playability\n\nThe Gibson Les Paul Studio sports a comfortable, fast-action neck with a '60s Slim Taper profile. Early Les Paul guitars had huge \"tree-trunk\" necks, but beginning in 1959, the company began slimming the neck down to a more comfortable size. By 1960, this evolved into a design Gibson called the Slim Taper neck. Varying in thickness only about a tenth of an inch from the first fret out to the twelfth and maintaining a precisely controlled width-to-thickness ratio, the Slim Taper neck promoted playing speed while reducing player fatigue. Many guitarists consider Gibson's Slim Taper neck the most playable Les Paul neck ever made. Whether you're chording down low or riffing up high, the Les Paul Studio's neck - with its slick Granadillo fingerboard and classic trapezoid inlays - always feels just right.\n\nPickups deliver true Les Paul sound - and then some The Les Paul Studio features 490R (rhythm) and 498T (treble) pickups. These \"Modern Classic\" pickups feature tonal characteristics similar to the '57 Classic, but deliver a slight increase in the upper mids, for a more contemporary humbucking sound. But there's more! The volume knobs feature a push-pull configuration that allows you to choose between classic humbucking tones and snappy single-coil sounds.\n\nGibson Les Paul Studio Solidbody Electric Guitar Features:\n\nAffordable USA-made Les Paul with weight-relieved body and flexible electronics\n\nClassic mahogany body and maple top deliver singing sustain\n\nModern weight relief lightens the load without sacrificing tone\n\n'60s Slim Taper neck is made for playing without fatigue\n\n490R and 498T pickups kick out smoky humbucker tones\n\nPush-pull controls allow coil tapping for single-coil spank\n\nTake your tone to new heights with the Gibson Les Paul Studio!"
