        "text": "“Basically when given this opportunity the first thing that came to mind was my dad buying me my first guitar,” he says. “And the reason I got into music was my grandfather and dads played drums and were in bands forever.”\n\nSo, what did his dad say about the Frank Iero Phant-o-matic? “They were like, ‘Are you serious? That’s crazy,'” he says. “My dad was super psyched.” And to pay tribute to his family, Iero is turning the venture into a philanthropic endeavor. “About six years ago my family was affected by multiple sclerosis and that was the first thing that came to mind. The only reason I would be doing this is because of my family, so why not give back?” he says, adding that Epiphone is matching every dollar he gives to MS\n\n“Whether it be writing a new My Chem record or working on a different kind of project, there are a couple of things that are coming in the works,” he says. “But I definitely see new music coming out or at least being worked on throughout the rest of this year and hopefully maybe something coming out by summer.”"
