But what exactly is an Epiphone Les Paul, and why is it so revered by musicians and fans alike?\n\nLet's dive in and explore the world of Epiphone Les Paul guitars!\n\nHOT TIP: Be sure to check out our awesome range of Epiphone Les Paul guitars here if you're looking to buy one, we'd love to help!! Just click here: Epiphone Guitars\n\nThe Epiphone Les Paul range is a type of electric guitar that is modelled off the Gibson Les Paul - and probably one of the coolest things even offers the same line-up at a more affordable price. When Gibson launched the Les Paul Modern, the Epiphone version closely followed. You can even buy an aged 59 Epiphone Les Paul now at a fraction of the price of a Gibbo. How cool is that!\n\nThe Les Paul is, of course, known for its timeless shape, rich tone, legendary heritage, and playability. One thing that often doesn't get mentioned about Les Paul's is just the shape. It fits like a glove for lots of guitarists and is balanced beautifully, especially if you can find a lighter Les Paul. There is no neck dive, it plays beautifully standing or sitting, and even the best rock and metal players, like Kirk Hammet, are massive fans. On that note, the list of guitarists who have made their names in history by using a Les Paul is nothing short of gobsmacking.\n\nThe Epiphone Les Paul Standard '50s is a stunning guitar!\n\nWhen was the Epiphone Les Paul launched?\n\nThe first Epiphone Les Paul was sold in 1989. Epiphone, a brand owned by Gibson, introduced the Les Paul model to their lineup in 1989 as a more affordable alternative to the Gibson Les Paul. The Epiphone Les Paul was designed to offer similar features and aesthetics to the Gibson Les Paul but at a lower price point. But where did the Les Paul name come from?\n\nWell, it is named after its creator, Lester William Polsfuss, who is more famously known as Les Paul. Les Paul was a renowned musician and innovator who made significant contributions to the development of the electric guitar. In the 1940s, he worked with Gibson, a leading guitar manufacturer, to create the first solid-body electric guitar, which eventually became the iconic Gibson Les Paul. However, due to various reasons, including financial constraints, Gibson decided to stop producing the original Les Paul model in the late 1950s.\n\nThat's where Epiphone comes into the picture, and over the years, the Epiphone Les Paul has gained a reputation for its exceptional craftsmanship, playability, and versatility. In 2023, the Epiphone Les Pauls now being produced are up there with the best brands in their price point, like Ibanez, Yamaha, Chapman, Squier Guitars, and entry-level Fender Guitars.\n\nWhat makes the Epiphone Les Paul unique amongst these other brands is the classic dual humbucker pickup design, known for their ability to produce a wide range of tones, from warm and mellow to gritty and aggressive - all without any single coil buzz. This versatility makes the Epiphone Les Paul suitable for various music styles, including rock, metal, blues, jazz, pop, punk, and even funk, country music, and more.\n\nThere's also the new/old Kalamazoo headstock that just looks soo much cleaner and nicer on across various Epiphone Les Paul models!\n\nWho are some famous Epiphone Les Paul players?\n\nIf you're curious about famous musicians who have played the Epiphone Les Paul, you're in for a treat!

Let's dive into why Epiphone Les Paul guitars are considered to be good instruments that are trusted by musicians around the world.\n\nTimeless Design: Epiphone Les Paul guitars are renowned for their iconic design that closely resembles the original Gibson Les Paul models, which is considered one of the most legendary electric guitars of all time. With its classic single-cutaway mahogany body, maple top, and set-neck construction, the Epiphone Les Paul captures the essence of the original design, providing players with an authentic and timeless look.\n\nQuality Yet Affordable Craftsmanship: Epiphone, a subsidiary of Gibson, is known for its commitment to quality craftsmanship. Epiphone Les Paul guitars are built with attention to detail and undergo strict quality control measures to ensure that they meet the high standards set by the brand. The use of quality tonewoods, hardware, and electronics result in guitars that are reliable, durable, and capable of delivering exceptional tones and playability.\n\nVersatile Sound: The Epiphone Les Paul is renowned for its versatile sound, making it suitable for a wide range of music genres. The combination of a mahogany body and maple top, along with the humbucker pickups, delivers a rich and resonant tone with excellent sustain. This allows players to achieve a wide range of tones, from warm and mellow to bright and aggressive, making the Epiphone Les Paul a versatile choice for different playing styles and musical genres.\n\nAffordable Price: One of the best reasons to buy an Epiphone Les Paul guitar is its affordability compared to the Gibson Les Paul models. Epiphone Les Pauls offers a more budget-friendly option without sacrificing quality and performance. This makes them accessible to a wide range of players, from beginners to experienced musicians, who are looking for a high-quality guitar without breaking the bank. In our opinion, the main sacrifice is the Nitro finish that comes on the higher-end Gibsons. It's lovely, and we can't deny it. Saying that Nitro finishes do get damaged more easily, so it's individual for every player.\n\nTrusted by Professional Touring Guitarists: Epiphone Les Paul guitars have been used by numerous professional musicians on stage and in the studio, showcasing their reliability, tone, and playability. Say no more!\n\nLoads of Options: Epiphone Les Paul guitars come in a large range, which we'll cover below. This lets you choose a model for your unique preferences. From different finishes, pickup configurations, and hardware options, you can choose an Epiphone Les Paul guitar model to suit your playing style and tonal preferences.\n\nLooks Cool: In 2023, Epiphone Guitars look as cool as Gibsons, in our opinion, especially with updated the headstock. It's stunning.\n\nEpiphone Les Paul guitars are well-regarded for their authentic design, quality craftsmanship, versatile sound, and affordability, and trusted by professional musicians. With a wide range of models, if you're considering a Les Paul-style guitar, an Epiphone Les Paul is definitely worth considering as a good option that delivers on performance, tone, and value for money.\n\nBelow are the two Epiphone Jerry Cantrell models:\n\nWhere are Epiphone Les Paul guitars made?\n\nWhen looking at \"where\" Epiphone guitars are made, keep one thing in mind: Epiphone is a brand that's owned by Gibson, and they want you to have such a good experience with an Epiphone that you'll one day buy a high-end and more expensive Gibson. It's not in Gibson's best interest to make crap guitars - quite the opposite.\n\nEpiphone, across all models, is known for producing high-quality guitars at various guitar manufacturing plants around the world. The location where Epiphone Les Paul guitars are made depends on the specific model and series. Epiphone Les Paul Standard and Custom Models are primarily manufactured in Epiphone's factory in Qingdao, China. Epiphone Les Paul Studio and Tribute Models can also be made here, while some can be also produced in Indonesia. Either way, Epiphone maintains strict quality control measures to ensure that all guitars meet their standards.\n\nIf you are a strict USA guitar buyer, then, of course, check out the Gibson range - it's all individual and up to your preferences. Personally, we feel the guitars coming out of China and Indonesia today are as good as they have ever been. The QC is now soo good that many guitarists struggle in blind fold tests to tell the difference between a Gibson Les Paul and an Epiphone Les Paul!\n\nDoes Epiphone Les Pauls have the same options as Gibson Les Pauls?\n\nThe answer is yes and no. While Epiphone Les Pauls are designed to be affordable alternatives to Gibson Les Pauls and follow the same model line-up, there are some key differences between the two brands. Let's take a closer look at the similarities first:\n\nSame body shape and similar construction: Both Epiphone and Gibson Les Pauls have a single-cutaway solid body design with a mahogany body and a maple top. This classic construction gives them the iconic Les Paul look and feel. Of course, there are differences here, but for many guitarists, these might not be big enough to justify the price jump to a thicker figured maple top etc.\n\nScale length and neck profile: Both Epiphone and Gibson Les Pauls typically have a 24.75-inch scale length and a set-in mahogany neck with a rosewood fretboard. They also offer similar neck profiles, such as the slim-taper profile, providing a familiar playing experience.\n\nElectronics: Both the Epiphone and Gibson Les Pauls offer a variety of pickup configurations, depending on the model. But they all feature similar control layouts, with two volume and two tone knobs and a 3-way toggle switch. You can seamlessly jump between Epiphone and Gibson Les Pauls and not have to re-learn the controls.\n\nDifferences between Epiphone and Gibson Les Pauls:\n\nOf course, there are differences. For example, Nitro finishes cost way more to apply, so these are reserved for Gibsons. Let's dive a little deeper:\n\nPrice point: Epiphone Les Pauls are designed to be more affordable than Gibson Les Pauls, making them a popular choice for budget-conscious players or beginners. Gibson Les Pauls, on the other hand, are considered high-end guitars with a higher price tag.\n\nBrand name and logo: Gibson is a renowned and prestigious brand with a long history of producing iconic guitars and an even longer list of legendary artists who have used them. Epiphone is Gibson's more affordable subsidiary, so if the Gibson name matters to you, we totally understand. I mean, here at Coleman's Music, most of our staff have a Gibson guitar in their collections - but that doesn't mean we have the nerve to take them to a live gig, that's when an Epiphone shines : )\n\nMaterials and hardware: While both Epiphone and Gibson Les Pauls use mahogany for the body and neck, Gibson Les Pauls are known for using higher-quality tonewoods, glues, pickups, and hardware, which can affect the overall tone and sustain of the guitar. Gibson Les Pauls may also offer more premium features such as top-grade pickups, hardware, and Nitro finishes.\n\nCustomisation options: Gibson Les Pauls can offer more options, depending on the models. This can include different finishes, pickups, and hardware choices. There's also the Gibson Custom Shop, which is not carried across to Epiphone, and that's where the main differences really start to show.\n\nIn Summary, Epiphone Les Pauls shares many similarities with Gibson Les Pauls in terms of design and features, there are differences in terms of price point, brand name, materials, hardware, and customisation options. Epiphone Les Pauls are designed to be more affordable alternatives to Gibson Les Pauls, providing players with a quality instrument at a more budget-friendly price. Both brands offer options that cater to different players' needs and budgets, so whether you're a beginner, an intermediate player, or a professional musician, there is a Les Paul guitar that fits your preferences and budget.\n\nCheck out our Coleman's review of the 2023 Epiphone Les Paul Standard VS GIBSON Les Paul Standard:\n\nSo, which Epiphone Les Paul should I buy?\n\nThis is the age-old question!

Both brands have their unique features and advantages, and the \"better\" option is subjective and highly dependent on your individual requirements. Here's a detailed comparison of Epiphone Les Paul and Gibson Les Paul guitars to help you make an informed decision:\n\nQuality: Gibson is known for its high-end, premium-quality guitars, whereas Epiphone is the more affordable subsidiary brand of Gibson. Gibson Les Paul guitars are typically made with top-grade tonewoods, such as solid mahogany bodies and necks, and high-quality hardware and electronics. Epiphone Les Paul guitars, on the other hand, may use slightly lower-grade tonewoods and hardware to keep the price point more accessible for budget-conscious players.\n\nCraftsmanship: Gibson Les Paul guitars are typically handcrafted in the USA by skilled luthiers, whereas Epiphone Les Paul guitars are made in various locations around the world, including Indonesia and China. However, both brands have strict quality control measures in place to ensure that their guitars meet their respective standards.\n\nFeatures: Gibson Les Paul guitars often come with premium features such as custom pickups, nitrocellulose finishes, and higher-end hardware options, while Epiphone Les Paul guitars may have more standard features. However, Epiphone has also introduced some premium features in their higher-end models, such as ProBucker pickups and coil-splitting options, providing a more versatile and upgraded playing experience.\n\nTone: Both Gibson and Epiphone Les Paul guitars are known for their iconic and distinct tone, characterized by their thick and warm humbucker pickups. However, due to differences in tonewoods, hardware, and electronics, Gibson Les Paul guitars may have a slightly more refined and nuanced tone compared to Epiphone Les Paul guitars. Nevertheless, Epiphone Les Paul guitars still offer a solid and impressive tone that can be suitable for a wide range of musical genres.\n\nPrice: Epiphone Les Paul guitars are usually much more affordable compared to Gibson Les Paul guitars, making them a popular choice for budget-conscious players or those who are just starting out. Gibson Les Paul guitars, on the other hand, are considered premium instruments with a higher price tag due to their craftsmanship, materials, and features.\n\nVersatility: Both Gibson and Epiphone Les Paul guitars are versatile instruments that can handle various musical genres, from blues and rock to jazz and beyond. However, Gibson Les Paul guitars often come with more premium features, such as coil-splitting options or different pickup configurations, which may offer more tonal versatility compared to Epiphone Les Paul guitars.\n\nThe name on the headstock: Gibson is a renowned and established brand with a long history of producing high-quality guitars used by countless legendary musicians. Epiphone, as a subsidiary of Gibson, also has a solid reputation for producing reliable and affordable guitars that are favoured by many players.\n\nIn conclusion, there is no definitive answer as to which brand is \"better\" between Epiphone Les Paul and Gibson Les Paul guitars. It ultimately depends on your budget, preferences, and specific needs as a player.\n\nGibson Les Paul guitars are known for their premium craftsmanship, features, and tonal nuances, but they also come with a higher price tag and that fear that it's too precious to take to a gig. Epiphone Les Paul guitars, on the other hand, offer a more affordable option without compromising on quality and tone. The best thing to do is to try out both brands and models in person to determine which one suits you best in terms of playability, tone, and overall satisfaction.\n\nDo Epiphone Les Paul’s have nitrocellulose finishes? (Nitro finishes)\n\nAs a general rule, and we're trying to think of the exceptions, but no Epiphone Les Paul guitars have nitrocellulose finishes (commonly referred to as \"nitro\"). Nitrocellulose lacquer finishes are known for their vintage vibe, as they were commonly used on classic guitars from the 1950s and 1960s, including Gibson Les Pauls. However, due to the cost and complexity of applying nitro finishes, as well as environmental and durability considerations, most Epiphone Les Paul guitars feature polyurethane or other types of finishes.\n\nWhen it comes to choosing a guitar finish, it's important to consider that while nitro finishes are prized for their authentic, vintage look and feel, they also require more care and maintenance, as they are more susceptible to wear, cracking, aging, and damage from environmental factors like heat changes and UV. Polyurethane finishes, on the other hand, are generally more durable and resistant to wear and tear, making them suitable for players who prioritize long-term durability, that \"new look\", and ease of maintenance.\n\nAt the end of the day, and with the new/old Kalamazoo headstocks on the Epiphone Les Paul's, costs may just be the biggest difference. Some players love the feel of Nitro necks, and some don't and find them too sticky. It's all personal preference.\n\nHow to restring an Epiphone Les Paul\n\nRestringing a guitar can be a straightforward process with a little practice, and restringing an Epiphone Les Paul follows similar steps as restringing other electric stop bar style electric guitars. Here's a step-by-step guide on how you can restring your Epiphone Les Paul - and for a more detailed guitar stringing guide with visuals, just click here.\n\nHOT TIP: Just do one string at a time if you're ever in doubt. Then you can reference the old strings and how they are put on!\n\nGather the necessary tools: You will need a set of new strings, a wire cutter or string winder with a built-in cutter, a guitar tuner, and we'd suggest a cloth for cleaning. If you need any guitar accessories, be sure to check out our awesome range of Guitar Accessories & parts here.\n\nLoosen the old strings: Use the string winder or your fingers to loosen the tension on the old strings by turning the tuning pegs counterclockwise. Once the tension is released, you can unwind the strings from the tuning pegs and remove them from the bridge. If you need strings, be sure to see our huge and affordable range of guitar strings here.\n\nClean the guitar: While the old strings are off, take the opportunity to clean your Epiphone Les Paul. Use a cloth to wipe down the fretboard, body, and other parts of the guitar. A good maintenance kit can do wonders to keep your axe looking new!\n\nInstall new strings: Open your new set of strings and identify which string corresponds to each tuning peg. Starting with the thinnest string (usually the high E string), thread it through the corresponding hole in the bridge and pull it all the way through until the ball end of the string is securely seated against the bridge.\n\nThe tuning pegs: Pull the string across the nut and thread it through the corresponding hole in the tuning peg. Leave enough slack so that you can wind the string around the tuning peg several times. Use a string winder or your fingers to turn the tuning peg clockwise, winding the string until it is tightly secured.\n\nRepeat for all strings: Follow the same steps for the remaining strings, working from the thinnest to the thickest string.\n\nTune and stretch the strings: Once all the strings are attached, use a guitar tuner to tune each string to its correct pitch. After tuning, use your fingers to gently stretch and pull on each string, which helps to settle the strings and minimize the likelihood of them going out of tune quickly.\n\nTrim excess string ends: Use a wire cutter or the built-in cutter on your string winder to trim the excess string ends protruding from the tuning pegs. Be careful to avoid scratching your guitar's finish.\n\nFine-tune and play: After trimming the excess string ends, use your tuner to fine-tune the strings as needed. Once you have achieved the desired tuning, you're ready to play your newly restrung Epiphone Les Paul!\n\nRemember, restringing a guitar may require some practice to get the technique down, so don't be discouraged if it takes a few tries to feel comfortable with the process. Following these steps and taking your time can help ensure that your Epiphone Les Paul is restrung properly, resulting in optimal playability and tone. If you're unsure about any step or need further guidance, it's always recommended to consult with a qualified guitar technician or refer to the manufacturer's instructions. Happy restringing!\n\nI bought an Epiphone Les Paul! Now what’s the best maintenance routine?\n\nAs an Epiphone Les Paul owner, it's important to keep your guitar in top-notch condition to ensure optimal playability, longevity, and tone. Guitars are living, breathing instruments, so regular maintenance and care can go a long way in preserving the beauty and performance of your Epiphone Les Paul. Here are some essential maintenance tips for you to keep in mind:\n\nKeep it clean: Regularly clean your guitar to remove dirt, sweat, and grime that can accumulate on the body, fretboard, and hardware. Use a soft cloth or a guitar cleaning solution that is specifically formulated for guitars to avoid damaging the finish. Don't forget to also clean the strings after playing to remove built-up oils and debris, which can prolong their lifespan.\n\nProtect it from humidity: Epiphone Les Paul guitars, like any other wooden instrument, are susceptible to changes in humidity. Avoid storing your guitar in extreme environments, such as a damp basement or a hot car trunk, as this can cause the wood to warp, crack, or lose its tone. Use a humidifier or dehumidifier in your guitar case or room to maintain an ideal humidity level of around 45-50%.\n\nCheck the hardware: Regularly inspect the hardware of your Epiphone Les Paul, including the tuners, bridge, and pickups, for any signs of wear, loose screws, or rust. Tighten any loose hardware and replace any damaged or worn parts promptly to avoid further damage or deterioration.\n\nMonitor the neck relief: The neck relief, or the curvature of the guitar neck, affects the playability and intonation of your Epiphone Les Paul. Use a straightedge or a neck relief gauge to check the neck relief periodically. If needed, adjust the truss rod following the manufacturer's instructions or seek professional assistance to ensure proper adjustment.\n\nProtect the finish: The finish of your Epiphone Les Paul is a significant aesthetic and protective element of the guitar. Avoid using abrasive cleaners or harsh chemicals that can damage the finish. Use a guitar polish or wax specifically designed for guitars to protect and restore the finish, and always use a soft cloth to apply and buff the product.\n\nStore it properly: When not in use, store your Epiphone Les Paul in a secure and stable environment, such as a sturdy guitar stand or a padded guitar case. Avoid leaning it against a wall or leaving it lying around, as this can expose it to potential damage or accidents.\n\nRegular setups: Consider getting your Epiphone Les Paul professionally set up by a qualified guitar technician at least once a year, or more frequently if you notice any issues with playability, intonation, or action. A proper setup can ensure that your guitar is in its optimal condition for playing and performing.\n\nRemember, proper maintenance and care can significantly extend the lifespan and performance of your Epiphone Les Paul, and ultimately enhance your playing experience. By following these maintenance tips and consulting the manufacturer's instructions or seeking professional assistance when needed, you can keep your Epiphone Les Paul in top shape for years to come.
