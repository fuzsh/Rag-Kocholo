        "text": "Just watched a video of Black Stone Cherry playing live with a white LP studio!\n\nIve seen afew decent ppl using then.\n\nAnd ill be using my Studio at my gig tomoro night!... oh wait u asked for famous players, sorry...maybe one day! hehe\n\nDavid Cook\n\nWow I never thought I'd see the day when someone would throw out this guy as someone \"famous\". Thats like saying the lady who drives your kid's school bus is famous. David isn't a musician, just an ugly face to put with that awful music\n\nThat Jade Puget guy has some huge arms, he needs to lay off the steroids....Ive never heard of any of these people. But this does make me wonder why no one plays Studios, some of my favorites over the years have been Studios, Ive had some that played better than Customs, serioulsy.\n\nwho is paul landers and why does he look like a mannequin?\n\nRammstein...they all look kinda weird, I like some of their songs.\n\nthe guitarist for saving able used a black studio for one song when i saw them. it was an older one with the ebony board and dot inlays. besides that, i cant think of ever seeing anyone else use one.\n\nI could imagine a guitarist making lots of money from record sales would go for higher end guitars just out of principle and since it's just a small insignificant itch on their wallets. (Or if he found a real player among the Studio LP line.)\n\nOkay, so we've established that no one famous would be seen with a Studio.\n\nThis was a surprise?\n\nYour an arrogrant prick. It's the player that makes the guitar sound good, not the guitar that makes the player sound good.\n\nJoe Don Rooney from Rascal Flatts played one in the \"Life Is A Highway\" video (I have kids, so had that one hammered into my head after the movie \"Cars\"). Your personal musical taste will dictate whether you think they're \"famous\".\n\nIt's the player that makes the guitar sound good, not the guitar that makes the player sound good.\n\nThis is the Gospel. Therefore I reitterate the question: why dont you see top name guys with Studios, some of them are excellent guitars. One of my favorite guitarist, Brian Forsythe of Kix and Rhino Bucket, his main axe is a modded Melody Maker...talk about bottom of the line guitar, but he can make it sound like dyn-O-mite !\n\nOkay, so we've established that no one famous would be seen with a Studio.\n\nThis was a surprise?\n\nQuit being a dick man\n\nI'm willing to bet more people know of the people posted than they know of you or me or anyone else in this thread.\n\nHonestly, I don't know who these guys are...\n\nThis is a famous guy with a Studio, although not a guitarist:\n\nthat chick is hideous."
