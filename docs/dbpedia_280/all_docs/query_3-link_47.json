        "text": "Les Paul (born June 9, 1915, Waukesha, Wisconsin, U.S.—died August 12, 2009, White Plains, New York) was an American jazz and country guitarist and inventor who was perhaps best known for his design of a solid-body electric guitar, though he also made notable contributions to the recording process.\n\nPaul designed a solid-body electric guitar in 1941. However, by the time the Les Paul Standard was ready for production by the Gibson Guitar Company in 1952, Leo Fender had already mass-produced the Fender Broadcaster four years earlier, thus beating Paul to popular credit for the invention. Nonetheless, the Les Paul acquired a devoted following, and its versatility and balance made it the favoured instrument of such figures as Eric Clapton, Jimmy Page, and Peter Frampton.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nInventors and Inventions\n\nBefore focusing his attention on electric guitar design, Paul was a working country and jazz musician—performing with his own Les Paul Trio in the 1930s and with singers such as Bing Crosby and the Andrews Sisters in the 1940s—and for a time had his own radio program in Chicago. In the 1950s, while continuing to perform—mostly with his wife, Mary Ford (original name Colleen Summers; b. July 7, 1924, Pasadena, California—d. September 30, 1977, Los Angeles, California)—Paul pioneered the development of multitrack recording and is credited with having invented the first eight-track tape recorder and the technique of overdubbing."
