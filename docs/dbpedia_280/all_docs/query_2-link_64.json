        "text": "OK, all my old guitars are now borderline vintage, and thus sort of retired from active duty. So there was I, having gigs coming up, but no guitar to play them with! And then this happens...\n\nLadies and gentlemen, this is not only virtually, but actually quite LITERALLY, an unplayed Gibby LP Studio the seller purchased new last spring. The case candy is all there, the original sales receipt dated 04/2023 is included, and there's no fret wear whatsoever! And indeed, how could there even be any? The guy wanted a Standard but didn't have the funds, so he bought this instead and never bonded with it. Nah, the guitar just received some test play and went in the cupboard for a year!\n\nSo it's pristine, apart from some nitro cracking near the nut. But that's just cosmetic, and it's flawless and fully functional otherwise. And very well made too, because according to Gibson, these were even factory PLEK'd! I naturally had to set it up myself due to the original setup being ridiculously slinky and low, but now that it's done, I can imagine NO situation this guitar can't handle - if I myself only can!\n\nAnd last but not least, the price. According to the original sales receipt it was sold new for €1549, but since the guy just wanted to get rid of it, I got it for... and yup, still can't believe it myself either... €770 all told. Not bad for an unplayed Gibson, huh???\n\nSo here it is, a brand new workingman's guitar one doesn't have to worry about!\n\nThanks man, me too! It's darkish, yet just right somehow. Some don't like thick finishes, but that's deep nitro! And I just love how those emanate a certain GLOW in a good light...\n\nAgreed. I'm a sucker for rich reds, copper, bronze, etc. Good sunbursts are things of beauty. They look like the chords you play, the tones you chase.\n\nTwo other finishes I really like are Ibanez's tobacco burst and Reverend's coffee burst.\n\nAnd for an affordable little acoustic with lovely grandpa-liked-his-filterless-cigarettes out-of-the-box amber, this is great:\n\nhttps://www.chicagomusicexchange.co...concert-acoustic-limited-edition-tinted-18303\n\nAll we need now is a good Soaked in Good Bourbon option, and maybe a Very Crispy Hot-Sauce-Soaked Chicken Wing factory-special run, and that's a pretty good night out, right there...."
