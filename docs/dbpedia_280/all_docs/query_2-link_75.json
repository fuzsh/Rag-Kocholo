        "text": "This is a wine red Les Paul Studio that I bought second hand roughly a year ago. Made in Gibson‘s Nashville plant, Tenessee in 2004 with gold coloured hardware and trapezoid fret inlays. I thought it may be useful to write a review after owning the guitar for a while as I feel that it takes a little getting used to in order to fully appreciate the versatility and sheer playability of this instrument.\n\nDon’t get me wrong, I loved this guitar right away; it looks beautiful with a deep wine red finish of high-gloss nitrocellulose lacquer and, playing it through my Line6 Spider IV amp, it easily produces the meaty, classic tones and chunky sustain you expect from a Gibson. With the amp on the preset ‘crunch’ setting, it is almost perfect for Led Zeppelin’s ‘Rock and Roll’, just a small turn of the dial to the ‘metal’ setting and you’re straight into ‘Paranoid’. But, it did take me a while to get comfortable playing it as I initially found it quite cumbersome and not very responsive to a more gentle touch. This was possibly down to the characteristic round Gibson neck, which does tend to necessitate a more forceful grip on the guitar, or just a result of my playing a particularly slim Jackson DX, almost exclusively for a few years before. Either way, once I had learned to harness my new found power I didn’t look back for a moment. This is a comfortable and well-balanced instrument with a great, full voice that makes me feel like better guitarist by simply adding a little gain, strumming an open E chord and wallowing in the rich sustain that follows.\n\nThis is not only an extremely fun guitar to play but it is also a surprisingly versatile instrument, built for the studio but perfectly capable of performing on stage with it’s range of tones, powerful sustain and aesthetically pleasing enough for even the most egotistical guitarists. Although I treat mine with the greatest care it has inevitably suffered a few knocks and I am glad to say it appears to be a particular sturdy guitar and I am totally confident that it is durable enough to withstand being vigorously played by the most excitable and extroverted of guitarists on a regular basis without detriment to quality of sound.\n\nIn terms of maintenance, everything is relatively simple and straightforward. The Tune-O-Matic bridge is standard, as are the robust Gibson Deluxe tuning heads. There are obviously the normal two humbuckers, three way selector switch, two tone and two volume knobs. I had to adjust the action on the bridge slightly, but only in order to suit my taste and it took a matter of minutes. Bought from new, the guitar comes with a fitted Gibson hardshell case with the Gibson USA logo on the front, strap, polish, cloth and a handful of other accessories.\n\nOverall, after a year of playing this as my primary guitar, I couldn’t be happier with it and feel it is excellent value for money; if you buy new (currently just under £1000) or a reasonably priced second-hand model, as I did you get a professional quality, classic guitar at a realistic price."
