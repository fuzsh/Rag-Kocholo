        "text": "There are certain guitarist I instantly think of whenever I see a particular model.\n\nFor example the Fender Stratocaster is well known to be played by David Gilmour, Jimi Hendrix and Richie Blackmore\n\nThe Telecaster… I instantly think of Keith Richards\n\nEsquire is Bruce Springsteen\n\nThe Les Paul… Peter Green, Neil Young and Jimi Page\n\nAnd the SG I think of Tony Iommi or Angus Young\n\nThe Gretsch Malcolm Young or George Harrison\n\nRickenbacker would be John Lennon\n\nI don’t know exactly what I am trying to accomplish with this post I have just found myself recently being over observant of the makes and models that artists choose to play live vs. in the studio and who are the known masters of which guitar and so on. I don’t personally play but always find myself trying to guess what guitar is being played on a track. Sometimes it’s pretty obvious other times not so much.\n\nThen there are famous guitars like Hank Marvin’s Fiesta Red Strat that was the first ever Fender Strat in Britain. Neil Young’s Martin D-45 ‘Hank’ that belonged to Hank Williams or his beaten and battered ‘Old Black’ Les Paul. Joe Walsh gave Jimi Page his first ever Les Paul because they were so hard to come by in England at the time. There is ’Greeny’ the Les Paul owned and played by Peter Green later sold to Gary Moore and currently owned by Kirk Hammett from Metallica who purchased it for a whopping $2 million. Paul McCartneys beautiful Hofner ‘violin’ bass. Cobain’s MTV Unplugged acoustic that sold for over $6 million\n\nLet’s talk about your favourite famous guitar? Or guitarist and their signature sound. Or what guitar sound you like best? Any fun rock n roll guitar facts?"
