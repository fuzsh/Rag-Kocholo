        "text": "I'm debating which of these to get.\n\nI currently have a Studio which is an excellent guitar. Looking for a stage Les Paul.\n\nMy question is; specs aside is there any difference between the quality of the two?\n\nI could get the Studio for around £800, the Classic for maybe £1300. Both in excellent condition. If I get the Studio, I could another Marshall combo! But I would love the experience of full binding, however if the binding and specs are only real difference I can't justify another £500.\n\nIf however the Classic were to be a better guitar, then that would make it worth it. Up to this point, I've made comparisons between my Studio a Trad and Standard and apart from maybe a slightly better final bit of workmanship on the Standard really couldn't detect any difference in quality. However, this was in a one hour sitting. Perhaps over days and weeks, more of a difference would become apparent.\n\nBe interested to hear the thoughts and experiences of others on this.\n\nDon't get hung up on cosmetic differences for a \"stage\" guitar.\n\nNo one in the audience is going to care if you have one or the other.\n\nDon't compare the costs differences.\n\nGet the one that sounds and plays best for you and you'll never think about what it cost.\n\nI have a Tribute that is my go-to.\n\nI'd keep it over the Studio and Deluxe if I ever had to pick just one.\n\nBut I would love the experience of full binding\n\nYou already have a studio that you really like (described as an \"excellent guitar\"), so why not get what you really want? Don't discount what you really want, otherwise you'll just chase it again down the road, and that previously \"wise\" financial decision will end up costing you quite a bit more. Which is more important ... buying a duplicate of what you already own so that you can have a few dollars left over for an inexpensive combo that you'll likely grow tired of, or just acquiring a guitar that you are actually passionate about that you'll likely keep for life? Seems like a really easy decision to me.\n\nComes down to the actual guitar. If you find a Classic that you really bond with then go for it.\n\nI've own a studio and two traditional classic ABR models which was a special Sam Ash model run in 2015. Sort-of a cross between a Classic and Traditional.\n\nFor me it's about neck shape/feel, tone, then looks, then weight. In every way I prefer the traditional classics. The appearance with binding, the heavier weight (9.x vs 8.x), the neck shape, the pickups. My Studio was totally great and I used it a lot until I found a model I like more. I still dig the studio but it would be sold long before the other two.\n\nI've played other Classics and they are good guitars and I prefer them over Studios. Classics are good cost savers vs a Standard, all day every day.\n\nNot trying to bash Studios, they are very good guitars. Just not my personal first choice.\n\nDon't get hung up on cosmetic differences for a \"stage\" guitar.\n\nNo one in the audience is going to care if you have one or the other.\n\nDon't compare the costs differences.\n\nGet the one that sounds and plays best for you and you'll never think about what it cost.\n\nI have a Tribute that is my go-to.\n\nI'd keep it over the Studio and Deluxe if I ever had to pick just one.\n\nStage/Rehearsal guitar will be for me and my close friends to be honest, what I have to be happy with is the fact it'll get dinged up.\n\nGood point re whatever sounds best for you... why I chose my Studio which was surprising at the time!\n\nYou already have a studio that you really like (described as an \"excellent guitar\"), so why not get what you really want?

Seems like a really easy decision to me.\n\nThat's a good point, another duplicate of what I have would actually get played less. In fact, I'd probably change the pups.\n\nWith the Classic, I'd have different pups and therefore a slightly different sound. A different weight also, which means a different guitar I can appreciate.\n\nMy strats are very different to one another, which makes them more interesting to play.\n\nwhy not get what you really want?\n\nThis too.\n\nWith the Classic, I'd have different pups and therefore a slightly different sound.\n\nThis is why I have 3 different LP's.\n\nI think what I was trying to say earlier was, if you want it, and it plays well, don't let the price make up your mind.\n\nYears from now, you probably won't be telling yourself \"I'm glad I saved a few bucks and got a guitar I didn't want because it cost less\".\n\nThat's a good point, another duplicate of what I have would actually get played less.

You can call me vain / etc., but if I'm not attracted to a particular guitar, I'm not inclined to pick it up. That's literally first on my list of criteria when choosing a new guitar ... 1) find myself attracted to the guitar enough that I want to touch it, 2) pick it up to make sure it feels the right way, 3) make sure it sounds the right way (looks / feel / tone ... in that order). If all 3 fall into place, time to bring her home!\n\nYeah, and good on you for being honest with yourself about your attraction to the binding ... being \"attracted\" to your guitar is something that is far too often overlooked.

Even when I bought it I hated to look of it, but I loved the way it played and sounded. At the time it was the best guitar I'd ever owned, but since then I've bought (and built) a few guitars and over time it ended up being the turd of my bunch. lol! Those first Tributes weren't that good, but the ones they're making now are top notch.\n\nI'm the same way, man, I totally get that.

The original color is Antiquity Burst, and I've often wondered how it would look if it was poking out from behind a gold or black top someday (prob long after I'm dead)."
