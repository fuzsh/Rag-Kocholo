        "text": "Gibson's Les Paul Studio embodies the essential features of the iconic Les Paul guitar with enhancements for playability and tonal versatility. Now available in Wine Red, Ebony, Tangerine Burst and Smokehouse Burst, the Les Paul Studio is perfect for players seeking vintage tone and feel. The Les Paul Studio features a mahogany body and set neck for resonance and sustain. The rosewood fingerboard and SlimTaper neck profile provide effortless playability. The 490R and 498T humbucking pickups deliver tight, high-output tone with push-pull pots for coil tapping.\n\nVintage Sound Meets Modern Playability\n\nThe Les Paul Studio pays homage to the classic Les Paul design with enhancements for comfort. The rosewood fingerboard and SlimTaper neck provide a familiar yet fast feel for intricate solos and complex chords. Two humbucking pickups provide the warm, sustained tone Les Pauls are known for with the added versatility of coil tapping for single-coil-like tones.\n\nHigh-Performance Pickups With Coil Tapping\n\nThe 490R and 498T pickups provide tight, articulate tone and high output. Two push-pull pots activate coil tapping for single-coil tones, expanding the Les Paul Studio's tonal palette. Roll back the volume for warmer, jazzier tones or crank it up for hard rock and metal. With coil tapping, you can achieve tame tones to all-out aggression.\n\nTimeless Mahogany Body and Set Neck\n\nThe Les Paul Studio features a mahogany body and set mahogany neck for resonance, sustain and stability. Its chambered body reduces weight while maintaining tone. The set neck's mortise and tenon construction creates a solid platform for complex technique and heavy vibrato. Available now at Guitar Center, order your Gibson Les Paul Studio today."
