        "text": "The Gibson Les Paul was first sold in 1952 and was named after the guitarist, Les Paul himself.\n\nAlthough originally a failure, with guitarists favouring the Gibson SG at the time, the Les Paul created its own legacy for itself, with countless guitarists using the instrument for their work.\n\nTalking about the guitar, Paul McCartney said, “the thing about Les Paul guitars is that they’re beautiful guitars. That’s due to Les’s knowledge of the instrument and due to his technical knowledge. So he, together with Gibson, developed this amazing guitar. For me, it’s just beautiful to play. It’s a classic. One of the ones I have is 50 years old, so it’s a great antique as well as being a classic. It plays great, and I think that’s due to Les’s expertise. When you pick it up you fall in love with it.”\n\nIt truly became an iconic guitar in its own right, with its hollow sound providing for screeching solos, grungy chords and chunky riffs. As a result, blues heroes such as Muddy Waters used the guitar for its thick tone, whilst heavier guitarists such as Slash used the guitar his ferocious guitar solos."
