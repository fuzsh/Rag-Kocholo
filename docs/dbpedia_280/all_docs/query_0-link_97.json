        "text": "Over the past year, Reverb have had the privilege of partnering with a cast of amazing artists to help them sell their excess gear. They have launched artist shops from the likes of Billy Corgan, Nils Lofgren, Bill Ward, Jimmy Chamberlin, and Wilco, just to name a few. Today, we’re excited to announce that J Mascis of Dinosaur Jr will be joining the ranks, with the Official J Mascis of Dinosaur Jr. Reverb Shop.\n\nJ’s shop will launch on Tuesday, October 31st and will be stocked with over 100 pieces of the “ear-bleeding country” rocker’s gear used on various Dinosaur Jr. tours, in studio sessions, and with his solo and other projects.\n\nIn discussing the shop, J told us that while it’s difficult for him to part with gear, things are starting to pile up, and it’s time for him to make some more space in his studio. He added, “Plus, if I can get this gear into a good home, I’ll have more room to buy some more stuff.”\n\nBased on the items for sale in J’s shop, we can see why it might be difficult. He’s selling a beautiful cache of vintage guitars, including a 1929 Pre-War Martin Parlor, a refined 1965 Burgundy Mist Fender Jaguar, and a 1954 Pre-Gibson Epiphone Acoustic flattop that supposedly belonged to Richard Gere at one point. J is also selling the 1968 Martin D-28S that he often used in the studio and while touring in support of his solo projects.\n\nNaturally, J’s shop also features a couple of amps, like the signature ‘69 Marshall 100W Super Tremolo with the massive 8×10 Marshall 1990 cab and a ‘70s Purple Fender Twin Reverb, about which J told us, “Of course I got it because it was purple and it was cheap.”\n\nAs any fan would know, J considers himself “a drummer that plays guitar,” A clear standout in the drum corner is a C&C Purple Sparkle Drum set that J used while drumming for Sweet Apple. He’s also parting with a pair of Leedy and Ludwig kick drum shells that he used with his and Lou Barlow’s high school hardcore band, Deep Wound. More standout drum pieces are the ‘70s Blue Sparkle Gretsch Rack Toms that were used on Green Mind, Whatever’s Cool With Me, Where You Been, and J’s self-titled LP, which he says is his favorite record he’s ever played on.\n\nKnown for his extensive use of fuzz pedals — specifically Big Muffs and Tone Benders — the shop will also feature dozens of pedals used in the studio and on tour. You can also find a couple of odds and ends peppered into J’s official shop, like the Danelectro Baby Electric Sitar that he used on tour with Dino and a Moog MemoryMoog used on several J Mascis + The Fog albums while J was “going through [his] synth period.”\n\nThe Epiphone Wilshire Phant-O-Matic Electric Guitar was designed in collaboration with Frank Iero, guitarist for multi-platinum band My Chemical Romance, and combines an incredible array of features that only Epiphone would dare put in one instrument.\n\nThe result is one of the smartest and most flexible guitars on the market with all the vintage styling that made Wilshire models a behind-the-scenes favorite of Jimi Hendrix, Johnny Winter, Paul Gilbert, and Steve Marriot.\n\nClassic Form\n\nLike the classic SG design, the Wilshire Phant-o-matic features a double cutaway design with a solid Mahogany body. The 24.75 scale mahogany hand-set neck has a 1960s SlimTaper profile, a rosewood fingerboard with mother-of-pearl block inlays, a 12 radius, and a 1-11/16 nut. The neck profile and double cutaway make the Wilshire Phant-o-matic a perfect guitar for chunking rhythm or cutting leads. The Antique Ivory finish, black single-ply pickguard, and classic form are eye catching to be sure. But what really sets the Wilshire Phant-o-matic apart from the pack is how it sounds.\n\nThis feels and sounds great. the les paul neck and pick ups take this guitar in another direction. it is so raw, but so contained at the same time. i own, and have owned, numerous guitars. this is by far my favorite right now. the sound and feel, mixed with the kill switch and “o matic” tone, make this a guitar worth owning. i liked my Gibson Les Paul studio. but I love this guitar.so much I had to write one for the Phant O Matic.\n\nit’s sad that there’s only one review of this guitar. it is a really great guitar that has so many features. the tone “o matic” feature takes a little tinkering around with to see what it does, i think that it would be a great feature in recording multiple guitar tracks. the kill switch is pretty cool, i can see myself using it more than i should. the rest is pretty basic. volume knob and a 3 way switch. simple, but so versatile.\n\nIt feels solid. frets feel good and the tuners stay in tune. i had to get it set up, but i would do that with any guitar i bought. it’s a great price for an unexpectedly great guitar\n\nBrad Barr of The Barr Brothers has been playing with the same guitar pick since he was 16 years old! He shows us how his guitar pick fights ignorance through music, and what it sounds like on a tackle-box guitar.\n\nHe also talks here about some of his fav guitars , Brad Barr’s vintage guitars attracted notice. he took some extra time to talk about his guitars, one of which has great sentimental value.\n\nYeah, the lap-steel he has is an Oahu — we think it’s late ’30s, early ’40s. I found it in an antique store in Austin, Texas. Got it for about 75 bucks, and I put about six or seven hundred into it. Right when it got back to Montreal, it started committing suicide — caving in and so forth. But a great luthier in Montreal helped me get it in shape. It’s an amazing guitar. Really fun to play.\n\nAnd then the other is a 1951 Gibson J-45. I found that one in Chelsea Guitars in New York.\n\nMy uncle passed away in the late ’90s, and he left me a J-45 from about the same year, and it was stolen in New York out of the back of a car. So I sort of made it my mission for a few years to replace it for myself because I loved playing it so much as well as for the family.\n\nMy uncle also had a daughter who was very sad when that guitar was stolen, so my way of replacing a family heirloom was to buy this one, and it’s been my favorite guitar to play since. Uncle Ted. Ted Barr. He was a painter and a guitar player. He lived in Ashland, Oregon. I guess he moved out there in the ’60s, and I went out to visit him when I was about 18; I hadn’t seen him since I was maybe 12. I went to visit him and just sort of pillaged his record collection and played his guitars and hung out at his house for about a month, just sort of soaking it in.\n\nHe lived in a little, tiny house out there and he was in pretty rough shape; he died of a heart attack, but I think it was like his third heart attack. He tried to heat his house just by turning his oven on and opening it, and that nearly killed him. He lived pretty hard, pretty rough, but he was a great teacher to me, and I’m ever grateful for him.\n\nYou write a lot of your songs on the J-45?\n\nI do write a lot on that guitar. I also write on my other one  I have a Martin nylon-string guitar that I write on a lot. I like to use that. I don’t know; there’s something about the quality of that guitar  it’s a ’69 nylon-string Martin that never comes on the road but is sort of my house guitar, and I write on that one a lot. But yeah, the J-45 has given me a lot of great songs. It’s got a great growl to it.\n\nBut I hope to find a guitar that’s not quite as precious and fragile. This one has really thin wood, which is why it sounds so good. But it’s seen a lot of road and I don’t know how much it has left in it. I want to make sure it’s always there for recording and also, just to be there!\n\nMaybe it could take another 20 years on the road or maybe it’s ready to retire. If I can find someone who can make a guitar like this or something similar to it, I would probably try it out at the very at least, if not bring it on the road.\n\nBut so far, there’s nothing that really compares to this guitar for me."
