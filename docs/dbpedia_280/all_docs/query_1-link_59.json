It is an electric guitar representing Gibson along with SG . It has been chosen by many guitarists since its release, and is one of the unseen masterpieces in the electric guitar world that beginners still regard as the object of envy and still love it along with the Stratocaster .\n\n2. history\n\n2.1. birth and early\n\nThe Log guitar developed by Les Paul\n\njazz Les Paul , who was a guitarist , was not only a guitarist but also a guitar lucer. At the time, as he began performing with a pickup attached to an acoustic guitar to amplify the sound of the guitar in a huge concert hall, the importance of the resonator became less than in previous eras. At that time, he conceived of an instrument with a structure that amplified the sound purely with pickups by removing the resonant box. He took a solid body guitar called 'The Log ' , which he conceived and developed himself, to Gibson, but after being rejected for being like a broom with a pick-up, he contacted Epiphone , a rival company . [3] Epiphone may have evaluated his idea more positively than Gibson, and produced this instrument in a very small amount under the name of 'The Clunker '. But at the time, it didn't make a big impression. On the other hand, Fender , another guitar company that paid attention to the structure without a resonant box of this instrument, combined its lap steel guitar with this resonant-free structure and a new method called the bolt-on neck they devised to finally produce the world's first mass-produced solid body. Developed the Fender Telecaster, a bolt-on neck electric guitar .\n\nfender Telecaster created a sensation by recording big sales as soon as it was announced. Watching this made me feel threatened [4] At the time, Gibson president Ted McCarty decided to try something more innovative than before, and the guitarist Recalling the Les Paul, he developed Gibson's first solid-body electric guitar. This new guitar reflects more of Ted McCarty's opinions than Les Paul 's, reducing the size of the guitar body and [5] , Previously applied to the ES-175, a single cutaway was applied to the lower part, which caused a great sensation, and an arched maple top was added to the traditional mahogany body, and then two P-90 pickups were finally installed to give Gibson Completes the '1952 Les Paul Gold Top ' model , the monumental first solid body electric guitar of the company .\n\n1952 Les Paul Gold Top\n\nIn fact, there are many stories in this model. Originally, I tried to install a treffiz tailpiece like other hollow body guitars, but when the neck angle didn't fit, Les Paul took a knife and drilled two holes in the body, and then the tailpiece . The piece is said to have been fixed. It is also called a swing leg tailpiece because its shape resembles a floating swing. At that time, Les Paul was busy doing live, so he said that he was confused to see his signature guitar's appearance changed every time he met. It's not my signature, it's Mekati's signature? As for the gold painting on the gold top, there are rumors that Les Paul painted it because he wanted a golden color that would bring good luck, and that it was painted to cover the maple top . It seems a little more credible.\n\nSometimes, like the gold top object in the photo above, if you look at guitars that have a rough finish or a lerrick, you can see that the part with the finish is a subtle turquoise color. This is because copper powder is mixed with the finish material to give it a golden color, so the copper powder is exposed to oxygen in the atmosphere as the upper coating of the finish is coated, and as it corrodes or oxidizes , it changes to a greenish gray or blue-green color. The Statue of Liberty and the dome of the National Assembly of the Republic of Korea were originally made of copper plating and were close to reddish brown, but it will be easier to understand if you consider that the color gradually changed to greenish gray over time.\n\nAnyway, several models were developed based on this 1952 Les Paul Gold Top model, and the derivative models of the Les Paul guitars developed at this time are still known as the mainstream derivative models of Gibson Les Paul. At the same time, Les Paul repeats various advancements by year, and the changes are as follows.\n\n1953 Les Paul Gold Top\n\nModels equipped with wraparound bridges were included in the single specification of the Treffiz tailpiece, and models equipped with both bridges were mixed.\n\n1954 Les Paul Junior\n\n1954 Les Paul Custom\n\nThe Les Paul with the Treffiz tailpiece was discontinued and only Les Pauls with the wraparound bridge were produced.\n\nThe first Les Paul Junior model, the '54 Les Paul Junior', appeared. It was released with a very simple structure with only one P-90 pickup, commonly referred to as a 'dog ear', in the bridge position.\n\nThe first Les Paul custom model, the '54 Les Paul Custom', appeared. Unlike the standard and junior models, it was released with an ABR-1 style tune-o-matic bridge from the beginning, and some models were also equipped with a Bixby tremolo.\n\n1955 Les Paul Special\n\nThe first Les Paul Special model, the '55 Les Paul Special', appeared.\n\n1956 Les Paul Gold Top\n\nThe same ABR-1 type tune-o-matic bridge that was applied to the Les Paul Custom was also applied to the Les Paul Standard for the first time, and some models were equipped with a Bixby tremolo bridge from the time of shipment from the factory.\n\n1957 Les Paul Standard Gold Top\n\n1957 Les Paul Custom\n\nThe '57 Les Paul Standard Gold Top' model, the first Les Paul model equipped with a PAF humbucker pickup developed by Gibson after long research, has appeared. The model later became the prototype of the Gibson Les Paul Standard that continues to the present.\n\nLikewise, the '57 Les Paul Custom' model, one of the most iconic models of Les Paul Custom, appeared. Unlike other Les Paul models, it was released with three PAF humbucker pickups, and a model equipped with a Bixby tremolo bridge was also available.\n\n1958 Les Paul Standard\n\nFor the first time, a Les Paul standard model was introduced with a translucent 'Sunburst' finish that gradually becomes darker towards the edges instead of a gold top. The model year standard was later called '58 Standard' and '58 Burst' and became a representative model of vintage Gibson Les Pauls of the late 1950s. The first Sunburst Les Paul, serial number #8 3096, called 'The Fisrt Standard', is owned by Slash .\n\n1959 Les Paul Standard\n\nLes Paul standard models, which have enhanced decorativeness by adding a colorful flame maple top instead of the plain maple top with a plain tree pattern, have appeared in earnest. Since then, this model has been called '59 Standard' and '59 Burst', and it is the most iconic model among the vintage Gibson models, and at the same time, it becomes a model that is traded at an extremely high price among maniacs.\n\nThe 1959 Les Paul of the previous year was very famous, and the recognition was relatively low because there was no major specification change like the “60s Les Paul” reproduced from 1968. However, as a transitional model, there are cases where the Les Paul has the best balance because it is easier to play than the 59 Les Paul thanks to a slightly thinner neck than the 59 model and is more vintage than the 60s Les Paul. In terms of design, it has a keystone head machine, so it is similar to the 59 Les Paul, but it is a monumental model that adopted the slim taper neck for the first time in Les Paul. Recently, the frequency of reproduction is very low, but in the past, it was often produced as a limited model of a custom shop.\n\n2.2. new Les Paul\n\nAfter the announcement of Les Paul in 1954 , Fender 's Stratocaster gained great popularity, and Les Paul was soon treated as an outdated guitar and sales plummeted. In order to overcome this, Gibson president Ted McCarty made various attempts ( released Flying V , Explorer ), but suffered a miserable failure only to sell dozens of units.\n\n1961 Les Paul Standard\n\nHeadstock of a 1961 Les Paul Standard\n\nIn 1961 , Gibson completely discontinued the Les Paul that had been sold in order to innovate and differentiate its solid body electric guitar line, and introduced a new Les Paul that would later be called the SG . It was thought that this new Les Paul would successfully replace the old Les Paul by solving several problems pointed out in the Les Paul until then. This product was obviously marketed as Les Paul outside, but inside Gibson, it was called SG , with the initial letters from Solid Guitar .\n\nHowever, in 1963 , when this new Les Paul was released and was successfully selling well, the popularity and popularity of the guitarist Les Paul gradually decreased, and Les Paul himself was not satisfied with the design of this 'new Les Paul'. In addition, as he gets embroiled in a divorce with his wife Mary Ford, a big problem arises in the marketing of SG, which was being sold under the name of 'Les Paul'. [6] For these reasons, Les Paul asked Gibson to remove his name from products that were being sold under his name, and this new Les Paul finally threw off the name Les Paul and finally changed to SG. started selling. For the subsequent history of the Gibson SG, see SG (Gibson) .\n\nIn the mid -1960s , several famous guitarists , including the Rolling Stones ' Keith Richards and Eric Clapton , began using the Les Paul, and the sound of the Les Paul was re-evaluated. From this time , it became known that the strong output of the PAF humbucker used in the Les Paul and the unique sound of the Les Paul were suitable for rock music, and guitarists ' demand for the Les Paul increased. Afterwards , in 1968 , production of Les Paul Standard resumed, and a new custom model, '68 Custom' and '68 Standard Gold Top' equipped with P-90 pickup and PAF humbucker were reproduced. From this time on, standard and custom models began to be equipped with metal kidneys or oval-shaped tuners.\n\n2.3. Norlin Era period\n\n1973 Les Paul Custom\n\nLater , in 1969 , Gibson was acquired by a company called 'Norlin Corporation', and until 1985, a period called 'Norlin Era ' was met. While Norlin Corporation releases a variety of new models, it also brings several specification changes to Les Paul guitars that have been well-produced. Variant Les Paul models are literally buried in black history. This continued until Gibson 's ownership changed in 1986 and the company returned to normal, reminiscent of Fender 's CBS Era days.\n\nBody side of Norlin Era Les Paul Custom with 3-piece body [7]\n\nRear neck of Norlin Era Les Paul with 3-piece neck\n\nThe biggest feature of the Norlin Era Les Pauls is that they are made in the process of joining the body wood vertically and then cutting it, rather than joining and cutting the body wood horizontally in the traditional way, as mentioned above. Other than that, Keller Bridge or TP-6 [8] Les Pauls equipped with bridges that were often used in the 80s came out in earnest, and Les Pauls, which greatly enhanced the decorative parts by using flame maple in the front and back of the body or in the middle of the three-piece neck, also appeared in earnest at this time. [9] In addition, Norlin Corporation, which acquired Moog , famous for analog synthesizers , used Moog's technology to release Les Paul models (ex. Les Paul Artist) with unique functions such as compressors and synthesizers built into the body.\n\nIn particular, Les Paul custom models produced in the 70s, especially in the early 70s, were talked about because of their enormous weight. The really heavy object even weighed close to 6kg ... This is a similar weight to playing with two Strats belonging to the lighter side at once. In the English-speaking community, it's to the point of making memes like this . The weight-related issues of these Les Paul Custom models led Gibson to create a new model called the Les Paul Custom Light in the 70's.\n\nOne thing to keep in mind, though, is that if you ask if the Norlin Era was 100% dark for Gibson, it's hard to say for sure. As mentioned above, the early appearances of Les Paul models with enhanced decorativeness currently being shown at custom shops or M2M, and instruments using various woods were established at this time, and, although rare, there are also people who prefer instruments produced at this time. because there is obviously In particular, models such as the Les Paul Deluxe, which were first produced in the 70s, are proudly sold as part of the original collection.\n\nLes Paul body with traditional weight relief applied (left) and non-weight relief body without any processing (right)\n\nAt some point between 1982 and 1983 , Gibson began drilling nine holes in the mahogany used in the bodies of Les Paul guitars to reduce the weight, which is now called 'Traditional Weight Relief ' . This traditional weight relief was used until the mid -2000s before subsequent methods such as chambered weight relief and modern weight relief were used .\n\n2.4. After the Norlin Era\n\nIn 1993 , the Gibson Custom Shop was launched, and series that reproduced past models such as the 57 Les Paul Custom and the 59 Les Paul Standard began to be produced, which continues to this day. In particular, from the late 1980s to the late 1990s , about 10 years [10] Produced Les Paul guitars, furthermore Gibson instruments in general, are known among users as the 'Good Wood Era' thanks to excellent QC, an attempt to return to the 1950s , which was called Gibson's golden age , and the quality of wood used. ' and received good reviews. A video about Gibson's Goodwood era\n\nFrom 2004 , all of the general Les Paul custom models previously produced in Gibson USA were moved to the Gibson Custom Shop and production began, and this trend has continued to the present day. As an aside, some enthusiasts prefer the Les Paul custom model produced by Gibson USA.\n\nLes Paul body with chambered weight relief\n\nIn 2006 , Gibson introduces Chambered Weight Relief to the Les Paul Standard series . This chambered weight relief method goes beyond the traditional method of drilling nine holes in the body and involves digging out the inside of the body like a semi-hollow body guitar and then placing a top on it. It was originally produced in the late 1990s to early 2000s . It was a method that was applied only to some modern special models produced at the same time, such as the Les Paul Supreme and the Les Paul Elegance. [11] Starting in 2006 , it was expanded to include general Les Paul models that were previously produced using the Traditional Weight Relief method to reduce weight. The problem is that the weight was not reduced as much as expected even after the body was significantly removed, which may have greatly affected the sound of the instrument. In fact, there were quite a few cases where the weight of the non-weight relief body of the custom shop model, which took longer and more effort to dry the wood, was similar to the weight of the standard models with chambered weight relief. As the name suggests, the Traditional Series of this period used the Traditional Weight Relief that was previously used, and overall, it was evaluated as having preserved Gibson's unique vintage taste better than the standard, allowing users who sought the sensibility of vintage Gibson to purchase a cheaper model. It helps create the result that people flock to the Traditional Series.\n\nLes Paul body with modern weight relief\n\nLes Paul body with ultra-modern weight relief\n\nIn the spring of 2012, Gibson introduced the Modern Weight Relief as many users who had previously used Les Paul showed a negative attitude towards the chambered body . The concept of drilling a hole in the body is the same as the traditional weight relief used in the past, but the shape and location of the hole have changed. [12] In 2017 , based on the existing modern weight relief, the ultra modern weight relief, which slightly increased the area of ​​the excavated parts , was introduced and has reached the present.\n\n2015 Gibson Les Paul Traditional\n\nguitarist in 2015 In celebration of the 100th anniversary of the Les Paul [13] The Les Paul and SG models from Gibson USA are famous for their extremely poor evaluation among users, but they are advanced with high in-drip , various functions developed based on the technology obtained from Gibson, and improved parts. It was released under the concept of a Les Paul , but due to various problems such as an automatic tuner that often breaks down, a metal zero fret nut with wear issues, and a neck that is uncomfortable to play, it is often evaluated as the worst land mine type since the 2010s . [14] [15] Even these overly radical changes were introduced after discontinuing all well-produced vintage-oriented models. This new attempt was evaluated by users that Gibson, who had been anxious about issues related to weight relief, deterioration in the quality of wood used, and QC issues, had burst into a major accident after a while.\n\nAfter the bad reviews in 2015, Gibson hurriedly returned the specifications of most of its instruments, including the Les Paul, to those previously produced, but for some reason, the entire lineup here also has the traditional (T) series and high performance (HP) ) and decided to release it by dividing it into a series. Apparently, the name is Les Paul Traditional , but strange instruments (ex. Les Paul Traditional HP) that are not traditional at all, but rather have more modern functions, have appeared. Unsurprisingly, these instruments aroused great antipathy among users.\n\nIn the end, Gibson, whose evaluation has gradually fallen, finally files for bankruptcy around 2018 , and CEO Henry Juskiwitz is kicked out by creditors. It could have been difficult to see all Gibson models, including the Les Paul, come out as new, but...\n\n2.5. today\n\nSince 2018 , when it was revived once again with a new CEO and investors after bankruptcy, Gibson has refrained from excessively radical changes, and vintage-inclined Les Paul models are the original collection, and a more modern Les Paul categorizes each as a modern collection, focusing much more on vintage-oriented models. On the other hand, special Les Paul models with newly refinished or partially changed specifications are being introduced through separate lineups such as demo shops and mode collections.\n\nHowever , the rock and metal genres are gradually on the decline, the rise of new brand instruments with modern performance and sound (ex. Suhr , Tom Anderson , PRS , etc.), and the rebound of fender- style instruments more suitable for genres such as R&B. Les Paul is currently in a state of decline in its status and recognition compared to the past.\n\n3. characteristic\n\nThe arched top is placed on the streamlined body shape, and the head expresses the curve of an open book, giving it a very classic and beautiful shape, similar to a classical stringed instrument. Fender fans and superstrat fans say it looks like an acoustic guitar . It is known as a synonym for a cool guitar because many guitarists with a macho image use it . A characteristic other than design is that it is a typical guitar that uses two humbucker pickups , and is a medium scale (24.75 inches, 628 mm), unlike the long scale (25.5 inches, 648 mm) of Telecaster or Stratocaster . Most Gibsons It corresponds to the guitar , and helps to create Gibson 's characteristic tone.\n\n3.1. Advantages\n\nA truly all-weather, general-purpose guitar. [16] Unlike its elegant and flowing curves, it has a very strong output and thick tone, so it is often used in rock and metal , but in reality, it is called the ultimate multi-purpose guitar because both the clean tone and the drive tone are excellent. If we were to compare it to an acoustic guitar, it can be likened to the tone of a Martin guitar, with its warm and deep mid-low tones standing out .\n\nAs for the tonal characteristics, it is usually equipped with a humbucker pickup , so the overall output is strong and it is resistant to noise. Even if you use a high-gain distortion effect, there is not much difference in noise from a normal clean tone. Considering that the Storatocaster makes a lot of noise under the same conditions... [17] However, unlike the design of humbucker pickups that are resistant to noise, there are times when noise is quite severe, although it may be due to Gibson 's finishing issues. # Even in the video where Joe Bonamassa lectures on the tone of the Les Paul, even though the sound is not high gain, the noise is quite strong when the guitar is not played. # This appears to be because there is no finishing such as shielding. As you can see from the photo in the link , the condition of the internal board is that no treatment has been done on the inside of the body wood, and several wires, potentiometers, capacitors, etc. are fixed to the wood as is.\n\nAnother advantage is that the gain texture is refreshing and straight when using an amp gain, overdrive pedal, or distortion . In addition, the basic tone itself is very warm and emphasizes the mid-low range , so it is difficult to find a guitar that is more broadly optimized for rock and metal among vintage guitars . Ironically, while developing the electric guitar, Les Paul himself tried to create an instrument with as clean a tone as possible, but many users end up using it with distortion. Basically, the taste of playing a Les Paul with a Marshall JCM 800 at an amplifier gain of 10 without any other pedals is one of the dreams of all vintage lovers. The combination of Marshall and Les Paul is a proven combination.\n\nIt is basically equipped with a tune-o-matic bridge, so it is very easy to replace strings. [18] It's definitely quicker to change strings than most of Fender 's guitars, and compared to the superstrats that use Floyd Rose bridges, it's nothing short of heaven.\n\n3.2. disadvantage\n\nheavy. Even objects that are said to be light may weigh in the late 3kg range, and really heavy objects may weigh up to the late 4kg range , and even considering the average weight, it is equivalent to a bass guitar . Even within the same model, there is a difference in weight between products, and in some cases, there is a difference of more than 500g in the same model. The average weight of a Strat is around 3 kg, so it is extremely heavy. The funny thing is that the SG from the same company is very light. Compared to a bass, its weight is about 4kg on average, so if a guitar smaller than a bass weighs 4kg, it is really heavy. [19]\n\nThere is also a structural defect in that the tuning of the 3rd and 4th strings is easily misaligned due to the 3x3 headstock bent backwards. To deal with this, use products that reduce friction on the nut , such as lip balm or nut sauce, or install an auxiliary device (string butler) on the head that bends the angle of the string. [20] A method to indirectly solve this problem is the top wrapping method, which installs the strings in the opposite direction and then bends them once at the tailpiece side so that the strings are on top of the tailpiece . Compared to the general installation method, This also has the advantage of reducing the overall tension of the string, making it a little more advantageous when bending. Joe Bonamassa is a representative guitarist who favors this top wrapping method.\n\nThe maintenance department is also a bit tricky. Even if you try to touch the truss rod, there is a protective cover, so you have to remove the guitar strings and then open the cover to touch it. With a Strat , you just insert it and turn it. [21] In addition, since it is manufactured using a set-in neck (glued-in neck) method, it is very difficult to repair if there is a problem with the neck, such as a dead truss rod or damage to the neck itself. [22] The Les Paul is famous for the weak connection between the head and the neck, which causes so-called 'neck pop' damage. The structural reason for the thinness of the part is that the truss rod adjustment nut is located in the bent part of the guitar head, which is bent backwards. This is because the neck is made of mahogany , which has relatively low strength .\n\nAnother disadvantage is that it is difficult to play high frets due to the neck heel. [23] [24] [25] This is often cited as the biggest reason why some technical-oriented guitarists avoid Les Pauls, and now modern Les Paul models from Gibson have gently shaved off this part to improve the playing experience. Among electric guitars from other brands that were influenced by Les Paul, you can find many models that have solved this problem.\n\n3.3. prejudice\n\nLes Paul's neck is thick and heavy, so technical guitarists don't use it well?\n\nA misunderstanding arising from the structural characteristics of the Les Paul. To be exact, it's half right and half wrong, but it's true that the performance is obviously 'uncomfortable'. This is because the neck is thick and the part that connects to the body has a set-in neck structure. Plus the weight. If you look at guitars that boast convenient playability from ESP , Dean , Ibanez , or PRS , consider that they all have a thinner neck than a Les Paul and a through-neck or heelless cut structure. Since we are all human beings, whether Western or Asian, the discomfort that comes from this feeling of grip is common. However, this is only a matter of convenience and is by no means an error in the guitar itself. That's simply the concept. [26] In particular, in the case of the Standard after 2008 , which differs from the Traditional, this opinion is accepted and there is a difference in the neck shape, which shows that the opinion is not something that the manufacturer can completely ignore.\n\nThe shape of the neck is different, so the thickness that is held in the hand is different. [27] However, it is true that it is difficult to play the high fret or adapt to the guitar when you first hold it in your hand . If the shape of the neck is not a problem, it is not for nothing that the Super Strat has a good neck feel. However, since the standard of a guitar comes from the sound and fingers, not from the neck, the neck itself does not become an absolute reference point. In reality, the character of the sound is so intense that even technical guitarists don't care about the thickness of the neck. There are rather more strengths in playing riffs... Especially in the case of guitarists who enjoy playing tricky riffs, there are many people who like Gibson 's thick neck shape because it is heavier and more stable. Probably, it seems to be a public opinion generated because the room guitarists, who are the absolute majority of guitar buyers, cannot be completely free from problems such as neck feeling because they use several guitars in turns and guitar playing ends at the level of hobby . Most importantly, playing a guitar with a thick neck for a long time and then suddenly holding a guitar with a thin neck does not make the hand feel comfortable and play smoothly. Regardless of the thickness, the neck that you are used to is just a good fit for that guitarist .\n\nIn fact , Gibson was well aware of this point, and in the 1950s, the thickness of the neck gradually became thinner as the years passed. After the Les Paul was reproduced in 1968 , it became possible to choose a thin neck called the Slim Taper Neck, and even now, the necks of all Les Paul and ES series models that reproduce the specifications of the 1960s are all released with a slim taper neck. .\n\nLes Paul's clean tone is worse than Fender's ?\n\nThere are some people who compare Les Paul with Fender 's Stratocaster , Telecaster, etc., which have a bright and bright clean tone, and say that the clean tone is bad. Because I use a lot of tones driven by raising the amp gain, it's not common to hear it, but there are many people who like the thick and dark clean tone of the Les Paul. On the other hand, overdrive is often applied to single coil pickups, so it can be said that there are no rules for the use of pickups, only common usage. Even if you go to YouTube right now, you can easily find a video uploaded by playing with a Les Paul in Clinton or Crunchtone. Rather, it gives the impression that it suits more in blues or jazz videos. Still, people who do it do it. [28] .\n\nIs it an otaku instrument?\n\nAs detailed in the digression below, Gibson 's instruments are especially highly recognized among otakus as they frequently appear in Japanese animations and comics, and some say that these people use them a lot. In particular, Gibson's most representative electric guitar, the Les Paul, is also not free from this prejudice. Among people who enjoy subculture, K-On! and Botch the Rock! Due to the mega hit of , the Les Paul instrument became very widely known, and because of this, users who love the Les Paul are said to be angry at their instruments calling them sounds like Yui Guitar and Botchi Guitar, and even more so, they are fed up with this. I use Fender for the rest of the main instruments Some say that many users are switching to Stratocaster , but the reality is very different.\n\nFirst of all, there is a big difference in the direction of sound pursued by Les Paul and Strat . Not only is the Les Paul a representative electric guitar using a humbucker pickup , and the Strat is a representative electric guitar using a single coil pickup , but the basic tones themselves are so different that even people who don't know much about guitar sounds can clearly distinguish them. If you are a guitarist who really uses a Les Paul as your main guitar but doesn't want to be called a Yui guitar, you can move to similar instruments from other companies, such as SG , Explorer , Flying V or 72 Telecaster , Music Man , or PRS from the same company. [29] You could also use a Strat guitar with a humbucker pickup . It is said that there were people who threw away their Les Pauls and picked up Strats because they did not want to hear the sounds of Yugui and Botchigi guitars, and it is presumed that this is because the competition between Strats and Les Pauls is so strong. The difference in tone between Gibson and Fender guitars is as big as the difference in tone between Martin and Taylor acoustic guitars .\n\nHowever, as can be seen by looking at the Gibson bar, the number of people who enjoyed subcultures picking up musical instruments is increasing significantly due to band animations. [30] , Around 2020, Gibson appears to be fully aware of the emergence of this new user base, and periodically releases models to meet the needs of these users, so it is difficult to assert that this is an instrument that has nothing to do with otaku or Japanese subculture culture. There is a feeling that it has become a bit more difficult (...) For example, through the sub-brand Epiphone, Botch the Rock! There were actions such as releasing a signature model of Hitori Goto , the protagonist of . #\n\n3.4. effect\n\nThe Les Paul was not the world's first solid body electric guitar , but it was influenced by the hollow body arch top guitars introduced by Gibson before it, and was later introduced by Fender. It is evaluated as having created a reference point for electric guitars in a different direction from the Telecaster .\n\nThe idea of ​​achieving an appropriate sound balance by joining mahogany wood , specialized in the mid- low range, and maple wood, specialized in the high-pitched range, was a very revolutionary idea at a time when the genre of solid body electric guitar itself was unfamiliar, and in fact, by joining various types of wood like this, The process of adjusting sound balance has become one of the most basic aspects of electric guitar design, more than 70 years after the Les Paul was developed.\n\nThe combination of a streamlined body influenced by mandolin and hollow body arch top guitar, a thick body with a carved top, and a rosewood fingerboard also created a very ideal sound and set the standard for what an electric guitar should sound like. Therefore, even to this day, many electric guitar manufacturers and guitarists strive to create instruments that satisfy both the simple assembly process and simplicity pioneered by Fender through the Telecaster and Stratocaster, and the ideal sound pioneered by Gibson through the Les Paul. there is. [31]\n\n3.4.1. Derived/Copy Model\n\nFirst of all, Epiphone , a subsidiary of Gibson , produces low-priced and inexpensive models. As you can see from the Epiphone section, Epiphone was originally a company with its own series, but after being acquired by Gibson , it was transformed into a subsidiary of Gibson and is producing several low-priced versions of Gibson models, including Les Paul. What is especially worth noting is that Gibson produces Les Pauls with unique colors and specifications that are hard to find at a relatively low price.\n\nPRS was also greatly influenced by Les Paul. [32] In the case of the McCarty series, Paul Reed Smith, who learned guitar development skills from Ted McCarty, one of the co-developers of Les Paul, named it after him out of respect for him. In particular, the PRS Singlecut model is a guitar with a typical Les Paul-derived design, and the case in which Gibson filed a lawsuit against PRS in 2000 over the design of the Singlecut is famous. [33]\n\nESP 's ECLIPSE model can also be seen as an improved copy version of a typical Les Paul. When viewed from the front, it has a body shape that is almost similar to a Les Paul except for the cutaway part. However, only the front is similar to a Les Paul, and the back of the body is similar to the player's. It is contoured like a Stratocaster to match the curves of the body , so it adheres more stably to the body, and the cutaway part is dug deeper and the neck connection part is also shaved, providing a comfortable high-fret playing experience. There is also a model made in the traditional Les Paul format without a contour, and it comes with a T for traditional after the numbering. However, some people consider it to be a completely different guitar from the Les Paul in terms of playability and sound characteristics, and rather closer to the Super Strat in the form of a Les Paul.\n\nOther guitars inspired by Les Paul include Yamaha 's SG series . [34] , Sir 's Aura series, Tom Anderson 's BOBCAT series, etc. In addition to these, various companies are making instruments influenced by Les Paul.\n\nIn Korea , several companies are producing copy models of Les Paul and targeting the mid- to low-priced market. The most well-known model among these domestic mid- to low-priced Les Paul copy models is Spear 's RD-250.\n\n4. lineup\n\nAs of 2024, Gibson is producing the models below.\n\nThe original lineup was more complex than the list below, but after the company went through bankruptcy around 2020 , the CEO was replaced by James Cullig, the former CEO of Levi's , and the lineup underwent major changes. The HP (High Performance) series, the source of all evil , has disappeared, and models are classified into two lines: the Original Collection, which is produced with traditional specifications, and the Modern Collection, which contains some modern characteristics. I'm doing it.\n\n4.1. Gibson USA\n\n4.1.1. Original Collection\n\nLes Paul Standard '50s\n\n(Gibson Les Paul Standard '50s)\n\nbasic model\n\n(Gibson Les Paul Standard '50s)\n\nP-90 pickup model\n\n(Gibson Les Paul Standard '50s P-90)\n\nfaded model\n\n(Gibson Les Paul Standard '50s Faded)\n\nplain top model\n\n(Gibson Les Paul Standard '50s Plain Top)\n\nFigured Top Model\n\n(Gibson Les Paul Standard '50s Figured Top)\n\nThis product line was released in the late 2010s along with the '60s model below as an extension of the product line after the existing standard model was discontinued . While the existing Les Paul Standard was a model that was released by appropriately combining the specifications of the 50's and 60's , this model, as its name suggests, has the characteristic of being released by combining only the specifications of the 50's .\n\nBroadly speaking, there are two versions : a model equipped with the P-90 pickup, which has been used since the beginning of Les Paul in 1952 , and a humbucker pickup model added from the standard in 1957 , and the head machine has a keystone head that was mainly used in models in the 1950s. The feature is that it is equipped with a machine. The humbucker model used a pickup configuration of Burstbucker 1 in the neck position and Burstbucker 2 in the bridge position.\n\nAfterwards, the lineup was further subdivided into the Les Paul Standard '50s Faded with a matte flame maple top finish in 2022 , and the Les Paul Standard '50s Plain Top with an opaque finish in the following year, 2023 . Derivative models with more detailed specifications, such as the Les Paul Standard '50s Figure Top with a more diverse color finish, have appeared.\n\nLes Paul Standard '60s\n\n(Gibson Les Paul Standard '60s)\n\nbasic model\n\n(Gibson Les Paul Standard '60s)\n\nfaded model\n\n(Gibson Les Paul Standard '60s Faded)\n\nplain top model\n\n(Gibson Les Paul Standard '60s Plain Top)\n\nFigured Top Model\n\n(Gibson Les Paul Standard '60s Figured Top)\n\nThis product line was released in the late 2010s along with the '50s model above as an extension of the product line after the existing standard model was discontinued . While the existing Les Paul Standard was a model that was released by appropriately combining specifications from the 50's and 60's , this model, as its name suggests, has the characteristic of being released by combining only the specifications of the 60's .\n\nIn the 1960s, very few Les Pauls themselves were produced in the first place, and the Les Paul equipped with the P-90 pickup was a model that symbolized the 50s, so only models equipped with humbucker pickups were included in the model group with the 60s name. This exists. The biggest difference from the 50s model above is that Grover's kidney type tuner was used and the pickup used was changed to the 60s burstbucker.\n\nAfterwards, the lineup was further subdivided into the Les Paul Standard '60s Faded with a matte flame maple top finish in 2022 , and the Les Paul Standard '60s Plain Top with an opaque finish in 2023 . Derivative models with more detailed specifications, such as the Les Paul Standard '60s Figure Top with a more diverse color finish, have appeared.\n\nLes Paul '70s Deluxe\n\n(Les Paul '70s Deluxe)\n\nLes Paul equipped with a mini humbucker the size of a P90 soap bar pickup... However, to put it simply, the process by which this guitar was born is quite complicated.\n\nAs Les Pauls equipped with humbucker pickups became popular in the late 1960s, Gibson wanted to equip most Les Pauls with humbuckers. However, numerous bodies with pickup holes machined to fit the size of the P90 pickups were a problem. This deluxe model appeared because it was ambiguous to process the body that had already been dug up to fit the humbucker, and it was impossible to dispose of many bodies. However, this improvised model sold surprisingly well. [35]\n\nLes Paul Special\n\n(Les Paul Special)\n\nSimilar to the Les Paul Junior, it was released in 1955 as a low-cost guitar. The maple top is missing from Les Paul, the body is a little thinner, and it is characterized by two soap bar single pickups. In 1959, a model with the specifications changed to a double cut was released. [36] , which had a great influence on the design of the SG released in 1961 .\n\nSince the 1990s, single-cut models equipped with humbuckers or mini-humbuckers have also been released, serving as the low end of the Gibson USA line. It comes with a soft case rather than a hard case. In the case of the 1955 model, it is sold at a high price at the Gibson Custom Shop, and in the case of the 1959 model, it is sold at a price close to the Les Paul standard even though it is a USA line.\n\nLes Paul Junior\n\n(Les Paul Junior)\n\nA guitar made with the goal of making a simple but high-quality guitar. In 1954, when the Les Paul Custom (soap bar model) was announced, it was released as a low-end model. A guitar that is similar to a Les Paul, but is slightly smaller and has one pickup and one volume and tone knob . That's why it's easy to catch the tone. The pickup is equipped with a P90 soapbar pickup.\n\nIt is a pickup that has the characteristics of a single and a humbucker, respectively, so it expresses crunchy and oily tones well, and it is evaluated that it fits well with rock and blues . As a variation, there is a special with a thinner guitar called Melody Maker and two pickups, and this model also has a double cut version like the above special. The guitar that was included in the Rocksmith 2014 guitar package is the low-cost model of this model produced by Epiphone .\n\n4.1.2. Modern Collection\n\nLes Paul Modern\n\n(Les Paul Modern)\n\nbasic model\n\n(Les Paul Modern)\n\nstudio model\n\n(Les Paul Modern Studio)\n\nFigured Model\n\n(Les Paul Modern Figured)\n\nThis is a new model created by dividing the 'modern' Les Paul Standard models, which caused a lot of controversy in the mid-2010s, into vintage models and modern models. If the former was separated into the Les Paul Standard '50s and '60s above, the latter is here. separated.\n\nAs the word \"modern\" appears in the name, it is characterized by applying modern functions overall. It has a heel cut on the back of the neck, making it very comfortable to play at high frets, and the internal wiring is made using a PCB board method, making it difficult to implement simultaneously using a simple wiring method. It supports various functions such as push-pull coil split, phase in/out conversion, and tone knob bypass. The fingerboard is also made of ebony instead of rosewood, giving it a neater appearance, and the body is also lighter with a weight relief. Compared to the high-performance series, which was too future-oriented, the parts that needed to be modernized were modernized, and changes that users did not want were boldly given up, so it received relatively good reviews.\n\nFrom 2024, the demand for modern-oriented Les Paul models may have increased, and like the standard series, several derivative models were created, including the Les Paul Modern Studio, a low-priced model. [37] , and the Les Paul Modern Figure, which increased its splendor by adding a flame maple top, were released.\n\nLes Paul Classic\n\n(Les Paul Classic)\n\nThis is a model based on the Les Paul in the 1960s , reflecting the hard rock trend of the time, and equipped with a high-output open-type pickup and a boost switch on the pickup , making it a good sound for rock or metal .\n\nOther than that, the neck is thin compared to other models. In the case of the body, it uses better wood than the studio and is bound, but it is a 3-piece of a lower grade than standard or traditional. [38] A 9-hole traditional weight relief was adopted in mahogany , and the plain maple top went up modestly .\n\nIt was not produced from 2008 to 2013 , and production resumed in 2014 . Up to 2007 production, pickups were equipped with 496R and 500T, and after re-release, they were changed to Burstbucker 61. In Korea , it is not well known due to standard or custom, but because of its popularity, the price is cheap, so people who want to play rock music with Les Paul may try this model. From the 2018 model, it was briefly replaced with a P90 pickup and released, but in the 2019 model, it returned to the zebra-colored PAF humbucker pickup.\n\nLes Paul Studio\n\n(Les Paul Studio)\n\nWith the concept of using the Les Paul only in the studio , it was produced with minimal decoration in the Les Paul standard. Les Paul's characteristic arch top and design are maintained, while binding and mother-of-pearl are removed to reduce the price bubble. It is characterized by the word \"Studio\" on the truss rod cover on the head.\n\nSome say that the wood grade is somewhat low , but if you look at the specifications introduction, it is acknowledged that low grade 4-piece mahogany and low quality rosewood are used. The chamber body method was used earlier than the standard, and the body thickness is thinner, so it is lighter. For that reason, the sound is a little different from the standard, so it can be said to be a studio-specific sound, but opinions differ somewhat. Some guitarists use the studio as their main device, such as those who like a clean design without binding or guitarists who like the oily sound of a studio. In 2019 , the studio's specifications were slightly upgraded, including adding binding to the fingerboard for a while , but in the following year, it returned to a simple fingerboard without binding.\n\nThere were also many derivative models (currently discontinued) based on the studio, Les Paul Studio Gothic [39] , Les Paul Studio Faded [40] , Les Paul Studio Plus Top [41] , Les Paul Studios and Floyd Rose .\n\nLes Paul Tribute\n\n(Les Paul Tribute)\n\nIt is a very affordable model for Gibson , priced at $1,299 as of 2024. It is a model that has no binding and uses maple rather than mahogany for the neck, thereby reducing the price bubble. Compared to entry-level models from other brands, $1,299 is not a cheap price in absolute terms, but Gibson Considering that the price of electric guitars generally starts around the low to mid-2 million won range, it is very reasonable. It is said to have the lowest price among Gibson 's current Les Paul lineup, but still delivers the unique sound of the Les Paul.\n\nIf you look at it like this, the cost performance is very good, but even if you look at it, the top models flicker (...) It seems that there is some luck in drawing. There are also people who pretend to be standard or historic by inserting a pickup selector disk that goes into top models and changing the truss rod cover.Many eye-pleasing elements, such as pretty tops and bindings, are excluded, so it feels quite plain compared to higher-end models. Thanks to that, I got great value for money.\n\nLes Paul Supreme\n\n(Les Paul Supreme)\n\nModels before 2019\n\n2015 model\n\nModels after 2023\n\nIf the Les Paul Studio or Tribute achieved a low price by adding only the essential elements of a Les Paul and removing all the decorative elements, the Les Paul Supreme is a model made by generously including all the decorative elements that can be included on the contrary. The part where Les Paul was stamped in gold silk screen in the center of the head of other models has a colorful mother-of-pearl pattern , and the fingerboard inlay also has a split block inlay that you would only see at a custom shop. The overall parts are luxuriously decorated with gold, and the highlight is that the front and back of the body are made of 4A flame maple veneer. In 2015 , Gibson renewed its entire lineup, changing the design by adding F holes to the body and changing the designs of the head and fingerboard inlays.\n\nIt only came out in Gibson USA, but in fact, just looking at the decorations, it was closer to a special collector model that would have come out of a custom shop. It was a product that was no longer produced after the bankruptcy in 2019, but it will be released in 2023. Around September , a new Les Paul Supreme model was unveiled for the first time since the bankruptcy. Instead of Supreme's previously unique headstock inlay design, a newly designed design was used, and like the Les Paul Access, the neck heel has a contour for a more comfortable playing experience. Another change is that the push-pull knob used in the Les Paul Modern has been applied, giving it a slightly more modern look than the existing Supreme models.\n\n4.1.2.1. discontinued model\n\nAmong Gibson electric guitars, it is one of the models with the longest history, and perhaps because of the history of numerous models being released and discontinued, there are a huge number of discontinued models. This paragraph describes representative discontinued models.\n\nles paul standard\n\n(Les Paul Standard)\n\nIt is a standard from the generation before the current 50s/60s standard appeared, and is often referred to as an old standard among enthusiasts . Unlike the current 50s/60s standard, it looks like a proper mix of both 50s and 60s specifications. [42] , At the time, it even had a somewhat modern color due to the existence of the traditional model below, and as the model name suggests, it showed 'standard' specifications that were between the 50s and 60s, between modern and vintage.\n\nIt was originally produced with a traditional weight relief, but from 2008, the body was produced with a chambered weight relief specification, and from the spring of 2012 , it was changed to a modern weight relief, and the body specifications are quite different depending on the model year. In 2015 , the specifications changed significantly, and from 2016 to 2018, it was produced again as Standard T and Standard HP, armed with traditional specifications. In 2019 , it was finally produced as Standard 50s/60s series, and Modern series. It disappeared into history as it differentiated into .\n\nLes Paul Traditional\n\n(Les Paul Traditional)\n\nFrom the standard in 2008 , it changed too much from the old standard, producing the classic Les Paul Standard under the name of the Les Paul Standard Traditional, and then splitting the lineup and changing the name to the Les Paul Traditional model. It can be seen as being in the position of Fender 's American Vintage Reissue/Origin models. \"Traditional\" is written on the truss rod cover, and there are slight differences in appearance, such as the tone and volume knobs being speed knobs. [43] It adopted a thick neck in the style of 1959 , and a flame maple top was used as a mount. In addition, the \"57 Classic\" pickup, which reproduces the vintage PAF pickup, is installed to reproduce a more vintage yet full sound.\n\nThe biggest difference from the standard since 2008 is in the body. In contrast to the standard adopting a chamber body that was mostly hollowed out, the traditional 9-hole method of traditional weight relief was applied, making it slightly lighter than the solid, but with a solid feel . live. From the 2013 model, it was changed to a solid body with no holes at all, making Les Paul enthusiasts enthusiastic, but from the 2016 model, a 9-hole weight relief was applied again. From 2017 , it returned to the non-weight relief method.\n\nIn the case of the 2015 model, the G-Force automatic tuner and zero fret metal nut were applied to match the name of the traditional model, so the traditional model went through a reverse change from the traditional model . It was separated into Les Paul Traditional T, which made use of vintage specifications, and Traditional HP, which added modern options .\n\nLes Paul Traditional Pro\n\n(Les Paul Traditional Pro)\n\nOverall , unlike the general traditional model of the 1959 Les Paul concept , it is in a position to succeed the Les Paul in the 1960s . A Les Paul model with several modern additions, the same weight-relief body as the Les Paul Traditional, a plain plain maple top, and a rather thin neck in the style of the 60s . In addition, a burstbucker pickup is installed to make a strong and cool sound, and a push-pull tone port is installed to divide the coil of the pickup so that it can produce the sound of a single pickup. Among the current production models, the Les Paul Classic is the model most similar to the model in terms of specifications.\n\nLes Paul BFG\n\n(Les Paul BFG)\n\nFront P-90 pickup model\n\nFront humbucker pickup models\n\nI'm not talking about the BFG9000 It is an abbreviation of 'Barely Finished Guitar '. Literally a guitar with very little finishing touches. The arch top is roughened as if it had been cut, and there is no inlay at all (!), and the finish also gives the impression of roughly sprayed lacquer. The man's guitar is equipped with a P-90 single pickup on the front to provide a unique bluesy clean tone, and a high-output humbucker pickup on the rear. It is presumed to be a reference to a guitar that was custom-made by ESP and other places equipped with such a pickup set. The wood grade is studio grade, but the finish is very rough, so likes and dislikes are divided. The sound is a very rough Les Paul, and it is very suitable for heavy metal or hard rock, and it is said that it is good for bluesy solo performance with a single pickup. Sometimes people buy this and use it with a custom finish.\n\nBecause Gary Moore often used this model in his lifetime, there is a Gary Moore signature among this lineup. There is not much difference from the general model, but the decoration and color are slightly different. The difference in price is several tens of dollars. It's hard to see, but there was also a model that came out with the front pickup set as an open humbucker pickup, the same as the existing Les Paul.\n\nLes Paul Studio Faded\n\n(Les Paul Studio Faded)\n\nThe specification itself is the same as the general studio model, but it is a model that is shipped at an affordable price because it does not perform a polishing finish.\n\nles paul studio floyd rose\n\n(Les Paul Studio Floyd Rose)\n\nThis is a model in which the bridge was replaced with a Floyd Rose bridge from the existing tune-o-matic bridge in the Les Paul Studio model. In general, a model with the advantage of being able to obtain a wide range of arming and solid tuning stability from a Les Paul equipped with a fixed bridge.\n\nLes Paul Standard Double Cut\n\n(Les Paul Standard Double Cut)\n\nA model with a cutaway on the top of the fingerboard like the SG for ease of playing . In fact, Gibson also had double-cut models such as the Gibson Les Paul Special Double Cut, and the design and specifications were made into a standard line by putting the top on the Les Paul Special Double Cut and attaching a humbucker . However, development motivation and sound have nothing to do with those models.\n\nIn the mid -2000s, the \"Gibson Les Paul Doublecut Japan Limited\" model, which large Japanese musical instrument companies placed large orders with Gibson , was the prototype . that was made standard. It seems that this was put out to compete with Gibson- style double-cut design guitars such as the PRS after it gained some popularity . [44]\n\nHowever, the sound and characteristics were different from the PRS , and its position in the Gibson lineup was halfway, so it was not enough to gain as much popularity as the PRS . However, due to the unique sound of the double cut, there are some enthusiasts. It is light and comfortable to play because it is double cut on the chamber body. The sound is more modern than the Les Paul, but it is characterized by a dreamy sound.\n\nLes Paul Junior Tribute DC\n\n(Les Paul Junior)\n\nA double cut version of the Les Paul Junior. Like the standard DC, the biggest feature is that it has a more modern sound tendency and improved access to the high fret with a double cut.\n\nLes Paul Special Tribute\n\n(Les Paul Special Tribute)\n\nhumbucker pickup models\n\nP90 pickup model\n\nA tribute version of the Les Paul Special. Unlike the general Les Paul Special, which has only the P90 model, it is divided into a humbucker pickup model and a P90 pickup model.\n\nES-Les Paul\n\n(ES-Les Paul)\n\nIt is a model made like a semi-hollow body guitar by drilling an F hole in a Les Paul with a chambered body. It is said that due to the influence of the F hole, it has a darker and warmer tone than the general Les Paul.\n\nMelody Maker Les Paul Low\n\n(Melody Maker Les Paul Raw)\n\nIt is similar to the Les Paul Junior, but has a Melody Maker single pickup in the bridge and a slightly thinner body. The shape of the head is also simple, slightly different from the general Les Paul.\n\nLPJ\n\nIt is a special model that was released until the following year in celebration of the 60th anniversary of the Les Paul announcement in 2013 . It can be said that Les Paul is a cost-saving model more than the current studio or tribute. Decorative elements such as binding and mother-of-pearl logos have been completely removed. Also, the finish (painting) also gives the feeling of roughly rubbing the paint, let alone glossy. Of course, compared to the BFG, the finish of the instrument itself is the same as that of the Les Paul, and only the decorative elements are omitted.\n\nHowever, it has all the elements of a traditional Les Paul. Applying a weight relief method rather than a chamber, a maple curved top on a mahogany body of the same thickness as the traditional , a maple neck on a rosewood fingerboard , and a special matte black cover on Gibson's own 490R/498T pickup. The body is heavier than the standard because it is a weight relief method rather than a modern chamber applied to the standard. Overall, it has a modern and bright sound compared to the general Les Paul, but it is said that the traditional tone also comes out without difficulty.\n\nThrough this concept of \"preserving tradition while reducing costs drastically\", it was released at a phenomenally low price of $699 in the US and KRW 880,000 in Korea . This concept caused a sensation among guitarists and became a sensational hit.\n\nAs it became popular, in 2014, a new 2014 model was released to commemorate the 120th anniversary of Gibson's founding. The white color, which was criticized for its poor finish, was removed and other colors were added, Gibson's distinctive crown logo was inserted on the head, and the 120th anniversary logo was engraved on the 12th fret inlay. The pickup was also replaced with a newly developed open-type zebra-colored \"61\" pickup from the plastic cover pickup that was heard as an EMG pickup.\n\nLes Paul Classic Custom\n\n(Les Paul Classic Custom)\n\nIt can be accepted as a low-cost Les Paul custom specification produced by Gibson USA... but in reality, it is closer to a model that replaces the Les Paul Classic model at the top with hardware similar to Les Paul Custom. For the hardware, instead of the gold hardware, which is the symbol of Les Paul Custom, more modest chrome hardware was used, and the split diamond inlay on the head was not mother-of- pearl . Rosewood was used.\n\nles paul custom light\n\n(Les Paul Custom Lite)\n\nSimilar to the top Les Paul Classic Custom, it is a Les Paul custom model that attempts to reduce cost and weight. Les Paul custom models in the 1970s, when the model was first produced, had the problem of being too heavy due to the mahogany body that was not properly dried. This model was developed to relieve this uncomfortable feeling of performance.\n\nIt is characterized by a switch for coil split in a 3-knob configuration (2 volume, master tone ) rather than the traditional 4-knob configuration (2 volume, 2 tone ), and the original Les Paul binding is also included in the front and rear of the body, respectively. Unlike the Custom, it is only included in the front of the body like the Les Paul Standard, and crucially, the body is relatively thinner compared to the original Les Paul Custom. For this reason, compared to the original, the sound is a little thicker and there are cases where the low-pitched range is evaluated as dead, but at the same time, there are also belly contours like the Strat , so there are people who comment that the performance is much more comfortable.\n\nLes Paul 7-string\n\n(Les Paul 7-Strings)\n\nA 7-string version of the Les Paul with an extra bass string under the fretboard. Because one more string was added, the headstock also became a 3x4 type instead of the existing 3x3 shape. There are not many people who use it thanks to the low-pitched string attached to the bottom, but it is evaluated that it has become easier when used with progressive metal , metal core , or gent . [45]\n\nLes Paul 12-string\n\n(Les Paul 12-Strings)\n\nThe 12-string version of the Les Paulo is said to be reminiscent of a centipede because the head is much longer to handle the doubled number of strings . The photo is a Les Paul Traditional 12-string that was briefly sold in 2012 . The 1990 Les Paul 12-string version with the flame maple top was never officially sold and only two copies were in unofficial circulation, each featuring Warren Haynes of the Allman Brothers Band . [46] and slash # are known to have\n\nrobot les paul\n\n(Robot Les Paul)\n\nLespolo, which was released as a limited edition in 2007 , is a model that is in the direct ancestor position of Dark Fire below, and furthermore, Firebird X. With the robot tuner function installed, easy tuning was possible.\n\ndark fire\n\n(Dark Fire)\n\nIt is a model released in 2009 , and the official name is Dark Fire, but since the body shape and design are Les Paul, it is classified as a Les Paul type electric guitar. Les Paulo developed by applying modern technology and design, a robot tuner that automatically turns the head machine to adjust the tuning when tuning is set [47] , a piezo pickup with a built-in bridge and an internal board enabling various tone making, etc., it was possible to produce various sounds not limited to electric guitars.\n\nHowever, for most Gibson users who preferred a vintage taste, the evaluation was not very good, saying that it was a clumsy progress. Some of the features that were applied to the guitar are also applied to other models such as the Firebird X, which later became a full-fledged modern electric guitar developed by Gibson as a motto.\n\nLes Paul High Performance\n\n(Les Paul High Performance)\n\nLike its name, High Performance, this model is equipped with various convenience functions that were not found in existing Les Pauls. A rich light was used on the fretboard, and a titanium nut similar to the 2015 Les Pauls was mounted. It seems that the G-force automatic tuner was not included due to the backlash from users. It was a model that was sold only briefly while sharing the infamous HP series with the existing models for a while, and was discontinued like a ghost as soon as Les Paul Modern, which is in the position of a successor, came out.\n\nLes Paul All Wood\n\n(Les Paul All Wood)\n\nLes Paul literally finished all parts that can be finished with wood . 3A class flame maple is used as sound wood in the front and back of the body, and even the truss rod cover and back plate cover are finished with rosewood . In addition, the head part, which was previously finished with black lacquer, is also finished with flame maple / transparent lacquer.\n\nLes Paul CM Black\n\n(Les Paul CM Black)\n\nA model developed with the motto Les Paul specialized in metal . Like the word black from the name, both the body finish and hardware are treated in matte black, boasting a heavy and unique appearance, and unusually, the bridge is not a regular Floyd Rose bridge, but a top-loaded Floyd Rose FRX . [48] Like the Les Paul BFG, there is no inlay at all, but on the contrary, the diamond inlay of the Les Paul Custom is applied in red to the head.\n\nLes Paul Music City\n\n(Les Paul Music City)\n\nTelespole This model was created with the aim of a model with a tone emphasizing the treble, breaking away from the heavy, mid-bass range emphasized clean tone, which was the goal of the existing Les Pauls. The body adopts ash instead of mahogany , and the fingerboard uses bright tone maple instead of rosewood . Some models are equipped with a device called a B-bander , which is advantageous for playing country music .\n\nles paul recording\n\n(Les Paul Recording)\n\nUnlike models with existing humbucker pickups or P90 pickups, this model is equipped with a low-impedance single-coil pickup developed for clean recording without noise. In addition, the Bixby tremolo bridge is attached, and various switches that were not seen in existing Les Pauls are also attached, so as the name suggests, it seems to be specialized for recording. Pawnbrokers once had a 1969 San Les Paul similar to that model .\n\n4.2. Gibson Custom Shop\n\n4.2.1. Les Paul Custom\n\n1957 Les Paul Custom\n\n1968 Les Paul Custom\n\nThe Les Paul Custom is one of the derivative models of the Les Paul that first appeared in 1954. It generally follows the general specifications of the Les Paul, but the biggest difference is that the specifications have been upgraded in detail. [49] First of all, the fingerboard inlay was changed from a trapezoidal inlay (Treperzoid inlay) to a full block inlay, and the binding that goes into the body was finished by wrapping it in several layers on the front and back of the body. The head was also slightly larger than the regular Les Paul model and the binding was larger. It is wrapped around the headstock and, crucially, has a colorful mother-of-pearl pattern in the center of the headstock, giving it a much more luxurious appearance than a regular Les Paul. The biggest difference from other standards is that the fingerboard is made of ebony instead of rosewood , and it is said that Les Paul himself chose a slightly darker fingerboard to make his fingers stand out when playing fast .\n\nThe '54 Custom model, which came out in 1954 when the model was first announced, had a single mahogany body without a maple top. [50] , it was equipped with a soapbar pickup and a stapler pickup, but from the '57 Custom (Black Beauty) released in 1957 , a PAF humbucker pickup, which had just been developed at the time, was installed, resulting in a thicker and stronger sound. Starting with the '68 Custom, which was announced in 1968 when Les Paul production was resumed after a brief hiatus in the 1960s, a maple top was added to the process of producing only a single mahogany body, resulting in a more balanced sound balance.\n\nThe regular Les Paul Customs (=Les Paul Customs, not reissue models) currently produced by Gibson Custom Shop are actually the successors to the 68 Custom. Of course, there is a difference in grade between the Les Paul Custom and the Les Paul 68 Custom, as much as the Les Paul Standard and the Les Paul 59 Historic. As explained above, the body is thicker than a typical Les Paul, so it produces a massive sound, and since the fingerboard is made of ebony, it has quick response and bright, tight high notes, making it well suited to jazz , rock , and metal . Since 2012, when Gibson was at its peak, the Custom Shop changed the fingerboard to Richlight, but from the 2019 model, the Custom Shop also went back to Ebony . Historic continued to use ebony , but among the Historic models produced during this period, there are products with ebony specifications and richlight embedded in M2M order, so take a close look .\n\nUntil 2005 , it was announced as a single model in the Gibson USA line, but due to various reasons such as rising costs , it was eventually transferred to the Gibson Custom Shop and produced. There is little difference in specifications between models before and after the production lineup change, but some enthusiasts and collectors sometimes prefer models from the USA line over the Custom Shop line.\n\n4.2.2. production model\n\nThe Les Paul models produced by Gibson Custom Shop, Gibson's high-end lineup, are as follows. Because the lineup changes periodically, models that are not currently in production are also included.\n\n4.2.2.1. Historic Collection\n\n1952 Les Paul Gold Top\n\n(1952 Les Paul Goldtop)\n\nIt is a reproduction of the first Les Paul model, the 1952 Gold Top model. 2 soap bars with gold top finish [51] It is equipped with a pickup and features a thick neck in the style of the 50's.\n\n1954 Les Paul Gold Top\n\n(1954 Les Paul Goldtop)\n\nA model that reproduces the 1954 Les Paul Gold Top. The biggest feature is that the bridge has been changed to a wrap-around shape, and other minor changes such as changing the truss rod cover from metal to plastic have been made.\n\n1954 Les Paul Custom\n\n(1954 Les Paul Custom)\n\nThis is a custom model released in 1954 , with a thicker body compared to the 52 Gold Top, and features a black finish, multi-binding, ebony fingerboard, a soapbar pickup in the bridge position, and a stapler pickup in the neck.\n\n1955 Les Paul Special\n\n(1955 Les Paul Special)\n\nA reproduction of the first model of \"Les Paul Special\". It is a lighter and more comfortable guitar with a small and thin body without a top.\n\n1957 Les Paul Standard\n\n(1957 Les Paul Standard)\n\nIt is a reproduction of the 1957 gold top model, which became the prototype of the current “Les Paul Standard,” and the existing wraparound bridge has been replaced with a tune-o-matic bridge, which is the symbol of Gibson electric guitars. The finish has only the gold top finish that has been continued since 1952, and is equipped with the thickest neck among the Les Paul standard models. [52]\n\n1957 is also the year when Gibson first applied the humbucker pickup, which was an aggregation of the latest technologies developed after long research, to the Les Paul. Since then, Gibson's vintage humbucker pickups for about a few years have been called PAF humbuckers, derived from the sticker that says Patent Applied For (patent pending) attached to the back of the pickups , and are also the prototype of the 57 classic humbucker pickups that are installed on some Gibson models. has become Slash said that before this model was reproduced, it was reproduced and used in a personal custom shop.\n\n1957 Les Paul Custom\n\n(1957 Les Paul Custom)\n\n2pickup version 1957 Les Paul Custom\n\n3 pickup version 1957 Les Paul Custom\n\n3-pickup version with Bixby bridge\n\n1957 Les Paul Custom\n\nSee Black Beauty .\n\n1958 Les Paul Standard\n\n(1958 Les Paul Standard)\n\nA model commemorating the start of applying a sunburst finish other than the gold top to Les Paul models after 1958 . This is the first year that the \"Sunburst\" finish, which gradually darkens and deepens the paint from the center to the edge, has been applied. Plain maple without fancy patterns is mounted on it, so it has a sober appearance. [53] Perhaps for this reason, it is also a model often chosen as a practical use by those who are burdened with the splendid appearance of the 59 Standard Reissue.\n\n1958 Les Paul Junior Double Cut\n\n(1958 Les Paul Junior Double Cut)\n\nA reissue of the 1958 Les Paul Junior double-cut version. As an aside, the Pelham Blue color Les Paul Junior Double Cut, which became famous as used by a certain animation character, was included in the catalog when the model first appeared in 1958, but the color that has now been reissued at the custom shop is TV Yellow . Since it only has a color and cherry red color, it cannot be obtained as a new product unless a custom order is placed.\n\n1959 Les Paul Standard\n\n(1959 Les Paul Standard)\n\nThis is a model that reproduces the Les Paul Standard from 1959 , which was played by numerous legends such as Eric Clapton , Keith Richards , Mick Taylor , Peter Green , Jimmy Page , and Jeff Beck, and is often called '59 Burst ' or '59 Standard '. . Except for custom orders from Gibson , it is the most expensive guitar , and it has a gorgeous appearance with sunburst finish applied to the top of the top of the flame maple , a well-dried top-notch mahogany body, an acoustic resonance emanating from an old PAF humbucker pickup, and a greasy sound. characteristic. It is also the lightest among non-weight release bodies. Its value is so high that it is called Gibson's best masterpiece, and Gibson 's fans have almost no guitars more than this model. [54] It is regarded as a dream guitar.\n\nHowever, it is an instrument that is as expensive as its name value even within the Gibson Custom Shop. Basically, the new product price is set at a high price of over 8 million won, and the Aged 59 Standard Les Paul from Murphy Lab is a super-expensive model of the Gibson Custom Shop that exceeds 10 million won in name and reality. The first year production produced in 1959 is traded in units of at least several hundred million won with a premium among collectors and maniacs, as each individual object is a symbolic instrument indispensable in the history of rock and popular music.\n\nWhether Gibson also has the perception that this '59 burst' is its most iconic instrument, around 2013 , various artists and collectors own vintage Gibson instruments produced in the late 1950s and early 1960s. It also introduced a series called 'Collector's Choice ', a concept that reproduced the concept in detail , and almost the vast majority of instruments included in this Collector's Choice were this 59 Les Paul Standard. It means that it is an immortal masterpiece in the electric guitar world recognized by everyone else.\n\n1968 Les Paul Standard Gold Top\n\n(1968 Les Paul Standard Goldtop)\n\nA reproduction of the Les Paul Standard Gold Top P-90 model, which was released after Les Paul resumed production in 1968 . In terms of specifications, it is almost identical to the 1957 Les Paul Standard Gold Top, but the pickup is changed to P-90, and the neck is also thinner than the original model in 1957. [55] In fact, the Les Paul Gold Top model, which resumed production in 1968, had a model equipped with a PAF humbucker pickup in addition to the P-90 version shown in the picture, but the model that was actually popular and sold much better was the P-90 version.\n\n1968 Les Paul Custom\n\n(1968 Les Paul Custom)\n\nIt is a reproduction of the custom model that came out in commemoration of the resumption of Les Paul production in 1968 . The current Gibson Custom Shop Custom is actually quite similar in specifications to the extent that it can be regarded as the successor to this model. Originally, it was not a regular model that was listed on the Gibson official website, and it was a model that was producing a considerable amount of orders from Yamano Instruments in Japan and Guitar Center in the United States , but now it has entered the regular lineup and is posted on the homepage.\n\nThe wood used is a combination of a mahogany neck and ebony fingerboard on a mahogany body with a maple top, and two 68 custom PAF humbucker pickups are installed on the pickup. Compared to previous Les Paul custom models made with a single mahogany body without a maple top, the presence of a maple top has a sound with a slightly emphasized high-pitched range. Compared to other Les Paul custom models, there are relatively few artists who have used the model in English-speaking countries, so the popularity and recognition are low, but Botchi the Rock! It became famous after being used by Goto Hitori, the main character of the .\n\n1974 Les Paul Custom\n\n(1974 Les Paul Custom)\n\nIt is famous for the year used by Randy Rose . It is characterized by a gentle modern sound that is not like the old custom. However, since it was developed during the Norlin Era period, Gibson fans hated it (...) plywood A mahogany / maple / mahogany sandwich body was used , but because of this, enthusiasts are wondering whether this is a Gibson custom or a cheap one from another company. Even in the reprinted version (...) I reproduced this kind of sandwich body, and in addition to the subject of reprinting the Norlin Era Les Paul, which is an object of hatred and treated as shit, it was extremely expensive at a mind- boggling price .\n\nAs an aside, Les Paul Customs produced in the 1970s also feature that there is no dot above the i when looking at the Gibson decal on the headstock. This is also a reproduction of the production of this period, so it is applicable here. # And 1974 is said to be the first time a white finish was available for Les Paul models. Currently, it has disappeared from the official website, and there are no new products coming out.\n\n4.2.2.2. Modern Collection\n\nLes Paul Custom\n\n(Les Paul Custom)\n\nEbony color model\n\nAlpine White color model\n\nA 'standard' Les Paul Custom made based on the Historic Collection Les Paul Custom reissue models above. [56] Les Paul customs produced through M2M or other custom orders are made based on the corresponding model unless there are other requirements. The biggest difference from the reissue models is that the binding color is completely white. [57] Since it is a standard model, it is cheaper than the reissue models.\n\nLes Paul Access\n\n(Les Paul Axcess)\n\nLes Paul Access Standard\n\nLes Paul Access Custom\n\nA Les Paul with some improvements in playing convenience to match the name 'Access'. Looking at the back, the neck joint is concave like a Super Strat and has a belly contour, providing a comfortable playing experience.\n\nIn general, when it comes to Access Custom, many people only think of models using a Floyd Rose bridge, but there are also models equipped with a regular stop bar tune-o-matic bridge. It is also famous as the model that became the original wine red signature Les Paul that Lush 's Alex Lifeson frequently used in live performances. [58]\n\nLes Paul Ultima\n\n(Les Paul Ultima)\n\nIt is a model with enhanced decorative elements beyond the Supreme of the Gibson USA line. As one of the most splendid Les Paul models in the Gibson Custom Shop, it has a splendid exterior that is more appropriate to view as a craft rather than a musical instrument for performance purposes, generously studded with expensive acoustic wood, veneer, and mother-of-pearl. The fingerboard inlay of the model shown in the photo is Tree of Life, which is the most well-known fingerboard inlay option of the Les Paul Ultima. Provided. #\n\n4.3. Epiphone\n\nIt is also made by Epiphone . Unlike other manufacturers' Les Paul copy models, the advantage is that Epiphone can use the model name Les Paul as it is thanks to Gibson 's subsidiary.\n\n4.3.1. Inspired by Gibson\n\nThe head shape has been changed since 2020 , and it follows Gibson's classification method and product name except for the brand name. From the general standard model, Epiphone's own developed pickup, ProBucker [59] goes in It is unfortunate that many models lacked the coil tap function while reorganizing the lineup .\n\n5. famous objects\n\nThese are objects that have been used by legendary artists or have become highly recognized for some reason.\n\nEric Clapton 's 'Beano '\n\nThis Les Paul Standard, which Eric Clapton used during his time with the Yardbirds and Cream, is believed to have been produced in 1959 or 1960. It was produced in 1966 after Eric Clapton finished recording the album Blues Breakers with Eric Clapton for John Mayall and the Bluesbreakers . July , Cream is in England It was stolen during a rehearsal for a performance in London , and its whereabouts are still unknown. [60] There is no information about the guitar's serial number, so even if it were to be found today, there would be no way to prove it. The only clues are that it was in sunburst color, had a neck pickup with a white bobbin, and a bridge pickup with a black bobbin (the color of the neck pickup bobbin is clearly shown in the photo above), and that Eric Clapton testified that the neck of the guitar was a bit thin.\n\n[ Appearance at Metallica Live in 2021 (expand/collapse) ]\n\nThis 1959 Les Paul Standard in Lemon Burst color, originally owned by Peter Green , is unique in that it has an upside-down neck pickup. [61] Peter Green in 1972 He sold the guitar to Gary Moore , who treasured it the most among his guitars for the rest of his life. The guitar, which seemed to have belonged to Gary Moore for his entire life , was surrendered in 2006 by Gary Moore to pay a performance penalty due to a wrist injury. After wandering around for about eight years, it is currently owned by Kirk Hammett , the lead guitarist of Metallica . [62]\n\nAs mentioned above, unlike a typical Les Paul, this guitar's neck pickup is installed upside down so that the pickup's pole piece is closer to the bridge, and as a result of the technicians' later analysis of the guitar's pickup, the winding direction of the coil was determined. It is also said that it was the other way around. [63] Thanks to this, the guitar's neck/bridge halftone produces a unique out-phase tone that is difficult to hear on a typical Les Paul, and Kirk Hammett, who currently owns the guitar, said of this tone, \"It's as if it were connected to a 100-watt Marshall amplifier . \" “It sounds like a Fender guitar.” He also compared it to: As a side note , the neck of this guitar has broken twice . Of course, it was repaired every time it broke, so if you look at the back of the neck of the actual guitar, you can see traces of the repairs made at this time. # The instrument later became the motif of Gibson's Gary Moore Signature Les Paul, and in 2023 , Gibson released a USA, Murphy Labs specification replica with the same specifications as the instrument, and a reprint pickup, the Greenybucker .\n\n'Lucy ' by George Harrison and Eric Clapton\n\nA 1957 Les Paul, serial number 7-8789 , that George Harrison received as a gift from his friend Eric Clapton . It is unknown who originally owned the instrument, but until about 1965 , John Sebastian, guitarist of Lovin Spoonful , owned it, and through some circumstances, the instrument was delivered to Rick Derringer of The McCoys . [64] Immediately after handing over the guitar, Rick sent it to the Gibson factory in Kalamazoo around 1966, refinished it in the current cherry color, and changed the bridge to an ABR-1 type tune-o-matic bridge, but soon the guitar has fallen out of love [65] buy this guitar in usa It was sold to Dan Armstrong Guitar Shop in New York , and Eric Clapton, who was staying in the US, purchased the instrument displayed in the store and brought it back to England . Afterwards, Eric recorded The Beatles ' White Album. [66] The guitar was handed over to George Harrison , who then owned the instrument. Around 1973, George moved to California, where he lived. The instrument is stolen from their Beverly Hills home. The stolen musical instruments were transported to Mexico through a music store in Los Angeles . It was sold to a musician from Guadalajara , but George Harrison, who soon heard the news, took the instrument back himself. [67] Afterwards, George Harrison owned the instrument until shortly before his death in 2001, and after George Harrison's death, it went back to Eric Clapton and is currently owned by Eric Clapton .\n\n' Iron Cross ' by James Hatfield\n\n[ 2006 live performance in Seoul, Korea (expand/collapse) ]\n\nA modified guitar based on a 1974 Les Paul Custom. See article for more information\n\n6. Signature Model & User List\n\n6.1. reality\n\n6.2. email\n\n7. digression\n\n2006 Wayne Rooney 's wife, Colleen, made a gift for Oasis fan Rooney. [124] She once sent her Gibson Les Paul to Noel Gallagher to ask for her autograph. Then, as shown in the picture below, Noel painted it in sky blue, the symbolic color of Manchester City, and sent it back with the words \"Happy Birthday SpongeBob\" and the lyrics to Man City's cheering song, 'Blue Moon' . Rooney accepted it with great fun, and it is said that he reciprocated by scoring the 100th goal in a cool match against Man City. Is it the right answer?\n\nThe guitar owned by Lee Soo-hyun, a righteous man who died while trying to save a drunken passenger from a passenger crash at Shin-Okubo Station, was also a Les Paul. The ID of his personal homepage that he operated during his lifetime was also gibson71 , and the last post was an article about Les Paul's new guitar series. Lee Soo-hyun actually did music activities with this Les Paul guitar, and is two years senior to Cherry Filter's guitarist Jung Woo-jin and drummer Son Sang-hyeok, [125] He is said to have been with the Korea University Sejong Camp School Band 'Unauthorized Stay Out'. The song 'Jonathan the Seagull' in Cherry Filter's 2nd album Made in Korea? is a memorial song to honor him.\n\nAt the Anime Japan 2019 event held in 2019 , as a collaboration between Anime Japan, KADOKAWA and Gibson , a Gibson Les Paul Studio with Kirito , the protagonist of Sword Art Online Alicization, painted on the body was unveiled. # The specification itself is not much different from the 2019 Les Paul Studio except for the finish, and was sold at a charity auction at the event.\n\n8. look around\n\n[1] Produced in the form of SG .[2] Unusually, it uses a Les Paul with a Floyd Rose bridge, not a tune-o-matic bridge like the genuine Les Paul. His signature Les Paul (Gibson Alex Lifeson Les Paul Axcess) released by Gibson also features a Floyd Rose bridge with built -in piezo pickups made by Graphtech.[3] At this time, Epiphone was a huge musical instrument company competing with Gibson with its own position, but in 1957 , it was acquired by Gibson, and the aid debate became a good thing. It's rather ironic that Epiphone is producing Gibson's low-end models now.[4] Sales of Gibson guitars plummeted.[5] Ted McCarty said that he thought that there was no need for the body to be that big, since it is made of logs without a resonator box anyway.[6] Even now, it is not very well recognized, but in the conservative American society of the 21st century and beyond , divorce was socially negative beyond imagination.[7] The dark line in the center of the body is a layer of maple sandwiched between layers of mahogany.[8] It was a bridge with a fine tuner that could adjust the tuning on the bridge tailpiece like Floyd Rose , and was often seen in the 80's.[9] The concept of these Les Paul models with enhanced decorative parts is inherited by models such as the Les Paul Supreme, Les Paul Elegance, and Les Paul Ultima that will appear in the future.[10] Some conservative users date this period to the early 1990s , while lenient users date it to 2004.[11] Both are collectively referred to as chambered weight relief, but the chambered weight relief applied to these two was applied in earnest beyond what is shown in the photo above. The main difference is whether the chambered process has been carried out to the lower cavity part where various control parts are entered. Les Paul Elegant and Supreme Weight Relief (first and second from the right in the photo, respectively)[12] It is made by dividing the empty space in the body into several pieces, and is also called a rib body (...) because of its shape. Among the guitars from PRS , there are guitars with holes drilled in a similar way.[13] So, if you look at the headstock, it says Les Paul 100 in a more rounded cursive instead of the usual Les Paul MODEL .[14] Models produced in custom shops avoided these changes. The specs have changed to the regular models of Gibson USA.[15] If you look at used musical instrument trading sites such as mule instrument markets or reverbs, you can see that only the 2015 Les Paul has a particularly low selling price compared to other models. This phenomenon of avoiding Gibson USA in 2015 was no exception to new musical instruments, and in some famous musical instrument stores in Korea, about 5 or 6 years after the release, the new stock remained in bad inventory, bringing tears to the eyes even though it was an expensive instrument. It was not a fuss, such as hosting a tea show or providing genuine parts as free gifts to replace all defective parts (head machine, nuts, etc.). User reaction at the time of release # #[16] However, what should not be misunderstood here is that guitars called 'all-weather' and 'general purpose' are widely used across genres, but do not mean that they are omnipotent in the sense that they can be used in any genre. It is very difficult to produce the refreshing, heart-fluttering sound characteristic of single-coil pickups, such as those symbolized by Telecasters and Stratocasters .[17] The single coil pickup mainly used in Stratocasters has a structural defect in that it cannot prevent external hum noise from entering, so the incoming hum noise is amplified as it passes through high-gain distortion. Therefore, some guitarists overcome the problem by using a noise gate effect in order to use the Stratocaster in intense genres such as metal music. The Les Paul has an advantage over the Stratocaster in that it does not require any of this work.[18] Compared to an acoustic guitar, which is relatively easy to sharpen the strings, this is much easier to sharpen. Even beginners (do not go through the process of cutting the line with nippers) can immediately know how to insert the line without any explanation after untying and removing the line.[19] However, no matter how heavy it is, in most cases it is not at a level that causes serious difficulties in playing. A woman who uses a Les Paul as her main instrument There are quite a few guitarists , and there are even people who dislike Strats because they do not have a heavy feel, so the issue regarding the weight of the Les Paul is ultimately a matter of tastes .[20] However, this string butler is rarely attempted because it seriously harms the appearance . In some cases, a method is used that does not harm the appearance as much as possible by connecting the string guide of the Fender guitar head to the screw above the truss rod cover and only hanging it on the 3rd and 4th strings. there is. # .[21] In fact , vintage Strat models that reproduce specifications from the 50s and 60s have the truss rod adjustment screw at the bottom of the neck, so you have to completely remove the neck to adjust it. This method is more difficult than the typical Les Paul models.[22] Among some Les Paul copy models, there are items made with the same bolt-on method as the Strat . However, considering that there are only a few places that produce replacement spare necks for such items, and it is also difficult to obtain them, it may be expensive. Moreover, these products cannot be used on genuine Gibson products at all.[23]\n\nIn fact, even if this part is modified by cutting off the neck heel, there is no major problem with durability. The Les Paul's neck-body adhesive holds the neck in place with adhesive applied to the left and right sides of the joint, not the neck heel, so there is no problem withstanding the tension of the strings even if the neck heel is cut deep enough to eliminate it. As you can see from the picture where “short” is written, even if the adhesive part at the bottom is not tightly engaged and only supported by the adhesive surfaces on the left and right, you can see that it is sufficiently supported.[24] If you're still worried, you can simply cut it off like this and bolt.\n\n[25]\n\nEven if the pickup cavity is not cut, the force is applied clockwise (as shown in the picture) due to tension, so it can endure sufficiently.\n\nReference video[26] However, among the Jackson and Kramer guitars that are praised for their excellent playability, there are many guitars equipped with necks similar to Les Paul or widened to the level of thickness. First of all, if you look at Jackson 's 'Soloist' model, which is well-received for its high playability , it is much thicker than the neck of Ibanez or ESP .[27] It is an absolute fact that it is relatively thick, whether it is entirely thick or only a certain part sticks out.[28] Since it is a video with religious content, please refer to it only as a sound sample.[29] Of course, even with the same humbucker pickup, the tone can vary greatly depending on many variables. For example, Gibson 's PAF pickup, which claims a vintage sound, and Sir's SSH+ pickup, which aims for a modern, general-purpose sound, are inevitably different in tone even though they are the same humbucker pickup.[30] For example , guitarists such as Kang Min and Jeong Mato , who are attracting attention in the domestic Djent scene , even cited the K-On animation as an opportunity to get into guitar in interviews. Related article[31] The most well-known brand among these companies is PRS . It can be seen as a case that was directly influenced by Les Paul and applied a standard combination of acoustic wood such as mahogany body/ maple top/ rosewood fingerboard , along with a double cut design and body contour partially influenced by Stratocaster etc.[32] The influence of Les Paul is noticeable in many areas, such as the set-in-neck manufacturing process, mahogany neck, acoustic wood combination of body/flame maple top, and 3x3 headstock shape.[33] As a result of the lawsuit, Gibson won and an order was issued to stop production of the PRS single cut in 2004, but after PRS appealed, the ruling was overturned in 2005, acknowledging that the design was already widespread and common. It is presumed that the reason Gibson fell for PRS among many Les Paul-derived design guitar manufacturers was because PRS was a competitor focused on the high-end guitar market.[34] By combining SG 's design and design method, we created a unique instrument. People who have used it say it is really heavy.[35] Brian May of Queen also owned this guitar.[36] This model will later be reissued in 2006 under the name of Les Paul Special Double Cut .[37] Except that the logo on the headstock was changed from silkscreen to mother-of-pearl, the specifications are almost similar to the ebony fingerboard Les Paul Studio produced in the 1990s .[38] 2 pieces for standard and traditional, 1 piece for expensive custom line[39] The finish is matte black and the fretboard is studded with a crescent moon inlay. It was a limited model, but the grade and price were the same as the studio.[40] It is an entry-level model with a matte finish that has reduced the price bubble.[41] Model added decorative flame maple top.[42] For example, the finish is the Heritage Cherry Sunburst color, which was popular in the 50s, but the tuner uses the Grover Rotomatic tuner, which is representative of the 60s.[43] Some people use all of these by replacing them with hat knobs and blank covers that go into the history below.[44] Since it was based on Gibson's own model Les Paul Special Double Cut, it actually doesn't resemble the PRS very much, and if it does, it resembles Santana 's signature model from the PRS . The PRS guitars of the 2000's and later are somewhat modified from earlier shapes, similar to the Gibson Les Paul Special double cut or Hamer 's double cut models in their early days. Because Santana uses the same design at the time, it is similar to the Les Paul Double Cut.[45] In drop tuning, such as the C drop and B drop, which are often used in the genre, the length of the scale as well as the thickness of the string is important in order to avoid making a buzzing sound when stringing. The scale of the Les Paul is 24.75 inches, which is shorter than the 25.5 inch scale of Fender type guitars, so there is a slight disadvantage in this drop tuning. However, if you look at the review of the model, it seems that the sound of the low resolution is surprisingly low.[46] As you can see in the video, his Les Paul 12 strings are equipped with coil tap switches between the tone knobs. Since there are no modifications to the same model Slash has, it appears that he modified it later.[47] The black speed knob that looks different from the other knobs at the bottom left is the knob that changes the tuning. The biggest feature is that you can go back and forth between various irregular tunings in a short time by turning this.[48] The Floyd Rose FRX is a product developed to smoothly mount a tremolo bridge on a Gibson-style guitar that uses a tune-o-matic bridge. It seems that the product that can be used as it is for the tune-o-matic bridge stud is used as it is labor-intensive and cumbersome to dig out the bridge routing one by one according to the general Floyd Rose.[49] Some say that it was planned to make a guitar like a \" Rolls-Royce \", and the most well-known story is that it symbolizes a gentleman wearing a tailcoat in terms of shape and color combination.[50] Some people believe that '54 Custom's body was made using maple as the main material, but this is incorrect information.[51] Soap bar, the name given because the pickup looks like soap.[52] If you actually measure it, the thickness of the 12 fret neck is over 1 inch. Even among guitars with thick necks, it is difficult to find a ruthless pattanek that is over 1 inch thick.[53] In fact, some of the Les Paul Standards produced in 1958 have flame maple tops raised, such as the 59 bust below. The reason why the 1958 Les Paul Standard Reissues of the custom shop adopted the plain maple top seems to be to create a difference from the 59 bust below.[54] I have to look for another one, like Black Beauty in 1957. In fact, the pick at that price range is just a difference in taste, and it is meaningless to argue about which one is better.[55] The neck was thinned to match the specifications of Gibson guitars in the 60s. ('60s Slim Taper Neck)[56] Some people liken the difference between the Les Paul Custom and the Les Paul Custom Reissue to the difference between the Gibson USA Les Paul Standard '50s/'60s and the Gibson Custom Shop 1959 Les Paul Standard , and this is almost certainly true. However, the production environment is different because the regular Les Paul Standard '50s/'60s are made at Gibson USA, and the 1959 Les Paul Standard Reissue is made at the Gibson Custom Shop. However, both the standard Les Paul Custom and the reissue are made at the Gibson Custom Shop. There is a difference.[57] Les Paul Custom Reissue models have mostly yellow bindings.[58] In particular, his signature is not the original Floyd Rose bridge, but a Floyd Rose licensed bridge with a built-in piezo bridge developed by Graphtech, designed to produce acoustic sounds.[59] Minor copy of Gibson Burstbucker[60] To be precise , the cream was stolen before it became famous , so only a few pictures remain .[61] It is known that it was accidentally installed upside down during repairs.[62] I often play live, and I always use this guitar when playing certain songs, such as Fade to Black .[63] During Peter Green's time with John Mayall and the Blues Breakers, he removed and reinstalled the pickup to imitate Eric Clapton's guitar tone, but accidentally installed it upside down, which is why the pickup ended up upside down. The most likely theory is that the fact that the pickups were wound in the opposite direction was a defect that occurred while manufacturing the pickups at the Gibson factory, or a repairman's mistake.[64] Legend has it that while Lovin Spoonful and The McCoys were on tour together, the guitar amp John Sebastian was using broke, and John traded Rick's guitar amp and the corresponding Les Paul for another amp for the remainder of the tour. It is said that the form has been exchanged.[65] As you can see in the picture above, the 1957 Les Paul originally had a gold top finish with no top pattern visible, so most models do not have a very pretty wood pattern when looking at the finish. It seems that these parts have had an impact.[66] The guitar solo on"
