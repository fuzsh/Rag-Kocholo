        "text": "News & latest Releases\n\nAce Frehley â Cherry Medicine - (Official Music Video).\n\nAce previously released the title track, \"10,000 Volts\" and single \"Walkin' on the Moon.\" Rock ânâ roll and heavy metal simply wouldnât sound, look, or feel the same without Ace Frehley. Among hundreds of accolades, The Rock and Roll Hall of FameÂ® inducted him in 2014 as a Co-founder and the original lead guitarist of Kiss. Guitar World named him in the Top 15 of its â100 Greatest Heavy Metal Guitarists of All Timeâ and plugged the lead from âShock Meâ on the â50 Greatest Guitar Solos of All Time.â Magnifying the imprint of his catalog as a solo artist, Foo Fighters cut a fan-favorite cover of âOzone,â and he even jammed out âNew York Grooveâ alongside The Roots on NBCâs The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon. The late Dimebag Darrell of Pantera proudly sported a tattoo of Frehley on his chest, while Tom Morello of Rage Against The Machine celebrated him on X/Twitter as âMy first guitar hero.â 10,000 Volts upholds an incredible legacy for Frehley, spanning 50-plus years in the limelight. Back in 1978, he delivered his solo debut, Ace Frehley. It reached platinum status and exploded as âthe highest-selling of the four Kiss solo albums in the Soundscan era.â Pitchfork even retrospectively rated it a rare â8.5â score. In 1987, he dropped Frehleyâs Comet. Following Anomaly in 2009, he went on to make history once again. His 2014 Space Invader LP captured #9 on the Billboard 200 and emerged as âThe only solo album by a past or current Kiss member to reach the Top 10 on the chart.â 2016âs Origins Vol. 1, bowed at #1 on the Billboard Top Hard Rock Albums Chart and in the Top 5 of the Billboard Top Rock Albums Chart. He notably maintained his momentum with Spaceman [2018]. \"'10,000 Volts,' in its own time, in its own way, is similarly staggering â quite simply, OVERWHELMING. 10,000/10 -- Ghost Cult Magazine (February 22, 2024) RRHOF-inductee and guitar legend Ace Frehley releases a new video for \"Cherry Medicine,\" featured on his new album, \"10,000 Volts.\" His highly-anticipated album will be released tomorrow. Produced and co-written by Ace and Steve Brown, the uncontainable energy on the 11-tracks showcases some of Ace's best works since his '78 solo album. On \"Cherry Medicine,\" a mean palm-muted chug underlines his pensive vocals where he confesses, âI knew I had to change my ways for sure to keep you by my side.â The track showcases another side of Frehley with its saccharine and sweet, soaring hook as he promises, âI love you, cherry medicine. You heal my every need and some.â He seals the sentiment with another powerhouse solo.\n\nNew Releases - Guitars/Bass/Gear\n\nThe Gibson SG SUPREME Is BACK for 2024 - Full Demo & Overview.\n\nThe Gibson SG Supreme is BACK for 2024 in Fireburst, Wine Red, Translucent Ebony Burst, and a Gibson.com exclusive Ebony three-pickup model. â¶ Products used in this video: Get YOUR Gibson SG Supreme HERE: https://bit.ly/48fGUfp Shop ALL Gibson SG guitars HERE: https://bit.ly/3UxfVc6 Dinesh is using a Gibson Falcon Amplifier - get yours HERE: https://bit.ly/3Uxg3Z8 SG players, now itâs your turn! 25 years after it first appeared, the Gibson SG Supreme is back for 2024. With an AAA-grade figured maple top, Burstbucker Pro pickups, and a striking mother-of-pearl headstock inlay inspired by an original Gibson design from the Art Deco era, this isnât just an electric guitar; itâs a statement and a contender for best electric guitar of 2024! The new Gibson SGâ¢ Supreme guitars feature a beautiful AAA-figured maple top (plain maple on the three-pickup exclusive model) on a mahogany body for a full, balanced tone that gives you that resonance and sustain you need when hitting the heavy notes and big lead lines. The mahogany neck has an ebony fretboard with a compound radius, 24 medium jumbo frets for absolute comfort when playing guitar, and Super Split Block mother-of-pearl inlays so you can see them underneath the house lights when youâre on stage! The headstock on the Gibson SG Supreme is adorned with a striking new mother-of-pearl âChandelier Inlayâ inspired by a design from the 1940s that was discovered in the Gibson archives. The Burstbuckerâ¢ Pro (neck, plus middle pickup on the three-pickup exclusive model) and Burstbucker Pro + (bridge) pickups are paired with push/pull volume controls for coil tapping and individual volume and tone controls (with three volume controls and master tone control on the three-pickup exclusive model) that are hand-wired to Orange DropÂ® capacitors. These appointments make the Supreme series SG guitars some of the best electric guitars for those who need multiple sounds at their disposal as you have absolute control over every aspect of your guitarâs sound, able to enjoy full-fat humbucker tone or single coil P-90 inspired tones too. The three lush finishes, Fireburst, Wine Red, and Translucent Ebony Burst, are elegantly highlighted with gold hardware, making this not only a great-sounding and highly flexible instrument but also an exceptionally beautiful-looking modern rock machine. But thatâs not all! The EXCLUSIVE Ebony finish SG Supreme is loaded with three pickups, so you have even more tonal options! A hardshell case is also included with each Gibson SG Supreme, so your guitar is safe on the way to rehearsal and while you travel to your next gig. Donât settle. Play Supreme.
