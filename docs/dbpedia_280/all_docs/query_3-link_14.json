        "text": "The GIBSON 1956 Les Paul GoldTop VOS has just arrived at our Melbourne CBD store, so we take a deep dive into everything that makes the Goldtop one of the most sought-after Electric Guitars.\n\nThe Gibson 1956 Les Paul GoldTop VOS (Vintage Original Spec) is not just a guitar; it's a piece of history. Highly esteemed among guitar enthusiasts and collectors, the story behind this iconic instrument is deeply rooted in Gibson's history and the evolution of the Les Paul series.\n\nOrigins of the Les Paul GoldTop\n\nThe Les Paul Model Introduction (1952):\n\nThe Gibson Les Paul was first introduced in 1952, named after the famous guitarist and inventor Les Paul. The initial design featured a gold-painted top, giving it the name \"GoldTop.\" This finish was chosen for its luxurious appearance.\n\nEvolution to the 1956 Model:\n\nBy 1956, the Les Paul GoldTop had undergone several refinements. Notable changes included the introduction of the Tune-o-Matic bridge, which allowed for more precise intonation adjustments. This bridge replaced the earlier trapeze tailpiece, significantly improving the instrument's playability and tuning stability.\n\nKey Features of the 1956 Les Paul GoldTop\n\nP-90 Pickups:\n\nThe 1956 GoldTop featured two P-90 single-coil pickups. These pickups were known for their bright, articulate sound, which was well-suited for the rock and roll music of the era.\n\nMahogany Body and Maple Cap:\n\nThe guitar's construction included a solid mahogany body with a carved maple cap. This combination of woods provided a rich, resonant tone with a balance of warmth and brightness.\n\nVintage Appointments:\n\nThe 1956 model retained many of the vintage appointments that made the Les Paul iconic, such as the bound body and neck, trapezoid inlays, and gold top finish.\n\nThe VOS (Vintage Original Spec) Reissue\n\nThe Gibson Custom Shop introduced the VOS series to recreate the look, feel, and sound of vintage instruments. The 1956 Les Paul GoldTop VOS is a meticulous reproduction of the original 1956 model, with attention to detail in both construction and aesthetics.\n\nAging and Finish:\n\nThe VOS models are known for their lightly aged finishes, replicating the wear and patina of a vintage guitar. The gold top is treated to achieve a slightly dulled and authentic appearance.\n\nHardware and Components:\n\nThe VOS reissues use period-correct hardware and components, including vintage-style tuners, historically accurate plastics, and wiring.\n\nCraftsmanship:\n\nThese guitars are handcrafted by Gibsonâ€™s Custom Shop luthiers, ensuring high standards of quality and authenticity. The neck profiles, fretwork, and overall construction adhere closely to the original specifications.\n\nCultural and Musical Impact\n\nLike other Les Paul models, the 1956 Les Paul GoldTop has been favoured by countless legendary guitarists. Its distinctive tone and playability have made it a staple in various music genres, from blues and jazz to rock and roll. The VOS reissue allows modern players to experience the charm and character of a classic instrument, preserving the legacy of one of the most influential electric guitars in history.\n\nWhile a comprehensive list of every guitarist who has used the Gibson 1956 Les Paul GoldTop is challenging to compile due to the sheer number of musicians and the passage of time, here are some notable guitarists known for their use of this iconic instrument:\n\nBlues and Rock Legends\n\nDuane Allman - Pioneering slide guitarist and member of the Allman Brothers Band.\n\nFreddie King - Influential blues guitarist known for his powerful playing style.\n\nMike Bloomfield - Renowned blues guitarist associated with the Paul Butterfield Blues Band and Electric Flag.\n\nKeith Richards - Rolling Stones guitarist known for his raw, blues-influenced style.\n\nLes Paul - The guitar's namesake, innovator, and influential musician.\n\nSteve Hackett - Genesis guitarist known for his progressive rock influence.\n\nJoe Bonamassa - Modern blues-rock guitarist who has used and collected many vintage Les Pauls.\n\nThese musicians, among others, have utilised the Gibson 1956 Les Paul GoldTop for its unique tone, playability, and aesthetic appeal. Their contributions across various genres have solidified the guitar's legendary status in the music world.\n\nSo feel free to come in to Colemans Music at our Melbourne CBD store, 105 Elizabeth St Melbourne or call 03 96545115.
