I’m technically trying to pare down on guitars but fell for the colour and quickly worked out how to rationalize it to myself.\n\nWas a good deal for $450 US, including both original pickups and EMGs, and hardshell case. I really like EMGs in general so will keep them in.\n\nHas a fair amount of wear but I like guitars worn in.\n\nAttachments\n\nIMG_6269.jpeg\n\nIMG_6270.jpeg\n\nIMG_6271.jpeg\n\nIMG_6272.jpeg\n\nIMG_6273.jpeg\n\nLast edited: May 20, 2024\n\nThis site may earn a commission from merchant links like Ebay, Amazon, and others.\n\nT-Rey\n\nSenior Stratmaster\n\nSep 17, 2020\n\n1,686\n\nGeorgia\n\nMay 20, 2024\n\n#2\n\nMan what a smoking deal! I would buy that right now for that price and I don't even need it. Great looking guitar.

As a metalish guitar player, id like to like them so ive tried quite a few out, so again im curious if a beefier guitar like a Les Paul tames them a bit\n\nNoodlearms\n\nStrat-Talker\n\nMay 27, 2022\n\n269\n\nCanada\n\nMay 20, 2024\n\n#8\n\nim curious if the Les Paul takes away some of the brightness typical of EMGs? i played a Jim Root Jazzmaster that was an enormous beast of a guitar all mahogony and i found it really balanced the tone of its EMGs. usually i dont like their sound in the ESPs ive played with them.\n\nYeah, I think that’s a really true. I don’t like EMGs as much in ESPs but they sound excellent in Les Pauls. Definitely feels like it trims some of that brightness.\n\nWillmunny\n\nMost Honored Senior Member\n\nJul 22, 2019\n\n5,380\n\nNw Washington USA\n\nSIngles Forever\n\nSenior Stratmaster\n\nFeb 14, 2019\n\n2,240\n\nMontreal\n\nMay 20, 2024\n\n#10\n\nThat's a crazy deal man. As was said already, it's worth twice that. I bought the same guitar for 950 canadian. Then I put the cream plastics and vintage knobs on it but that's just my preference.\n\nAttachments\n\nScreenshot_20210322-183703_Messenger.jpg\n\nNoodlearms\n\nStrat-Talker\n\nMay 27, 2022\n\n269\n\nCanada\n\nMay 20, 2024\n\n#11\n\n@SIngles Forever, I like the gold appointments on Studios, cream plastics look good too.\n\nDella Street\n\nロン・スレイヤー\n\nJan 9, 2022\n\n3,556\n\nUSA\n\nMay 20, 2024\n\n#12\n\nI always thought that was the best colour on LP Studios.

Has a chunky neck. Someone used shoe polish or something to try and make it a burst. I bursted the back & neck with nitro and made it gold top with double creams.
