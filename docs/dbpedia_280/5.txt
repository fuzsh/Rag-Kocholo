All I could really think of is Jade Puget... but that has to count for something

Frank Iero used to play an Epiphone Elitist Custom, but it broke (not even sure where) and he doesn't use it anymore. Probably moved on to Gibsons.

Completely forgot about that pic of him. So used to seeing him with the Elitist.

I was watching the Venganza concert video and he's using a white studio with only the bridge pickup for most of the concert. Most of the time (for both Black Parade is Dead and Venganza concerts) Ray was using a Les Paul Junior.

My thoughts exactly. Even if I was a rich and famous musician who could afford new LPs left and right, part of me would die inside if a favorite guitar was badly damaged or stolen while on tour. Why chance it?

I would think it would be a good idea to play Studios on the road and keep the nice vintage and expensive LP's at home.

So essentially, Studios are not for famous people.

If they have an endorsement deal, the could probably get a new standard way under MSRP, i may be wrong on that. but that would be a good reason, if your a signed artist and have an endorsement deal, Gibson would sell to the artist cheaper, maybe?? it makes sense why we don't see them, My Studio plays better than some standards i've played.... as a matter of fact im gonna bring it to practice today
