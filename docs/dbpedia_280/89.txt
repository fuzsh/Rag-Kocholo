Vintage Sound Meets Modern Playability

The Les Paul Studio pays homage to the classic Les Paul design with enhancements for comfort. The rosewood fingerboard and SlimTaper neck provide a familiar yet fast feel for intricate solos and complex chords. Two humbucking pickups provide the warm, sustained tone Les Pauls are known for with the added versatility of coil tapping for single-coil-like tones.

High-Performance Pickups With Coil Tapping

The 490R and 498T pickups provide tight, articulate tone and high output. Two push-pull pots activate coil tapping for single-coil tones, expanding the Les Paul Studio's tonal palette. Roll back the volume for warmer, jazzier tones or crank it up for hard rock and metal. With coil tapping, you can achieve tame tones to all-out aggression.

Timeless Mahogany Body and Set Neck

The Les Paul Studio features a mahogany body and set mahogany neck for resonance, sustain and stability. Its chambered body reduces weight while maintaining tone. The set neck's mortise and tenon construction creates a solid platform for complex technique and heavy vibrato. Available now at Guitar Center, order your Gibson Les Paul Studio today.
