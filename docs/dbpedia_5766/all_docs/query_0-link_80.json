        "text": "Last fall, I bought a beautiful notebook with ivory-colored thick pages, which I have been using to write down my favorite lyrics while listening to music. I didn’t have a rule as to which lyrics I would put on paper. I wanted it to be intuitive; if I heard a verse or a sentence in a song that caught my attention, I would take out a color pen, consult Spotify or Genius.com, and transcribe it. After a full year, I now have a good mix of songwriters documented in my lyrical diary. Marie Davidson, Townes Van Zandt, Sia, Jazmine Sullivan, Amy Winehouse, John Grant, Little Simz, and so on.\n\nI knew the answer already, but just out of curiosity, I then wanted to do a little bit of research and see whether the internet agrees with my adhoc list of best songwriters. It unsurprisingly does not. ChatGPT told me that any notion of “best” is subjective, but that certain songwriters are “widely recognized for their exceptional talent and influential contributions to the music industry.” For our AI pal, that means: Bob Dylan, John Lennon, Paul McCartney, Joni Mitchell, Bob Marley, Bruce Springsteen, David Bowie, Prince, and a few others. My guess is that it was probably trained, among many other articles, on Rolling Stone’s “The 100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time.” A much lengthier list, with some other nuggets like Björk, Bono, Michael Jackson, and Leonard Cohen.\n\nI am a big fan of Björk and Michael Jackson. I do listen to David Bowie every once in a while, and I adore Prince’s Purple Rain album. But I really don’t care for their lyrics. I also know that many of the other mentioned musicians have genuinely been the greatest gifts to the music industry, and yet, I also don’t care for their songwriting.\n\nIt was apparent to me, after just a few months of writing down lyrics, what I was drawn to in songwriting: personal specificity. The verses and lines referencing exact locations, particular moments, or real names of other people, all of which have unequivocal connection to the artist. The sort of specificity that has traditionally been more suited for prose and not for chart-topping music.\n\nBut it’s really been only in the past few weeks—an incidental result of reading Susan Sontag’s essays— that I have started disentangling why I am drawn to personal specificity. Before I get to the why, let’s start with the what. What are examples of personal specificity and who are some of the vanguards of this sensibility?\n\nThe what behind personal specificity\n\nSpecific places:\n\nJohn Grant, Benjamin Clementine, and Rina Sawayama\n\nThe following songwriters exemplify personal specificity by writing about particular locations: explicitly identifying them and often providing names of exact neighborhoods, streets, or buildings. I personally tend to gravitate—as will soon be obvious—to those artists who dissect the liminal spaces between their hometowns and the cities they had escaped to. These liminal spaces are charged with so much emotion and I find it inspiring when a songwriter can translate that to listeners.\n\n\"Back then I often found myself Driving on the road at night And the radio was broadcasting the ocean Warm late spring wind whips through my hair I am right here, but I want to be there And no one in this world is gonna stop me. At 25 and 36 to Boulder I was getting warm But now I'm getting colder And I stomp my feet demanding like a child I hope you get everything you wanted boy I hope you conquer the world and turn it into your toy But don't come crying when you're forced to learn the truth.\" —— John Grant, Pale Green Ghosts\n\nI am not too versed in John Grant’s discography, but his song “Pale Green Ghosts” is by far one of the most striking, beautifully written electronic tracks of the last few decades. Pale green ghosts is a reference to the Russian olive trees found along the I-25 highway, close to Grant’s childhood home in Colorado, and is a locational anchor that serves as the glue of this haunting, Rachmaninoff-inspired song.\n\nThese two verses do an excellent job at painting Grant’s anxiety and greed as he drives on Interstate 25 and switches to 36 to get to Boulder, Colorado. He never says this explicitly in the song, but the specificity of the highways and cities give us enough information to infer what’s going on—Grant is taking us back in time, to a period when his younger self had a greedier and simpler vision of the world, fueled by ambition and desire to succeed (“turn it into your toy“). Many years later, Grant would end up with a history of substance and sex addiction, a jarring outcome that Grant now sees as lack of maturity and self-awareness (“but don’t come crying when you’re forced to learn the truth.”)\n\nIt’s a beautiful and heartbreaking ode to one’s inner child by a much wiser, slightly more damaged older self in a setting that always warps time. A setting called home.\n\n\"Adiós Yes, goodbye, adiós Adiós to the little child in me Who kept on blaming everyone else Instead facing his own defeat in Edmonton After all, I should have no regret For if it wasn’t for the mistake I made yesterday? Where would I be by now?\" —— Benjamin Clementine, Adiós\n\nWhile Benjamin Clementine has cemented his status as one of the most admirable songwriters in Europe, he hasn’t yet reached that level of recognition in other parts of the world. And, by “other parts of the world,” I particularly mean the United States, where an English-speaking artist should not have a hard time gaining traction. My guess is that his avant-pop, spoken-word style of music eschews the formula that typically guarantees at least moderate success on mainstream charts.\n\nIt’s a shame because he is a terrific songwriter, and one who ingeniously uses locational specificity as a poetic device. London and Paris, the two cities that have defined much of Clementine’s life, have often been the central topics of his songs, from “Winston Churchill Boy” to “London,” but nothing gets more personal and more specific than “Adiós,” a song about Edmonton—his hometown where Clementine grew up in a strict, religious family.\n\nTake out the line about Edmonton from this verse and the song could easily have a very different meaning. It could be understood as a self-lacerating rumination about one’s own immaturity or even about an unfortunate faux pas. The charm is in the essence of this line, though, in which Clementine says “instead of facing his own defeat in Edmonton.” It’s a moment of specificity that tells us he is saying goodbye to his younger self, the one who was likely at odds with his religious family and the one who escaped Edmonton to busk in Paris. The defeats he didn’t face were probably life’s hardest lessons: that, in most cases, we can’t blame anyone else—even those closest to us—for our hardships.\n\n\"国々に 歩き渡り 鳴り響き 悲劇のシンフォニー 喜びに 変わる悲しみ をさぐる毎日 28 and I still want to scream Can't face who I can and can't be 5,938 miles between you You make me Akasaka sad 'cause I'm a Sucker, sucker, so I suffer\" —— Rina Sawayama, Akasaka Sad\n\nIn so much of Western culture, Tokyo is often glamorized, seen as something majestic, unattainable, maybe even indescribable. For Rina Sawayama, Tokyo represents hope that inevitably always turns into depression. We learn about this dichotomy on “Akasaka Sad,” a track from Rina’s debut album, which describes her perpetual desire to connect with her Japanese roots, leading to repeated stays at a hotel in Akasaka, a district of Tokyo.\n\nThe album’s themes of unclear identity and familial mental health issues are vividly described on this song and manifest exceptionally through numbers, measurements, and exact locations, none of which are typical poetic devices of a songwriter. Rina flees London—where she had immigrated to with her parents when she was five—to find solace in Tokyo, but even with 5,938 miles away from London and just two years shy of turning thirty, the generational trauma catches up with her. It’s a sad feeling, one that only immigrants stuck in a limbo between multiple cultural identities know, and Rina pays homage to this turmoil in the only way that makes sense—with geographical precision, with mathematical exactness, and without any symbolism.\n\nSpecific moments:\n\nLittle Simz, St. Vincent, and Amy Winehouse\n\nThe following songwriters exemplify personal specificity by narrating very specific moments in their lives. This type of specificity is the closest a song can get to being an artist’s diary entry. It requires precision and vulnerability and—most importantly—a life that’s lived; a life full of moments worth writing about.\n\n\"Book smart with the bars, but I never learnt that from school 16 doing up radios sets, I was spinning up all them fools Times I would get home late to my mumzie's crib 'Simbi, who are you with? What have you done? Where have you been?' Shit Tears in my eyes, real tears when Ken got nicked Tore everyone apart, but the law don't give two shits Just another Black boy in the system doing time in bin\" —— Little Simz, 101 FM\n\nAn artist with precision and vulnerability is Simbiatu Abisola Abiola Ajikawo, who goes by the nickname Simbi and who is more commonly known to the rest of the world as Little Simz, the British-Nigerian rapper based out of London. One of my favorite rappers, not only does she capture the essence of British hip hop today, with her exquisite blend of rap layered on top of grime, R&B, and punk, but she embodies specificity in all of her lyrics.\n\nTake “101 FM,” for example, from her album GREY Area, which takes listeners back to Simbi’s adolescence, when she was coming up in the UK’s music industry, “doing up radio sets […] spinning up all them fools,” coming back home late, aggravating her mom. The three lines that quote her mom, “Simbi, who are you with? What have you done? Where have you been,” do a beautiful job of painting that classic teenage moment of facing an infuriated parent after a night out, rolling your eyes at them, and mumbling “Shit.”\n\nShe then gets even more personal and tells the listeners about the year when her childhood friend got incarcerated, which tore her community apart and left an indelible mark on her adolescence, and, very likely, on her view of the world. This is hip hop at its best: heartbreaking, funny, and endearing all at the same time.\n\n\"Prince Johnny, you're kind but you're not simple By now, I think I know the difference— You wanna be a son of someone. Remember the time we went and snorted That piece of the Berlin Wall that you'd extorted And we had such a laugh of it, Prostrate on my carpet You traced the Andes with your index And bragged of when and where and who you gonna bed next All with sons of someone's\" —— St. Vincent, Prince Johnny\n\nI wouldn’t say that Annie Clark, more commonly known as St. Vincent, is a songwriter who wears her heart on her sleeve. But she captures intimate moments from her personal life with great specificity, even if the listeners might not be able to identify the people behind the aliases. On my favorite track of hers, “Prince Johnny,” Clark takes us directly into the post-New York nightlife comedown hours, with her and Johnny—a pseudonym for a friend from the city’s queer scene who’s very self-destructive and rejects help—prostrate on Clark’s carpet, both very likely high on drugs (they literally snorted a piece of the Berlin Wall; it’s not a metaphor).\n\nThe next verse stops the time for listeners and masterfully depicts the intimate moment between them, as Johnny traces his index fingers along Clark’s breasts (the Andes mountains likely being a fitting metaphor) and brags about the famous people he’s going to sleep with. I love these few verses because they distill Clark’s sadness into a concise, nonjudgmental narrative: as she listens to her friend claim the starfucker title with great pride, Clark realizes that Johnny is ultimately just looking for validation and acceptance from his own family—to be a son of someone’s. We, as listeners, get to live vicariously through this specific moment and see the shiny but also dark side of New York’s inexhaustible love for those who don’t belong anywhere else.\n\n\"Your neighbors were screaming, I don't have a key for downstairs So I punched all the buzzers, hoping you wouldn't be there And now my head's hurting, you say I always get my own way But you were in the shower when I got there, and I'd have wanted to stay But I got nothing to say You were so beautiful before today And then I heard what you say Man, that was ugly The Moschino bra you bought me last Christmas Put it in the box, put it in the box Frank's in there, and I don't care Put it in the box, put it in the box Just take it, take the box, take the box\" —— Amy Winehouse, Take the Box\n\nA wordsmith in a league of her own, Amy Winehouse was a true master of lyrical specificity. From hip hop-like references to Donny Hathaway and Ray Charles on “Rehab” to the famous 9-and-14 shoutout to her and Nas’ shared birth dates on “Me & Mr. Jones,” she allowed so much visibility into her personal life through lyrics.\n\nA standout for me is the track “Take the Box” from her debut album Frank, which word-for-word describes the day when Amy went to her ex-boyfriend’s house to drop of his stuff following their breakup. She describes the moment with immaculate exactness (“Your neighbors were screaming, I don’t have a key for downstairs, so I punched all the buzzers, hoping you wouldn’t be there“), including the Moschino bra and Frank Sinatra CD gifts that Amy didn’t want to keep (“The Moschino bra you bought me last Christmas”, “Frank’s in there, and I don’t care”), and puts on paper what is essentially a highly personal time capsule. Amy did the impossible with this song: isolated an event that lasted only a few minutes, made it factual as if she were offering a testimony, and somehow made it heartbreakingly poetic as well.\n\nSpecific people:\n\nNicki Minaj, Sia, and Big Boi\n\nThe following songwriters exemplify personal specificity by referencing actual people in their work, often by real names and without any pseudonyms. It’s a courageous and a risky thing to do. Each time an artist references real people in their work, they break down the walls that separate their two selves: the artist and the person behind the artist.\n\n\"She said, \"Fuck Fendi\", but I think she was playin' I heard she move them thangs, I think she fuckin' Wayne She call herself Lewinsky, that means she give him brain She tryna be like Lil' Kim, her picture looks the same Why she ain't signed with G-Unit, she from Queens, right? And what's her nationality, she Chinese, right?\" —— Nicki Minaj, Still I Rise\n\nNicki Minaj is well known for her unmatched razor-sharp lyrics and I doubt anyone familiar with her music would dispute that. But I think she doesn’t get enough credit for her ability to continuously weave in direct, up-to-date references to people in her own life, references that leave no room for endless interpretation. “Barbie Dreams” from Queen is probably a recent example of this, though I prefer the more factual specificity on “All Things Go” from The Pinkprint and on many songs from Beam Me up Scotty.\n\nWith “Still I Rise,” for example, she mocks her haters who compare her to Lil’ Kim, or speculate whether she’s sleeping with Lil Wayne, or wonder what actually happened between Nicki and her former manager Big Fendi (their fallout happened earlier than people thought), or why she never signed G-Unit, the record label founded by 50 Cent, a fellow Queens-native (50 Cent explicitly said “’cause of Fendi.”) What I love about a verse like this is that Nicki doesn’t play coy; she acknowledges each rumor and each person involved in the rumor, and she makes it clear that it’s ultimately no one else’s business to know. But should anyone be interested, there is plenty of material out there that can help address each piece of gossip. By bringing in so many names of people in her life, Nicki puts her watermark on this song. Even if you’ve never listened to the track, just by reading the verse, you know that Nicki is behind it.\n\n\"Ella is worried about her weight She won't eat in public anymore She is fucking her ex again When they've finished, she sleeps on the floor Nate has a heart of gold But give it away he will not His mother abandoned him at ten It's a pain he has never forgot Mary's afraid of herself Her sentences often cut half She will never give her own opinion She's afraid that people might laugh And I am afraid of sharks I will not swim out past my head And sometimes I worry my boyfriend will die My first love is already dead.\" —— Sia, Fear\n\nSia Furler is another fascinating songwriter to study when it comes to lyrical specificity with people, mostly because she has consciously evaded exactness in her songwriting over the last decade. Just think of songs like “Chandelier,” “Cheap Thrills,” or “Titanium”—they are everything but specific. Packed with catchy punchlines, most of these bops are known for their tropey and effervescent lyrics. You can listen to them, vibe to them, but you won’t get to actually learn anything about people in Sia’s life. In her interview with Chris Connelly for Nightline, she even admitted these lyrics were written using a bulletproof pop-song formula. “I usually choose a one solid concept,” she described “So, I see a chandelier. So then, I’m like, oh I know, how could I use that, that’s a strong title.”\n\nWhat most people don’t realize is that Sia’s vague, concept-centric lyrics are successful only because she intentionally does the opposite of what she’s really good at: writing frighteningly personal lyrics. Before her trademark wigs and the “Titanium”-induced fame, her lyrics were piercingly clear and raw, rife with unequivocal references to her turbulent personal life. On “Fear,” from her 2001 album Healing is Diffucult, Sia goes through several specific people who are all fighting different manifestations of fear, highlighting how this debilitating emotion had hindered their lives. We don’t know whether these people are her real friends, but we get a hint with the lines “And sometimes I worry my boyfriend will die / My first love is already dead,” which is an explicit reference to the sudden death of her then-boyfriend, Dan Pontifex, in 1997 and the booze-and-drugs spree that followed.\n\nI am also convinced that Amy Winehouse’s lyrical specificity was actually strongly influenced by Sia’s earlier work. The transparent references and unwavering absence of metaphor in Sia’s earlier songs like “Healing is Difficult” are the same anti-poetic devices with which Amy crafted her hits. In 2014, speaking to Howard Stern, Sia mentioned that she and Amy—while Amy was still alive—happened to be playing at the Chateau Marmonte on the same day. “[Amy] played the guitar, and she happened to be playing an old song of mine that was called Little Man,” Sia said. Amy mentioned that “Little Man” was one of her favorite songs, which naturally made Sia think that Amy would be open to collaborating. “I knew her peripherally,” she added “And, I was like, well, we should work together. And [Amy] was like no, no fucking way, man, I’m totally intimidated by you.”\n\n\"Shoulda bought an ounce, but you copped a dub Shoulda held back, but you throwed a punch 'Posed to meet your girl but you packed a lunch No D to the U to the G for you Got a son on the way by the name of Bamboo Got a little baby girl, four-year—Jordan Never turned my back on my kids, for them Should've hit it, quit it, rag-top Before you re-up, get a laptop Make a business for yourself, boy, set some goals Make a fat diamond out of dusty coal\" —— Outkast, B. O. B. - Bombs Over Baghdad\n\nI am also a big fan of Big Boi (Antwan André Patton), former member of OutKast, who has often used real names of people in his life. On a personal favorite track of OutKast, “B. O. B — Bombs Over Baghdad,” Patton gives a frisky lecture to ghetto youth and throws in the names of two of his kids, Bamboo and Jordan (his third kid Cross wasn’t born yet at the time), emphasizing what a committed father he always had been and coloring his playful commentary on the ghetto with tried-and-tested advice. On “GhettoMusick,” a track from Patton’s Speakerboxxx part of OutKast’s 2003 album, he also mentions his grandmother, Edna Mae Kearse, who showed him “how to be a smooth operator, dominator in the state of Georgia.” (Funnily enough, his grandmother planned to have a book, which according to Patton was “going to fuck everybody in the family“) I am not going to make huge leaps here and argue there is something profound to Patton name-dropping his family in these songs — but it brings realness to his image and gives texture to his lyrics.\n\nThe why behind personal specificity\n\nAs I’ve mentioned, it’s only in the past few weeks that I have started wondering why I am drawn to personal specificity in songwriting. And, the answer is: transparency. I initially couldn’t name the reason, but as I was reading Susan Sontag’s “Against Interpretation,” it suddenly all clicked. “Transparence is the highest, most liberating value in art—and in criticism—today,” writes Sontag. “Transparence means experiencing the luminousness of the thing in itself, of things being what they are.”\n\nNow, I know it’s a bit counterintuitive to apply Sontag’s commentary to songwriting because many of her essays argue against the importance of content in art, but where I do see relevance in her argument is in the notion that interpretation “presupposes a discrepancy between the clear meaning of the text and the demands of (later) readers” and that it “amounts to the philistine refusal to leave the work of art alone.” In other words, interpretation of art is an act of searching for “meaning:” what did the artist mean? what is the meaning of this color? what is the meaning of this tone? what is the meaning of this song?\n\nIt’s the search for the songwriter’s meaning with people’s adorations of songs like The Beatles’ “Yesterday” or Radiohead’s “Creep” or Prince’s “Purple Rain” or Björk’s “Pagan Poetry” that has always baffled me (and, full disclaimer, I actually adore the latter two). The lyrics in these songs are so generalized, sometimes rife with metaphor, that it almost doesn’t make sense to infer any meaning whatsoever. I’m not saying these are bad songs but I feel that we often attribute too much value to highly stylized songwriting just because it can have so many layers of “meaning.”\n\nInstead, why not value songwriting that is so specific, so exact that it warrants only one interpretation, which is the one clearly given by the songwriter? It’s what Sontag describes as “[eluding] the interpreters in another way, by making works of art whose surface is so unified and clean, whose momentum is so rapid, whose address is so direct that the work can be… just what it is.” Personal specificity abolishes ambiguity in songwriting and produces art that is so transparent, so unique, and so irreplicable. Neither would Nicki Minaj ever rap about depression in Rina Sawayama’s hotel in Akasaka nor would Sia ever sing about John Grant’s existential crisis on Colorado highways.\n\nOf course, this only answers why I as a listener am drawn to specificity. There is still the lingering second question, which is: why are songwriters today writing lyrics with so much personal specificity to begin with? It’s obviously not a new thing (some immediate examples that come to mind: Lauryn Hill with “Zion” back in 1998, Eminem with “Mockingbird” in 2004), but my perception is that it’s more common today.\n\nMy hunch—and it admittedly could be a silly hypothesis—is that the democratization of music through the rise of platforms like MySpace or Soundcloud and through the increased accessibility of production equipment has led to an industry-specific survival of the fittest. What once made songs with generalized lyrics, like Whitney Houston’s “I Will Always Love You” or John Lennon’s “Imagine” or ABBA’s “Dancing Queen,” successful is no longer what works in the world of recommender systems and limited attention span. Generalized lyrics require too much time and too many interpretations to pique one’s interest. Specific lyrics provide straight-to-the point narrative and one truth, which is what the world craves today. In order to survive, therefore, artists need to “specialize” their brand and stand out. What better way to do that than to write very specific lyrics?\n\nIn the end, honestly, whatever explanation there is for so much personal specificity in songwriting, I am here for it. And I certainly hope it doesn’t go away.\n\nPhotography credits\n\nThe photos in this article are works of several incredible photographers, who are listed in order of appearance in the text:\n\n(1) John Grant: courtesy of Hörður Sveinsson.

Follow GL Askew II on Instagram as well.\n\nTwo years ago, while having lunch with my parents, my dad and I got into an argument over the societal value of content creators. My dad claimed he didn’t understand how someone making YouTube videos could be making so much money and what—if any—benefit they were bringing to the table.\n\nI managed to convince him that societal value doesn’t manifest only in something physical, like a sold good, but that it can also manifest in something more virtual and cultural, like a content creator who is pushing boundaries of comedy.\n\nBut I couldn’t answer his other question. He asked how one can even know what a great content creator is when the only metric measuring their success is popularity. I knew that I had strong opinions of which content creators were good and which were not, but I couldn’t give him a good answer as to what actually made them good.\n\nSo, after two years of scrolling through Instagram when I really could be exercising, of watching YouTube videos at 2 a.m. when I really could be sleeping, of reading interviews with content creators when I really could be doing meal prep for the upcoming week, I think I finally have an answer to my dad’s question.\n\nVery good content creators have at least two of the following: depth, relevance, and novelty. Great content creators have all three. I’ll call these three pillars “The Venn Diagram of Content Creators.”\n\nThe Venn Diagram of Content Creators: Depth, Relevance, Novelty\n\nThere are a lot of content creators out there. The decent ones, those who attract at least some level of viewership, fall at least into one of these pillars: depth, relevance, or novelty.\n\nDepth refers to the uniqueness or incisiveness of the creator’s content. It essentially answers the question: Will I learn something new or think differently about myself or the world by consuming this creator’s content? A YouTuber who offers very structured and honest film reviews that are different than those of mainstream critics would be a deep content creator. On the flip side, a YouTuber who offers reviews that are vague and very similar to those of mainstream critics would not be a deep content creator.\n\nRelevance answers the question: Could many people be interested in this? I want to be specific here and emphasize the modality of this question. Relevance is not only about whether people currently care about the content, but it also speaks to the possibility that many people could care about the content if they were exposed to it. A talented photographer who documents lesser-known conflicts and crimes around the world on Instagram would be an example of a relevant content creator. While the subjects of the photographer’s content might be unfamiliar to the followers, the followers can still be invested in their stories. Conversely, a TikTok creator who reviews high-end ski gear would not be a relevant content creator. There will certainly be a subset of people who care about this topic, but the majority of the people will find it inaccessible.\n\nFinally, novelty answers the question: Is this content something I have never seen before or is it presented in a refreshingly unconventional way? For example, an incredibly talented TikTok creator who does fantastic impressions of celebrities is not novel. Many people have done that for many years now. But, say that the same TikTok creator not only impersonates the celebrities, but dresses up to look exactly like them, and then publishes reels of demanding absurd orders at Starbucks as the celebrities–that would be novel.\n\nDecent content creators are typically good at one of these three pillars. It’s the overlapping regions of the Venn Diagram, however, where very good and great content creators are found. The very good ones can be identified in the overlapping spaces of two pillars. And the great ones can be found in the overlapping space of all three pillars.\n\nSo, who are they?\n\nThe Very Good Content Creators\n\nOverlap 1: deep, relevant, but not novel\n\nThe first category of very good content creators is the overlap of those creators whose content is both deep and relevant, but not novel. In most cases, these content creators appeal to wider audiences because their content showcases ideas or discussions that most of us care about or are at least somewhat interested in. These creators also typically offer unique and incisive insight in their content.\n\nThe content and its presentation, however, are not necessarily novel. Product reviews, styling inspiration, fashion advice, and art are typical examples of this: they can be incisive and unique but not novel.\n\nI love fashion, so I follow a few content creators whose Instagrams and YouTube channels are great examples of this intersection. Nick Wooster, for instance, has been a popular style icon among men because he seamlessly achieves depth and relevance in his content. Insta photos of well-dressed men are not in any way novel, but Wooster offers something unique: cool and youthful sense of style against the backdrop of his admirable physique. And, that’s the catch. While the content itself is nothing new, Wooster’s personality and his curation of outfits offer something far more incisive—an underlying affirmation for young guys around the world that one can still turn heads, even in their sixties.\n\nOther two creators I follow are Olaf Hernandez and Gallucks, two younger guys who take a distinctly futuristic approach to streetwear. As a result, while they are not relevant to the wider male audiences as much as Wooster is, they have quickly become an endless source of inspiration for city dwellers.\n\nHernandez, in particular, has a great eye for curating looks across the entire color spectrum, playing with exaggerated and contrasting silhouettes, showing how the neo-Y2K style can look refreshingly sexy. Gallucks takes a completely different approach; his outfits are usually far more monochromatic and reminiscent of underground London and Berlin clubbing scenes, but they are not replicas of those nightlife uniforms. The outfits instead take a far more bionic and far more approachable tone. On top of that, you can also find him on YouTube giving well-argued reviews of footwear, clothing, and fashion scenes across the world.\n\nThese guys are clearly not doing anything novel. But their talent, eye for quality, and sense of style put them above the rest and add depth to the endless universe of fashion content.\n\nOverlap 2: relevant, novel, but not deep\n\nThe second category of very good content creators is the overlap of those creators whose content is both relevant and novel, but not deep. What that means is that these creators will typically not offer any unique or incisive insight in their content, but their content is usually relevant to larger masses and is presented in a refreshing, unorthodox way. My hypothesis is that this overlap tends to be the easiest target for criticism because “anyone could do it.” Which is, by all means, not the case.\n\nOne of my favorite content creators who falls in this category is Amelia Dimoldenberg, English journalist and content creator, known for her YouTube series Chicken Shop Date. If you haven’t seen it, the premise is very simple: Amelia and a celebrity guest meet up for a date at a place that you would most likely never choose for a first date—a chicken shop.\n\nNow, some versions of this premise existed previously in American MTV shows, but what’s really novel about Dimoldenberg’s approach is that the final cuts of the episodes are quick, snappy, cringey, deadpan, and for the most part, actually have nothing to do with dating itself.\n\nAnd, it’s absolutely relevant. Maybe you’re a Rosalía fan? You’ll enjoy the episode in which Rosalía tells Dimoldenberg she’s going to be her wingwoman while Dimoldenberg tries to break down what “peng” and “leng” stand for in English slang. Or maybe you don’t care for Rosalía but love Daniel Kaluuya? Then watch Dimoldenberg try to seduce him using zero facial expressions. Or maybe you’d rather witness Shania Twain’s chaotic mom energy while in a chicken shop? That’s an episode too.\n\nYou won’t learn anything new about these celebrities when watching Chicken Shop Date. But, the episodes are absurdly entertaining and strategically unconventional, which will catch your attention even if you have seen many other interviews with these celebrities before. So, don’t immediately discredit it. You try coming up with deadpan questions for different celebrities that will feel equally disarming and alarming. It’s not easy.\n\nOverlap 3: deep, novel, but not relevant\n\nThe third category of very good content creators is the overlap of those creators whose content is both deep and novel, but not relevant. My opinion is that these creators get the shorter end of the stick in the online hustle game. They are typically a refreshing addition to the online world, because they offer unique insights and because they present novel content or at least existing content in a novel way, but because their content doesn’t appeal to the masses, their fandom doesn’t have as much expansion potential.\n\nOne of my favorite content creators in this category is AJayII, a YouTuber who produces videos of her live reactions to albums and songs, typically pop or hip hop. She has attained a cult following within the online music community for her genuine and formidably analytical reviews of music releases. While not musically trained, she is able to recognize quality and deconstruct that quality in a very accessible way for her viewers.\n\nI loved, for example, that she amusingly kept complaining about Sia’s lacking enunciation in her reaction video to 1000 Forms of Fear or that she couldn’t stand Ariana Granda’s sweetener. She is certainly a deep content creator. I also think her method of evaluating music is novel; I don’t know whether other creators were recording live album reactions before her, but AJayII was the first content creator I discovered who was listening to the albums for the first time and reacting to them realtime instead of producing a post-mortem album review.\n\nThe catch is that only music aficionados actually listen to whole albums and care about the contextual significance of the album’s songwriting, production, and art direction. For that reason, someone like AJayII will probably not seem like a relevant content creator to a person who only occasionally enjoys listening to music.\n\nThe Great Content Creators\n\nThe full overlap: deep, relevant, novel\n\nAnd, for the grand finale, we reach the full overlap. The great content creators can be found at the overlap of all three pillars. They are deep, they are relevant, and they are novel. This is by far the hardest space to reach, and I think getting there is a combination of talent and timing. Who are these unicorns?\n\nThere’s quite a few of them out there but my two favorite are Emma Chamberlain and Nikkie de Jager-Drossaers, more commonly known as NikkieTutorials.\n\nBy this point, Emma Chamberlain has become a celebrity herself, but even before her meteoric rise, her content was pushing boundaries. I remember discovering her for the first time and being initially dismissive, then intrigued, and then absolutely amazed. She was relevant. She talked about anything and everything, from existential life crises to the driest minutiae of her routine, which was also the first time I understood what “relatable” meant—I actually could relate to her!\n\nHer style of recording and editing videos was absolutely refreshing to me, maybe even initially a bit disorienting but certainly catchy and addictive. And, while most people will say that there is nothing deep about what she does, I think Chamberlain’s content is anything but shallow. Just watch the video in which she drives around LA on a Monday, trying out different coffees, and offering amusingly entertaining and yet very incisive reviews that capture the misery of wanting to branch out only to realize that you just want to stick to the coffee you already know and love.\n\nEveryone can do it, right? I really don’t think so. Just observe the people in your own life, or even yourself, and ask who would actually spend a day passionately trying out different coffees and getting absolutely absorbed in such mundane adventure?\n\nNikkie de Jager-Drossaers is a Dutch makeup artist who rose to fame with her YouTube makeup tutorials. Makeup instructions are not necessarily novel, but what de Jager-Drossaers was doing with her videos was absolutely groundbreaking at the time: essentially reverse-engineering celebrities’ makeup and then engineering them back for her viewers. I would also say her novelty then increased even more once she became more known and started having famous people on her channel, like Lady Gaga and Adele. To see public figures appear willingly without makeup and get transformed by a makeup artist was a huge milestone in our celebrity culture.\n\nde Jager-Drossaers’ depth is unquestionable. You don’t need to understand makeup or even be interested in it to realize that she is definitely an artist. You could make an argument that relevance of her content is more gender-specific, but as the boundaries of gender expression have been relaxed over the last decade, many guys have also become more appreciative of makeup. As a result, someone like de Jager-Drossaers has become one of the defining content creators of the 2010s and early 2020s.\n\nWhat both Chamberlain and de Jager-Drossaers prove is that occupying the space of full overlap in the Venn diagram is certainly a matter of timing, especially as it relates to novelty. But it’s important to note that novelty can’t be intentionally timed, and neither Chamberlain nor de Jager-Drossaers finetuned their rise according to some obscure calendar of success. What did happen is that both of them, being talented and hard-working and innovative, came a time when culture needed them the most. And they seized the opportunity to push cultural boundaries.\n\nSo, the formula to being a great content creator, I would say at least, is very clearly defined. What goes into that formula, on the other hand, whether that is depth or relevance or novelty, is most certainly not something that everyone can do. It requires a lot of talent, it requires a lot of hard work, and it requires a bit of luck and a bit of opportune timing.\n\nI grew up in a family that loves perfumes. Some of my earliest childhood memories are those of my mom going out with my dad to formal social events in the winter, wearing this unusual, glamorous earthy scent that I had no way of describing as a child but that vividly encapsulated my mom’s personality. Powerful and loving but also enigmatic and defiant.\n\nMy grandma, who was always dressed in bright pastel colors, wore sweet, floral, and powdery perfumes. They suited her because she herself was ebullient, theatrical, melodramatic, but also non-confrontational. And, even my dad, who isn’t one to spend time overanalyzing beauty products, allowed my mom to choose a small collection of colognes for him—often spicy, balsamic, and a bit woody—that complemented his warm but strong-willed nature.\n\nMy brother and I, as a result, got exposed to this hobby early on and learned to appreciate the art of perfume-wearing. I wasn’t aware this contextual education was happening, but as I got older and as my collection grew, my friends would point out that it was unusual I had so many perfumes, and that I had strong opinions on when and which perfume to wear. To me, of course, it wasn’t unusual because this had always been a thing in my family.\n\nInterestingly, I only realized later that my way of deciding when to wear which perfume was very different from that of my family. While my mom, for example, can instantaneously break down each perfume into top, middle, and base notes, which somehow tell her when to wear it, my mind thinks very mathematically. When I first try on a perfume, I see an image in my head, one that I can clearly contextualize with the help of time, temperature, and weather. And then, my mind translates those features to math.\n\nThat math is something that I regularly use to choose which perfume to wear, and something that I think can bring a lot of ease to everyone’s decision-making.\n\nThe 3D Cartesian coordinate system for perfumes\n\nFor me, each perfume can be a placed in a three-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system, where the x axis represents the time of day, the y axis represents external temperature, and the z axis represents precipitation.\n\nOn the x axis, we move from day to night. On the y axis, we move from hot to cold. And, on the z axis, we move from clear to rainfall. I make the z axis simplified on this chart because I usually consider any form of precipitation, rain or snow, at the “rainfall” end of the spectrum.\n\nNow, when we talk about Cartesian coordinate systems, we have to have some form of numbers represented on these axes to describe position.\n\nFor simplicity, I like to imagine that each axis is bounded by —1 and 1 as the terminal points. What that means is that on the x axis, just as an example, —1 would represent the late night and 1 would represent the early morning, just after sunrise. On the y axis, on the other hand, we can imagine that —1 would mean really cold weather and 1 would mean really hot weather.\n\nKeep in mind that these terminal points on each axis are directional at best; they are not mapped to the exact magnitude of these situations in real-life scenario. In other words, when I say 1 on the y axis, I don’t think of it as boiling-level temperature, but instead as just the regular summer heatwave.\n\nYou can start to place various points in this space and identify what they would mean in real-life scenario. For instance, what would the origin O with x = 0, y = 0, z = 0 mean?\n\nFor the x axis, that would refer to twilight, that majestic moment between the day and the night. Though, in the context of perfume-wearing, I am really referring to the time just after sunset, because I could not imagine myself waking up and timing perfumes before sunrise.\n\nFor the y axis, that would refer to the perfectly moderate, mild temperature of the environment that’s neither hot nor cold, which for my body is 21°C or 70°F.\n\nFinally, for the z axis, that would mean the classically cloudy day, when you are not able to see the sun at all but there is also no rain or snow.\n\nTogether, that would imply that the origin O would represent a moderate 21°C or 70°F cloudy day, just after sunset. Who thought that dreadful high school math would turn out to be actually applicable?\n\nMy favorite perfumes in the 3D Cartesian coordinate system\n\nLet’s see how some of my favorite perfumes can be described in a 3D Cartesian coordinate system. I picked out the three that I think are very different in their olfactory composition and intended use: Fahrenheit by Dior, Un Jardin sur le Nil by Hermès, and Yatagan by Caron.\n\nFahrenheit was a cologne that I discovered in 2018 and instantly fell in love with. The moment I smelled it, I knew it was a statement scent. Spicy, citrusy, woody, and leathery, with a prominent underlying note of gasoline, I instantaneously saw myself wearing it when going out at night, wearing a punk-inspired jacket, black leather boots, a sweater or a shirt with skull imagery.\n\nSo, my mind translated that imagery to: late night, crisp cold but not freezing weather, and clear skies—because I don’t do rainy nightlife. Mathematically, I therefore assign Fahrenheit to point DF in space with coordinates x = —1, y = —0.5, and z = 1.\n\nUn Jardin sur le Nil was one that I was introduced to by my mom. I distinctly remember seeing her wear it in springtime, often when she had to attend a work lunch, when she would also sport a sophisticated, chic outfit. At the same time, the perfume with its floral and citrusy notes, mango being the most prominent one, gave her a playful edge.\n\nAs a result, my mind always associated this one with an image of a gentle but playful butterfly, flying on a bright day, in peak spring, when it’s usually clear with maybe an occasional spring rain that gives even more life to all the beautiful nature around us. Mathematically, I therefore assign Un Jardin sur le Nil to point HN in space with coordinates x = 1, y = 0.35, and z = 0.75.\n\nYatagan I discovered while reading an interview with the incredible Iris Apfel. She mentioned that she and her husband Karl used the same perfume by Caron, which was not very popular at the time. After some research online, and perusing many people’s reviews, I found it for a very reasonable price and decided to do a blind buy. I have always been such a fan of Iris, I figured she must know if something is good.\n\nI remember opening the box when it came and seeing this amber, chic-looking perfume bottle with dark-red letters spelling out Yatagan (later on, I learned it was a type of Ottoman knife) in a font that very much reminded me of the Prince of Persia video games.\n\nThe first whiff gave me strong wood and forest imagery. I liked it. I imagined myself walking through a dense forest on a fall day, stepping on freshly fallen autumn leaves, damp from all the rain, which accentuated the smell of the surrounding pine trees. Mathematically, I therefore assign Yatagan to point CY in space with coordinates x = 0.25, y =— 0.5, and z = —0.8.\n\nEach perfume that I discovered or was introduced to was therefore always followed by an initial imagery, which I could always describe using the time of day, external temperature, and precipitation. My mind would then map the components of this imagery to a three-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system.\n\nAnd that’s how I ended up with a list of all my favorite perfumes with their x, y, and z coordinates. Whenever I have to decide which perfume to wear, I observe what the day is like and consult my little database of coordinates.\n\nUsing the 3D coordinate system to group perfumes by their vibe\n\nWhat’s cool and fun about placing perfumes in a 3D coordinate system is that we can calculate the distance between two perfumes. This distance is what my mind sees as the difference in their “vibe”.\n\nBecause this 3D coordinate system has contextual significance, with each axis representing something that we experience with our senses, the proximity of perfumes in this space tells us that they elicit a similar… well, for lack of better word, vibe.\n\nThat distance can be calculated using the well-known equation for calculating the distance between two points in a three-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system. The larger the distance, the greater the difference in vibe.\n\nFor orientation, it’s useful to identify the smallest possible distance dmin and the greatest possible distance dmax between two points. The smallest distance is obviously zero. The greatest distance is less obvious, so we actually need to calculate it. The formula above shows that the greatest distance will happen for points P1 (1, 1, 1) and P2 (—1, —1, —1), whose distance in vibe is 3.46.\n\nIn my personal collection, as seen in the tables above, Terre d’Hermès Eau Tres Fraiche has coordinates x = 1, y = 1, z = 1. I don’t, however, have any perfumes that have x = —1, y = —1, and z = —1. The closest perfume to that theoretical point P2 is Promise by Frederic Malle, with coordinates x = —1, y = —1, and z = —0.4.\n\nThese two perfumes are indeed almost the complete opposites. Their vibes are very different.\n\nTerre d’Hermès Eau Tres Fraiche is a pleasant, zesty, inoffensive summer fragrance that’s perfectly suited for a day on a boat, wearing a light, breezy white shirt, white chinos, and beige espadrilles.\n\nPromise is a bold, risky, and very divisive scent that I can pull off only when I am feeling incredibly confident and even a bit cheeky. It’s sexy, intoxicating, and frustrating. It juxtaposes rosy, woody, and spicy notes, which means it rebels. And rebelling means it’s not a crowd-pleaser, so I wear it only when I feel really good about myself.\n\nIt can be hard to visualize how vibe relates to mathematical distance, so let’s plot two perfumes, Fahrenheit and Un Jardin sur le Nil, that we placed previously in the 3D space and calculate the distance between them.\n\nLooking at the chart, we can see that these two perfumes also have a decent distance between them, which means we should expect that the math would tell us the difference in their vibe is high—not 3.46 maybe, the greatest possible distance, but at least somewhat high.\n\n2.19 is a solid distance! And that number correctly shows how I—and, I imagine, many other owners of both perfumes—feel about their opposing vibes. Fahrenheit is a gritty nightlife perfume, while Un Jardin sur le Nil is a sophisticated, garden party perfume. They are, however, brought closer together in space by being best suited for days with clear skies, which is why their distance in vibe is not as high as 3.46.\n\nFinal thoughts\n\nNailing down the art of knowing when and which perfume to wear is a fun and rewarding undertaking. I always enjoy learning how others choose their perfumes and how their minds analyze them.\n\nIf you are someone who is not into perfumes, but would like to know more, I recommend starting with Fragrantica. It’s like an encyclopedia of all perfumes out there, and a wonderful place to learn the major names in perfumery, to understand how others choose perfumes for their collections, and to pick up all the cool incisive vocabulary that will help you describe olfactory experiences in a far more nuanced way.\n\nOpening thoughts\n\nNow that we have entered a new decade, I wanted to reconstruct my last ten years using the music I discovered in this period. What I really wanted to do with this is understand how my taste in music evolved.\n\nI heard a lot of music over the last decade, but only some of it shaped my world and followed me as I (apparently) became an adult in different corners of the world: Mostar, Boston, Berlin, and San Francisco.\n\nSo, here’s what my life—and evolution of taste in music—looked like over the last ten years, told through the albums, extended plays, and singles that I will cherish forever.\n\nEarly 2010s\n\nStarting with the year 2010, my first discovery of the decade was Janelle Monáe’s The ArchAndroid (2010) album. I was a high school junior at the time and, naturally, had nothing to do but to listen to this record. It was a piece of work that was unquestionably a fantastic prelude to the year. Not only was it the first time that I was hearing a concept album, but it was also the first time I was listening to so many genres at once, from hip-hop and R&B to rock and classical. Through just those 18 tracks, the album expanded my music taste faster than years of listening to other records ever did. “Suite II Overture”, “Dance or Die”, “Faster”, “Suite III Overture”, and “BaBopByeYa” to this day remain some of my favorite pieces of contemporary music.\n\nThen came the season of taking SATs and applying to colleges, which meant I spent very little time paying attention to music. When that unnerving period was finally over, I found out that Adele re-emerged with a new single “Rolling in the Deep” (2010) and that Hercules & Love Affair came out with a new album, which had a fantastic track called “My House” (2011). I listened to both tracks incessantly. Although the songs now remind me of anxiously waiting for college decisions, they hold a special place in my heart. Adele’s song was reminiscent of Amy Winehouse’s writing, and Hercules & Love Affair’s track was, looking back, probably my first independent discovery of house music. I would only learn later — after moving to the US and watching Paris is Burning — what “My House” was about, so I like to see this discovery as my prescient cultural enlightenment.\n\nThen, in the spring of 2011, my life turned upside down when I found that I was actually moving to United States to attend MIT. Overwhelmed with both excitement and utter fear, I buried myself in music to cope with these conflicting feelings. Thankfully, many artists that year timed their album releases to be on schedule with my emotional turmoil, so I had plenty of material.\n\nPlanningtorock’s W (2011) album was the first on the list. I discovered the predecessor Have It All (2007) in 2009 and thought it was one of the most ridiculous and spectacular records I’ve ever heard. I expected the same type of loony production on the new album, but W subverted all my expectations. It took me a few weeks to get used to it, and once I did, I fell in love with the haunting yet funky musical arrangements of songs like “The One”, “The Breaks”, “Jam”, and “9”. The lyrics in the last one, “9”, for some reason left a strong impression on me and became an emblem of this period in my life.\n\nOn the same day of W’s release in May, GusGus came out with their album Arabian Horse (2011). The eponymous song from this record amazed me. It was a hypnotic dance track that immediately sent me to a place of deep introspection upon first hearing it. The chorus line “too bright to even the sun, more and more sand in my eyes” felt like the perfect description of my afternoons that summer: spent daydreaming and in thoughts of what my life would look like from now on.\n\nIn June, I discovered PJ Harvey’s songs “The Glorious Land” (2011) and “The Words That Maketh Murder” (2011). M.I.A. was the only artist in my arsenal at that point whose lyrics I could label as political, so hearing PJ Harvey tackle topics of militarism through folk music felt like an enhancement of my taste. Her songwriting was particularly impressive; I admired how vividly she portrayed the futility and malevolence of war through piercingly detached lyrics. Listening to her interviews about the parent album Let England Shake also helped me realize that writing music with political connotations required maturity and tact.\n\nAt the end of August, I left Europe and moved to Boston. The following year was a time of emotional growth, rapid cultural assimilation, and new friendships, all of which were accompanied by changes in my music taste as well. It was hard to discern this at the time, but it’s a causality that I can clearly see only a decade later, which is that the new environment and people had a profound impact on what type of music I was drawn to.\n\nI was listening to a lot of Florence and the Machine’s Ceremonials (2011), Grimes’ Visions (2012), and Yelle’s Safari Disco Club (2011), which all differed in genre, but had one common denominator: nostalgic undertones, either through plaintive lyrics or downtempo production. My guess is that I was drawn to these as a result of my own bewilderment while I was trying to wrangle who I was in a new culture, far away from everything I used to know.\n\nThe one album that I distinctly associate with this period is Kelis’ Flesh Tone (2010). I remember first hearing “Intro”, “Home”, and “Emancipate” during a cold January afternoon and thinking how unusual it was to hear dance music that sounded so wintry and futuristic. Kelis did a great job of creating a cohesive concept album⁠ — the record was largely about motherhood⁠ — that reaffirmed how important it was for me to see a personalized and crystallized narrative in the music.\n\nAs I settled into my new life in Boston, there was an extended period of time in 2012 during which I drifted away from music. Like every college student, I learned that I didn’t know how to study and that I had to unlearn all my fruitless high-school habits. That process took almost a year. During this arduous time, the only two new songs that got on my radar were Jessie Ware’s “Running” (2012) and Róisín Murphy & David Morales’ “Golden Era” (2012). Together with Kelis’ and Grimes’ albums, these songs were starting to push my taste toward electronic music. And, although they now evoke memories of exam-driven anguish, they were all instrumental in preparing me for more energetic music that would come my way in the following years.\n\nIt was really 2013 when I started to feel truly settled in Boston. I was a college junior at that point and had started writing for the campus newspaper, which meant I was going to concerts with friends, interviewing artists, and listening to music on a more regular basis. I loved all of it. This exhilarating period was marked by Julia Holter’s “Horns Surrounding Me” (2013), Nils Frahm’s “Went Missing” (2013), Janelle Monáe’s The Electric Lady (2013) album, and MØ’s Bikini Daze EP. At the time, I thought these choices were undeniably sporadic and disconnected; Holter’s highly-experimental “Horns Surrounding Me” and Frahm’s classical “Went Missing” had no similarity to Monáe’s and Ørsted’s upbeat R&B and pop albums. In what seemed to be a typical pattern in my life, I would only learn later how a Berlin-based artist, affinity toward experimental production, and uptempo music would come together in a very formative period ahead of me.\n\nMid 2010s\n\n2014 was probably the most important year in shaping my music taste after 2009. In the spring, I saw St. Vincent perform at The House of Blues in Boston, and fell in love with her eponymous St. Vincent (2014)album. Rock music was never really my go-to choice, but this record had enough eccentric crossover into other genres, making it easy for me to rediscover my appreciation for more vigorous music after living in mellower genres for much of the early 2010s.\n\nRight around that time, tUnE yArDs’ Nikki Nack (2014) album came out as well, and it was the perfect complement to the euphoric St. Vincent’s album. I felt experimental overtones in each track, and the more I listened to the record, the more fascinated I became with songs that eschewed typical pop structures, such as “Left Behind” and “Real Thing”. To this day, listening to these two tracks along with St. Vincent’s “Huey Newton” and “Psychopath” remains my remedy for any sluggishness.\n\nLooking back, discovering these two albums that year was paramount because they pushed me to embrace more energetic music. Over the summer, while doing an internship in Berlin and naturally discovering the city’s incredible nightlife, I got completely captivated by such genre: techno. It was, ironically, during one afternoon in July that I remembered seeing Holly Herndon perform as opener for St. Vincent earlier that year in Boston and then thinking “Maybe I’d actually enjoy listening to her music now that I am in Berlin?”\n\nHer track “Chorus” (2014) suddenly became so magical and led me to discover her track “Fade” (2013), which then led me to discover Paula Temple’s track “Colonized” (2013), which then somehow led to enjoying Hercules and Love Affair’s The Feast of the Broken Heart (2014) album, which led to discovering John Grant’s “Pale Green Ghosts” (2013) track, eventually leading to Röyksopp and Robyn’s Do It Again (2014) EP. These releases marked my summer and were pivotal in expanding my taste.\n\nI spent the rest of my time in Berlin riding the U-Bahn for three to four hours each weekend, listening to nothing but electronic music, particularly to techno and house. I knew I always enjoyed some flavors of electronic music, especially by being a fan of artists and bands like M.I.A. and Moloko, but that was the first time I was loving club-oriented electronic music: instrumental and repetitive, something I thought I would never enjoy.\n\nThe penchant for electronic music continued throughout the year. In October, while back in Boston and once again enduring the city’s dreadful winter, I discovered Róisín Murphy’s Mi Senti (2014) EP. It was the first semblance of any real work from her after Overpowered, and I was nothing short of impressed. Soft vocals and lyrics half-spoken over hypnotic production certainly reminded me of Grace Jones, but there was something uniquely magical about this EP. It felt sparse and magical, one could even say otherworldly. I ended up so deeply embedded in this type of music that I kept longing for new releases without any rich sounds. This was paradoxical given that the year started with two albums that were anything but minimalist in production.\n\nIt wasn’t until the summer of 2016 — which meant finishing my undergraduate program and getting through the first year of my graduate program — that I came across two monumental releases that would pull me out of this reflective vortex: Annie’s Endless Vacation (2015) EP and Christine and the Queens’ eponymous (2015) debut album. Annie’s EP served as the perfect transition from the Berlin-driven obsession with electronic music to a much-needed rediscovery of pop music. This shift allowed me to appreciate every layer of Christine and the Queens’ album, a record that showed me how equally energizing and heartbreaking dance-pop music can be. It was after listening to this album on repeat for almost three months that I realized why that was the case. Because of the lyrics. Not just any lyrics, but well-thought-out and personal lyrics.\n\nSo much of the decade up until that point was marked by appreciation for music with refreshing production, but I suddenly found myself looking for novelty in the artists’ songwriting. It took two years from that moment to find a release that would completely floor me with lyrical content.\n\nLate 2010s\n\nIn 2017, I moved to San Francisco from Boston for my first full-time job. St. Vincent’s “Los Ageless” came out that fall and was very quickly followed by her album Masseduction. Needless to say, the record quickly became the soundtrack to California, my new-found home. I was still, however, subconsciously looking for an album or EP that would elevate the bar of high-quality songwriting.\n\nJust as I settled into my new routine in San Francisco and stopped yearning for such discovery, Lorde’s Melodrama (2017) somehow found its way to my Spotify library in the spring of 2018. It really didn’t take long to notice the depth of the songwriting on this album. “Sober” and “Sober II (Melodrama)” were immediate standouts, and I particularly enjoyed the visceral portrayal of love, loneliness, and friendship in her Greek theater-inspired, hyperbolized songwriting. The lyrics were personal and direct yet so relatable and sophisticated.\n\nWith the exception of Amy Winehouse’s Back to Black album, this was really the only record that convinced me songwriting could indeed be a form of poetry. Even beyond that, Lorde’s work felt synesthetic: melodies would conjure up colors, the artwork would conjure up sounds, and the lyrics would conjure up my own memories, packed with scents of previous springs and falls. It was undoubtedly a modern-pop masterpiece and I will forever associate it with my first year in San Francisco.\n\nAfter that ensued an album-burnout period during which I couldn’t listen to full-length records anymore. I nonetheless fell in love with a few singles that molded my taste, this time away from songwriting as the focus. I discovered Nipplepeople’s “Frka” (2017), an outstanding cover of Zdenka Kovačiček’s eponymous single from 1984. Their electropop rendition was by far one of the most unique productions I’ve seen arise from the Croatian music scene, and it led me to revisit many of the excellent Croatian bands that I didn’t listen to in a while, from E.T. to Yammat.\n\nFew months afterwards, Nicki Minaj’s “Queen” dropped and I instantaneously registered “Ganja Burn,” “LLC,” and “Good Form” as tracks that would end up on my playlists. This was a surprising transition in my taste that year given that I haven’t listened to much hip-hop in 2010s at all. The low-key and evocative production coupled with Nicki’s poised flow somehow suited my mood that summer, making Queen a pleasant discovery of 2018. I didn’t know it at the time, but this particular record made me more open toward trap music, which would resurface in my playlists next year.\n\nI quit my job that fall and was left with a lot of time to listen to music. Luckily for me, Robyn’s Honey (2018) came out at the end of October and the timing couldn’t have been better. “Send to Robin Immediately” really moved me; the meticulous build-up and softness of the production were unlike anything I’ve heard before. I could definitely feel influences of mellower house music, like DJ Koze’s “XTC”, in her songs, but there was something so vulnerable about Robyn’s approach toward these tracks that made the record truly original.\n\nMy mood was heavily shaped by Honey in late 2018, leading me to soon enjoy Emina Jahović’s Dalje (2018) album. This was also an unexpected gem: I am typically not in touch with Serbian music scene, but the Balkan-esque pop-house production and despondent lyrical themes were just the right sequel to Robyn’s album. Interlaced with these two releases, Soap&Skin’s “Italy” and “(This is) Water” (2018) were two tracks that left a mark on this period as well. Both albums and both songs were united by a pronounced sense of artists’ vulnerability and wistful introspection. Looking back, they reflected my state of my mind that fall as well, which would probably explain why I was drawn to all of them.\n\nIn January 2019, I started a new job. It took me a while before I had a new routine figured out, one in which I had enough time to listen to music. Once I did, Senidah’s “Aman” (2019) came as the first major discovery, and for me, it was a genuine shift in taste⁠ — I never thought I’d be obsessed with a Slovenian trap and R&B track. It was Nicki Minaj’s Queen from 2018 that made me more appreciative of this music. I’m glad that it did because “Aman” has now become a quintessential summer track, often reminding me of slow and reflective Croatian summers.\n\nThat August, I was working on a demanding project at work and ended up on Resident Advisor’s playlists in search of techno music that would help me focus. At some point, a catchy track started playing featuring a repetitive “Work, work it, work to be a winner” chant, which halted all my efforts to concentrate. The song ended up being the gateway track to Marie Davidson’s Working Class Woman (2018) album.\n\nIf the album had come out while I was still a student, I wouldn’t have fully understood the highly personal and relatable undertones of this layered techno record. It left an imprint on the rest of 2019, and I spent much of the fall and winter listening to “La chambre intérieure”, “Burn Me”, and “Work It” (as well as her unbeatable standalone single “Chasing the Light”). These tracks reinvigorated my love for techno and reminded me how introspective electronic music can be. Plus, I felt the entire album was the perfect soundtrack to my 9-to-5 routine.\n\nInspired by Davidson’s record, I dedicated the entirety of September, October, November, and December to electronic music. This meant I was — similar to my phase in Berlin — spending a large chunk of my free time researching and obsessing over new songs. Some of those incredible discoveries were Kelly Lee Owens’ “More Than A Woman” (2017), Klein’s “Claim It” (2019), Hiver’s “Pert” (2019), Asa Moto’s “Syriacid” (2017), and East of Ocean’s “Neverlasting Love” (2019). This time, however, to make myself feel more than just a consumer, I would also stay up late on work days and make music mixes using these new tracks.\n\nAt the turn of the new decade, as I unwinded from the monolithic stretch of electronic music, I then somehow stumbled upon Ariana Grande’s thank u, next (2019) album. I never paid attention to her as an artist, but this piece of work completely changed my opinion of her and made for a great last discovery of the 2010s. I was so impressed by the album’s cohesiveness despite it veering off into multiple genres, including pop, R&B, and trap. The most outstanding element of this record was its lyrical content, and I found myself analyzing other artists’ songs in greater detail after this album in hopes of finding equally personal writing.\n\nPerhaps even more importantly, this uplifting album came into my life just before the COVID-19 pandemic, giving me a much-needed mental preparation for the omnipresent anxiety that would soon perturb the world.\n\nClosing thoughts\n\nFrom the bittersweet years of cramming for exams to the harsh era of a global pandemic, music was clearly an indispensable piece of my life at each moment of the last decade.\n\nWriting this helped me realize that, despite new discoveries and many taste-breakers, my listening does seem to follow a consistent pattern—oscillating between introspection and extrospection across pop, R&B, electronic, and experimental genres. As I finished writing this, I also wondered: what music will the next ten years bring and how different will my taste be by 2030? Which memories will I associate that music with?\n\nI guess there’s only one way to find out.\n\n🕒 This essay is more than 5 years old (Published Apr 8, 2015).\n\nEvery day, each of us gives a live performance. That might seem like a presumptuous statement but I would argue that our everyday activities are indeed a form of subconscious performance art. This seemingly paradoxical concept can be demystified if we discuss such activities in terms of restored behavior.\n\nAccording to Richard Schechner, a renowned performance theorist, restored behavior is any set of “marked, framed, or heightened” habits, rituals, and routines of life. In other words, restored behavior signifies those actions—from simple gestures to ritual performances—that have become a part of our lives, but have become independent of the source that brought them to existence.\n\nWhat would be an example of that? In my life, and I think in the lives of many others, the act of smiling in day-to-day activities and encounters can be seen as an example of restored behavior. And that’s because, when we smile, we certainly can convey sincere and visceral feelings to others, but we also might smile to convey something that’s more calculated. What’s the difference?\n\nAs human beings, provided that we are not discussing cases of complete isolation, we are in constant communication with other people during our daily activities, habits, and rituals. Whether it’s simply the short-term process of making eye contact with a stranger on the street or sharing our intimate emotions with close friends or significant others, we regularly exchange both verbal and non-verbal means of communication.\n\nIt’s easy to assume that most of our physical reactions during communication are sincere and visceral, but the truth is that many of our gestures and expressions are programmed and dictated by external factors, such as cultural rules and societal pressure. Many, if not all, of these actions are restored behaviors—they exist as indispensable components of our personalities, yet they are completely detached from the inherent physical causes that would normally bring them to existence.\n\nAs Schechner describes in his essay on restoration of behavior, “even if I feel myself wholly to be myself, acting independently, only a little investigating reveals that the units of behavior that comprise me were not invented by me.” This does not mean that we are controlled or brainwashed by the society or other external factors; it simply means that we have subconsciously transformed our inherent gestures and reactions to channels of communication that convey our attitudes and establish our presence. Because of this, many of our everyday activities—such as smiling—can be understood as a restored behavior, and therefore as performance.\n\nSmiling is a facial expression that is an innate feature of all human beings. While the associations linked to the act of smiling vary culturally, in most cultures, smiling is perceived as a physical reaction that signifies joy and happiness or a physical expression that shows person’s amiability and demeanor.\n\nIn many cases, it is a result of state of content and happiness, which can be caused by various factors, such as a humorous movie, positive memories, dancing, and attraction to another person. However, the act of smiling can also be employed in situations that are not necessarily associated with content and happiness.\n\nFor example, in Western cultures, people often smile when shaking hands or posing for a photograph. Politicians and public speakers are commonly seen smiling during speeches and presentations even though these events are often anxiety-inducing and not something that would naturally make a person smile. In the latter case, it can be tempting to think that the act of smiling is fake, but instead, it should be identified as restored behavior, which is a crucial component of person’s everyday subconscious performance.\n\nIn my own life, smiling has become such an important part of my everyday communication that I often forget when I am sincerely pleased or genuinely happy. If I am buying lunch or shopping for clothes, in most cases I will smile to the cashier or the person in the store as they are likely to greet me with a smile as well. If I have to communicate with workers in government offices, such as the Social Security Office, I always talk with a smile on my face.\n\nWhy? I most certainly am not happy or pleased when I am filing documents for a new ID card or when I am in a hurry to grab lunch and run back to class. Still, I—and many other people—approach these situations with a smile because it is established that “a smile can open many doors.”\n\nWhat this truly means is that by employing a restored behavior and showcasing a unique, subtle type of performance, we are exercising amiability as means of facilitating communication, easing the tension, and ultimately—getting what we want.\n\nFor the beforehand mentioned cases, I am never particularly pleased or happy, but I always revert to the act of smiling because this framed and heightened behavior helps me reach the outcome of my desires.\n\nIn the case of buying lunch and clothes, smiling lets the other person know that I am an amiable person and that I am hoping for a good and helpful service. When I am smiling to the workers in government offices, I am hoping that my amiable demeanor will facilitate any required processes in these institutions and help me in case there is something wrong with my documentation. I am smiling not because I am content or happy, but because this restored behavior serves to showcase a delicate performance that conveys my attitude and personality traits to a person engaged with me in a two-way communication.\n\nThese examples support Schechner’s view of restored behavior: smiling in these situations has become completely independent of the original, physical source—happiness and sense of content—that would normally make a person smile. Instead, for the purpose of conveying a message and attaining a specific goal, smiling has become a framed and heightened behavior, employed in those situations that are not associated with the physical feeling of joy.\n\nInterestingly, in his essay, Schechner notes that restored behaviors vary enormously from culture to culture, but he doesn’t elaborate on this statement. It’s nonetheless important to address this phenomenon because restored behaviors are in many cases dictated by cultural norms and societal conventions, so it is natural to pose question about the validity of restored behavior across different cultures. To be precise, while smiling and amiability can be seen as one type of performance in my own life—because I have always lived in similar cultural environments—one might think that this performance would not be valid or sustainable in other cultures.\n\nFor example, in some Asian countries, smiling is used to conceal embarrassment or emotional pain or to represent confusion and anger. In some Eastern European cultures, smiling at strangers can be perceived as odd, suspicious, or even frightening. In these cases, is smiling still a restored behavior and does it constitute a performance act?\n\nEven though the act of smiling is associated with different interpretations in these particular cultures, it is still a restored behavior because it is independent of the inherent source that brings it to existence.\n\nMembers of specific Asian cultures will smile to detract attention from their actual feelings, so smiling is yet again used in instances where it wouldn’t be happening naturally. The example of Eastern European cultures might be trickier to understand, but the existence of restored behavior still applies. Here, we can view the lack of smiling as a restored behavior; that is, even if the sight of stranger on the street might evoke sincere physical feelings of happiness and joy, a person will purposefully avoid smiling to adapt to specific cultural norms.\n\nOf course, these opinions and statements can be seen as unsupported because the distinction between genuine act of smiling and smiling as restored behavior can be subjective and unclear. Just because I’m using the act of smiling as a way of adapting to a specific culture, how can I know that every other person is following the same mindset when smiling? What if someone has a genuinely joyful demeanor and their amiable interactions with other people are not shaped by cultural traditions?\n\nThis is once again a question that Schechner answers concisely in his essay by denoting that restored behavior is sometimes esoteric, privy only to the initiated. This statement can be interpreted from different perspectives, and one of them implies that restored behavior is not temporally universal.\n\nThe act of smiling can be sincere and brought to existence by natural, physical feeling of happiness, but it can also be used as a restored behavior, one which has become completely independent of its natural source. People will adopt this restored behavior as necessary; when the act of smiling is used to explore or adjust to a specific context, then the behavior can be understood as restored.\n\nIn my own life, I also smile when I genuinely feel joyful. In this case, the act of smiling is not a restored behavior because it was brought naturally to existence, and then the actual physical process is understood as an innate, involuntary, muscle-flexing reaction to a state of happiness. On the other hand, when I am smiling to convey my amiable attitude or establish my courtesy to another person, the act of smiling becomes a restored behavior.\n\nIn that sense, for any person, the genuine process of smiling and the act of smiling as a restored behavior can be temporally distinguished from each other. Smiling is a genuine behavior when it’s an involuntary physical reaction, but it’s a restored behavior when it is a voluntary or subconscious way of conveying a symbolic message to a person or a group of people.\n\nWith that clear framework in mind, the seemingly presumptuous statement that we all perform becomes acceptable. Each and every one of us performs in front of various audiences, from family and friends to acquaintances and strangers, and we engage in this performance act to use a framed and heightened behavior as a way of conveying a specific, symbolic message.\n\nIt can certainly sound a bit sinister to think our lives and gestures are “taken over,” as Schechner describes it, but if we just for a moment let go of the notion that everything we do is conscious, the truth becomes obvious. The act of smiling and many other everyday behaviors are indeed restored behaviors, and consequently are also continuous performance acts.\n\nCover photo is of Naomi Campbell, Christy Turlington, and Linda Evangelista, courtesy of Roxanne Lowit."
