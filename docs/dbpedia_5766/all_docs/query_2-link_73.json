        "text": "A 12-piece band with vocalists and horns to appear March 8\n\nThe brilliant, turbulent soul singer Amy Winehouse burned bright and flamed out quickly.\n\nShe triumphed at the 2008 Grammy Awards, winning song and record of the year, best pop vocal album and best new artist for her \"Back to Black\" album, her American debut, which was both acclaimed and popular.\n\nBut her talent was overshadowed by much-publicized battles with drugs and alcohol that kept Winehouse from touring the U.S. In 2011, at age 27, she died without releasing a followup.\n\nConsequently, Winehouse's treasure trove of retro-tinged songs -- including such instant classics as \"Tears Dry On Their Own,\" \"You Know I'm No Good\" and \"Rehab\" -- has not been experienced in live performance. Remember Jones, a vocalist based in Asbury Park, N.J., is aiming to change this.\n\nTouring the country with a 12-piece band including horns and female backup singers, Jones -- a man, incidentally -- is presenting full-bodied concerts of Winehouse music, including the entire \"Back to Black\" album, front to back, plus other Winehouse favorites including \"Valerie\" and uptempo ska numbers she covered.\n\nRemember Jones' traveling Winehouse celebration will roll into downtown Canton music club The Auricle on March 8. Here, Jones, whose real name is Anthony D'Amato, previews the Canton show.\n\nWE RE-CREATE THE WHOLE \"Back to Black\" album, and the somewhat hotly contested part of this thing on social media is that I sing the whole show, a male on lead vocals doing Amy Winehouse music. But what we do successfully is remove gender. If it was a woman singing, there'd be total comparisons to Amy. When people come to the show and they trust it, they like it a lot more. The point for me is it's not necessarily so much about Amy Winehouse as how you felt when you first heard this music for the first time. Calling it an Amy Winehouse tribute is a good way to sell some tickets, and in a way we are celebrating her. But it's really a celebration of her music.\n\nWHEN I FIRST HEARD \"Back in Black,\" I was a fan of the album before I was a fan of Amy Winehouse. I loved her voice for sure but I loved the music and I loved the production. I was right out of high school and it stunned me and my music-loving friends, and I was coming to it having been part of funk and soul bands and theater.\n\nI CALL MYSELF sort of a soul-rock singer. My main instrument is being an entertainer, an emcee of sorts, a storyteller. It's soul storytelling if that makes any sense.\n\nTHERE'S A LOT GOING ON with a 12-piece band. We've got three horns, three background vocalists who also take lead, drums, bass, guitar, we have a Hammond organ and full piano. The instruments are all time-appropriate. It's black suit, black tie, a very Dap Kings look.\n\nI SING THEM ALL in her (Winehouse's) register. The keys aren't changed. It becomes tricky because she was a one-of-a-kind vocalist. She would do these songs differently every night and I do as well. The performance is completely organic and in the moment. I'm performing for the audience. Amy wasn't strong at that because she was struggling with her illnesses at the time. With this show, you're not necessarily seeing a cover band. You're seeing a large, full band doing this authentically in a brand new way.\n\nLAST YEAR WE DID the show in 30 cities. We played the Beachland Ballroom in Cleveland, which is the kind of old venue that we love. The show's been a big hit for us in Chicago, Charleston, obviously New Jersey. We do really well in Brooklyn, 900 (people) at a time. This year we're going to California for the first time, playing in L.A.\n\nTHE SHOW IS TWO SETS. We open with a set of our original music. We have released a couple of albums, and we also sort of do our big soul spin on songs by Smashing Pumpkins, Fleet Foxes etc. Then we do the entire \"Back to Black\" album from start to finish, but we have definitely injected a lot of our own twists and turns. The last part of the show, Amy's B-sides, is a lot of ska music that becomes a big dance party. It's definitely a lot of fun and certainly one-of-a-kind.\n\nWE CONNECT with people who are not only music lovers but people who connected with Amy's music and lyrics. We have fans that are in tears afterward because they are enveloped in the sound. As long as the feeling comes across, nothing else really matters.\n\nReach Dan at 330-580-8306 or dan.kane@cantonrep.com\n\nOn Twitter: @dkaneREP\n\nWHAT: Back to Back to Black: Amy Winehouse tribute featuring Remember Jones.\n\nWHEN: March 8, 9 p.m.\n\nWHERE: The Auricle, 201 Cleveland Ave. NW, downtown Canton.\n\nTICKETS: $15 advance at Ticketweb.com, $20 day of show. All ages welcome.\n\nIN CONCERT"
