        "text": "No I am not trolling (unless stating real opinons is trolling)\n\nYes she is a good singer, I'm not denying that, but would she really be so popular if there wasn't all this press coverage about her alcohol and drug abuse?\n\nLets face it, all the stuff she did would probably have ruined her voice in a few years if she had lived.\n\nThere seems to be a lot of people who seem to have latched on to the Amy story just to seem popular\n\nIs it just me or is anyone else sick of hearing about her, and the publicity stunt of releasing a 'new' album just before Christmas?\n\nMaybe she isn't dead and is just trying to get the money! Then she will be resurected around Easter time!\n\nNobody thinks real opinions are ''trolling''. Setting up threads that will cause people to be idiots is, however.\n\nPeople get accused of trolling all the time when they say things other peeople don't agree with,\n\nYes, because she had a good (and distinctive) voice, good songwriting skills, a big personality and a great (very popular in public and in fashion) style. If anything, her problems made her less popular, and even before her death people were saying it was a wasted talent. There are plenty of forever unheard-of musicians who suffer from problems and never get any attention either way, so that's a silly assumption to make.\n\nIt is also true that many very talented artists with good voices, sonwriting skills and personality who don't do any drink drugs etc get nowhere as they get very little publicity\n\nIt could have, but it wasn't too much at the time. It was affecting her performance skills though, as the terrible European show demonstrated.\n\nIt wasn't too bad at the moment but it would definately have ruined her legacyI wouldn't say that. People have more sympathy for her, but I wouldn't say they've ''latched'' on to her story.\n\nReally, people didn't seem to be saying how wonderful she was before she died\n\nI'm sure there are other people ''sick'' of hearing about her, many artists release albums at Christmas for increased sales and she's DEFINITELY not the only artist whose posthumous releases have been sold this way. It's nice that some revenue is going to charity though.\n\nI do agree with the bit about charity, although maybe everything going to the charity set up in her name would be better\n\nNow that makes ME sick.:rolleyes:\n\nWell many people do seem to think she is the second coming!"
