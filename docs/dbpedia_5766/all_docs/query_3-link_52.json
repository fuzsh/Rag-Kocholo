        "text": "Anyone who knows me well will know of my love for SxSW which is taking place this week. I was lucky enough to attend Sx many times in the early 2000's quite a few years before the entire UK A&R brigade worked out it was a great place to find new talent and then a few years later to create a buzz for acts looking to break the UK. This might sound completely bananas but bands played SxSW (in Austin Texas in case you weren't sure) in order to get signed or 'discovered' by wait for it UK labels and media! The US labels were initially baffled by this but in the end they couldn't help themselves and joined in the fun, especially in those years between 2002-2008 when labels and media including the BBC were sending out teams in their droves. If I was to pick out just one highlight from all the years, it would have to be 2007 - when working at Island Records I pulled together a show at Bourbon Rocks on 6th Street that featured four artists all riding a crest of a wave and in Amy Winehouse a singer / songwriter that defined a generation. Amy, The Fratellis, Mika and Scott Matthews were all fabulous that sunny day in March. It was definitely an early career highlight and we owned Sx that year, thanks in no small part to our partners without which it wouldn't have happened at all . Andy Ashton and then Mike Walsh (across a number of years) at XFM , The Channel4 team and Yahoo all helped us get the artists over there in the first place (Island FD now UMG COO David Sharpe having rejected our cap in hand request, for what was to be fair to him a pretty sizeable budget!) and exposure for the event which had queues down the street and was the buzziest of the hundreds of shows which took place that year. Honourable mentions to Island partners in crime Mike Mooney, Phil Witts, Jon Turner and Glenn Cooper. To me that was a true partnership, artists, rights holders, media and brands coming together to facilitate something truly exceptional. Take 10 minutes out of your day and watch greatness in action. https://lnkd.in/eWN4jgh8 #sxsw #Amywinehouse"
