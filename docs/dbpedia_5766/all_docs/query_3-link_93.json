        "text": "Amy Winehouse Back to Black\n\nAmy Winehouse is an old soul who inspired a new sound in a modern age. She manipulated classical jazz with her hip-hop influences and her strong unique voice with lyrics from her life experiences. These factors made her music unique and inspiring. Sadly in July of 2011, Amy passed away at the young age of twenty seven, leaving behind her musical legacy. Back to Black is one of her most popular albums that shows off her beautiful voice and thoughtful composition. Due to its unique traits in modern music, it will continue to be played. This album is truly a work of art based on Amy's use of meaningful lyrics in her songs, her strong unique voice, and her particular take on jazz. I feel that Back to Black is an outstanding …show more content…\n\nI think this album is marvelous for a few reasons, one being her lyrics. The lyrics express struggles within Amy's life that can be considered controversial. Amy would express and confront her troubles in a fearless way within each song, which makes her music even more wonderful. In the documentary film, Amy, they quoted her saying, “I wouldn't write anything unless it was directly personal to me, just cause I wouldn't be able to tell the story right because I wouldn't have done it. Even though the songs are personal, in a sad way, I'd never let it just be that. I'd always put in a punch line in the song just trying to be different with my lyrics”(Winehouse). She spoke the truth and showed her sincere attitude, which made her vulnerable, but made her real and unique. Amy's main experience that effected the lyrics that she wrote was her ordeal with her ex husband Blake. Her experience with Blake was clearly shown in the song Back to Black when Amy sang “You went back to what you knew, so far removed from all that we went through”(Winehouse), which conveys the way Amy felt when Blake left her to go back to his girlfriend. Another reason why I believe this album is outstanding is due to Amy's powerful and distinctive voice. Her voice is strong and charismatic. Her vocal style compares to that of a sixties soul singer. Amy's tone and mood is expressed clearly through her voice. Even when she wasn't singing her lyrics, the sounds she made within her songs expressed the mood. “Her voice glints with possibility: tart, smoky, ready to flirt or sob, and capable of the jazzy timing of a Dinah Washington or the declamation of soul singers like Martha Reeves and Carla Thomas”(Pareles). The main reason why I find this album most successful is that there is no other album out there that sounds similar. “Ms. Winehouse has grown up on hip-hop’s version of R&B, which chops the old dramatic"
