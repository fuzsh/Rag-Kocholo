        "text": "What a deeply sad and utterly tragic waste of talent. When it comes to the premature deaths that crowd the dark iconography of pop culture (\"the Stupid Club\", as Kurt Cobain's mother called it), the death of Amy Winehouse at 27 is as bad as it gets.\n\nI watched her arrive on the scene as a young, fresh and feisty newcomer, just bursting with music and spirit. She quickly blossomed into a major musical star who changed the landscape of modern pop culture but wilted in the heat of the spotlight. She was an amazing musical artist, but also a deeply troubled soul. Sadly, the two all too often go hand in hand. Amy had talent to burn. Instead, it burned her.\n\nWhat is deeply shocking to me is that I thought she was winning this battle. I saw her in Abbey Road studio in March, singing a duet with Tony Bennett. She swept in late, surrounded by an entourage, and looked edgy and wary of strangers, but physically I thought she looked well. Her hair was big, her eye make-up almost Egyptian. Dressed in retro cardigan, mini-dress and big ear-rings, she was clearly sober, steady, and looked tanned and healthy. She had filled out since her scrawny, drug-addled worst.\n\nShe told me it was her first time in a studio in over a year, and she was quite obviously nervous, fiddling with her hair, shuffling her feet - but when she sang ... boy. Watching the old veteran and young ingenue together was extraordinary.\n\nThey stood side-by-side but wrapped their voices around each other, rising and falling, scatting and blending in jazzy cadences, as they worked up a version of Body and Soul.\n\nWinehouse spoke with the sulky eyes and dropped aitches of a bratty London teenager (\"It's gettin' there, innit?\" she said, after a few takes), and responded to production suggestions with a sniffy: \"All right, whateva!\"\n\nBut then she opened her mouth and out came this ancient, mature voice, like Dinah Washington blended with Billie Holiday.\n\nBennett was impressed, and told me she was as good as any singer he had worked with. Winehouse, for her part, had shown up because she was a fan.\n\n\"You're one of my idols,\" she said. \"I'm just happy to be here. It's a story to tell my grandchildren to tell their grandchildren to tell their grandchildren.\"\n\nThere will be no generations of grandchildren now, and the stories that will be told will not be happy ones.\n\nWinehouse embodied the best and worst of the music business, an exceptionally gifted artist brought low by the kind of self-destructive, hedonistic lifestyle that is such an integral part of the rock 'n' roll myth.\n\nLike her heroine Holiday, or the great Janis Joplin - exceptional singers who struggled with addiction in less media-saturated times - Winehouse became a poignant rather than a heroic figure, someone whose intensity of expression and tendency towards self-destruction seemed psychologically linked.\n\nThe terrible tragedy of Amy Winehouse is that none of this was inevitable. It never is. She could have come through it. Many addicts have recovered and gone on to live full and productive lives\n\nThere was, in truth, little hint of what was to come when she first appeared on the pop scene, in 2003. Then she just seemed incredibly precocious.\n\nThe progeny of a middle-class Jewish family from north London, Winehouse somehow contrived to sound like she was raised in the speakeasies of Chicago during Prohibition. Her grandmother was once engaged to Ronnie Scott, and Winehouse behaved as if smoky jazz clubs ran in her blood.\n\nThe divorce of her parents seemed to have hit her hard, but she remained close to both, and idolised her taxi-driving, Sinatra-singing father, Mitch.\n\nThere are suggestions she might have been a handful - she was expelled from the Sylvia Young Theatre School at 15 - and, although she briefly attended the BRIT School in Croydon, she never spoke as if her time there was either happy or productive. But she liked to sing, and could be found performing with jazz orchestras and swing bands, anyone who would give her a platform.\n\nThe first time I saw Winehouse perform live was in the basement of Pizza Express in Soho, in 2003. It was a more innocent time before the beehives and tattoos, before the release of her witty debut album Frank, later the same year. It was also long before the breakaway global success of Back to Black, and the well-documented personal problems that followed in one of the most spectacular falls from grace the modern music business has witnessed.\n\nWhen she began her recording career, Winehouse was just a great young singer-songwriter, with a set of smart, sassy, soulful original pop songs and some classic jazz standards. She was only 19, but even in an era when pop stars seem to keep getting younger, the almost preternatural combination of vitality and maturity of Winehouse was surprising.\n\nHer big, smoky, sensual voice sounds steeped in a century of jazz and soul, but her beats and attitude burst with the contemporary snap of a 21st-century urban teenager.\n\nShe was, by turns, dirty, flirty, funny, sarcastic, abusive, self-lacerating, heartbreaking and extraordinarily worldly wise.\n\n\"I'm not a great singer, yaknowotamean?\" she told me. \"People are very throwaway with their words these days. If someone comes out and they've got hoop earrings and a big bum, it's like, 'She's a diva!' You have to earn these things. Not from other people, from yourself. You have to earn your own respect.\"\n\nShe really earned it with the release of Back to Black in 2006, by which time she was already well on the path to self-destruction.\n\nMusically, she had embraced the girl group sounds of the '60s, but her lifestyle was lurching out of control, with drink and drugs and a short-lived marriage to Blake Fielder-Civil, a man who seemed every bit as troubled as her.\n\nHer fame grew in parallel with her addiction, until a UN drug czar was moved to condemn her as \"a poster girl for drug abuse\". It was unfair; if she was a poster girl for anything, it was her own suffering.\n\nPhotographed emaciated, bruised and bleeding, weeping over her jailed husband, slurring onstage, cancelling shows, her closely - and somewhat salaciously - documented journey from pop princess to barely functioning addict seemed more like a cautionary tale.\n\nShe may have sung \"No, no, no\" to rehab, but the celebratory defiance of that line was tempered by news that she had been in and out of rehab ever since.\n\nTwo years ago, a producer who had to abandon recording sessions with Winehouse, described her as \"a write off.\"\n\nThe terrible tragedy of Amy Winehouse is that none of this was inevitable. It never is. She could have come through it. Many addicts have recovered and gone on to live full and productive lives.\n\nAnd, what's more, she had the talent to make something amazing out of all her suffering.\n\nBut when you are a junkie, you really are one shot away from self-annihilation. But let's try not to remember her for this.\n\nThe Sunday Telegraph, London"
