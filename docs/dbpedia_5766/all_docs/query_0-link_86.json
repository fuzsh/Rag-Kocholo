Winehouse's 2003 debut album, Frank, was a critical success in the UK and was nominated for the Mercury Prize. Her 2006 follow-up album, Back to Black, led to five 2008 Grammy Awards, tying the then record for the most wins by a female artist in a single night, and made her the first British female to win five Grammys, including three of the general field \"Big Four\" awards: Best New Artist, Record of the Year and Song of the Year.\r\nWinehouse won three Ivor Novello Awards: in 2004, Best Contemporary Song for \"Stronger Than Me\"; in 2007, Best Contemporary Song again, this time for \"Rehab\"; and in 2008, Best Song Musically and Lyrically for \"Love Is a Losing Game.\" She won the 2007 Brit Award for Best British Female artist, having also been nominated for Best British Album, with Back to Black.\r\nWinehouse died of alcohol poisoning on 23 July 2011 at age 27.
