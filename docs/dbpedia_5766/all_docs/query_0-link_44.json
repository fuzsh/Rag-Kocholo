        "text": "She once struggled to get her debut album released, but south London singing sensation Raye has now cemented her place in pop’s hall of fame by winning a record-breaking six Brit awards.\n\nThey include Album of the Year, Artist of the Year and Song of the Year, giving her the biggest haul for a British act since the awards were launched in 1977.\n\nBefore Saturday night’s announcement the record for most Brits in a single year was four, held by Adele in 2016; Harry Styles in 2023; and Blur in 1995.\n\nIt is a sensational turnaround for Raye, who at one stage could not persuade her then record company to release her songs, forcing her to leave Polydor Records in December 2021 to work as an independent artist.\n\nThat move came with a tearful announcement on social media in which she described herself as: “Just a little Croydon girl with a dream.”\n\nThat dream has now found its fulfilment, with the 26-year-old, who was born in Tooting but grew up in Croydon, also winning Best New Artist, RnB Act and Songwriter of the Year.\n\nRaye, who grew up listening to R&B and soul acts such as Frank Ocean and Lauryn Hill, along with indie rock bands like Tame Impala and Bombay Bicycle Club, has also drawn inspiration from the likes of the classic blues and soul sound of Ella Fitzgerald and Nina Simone.\n\nBut the intimate subject matter of her songs, some of which deal with her struggles with body dysmorphia, addiction, eating disorder, and anxiety – as well as sexual assault – have also made her a chronicler of her time.\n\nShe had been described by some, including this newspaper’s music critic Neil McCormick, as the most gifted UK artist in her area since Amy Winehouse and Adele.\n\nFrom Rachel Keen to Raye\n\nBorn Rachel Keen she joined the BRIT School at 14, before dropping out after two years due to feeling “confined...despite learning an extensive amount”.\n\nRaye’s Ghanaian-Swiss mother worked mental health for the NHS and her Yorkshire father, worked for the insurance company Norwich Union. Both left their jobs to manage her, something she now says was just what she needed following her travails with the industry.\n\nRaye told The Sunday Times: “My mum’s seen it all in 30 years in mental health. My dad would go into companies, learn about them and set them goals. By fate, they’re brilliant for what I need.\n\n“Imposter syndrome is real – I know because I have it – but I’m an optimist. You need to be to survive in this game.”\n\nAfter being signed by Polydor at the age of 17 she enjoyed success with a series of dance singles, some alongside Little Mix, David Guetta and Ellie Goulding.\n\nWhen she left Polydor, Raye had a worldwide hit with her single Escapism and last year reached number two in the UK charts with her debut album, My 21st Century Blues.\n\nShe went on to give a bravura performance at the Royal Albert Hall in September last year, backed by the 50-piece Heritage Orchestra and 30-member Flames Collective choir, in a show which won her comparison to Fitzgerald and Shirley Bassey.\n\nIn other categories Dua Lipa, the English/Albanian singer who opened the awards ceremony at London’s The O2 arena on Saturday night, won Pop Act of the year, while Producer of the Year went to Chase & Status and Dance Act to Calvin Harris.\n\nKylie Monogue, who closed the awards ceremony, was named Brits Global Icon and Miley Cyrus won International Song with Flowers, in a year that saw an increased number of female artists among the nominations.\n\nThat followed criticism of last year’s awards, when there were no women nominated in the Best Artist category.\n\nArriving at this year’s awards, former X Factor star Rebecca Ferguson said she believes the music industry is changing. In September 2023, the Liverpool-born performer gave evidence at the Misogyny in Music inquiry in front of the House of Commons’ Women and Equalities Committee.\n\n‘Music industry is changing’\n\nSpeaking at the Brit Awards, she said: “I think 100% the music industry is changing... I think now there’s CIISA [the newly created Creative Industries Independent Standards Authority]....there’s finally going to be a place where people can report things and go for help.\n\n“I think the music industry is changing... But I do think that the music industry has been incredibly receptive, a lot of the major labels have come on board and took on feedback.\n\n“And I think we can only go up from here. I think I was a bit rowdy, maybe a bit loud online on Twitter, I shook the tree a little bit.... But you know what sometimes as women you’ve got to shake trees, we’ve got to be loud, and we’ve got to be really noisy, and cause a bit of mayhem for people to listen. And I think hopefully the new regulation body will keep people safe.”"
