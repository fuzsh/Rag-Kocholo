        "text": "“I am my mother’s savage daughter / The one who runs barefoot / Cursing sharp stones / I am my mother’s savage daughter / I will not cut my hair / I will not lower my voice”\n\nIntroduction:\n\nWelcome back to Cover Me Badd, where we look at good covers, bad covers, and what makes them tick. And because I am spectacularly swamped during this year’s holiday season, I admit I was forced to slack off a bit doing my other columns this month, not helped by the fact that the charts were overtaken entirely by re-charting holiday Christmas classics, with almost no new music on the Top 20. Which is insane to me. Yes, the charts are usually overtaken by Christmas songs this time of year, but there’s still at least a few contemporary stragglers hanging in there; by contrast, the only new music still hanging onto those increasingly irrelevant Top 20 slots are Jack Harlow’s “Lovin’ On Me”, SZA’s “Snooze”, and Tate McRae’s “Greedy”. The current #1 right now is “All I Want For Christmas Is You”, which would’ve felt deserved in any other era, but feels like nothing more than a perplexing blip in the year of our Lord 2023.\n\nAnd I guess that, by itself, is as much an encapsulation of the current state of popular music as anything else. Throughout 2023, we’ve been faced with an unprecedented drought of new music, with the charts being populated entirely by either old songs, covers of old songs, re-recordings of old songs, or backwards-looking genres that revive old traditional sounds with a modern twist. It seems like, more than anything else, we just don’t have the appetite for new music anymore; it’s nostalgia, and nothing else. So if that’s the case, it feels fitting that we close out the year by tackling one of the greatest purveyors of nostalgic pop music in my lifetime.\n\nThat’s right, today, we are revisiting the storied, turbulent and tragic career of one Amy Winehouse, one of the most enigmatic popular music figures of the 2000s bar none, and unfortunately the most recent entrant into the hallowed 27 Club. Looking back on her story some twelve years after her death, it really is stunning how mythologized she’s become, especially as someone who was around in her heyday. She was never the biggest or most inescapable artist of the late 2000s; she was never as big as Beyonce or Shakira or anyone of that stature. She only had one real crossover smash hit and never really graduated outside of her insular blue-eyed soul pop niche (at least as far as her Stateside success is concerned), but what did keep her in the public eye was her hedonistic, drug and alcohol-fueled lifestyle, which made her a tabloid figure throughout the decade until her untimely death by overdose in 2011.\n\nAnd because of that, she was never a particularly beloved figure in her lifetime, either, her image as the filthy coke whore solidified thanks to the involvement of the cruel paparazzi culture of the late aughts and the notoriety of her public behavior, which incited a moral panic so widespread that even the UN Office of Drugs and Crime felt the need to comment. This ignored the fact that Winehouse was a genuine talent whose two albums, Frank and Back to Black, were critically acclaimed masterpiece albums that helped influence a generation of UK pop and soul singers and laid the groundwork for the crossover success of future UK soul megastars like Florence Welch, Beth Ditto, and goddamn Adele, and even American pop stars like Lady Gaga. The further we got from Winehouse’s death, the more apparent her influence became, all of which helped solidify her legacy as one of the most influential artists of the 2000s.\n\nAgain, she wasn’t much of a crossover success in her lifetime, but of all her non-hits in the US, there is one that has stood out as one of her most iconic tracks, despite not actually being her song—the one, the only, “Valerie”. By that, I mean that, strictly speaking, this song is a Mark Ronson joint featuring Amy Winehouse. But since Ronson is a behind-the-scenes producer who does everything but front the song, most people who listen to the song immediately associate it with Amy Winehouse, to the point that, after “Rehab”, it’s probably her best-known and most enduring song. It wasn’t much of a chart success Stateside, but its international success coupled with the the critical adoration that the song has gotten helped bolster its status, to the point that she basically fucking owns the song now.\n\nBut it’s also not her song in a very literal sense, because it’s actually a cover. Yeah, for those of you who didn’t know, the song was originally released in 2006 as an indie rock song by the English indie rock band The Zutons, one of the hordes of scrappy blogosphere rock bands being spat out of the UK at clockwork speed in the mid-to-late aughts, for whom we coined the term “landfill indie” to describe. And as you can probably tell by my intro just now, despite the outsize success their song has achieved, the Zutons won very little in the way of mainstream recognition from “Valerie”. After bubbling under as an up-and-coming indie rock act in the mid 2000s, the Zutons won a few modest indie rock hits before quietly petering out and disbanding in 2009.\n\nWhy is that? Just how good was Amy Winehouse’s version that it managed to completely supplant the original? Well, why don’t you come on over as we take an in-depth look at the long and storied legacy of this one song.\n\nThe original:\n\nWhen I talk about “landfill indie”, I don’t necessarily mean it in the derogatory sense that most others do.\n\nThe 2000s are not generally seen as a golden age decade for rock music. The general musical consensus was that this was the decade in which rock music died; it was the last time rock music was able to attain any sort of commercial relevance with the public before quietly petering out by the end of the decade. More cynical observers have always been eager to pin the blame on the quality of the decade’s music, dominated as it was by watered-down, commercialized, radio-friendly post-grunge acts, the dying embers of nu-metal, the remaining dregs of aging ‘90s alt rock, and the unbearably petulant whining of the pop punk and emo acts, all of which supposedly led to the rapid stagnation of rock by killing any innovation in favor of attaining the lowest common denominator required for mass commercial appeal. But of course, as with any pop historical narrative, it’s a massive oversimplification of the actual story, one brought about by a whole slew of complex factors which can be boiled down more accurately to a fracturing of the infrastructure that could’ve carried rock music into the new millennium.\n\nThere’s a lot to this story that we don’t have time to get into, but to put it simply, in the ‘90s, rock acts like Metallica, Green Day and the Foo Fighters, as weird and idiosyncratic as those acts could get, carried just enough mass appeal that they could still appeal to a wide array of demographics; your average basic bitch normie could still appreciate them to the same degree as the burnouts and wastoids who generally consumed that kind of music. But in the 2000s, these demographics were gradually polarized into two completely separate niches. The rise of commercially-oriented meathead genres like nu metal and post-grunge gradually alienated the hipster demographics who bemoaned the perceived lack of artfulness of acts like Nickelback and Puddle of Mudd, and who instead gravitated towards the nascent blogosphere acts like The Strokes. Neither of these two genres could be united under one umbrella, and because neither side was individually big enough to support itself, eventually, the audience or rock radio diminished and rock stations slowly went under throughout the decade.\n\nOf course, that hasn’t stopped people from blaming the death of rock on acts like Nickelback. Hell, when I was a budding young music nerd tracing the evolution of popular muis, one of the most widely-cited theories for rock’s “death” in the 2010s was the absolute stranglehold that post-grunge had gripped American radio in, and how the backlash against the genre wound up taking down all of rock radio. But I would argue that the other side of the coin—the indie blogosphere crowd—had as much to do with rock’s commercial decline as the mainstream rock outlets did.\n\nThere’s a whole essay to be written about how the indie rock acts of the 2000s pigeonholed themselves into a corner by being so backwards-looking that they prevented rock music from truly innovating and pushing the genre forward. For those who aren’t familiar with the history of this particular scene (which is understandable given that this scene, true to its name, never attained mass popularity), in the early 2000s, there arose a movement of bands influenced who took the sound and aesthetics of older “cool” genres like garage rock and post-punk and repackaged it for the new millennium, creating short, punchy, ratty and disaffected beat anthems which appealed to exactly the kind of demographics who’d been displaced by the demise of ‘90s alternative zine culture. And because this scene came about at a time generally seem as a low point for mainstream rock, when the dominant genres were either high-gloss TRL pop and Dirty South hip-hop and rocks only standard bearers were the critically derided post grunge and nu metal acts I mentioned earlier, these acts were seen as breaths of fresh air. The highbrow critics of the day turned to The Strokes, The Hives, The Vines, the Libertines, and the White Stripes as “saviors of rock and roll”. In fact, there were plenty of concerted attempts by the rock intelligentsia to brand these guys as the next big thing, despite the lack of reciprocal response by the public, and let’s just say it hasn’t all aged well.\n\nYeah, the “New Rock Revolution” wound up being just another flash in the pan genre by the middle of the decade, with many of its standard-bearers unable to recapture the success of their breakthrough or debut albums. And yet, the backwards-looking throwback approach they trafficked in wound up seeping into the rest of the highbrow rock intelligentsia. Most of the critical darlings of the 2000s were acts that either trafficked in this valorization of older music or pandering to that kind of attitude; it was almost as if you couldn’t be a critically acclaimed rock band if you weren’t influenced by Joy Division or Suicide or Bauhaus or The Smiths in some way. And it definitely overplayed its hand by the middle of the decade. By 2005, most of the first-wave of the “The” bands (as they were nicknamed on music forums) had burned out commercially, but what they left in their wake were an insipid wave of copycats who basically dominated the rock press, especially in the UK, where these acts had much more notoriety than in America.\n\nWhile most US acts took their cues from the Strokes, in the UK, the post-punk revival was defined mainly by the energetic garage-punk sound of the Libertines, the explosive indie megastars who’d taken the UK by storm between 2002-2004, only to flame out in a spectacularly toxic cloud of hostility and drug overdoses. Their untimely demise allowed for a whole new crop of bands who trafficked in the same kind of ‘60s pastiche they specialized in, but in increasingly formulaic and watered-down terms. And because there were so many of them, their sound eventually oversaturated the mainstream rock bands to the point where every single one of them sounded the exact same, at least as far the British music press were concerned.\n\nThe big snotty music mags were pretty much sick and tired of the whole thing by 2006, and the repetitive nature of their sound led bands like Razorlight, the Kooks, The Rifles, The Holloways and Scouting for Girls, the Pigeon Detectives, and Millburn to be derisively labeled as “landfill indie”, as in the kind of waste of space records that would immediately be tossed into the landfill upon purchase. And yet, this sound continued to dominate not just British rock music, but British music in general, if the scale of the derision was anything to go by. It must have helped that these acts were generally a lot more energetic and punchy then the other rock genres prevailing in the UK at the time—these guys carried the torch for the kind of laddishness that Britpop embodied before its demise in the late ‘90s, and many people saw them as a breath of fresh air amidst the Coldplay-ification of mainstream rock (which seems like the UK’s equivalent of the Nickelback-ification of rock in the US).\n\nAnd despite the critical snobbery, this scene definitely had its share of highlights. Acts like Franz Ferdinand, Bloc Party, Kaiser Chiefs, Kasabian and (the most enduring of them all) the Arctic Monkeys found their start in the mid-aughts British indie boom. Maybe I’m a bit biased, since I basically grew up on this type of music, so I can’t really bring myself to echo the critical consensus. But I do understand how easy it was to get sick of this kind of music. By 2008, the British public was ready for something else, which is probably why by 2009, you started to see more variety amongst the indie rock crowd. Most of the landfill bands were slowly edged out in favor of blue-eyed soul acts like Duffy, Adele, Leona Lewis and Paloma Faith, and electropop singers like Little Boots, Pixie Lott and La Roux, and/or hybrids of the two scenes represented by acts like Florence and the Machine, the Ting Tings and Sneaky Sound System—all of which drew their inspiration from Amy Winehouse, for the record, but we’ll get into later. In short, where the “death of rock” in the US was caused by a fracturing of the rock infrastructure, in the UK it seems to have been caused by sheer oversaturation.\n\nBut it’s difficult to argue that the scene didn’t leave at least some lasting impact. If anything else, there was one song that managed to survive the transition between the two eras:\n\nThe full breadth and scope of “Valerie’s” success, we’ll get into later, but the song was definitely the career highlight of the band that wrote it, the Zutons. These guys were a Liverpudian act fresh off the Merseyside music scene of the early 2000s, whose members had all played in various acts before getting together and forming a band whose ridiculous name apparently came from Captain Beefheart’s guitarist, Zoot Horn Rollo. These guys were able to score a record deal with Deltasonic records, the same label responsible for signing fellow Merseyside band the Coral in 2002.\n\nActually, these guys’ story intertwines with the Coral quite a bit. Not only were they both Merseyside acts who shared the same label, who arguably shared the same sound (seeing as the band had to fight comparisons with the Coral for most of their careers), but arguably their lineup would have never materialized without the Coral’s involvement, because it was at their instance that the Zutons’ eventual lead singer and songwriter, Dave McCabe, would be admitted into the band. The head of Deltasonic Records had been skeptical of McCabe’s talents, claiming that he’d heard him play in a bunch of other Merseyside bands before and “they were all rubbish”, but the Coral had vouched for him and had managed to convince the label to keep him on. Whatever the case, the band’s lineup would finally be solidified with McCabe on vocals, Boyan Chowdhury on lead guitar, Russell Pritchard on bass, Sean Payne on bass, and Abi Harding on saxophone.\n\nThe band released their debut album Who Killed The Zutons in 2004, to moderate success, getting big enough to get a US release not long after it came out in the UK; but it was their second album in 2006, Tired of Hanging Around, that really brought them increased mainstream exposure in the UK. They were never as big as most of their contemporaries—they never reached Franz Ferdinand or Arctic Monkeys levels of success, but they were decently successful in an era where it would’ve otherwise been easy to get lost in the sea of landfill bands populating British airwaves. That said, I can’t say I ever found their music all that memorable or interesting. They definitely had a unique sound, blending early 70s psychedelic grooves with 60s garage rock textures and even a bit of Northern soul flair that set them apart from most of their contemporaries, but I always felt like they never did enough with their sound to truly rise above the scene and become megastars.\n\nAnd that feeling of missed potential definitely shines through in the song they became best known for. “Valerie” was released as the second single off Tired of Hanging Around, and it was decently successful, peaking at #9 off the UK Singles chart. The song was written about McCabe’s freewheeling female friend, who actually was named Valerie, whom he’d met in America. Apparently, they even dated for a while, which does explain the passion with which McCabe delivers this number. See, the thing about her is that she frequently found herself in trouble with the law, and at the time McCabe was in America, Valerie had found herself mired in several driving offenses, which landed her in jail for a bit and prevented her from moving back with him in the UK. So the song is quite literally about McCabe lamenting the fact that Valerie “can’t come over” with him across the pond, and the verses detail all of the various legal mishapps Valerie had gotten herself into that directly led to that outcome. It also makes the line “Well sometimes, I go out by myself / And I look across the water” make way more sense in hindsight.\n\nAnd finding out about that explanation… I don’t know why, but it definitely takes away some of the song’s mystique for me. I was actually quite surprised to learn that the song is a literal word-for-word recounting of McCabe’s feelings for this flighty, chaotic ginger-haired woman with the shady past. I guess it makes sense—the song is so engulfed in hyper specific literary details that it should be quite easy to deduce that it was a real thing that had happened to him; but I don’t know, I did kind of like the idea of this mysterious woman being entirely a product of McCabe’s fevered imagination. Given the band’s psychedelic leanings, McCabe probably could’ve stood to embellish more of the details in the song, really take it out there, to a more frenzied “Livin’ da Vida Loca”-esque direction.\n\nBut that’s a minor nitpick; other than that, there’s a lot to like about the Zutons version. It’s easily the best and most memorable song in their catalogue. I like that steady, snakelike groove the song is built upon, I like that it uses unique instrumental ideas like how the horns and trumpets sync up nicely with the bass riff, and I like how the song’s deep bass rhythms interact with the pretty little guitar notes scattered throughout. It’s a perfectly good song. Which, ironically, might be my biggest gripe with it–it’s just fine. It’s good, but it’s not great. And maybe this is hindsight talking, maybe recent events have made me retroactively look at the song differently, and that might strike you as an unfair evaluation of the song, so I want to make it clear that I don’t think negatively of the Zutons song. It’s a good song, based upon a serviceable, timeless premise, and I definitely wouldn’t have been surprised if this song had managed to become a bigger hit than it ended up being. But it never rises above the level of just being good, and if the story of the song had ended here, I probably wouldn’t be talking about it.\n\nBut of course, we know that’s not what happened.\n\nThe cover:\n\nWhat is there to say about Amy Winehouse that hasn’t already been said?\n\nIt feels like the fact of her troubled life has so thoroughly overwhelmed the narrative surrounding her that it threatens to overshadow everything there is to know about her. Certainly that’s how it felt having grown up and come of age right around the time her life reached peak turbulence.The first thing I learned about Amy Winehouse was that she was a hot mess, an addict whose life had spiraled out of control due to a combination of addiction, poor impulse control, and toxic relationships with both her family, her boyfriend, and her boyfriend’s family. I was there, and trust me, her name had basically become synonymous with whirlwind publicity and celebrity bad behavior. Her name was literally wine house, for God’s sake; it was as if fate had personally intervened to spell doom for this enigmatic figure. It didn’t help that, by 2007, when I was just really starting to get into pop music, the discourse around Amy’s two studio albums had already passed, which means all we had to deal with was the chaos.\n\nAnd I don’t think the fact of her death alleviated this state of affairs, exactly? I mean, sure, we collectively reappraised her influence and legacy in hindsight, recognized her talent for what it was and started paying closer attention to her music, but I think the discourse about her has shifted to the opposite extreme, to where we now paint her as a victim of circumstance and fame whose life was marked entirely by suffering. Like she was nothing but a poor innocent corrupted by the toxic, exploitative and money-grubbing people around her. I mean, this happens to all celebrities who died young and tragically, but it feels especially pronounced with Amy Winehouse, what with our rush to reevaluate the way the cruel and misogynistic paparazzi culture of the 2000s treated young female acts. While it’s right that we’ve finally gotten around to pointing out how awful it all was, I worry that it also has the unintended side effect of whitewashing and even sanding off Amy Winehouse and her complex humanity, especially since her complexities were at the core of what made her music so great.\n\nWhich does feel extremely unfair when the artist you’re talking about is perhaps one of the most influential artists of the 2000s, and perhaps the one most responsible for shaping the idiosyncratic, unpredictable nature of pop music in the decades moving forward. To understand how, we need to address the question of where pop music even was before Amy Winehouse.\n\nNow, the musical aspect of Amy Winehouse’s influence has already been well-established, but just to give a brief rundown—in the early 2000s, pop music, both in the US and in the UK, was firmly in the domain of the overpolished post-TRL teen pop idols, the Britneys, Christinas, N’syncs, Destiny’s Childs and Backstreet Boys in the US, and the even more watered-down likes of Westlife, Girls Aloud, Sugababes, Blue and S Club 7 in the UK. This at least made the two scenes more or less parallel to each other trendwise, but for various structural reasons (aka 9/11), the US began to tire of this type of bubblegum pop sound sometime around 2001-02, giving way in favor of darker, more meatheaded genres like Dirty South hip-hop, nu metal, post-grunge and emo pop. But the UK did not follow suit—these types of pop acts persisted in Britain well into the decade, not only continuing to release music, but even transitioning into more “mature” territory, which generally meant a pivot away from camp into more ballad-oriented territory. It was boring, in short.\n\nThis created a musical trans-Atlantic divide so potent and pronounced that it may be one of the worst times for Anglo-American relations in all of music history. There have been periods throughout the past few decades where the US and UK pop scenes had diverged, like the early ‘60s, the late ‘80s, and the mid ‘90s, but it was nowhere as pronounced as in the early 2000s, where, after the demise of the Spice Girls, almost no British artist was able to cross over into the American pop charts and the two music scenes were not only dissimilar, but arguably each other’s diametric opposites. Where the UK was swimming in a saccharine sea of sugary pop-rock, the US was thoroughly dominated by grunting meatheads who were about as British as a plate of fajitas. It was a strange time to be a British pop act on the American charts; the only points of contact between the two disparate scenes were Coldplay, who scored a couple of modest rock chart entries that would eventually grow in stature as sleeper hits; and Norah Jones, the critical darling soul-jazz singer who won all the Grammys in 2003 before fading away like so many Best New Artists before and after her.\n\nBut it’s the Norah Jones template that’s crucial to understanding where Amy Winehouse comes from, because Winehouse was part of an entire new wave of British singer-songwriters who catered to the adult contemporary market by reappropriating old jazz, RnB and soul sounds and blending them with contemporary pop stylings. These were acts like Joss Stone, Corinne Bailey Rae, KT Tunstall, and Dido, all smooth, tasteful, respectable acts that didn’t have a prayer of crossing over into the American market outside of the increasingly niche corners of adult contemporary or adult alternative radio. In fact, Amy Winehouse did not became a trans-Atlantic success at the outset; her debut album Frank, a delightfully quirky jazz-pop setlist released in 2003, was successful in the UK and in Europe but only charted at #61 on the Billboard 200 and wouldn’t really sell well over there until after Winehouse’s death. But it was enough hype generated around her that Winehouse quickly became a fixture of the British pop scene, standing not only for the smoky, soulful grit in her voice, but also for being the lone bad girl amongst her otherwise clean-cut contemporaries.\n\nSee, Winehouse had come onto pop music at the exceptionally young age of nineteen, her first brush with fame largely being a product of circumstance and pure luck. She was born to a working-class Jewish family that basically lived and breathed jazz, as evidenced by the fact that her uncles were all jazz musicians and her paternal grandmother was even involved with British jazz legend Ronnie Scott at one point. But jazz wasn’t her only influence, either—she’d always been attracted to the raw edges of more “dangerous” genres like early rock and roll and hip-hop, which played a big role in shaping her sound. One of her primary collaborators in her early career was hip-hop producer and keyboardist Salaam Remi, best known for his work with the Fugees and Toni Braxton in the mid-90s, and the trademark hybrid of jazz and hip-hop he’d infused those albums with definitely shone through in songs like “Fuck Me Pumps” and “You Sent Me Flying/Cherry”. So right off the bat, you had someone who, despite her retro-pastiche leanings, frequently flouted the conventions of both her genre and her celebrity image, quickly making the rounds as a loose cannon of a woman in the British tabloids.\n\nAnd her loose cannon reputation would only grow as her star shone brighter. After having already made a name for herself in the UK, she became an international megastar upon the release of her 2006 album Back to Black, where she shifted away from her jazz pop influences into more of an early ‘60s girl group pop approach, to rapturous acclaim. Not only did it spawn her biggest ever hit “Rehab”, but it conquered the music world in ways very few of her contemporaries had ever been able to achieve, being both her breakthrough album and biggest selling success in the US of A and helping bridge the trans-Atlantic divide I mentioned earlier. The record was a smash hit, and helped open the floodgates for countless British acts to cross over into the American market, not only with her blue-eyed soul contemporaries, but even a new wave of acts who operated in the mold she’d pioneered, acts like Duffy, Estelle, Leona Lewis, Paloma Faith and the biggest of them all, Adele, who admits she would have never reached the heights of success she attained without Winehouse paving the way.\n\nBut her influence lay not only in the musical aspect, but in the kind of pop star personality she represented. Before she broke out, pop divas like her were expected to fit a certain Madonna-whore (no pun intended) spectrum for which there was very little middle ground and very little room for deviation. You were either a clean-cut innocent ingenue a la Britney or a dirty sex kitten a la Christina. Some artists were able to straddle the line, but for the most part, there was only a certain type of woman who could succeed in the glamorous pop star sphere, and there was very little room for anyone who didn’t fit that mold. This was the very same media ecosystem that had hounded Britney Spears to oblivion when her facade began to crack. All of this is to say that loose, rowdy, freewheeling Amy Winehouse was the exact opposite of this type of person, so her success in 2006 was a big damn deal and helped open a lot of doors for other unconventional women to take center stage.\n\nAnd I think that’s largely key to why, as much as Winehouse’s music trafficked largely in retro pastiche, she doesn’t have the same stink of tasteful artificiality that usually plagues these kinds of acts. The era of music she cribs from comes mostly from the pre-Beatles era where showmanship and performance were prioritized over artistry and musicians weren’t expected to write their own songs or express themselves in their art. Most of the artists who throw back to this period follow that same approach, and it’ why the reach of artists like Michael Buble, Jamie Cullum and Diana Krall has always been somewhat limited. But Amy Winehouse infuses her Ronnie Spector-esque retro pop with the kind of bleeding heart rock and roll approach that keeps her music from coming off like pure pastiche. As steeped as she was in her retro-soul influences, she made damn sure that her genuine personality and emotion shown through in every note, and that’s why her music has always registered as refreshingly original. No one else could’ve recorded a song like “Back to Black”, or made gold off a song like “Rehab”, and it’s this kind of unique approach that I wish more of Amy’s imitators like Meghan Trainor and Bruno Mars utilized more often.\n\nI know this sounds like just another fawning tribute for an artist everyone already loves anyway, but I want to make it clear that my love for Amy Winehouse is deep and abiding for a reason, and this overall tone of praise is not gonna change when I discuss her cover of “Valerie”.\n\nAt a glance, it is kind of weird to devote so much of this article to the life of Amy Winehouse, considering that the “Valerie” cover is technically by Mark Ronson, the English producer extraordinaire who, as a lead artist, is best known for the stone classic “Uptown Funk”, undoubtedly one of the biggest and most iconic hits of the 2010s proper, and a personal favorite of mine. From that alone, you can already get a glimpse of this man’s pedigree, because to his core, Ronson is a soul and funk aficionado, and he carries that sound with him all throughout his oeuvre. But Ronson is also a producer first and foremost; his success as a lead artist has always been kind of limited, especially since he doesn’t even sing on most of his recordings. After the lukewarm critical reception of his debut record, Ronson put his work in the studio and made a huge name for himself in 2006 by producing smash hits for artists like Christina Aguilera, Lily Allen, and Amy Winehouse herself—Back to Black was produced primarily by Ronson, and it’s how the two wound up working together in the first place.\n\nAnd I actually feel bad for making this point, because Ronson has expressed his dissatisfaction before about how his guest performers wind up stealing the spotlight and taking his songs away from him. He definitely wasn’t happy about the fact that “Uptown Funk” has become a Bruno Mars solo track to most people. But let’s be real—despite the order in which Ronson’s name appears on the song, “Valerie” is an Amy Winehouse fucking owns this song.\n\nFirst and foremost, the cover was Amy’s idea. The song appears on Mark Ronson’s second album Versions, which he recorded throughout 2006 and 2007 ostensibly to capitalize on his newfound fame as a producer, which makes it weird that the thrust of the album is largely soul-jazz covers of popular songs. “Valerie” was included on the album at Amy’s insistence, since she was a huge fan of the Zutons version and wanted to put her own spin on it; Ronson was actually reluctant to entertain the idea at first, thinking that her voice wouldn’t suit the material.\n\nFortunately, the song is switched up quite a bit from the snakelike sluggishness of the original—Ronson based his version around the beat of the Jam’s “Town Called Malice”, and for my money, it’s the most crucial change he makes to the song because it does a lot to mold this song into something Amy Winehouse could pull off. The fact that the beat conveniently resembles nothing less than the Supremes’ “You Can’t Hurry Love” helps give the song a ‘60s girl group feel by indirection, which I’ve always found interesting; but more than that, it gives the song energy and jolts it back to life. The song just fundamentally works as an early 60s Motown soul song. The transition from the psychedelia of the original to the buttoned-up soul of the cover takes nothing away from the song; but the amazing thing is that despite explicitly cribbing from a specific and defined era of music, this song feels like something that could only have been made in the modern day. I can’t actually imagine this playing alongside “Please Mr. Postman” or “Then He Kissed Me”.\n\nWhich brings me to my second point, which is that while the overall concept originated with Ronson, “Valerie” ultimately serves as a showcase for Amy’s vocal performance, which is top-tier. It feels weird that this is a cover because even though I heard the Zutons’ version first, in hindsight, the song feels like it was tailor-made for Amy. Something just clicked for me when I heard Amy take a stab at it. If I had to pinpoint why that is, I think it’s that it helps emphasize the character of Valerie more than the original. There’s nothing wrong with putting a man at the helm of a song like this, but the original definitely feels more oriented toward his perspective and thus tends to downplay Valerie herself. So having Winehouse front and center does a lot to round out the song and emphasize the Valerie-ness of it all, adding a sultry edge that unlocks the song’s full potential and helps sketch out more fully the portrait being painted by the lyrics.\n\nOf course, there’s many ways to interpret this version—you can read it as a gender-flip (since ‘Valerie’ is apparently a common male name in the UK), or you can read it as a same-sex romance, but I’ve always read the song as Winehouse singing to her mirror image, her bright shining reflection winking back at her. Because let’s face it, the reason why this version works so well, my third argument as to why Winehouse totally owns this song, is that Valerie might as well be a stand-in for Winehouse herself. Think about it—she’s a flighty, impulsive young woman teetering on the edge of self-destruction; you can’t help but make the comparison, right?\n\nAnd yet, Valerie’s whirlwind life isn’t played as tragedy, but as triumph. Chalk that up to the ebullient Motown arrangement, I guess, but the song sounds joyous, celebratory, and full of life, which is a starkly different take from the original’s tone of bittersweet rumination. Sure Valerie is a mess, sure this probably isn’t the last night she’ll spend behind bars, but y’know what? Fuck it. And because Valerie’s sensibilities are so subtextually sympatico with Amy’s, her “why don’t you come on over?” line feels less like the earnest pleading of McCabe’s original, and more like an invitation to come kick it. It’s like Amy’s finally found her kindred spirit, and for that brief three minutes in which she inhibits this character, she sounds like she’s having the absolute time of her life. And with that, she conquers the song and makes it her own.\n\nThat, above all else, is why I think this is one of the greatest covers of all time.\n\nThe verdict:\n\nIt’s a highly-regarded cover for a reason.\n\nThe story of Mark Ronson and Amy Winehouse’s “Valerie” is one of those rare times where a good song gets an even better cover that succeeds not because it necessarily “improves” on the original, but because it’s its own thing entirely. It was hard for me to even compare the two songs because they feel like two completely different entitles, and it does feel a bit unfair to the Zutons version that the cover has completely overshadowed it, but I can’t say it’s unwarranted exactly. The Zutons’ version is a good song but it always felt like there was something missing, and I always felt like Amy was able to unlock that missing something. But even so, I feel like both versions deserve consideration, and I hope this article was enough to do justice to them."
