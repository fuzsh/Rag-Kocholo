        "text": "Singer-songwriter Amy Winehouse, considered by many as one of the most outstanding vocalists of her generation, passed away on 23 July at 27 years old.\n\nBorn Amy Jade Winehouse in 1983 to taxi driver father Mitch and pharmacist mother Janis, Amy grew up listening to her father's jazz and soul collection. She showed an early aptitude for music and by the age of eight she was attending stage school, spending time at Sylvia Young theatre school and the Brit school in Croydon.\n\nShe rose to prominence in 2003 with the release of Frank, the title of which reflected the album's lyrics and mood. Her soul-tinged vocals and jazz influences demonstrated a musical maturity beyond her years. However it was her follow-up album Back to Black that brought her worldwide attention. It was Britain's best-selling record of 2007 and reached No 2 in the US album chart, making her one of only a few British female artists to achieve that level of success in the difficult to break US market. It also won five Grammy awards.\n\nAs well as being an acclaimed vocalist, Winehouse was also an accomplished songwriter. Speaking to M in 2003, she said: \"Writing is a very natural process for me. I wait for when I've been through some horrible thing and there's nothing I can do but write about it. I follow my heart because otherwise you get so caught up in other peoples opinions. Not that I'm any great authority! I'm a f**cking idiot like the rest of the world, but I trust my instincts and this what has got me where I am, y'know?\"\n\nAmy's well-documented problems with drugs and alcohol, including numerous attempts at rehab and recuperation, delayed production of a highly anticipated third album. However there were highs amongst the lows. She launched her own label, Lioness in 2009, whose first signing was her then 13-year-old goddaughter, Dionne Bromfield - who is now becoming a successful artist in her own right.\n\nShe made her final recording in March with jazz singer Tony Bennett, which will be released on his album Duets II in September. Bennett remembered her as \"an extraordinary musician with a rare intuition as a vocalist\".\n\nHer final public appearance came three days before her death, at a gig by Bromfield at the Roundhouse, Camden. Winehouse grabbed the mic but only to urge the crowd to buy Bromfield's album.\n\nBBC Radio 1 DJ Trevor Nelson, speaking to Radio 5 Live following Amy's passing, said he was \"completely shocked\". \"Some artists are just born to give us something special...just one or two albums. Others in history have done it. She, unfortunately, is now one of them.\"\n\nTalking to the BBC, broadcaster Paul Gambaccini said: \"This was a talented woman. She was someone who invested a lyric with meaning, paying attention to every word, every nuance, and what the song as a whole meant. She had great musical knowledge and taste, and unfortunately this was combined with a weak and addictive personality.\n\n\"I parallel her decline with her three appearances at the Ivor Novello songwriting awards. Her first triumph, she was accompanied by her dad and she was a shy, friendly woman. Second time, not so shy, not so friendly, but still talented and with her dad. Third time, she didn't show up, her dad had to accept on her behalf. And then, she walked in during the middle of someone else's speech. She was two-and-a-half hours lateâ€¦ she'd obviously lost control of herself...We have lost 20 years of good records, and Mitch Winehouse has lost a daughter.\"\n\nAmy is survived by her parents and her brother, Alex.\n\nIn her short career, Amy Winehouse left a lasting mark on the music industry. You are welcome to leave a tribute to her below."
