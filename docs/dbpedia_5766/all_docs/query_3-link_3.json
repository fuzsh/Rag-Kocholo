        "text": "In contemporary society, the word “Romantic” immediately evokes images of sentimentality and love whilst the concept of “Romanticism” has much wider cultural and artistic significance. Romanticism was a cultural movement that emerged towards the end of the 18th century that saw developments in music, literature, art, and philosophy. Characterised by self-expression, idealisation of nature, and imagination, the Romantic era saw artists and writers being faced with adversity, including societal criticism and the challenges of navigating rapidly changing political landscapes.\n\nThe period was a direct response to the dissatisfaction of individuals as an act of rebellion. In England, the very heart of the movement,¸Romantics challenged the establishment inspired by their desire for liberty and renounced the rationalism and order associated with the preceding enlightenment era. Rather, Romantics placed value on individuals and stressed the importance of expressing personal and authentic feelings.\n\nComposers of the Romantic Period moved away from what could be considered as the “formal restraint” of musical composition and became increasingly expressive and inventive. Orchestral music began to sound a lot more emotive and “subjective” in comparison to previous eras, drawing inspiration from love, the supernatural, or even dark themes such as death. The Romantic movement saw music slowly begin to eradicate former conventions of what compositions were “supposed to be” introducing a brand new approach to creativity;\n\nWith a central focus on the music industry, Pop Culture today is reminiscent of The Romantic era, highlighting the significance of the revolutionary period. Most romantic writings were based on the imagination and fully conceptualising emotions into a singular piece of work, thereby transcending mere storytelling to become profound reflections of the human experience. The impact of Romanticism on the arts has been immense with many musicians and creatives today reflecting on the vulnerability of the time. The Romantic Era was a baseline for the modern liberal mindset, which has been translated into creativity with a focus on open-mindedness.\n\nThe late Amy Winehouse captivated audiences in the late 2000s with her quintessential lyricism that often delved into themes of passion, pain, and addiction. Winehouse left behind a huge musical legacy with acts such as Adele, Lana Del Rey and Summer Walker citing her as an inspiration. The British songwriter challenged the archetype of female stars of her generation. Born on 14 September 1983, in a small town named Southgate, North London, Winehouse was completely surrounded by music since childhood, listening to an array of genres played by her parents ranging from Jazz to R&B to American- Hip Hop, later forming her distinctive sound. Discovered by notable music label, Island Records, at age 16 Amy Jade Winehouse was propelled into stardom. By the end of her career, the singer had already certified her place in the “Hall of Fame” alongside some of the most influential musical icons such as Michael Jackson, Whitney Houston and Prince. The success of her career was at an all-time high but her personal life was a tragedy waiting to happen heightened by the invasive nature of British Press.\n\nAt the height of her career, Winehouse released her second body of work- the critically acclaimed “Back to Black”, where her lyricism became raw, unfiltered, and vulnerable. The album, Certified 17x platinum, primarily drew inspiration from her tumultuous relationship with former boyfriend Blake Fielder-Civil and how she was faced with the harsh reality of infidelity in the relationship.\n\nThe title track of the album “Back to Black”, is a soulful jazz song that incorporates elements of modern R&B, where Winehouse lays out her conflicting thoughts on the betrayal she’s been faced with and the effects this had on her both mentally and physically. Winehouse writes “And I tread a troubled track, My odds are stacked, I’ll go back to black. We only said goodbye with words” . Using the metaphor of “Black” Winehouse illustrates the abyss of depression after the “death” of her relationship and the methods she used to cope with her despair. The semantic field of ‘despair’ is further evidenced by how Winehouse’s struggle with alcoholism and drug addiction was no secret to the British media, who often scrutinized her “image”, making her a “poster girl” for Britain’s broken youth. They vilified the singer whilst she mentally was at a very low point in her life, which Brackett highlights as she writes that\n\n“The daily chronicling of Amy Winehouse’s Road to perdition in the media often distracted us from the naked beauty in her gorgeous songs” (Brackett, 2016).\n\nWinehouse would only address the concerns and rumours amongst the general public in her songwriting, fully encapsulating how personal her creative process was. Her transparency gave listeners an insight into her feelings and emotions. Her interpretation of female desire in her song writing was vastly different from her contemporaries as she details the much “darker” aspects of relationships rather than painting a “rosy picture” of love that is often unrealistic. The lyric “I love you much, It’s not enough. You love blow and I love puff” signifies her acceptance that her relationship was extremely flawed. The fundamental differences between her and Fielder-Civil were the first “red flags” in their relationship, meaning they were bound to be incompatible. In an interview with The Fader, she proclaims\n\n“I wrote songs about relationships that almost ended me. When you write about stuff so personal, you don’t have to dig that deep” (Winehouse, 2008).\n\nMany argue that Winehouse’s relationship with Fielder-Civil was sometimes pinpointed as being ‘to blame’ for her introduction to hard narcotics. Most media critics solely blame him for the death of the talented songstress; however, Winehouse offers a different perspective on their relationship. Addiction and Co-Dependency; human love and physical affection were not enough to sustain the addicts. She clarifies that drugs did, in fact, play a prominent role in her relationship, but particularly that their joint love for drugs superseded their love for each other, causing a breakdown between the couple.\n\nThe final single released by Winehouse in her lifetime “Love Is A Losing Game” is a hauntingly beautiful ballad that reflects on the painful moments of loneliness and confusion that one may face during a relationship. Whilst the song is nowhere near her most successful or notable pieces of work in terms of accolades or chart success, it is her frankness about the defeat of love combined with the sympathy we feel as listeners that makes it such a timeless classic. The extended metaphor with allusions to love being some sort of unfair game runs throughout the duration of the song- “For you, I was a flame…One I wished I never played, Oh, what a mess we made. And now, the final frame, Love is a losing game” . Playing on the idea of being someone’s “flame” or “muse”, Winehouse admits she is a hopeless romantic and it doesn’t take long for her admiration of her lover to flourish into something much greater. The mother-in-law of Winehouse stated that\n\n“Blake and Amy are like two separate accidents waiting to happen. Their meeting simply exacerbated everything that was wrong in their lives to the verge of tragedy” (Civil, 2007)\n\nThere was no denying that Winehouse’s relationship with her ex-husband Fielder-Civil was frowned upon amongst the general public due to their history of domestic abuse, co-dependency, and drug addiction, but also concerns began to arise amongst those within the social circles of the star-studded couple such as members of both respective families. However, rather than removing herself from the destructive and unattainable relationship, Winehouse “battles blind” as she expresses in the final verse of the song “Though I battle blind, Love is a fate resigned”. To love someone blindly is to love someone in spite of their flaws, which could be detrimental to a relationship, the same way it was for Winehouse.\n\n“The two carried on what was arguably popular culture’s bloodiest, druggiest, least predictable, and most volatile love affair” (Lee, 2017).\n\nWinehouse endured the volatility of her relationship because of how desperately she wanted to see things work out, as she had planned an unrealistic fairy-tale future with Fielder-Civil. Winehouse shows her brilliant lyricism here as “battl[ing] blind” could mean she literally fell in love, disposing of the idea that her lover is incredibly flawed- perhaps a metaphor for a baseball. Metaphorically, she went up to bat blind, almost guaranteeing a strike, however, rather than the outcome she fantasised about, she set herself up to fail. The song continues, “And now the final frame, Love is a losing game” Winehouse’s mention of a “final frame” is an allusion to the end of a movie, in this case, everything falls apart and she is faced with the reality that she has once again been unsuccessful in love, following the song’s depressing theme of resignation and failure. Accompanied by the dulcet vocals of the late singer and a string orchestra as the instrumental, the solemn track is simplistic yet powerful. Before a live performance in 2006, Winehouse prefaced that\n\n“This is my favourite song from the new album. I always get a little teary when I play it” (Winehouse, 2006).\n\nHer emotional connection to her craft demonstrates how she was devoted to pouring her “life and soul” into her music, drawing from her past experiences. She fully engulfs her thoughts, feelings, and emotions into anything she creatively outputs.\n\nRomantics rebelled against social structures and placed great emphasis on presenting oneself in an authentic manner. Creatives of the romantic era offered an alternative to the ordered world of Enlightenment thought.\n\nWinehouse’s legacy is a testament to her heartfelt lyricism, transparency, and non-conformist personality. It is argued that,\n\n“When art becomes expression the importance of the artist increases” (Eaves.,1980)\n\nWinehouse never shied away from talking about her personal struggles no matter how sinister and dark they were; she was a true living visionary who used her heart-breaking truth to create something memorable and impactful. The British media had no mercy on the young starlet from mocking her eating disorder and drug addiction to the intrusive nature of paparazzi culture- she remained under the watchful eye of the British press. During her lifetime, Amy Winehouse became a mainstay of the British tabloids.\n\n“The media coverage of her life… contributed to shaping her celebrity persona” (Polaschek, 2017).\n\nWinehouse was heavily exploited and scrutinised by the media as they would attack her for her lacklustre performances and erratic behaviour due to her being intoxicated. Her incomparable art, lyricism and multiple achievements would always be juxtaposed by her drug-fuelled lifestyle. Ironically, following her sudden death on 23rd July 2011 in Camden, the attitude of the media changed: the once “troubled crackhead” was now being portrayed as a musical icon and a national treasure. The duplicity of the media is highlighted through this abrupt U-turn, journalists of the time did not care about the singers’ mental health. They rather exploited her in order to engage with their target demographic, demonstrating that media is a façade.\n\n“If journalists can isolate the underlying issues that dictate paths of self-destruction, then there is an opportunity to educate” (Hearsum, 2012),\n\nsuggesting that in an ideal society, the death of Winehouse could have been prevented, with raising concerns from the media, journalists could have used her ongoing battle as a focal point to educate others about the dangers of drug use. Sadly, the media decided to scrutinise and target Winehouse, almost bullying her because of the ‘taboo’ lifestyle that she had lost control of, publicly shaming and ridiculing her;\n\n“The romantic hero… has been rejected by society” (Wilson.,1972)\n\nThe argument could be made that Winehouse parallels the characteristics of a romantic hero as she valued expressing her authentic self. However, that would lead to differing opinions of her as an individual with society perceiving her negatively. Even the physical image of Winehouse was bothersome to critics, in an interview with MTV she was asked why she doesn’t have a “polished look” to which she replied,\n\n“I’m not really fussed, I’m very lucky that I’ve got to make the album I wanted to make that’s pretty much it. The rest of it I would tell everyone to piss off, so it doesn’t really matter I suppose” (Winehouse., 2007).\n\nWinehouse acknowledged that she wouldn’t be everyone’s “cup of tea” but she didn’t let that refrain her from being her most authentic self. While a small minority of people were not accepting of Winehouse and her troubled ways, her influence on today’s generation is undeniable. The experiences of Winehouse may not be relatable to all, but the vulnerability and passion she allowed us to see through her song writing struck a chord with listeners.\n\n“Amy was someone who wore her heart on her sleeve. I think that is probably why she connected so well with people” (Bromfield, 2021)"
