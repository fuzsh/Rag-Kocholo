        "text": "As an introvert, I have long been a fan of the writer Susan Cain because of her book “Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can’t Stop Talking.” As a follow-up in 2023, Cain embarked on a book tour for her latest work, “Bittersweet: How Sorrow and Longing Make Us Whole.” Like “Quiet,” this book focuses on a personality trait often overlooked in society and demonstrates what we have been missing. Specifically, the book explores what we can learn from embracing the bittersweet and romantic possibilities of tapping into a deep love for the beauty of art, nature, and life.\n\nI took Cain’s Bittersweet personality test before reading the book, and my score of 8.5/10 didn’t surprise me. According to Cain’s research, individuals who identify as introverted and highly sensitive are likely to score high on the bittersweet scale. I also knew from a few quiz questions, such as how much you enjoy cloudy days and crying at commercials, that I would probably end up on the far side of bittersweet. But, most of all, I knew that I would score high because I cherish the deep emotions that arise from exploring the creative potential of music and writing."
