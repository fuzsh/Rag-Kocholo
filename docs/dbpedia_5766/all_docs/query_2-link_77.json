I watched Amy Winehouse on the Grammys.I asked myself what would happen if she did this exact performance, the look and all, acapella as an American Idol audition.I listened to her singing voice. She was off key. Her manner was odd.So I am puzzled. What's the big deal with Amy Winehouse that she is so popular and such an award winner?I am honestly curious as I look at this thing called the music business today.\n\nRe: Is Amy Winehouse talented?\n\nQuote\n\nPost by jameii » Mon Feb 11, 2008 6:40 am\n\nI have to agree with you totally. She's controversial, yes..talented? I don't know. My son is 13 and he loves her music. Live, a LOT of the performers today can't hang..they are flat, off key, etc. Sad really!!She seemed strung out last night...really really spacey...she's supposed to be IN rehab right now so I doubt she was high...but she sure seemed like it.I felt really sorry for her. She hardly seemed to know what was going on.\n\nRe: Is Amy Winehouse talented?\n\nQuote\n\nPost by twilsbach » Mon Feb 11, 2008 7:06 am\n\nA lions share of her award season success has to be attributed to Mark Ronson as producer, nailing that throwback soul sound while at the same time keeping it fresh. Granted, she had to deliver in the studio, and she did, but she had tons of help getting there.As far as it resonating with a large audience--she's the epitome of rock n roll excess, and its never been in a package quite like her before. So its at once fresh and completely familiar.It worked on me, I bought that album. Rehab is an undeniable track. Not sure about the lyrics, but I would say the production is Amazing\n\nRe: Is Amy Winehouse talented?\n\nQuote\n\nPost by onoffon » Mon Feb 11, 2008 8:23 am\n\nThe chord structure of that song has been done a thousand times... her performance was weak.IMHO, it's representative of how the industry massively promotes an image, not talent, and buys itself awards...BTW - I'm a voting member of NARAS and I did not vote for Ms. Winehouse in any category. I did, however, vote for Herbie Hancock...\n\nRe: Is Amy Winehouse talented?\n\nQuote\n\nPost by windowman » Mon Feb 11, 2008 8:59 am\n\nThe Grammys have become less significant with each passing year. I realize that they're about representing all music, but relevance has never been what they're about. http://www.cracked.com/article_15856_7- ... me.htmlAmy Winehouse isn't the next great hope for music or Rock & Roll, but she does represent a spirit that's been lacking for far too long. She has pipes, balls & she sang from her gut, not from auto-tune software. Personally, I find it refreshing to hear music that isn't 'fixed' or lip-synced. Milli Vannilli are really innovators by today's standards. They should have gotten a lifetime achievement award. American Idol 'music' is disposable, safe tripe for soccer moms who don't listen to music. Kelly Clarkson apologizing to Clive Davis? When did it become acceptable to appease the oppressor, especially one in his late hundreds?I'll be more than relieved when the next Nirvana, Steve Earle, Warren Zevon, Albert Collins, Tom Waits or Chrissie Hynde comes along.\n\nRe: Is Amy Winehouse talented?\n\nQuote\n\nPost by mazz » Mon Feb 11, 2008 9:18 am\n\nAmy who?\n\nEvocative Music For Media\n\nimagine if John Williams and Trent Reznor met at Bernard Hermann's for lunch and Brian Eno was the head chef!\n\nhttp://www.johnmazzei.com\n\nhttp://www.taxi.com/johnmazzei\n\nit's not the gear, it's the ear!\n\nRe: Is Amy Winehouse talented?\n\nQuote\n\nPost by ggalen » Mon Feb 11, 2008 9:24 am\n\nAfter watching Amy Winehouse I suddenly realized why all those people who audition for American Idol actually believe they have what it takes to be the next star.They do have all it takes...\n\nRe: Is Amy Winehouse talented?\n\nQuote\n\nPost by ggalen » Mon Feb 11, 2008 9:26 am\n\nwindowman,I agree she has an attitude and a style.I would disagree about the pipes. She's basically an entertainer, not a singer or songwriter, I'd say.\n\nRe: Is Amy Winehouse talented?\n\nQuote\n\nPost by squids » Mon Feb 11, 2008 9:38 am\n\nI'm guessin' she had pipes but she didn't know what to do with them. Good producer helped that a lot.As for entertaining? I'm not feelin' it anywhere. I find her painful on a lot of levels, not the least of which is her pitch. I think we've all done these sad-\"I'm a victim because I'm an artiste\" types to death (sorry, no pun intended ). Too many lousy singers with a gimmick these days.\n\nsquids\n\nhttp://www.nitahope.com\n\nhttp://www.reverbnation.com/nitahope\n\nArtists make terrible slaves."
