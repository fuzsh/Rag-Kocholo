        "text": "Examples of popular music employing non-lexical vocables include:\n\nA cappella (singing without instrumental accompaniment, sometimes accompanied by a chorus of nonsense syllables)\n\nBeatboxing (vocal percussion)\n\nDoo-wop (style of rhythm and blues music that often employs nonsense syllables)\n\nKobaïan (language used by French progressive rock band Magma)\n\nHopelandic (gibberish language employed by the Icelandic post-rock band Sigur Rós)\n\nVan Morrison employed scat in his performances.[5]\n\nScat singing influenced the development of doo-wop and hip hop. It was popular enough in doo-wop that Barry Mann and Gerry Goffin made it the subject of a 1961 song, Who Put the Bomp (in the Bomp, Bomp, Bomp)\". It has also appeared in various genres of rock music. Jim Morrison of The Doors sings a chorus of slow scat on the song \"Cars Hiss By My Window\", trying to replicate a harmonica solo he had heard, as well as on the song \"Roadhouse Blues\"; scat singing also notably opens the B-side of Joe Walsh's 1973 album The Smoker You Drink, The Player You Get with the song \"Meadow\". The technique was employed in the song \"The Great Gig in the Sky\" by Pink Floyd, as well as the R&B song \"Rubber Biscuit\" by The Chips (also as by The Blues Brothers).\n\nScat also makes appearances in newer genres, including industrial music, in the chorus of Ministry's 1991 song \"Jesus Built My Hotrod\"; nu metal music, in the band Korn whose lead singer Jonathan Davis has incorporated scat singing into songs such as \"Twist\", \"Ball Tongue\", \"Freak on a Leash\", \"B.B.K.\", \"Beat it Upright\" and \"Liar\"; and the heavy metal subgenre of death metal, where scat singing is used by John Tardy of the band Obituary. Jack Black incorporates scat into several Tenacious D songs, most notably: \"Tribute\", \"Cosmic Shame\", \"Classico,\" \"Jesus Ranch,\" Low Hangin' Fruit,\" and \"Bowie\". Singer JoJo performs ad-libbed scats on the track \"Yes or No\". Other modern examples include \"Under Pressure\" by Queen (band), \"Rag Doll\" by Aerosmith, \"Under My Voodoo\" by Sublime, \"No! Don't Shoot\" by Foxy Shazam, \"Ma Meeshka Mow Skwoz\" by Mr. Bungle, \"In My Bed\" by Amy Winehouse, and \"Stuck in the Middle\" by Mika. Scatman John successfully combined scat and early-1990s electronic dance music.\n\nExamples by popular non-anglophone singers using such techniques include \"Bla Bla Bla\" by Gigi D'Agostino, Eena Mina Dika in the Bollywood film Aasha, Eduard Khil's \"I Am Glad, Cause I'm Finally Returning Back Home\" (known as \"Trololo\") sung entirely without lyrics, \"Restless\" (Fu Zao) by Faye Wong and \"Lagu Lagu\" by Sa Dingding.\n\nDue to the wide-ranging vocal styles used in popular music, occasionally songs have been mistakenly categorized as having non-lexical vocables, when in fact the singers are performing actual lyrics rendered partially (or completely) unintelligible to the ear of certain (but not all) listeners. Two famous 1960s examples are \"Louie Louie\" as recorded by The Kingsmen and \"Wooly Bully\" by Sam the Sham and the Pharaohs."
