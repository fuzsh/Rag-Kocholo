Especially the Mark Ronson produced tracks - they capture that Phil Spector & Motown vibe so well with just the right amount of modern punch, dynamics, and flair. She has an incredibly soulful voice and her more modern/almost conversational lyrics make the experience more thrilling and not just a revival record. I feel like this is done with absolute reverence for the past while not simply being a reenactment act - similar to the way say the White Stripes' influences are obvious yet they coalesce into something fresh and unique. You can tell this comes from a real place and it is of course a tragedy that she was consumed by her addictions.\n\nüëç\n\nView Author\n\n3\n\n‚ÄúBack to Black‚Äù by Amy Winehouse (2006) Always wondered what all the fuss was about. Winehouse‚Äôs vocals are interesting enough, a kind of metallic contralto, with little pitch and dynamic range, but adequate control. In terms of composition, there are many familiar jazz, R&B, (early) rock, and even swing structures here, but nothing truly innovative. Some tracks bring to the ear immediate associations with earlier music, especially ‚ÄúYou Know I‚Äôm No Good‚Äù, evocative of the retro swing Squirrel Nut Zippers‚Äô Katherine Whalen on ‚ÄúIt Ain‚Äôt You‚Äù and ‚ÄúBlue Angel‚Äù (on the album ‚ÄúHot‚Äù [1996]). Not entirely derivative, but clearly from the same mold. Winehouse‚Äôs vocal performance is a distant second to Whalen‚Äôs, however. Lyrics aren‚Äôt bad‚Äîsassiness on display. Not exactly virtue-forming, and attempting to evoke little sympathy, but entertaining enough, if the listener is willing to suspend charitable feelings. A good album and artist, but not great. 3/5\n\nüëç\n\nView Author\n\n2\n\nI try to go into these records objectively, with an open mind. Some times I just can‚Äôt. I know Amy Winehouse is a hero of sorts, but the music‚Ä¶it doesn‚Äôt feel authentic. It feels like an attempt to resell a sound from time that‚Äôs been forgotten. Modernize it, throw the word ‚Äúfuckery‚Äù in there for good measure. Voila! Manufactured nostalgia for people who weren‚Äôt alive to experience the time they‚Äôre supposed to be nostalgic for. I don‚Äôt know‚Ä¶I can‚Äôt get past that. She‚Äôs talented, but it just feels manufactured to me.\n\nüëç\n\nView Author\n\n5\n\nOk straight up for me one of the best albums of its generation.. artistry at its best..

Every song fits into an overarching style and theme, yet stand out individually so as to never feel the same as the one before or after. A really neat album that could be at home on vinyl or the crappy headphones provided with your handset (I'm so sorry Amy).\n\nüëç\n\nView Author\n\n5\n\nA soulful, beautifully written, beautifully produced record. Definitely bittersweet in retrospect but Amy Winehouse has a beautiful voice and the songs to back it up. Rehab was the big single but Back to Black is absolutely the show-stopper here. All great writing and music, every track.\n\nüëç\n\nView Author\n\n5\n\nShe came on the scene with an explosive presence. She is indicative of Phil Spector's sound and Ronnie Spector's voice. There's definitely a bewitching quality to her vocals. This is especially present in \"You Know I'm No Good.\" She's one of those artists that could sing the phone book and make it work. \"What kind of fuckery is this?\" is a question for the ages, and it sounds delightful coming from Winehouse. She sings from the heart as well. No song is a throw-away. Even the minor songs like Just Friends hit that mark of emotion she's going for. The beats are also so catchy on this album. Back to Black is practically iconic now. If Winehouse, Gaga, and Adele could have gotten together...Anyway, this album is a modern masterpiece.\n\nüëç\n\nView Author\n\n4\n\nGreat album, great voice. Terrible loss at such a young age. She even recognised her own problems in the track 'Rehab', but she obviously had too many demons. Well worth listening to.\n\nüëç\n\nView Author\n\n5\n\nPor ah√≠ le√≠ el otro d√≠a que este disco es el m√°s vendido en vinil, digamos del 2010 para ac√°, desde el renacimiento del formato. Lo escucho ahora y suena a un cl√°sico. Cuando sali√≥ resaltaba mucho del resto, un throwback, un ejercicio de nostalgia, no tan diferente si lo piensan, de The White Stripes o cosas por el estilo. Esto √∫ltimo no es ninguna cr√≠tica negativa. Pero la diferencia con otros ejercicios revivaleros de soul aqu√≠ el talento y la tragedia personal resltan. Pero me quedo con el talento y la voz, ¬øgran voz, no? Parte de la educaci√≥n sentimental de muchos, supongo. Fue parte de la m√≠a. Back to black, la canci√≥n, is some heavy shit. Se siente real. Llor√© mucho con esa rola, no por lo que trata, sino por la forma en que canta Back to black, verga. Me mata eso. Qu√© ganas de irse a la mierda dan a veces. ¬øSolo yo? Amy me comprende.\n\nüëç\n\nView Author\n\n5\n\nLove this album; it really is one in a million. Full of soul, full of energy, full of life.\n\nüëç\n\nView Author\n\n5\n\nI freely admit that I've been living under a rock since about 1995. I was of course aware of Amy Winehouse and felt the grief of her fans when she died but I'd never listened to her music. (OK, maybe I saw them do Rehab on Glee...) I didn't know what to expect but it sure wasn't this. Musically, it's a joy to hear such a clear echo of the girl groups and soul singers of the 1960s --- I especially like the sample of Ain't No Mountain High Enough in Tears Dry on Their Own. The music sounds completely modern and nicely retro. Lyrically, it's sometimes hilarious (what kind of fuckery is this?) but mostly it's depressing as hell. I hear a woman trying desperately to numb her pain while trying to sound devil-may-care. And it is obviously so much worse considering how her short life ended. I can't imagine a bleaker sentiment than Love is a Losing Game. One or two songs are misses for me but overall I really like this album. I'm angry that we lost such a talent so early and I hope that she is resting in peace.\n\nüëç\n\nView Author\n\n3\n\nLook, it's not like it's a bad album. Not even close. But the fake, nostalgic vintage sound (the fauxstalgia, if you will) wears thin really REALLY fast. The fact that, following her death, dozens of imitations have popped up like mushrooms in the shade of a fallen tree doesn't help. I'm sick of hearing vocalists chewing their vowels to try to sound like fauxstalgic caricatures of the iconic vocalists of yore. For all that, it's still a good album. I can't, in good conscience, give it less than three stars. But my sheer annoyance with the fake vintage schtick won't let me give it any more than three stars either.\n\nüëç\n\nView Author\n\n2\n\nThe compositions and arrangements can be pretty nice, albeit it's all a rather arch act of graverobbing. 'You Know I'm No Good' and 'Back To Black' are fine songs, despite their ubiquity in the 2000s. However, Al Jolson himself would blush (one would guess) at those fucking vocals. What was going on?! 'Rehab' is a terrible piece of music.\n\nüëç\n\nView Author\n\n5\n\nSongs I liked Rehab You know i'm no good Tears dry on their own He can only hold her\n\nüëç\n\nView Author\n\n5\n\nLoved this album! I used to live in an apartment and my upstairs neighbour was a huge coke head. Whenever we went into a coke rage I would press my speakers up to the ceiling and blast ‚ÄúRehab‚Äù. Nice to hear it again!\n\nüëç\n\nView Author\n\n4\n\nJust dynamite overall. What a talent. And such splendid \"fuckery.\" How much one would have liked to see her career evolve, and if stability/sobriety might have had a salubrious effect. Janis Jopin is the obvious comp, though one might prefer AW. She sells every song convincingly, infusing every note with considerable soul and almost unbearable pathos in some places (because we know how it all ended). The opener is great, of course, as are \"Me and Mr. Jones\" and \"Love Is a Losing Game.\" Hey editors: AW is not and never was a jazz singer and these aren't jazz songs (have at most a jazz aspect, and a pop-jazz one at that), though on some cuts her vocal style could accurately (if not precisely so) be described as jazzy. She's a soul / R&B / pop singer.\n\nüëç\n\nView Author\n\n3\n\nThis album was on in the background everywhere I went in the late 2000s but I never realised how short it is (35 mins). It's pretty good but it's strange that the production and that Mark Ronson sound feels a bit dated when they were trying to make an old school sounding album. The 'Amy' documentary is one of the saddest things I've ever watched.\n\nüëç\n\nView Author\n\n2\n\nSo many 5 star reviews and I just don't get it. Her voice is good. But there are a million people with great voices. The music fine and sounds old without all the cruft that comes with old music. Which I think is fine. But this is really not special in any way. It's a record made by producers for a singer with an alcohol problem.\n\nüëç\n\nView Author\n\n2\n\n\"What kind of fuckery is this?\" Its.... Amy Winehouse. IMO- people made such a big deal out of her and her character for absolutely no fucking reason, and it's a pretty highly rated album on this website, so maybe I'm missing something, but I absolutely despise \"Rehab,\" it feels very artificial and most of the rest of the tracks off the album feel as if they offered very little that was musically interesting to me. That being said, while I was actively wishing the album to end, the title track, \"Back to Black\" came on, and I found myself turning up the volume and eagerly awaiting the next hook. Good track, it will be on the playlist. Despite the star track, I can't justify a rating higher than.. 2/5\n\nüëç\n\nView Author\n\n5\n\nAnything I heard between ages 16-24 probably has an advantage over the others due to subconscious bias - this album included. With that caveat, I think this album is a stunner. It also is immortalized by her untimely death, and makes the songs that much more potent. And what a voice!

In trying to sound both old and modern, the production has the chintzy artificiality of a badly retouched photo, Vanilla Ice pasted into the Yalta Conference. Back to the Future did it better. Amy Winehouse was smart and witty with a jet plane voice that can still ambush with lines that shiv. Early on she appeared on a kid‚Äôs show play-acting in a butchers: ‚ÄúI always wanted to work with meat!‚Äù I immediately liked her, though not the music.

THEN! THEN! A glorious, soulful, retro intro leads to \"What kind of fuckery is this?\" and I think I laughed and yelled and I immediately listened to that intro about 7 times over again and this is when I knew I should have bought the damn album a long time ago. I listened to the song \"Back to Black\" about 12 times today, because I forgot it was one of my favorites ever and I missed it lots. (I also had missed some of those lyrics! Whoa!) \"Tears Dry on Their Own\" with the homage to \"Ain't no Mountain High Enough\" was so cool and good (ran out of adjectives, sorry). I was going to say that \"Addicted\" wasn't my favorite until I heard what she rhymed that word with. I was so glad to have listened to Solomon Burke the day before, because Winehouse's connection to 60s soul music is so loving and spot on. I read that she wouldn't listen to anything from after 1967. I absolutely love her voice and her songs. I love the instrumentation and the retro feel that still seems fresh and new. I loved getting a top of the tops album at this point in this project. How I wish she were still with us.\n\nüëç"
