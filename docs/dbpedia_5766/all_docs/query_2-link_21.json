        "text": "She may be a bit of a trainwreck in real life, constantly in the tabloids over in native England (heckling Bono, throwing up mid-song from being sozzled, hauling off and punching fans), but Amy Winehouse has an absolutely fantastic sound that I find immensely appealing.\n\nRaised in a family of jazz musicians in Southgate, London, Winehouse channels some of the great female singers of decades past, with a modern beat-laden sound and feisty lyrics. Take a listen to the lead track from her 2006 sophomore album, Back to Black:\n\nRehab – Amy Winehouse\n\n“Tried to make me go to rehab, I said no, no, no…”\n\nReminds me of the lyrical no-nonsense of Ernestine Anderson singing her heart out in this song, written in 1922 (minus the part condoning domestic violence; Winehouse takes a distinctly opposite tack):\n\nT’ain’t Nobody’s Bizness (If I Do) – Ernestine Anderson\n\nWinehouse also carries a feeling of long-lost vocal tapes being aired out in front of jazzy new remixes:\n\nYou Know I’m No Good – Amy Winehouse\n\nreminds me of something like this\n\nIs You Is Or Is You Ain’t My Baby (Rae and Christian remix)\n\nDinah Washington — from the excellent Verve Remixed series"
