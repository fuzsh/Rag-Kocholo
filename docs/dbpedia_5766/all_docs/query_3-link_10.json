        "text": "Although she only released two albums, Amy Winehouse was a sensation during her career. Her aesthetic crossed over from music to design quickly — a cross between early 60s soul-girl glamour and post-punk edginess.\n\nAmy Winehouse Impact & Discography\n\nKnown for her deep, contralto vocals and retro-eclectic songs, Amy Winehouse took the music world by storm in the 2000s. Much of pop music was sanitized and “managed” — and she was not. Fans embraced her brash humor and rugged visual style which balanced out her soulful vocals. At the same time, the media focused more on her troubled personal life than her musical ability and achievements.\n\nVisual Legacy\n\nWinehouse’s “look” was inspired by 1960s soul girl groups (i.e. the Ronettes). Allegedly her hairdresser, Alex Foden, gave her the distinctly overblown, often-messy beehive. Her Cleopatra-like cat-eye mirrored eye makeup of the same era. These overblown styles were accompanied by dark, grunge-style clothing (think black denim mini skirts) and retro-style tattoos.\n\nMagazines labeled her as a sex kitten or filthy-mouthed diva or raw talent depending on the accompanying paparazzi images. Her battles with substance abuse and mental illness often received more attention than her work or music awards.\n\n\\\n\nWhenever you saw Amy Winehouse in candid shots, she favored black layers with pops of red. Her black hair, offset by a bleached strip, was often adorned with roses or red flowers. I chose colors that had a subtly lived-in saturation to mirror these down-to-earth tones.\n\nFor occasions and concerts, you could find Amy in pin-up styles and hyper-saturated colors. While she often used a cherry-red, she also favored tattoo and hot-rod paint inspired tones like canary yellow, blazing purple and punky pink. I kept these tone bright and because she popped in these intense hues.\n\nRetro combinations were favored throughout her career — she loved a little red or black dress. She also leaned toward high-contrast makeup and was barely recognizable in images without her bold hair and lip combination.\n\nFinally, you could see a constant love for the old in all of her work. Everything from the early sixties, both rugged and glamourous spilled out of her storytelling. So, I chose a soft, sepia-inspired combination that you might find a box of grandpa’s photographs.\n\nI listened to Amy Winehouse’s Discography in order and these are the songs I added to my playlist.\n\nWhenever I feel like I know of an artist without truly knowing their work, I enjoy reviewing it to journey through their artistic expression. In this case, I soaked in the soulful stylings of Amy Winehouse’s two albums.\n\nFrank\n\nHer debut album, Frank, released in 2003 to positive reviews. However, in an interview with The Observer, Winehouse said:\n\nSome things on this album make me go to a little place that’s fucking bitter. I’ve never heard the album from start to finish. I don’t have it in my house. Well, the marketing was fucked, the promotion was terrible. Everything was a shambles. It’s frustrating, because you work with so many idiots—but they’re nice idiots. So you can’t be like, “You’re an idiot.” They know that they’re idiots.\n\nDiscussing her album in the same interview, she explained, “I believe in casual sex. I know it’s sad that I think cheating on people is fine. But I think it’s like smoking a spliff. Oops, I’ve gobbed on meself!”\n\nThe writer Garry Mulholland seemed equally perplexed by her market position. He notes her sex appeal and how men leer at her walking in the restaurant while pointing out all the boxes she doesn’t fit.\n\n“There are so many reasons why Amy Winehouse could – should – be a huge star. Talent. Charisma. Songs. Voice. Attitude. But there’s one big reason why she may not be. That box she implores you to take? She just won’t fit inside it. Sounds Afro-American: is British-Jewish. Looks sexy: won’t play up to it. Is young: sounds old. Sings sophisticated: talks rough. Musically mellow: lyrically nasty.”\n\nSongs I added:\n\nMoody’s Mood for Love / Teo Licks\n\nMr. Magic\n\nBack to Black\n\nHer next album released in 2006 — with most of the lyrics focused on her recent breakup. Similar to her first album, critics loved it from release while also struggling to understand her persona. By this time, she was a tabloid star with a reputation for trouble and being troubled.\n\nSongs I added:\n\nRehab\n\nJust Friends\n\nBack to Black\n\nWake Up Alone\n\nHe Can Only Hold Her\n\nAddicted\n\nStay Inspired\n\nIf you enjoyed this post, please follow me in your favorite platform.
