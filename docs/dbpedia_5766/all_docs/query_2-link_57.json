        "text": "The late Amy Winehouse had one of those voices from which I recoil: the British showbiz voice that’s brassy, unafraid of histrionics; the kind of voice that requires illustrative hand gestures while singing. The descendants of the Shirley Bassey school include everyone from Annie Lennox to Adele. But in the right circumstances Winehouse’s belting commanded attention, in large part because Winehouse already sounded like a sample; for many fans she signified “soul,” a taxonomical distinction which in recent years has come to mean the dramatizing of self backed by “real” instruments.\n\nAs I’ve written offhandedly in a few places today, the stupid lizards — male, most of them — that could not assess Winehouse without resorting to a variant on “slut,” “skank,” or “bitch” yet consider Keith Richards a bad ass disgust me. Moreover, the relentlessness with which social media, accelerating changes brought forth years ago from our obsession with therapy, legitimizes the notion that appreciation requires insights drawn from the artist’s biography is a menace which must be combated. We’ll know soon enough what happened to Winehouse. For the moment let’s appreciate her legacy. Above I posted what I still consider her greatest moment. Winehouse and Ghostface prove such a delicious combination that it’s a shame they couldn’t have recorded a Marvin and Tammi-style duets album."
