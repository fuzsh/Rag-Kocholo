        "text": "As a singer, Tony Bennett could make an audience laugh, cheer and gasp with wonder. But when the great crooner heard that Amy Winehouse had died just months after they recorded together, he could only weep.\n\nHe described her death as “one of the saddest things that ever happened in [his] life” – a remark that underscored the extraordinary bond the two had forged when they came together at Abbey Road Studios in March 2011 to cover the 1930s jazz standard “Body and Soul” for his Duets II album.\n\nBennett, who has died aged 96, was an immense talent who survived to see himself become living legend. He was a masterful interpreter of the Great American Songbook and one of the great crooners, with hits including “I Left My Heart in San Francisco”.\n\n“Tony was one of the most splendid people who ever lived. Kind, loving, talented and generous, he never let us down,” said Nancy Sinatra, the daughter of his great contemporary Frank Sinatra, on Friday.\n\nBefore hanging up his mic just three years ago after an Alzheimer’s diagnosis, Bennett had sung with some greats: Barbra Streisand, Lady Gaga and George Michael. Yet he recognised Winehouse as both a unique talent and a lost soul.\n\nIn her triumphs and her struggles, he also perhaps caught reflections of his younger self. He and Winehouse shared an ability to inhabit a piece of music so utterly that, when you heard them sing, it was as if you were encountering the song for the first time. They took something old, even staid, and made it brand new.\n\nBut Bennett also understood they each had demons. Though he had the fuddy image of an elder statesman in his later years, in the 70s, drugs had driven him to the brink. Once, he had almost gone over the edge when he overdosed on cocaine in 1979, and his second wife, Sandra Grant, had found him unconscious.\n\nTheir Abbey Road duet is believed to have been Winehouse’s final recording. It was captured on film and is a searing moment in Asif Kapadia’s 2015 documentary Amy. Winehouse, in a dark place amid spiralling substance addiction, is nervous – and though Bennett does his best to set her at ease, she is visibly in awe of him.\n\nBennett came away from that encounter proud – and also regretful. When she died that July, aged 27, he wondered whether he might have done more – told her that he, too, had found himself in a dark place and that, with the support of friends, he had climbed out.\n\n“Should I have told her that I’d contended a little bit myself and knew how you can fall into a destructive cycle, but I also knew that you could bring yourself back?, he wrote in his autobiography Just Getting Started.\n\n“Would it have made a difference if someone she considered an idol had said to her something like, ‘You’re my idol. You are a once-in-a-lifetime talent. Please don’t take that from the world’?”\n\nWinehouse was not the only modern pop star to see Bennett as a mentor and a collaborator. He made two records with Lady Gaga. Yet if those albums are swingingly enjoyable, they lack the intensity he brought to his duet with Winehouse. It was clear that what connected them went beyond music.\n\nHe may have recognised her as an old soul born out of time. As far as he was concerned, music had become significantly less interesting when rock ‘n’ roll took over.\n\n“Rock ‘n’ roll was a terrible thing to happen to music,” he told me when I interviewed him in 2010 ahead of the tour that would see him meet Winehouse for the first time. Even over the phone he was clearly a star from a different era: he called me directly himself and addressed me as “Mr Power” (“Mr Powa” in his Long Island accent). He was flinty, roguish, charming. And he had opinions about music.\n\n“Before that,” he continued, “you had magnificent musicians like Benny Goodman and great singers like Peggy Lee and Billie Holiday. It was based on real educated musicians.”\n\nA lesser artist might have felt threatened by Winehouse and her talent. Bennett, though, knew who he was and what he could do – and saw other artists as collaborators rather than rivals. He felt the same about Sinatra, 10 years his senior and a singer he was constantly likened to.\n\n“He was the master. Did I get sick of being compared to him? Not really. The only comparison is that we kept our integrity,” he told me. “We didn’t do any cheap songs. We didn’t do songs that would insult the audience. He considered me his disciple his whole life.”\n\nIf Bennett was Sinatra’s disciple, then Winehouse, in a way, was Bennett’s. Their first contact had been across the oceans. In 2008, Winehouse won the Record of the Year Grammy for Back to Black. However, she could not travel to Los Angeles because she was denied a visa. Instead, she accepted the award via video link from London – with Bennett “handing” her the gong from across the Atlantic.\n\nThe next time they met was backstage at the Royal Albert Hall, where Bennett played two nights in 2010. His recollections of that night were vivid. “She said, ‘You know, two years ago, I won a Grammy, and I wasn’t excited about winning the Grammy, but that Tony Bennett was announcing.’ She was a big fan of mine, and I was surprised because she [was] so young.”\n\nBennett was keen to duet with her. Some in his circle were wary – by 2011, and Duets II, she was as notorious for her drinking as she was celebrated for her singing. He insisted that she be invited.\n\n“She said she was nervous because she had never recorded a song with someone she considered one of her idols,” Bennett remembered. “After running through a few bars, she said she hadn’t recorded for a long time – her only reference to the problems she’d been living through.”\n\nBennett would outlive her by more than a decade. Yet though their time together had been brief, the connection left a lasting impact. With a career stretching back decades, there are many chapters in the life and times of Tony Bennett.\n\nBut his musical relationship with Amy Winehouse was real and true – a huge and enduring part of both their stories."
