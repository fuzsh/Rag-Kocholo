        "text": "Captain Bacardi said:\n\nMr Bill said:\n\n--Tattoos on women... --What a turn off...!\n\n--Mr Bill\n\n...This reminds me of something I heard the other day...: You know how a lot of women are having those tattoos on their lower back? Those are called \"Tramp Stamps\" now...\n\nCapt. Bacardi\n\nBeware...! One gal I knew long ago, actually has her \"Tramp Stamp\" in a very large design/image/shape of The Sun ...:\n\n\\/\n\n>0<\n\n/\\\n\n(Art is for Reference Only; not \"flesh specific\"...) inkshield:​\n\nBelow it, is name of her Mom (who died when she was 7-years-old) in Egytian Hyroglyphics... inkshield:\n\nShe showed it to me, when she noticed I had a similar design on the back of my Bugle Boy T-Shirt...:\n\n\\/\n\n>(B)<\n\n/\\\n\n(Art is for Reference Only; not \"garment specific\"...) inkshield:​\n\nDave\n\n...Tried to as \"Passive\" about it as possible, but unfortunately I didn't get to see any \"others\" she may have had, :twitchy: 'cept for the typical one under the left shoulder...! :|\n\n\"Does anybody know about Amy Winehouse?\" somebody asked. Well, I sure do!! She is the best hope for pop music today as we know it! I first heard about her due to my ongoing email relationship with Giant Step* *music. They emailed me Amy's album and from the first note, I was hooked!!! She has taken the so called sixties \"girl-group\" sound, and fashioned them with lyrics that reflect a more modern sensibility than the cheery 'up with people', 'moon in June', we're gonna be in love forever optimism that was the theme for those songs of that era.\n\nRather, she takes a darker look at life, and yet surprisingly, she does it with good sense of humor thrown in! Her hit \"Rehab\" is based on her real life battles with alcohol(she has said since that she is little by little trying to kick her habit.) \"You know I'm No Good\" was based on a past relationship she had with an old boyfriend, and for me the best cut that I've heard so far is \"Me and Mr. Jones\", where she sings 'what kind of f----ery is this/you made me miss the Slick Rick gig'; when I first heard this, I was shocked, but then I started laughing! It really is that funny and that good!(In case any of you didn't know, Slick Rick is an old school rapper based out of England)\n\nHer popularity couldn't have come at a better time, what with the popularity of the movie \"Dreamgirls\", and in fact the title cut of her new cd samples the piano riff of \"Baby Love\". I don't have the cd yet, but you best believe I'm going to get it! As far as looks wise , to me she is cute, but looks much better with her hair down. Her Ronnie Spector/Supremes retro look with her hair all done up in a beehive and Cleopatra eyelashes doesn't really work for her, in my opinion. One of the previous posters had insinuated that she was black, but she isn't. She's Jewish and from what I understand, from the east end of London.(Where the English soap opera,\"Eastenders\" is based upon.)\n\nAnyway, in a pop music world where pablum rules, her sound is a breath of fresh air in today's wasteland of music. Her first cd was more jazz oriented, so that should show you how creative really is...she and another young English singer, Corrine Bailey Rae, and another young and immensely talented singer from Finland by the name of Janita are the best hopes for pop music these days. Hope you all discover and enjoy their music!\n\n*I should add that when Giant Step e-mails you a cd, they only e-mail samples of the album, like 3 or 4 songs to see if you like it enough to buy the cd."
