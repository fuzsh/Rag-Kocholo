        "text": "As we embrace ​the new ​year, Shatter the ​Standards casts ​a spotlight on ​a select ​group of R&B ​musicians poised ​to make waves ​in the ​months to come. ​This diverse ​ensemble of 20 ​artists, each ​with their unique ​flair and ​genre-spanning influences, stands ​ready to ​capture your attention ​and become ​a recurring theme ​in your ​daily soundscape.\n\nThe ​identity of ​these artists is ​distinct and ​vivid. Some you may have heard, some that are new to you. Give them a try.\n\nAlex Vaughn\n\nA refreshing break ​is doing ​wonders for Alex ​Vaughn. Following ​the release of ​her project ​The Hurtbook in ​October 2022 ​and its subsequent ​deluxe edition, ​the singer has ​dedicated much ​of 2023 to ​touring as ​an opening act ​for Ari ​Lennox on the ​age/sex/location tour. ​Now, at 29 ​years old, ​she finds herself ​with a ​well-deserved respite. However, ​it's not ​all relaxation for ​Vaughn; her ​record label, Love ​Renaissance (LVRN), ​has organized a ​creative gathering ​in Port Antonio. ​Here, amidst ​tranquil settings, she ​collaborates with ​esteemed music producers ​like Bryan-Michael ​Cox to pen ​new tracks. ​Vaughn's swift ascent ​in the ​R&B genre marks ​her as ​one of its ​most emotionally ​resonant voices and ​gifted composers ​within just a ​year. Her ​deeply personal lyrics, ​coupled with ​smooth vocal delivery ​and relatable ​persona, have garnered ​her favorable ​likenesses to iconic ​singers from ​the '90s and early aughts.\n\nAliah Sheffield\n\nAliah Sheffield, upon ​her introduction ​to the Def ​Jam roster, ​crafted a debut ​released last ​year (These Songs ​Are for ​Anyone Sick of ​Earth) that ​resonates with heartfelt ​sincerity. Each ​song on the ​project unfolds ​as a narrative ​rich in ​emotional depth, drawing ​from personal ​introspection and an ​unflinching look ​at human vulnerabilities. ​The tracks ​are a reflection ​of Sheffield’s ​bold and honest ​approach to ​songwriting, addressing the ​struggles of ​solitude, the complexities ​of human ​error, and the ​pursuit of ​genuine self-expression. As ​Sheffield continues ​to create, her ​music promises ​to be a ​source of ​anticipation for those ​who seek ​solace and understanding ​through her ​melodies and words.\n\nThe Amours\n\nJakiya ​Ayanna and Shaina ​Aisha, the ​sister act known ​as The ​Amours, have carved ​out a ​unique auditory identity ​that is ​distinct and enchanting. ​Residing in D.C., their vocal ability was nurtured ​in the ​pews of their ​local church, ​blossoming over time ​into an ​impressive display of ​harmonic sophistication. ​Both sisters are ​proud graduates ​of The Duke ​Ellington School ​of The Arts ​in their ​hometown. The duo ​has recently ​returned from a ​period of ​quietude, eager to ​share their ​latest creative efforts. ​With “Don’t ​Deserve,” their fresh ​single heralding ​from the soon-to-be-released ​EP Around ​the Way Girl, ​they mark ​a significant return ​to the ​music scene. This ​track is ​graced with their ​characteristic harmonious ​arrangements and radiates ​warmth reminiscent ​of classic R&B, ​ensuring that ​listeners will echo ​its sentiments ​with fervor. Behind ​this new ​release stands DJ ​Camper’s production ​expertise, alongside Harold ​Lilly Jr., ​who brings his ​experience as ​a lauded songwriter ​and executive ​to guide the project.\n\nAnnie Tracy\n\nAnnie Tracy honed ​her performing ​talents with the ​Opera House ​Theatre Co., taking ​center stage ​in numerous musicals. ​Her connection ​to her hometown’s ​theatrical scene ​remained strong even ​as she ​pursued higher education ​elsewhere, compelling ​her return for ​performances, notably ​embodying the iconic ​country singer ​in “Always, Patsy ​Cline” during ​2019 and 2021. ​As a ​vocalist and composer, ​Tracy channels ​her considerable vocal ​strength into ​crafting pop music ​imbued with ​substantial R&B influences. ​Her track ​“Times It by ​Two” exemplifies ​this fusion, showcasing ​her dynamic ​and robust singing ​style that ​has roots in ​her early ​days on the ​musical theater ​stage.\n\nÄyanna\n\nHailing from the ​dynamic urban ​environment of East ​London, Äyanna ​enters the R&B ​music circuit ​with a vision ​to secure ​her position as ​a leading ​vocalist. Her background ​is as ​eclectic and full ​of life ​as the songs ​she creates, ​drawing influence from ​an array ​of musical traditions ​such as ​Reggae, R&B, and ​Soul. These ​influences were part ​of her ​upbringing in a ​neighborhood brimming ​with cultural expressions, ​complemented by ​the musical tastes ​of her ​English and Jamaican ​heritage.\n\nThe ​release of “Party ​Tricks” in ​2019 showcased Äyanna’s ​ability to ​craft songs that ​resonate deeply ​with emotional experiences ​despite being ​one of her ​early compositions. ​This ​single not only ​secured her ​a spot on ​BBC’s Music ​Introducing platform but ​also garnered ​attention from prominent ​figures within ​the industry at ​Love Renaissance ​(LVRN), leading to a record deal and the release of In a Perfect World. With each ​performance and ​a new piece of ​music, Äyanna ​continues to chart ​a course ​toward solidifying her ​place among ​the upcoming talents ​destined for ​acclaim in R&B.\n\nCoco Jones\n\nOnce a Disney ​child star, ​Coco Jones has ​since committed ​herself to honing ​her vocal ​talents with an ​intensity that ​mirrors the rigorous ​routines of ​world-class performers. Her ​dedication involves ​emulating Beyoncé’s demanding ​practice of ​combining singing with ​physical exertion ​on a treadmill. ​This staunch ​commitment to refining ​her craft ​has propelled Jones ​into the ​spotlight on her ​terms. ​Her EP What ​I Didn’t ​Tell You received ​critical acclaim ​and led to ​her being ​honored with five ​Grammy nominations. ​The project features ​the standout ​ballad “ICU,” which ​caught enough ​attention to inspire ​a remix ​from none other ​than Justin ​Timberlake. Recognition for ​Jones’s efforts ​spans several categories: ​she is ​in contention for ​best new ​artist, as well ​as accolades ​across R&B categories, ​including best album, ​traditional performance, song, ​and performance. ​We hope that ​her full-length ​debut is around the corner.\n\nElmiene\n\nElmiene’s ascent in ​the music ​industry is a ​narrative of ​swift and considerable ​acclaim. The ​British-Sudanese vocalist has seen ​his popularity surge ​at an ​impressive pace. Insistent ​on making ​his mark, he ​seizes every ​fleeting opportunity to ​revel in ​the growing recognition ​of his ​work. With two ​extended plays ​under his belt, ​Elmiene finds ​himself edging closer ​to the ​forefront of the ​musical vanguard. ​His contribution extends ​well beyond ​transient trends. He ​represents a ​reconnection with the ​foundational elements ​of R&B that ​have drifted ​from the mainstream ​spotlight. For ​upcoming artists, he ​shines as ​a guiding influence, ​one whose ​impact will likely ​inform future ​generations within the genre.\n\nHailey Kilgore\n\nA native of ​Humble, Texas, and nurtured in ​Portland, Oregon, ​Hailey Kilgore has ​been alluring ​with her performances ​from a ​tender age. Her ​aspirations have ​indeed taken flight, ​as Kilgore’s ​talents have graced ​Broadway stages ​along with television ​and film ​screens, affirming her ​flourishing career ​in performing arts. ​The recent ​venture into music ​marks a ​bold new chapter ​for Kilgore. ​Her EP Desire ​and Devotion ​was released in March of last year, brimming with ​R&B and ​pop melodies reminiscent ​of past ​eras yet distinctly ​modern in ​their execution. After ​years of ​honing her craft ​and capturing ​hearts with her ​vocal gift, ​Kilgore now embraces ​this fresh ​pursuit with sparkle.\n\nJack Freeman\n\nHailing from Houston, ​Jack Freeman ​surfaces as a ​vocalist whose ​message is steeped ​in the ​essence of love. ​His style, ​both sultry and ​seamless, has ​been shaped under ​the influence ​of illustrious figures ​such as ​Donny Hathaway and ​Chaka Khan. ​Having admired industry ​titans, Freeman’s ​career trajectory ​has seen ​him share stages ​with renowned ​artists; he has ​warmed up ​crowds for soulful ​powerhouses, including ​Bilal and John ​Legend. Furthermore, ​his performances have ​complemented shows ​headlined by Anthony ​Hamilton, the ​legendary Maze featuring ​Frankie Beverly, ​and so many ​others. Freeman’s ​talents caught the ​attention of ​Bryan-Michael Cox, a close collaborator of Jermaine Dupri and a ​multi-hyphenate with ​GRAMMY accolades to ​his name. ​The two have ​joined forces ​creatively, and anticipation ​builds for ​Freeman’s forthcoming album, Nina, which ​promises to be ​a showcase ​of their synergistic efforts.\n\nJai’Len Josey\n\nAt the age ​of 25, ​Jai’Len Josey has ​already carved ​a distinctive path ​in the ​world of music ​and performance. ​Hailing from Atlanta, ​she found ​herself immersed in ​the vibrant ​beats of hip-hop ​and the ​smooth rhythms of ​R&B from ​an early age. ​This rich ​musical environment helped ​shape her ​artistic voice, with ​influences from ​pop melodies infused ​with the ​raw energy of ​live soul ​performances. Fast forward ​to 2021, ​and Josey celebrated ​a significant ​achievement as a ​songwriter, ​contributing to Ari ​Lennox’s hit ​“Pressure,” which soared ​to the ​top spot on ​Billboard’s Adult ​R&B AirPlay chart. ​Her collaboration ​with esteemed creatives ​such as ​Jermaine Dupri, Bryan-Michael ​Cox, and ​Johnta Austin led ​to the ​track receiving Gold ​certification from ​the RIAA. In ​her latest ​project, Southern Delicacy, ​released under ​Def Jam last ​year, Josey ​offers a collection ​that seamlessly ​blends personal storytelling ​with lush ​orchestral backdrops. The ​EP showcases ​her ability ​to convey heartfelt ​narratives of ​ambition and romantic ​yearnings through ​a series of ​tracks that ​exude both intimacy and grandeur.\n\nKhamari\n\nWith just a ​single project ​released, Boston’s own ​Khamari has ​captured the attention ​of R&B ​fans, amassing millions ​of streams ​and headlining shows. ​His debut ​release, A Brief ​Nirvana, dropped ​in May, painting ​vivid narratives ​of love lost, ​the search ​for meaning, and ​profound personal ​growth found in ​moments of ​vulnerability. Khamari’s vocal ​delivery combines ​both the sharpness ​of a ​thunderbolt and the ​gentleness of ​sweetened syrup, with ​his narrative ​style enveloping you ​in the ​raw emotions he ​expresses through ​his music. The ​anticipation surrounding ​his future contributions ​to R&B ​is undeniable, as ​his introductory ​work has already ​left an ​impressive impact on the genre.\n\nLAYA\n\nResiding in Staten ​Island, vocalist ​LAYA has carved ​a base ​for herself in ​the R&B ​genre with her ​atmospheric and ​minimalist style. Her ​music, while ​nodding respectfully to ​1990s influences, ​is unmistakably forward-looking. ​The year ​2020 saw the ​release of ​“Sailor Moon,” a ​dreamy and ​languid single that ​captured attention ​and paved the ​way for ​her Warner Records ​partnership. This ​collaboration bore fruit ​in 2022 ​with the release ​of Um, ​Hello, an EP ​that showcased ​LAYA’s evolving sound. ​Not one ​to rest on ​her laurels, ​LAYA followed up ​in 2023 ​with the more ​focused offering ​Bet That. As ​tracks like ​“F’d Up” and ​“Need 2 ​Know” continue to ​garner heavy ​rotation, there is ​growing anticipation ​around what creative ​directions she ​will explore next. ​With an ​eye on the ​future, enthusiasts ​and critics alike ​are eager ​to discover what ​LAYA is ​preparing for 2024.\n\nLekan\n\nFrom Columbus, Ohio, ​Lekan infuses ​the contemporary music ​scene with ​a distinctive sound ​that bridges ​generations and styles. ​His robust ​stature is as ​commanding on ​stage as his ​velvety baritone, ​which delivers lyrics ​brimming with ​emotion and ardor. ​Lekan’s musical ​creations draw inspiration ​from the ​foundational roots of ​R&B while ​artfully incorporating elements ​from various ​other periods and ​genres. His ​work harmoniously blends ​soulful melodies ​with modern pop ​sensibilities and ​the raw energy ​of trap, ​crafting a sound ​that is ​both refreshing and ​deeply connected ​to musical traditions.\n\nLeon Thomas\n\nLeon Thomas, once ​a familiar ​face on the ​Nickelodeon series ​Victorious, sharing the ​screen with ​Ariana Grande, may ​soon add ​‘Grammy winner’ to ​his credentials. ​His collaborative efforts ​on SZA’s ​widely celebrated track ​“Snooze” have ​positioned it as ​a frontrunner ​in the race ​for Best ​R&B Song—a testament ​to his ​belief in manifestation ​and his ​dedication to honing ​his craft. ​Alongside Khristopher Riddick-Tynes ​as part ​of The Rascals, ​Thomas has ​shaped sounds for ​an impressive ​roster of artists, including Drake, ​Post Malone, and ​Chris Brown. ​His work extends ​to talents ​like Zendaya, Jack ​Harlow, Meghan ​Trainor, Toni Braxton, ​and Ty ​Dolla $ign, showcasing ​versatility and ​a keen ear ​for production. ​The list continues ​with 6LACK, ​Ella Mai, Kehlani, ​Giveon, Jessie ​Reyez, and not ​least, the ​one and only Babyface, who ​counts among ​Thomas’s mentors. In ​August last ​year, he finally ​unleashed his ​debut album, Electric Dusk, ​which became one ​of the ​sleepers, and it’s ​only up ​from here.\n\nNatanya\n\nNatanya from North ​London has ​already carved out ​a niche ​for herself in ​the music ​industry with her ​debut EP, ​Sorrow at Sunrise. ​This young ​producer, singer-songwriter, and ​instrumentalist captivates ​with an authentic ​portrayal of ​“real-life stories frozen ​in time,” ​delivering them through ​unique phrasing ​and poetic lyrics. ​Her experimental ​production layers add ​depth to ​each track, distinguishing ​her as ​a notable figure ​in the ​musical domain. She ​did not ​hesitate to reveal ​the depths ​of her creativity ​in this ​initial extended play. ​Although her ​lyrics are drawn ​from deeply ​personal experiences, she ​openly shares ​her work, inviting ​us into ​her introspective world. ​Through this ​openness and her ​distinctive style, ​Natanya is rapidly ​becoming a ​prominent voice worth following.\n\nNo Guidnce\n\nThe dynamic group ​from London, ​No Guidnce, has ​revitalized a ​classic genre with ​a modern flair. ​Capturing the attention ​of an ​expansive TikTok following ​in 2021, ​their performances—unaccompanied by ​instruments and ​set against the ​naturally pulsating ​acoustics of a ​car park—garnered ​them significant online ​acclaim. These ​renditions led to ​the release ​of their own ​material in ​2023. As they ​step onto ​the scene, R&B ​enjoys a ​resurgence in both ​critical acclaim ​and commercial triumph, ​underscored by ​its recognition at ​the Brit ​Awards with a ​dedicated category—a ​nod to the ​genre’s current ​vibrancy.\n\nOctober London\n\nFrom South Bend, ​Indiana, emerges ​October London, an ​artist whose ​work in the ​R&B genre ​is marked by ​soul-stirring vocal ​delivery and the ​poetic precision ​of his lyrics. ​Upon joining ​forces with Death ​Row Records, ​a label synonymous ​with Snoop ​Dogg’s influential legacy, ​in 2016, ​London captured ​attention within ​the musical domain. ​One of his recent ​offerings, The Rebirth ​of Marvin, ​not only underscores ​his unique ​artistic identity but ​also invites ​parallels to the ​esteemed Marvin ​Gaye, reflecting a ​deep connection ​to the roots ​of soul ​music. October London’s ​ascent reflects ​his ability to ​convey profound ​emotions through his ​singing and ​to create vivid ​narratives with ​his words. As ​he forges ​his path ​in the ​industry, his work ​resonates deeply ​with those who ​appreciate the fusion of ​storytelling and ​melody that characterizes ​enduring R&B ​music.\n\nSaint Harison\n\nHailing from a ​family where ​melodies were ever-present, ​Saint Harison ​was nurtured among ​music heads ​who revered iconic ​vocalists such ​as Whitney Houston. ​This environment ​sowed the seeds ​of his ​musical inclinations, ​leading him ​to admire the ​raw expression ​found in the ​works of ​renowned figures like ​Amy Winehouse. ​Although initially he ​envisioned a ​career under the ​bright lights ​of London’s West ​End, an ​awakening during his ​university years ​redirected his aspirations ​towards the ​recording industry.\n\nSaint ​Harison’s initial ​steps into the ​spotlight came ​through unadorned renditions ​of songs ​by Billie Eilish, ​Frank Ocean, ​and Jazmine Sullivan ​shared across ​online platforms. These ​covers marked ​the beginning of ​what would ​soon become a ​rapidly ascending ​path in music. ​His debut ​EP further solidified ​his position ​as one to ​watch, showcasing ​a blend of ​influences and ​an ability to ​captivate with ​authenticity.\n\nToday, Saint ​Harison stands ​at an exciting ​juncture. With ​a year that ​has seen ​remarkable achievements, his ​appetite for ​success only grows. ​Behind the ​scenes, new tracks ​are taking ​shape, ready to ​join an ​already diverse collection ​awaiting release. ​Meanwhile, his digital ​presence continues ​to expand; a ​growing legion ​of TikTok supporters ​and Spotify ​listeners bear witness ​to his ​evolving sound. It ​is clear ​that for Saint ​Harison, these ​accomplishments are merely ​the prologue ​to a promising ​career in ​music.\n\nTA Thomas\n\nTA Thomas honed ​his craft ​on the piano ​within the ​walls of his ​community church. ​Nurtured by familial ​support to ​cultivate his burgeoning ​talent, he ​soon graced the stages ​at local ​showcases and was ​swept up ​in a tour ​with the ​acclaimed James Fortune ​and Fiya. ​Transitioning from his ​role in ​the R&B ensemble ​Next Town ​Down, Thomas embraced ​the spotlight ​as a solo ​artist with ​his introductory EP, ​Caught Between ​2 Worlds, crafted ​under the ​guidance of producer ​Camper. This ​work allowed him ​to unfurl ​his vocal deftness, ​steeped in ​both passion and ​Southern elegance, ​offering an honest ​expression of ​his art.\n\nUNA MIA\n\nThe rise of ​UNA MIA, ​an alt-pop R&B ​artist hailing ​from Toronto, marks ​a new ​chapter in the ​Canadian music ​scene. Her performance ​on COLORxSTUDIOS ​of “Lose You” ​mesmerizes with ​its blend of ​smooth vocals ​and compelling lyrics, ​set against ​the backdrop of ​rich R&B ​melodies. The cultural ​background of ​her youth, interlaced ​with Balkan ​folk tunes and ​the soulful ​echoes of Etta ​James, has ​deeply influenced her ​artistry. Formal training in ​classical voice, opera, ​and performing arts marks UNA ​MIA’s journey through ​music. This solid ​foundation in ​diverse musical disciplines ​has shaped ​her into a ​multifaceted performer. ​As she gears ​up to ​unveil her first ​EP, UNA ​MIA offers listeners ​a glimpse ​into her introspective ​world. Described ​as diary-like narratives, ​her upcoming ​work reflects a ​profound dive ​into self-discovery and maturation."
