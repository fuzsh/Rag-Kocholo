        "text": "Spoiler alert: This story includes details of the new movie 'Back to Black' released on May 17.\n\nBefore reading this review, there's something you should know about me. Amy Winehouse lives on my arm—permanently inked on my triceps.\n\nWinehouse, the fiery \"Rehab,\" \"Tears Dry on Their Own\" and \"Back to Black\" singer, is more than likely the reason I am a music journalist today. Her music captured hearts globally—mine is just one of many.\n\nFor years, I've devoured her catalogue, familiarized myself (all too well) with the events of her life, studied the relationships she had to those in her personal and professional world, and attempted to understand what made Amy, Amy.\n\nThe new \"Back to Black\" film, which walks the line between a biopic and a dramatic retelling of Winehouse's relationship with ex-husband Blake Fielder-Civil, failed to capture the same Amy the world has missed since her death, due to accidental alcohol poisoning, in 2011 at 27 years old.\n\nBut—how could it?\n\nIn 2015, the documentary \"Amy\" was released, the Asif Kapadia film won an Oscar, a Bafta and the MTV Movie Award.\n\nThe documentary, which is shorter than \"Back to Black,\" delves into nearly every corner of Winehouse's world. Kapadia conducted over 100 interviews of Winehouse's friends and family for the narrative.\n\nThe Winehouse Estate, lead by Winehouse's father, Mitch Winehouse, was vocal in their disdain for the film.\n\nMitch Winehouse said the film was \"horrible,\" telling the filmmakers, \"‘You should be ashamed of yourselves. You had the opportunity to make a wonderful film and you’ve made this.\"\n\nHe was displeased with being portrayed as greedy and exploitative of his daughter (yes—he's the man who said Winehouse didn't have to go to rehab in the famous \"If my daddy thinks I'm fine...\" lyric).\n\nOther men in Winehouse's life were not let off the hook either in the documentary, including Fielder-Civil and her manager Raye Cosbert.\n\nSo, with the full backing of the Winehouse Estate this time, another Amy Winehouse film was born: \"Back to Black.\"\n\nWhat story does 'Back to Black' tell?\n\n\"Back to Black\" will be released in American theaters on May 17. Streaming details after the release are forthcoming.\n\nThe film, a rated R movie that runs 122 minutes, stars Marisa Abela (\"Industry,\" \"Rogue Agent\") as the British singer-songwriter and was directed by Sam Taylor-Johnson of \"Fifty Shades of Grey\" and written by Matt Greenhalgh.\n\nThe story is told through Winehouse's eyes, starting in her Jewish home in North London as she looks over photos with her \"Nan,\" Cynthia (Lesley Manville) and sings \"Fly Me To The Moon\" with her dad, Mitch (Eddie Marsan).\n\nWe see Winehouse sitting in her childhood bedroom writing songs, the subsequent release of her first album \"Frank\" and her time playing pool at a bar called The Good Mixer.\n\nIt is there that she meets her future husband Blake Fielder-Civil (Jack O'Connell).\n\nThe two fall deeply in love, but have an on-again-off-again whirlwind romance which eventually is overtaken by drugs and toxicity.\n\nFrom there, album \"Back to Black\" is born, focused on heartbreak, yearning and a relationship underlined with mutual self-destruction.\n\nIn 2006, Winehouse's \"Nan\" dies from lung cancer, which is when Winehouse begins spiraling deeper into addiction. Fielder-Civil, who is arrested due to burglary, eventually divorces Winehouse while he's behind bars.\n\nThe movie ends after Winehouse goes to a rehab and is seemingly on the mend, then a screen with text states that she died in 2011.\n\nWas Marisa Abela convincing as Amy Winehouse?\n\nAbela's Winehouse, while thoroughly researched, is not convincing.\n\nThe 27-year-old actress dresses like Winehouse, talks like Winehouse and walks like Winehouse, but it appears more like a gimmicky impersonation or well-executed costume than an accurate representation.\n\nIn preparation for the role, Abela worked with vocal coaches to impersonate Winehouse's North London dialect and singing voice. Much of the singing in the film is Abela herself, not Winehouse.\n\nWhile Abela's singing voice is sonically pleasing, it isn't close enough to Winehouse's voice to have the same effect on audience members.\n\nSome of Winehouse's tunes with her original vocals do play throughout the biopic, like \"Know You Now\" and \"Rehab,\" creating a little bit of confusion: Is this Winehouse or Abela singing?\n\nWinehouse's full catalogue of music was permitted for use in the film, providing the option for lip syncing. In celebrating such a unique voice, the watered-down replication of it weakened the film.\n\nNobody can sing like Amy Winehouse except Amy Winehouse.\n\nLasty—and most importantly—is the absence of Winehouse's bite.\n\nAbela worked to adopt Winehouse's mannerisms, which resulted in many neck sassy swivels, head bobs and shuffly, dainty running in high heels, but it still fell flat.\n\nWinehouse was sharp with reporters, outwardly sarcastic and easily bored (onstage, on television and during interviews). Once, Winehouse was arrested for assaulting a fan.\n\nThe film shows a softer, sweeter side of Winehouse that casted a sparkly, Hollywood-colored sheen over any sort of grit, aggression and vulgarity.\n\nWhen Abela did channel an aggressive Winehouse who got into a fight outside a pub after a gig, it wasn't believable.\n\nWhat did 'Back to Black' forget?\n\n\"Back to Black\" left out a few key players and moments.\n\nProducer Salaam Remi Gibbs (Nas, Alicia Keys, Doja Cat), one of the biggest players in Winehouse's creative world, was only shown in a brief scene. Musician and DJ Mark Ronson, who produced Winehouse's hit \"Rehab,\" was not pictured.\n\nTony Bennett, one of Winehouse's musical inspirations, was mentioned briefly and his hit \"Body and Soul\" was featured in the soundtrack. Shortly before Winehouse died, she fulfilled the lifelong dream of singing with Bennett, duetting on the same song.\n\nBennett was not depicted in the film, aside from presenting Winehouse with her 2008 Oscar win.\n\nThere were some plot choices, too, that differed from the story told in the \"Amy\" documentary.\n\nFielder-Civil has said on the record that he introduced Winehouse to hard drugs, like heroin and crack cocaine. The film shows Winehouse beginning to use drugs after her first breakup with Fielder-Civil instead of initially with him.\n\nAdditionally, the film depicts Winehouse going to rehab after she and Fielder-Civil divorced in 2009. While Winehouse was in and out of rehab a couple times, one of her first attempts at getting clean came when she went to rehab with Fielder-Civil as a couple, according to the \"Amy\" documentary.\n\nIn the movie, too, Fielder-Civil divorces Winehouse when she visits him in prison, saying that he got clean and realized she wasn't good for him.\n\nWhile that much is true, Winehouse was also detoxing at the time in St. Lucia and pictured in the arms of another man, which made its way to the tabloids.\n\nThe ultimate reason for their divorce was that Fielder-Civil claimed Winehouse cheated on him with four men. Winehouse did confess to Fielder-Civil that she was having an affair in 2008.\n\nThere was no mention of the affairs in the film aside from Fielder-Civil expressing his jealousy during the jail visit.\n\nMentions of Winehouse's depression, bulimia and self-harm were only brought up in passing.\n\nWhile the demons of addiction were shown, many people, including Winehouse's own brother, believe the years of bulimia also played into Winehouse's death.\n\nAddiction played a major role in Winehouse's life, yes, but according to her mother, bulimia was around longer (mid-teens and onward). Those watching \"Back to Black\" would not have known the role bulimia played in Winehouse's life.\n\nThe portrayal of Mitch Winehouse also differed from his portrayal in the \"Amy\" documentary.\n\nMitch Winehouse, whose vocal disapproval of the \"Amy\" documentary included him being painted as a villain, is portrayed more favorably in this film.\n\n“The fact that there's no villains in the piece—the only villain is the addiction—made me want to do it. I don’t play villains—I only play human beings,\" said Marsan, who played Mitch, in the show's production notes.\n\nViewers see the Mitch, here, that told Amy not to go to rehab, but we don't see the Mitch that brought a camera crew to Amy's time in St. Lucia when he came to visit, aiming to make a film about their life. Or, the Mitch that seems more concerned about an American tour than his daughter's welfare.\n\nThe documentary paints Mitch as exploitative. \"Back to Black\" becomes a response to that indictment.\n\nWhat did 'Back to Black' do well?\n\nThe film sought cooperation from Universal Music and Sony regarding the use of Winehouse's music.\n\nThey received assistance from producer Giles Martin (The Rolling Stones, Elton John) and Winehouse's original band, like bass player Dale Davis and backing singer Ade Omotayo, who serve as musical consultants.\n\nAll tracks in the film were re-recorded at Martin’s Abbey Road Studios, where Winehouse made her last ever recording with Tony Bennett.\n\nAll the music felt produced in a way would've gleaned the Winehouse stamp of approval.\n\nThe heavy focus on Winehouse's relationship with her grandmother, Cynthia, was also a moving part of the film. Many Winehouse fans know about her pin-up Cynthia tattoo, but this film dove into the woman behind that image.\n\nWinehouse's \"Nan\" is where she got her style inspiration and her interest in jazz music (she was a jazz singer who had dated Ronnie Scott).\n\nO'Connell's interpretation of Fielder-Civil was charming and assured. As O'Connell lip-synced to The Shangri-Las, performing for Winehouse, viewers could see the playful side of him that Winehouse fell for.\n\nO'Connell's ability to make the audience see beyond his addiction was masterful and subtle. He spent time with the real Fielder-Civil, now 42, in preparation for the role.\n\nThe recreation of Winehouse's 2007 Glastonbury concert, too, was well-executed. In it, viewers see the raw effects of addiction on Winehouse at a giant amphitheater concert.\n\nThe depiction was heart-breaking, a raw retelling of what it must've felt like for a star to perform during the throes of addiction."
