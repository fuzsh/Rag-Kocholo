Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? is one of Philip K. Dick's most influential works, serving as the basis for the classic film, Blade Runner, and inspiring generations of science fiction and cyberpunk writers since its publication in 1968. In a dystopian future, Rick Deckard is a bounty hunter tasked with "retiring" escaped androids that closely resemble humans. When a group of these advanced androids flees to Earth from space colonies, Deckard's assignment grows complicated as he grapples with ethical and existential dilemmas concerning humanity, empathy, and the indistinct lines between the artificial and the real. For collectors, Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? has always been one of Dick's most sought-after titles. This Collector's Edition was published by The Easton Press and bound in full leather. Includes artwork by Richard Powers and an introduction by Pamela Sargent.
