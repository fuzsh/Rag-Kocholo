        "meta_description": "Unlock the more straightforward side of Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? with this concise and insightful summary and analysis!\n\nThis engaging summary presents an analysis of Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? by Philip K. Dick, which follows the bounty hunter Rick Deckard on his quest to \"retire\" androids in an imagined post-apocalyptic version of San Francisco. The androids, who are treated as subhuman but are indistinguishable from humans in their appearance, and at times even in their behaviour, raise a host of questions about empathy, the role of technology in our lives and what it is that makes us human. Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? is arguably Philip K. Dick's most famous novel, largely due to its status as the source material for the blockbuster film Blade Runner starring Harrison Ford. Dick was a pioneering and prolific science writer, and is also known for his novels The Man in the High Castle and A Scanner Darkly.\n\nFind out everything you need to know about Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? in a fraction of the time!\n\nThis in-depth and informative reading guide brings you:\n\n• A complete plot summary\n\n• Character studies\n\n• Key themes and symbols\n\n• Questions for further reflection",
