        "text": "Examining the schedule for January 3, 1992, he saw that a businesslike professional attitude was called for. \"If I dial by schedule,\" he said warily, \"will you agree to also?\" He waited, canny enough not to commit himself until his wife had agreed to follow suit.\n\n\"My schedule for today lists a six-hour self-accusatory depression,\" Iran said.\n\n\"What? Why did you schedule that?\" It defeated the whole purpose of the mood organ. \"I didn't even know you could set it for that,\" he said gloomily.\n\nAs he started toward his car Barbour called after him hurriedly, \"Um, I won't say anything to anybody here in the building.\"\n\nPausing, Rick started to say thanks. But then something of the despair that Iran had been talking about tapped him on the shoulder and he said, \"I don't know; maybe it doesn't make any difference.\"\n\n\"But they'll look down on you. Not all of them, but some. You know how people are about not taking care of an animal; they consider it immoral and anti-empathic. I mean, technically it's not a crime like it was right after WWT. But the feeling's still there.\"\n\nEmpathy, he once had decided, must be limited to herbivores or anyhow omnivores who could depart from a meat diet. Because, ultimately, the emphatic gift blurred the boundaries between hunter and victim, between the successful and the defeated. As in the fusion withMercer, everyone ascended together or, when the cycle had come to an end, fell together into the trough of the tomb world. Oddly, it resembled a sort of biological insurance, but double-edged. As long as some creature experienced joy, then the condition for all other creatures included a fragment of joy. However, if any living being suffered, then for all the rest the shadow could not be entirely cast off. A herd animal such as man would acquire a higher survival factor through this; an owl or a cobra would be destroyed.\n\nEvidently the humanoid robot constituted a solitary predator.\n\n\"Babyhide,\" Rick said. He stroked the black leather surface of the briefcase. \"One hundred percent genuine human babyhide.\" He saw the two dial indicators gyrate frantically. But only after a pause. The reaction had come, but too late. He knew the reaction period down to a fraction of a second, the correct reaction period; there should have been none.\n\n\"Thanks, Miss Rosen,\" he said, and gathered together the equipment again; he had concluded his retesting. \"That's all.\"\n\n\"You're leaving?\" Rachael asked.\n\n\"Yes,\" he said. \"I'm satisfied.\"\n\nTo Eldon Rosen, who slumped morosely by the door of the room, he said, \"Does she know?\" Sometimes they didn't; false memories had been tried various times, generally in the mistaken idea that through them reactions to testing would be altered.\n\nEldon Rosen said, \"No. We programmed her completely.”\n\n“But I think toward the end she suspected.\" To the girl he said, \"You guessed when he asked for one more try.\"\n\nPale, Rachael nodded fixedly.\n\n\"An android,\" he said, \"doesn't care what happens to any other android. That's one of the indications we look for.\"\n\n\"Then,\" Miss Luft said, \"you must be an android.\"\n\nThat stopped him; he stared at her.\n\n\"Because,\" she continued, \"Your job is to kill them, isn't it? You're what they call — \" She tried to remember.\n\n\"A bounty hunter,\" Rick said. \"But I'm not an android.\"\n\n\"This test you want to give me.\" Her voice, now, had begun to return. \"Have you taken it?\"\n\nGarland said, \"That damn fool Resch.\"\n\n\"He actually doesn't know?\"\n\n\"He doesn't know; he doesn't suspect; he doesn't have the slightest idea. Otherwise he couldn't live out a life as a bounty hunter, a human occupation — hardly an android occupation.\" Garland gestured toward Rick's briefcase. \"Those other carbons, the other suspects you're supposed to test and retire. I know them all.\" He paused, then said, \"We all came here together on the same ship from Mars. Not Resch; he stayed behind another week, receiving the synthetic memory system.\" He was silent, then.\n\nOr rather it was silent.\n\nPreoccupied, Phil Resch drove by reflex; his progressively more gloomy train of thought continued to dominate his attention. \"Listen, Deckard,\" he said suddenly. \"After we retire Luba Luft — I want you to — \" His voice, husky and tormented,broke off. \"You know. Give me the Boneli test or that empathy scale you have. To see about me.\"\n\n\"We can worry about that later,\" Rick said evasively. \"You don't want me to take it, do you?\" Phil Resch glanced at him with acute comprehension. \"I guess you know what the results will be; Garland must have told you something. Facts which I don't know.\"\n\n\"I see a pattern. The way you killed Garland and then the way you killed Luba. You don't kill the way I do; you don't try to — Hell,\" he said, \"I know what it is. You like to kill. All you need is a pretext. If you had a pretext you'd kill me. That's why you picked up on the possibility of Garland being an android; it made him available for being killed.”\n\n\"If it's love toward a woman or an android imitation, it's sex. Wake up and face yourself, Deckard. You wanted to go to bed with a female type of android — nothing more, nothing less. I felt that way, on one occasion. When I had just started bounty hunting. Don't let it get you down; you'll heal. What's happened is that you've got your order reversed. Don't kill her—or be present when she's killed — and then feel physically attracted. Do it the other way.\"\n\nRick said, \"I took a test, one question, and verified it; I've begun to empathize with androids, and look what that means. You said it this morning yourself. 'Those poor andys.' So you know what I'm talking about. That's why I bought the goat. I never felt like that before. Maybe it could be a depression, like you get. I can understand now how you suffer when you're depressed; I always thought you liked it and I thought you could have snapped yourself out any time, if not alone then by means of the mood organ. But when you get that depressed you don't care. Apathy, because you've lost a sense of worth. It doesn't matter whether you feel better because if you have no worth — \"\n\n\"What about your job?\" Her tone jabbed at him; he blinked. \"Your job,\" Iran repeated. \"What are the monthly payments on the goat?\" She held out her hand; reflexively he got out the contract which he had signed, passed it to her.\n\nPutting his laser tube away Rick said, \"I can't do what Phil Resch said.\" He snapped the motor back on, and a moment later they had taken off again.\n\n\"If you're ever going to do it,\" Rachael said, \"do it now. Don't make me wait.\"\n\n\"I'm not going to kill you.\" He steered the car in the direction of downtown San Francisco once again. \"Your car's at the St. Francis, isn't it? I'll let you off there and you can head for Seattle.\" That ended what he had to say; he drove in silence.\n\n\"Thanks for not killing me,\" Rachael said presently.\n\n\"Hell, as you said you've only got two years of life left, anyhow. And I've got fifty. I'll live twenty-five times as long as you.\"\n\n\"Rick,\" she said, \"I have to tell you something. I'm sorry. The goat is dead.\"\n\nFor some reason it did not surprise him; it only made him feel worse, a quantitative addition to the weight shrinking him from every side. \"I think there's a guarantee in the contract,\" he said. \"If it gets sick within ninety days the dealer — \"\n\n\"It didn't get sick. Someone\" — Iran cleared her throat and went on huskily — \"someone came here, got the goat out of its cage, and dragged it to the edge of the roof.\"\n\n\"And pushed it off?\" he said.\n\n\"Yes.\" She nodded.\n\n\"Did you see who did it?\"\n\n\"I saw her very clearly,\" Iran said. \"Barbour was still up here fooling around; he came down to get me and we called the police, but by then the animal was dead and she had left. A small young-looking girl with dark hair and large black eyes, very thin. Wearing a long fishscale coat. She had a mail-pouch purse. And she made no effort to keep us from seeing her. As if she didn't care.\"\n\nIt would have been rewarding to talk to Dave, he decided. Dave would have approved what I did. But also he would have understood the other part, which I don't think even Mercer comprehends. For Mercer everything is easy, he thought, because Mercer accepts everything. Nothing is alien to him. But what I've done, he thought; that's become alien to me. In fact everything about me has become unnatural; I've become an unnatural self.\n\n\"Do you want to use the mood organ? To feel better? You always have gotten a lot out of it, more than I ever have.\"\n\n\"I'll be okay.\" He shook his head, as if trying to clear it, still bewildered. \"The spider Mercer gave the chickenhead, Isidore; it probably was artificial, too. But it doesn't matter. The electric things have their lives, too. Paltry as those lives are.\"\n\nExamining the schedule for January 3, 1992, he saw that a businesslike professional attitude was called for. \"If I dial by schedule,\" he said warily, \"will you agree to also?\" He waited, canny enough not to commit himself until his wife had agreed to follow suit.\n\n\"My schedule for today lists a six-hour self-accusatory depression,\" Iran said.\n\n\"What? Why did you schedule that?\" It defeated the whole purpose of the mood organ. \"I didn't even know you could set it for that,\" he said gloomily.\n\nAs he started toward his car Barbour called after him hurriedly, \"Um, I won't say anything to anybody here in the building.\"\n\nPausing, Rick started to say thanks. But then something of the despair that Iran had been talking about tapped him on the shoulder and he said, \"I don't know; maybe it doesn't make any difference.\"\n\n\"But they'll look down on you. Not all of them, but some. You know how people are about not taking care of an animal; they consider it immoral and anti-empathic. I mean, technically it's not a crime like it was right after WWT. But the feeling's still there.\"\n\nEmpathy, he once had decided, must be limited to herbivores or anyhow omnivores who could depart from a meat diet. Because, ultimately, the emphatic gift blurred the boundaries between hunter and victim, between the successful and the defeated. As in the fusion withMercer, everyone ascended together or, when the cycle had come to an end, fell together into the trough of the tomb world. Oddly, it resembled a sort of biological insurance, but double-edged. As long as some creature experienced joy, then the condition for all other creatures included a fragment of joy. However, if any living being suffered, then for all the rest the shadow could not be entirely cast off. A herd animal such as man would acquire a higher survival factor through this; an owl or a cobra would be destroyed.\n\nEvidently the humanoid robot constituted a solitary predator.\n\n\"Babyhide,\" Rick said. He stroked the black leather surface of the briefcase. \"One hundred percent genuine human babyhide.\" He saw the two dial indicators gyrate frantically. But only after a pause. The reaction had come, but too late. He knew the reaction period down to a fraction of a second, the correct reaction period; there should have been none.\n\n\"Thanks, Miss Rosen,\" he said, and gathered together the equipment again; he had concluded his retesting. \"That's all.\"\n\n\"You're leaving?\" Rachael asked.\n\n\"Yes,\" he said. \"I'm satisfied.\"\n\nTo Eldon Rosen, who slumped morosely by the door of the room, he said, \"Does she know?\" Sometimes they didn't; false memories had been tried various times, generally in the mistaken idea that through them reactions to testing would be altered.\n\nEldon Rosen said, \"No. We programmed her completely.”\n\n“But I think toward the end she suspected.\" To the girl he said, \"You guessed when he asked for one more try.\"\n\nPale, Rachael nodded fixedly.\n\n\"An android,\" he said, \"doesn't care what happens to any other android. That's one of the indications we look for.\"\n\n\"Then,\" Miss Luft said, \"you must be an android.\"\n\nThat stopped him; he stared at her.\n\n\"Because,\" she continued, \"Your job is to kill them, isn't it? You're what they call — \" She tried to remember.\n\n\"A bounty hunter,\" Rick said. \"But I'm not an android.\"\n\n\"This test you want to give me.\" Her voice, now, had begun to return. \"Have you taken it?\"\n\nGarland said, \"That damn fool Resch.\"\n\n\"He actually doesn't know?\"\n\n\"He doesn't know; he doesn't suspect; he doesn't have the slightest idea. Otherwise he couldn't live out a life as a bounty hunter, a human occupation — hardly an android occupation.\" Garland gestured toward Rick's briefcase. \"Those other carbons, the other suspects you're supposed to test and retire. I know them all.\" He paused, then said, \"We all came here together on the same ship from Mars. Not Resch; he stayed behind another week, receiving the synthetic memory system.\" He was silent, then.\n\nOr rather it was silent.\n\nPreoccupied, Phil Resch drove by reflex; his progressively more gloomy train of thought continued to dominate his attention. \"Listen, Deckard,\" he said suddenly. \"After we retire Luba Luft — I want you to — \" His voice, husky and tormented,broke off. \"You know. Give me the Boneli test or that empathy scale you have. To see about me.\"\n\n\"We can worry about that later,\" Rick said evasively. \"You don't want me to take it, do you?\" Phil Resch glanced at him with acute comprehension. \"I guess you know what the results will be; Garland must have told you something. Facts which I don't know.\"\n\n\"I see a pattern. The way you killed Garland and then the way you killed Luba. You don't kill the way I do; you don't try to — Hell,\" he said, \"I know what it is. You like to kill. All you need is a pretext. If you had a pretext you'd kill me. That's why you picked up on the possibility of Garland being an android; it made him available for being killed.”\n\n\"If it's love toward a woman or an android imitation, it's sex.
