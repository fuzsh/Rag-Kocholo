        "text": "Do Androids Dream Of Electric Sheep?\n\nDICK, Philip K.\n\nItem Number: 41033\n\nNew York: Doubleday and Company, 1968.\n\nFirst edition of this science fiction cornerstone. Octavo, original cloth. Filmmaker Bertram Berman’s copy, with his signature along with his address at CBS on front endpaper, directly beneath the rubber-stamped address of Raritan Productions, Inc. Berman was a program executive and producer with CBS, who in 1968 purchased the option of Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? Dick, clearly thrilled about the prospect of a film adaptation of one of his works, sent a lengthy letter to Berman full of ideas about how the book could be translated to film. Dick provided Berman with suggestions on everything from casting (Gregory Peck for Deckard; Dean Stockwell for Jack Isidore), tone, plotting…even down to the particular sound the weapons would make. And, of course, “There could be room for more sex.” Berman’s project failed to get off the ground, and his option expired, opening the way for other parties and, eventually, Ridley Scott. The full text of Dick’s May 21, 1968 letter was published in The Philip K. Dick Society Newsletter #18 (August, 1988). Fine in a near fine dust jacket with a few small closed tears. An exceptional example with noted provenance.\n\nSet in a post-apocalyptic near future, the novel follows Rick Deckard, a bounty hunter who is faced with retiring six escaped androids. At its core, the novel explores the essential issues of the meaning and destiny of humanity. \"It is one of Dick’s most tantalizing explorations of the human capacity for empathy” (New York Times). “A key novel in Dick’s canon” (Anatomy of Wonder II-326). Nominated for the 1968 Nebula Award and basis for the 1982 film Blade Runner directed by Ridley Scott and starring Harrison Ford and the 2017 sequel Blade Runner 2049 starring Ford and Ryan Gosling."
