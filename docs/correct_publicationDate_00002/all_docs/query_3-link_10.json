        "text": "Two posts from my blog and a discussion going on over on the OU/BBC discussion board:\n\n1.\n\nWhat is an android?\n\nIf you strip away the pseudo-scientific gobbledegook, and come to the realisation that androids not only don't exist, but have nothing to do with science, what are you left with?\n\nPersonification.\n\nAndroids are a literary device - a personification (possibly the ultimate personification).\n\nWhich brings us to the question, what do they personify?\n\nDick seems to have taken the idea of a force, let us call it intellect - although I am not happy with that - and given it as the major component of android persona. Because it is a full personification and not a simple representation, the android needs to be given a much more rounded character - so cruelty is thrown in, and ambition; there is a lust for power and even sexual satisfaction.\n\nBut, as with all personification, it is an abstraction - anything more would take the android into full humanity.\n\nThe point of personification might be to bring similarities to the fore - but the device doesn't work unless there is a significant difference - we love to admire the cleverness of the authors wit in bringing the sweet and the sour together.\n\nInteresting that the question, 'What makes us human?' comes to mind: Should we be asking, 'What stops the androids from breaking out of the mould of personification?'\n\n(Sorry, double excess - espresso and leisure time.)\n\n2.\n\nBeen watching TV again!\n\nThis one was a design programme - and a couple of 'scientists pointed out we like symetry because the human face is symetrical.\n\nAn aside was, 'the most satisfying sort of column is a caryatyd': Empathy.\n\nLoud church bells, explosions and fireworks.\n\nThe difference between the android and the human is empathy.\n\nBut, the android is a personification - what is personification but empathy?\n\nIs there a delicious paradox at the heart of, 'Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep'?\n\n[FONT=&quot]Are we attracted to the android because we empathise with its humanness: But, it is its lack of empathy that stops it from being human.\n\n[/FONT]\n\nFirst: Some interesting thoughts here. However, there are a couple of points I'd like to address. The first is your opening question: \"What is an android?\"\n\nWell, if you're speaking strictly of the novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?, then we're talking about a particular choice of metaphor. If we're speaking in the broader sense, the definition is \"an automaton in the form of a human being\", the word was coined ca. 1720-1730, from Neo-Latin androides, a compound word using andr-, a variant of andro- (a combining form meaning \"male,\" used in the formation of compound words, from Gk. andro(s), gen. of aner man; aking to Skt. nar-, Albanian njeri, person, L. Nero) and \"-oid\", meaning \"resembling\"; it was originally coined for the mechanical toys or automata that were so popular in the eighteenth century, becoming adopted by writers later on to differentiate betwen the \"mechanical men,\" or robots of obvious metallic structure, and those given a more \"human\" appearance, including synthetic (or organic) skin, hair, eyes, etc. (as someone else has mentioned, the \"robots\" in Karel Capek's R.U.R. are in fact androids rather than the more common -- at that time -- image of mechanical men); though the term has been used more broadly to include both, as long as they had the general structure of a human being. Most generally, though, it has been used as a metaphor for an underclass of one form or another; marginalized human beings.\n\nInteresting that the question, 'What makes us human?' comes to mind: Should we be asking, 'What stops the androids from breaking out of the mould of personification?'\n\nThe difference between the android and the human is empathy.\n\nBut, the android is a personification - what is personification but empathy?\n\nIs there a delicious paradox at the heart of, 'Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep'?\n\n[FONT=&quot]Are we attracted to the android because we empathise with its humanness: But, it is its lack of empathy that stops it from being human.[/FONT]\n\nAnd here I think we get to the heart of the matter... it isn't that the androids lack empathy... their caring for one another shows that, and Deckard's reactions emphasize that... it is that they are perceived as lacking humanity, because they are created beings rather than natural beings; in other words, there is something different about them: their origins (and the fact that they are programmed genetically for obsolescence -- a further method of setting them off from human empathy); just as, with slavery, there was something different about those made slaves, whether it be skin color, geographical location, or simply the fact that they belonged to a different tribe and therefore weren't \"real\" human beings. In other words, the \"androids\" are, perhaps, more \"human\" than the human beings. I'd say that's where the attraction lies: we perceive them, in the end, as being more human, more empathetic, than the humans themselves; it is the \"real\" humans who lack the empathy, not their simulacrae."
