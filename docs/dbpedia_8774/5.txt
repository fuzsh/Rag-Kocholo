The party wishes to relocate the Limpopo capital from Polokwane to Giyani, is campaigning for the reintroduction of the death-penalty, and advocates offering a R2500 monthly subsidy to new university students.[1]

In July 2018 the party issued a list of demands to the Greater Giyani Local Municipality requesting more public toilets, stalls for hawkers, and that the council recover the money invested in the collapsed VBS Bank, threatening to shut down Giyani if its demands were not met.[1]

In September 2018, the GLC opened a case of hate speech and incitement of violence against the chairman of the soccer club Black Leopards, David Thidiela, stating that Thidiela's criticism of the referee amounted to "serious hatred of the official and his ethnic group [the] Vatshonga Machangana people‚Äù.[2]

The party has received criticism for its name, which is reminiscent of the Gazankulu bantustan.[3]
