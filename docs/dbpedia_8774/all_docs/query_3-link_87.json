        "text": "The historic Giyani Greenstone Goldfield has been struggling to regain its former attraction. Dr Nicolaas C Steenkamp took a tour of the area to see what remains of the old mining operations and what the future may hold.\n\nThe Giyani Greenstone goldfield (formerly the Sutherland goldfield) is located in the far north of the Limpopo province, north of the town of Giyani from where its new name hails. The rolling hills and waving brown grass along with the Mopani trees hide the bustle that once was a very active gold mining region.\n\nThe Sutherland goldfield was discovered during the settlement and development of the Zuid-Afrikaanse Republiek (ZAR) by gold prospectors as they criss-crossed the country in search of riches. This led to the development of boom-and-bust gold rush towns along the Eastern Escarpment, all the way up to the Limpopo Valley and into the then Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe). The establishment of the town of Bend supported the mining operations in the Sutherland goldfield. Various small mines were established with some prospects amounting to no more than a couple of trenches or exploration pits and shafts. A number of factors led to the demise of the Sutherland goldfield – the highly erratic mineralisation of gold which is characteristic of greenstone gold deposits, along with the refractory nature of the mineralisation, the presence of malaria in the area and the final nail in the coffin was the outbreak of the Second Anglo-Boer War.\n\nWalking through the fields, small remnants of the mining activities and foundations of buildings can still be found. The remainder have been swallowed up by nature, hiding the potential wealth of gold.\n\nLater geopolitical shifts resulted in the re-establishment of some of the more lucrative mines, such as the increase in the gold price and the drive of the South African government to create work opportunities and industries in the newly established self-governing homelands of Venda and Gazankulu. These marginal mines could be operated with government support – shafts were sunk, processing facilities constructed and the countryside became dotted with rock dumps and tailings dams. The end of the homelands and self-governing territories also spelled the end of these mining operations. Most of the infrastructure was stripped away and today a visit to these sites reveals little more than the remnants of the vertical shafts, the open pit excavations and tailings facilities that still remain on site.\n\nThe area has also not attracted ASM (Artisanal and Small-scale Mining) since the closure of the mines, with very few artisanal operations in the area. Some of the historic mines have been fenced off and are held in private ownership. The majority of the historic mines have, however, reverted back to the South African government as custodian and now reside under the Limpopo Development corporation (LimDev) established to develop the mining potential of the Limpopo province. Various attempts have been made over the last decade to re-establish some of the mining operations, with the old Fumani mine being the crown property in the region. To date, however, apart from a short-lived exploration project, the properties have not been able to attract investment to develop. The other large former mines were placed into the Giyani Gold portfolio but have since been reverted to the province and now form part of the Rock Island project.\n\nThe gold mineralisation is hosted in the Greenstone formations of the Giyani Greenstone Belt (GGB), which is 17km wide and has a strike length of 70km. The belt has an overall NE-trend, but to the west, the GGB splits into a northern Khavagari arm and a southern Lwaji arm separated by granitoid gneiss (the Klein Letaba Gneiss) and younger granite. The Lwaji arm has more or less the same trend as the main part of the belt, but the Khavagari arm has been rotated into an east-west orientation. The supracrustal rocks of the GGB have been subjected to amphibolite facies metamorphism. Peak metamorphism was followed by uplift and the influx of CO2-rich aqueous fluids. This rehydration event occurred during the exhumation of the Limpopo Complex along the Hout River Shear Zone (HRSZ) and was responsible for shear-zone hosted alteration of the rocks in the GGB and the formation of the orogenic gold deposits.\n\nThe gold mineralisation is found in association with sulphidised zones, carbonate veins and associated with the banded ironstone formations (BIF) that occur in the area. Apart from gold, the area also contains previously economic mineralisation of magnesite. There are also a range of other sub-economic minerals and occurrences of gemstone that have largely been depleted, such as emerald.\n\nDriving past these historic operations on the back roads to the Kruger National Park, one can only but wonder what life was like during the times these mines were active, and how it will potentially breathe life back into the region should an investor be found to resuscitate these operations. "
