        "text": "Gazankulu was the homeland of the Shangaan and Tsonga people in South Africa. It was divided over two territories, west of the Kruger National Park, and its capital was at Giyani. It did not accept independence from South Africa, but was granted self-government in 1973. However, like the other nine homelands, the rest of the world did not accept it as a state. Since 1994, the former homeland of Gazankulu has formed part of the Limpopo Province."
