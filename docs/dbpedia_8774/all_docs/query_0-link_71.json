        "text": "Gazankulu today\n\nGazankulu, as a political entity, no longer exists, it is today part of Limpopo and Mpumalanga provinces. In 1994, Gazankulu was sub-divided into different municipalities cross-cutting linguistic and cultural boundaries, a feature of a new democratic South Africa. The western district of former Hlanganani was allocated to Makhado Local Municipality (130 000 people), the southern part of Hlanganani was divided and allocated to Greater Letaba Local Municipality (45 000 people), while the eastern part of Hlanganani was allocated to Greater Giyani Local Municipality (35 000 people). In total, Hlanganani district lost 80 000 people to both the Greater Giyani and Greater Letaba local Municipalities in 1994, while Makhado local municipality was the biggest beneficiary of the former Hlanganani district, it took more than 130 000 people from the former Hlanganani in 1994 when the district was broken-up. The Greater Giyani Local Municipality was merged with some parts of Bolobedu (Northern Sotho speaking), Malamulele was merged with Thulamela Local Municipality and Lulekani was merged with Namakgale to form a new Municipality with Phalaborwa known as Ba-Phalaborwa Local Municipality. Shiluvane, under Hosi Muhlaba and other Tsonga areas in Ritavi has been merged to form Greater Tzaneen Local Municipality. In Bushbuckridge, the whole area has been merged with Northern Sotho and the Swazi to form Bushbuckridge Local Municipality. East of Hazyview, Mkhuhlu and other areas around Hoxane have been merged with Tshabalala tribal authority (Swazi) to form Mbombela Local Municipality. So in 1994, Gazankulu has been divided into 8 large local municipalities, totalling 1.7 million Tsonga speakers, who mixed with the Swazi, the Venda and the Northern Sotho to form diverse communities with others South Africans, an ideal that former President Nelson Mandela fought for during his lifetime.\n\nThe population of the former Gazankulu, according to the 2011 census, is spread out as follows; Limpopo 1.1 million or 17% of the province, Mpumalanga 500 000 or 11.5% of the province and Gauteng 800 000 or 4% of the province. Total population is 2,3 million or 5% of South Africa's population. All the Tsonga people working and schooling in Gauteng comes from Gazankulu, so the 800 000 Tsonga people in Gauteng have their homes in Gazankulu, it can therefore be assumed that when these Tsonga people return to Limpopo and Mpumalanga during Easter and December holidays, the Tsonga population in both Limpopo and Mpumalanga rises sharply.\n\nDistricts in 1991\n\nDistricts of the homeland and population in the 1991 census.\n\nMhala: 253,297\n\nRitavi: 143,702\n\nGiyani: 212,226\n\nMalamulele: 179,326\n\nLulekani: 38,770\n\nHlanganani: 127,450\n\nGazankulu lost kingdoms"
