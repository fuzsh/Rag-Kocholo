        "text": "Giyani Metals Corp. (CVE:EMM) shareholders will doubtless be very grateful to see the share price up 145% in the last quarter. But if you look at the last five years the returns have not been good. You would have done a lot better buying an index fund, since the stock has dropped 35% in that half decade.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Giyani Metals\n\nWith zero revenue generated over twelve months, we don't think that Giyani Metals has proved its business plan yet. This state of affairs suggests that venture capitalists won't provide funds on attractive terms. So it seems that the investors focused more on what could be, than paying attention to the current revenues (or lack thereof). For example, investors may be hoping that Giyani Metals finds some valuable resources, before it runs out of money.\n\nCompanies that lack both meaningful revenue and profits are usually considered high risk. There is usually a significant chance that they will need more money for business development, putting them at the mercy of capital markets. So the share price itself impacts the value of the shares (as it determines the cost of capital). While some such companies do very well over the long term, others become hyped up by promoters before eventually falling back down to earth, and going bankrupt (or being recapitalized).\n\nOur data indicates that Giyani Metals had CA$690,574 more in total liabilities than it had cash, when it last reported in March 2019. That makes it extremely high risk, in our view. But since the share price has dived -8.2% per year, over 5 years, it looks like some investors think it's time to abandon ship, so to speak. You can click on the image below to see (in greater detail) how Giyani Metals's cash levels have changed over time. You can click on the image below to see (in greater detail) how Giyani Metals's cash levels have changed over time.\n\nIt can be extremely risky to invest in a company that doesn't even have revenue. There's no way to know its value easily. Given that situation, would you be concerned if it turned out insiders were relentlessly selling stock? I'd like that just about as much as I like to drink milk and fruit juice mixed together. You can click here to see if there are insiders selling.\n\nA Different Perspective\n\nIt's nice to see that Giyani Metals shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 32% over the last year. Notably the five-year annualised TSR loss of 8.2% per year compares very unfavourably with the recent share price performance. This makes us a little wary, but the business might have turned around its fortunes. Investors who like to make money usually check up on insider purchases, such as the price paid, and total amount bought.
