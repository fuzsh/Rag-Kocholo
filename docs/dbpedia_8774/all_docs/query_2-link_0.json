        "text": "Town in Limpopo, South Africa\n\nPlace in Limpopo, South Africa\n\nGiyani is a town situated in the north-eastern part of Limpopo Province,[2] South Africa. It is the administrative capital of the Mopani District Municipality and a former capital of the defunct Gazankulu Bantustan. The town of Giyani is divided into seven sections: Section A, Section D1, Section D2, Section E, Section F, Kremetart, and Giyani CBD. Risinga View and Church View are new residential areas in Giyani, but they fall under the local traditional leaders. The Giyani CBD is nicknamed Benstore, and this name is commonly used by residents of the region. Giyani is surrounded by a number of villages with rich Tsonga cultural activities, administered by the Greater Giyani Local Municipality.\n\nProf. Hudson Ntsanwisi, the former Chief Minister of Gazankulu, played a vital role in establishing the town. Giyani is situated at the intersection of R578 (South Africa) and R81. It is located in the heart of the Limpopo Bushveld, on the northern bank of the Klein Letaba River [1], west of Kruger National Park. Situated in the northern portion of the former Gazankulu, Giyani was established in the 1960s as the administrative center for the Tsonga people. Giyani lies 470 km north-east of Johannesburg by road, 104 km from Tzaneen, 105 km from the Phalaborwa Gate of the Kruger National Park, and 35 km from Malamulele.\n\nIn 1969, the Gazankulu government named a new ward at Elim Hospital 'Giyani Ward' in honor of the Gazankulu capital. The current Mayor of Greater Giyani municipality is Thandi Zitha of ANC.[3]\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nGiyani was established during the 1960s as the capital city of Gazankulu, on land belonging to the Homu Royal Family.[4] The Risinga Community (under headman Chabalala) originally came from the Elim district, next to the township of Waterval.\n\nThe Old Parliament Buildings in Giyani, the ministerial houses, and the Palace of the Chief Minister of Gazankulu were built on what used to be the Chief's Kraal and headquarters of the Risinga Community. Across the main road, the Risinga Community used to drive their herds of cattle for grazing at a place known today as Giyani Golf Course. Giyani Section E, Section A, Sections D1 and D2, and the CBD of Giyani, known as Bendstore, were villages of the Risinga Community. The Risinga Community was forcefully removed from their land during the 1960s[5] in order to make way for the new capital of Gazankulu, and they were relocated to the foothills of Man'ombe Mountain in Homu Block 14 and Makoxa Village with their chief, Hosi Homu Chabalala.[5]\n\nLand claims\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Risinga Community, under Hosi Homu Chabalala, successfully claimed back their land, which includes Giyani Section E, Section A, Sections D1 and D2, and some parts of Section F. The whole of Man'ombe Mountain Nature Reserve and the entire Giyani CBD were given back to Hosi Homu Chabalala under the settlements scheme with the government. While the other Chabalala headman, Hosi Siyandhanim, successfully claimed some parts of Giyani Section E and Section F and the western portion of Giyani CBD, Mapuve, Jim Nghalalume, and Siyandhani as host villages,\n\nHosi Maswanganyi (Mavhusa) also successfully claimed back their land, which includes: Gandlanani, Basani, N'wamankena, Dingamadzi, Sikhunyani, Kremetart, Dzingidzingi A, B, and C, Bode A and B, Mencisi, and Maswanganyi Village. Hosi Khakhala also successfully claimed back their land, which includes: Muyexe Block 01, Mninginisi Block 02, Mninginisi Block 03, N'wadzekudzeku Block 04, Shivulani Block 05A, Mbatlo Block 05B, Mavalani Block 06, Thomo Block 07, Khakhala Block 08A, Mhlava Block 08B, and Gawula Block 09 Village.\n\nCulture\n\n[edit]\n\nMost residents of Giyani speak Xitsonga[6] as their first language. The Tsonga women perform the xibelani dance[7]'and called the dance Xigaza, while the men enjoy mpuluto and makhwaya. The Tsonga people also engage in a custom dance called mchongolo. Xibelani is an African skirt designed to make the wearer's hips look bigger so that the hip movement during the xibelani dance can be more apparent. The Tsonga people have their own distinct music when the xibelani dance is performed.\n\nThe staple diet in Giyani is maize porridge (vuswa or pap in Afrikaans) and rice, often eaten with meat, chicken, and vegetables (matsavu).\n\n\"Giyani\" is one of the tracks on the album Third World Child by Johnny Clegg and his band Savuka, written about leaving the stress of Johannesburg to get some peace and quiet in Giyani.[8]\n\nClimate\n\n[edit]\n\nGiyani is situated within the sub-tropical zone.[9] It can be very hot in the summer, reaching a maximum temperature of 41 °C in the summer and 25 °C during the winter. Winters are mild during the day and cold during the night.\n\nThe rainy season is between September and March, while the winter season is from April to August.[10]\n\nEconomy\n\n[edit]\n\nGiyani's economy is predominately rural-based. Cattle ranching and the production of maize, peanuts, tomatoes, potatoes, mangoes, and bananas form the backbone of agriculture.[11] With the economic boom, Giyani has now become a major retail and entertainment center for the local population. Modern shopping centers, with all the well-known chain stores presented, have vastly uplifted the local trade.[12]\n\nResidential areas\n\n[edit]\n\nResidential areas in the area surrounding Giyani CBD include Giyani Sections A, E, and F, D1, D2, and Kremetart [1].\n\nTwo more residential areas, Risinga View and Church View, aka Homu Block 15, have recently been established. These two fall under local traditional leaders.\n\nOther communities under Traditional Leaders (Tihosi) include Siyandhani, Dzingi-dzingi, Ka-Ndhambi, Mageva, Bambeni, Daniel (Makhwivirini), Maphata, Munghonghoma, Ngove, Khaxani, Mphagani, Xitlakati, Mayephu, N'wa-Marhanga, Xamfana, Nkomo A, Kheyi, Loloka, Maswanganyi, Mbhedle, Mushiane, Mayephu, Dzumeri Township, Hluvukani, Khaxani(Mhintlwa), Makhuva, Xawela Bloc 23, Xikhumba, Mbawula, Phalaubeni, Hlomela, Ndindani, Vuhehli, Nkomo B, Nkomo C, N'wa-Khuwani, Bambeni, Mzilela, Matsotsosela, Dzumeri RDP, Homu, Sikhunyani, Mninginisi, Xikukwani,Mavalani, Nkurhi, Tomu, Basani.\n\nEducation\n\n[edit]\n\nSome of the independent schools in Giyani include Khanyisa Education Centre,[13] Risinga Secondary School, Nkwangulatilo Education Centre,[14] Nyukani Education Centre, High Quality Education Centres, Giyani College of Technology and Management, and Muhluri Combine School. Public schools include Kheto Nxumayo Agricultural High School and Giyani High School.\n\nTertiary Institutions in or near Giyani\n\n[edit]\n\nNorthern Technical College\n\nStanford Business and Computer College\n\nHappy Tots Creche\n\nNew Era College\n\nHarvest Bible College\n\nMadzahisi College\n\nAvuxeni Computer Academy[15]\n\nGiyani Campus Of Nursing College\n\nLimpopo Province College of Nursing\n\nLetaba FET College (Giyani Campus)\n\nGiyani Education Multipurpose Centre\n\nTshwane University of Technology (Giyani Campus)\n\nGiyani college\n\nGiyani College of Technology and Management\n\nGiyani College of Education and Training\n\nRoads\n\n[edit]\n\nThe R81 is the major road that runs through Giyani. It links Giyani to Polokwane and Malamulele and joins the R524 to Punda Maria entrance gate of the Kruger National Park. The R81[16] joins the N1 to Pretoria and Johannesburg in Polokwane, next to the Mall of the North.\n\nSports\n\n[edit]\n\nGiyani Stadium[17] was the home of National First Division club Dynamos F.C. (South Africa) Giyani has been home to Giyani United and Giyani Classic.\n\nOn the athletics front the 100 metre sprint ace Peter \"Manero\" Ngobeni stayed in Giyani Section A during the 1980s.\n\nFiFA Referee late Herman Mashava was from Dzumeri, Mageva Village.\n\nNotable People\n\n[edit]\n\nPhillemon Hlungwani[18]\n\nPenny Penny\n\nMusa Keys\n\nGladwin Shitolo\n\nTinyiko Victor Hlungwani[19]\n\nFulani Shibulana[20]\n\nTourism\n\n[edit]\n\nGiyani's location is in the warm African bushveld, which makes it attractive for both local and international visitors. The Giyani Golf Course is home to zebras, giraffes, bushbucks, and some other herbivores; however, the viewing of these animals has not yet been commercialized.\n\nAt the moment, there are a number of bed and breakfast and guest house facilities for tourists. A few are: Hanyani Lodge, Riverside Guest House, Xisaka Bed and Breakfast, Tihosi Guest House, Elridge Mountain Lodge, Rosanna Guest House, Nwayitelo Lodge, and Mopani Guest House.\n\nLimpopo Lodge (formerly Giyani Hotel) is situated in the center of town and managed by the Oasis Group. Man'ombe Nature Reserve is located 6 km east of Giyani.\n\nGiyani also borders Kruger National Park on the western side of the Northern Region. Historically, Giyani had no entry point to Kruger National Park, even though Giyani shares a long border with Kruger National Park. There was a plan to open a new gate, known as Shangoni Gate, at Muyexe Village, 30 km north-east of Giyani town. This gate was supposed to bring much-needed development to the nearby villages of Muyexe, Mahonisi, and Mtititi, where unemployment is 80%.[21] These villages have been historically poor, despite the fact that they border one of the world's best safari destinations."
