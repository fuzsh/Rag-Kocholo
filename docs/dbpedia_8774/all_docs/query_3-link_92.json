The Giyani Goldfield includes the NW domain of the &gt;3.0 Ga Giyani greenstone belt (GGB) at the northern edge of the Kaapvaal Craton and the southern retrograde hydrated domain of the juxtaposed Southern Marginal Zone (SMZ) of the ca. 2.72 Ga Limpopo Complex (LC). Mineralization at all gold mines and gold prospects of the Giyani Goldfield is structurally controlled and closely associated with the Hout River shear zone (HRSZ) and associated smaller shear zones suggesting a specific tectonic setting. This tectonic setting is the direct consequence of thrusting the SMZ of the LC against and over the adjacent GGB at the position of the steeply north-dipping (south verging) HRSZ during the exhumation stage of the ca. 2.72 to 2.69 Ga Limpopo orogeny followed by regional retrograde hydration of the southern part of the SMZ at ca. 2.68 to 2.62 Ga. This tectonic setting offers an explanation for a deep-seated crustal source for gold and for the concentration of orogenic gold mineralization within specific structural features located within the Giyani Goldfield. This tectonic setting also explains the lithological, structural and metamorphic complexity, metasomatic alteration and post-peak metamorphic timing of gold mineralization. Finally, it provides important clues with regards to a crustal source for gold mineralizing fluids and the identification of new potential targets for gold exploration in the Giyani Goldfield.\n\nPotterton, Joanne. \"Cerebral palsy in Giyani.\" South African Journal of Physiotherapy 52, no. 3 (August 31, 1996): 66–68. http://dx.doi.org/10.4102/sajp.v52i3.629.\n\nFull text\n\nAbstract:\n\nThis study sets out to establish the epidemiology of cerebral palsy in the drought stricken Giyani district in the Northern Province. Seventy-nine children with cerebral palsy were assessed at Nkhensani hospital. The cause and type of cerebral palsy were established as well as the main concerns of the parents. Thirty-two percent of cerebral palsy was found to be due to postnatal causes, which may be attributed to the prevalence of meningitis and gastroenteritis. Only sixteen percent of the children had diplegia, which is in keeping with findings in other third world countries. Major concerns expressed by the parents included issues of education and institutionalisation as facilities for children with disabilities in this area are inadequate. An obvious need exists to impart neuro-developmental skills to therapy assistants and to parents who play the biggest role in managing children with cerebral palsy in the Northern Province.\n\nMhlongo, Sphiwe Emmanuel, and George Oluwole Akintola. \"Artisanal and small-scale mining activities as post-mining land use in abandoned mine sites: a case of Giyani and Musina areas, Limpopo Province of South Africa.\" Journal of Degraded and Mining Lands Management 8, no. 3 (April 1, 2021): 2815–27. http://dx.doi.org/10.15243/jdmlm.2021.083.2815.\n\nFull text\n\nAbstract:\n\nSouth Africa has many artisanal and small-scale mining (ASM) activities that some are registered and others informal and illegal. This paper presents an overview of ASM operations in the vicinity of abandoned mine sites found in Giyani and Musina areas, Limpopo Provine of South Africa. It looks at the mining processes, environmental problems, and health and safety risks of ASM in the area. It also provideds a discussion of practical ways of dealing with the problems of artisanal and small-scale mining operations in a harmonized way with the rehabilitation of the abandoned mine sites. The exploitation of waste rock dumps for aggregate production in Musina demonstrated that formalized ASM activities can be the best alternative uses of the abandoned mine sites. However, artisanal gold mining around Giyani revealed the health and safety risks and environmental problems of these operations. The artisanal gold mining activities worsened the health and safety and the environmental problems of the abandoned mine sites. Therefore, this paper recommends that the efforts of coming up with strategies to formalize and regulate artisanal mining in South Africa be deepened for these activities to be accepteble as sustainable as post-mining land-uses in abandoned mines.\n\nKhumalo, Teclah P., Hettie C.

This study was aimed at determining the factors that contribute to the success or failure of small businesses operating under jurisdiction of Greater Giyani Municipality. Data were collected via a focus group, which consisted of eight business owners. The findings revealed that business owners experience challenges, for instance, no entrepreneurial support is accessible to them and they struggle to get start-up capital for their businesses and as a result end up sourcing funds from micro-lenders. Most business owners have poor business skills, but they do not receive any training to enhance their capabilities, hence the likelihood of some businesses failing. Businesses are not being afforded the support they require. This could compromise the intentions of the government to encourage people to start businesses and thus improve their livelihood and the wellbeing of society. For these businesses to sustain their operations, it is important that they be provided with support, particularly in the form of start-up capital and business skills. Regarding future research, a study should be carried out on a large scale in order to allow for generalisability of these findings to the entire Limpopo province.\n\nMudzielwana, Rabelani, Mugera Wilson Gitari, Segun Ajayi Akinyemi, Abel O.

Not only because of global weather change and the occurrence of more erratic weather events, but also due to competition for fresh water between the agricultural, industrial and domestic sectors (Hamdy et al., 2003). Food production increases in smallholder agriculture is seen as a possible solution to the food security challenges in the rural areas of the Limpopo Province (Altman et al., 2009). Smallholder farmers in Giyani mostly use traditional furrow irrigation systems and their farm crop productivity remains very low, compared to commercial farms in the same area. The objective of this study is to utilize and test various innovation technologies aimed at increasing Water Productivity (WP) in order to facilitate better irrigation management of the available water resources. The study was conducted on two farms, Zava Cooperative Garden and Mzilela Cooperative Garden, in the rural areas of Giyani over a two year period from 2012-2013. This study seeks to achieve the objective in three distinct ways. Firstly, the use of NIR technology is used to evaluate the prediction ability of soil chemical parameters for fertilizer requirement calculations. Secondly, WP trials were conducted on smallholder tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) production for three consecutive seasons, evaluating their current tomato crop production systems and also testing new innovations for WP increases. Thirdly, applying the MonQI methodology, inputs and outputs of all crop production sites were done to monitor the cropping systems throughout the period of the research. The results from this study indicate the importance of applying new innovations amongst smallholder production systems. Important findings from the NIR technologies indicated that this innovation can improve soil nutrient management in a more affordable, user friendly manner. The results showed that good prediction models were obtained for pH (KCl), electrical conductivity (EC), P, K, Mg, Na and CEC, with R2 and RPD values larger than 0.60 and 1.4 respectively. The prediction of exchangeable Ca was less successful with a R2 value of 0.43. Results from the WP trials suggest that drip irrigation performed better than furrow irrigation in terms of yield and WP. Yield and WP were very low for all treatments, being below 32 t/ha and 5.2 kg/m-3 respectively. Improved management practices, such as soil nutrient management and mulching were introduced in the 2nd and 3rd seasons of tomato trials in order to increase WP at field level at Mzilela farm. Results showed tomato yield increased from an average of 26.5 t/ha to 120.9 t/ha and WP increases from 4.61kg/m-3 to 17.69 kg/m-3. Deep drainage of water out of the rootzone decreased with better irrigation management. The results from the monitoring of inputs and output of their cropping systems revealed that smallholder farmers, using traditional farming practices, yielded very low and mostly below 5 t/ha for all crops. Some crops were totally lost due to hail and heat-waves. NPK balances for conventional cropping by the smallholder farmers at Mzilela was in the range of 0 to -70 kg/ha. The tomato production fertilized treatment of the 1st, 2nd and 3rd WP trials, showed positive nutrient balance results for P and K in the range of 80 to 140 kg/ha. N balances were mostly negative for all plots. NFI was R2768 and R4740 for season 1 and 3 respectively, while the 2nd season results showed a loss of - R5176. With the improved yield from the WP trial sites, and the fruits being sold to the Spar, the NFI increased to R42486 in the final season. The study concludes that great improvements in yield, WP and NFI are attainable and sustainable amongst smallholder farmers in the Giyani area.\n\nAFRIKAANSE OPSOMMING: Die beskikbaarheid van water hulpbronne vir besproeiings doeleindes onder kleinskaalse boere in die voormalige tuislande is besig om ernstige bekommernisse te wek. Nie net as gevolg van globale weer veranderinge en meer gereelde ekstreme weer toestande nie, maar ook as gevolg van die kompetisie tussen die landbou, industriële en huishoudelike sektore vir water gebruike (Hamdy et al., 2003). Verhoogde voedsel produksie onder die kleinskaalse landbou sektor word gesien as moontlike oplossing vir die voedsel sekuriteit uitdagings in die platteland areas van die Limpopo Provinsie in Suid-Afrika (Altman et al., 2009). Kleinskaalse boere in Giyani gebruik meestal tradisionele voor-besproeiings stelsels en hul produktiwiteit bly steeds baie laag wanneer dit met kommersiële boerderye vergelyk word. Die hoofdoel van hierdie studie is om Water Produktiwiteit (WP) te bestudeer en verskeie innovasie tegnologieë te toets om beter besproeiing bestuur van kosbare water bronne te fasiliteer. Die studie was uitgevoer op twee plase, naamlik Zava Koöperatiewe Tuin en Mzilela Koöperatiewe Tuin, wat in die plattelandse areas van Giyani geleë is en die studie is gedoen oor ‘n periode van twee jaar vanaf 2012 tot 2013. Om hierdie doelwit te bereik was die navorsing in drie eenhede uitgevoer. Eerstens sal Naby-Infra Rooi (NIR) tegnologie gebruik word om die voorspelling vermoë van grond chemiese eienskappe te toets vir meer effektiewe grond voedingstof bestuur deur kleinboere. Tweedens sal WP proewe uitgevoer word op kleinskaalse tamatie (Solanum lycopersicum) produksie. Die huidige tamatie gewasproduksie stelsels was getoets om die WP statusse te evalueer van hul tradisionele bestuurs praktyke van beide drip- en voorbesproeiings stelsels. Laastens, is insette en uitsette van die kleinboere se produksie stelsels met die MonQI metodologie bestudeer om die huidige produksie sisteme te evalueer, sowel as die WP proef persele, deur opbrengs, grond voedingstof balanse en netto plaas inkomste (NPI) te moniteer en te bereken vir 4 half jaar seisoene gedurende die navorsings periode. Die resultate van die navorsing voer aan dat die gebruik van innovasie tegnologieë onder kleinskaalse boerderystelsels ontsettend belangrik is vir verbeterde produksie. Hoofbevindings van die NIR tegnologie dui dat meer doeltreffende grond voedingstof bestuur moontlik is en wat goedkoper en meer gebruikersvriendelik is vir kleinboere. Hierdie tegniek het goeie voorspelbaarheid-modelle getoon vir pH (KCl), Elektriese Geleiding (EG), P, K, Mg, Na en katioon uitruilings kapasiteit (KUK) met R2 en RPD waardes hoër as 0.60 en 1.4 onderskeidelik. Die voorspelbaarheid van Ca was minder suksesvol met ‘n R2 waarde van 0.43. Die resultate van die WP toetse wys dat drip besproeiing beter as voorbesproeiing presteer het in terme van opbrengs en WP. Opbrengs en WP was baie laag vir alle behandelings van seisoen 1, met waardes laer as 32 t/ha en 5.2 kg/m-3 onderskeidelik. Verbeterde bestuurspraktyke, soos grond voedingstof bestuur asook die gebruik van ‘n deklaag, was in die 2de en 3rde seisoen toegepas om opbrengs en WP te verhoog op plaasskaal op Mziela plaas. Resultate het gewys dat opbrengs verhoog het van ‘n gemiddelde van 26.5 t/ha tot 120.9 t/ha en WP verhoging van 4.61 kg/m-3 tot 17.69 kg/m-3. In terme van die insette en uitsette van die produksie sisteme het opbrengste van alle gewasse, wat nog van tradisionele metodes gebruik, laer as 5 t/ha getoon. Soms van die totale oeste verloor deur hael of hittegolwe. Die NPK balanse vir die gewasverbouing met konvensionele kleinboer metodes was in die orde van 0 tot -70 kg/ha. Die kunsmis behandelings van die tamatie proewe van die 1ste, 2de en 3rde WP seisoene het positiewe balanse getoon vir P en K in die orde van 80 tot 140 kg/ha. Die N balanse was meestal negatief vir alle verbouings persele. Die NPI was R2768 en R4740 vir seisoen 1 en 3 onderskeidelik, terwyl die 2de seisoen verlies van -R5176 getoon het. Die verbeteringe in opbrengs met die WP proewe en met die verkoop van die tamaties aan die Spar was die NPI vir die 4de seisoen R42486. Die studie sluit dat daar groot moontlikehede is vir verhoging in opbrengs, WP en NPI onder kleinboere in die Giyani area.\n\nZitha, Nkosinathi. \"Effects of violent films and video games on children selected villages in Giyani Municipality, Limpopo Province.\" Thesis, University of Limpopo, 2014. http://hdl.handle.net/10386/2581.\n\nFull text\n\nAbstract:\n\nTheses (M.A.(Media Studies)) --University of Limpopo, 2014\n\nThe purpose of this study was to outline the effects of violent films and video games on children in Giyani. The study used both qualitative and quantitative methods. Data collection was done using three methods, namely: structured questionnaires, interviews and observations. Participants for this study were sixty (60) children from four selected villages, namely Ndhambhi, Mageva , Bambeni and nwamarhanga. Twenty (20) parents from the same villages were also selected. Films and video games remain the source of entertainment for media consumers although they have effects. Such effects may be seen through long and short time exposures. There are positive and negative effects of media violence exposure. The effectiveness of effects on children may be determined by several factors such as: cognitive development of one’s mind, time spent consuming violent films and video games, age and interpretation attached to messages portrayed by the media. The findings reveal that children’s perceptions of the reality may be affected by media violence. Furthermore, parents do not always monitor what their children consume on daily basis. Repeated exposure of violence on children might result in aggressiveness and the syndrome world effects. Children should be taught about the importance of age restrictions and television guidelines.\n\nManganyi, Ntsamatiko Josephina. \"Evaluation of Challenge Programme Water for Food techniques / technologies on smallholder dryland farming in Greater Giyani Municipality in Limpopo Province.\" Thesis, University of Limpopo (Turfloop Campus), 2011. http://hdl.handle.net/10386/643.\n\nFull text\n\nAbstract:\n\nThesis (M.Dev.) --University of Limpopo, 2011\n\nFood security in most drought-stricken areas of Limpopo Province is a challenge to the Department of Agriculture and to all the people living in the province, especially to the resource poor smallholder farmers. Finding remedial solutions to agricultural production in stress prone conditions is therefore a high priority. The introduction of Challenge Programme Water for Food (CPWF) technologies/techniques to smallholder dry land farming in Greater Giyani Municipality was seen as one of the solutions. However, there are constraints raised by CPWF technology adopters such as shortage of labour, lack of ploughing equipment, lack of credit, shortage of land and marketing. CPWF technologies are suitable for smallholder dry land farming, especially rainwater harvesting technologies. Smallholder farmers need to be remobilised and trained on the potential benefits of CPWF technologies to enhance their adoption and spread to other areas.\n\nChekero, Tamuka. \"Suffering and surviving beyond home borders: experiences of Zimbabwean migrant women in accessing health care services in Giyani, South Africa.\" Master's thesis, University of Cape Town, 2018. http://hdl.handle.net/11427/29185.\n\nFull text\n\nAbstract:\n\nThis dissertation explores documented and undocumented Zimbabwean migrant women's experiences in accessing public health services in South Africa. It unpacks migrant women's vulnerability and subsequent coping strategies they improvise against the shocks and stresses they face. Data in this study was collected over two and a half months using qualitative anthropological techniques. I used key informant interviews, unstructured interviews, life-histories and focus group discussions. The data was analysed using Chabal's (2009) model of ‗suffering and surviving'. Findings in this study reveal that Zimbabwean migrant women in South Africa are excluded from accessing public health services, despite them being accommodated in policy frameworks and the South African Constitution. The excluded women improvise various strategies in accessing health services. In coping with exclusion, they use strategies such as marriage, social capital, local institutions and indigenous knowledge. These strategies act as safety nets in times of health shocks and stresses for both women and their unborn and born children. In terms of indigenous knowledge, women depend on traditional medicines from traditional midwives. In some cases they consult spiritual healers as a strategy of anticipating danger and coping with various health ailments. Vulnerable women also utilise their linking capital and receive assistance from local institutions such as NGOs. On the horizontal level, they invest in bonding capital as a coping strategy to deal with health challenges. Furthermore, excluded women's horizontal relationships in civic informal institutions, such as money rotating clubs and burial societies, reduce their vulnerability to exclusion and help them fortify their resilience.\n\nBila, Tsakani Ephraim. \"An investigation into the impact of implementation of the Rural Development Strategy in Muyexe Village in the Greater Giyani, Limpopo Province.\" Thesis, University of Limpopo (Turfloop Campus), 2013. http://hdl.handle.net/10386/1053.\n\nFull text\n\nAbstract:\n\nThesis (M.Dev.) --University of Limpopo, 2013\n\nThe study was conducted to examine the impact of the implementation of the comprehensive rural development programme, President Zuma referred to it as the integrated rural develooment in is presidential inaugural speech in 2009. The researcher went to Muyexe village to conduct the research as well as to observe what took place. The researcher interviewed community members as well as community leadership who indicated how the community has been transformed to what it was, which they described a squalor living condition to what it is today, a community that meets the most basic needs required for sustainable livelihood. The people of Muyexe owe their changed fortunes to the government’s Comprehensive Rural Development Programme developed and coordinated by the Department of Rural Development and Land Reform. Sector departments and other development agencies were mobilised to work together towards a common goal to improve the lives of rural people. The intervention brought numerous changes to the community of Muyexe village. The lives of the community has been improved, through the intervention the community now have access to health care, early child hood development centre, community multi community centre, and so forth. The community spoke fondly of the reduction in crime and the killings of their cattle by wild animals; the reduction is caused by the establishment of the police station and the fencing around of the village. Despite what had been achieved by the intervention, Government should regard what happened as an initial intervention to focus on meeting people’s basic needs, especially food security. The next step should be the entrepreneurial stage and large scale infrastructure development.\n\nConference of National Librarians of Southern Africa.
