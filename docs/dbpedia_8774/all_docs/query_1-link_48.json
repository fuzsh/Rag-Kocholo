Over the partition line is a narrow white upright chevron 1/20th the width of the flag. There is a plume of three ostrich feathers bound in the upper hoist, in the upper fly a torch and beneath the chevron a paschal lamb, all in white, the lamb bearing a swallow-tailed pennant of St. George. This flag is a heraldic banner of the Coat-of-Arms registered by the Bureau of Heraldry for the Fish Hoek High Schools, under certificate number 2262 dated 07 December 1990 (Source: SAVA Newsletter, 2/91, 15 November 1991).\n\nAndre van de Loo, 27 Mar 2011\n\nGazankulu College of Nursing\n\nimage by Andre van de Loo, 27 Mar 2011\n\nThe flag of the Gazankulu College of Nursing (located in the former Gazankulu Homeland in what is now Limpopo Province) is in the proportion of 2:3, is divided per upright chevron, blue and white. The blue is charged centrally with two spoons in saltire, handles upwards and joined by a chain, embowed, all in gold. On the white appears a double-handled candlestick and candle, both in blue, with the candle enflamed in red. This flag is a heraldic banner of the Coat-of-Arms registered by the Bureau of Heraldry for the Gazankulu College of Nursing under certificate number 2088 dated 09 August 1989.\n\nThe spoons joined by a chain, which are also found on the former Homeland flag of Gazankulu, are used by the Shangaan people during tribal ceremonies. Being carved out of a single block of wood, the spoons cannot be separated and harmony must prevail between the two people wishing to eat with them. Their appearance is a signal that disputes must be settled and / or that hospitality must be offered to strangers. The candle, much used in the rural areas of South Africa, is in lieu of the traditional nurses' lamp (Source: SAVA Newsletter, 2/91, 15 November 1991).\n\nAndre van de Loo, 27 Mar 2011\n\nPlettenberg Bay Primary School\n\nimage by Randy Young, 01 Dec 2014\n\nLocated in Plettenberg Bay (Western Cape) Plettenberg Bay Primary School serves students up through Grade 7, teaching in both English and Afrikaans, according to the school's website.\n\nThe school's flag is a blue-white-blue triband with the school's coat of arms centered on the white band. The coat of arms' blue shield is divided horizontally by a white wavy line. Above the wavy line are a jumping dolphin and a whale blowing water from its blowhole, both animals depicted as white silhouettes. Below the wavy line is a sand dollar displayed as a white silhouette. In what would be the chief of the shield there is a white banner with blue letters spelling out (in English and Afrikaans) PLETTENBERG BAY � BAAI.\" Below the shield is a blue banner with white letters spelling out the school's motto in both English and Afrikaans \"AIM HIGH � MIK HOOG.\"\n\nRandy Young, 01 Dec 2014\n\nRhodes University\n\nimage by Martin Grieve, 29 Mar 2005\n\nRhodes University is located in Grahamstown in the Eastern Cape province of South Africa. The University was established on 31 May 1904 as the Rhodes University College, named for Cecil John Rhodes, diamond and gold magnate, imperialist, sometime Prime Minister of the Cape Colony and founder of the British South Africa Company which colonised Rhodesia (today Zimbabwe and Zambia). Donations towards its founding came largely from the trustees of Rhodes's estate (he had died in 1902) and De Beers Consolidated Mines (which he had founded), as well as several public bodies in what was then called the Eastern Province.\n\nOn 10 March 1951 Rhodes became an independent university, to which the University of Fort Hare founded in 1916 in the near-by town of Alice) was affiliated until 1959. Under the apartheid dispensation Fort Hare originally accepted Black students only while Rhodes catered for white students.\n\nIn the 1960s Rhodes University established a branch in Port Elizabeth, but government intervention saw its campus there being taken over by the new University of Port Elizabeth which in January 2005 became known as the Nelson Mandela Metropolitan University.\n\nIn the 1980s Rhodes University established a branch in East London which became a flourishing campus, but again further government intervention resulted in this campus becoming part of the University of Fort Hare in 2003.\n\nThe flag of Rhodes University is based on its Arms which were granted by the London College of Arms in 1913. The blazon (as recorded on the Deed of Grant) reads:\n\n\"Or on a Pile Sable an Open Book inscribed with the words \"Sapientam Exquiret Sapiens\" between three Escallops of the first. On a Chief Argent a Lion passant gules between two Thistles slipped and leaved proper. And for the crest a Wreath of the Colours upon a Rock the Figure of a Man mounted on a Horse representing 'energy' all Argent\".\n\nThe excessive use of capital letters and a paucity of punctuation is characteristic of blazons from the College of Arms. It is also characteristic of the College to omit mention of the motto below the shield, which reads: Vis Virtus Veritas.\n\nThe symbolism of the Arms is as follows:\n\nBlack and gold are the livery colours of the Graham family. The pile (inverted triangle) is characteristic of the arms of Graham of Fintry, while the escallops (shells), an emblem of pilgrimage, appear not only in the arms of Fintry (a cadet branch of the family) but also Graham of Montrose (the clan chief). These Graham symbols signify the university's presence in Grahamstown.\n\nThe lion and two thistles were taken from the coat of arms granted posthumously to Cecil John Rhodes and were also found in the Arms of Rhodesia. The references to Cecil Rhodes arise out of his estate's role in establishing the university.\n\nThe open book is a common feature of the arms of a college or university; a famous example is Oxford University.\n\nThe crest is a representation of the famous statue by Watts which forms part of the Rhodes Memorial in Cape Town. The statue, also known as Physical Energy, was a favourite of Rhodes'.\n\nAn appalling aspect of the artwork produced by the herald painter, or artist attached to the College of Arms in London, is that the crest-wreath is drawn with the appearance of a tea-tray balanced on top of the helmet. The crest-wreath or torse was produced by twisting silk cloth in two or more colours and was placed around the bolts that held the crest to the helmet, so as to conceal them, and so formed the base of the crest. It must be added that the standard of artwork produced through the College has improved considerably through the 20th century, and is now an exemplary blend of authentic medi�val and appropriate modern styles.\n\nFurther details of the University's Arms and its history can be found on Mike Oettle's SA heraldry website while the University's own website can be found here.\n\nBruce Berry, 29 Mar 2005\n\nOne of the Rhodes University Halls of Residence, the Allan Webb Hall and its four houses, have their own flags. They are shown here:\n\nhttp://www.allanwebb.ru.ac.za/en/coa.html.\n\nValentin Poposki, 28 Apr 2006\n\nNote that the site says that the flags \"would\" look like that. To me, that says that they don't actually exist; the page is actually about Coats of Arms and then shows how those might translate to a BoA.\n\nNatham Lamm, 28 Apr 2006\n\nRhodes University is my alma mater. I did my undergraduate degree there between 1981 and 1984 and was in Drostdy Hall. Each residence within Drostdy had a shield but no flags I'm afraid.\n\nI see from the RU wesbite that Oriel Hall also shows its heraldic shields at http://campus.ru.ac.za/index.php?action=category&category=335.\n\nBruce Berry, 28 Apr 2006\n\nSchool of Rail\n\nimage by Arthur Radburn, 04 Mar 2018\n\nThe School of Rail, formerly the Esselen Park Training College, is located in Kempton Park, and is the national railway training centre.\n\nThe nine blocks are derived from the college's coat of arms and represent the nine administrative regions into which the railways are organised. The two white stripes represented railway lines. The flag was registered at the Bureau of Heraldry on 24 April 1987 (Certificate 1847 dated 16 October 1987) with the following description : \"A rectangular flag, proportion three by two, consisting of five horizontal stripes from top to bottom, black, white, red, white and black, 1/5, 1/20, 1/2, 1/20 and 1/5 of the height of the flag respectively, the red charged in the hoist with nine white squares each 1/10 of the height of the flag, placed 3, 3 and 3, and arranged equidistantly from one another and from the white stripes.\"\n\nArthur Radburn, 04 Mar 2018\n\nUniversity of Pretoria\n\nOriginal image by Mike Oettle, 14 Feb 2002. Remade by Anto'nio Martins-Tuva'lkin, 20 June 2004\n\nThis is an illustration of the flag of Pretoria University, which as the name implies is located in Pretoria. The proportions of the colours appear to be two-thirds blue above and one-third red at the bottom.\n\nMike Oettle, 14 Feb 2002\n\nThe flag of the University of Pretoria was registered at the Bureau of Heraldry under certificate number 772 dated 24 October 1975 with the following description:\n\n\"A rectangular flag per fess abaisse Azure and Gules with the armorial shield of the University (namely: Per chevron Gules and Azure, a pall reversed between dexter three bees places 1 and 2, sinister three annulets placed 2 and 1 and in base an ox-wagon, Or), fimbriated Or, in the centre\".\n\nThe arms depicted on this flag were originally registered under (Bureau of Heraldry) certificate 23/1935:253 dated 23 October 1950 and are also depicted on certificate number 916 dated 28 April 1978 (Source: Some Southern African Flags, 1940-1991, FG Brownell, SAVA Journal 1/92, 01 April 1992).\n\nBruce Berry, 17 Feb 2002\n\nOriginal image sent by Mike Oettle, 14 Feb 2002 and remade by Anto'nio Martins-Tuva'lkin, 20 June 2004\n\nSonop Christian Residence (University of Pretoria)\n\nSonop (Afrikaans for sunrise) Christian Residence (Sonop Christelike Tehuis) is a private male residence at the University of Pretoria. It has \"A rectangular flag proportion 2:3, per chevron Gules and Azure, in chief a sun issuant and in base a descending dove, over all a pall inverted all Or\" which was registered at the Bureau of Heraldry on 26 October 2012 (Government Gazettes 35625 dated 31 August 2012 and 35808 dated 26 October 2012). The basic layout, i.e. the colours and the inverted pall, clearly come from the university's coat of arms.\n\nArthur Radburn, 07 April 2013\n\nUniversity of South Africa\n\nThe University of South Africa (Unisa) is a correspondence university located in Pretoria. It has a flag registered at the Bureau of Heraldry on 14 March 1986 with the following description:\n\n\"A rectangular flag proportion three by two, at the hoist a red vertical band embattled one third the length of the flag, the fly gold, in the hoist a white rose barbed green and seeded gold between two annulets in pale, also gold.\" The flag is derived from elements of the university's coat of arms, which was originally granted by King Edward VII in 1903, and later modified a few times.\n\nArthur Radburn, 07 April 2013\n\nUniversity of the North\n\nThe University of the North was established in 1959 under the apartheid regime's policy of separate ethnically based institutions of higher learning for black African students. The university is located at Turfloop, about 40km east of Pietersburg (now Polokwane). It had a flag registered at the Bureau of Heraldry on 30 December 1988 with the following description:\n\n\"A rectangular flag, proportion 3:2, consisting of a white fly charged with a baobab tree leaved proper on a green island, and a red hoist third wavy charged with a three-columned Doric portico and a laurel wreath in pale, both white.\" The design was derived from the university's coat of arms.\n\nThe university merged with the Medical University of South Africa to form the University of Limpopo on 01 January 2005.\n\nArthur Radburn, 07 April 2013\n\nWalter Sisulu University\n\nsent by Bruce Berry, from www.wsu.ac.za, 26 Jan 2006\n\nWalter Sisulu University, located in Mthatha (formerly Umtata) in the Eastern Cape province, is a new university named after one of the seminal leaders of the African National Congress. Details are given at www.wsu.ac.za/news/newflag.htm, which gives the following details:\n\nOn 1 July 2005, the new flag Walter Sisulu University (WSU) was raised in a quiet ceremony at the main campus in Mthatha, Eastern Cape, to mark the establishment of the new University.\n\nThe new flag is a radical change for the former merger partners. In addition to bearing the new University�s logo, the flag flies vertically in a break away from the traditional horizontal flag and is flown in a pair at each campus, bearing the logo against both black and white backgrounds.\n\nWSU was established through a merger between Border Technikon, Eastern Cape Technikon and the University of Transkei.\n\nsent by Bruce Berry,\n\nfrom www.wsu.ac.za, 26 Jan 2006\n\nThe new, comprehensive WSU corporate identity �look and feel�, approved on 09 Dcember 2004, allows for a degree of flexibility which is appropriate for a large university with a wide geographical spread. The simple and striking logo remains as the underpinning, constant factor communicating simply and boldly the message that a new university as arrived.\n\nThe following six principles form the foundation of the WSU corporate identity:\n\n1. The adoption of the black and white WSU logo with the three-dimensional grey outlining the letters. This will also be used in the reverse of white on black.\n\n2. The principle that the gazetted name of the institution will appear on official documents such as stationery, printed materials and wherever suitably applicable.\n\n3. The principle that a strap-line be applied to all printed materials such as advertisement templates, publications and wherever suitably applicable.\n\n4. The approval of the following wording for the introductory strapline: �A developmental university... technological, scientific, innovative, responsive�\n\n5. The principle of the use of colour to identity and personalize areas of operation. (The colour coding of faculties and areas of operation will be negotiated as part of the implementation process.)\n\n6. The principle that photographic imagery be employed to convey appropriate messages to appropriate target markets in advertisement templates and publications."
