        "text": "About Greater Giyani\n\nKnown as the 'land of the friendly people' and the 'place where the people dance', was officially established in 1969. It is the administrative and commercial centre of the Mopani district and also the former capital of Gazankulu.\n\nGiyani's Central Business District is a lively informal business sector which should not be missed. Traditional African Cuisine such as matomani (mopani worms), tihove (samp), muroho, teepe, leroto and vuswa (mealie meal) are on the menu all day long for visitors to experience.\n\nWe believe that our lives are meant for more than just routine 9-5, that our crushing resentment of habituation need not be the beginning and the end. We believe that travel is good for the soul as it rejuvenates, offers perspective, creates excitement and offers a chance to discover new meaning and purpose.\n\nWe are passionate travelers who have designed the ultimate single platform to rid the stress, complication and effort of travel planning.\n\nWe present an evolving digital space for you to gain inspiration, research, plan and book your next travel experience with ease and vigor. We are an online travel agency here to make your next travel experience better and better.\n\nWe love hearing from our visitors and your experience with Kizzler.\n\nPlease follow the link to our contact page to submit your query and we will respond as soon as we can.\n\nIf you have any queries, comments, compliments or complaints or even just want to get in touch; feel free to fill out the form below. We look forward hearing from you.\n\nContact"
