        "text": "Informations\n\nBiratnagar (Nepali: विराटनगर) is a metropolitan city in Nepal, which serves as the capital city of Province No. 1. With a population of 242,548 as per the 2011 census, it is the largest city in the province and also serves as the headquarters of Morang district. Biratnagar is located 399 km (248 mi) east of the capital, Kathmandu and 6 km (3.7 mi) north of the bordering town of Jogbani in the Indian state of Bihar. The highest peak in the world, Mount Everest, is located 174 km (108 mi) north of the city. Biratnagar was declared a metropolitan city on 22 May 2017, thus pushing the total population to over 240,000 making it the fourth most populated metropolitan city in the country after the urban agglomeration of Kathmandu and Lalitpur, Pokhara, and Bharatpur.\n\nThe city is home to the Biratnagar Jute Mills, the first large scale industry of Nepal. It also serves as an entry point to eastern Nepal as well as north-eastern India. Biratnagar is the second Nepalese city, after Janakpur, to have a connection with the Indian Railways and the only city after Birgunj to operate an integrated check post (ICP) on the Indian border. Considered to be the industrial capital of Nepal, the city is also the birthplace of five prime ministers of Nepal, in addition to being host to a number of revolutionary incidents in the country including the first labor strike which led to the anti-Rana movements."
