The squalid living conditions that prevail in most of the 10 black homelands and the repressive character of several of the Pretoria-backed homeland regimes are fueling black discontent and creating new recruits for the African National Congress (ANC), the principal South African insurgent group. Recent increases in the frequency and daring of terrorist incidents inside or near the homelands underscore their growing strategic value as staging areas and sanctuaries for the ANC. Although we believe these trends do not pose an immediate threat to the survival of the white government, they contribute to a further polarization between blacks and whites, and among whites, over the direction of South Africa's racial policies. Even the four homelands that have already been granted \"independence\" have, in reality, remained integral parts of South Africa. All 10 of the homelands depend on South Africa for budgetary support (Pretoria provides, on the average, about two-thirds of their funds), employment (more than four-fifths of their wage earners work outside the homelands), food (only one of the homelands?Bophuthatswana?produces enough to feed its population), transport access (most are surrounded by South Africa), and political contact with the rest of the world (South Africa is the only country recognizing them as independent states). Pretoria's influence is further bolstered through seconded white officials who occupy key positions in the local governments. The homelands' police and military forces also work closely with their South African counterparts. We believe that Pretoria, in pursuing its policy of separate development, has unwittingly strengthened the bridge that had long ,connected the country's rural and urban blacks through steady two-way migration. Forced resettlement of blacks into the homelands has created a broader and keener awareness among blacks of both backgrounds of their common plight. At the same time, the dearth of employment opportunities in the homelands has led to a steady stream of migration back to white areas, which continues despite forced removals and an economic recession in South Africa: The combination of resettlement and migration has forced many families that just a few years ago were primarily rural or urban to di- vide their activities between the city and the homeland. Thus, many black urbanites who formerly had little knowledge of or ties to the homelands now have relatives there.

These officials, viewed by much of the black populace as stooges of the South Africans, lavishly display their wealth while most of their people live in poverty. Some of the homeland leaders have blatantly manipulated the political process to stay in power. In our judgment, as blacks become increasingly disenchanted with these leaders, they will be more inclined toward militant action against them and their backers in Pretoria.

South Africa's present homelands policy is the outcome of more than three centuries of conflict between whites and indigenous black peoples. When Dutch settlers arrived at the Cape of Good Hope in the 1650s, they encountered the Khoisan peoples who had lived there for millennia. The first recorded black-white violence in the region occurred in 1659, when the settlers declared war on the Khoisan for stealing cattle. Quickly defeated, the Khoisan were pushed northward and were virtually eliminated by war, disease, and absorption into the gradually grow- ing Colored, that is, mixed race, population. Mean- while, white settlements spread eastward until they reached the territory of the Xhosa, near the present- day homeland of Ciskei. Beginning in 1779, and continuing for a century thereafter, blacks and whites battled for control of the rest of what is now South Africa. In the process, blacks were forced into small pockets of land that eventually became tribal reserves. By the 1880s, the Afrikaner descendants of the Dutch settlers had fully subjugated the blacks by force and turned to legal channels to consolidate their control. ? In 1894, the government limited black land inheri- tance to the eldest son. In 1913, the English-dominat- ed government restricted land ownership by blacks? who then numbered about 4.1 million?to only 7 percent of the country's area. (Indeed, the British victory in the 1899-1902 Boer War did not change the basic concepts of government policy toward the blacks.) By 1936, the growth of the black population to 6.6 million had prompted Pretoria to pass the Bantu Trust and Land Act that pledged a near doubling of these lands to an area about the size of Missouri. Progress in transferring the land was slow, however, and to this day?when the black population 1 has grown to nearly 22 million?black-owned land area has not reached the 1936 goal.' 25X1 25X1 25X1 Resettlement of Blacks. The Afrikaners, after their narrow political victory in 1948, added a new twist to the government's \"native policy.\" While retaining its restrictions on land ownership and movement, Pre- toria also began systematically to remove blacks from white areas. Central to this policy was the creation in the late 1950s of eight ethnic homelands?later ex- panded to 10?to which all blacks were assigned on the basis of language. Bent on solving its \"black problem,\" Pretoria since 1976 has granted \"indepen- dence\" to four homelands?Bophuthatswana, Ciskei, Transkei, and Venda?and has stripped their resident and assigned populations of South African citizen- ship. The remaining six homelands?Gazankulu, Kangwane, KwaNdebele, KwaZulu, Lebowa, and Qwaqwa?are officially \"self-governing states\" with- in South Africa. (See figure 1 foldout map on page 53.) 25X1 25X1 In mid-1982, South Africa added another new twist to its efforts to grant \"independence\" to the homelands when it announced plans to cede Kangwane and part of KwaZulu to neighboring Swaziland. In addition to transferring small impoverished regions and nearly 700,000 black citizens to an internationally recog- nized country, Pretoria hoped to gain some legitimacy for its homelands policy. Affected blacks have vehe- mently opposed the transfers, largely because they would lose their South African citizenship. In Novem- ber 1982, South Africa, after reaching an out-of-court settlement with Kangwane, announced its intention to ' The data in this report were drawn heavily from South African official sources. Their quality is relatively accurate on government expenditures, somewhat less reliable on population surveys, and unreliable on measuring unemployment. The South African Gov- ernment collects almost no statistics on social and other quality-of- life indicators. Moreover, Pretoria stops collecting data after a homeland becomes \"independent.\" Secret Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/01/19: CIA-RDP84500552R000100020002-6 25X1 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/01/19: CIA-RDP84500552R000100020002-6 Secret Figure 2.

(Withdrawn after widespread private and parliamentary opposition.

A commis- sion to investigate the question of the transfers will continue to exist, but it may be years before action is taken, if ever. The US Embassy?based on sketchy official South African data, press coverage, and conversations with South African officials?has reported the resettle- ment of 2.3 million blacks from white areas to today's homelands since 1948. The Black Sash, a white South African group opposed to apartheid puts the number at about 3 million. According to official South African reports, another 1 million blacks are scheduled for relocation during this decade; the Embassy puts the number at 2 million. US Embassy analysis of South African data indicates that resettlement has consisted of: ? Removal of farm tenants and squatters. Tenants and squatters on white farms have been prohibited since 1975. resulting in the resettlement of 1.3 3 million blacks. Blacks can now legally work on white farms only as contract laborers. ? \"Black spot\" removal. These are small areas in South Africa where blacks have legally held free- hold tenure under the Bantu Trust and Land Act of 1936. Between 1960 and 1979, nearly 350,000 blacks were moved to the homelands. Pretoria indi- cates there are still at least 75 \"black spots\"?some critics say 150?with an estimated population of 75,000 yet to be removed. 25X1 25X1 25X ? Homeland consolidation. During the 1970s, an esti- 25X1 mated 300,000 blacks were relocated when their land was exchanged for white-owned land in order to consolidate homelands into fewer parcels. ? Urban relocation. The South African Government has removed blacks from white cities and shifted homeland boundaries in order to include black townships in adjacent homelands. During the 1970s, about 175,000 people were uprooted or redistricted in this manner.

Housing in a rural area ? Strategic removals. Since 1960, some 150,000 to 200,000 blacks have been removed to make room for dams, highways, and military installations, and to create a South African \"buffer zone\" between Venda and Zimbabwe. In addition, regulations require that blacks have official authorization to live in white cities. Between 1967 and 1979, about 5.5 million blacks were investi- gated and/or tried for violations of these rules. The vast majority were forcibly removed to their designat- ed homeland, but many quickly returned to the cities. Recent US Embassy and press reports show that racial separation laws already on the books are being applied even more rigorously than in the past. Still more restrictive legislation may be passed in the future; during the 1982 parliamentary session, the government introduced a bill that called for a sub- stantial tightening of existing apartheid laws. For example, employers hiring illegal black migrants would be subject to a fine of nearly $4,500 per illegal worker, ten times the fine in the current,law. Wide- spread opposition to the bill?from whites and blacks alike?forced its withdrawal in October, but the government has announced plans to introduce another such bill next year Secret The Setting Grim Economic Picture. The fragile economies of the homelands are unable to support the 12 million people residing there, let alone the 10 million others assigned to these areas. Their resident populations are largely dependent on subsistence farming, on Pretoria's grants?which cover about two-thirds of most home- land budgets (although homeland leaders correctly note that these payments match the taxes that autho- rized black migrants from the homelands pay in White cities)?and on direct remittances from migrant work- ers. These workers are recruited through government labor bureaus to supply the needs of the mines and urban industrial and commercial firms in white South Africa. Even with the remittances from these workers, annual per capita income in the homelands barely averages $300, leaving the typical resident no better off than a person in the poorest countries in Africa Bophuthatswana is a notable exception to these stag- nant economies. Key advantages in this homeland include proximity to the Pretoria-Johannesburg indus- trial complex and a smattering of mineral deposits. Moreover, a popular, democratic government in Bo- phuthatswana has successfully encouraged foreign and domestic investment. The new entertainment complex at Sun City already has become a major employer. 4 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/01/19: CIA-RDP84500552R000100020002-6 2571 25X1 25X1 25X1 RI 25X11 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/01/19 : CIA-RDP84500552R000100020002-6 Secret Table 1 South African Homelands: Selected Economic Indicators Area (sq. km) Assigned Population, 1980 (thousand) Resident Population, 1980 (thousand) Workers in White Areas, 1980 (thousand) Job Entrants Employed in Local Modern Sector, 1980 (percent) Per Capita All-Source Income, mid-1970s (US$) Total 156,828 20,308 10,828 1,811 NA NA Bophuthatswana 38,000 2,435 1,329 339 33 250 Ciskei 5,530 1,354 630 84 37 190 Gazankulu 6,750 889 477 44 20 280 Kangwane 3,720 716 160 68 86 190 KwaNdebele 750 380 166 36 NA NA KwaZulu 31,000 5,421 3,178 701 25 220 Lebowa 22,476 2,501 1,658 197 40 220 Qwaqwa 482 1,793 155 38 34 210 Transkei 41,620 4,298 2,622 269 15 260 Venda 6,500 521 453 35 55 250 The homelands' agricultural and mineral base is even more meager than the 13-percent share of South Africa's territory allocated to these areas would sug- gest. About 15 percent of the land is arable?roughly the same as in the rest of South Africa?but this indicator is misleading. In most homelands soils are far more depleted than on white farms because of misuse stemming from the absence of modern farming techniques and overpopulation?the density is three times that of South Africa overall and four times that of Sub-Saharan Africa. Aside from those found in Bophuthatswana, mineral deposits have been found in commercial quantities only in Lebowa and KwaZulu. Efforts by Pretoria since the mid-1950s to attract industry to the homelands have failed. Those busi- nesses that have been set up are owned for the most part by whites or Asians who repatriate their profits to white South Africa. Despite liberal tax concessions, subsidized credits, and the absence of a minimum wage requirement, potential investors are deterred by inadequate facilities, high transport costs, and a lack of raw materials. Only about 2,500 jobs have been 5 created annually, far too few for the 100,000 jobseek- ers who join the labor force in the homelands each year. Most homeland residents are impoverished women, children, and old people resettled by Pretoria or left behind by the exodus of working-age males. Only 20 percent of South Africa's black wage earners work in the homelands. The remainder work in white areas; about 30 percent are daily commuters and 50 percent are migrants. Employment in the modern sector of the homelands ranges from a low of less than 15 percent of the work force in KwaZulu, within easy reach of Durban and other white cities, to a high of 55 percent in remote Venda, which has several labor-intensive tree and tea plantations. The rate at which unemployed youth return to the homelands is likely to increase over the next few years for various reasons. Economic recovery in South Africa will probably fall short of the 6 percent that Pretoria acknowledges is needed just to provide jobs Secret Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/01/19: CIA-RDP84500552R000100020002-6 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/01/19: CIA-RDP84500552R000100020002-6 R Next 1 Page(s) In Document Denied Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/01/19: CIA-RDP84500552R000100020002-6 25X1 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/01/19: CIA-RDP84500552R000100020002-6 Secret Figure 4 Black Population by Age and Sex, 1970 Percent Black Homelands Males Age E 80+ III E 75-79 E 70-74 7 I 65-69 I I 60-64 I I 55-59 I 50-54 45-149 40-44 35-39 30-34 25-29 20-24 12 10 15-19 10-14 5-9 0-4 0 0 Females 2 4 6 8 10 12 South Africa: Overall Males 12 10 588375 12-82 2 Age Females 80+ 75-79 70-74 65-69 60-64 III 55-59 50-54 11 45-49 40-44 35-39 30-34 25-29 20-24 15-19 10-14 5-9 0-4 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 Secret 8 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/01/19: CIA-RDP84500552R000100020002-6 25X1 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/01/19: CIA-RDP84500552R000100020002-6 Secret Figure 5 South Africa: Black Population Growth, 1970-80 Percent annual growth South Africa Nonhomeland South Africa \"Independent\" homelands Nonindependent homelands 0 1 2 3 4 5 588376 12-82 for new black entrants to the labor force. In addition, South Africa's urban residence laws are likely to be more strictly enforced. Based on patterns observed during the riots that occurred in Soweto and other black townships in 1976-77, we believe returning young people will be more politically active than other homeland residents have been in the past. Troubling Social Indicators. Soaiing population growth resulting from resettlement?the homelands' population rose by an extraordinarily high 4.3 percent annually during the 1970s?has compounded eco- nomic troubles and social distress. The upheaval of resettlement is producing widespread anomie and psychological depression, according to local health workers. Endemic diseases such as tuberculosis, more- over, afflict blacks inside and outside the homelands far more often than whites. Malnutrition?estimates by South African scholars put it at 50 percent for Ciskei children?contributes to a black infant mortal- ity rate that averages 25 percent in the homelands compared with 10 percent in South Africa as a whole. Comprehensive data on education in the homelands are unavailable, but reporting by the US Embassy in Pretoria indicates that educational opportunities in the homelands are far more limited than in white South Africa. Most teachers in the homelands have no 9 more than an eighth-grade education. For South Africa as a whole, government spending per white student is about 10 times higher than for blacks, even though this represents a significant narrowing of the gap in recent years. As a result, blacks remain far less likely than whites to finish high school. Among blacks themselves, the educational outlook for those living in white South Africa is brighter than for those in the homelands, who are excluded from new mandatory attendance requirements 25X1 Repressive Internal Politics. Most of the homeland leaders tend to be viewed by politically conscious South African blacks as instruments of Pretoria and symbols of the despised homelands policy. These leaders generally argue that they, as \"moderates\" with whom the South African Government is willing to deal, are the only alternative to the emergence of more radical leadership. Their ability to influence 25X1 Pretoria is limited, however, because they generally serve at its pleasure and lack a sizable political following.2 25X1 Disillusionment with the ability of homeland govern- ments to deal with their impoverished economies or to bring about changes in Pretoria's policies has resulted in waning public interest in electoral politics in the homelands. Voter participation has been decreasing; in the 1963 national elections, 68 percent of Trans- kei's voters cast ballots, but in \"independent\" Trans- kei's first election in 1976, only 43 percent went to the polls. More recently, in Bophuthatswana's general election in October 1982, fewer than 130 of the homeland's 250,000 assigned citizens living in Soweto bothered to vote, although three polling booths were set up in the township. Local opposition to their rule has turned some home- land leaders into petty dictators. Venda's unpopular, South African-appointed Chief Minister Patrick Mphephu, for example, has packed the homeland's legislature with loyal chiefs to ensure his control of 2 A notable exception is KwaZulu Chief Minister Gatsha Buthelezi, a popular Zulu chief and head of Inkatha, the largest black political organization in the country. Buthelezi frequently uses his official position?and the legal protection it affords him?to criticize Pretoria.

He has also detained or expelled several members of Venda's opposition party and other real and imagined political enemies. Several other home- land leaders have adopted Pretoria's hardline tactics, including detentions and bannings to strengthen their grip on power. Traditional chiefs and headmen around whom opposi- tion to the unpopular homelands regimes might co- alesce have generally found it too risky to oppose authorities who are prepared to use repression and who control the traditional leaders' own stipends and patronage. In addition, the opulent living of some of the traditional chiefs discourages popular support. The homelands thus show signs of becoming staging areas for a rural-based insurgency. Pretoria, in turn, can be expected to react sharply to prevent the homelands from becoming major ANC sanctuaries. We believe South African military and security forces would not hesitate to enter any homeland?\"indepen- dent\" or otherwise?in pursuit of suspected terrorists. In our view, moreover, Pretoria will use its substantial political and economic leverage on those homeland leaders who might be inclined to cooperate with the ANC. Fertile Ground for Insurgents The African National Congress until recently paid little attention to the homelands. During the 1970s, only 23 terrorist incidents?mainly such minor acts as the burning of small buildings?were recorded in the homelands. This reflects the ANC's emphasis on targeting economic installations, few of which are located in the homelands. Most of these incidents occurred in the last half of the decade and were concentrated in Bophuthatswana and KwaZulu. Both homelands are adjacent to foreign countries that harbor ANC personnel; they are also close to white urban centers in South Africa. The ANC is now giving closer attention to the homelands as it attempts to broaden its strength in South Africa. It is increasingly selecting economic targets within or just outside a homeland. Of the more than 40 major terrorist incidents that occurred in South Africa during 1981, over half took place either in or within 100 kilometers of a homeland, primarily Bophuthatswana and KwaZulu.

President Lucas Mangope charged at the time that he had been tricked into accepting independence without a satisfactory resolution of two issues: the citizenship of members of the Tswana tribe living in South Africa and the further consolidation of Bophuthatswana's seven widely scattered territorial units. These issues remain unresolved. Unlike the leaders of South Africa's other \"independent\" homelands, Mangope enjoys public support because of his vigorous and relatively successful efforts at promoting economic development and his strong record on human rights. Indeed, Bophuthatswana's constitution contains a Bill of Rights, while South Africa's does not. The ANC has a higher presence in Bophuthatswana than in the other homelands, but this primarily results from the homeland's location?adjacent to the ANC's sanctuaries in Botswana and close to white population centers inside South Africa. With a total land area of 38,000 square kilometers?roughly the combined size of Massachusetts, Connecticut, and Rhode Island?Bophuthatswana is the second- largest homeland after Transkei. It is also the most ethnically mixed of the homelands. About two-thirds of the population are Tswana. The largest minority tribes are the North Sotho (6 percent) and the Xhosa (5 percent); the Shangaan, South Ndebele, South Sotho, and Zulu tribes each account for about 3 percent of the population. The sizable non-Tswana population results from the influx of Africans into shantytowns along the homeland's border, only 25 kilometers outside Pretoria. Since 1972, the South African Government has reduced Bophuthatswana from 19 separate parcels of land to seven, primarily through the elimination of a dozen small black enclaves, or \"black spots,\" in white areas and the resettlement of their 120,000 black residents in other parts of the homeland. In 1979, an official South African report called for the consolidation of Bophuthatswana into one parcel. This would require the transfer of 1.3 million hectares of white-owned land to Bophuthatswana in exchange for the return to South African control of the homeland's two smallest parcels, totaling about 0.5 million hectares. According to the same report, the estimated total cost of buying out white farmers and relocating black and white residents would range between $1.2 billion and $3.6 billion. We believe that South Africa's economic downturn in recent years, together with opposition by white landowners who might be affected, has indefinitely sidetracked any moves toward consolidation. 11 Secret Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/01/19: CIA-RDP84500552R000100020002-6 25X1 25X1 25X1 25X1 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/01/19 : CIA-RDP84500552R000100020002-6 Secret Economic Activity Except for the South Sotho living in the Thaba `Nchu area, most of Bophutha- tswana's minorities live in the easternmost parcel, near Pretoria. Minority tribes that resent being governed by the Tswana majority are becoming increasingly critical of the Mangope government. Mangope recognizes the potential for unrest and has taken pains to respond to minority needs for housing and transportation. His responsiveness and Pretoria's public declarations that no new homelands will be created have muted calls by the minorities for separation from Bophutha- tswana. Bophuthatswana has the healthiest economy of all the homelands. Measured by availability of mineral resources, degree of industrial development, and per capita income?which jumped from $150 in 1970 to $410 in 1975 (the latest official data) and probably has grown steadily since then?Bophuthatswanans are considerably better off than residents of other homelands. At the same time, Bophuthatswana's economic health depends largely on external factors: ? Access to the nearby Pretoria-Johannesburg industrial complex. ? A high level of government aid from Pretoria. ? Substantial Western investment. Bophuthatswana also benefits from the presence of commercially exploitable mineral deposits and sound governmental management that has spent its revenue wisely. These broad economic factors are reflected within Bophuthatswana in high levels of activity in construction, manufacturing, mining, and agriculture. The Pretoria-Johannesburg industrial complex provides jobs for large numbers of daily commuters, whose earnings account for 45 percent of the homeland's wage income. Another one-third of the homeland's workers earn their livelihood locally. Thus, about 80 percent of the homeland's wage income is earned by residents and about 20 percent by migrants living in South Africa. Pretoria's grants have helped finance the construction of extensive new facilities? office buildings, a parliament, and vast housin! and shopping complexes?in Mafeking, the capital. Supported by foreign firms, Bophuthatswana currently exploits deposits of plati- num, chromite, vanadium, nickel, asbestos, granite, and manganese. In 1979, mineral extraction contributed 55 percent of the value of Bophuthatswana's cash economy but accounted for only 10 percent of its paid employment. The US Embassy in Pretoria estimates that total industrial investment in Bophuthatswana?mainly from West European sources?now amounts to $250 million. In addition, investments by Israeli and Taiwanese firms have recently been negotiated by the Bophuthatswana National Development Corporation Bophuthatswana's limited arable land-10 percent of the total?and the home- land's minimal agricultural development have led the local government to Secret 12 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/01/19: CIA-RDP84500552R000100020002-6 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/01/19: CIA-RDP84500552R000100020002-6 Secret Political Developments introduce large-scale, capital-intensive farms called temisano (or farm together). These farms, run by farmer cooperatives and provided with expensive irrigation and mechanical assistance, have been set up in semiarid areas near Pretoria. 25X1 The government has expressed the hope that high production on these farms will have a demonstration effect on subsistence farmers. It is too early to be certain whether small farmers have been helped, but in 1981 Bophuthatswana became self-sufficient in maize, stockpiling enough to carry it through this year's drought. Mangope's Bophuthatswana Democratic Party (BDP) won all 72 seats in the Legislative Assembly in the October 1982 election, Bophuthatswana's first such vote since \"independence.\" The election, in our view, demonstrated Mangope's willingness to govern on a democratic basis?unlike any other \"independent\" homeland leader. The election had one significant failing: of the approximately 250,000 Soweto residents who are \"extraterritorial\" citizens of Bophuthatswana, fewer than 130 bothered to vote, even though three polling booths were set up in the township. as a result of Pretoria's efforts this year to transfer the Kangwane homeland and a portion of the KwaZulu homeland to Swaziland, there is fresh interest among some Botswanan officials in absorbing Bophuthatswana and its mineral wealth. The idea of reuniting all of the Tswana people has been discussed among Botswanan officials since the 1960s. Mangope's constituents now fear that Pretoria will try to turn over part or all of Bophuthatswana to Botswana. Mangope is trying to strengthen ties with Pretoria to ward off this possibility. Bophuthatswana's security links with South Africa are close. Pretoria contributes a sizable share of the homeland's defense budget. Even more important, the South African military has acquired effective control over the Bophuthatswana Defense Force (BDF) through the stationing of South African officers on loan from Pretoria. 13 Secret Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/01/19: CIA-RDP84500552R000100020002-6 25X1 25X1 25X1 25X1 25X1 25X1 25X1 Sanitized Secret Leader Secret Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/01/19: CIA-RDP84500552R000100020002-6 US Embassy Lucas Manyane Mangope has been President of Bophuthatswana since \"indepen- dence\" in 1977. His political moderation and cooperation with South Africa have not prevented him from denouncing Pretoria's apartheid policies. Mangope also opposes confederation of the homelands with South Africa and Pretoria's plans to allow blacks living in white South African cities to elect representatives to the homeland assemblies. He has publicly vowed, however, not to let his homeland become a base for anti?South African activities. Mangope was born on 23 December 1923. After receiving a primary teacher's diploma from Bethel College in South Africa in 1951, Mangope taught high school. He was named a full-time chief of the Tswana tribe in 1959 and in 1972 became Chief Minister of Bophuthatswana, then a self-governing homeland. He visited the United States in 1971 on a grant from the privately-sponsored US? South African Leadership Exchange Program. 14 Copy Approved for Release 2011/01/19: CIA-RDP84500552R000100020002-6 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/01/19: CIA-RDP84500552R000100020002-6 7- Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/01/19: CIA-RDP84500552R000100020002-6 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/01/19: CIA-RDP84500552R000100020002-6 Secret Geographic and Demo- graphic Features CISKEI Ciskei, which became \"independent\" in December 1981, is believed by many South African observers to be the most politically unstable of the homelands. Long a dumping ground for unemployed, unhoused, or squatting members of the Xhosa tribe ousted from white areas of South Africa, Ciskei's population is suffering from rapid economic deterioration, rising unemployment, and severe malnutrition. these trends, and the Ciskei government's 25X1 reputation as the most corrupt and ruthless of the homeland regimes, have given rise to concern among senior South African officials that Ciskei could erupt into anarchy in the near future. 25X1 Ciskei's population in 1980 was about 630,000, with an additional estimated 725,000 Xhosa assigned to Ciskei but living in white South Africa. The homeland's resources are meager: soils are poor, rainfall is erratic, and minerals are few. Although many residents have left Ciskei, South Africa has forcibly sent an estimated 200,000 to 250,000 people there since 1960, according to US Embassy reporting. Two months before \"independence,\" for example, an estimated 4,000 to 5,000 Africans were removed from a township at the edge of the white town of Stutterheim, near the Ciskei border, and sent to the homeland. Although successive generations had lived in the township since 1851 on a freehold basis granted by the British, Pretoria simply negated their property rights. In addition, the Embassy reports that the South African Government plans to relocate 75,000 to 100,000 Xhosa from East London in Eastern Cape Province to Ciskei. Embassy reporting indicates that resettlement camps in Ciskei are seriously overcrowded and that living conditions in the camps are very poor. Ciskei is far more urbanized than the other homelands, in part because of its poor agricultural resources. Over half its residents live in cities and towns. Most of the urban dwellers live in Mdantsane, near East London, and Zwelitsha, on the edge of the South African city of King Williams Town. By 1990, the 23-kilometer Mdantsane-Zwelitsha corridor is expected by South African researchers to have a population of 700,000, compared with about 400,000 in 1980. Despite this relatively high rate of urbanization, Ciskei's rural population density is over three times that of rural white South Africa?a result of forced resettlement to the homeland. Only 14 percent of the land in Ciskei is arable? roughly comparable to the proportion of arable land in the rest of South Africa. Overgrazing of the already poor soil by cattle herds is another problem. Overcrowding, coupled with primitive agricultural practices and the fact that up to 15 Secret Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/01/19: CIA-RDP84500552R000100020002-6 25X1 25X1 25X1 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/01/19: CIA-RDP84500552R000100020002-6 Secret Economic Activity Political Developments Secret 90 percent of the adult male population has permanently departed from some areas, has limited food production in Ciskei to around 10 to 20 percent of the homeland's needs. An estimated 50 percent of Ciskei's children suffer from malnutrition. Annually around 10 percent of the infants under age 1 die from hunger, and about half of the 2- and 3-year-olds are malnourished. Ciskei is one of the poorest homelands and remains largely dependent on South Africa for jobs and subsidies. Pretoria underwrites up to 80 percent of Ciskei's budget. Some 70 percent of Ciskei's wage income comes from outside the homeland-30 percent from commuters and 40 percent from migrants?leaving only 30 percent to be earned locally. Because many residents of Ciskei live adjacent to white South Africa, as much as 80 percent of the wage income is spent outside the homeland. Mdantsane, a Ciskei city adjoining East London, further illustrates the homeland's dependence on South Africa. The city was established in 1963 as a black South African township, but Pretoria readjusted the boundary in 1966 to absorb it into Ciskei. Today, with a population estimated at 175,000, Mdantsane is larger than East London. It attracts people from throughout Ciskei because it is one of the few places in the homeland within easy commuting distance of white South Africa. Over half the people living in this city commute daily to jobs in East London. In an effort to reduce the flow of income out of Ciskei, the homeland government is making an effort at industrial development in central Ciskei. Only a few industries have been attracted, however?a result of Ciskei's potential for political instability and meager economic base. White managers, moreover, are reluctant to commute the long distance from King Williams Town, the nearest white town in which they could live. Ciskei's agricultural performance is weak. There are few storage dams to compensate for periodic drought. Even more important, in some villages over 90 percent of the working-age males have migrated to either Mdantsane or white South Africa. In addition, land allocation is controlled by local chiefs, who frequently allocate plots on the basis of bribes rather than need, compounding the problem of nonutilization of land. President Lennox Sebe resisted accepting \"independence\" until he was convinced he had obtained a better deal than the other \"independent\" homelands. His demands included South African citizenship for Ciskei residents, more land than Ciskei originally was slated to receive, and a favorable financial arrangement. Sebe believed the South African Government had agreed to these conditions, but it subsequently reneged on most of its promises. Ciskeians lost their South African citizenship, and so far the homeland has received only a small amount of additional land. The main beneficiaries of \"independence\" have been Sebe himself and his political cronies. 16 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/01/19: CIA-RDP84500552R000100020002-6 2-gX1 UI ii 25X1 2-gX1 UI 27X1 25X1 25X1 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/01/19: CIA-RDP84500552R000100020002-6 Secret A private poll conducted in Ciskei just before \"independence\" showed that about 90 percent of the residents opposed it. Although \"independence\" received a majority of the vote in a government-run referendum in 1981, most urban voters boycotted the balloting. Nonetheless, the referendum was cited by President Sebe and Pretoria as proof that Ciskei residents wanted independence. Ciskei has evolved into a virtual police state. Since December 1981, Sebe and his brother, Maj. Gen. Charles Sebe?Minister of Defense and head of the Ciskei Intelligence Service?have publicly reiterated that they intend to root out all opposition to the regime. Major General Sebe, who formerly worked for South Africa's security forces, tends to parrot Pretoria's terminology, frequently referring to \"ANC terrorists,\" \"the Communist menace,\" \"total onslaught,\" and similar concepts. By and large, Pretoria has thus far turned a blind eye to the Sebes' repressive ac- tions, insisting that Ciskei is a \"sovereign state\" and that South Africa cannot interfere in its internal affairs. According to US Embassy reporting, Pretoria's efforts to transfer Kangwane and Ngwavuma to Swaziland were watched apprehensively in Ciskei because George Matanzima, Prime Minister of neighboring Transkei and brother of that home- land's President, wants to absorb Ciskei into Transkei. Unification of the Swazi ar- eas would create a precedent for merging the two Xhosa homelands, Ciskei and Transkei. We believe, however, that these homelands are unlikely to be merged be- cause Pretoria's program of homeland \"independence\" would suffer a substantial further loss of credibility if an \"independent\" homeland?Ciskei?were eliminated against the wishes of its leadership. 17 Secret Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/01/19: CIA-RDP84500552R000100020002-6 25X1 25X1 25X1 25X1 25X1 25X1 25X1 Secret Leader Secret Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/01/19: CIA-RDP84500552R000100020002-6 Liaison ? Lennox Leslie Sebe has been President of South Africa's newest \"independent\" homeland since 1981. Sebe lobbied Pretoria for more land, more money, and the retention of South African citizenship for all Ciskeians after \"independence.\" US Embassy officials have noted, however, that Sebe was \"so intoxicated\" by the prospect of independence that he was outmaneuvered by South African officials during the negotiations and gained few of his demands. He has instituted a repressive regime that in our view demonstrates his fear of potential political unrest in the Ciskei. The President has cooperated with the South African Government to control increasingly frequent dissident activities among Ciskeian laborers located in nearby East London. He has encouraged private South African and foreign investment in Ciskeian industry and has promoted several agricultural projects, but critical South African journalists and politicians note that these efforts benefit only a few Ciskeians?mainly the President, his brother, and some of their political followers. Sebe was born on 26 July 1926. He earned a certificate from the Lovedale Teachers Training College in Alice, South Africa, in 1947. He subsequently taught secondary school and became an administrator in the black school system of Cape Province. In 1968, he entered the newly formed Ciskei Cabinet as Minister of Education. In 1973 he became Chief Minister. He is married and has several children. 18 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/01/19: CIA-RDP84500552R000100020002-6 25X1 25X1 ?1 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/01/19: CIA-RDP84500552R000100020002-6 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/01/19: CIA-RDP84500552R000100020002-6 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/01/19: CIA-RDP84500552R000100020002-6 Secret Geographic and Demo- graphic Features Economic Activity GAZANKULU Gazankulu, located in the remote, semiarid northern Transvaal, has a weak economy. Pretoria wants to divest itself of this homeland, but it would have difficulty turning Gazankulu over to a neighboring country because the homeland is completely surrounded by South Africa and other homelands. We believe a more likely scenario is that South Africa will continue to move this homeland toward \"independence.\" The Shangaan and Tsonga peoples who make up some four-fifths of the population of Gazankulu are closely related historically, culturally, and linguistically. Both tribes speak the Tsonga language. Outsiders tend to use the two tribal names interchangeably, but the Shangaan and the Tsonga resent being called by the other's name. The peoples of Gazankulu had difficulty agreeing on a name for their homeland, so they settled on the 19th-century name of their area of origin in Mozambique?Gaza?and added the suffix kulu, meaning \"big.\" During the 1970s Gazankulu's population growth rate rose to 5.8 percent annually?the highest rate for any homeland except for tiny Qwaqwa?as a result of forced resettlement of blacks from Johannesburg and white areas of rural Transvaal. Nonetheless, Gazankulu remains one of the least populated homelands. An estimated 900,000 people were assigned to it in 1980, but only about half of them actually lived there. Gazankulu's economy is severely hampered by the limited number of job opportunities in the homeland or within daily commuting distance. Nearly 75 percent of Gazankulu's wage earners work outside the homeland: over 60 percent have migrated to white areas?the second-highest proportion among the home- lands. Because of Gazankulu's relative isolation from major industrial areas, only 13 percent commute daily. The homeland borders on Lebowa, Venda, and the Kruger National Park. Gazankulu's most conspicuous economic activity is in Giyani, the capital, where the South African Government is financing construction of government buildings, a mansion for Chief Minister Hudson Ntsanwisi, houses for civil servants, and shopping and banking facilities. The population of Giyani was officially reported at only 2,000 in 1976, but an estimated 20,000 people now live in the vicinity, mostly in small mud houses. Some 45 percent of Gazankulu's workers are engaged in subsistence farming, but the homeland produces no more than 10 to 20 percent of its food needs.

With most of the men working in white South Africa, cultivation is left to the women, whose other chores leave little time to tend farm plots. Lack of money for fertilizer, improved seeds, and other inputs also handicaps farming. Yields per hectare for corn?the homeland's staple?are only about a fourth of the South African average. Political Developments Chief Minister Ntsanwisi is under strong and growing pressure from Pretoria to accept \"independence.\" To counter Pretoria's pressure, he has sought closer association with the South African Black Alliance (SABA), an association of black political organiza- tions headed by KwaZulu Chief Minister Gatsha Buthelezi that strongly opposes \"independence\" for homelands. Ntsanwisi, like Buthelezi, believes in dealing with Pretoria even while opposing its actions. Based on limited press reporting, we believe that Ntsanwisi's government is one of the least corrupt and repressive of the homeland regimes.

E. Ntsanwisi has been Chief Minister of Gazankulu since 1973. A vocal homeland leader, he has frequently served as a spokesman for the noninde- pendent homeland leaders. One of the few homeland leaders respected among urban blacks, the Chief Minister would like to defend the black cause more vehemently, but we believe he is unwilling to risk his personal position or the future of Gazankulu. Ntsanwisi was born on 11 July 1920. After receiving a B.A. degree in English and Bantu in 1946 from Fort Hare University?a black South African institution?he taught school. He subsequently earned a B.A. degree in 1963 and an M.A. degree in 1965 in linguistics from the University of South Africa, a correspondence school. In 1963, Ntsanwisi joined the Department of Bantu languages at the University of the North (in Transvaal) and became chairman of the department in 1967. During 1966 he studied linguistics at Georgetown University on a grant from the privately sponsored US?South African Leadership Exchange Program. He returned to the United States as an International Visitors Leader Grantee in 1973. Ntsanwisi is sophisticated and articulate and has written several works on linguistics. Ntsanwisi is married and has several children. 21 Secret Copy Approved for Release 2011/01/19: CIA-RDP84500552R000100020002-6 25X1 25X1 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/01/19: CIA-RDP84500552R000100020002-6 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/01/19: CIA-RDP84500552R000100020002-6 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/01/19: CIA-RDP84500552R000100020002-6 Secret Geographic and Demo- graphic Features Economic Activity KANG WANE South Africa began negotiating with Swaziland in 1976 on transferring control of the Kangwane homeland to Swaziland. The major sticking point in the negotia- tions?Swaziland's demand that it be granted a corridor to the sea?was overcome this year after Pretoria added a portion of the KwaZulu homeland to its offer. The late King Sobhuza II of Swaziland strongly favored the land transfers. Sobhuza envisaged the reunification of all Swazi people and acquisition of a route to the sea through Ngwavuma as crowning achievements of his 61-year reign. His death in August 1982, together with Pretoria's recent out-of-court settlement with Kang- wane of its lawsuit contesting the transfer, have halted the proceedings indefinite- ly. Kangwane's 3,720 square kilometers?slightly larger than Rhode Island?makes it one of the smallest of South Africa's homelands. Kangwane's predominately Swazi population grew from about 120,000 in 1970 to 160,000 in 1980, due in part to resettlement but mostly to natural increase. Nearly 600,000 Swazi live in white South Africa. The Swazi ethnic group came into being in the early 19th century when several Nguni tribes were unified under the leadership of King Sobhuza I. The Swazi people were divided in 1880, when Britain and South Africa forced Sobhuza's successor, King Mbandzeni, to cede control over the northern and western portions of the kingdom. The Swazis have remained separated ever since. In 1963, South African Prime Minister Verwoerd offered to return part of this ter- ritory to Swaziland?then a British protectorate?but Swaziland's rulers refused, holding out for the entire area that had been ceded in 1880. In 1977, Pretoria es- tablished the Kangwane homeland, which encompasses about one-third of the area ceded by King Mbandzeni. Kangwane, like most of the homelands, is endemically poor; its current annual per capita income is only about $315, or about half that of neighboring Swaziland. Ag- riculture accounts for about one-fourth of Kangwane's economic output, but only 15 percent of its agricultural production is marketed. Scant transport and communications facilities, the existence of far better investment opportunities in the nearby Johannesburg area, and Pretoria's longstanding policy of encouraging manufacturers to locate plants outside the homelands under its border industries program, have combined to keep industrialization in Kangwane to a minimum. Government services and small businesses account for most of the homeland's modern-sector economic activity. 23 Secret Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/01/19: CIA-RDP84500552R000100020002-6 25X1 25X1 25X1 25X1 25X1 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/01/19 : CIA-RDP84500552R000100020002-6 Secret Political Developments Secret As is the case with the other homelands, most income is earned outside Kangwane's borders. Migrants working in Transvaal cities, especially in the Johannesburg area, remit about 70 percent of the homeland's income. Commuters working in nearby cities account for another 10 percent. For Pretoria, amalgamation of Kangwane with Swaziland has been an opportunity to rectify South Africa's longstanding border disagreement with Swaziland, get rid of an impoverished region, and remove an estimated 716,000 ethnic Swazis from South Africa's overall black population of 22 million. The issue gained public attention last December when the Kangwane Legislative Assembly, angered that the homeland was not represented in Swaziland's negotiations with South Africa, rejected amalgamation outright. In mid-1982, Pretoria stepped up its efforts to shed Kangwane?in our view, because of the advanced age of the Swazi king and uncertainty about the attitudes of a successor. South Africa announced in June 1982 that agreement with the Government of Swaziland had been reached on transferring Kangwane and Ngwavuma?the northern portion of the KwaZulu homeland?to Swaziland. A few days later the Kangwane Legislative Assembly and cabinet were abolished and administration was taken over by the South African Ministry of Cooperation and Development. KwaZulu officials filed, and won, three challenges before the South African Supreme Court. The court ruled that Pretoria had failed to consult that homeland's government?as required under various South African laws?before announcing its intention to make the transfer. Kangwane officials also filed suit. Expecting, in our view, that Kangwane would win its case, Pretoria agreed in November 1982 to an out-of-court settlement, whereby it would pay all court costs incurred by Kangwane. At the same time, the Kangwane Legislative Assembly and cabinet were reinstated. We believe the transfer issue could eventually reemerge, however, because the commission established to investigate the views of all parties on the transfers still functions. Moreover, Swaziland continues to insist on the \"return\" of the disputed territories. The question of amalgamation has divided Kangwane's traditional and elected leaders. During King Sobhuza's reign, Kangwane's traditional headmen and chiefs supported amalgamation, wanting to be united with Swaziland under its monarch. On the other hand, the popular Kangwane Chief Minister, Enos Mabuza, speaking for the homeland government and most of its people, has strongly opposed unification. Although most residents of Kangwane seem to support amalgamation, it is difficult to determine the views of the widely scattered ethnic Swazi population living elsewhere in South Africa. Chief Minister Mabuza has asserted that these people oppose any move that would eliminate their South African citizenship and give Pretoria even tighter control over their access to jobs in white areas. 24 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/01/19: CIA-RDP84500552R000100020002-6 II 25X1 111 25X1 25X1 111 25X1 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/01/19: CIA-RDP84500552R000100020002-6 Secret We believe that most traditional headmen and chiefs in both Kangwane and Swaziland still want to pursue the transfers, but that with Sobhuza's death their ability to influence the situation has been reduced. Moreover, some government officials in Swaziland, aware of the drawbacks of amalgamating these economical- ly weak regions, are opposed to the transfers, and now that Sobhuza is gone they are likely to voice their misgivings openly. The judicial obstacles are surmountable: since the South African constitution allows retroactive changes in the law, the Parliament could make the transfer legal by altering the laws that require Pretoria to consult with the homelands. Amalgamation of Kangwane and Ngwavuma with Swaziland would set a precedent for turning over other homelands to neighboring countries with which they are tribally linked, such as Bophuthatswana to Botswana and Qwaqwa to Lesotho. In contrast to most of the other small, isolated homelands, Kangwane seems to have an open, efficient, responsive government. Chief Minister Mabuza has asserted that during the period in 1982 when the South African Ministry of Cooperation and Development controlled administration of the homeland, many civil servants staged a work slowdown and others took extended vacations 25 Secret Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/01/19: CIA-RDP84500552R000100020002-6 25X1 25X1 Secret Leader Secret Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/01/19: CIA-RDP84500552R000100020002-6 Franz Furst 0 Enos Mabuza, Chief Minister of Kangwane, temporarily lost his position in 1982, when Pretoria dissolved the Kangwane Legislative Assembly and placed the homeland under the administration of the South African Department of Coopera- tion and Development.

Subse- quently, the South African Supreme Court disclaimed the voting results on a technicality and Dlamini returned to the Legislative Assembly as its head until 1978 Normally quiet-mannered, Mabuza has publicly displayed \"controlled, cold anger\" over the South African plan to merge his homeland with Swaziland, according to US Embassy officials. He is about 43 years old. Mabuza is married and has several children. 26 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/01/19: CIA-RDP84500552R000100020002-6 25X1 1 II 25X1 II 25X1 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/01/19: CIA-RDP84500552R000100020002-6 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/01/19: CIA-RDP84500552R000100020002-6 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/01/19: CIA-RDP84500552R000100020002-6 Secret Geographic and Demo- graphic Features KWANDEBELE KwaNdebele is little more than a dormitory compound for the Pretoria-Johannes- burg area. South Africa nonetheless is trying to prompt the homeland to accept \"independence\" by offering it additional land. Should this effort fail, we believe that Pretoria might eventually try to turn KwaNdebele over to Bophuthatswana or to nearby and tribally linked Lebowa. The South Ndebele people of the KwaNdebele homeland broke away centuries ago from the Nguni-speaking peoples of present-day Natal. Members of the tribe subsequently dispersed through much of central Transvaal Province and were forced to live among their more populous neighbors, especially the Tswana and North Sotho. South Africa created KwaNdebele, the last homeland to be formed, in 1977. Pretoria apparently was surprised by the heightened ethnic tensions that were triggered by KwaNdebele's birth. Land taken from Lebowa and given to KwaNdebele intensified ethnic frictions between Lebowa's dominant North Sotho and the South Ndebele. Moreover, many of the South Ndebele wanted to remain in Lebowa with their North Ndebele kin, who form a minority in that homeland. KwaNdebele?a single parcel of land less than half the size of Rhode Island?dif- fers from the other homelands in that the vast majority of its people have moved there voluntarily. The US Embassy points to the relative absence of attitudes of hopelessness and anomie and the presence of a well-organized community leadership as key factors differentiating KwaNdebele from other homelands. 25X1 25X1 25X1 The homeland's population was estimated at 32,000 in 1970; today South African officials estimate it at 166,000 (KwaNdebele officials claim the population is 25X1 500,000). An independent survey by the private South African Human Sciences Research Council found that 55 percent of the new arrivals came from rural areas in Transvaal Province, 30 percent from Bophuthatswana (mostly from the Winterveld squatter area), 8 percent from white urban areas, and most of the remaining 7 percent from Lebowa. According to the US Embassy in Pretoria, the South Ndebele value the KwaNdebele homeland as a place where they are not subject to the control of oth- er ethnic groups as they were in Bophuthatswana and Lebowa. They are content to have secure land ownership instead of the uncertainty of squatting in white South Africa, and they are gratified that their children can speak their native language in school. They attach particular importance to being able to live within commuting distance of Pretoria (75 kilometers away) and Johannesburg (125 kilometers away). 27 Secret Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/01/19: CIA-RDP84500552R000100020002-6 25X1 25X1 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/01/19: CIA-RDP84500552R000100020002-6 Secret Economic Activity Political Developments KwaNdebele has no known mineral resources, limited water supplies, little fertile land, and scant commercial or manufacturing activity. Nearly all businesses are family-owned and staffed, and only 5 percent of these employ four or more people. Most businesses have no electricity or running water. Only 12 percent of the average household's income is earned within the borders of KwaNdebele, and the homeland, like many others, is a labor pool for white cities. The number of buses leaving daily for Pretoria .has doubled in recent months, reflecting the homeland's population explosion and the dearth of local job opportunities. The KwaNdebele Legislative Assembly voted in May 1982 to seek \"indepen- dence\" from South Africa. According to the US Embassy, Chief Minister Simon Skosana subsequently predicted that \"independence\" would not be achieved for five years, an estimate with which at least one senior South African official agrees. Before Pretoria grants \"independence,\" KwaNdebele will need the symbols of nationhood?a capital, office buildings, paved roads, and the like?which it lacks at present. In contrast to its tough approach with other homelands on the issue of additional land, Pretoria has announced plans to transfer small portions of land from Bophuthatswana and Lebowa to KwaNdebele. KwaNdebele already shows signs of becoming a petty dictatorship. In May 1981, for example, officials of the liberal South African Institute of Race Relations and the South African Council of Churches were detained by a local headman for 10 hours without any charge being placed against them. According to Embassy reporting, the detainees concluded that local officials feared the group might publicize the political conditions they had witnessed in the homeland. Reports in the South African press indicate that KwaNdebele's cabinet?appointed by Pretoria?tends to ignore the wishes of the people. Members of the cabinet, according to these same press reports, are viewed by the population as inexperi- enced, poorly educated, heavyhanded, and unpopular.

Chief Minister Gatsha Buthelezi has long rejected \"independence,\" but South African Government spokesmen publicly assert that Buthelezi, by accepting self-governing status, committed himself to eventual independence. Pretoria, in our view, tolerates Buthelezi's intransigence because the popular support he gains for taking such a stance tends to fragment black nationalism in South Africa. Pretoria's efforts to transfer the northernmost parcel of KwaZulu to Swaziland have been blocked indefinitely by court challenges. We believe, however, that South Africa could yet pass legislation legalizing the transfer?even though this would anger the coun- try's 6 million Zulu. KwaZulu's fragmented character?the homeland is comprised of 19 large and about 45 small parcels of land?stems from the confrontation between Boer settlers, the British, and the Zulus in the 19th century. Originally, Zulus were protected by the colonial government from encroachment by white settlers, but the needs of the colonial economy soon won out and the blacks lost much of their land. In the war of 1879 the Zulus were defeated by the whites, their king exiled, and their kingdom broken into separate chieftaincies. After 1904, when all African territory was opened to white settlement, Zulu landholdings fell by 40 percent within a decade, and many in the tribe were pushed onto less desirable land. 25X1 25X1 25X1 Today, about half of South Africa's Zulus live in KwaZulu, where the average population density is four times greater than in the rest of South Africa. The land is overgrazed and eroded, and malnutrition is common, especially among children. A drought in 1981 was the worst in KwaZulu's history. Considering the homeland's estimated population growth of 4.1 percent annually?due in part to resettlement?conditions almost certainly will worsen. 25X1 KwaZulu has virtually no prospect of becoming economically self-sufficient. Like the other homelands, it is heavily dependent on Pretoria for economic assistance and employment of a large segment of its population 25X1 An educational system aimed at providing only minimum literary skills has left KwaZulu short of businessmen and administrators. These factors, together with a lack of credit and banking facilities, weak infrastructure, and high transport costs, have severely limited local business ownership. The result is that nearly all of the industry in the homeland?located almost exclusively in the Isethebe industrial zone north of Durban?is white-owned. 31 Secret Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/01/19: CIA-RDP84500552R000100020002-6 25X1 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/01/19: CIA-RDP84500552R000100020002-6 Secret KwaZulu. Rural resettlement area Political Developments Secret Over 90 percent of the homeland's wage earners are employed in white South Africa. Only 8 percent of KwaZulu's paid employment is within the homeland. Kwa Zulu accounts for about 10 percent of South Africa's population, but it contributes less than 1 percent of the total gross domestic product. Agriculture is primarily at a subsistence level: only about a third of the homeland's food supply is locally produced. With most of the men and half of the women working in white South Africa, farming is left to the remaining women, children, and old people, who manage to cultivate only half the arable land. A land tenure system, in which individual families are assigned farm plots by the local chief, is also partly responsible for KwaZulu's low agricultural production. Zulus have little incentive to invest in the land, conserve the soil, or use good hus- bandry techniques. Large cattle herds have historically been used as insurance against drought and as status symbols; they are seldom used for income. Thus, less than 1 percent of the herd is slaughtered annually, compared with 10 to 20 percent annually for income-producing herds on white-owned farms in South Africa. Chief Minister Buthelezi, unlike the leaders of the other homelands, aspires to and shows some potential for a wider South African political role. Through his leadership of Inkatha?the National Cultural Liberation Movement?Buthelezi has been able to build a substantial political base both inside and outside KwaZulu. Inkatha, originally organized as a Zulu cultural institution in the 1920s, was reshaped by Buthelezi in the mid-1970s to mobilize wide support for his political and social policies. The organization currently claims about 300,000 members-20 32 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/01/19: CIA-RDP84500552R000100020002-6 27X1 WI 27X1 UI II 25X1 25X1 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/01/19: CIA-RDP84500552R000100020002-6 Secret KwaZulu. Makeshift buildings in a resettlement area percent of whom the organization says are non-Zulu?making it the largest black political organization in South Africa. Inkatha's vague platform of black national- ism calls for majority rule, political and economic equality for blacks, and the maintenance of Zulu cultural identity. Buthelezi has consistently rejected \"independence\" for KwaZulu, arguing instead for a national political role for blacks. At the same time, he has demanded greater land concessions from South Africa to consolidate the fragmented homeland. Pretoria in the past has paid lipservice to KwaZulu's demands for more land, but opposition from whites and financial considerations have kept Pretoria from going forward with extensive consolidation of the homeland. A commission set up by Buthelezi to explore alternatives to \"independence\" for KwaZulu released its report in May 1982. It concluded that a joint regional government for KwaZulu and South Africa's Natal Province?with white, Zulu, and Indian participation?was both feasible and desirable. Pretoria rejected the Commission's recommendations, which conflicted with South Africa's plans for eventual \"independence\" for all the homelands. Despite Pretoria's rejection, we believe KwaZulu and Natal officials will continue to strive for some sort of political association between the two within this decade. In early 1982 KwaZulu was drawn into South Africa's plan to transfer the Kangwane homeland to Swaziland when Pretoria added Ngwavuma?the north- ern portion of KwaZulu?to its offer to the Swazis. Acquisition of Ngwavuma would give landlocked Swaziland a route to the sea. Three successful court challenges by KwaZulu officials to Pretoria's right to cede Ngwavuma to Swaziland have blocked the transfer indefinitely. But Swaziland officials say they still want the land, and the South African Parliament could pass legislation legitimizing the transfer, thereby skirting the court decisions. 33 Secret Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/01/19: CIA-RDP84500552R000100020002-6 25X1 25X1 25X1 25X1 25X1 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/01/19 : CIA-RDP84500552R000100020002-6 Secret Leader Liaison C Mangosuthu Gatsha Buthelezi, Chief Minister of KwaZulu since 1978, is one of South Africa's most dynamic and renowned black leaders. Since 1976, he has also been president of Inkatha (the National Cultural Liberation Movement), South Africa's largest black political organization. As Chief Minister and head of Inkatha, Buthelezi leads approximately 6 million Zulu nationwide. Despite his widespread popularity among the Zulu, Buthelezi has been criticized over the years by other blacks (and some Zulu) for working solely within the system to achieve change. Buthelezi was born on 2 August 1928. He attended the University of Fort Hare but was expelled in 1950 for taking part in a student demonstration against a visit- ing British dignitary. He resumed his studies at the University of Natal and received a B.A. degree in history and Bantu administration. Alert, energetic, and cheerful, Buthelezi is an eloquent speaker.

Despite repeated refusals of \"independence\" by Chief Minister Cedric Phatudi, the US Embassy reports that Pretoria wants to divest it- self of this impoverished homeland. Since Lebowa is not adjacent to and therefore could not be absorbed by any black African country, we believe Pretoria will offer financial incentives to persuade it to accept independence. The people of Lebowa, which became a self-governing homeland in 1972, belong to a variety of tribes. Most are members of the North Sotho tribal group, but small numbers of North Ndebele also live there. The North Sotho grouping consists of 12 large tribes, each of which has several subtribes. The various groups had trouble agreeing even on the name for the homeland; \"Lebowa,\" meaning north, was a compromise solution. Demands by members of the South Ndebele group for their own homeland prompted Pretoria in 1977 to declare an area that had been the southernmost parcel of Lebowa a new homeland, KwaNdebele. Since then, some of the North Ndebele in Lebowa have voiced interest in merging with KwaNdebele. 25X1 25X1 25X1 Lebowa is the third largest of South Africa's homelands, combining two large and four small parcels in an area slightly larger than Massachusetts. With an assigned population of 2.5 million in 1980, it also is the third most populous homeland. About three-fifths of the assigned residents actually live there. Pretoria's resettle- ment of blacks from white areas, primarily Johannesburg and rural areas in northern Transvaal, caused Lebowa's residential population growth during the 25X1 1970s to rise to 4.2 percent annually. The population growth rate without resettlement was 3.7 percent annually, on a par with most other homelands. During the late 1970s, South African authorities ordered 3,000 to 4,000 North Sotho who had inhabited a fertile valley in Lebowa for over a century to move to land that was less productive and farther from white areas. These people had formed a self-sufficient and stable community for generations, and many had commuted daily to jobs in nearby white areas. Pretoria took the area from Lebowa ostensibly to straighten the boundary, but many of the affected blacks believed they were being removed so that white farmers could have their fertile land. Most were unwilling to move to poor land or to give up daily commuting to live instead in single-sex dormitories near their jobs. As a result, only about 350 people voluntarily followed their chief to the new area. 35 Secret Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/01/19: CIA-RDP84500552R000100020002-6 25X1 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/01/19: CIA-RDP84500552R000100020002-6 Secret Political Developments Some of the others were forced to join their chief, and about 1,500 fled to a nearby area in Lebowa, where they settled among their ethnic kin and could still commute to work in white cities. Economic Activity Economic activity in Lebowa consists of subsistence agriculture, chrome ore and asbestos mining, light manufacturing, retail sales, housing and road construction, and government service. Locally earned per capita income averaged less than $100 in the mid-1970s. Even the addition of migrant income lifted the per capita average for the same period to only about $220. South African subsidies averaged nearly 75 percent of Lebowa's operating budget in 1975-79?a higher proportion than Pretoria has assumed for most of the homelands. The South Africans further increased Lebowa's annual allocation during the 1979-81 period. Only 20 percent of Lebowa's wage earners work in the homeland. Another 25 percent commute to jobs in nearby white areas?mostly in Pietersburg, about 10 kilometers from the border?and the remaining 55 percent have migrated to distant white areas, mainly Johannesburg. Mineral production within the homeland was valued at $75 million in 1979, but tion has limited the available jobs, profits are repatriated to white South Africa, processing takes place outside the homeland, and Lebowan wages are spent primarily in white-owned stores. Chief Minister Phatudi has consistently rejected \"independence\" for Lebowa. In 1979 Phatudi established a select committee of the Legislative Assembly to investigate alternatives for the homeland. The committee's report recommended rejection of \"independence\" and also called for territorial consolidation. Even though South Africa subsidizes such a large share of Lebowa's operating budget, Phatudi has repeatedly accused Pretoria of financially favoring the homelands that are willing to accept \"independence.\" Phatudi seems rapidly to be losing popular support within Lebowa. A long-term resident of Soweto, Phatudi is considered an outsider by most residents of the exploration and exploitation have yielded few benefits locally. Indeed, mechaniza- homeland. According to US Embassy reporting, he also tends to rule by fiat rather than by traditional consensus building, and his government is generally regarded locally as corrupt.

He has fre- quently stressed the homeland government's commitment to free enterprise and has encouraged private US and white South African investment in Lebowa. Phatudi has headed the ruling Lebowa People's Party since 1973. Strongly anti- Soviet, he has been friendly with US Embassy officers in Pretoria. Embassy officials have noted that because Phatudi rules in an authoritarian manner rather than by consensus, political opposition to him has developed since 1979. These same officials also note that Phatudi, who resided in Soweto until the early 1970s, is regarded as an outsider by many Lebowans. He has also provoked criticism among local residents through his continued push to rename the homeland capital, Lebowakgomo, Phatudi City. Phatudi was born in 1912. After teaching school during the early 1940s, he earned a B.A. degree in history and the English and North Sotho languages from the Uni- versity of Fort Hare in 1947 and a B.Ed. degree from the University of Witwatersrand in 1960. He was subsequently a school principal and supervisor of education. Articulate and persuasive, Phatudi is reserved and has a courtly manner. US Embassy officials have observed that he is vulnerable to flattery. The Chief Minister has written and published many works in the North Sotho language, including translations of Shakespeare. He is an elder of the Dutch Reformed Church. He is married and has several children. 37 Secret Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/01/19: CIA-RDP84500552R000100020002-6 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/01/19: CIA-RDP84500552R000100020002-6 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/01/19: CIA-RDP84500552R000100020002-6 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/01/19: CIA-RDP84500552R000100020002-6 Secret Geographic and Demo- graphic Features Economic Activity QWAQWA The South African Government is considering two options for the future of the tiny homeland of Qwaqwa. Pretoria may: ? Decide to give Qwaqwa more land as an inducement to accept \"independence,\" even though there is no possibility that this homeland can become economically viable. ? Choose to give Qwaqwa to neighboring Lesotho, where most of the homeland's tribal group live. We believe that the South Africans would prefer to transfer Qwaqwa to Lesotho but that they will not take any action before the issue of transferring Kangwane and Ngwavuma to Swaziland is finally settled. Qwaqwa is inhabited by the South Sotho people, who broke away over 300 years ago from the Tswana tribe in the region that is now Bophuthatswana and migrated southward. Almost all of the 135 tribes that make up the South Sotho grouping now live in Lesotho; only three of these tribes are in Qwaqwa. 25X1 25X1 During the 1970s, Qwaqwa's population soared from 25,000 to an estimated 155,000, primarily because of Pretoria's program of removing blacks from the cities of white South Africa and resettling them in the homelands. Most South So- tho remained in white areas, however, while others found jobs through hiring offices in the homeland and subsequently returned to South ikfrica. At present only about 10 percent of Qwaqwa's assigned population resides there?the lowest rate of any homeland. Most of the remaining 90 percent live and work on white farms in Orange Free State or in South African cities, especially Johannesburg. Pretoria's strategy of enticing blacks to Qwaqwa by not building secondary schools for them in Orange Free State towns and by expanding Qwaqwa's educational 25X1 facilities beyond the homeland's immediate needs has attracted an estimated 70,000 students. As a result, Qwaqwa has many students, but few adults. Three out of four of these students come from families remaining in white areas. 25X1 Given Qwaqwa's population density of 322 persons per square kilometer and the fact that only one-tenth of the land is arable, population pressure on the land actually farmed is severe. Moreover, at least one-third of Qwaqwa's good farmland is occupied by shantytowns that have sprung up in recent years. Buttressed by Pretoria's heavy budget subsidies and migrant remittances, Qwaq- wa's governmental expenditures annually exceed locally generated income by nearly three times. The homeland is unable to produce enough food for its population and?like most of the homelands?depends on South Africa to make up the difference. 39 Secret Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/01/19: CIA-RDP84500552R000100020002-6 25X1 25X1 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/01/19: CIA-RDP84500552R000100020002-6 Secret Political Developments The few jobs that exist in Qwaqwa are found in government, construction, and a few light industries geared to the local market. Economic development is severely hampered by a lack of good roads, communications, and other facilities. In 1976, Qwaqwa's local per capita income was about $70. Even if commuter income and migrant remittances are taken into account, per capita income amounted to only about $210 per year?roughly on a par with Africa's poorest countries. Chief Minister T. K. Mopeli has said he will accept \"independence\" for Qwaqwa only if the Thaba `Nchu area of Bophuthatswana is included in the package. The annexation of Thaba `Nchu would approximately double Qwaqwa's size. Bophuth- atswana and Qwaqwa have long disputed the Thaba `Nchu area, which is inhabited mostly by South Sotho. The US Embassy in Maseru reports that Bophuthatswana's President Mangope has said his government will never agree to give up the disputed area. Nonetheless, the Embassy reports that Pretoria is considering such a transfer. Meanwhile, the government of neighboring Lesotho argues that Qwaqwa and Thaba `Nchu should be part of that country. in our view, Lesotho would resist absorbing Qwaqwa because doing so would heavily burden Lesotho's fragile economy. Nonetheless, if Pretoria were to succeed in transfering Kangwane to Swaziland, we believe it will press hard?and probably successfully?for the amalgamation of Qwaqwa, without Thaba `Nchu, into Lesotho.

Tsiame Kenneth Mopeli has been Chief Minister of Qwaqwa since 1975. He has publicly condemned apartheid, but has stated that change in South Africa can be accomplished through peaceful means. Mopeli was born on 20 September 1930. He began teaching school in 1951 and by 1974 he was an inspector of black schools in the Orange Free State. In 1974, he re- ceived a B.A. degree in Afrikaans and Dutch from the University of South Africa. Mopeli's political career began in 1969, when he was nominated a member of the Qwaqwa Legislative Assembly. A son of a hereditary South Sotho chief, Mopeli was entitled to one of the 26 appointed seats in the 40-member assembly. In 1974, he relinquished his appointed seat to form the Dikwankwetla Party, which in 1975 won the first general election in Qwaqwa. He was subsequently named Chief Minister. Mopeli is quiet and reserved. He has written two radio plays on the history of Qwaqwa. Until 1971 he was an elder in the Dutch Reformed Church. He enjoys reading and gardening. Mopeli is married and has several children. 41 Secret Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/01/19: CIA-RDP84500552R000100020002-6 25X1 25X1 25X1 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/01/19: CIA-RDP84500552R000100020002-6 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/01/19: CIA-RDP84500552R000100020002-6 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/01/19: CIA-RDP84500552R000100020002-6 Secret Geographic and Demographic Features Economic Activity TRANSKEI Six years after becoming the first homeland to receive its \"independence\" from South Africa, Transkei remains mired in poverty and dependent on Pretoria for budget support and jobs for its unemployed. Transkei citizens, meanwhile, are still being forcibly removed from South Africa. President Kaiser Matanzima has suppressed political opposition. In doing so, he has patterned Transkei's security legislation after Pretoria's and has built up a security force that depends heavily on South African assistance. Matanzima supports Pretoria's goal of a South African?sponsored \"constellation of states\" comprised of South Africa itself, the homelands, and Botswana, Lesotho, and Swaziland. The proposed transfer of some homeland territories to Swaziland has led Prime Minister George Matanzima, the President's younger brother, to call for creation of a single homeland for the Xhosa ethnic group. Transkei, largest of the homelands, consists of one large and two small parcels of land in a combined area slightly larger than Maryland and Delaware. Nine-tenths of the land is hilly or mountainous, and much of it suffers from severe erosion due to overgrazing of cattle. Rainfall and agricultural potential are greatest along the coast and near the border with Lesotho. Transkei's Xhosa speaking peoples arrived in the area in two waves. The first group arrived before 1700 from areas to the north of present-day South Africa. These Xhosa speakers fought a number of frontier wars with Dutch settlers beginning in the middle of the 19th century. The second Xhosa influx into Transkei occurred at the end of the 19th century as a result of the Zulu tribal con- quests in the area of present-day KwaZulu, which forced the Xhosa to move southward along the coast. In 1970, about 55 percent of Transkei's assigned population of 3 million lived in the homeland. By 1980, 59 percent of the 4.3 million people assigned to the homeland lived there; the increase was largely a result of forced removals from white South Africa. In addition to the Xhosa, the homeland contains about 75,000 South Sotho and 25,000 Zulu. Transkei's abundant rainfall and numerous streams that flow out of the mountains give it the highest agricultural potential of the homelands. A variety of political, economic, and cultural factors, however, have seriously inhibited agricultural modernization. The most important of these factors is land tenure. Land is communally owned and arbitrarily allocated by the local chief. As a result, plots are small, uneconomic, scattered, and often distant from the family home.

Because the chiefs are the backbone of the ruling Transkei National Independence Party, the laws are not likely to be changed. Transkei thus has realized little of its agricultural potential. Nearly 80 percent of the people practice subsistence agriculture. Only one-fourth of the arable land is cultivated, and the homeland produces only one-third of its food needs. Most of the remaining land is used for grazing. Cattle are kept primarily as status symbols and insurance for hard times, and are a cause of overgrazing and soil erosion. In 1976, for example, fewer than 1 percent of the cattle were slaughtered, compared with about 20 percent for white South Africa. There are only about 50,000 wage-earning jobs in Transkei, and many of these are in the government. Few people in Transkei can commute to jobs while living in the homeland because economic activity in nearby areas of South Africa is limited. Consequently, most workers migrate to distant cities, especially East London and Cape Town South Africa pays for three-fourths of the Transkei budget. In addition, it exerts indirect control through seconded South African advisers, who hold key positions in various ministries and the Transkei army. The area that is now Transkei was annexed by Cape Colony in 1894. Whites maintained jurisdiction until the early 1950s, when they started giving more responsibility to local people. Self-government was granted in 1963. In 1974, the Legislative Assembly requested \"independence\" from Pretoria, which was granted on 26 October 1976. Transkei's \"independence\" did not proceed as planned by President Matanzima. Pretoria reneged on its agreement that the Transkei people would remain citizens of South Africa. In addition, Pretoria decided that there would be two separate Xhosa homelands?Transkei and Ciskei?because whites in the corridor between the two areas feared that otherwise they would be removed from their land. Matanzima's Transkei National Independence Party (TNIP) won 68 of 75 contested seats in a Legislative Assembly election in 1976. However, the Matan- zima government's imprisonment of the leader of the opposition Transkei Demo- cratic Party just before the election, the government's appointment of traditional chiefs to over half the seats, and the low voter turnout of 43 percent gave the vic- tory a hollow ring. Within a year legislation had been passed that defined any op- position to the government or any open suggestions that Transkei was not truly in- dependent as treasonable offenses. Opposition leaders soon began fleeing to Lesotho to request political asylum President Matanzima, anxious to appear decisive after he had repeatedly tried to acquire more land from South Africa with no results, took a bold step in 1978 by Secret 44 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/01/19: CIA-RDP84500552R000100020002-6 25X1 25X1 25X1 25X1 25X1 II 25X1 25X1 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/01/19: CIA-RDP84500552R000100020002-6 Secret Transkei. Dry, treeless land- scape, useful primarily for cat- tle grazing breaking diplomatic relations with Pretoria over the issue. Nonetheless, trade representatives were quickly exchanged with full diplomatic immunity, and Matanzima restored full diplomatic relations within two years. In addition to suppressing opposition by arbitrary arrests and detentions and passing legislation restricting the press and personal freedom of speech, the Matanzima brothers have used their positions to enrich themselves financially. To further reinforce his position, President Matanzima has increased the power, pay, and privileges of the chiefs, who make up half of the Legislative Assembly. According to the Embassy, the chiefs see Matanzima as their benefactor and support him on all issues. The Embassy describes the Matanzima brothers as feared rather than admired by most of the population. The Transkei Government in November 1979 banned 34 organizations, including the African National Congress (ANC), the Pan-African Congress (PAC), and all Black Consciousness organizations. The list of banned organizations virtually duplicated Pretoria's list. Detentions of many leaders of the opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) effectively eliminated that party by 1980. Transkei's 800-man defense force virtually collapsed when South African advisers were pulled out after diplomatic relations were severed in 1978. Even before this, however, the force had been capable only of ceremonial functions and limited operational duties. Matanzima fired the force's Transkeian commander in 1981 and replaced him with a white former Rhodesian officer. Today the force is trained and led by hired whites and funded largely by Pretoria. 45 Secret Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/01/19: CIA-RDP84500552R000100020002-6 25X1 25X1 25X1 25X1 25X1 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/01/19: CIA-RDP84500552R000100020002-6 Secret Leader Secret Kaiser Daliwonga Matanzima has dominated the politics of Transkei since 1976, when South Africa granted the homeland \"independence.\" He served as Trans- kei's Prime Minister from 1976 until he assumed the presidency in 1979. According to US Consular officials in Durban, Matanzima rules with little restraint through a docile National Assembly and an inner circle of traditional tribal chiefs. Generally feared by the people, Matanzima has imposed laws that make it a crime to criticize the homeland's president or its government, and he has moved swiftly to arrest Transkeian critics of his regime. Black and white South African critics of Matanzima have compared his harsh regime to that of South Af- rica. These same _critics have called him a puppet of Pretoria, partly because he spearheaded the effort in the mid-1970s to convince the Transkei regime to accept South Africa's offer of \"independence.\" According to US Consular reporting, Matanzima recognizes his dependence on Pretoria and has, therefore, generally accommodated South African wishes. Matanzima's younger brother, George, is Transkei's Prime Minister. Matanzima was born on 15 June 1915. After receiving a B.A. degree in law and politics in 1939 from the University of Fort Hare, Matanzima began his political career. In 1940, he became chief of the Tembe people?a subgroup of the Xhosa tribe. He passed the Transvaal bar exam in 1948 and was elected Chief Minister of Transkei in 1963. Matanzima has been divorced twice. He and his present wife have several children. 46 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/01/19: CIA-RDP84500552R000100020002-6 1 2iX1 25X1 ?

Its isolation has hindered the development of industry and ensured a high rate of emigration to white South Africa and a heavy dependence on subsistence agriculture. In addition, Venda's unpopular President Patrick Mphephu has used a variety of tactics to suppress both real and imagined political opponents. 25X1 The Venda tribal group is linguistically related to the Shona of Zimbabwe and the Sotho of the northern Transvaal. The Venda first moved into the area from Zimbabwe in about 1700. Contact with whites began in 1836, but it was not until the early 20th century, "
