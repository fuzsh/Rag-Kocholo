I headed up one of the previously anti-apartheid private schools St Marks's College then affiliated with (ISASA).\n\nI was the only white man in the area. We all went to the same shops, same doctors, same whatever. My friends group consisted of only black people. I then went to Giyani.\n\nThe capital of the old Gazankulu to lead a school there. In both setting the uneducated people were targeted by the ANC.\n\nThey would physically go from house to house to gain votes. These are illiterate people who do not even speak a word of English. They have no idea what they are about to sign up for.\n\nWhen you live in poverty (and NOTHING has changed in 20 years for some of them) do you seriously still believe it's Apartheid's fault?\n\nThis was dished out in rural Limpopo a few year back and from my interactions with the people there NOTHING has changed.\n\nAs long as we keep the uninformed electorate uninformed we are KING! I tried to throw my weight behind what I thought was a good cause...\n\nIf only the marginalized people in the most rural villages in our countries could understand the level of corruption and that you their \"leaders\" don't give a shit about them..."
