        "text": "On a Tuesday evening in 1970, my neighbor Kenny and I arrived at Petaluma’s State Theater to change the marquee. The movie house ran two feature films a week, changing them every Wednesday. While Kenny took down the marquee for “Funny Girl,” starring Barbra Streisand, I began assembling letters for a new Swedish film, “I Am Curious (Yellow),” along with the letters for “X-RATED.”\n\nIt wasn’t my first X-rated marquee.\n\n“Midnight Cowboy,” the story of a male prostitute and an ailing con man, had played in town a few months earlier. Starring Jon Voight and Dustin Hoffman, it went on to be the first X-rated film to win an Oscar.\n\nI was 15 at the time, and Kenny was 17, meaning we weren’t allowed in to see “I Am Curious (Yellow),” but plenty of others were. The film ran at the State (today’s Mystic Theater) for an unprecedented six weeks. Nationally, it became the highest grossing foreign film of all time, helping to usher in a “Golden Age of Porn,” and setting a new bar for X ratings — “Midnight Cowboy” was downgraded to an R rating without a single frame being cut.\n\nPrior to “I Am Curious (Yellow),” screenings of “blue” or “stag” movies in Petaluma were largely restricted to old reel-to-reel projectors set up in the back rooms of fraternal orders. That changed with elimination of the Hays Code.\n\nThe Hays Code was a set of strict moral guidelines imposed in the 1930s, when the film industry was desperately trying to lure Depression-era audiences back into theaters with depictions of sex and violence. The code sought to curb the display of such unwholesome acts.\n\nThe scenario repeated itself in the 1960s as the rising popularity of television began to cut into theater attendance. This time, the movie industry reversed itself, dispensing with the Hays Code and adopted the film rating system we know today, which allowed audiences to police themselves and their children when it came to film content.\n\nFor theaters, the new ratings provided an exclusive niche of R- and X-rated films that network television was prohibited from broadcasting (the X rating was changed to NC-17 in 1990).\n\nAfter the success of “I Am Curious (Yellow),” the State’s owner, Alan Finlay, began rotating X-rated films into the theater’s schedule one week per month. He did the same at the Parkway, the drive-in theater he owned at the north end of town beside the freeway in Denman Flats (today’s Petaluma Golf Center). The Midway, a new drive-in theater along the freeway south of town, soon followed.\n\nThe three theaters not only made Petaluma the sole California city north of San Francisco showing porn, but the only city in the Bay Area doing so outdoors. The Midway’s screen faced the freeway, providing northbound drivers with a full view as they passed by. The screen at the Parkway had its back to the freeway but looked toward Stony Point Road, a rural lane lined with parked cars during X-rated showings.\n\nOutraged parents and religious leaders appealed to city hall to shut down adult films at the drive-ins, arguing they were creating safety hazards for distracted drivers and also were being viewed by underage teenagers sneaking into the drive-ins hidden in the trunks of cars. In response, police increased their patrols of the drive-ins during the showing of X-rated films.\n\nBy fall 1972, the State, Parkway, and Midway were all predominantly running softcore and hardcore adult films, the distinction being whether the sex was simulated or real. Screenings drew customers from hours away by car, earning Petaluma a reputation as the “Hardcore Capital of the North Bay.”\n\nThat Christmas season, Finlay decided to up the ante by screening “Deep Throat” at the State.\n\nAmong the first hardcore pornographic films to feature relatively high production values with both plot and character development, “Deep Throat” became an instant sensation around the country, drawing half of its audience from middle-class couples on dates or else married, and ushering in a new genre the New York Times dubbed “porno chic.”\n\nThe most popular movie to ever play Petaluma, “Deep Throat” ran for 28 consecutive weeks at the State until obscenity charges were filed against Finlay in May 1973. Kenny, who had turned 20, was working as the projectionist the evening police came to confiscate the film.\n\nFinlay immediately replaced “Deep Throat” with another hardcore hit, “Behind the Green Door,” which police returned to confiscate. The defiant Finlay started screening a second copy of “Behind the Green Door,” which police also came for. The district attorney charged Finlay with exhibiting obscene matter and “assisting persons (actors) to expose themselves.” In his filing, the district attorney denounced the screening of “Deep Throat” as “Sodom and Gomorrah gone wild before the fire.”\n\nIn June, the Petaluma City Council passed an ordinance prohibiting films with “explicit sexual materials” from being shown at drive-in theaters. Legal counsel advised them to steer clear of the word “pornography,” as it was not a legally defined term. That put an end to X-rated films at the Parkway, which was within city limits, but not the Midway, which was outside of them. County supervisors quickly passed a similar ordinance, shutting down the Midway’s screenings.\n\nA few weeks later, the U.S. Supreme Court issued its landmark ruling defining obscenity as based in part on community standards. Petaluma’s case against Finlay was one of the first in the wake of the ruling, bringing national attention to the city.\n\nIntended to give local communities more agency in applying their own moral standards, the ruling actually undermined Petaluma’s case against Finlay. After hearing arguments from both sides, local Circuit Judge Alexander McMahon dismissed the jury, ruling that, in line with the new Supreme Court decision, the prosecution had failed to present evidence of a community standard regarding obscenity.\n\nFinlay returned to showing “Deep Throat” at the State following the trial, running it continuously through 1974, and then periodically until mid-1976. Contrary to local lore, the State did not set the record for the longest showing of the film — that honor went to the Pussycat Theater in Hollywood, which ran “Deep Throat” for 10 years.\n\nIn the late ‘70s, Finlay left Petaluma’s theater business. The new owners of the State transformed it into a repertory theater featuring art-house and foreign films, and renamed it the Plaza. The Parkway resorted to screening popular second-run feature films, and the Midway (renamed the Sonomarin) exclusively ran X-rated films.\n\nAs the growing popularity of video rentals and cable television in the 1980s further eroded theater attendance, theater operators shifted to multiplexes, placing many screens under one roof to provide customers with more viewing options and making single-screen venues obsolete.\n\nThe State became the live music venue now known as the Mystic, the Parkway was converted to a golf driving range and the Midway/Sonomarin, its X-rated niche undermined by home video, was purchased by the state of California for use as a flood control reservoir.\n\nFor those like Kenny and me, who came of age during the Golden Age of Porn, Petaluma’s reign as the “Hardcore Capital of the North Bay” left an indelible mark. As our former boss Finlay proudly noted, “‘Deep Throat’ put this city on the map.”"
