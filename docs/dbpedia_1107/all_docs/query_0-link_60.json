        "text": "\"But he [Schrader] works with speed and intelligence, paying sharp attention to detail and making the movie as funny as it is quick and frightening.” - New York Times\n\nDirected by Paul Schrader\n\nThe sacred and the profane clash when a Calvinist patriarch (George C. Scott) journeys from Grand Rapids to California in search of a daughter who’s become enmeshed in the world of pornography. Writer-director Paul Schrader, raised in a strict Calvinist home himself, has described Hardcore as his film about his father and the film seethes with an array of personal themes and obsessions from the nature of sin and the redemptive power of violence.\n\nColumbia Pictures. Producer: John Milius, Buzz Feitshans. Screenwriter: Paul Schrader. Cinematographer: Michael Chapman. Editor: Tom Rolf. Cast: George C. Scott, Peter Boyle, Season Hubley, Dick Sargent, Leonard Gaines.\n\n35mm, color, 109 min.\n\nWatch the trailer below.\n\nDirected by Paul Schrader\n\nWriter-director Paul Schrader returns to the working class, midwestern milieu of Blue Collar (1978) and Hardcore (1979) for one of his most personal films in which a brother and sister struggle to find their own identities under the disapproving glare of their domineering mother (Gena Rowlands). Joan Jett brings grit to the role of black sheep daughter Patti, a single mom and the lead singer of a bar band with dreams of becoming a rock star.\n\nTriStar Pictures.
