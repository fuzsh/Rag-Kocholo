        "text": "Puttin’ on the Ritz\n\nBad Brains frontman H.R. onstage in New York at the Ritz, which is now known as Webster Hall. “They were the best live band,” says Smith. “I know everyone says that, but it’s true. They were so amazing, so tight. I never saw a frontman like H.R. He would do the unexpected. When the music was going really fast and people were jumping all over the place, he’d go completely still. He had a way of containing the energy, and then dispersing it.”\n\nSweater Song\n\nSmith was usually the one holding the camera, so this is one of the few photos she has in her collection of herself. She’s outside of CBGB on the Bowery. “We had a hair crimper,” she says. “It was really hard to get [my hair] to stay blue when I dyed it — it would always turn green. Also, I really miss that sweater I’m wearing. I wore it most every day. It seemed like it had things living in it.”\n\nSweaty Front\n\nAgnostic Front at CBGB on June 29, 1985. “I was on stage when I took this,” says Smith. “You can see Roger [Miret]’s face as he’s climbing back onto the stage. Notice that the ass of the bouncer is all wet. That’s just sweat. We all knew that guy. He kept on eye on us. If anyone was in trouble in the pit, he’d grab them.”\n\nSquatter’s Rights\n\nHardcore scenester Olivia Larrain checks out an abandoned seltzer factory on Second Street between Avenues B and C with her buddy English Mark. “We heard it might be a viable squat,” says Smith. “When we got there, we realized it wasn’t. I did find a gorgeous blue bottle in there that I have to this day.”\n\nShow You No Mercy\n\nCro-Mags frontman Harley Flanagan onstage at Irving Plaza in 1985. “These guys were really hard and tough,” says Smith. “I think I was in a little bit of denial then, and even now, about the violence that was around the scene, but I remember feeling safe when I was with the Cro-Mags. Also, they were getting into the Hare Krishna thing. If you look at this photo, you can see he’s wearing Krishna beads.”\n\nLady Madonna\n\nMadonna Powers and son Eamonn outside CBGB. Madonna sang in the band Modern Clix. “We used to watch Eamonn when they went onstage,” says Smith. “She’s the most gentle, nicest person.” Her name, however, caused more than a little confusion. “Somebody once overheard us call her Madonna,” says Smith. “And she said, ‘You fucked my boyfriend on the roof!’ She goes, ‘No, wrong Madonna.'”\n\nAmerican Made\n\nSmith snapped this photo of Murphy’s Law/Cro-Mags drummer Pete Hines (right) outside of CBGB next to a guy she doesn’t remember. “Everyone was just starting to get their tattoos,” she says. “That ‘American Made 1966’ tattoo of the man on the left just means that he was born in America in 1966. It feels not only very American to me, but very New York.”\n\nAbsolutely Absolution\n\nDjinji Brown, son of revered jazz alto saxophonist Marion Brown, at CBGB with his group Absolution. “He was one of the few people of color that was a part of that scene,” says Smith. “I like this picture because it shows that there’s no separation between the band and the audience.”\n\nBowery Warzone\n\nCro-Mags/Murphy’s Law drummer Pete Hines (center) with Brad Davis of Warzone. “I just love this photo since you can see the Bleecker Street sign, so you know where you are and CB’s is clearly to the left,” says Smith. “I think Pete was about to play a show since he’s not sweaty yet. I just can’t believe how young they all look.”\n\nBlur\n\nIt’s impossible to tell from the photo, but this is Cro-Mags at CBGB. “This happened to me all the time,” says Smith. “It was so frustrating, but it was low light/fast action. I actually developed this one. I put this in there since it seemed to catch the action, the physicality of it. I felt this somehow got into that.”\n\nStraight-Edge Love Story\n\nAn intimate moment between Tommy Carroll, lead singer of straight-edge hardcore band Straight Ahead, and his girlfriend at the time, Alexa Poli. “Alexa was my roommate and was definitely not straight-edge,” says Smith. “She liked to turn the straight-edge boys, and I think she turned Tommy. But it was a real love story between the two of them. They had a baby not long after this.”\n\nPark Life\n\nIt’s just a ten-minute walk from CBGB to Tompkins Square Park. “There used to be a bandshell there,” says Smith. “We were all there for a show, just hanging out. That was our place. Those were our benches. We’d hang out with the homeless people that lived in the park. We’d have bonfires with garbage cans. The cops really didn’t go east of Avenue A. It felt like if you were east of A, you could do what you wanted.”\n\nUnderdog Is Here\n\nUnderdog frontman Carl Demola sings before a typically wild pit as bouncer Big Charlie (in the red football uniform) surveys the chaos. “We’d be covered in sweat and just soaked through,” says Smith. “It was like a Bikram Yoga class. I just remember hugging people, not caring, being all gross and disgusting.”\n\nSunday Matinee\n\nSmith named her book after the all-ages Sunday shows that were regularly held at CBGB. “There would usually be three or four bands,” she says. “It was the birth of the whole hardcore scene that was happening there.”\n\nNegativland\n\nSmith put her photos in boxes and didn’t think about them for decades, but they remained in pristine condition. “I guess that’s a testament to film,” she says. “They were all in envelopes just hidden away. What’s going to happen to all our digital stuff, though? I go on and it says, ‘You have 30,984 photos.’ It’s just too much.”"
