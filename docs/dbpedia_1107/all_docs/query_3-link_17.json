Members can post ONE image in this thread per week for critique by any member of the hardcore street photography group.\n\n2. It can be an image that has been deleted from the group, or just an image that you really like and want some feedback on.\n\n3. be thick skinned. take on board the criticism and advice, and go shoot better!!\n\nand thats about it. if you post more than one image per week, your post will be deleted. if people persist in posting more than one image per week then i'll just lock the thread.\n\nAs I have already mentioned, admins do have lives outside of flickr, so other members feel free to add your critique if you think you have something valuable to say. there is a vast amount of knowledge within our numbers so lets hear your opinions.\n\nlooking forward to the first brave soul to post an image....\n\n10:08AM, 2 July 2006 PDT\n\nbenroberts says:\n\nVIDALIA - not my deletion by the way... but anyway...\n\nokay - first of all purely technical critique:\n\nneeds a good crop - the black beam down the right hand side is annoying, as are the fragments of a parking meter on the left hand side.\n\nnow for some more contextual critique:\n\n- despite them being on moving 'vehicles' this is a very static image - there's precious little going on that keeps the viewer interested apart from some big novelty toys.\n\n- there is an overall flatness to the image - look at some of the admin favs - there is often some kind of light/shadow dynamic going on that adds vigour and depth to the image. this doesn't have that. think about the time of day that you are shooting - mornings and evenings offer the dynamic horizontal light that is the street photographers mobile studio...\n\n- finally, i don't think i am being too harsh here, but maybe the context that you bestowed upon the image in your stream isn't in the spirit of 'street photography' - you've presented them in your stream as 'nerds' - a freak show. i think the spirit of street photography is to observe what is going on and try to depict it in an original way.. look at the great street photographers - are their images derogatory? its far more likely that the images that you remember celebrate oddities instead of sneering at them....\n\nwhat i am saying is, yeah, they're odd, i can and will laugh with you cos goddam it they're lazy! I'm with you 100% when it comes to that!\n\nbut on a purely photographic basis, a 'street photographer' would steer clear of the obvious route of 'ridiculing the absurd'. instead he/she would try and find some way of celebrating it.\n\nhope thats useful...\n\nOriginally posted ages ago.\n\nbenroberts edited this topic ages ago.\n\nbenroberts says:\n\nIREES\n\nyou've pretty much said all i would have said.\n\nas for 'value added' context - i'm sorry, but for me thats just a completely ridiculous concept.\n\nif a documentary story (lets take for instance, ooh, relocated victims of hurrican katrina) can't be told in a sinlge image, it's forgivable. its a big story! however... when i look at your stream i don't see a single other image documenting this story... so to try to raise the quality of an image whose limitations you are very aware of by bestowing on it a context of which you had no idea when you took the photo... it kind of smacks of desperation. that's my point of view, and, without wanting to sound like a pompous git, (although i probably am) i reckon its valid because i am a professional documentary photographer. I want to see a story told by pictures. if i am looking at a photo documentary, i want beautiful, descriptive, high quality photos that tell me part of the story but also spark my imagination to think of another 100 related stories and scenarios that are merely hypothetical possibilities of my imagination... thats how powerful a photo can be, and what i strive to achieve when i shoot my personal documentary stories and portraits. i know i'm not achieving that on every negative, but i'm sure as hell going to try..\n\nhowever, thats probably not the reason this image has been deleted. it was most likely for the technical reasons that you have already mentioned - poor framing, telephoto giving that uniquely one-dimensional feel, lack of interesting post-processing. this image for me is an example of why the street photographer has to get in close for this kind of shot - without doing so you're just not going to capture the energy and interesting composition that you are striving for.\n\nwell i hope thats useful too...\n\nages ago\n\nbenroberts says:\n\noceanhug -\n\ntechnically:\n\n- it needs a crop. the black corner in the top right, and the burnt out light in the top right need to go. i'd also get rid of the bottle and whatever else that is in the bottom right of the photo. by leaving them in, all you've made me do is think 'the person who took that photograph didn't really think about how he was framing the image'.\n\nthis single thought for me immediately overpowers anything else about the image.\n\na tutor when i was at college said something really useful to me once - this was that for an art director, picture editor, or realistically anyone in the professional photography industry to consider the subject and story in an image, the image itself must technically be of a certain quality before the context can come into play. i fully agree with this, and in the case of your image, i find it hard to force myself to look beyond these three intrusions into the frame.\n\nokay so in my mind i am hiding these aforementioned intrusions, and what have i got? well realistically it's a kind of shoddy sculpture (a poor mans Louis Bourgeois) thats partially hiding a mans head. again, its just too static. there is no dramatic lighting to give atmosphere. the guy in the picture isn't interacting with the sculpture in an exciting, interesting way.\n\na number of photographers have tackled this subject of people in a gallery space, and i'd be surprised if our admins didn't know of them. i am suspecting that your image might have been judged against these photographers...\n\nhave a look at this link:\n\nwww.nickturpin.com/bigfolio/tate.html\n\nages ago\n\nbenroberts says:\n\nOPENDOOREXIT\n\nyou're right, i think this shot has potential, and can be classed as a near miss. there's lots of good bits - i like the flare on the stone surface that he is sitting on, i like the dull reflections in the shiny surface behind the guy sitting down, and it has some interesting compositional lines - i think i can see how you are trying to make them work, but its not quite right.\n\nwhen i looked at the photo in your stream and in full size, there was a suggested crop - i was thinking somewhere along those lines when i first looked at the image, but i think to be honest cropping this image isn't going to be enough.\n\nso i guess the best thing to do is sign it off as one of those things and think about how you would go about shooting this kind of image next time.\n\nso this ain't a question of technical stuff, more a question of composition and perhaps stealth technique. if i came across this situation when on a streetwalk, if i knew i wanted to photograph it the first thing i would do is not to rush it. my point being, lets face it he doesn't look like he is going anywhere in a hurry, so it's not like i have only one millisecond to take the photo.\n\nthe fact that he is a rather static subject also throws up a few problems - as i have mentioned on previous images, a static image can quite often be boring one. however in this case there are lots of geometric shapes and interesting environmental features that, together with the guy, could make up for this.\n\nso i would stand where i presume you are, on the other side of the road, and think about how i want the image to look. perhaps frame it with my hands or something. then i think it would be a case of getting in close. its just got to be done. i think it would be possible to walk out to the middle of the road, stop, take the photo, turn around and walk away in a moment if you really know what you want in the frame. sure the guy might see you, but hell thats the street photographers risk right?\n\ni've put a suggested crop on your image - i think there is currently too much in the frame that detracts from the guy in the middle. for me thats why this would have been removed. get in close. its scary... it makes your heart thump... but it makes for great shots...\n\nages ago\n\nwools says:\n\nbenny,\n\nOf course I know to get in close; that's the only shot over 50mm in my entire filckr gallery. However, it was the only way I would have been able to even attempt the shot. As was mentioned in a previous discussion thread, photographing children is a very difficult proposition. The cop just outside the frame was already looking at my suspiciously. There are no other photos of the event in my stream because this was a chance encounter, not a project I embarked on intentionally; they left on the trolley immediately after I took the picture. And I was aware they were evacuees when I took the photo. \"A few weeks after the event\" was after Katrina, not after the photograph was taken. Sorry for the ambiguity, I was being rushed out of the house when I wrote the post. And yeah, you may be a pompous git, but I suppose that's alright. If you asked my opinion on something I was professionally inclined in, I'd probably be harsh too. It's an underrated quality.\n\nFor the record, during the actual height of Katrina I desperately wanted to go shoot.. unfortunately, I was desperately studying for a major grad school exam... sigh. By the time I could dedicate an entire day to photography, most of the madness had cooled down a bit.\n\nOriginally posted ages ago.\n\nwools edited this topic ages ago.\n\nbenroberts says:\n\nGULCH\n\ni think it's safe to say that as a whole, this group suffers from an over abundance of 'sidewalk street photography'.\n\nthis was the opinion of hinius (another admin) - we chatted about this today after a round of 'beach street photography'. it would be great if more people didn't take the 'street' part so literally - we would end up with loads more interesting images. people interact everywhere - clubs, museums, discos, libraries, brothels.... so why not shoot 'street style' in these places?\n\nthe reality is that the sidewalk is a quite awkward place to shoot street. there's a lack of interesting angles. the people are generally walking in two directions. and one whole side of your frame can often be just traffic. so go looking people - look for open public spaces, look for alleyways, parks, squares, corners, parties, etc etc. just try and retain your integrity - shoot strangers, not buddies!\n\nso gulch - moving onto your image. despite what you've said about technical quality not being the most important part of the jigsaw, the fact remains that it is a part of the jigsaw. you're imaging is missing this piece, and in my opinion in this particular piece you are missing is quite an important one, like an edge or a corner or summat!\n\njust imagine if you'd removed a bit of that strange red cast, straightened up those vertical lines in the foreground, and.... my god... got rid of all that ridiculous, horrible NOISE!!! did you shoot this in a blizzard? grain in film is totally acceptable, and i really really hate those supergloss porcelain doll noise reduced digital images... however this amount of weird, pixelated noisy nonsense reduces what is a wonderfully caught moment to a fuzzy mess.\n\ndo something about that mate, and i honestly believe that with your eye for an image (in this instant anyway) you'll really be onto a winner.\n\nages ago\n\nbenroberts says:\n\nKONIAK\n\nfirst of all, good on for you for taking those first steps into the world of street photography, and picking up the nerve to raise the camera to your face.\n\nas for this image. my chat with hinius was wide ranging today. we discussed what we would change about street photography if we could. just one thing. i said that i would get rid of all the fucking mobile phones! it's pretty hard to get an interesting shot when someones chatting on a cellphone...\n\nAs for this image... i'm really sorry.. but it's just, well, a little bit dull... there's nothing going on. for a portrait (posed or candid) to make it past the admins in this group its got to be pretty special, because portraits aren't really what 'street photography' (in the eyes of this groups admins) is all about. it's not because we don't like portraits. I am a documentary portrait photographer. i.e i shoot documentary stories with portraits as the main thrust. i shoot street for fun and to keep my eye trained.\n\nwhat would make a portrait 'special' enough to be kept in this pool? I'm not sure, but i guess it would have to be something really, really exceptional about the person who is being immortalised... so that pretty much rules out every homeless person, most outrageous gay pride marchers, and unfortunately for you most oriental ladies talking on their cellphones.\n\nas a rule of thumb i try not to 'fall in love' with my shots. if you love everything you do, where is the room for improvement? okay so this image didn't get in the pool. next time you are out shooting, try looking for something thats out of the ordinary, like a tiny oriental lady walking 5 alsatians, or oriental sextuplets talking on cellphones in a line for a jewish bakery. okay so i'm being a bit over the top but you get my gist right? keep those eyes open....\n\nages ago\n\nNoshitthereiwas says:\n\nSLP 2.0 - I think these scenes are really hard to get right. There's drama there, but it feels like you've either got to get in rrreal close to get the emotion on the faces, or you've got to compose the shot so that energy's pushing out of the frame, or so that the arrangement of the figures forms a compelling composition in its own right. This doesn't have that PJ feel - there's no tension to speak of, and I feel too distant from the people to pick up on their emotions, so I think what you have here is a snap of a stranger in a humiliating position. Might also have worked if you'd come at it from the perspective of the caregiver's - e.g., looking over their shoulders / along their arms so that the viewer identifies with a person in the frame. But ya gotta find a composition in there. Just my $0.02.\n\nages ago\n\n62Lofu says:\n\nOK, I'm curious. I posted this to the group before and it got elbowed immediately. (OK - I realise I have no divine right to acceptance here).\n\nJust wondered what's up with this - I figure it hits the spot: it's shot in the street, short lens, B&W, interesting subject. Plus the risk factor of photographing PLA personnel in Tiannenmen Square. People get arrested for stuff like that. Plus, it's one of MY favourite street shots, sniff, sniff...\n\nPS: I will continue to launch missiles from my Home in North Korea until I receive an answer.\n\n[PPS: Thanks for the replies, still not sure who hated the shot or why, but for now the missile launches are on hold. A couple of other points. (1) All the soldiers in the photo are Girls not guys. And (2) Although it's relatively unlikely I'd have been arrested for taking this picture, in China it's not adviseable to just walk up to police or PLA personnel and photograph them without their permission - you never know what they'll do. I'm clearly white and Western. Many of my Chinese friends have said they'd NEVER shoot pictures of officials, least of all PLA in Beijing, so it's definitely a judgement call.\n\nOriginally posted ages ago.\n\n62Lofu edited this topic ages ago.\n\nbenroberts says:\n\nhi miss milki... sorry for the lack of response from me too.. other things on my mind, but hey, here i am.\n\nfirst of all if i'm going to be really anal.... i don't think it's chess. looks like its some kind of 'Mah Jong' or other derivative.\n\nagree with raoul about the bikes.\n\nultimately - it's one of those shots for me that it's quite hard to critique. there's not much terribly bad about it - perhaps a little too much dead space at the top of the frame - but on the other hand it's not exciting me all that much. raoul is spot on. get in close and engage with the subjects and maybe you've got something. but it's hard isn't it? i 've been in vietnam myself - invariably if you get in close with your camera to kids on the street then you get that classic 'over reaction' that turns these photos into the same generic 'look at these poor ethnic kids, they're so poor but they're so HAPPY' shot that every clumsy western wannabe national geographic photographer gets.\n\nso maybe next time (if you're fortunate enough to go back?) you could try more of a hit and run approach. sneak in, get the shot, leg it before you break the concentration of those two grandmasters in the making.\n\nthen go and reward yourself with some summer rolls, a cup of coffee with condensed milk, and a hand tailored tuxedo, made in 24hrs for $24.\n\nages ago\n\nmigrant says:\n\n@Andy:\n\nThe first shot is another shot of a homeless guy... why not after all, I like some of them... sometimes...\n\nHowever, the bike is a really obvious part of the image and I don't see what's interesting about the association between the bike and the guy and the floor. It doesn't add to the geometry of the shot either. In brief, I don't really \"understand\" the picture.\n\nThe second shot, I remember deleting it myself mainly because of the poor focus. I really don't mind hip shots and even quite like them but this one was too obvious in a way that the focus and the framing seem approximative for me.\n\nCongrats on the A though... working on a sequel of \"The Americans\"? ;-)\n\nAgain, this was my opinion, for what it's worth... be aware that I never got any A in a photo class.\n\nOriginally posted ages ago.\n\nmigrant edited this topic ages ago.\n\nNoshitthereiwas says:\n\n62lofu: ok i confess, it was me who deleted your shot. for what it's worth it took me a long to make up my mind - i actually like the shot. as migrant says, the composition is good, and it's technically good. but i still felt something was missing for this forum - hard to say what, but in the absence of obvious tension, the composition just wasn't quite strong enough to swing it for me. maybe it was because, outside of the fact that one person in uniform was shooting 2 others, there wasn't much more of interest. and i have to say that, if a shot needs completing with a title or explanation of the content / subject, then the shot's clearly not strong enough to tell its story in its own right, so i noticed that they were female soldiers, but in itself, that wasn't enough.\n\ni do like the mood of the shot, and i've been happy to come across plenty of your other work when editing the stream.\n\nOriginally posted ages ago.\n\nNoshitthereiwas edited this topic ages ago.\n\neyeblink says:\n\nBullet eye-\n\nFor me there is a lot going on and nothing going on in this picture at the same time. To be a little brief and blunt at the same time you are to far away, shaky and the color is washed out. The two oo's in the upper right corner are distracting me from what your trying to photograph. I keep looking at that and not much else. Plus the person on the far left is obsolete. He keeps disapearing from my sight which for me means he should've been cropped out to begin with. Contrast wise it's a very flat image which makes it look smushy and two dimensional.\n\nI think I see why you liked the scene though. A seemingly normal woman talking with a seemingly down on her luck woman. It could've made for an interesting and colorful photograph if you had actually gone over there to photograph them. Next time you see something like this you'll want to try and frame them tighter. You should try walking past them and as you do so raise your camera to you're eye, look at them and \"snap\". That would have eliminated so much of what is distracting in this picture.\n\nKeep shooting and thanks for posting\n\nOriginally posted ages ago.\n\neyeblink edited this topic ages ago.\n\nmigrant says:\n\n@Clark:\n\nI deleted the pic, so I'm gonna try to explain why.\n\nFirst, it is not a matter of knowing the place or not, I'm from Paris and used to live in the 13eme.\n\nI think this pic is good from a Photojournalism point of view but I don't really think it qualifies as street.\n\nI don't really like to have to read a whole text explaining what the picture is about unless I am reading an article about this exhibition and your picture is illustrating it.\n\nThe composition isn't really exciting to me. It is just people looking at pictures on a fence, there is not \"interaction\" between those people and the pics.\n\nI'm gonna give really bad examples but it would be better if the old man with the cane was looking at a picture of another old man with a cane or a very young guy jumping in the air (I know, bad examples, but I hope you get the idea). If he was, in some way, part of the picture.\n\nI do think it is quite difficult to take good picture of people looking at pictures/art. Some do it very well though, Hinius has a few really good ones and again, Trent Park also.\n\nHope that helps. Again, I am just an arrogant self-taught photographer, so don't listen to me and keep shooting.\n\nOh! and @John gladdy:\n\nFor me, the post processing is too much and doesn't help me make sense of what's happening in the pic.\n\nOriginally posted ages ago.\n\nmigrant edited this topic ages ago.\n\nJim O'Connell says:\n\n@john_gladdy(AKa 47)\n\nYou got a bit cynical there, but you offered up the photo as it is, with no defense. Let me try to look at it objectively.\n\nI think, there's a good picture in there somewhere. The oval form of the two men's shoulders has some good appeal. It has a nice fluidity to it, but the killer problem is that it looks too heavily processed.\n\nWhy have you kicked up the contrast so much?\n\nAre you going for a look that you think fits the subject more? Kind of a bête noir 1940's feeling? If that's it, I'd say you strayed too far into resembling graphic arts of the period and less like photography from then.\n\nI'd really like to see something closer to the original with this one - as I said, I think there's a good photo under there somewhere.\n\nages ago\n\nmigrant says:\n\nWhat Ben said.\n\nI am happy to give my opinion if people ask for it but I never pretended that my opinion was the right one, far from that. It just is mine.\n\nIf you don't want to hear it, I really understand that because I'm not sure it is worth anything; but then don't post your pic here, please.\n\nWe just like to talk about pictures and street photography in this group. We think doing so could help everybody (and the admins first) take more interesting pics instead of just having a dead group full of laim images.\n\nThe idea of community and exchange is important in this group but we like to talk with people that don't get upset at the first critique.\n\nCheers and relax, it's just photos.\n\nRaoul\n\nages ago\n\norganic bulb [deleted] says:\n\nYou Guys are kinda right and i really shouldnt bait like that( note to self).\n\nI apologise.\n\nI guess i got on my horse because, to me, street, or any, photography is about interpreting a fleeting moment in as artistic a way as possible. And NOT about having a full tonal range mapped, or having the \"correct\" look about it and definately not about trying to emulate a particular style. every shot dictates its own treatment subjectively by the artist. Taking precise perfectly exposed images is , lets face it, a piece of piss. especially with todays equipment and while this is occasionally(reportage, etc..) adequate to convey the artists vision satisfactoriy, most times a treatment of some form suggests itself no? Also there is the problem of digital being WAY to clean. Stick a zeiss T series on a 5d, shoot at 50 asa and youll see what i mean. great great image quality/sharpness/colour fidelity blah blah......but..no soul/same as everyone elses pictures. The dudes of old sat in their little darkrooms for ever dodging and burning and god knows what else to get \"The Look\" that defined their vision. They also had 70 odd years of film stock development that gave them a massive choice of base look to start with. With digital we must post proccess the image or we cannot hope to achieve any stamp of originality in our work over and above the original composition.\n\n: subject/available light/shooting position dictates framing\n\n: framing/artists vision, feel dictates treatment\n\n: treatment/printing, display media dictates finished pieces \"look\"\n\n: hopefully that \"look\" gets somewhere near \"ART\"\n\nAnyway\n\nJim: The reason it has so much contrast is that is how i felt it needed to be. The figure on the left has a slightly menacing vibe about him(you had to be there), but looks quite contemporary. The other dude Rides a 40's harley, dresses like an extra from some brando/cagney movie of old and sells designer 'retro wear' on portobello market.\n\nSo I felt a look that encompassed that whole vibe was the way to go.\n\nThe Full range from 0-255 is mapped onto this image, but i purposely then pushed the black levels about 15-20 and stuck 12% yellow into the white. It had a basic tri-x clone on it. A Bleach bypass and then some heavy grain added(all in the digital domain, obviously) Lightjetted up at 20x16 inches it looks KILLER. As it does on a barco or similar.\n\nOnce again sorry for the sniping.\n\nages ago\n\norganic bulb [deleted] says:\n\nCool! its just as well that this overproccessed, non-film stuff sells for a grand a pop as i would have to either\n\na: do wedding photography(in which case i would take up plumbing)\n\nor\n\nB: lecture (those who cant etc..)\n\nYou admins all have VERY nice pictures(irees especially speak of lots and lots of fruitful college), but i think the deskjob comment in an earlier thread is valid. photography purely as a job of work is just another form of office work. learning techical excellence and the correct ways of doing something and then doing that instead of what you're meant to do with the information, which is to forget it and go do your own thing, breaking EVERY rule.\n\nI'm glad you still shoot film, everyone who loves photography should\n\nBUT; I have leica r6's contax's a blad and everything in between and NONE of them can best a good Digital SLR(we are talking eos5d d2x upwards here). It is only the lenses that are superior in some senses and adapters are available for all mine to fit.\n\nAnyway...This is fun : ) Keep up the good work\n\nOriginally posted ages ago.\n\norganic bulb edited this topic ages ago.\n\nbenroberts says:\n\n@irees\n\nI think she was waiting for a 'buffalo soldier'.\n\nbut anyway - yeah i can see why you like this image. i like it too, just because it's a bit surreal. obviously you're well aware of where this image is lacking technically, however i think that the other thing that does hold this image back a little bit is the framing, which is a little bit obvious - slap bang in the middle for the main subject.\n\n'is it street' - yeah why not?\n\nwould i delete it from the pool - if theres one thing that i think its good to be as an admin, then its consistent. because of that i think i would delete it. i've already said i find it hard to really love, and read further into an image, when the technical quality is poor, and i would have to apply that to this image. for me this image would be like a trinket or an item of nostalgia - it's fun, and you can look back at it and smile. as you said yourself, you took it long before you were serious about photography. be honest with yourself - how many of your images from 2-3 years ago would you place on a pedestal with what you are shooting now? its good to look back on old work and see progression, and also the roots of the photographer you are now; i'd treat this photograph as a point of reference. and thats about it.\n\ncheers\n\nben\n\nages ago\n\nbenroberts says:\n\n@dce - good image, i like it, probably wouldn't have deleted it. however someone has so c'est la vie...\n\n@dislocatedgerbil - it's a crop to square right? not a big fan of this, i kind of feel like people who do this should by a vintage TLR and just shoot square format. for what it's worth, you need to do more of a crop and get rid of those white vertical edges which just feel a bit weird.\n\napart from that it's an ok shot. i feel like i am saying this a bit too much, but it's another one of those images that is not that bad and not that great. don't take this as a major criticism. it would be asking for miracles for a photographer to produce masterpieces again, and again, and again. it's just not going to happen. if i look back on my last year of shooting, theres probably only 10-15 images (from hundreds) that still make me go 'yeah'. and thats just me. everyone else probably thinks they're bollocks.\n\nif this was to land in the group i probably wouldn't delete it. the guy with the newspaper is pretty cool. but my one thought would be to try and make the most of the frame that your camera gives you to work with. this is a big crop. your camera shoots rectangles. try and utilise that whole frame. don't be lazy and rely on your zoom - make the difference by moving yourself.\n\nages ago\n\nHarrison Reid says:\n\n\"@dislocatedgerbil - it's a crop to square right? not a big fan of this, i kind of feel like people who do this should by a vintage TLR and just shoot square format. for what it's worth, you need to do more of a crop and get rid of those white vertical edges which just feel a bit weird.\"\n\nI cannot afford a vintage TLR at the moment, and this is the first square crop I've done. As for the zoom issue, i took a few shots from about 4 - 5 feet away to the side( www.flickr.com/photos/dislocatedgerbil/184806108/ ), but they didnt turn out as well IMO. Instead, I stood directly across the street on the other pavement and shot at about 40mm on my 350D's kit 18-55 mm lens (hardly a big zoom). Standing closer would have made the guy with the paper notice me, and I probably wouldn't have got the shot.\n\nAll my other photos utilise the whole frame - I dont rely on cropping or post processing to get from a shot what i originally tried to, unless it's not possible at all. I just felt this photo suited the square format as there was a square frame already in the image, and there was nothing going on outside of it.\n\nThanks for all your comments, they are appreciated. If i came off as indignant there, it wasn't intended.\n\n: )\n\nages ago\n\nbenroberts says:\n\nbriefly:\n\nMarja - not bad, but i want the womans eyes to be open, and her to be a bit sharper. not keen on the overall composition - anything of interest is squeezed over to the left of the frame, leaving the right hand side devoid of any interest whatsoever.\n\nChadvw - this is band photography, not street photography.\n\nmdumiao98 - seen this kind of shot done many times before. the perspective is interesting but really thats about it. the one thing that almost makes it work for me is that there is a guy to the left of the groom who is taking a photo back at you; however its not enough. it doesn't excite me.\n\nlachlan - 'chest shot', is really, for me, little different to a hip shot. we all do them sometimes so no great shame in that, however if i think back to my own personal favourite street shots, aprroximately none of them are hip shots. the reality is that if you get a good composition out of a hip shot you are extremely lucky. the problem with this image is the huge expanse of blown out sky that dominates the right hand side of the frame. that, and its all just so static. the guy in the picture is fairly interesting, but mainly because i think he might be a robot. keep on shooting though, and lift that camera to your face. i'm also thinking you might need to be using a faster shutter speed as its pretty soft around the guys face, which is where you would definitely want some sharpness. as we have talked about elsehwere in this group, for us admins, street photography is as much about finding beautiful dynamics of shadow, light and texture as it is about the people in the photo. go find some amazing light; i lived in australia for 10 months and wish i could have the sydney light at my disposal! look at the trent parke thread on our discussion page for some inspiration on how you can shoot street photography in sydney.\n\neduardo - i like this photo, the light is great. try and find some more action though. also post a bigger size image onto your stream, as its pretty hard to judge a photo the size of a large stamp.\n\nages ago"
