        "text": "Amélie is one of my favorite films. I remember when I saw it for the first time. I watched it on a laptop while sitting in an armchair at my parents house. I had borrowed the DVD from the apprentice of a local potter who’s name escapes me now. “Watch this movie” he said. “Its really good.” It blew me away. It did things I had never seen done in a movie before. Granted, I wasn’t really into film at the time, but I still had watched plenty of movies.\n\nOne of the biggest elements of the film that struck me was the visual style. I’m sure I had watched movies with distinctive visual style before. Movies by Tim Burton, Tony Scott, Wes Anderson, Michel Gondry and Terry Gilliam come immediately to mind. But Amélie was the first that made me sit up and take notice. Since then, I’ve watched all Jean-Pierre Jeunets other films and I think I can safely say that the visual style is consistant regardless of what cinematographer, production designer or art director Jeunet uses.\n\nA few observations about Amélie.\n\nAmélie was shot by Bruno Delbonnel on Kodak Vision 250D 5246 and Vision 320T 5277.\n\nAmélie has a very specific color palette. It is a very warm film infused with reds and greens. The color blue is only prominent in only a few shots; so few in fact you can probably count them on one hand. Although much of the color of the film was a result of the DI process (graded by Didier le Foues using Discreet Lustre and supervised by Yvan Lucas) some of the daytime images were shot with a 81EF filter to add some warmth and color. Amélie is also a very well lit film. There are virtually no scenes with complete darkness.\n\nJeunet loves wide angle lenses and putting his characters very close to the camera. Amélie was shot almost entirely using 14, 18, 21, 25 and 27mm lenses. This creates very distorted facial features which works well with his use of actors with unusual features. Jeunet actually used different lenses for different actors doing tests ahead of time to see which lenses worked best for a particular actors facial features. For Tautou they found that the 25 or 27mm lens was just right. Anything longer or shorter didn’t look good. The camera in Amélie is seldom at eye level. It is usually a bit above or below eye level. Combined with the wide angle lenses, a slight tilt up or down can lead to a very dramatic look.\n\nThe use of wide lenses also accomplishes two other things in the film. It creates a very deep depth of field where everything is in focus. I don’t blame him. If I had sets as beautiful and well designed as he does, I’d want them to be in focus all the time too. Basically having everything in focus allows you to have a better composed shot from a graphic point of view. The other thing this accomplishes, is that when the camera is moved the movement is that much more dramatic because the wide lens heightens the three dimensional quality of the camera moves. And Jeunet moves the camera a lot. Even just for simple push ins. Next time you watch Amélie try to count how many straight push ins there are on characters. Lots and lots. Notice also that when Jeunet dollies the camera he doesn’t pan it at the same time. Dolly shots for Jeunet are almost always very strictly locked off. Jeunet has said in interviews that this is why he does not like to use a steadicam too much because it makes it too difficult for him to maintain the kind of strict consistency that he is looking for.\n\nCheck out a few images from Amélie. Also notice how they look if you remove some of the warmth doing a kind of white balance. The first pictures are the original images from the movie. The second ones are corrected to be more realistically color balanced."
