        "text": "We here at Fandom have already expressed our excitement for Hardcore Henry. The sci-fi/action film is taking a page from such films as Gaspar Noé’s Enter the Void and Frack Khalfoun’s remake of Maniac by shooting the entire film from a first person perspective. From what we’ve seen, it looks like the movie will also be in real-time and feature some unbelievable stunts and action. The good folks over at STX Entertainment have released the film’s theatrical poster, which you can check out below:\n\nThe poster sells the concept of Hardcore Henry perfectly, and it looks like the film is destined to be the first movie to successfully translate the feeling of playing a first person shooter video game to the big screen. Hardcore Henry has been selected as a headlining feature for this years’ SXSW Film Festival. That should clue you in to what kind of a wild ride this film is going to be.\n\nHardcore Henry will open nationwide on April 8. If you need a refresher on how awesome this looks, check out the NSFW trailer:"
