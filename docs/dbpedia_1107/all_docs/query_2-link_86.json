        "text": "As much as we loved his run as 007, Daniel Craig's stint as James Bond is long over. But the question looms: Who will be the next James Bond?\n\nOne suspects that even if you tied one of the Bond producers down to a metal table and threatened them with a laser, they'd still keep stuhm, such has been their pact of silence over the super-secret Bond casting process over the years. But a few major candidates have emerged.\n\nIdris Elba was long thought to be at the top of the deck, but he has taken himself out of the race multiple times now. Fresh-faced newbies like Theo James, Callum Turner and Damson Idris have all stirred interest. (Maybe they'd prefer it shaken.)\n\nBut if there's one guy with his nose out in front currently, it's Aaron Taylor-Johnson, with tabloid rumours pinning him to the double-O gig for a couple of years now. Last year, The Sun reported that he had tested for the role for the Bond behind closed doors, and in May they reported that he has been formally offered the role (although take that with enough salt to rim a margarita glass).\n\nTaylor-Johnson might not be your first pick to grab the Walther PPK, but it's worth noting that Craig wasn't everyone’s first choice for Bond back in 2005, either. Fans protested (they didn’t like that he was blond…) and he even tried to talk producer Barbara Broccoli out of it. So, keep in mind that even the unlikeliest of picks below could be in with a shot.\n\nATJ aside, the fiery second season of House of the Dragon airs from 16 June, and that franchise has served as a proving ground for hot British screen talents in the past. Game of Thrones breakouts Kit Harington and Richard Madden have both been rumoured to take the Bond baton from Craig at various points in their careers; odds are that one of the new Dragon lads, like Fabien Frankel or Tom Glynn-Carney, are now on the radar too.\n\nHere we judge who could and should become the next James Bond.\n\nFabien Frankel\n\nAs House of the Dragon's hunky kingsguard, he had the looks, the machismo and the charisma to woo the queen of Westeros. Will a Bond girl be next?\n\nWhy: Frankel set the internet ablaze when he broke out in the first season of House of the Dragon a few years ago. In it, he portrays Ser Criston Cole, the secret love interest of Olivia Cooke's Queen Alicent Hightower. Owing to his square-jawed looks, machismo and charisma, he has very much taken up Nikolaj Coster-Waldau's Thrones mantle as the series hunk-in-chief (and yeah, they both play the main kings guard). He portrays Cole as a timid guy who will nonetheless get shit done, whatever the cost, even if he has a tendency to bite off more than he can chew; he's driven to a fault and will put anyone who stands in his way to the sword. His affair with Alicent offers a window into his gentler inner character — a juxtaposition of tough and soft that could serve nü Bond well.\n\nWhy not: Frankel hasn't done a huge amount outside of Dragon — no wonder, it's a huge series with a demanding shoot schedule — so it might be a little bit early to tip him for the biggest part in Britain. Keep an eye on him, though: his stock is only going up, he's the right age profile, and a lot of the characteristics you'd traditionally expect of a Bond are right there.\n\nMatt Smith\n\nHe's already played an iconic staple of British screen culture, so why not add another?\n\nWhy: Suave, debonair, with sharp, angular cheekbones that could sub in for a laser watch while hatching a daring escape, Smith has been in the bookies' books for years now, and for good reason. He joined Doctor Who when he was in his late twenties, taking on the job after the immensely popular David Tennant called time; you'd bet on him to similarly live up to the high standards set by Craig for 007. His projects since Who have varied from blockbuster franchise fare — as the villainous Skynet in Terminator Genisys, for example — to queer biopic Mapplethorpe and time-hop horror Last Night in Soho, as if we weren't already confident that he can match up to a utility belt's worth of different tones and moods. Most importantly, he's a star, and as House of the Dragon's Daemon Targaryen, he's arguably putting in the best work of his career. Why not nab him on the up?\n\nWhy not: Smith is in his early forties, which is on the upper end of what the Bond producers are looking for in their new Bond's age profile. He's also knee-deep in a major franchise with a demanding shooting schedule with House of the Dragon, so unless Daemon kicks the bucket this season — no spoilers, book readers — you have to wonder how he'd fit it all in.\n\nTom Glynn-Carney\n\nAs House of the Dragon's new King of Westeros, Glynn-Carney — previously seen in Dunkirk — is on the up.\n\nWhy: After appearing in just the last few episodes of House of the Dragon season one — for the bulk of the season, his character Aegon was played by a younger actor — Glynn-Carney takes leading man duties in the second season. As the petulant, erratic new King of Westeros, Glynn-Carney loves chewing the scenery: he whips between moods on the turn of a coin, from quiet exasperation with the war that slowly marches to his gates, to explosions of drunken, melodramatic rage. He looks good with more screen time on him. No doubt an exciting talent to watch.\n\nWhy not: Glynn-Carney has had a pretty varied young career, but we're yet to see him be in something that could advertise his prospective Bond bonafides.\n\nAaron Taylor-Johnson\n\nAlready known for playing kick-ass superheroes, Bond isn't a huge leap for Taylor-Johnson.\n\nWhy: Taylor-Johnson has it all. The actor, no stranger to stunts, has proven himself as an action star in the making through roles in the Kick-Ass movies, Avengers: Age of Ultron, Godzilla, Tenet and Bullet Train. On top of this, he's good – really good – at emotional range, and his breakthrough role as a young John Lennon in Nowhere Boy was a testament to these skills. The Bond producers reportedly agree too.\n\nThe 33-year-old became a frontrunner after The Sun reported that he went for a secret screen test with producers including Barbara Broccoli at Pinewood studios, and seriously impressed them. “Aaron went for a screen test to be the next Bond in September and producers and Barbara loved him. He is now one of the frontrunners,\" the source said. Then, in March 2024, a report from The Sun — which was cited… pretty much everywhere online, including the BBC — claimed that he had been formally offered the role.\n\nWhy not: At 33, Taylor-Johnson might be a tad too young for a weary and weathered Bond a la Craig. But then again, Bond producer Michael G. Wilson revealed in October 2022 that the team were gravitating towards “a thirty-something”. Aside from that, there really aren't very many downsides to Taylor-Johnson, and it looks like the Bond team may feel similarly.\n\nJosh O’Connor\n\nGive the people the little freak Bond that they truly want\n\nWhy: This is how Ian Fleming describes James Bond in the books: 6ft, blue-grey eyes, short black hair, slim build, a “cruel” mouth… sorry but, doesn't that sound like Josh O'Connor to you? Even down to the mouth? (There are whole fan-cams dedicated to his exceptional, twisted smirk in Challengers). He's also 33, which, like Taylor-Johnson, would be ideal if the producers did indeed plump for a “thirty-something” 007. On top of that, fresh off his roles in Challengers and La Chimera, he's already man of the moment. It's no great stretch to imagine him as man of the… most famous movie franchise in the world. After all, Broccoli confirmed a “reinvention” is on the way and O'Connor would certainly tick that box. Give the people the little freak Bond that they truly want.\n\nWhy not: So far, O'Connor’s filmography doesn't exactly scream “action adventure franchise”. The softly-spoken British actor appears much more enamoured with gritty, complicated, slightly left-field roles about being a washed-up tennis champ, a Yorkshire sheep farmer and a criminal archaeologist. O'Connor himself also doesn't seem particularly sold on the idea, either. In a recent interview on IGV Presents during Challengers promo, an interviewer told him that he could see him as Bond. “Could you?!” O'Connor responded, looking a little incredulous and unconvinced, before laughing off the idea. “I'm not sure I could!”\n\nTheo James\n\nHe's like if you could make James Bond on The Sims.\n\nWhy: Theo James's lead role in Guy Ritchie's The Gentlemen, the 2019 film's universe-expanding series on Netflix, is basically an eight-episode audition for Bond. In it, he plays a charming, aristocratic posho with a secret set of army skills that make it so he can nut bad guys in the face or jump shotgun in a getaway car without breaking much of a sweat. He also, not for nothing, looks like if you could make a generic idea of James Bond on the Sims. He recently starred as a less genteel character in The White Lotus, as your classic finance bro douchebag, but he's been toiling away at this business for a long time. He's fronted action franchises and played romantic leads, but crucially he's never been pigeon-holed by any one character from his roster and that's good if you're going to sign on to the most defining role of all time.\n\nWhy not: Well, he just doesn't seem that keen on it. Of course, this may be classic actor humility, an ‘aww shucks’ attempt at being flattered by the conversation, but speaking to SirusXM, he said “I love some of the Sean Connery movies, but I think they need to do something else. Do you know what I mean? They need to really go with a reinvention of it in a different way and that wouldn’t be me.” Bond has often wrestled with its very consistent and, let's face it, white history. Daniel Craig's run fleshed out the interiority of the character in new ways, but it's long been felt the next iteration should bring some much-needed diversity to the franchise.\n\nCillian Murphy\n\nThe name's winner, Oscar winner.\n\nWhy: Undeniably, Cillian Murphy is the man of the moment. Somewhere right now, a cigar-chomping exec with big gold rings on his fingers is rubbing his hands together to figure out where to capitalise on the newly minted Oscar winner next. And what's bigger than winning an Oscar? Playing James Bond. Call it recency bias or our cultural sickness of never being able to have an original thought anymore, but wouldn't he look good in a slick tux? He's already worn so many of them on the awards trail. Of course, anyone who's seen Murphy in action knows he's a chameleon of the screen, able to oscillate between sociopathic villains and sensitive softies with ease. Seems like a good trait to have for 007, a man inherently burdened by the moral quagmire of his own propensity for violence.\n\nWhy not: Well, as many have pointed out already, it seems like Murphy would rather die than declare unwavering patriotism to King and country, although having a Bond who's outright disdainful of the whole operation could be a fun twist. Beyond love for the Irish motherland, at 47, he might be slightly too old to commit to at least a decade of 007. He would be older than Roger Moore, the current oldest Bond, who kicked off his stint at 45 before hanging up the gun 12 years later. But if there was a world in which Barbara Broccoli fancied trying a one-and-done reset of the franchise - like a palate-cleansing sorbet between courses – maybe he's the guy for the job.\n\nAlan Ritchson\n\nReacher's newly anointed King of Swole could give Bond new muscularity.\n\nWhy: Alan Ritchson is the world's preeminent action hero in ascendency right now apropos of his time on Reacher, Amazon's adaptation of the Jack Reacher books, in which a hulking ex-military vagabond drifts across the continental United States beating up bad guys and flexing his vascular biceps. He's the new Arnie, and as such feels primed and ready for a gig on the big screen — though we'd think he better suits the guns-and-espionage world of Bond than he would, say, the swords-and-magic fantasy of Conan the Barbarian. (He most certainly shouldn't make Schwarzenegger's mistake of playing Mr. Freeze in one of the new Batman movies.)\n\nAfter a short-lived age of twinks, swole muscularity is back en vogue: just look at post-Iron Claw Jeremy Allen White going from chef to heft for that Calvin Klein shoot which broke the internet. And what does Bond embody, if not the archetypal physique of the time?\n\nWhy not: Well, first off, he's American (see below, also: Charles Melton) which takes him out of the running on the basis of pure flag-waving national pride alone (if there's any of that still going, nowadays). Plus, at 41, he's a little outside the age range the Broccolis have touted. And it's hard to imagine such a gigantic bookshelf of a man fitting into a tux without tearing it at the seams. Alas, Bond doesn't do muscle fit.\n\nCharles Melton\n\nWith a breakout awards season movie role freeing him from the shackles of YA television, maybe Bond can solidify him as the next big thing.\n\nWhy: Hello! Look at the bone structure. Deal signed, contract rushed through, studio booked. But in all seriousness, chiselled jawline carved by the gods aside, 2024 was a huge year for Charles Melton as danced around the awards season race for his role in May December. After spending years on the much-memed Netflix series Riverdale, Melton's standout role in the Todd Haynes melodrama had everyone asking ‘Where has this guy been? and how can we see more of him?.’ The next Bond could go one of two ways: it could be a young screen veteran we know and love or, like Daniel Craig, could be a rogue choice intended to swirl as much press as possible. Melton could very possibly be that rogue choice!\n\nWhy not: As always, we have to be sullen Brits about this and say that Melton is American. That doesn't mean he's out of the running - there are plenty of Yanks on this list! It's just that being from across the pond does put him on the back foot as 007 is culturally considered as British as cucumber sandwiches and the concept of queueing. Still, at 32, he is just about the right age and, as we said, rogue choices are a possibility.\n\nBarry Keoghan\n\nHe could sprinkle Bond with a little villainy.\n\nWhy: Over the course of his steadily climbing career that's seen him already nab an Oscar nom, Keoghan has proved himself to be a shockingly fearless actor (please refer to the entirety of Saltburn as a recent example). He is willing to throw himself into pretty much anything, which is a good starting point for the most decorated super spy in film history. Nobody wants a James Bond who hesitates before jumping out of a skyscraper. We came here for thrills, God damn it! And if there's one thing that Keoghan has proved he can do, it's thrills.\n\nWhy not: Well, not to typecast, but wouldn't he just make a spectacular villain? Keoghan is one of the finest little freaks of the silver screen right now (affectionately), and he has a particular brand of haunting insidiousness - lent perfectly to the likes of The Killing of a Sacred Deer and his micro-second as The Joker in Matt Reeves' The Batman - that could make him an excellent foe for whoever bans that 007 crown. The best Bond villains are the ones that seem to worm their way into 007's triple-locked psyche, and Keoghan seems like the kind of actor who could easily pull off some brain-slithering.\n\nDaryl McCormack\n\nHe's giving Daniel Craig's baby blues a run for their money.\n\nWhy: In the span of a short career, McCormack has proved he's got the range. In shows like Vikings and Peaky Blinders, he showed he's got the grit to go toe-to-toe with any number of Bond villain heavies. Then, in his breakout role, Good Luck to You Leo Grande, where he played a male gigolo sensitively navigating the sexual emancipation of his elder client (Emma Thompson), he revealed he's got no issues with getting steamy on screen. A virtue, I think we can all agree, is about as synonymous with Bond as a flashy sports car or nifty gadget. Also, with Craig out, we're losing some of the finest baby blues to grace the screen, but McCormack has got some piercing hazel orbs to give him a run for his money.\n\nWhy not: Honestly, there's no real reason why he couldn't be a great next Bond. The only thing that slightly works against him is his age as, at only 30, he might be slightly too young to really get to grips with a hardened man like James Bond. Still, he's in with a shot, and it might honestly just come down to there only being space for one.\n\nAndrew Garfield\n\nHe's already played a superhero once, and what is Bond if not a spandex-less supe?\n\nWhy: Over the course of an almost two-decade-long career, Garfield has become a bit of a movie darling. A fave of directors like Scorsese and David Fincher, he's proved he's got the acting chops as well as the old-school movie star looks. Just look at him! That's a dashing guy right there. We also can't forget that he had a short-lived tenure as one of the most iconic superheroes in history, Spider-man, meaning he's no stranger to the world of good vs evil. While Bond wouldn't require him to squeeze into spandex, the job roles have some transferrable skills - an innate sense of heroism, mysterious gadgetry and the uncanny ability to simply never die no matter how many times they hit the side of a building at 30mph. As we enter later-stage Garfield, now that he's a bit older and a bit gruffer, Bond could be a great next phase.\n\nWhy not: Despite perpetually looking like a college-aged Peter Parker, Garfield is actually 40 now which might edge him out of the running as producers have said they're looking for an actor in their 30s. There's also the problem that he just looks too… nice. Bond is, for all intents and purposes, a hero, but there's also some villainy there too. He can kill a man without a second thought and leave a trail of women on read across the globe. While we have no doubt Garfield can lean into a role (he's got two Oscar nominations, after all), we might need more convincing that he can really get to grips with Bond's unique brand of grit.\n\nHenry Cavill\n\nLook, Cavill needs a new franchise to jump into and we're ready to accept him with open arms.\n\nWhy: Draw a picture of Bond and the result would be Henry Cavill. Square-jawed, broad-shouldered, dark-haired, blue-eyed. Classically handsome, but could clearly take you in a fight. Auditioning for the role, aged 22, in 2005, Cavill reached the final two before Craig edged him out (apparently it was a virtual toss-up). Sixteen years later, matured as an actor and a man, surely he could go one better? He's got the gap in his schedule, at least. After the absolute mess of his Superman reintroduction and then axing, there's a big franchise-shaped hole in Cavill's life waiting to be filled.\n\n“He looked great in the audition. His acting was tremendous,” Casino Royale director Director Martin Campbell told Variety. “And look, if Daniel didn't exist, Henry would have made an excellent Bond. He looked terrific, he was in great physical shape… very handsome, very chiselled. He just looked a little young at that time back then.” Cavill would've been in his very early twenties at the time of his tryout, so yeah, a little young indeed.\n\nWhy not: Perhaps his history with franchises is his greatest disadvantage. Cavill cuts a dashing figure but nobody can be Superman, Geralt from The Witcher and James Bond. Granted, his stints in both of those properties have now ended, but they'll likely follow him for years to come. Likewise, Cavill’s stint as Napoleon Solo in The Man from U.N.C.L.E is probably too Bond (ditch Solo’s American accent and it’s the same character), and he's just starred in Bond send-up Argylle as a steely British superspy. Bond may have missed out on him.\n\nPlus, ironically given what Martin Campbell has come out and said about Cavill being too young at the time of Casino Royale, he might be just a touch too old for the role now. The Bond producers are on record as looking for an actor in their thirties for the PPK-waving part, and Cavill is now 42. Does that take him out of the running? Depends on how hard and fast that age range is. Craig, notably, was younger when he started out. And then there's that quote the Broccolis keep coming back to – they want to “reinvent” who Bond is. Does Cavill feel like a reinvention? Hardly.\n\nWill Poulter\n\nHaving made his debut in the Marvel Universe in Guardians of the Galaxy 3, Poulter's pivoting to where the action is.\n\nWhy: British actor Will Poulter's commercial viability is on the rise. Fresh off an Emmy nomination for US mini-series Dopesick, the 29-year-old has just nailed a role in the Marvel Universe in Guardians of the Galaxy 3, a move that could open the door to an action role like Bond. He's bulked up and is in peak physical condition thanks to Marvel, so his Bond prep would likely be minimal. Handy that. Poulter's a huge Bond fan himself too. Despite saying he's “sad to see” Daniel Craig (his favourite Bond to date) go, he's “excited to see the evolution of that character and what comes of Lashana in the Bond films”, he told GQ. His passion for the franchise is clear, and surely playing the protagonist would be a natural fit?\n\nWhy not: At 29, Poulter, with his glowing, youthful complexion, potentially is a touch too young for the character. After Craig, it would be a bit of a twist to see a Bond in his 20s, and producers have shared that it's not a direction they're keen to explore. Also, Poulter said himself he's hopeful for Bond to “continue in the same vein”.\n\nTaron Egerton\n\nHe already played a super spy in a Bond dupe, can he do it again?\n\nWhy: Welsh wonder Taron Egerton has already proved his action chops in The Kingsman films, a franchise built on being a more ridiculous and more audacious Bond. As loveable scamp Eggsy, he proved he could play gruff as much as suave, never losing his hard edge in the crisp lines of his tailoring. Ever since his Kingsman run, Egerton's name has been floating around the reboot pool, looking to be snatched up. First, there was Wolverine, a casting choice that felt almost set in stone before it seemed to vanish into thin air. While he's been flexing his other skills, like his hearty pipes in the movie Sing, his dramatic chops in the Apple TV+ series Blackbird and his ability to wear platforms and spandex without breaking a sweat in Rocketman, there's something to be said for those action roots calling him back home.\n\nWhy not: Honestly, at this point, it would just feel a bit random. There's nothing to say that a Bond hopeful can't be plucked from the pack once their time at the top of the leaderboard has well and truly passed but had Daniel Craig actually quit when he said he would, maybe Egerton in the role would make more sense. When pressed recently on whether he still fancied playing Wolverine, he said “You know, it may not be that they’re the right thing for me any more. I think maybe I’m past the point where that felt like the right thing [for my career].” With Bond being as much, if not more, of a tie to one role and one set routine for even longer, maybe the juices of these kinds of roles have just dried up.\n\nDev Patel\n\nWho says we can't have a Bond with beachy waves?\n\nWhy: Dev Patel is, quite frankly, one of the best-looking guys out there – and that's only about 45 per cent to do with those luscious, curly locks. Tall, dark and handsome, he's everything Bond should be, especially with his recent electric performance in the action-packed Monkey Man (also his directorial debut – busy guy). Since his run as the awkward Anwar in Skins, Patel has earned himself a healthy roster of roles, including an Oscar nomination for his turn in Lion. Between comedy, drama and action, there's not really much that Patel has tried his hand at that hasn't worked, and with a supposed re-invention of Bond coming with this next iteration, maybe there's a chance to have a bit more fun with it. Craig was the perfect, monosyllabic Bond for the noughties, but maybe this new 007, a man of the 2020s, can loosen the collar a bit. As long as they don't make Dev Patel cut the hair!\n\nWhy not: Simply put, Dev Patel just doesn't seem that bothered about playing Bond. After a few early-career big-budget turkeys, Patel seems to have found his groove with the mid-budget indie. Considering this is going to be the most hotly-contested role of the decade, whoever's in the running might need a bit more bite – although Monkey Man has this in abundance.\n\nJacob Elordi\n\nAnother Elvis enters the ring.\n\nWhy: Jacob Elordi is hot right now. I mean, he's been hot this whole time, but in terms of cultural capital, he's basically on fire. Long gone are the days of him being shackled to The Kissing Booth movies, and with Euphoria basically in indefinite limbo, Elordi has taken his chance to become the next it-boy, serving as the hot-boy muse of Sofia Coppola in Priscilla, where he'll take on the role of Elvis, and Emerald Fennell's Saltburn, where he seems to be the object of psycho-sexual obsession (we get it). Combine this era of being a director's actor with the fact he knows how to wear a suit (and a tiny little handbag), it's kind of a no-brainer.\n\nWhy not: Well, sadly, he's an Aussie. He's not the only non-Brit to grace this list and, as we said, all bets are off this time around when it comes to what we imagine as Bond. But it will be a hard thing for people to get over, that's for sure. And while The Kissing Booth franchise is no Bond, Elordi has already done his time tethered to a role with no immediate end in sight and, to be honest, it's exciting seeing the more interesting projects he's deciding to carve out as a result of his freedom. Bond is great, but we need our it-boys in indie cinema, too.\n\nDamson Idris\n\nThe rising star who is about to explode!\n\nWhy: Damson Idris might not be a household name, but that hasn't stopped him from quickly climbing the ranks as one of the most likely Bond hopefuls. He's currently dancing around the top five, after catching eyes from his prestige turns in the likes of Black Mirror and Donald Glover's Swarm. He's handsome, charming and mysterious, which is the second-most important cocktail in the Bondiverse. He'll next be sharing the screen with Brad Pitt in a new Formula 1 movie for Apple TV+ directed by Top Gun: Maverick's Joseph Kosinski, meaning his rising star could soon be about to explode. In terms of exciting prospects for the new 007, Idris basically the ideal choice.\n\nWhy not: Honestly, there are very few reasons why Damson Idris shouldn't play Bond. As with the conversation that followed Idris Elba for years, the prospect of leading the charge as the first Black Bond will inevitably come with pushback that no one should have to endure unless they want to. However, as conversation has evolved about who and what Bond represents, Idris seems like the perfect mould for 2023 and beyond.\n\nHenry Golding\n\nHe proved his action chops (and looked good doing it) in Guy Ritchie's The Gentlemen in 2019.\n\nWhy: It takes a special kind of person to go from zero acting roles to leading a big-budget romantic comedy based purely on your inherent desirability. Henry Golding was plucked from the world of BBC travel presenting back in 2018 to front Crazy Rich Asians, with the book's author saying “He’s a leading man three times over without the first movie even coming out yet, and it’s a testament to his talent. People just fall in love with him\". Since then he's continued his upward trajectory, hitting every genre from action (The Gentlemen, Snake Eyes) to comedy (A Simple Favour) to historical drama (Persuasion). There's kind of nothing he can't do, and it also helps that he knows how to wear the hell out of a suit. His casting would also be a historic move, as the franchise has often been plagued with criticisms about its willingness to accept a diversity of the British experience. It could be the perfect way to kick off a new era of Bond.\n\nWhy not: Golding has charm coming out of the wazoo. He's literally built an entire career on it. His dimples, deep eyes you could bathe in and kind warmth would surely snare any Bond girl in a 2-mile radius, but whether or not he can embody the explosive menace and violence that 007 needs to exhibit regularly remains to be seen.\n\nPaul Mescal\n\nThe primo softboi is entering his hardboi era\n\nWhy: It's been a banner few years for Paul Mescal. After erupting into our lives during the pandemic as some kind of parasocial soft boi in Normal People, he's just nabbed his first Oscar nomination for the intimate and brooding Aftersun. The film is basically two hours of Mescal saying nothing but everything at the same time, a trait inherent to any Bond racking up trauma on the daily. As well as clearly being able to internalise the complex interiority of James Bond, he's got the bod (never forget the short shorts) and action backing to boost the adrenaline as he's just been cast in Ridley Scott's long-awaited Gladiator sequel. Maybe it's time to get 007 a signature gold chain as well as drink order.\n\nWhy not: Can James Bond ever be a softboi? Mescal may be entering his hardboi era now, but there's just something inherently unthreatening about him. We might have to wait for a few of his grittier projects to see the light of day before making a judgement on whether we can give him a license to kill.\n\nRegé-Jean Page\n\nPage proved what he could do with a spoon. Let's see what happens when we give him a gun.\n\nWhy: If Bond is the most eligible bachelor ever to appear on screen (let’s be clear: he is), then there are few better auditions than Regé-Jean Page’s turn as Simon Basset, the Duke Of Hastings, in Shonda Rhimes’ adaptation of the Bridgerton novels. He’s tall and good-looking, his skills in a velvet frock coat and cravat mean he would ace the Bond tuxedo test and he has the necessary charm and lightness of touch to deliver Bond’s one-liners.\n\nSince Bridgerton dropped on Christmas Day 2020 and saw Page's chances with the bookies drop from 40/1 to 5/1, his odds have remained short at a commanding 3/1. Is he about to be revealed?\n\nPage most recently appeared on our screens in Netflix's The Gray Man, portraying an evil CIA figurehead (likely to be seen in the just-announced sequel). Given the groundswell of interest around Page as Bond, The Radio Times asked directors the Russo Brothers for their thoughts on his 007 bona fides — and the American sibling duo gave four resounding thumbs up.\n\n“He's fantastic,” Joe Russo said. “I mean, he has more charisma in his pinky than most people do in their entire body. So you know, we'd watch him do anything — I mean, we'd watch him read the phonebook!” Anthony Russo agreed. “[He's a] very savvy performer and [has] so much charm.”\n\nWhy not: Bridgerton is charming, whimsical and a gloriously Americanised view of high society in Regency England. Hastings can be tough at times, certainly, but would Page deliver the right sort of deep, brooding menace to Bond that Craig has imbued in the role? There’s an argument that he’s a little lightweight.\n\nJamie Campbell Bower\n\nWell, stranger things have happened…\n\nWhy: Stranger Things 4 was absolutely massive for Netflix, becoming their most streamed English-language TV show ever. Bower was ever-present throughout the series, both as a figment of Eleven's (Millie Bobby Brown) mind exploration and, as was revealed towards the tail end of the season, the slimy big bad guy Vecna. His performance was a real treat and went down terrifically with fans online — but did you know he's a Brit? And not only that, he's 33-years-old — almost the perfect age for any new Bond?\n\nWhy not: Weeeeeell… it's just not all that exciting a prospect, is it? At least not yet. Bower did a terrific job in Stranger Things, elevating Vecna with shrewd emotional range, his big, sharp eyes giving him a deeply sinister edge. There's definite Bond villain quality here, but the big man himself? We'll need to see a little more first. The clock is ticking, Jamie…\n\nAustin Butler\n\nPlease, let's give him a new accent to adopt indefinitely.\n\nWhy: It's hard to imagine a riskier role than Elvis Aaron Presley, probably the most parodied and imitated man in the world, but American actor Austin Butler does it with aplomb in Baz Lurhmann's superlative biopic of the American singer. Could Butler's next step be the most parodied and imitated man in fiction? At 30, he's about the right age, particularly given the producer's stated intention to modernise the Bond character. He's famous without yet being over-exposed or too connected to an existing role, just like Daniel Craig was when he took the helm (and what counts again long-time bookies' favourite Idris Elba). He can smoulder with the best of them, and could probably pull off the British accent.\n\nWhy not: After the grizzled physicality of the Craig years, it's hard to imagine a Bond with such old-school matinee idol looks as Butler in the role. Not matter how much they make Bond a modern man, he's still going to have to karate chop the odd henchman and roll out of the way of some explosions: at the moment, it's hard to picture Broadway darling Butler doing that, although he piled on the muscle for his role in Dune: Part Two. Then of course there's the fact he is American, which might cause a hardcore Bond fan backlash of diplomatic incident proportions. Actually, mark that as something in his favour.\n\nRobert Pattinson\n\nNow one of the most interesting actors in the business, Pattinson could take Bond in a unique direction.\n\nWhy: He’s come a long way since Edward Cullen. While we would never cast aspersions on his role as the glittery vampire, Robert Pattinson has developed his acting repertoire substantially since the blockbuster Twilight franchise ended, opting for a raft of challenging indie roles that have each informed his acting style. The Batman could turn into a long-running series, which could hamper his chances of taking on Bond, but Bond’s physical nature wouldn’t be a problem for the newly-hench leading man. He has the looks, the charm, and the dedicated approach to filmmaking that Bond's production team look for in a candidate. Superhero to superspy, anyone?\n\nIt seems as though we're not the only proponents for R-Patz swapping the Batsuit for a tux. Speaking to Esquire UK ahead of the release of Disney+'s Pistol, director Danny Boyle said Pattinson would've been one of his two picks for the next Bond, alongside I May Destroy You's Paapa Essiedu. Boyle's canned 007 flick would've covered his origin story, before taking the action to present-day Russia. Pattinson on a clandestine, high-stakes mission in Moscow? Count us in.\n\nWhy not: Bond has looked towards a little more humour in recent outings, and while we have no doubt Pattinson would be up to the task, his more serious filmography might look too “Timothy Dalton” (NB we rate Licence To Kill's grittier tone) for Bond's current direction.\n\nOn top of that, The Batman was a throw of the dice for DC Comics, still the film equivalent of Pepsi to Marvel’s Coca-Cola. It’s a much darker outing for the superhero, but if the popularity of The Batman and Joker is anything to go by, people are in the mood for a bit of dark reimagining. It could spell the end of Pattinson’s chances to become 007 – at least for now…\n\nPaapa Essiedu\n\nThe new kid on the block.\n\nWhy: Well, he's a bloody good actor for a start. Having first come to light in Michaela Coel's I May Destroy You back in 2020, Essiedu's stock has exploded over the last couple of years, picking up starring roles in the likes of Alex Garland's Men and dystopian sci-fi show The Lazarus Project. His performance in A Number at The Old Vic, opposite The Walking Dead's Lennie James, was heralded as one of the best of the year across Theatreland. Danny Boyle even went on record that Essiedu would be one of his two picks for the PPK, along with Robert Pattinson.\n\nWhy not: There are a couple of obstacles. Firstly, one should think that the Bond producers will be looking for a more established name for the next 007, especially if he's only brought in to do one or two films as has been speculated. Essiedu is 33, so on the young side, but they'd be silly not to check back in with him in a couple of years, assuming the slot is still open.\n\nHarry Styles\n\nCould Bond save his acting career?\n\nWhy: Harry Styles' acting career hasn't had the best start. Although starting strong with a small role in Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk that left us wanting more, the more he gave us in 2022's Don't Worry Darling and My Policeman didn't quite hit the mark. Still, God loves a trier and what better training than MI6? Bond needs an injection of something new, fresh and young to carry on working into the future, and never underestimate the power of Harry Styles fans putting their bums firmly in cinema seats.\n\nWhy not: As we said, his acting just isn't great – yet. He also just might just be too young and too good-looking. If the next James Bond has to be rugged and dangerous, maybe Harry isn’t the man for the job. Add to that his introduction to the Marvel Cinematic Universe as Eros, and it looks like Mr Styles might be unavailable for the next ten years.\n\nHarris Dickinson\n\nRecently an EE Rising Star nominee at the BAFTAs, the Kingsman star boasts all of the suave sophistication one might wish for from a potential Bond.\n\nWhy: A shape-shifter of a performer, Harris Dickinson has done it all by his mid-twenties: he's led a major franchise installment in The Kingsman, and won over cinephillic hearts and minds in esoteric, artsier fare like Beach Rats, Matthias & Maxime and The Souvenir Part II. The Kingsman especially proved his spy bonafides, along with atypical emotional versatility and all of the screen presence you'd demand of Bond. His take? “Nah, I don't think so,” he told ES Magazine. Humble, too!\n\nWhy not: He's only 27, which would historically prove a touch too young to play the grizzled super spy. But if he keeps up his present momentum, it's hard not to see how he won't be at the centre of the conversation in five or ten years — assuming the slot isn't filled by a long-timer.\n\nIdris Elba\n\nThe star of The Wire and Luther has long been a front-runner, but reports suggest he's not actually that interested.\n\nWhy: Amidst all the other names that are thrown around, Idris Elba’s has been the one that keeps seeming to crop up, and unsurprisingly, given he is the perfect fit for the Bond criteria: tall, ridiculously attractive, magnetic. We had further evidence that the pendulum had finally swung fully towards Elba (much to our delight) a couple of years ago, with Barbara Broccoli, the franchise’s producer, quoted as saying Elba is “part of the conversation” for the role — the first time she has admitted as such. Elba fits the criteria as an actor – though he shouldn’t be assumed as the only non-white candidate for the role – and of course, we’re hoping Broccoli’s statement is finally enacted. Who better than one of the front-runners to become Britain’s best-known Secret Service agent?\n\nWhy not: Quite simply, the moment may have passed. Elba is 51: only two years younger than Daniel Craig at the end of his tenure. His age has been the biggest factor in the argument against Idris Elba, and if this were the reason for him to miss out on playing one of the biggest roles in Hollywood (and for us to miss seeing him on our screens) we’d be less than impressed. After all, Roger Moore was only a few years younger when he took up the role in 1973 (Live And Let Die), and retired from Bond aged 58. Moral of the story: there’s plenty of time.\n\nThe other setback, surprisingly, is Elba himself. On a podcast appearance, the actor said that playing Bond is “not a goal” for his career, but also expressed how aware he is that the whole world is expecting him to take on 007. “It’s not a question of, should I, do I, will I,” he said. “It is what the will of the nation dictates sometimes.” Sounds like the people want him as the spy more than he does.\n\nJamie Dornan\n\n“The Golden Torso” isn't just a pretty face (and torso).\n\nWhy: Many might primarily associate him with either a brilliant performance as The Fall’s first villain, serial killer Peter Spector, or controlling BDSM fan Christian Grey. Aspects of both characters, oddly, fit nicely with the Bond profile: the successful, confident outward personality; the persuasive talents; the quick thinking in a tight situation. Basically, we’re saying he plays a good psychopath.\n\nHowever, his acting range isn’t limited to sex enthusiasts and serial killers. He’s played real-life army heroes Jan Kubiš and Pat Quinlan, along with war zone photographer (and former member of the Royal Artillery) Paul Conroy, roles that would stand him in good stead when approaching 007’s military mindset. He’s also able to handle comic scenes, such as his musical revelation in Barb and Star Go to Vista Del Mar, and displays his ever-growing depth in Sir Kenneth Branagh’s semi-autobiographical Belfast.\n\nSo, the acting is there, but Bond has to be a bit of a stud. Coincidentally, Dornan was dubbed “The Golden Torso” by the New York Times, and named by Vogue as one of the 25 biggest male models of all time. Box ticked.\n\nWhy not: One major pitfall of helming a commercially successful film franchise is that you run the risk of moviegoers linking you to a previous role. Would Dornan be able to shake off the 50 Shades association and bring the Bond audience along for the ride?\n\nJonathan Bailey\n\nPerhaps a left-field option, but Bailey has all the skills in his locker to take on 007 and make the role his own.\n\nWhy: He might have been one of Bridgerton's biggest stars, but Bailey has a strong acting pedigree through theatre and TV, and his role in the Netflix hit has only served to bring his name to the attention of a wider audience. He’s the right age for a reboot and potential four or five film arc, has the looks and athleticism, and hasn’t been cast in any big franchises, so won’t suffer from any franchise association. Sounds like just the ticket for Barbara Broccoli.\n\nHis acting credits show an impressive versatility: a smarmy, comic recurring role in the BBC’s self-effacing mockumentary W1A was followed by an Olivier Award-winning turn as Jamie in the West End revival of Company. His biggest screen role to date is, of course, as Anthony Bridgerton, the head of the eponymous family’s estate. Bailey’s success in a variety of roles makes him a perfect candidate for the updated Bond, one that’s able to show the vulnerability, physicality and humour that was used to such good effect in No Time To Die.\n\nWhy not: At 35, some might think of him as still too young to take on the mantle of the experienced, gruff Bond. However, Daniel Craig was 38 when he started, George Lazenby was 29 when he took the role, and Sir Sean Connery was a youthful 31. Bond author Ian Fleming also puts 007 at 37 in Moonraker, so it’s getting pretty close to just right.\n\nTom Hardy\n\n(Arguably) the acting talent of his generation, the man whose odds were slashed to ribbons amid unconfirmed reports of his casting that emerged in September 2020 is still among the leading pack.\n\nWhy: He’s box office, pure and simple. How many actors could pull off a one-man film (as Hardy did in Locke) and then play both leading roles in another (AKA Legend)? He plays a suave, vaguely Bondish figure in Christopher Nolan’s Inception, too.\n\nOn 20 September 2020, it was reported that Hardy had already been cast in the role after supposedly auditioning back in June, and that he was due to be unveiled as Bond in November on the release of No Time To Die. Although that didn't transpire, the news prompted bookies to slash odds, including Ladbrokes shortening theirs from a fairly distant 8/1 to 4/5 – practically a shoo-in. He's drifted since, but is a permanent fixture in the most-likely top tier.\n\nFor our money, Hardy physically resembles Fleming’s Bond and would bring a dangerous edge and devastating talent. He fuelled the debate by stating: “There’s a saying amongst us in the fraternity of acting... that if you talk about it [Bond rumours], you’re automatically out of the race. So I can’t possibly comment on that one!”\n\nWhy not: Bond might be too mainstream for the independent-minded Hardy. He likes creative freedom, as roles in Locke, The Drop and London Road attest. His blockbuster works with Nolan were both one-off appearances, not recurring franchise roles. Plus, Hardy might have found his ideal franchise in the inventive, critically acclaimed Mad Max. Bond may want Hardy more than Hardy wants Bond.\n\nSam Heughan\n\nHe's played spies, and Bond is Scottish…\n\nWhy: The star of Amazon Prime’s Outlander, Sam Heughan, is an unexpected contender in the race to play the next Bond, which is exactly why he could be in with a good chance of finishing first. Compared to contenders like Hardy and the Hiddleston, Heughan is a familiar but relatively unknown face and is at a similar point in his career as Daniel Craig was before he landed the Bond gig. He’s a couple of years older than Timothy Dalton was when he was cast and a year older than Pierce Brosnan. Heughan is Scottish, but that’s obviously no barrier to success considering the most famous Bond was a certain Mr Connery, with Fleming so impressed that he even retconned Bond as Scottish. And, most importantly, James Bond doesn’t need to be played by a megawatt Hollywood star – James Bond makes them one. Besides, Heughan has already proven he’s got the talent to take on such a huge role.\n\nNeed further convincing? Based on Diana Gabaldon’s novel series of the same name, Outlander is a period drama meets sci-fi adventure TV show set during the Jacobite risings, in which Heughan plays a charming soldier, already making him something of a Georgian James Bond. In July 2020, a Radio Times poll of 80,000 readers found that Heughan was the favourite to take on Bond’s mantle with almost twice his nearest competitor’s votes. In other words, Outlander fans are numerous, dedicated and organised. Plus, Heughan has action movie experience in Bloodshot and The Spy Who Dumped Me, films of mixed quality but ones that certainly added important roles to his CV (Heughan literally played a spy in the latter film).\n\nWhy not: While it’s true that James Bond doesn’t need to be played by a huge name, that doesn’t mean that studio execs won’t want one. Heughan doesn’t have any hugely distinguishing features to mark himself out as a candidate. He’s good-looking, but all the possibilities are. He’s been in action films, but all of them have. He wouldn’t be the first Bond of colour, nor female or American or anything else like that. The most notable thing about him is that most British people, not to mention Bond fans around the world, haven’t heard of him. After all, even Daniel Craig saw some controversy around the casting of a blond Bond. Would Heughan be a little too safe? There’s still a chance that Heughan could be overlooked during the casting process in favour of a more recognisable face, but only time will tell which direction they’ll decide to go in.\n\nTom Holland\n\nCan one actor play both Bond and Spider-Man? Why not?\n\nWhy: He wants it, for a start. While lots of actors play coy when it comes to openly admitting they would leap at the chance to don the tux and pick up the Walther PPK, Tom Holland appeared on Variety’s Awards Circuit podcast a couple of years ago and confirmed that he was very keen on taking on Bond. “Ultimately,” said Holland, “as a young British lad who loves cinema, I’d love to be James Bond. I’m just putting that out there. I look pretty good in a suit.”\n\nCasting Holland would be a coup for production company Eon on virtually every commercial front. He is one of the most popular and beloved idols on the planet, a personable and stylish young actor with a built-in legion of fans who already know him from playing Spider-Man in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Adding Bond to his resumé would mean Holland was playing a central role in two of the planet’s biggest franchises.\n\nWhy not: There are very few arguments against him, but the main sticking point has to be his youth: Holland is in his mid-to-late-twenties and still plays lots of characters who are teenagers. Bond is typically a veteran with years of experience under his belt and Holland might be better off waiting to become the next-but-one (or even two) Bond. There would be time for his fellow Toms Hardy and Hiddleston each to take up the mantle of 007 before Holland even comes close to 40. No rush.\n\nRichard Madden\n\nThe leading man in the BBC’s smash hit Bodyguard has the jawline and the skillset, and he’s even caught the attention of the Bond bosses.\n\nWhy: Any prospective Bond has to prove they can play seduction and espionage in equal measure, and Richard Madden has done that repeatedly: as both hopeless romantic and war hero Robb Stark, as Prince Charming in Cinderella, and in the action film Bastille Day. His role as David Budd in Jed Mercurio’s Bodyguard got tongues wagging afresh, including that of Bond head honcho Barbara Broccoli. The Daily Mail reported in 2018 that “Bond bosses are on the brink of approaching the Bodyguard star.”\n\nWhy not: It's not so much about his suitability and more about what Madden told us when he was our cover star. “The papers make up a story on a Sunday so they can discredit that story on the Monday so they can sell papers on both days,” he told GQ. “I don’t want to curse anything by saying anything. I think that’s the curse of that. If you talk about it, you’ll curse it.” But he did admit he's a big fan of Bond, so if he's approached, it sounds like it would take a lot for him to say no.\n\nJames Norton\n\nThe star of television Happy Valley, War and Peace and Grantchester.\n\nWhy: James Norton’s profile rocketed in 2016 with his triple whammy performances in Happy Valley (profound psycho), War and Peace (mournful warrior) and Grantchester (Anglican priest with a robust moral compass). With an eclectic mix of characters already on his CV, as well as an education at Cambridge, we’re certain that Norton could easily slip into the role of the suave and sophisticated 007.\n\nHollywood veteran Diane Keaton told Sky News that Norton would be perfect for the 007 role: \"He's got everything that you need. First of all he's extremely attractive, very smart, he's well educated, and he's a fantastic actor. And he's sexy, right? I'm not wrong, I mean, women are gonna love him.” And at the young age of 38, he could definitely carry the Bond franchise for many years to come.\n\nWhy Not: Like Aidan Turner, the issue with Norton is his ability to attract a large enough audience to back him. The transition from beloved TV actor to the face of the world’s biggest action franchise could prove to be too big of an ask for young Norton. Cavill has Superman, Hiddleston has Loki and Fassbender has Magneto; Norton is still yet to prove that he’s true blockbuster material.\n\nTom Hiddleston\n\nThe Marvel villain.\n\nWhy: For starters, Tom Hiddleston’s already made a success of playing a beguiling spy. Impressing critics and drawing huge audiences as Jonathan Pine in the BBC’s The Night Manager, the drama series based on the John le Carré novel, is as close as it gets to a public job application for the role. He’s tall, charming, well dressed and has a built-in fan base thanks to his performance as Loki in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.\n\nWhy not: Again, for starters, he’s already made a success of playing a beguiling spy. Would he want to do that again? As his performance in High-Rise shows, he doesn’t always take obvious roles. He might look at Daniel Craig's frustrations from playing one role for a decade and think “no thanks”. There's also a sense that his Bond ship might have already sailed, with conversation hitting an apex around 2016 before swiftly fizzling out. Another factor: Bond producer Barbara Broccoli has reportedly declared him “too posh” in the past.\n\nRiz Ahmed\n\nThe first brown Bond?\n\nWhy: In our September 2018 issue, we asked Ahmed if he would consider taking on the prestigious 007 role. His answer: “You know, any stretching the mould of what our traditional archetypes are appeals to me – so yes, those classic stories, be it a kind of superhero or James Bond.” We’re hoping this might potentially bring him into the running, as it should do, as he’s incredibly handsome with the acting ability to back him up. Step aside Q; Ahmed boasts a jawline sharp enough to cut Bond’s enemies on.\n\nWhy not: He would, perhaps, be the shortest Bond to have graced our screens, but hopefully we’ve moved on from thinking this is a hard-and-fast requirement, especially when we’re all viewing an enlarged 30”x70” image in the cinema. Ahmed’s past roles also may make him a more unconventional choice for the role – Four Lions, as an obvious example – but parts in Nightcrawler and the critically-acclaimed The Night Of give us a glimpse into his versatile acting abilities.\n\nNicholas Hoult\n\nThe golden boy of British acting looks ready for superstardom. But Bond?\n\nWhy: This would be another brave choice with the potential to pay dividends. A young, hungry British actor with franchise experience but no defining role: Nicholas Hoult has the talent to grab the franchise by the scruff of the neck. He’s a very different actor to Craig, smoother and less physical. It would refreshing to see a new interpretation of the character.\n\nWhy not: High of cheekbone, cherubic of lip – is Hoult too pretty for Bond? Can you really imagine him beating a henchman to a pulp? Compared to the weathered Daniel Craig he might look more One Direction than 007. Assuming he doesn’t land a different franchise lead, Hoult could be the perfect eighth Bond in a decade. But perhaps not the seventh one right now.\n\nLuke Evans\n\nThe GQ readership pick. Say no more.\n\nWhy: Look at him. Lose the moustache, trim the hair and you have James Bond sprung from the pages of Fleming’s novels. Fast & Furious 6 proved his action credentials, while the stoically heroic Bard from The Hobbit is the James Bond of Middle Earth, only duller and a little grubbier. But it’s his titular role in Dracula Untold that really sells the prospect of Luke Evans as James Bond, 007. He’s established but hardly a megastar and, at 45, Evans could nail down the role for a decade. Not to mention he won our last GQ poll for the preferred next James Bond – what better endorsement can you have?\n\nWhy not: Despite his growing profile, the Evans candidacy hasn’t yet caught fire with the bookies. Strangely, a lack of television experience may prove a drawback – whereas most names on this list built up their profile on the small screen, Evans has always been a theatre or film man, his part in Netflix’s The Alienist notwithstanding. As a result, he may be more unfamiliar to a British audience than somebody with his success deserves. However, he certainly has a passionate fan base and may well be better placed than the odds indicate."
