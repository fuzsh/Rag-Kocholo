        "text": "Fresh off the success of “Godzilla vs. Kong” (the rather unlikely jolt of life the theatrical release business needed earlier this year), it appears that Adam Wingard isn’t slowing down anytime soon. The filmmaker seems to have cloned himself and has added yet another project to his growing slate.\n\nREAD MORE: Adam Wingard Tapped To Make Another Monsterverse Movie For Legendary Pictures\n\nAccording to THR, Adam Wingard has signed on to co-write and direct the upcoming film, “Hardcore,” which is based on a comic book series from “The Walking Dead”/“Invincible” creator Robert Kirkman and artist Marc Silvestri. “Hardcore” tells the story of one of the best assassins in the world that utilizes a technology that allows him to take over the body of any human on earth and use them as a murder drone of sorts. Yes, the film sounds an awful lot like “Possessor,” the recent thriller from Brandon Cronenberg, but we have to imagine that Wingard’s film is going to be similar in premise only, as the two creators are very different.\n\nIn addition to directing the feature, Wingard is also on board to co-write the script alongside Will Simmon, who recently finished drafts of “Sleepy Hollow” and “Internal Affairs” reboots. As mentioned, “Hardcore” is just one of the numerous recent new projects from Wingard. Since the debut of “Godzilla vs. Kong,” the filmmaker has signed on to co-write and direct a “Face/Off” sequel. He’s also signed on to direct a “ThunderCats” animated feature. And just recently, Wingard reportedly signed on to do yet another MonsterVerse film. Needless to say, that’s one very stacked lineup of projects for any single filmmaker.\n\nLISTEN: Robert Kirkman Talks ‘Invincible,’ The ‘Walking Dead’ Spinoff Films, His Lee Daniels Collab & More [The Playlist Podcast]\n\nIt’s unclear when we might see “Hardcore” arrive in theaters. From the looks of his schedule, it appears this new comic book feature is the one furthest away from filming, so this could still be a few years off."
