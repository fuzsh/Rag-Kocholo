        "text": "“This was like, ‘Dude, while you’re on fire, remember to turn up and frame the other guy on fire and then jump out of the window and don’t break the GoPro!'”-Sharlto Copley\n\nUnsurprisingly, having a man who’s thrown through windows, blown up or bashed in the skull as the acting fulcrum presented its own unique challenges. “The stunt guys get into a Zen-like space before they do something,” Copley says. “This was like, ‘Dude, while you’re on fire, remember to turn up and frame the other guy on fire and then jump out of the window and don’t break the GoPro!'”\n\nDespite Naishuller and Copley’s mantra that “nobody must die on the film,” Russia’s less-stringent safety laws allowed for some of the movie’s most riveting scenes. A wire-less, CGI-free chase on top of a bridge, for example, was inspired by a real-life chat between two stuntmen reminiscing about dangerous childhood bridge climbs. “The country is pretty lax with safety measures on set,” says Naishuller. “We’re not as obsessed with safety as you are on American sets. I told my stunt coordinators in the beginning, ‘Look, film will live forever and pain is temporary.’ It’s dangerous, but it’s all calculated and well-thought-out.” Both Naishuller and Copley proudly bring up the film’s minimal total damage in interviews: only five stitches and a chipped tooth.\n\nNaishuller’s fascination with first-person shooting began five years ago after buying a GoPro and filming a disastrous snowboarding run. “I’m a terrible snowboarder, so I came home and looked at the material and thought, ‘I’ll never let this see the light of day,'” he says. He had more success with everyday interactions, noticing that when he filmed “what humans really do, it becomes very exciting and interesting.”\n\nEditor’s picks\n\nAs a member of Russian indie-rock group Biting Elbows, Naishuller used the GoPro to film two of the band’s videos that would become Hardcore harbingers: “The Stampede,” about an office drone chased by a phalanx of violent suits, and “Bad Motherfucker,” the ultraviolent stylistic sequel that has amassed more than 100 million views. (“I watched the thing, like, 20 times, man, on repeat,” says Copley.)\n\nOne of those views was Timur Bekmambetov, director of Wanted and the popular Russian supernatural action-film Night Watch, who pushed Naishuller to turn his short films into his first feature; he eventually signed on as a producer.\n\n“‘Bad Motherfucker’ was like nothing I had ever seen before – it was intense, riveting, thrilling, dangerous and defiant,” Bekmambetov says. “I wanted to see more and I admired Ilya’s audacious, creative spirit.”\n\n“I told him I thought it was a terrible idea [to do a POV feature],” Naishuller admits, fearing it would be too “gimmicky.” “But he asked me if I wanted to see a great POV action movie at the cinema and the answer was yes. So he told me I should just go make one. It just clicked right away after that.” The director had been writing a multi-layered, slow-burning spy thriller at the time, but abandoned it to begin pre-production on Hardcore.\n\nShot over the past three years, Naishuller immersed himself in POV filmmaking, showing the cast and crew scenes from Kathryn Bigelow’s noir dystopia Strange Days and Gareth Evans’ martial arts flick The Raid: Redemption. But it was Lady in the Lake, Robert Montgomery’s 1947 noir shot almost entirely in first-person, that was the most instructive movie for him — a primer in what not to do with the niche technique.\n\nRelated\n\n“It’s a failed experiment of a film, but was very helpful for me,” Naishuller says, noting that he made Henry mute after seeing the protagonist talk throughout the movie. “The immersion ends as soon as the character who we’re supposed to be starts talking and he says stuff that we have no idea what he’s talking about. There’s distance from the character. If we didn’t have the immersion, then we might as well have not wasted any energy on the movie.”\n\nWhile Naishuller says his goal is to “make more great movies,” first-person or otherwise, a successful box office run for the film may portend a new glut of similar movies, for better or worse. Copley imagines the technology extending past action and fundamentally changing the way a filmgoer experiences movies.\n\n“If you were Leo or Kate at the end of Titanic and your partner’s slipping away to death, would that be even more engaging if the actor was looking you in the eye?” he asks. “I don’t know the answer, but I think it’s a fascinating question.”"
