        "text": "There are two ways in which the savage, adrenaline-fueled Hardcore Henry gets in your face. One is pretty fun. The other proves progressively less so.\n\nAn almost-real-time action-thriller in which we see the entire movie from the main character's point of view, the feature debut of Russian writer-director Ilya Naishuller (who also fronts the Russian punk band Biting Elbows) can be a naughty, exhilarating rush, its embrace of over-the-top violence both liberating and funny. Eventually, though, Hardcore Henry (out April 8 in the USA) chokes on its own obnoxious, bro-heavy posturing. The moviemaking innovations would have gone down a lot smoother if the rest of this film weren't so damn dumb.\n\nAs the movie begins we wake up as Henry, and what we see on the screen is everything he sees. (Consequently, we have no idea what the main character's face looks like.) A beautiful blonde named Estelle (Haley Bennett) tells Henry she's his wife and that he survived a deadly attack that left him unable to speak or remember what happened. Like Henry, the audience must piece together the backstory in a hurry while the film kicks into overdrive. Soon it becomes clear he's some sort of super-soldier whose flesh-and-bone body has been supplemented with mechanical accouterments, and Akan (Danila Kozlovsky)—a creepy, effete villain with telekinetic powers—wants him dead.\n\nNaishuller uses that setup to launch into an exercise in forward momentum. Henry tries to evade Akan's armed thugs across Moscow while searching for his kidnapped wife, and is occasionally assisted by a strange man, Jimmy (Sharlto Copley), who keeps getting killed but then inexplicably pops up again in different guises. Using mostly GoPro cameras to capture the main character's perspective, Hardcore Henry tells us almost nothing about him, and since he can't talk, we don't even know what his voice sounds like. It makes for an interesting narrative experiment. Naishuller almost encourages us to cast ourselves as the film's hero, making Hardcore Henry a kind of virtual-reality, first-person-shooter action movie.\n\nIn the film's early stretches, that experiment brings plenty of pleasures. Working with three cinematographers and three camera operators (including himself), Naishuller has a ball playing with his story's conceit, slowly teasing out information, intentionally limiting our understanding to only what we can see in the frame. It's a technique that's been successful in found-footage horror movies like Cloverfield, but here it creates all kinds of surprises and can evoke feelings of vertigo. For instance, we suddenly realize that the compound we're inside is actually on a plane high above the ground.\n\nBecause Henry has incredible strength, advanced killing skills, and a remarkable ability to fall from great heights without dying, we get a front row seat to his violent rampages as he dispenses with copious baddies while running, driving, or scaling tall buildings. Amidst the bloodshed is also humor: The handheld camera humanizes Henry's RoboCop-like steeliness, and the director finds just enough quiet moments to mock the film's knowingly absurd spectacle. Henry may be a ferocious super-soldier, but there's also something touchingly mortal about him, the twitchy camera movements suggesting the character's insecurity and vulnerability. That's before he tries getting on a horse, leading to one of the film's funniest bits.\n\nBut people don't pay money just to see cinematic exercises—ultimately, a movie has to work as some form of entertainment. Hardcore Henry gradually discovers that strapping GoPros to camera operators and creating some pretty terrific \"how did they do that?\" effects sequences is only half the battle. The reveal of what really happened to Henry doesn't prove particularly satisfying. More importantly, the movie's unrelentingly adolescent tone starts to feel like slow death.\n\nThere's nothing wrong with a filmmaker indulging in some shameless ultra-violence, but Naishuller's attitude toward his female characters and Copley's horribly hammy performance as Henry's gonzo sidekick speak volumes about a director who seems to be stuck in the mindset of a horny, self-satisfied 12-year-old boy. (No surprise that the film was produced by Timur Bekmambetov, who's become a bellwether for this sort of dude's-dude cinema thanks to Wanted and Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter.) Sleazy sex clubs and funky secret lairs dominate Hardcore Henry's second half. Even the film's final battle royale has the feverish overkill that reeks of middle-school boys still petrified of girls.\n\nNone of this is outright bad, but it sure is wearying, like hearing the same three-chord punk song 15 times in a row. It gives you a jolt, but then the jolt gets familiar, and then it grows monotonous. Future film students may well study Hardcore Henry to analyze its groundbreaking use of P.O.V. to add intensity and novelty to action movies. But hopefully they'll be able to say that better directors took the innovation and actually did something meaningful with it."
