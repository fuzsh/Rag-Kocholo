The supplemental features on the release include archival audio commentary by Paul Schrader; archival audio commentary by critics Eddy Friedfeld, Lee Pfeiffer, and Paul Scrabo' and vintage trailer. In English, with optional English SDH subtitles for the main feature. Region-Free.\n\nThe reluctant detective\n\nHardcore feels like an adult adaptation of Alice in Wonderland but with two major flaws. One is directly related to Paul Schrader's decision to replace the famous character from the classic novel with an aging businessman from Michigan who has the imagination of a dead ox. The second has to do with the fact that the film also heads down a different rabbit hole -- a much bigger, darker, and dangerous hole.\n\nThe journey begins in Grand Rapids, where divorced small-time businessman Jake VanDorn (George C.Scott, The New Centurions) and relatives gather to celebrate Christmas. When the festivities end, Jake sends his teenage daughter Kristen (Ilan Davis) on a convention trip to California and then goes back to overseeing the preparation work for an upcoming trade show. Then someone phones him from California to tell him that Kristen has disappeared. Jake immediately abandons everything and takes the first plane to LA, where he promptly hires a veteran private detective (Peter Boyle, The Friends of Eddie Coyle) who is supposedly really good at finding missing young girls.\n\nThe buildup to the meeting is quite interesting, as it leaves one anticipating that the film would either evolve into a serious family drama or a conventional crime thriller. However, it becomes something entirely different.\n\nThe detective returns to Jake with news that abruptly forces him to begin seeing the world around him from an entirely different angle. He reveals to him that he has 'found' Kristen, but in a low-budget pornographic film whose creators would be impossible to track down. When Jake eventually recovers from the shock, he releases the detective, and then decides to go searching for Kristen deep into the labyrinth of a murky industry ruled by all sorts of creepy characters.\n\nThe film is deeply unsettling at times, but also fascinating to behold because it really does offer an authentic trip through a world that prior to it was essentially ignored by American directors. There is a massive amount of footage that was shot on-location at real sleazy clubs and adult theaters, where the types of activities that Scott's character observes were in fact part of the daily routines there.\n\nThere is a short but very interesting archival interview on this release with cinematographer Michael Chapman in which he reveals that the film's visual style quickly evolved after Scott committed to it. Apparently, the initial plan was to shoot it on 16mm so that it looks like a raw anthropological documentary feature, but Scott's arrival basically elevated the value of the production and the film retained a more traditional cinematic appearance. Chapman then confesses that even years later he remained convinced that the initial plan for the film was the right one. It is an interesting opinion, but it is a flawed one because one of the main reasons the film remains strikingly effective is the fact that it accurately preserves the colorful kitsch that quickly became an essential element of the adult industry.\n\nThe ultra-atmospheric visuals are frequently brilliantly synchronized with some very trippy tunes that were composed by Jack Nitzsche (William Friedkin's Cruising, The Exorcist).\n\nHardcore Blu-ray, Video Quality\n\nPresented in its original aspect ratio of 1.85:1, encoded with MPEG-4 AVC and granted a 1080p transfer, Hardcore arrives on Blu-ray courtesy of Kino Lorber.\n\nThe only other release of Hardcore that I have in my library is this British release, which Indicator/Powerhouse Films produced in 2017. It is sourced from a fabulous 4K master that was prepared by Sony Pictures.\n\nKino Lorber's release of Hardcore is sourced from the same 4K master. Predictably, the film looks outstanding on Blu-ray. I revisited it again last night and, to be entirely honest, I like how it looks on my system even more now. Delineation, clarity, and depth range from excellent to what I consider to be 'reference level' quality, which is very impressive because the original cinematography produces numerous quite diverse visuals. For example, some look very polished, while some have a borderline documentary appearance. On a large screen, these visuals boasts terrific density levels as well. Fluidity is impressive, too. Color balance is pitch-perfect. There are wonderful, very nicely saturated and beautiful organic primaries and supporting nuances. I think that this is as good as color reproduction can be in 1080p. Image stability is excellent. The entire film looks very clean and healthy as well. (Note: This is a Region-Free Blu-ray release. Therefore, you will be able to play it on your player regardless of your geographical location).\n\nHardcore Blu-ray, Audio Quality\n\nThere is only one standard audio track on this Blu-ray release: English DTS-HD Master Audio 2.0. Optional English SDH subtitles are provided for the main feature.\n\nWhen I viewed the British release of Hardcore, I was immediately able to tell that the audio was fully redone because it was very, very healthy. Unsurprisingly, the audio sounds just as impressive on this release. It will not test the muscles of your audio system, but if you appreciate audio that has all-around solid organic qualities, you will like what comes out of your speakers.\n\nHardcore Blu-ray, Special Features and Extras\n\nTrailer - restored original U.S. trailer for Hardcore. In English, not subtitled. (2 min).\n\nCommentary One - Paul Schrader recorded this audio commentary in 2016. The overwhelming majority of the comments that emerge from it address casting choices that were made, the production and shooting processes, the different locations that were chosen for key sequences, the style and tone of the film (and specifically how the San Francisco and San Diego footage was done), as well as some myths about the rating of the film and the use of erotic images in it.\n\nCommentary Two - this archival audio commentary was recorded by critics Eddy Friedfeld, Lee Pfeiffer, and Paul Scrabo.\n\nCover - reversible cover with vintage poster art for Hardcore.\n\nHardcore Blu-ray, Overall Score and Recommendation\n\nIt almost feels like at times Paul Schrader went too far with this film, but kept shooting because he had a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to do something very different. I cannot say that I enjoy watching it, but I have always thought of it as a tremendous time capsule with that tough and uncompromising attitude that the last great American films from the '70s had. Kino Lorber's release is sourced from a fabulous 4K master that was prepared by Sony Pictures. VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.\n\nHardcore: Other Editions\n\nBlu-ray\n\n1-disc\n\nSimilar titles you might also like\n\nWhat is this?\n\nUse the thumbs up and thumbs down icons to agree or disagree that the title is similar to Hardcore.
