        "text": "johnmaloof says:\n\nI purchased a giant lot of negatives from a small auction house here in Chicago. It is the work of Vivian Maier, a French born photographer who recently past away in April of 2009 in Chicago, where she resided. I opened a blogspot blog with her work here; www.vivianmaier.com.\n\nI have a ton of her work (about 30-40,000 negatives) which ranges in dates from the 1950's-1970's. I guess my question is, what do I do with this stuff? Check out the blog. Is this type of work worthy of exhibitions, a book? Or do bodies of work like this come up often?\n\nAny direction would be great.\n\n7:26PM, 9 October 2009 PDT\n\njohnmaloof says:\n\nI just contacted the Chicago Cultural Center and applied for an exhibition with the curator. It takes a few months for a response. They were very nice, by the way.\n\nI contacted the Stephen Daiter Gallery. The person I spoke with said the same thing, \"strong work...above average for the time period\" but, since they are negatives, not prints, they can't do much for me.\n\nI thought about contacting the Chicago History Museum but just the thought of this stuff getting filed away for reference purposes keeps me from doing that. I have an emotional attachment to her work at this point.\n\nages ago\n\nJohn Goldsmith says:\n\nWow. Really cool.\n\nThe most obvious point of contacts, if you ask me, are the Chicago Historical Society and the Art Institute of Chicago. I can't place of those photos but some were certainly taken in Chicago. Another option, if you read the obituary below, is to donate them to the Native American Heritage Association.\n\n**************************\n\nPublished in the Chicago Tribune on 4/23/2009\n\nVIVIAN MAIER\n\nVivian Maier, proud native of France and Chicago resident for the last 50 years died peacefully on Monday. Second mother to John, Lane and Matthew. A free and kindred spirit who magically touched the lives of all who knew her. Always ready to give her advice, opinion or a helping hand. Movie critic and photographer extraordinaire. A truly special person who will be sorely missed but whose long and wonderful life we all celebrate and will always remember. Memorial donations can be given to the Native American Heritage Association, P.O. Box 512, Rapid City, SD 57709.\n\nwww.legacy.com/Obituaries.asp?Page=LifeStoryPrint&Per...\n\nedit: I totally forgot about the cultural centre. Good idea.\n\nOriginally posted ages ago.\n\nJohn Goldsmith edited this topic ages ago.\n\njohnmaloof says:\n\nAh, yes. I am very familiar of her obituary. The Chicago Tribune gives me dead-ends on the people who placed the ad. They gave me an address that doesn't exist and a phone number that is disconnected. I have not much information on this woman, and I have dug deep. I was contacted by a photographer named Alan Sekula. He dug up info on her and found that she was a Jewish refugee from wartime France. She was a \"keep your distance from me\" type of person and had strong opinions for women's rights. She was a loner and poor.\n\nHere's a kicker. I had 1000 rolls of her 120 film that were never developed. I have been successfully developing this film which is from the 1960's! I have about 600 rolls left to go. This maybe a sign that she was obsessed with photography so much so that she just liked to take the picture and nothing more.\n\nI'm not going to donate them unless her work will be exposed and not just stored. I really would like to get this stuff out there but it seems difficult due to the medium...just negatives. Although I believe much of Atget's work was found after his death in the form of glass negatives.\n\nOriginally posted ages ago.\n\njohnmaloof edited this topic ages ago.\n\nJohn Goldsmith says:\n\nI totally understand your argument. Obviously you are impressed with her work and if nobody has the same passion as you... why give it up for another dark closet?\n\nThis story is so amazing and I love reading the details. Given her strong photography, I was surprised that no Wiki page existed. She wan't much into networking as you say.\n\nOther (wing-nut) suggestions are to donate the negs to the Jane Addams Hull House; she was another strong, though vocal, woman from Chicago. The JA center is where I first learned photography. My teacher, Richard Stromberg, created a new studio for photographers after the Lakeview center was sold. The new studio seems vibrant and maybe a nice home for the work you possess.\n\nwww.uic.edu/jaddams/hull/newdesign/ja.html\n\nchicagophotoclasses.com/\n\nages ago\n\njohnmaloof says:\n\nCool. I will look into your suggestions.\n\nI'm sure no Wiki page existed because she was late in age when that came to be. Her entire estate was auctioned (furniture and all). This was no fine art auction where I purchased this from. Straight junk & antiques auction house. I feel that perhaps no friends or relatives claimed anything because she had none.\n\nI found that she did babysitting on the Northside for quite some time. I have a hunch the child/children have grown older and are the ones who placed the obituary in the paper (traced the non-existent address to a Northside block). The mystery is what keeps me going on her. If I knew all about her, I don't think I'd be as interested.\n\nages ago\n\njohnmaloof says:\n\nThanks for viewing her work. Perhaps I will do an exhibition and go from there. Of course, not all of her negatives were home runs. I scanned about 1,000 that I thought were strong. I definitely have enough to work with.\n\n@weakmassive: I went to Columbia College. I should have thought about that one myself. I will approach them for sure.\n\nages ago\n\nGary Hubbs | The Scale Gallery says:\n\nWow, really freaking cool. Its very fortunate that this work has fallen into the right hands, as someone said above it could easily have been thrown into a dumpster and lost forever. I have no doubt that you will find someone whose passion in this endeavor will match your own, johnmaloof, if not sooner than later. If I had any ideas for you, I'd share them, but as of now I have none, although there are some good places to approach listed above. This work deserves its day, that's for sure.\n\nages ago\n\njohnmaloof says:\n\nThe work I have is probably all of the work she did during that period. Whether or not she had more before or after is another question. I know that I have about 80-90% of the work that sold at the auction. I'm not sure what an IP assignment is so, don't think I got one of those.\n\nNot sure what market value is.\n\nages ago\n\ninstinctive earth [deleted] says:\n\njust another example of how talented women photographers really are undervalued by a male dominated sexist industry. if it had been a man who had taken the same shots, then there would have been countless blogs and wikis dedicated to his life's work.\n\nit is also somewhat ironic that a man purchased these discarded negatives.\n\nthis is an outrage that her work was allowed to fall by the wayside like this. time for women to take a stand and stop this needless discrimination at the hands of male photogs/publishers!\n\nages ago\n\ncomplete word [deleted] says:\n\nIt is interesting that the immediate assumption is to turn to established institutions. Just out of curosity, why not upload them under CC to flickr? I imagine it would reach the largest audience that way. I'm sure as T. Hawk mentioned, there are IP issues. It also involves a fair amount of personal time and effort, which is inevitably your personal decision.\n\nEssentially, distribute them in an open manner to the largest audience possible.\n\nages ago\n\njohnmaloof says:\n\n@notgnihsaw: Good idea. Maybe I will do that.\n\n@Therr: I seriously don't think she had heirs. One of her obituary's said that she was a \"second mother to\"...(so and so). I looked them up and they are not related. I assume it was the children she was the nanny to for many years, who also most likely put up the obituary. If there were any heirs, you would think they would have claimed some of her estate. Instead, her entire property was auctioned off, to my knowledge. This is what I learned talking to the owners of the auction house. I looked into the legal rights on these and it's vague if there are no heirs.\n\nI did start selling her negatives on eBay. I sold about 200 of them. They sold for a lot. One in particular sold for $80! That's when I stopped and realized there's something here that should stay together.\n\n@Pachinko: The first batch of rolls came out a bit thin but mainly usable. It was only after developing about 100 rolls that I realized I should be pushing these. Since then, they have been fine. She used Kodak Tri-X 120 film. Every roll was hand labeled in French.\n\nOriginally posted ages ago.\n\njohnmaloof edited this topic ages ago.\n\nabsent basin [deleted] says:\n\nI would just keep the blog going for awhile. These things tend to take on a life of their own, and with the right exposure from the photography community, I'm sure the work will find its place.\n\nI'm curious about the editing. In the case of Gary Stochl, the first glimpse we got was a very tightly edited book. In this instance, we'll probably get a much looser web-centric edit which is either good or bad I suppose.\n\nIt makes me wonder how many other Vivian's are out there. If enough of this work comes out, the photography world might need to re-evaluate its canon....\n\nOriginally posted ages ago.\n\nabsent basin edited this topic ages ago.\n\nteh resa says:\n\nI certainly agree that the work should stay together. I just thought maybe you could sell the whole body of work to some organization with the money and influence to put it together - or figure out how to get it recognized as orphaned. I'd think you might be able to make a tidy bit of money.\n\nA few rolls of 35mm trix that I've left around for 10+ years and developed at 800 have ended up very grainy. You did a good job with those 120s\n\nages ago\n\nceaseless oven [deleted] says:\n\nyup, some really good stuff in there. well done on getting them and kudos for actually looking at doing something with them.\n\nIf there is anything that I could recommend it would be to try and get some funding together for a better website... not that it needs much but I personally don't find blogspot that easy to use when it comes to browsing photography.\n\nHow is the stuff organised at the moment, is there any information with the prints or anything about locations, projects or anything of the like?\n\nwould be nice to have some sort of glimpse into how the photographer wanted them to be grouped or even presented.\n\nages ago\n\nPaul Russell99 says:\n\nI agree with what Bryan says about keeping the blog going and just see what happens.\n\nI'm sure the whole story about how you came across them + quality of images + historical document aspects add up to it being interesting enough to become newsworthy, and then more information about her, offers of help from curators, etc. might follow on from there.\n\nIt would be nice to get a small grant to pay for your time, chemicals, etc., if that sort of thing is possible!\n\nOriginally posted ages ago.\n\nPaul Russell99 edited this topic ages ago.\n\njohnmaloof says:\n\n@James_Dodd: Her negatives are not really organized. They are in archival sleeves but they weren't in any order when I received them in old shoe boxes and such. Each sleeve may have a couple of words in French describing the location and the date. There are only a handfull of small prints with no description on them.\n\n@Paul_Russell99: I am looking into a grant in case I get the exhibition acceptance from the Chicago Cultural Centre. I have done a bunch of research. Most lead to dead-ends. I have a few more leads but I really am afraid there may not be much info on her.\n\nWhat type of news medium do you think I should approach?\n\n@gumanow: Thanks but, I have no problem paying for the film developing. I appreciate the courteous suggestion. It's more time intensive than anything.\n\nages ago\n\nJohn Goldsmith says:\n\nThis is similar to Bryan's idea but maybe a bit more proactive than using just your own blog...\n\nI wonder if you could submit some to a photography website that might give more exposure, say Shorpy. I mean.. I know you don't know a great deal about the photographer but maybe your auction story and the pics would make for a good blog post and reach a wider audience.\n\nOriginally posted ages ago.\n\nJohn Goldsmith edited this topic ages ago.\n\ninstinctive earth [deleted] says:\n\nbennehboy: \"yeah i say take a stand - so what are you going to do to end male tyranny?\"\n\nwell for starters I am going to demand that your avatar have compulsory plastic surgery and possibly a facial massage to top it off. because franks there would sure stand out in a street full of people when on my leash, hence making it even more difficult to get quality street photos.\n\nafter the facial is done, i would take him off his leash and tell him to go fetch my nikon from the shelf and some more neopan from the store. after that i would drag franks around sunset boulevard whilst making him recite quotes from notables like lange, bourke-white, arbus and levitt, all the while whipping him with my camera leash if he gets any wrong.\n\nages ago\n\nPaul Russell99 says:\n\n@ johnmaloof\n\n\"What type of news medium do you think I should approach?\" -- oh, I don't know, I was just saying that it will probably find you if you do a bit of Internet promotion.\n\nBTW, if you haven't already done this, it's easy to set up Google Analytics on your blog so you can see where your visitors come from (I got that from Joni, I think).\n\nOriginally posted ages ago.\n\nPaul Russell99 edited this topic ages ago.\n\nkinoglass says:\n\nInteresting that Vivian Maier did not see her work, she would shoot and store the negs. What was she planning to do, I wonder.\n\nLooking at the images deprived of any other details raises many questions, while most are distinctively shot in Chicago some are likely to have been shot in NYC. Then, when, in what year, as time defines almost everything.\n\nThere is no question the artist and his/her work are bonded together, not just by the clicking of the shutter, but by time, location, age, context and personal history. Other wise the meaning of art is nearly destroyed reduced to a meaningless image suspended in time, keeping you guessing.\n\nWe can't hardly define Vivian Maier by looking only at her work, work she never saw!\n\nages ago\n\nstanco55 says:\n\nHave you contacted the major papers in Chicago? This would certainly be news of note there, and they could certainly help get the word out! Hopefully, The Windy City will step in and honor this most worthy (and until now anonymous) of its citizens. And if they don't, take your time until someone (be it a public or private museum, photo gallery, photo institution or university) offers you the best home possible (wherever it may be) for this outstanding collection...\n\nages ago\n\nkinoglass says:\n\nI am very curious about Vivian Maier and her work. An artist of her talent and sensitivity could hardly afford to see her work thrown into a cardboard box for posterity to discover or to end uncovered in the city dump.\n\nThe story of Robert Capa comes to mind, the fictitious character created by Gerta Taro and her father to sell her pictures as the work of an American photographer who did not exist, only to became real when the trick was uncovered, Was Vivian Maier feeding her photographs to some one else? She was also a refugee from Europe, a displaced Jewish soul new to the new world culture that she so humanly reflects in her photographs. Could it be that some one else was passing as the author of her work?\n\nMay I ask, how did she support herself? Are there other signs of her life, correspondence, or indications she had contacts with the photography world? How intriguing, I say.\n\nOriginally posted ages ago.\n\nkinoglass edited this topic ages ago.\n\njohnmaloof says:\n\nKinoglass: The only way I found her name was because it was written with pencil on a photo-lab envelope. I decided to 'Google' her name about a year after I purchased these only to find her obituary placed the day before my search. She passed only a couple of days before my Google search. How wierd?\n\nI thought about meeting her in person prior but, the auction house had stated she was ill so, I didn't want to bother her. Soooo many questions would have been answered if I had. It eats at me from time to time.\n\nages ago\n\nkinoglass says:\n\njohnmaloof, it will be perhaps important to contact the people that have disposed of her possessions and find what else is there bringing light to her past such as relatives, friends, etc., you may be in a better position before the press gets hold of the story and makes who knows what of her life. I am in the East coast. My son who lives in Chicago brought the story to my attention today.\n\nages ago\n\ninstinctive earth [deleted] says:\n\nbennehboy - i'm glad that your amused. it tells me one of two things:\n\na) your easily amused\n\nb) my pathetic attempt at a gonzo reply actually carried some weight\n\ni highly doubt that it was b), because i'm illlliterate\n\nso my guess is your easily amused which is not actually a bad attribute for a photographer to carry with them, as it enables them to make light of everyday situations on the street.\n\nin the context of this forum, it is also cool to have a light hearted mod/frank running the show as there are enough trigger happy admins over there at the nikon forum>\n\nages ago\n\naccurate appliance [deleted] says:\n\nI'd like to add that you thumb thru a copy of B&W magazine. Each issue has a section on collectors and the photo market. I'm not advocating buying a copy-unless it'd be a useful resource after you flip thru it. There are ads for tons of galleries, archives, studios and auctioneers that could help spread the work of this fine female artist.\n\nSo far as I can tell the print market for posthumous work is low. Most stuff that sells well is for stuff printed while the artist was alive, signed and dated.\n\nages ago"
